ABOUT AND HOW TO USE THIS BOOK 
ABOUT 
I read recently that approximately two thirds of careers that exist today (2016) will be done by 
robots within the next 20 years. A pretty scary statistic. However, on a positive note or more 
positively (choose one or the other) a number of yet-to-exist roles will be created in the process, 
and history will back up this claim.  
 
It's hard to say whether Excel specifically has caused any roles to become redundant, however it is 
pretty clear that Excel is a tremendous time saving tool and gaining an understanding of even the 
basic Excel functions at your fingertips can put you at a competitive advantage in the workplace in 
any such scenario.  
 
When I think back to my first encounters with computers (some time ago!) I recall being told 
“computers don’t make mistakes… they only do what they’re told to do”. This stuck with me and is 
also true for Excel, functions can only perform the calculations if you provide the correct data for 
them to perform.  
 
As we move into an era of big data, then data management techniques will become more in 
demand, so it pays to get comfortable with handling large volumes of data and the functions that 
can help you achieve this. This book is focused primarily around the key Excel functions available 
and providing an insight into how they operate. 
 
At the end of this book you: 
• 
Will understand a variety of functions to solve your day-to-day problems. 
• 
Will be able to manipulate data reports into manageable and meaningful results. 
• 
May wonder when you will ever use such functions, but with practical examples and 
practice you will see how useful they can potentially be. 
• 
Will improve and you will begin to work smarter not harder!

About the author 
 
ABOUT THE AUTHOR 
Bryan Crosland is an accountant by trade and Fellow of the Association of Chartered and Certified 
Accountants. He is a certified Microsoft Office Specialist with over 20 years of experience using 
Excel and has provided Excel based solutions and training to numerous organisations in that time. 
In his spare time he enjoys running and cycling. 
 
A general rule I like to live by is if you are sitting at a desk 
plugging away onerously into Excel thinking to yourself "There 
has to be an easier way of doing this!" then chances are there is! 
 
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK 
 
You learn Excel by doing. Usually to understand an Excel based solution, you first need a problem 
to overcome. Therefore, all functions mentioned in this book have examples and exercises that you 
can download to your device to work through in conjunction with instructions in this book. To 
access these examples and exercises please visit:

Excel Basics and Refresh 
 
EXCEL BASICS AND REFRESH 
EXCEL BASICS AND REFRESH 
 
This textbook is primarily concerned with functions and assumes a very basic knowledge of Excel, 
however as an introduction and refresh, some terminology and fundamentals of Excel logic are 
explained below. 
TERMINOLOGY 
Workbook vs. Worksheet – When you open Excel, a new file is created called Book 1, however you 
can save it as a different name. This is the Workbook. 
Within your Workbook you will find Worksheets, these are labelled at the bottom-left of the 
window as per the diagram below. 
 
 
 
 
You can add sheets to your Workbook, rename, delete them, re-arrange, even change the tab 
colour.  Right click the Sheet Name to bring up all of these options and more. 
Tip: If you double click the left mouse button on the Sheet Name 
it will allow you to rename it. 
 
 
Function or Formula – A function in Excel terms is a pre-defined formula to aid you in calculation, 
common examples include SUM or VLOOKUP (more on these later).  
A formula is a mathematical function used to calculate a result based on data from absolute or 
variable sources. They will usually consist of some combination of mathematical operators ( +, -, *, 
/) (e.g.: =(A1+A5)/B13).  
Sheet Navigation 
Sheet Name

Excel Basics and Refresh 
However, a formula may also include one or more functions.  When you type a function into a cell, 
provided it is entered correctly that cell will display the result of the function, rather than the 
function itself.  You can combine many functions and operators in a single function to obtain more 
complex results. 
 
Note: Whenever you start to enter a formula you should always 
start with the ‘=’ sign as displayed in the below equation. In 
almost all cases you will only need to enter the equals sign ( = ) 
once in a formula and that is at the start. 
 
Nested Functions 
A nested function is essentially a function within another function, we will explore examples of 
nested functions later in the book but for now this is all you need to understand. If you think of a 
standalone function, it will traditionally refer to a cell or value that may be fixed in nature. A nested 
function allows us to instead perform another calculation that will turn this fixed value into a 
variable. 
In a nested formula, Excel will colour the paired brackets to guide you. The outside brackets are 
always coloured black. In the example below you will see multiple brackets paired by colour i.e. red 
and red and black and black. 
Example: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Opening RED 
Bracket 
Closing RED

Arguments 
An argument is what makes up the body of a function in Excel, a function typically consisting of one 
or more arguments. For example, the VLOOKUP function contains four arguments, three are 
compulsory and one optional. Optional arguments are denoted inside square brackets [  ]. Each 
argument needs to be separated by a comma ( , ) symbol. 
When entering a function, you will be presented with a guide on the arguments which will appear 
as below. The text “table_array” in bold indicates that you are currently required to enter that 
particular argument. 
 
 
FIGURE 1 FUNCTION ARGUMENTS 
 
Operators 
Operators will indicate what calculation that needs to be performed in a formula. There are four 
types of operators you will encounter in Microsoft Excel: 
Arithmetic – Perform the basic mathematical calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication 
division).  
ARITHMETIC OPERATOR 
EXAMPLE 
+ (plus sign) 
Addition (5+5) 
– (minus sign) 
Subtraction(3–1) 
Negation (–1) 
* (asterisk) 
Multiplication (3*3) 
/ (oblique) 
Division (4/2) 
% (percentage sign) 
Percentage (20%) 
^ (caret) 
Exponentiation (3^2)

Comparison – These operators are used to compare two values, the result of which will always be 
either TRUE or FALSE. 
COMPARISON OPERATOR 
EXAMPLE 
= (equal to) 
Equal to (A3=B3) 
> (greater than) 
Greater than (A2>B3) 
< (less than) 
Less than (A1<B1) 
>= (greater than or equal to) 
Greater than or equal to (A1>=B1) 
<= (less than or equal to) 
Less than or equal to (A1<=B1) 
<> (not equal to) 
Not equal to (A1<>B1) 
 
Text - Use the ampersand (&) to join, sometimes referred to as concatenate, one or more text 
strings to produce a single piece of text. 
TEXT 
OPERATOR 
EXAMPLE 
& (ampersand) 
Connects, or concatenates, two values to produce one combined value e.g. 
("North"&"West") 
 
Reference - Combine ranges of cells for calculations with the following operators. 
REFERENCE 
OPERATOR 
EXAMPLE 
: (colon) 
Range operator, sets the range of cells to be selected which includes all cells 
between the two references including the ones specified. e.g. (C5:C15) 
, (comma) 
Union 
operator, 
combines 
multiple 
references 
into 
one. 
e.g. 
(SUM(C5:C15,D5:D15))

REFERENCING 
Excel works on a grid reference system.  You will notice vertical rows on the left-hand side of the 
workbook are numbered sequentially and columns moving horizontally at the top of the workbook 
run alphabetically.  
 
 
This allows each cell in the workbook to be given a cell reference, for example in the picture above, 
the green box indicates that Cell A1 is selected. 
Cell – Cells are the rectangular blocks of a spreadsheet. They are assigned a reference, referred to 
as a cell reference, according to their column and row (e.g. the cell in column C at row number 5 is 
referenced as cell C5). 
 
Absolute vs relative references 
When you enter a cell reference into Excel, the default position is for that cell reference to be a 
relative reference. That is, if you copy and paste that reference, the reference will change 
depending on where you paste to (i.e. relative to where you copied from). 
For example, in the figure below, in cell C8 we have the formula =SUM(C4:C7). 
 
Column Letters 
Row Numbers 
FIGURE 2 ROW AND COLUMN INDICATORS 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
12 
Excel Basics and Refresh 
If this formula is copied one column to the right the cell references change i.e. C changes to D and 
the formula becomes =SUM(D4:D7) 
 
The same is true for rows, in the figure below, in cell G4 we have the formula =SUM(C4:E4) 
 
If this formula is copied one row down the cell references change i.e. row 4 becomes 5 and the 
formula becomes =SUM(C5:E5) 
 
If you wanted to retain the original cell references when copying and pasting, you would need to 
make your references what is called “Absolute References”. To do this you would precede each 
column letter and row number of your reference with a dollar sign ( $ ). This causes the cell 
reference to in effect be fixed. 
For example, in the figure below in cell C11 we have the formula =C9*$H$3. C9 is a relative 
reference and H3 is an absolute reference. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
13 
Excel Basics and Refresh 
 
 
If the formula is copied to the right you can see in the figure below the relative reference has 
changed where the absolute reference remains fixed and formula changes to =D9*$H$3.  
 
Occasionally, a situation may arise where you wish to use a mix of absolute and relative cell 
references, for example, only fixing the column letter or row number, $H3 and H$3 respectively. 
 
 
Tip: To quickly change between absolute, relative and mixed 
references: 
Select the cell containing the formula 
From the formula bar, select the reference you wish to change. 
Press the F4 key to switch between absolute, relative and mixed 
reference types.

ORDER OF OPERATIONS 
Excel performs calculations in a strict order. You may remember from your school days the term 
BODMAS (Brackets, power Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition & Subtraction), other variations 
include BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition & Subtraction) or PEMDAS 
(Parenthesis, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition & Subtraction).  
However you remember it, they all mean the same thing. In any formula calculations are completed 
in this order: 
Entries inside brackets or parenthesis (  ) 
Exponents, Indices or values to the Power Of 
Division 
Multiplication 
Addition 
Subtraction 
 
Note: All functions will require arguments entered inside 
brackets, remember when opening a bracket with the “ ( “ symbol 
you must also close the bracket using the “ ) ” symbol once all 
required arguments have been entered.

FORMULA EDITING 
When you enter a cell reference into a cell you will notice that Excel will automatically colour the 
cells being referenced to aid your view. As you can see in the diagram below the cell C3 has a blue 
border which matches the colour of the “C3” entered into cell C6. 
If you have entered your formula but need to edit it then you can press the F2 key to enter the edit 
mode on the currently selected cell. In this mode you can either use the cursor to edit a section of 
the formula or left click the mouse and drag the border of the cell being referenced to change it. 
For example in the figure above, in edit mode the border of cell C3 and C4 can be selected and 
dragged to another location, changing the formula. 
 
INSERT FUNCTION 
 
The Insert Function button can be used to select from all functions available in Excel and provide help and 
guidance on the various arguments contained inside them.  
As your proficiency grows you will become less dependent on this button. The button can be located next to 
the formula bar and has a fx symbol.

Excel Basics and Refresh 
Once the function button is selected (fx), the window below will appear where you can search for a function 
or choose from a drop-down list under the appropriate category. 
Upon selecting a function, you will then be presented with a further window that will ask you to enter the 
arguments for that specific function.  
 
For each function argument you will be given a piece of narrative that explains the arguments 
purpose.  
Note : completing a function by this method you do not need to separate the arguments using the 
comma ( , ) key. In the figure above you can see the function arguments that will appear if the 
VLOOKUP function is selected. We will cover VLOOKUP later in this book.

Text Functions 
TEXT FUNCTIONS 
TEXT FUNCTIONS 
 
Text functions relate to the character length of cells and can be useful in extracting particular data 
from them; they are more useful with standardised data, for example an account code or telephone 
number are generally of fixed character length.  
In the image to the left you can see a typical contact 
list where contact numbers are of a fixed length, in 
this case 12 characters. The first 5 characters 
typically represent an area code and the final 6 
characters represent the main number. The space 
separating the two elements also counts as a character. 
 
When to use? If you need to extract particular data from individual cells. 
 
In this chapter, we will be referring to the workbook titled Text Functions.xlsx 
As a reminder this workbook can be downloaded by visiting http://simplifiedexcel.blogspot.co.uk/ 
and selecting Textbook Exercises, then the relevant file. 
 
Some Key Text Functions are: 
 
LEN 
In Excel, the LEN function returns the length in characters of the specified cell. One instance this 
may be have use is if you are checking the consistency of data imported from another program. 
This is a relatively straightforward function but it is explained here as it can form part of the building 
blocks of more complex function combinations or if programming in VBA (Visual Basic for 
Applications) 
FIGURE 6 FUNCTION ARGUMENTS WINDOW FOR A VLOOKUP FUNCTION 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
18 
Text Functions 
The syntax for the LEN function is: 
LEN (text) 
text is the string from which to return the character length. This can be a value or a reference to a 
cell value. 
For Example: 
 
 
 
 
Example 1: =Len(B2) would give the number of characters cell B2 contains, in this case 5 
Example 2: =Len(“Hello”) would also give the result 5 
Note: In the above example 2, when entering direct text as 
opposed to a cell reference ensure that the quotation marks “ “ 
are included at either side.  
 
Things to try: 
1. Open the filename Text Functions.xlsx 
2. Select the tab named LEN 
3. In cell E5 enter =LEN(B5) 
 
 
4. Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
FIGURE 7 LEN FUNCTION 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
19 
Text Functions 
 
You will notice the length of cell B5 and cells beneath it is now displayed in column E. 
 
LEFT 
Starting from the left-most character, the LEFT function allows you to extract a substring from a 
string. 
In other words, we can use this to display a given number of characters from the left side of a 
particular cell value. 
The syntax for the LEFT function is: 
LEFT (text, num_chars ) 
text is the string that you wish to extract from. 
num_chars indicates the number of characters that you wish to extract starting from the left-most 
character. 
 
Example: 
 Entering =Left(B2,3) into a cell would give the 3 leftmost 
characters of cell B2 and return the result “Hel”. 
Entering =Left(“Hello”, 3) into a cell would also give the result 
“Hel” 
 
 
 
Things to try: 
1. Open the filename Text Functions.xlsx 
2. Select the tab named LEFT  
3. In cell E5 enter =LEFT(B5,7) 
FIGURE 8 LEFT FUNCTIONE EXAMPLE 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS

Text Functions 
 
 
4. Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
You will notice the seven characters to the left of cell B5 are now displayed. 
 
RIGHT 
In Excel, the RIGHT function extracts a substring from a string starting from the right-most 
character. 
In other words, we can use this to display a given number of characters from the right side of a 
particular cell value. 
The syntax for the RIGHT function is: 
RIGHT (text, num_chars ) 
text is the string that you wish to extract from. 
num_chars indicates the number of characters that you wish to extract starting from the right-most 
character. 
 
Example: 
 
Entering =Right(B2,4) into a cell would give the 4 rightmost 
characters of cell B2, which would be “ello”. 
Entering =Right(“Hello”,4) into a cell would also give the result 
“ello”. 
FIGURE 9 RIGHT FUNCTION EXAMPLE 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS

Text Functions 
 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the filename Text Functions.xlsx 
2) Select the tab named RIGHT 
3) In cell E5 enter =RIGHT(B5,4) 
 
4) Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
You will notice the four characters to the right of cell B5 are now displayed. Also note that blank 
cells have been included within the count. 
 
MID 
We have looked at the LEFT and RIGHT functions which were pretty straight forward for finding 
characters at the beginning or end of text but what if there was text in the middle that you wanted 
to extract? The MID function (abbreviated from Middle) allows us to do this by adding an argument 
to specify the start position in the text we want to start counting characters from. 
The syntax for the MID function is: 
MID( text, start_num, num_chars ) 
text is which cell or text do you want to analyse. This can be text entered in quotation marks “ ” or 
a reference to a cell that contains text. 
start_num indicates the position in the string that you will begin extracting from. The first position 
in the string is 1. 
num_chars indicates the number of characters from that start position that you wish to extract. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
22 
Text Functions 
 
 
 
 
 
Example: 
Entering =Mid(B2, 2, 3) into a cell would return characters 2 to 4 
from the cell reference B2, in this case would return “ell”. 
 Entering =Mid(“Hello”, 2, 3) into a cell would return characters 2 to 
4 from the word “Hello” also giving the result “ell” 
 
 
To explain further, in this example from the word “Hello” we are looking for the second character 
as our start position, denoted by the number 2. Then counting three characters from and including 
that start position, denoted by the number 3. These three characters are “e” “l” and “l” giving the 
result “ell”. 
 
Things to try: 
1. Open the filename Text Functions.xlsx 
2. Select the tab named MID 
3. In cell E5 enter =MID(B5,9,3) 
4. Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
You will notice the three characters from the middle of cell G5 are presented starting from the 
ninth character. 
 
TRIM 
In Excel, the TRIM function returns a text value with the leading and trailing spaces removed. It will 
also remove other spaces except for single spaces between text. This can be particularly useful if 
you are importing data from another program that used a different formatting. 
 
FIGURE 10 MID FUNCTION EXAMPLE 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
23 
Text Functions 
The syntax for the TRIM function is: 
TRIM( text ) 
text is the text value to remove spaces from. 
Example: 
From the figure to the left, Entering =Trim(B2) into a cell would 
return the value “MR A Jones”, note the removal of unnecessary 
spaces. 
Entering =Trim(“   MR      A  Jones  ”) into a cell would also return 
the value “MR A Jones” 
 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the filename Text Functions.xlsx 
2) Select the tab named TRIM 
3) In cell E5 enter =TRIM(B5) 
4) Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
5) You will notice that cell E5 has been replicated but the blank cells, except for single spaces 
between words, have been removed. 
Further things to try: 
6) In the same tab, in cell E5 instead enter =TRIM(MID(B5,13,20)) 
7) Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
8) Using a combination of functions we have extracted data from the middle of a cell including 
spaces and then applied the trim function to remove occurrences where two or more 
spaces exist. 
 
SETTING CASE (UPPER, LOWER & PROPER) 
Some functions exist in Excel that enable us to set the case of the text in question. It can sometimes 
occur, if you are importing data from other sources or programs for example, the text may be in 
lower case or upper case. This can be amended using functions such as UPPER, LOWER, PROPER or 
a combination of the three. 
 
 
FIGURE 11 TRIM FUNCTION EXAMPLE 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
24 
Text Functions 
UPPER 
This function simply converts text strings to upper case. 
The syntax for the UPPER function is: 
 
UPPER( text) 
text is the text value you want to convert to upper case. 
LOWER 
This function simply converts text strings to lower case. 
The syntax for the LOWER function is: 
 
LOWER( text) 
text is the text value you want to convert to lower case. 
 
PROPER 
You may notice a pattern by now, however this function is slightly different in that it analyses a text 
string and will capitalise the first letter of each word in a text string, all other characters are set to 
lower case. The syntax for the PROPER function is: 
 
PROPER( text) 
text is the text value you want to convert. 
Example: 
From the figure to the left, Entering =Proper(B2) 
into a cell would return the value “Text In 
Haphazard Case”.

Text Functions 
 
JOINING CELLS TOGETHER (CONCATENATION) 
Concatenation is simply the process of joining cell text or values together. The symbol used to join 
cell values together is the ampersand or “&” symbol. Remember when entering text into a formula 
it must be enclosed in quotation marks. 
If we take the previous example and let’s say you wanted to capitalise just the first letter of the 
entire cell, then you could use a combination of functions. 
For example, the formula 
=UPPER(LEFT(B2,1))&LOWER(MID(B2,2,21)) would return the result “Text in haphazard case” 
 
FIGURE 13 CONCATENATED CELLS EXAMPLE 
To break it down into sections 
UPPER(LEFT(B2,1)) - this specifies that we want to capitalise the first letter of the cell B2, in this 
case the letter “t” capitalises to “T”. 
& - this is the ampersand key that acts as a join or connector between text functions. 
LOWER(MID(B2,2,21)) – this specifies that we would like all cells from the second character in cell 
B2 to be presented in lower case. This gives the result “ext in haphazard case” 
When we join these three elements together you get the result “Text in haphazard case”. 
In the above example we used the value “21” to denote how many characters to count, however if 
we did not know this value we could enter a very high value, say “500”, to ensure we captured all 
characters.  
This gives us a slight additional problem in that we will then have trailing spaces in the formula 
result. This in turn can be rectified by encapsulating the entre formula inside a TRIM function; our 
formula now becomes:

=TRIM(UPPER(LEFT(B2,1))&LOWER(MID(B2,21))) 
 
FIND 
The FIND function allows us, as you may have guessed, to find a specific character or group of 
characters in a text string.  
The syntax for the FIND function is: 
 
Find( find_text, within_text, start_num) 
find_text is what text are you looking for, this can be a cell reference containing some text or text 
entered in quotation marks “”. 
within_text specifies which cell or text do you want to search in i.e. where do you want to search 
for it. 
start_num is the character position you want to start searching from. This argument is optional, if 
left blank Excel will search from character position 1. 
Example: 
=Find(“Hello”,B2,1) would return the result 
11. This is because the word ‘Hello’ appears 11 
characters in to the text string from character 
1. Note that the spaces and symbols such as 
the apostrophe ( ‘ ) are counted as a character. 
 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the filename Text Functions.xlsx 
2) Select the tab named FIND 
3) In this sheet we have a list of joined up data, and each join is represented by a ~ symbol. 
4) In cell E5 enter =FIND("~",B5,1)

5) Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
6) This will tell us the character position of the first ~ symbol in column B. 
What if we wanted to find the second ~ symbol? 
Further things to try: 
7) In cell F5 enter =FIND("~",B5,E5+1) 
8) Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
9) This will tell us the character position of the second ~ symbol in column B. 
In this further exercise, the find function was told to use the start_num as E5+1. E5 contained the 
character position of the first ~ symbol (8) and we added 1 to start the FIND at character position 
9. 
 
REPLACE 
The replace function allows us to replace  
 
Replace(old_text, start_num, num_chars, new_text) 
old_text is text or the cell reference containing the text that you want characters to be replaced in. 
start_num is the first character position from which you want to replace characters. 
num_chars is the number of characters from the character position specified above you want to 
replace. 
new_text is what text you want to replace the specified characters with. The replacement text does 
not have to be the same length in characters as the characters being replaced. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the filename Text Functions.xlsx 
2) Select the tab named REPLACE 
3) In this sheet we have a list of joined up data, and each join is represented by a ~ symbol. 
Let’s say we wanted to replace the ~ symbol with a – symbol. 
4) In cell E5 enter =REPLACE(B5,8,1,"-") 
5) Copy and paste the formula or use Autofill to cell E30 
This will replace the 8th character of cells in column B with the “-“ symbol.

Lookup & Reference Functions 
LOOKUP AND REFERENCE FUNCTIONS 
LOOKUP & REFERENCE FUNCTIONS 
 
Lookup functions will, put simply, look-up a specified value in a table or database and return a 
corresponding value. For example, if you went into a restaurant and ordered a number off the 
menu, the waiter would lookup that value and cross reference to a meal choice.  In order to perform 
a lookup, Excel will need to know some basic criteria.  We will look more closely at these criteria in 
this chapter. 
Reference functions relate to determining a range of cells or cell addresses including column or row 
numbers.  Remember from the topic on referencing that references can be placed absolute (fixed) 
or placed relative to the cell you entered them into. 
In this chapter, we will be referring to the workbook titled lookup_and_reference.xlsx 
As a reminder this workbook can be downloaded by visiting http://simplifiedexcel.blogspot.co.uk/ 
and selecting Textbook Exercises, then the relevant file. 
 
Some Key lookup and reference functions: 
VLOOKUP 
Abbreviated from Vertical Lookup, in Excel, the VLOOKUP function searches for a value you specify 
in the left-most column of a table. If it finds a match, it returns the value in the same row, based 
on the column number you specify. Put simply it is asking for three things to fulfil the request: 
• 
What you are looking for? 
• 
What data set does it reside in? 
• 
What column contains the value you wish to return? 
The syntax for the VLOOKUP function is: 
VLOOKUP( value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup] ) 
value is the value to search for in the first column of your table. 
table_array is one or more columns of data that make up your data table. 
col_index_num is the column number in table_array from which the matching value must be 
returned. The first column is 1. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
29 
Lookup & Reference Functions 
[range_lookup] determines if you are looking for an exact match based on value. Enter FALSE to 
find an exact match. Enter TRUE to find an approximate match, which means that if an exact match 
is not found, then the VLOOKUP function will look for the next largest match that is less than what 
has been entered in the value argument. In most cases, and always when you are looking up a text 
value, you will enter FALSE here to find an exact match. 
 
Note: 
Excel will look vertically from top to bottom in order to find a 
match and therefore will always return a value based on the first 
match it encounters.  
The first column in your table array needs to contain the value 
you are looking for 
If index_number is less than 1, the VLOOKUP function will return 
#VALUE. 
If index_number is greater than the number of columns 
in table_array, the VLOOKUP function will return #REF! 
If you enter FALSE for the range_lookup parameter and no exact 
match is found, then the VLookup function will return #N/A. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file lookup_and_reference.xlsx 
2) Select the tab VLOOKUP 
3) In this exercise we have a list of IATA codes (Airport Abbreviations) and would like to know 
what Airport coincides with each code. 
4) In cell C4 enter =VLOOKUP(B4,G:I,2,FALSE) 
 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
30 
Lookup & Reference Functions 
5) This will return the value Beijing Capital International. Copy the function down the page to 
reveal the Airport Name associated with each IATA code. 
 
By using a table_array of G:I and not specifying a row number, 
Excel will look vertically from row 1 of column G all the way to 
row number 1048576! 
 
Following the syntax through 
• 
We were looking for the value in cell B4 
• 
In the table_array contained at cells G:I looking for a match of cell B4 in the leftmost 
column (G) 
• 
Then returning a value in col_index_num (column index number) 2, which translates as 
column H for our table array. 
• 
We were looking for an exact match of the value in cell B4 so we entered FALSE for the 
range_lookup argument. 
In a practical situation you may need to use a VLOOKUP on data 
on a separate workbook or worksheet, this can be tricky to 
navigate while mid-function therefore hold the Ctrl key and Page 
Up or Down key, to cycle up and down worksheets respectively. 
 
HLOOKUP 
Abbreviated from Horizontal Lookup, In Excel, the HLOOKUP function searches for value in the top 
row of table and returns the value in the same column based on the row number that you specify. 
It is less frequently used than VLOOKUP but useful to know. 
The syntax for the HLOOKUP function is: 
HLOOKUP( value, table_array, row_index_number, [range_lookup] ) 
value is the value to search for in the first row of the table. 
table_array is two or more rows of data that is sorted in ascending order. 
row_index_number is the row number in your table from which the matching value must be 
returned. The first row is 1. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
31 
Lookup & Reference Functions 
[range_lookup] determines if you are looking for an exact match based on value. Enter FALSE to 
find an exact match. Enter TRUE to find an approximate match, which means that if an exact match 
if not found, then the HLOOKUP function will look for the next largest value that is less than value. 
In most cases, and always when you are looking up a text value, you will enter FALSE here to find 
an exact match. 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file lookup_and_reference.xlsx 
2) Select the tab HLOOKUP 
3) In this exercise we have a list of IATA codes (Airport Abbreviations) and would like to know 
what Airport coincides with each code. Note that different to the VLOOKUP exercise, the 
data table is now arranged horizontally. 
4) In cell C4 enter =HLOOKUP(B4,$H$3:$AL$4,2,FALSE) 
5) This will return the value Beijing Capital International. Copy the function down the page to 
reveal the Airport Name associated with each IATA code. 
 
Note that we used absolute symbols ( $H$3:$AL$4 ) for our table 
array this time, so as not to change the table array reference as 
we copy the formula down the page. 
 
INDEX & MATCH 
When you deal with a high volume of data quite often you can find yourself with a value you need 
to lookup that is on the left of your lookup range and in which case the VLOOKUP function will not 
work (If you recall it will only ‘lookup’ the value to the right). 
 
In such a situation, you can use an INDEX with nested MATCH function combination to return the 
desired value. This combination will allow you to lookup a value in a table to the left of the column 
that contains your lookup value. This makes the formula a little complicated and in some 
circumstances, it may be easier to re-arrange your data table to suit a VLOOKUP however this is 
not always practical. 
 
Let’s first look at the functions involved. 
 
 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
32 
Lookup & Reference Functions 
INDEX 
The syntax for the INDEX function is: 
Index( array, Row_num, Col_num) 
array is a range of cells i.e. the table containing your lookup result 
row_num is the row number that you want to return a value from 
col_num is the column number that you wish to return a value from 
 
In a standard data table (with field names listed horizontally and data beneath), you can easily 
specify the column number you need that contains the end value you wish to return, but what 
about the row number? As this row number will vary depending on what you are searching for, this 
is where we would insert a nested function and this is where the MATCH function comes in to play. 
 
MATCH 
The syntax for the MATCH function is: 
MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, match_type) 
lookup_value is the value you want to search for usually a primary key i.e. a staff or customer 
number 
lookup_array is the range within which you want to find your lookup value 
match_type is a 1 or 0 value representing whether you want an exact match (0 = exact match) 
 
Combining the two (INDEX and MATCH), inserting the MATCH function where our row_num 
argument sits, our function can be laid out as follows.  
=Index( array, match( lookup_value, lookup_array, match_type), col_num) 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file lookup_and_reference.xlsx 
2) Select the tab INDEX & MATCH 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
33 
Lookup & Reference Functions 
3) In this example, we have a list of Airport IATA codes on the left hand side and data to the 
right. We want to return the Airport Name associated with each IATA code however we 
cannot use a VLOOKUP as the Airport Name field sits to the left of the IATA code in the 
data table. 
4) In cell C4 enter the following =INDEX($G$3:$K$33,MATCH(B4,$H$3:$H$33,0),1) 
 
5) In this example G3:K33 represents our array, B4 is our lookup value, H3:H33 is the column 
in the array containing our lookup value that we match to return the row number, 0 is 
entered to get an exact match, 1 is entered as the value we wish to return from the formula 
is contained in column 1. 
6) Copy the formula down the page and you will return the Airport Name for each of the IATA 
codes listed. 
 
NAMED RANGES 
 As your proficiency and confidence grows in Excel, you will begin to include more nested functions 
into your formulas and worksheets. As these grow in size and complexity you may find it difficult 
to trace your own work let alone pass it onto other users. One method of reducing this complexity 
in formulas is to make use of named ranges. 
Named ranges allow you to assign a name of your choosing to a cell or range of cells that may be 
more meaningful than say for example B2:F15. These names can then be substituted into formulas 
that you create.  
For example, instead of a formula such as =SUM(Sheet1!$B$2:$B$13) you could have simply 
=SUM(Expenses) 
 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
34 
Lookup & Reference Functions 
 
 
You can find everything to do with Named Ranges in the Defined Names group of the Formulas tab 
in the Ribbon. There are multiple ways to create a named range, we will address all of these. The 
first and quickest way is using the Name Box. You can find the name box just below in the top left 
of the standard Excel screen below the ribbon. It is circled in the figure below. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Select a range of cells and in the Name Box give it a name.  
2) You will then find that Named Range listed in the Name Manager. 
 
Note: You can only use letters of the alphabet, numbers and the 
underscore character ( _ ) in your named range. You also cannot 
begin your named range with a number. For Example, a named 
range called “2017” would not work however you could have 
“_2017” which would be acceptable.

Name Manager 
The Name Manager is where you will find all previously defined named ranges which you can edit 
or delete, from this window you can also create New named ranges. There is also a filter where you 
can see which named ranges are associated with the specific worksheet and those associated with 
the entire workbook, those assigned to defined tables and for error handling, ranges that contain 
errors. 
Define Name 
Define Name is another button in the Defined Name grouping that allows you to set a named range. 
Using this option or the New button in the Name Manager will bring up the following dialog box. 
FIGURE 17 NAME MANAGER BOX 
FIGURE 18 DEFINE NAME BOX 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
36 
Lookup & Reference Functions 
From this dialog box, you can enter an appropriate name that is easily memorable and logical, set 
the scope (whether it be for the whole workbook or worksheet), give optional comments and set 
the cell references it refers to. From the figure above you can see a named range titled Example is 
easier to type than Sheet1!$B$2:$B$13 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file lookup_and_reference.xlsx 
2) Select the tab NAME MANAGER 
3) Select cells C4:C13 
4) In the Excel Ribbon, Select Formulas and Name Manager 
5) Select New and give the range of cells the name “Expenses” 
 
6) In cell C15 enter =SUM(expenses) 
 
7) This will display the SUM of your named range.

Use in Formula 
The Use in Formula button allows you, once your named range 
has been set, to quickly drop your named range into a formula 
while typing it out.  
For example, in the figure to the side a SUM function has been 
started and instead of typing or selecting the cells you wish to 
sum you can simply select your predefined range from the 
dropdown. 
 
 
Create from Selection 
The Create from Selection button allows you to let Excel set a name for your range automatically 
from the cells you have selected. Excel will give you the option to create the name from the top 
row, left column, bottom row or right column of your selection. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file lookup_and_reference.xlsx 
2) Select the tab NAME MANAGER 
3) Select cells B3:B13 
4) Select Create from Selection 
 
5) Select OK

6) Enter the Name Manager to see your automatically named range. Note that spaces are 
denoted by underscores ( _ ) 
 
 
DYNAMIC NAMED RANGES (OFFSET) 
In the previous exercises concerning Named Ranges we managed to set a range quite easily that 
can be used in place of function arguments, to inform pivot tables or create lists for example data 
validation. The only drawback to the ranges we created are that they are fixed ranges. 
In such an example, over time when data is added outside your fixed named range it will obviously 
not be considered and you will need to manually amend your range. So how can it be made dynamic 
so that the range changes depending on how much data you have entered? One answer is to set a 
dynamic or variable range. This can be done using the OFFSET function.  
 
 
OFFSET 
The OFFSET function returns a reference to a range that is a given number of rows and columns 
from a given reference. So basically, what this means is we set a cell reference as a starting point 
and can then specify fixed or variable values to count up or down (in rows) or left or right (in 
columns) from that starting point to generate a range of cells. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
39 
Lookup & Reference Functions 
The syntax for the OFFSET function is: 
=Offset(reference, rows, cols, [height], [width]) 
 
reference is the starting point to which you want to offset, it can be a single or range of cells. 
Typically it would be the upper-left most cell in a list or table. 
rows is the number of rows, up or down, from the reference, that you want the upper-left cell of 
the result to refer to. If you entered the number 3 here for example the starting point would move 
downwards 3 rows, if you entered -2 it would move upwards 3 rows. 
cols is the number of columns, left or right, that you want the upper-left cell of the result to refer 
to. Similar to the previous argument, if you entered the number 4 here the starting point would 
move to the right 4 columns, if you entered -5 it would move to the left 5 columns. 
[height] and [width] represent how big the range you want to be in rows and columns respectively. 
 
If you think of selecting a range of cells with a mouse, typically 
you would left-click the mouse and drag over the range you 
wanted, so imagine with the previous arguments, we selected 
that initial cell with the mouse, now we need to define the size of 
our range of cells using values for height and width. For example, 
if we entered a height and width value of 7 and 9 respectively, 
then from my start point my cell range would include 7 rows 
down and 9 across. 
Example: 
Let’s say we want to create a list that will be used in a drop down list elsewhere on your 
spreadsheet. This would need to be a dynamic range. Using OFFSET we can define the range to 
change depending on how long it is (dynamically) by instead of setting a fixed height, replacing with 
a COUNTA function that will simply count the number of cells that contain a value or text. 
 
Therefore, to create a dynamic vertical list range, our formula would be as follows: 
=OFFSET( reference, rows, cols, COUNTA(range), width)

4) Select New 
5) Give the range the name “DynamicList” 
6) In the refers to box enter =OFFSET($B$3,0,0,COUNTA($B$3:$B$24),1) 
 
7) The Named Range will now change in length as more data is added making it dynamic. 
8) In this example $B$3 represents our starting position, 0 and 0 indicate we do not want to 
move any number of rows or columns from that start position, the COUNTA($B$3:$B$24) 
will count the number of cells not blank which allows us to set a variable height of our list 
and the 1 indicates it’s a 1 column list. 
 
Further things to try: 
Setting a drop-down list for your dynamic range. 
9) Select cell E2 
10) From the Data tab in the Ribbon, select Data Validation

LOGIC & MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS 
 
Logical functions are those that will ask a question of your data and return a result based on the 
answer to that question. They are therefore sometimes referred to as decision making functions. 
Nested functions are commonplace within formulas containing logic functions. 
In this chapter, we will be referring to the workbook titled logic_and_mathematical.xlsx 
As a reminder this workbook can be downloaded by visiting http://simplifiedexcel.blogspot.co.uk/ 
and selecting Textbook Exercises, then the relevant file. 
 
 
Some Key logic and mathematical functions: 
 
SUM 
The SUM function is probably the most commonly used function in Excel, so much so that it has its 
own default button in the Excel Ribbon.  
 
The syntax for the SUM function is: 
SUM( number1, [number2], ...) 
number1 is any numeric value, cell or cell range that contains a number 
[number2] and onward are optional arguments if you wanted to SUM additional cell ranges. 
Note: If your function refers to a cell that does not contain a 
number then it will be ignored from the calculation. 
FIGURE 19 AUTOSUM ICON 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
43 
Logic & Mathematical Functions 
The SUM function allows us to add together any numerical values in cells or range of cells specified. 
For example, if we typed into a cell =SUM(B2:B15) then the numerical contents of cells B2 to B15 
would be added together and the result displayed (provided they contained numbers.) 
 
Things to try: 
13) Open the file logic_and_mathematical.xlsx 
14) Select the tab SUM, SUMIFS 
15) In cell G6 enter =SUM(D6:D53) 
 
The total expenses in cells D6 to D53 will now be displayed. 
 
SUMIFS 
What if we wanted to only add up certain numbers that met some criteria? The SUMIFS function 
was introduced in Excel 2007 and is an improvement on the old SUMIF function. Note the addition 
of an ‘S’ to the end of the function. This function allows you to add together numerical values if 
criteria that you specify is met. 
The syntax for the SUMIFS function is: 
SUMIFS( sum_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2], [criteria2]…) 
sum_range is the actual cells to sum. 
criteria_range1 is the range of cells you want evaluated against your set criteria. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
44 
Logic & Mathematical Functions 
criteria1 is the condition or criteria that matches into criteria_range1 that determines which cells 
will be added. 
[criteria_range2] is an optional argument if you wanted further criteria for your sum. 
[criteria2] is an optional argument that matches into criteria_range2.  
A SUMIFS function must contain at least one criteria_range and one criteria, for each additional 
criteria_range you specify in the function you must also add another criteria. 
 
Note: With Excel 2007 the programmers decided to change the 
order of things if you are used to the original SumIf you will notice 
that the sum_range now comes before the criteria_range. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file logic_and_mathematical.xlsx 
2) Select the tab SUM, SUMIFS 
3) In cell G10 enter =SUMIFS(D6:D53,B6:B53,"Engineering") 
 
The total expenses for Engineering will now be displayed. This is a SUMIFS based on one criteria.

3) In cell G14 enter =SUMIFS(D6:D53,B6:B53,"Finance",C6:C53,"May") 
 
The total expenses for Finance in May will now be displayed. This is a SUMIFS based on two criteria. 
 
COUNT 
The COUNT function allows us to count the number of numerical cells, remember that this is not 
the same as adding together. It only counts the number of matches. 
The syntax for the COUNT function is: 
COUNT( value1, [value2], ...) 
value1 is any cell reference or range within which you wish to count. Only numeric values are 
counted. 
value2 and onward are optional arguments if you wanted to count multiple ranges of cells. 
 
For example, if we typed into a cell =COUNT(B2:B15) then the quantity of cells within B2 to B15 
that contained numbers would be displayed. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file logic_and_mathematical.xlsx

46 
Logic & Mathematical Functions 
2) Select the tab COUNT, COUNTIFS 
3) In cell G6 enter =COUNT(D6:D53) 
 
The total cells that contain numerical values will now be displayed. 
 
COUNTIFS 
Similar to SUMIFS is the COUNTIFS function. This function allows us to count the cells where a 
specified condition is met, for example if we wanted to count the number of cells where the 
numerical value is over 100 or count how many cells had text that matched a specified word. 
The syntax for the COUNTIFS function is: 
COUNTIFS( criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2], [criteria2]…) 
criteria_range1 is the range of cells you want evaluated against your set criteria. 
criteria1 is the condition or criteria that matches into criteria_range1 that determines which cells 
will be added. 
[criteria_range2] is an optional argument if you wanted further criteria for your count. 
[criteria2] is an optional argument that matches into criteria_range2.  
A COUNTIFS function must contain at least one criteria_range and criteria, for each additional 
criteria_range you specify in the function you must also add criteria. Note the absence of a 
sum_range which is not required.

The total cells in range B6 to B53 that match the value in F11 will now be displayed. In this case in 
cell F11 we have the entry “Estates”. Therefore, the number of cells containing the value “Estates” 
will be displayed.

This time we are counting cells in D6 to D53 where the value is greater than 30,000. Note that we 
are required to enter criteria in text format therefore we have used quotation marks. 
 
COUNTA 
The COUNTA function will count all cells in a range that are not blank.  
The syntax for the COUNTA function is: 
COUNTA( value1, [value2], ...) 
value1 is a value or cell that you wish to analyse for your count. 
value2 is an optional argument where you can add further cell ranges that you may wish to count.

COUNTBLANK 
This function allows us simply to count the cells in a cell range that are blank. 
The syntax for the COUNTBLANK function is: 
COUNTBLANK( range) 
range is the cell range that you wish to analyse.

IF 
If we wanted to perform a certain action in Excel when a condition was met, we could use the IF 
function. If the condition is not met, then we would need to specify an alternative action to 
perform. The IF function requires us to ask a question of data that must return an answer of TRUE 
or FALSE. Essentially it is similar to putting a decision tree into a formula. 
The syntax for the IF function is: 
If( condition, value_if_true, value_if_false ) 
condition is the value that you want to test. 
value_if_true is the value that is returned if condition evaluates to TRUE. 
value_if_false is the value that is return if condition evaluates to FALSE. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file logic_and_mathematical.xlsx 
2) Select the tab IF. In this tab we have a list of departments various expenses over different 
months. We also have a budget listed for each department by month which has been fixed 
at £30,000. Let’s say we wanted to ask the question “Is our department over budget?” Well 
there can only be two possible answers to this question. TRUE it is over budget or FALSE it 
is not over budget. We can display this in a formula

4) Copy and paste the formula down the page. 
For each row, the formula result will be either “Yes” or “No”.  
 
IFERROR 
IFERROR is a function introduced in Excel 2007 that simplifies the handling of functions that 
returned an error. 
The IFERROR function can be used to return an alternative value to common errors such as #DIV/0, 
#REF! or #N/A that your formulas may show up. 
The syntax for the IFERROR function is: 
 
IFERROR( value, value_if_error) 
value is your function or reference to a cell. 
value_if_error is the action you would like to perform or text you would like to display if an error 
would normally be returned. This can be a reference to a cell or an additional function. 
Let’s take a simple example.  
If we enter into a cell =IFERROR(10/0, “Error in calculation”) the result would be “Error in 
calculation” as opposed to a #DIV/0! Error (as you cannot divide by zero!) 
If we enter into a cell =IfError(10/ 2, “Error in calculation”) the result would be 5 (10 divided by 2) 
as there is no error in the formula or the result (10 can be divided by 2 with no problem).

2) Select the tab IFERROR 
3) In cell C4 enter =IFERROR(VLOOKUP(B4,G:H,2,FALSE),"NOT FOUND") 
 
4) Copy the formula down the page. 
What this function will do is apply the VLOOKUP function as normal, providing a match is found. If 
no match is found instead of returning the result #N/A! our function now instructs Excel to return 
he value “NOT FOUND”. 
 
ROUND 
Sometimes our formulas return a value that includes decimals when they are not wanted, we can 
superficially hide this using formatting options but that only hides the problem. Using the ROUND 
functions we can round our formula results to the nearest values that we specify. 
The syntax for the ROUND function is: 
 
ROUND( number, num_digits) 
number    is the number that you wish to round. 
num_digits    is the number of digits to which you wish to round your number. 
Note: If the num_digits value is greater than 0 the number will be 
rounded  to the specified number of decimal places. 
If the num_digits is 0, then the number is rounded to the nearest 
integer. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
53 
Logic & Mathematical Functions 
If the num_digits is less than 0, then the number is rounded to the 
left of the decimal. 
For example, the figure below illustrates the different results when using 0,1 and -1 as a value for 
num_digits.

ROUNDUP 
 
The ROUNDUP function will round upwards to the nearest whole number. 
The syntax for the ROUNDUP function is: 
 
ROUNDUP( number, num_digits) 
number    is the number that you wish to round.

Handling date and time values in Excel can be sometimes problematic. The key to mastering their 
understanding lies in understanding cell formats. Let’s say we want to enter the date 1st June into 
a cell. The format in which it is recognised will depend on how we enter the value.  
Example: 
Entering the "1st June" into an 
unformatted cell as… 
Will 
Display… 
Recognised Date 
format? 
1st June 
1st June 
No 
1st Jun 
1st Jun 
No 
1 Jun 
01-Jun 
Yes 
01/06 
01-Jun 
Yes 
01-06 
01-Jun 
Yes 
 
 You will notice, if the date value was entered in one of the recognised formats as above, Excel will 
recognize it as a date and auto-correct to, in this case, to display “01-06”. 
What you may also notice is the year is missing however Excel will always assume, if you have not 
specified a year, that you intended to enter the current year, so as this book was written in 2017, 
Excel will identify the year as 2017. As you can see in the figure below the cell only displays “01-
Jun” however in the formula bar, it is recognised as 01/06/17.

Date and Time Format Options 
The earlier example looked at how Excel recognises date and time values entered into cells but 
what if you would like to change how they are displayed?  
The format cells screen allows us to do this. Select the cells you want to format and then right click 
the mouse and select format cells.  
You will find more default date/time formats under the Custom category than you would in the 
Date or Time Categories. See the figure below. 
 
 
FIGURE 22 FORMAT CELLS BOX 
In this category you can however also select your own date/time format. 
 
Dates and Serial Numbers 
It is worth noting that each date value entered into Excel will translate to a serial number, rising 
sequentially each day from a start date of 01/01/1900.  

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
58 
Date & Time Functions 
This means that 01/01/1900 formatted as number, translates as the number 1. The date 
02/01/1900 translates as the number 2 and so on. 
 By the time we get to our example date of 01/06/17, then the number has risen to 42887 as it is 
42,887 days after 01/01/1900. 
 
Example:

Some Key Date and Time Functions: 
The first two we will look at are very straightforward and have no arguments within the brackets. 
TODAY 
Entering =TODAY() into a cell will give you today’s date formatted dd/mm/yyyy. 
NOW 
Entering =NOW() into a cell will give you the current date and time in the format dd/mm/yy hh:mm. 
 
Things to try: 
1. Enter =Today()+5 into a cell. This will give you the date in 5 days’ time.

Date & Time Functions 
Identifying the Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute or Second of a Date value 
A number of functions exist in Excel to pull out such information which will be displayed 
numerically.  The syntax for such functions is as follows where serial_number is a number that 
represents a date: 
 
YEAR(serial_number) 
MONTH(serial_number) 
DAY(serial_number) 
HOUR(serial_number) 
MINUTE(serial_number) 
SECOND(serial_number) 
 
Things to try: 
5) Open the file dateandtime.xlsx 
6) Select the tab YEARMONTHDAY 
7) Select cell F5 
8) Enter =Year(D5) 
 
9) Select cell G5 
10) Enter =Month(D5) 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
60 
Date & Time Functions 
 
 
11) Select cell H5 
12) Enter =Day(D5) 
 
 
A similar function to DAY is called WEEKDAY that allows you to identify the day of the week of a 
given date, presented as a serial number. 
 
WEEKDAY 
The WEEKDAY function will return a numerical value from 1 to 7. This value will translate to a day 
of the week. 
The syntax for the WEEKDAY function is: 
WEEKDAY(serial_number, [return_type]) 
serial_number a number that represents a date 
[return_type] an optional argument that allows you to specify how you count weekdays e.g.  
return type 1 specifies that Sunday is the first day of the week and Monday is the seventh day. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
61 
Date & Time Functions 
return type 2 specifies that Monday is the first day of the week and Sunday is the seventh day. 
If you leave this argument blank Excel will assume you return type 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
The figure below demonstrates all return type options: 
 
FIGURE 24 RETURN TYPE ARGUMENT OPTIONS 
Example: 
 
Entering =WEEKDAY(B4,1) into a cell will give you the value 5, because the 01/06/17 was a Thursday 
and therefore the fifth day of the week starting from a Sunday.

Date & Time Functions 
WEEKNUM 
The WEEKNUM function will return a numerical value from 1 to 52. This value will translate to a 
week of the year. 
The syntax for the WEEKNUM function is: 
weeknum( serial_number, [return_type]) 
serial_number a number that represents a date 
[return_type] an optional argument that allows you to specify how you count weeks e.g. 
return type 1 specifies that weeks begin on a Sunday and the first week of the year ends on the 
first Saturday of the year. 
return type 2 specifies that weeks begin on a Monday and the first week of the year ends on the 
first Sunday of the year. 
The figure below demonstrates the difference between using return type 1 and return type 2. Note 
that 02/01/17 was a Monday.  
Under return type 1 this is in 1st week of the year.

Entering =WEEKNUM(B2,1) into a cell in the above example will give you the value 22 as the 
01/06/17 is in the 22nd week of the year, counting from the 1st January 2017. 
 
DATEVALUE 
The DATEVALUE function will convert date entries that are formatted as text to a date serial 
number that Excel can recognise. For example the formula =DATEVALUE(“01/06/2017”) would 
return the value 42887 which is the earlier example serial number of 1st June 2017. 
The syntax for the DATEVALUE function is: 
DATEVALUE( date_text) 
Date_text any text or reference to a cell that contains text that represents a date. 
 
YEARFRAC 
YEARFRAC calculates the fraction of the year calculated by the difference between two specified 
dates, a start date and an end date. 
The syntax for the YEARFRAC function is: 
 
YEARFRAC( start_date, end_date, [basis]) 
start_date a value representing the start date 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
65 
Date & Time Functions 
end_date a value representing the end date 
[basis] an optional argument where you specify the type of day count to use.

1) Open the file dateandtime.xlsx 
2) Select the tab YEARFRAC 
3) Select cell J5 
4) Enter =YEARFRAC(D5,C2) 
 
 
The individuals age will now be revealed. 
 
A common problem that people try to solve in Excel is calculating the age of something in exact 
years, for example you wouldn’t tell someone your age as a fraction.  

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
66 
Date & Time Functions 
There are multiple methods to calculate this using a combination of functions, oddly there is no 
single function that does this. The easiest of them, using functions covered in this chapter and 
earlier in the book is using ROUNDDOWN and YEARFRAC. In the above example, if you instead 
entered into cell J5 the following =ROUNDDOWN(YEARFRAC(D5,C2),0) you would get the 
individuals age rounded down. 
 
DATE 
The DATE function will convert given values into a serial number that represents a date. 
The syntax for the DATE function is: 
 
DATE( year, month, day) 
year four digits that represent the year value, e.g. any value between 1900 and 9999. 
month two digits that represent the month from 1 to 12 (January to December) 
day a value representing the day of the month from 1 to 31 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file dateandtime.xlsx 
2) Select the tab DATE 
3) Select cell K5 
4) Enter =DATE(F5+J5,G5,H5) 
Here we are specifying the year, date and month but for the year argument we are adding on the 
individuals current age which we calculated in the earlier example.

Date & Time Functions 
EOMONTH 
Returns a value representing the end of the month a given number of months before or after a 
specified date. 
The syntax for the EOMONTH function is: 
 
EOMONTH( start_date, months) 
start_date a value or cell reference containing a value that represents a date 
months how many months before or after the earlier specified start date would you like to return 
the end of month value. For example, -1 would return the prior month’s end of month date, +1 
would return the following months end of month value, and 0 would return the specified current 
dates end of month value. 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file dateandtime.xlsx 
2) Select the tab EOMONTH 
3) Select cell L5 
4) Enter =EOMONTH(K5,-1) 
Here we are indicating the month we wish to analyse contained in cell K5 and then taking it 
back one month represented by the -1. This will return the value 30/09/16 as it is the end of 
the month before 21/10/16. 
 
 
 
NETWORKDAYS 
Returns the number of whole workdays between two specified dates. Workdays are in this case 
considered as weekdays and therefore weekends are excluded. 
The syntax for the NETWORKDAYS function is: 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
68 
Date & Time Functions 
NETWORKDAYS( start_date, end_date, [holidays]) 
start_date a value representing the start date 
end_date a value representing the end date 
[holidays] an optional argument where you can specify how many holidays e.g. bank holidays exist 
between the two dates. 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file dateandtime.xlsx 
2) Select the tab NETWORKDAYS 
3) Select cell C6 
4) Enter =NETWORKDAYS(C4,C5,B9:B11) 
 
You will be presented with the result 201 as there were 201 weekdays between the dates 05/06/15 
and 16/03/16 minus the holidays specified in cells B9:B11.

FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS 
 
In this chapter, we will be referring to the workbook titled financial.xlsx 
As a reminder this workbook can be downloaded by visiting http://simplifiedexcel.blogspot.co.uk/ 
and selecting Textbook Exercises, then the relevant file. 
 
In this chapter we will discuss some of the common Financial Functions in Excel. These generally 
concern calculating the return on an investment, the repayments on a loan or the implicit interest 
rate in that investment or loan. 
Many of these functions will involve consideration of the time value of money. Let’s take a 
hypothetical situation. If you had a choice on whether to receive £100,000 today or £100,000 in 5 
years’ time, logically you would always choose to receive it today because you could invest and 
receive a return in the 5 year term. Due to inflation, £100,000 will also not buy you as much goods 
and services in 5 years from now. 
This brings us onto the concept of Present Value, sometimes referred to as Discounted Value. 
Present Value is the current value of future cash flows at a specified percentage rate.  
For example, to calculate the present value of £100,000 in one year’s time at an interest rate of 
10% you would normally calculate the present value as follows: 100000 x (1/1.10). This would give 
you the result £90,909.09. 
The higher the interest rate over the term, the less the Present Value will be. Sounds complex but 
this can be calculated simply in an Excel function. 
 
Ensure with all finance calculations that you are consistent about 
the units of measurement. For example, if you are told the 
payments on a loan are monthly but are given an annual interest 
rate, you will need to divide the interest rate by 12. 
 
 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
70 
Financial Functions 
When working with financial functions, to comply with general 
conventions, outgoing payments are represented in formulas as 
negative values and incoming payments are represented as 
positive numbers. Therefore, an incoming loan received would be 
a positive value and repayments out for that loan would be 
negative. 
 
Some Key Financial Functions: 
 
PMT 
The PMT function calculates the fixed repayment of a loan such as a mortgage based on a fixed 
repayment amount and interest rate. Note that you need to be consistent on entering arguments 
depending on whether you are calculating a monthly or annual repayment or another schedule. 
This is best explained in the example below but first let’s look at the syntax. 
The syntax for the PMT function is: 
PMT( rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type]) 
rate is the interest rate. A 10% interest rate would be entered here as 10% or 0.1. Ensure that if 
you are calculating monthly payments the argument is divided by 12 months i.e. 0.1/12 
nper is the number of repayments of the loan or investment. Remember to be consistent with 
argument values i.e. whether the loan or investment repayments are monthly, annually or another. 
pv is the present value of your loan or investment. i.e. what is it worth now. 
[fv] is an optional argument and asks what balance you want to remain after the final payment has 
been made. If you ignore this argument then Excel assumes zero residual balance. 
[type] is another optional argument where we can specify if a repayment is made at the start or 
end of the periods in question. In this case, a value of 1 represents a payment at the start of the 
period and an entry of 0 represents payments at the end. 
Example: 
Let’s take a simple example, we borrow £100,000 over 10 years at a rate of 5% interest. What is 
the repayment per month?  
Our formula could be written as such =PMT(0.05/12,10*12,100000) 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
71 
Financial Functions 
In this example as we are calculating monthly repayments our rate or annual interest rate has been 
divided by 12 and this can be seen in our formula as 0.05/12. 
The nper or number of repayments is 10 years x 12 months represented in the formula as 10*12. 
The present value or pv of our loan is £100,000. This is entered as 100000. Note that we do not use 
commas so as not to confuse Excel. 
For the fv argument typically, loans are not made with residual balances so for this example we 
have ignored this argument and Excel will assume we did not want a residual balance. 
Regarding the type. In our example we will ignore this argument and Excel will assume a value of 0 
in this case which translates as payments being made at the end of a payment period as is typical 
with loans.  
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file Financial.xlsx 
2) Select the tab PMT 
3) The sheet details information about a loan of £15,000 borrowed at 6% annually for 10 
years. In cell C8 enter =PMT(C4,C5,C6,0,0) 
 
4) This will return the repayment that needs to be made if repaying annually.

3) The sheet details information about a loan of £15,000 borrowed at 6% annually for 10 
years. In cell C10 enter =PMT(C4/12,C5*12,C6,0,1) 
4) This will return the payment that needs to be made if repaying monthly. Note that in this 
exercise, as we are repaying monthly, we have divided the annual interest rate by 12 to get 
monthly rate and multiplied the no. of years by 12 to get the number of repayments. 
 
 
PV 
 
The PV function calculates the Present Value of a loan or investment, it will return the value of 
future payments at today’s prices taking into consideration the time value of money. 
 
The syntax for the PV function is: 
=PV( rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type]) 
rate is the interest rate per period. A 10% interest rate would be entered here as 10% or 0.1. Ensure 
that if you are calculating monthly payments the argument is divided by 12 months i.e. 0.1/12 
nper is the number of repayments of the loan or investment. Remember to be consistent with 
argument values i.e. whether the loan or investment repayments are monthly, annually or another. 
pmt is the fixed payment made each period. This cannot change, typically it includes the principal 
and an element of interest. 
fv is an optional argument and asks what balance you want to remain after the final payment has 
been made. If you ignore this argument then Excel assumes zero residual balance.

type an optional argument, a value of 1 represents payments are made at the start of the period, 
0 indicates payments at the end of a period.

FV 
FV is abbreviated from Future Value and will provide you with the future value of an investment 
based on fixed value payments and a fixed interest rate. In other words, if we invested a regular 
fixed payment at a fixed interest rate what would be the value at the end of the investment period. 
The syntax for the FV function is: 
FV( rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type]) 
rate is the interest rate per period. A 10% interest rate would be entered here as 10% or 0.1. Ensure 
that if you are calculating monthly payments the argument is divided by 12 months i.e. 0.1/12 
nper is the number of repayments of the loan or investment. Remember to be consistent with 
argument values i.e. whether the loan or investment repayments are monthly, annually or another. 
pmt is the fixed payment made each period. This cannot change, typically it includes the principal 
and an element of interest. 
[pv] is an optional argument and stands for Present Value. It is the value of all future payments in 
today’s prices. 
[type] is another optional argument where we can specify if a repayment is made at the start or 
end of the periods in question. In this case, a value of 1 represents a payment at the start of the 
period and an entry of 0 represents payments at the end.

4) In cell C11 enter =FV(C4,C5,C7,0,0). Note that this time as we are provided with annual 
figures and are making annual payments we do not need to adjust the values to monthly 
figures. 
 
5) This will return the Future Value of our investment at the end of 10 years, which is 
£81,939.67 
 
NPV 
Sometimes when you make an investment, the projected financial returns over time can seem 
lucrative. However, once you consider the decreasing value of money over time it may be worth a 
review. This is where we would use NPV. 
NPV is abbreviated from Net Present Value and will allow you to calculate the current worth of 
discounted future cash flows. It is an alternative to the PV function as it allows us to set variable 
cash flow values as opposed to fixed ones with PV. 
A positive NPV would be worthwhile from a purely financial point of view whereas a negative NPV 
would lose you money. 
 
The syntax for the NPV function is: 
NPV( rate, value1, [value2]…) 
rate represents the discount rate to apply in one period. 
value1 represents cash flow at the end of the first period.

Financial Functions 
[value2] and onward are optional arguments represents cash flow at the end of the second period, 
third period etc. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file financial.xlsx 
2) Select the tab named NPV 
3) In cell C16 enter =NPV(C4, C7:C13) 
 
4) The result is £11,153.38. As this value is greater than zero then the investment is financially 
viable.  
Note: In a practical situation many other factors including risk, 
political and resourcing may need to be considered in deciding 
whether an investment or project should go ahead. 
 
RATE 
The RATE function will return the interest rate of a loan an investment or loan based on a fixed 
repayment schedule. 
The syntax for the RATE function is: 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
78 
Financial Functions 
RATE( nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess]) 
nper is the number of repayments of the loan or investment. Remember to be consistent with 
argument values i.e. whether the loan or investment repayments are monthly, annually or another. 
pmt is the fixed payment made each period. This cannot change, typically it includes the principal 
and an element of interest. 
pv represents the present value of the loan or investment. For example, if you are calculating the 
rate implicit in a loan then the initial loan value would be entered here. 
[fv] is an optional argument where you can specify the future value of the loan at the end of the 
repayment period. If omitted, this is taken as 0. 
[type] an optional argument, a value of 1 represents payments are made at the start of the period, 
0 indicates payments at the end of a period. 
[guess] an optional argument, an estimate of what the rate will be. If left blank Excel will guess a 
rate of 10% or 0.1. 
Note: To calculate the rate, Excel will use an iterative process, 
that is trial and error, until it achieves the correct result 
 
Example: 
Let’s say we wanted to know the annual interest rate of a loan of £10,000, borrowed over 5 years 
where repayments were fixed at £200 per month and were paid at the end of each month. My 
formula would be: 
=RATE(5*12,-200,10000)*12 
This would give me the result of 7.42% 
 
Note: We used 5 x 12 to calculate the number of payment periods 
and also the function result was multiplied by 12 to give us the 
annual interest rate. Finally, the pmt argument is entered as a 
negative value to show money flowing out.

Formula Auditing 
FORMULA AUDITING 
FORMULA AUDITING 
It can be difficult sometimes when reviewing a spreadsheet filled with complex functions and even 
trickier when taking over a spreadsheet from a colleague who has long left your organisation. The 
formula auditing group can help with this. You will find it under the Formulas heading and contains 
the following: 
 
  
 
 
In this chapter, we will be referring to the workbook titled Formula Auditing.xlsx 
As a reminder this workbook can be downloaded by visiting http://simplifiedexcel.blogspot.co.uk/ 
and selecting Textbook Exercises, then the relevant file. 
 
TRACING PRECEDENTS & DEPENDENTS 
This merely refers to analysing a cell reference and establishing what cells or references are being 
relied upon to determine a cell value. 
 
Trace Precedents 
Precedents are cells that are referred to by a formula in another cell. 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file Formula Auditing.xlsx 
2) Select the tab VLOOKUP 
3) Select Cell H10 
4) Select the tab Formulas, then Trace Precedents from the Ribbon

5) You will notice the blue arrowed line and a dashed line leading to a table symbol such as 
this: 
 
 
 
The blue arrowed line, originating from cell G10 and pointing to cell H10 indicates that the value in 
cell H10 requires data from cell G10. Therefore, G10 is a precedent of cell H10. 
The dashed line leading to the table symbol indicates that the value in H10 requires data from 
another tab or worksheet.

SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
82 
Formula Auditing 
If the cell is linking to another worksheet you can evaluate what worksheets are being linked by 
selecting Data, navigate to the Connections group, Select Edit Links (greyed out if no current links 
exist) 
Trace Dependents 
Dependents are simply put, cells that rely on other cells to determine their result 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file Formula Auditing.xlsx 
2) Select the tab VLOOKUP 
3) Select Cell H10 
4) Select the tab Formulas, then Trace Dependents from the Ribbon 
 
FIGURE 28 CONNECTIONS OPTIONS

SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS

Formula Auditing 
5) Several blue lines will appear as shown in the above figure originating from cell H10 and 
pointing to cells C4:C11. This is because there is a VLOOKUP function in cells C4:C11 
referring to cells including H10. Therefore, cell H10 is a dependent of cells C4:C11. 
 
Remove Arrows 
The remove arrows button simply removes any dependent precedent arrows that may be currently 
showing on screen. 
 
Show Formulas 
Show Formulas is quite a handy tool that simply displays any formulas currently in use rather than 
the result of that formula. It can be particularly useful if you have received a spreadsheet from a 
third party and are trying to establish what cells may have dependencies. 
 
ERROR CHECKING 
The Error Checking button has a drop down giving three options 
1. Error Checking 
The Error Checking button will scan the current tab for errors similar to the method that 
spellchecker uses. Errors picked up will include types such as #NULL!, #DIV/0, #REF!, #N/A etc.  
When an error is found it will give you the option to get specific error help, evaluate the formula 
(see later section), ignore the error or edit. 
Note that Error Checking does not pick up Circular References and only searches one tab at a time. 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file Formula Auditing.xlsx 
2) Select the tab VLOOKUP 
3) Press the Error Checking Button 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
84 
Formula Auditing 
 
FIGURE 30 ERROR CHECKING WINDOW 
 
The error checker will pick up an error in cell C9, visually the cell is showing “#N/A” which translates 
in the Error Checking window as the value is not available. Basically the VLOOKUP cannot find what 
you are looking for and needs reviewing. 
 
2. Trace Error 
Continuing the example above. Selecting Trace Error will provide dependency and precedent lines 
displaying what the formula is linked to as below. 
 
FIGURE 31 TRACE ERROR RESULT 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
85 
Formula Auditing 
 
As our function is a VLOOKUP, we are trying to look for the value “CGA” within column G and you 
will notice that particular value is not present and therefore the cause of the error. 
 
3. Circular References 
Sometimes when you open a spreadsheet you may receive this dreaded message 
“There are one or more circular references where a formula refers to its own cell directly or 
indirectly…” 
 
FIGURE 32 CIRCULAR REFERENCE ERROR 
This is pretty self-explanatory; the key part is that you cannot have a formula refer to its own cell. 
 
It is tempting when receiving such messages to simply press “OK” and ignore the problem without 
even reading it, which I suspect a worrying number of individuals do. After all it does not necessarily 
interfere with your particular work. However, this can be potentially disastrous as obviously it could 
lead to significant and fundamental errors. 
Now if you take the following sheet for example, there is a circular reference in there but it can be 
tricky to spot immediately and for more complex spreadsheets, even trickier.  

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
86 
Formula Auditing 
 
It would probably be easier if when opening the file Excel told you exactly where the circular 
references exist, but it doesn’t currently.  
Things to try: 
1) Open the file Formula Auditing.xlsx 
2) Select the tab VLOOKUP 
3) From the Ribbon select Error Checking Drop Down button 
4) Select Circular References, and if you didn’t spot it immediately you will notice the error 
was situated in cell H13. 
 
 
 
EVALUATE FORMULA 
When you have a particularly complex formula, the Evaluate Formula button allows you to 
essentially step-into each element, identify the values being returned and assess the logic being 
applied to help you understand. 
Things to try: 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
87 
Formula Auditing 
1) Open the file Formula Auditing.xlsx 
2) Select the tab EXPENSES 
3) In this example we have a summary of expenses and in Row 14 you will see an IF statement 
with a nested OR function. This formula is to establish whether we may want to take 
remedial action if the budget is over or under by a particular value. In this case 150 and -
150 respectively. 
4) Select cell C14 
5) From the function tab in the Ribbon, select Evaluate Formula 
6) From this screen you can drill down into each element of the function in order from left to 
right. In this example, the first and current cell reference that you can evaluate is C13 and 
is underlined to identify it as such. 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
88 
Formula Auditing 
7) If you press the Evaluate button here, Excel will tell you what value C13 returns, in this case 
it returns the value 196. 
 
8) Now you will notice the underline has extended to 196<-150 with a notification that the 
196 in italics is the most recently evaluated result.  
9) If we press Evaluate again, Excel will return the value FALSE as we know 196 is not less than 
-150.  
 
 
10) Excel moves onto the next cell reference, in this case a reference to cell C13.  
11) Now if we decided we are ok with the value that C13 returns but instead want to know 
how it was calculated, then we can press the Step In key. 
FIGURE 33 EVALUATE FORMULA WINDOW 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
89 
Formula Auditing 
 
 
12) As you can see Excel effectively drills further into the formula trail and explains that C13 
actually is a result of C12-C11. The cycle starts again from cell C12 and if we Step In once 
again Excel will tell us that C12 refers to a fixed value of 4500. 
 
 
13) Pressing the Step Out key will return you to the function above and the cycle will continue 
from where it left.

Watch Window 
Continuing with the same worksheet, if we wanted to check what effect a change we made to a 
spreadsheet had on a particular cell, we could use the Watch Window. This essentially provides 
details of a ‘watched’ cell such as where it is located and what formula it contains, that you can 
observe as you type.  
The Watch Window will always sit at the forefront of your windowed screen so that it can easily be 
seen and multiple cells can be watched at once simply by selecting all required. It is particularly 
useful if you are amending cells on tabs that may impact cells elsewhere as you will not need to 
repeatedly scroll or navigate to other areas of your worksheet. 
 
Things to try: 
1) Open the file Formula Auditing.xlsx 
2) Select the tab EXPENSES 
3) Select the Watch Window button 
4) Next select Add Watch 
 
 
 
FIGURE 34 WATCH WINDOW 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS

Formula Auditing 
 
5) Select cell C13 and press Add 
 
6) You will notice that the cell C13 that we are watching is located in file Formula Auditing.xlsx, 
on sheet Expenses, currently has the value 196 and the formula that drives it is =+C12-C11. 
 
Common Mistakes 
• 
Ensure all functions begin with an equal sign “=” 
• 
For each bracket that is opened “ ( ” ensure there is a closing bracket “ ) ” 
• 
Ensure all function arguments and the correct type of argument have been entered. 
• 
It is common to forget an argument or enter too many, check the placement of commas 
that separate each argument. 
 
• 
Some functions will require numerical arguments and others require text based arguments. 
For example, the SUM function has only numerical arguments. FIND and REPLACE 
functions require text. 
• 
Check references to other tabs or workbooks. If your formula refers to a cell in another tab, 
you must enclose the name of that tab in single quotation marks ( ‘ ) and then use an 
exclamation mark ( ! ), for example, if I was referring to cell B2 in Sheet 1 we would use the 
formula as follows: 
=’Sheet 1’!B2 

 
SIMPLE EXCEL: FUNCTIONS 
 
 
92 
Formula Auditing 
When you refer to another workbook you will also need to include the file path and file name 
within the single quotation marks. Additionally, the file name will itself need to be enclosed 
inside square brackets [ ] for example if I was referring to cell B2 in Sheet 1 of a file called Book 
1.xlsx then my formula would read as follows:  
=’C:\My Documents\[Book 1.xlsx]Sheet 1’!B2 
 
CELL ERROR MESSAGES AND WHAT THEY MEAN 
Errors and what they mean 
#NAME? 
Check formula spellings e.g. =SUMOF(C4:D4)? This error is displayed when the 
function name is not recognised or the range name within the function does not 
exist. 
#N/A 
Result you are seeking does not exist. For example if you are using a VLOOKUP to 
search for a value that does not exist in the first column of your table array. 
#NUM! 
This can occur if the formula result is a number that is too large or small. For example 
enter into a cell  45^34343534534 
#REF! 
Cell being referenced does not exist. This can occur when a cell is being referenced 
on another tab that has since been deleted. 
#VALUE! 
This error will occur if you enter the wrong type of argument or operator. For 
example if you tried to sum together a number with a text value. 
#DIV/0 
Displays when part of the formula is attempting to divide by zero or an empty cell 
reference which is not possible. 
####### 
Will generally display if the column width is not wide enough to display the result, 
widen the column to correct. The other possibility is the formula result refers to a 
negative date value.
