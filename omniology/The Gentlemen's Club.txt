There were three men in the original
Gentlemen’s Club class who were
married. Not long after the classes were
complete, I received phone calls from
the women who were married to these
guys. Each one of them said, “Thank you
so much for doing these classes. I’ve got
back the man that I fell in love with.”

About the Author

Foreword
The Gentlemen’s Club is based on a
series of twelve teleclasses I facilitated
with 
a 
group 
of 
awesome 
and
courageous men. My intention with The
Gentlemen’s Club classes was to create
a 
males-only 
environment 
where
participants could speak freely about
being a man in this reality. There is a lot
of energy in these conversations. Female
readers may flinch at some of our “men’s
club” language, but I am hoping they’ll

come away from the book with a deeper
appreciation for the men in their lives
and a greater recognition of what it takes
to create a relationship from a totally
different reality.
In the discussions that follow, there
may be some words, concepts, and tools
you have never encountered before.
There may also be some common words
like be, human, or receiving that we use
in ways that seem unfamiliar. We have
tried to define them all in a glossary at
the end of the book.
You will also find the clearing
statement 
we 
use 
in 
Access
Consciousness®. It’s short-speak that

addresses the energies that are creating
the limitations and contractions in your
life. When you first read it, it may twist
your head around a little bit. That’s our
intention. It’s designed to get your mind
out of the picture so you can get to the
energy of a situation.
With the clearing statement, we’re
addressing the energy of the limitations
and barriers that keep us from moving
forward and expanding into all of the
spaces that we would like to go.
The Access Consciousness Clearing
Statement is “Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD and POC, All 9, Shorts,
Boys and Beyonds”®. There is a brief

explanation of what the words mean at
the end of the book.
You can choose to use the clearing
statement or not; I don’t have a point of
view about that, but I do want to invite
you to try it and see what happens.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
1
Stepping Up to
Something
Different
Do you want to function from trying to
change things
so they look different?
Or do you want to do something
different that will work for you?

Gary:
Welcome to The Gentlemen’s Club.
Let’s start with a question.
Trusting Yourself as a
Man/Trusting Other Men
Class Participant:
I’m starting a men’s empowerment
group, but the take-up by men is very
slow. Do you have any suggestions for
me?
Gary:
Don’t call it “men’s empowerment.”
Men supposedly have all the power. In
truth, they are totally disempowered—

but they don’t know that. If you call it
“empowerment,” nobody’s going to
come because they don’t even know they
need or want empowerment. Call it
“Making Your Life with Women Easier.”
Dain:
Men want their life with women to be
easier more than they want to be
empowered and more than they want to
be connected with other men. Most of
the things most men do are about trying
to get a woman or get laid. For most
men, the idea of meeting together with
other men is a place of too much
potency. It scares them off.

A few years ago, we did an Access
Consciousness Level Two and Three
class in Santa Barbara. Some of the
Access Consciousness ladies went out
that night and they saw two guys get in a
fight. The ladies said, “You know what?
It was obvious that what those guys
really wanted was to have sex with each
other, but they couldn’t have that in their
worlds, so they got into a fight instead.
The fight was their way of expressing
it.”
When you talk to men about getting
men together as men, it brings up all the
stuff they’re not supposed to be, not
supposed to do, and especially not

supposed to be and do together.
It’s been very interesting to hear the
feedback from the ladies on The Salon
des Femmes calls. After two calls, they
were saying things like, “I thought
listening to a bunch of women and not
having any men to play with or flirt with
was going to suck, but now I feel like
I’ve got all these sisters, and it’s
amazing how much more of me I have
and how much more connected I feel
with women and myself.”
I realized, in hearing that feedback,
that we as men have the same thing. We
create a separation from each other
rather than coming together. If we could

change that, we could truly change the
word. And we’d also have better sex,
we’d be the potency of us, and we’d
have a lot more fun.
Gary:
I’ve got a process:
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, and men
and men are you choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.

Class Participant:
In that process, you asked, “are you
choosing?” I tend to say, “that you are
choosing.” I realize you don’t say that.
Can you tell me why?
Gary:
“That you are choosing” justifies your
reason for choosing. It’s a fixed point of
view. It is saying, “I am choosing this
because ____.” You would prefer to
believe you are choosing for a reason
rather than just choosing. I am trying to
get you to see that there is no reason for
what you choose—you just choose.
That’s why I ask, “Are you choosing?”

Class Participant:
Thank you.
Creating Partnership with
Men
Class Participant:
Can you talk about the separation I
create with other men?
Gary:
The one thing you’re not supposed to
do is have sexual energy with other men.
That’s like a big no-no. So you do
whatever you have to do in order to not
have sexual energy with other men. Yet
just about everything in sexual energy is

about receiving. Without sexual energy,
you have no receiving. So when we cut
ourselves off from receiving sexual
energy with other men, we also cut off
our 
receiving 
from 
women, 
from
relationship, and from sex. We cut
ourselves off from receiving with money
and business and everything else.
If you can have men with men, then
you have a place where you can create a
partnership, which can create money, or
you can create a partnership, which
creates fun or all kinds of things. For
example, Dain and I spend the majority
of our time together. We are willing to
be there as men for our friends. I

encourage Dain to go out and have sex
with different women, I encourage him
to do whatever he wants, but he is my
friend and he has my back. If you create
a separation of men from men, you can’t
ever assume that a man will have your
back.
Dain:
You assume that men will stab you in
the back. But most of the time, it’s not
going be the man in your life who stabs
you in the back.
Class Participants:
(Laughter)
Gary:

Women don’t stab you in the back.
They just cut off your testicles!
Dain:
When men buy the idea that sexual
energy isn’t supposed to be there
between them, they cut themselves off
from the nurturing and the caring, the
expansive, generative, creative, and
healing energy they have with other men.
Gary:
The “I’ve got your back” energy.
Dain:
You also cut off yourself off from
having that energy for yourself and with
yourself.

Gary:
You are a man and you have to
separate from you. So you can’t have
your own back. And that’s why so many
of you give yourselves away, especially
to women.
Dain:
So many of you are thinking, “Oh,
maybe I can find the woman who will
finally complete me, who will fill this
void I’m not filling for myself.” You,
separating from yourself, is part of the
separation of men from men.
We tend to look at it as though the men
we’re separating from are outside of us,

but you have to separate from you in
order to make the separation from other
men real.
Gary:
The question I have is: Do you trust
you as a man?
Dain:
And the answer is “Hell no!”
Class Participant:
The answer is “No.”
Gary:
If you can’t have your own back,
where do you find someone who will
have your back? You can’t let a man

have your back, so who can have your
back?
Dain:
You think that if a man has your back,
you won’t know what he might do when
he’s back there; you won’t let him have
your back because he could get you in
the balls.
Gary:
It’s insanity.
Dain:
It’s total insanity. When you allow
yourself those rare moments of closeness
with a man without having a point a
view about it, it opens up your world so

dynamically.
Gary:
It’s an amazing gift and an amazing
possibility.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, and men
and men you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Gary:

What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, and men
and men you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Hey Dain, do you know how they
separate the men from the boys in
Greece?
Dain:
With a crowbar!
Gary:

Just thought we should interject a sick
joke to keep you guys on your toes.
Okay, let’s run that again.
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, and men
and men you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Hold on. We have to add “men and
boys” to that process. Some weird
energy came up after we told that joke,
and I realized we try to create separation

between men and boys. Men are being
mentors to boys without ever having the
boy’s back.
Dain:
We grow up with the idea that we’re
alone. We believe that not only are we
bad and wrong; we’re not even worthy
of someone having our back.
Gary:
We don’t even think we’re worthy of
having our own back, which is why I
think men don’t trust themselves.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and

women, women and women, and men
and men, and men and boys you are
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Cutting Off Your Sense of
Beauty
Gary:
You know, we might as well add “men
and girls” to that process, as well. I’ve
noticed that if an adult male sees a young
girl and he has an ounce of sexual
energy, he has to go into judgment of

himself for being some kind of pervert
or a terrible person or someone who
wants to have sex with children, none of
which is necessarily true.
If I see a beautiful horse, for me it’s a
horse. I see a beautiful horse and it’s a
turn-on! Seeing the beautiful horse move
is all I care about. I don’t have to do
anything with it. I don’t have to own it. I
don’t have to have a place where I can
control it. I just recognize that the horse
is beautiful.
Men cut off their sense of beauty
because they are afraid that it’s a sexual
energy and that “means” something.

Dain:
When you, as a “straight” man, have
this sense of beauty, you think it means
you’re somehow gay or soft.
Gary:
It’s called “metrosexual.”
Dain:
Exactly. Metrosexual is where you can
have all of the good stuff of gay men and
all of the good stuff of straight men
combined: metrosexual.
Gary:
Yeah.
Class Participants:

(Laughter)
Dain:
What was that?
Gary:
Somebody was laughing because
we’re funny.
Dain:
Oh, I haven’t heard that sound in a
while. That’s why I didn’t know what it
was.
Class Participants:
(Laughter)
Gary:
You’ve been talking to women too

much!
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, men and
men, men and boys, and men and girls
you are choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
Good lord. The amount of charge on
that is just unbelievable!

“We’ve Got Each Other’s
Back”
Dain:
I was having dinner with our friend
Ricky the other night. It was the first
time he and I had ever had any one-on-
one time together. I was telling him
about the friendship I have with Gary. I
said, “We’ve got each other’s back, but
that wasn’t apparent at day one. Our
friendship has developed over time. We
have created a level of trust by being us,
choosing that which would support the
other, and having the other’s back.”
I said, “When I first got to know Gary,

I gave him all kinds of information he
could have used to skewer me and stab
me in the back, but he didn’t take it that
way. And he gave me all kinds of stuff I
could have used against him too, but I
didn’t do that. It was ‘How can we
contribute to each other and support each
other?’ We’d been hanging out, having an
amazing friendship for about a year, and
one day he came over and said, ‘Our
friendship is done.’”
I asked, “What are you talking about?”
Gary said, “You’ve been judging me.
You’ve been judging me really harshly.
The rest of the world can judge me.
That’s fine, but I don’t give my friends

permission 
to 
judge 
me, 
so 
our
friendship is over. You can keep
working for Access Consciousness, but
our friendship is finished as of now. I
don’t want to be your friend anymore. It
does not work for me.”
I was like “Whoa!” When he said,
“You’re judging me,” in my mind I
literally went to “Well yeah, of course!
Isn’t that what friends do?” This was my
point of view.
Gary:
That’s what lovers do, not friends.
Dain:
He left and I felt a void in my life and

my world. I said, “Wait a minute. There
has never been a time when Gary hasn’t
had my back, and I’m judging him? This
is fucked. Even if he goes away, I need
to change this for myself.”
I called him and I said, “Gary, you are
absolutely right, and I’m really sorry. I
want to change this, but I don’t know
how. I don’t know what to do about it, so
I’m asking for your help. I will pay for a
session if I have to, but will you please
help me get through this?”
Gary said, “Okay, I’ll give you an
hour, and we’ll see where we go from
there.” It took forty-five minutes for me
to realize that I was choosing to judge

him. It felt like shoving my head through
a brick wall to realize that I was
choosing to do this, because it felt so
automatic.
When I finally got that, it changed my
whole world and my whole reality. I
saw that my judgment was that if he
cared about me as much as he did, it was
because he was interested in having sex
with me. He was gay and just wanted
sex. He just wanted to get me in bed.
That was the underlying thing holding in
place the mountains of judgment I had
erected against my friend.
Is it possible that you won’t allow
yourself to have a friendship with a

man, because somewhere in your
universe, you have concluded and
judged that only a man who wanted to
have sex with you would be kind and
caring 
and 
look 
out 
for 
you?
Everything that brought up times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
I was working with somebody the
other day. I always had the sense that he
had been molested, but he would never
say it. In the session, I asked him
something, and it came up that there had

been a soccer coach he felt had molested
him.
I asked him, “What do you mean?
What did the coach do?”
He said, “Well, he used to rub my
shoulders. He said he was trying to take
the knots out.”
I asked, “Did your coach have any
sexual energy when he did that?”
He said, “Yeah!”
I asked, “Did he have sexual energy
toward you?”
He said, “Yeah.”
This guy didn’t have a sexual
experience with his coach. The coach

was trying to help him. He had a sense
of loving and caring for the kid, and the
kid interpreted it as sexual desire, so he
cut off his awareness of a man who gave
off that kind of energy. He concluded it
was about sex, and as a result, he felt
violated.
Every place you have felt violated
when some man actually saw you as a
really cute kid or as somebody who
was so adorable he could hardly stand
it, or who didn’t feel that he had to
shut down his sexual energy around
you and you rejected him and rejected
yourself and went into the wrongness
of it and it created some kind of

separation of you from you, or of you
from him, or of you from men, or of
you from men and boys, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Apparently some of you have had
similar experiences. Did any of you have
an experience like that, where somebody
who was a “male” actually felt sexual to
you, and you felt like you were being
violated or that he wanted something
from you that you couldn’t or wouldn’t
deliver?
Everything that brings up times a

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it, please? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
The Kindness Men Have
Class Participant:
As I was growing up, I couldn’t find
the kindness men have. When I met you
and Dain and a lot of the guys in Access
Consciousness, it was like “Oh! This is
it. This is what I was looking for!” I
wouldn’t let myself see it when I was
younger.
Gary:

What happened when you were
younger that you didn’t want to know
about that created a place where you had
to separate from you and other men in
order to have a sense you could find the
kindness you knew ought to exist?
Class Participant:
I saw how the men around me were
acting. I saw what my grandfather did
with my sisters and what my dad did
with my mother, and I decided, “If that’s
what being a man is, I don’t want to be
it.”
Gary:
Everything you decided you didn’t

want to be, because you didn’t see
kindness there and because what you
saw was pain and suffering and hurt
and wrongness and meanness, will
you destroy and uncreate all of that
and claim you? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
Another part of that was coming up
while you were talking. How much were
you aware of your mom’s dislike or
hatred of men, your sister’s dislike or
hatred of men, and your grandmother’s
dislike or hatred of men?

Gary:
Well, it wouldn’t even be hatred. It
would be total distrust.
Dain:
Okay, cool. Total distrust, which is
exactly what we walk around with for
ourselves.
Gary:
Yeah, that’s what you end up doing.
You can’t trust that women are going to
trust men. You don’t see any terms of
trust from women to men, you don’t see
any terms of trust from men to men, so
the end result is—you can’t trust you,
because you’re a man.

Dain:
The thing that’s so twisted about this
is that you’re picking it up out of a
woman’s world, and you never spot that.
It’s there underneath everything else,
eating at you all the time. It didn’t come
from a man and it didn’t come from you.
It was something you were supposed to
uphold as a point of view. You were not
supposed to be like the men the women
didn’t trust. Does that make sense?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
Women don’t trust themselves either.

They are seldom good at doing hate, but
they are good at doing distrust, and they
will do hateful and mean things in the
name of empowerment and in the name
of gaining power, because they feel
powerless in the face of a total lack of
honoring and a total lack of trust.
Everything that brought up or let
down, can we destroy and uncreate all
of that, please? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
There’s a lot of stuff on not trusting
yourself as a man, and not trusting other

men, either. You get the projected lack of
trust from mothers, sisters, aunts, and all
females because they see what they have
come to define as true: they can’t trust
men. The reality is, they don’t trust
themselves and they don’t trust men. You
don’t trust yourself and you don’t trust
men either, so how much caring for you
can you actually have?
None. And what little caring there may
be is eroded away by mistrust, so you
can’t have any caring for you. You can’t
have your own back. You have to
separate from you at all times. And you
don’t see other men who are caring.
As you grow up and you’d really like

to have sex, you see that the guys women
are attracted to are the assholes of the
world and you say, “Wait a minute. This
is so frigging confusing.” You have no
way of perceiving the energy of the
caring and the potency you are. You
don’t even have a clue that it’s a good
thing to head toward what’s true for you.
Gary:
So many women have a distrust of
themselves and their choice of men. All
they can do is choose a man who is
equally distrustful. Some of you have
chosen mates who have that kind of
distrust because it fits your own
vibration and your own entrainment to

the lack of trust you feel for yourself.
Dain:
You pick women who see you a
certain way and you think you are that
way. You think you’re unworthy of being
trusted, and you buy the lie that that’s
who you are. But you’re not. Not one of
you is like that.
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, men and
men, men and boys, and men and girls
you are choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Creating Separation
Class Participant:
I don’t sense that I have a problem
receiving sexual energy from a man, but
I do sense that I’m creating separation in
general. I’m creating the separation as if
I have a problem with a man’s sexual
energy.
Gary:
Do you actually receive the energy
from a man? Or do you receive the point
of view about yourself that you have an

open mind?
Class Participant:
Yeah, that.
Gary:
Everything you’ve done to create an
open point of view that eliminates
you, will you destroy and uncreate all
of that? Right and Wrong, Good and
Bad, POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Is that creating separation?
Gary:
Your reason and justification for

creating separation is “Yes, but I have an
open mind.” A lot of people say, “Yes,
but I have an open mind.”
“But I have an open mind” is the lie
you tell yourself to keep you functioning
in the separation you have created. You
buy the idea that an open mind is all it
takes to overcome the separation rather
than an awareness of what could truly be
different.
Class Participant:
Yeah. Wow.
Gary:
How much have you used your open
mind as a justification for creating

separation while pretending you are
not doing that? A lot? A little? Or
megatons? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, men and
men, men and boys, and men and girls
you are choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I’d like to change that. I’d like to
create something else, be something
else, and do something else—and I’m
totally lost in how to do that.
Gary:
Well, you’ve not seen an example of
how to be present as you and enjoy you,
have you?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
Have you thought that judging you was

enjoying you?
Class Participant:
Yes, that may be the only way I can
enjoy me.
Gary:
The only way to enjoy you is to judge
you out of the wrongness of you so you
can enjoy how you’re right. That doesn’t
expand your universe in any way, so
there’s something wrong with that point
of view.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, men and

men, men and boys, and men and girls
you are choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Sexual Energy and
Receiving
Gary:
Let’s add another one to that: “And
you from you.”
What creates the sense of sexualness?
It’s the sense of receiving. If you have a
man like Dain who can receive you
totally and who has no judgment of you,

you are being received. This is the same
sexual energy you’d like to get from a
woman, but I would be willing to bet
money that you reject Dain’s sexual
energy the same way you reject women’s
sexual energy. It’s about how you’re not
willing to receive everything you’re
capable of receiving for, to, with, and by
you.
Everything that brought up, and
everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Do you have any idea what I said?

Class Participant:
I’m a little lost here.
Gary:
That’s the problem. Do you realize
how often you’ve been lost about
relationships with men?
Class Participant:
Yeah, and women.
Gary:
Yeah. You get lost with women, but
it’s okay to get lost with a woman
because you are still sexually excited by
her.
Class Participant:

Yeah, absolutely.
Gary:
But if you get lost with a man, it’s
because the man is x, y, or z, which isn’t
anything except a judgment.
Class Participant:
Yeah, I can sense that I’m keeping a
comfortable distance, so I guess I’m
cutting off receiving. I don’t know why,
but I do that.
Gary:
You’re cutting off anything that doesn’t
fit the prescribed pattern of willingness
to receive.
Class Participant:

I could easily say that I have never
had a role model in my life who has
done anything different, so I can claim,
“Oh, I didn’t know blah, blah, blah,” but
I don’t want it to be like this. I want to
choose something else. I just feel lost.
Gary:
That’s the reason we’re doing this
call. That’s the reason that we’re doing
this process. Let’s do it again, Dr. Dain.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the separation of men and
women, women and women, men and
men, men and boys, men and girls, and

you from you are you choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Choosing Something
Different
Class Participant:
When I see myself creating that
separation, is it appropriate to ask what
to do, how to be, and how to create
something different? When I end up in
the energy of separation, I step away and
withdraw my energy. I withdraw myself,

actually.
Gary:
You have to ask: An infinite being
would choose this for what reason? You
have to get that you choose to withdraw.
It’s always a choice, and if you’re going
to change it, you’ve got to say, “Okay
I’m choosing this, and I would choose
this for what reason?” Then you say,
“I’m going to choose different no matter
what it looks like.”
Class Participant:
I’ve been trying to do something
different, but I don’t end up with any
change, and then I feel even more

stupid...
Gary:
What would it be like if you were
willing 
to 
recognize 
that 
doing
something different only requires you to
look at what you would choose? You
don’t even have to choose it.
Class Participant:
Look at what you would choose and
not choose it?
Gary:
Yeah. Let’s say you got mad at your
girlfriend, and you said, “You know
what? I want to do something different.
What would be different from getting

mad?”
You might say, “Let’s see, getting even
would be a choice, yelling at her would
be a choice, loving her would be a
choice,” and as you did that, you’d begin
to see you have multiple choices, not just
one.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
You’re looking for what will solve the
problem you’ve defined as the fact that
you withdraw. That’s too complicated.
The simple fact is you withdraw. That’s
the sum total of it. There’s nothing else.

So you say, “I’d like to do something
different. What would not withdrawing
look like? Wow, that would be like
staying here, being here, and doing
whatever it takes.”
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
Do you get what I’m talking about?
Class Participant:
Yeah, this helps a lot.
Gary:
Cool. Choosing not to withdraw opens
doors to other choices. Ask: What other

choice do I have here? If I’m not going
to choose this, what other choices do I
have? If you start functioning from what
other 
choices 
you 
have, 
other
possibilities can occur.
Class Participant:
Yeah, absolutely.
Gary:
Everybody’s always trying to get me
to show them how to create a solution
and I keep saying, “All you have to do is
choose.”
They say, “Yes, but I can’t.”
Why not? Because you keep looking at
what’s wrong or how you have to fix

what’s wrong in order to choose
something different. No. Just recognize,
“This isn’t working.” And then ask:
“What can I do different?”
Class Participant:
I get that. I see that I was asking for
some sort of solution. This helps a lot.
Gary:
If I don’t choose that, what other
choices do I have?
Class Participant:
Yeah, that is awesome.
Gary:
That’s how you get out of doing the

same thing over again, thinking you’re
going to get a different result.
Change vs. Different
Class Participant:
I’ve been totally lost there, and I had
no clue how to change it.
Gary:
“I’ve had no clue how to change it” is
one of the places where you’ve been
trained and entrained to. It’s a woman’s
point of view. “I have to have a
problem. Now I have to change it” not “I
have to do something different.”
Class Participant:

That’s exactly what I’ve been doing.
Gary:
The question is not, “How can I
change this?” or “What can I do different
in order to change this?” That’s asking
about change. It’s: What can I do
different here?
You have to be willing to do and be
different, 
not 
differently. 
Doing
something differently is still trying to
change it. You have to be willing to be
or do whatever it takes to be different
enough to get what you’re asking for.
Class Participant:
Thanks a lot.

Class Participant:
I’m not getting the difference between
change and different.
Gary:
Right now, change your position in the
chair.
Class Participant:
Okay.
Gary:
Now do something different. Would
you still stay in the chair or would you
do something different?
Class Participant:
Oh, I see!

Gary:
Change is about sticking with what
you’ve got and adding something to it or
subtracting something from it or moving
it a different way—but staying where
you are.
Class Participant:
That’s not actually doing something
different then, is it? You’re just having
the same old, same old.
Gary:
Exactly. That’s the reason, when you
go to change something, you lose choice.
But if you do something different, you
have more choice. Women often say to

the men they’re in relationship with, “We
need to change this.” What that means is
not “You need to do something different”
but “You need to adjust you to fit where I
want you to be.”
Class Participant:
That’s what I’ve been doing with my
relationship. I’ve been asking her to
change rather than for the relationship to
be different. And it’s not changing, and
it’s not different.
Gary:
Well, it is changing; it just isn’t
working better.
Class Participant:

Yeah.
Gary:
If 
you’re 
trying 
to 
change 
the
relationship, you’re trying to sit on the
chair facing in a different direction.
You’re not trying to do something
different that allows a different choice.
Does that help?
Class Participant:
Yeah, that helps immensely. I was
talking to a friend yesterday about the
way women are more complicated than
men. I seem to have bought the point of
view from women that I have to change
things, and that feels really complicated.

Gary:
Yeah, that’s what every man learns
from the women around him. A woman’s
point of view is always going to be
“What do you need to change? How can
I change you?” It is complicated,
because you can’t see what they want
you to change—and they won’t tell you.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
When you’re willing to change the
relationship, you’re not willing to leave
the relationship.
Different means “Okay, so what

would I like to do different here?”
Different 
can 
mean 
leaving 
the
relationship. You have more choices.
Class Participant:
Thank you.
Dain:
You’ve been picking this up since the
time you had a mother. Different opens
up all possibilities because you’re no
longer tied to what was an integral part
of what has to go forward into the future,
which is what change is about.
You’ve got to function from: What can
I be or do different today that would
make this what I would like it to be? If

you’re only changing things, you’re
trying to change the way they look, not
do something different that creates a
different result. Do you get that?
Class Participant:
Yeah, got it!
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the need of change as more real
than the possibility of difference are
you choosing? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

When you have a need of change,
you’re operating from a conclusion.
You’re 
not 
asking, 
“What 
other
possibilities are available here?” This is
the difference between choosing to be a
man and trying to function like a woman.
A woman will wear a dress and she’ll
use different accessories to change its
appearance. Most women have been
taught to change appearance, not to do
something different. Does that mean
anything? No. It’s just the way they
function. You have to be willing to look
at how they function and see how you
want to function. Do you want to
function from trying to change things so

they look different? Or do you want to
do something different that will work for
you?
What Can I Do Different?
Class Participant:
I’m sure you guys have talked about
this before but I’ve never heard it. I’ve
been looking at all the things that haven’t
been working for me lately and all the
ways I’ve been trying to change them
without asking, “What can I do different
here?” It’s always “How can I make this
a little bit better?” or “How can I make
this work a little bit better?” rather than
“What can I do different?”

Gary:
When you get into relationship, you
tend to do change, not different, because
the underlying foundation you’re creating
from is “I have this relationship.”
Dain:
The relationship becomes a center
point around which everything else
revolves. It’s like taking a string and
nailing one end of it into the ground and
telling yourself you can only go out as
far as the string goes. This is one of the
reasons a lot of guys start to get tired
once they’re in a relationship. You go
home to your girlfriend or your partner

and it’s “I just want to sit here and drink
beer” or “I just want to watch
television” or “I just want to go smoke”
or “I just want to do something.” You’re
in change; you’re not continuously being
different; 
and 
there’s 
not 
enough
vibrancy in change. It’s not enough
living; it’s not enough difference for you.
Gary:
If 
you 
started 
functioning 
from
different, you would create the vitality
that created your relationship in the first
place.
Dain:
And you would have the woman

begging for more! You’d have her
respecting you, you’d have her desiring
you, you’d have her turned on by you all
the time. But you try to play their game,
so to speak. You go into change, which
makes them not want to respect you.
They think they can run over you, they
can own you, they can control you, and
they believe you have no value.
Gary:
Which is not what they truly want to
have.
Dain:
Right, and unfortunately who’s the one
imposing that on you?

Gary:
You are.
Dain:
We’ve seen men who seem to be the
biggest assholes on the planet, and
women are all over them. The thing that
will make you more attractive than those
unkind, uncaring, asshole men will ever
be is the willingness to create something
different.
Gary:
The important part of this is creating.
When you’re trying to change, you’re not
trying to create. You’re trying to take
what has been instituted and alter it

sufficiently 
so 
it’s 
no 
longer
uncomfortable. Is that enough for you?
Dain:
You think you’re supposed to live
from change rather than difference. That
idea is so frigging intensely underneath
everything.
Gary:
It’s what we’ve been entrained to.
Dain:
When you begin to think about
choosing 
something 
different, 
your
cellular structure starts to vibrate. You
think you’re freaked out by different, you
think you don’t like different, you think

you just want to be able to change
enough to make it better, but that’s what
kills you. You have to get out of that
entrained mode, and the way to do that is
to ask: What can I be or do different here
that will allow a completely different
possibility to show up now?
Everything that doesn’t allow that,
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it please? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What stupidity are you using to create
the need of change as more real and
more necessary than the possibility of

difference you are choosing?
Gary:
Women go to “It’s necessary for you to
change,” and when anything becomes a
necessity, you have to resist.
What if you chose to do something
different with the men in your life?
Would that mean you’d have to have sex
with them? No, because right now
you’re maintaining your relationships
with them, you’re trying to change your
relationship with men while not doing
something different than what you’ve
done in the past. It’s all about change.
Women learn early on that you have a

paper doll and you put new paper
dresses on it to make it appear changed
and different. But it’s not actually
different; its appearance has been
changed by what they’ve put on it. Is that
enough?
My ex-wife once said, “Gary and I
have such a different relationship now
that I have changed the way he dresses.”
Dain:
Wow. “Look, I’ve made a male doll
out of him.”
Gary:
I was her male doll.
Dain:

How many of you have become the
male doll in most of the relationships
you’ve been in? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it please? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
The thing that gets you there is the
separation of you from you.
What stupidity are you using to
create the need of change as more real
and 
more 
necessary 
than 
the
possibilities, choices, and questions
of difference you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,

will you destroy and uncreate it
please? Right and Wrong, Good and
Bad, POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
You’ve been asking, “How can I
change this?” rather than “What other
choices, what other possibilities, and
what other questions can I have here?”
which means you cannot be contributed
to. You can only try to give to someone
else. Does that make sense?
Class Participant:
Totally.
Class Participant:

This is so good. It’s spot-on for my
whole life. I see how I have stopped the
choices to do something different.
Gary:
Unfortunately, we have not been given
an awareness of difference. Part of this
information came up in Costa Rica when
I was talking with Dain about a situation
in his life. He asked, “How do I fix
this?” I asked, “Why would you fix it?
You can do something different.”
Dain:
I said, “That’s not what people do.
Nobody in the world does something
different. You fix it so it works better.”

Gary just about fell over.
Gary:
I had to lie down. It so startled me,
because I had spent all my time creating
Access Consciousness from the point of
view that if you knew you could choose
different, you would.
It was startling and stunning to me that
my reality was so different from
everybody else’s.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the need of change as more real
and 
more 
necessary 
than 
the
possibilities, choices, and questions

of difference you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it
please? Right and Wrong, Good and
Bad, POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
When you function from possibilities,
choice, and question, it is a contribution
that goes in both directions. It is about
the contribution you are to others and the
contribution you are to yourself. If you
stop trying to change you to fit in the
relationship and start looking at “What
would have to occur different here for
me?” you will get a different set of
questions, a different set of possibilities,

and a different set of choices you can
start to function from. I can pretty much
guarantee most men never look at what
would have to happen different for their
relationship to work for them.
You go to “How can I change me?”
rather than “How can we do something
totally different, whatever it is?” or
“What can we be or do different?” or
“What can I be or do different that will
allow a different possibility, choice, and
question to show up in order to be a
different 
contribution 
and 
to 
be
contributed to differently?”
Possibility, Choice,

Question, and Contribution
Gary:
Do you get that you would really like
to be a contribution?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
The only way you’re going to function
from contribution is through choice,
possibility, and question. You’ve already
got the target of contribution. It’s not
about how contribution has to be added
to this; that’s what you and everybody
else desires as a being—to be a
contribution.

If 
you 
start 
to 
function 
from
“different,” different things can show up
in your life. You’ve got to create a
different reality rather than trying to
change this reality. Don’t try to be the
fix-it man.
Class Participant:
When I try to change me to have things
work better or to fit in better, is that
where I lose myself?
Gary:
Yeah, that’s where you lose yourself,
because you’re not doing or being
something different; you’re changing so
you fit better. It’s like you’ve changed

your outfit. You’re dressed for the role.
You’re not dressed for success.
Class Participant:
This gives me so much awareness of
what I have been choosing that I have
never been aware of. I’m truly grateful
for this.
Dain:
It explains a lot of areas where we, as
men, have not been able to be men, and
it explains a lot of the non-maleness
we’ve tried to function from.
Gary:
Because you try to adjust you and
change you to fit the cut-out cardboard

universe of change.
Class Participant:
Exactly. I have been asking myself,
“How can I change so it works better for
someone else?” instead of asking,
“What’s going to work for me?” and
“What can I do different that would
work for me and maybe for the other
person as well?”
Have You Ever Been
Encouraged to Be a Man?
Class Participant:
I’m sorry that I’m having trouble
getting this and being what I can be as a

man. I’m so grateful for the Gentlemen’s
Club.
Gary:
So can I ask you a question?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
Have you ever been encouraged to be
a man?
Class Participant:
No, not at all.
Gary:
Has anybody on this call been
encouraged to be a man?

Class Participant:
Now you are making me cry.
Gary:
I was never encouraged to be a man. I
was encouraged to be a man that women
would choose to marry.
Class Participant:
I’ve never seen a man who has chosen
to be a man. They’ve just been trying to
be whatever works for their woman or
their wife.
Class Participant:
Thank you, guys, for being willing to
deal with us.

Gary:
We like you. We like you better than
you like you.
Dain:
Yes, exactly! We like you a lot more
than you like you.
Gary:
We want you to step up to being
something different.
Class Participant:
Different is my new word.
Gary:
All right you guys, take care. I love
you lots.

Class Participant:
Thanks, guys.
Gary:
Bye-bye.
Dain:
Bye-bye.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
2
Creating Sex and
Relationship from an
Awareness of What Is
You have a tendency to look for the
rightness of your limited point of view,
not the truth of what you can perceive,
know, be, and receive,
and you end up in relationships that
don’t work.

Gary:
Hello, gentlemen. Does anyone have a
question?
Creation vs. Invention
Class Participant:
At the moment, I haven’t got time to deal
with the man thing. All my energy is
going into making money and doing my
business. There’s no time for this
gentlemen stuff. All of these other things
are way more important. What am I
creating with that? What can I do or be
that will create something different for
me so I can have it all?

Gary:
You have to be clear that there’s a
difference 
between 
creation 
and
invention. Invention is when you watch
television and you see people doing
things, and you try to invent that what
they’re doing is actually real, so you say
the same words and do the same actions,
thinking you’re going to create what they
have. But you’re not creating anything.
It’s a total invention of what reality is.
It’s not an awareness of what reality is.
We’d like to get you to a place where
you have a different kind of choice so
you can start to look at what is and ask,
“How would I like to use this?” and

“How can I create this?”
Once when we were in Costa Rica, I
was watching a movie on TV. Everything
was in Spanish, and I didn’t fully
understand it, but I got the gist of what
was going on. They wanted to portray
“passion,” so they showed somebody’s
undies falling to the floor. The person
was wearing Nikes and low-top socks. I
might have thought “passion” if it had
been panties falling on high heels. I
might have thought “passion” if had
known whether it was a male or female
wearing the Nikes, but as it was, it
didn’t work for me as “passion.”
Watching it, I realized that we invent the

thoughts, feelings, emotions, sex and no
sex that we function from. We don’t
generate and create the true elements of
what will give us everything we want.
For example, what percentage of your
sex life is invented according to the
visual cortex of this reality?
Dain:
The visual cortex is the part of the
brain that processes visual information.
You see somebody who matches your
visual cortex’s invention of what a
person is supposed to be and you invent
that it means this, this, and this. What
you see doesn’t mean any of that, but you
cut off your awareness in favor of going

with the limitation of invention.
The Way It Looks vs. The
Way It Is
Gary:
You, as an infinite being, perceive,
know, be, and receive, right?
The lower harmonic of perceiving,
knowing, 
being, 
and 
receiving 
is
functioning 
from 
thoughts, 
feelings,
emotions, and sex or no sex. When
you’re 
doing 
that, 
everything 
is
delineated as what you, the limited
being, visually see in the world. You
have a totally limited point of view of
what can actually be. For example, when

you try to do something from the visual
aspect, you can only see the way it looks
—not the way it is.
You have a tendency to look for the
rightness of your limited point of view,
not the truth of what you can perceive,
know, be, and receive, and you end up in
relationships that don’t work.
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the signs, seals,
symbols, emblems, and significances
of sex, copulation, and relationship as
the wrongness, the refusal of success,
the elimination of receiving, and the
losing you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you

destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
The 
signs, 
seals, 
symbols, 
and
emblems, and significances are the
badges you wear that have nothing to do
with who you are. You look for the
signs, seals, symbols, emblems, and
significances of sex, copulation, and
relationship.
The signs, seals, symbols, emblems,
and significances of copulation are
“They look like my type,” “They don’t
look like my type,” “They might be fun,”
“They might not be fun,” “I can watch

them do this, but I don’t have to be
involved in it.” It’s all the weird places
you go, where instead of having choice,
you have the elimination of possibility.
The signs, seals, symbols, emblems,
and significances of relationship are
“Oh, they like me,” “Oh, they don’t like
me,” “Oh, they want to be with me,”
“They don’t want to be with me,” “Oh, I
want somebody in my life,” “I don’t
want somebody in my life.”
How many times do you look at
somebody and say, “This is the person I
want to be with,” yet you have no idea
who the hell that person is? You have no
awareness of what they really want, and

you cut off all of your awareness of what
they’re going to ask of you because you
don’t want anybody to ask anything of
you that you’re not willing to give.
How’s that working?
Class Participant:
Not at all. It’s like a caveman
autopilot thing. It seems fundamental to
being a man (speaking in a caveman
voice), “Uh, that looks good, go.”
The Rule of Dick
Gary:
The fundamental thing about being a
man is you’re supposed to be ruled by

your dick. Whether you’re a gay man or
a straight man, dick rules. Is that truth or
is that invention?
Class Participant:
Invention.
Gary:
How many of you have invented the
rule of dick? Everywhere you’ve
invented the rule of dick, will you
now destroy and uncreate all of that?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Dain:
That’s awesome. The rule of dick.

Gary:
How many of you have had that place
where you invented that you were a
“duh” kind of guy?
Dain:
Every time someone attractive walks
by!
Gary:
Anytime you’re attracted to anyone,
you go into “duh.”
Everything you’ve done to invent
you as a “duh” kind of guy, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
Dain:
“Duh, can I have that, please? Can I
have one of those? Okay, thank you. Can
I have another one please? Okay, thank
you.” It’s like nothing else matters. You
become a “duh.”
Gary:
You become a single digit IQ.
Everything you’ve done to invent
you as a single digit IQ, meaning your
dick rules, will you destroy and
uncreate all of that? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Dain:
Wow. I like this call already.
Gary:
I do too.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the signs, seals,
symbols, emblems, and significances
of sex, copulation, and relationship as
the wrongness, the refusal of success,
the elimination of receiving, and the
losing you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and

POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
If You’re a Man, You’re
Wrong
Gary:
Have you ever had the idea that you
were wrong when you were with
somebody that you thought was cute,
good looking, and the right person for
you?
Class Participant:
Yeah, but we’re also wrong if we’re
not with that person.
Gary:

Well, of course! If your snake doesn’t
point in the right direction, you’re
wrong. If it points in a direction, you’re
wrong. If it points at all, you’re wrong.
Dain:
And if it doesn’t point, you’re even
more wrong.
Gary:
Everything you’ve done to invent
that as your reality, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
I’ve noticed, in getting ready to go out

with different girls for dinner or sex or
whatever, that I would be thinking,
“Does this look okay? Oh jeez, did I
manscape correctly? Let me brush my
teeth another time. Uh, I need to make
sure I have deodorant on. Let me make
sure to wash this.” There was an
intensity of judgment about how I was
going to be wrong, how I was already
wrong, and how if I could look perfect
enough, or sound perfect enough, or say
something perfect enough, that would
somehow undo the wrongness. It took me
a long time to realize that I was
perceiving what was in their world.
Everything that is that you’ve done

to invent you as the needing to be the
perfection of a sex partner, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Apparently all of you guys have been
trying to do “perfect sex partner.”
Gary:
If you’re a man, you’re wrong. If
you’re a man with men, you’re still
wrong. If you think about having sex
with men, you’re wrong. If you think
about having sex with women, you’re
wrong. The good news is you’re just

frigging wrong.
Everything you’ve done to invent
that as your reality, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the signs, seals,
symbols, emblems, and significances
of sex, copulation, and relationship as
the wrongness, the refusal of success,
the elimination of receiving, and the
losing you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you

destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Gary:
Lordy, lordy. The good news is you
guys have wrongness down to a fine
science.
Dain:
It’s good to be right at something.
Gary:
Yes, it’s always good to be right at
being wrong. It’s like automatically,
because you’re a man, you’re wrong.
Dain:

You’re right.
Gary:
I know, but if I’m right, you’re wrong,
and if I’m wrong, you’re right and if I’m
a man, I’m wrong no matter what.
Everything you’ve invented about
that point of view, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Do we think we’re going to be right if
we get the woman, so to speak?
Gary:

Well, you think that if you get her,
you’re finally going to prove you have
the right signs, seals, symbols, emblems,
and significances. Most of you are only
willing to have the red badge of courage
or the red letter “A,” which means
you’re an adulterer and an asshole. What
if you were the person who could
activate and actualize a different reality?
Are you choosing that or avoiding that?
How many times have you invented you
as a loser even before you start? More
than a godzillion, or less?
Class Participant:
More.

Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Isn’t that great? You’ve lost before
you even open your mouth. Would that
make 
it 
a 
little 
hard 
to 
create
relationship or copulation? Yeah! That’s
not in your best interest.
The Invention of
Contraception
Dain:

What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the signs, seals,
symbols, emblems, and significances
of sex, copulation, and relationship as
the wrongness, the refusal of success,
the elimination of receiving, and the
losing you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
The signs, seals, symbols, emblems,
and significances are inventions that
keep you from giving birth to your
awareness. They’re like the ultimate

contraception. You have sex, copulation,
and relationship as things that create the
wrongness, the refusal of success, the
elimination of receiving, and the making
sure to lose. You try to get the right sex,
the right copulation, and the right
relationship so that you can stop feeling
like a loser, a not winner, and somebody
who can receive and not be wrong.
Class Participant:
When Dain said, “The signs, seals,
symbols, emblems, and significances are
inventions that keep you from giving
birth to your awareness,” it read for me.
What is that?

Gary:
How much of the inventions of sex,
copulation, and relationship are a way
to eliminate and not to give birth to
awareness but to abort awareness?
Class Participant:
All of it.
Gary:
How much of the sex you’ve had
has been based on aborting all of your
awareness? A lot? A little? Or
megatons? Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD and POC, All Nine,
Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:

What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the signs, seals,
symbols, emblems, and significances
of sex, copulation, and relationship as
the wrongness, the refusal of success,
the elimination of receiving, and the
losing you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Gary:
Do 
you 
actually 
believe 
it’s
possible for you to lose? Everything
you’ve done to create that belief, will

you destroy and uncreate it all? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
There are no losers. The difference
between a loser and a winner is the
difference between somebody who will
try, regardless, and someone who won’t
even bother to try so that he doesn’t lose.
How much of what you’ve created
yourself as has been an invention so
that you won’t actually have to
succeed, receive, or lose, but so you
can always prove that you were wrong
for not choosing different? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you

destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Here’s the process you guys need to
start running:
What 
physical 
actualization 
of
creating the sex, copulation, and
success am I now capable of
generating, creating, and instituting?
Everything that doesn’t allow that to
show up times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all?
What If Success Is Just a
Choice?

Class Participant:
You said, “sex, copulation, and
success.” How is success part of that
equation? It seems out of left field.
Gary:
Well, if you achieve having sex with
somebody, do you feel more successful?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
If you achieve a sense of having more
money, do you feel more successful?
Class Participant:
Yes.

Gary:
Are they actually different?
Class Participant:
They’re different energies, but the
satisfaction or the success is there.
Gary:
The success is still there, regardless.
That’s why I’m giving you this process
to run.
What 
physical 
actualization 
of
creating the sex, copulation, and
success am I now capable of
generating, creating, and instituting?
Everything that doesn’t allow that to
show up times a godzillion, will you

destroy and uncreate it all?
Class Participant:
I keep coming back to success. It is
such a loaded word for me. It’s all about
a validation of me, and it’s just about
judgment.
Gary:
Success is always a judgment. What if
you 
didn’t 
have 
to 
worry 
about
judgment? What if success is just a
choice?
Class Participant:
Could you just choose success without
judgment?
Gary:

Yeah.
Class Participant:
Can you explain that?
Gary:
Yeah. Success with judgment is the
idea that you’re going to have sex with
somebody. Success with judgment is the
idea that you’re going to create
something as a result of it. Do you really
need that? What if you were willing to
look at something without a sense of
success? What would it be like if you
were willing to have everything you
were capable of having? The things we
look at as success, sex, copulation, and

romance, are contrived. They’re an
invented reality.
You Can Create—or You
Can Invent
Dain:
Because you can either create or you
can invent, which goes back to the very
beginning of this conversation.
Gary:
How much of your success with
romance, sex, and copulation is
invented to the point where it stifles
you and destroys you? A lot? A little?
Or megatons? Everything that is times

a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Invention is when you look at
somebody and you try to create an
emotional connection. You try to create
your sex and your copulation from that,
but it doesn’t work because it doesn’t
have any substance to it. You, as the
being you are, have a lot more substance
in life and unfortunately if you have
serious substance, you have a tendency
to scare the people you’re interested in.
Dain:

You scare them rather dynamically. So
you learn from a very early time to tone
down everything that’s intense about
you. Everything that’s great about you.
Everything that’s weird about you.
Everything that’s different about you,
which by the way, is everything that
makes you, you. It’s everything that
makes you attractive to somebody who
would be fun to be with. You tone down
all of those things and you try to invent
you as something that would be
attractive to the person you’ve invented
that you have to be attracted to.
Gary:
How’s that working for you?

Class Participant:
Not at all.
Gary:
You’ve got to get real about what you
want to create. If you take the point of
view “I want somebody to be in my
life,” what does that mean? Something?
Nothing? 
Anything? 
Or 
is 
it 
so
amorphous you don’t have to see what
will actually work for you?
How much of what you’ve decided
“being with somebody” is, is an
invention of the amorphous reality of
nothingness?
Dain:

What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the signs, seals,
symbols, emblems, and significances
of sex, copulation, and relationship as
the wrongness, the refusal of success,
the elimination of receiving, and the
losing you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What 
physical 
actualization 
of
creating the sex, copulation, and
success are you now capable of
generating, creating, and instituting?

Everything that doesn’t allow that to
show up times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Creating Something That Is
Different
Gary:
Do you guys understand that we’re
talking about creating something that is
different? You have to get what you
would like something to be. Ask:
• Will it be easy?

• Will it be fun?
• Will it be expansive for me?
• Will it be nurturing for me?
• Will I learn something?
If not, all you’re doing is asking for
somebody who will fuck you. And if you
ask for somebody who will fuck you,
lots of people will fuck you—and not
always in a good way.
Dain:
True story.
Gary:
Does that make sense to you?
Class Participant:

Yes.
Gary:
How many of you have been fucked
—and not in a good way—by
someone you decided you wanted to
be with? Everywhere you made that
decision, because every time you do a
decision, a judgment, a computation,
or a conclusion about anybody you’re
going to have sex or copulation with,
you’ve sealed your coffin and you’re
going 
to 
die 
in 
the 
situation.
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the signs, seals,
symbols, emblems, and significances
of sex, copulation, and relationship as
the wrongness, the refusal of success,
the elimination of receiving, and
losing you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What 
physical 
actualization 
of

creating the sex, copulation, and
success are you now capable of
generating, creating, and instituting?
Everything that doesn’t allow that to
show up times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the rule of dick
are you choosing? Everything that
doesn’t allow that to show up times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
How many of you think your dick is
ruling everything, including you?
Everything you’ve done to give your
dick rule over you, will you destroy
and uncreate all of that? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Are You Making Yourself
Less Sexual?
Dain:
How many of you, in an effort to not

have your dick run your life, have
made yourselves totally asexual?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Gary:
Wow. It’s not that they’ve made
themselves 
asexual. 
They’ve 
made
themselves less sexual so that they can
be received by those who don’t like sex.
Dain:
Oh yeah, I did that for a long, long
time.

Class Participant:
Oh my God.
Gary:
Everything you’ve done to make you
less sexual so you can be received by
those who don’t like sex, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that, times
a godzillion? Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD and POC, All Nine,
Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
We learn to do that as kids. Yesterday
I took my son to his mom’s, and it was
interesting to watch how he completely
shut off all of his sexualness so she

could receive him.
Gary:
Yeah, you realize you’re going to be
vilified and made mincemeat of if you
have that kind of sexualness.
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the wrongness
of your sexualness as the perfection of
the judgments of your sexualness and
the need to provide sexual energy for
those who are dead and dying are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
Wow. 
Wow. 
Have 
I 
mentioned
“wow”?
Are You Trying to Heal
Those Who Are Dying from
a Lack of Sexual Energy?
Gary:
That’s a good process. It’s got a ton of
charge. Apparently most of you have
been cutting your sexual energy down so
you can heal those that are dying from
lack of sexual energy.
Class Participant:

Oh my God.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the wrongness
of your sexualness as the perfection of
the judgments of your sexualness and
the need to provide sexual energy for
those who are dead and dying are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Hey, I’ve got a question. Is this why,
when you’re around somebody who has

sexual energy, especially another guy,
you freak out and do weird competitive
shit? You’d rather pick some woman or
some mate who’s dead and dying and try
to bring them to life, and you’re pissed if
some other guy is interested in bringing
them to life instead of you?
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the wrongness
of your sexualness as the perfection of
the judgments of your sexualness, you
bad, bad boy, and the need to provide
sexual energy for those who are dead
and 
dying 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?

Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Gary:
Can I just say that injecting your sperm
into somebody does not create life and
living?
Everywhere you’ve tried to create
that and everything you’ve invented
that will actually create life and
living, will you destroy and uncreate
all of that please, times a godzillion?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.

Class Participant:
What if you inject it on them?
(Laughter)
Dain:
I love you. I love you.
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the wrongness
of your sexualness as the perfection of
the judgments of your sexualness,
because what else are you going to do
with all of your time and energy and
the need to provide sexual energy for
those who are dead and dying are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and

uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
How many of you have actually
invented that the people you have sex
with who are dead and dying are the
people who need the sex you can
provide? Everything you’ve done to
create that instead of actually enjoying
the fuck out of yourselves, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.

Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the wrongness
of your sexualness as the perfection of
the judgments of your sexualness and
the need to provide sexual energy for
those who are dead and dying are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
Have you decided you’re the dead and
dying that you have to provide sexual

energy for?
Dain:
And that you can actually get sexual
energy from people who are dead and
dying?
Gary:
Everything you did to create that
invention as real, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
It seems like a measure of success to
be able to prop up someone who’s dead
and dying.

Dain:
There’s nothing there, and you say, “I
will bring you to life! Therefore, I am
strong. I am a success because I brought
you to life.”
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the wrongness
of your sexualness as the perfection of
the judgments of your sexualness and
the need to provide sexual energy for
those who are dead and dying are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Gary:
Everything that doesn’t allow you to
see where you’ve chosen the dead and
dying to have sex with instead of
choosing the people who would
actually be fun, will you destroy and
uncreate all of that? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
Everything that makes this about
where you have to become the dead
and dying so someone will come and
give you energy, will you destroy and
uncreate all of that please? Right and

Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Sexual Attraction
Gary: Is that what you call sexual
attraction?
Dain:
Wow.
Gary:
That’s what you’ve invented as sexual
attraction. If you get somebody who’s
dead and dying, they’re attracted to you.
If you’re dead and dying, you will be
attractive to somebody else.

Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What percentage of your sexual
attraction is an invention to get you to
see or be the wrongness of you? A lot?
A little? Or megatons? Everything that
is times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to

create the invention of the wrongness
of your sexualness as the perfection of
the judgments of your sexualness and
the need to provide sexual energy for
those who are dead and dying are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
Wow, this is even more intense than I
was hoping for.
Class Participant:
I’m really grateful.

Dain:
Man, this is really amazing. And I
thought the other one was a never-ending
process.
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention of the wrongness
of your sexualness as the perfection of
the judgments of your sexualness and
the need to provide sexual energy for
those who are dead and dying are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Gary:
What if you had more sexual energy
than the other people around you?
How many of you are sexual healers
and want others to be sexual healers
for you? That’s the one that’s killing
you. You want others to be sexual
healers for you. Every invention you
created in that world, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Focus on the Creation
You try to invent that something is
going to happen rather than creating it so

it does happen.
If you want to be successful, you’ve
got to look at what you’re capable of
creating. You’ve got to focus on the
creation 
of 
getting 
together 
with
somebody sexually.
Dain:
When you invent that something is
going to happen and it doesn’t happen,
you’re left with the wrongness of you for
not being able to create what you
invented that you should be able to
create. You’re willing to spend a lot of
time and energy on who or what you
might have sex with, or get laid by, or

however you want to put it, except how
much energy are you willing to put into
creating success in every area of your
life?
Gary:
You 
tend 
to 
use 
sex 
as 
the
identification 
of 
success. 
You’re
successful if you have sexual energy that
is attractive to large numbers of people.
What if that’s the lie that’s keeping you
trapped?
Everything you’ve done to buy the
lie that sexual energy will be the sign
of success and that sexual energy will
get you laid, will you destroy and

uncreate all of that? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Hey, Gary, you say it’s a lie, but it
feels so true. I’ve bought hook, line, and
sinker the idea that if you have sexual
energy, you will be successful.
Gary:
Is that true, or is that what you’re
doing against you?
Dain:
Or is it what you’re inventing against
you?
Gary:

Everything you’ve done to use that
energy against you rather than for you,
will you destroy and uncreate all of
that? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Going on Vacation
Dain:
All of these inventions are a huge part
of what’s standing in the way of sex ever
being fun, because it’s based on all of
these inventions. It’s also one of the
places where you keep you from the
success that’s available. Think of the
amount of energy you put into sex and

getting laid—or avoiding getting laid—
and ask, “If I put that amount of energy
into my business, what would I have
created in the last year?” Maybe you
could 
consider 
the 
possibility 
of
changing that so you start putting that
energy into your business.
There was a time in my life where
women were the thing. At one point, I
went on a date one morning, and there
was another girl I had sex with later that
day. I spent the night with her, and I had
another girl come over the next afternoon
and she and I had sex. I had a two-and-
half day vacation, if you will.
Gary:

That’s what we call it now, “Dain
goes on vacation.”
Dain:
Yeah, “I’m going on vacation!” That
was where I turned my mind off. It was
my 
vacation 
from 
consciousness,
awareness, and creating my business.
Gary:
What physical actualization of sex
and copulation as “on vacation” are
you now capable of generating,
creating, and instituting? Everything
that doesn’t allow that to show up
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
I was really grateful for having that
experience because I realized I was
putting huge amounts of energy into
people’s universes to bring them to life
and to make sex the place where I could
undo their judgments, get their bodies
turned on, and have a level of intensity
that I like. I looked at it and I said,
“Man, if I had put that amount of energy
into my business, my business would
have taken off this weekend instead of
just lurching forward a little bit.” I had
taken so much energy away from it. It’s

not that you have a finite amount of
energy, but when you have the idea,
“This is what’s creative, this is what’s
generative, and very little else is,” you
take yourself away from the success you
could create.
Gary:
Do you know how I used to bypass
that? In the old days when I did drugs,
sex, and rock and roll, I would have two
joints before I had sex with somebody so
I could bypass all of their judgments. It
worked really well.
Dain:
If you can have that awareness and

ask, “Am I actually destroying my
success here by the choices I’m
making?” you might find that you can
make a different choice. You might say,
“Okay, what would it take for this to be
creative and generative? All of the
inventions I have that are creating me
going here right now, destroy and
uncreate them.”
What Would It Be Like to
Create Sex and Relationship
from a Totally Different
Reality?
Gary:

This coming week, I’d like you to look
at what it would be like if you were
willing to generate and create sex and
relationship from a totally different
reality. Put this question on a loop and
listen to it nonstop:
What physical actualization of sex,
copulation, relationship, and success
from a reality beyond this reality am I
now capable of generating, creating
and instituting? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:

Okay, beautiful men.
Class Participant:
I just want to say I’m so grateful for
these calls. They’re amazing. Thank you
very much.
Class Participant:
Thank you so much.
Dain:
Thank you. How does it get any better
than that?
Gary:
Thank you, guys. Love you a lot.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
3
You Are the Valuable
Product
I’m no longer making others the
valuable product.
I’ve become the valuable product,
and there’s more available for me than
there has been ever before.
Gary:
Hello, Gentlemen. Let’s start with

some questions.
Demons of Necessity
I’m so grateful for The Gentlemen’s
Club. For the first time in my life, I’m
happy about being a man and being in a
man’s body. I’ve been asking the
question, “How does it get any better
than this?” and about ninety percent of
the time I hear, “It doesn’t.” I don’t know
whether that’s my thought, someone
else’s thought, or an entity’s thought.
I’ve also been asking, “What stupidity
am I using to create the total eradication
and elimination of ‘How does it get any
better than this?’ am I choosing?” Can

you give me some clarity on this,
please?
Gary:
You’ve got to ask: Demons of
separation? And tell them it’s time to
leave. You say: Demons, go back to from
whence you came, never to return to me
or this reality again.
Anybody or anything that tells you that
you can’t do something is a demon. An
entity is a being that would gladly take
on a new body. A demon is an entity that
has been given the job of getting power
over someone or something. It will lock
you up and keep you diminished. We

want to get you to a place where that is
not the case. Demons come whenever
you become a follower of someone,
because you’re trying to get power from
the person you’re following. Have any
of you ever given power over to a
woman?
Class Participants:
(Laughter)
Gary:
That would be a yes. Let’s start with
this process:
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, 
and 
the 
demons 
of

necessity of following the opposite
sex are you choosing? Everything that
is times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Could you talk about what artificial
intensity is?
Gary:
When you really want to have
something, you take the point of view,
“This is a really good idea!” You make
it intense. You say, “I so need this!” It’s
an invented point of view. It’s artificial.

You use intensity to create the belief that
you’re going to create something good.
Every time you want to follow a
woman, or the golden vagina, you’re
creating a place where you become the
effect of demons. And if you were a
woman in some lifetime, you’ll try to
follow 
men. 
Whenever 
you 
make
yourself a follower of someone, you
invite the demons in to control you.
Class Participant:
When you follow a guru, are you
trying to get power over him?
Gary:
You follow a guru because you want

him to see you as the brilliant person you
are. You invite the demons in to see you
and recognize how brilliant you are. The
demons activate any time you try to
follow somebody.
Class Participant:
This is so interesting.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, 
and 
the 
demons 
of
necessity of following the opposite
sex are you choosing? Everything that
is times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You invent that demons are a source of
power and that artificial intensity is a
source of power. Of course, none of you
have been artificially intense. Or have
you?
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, 
and 
the 
demons 
of
necessity of following the opposite
sex are you choosing? Everything that
is times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Whenever you try to follow something
or someone, you’re inviting what will
create the worst result into your life. The
idea of following is the idea that
somebody needs to have control over
you or that they can have control over
you and that it’s more important for
someone to have control over you than it
is for you to be you.
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, 
and 
the 
demons 
of
necessity of following the opposite
sex are you choosing? Everything that
is times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I’m having great difficulty in staying
present with this call. I just don’t want to
be here. I want to rip my ear phones off.
Is this demon stuff or something else?
Gary:
Demons always try to make you go
away from anything that’s going to give
you freedom from them. So right now, all
of you, tell all the demons that you’ve
ever chosen in order to have the
opposite sex or to be the opposite sex:
Go back to from whence you came,

never to return to me or this reality ever
again.
Class Participant:
Wow, that’s cool.
Class Participant:
Thank you.
Gary:
Is that feeling better for anyone?
Class Participant:
Yes!
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, 
and 
the 
demons 
of

necessity of following the opposite
sex are you choosing? Everything that
is times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Are you more able to stay present
now?
Class Participant:
I’m much more present now. My body
is almost shaking.
Gary:
Good. Is that shaking—or is that being
the energy that your body can actually
be? You invite entities and demons into

your body and your reality so you can be
the demon in bed you’re supposed to be.
This is where you’re supposed to
demand sex of a woman and she’s
expected to give it because she’s
supposed to follow you, but you’re
already following her, so who’s in
charge, and how’s it working?
Class Participant:
It doesn’t.
Class Participant:
Gary, I heard you say on a call the
other day, and it was the first time I
heard you say it, that the more conscious
we become, the more we wake up these

demons.
Gary:
The more conscious you become, the
more you wake up the demons and
entities because when you’re no longer
willing to be the effect of things, it
becomes more difficult for them to
maintain their jobs.
Class Participant:
I’ve noticed, as I’ve run this demon
process, that some days the voices are
gone and some days they’re there times
ten.
Permeating Consciousness

into a Demon’s World
Gary:
Yeah, because a new set of them is
waking up. You can run:
What stupidity am I using to avoid
the permeable consciousness I could
be choosing? Everything that doesn’t
allow that to show up times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
If you permeate consciousness into a
demon’s world, it cannot maintain itself
here. Demons have been doing the job of

creating followers and creating people
as the effect for trillions of years, and
they don’t really want to do it anymore.
They don’t like where they are; they
don’t like where they’re stuck any more
than you like them being stuck on you.
The more consciousness that comes to
light on planet Earth, the more their job
is of no value. In India and most of the
Middle East, for example, they’ve
worshipped demon gods for centuries.
And in other parts of the world, people
practice black magic.
The idea that you, as a being, need
something outside of you is an invented
reality. People say things like, “Oh, the

demon rum” or “The demons made me
do it” or “The devil made me do it.”
Those are ways we invite demons into
existence, but they can’t maintain their
job in the face of consciousness. So keep
running:
What stupidity am I using to avoid
the permeable consciousness I could
be choosing? Everything that doesn’t
allow that to show up times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:

Is there a demon of money?
Gary:
Yeah. Money’s considered a demon.
People consider money the demon that
keeps them from having a life. “Money
is the root of all evil” or “The love of
money is the root of all evil.” No matter
how you put it, money is delineated as
evil, not as something that’s easy, joyful,
or valuable to have. Do you see how this
works?
What stupidity are you using to
avoid being the permeable laws of
consciousness you could be choosing?
Everything that doesn’t allow that to

show up times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Here is another process you may want
to run:
What physical actualization of being
the permeable laws of consciousness
are you now capable of generating,
creating, and instituting? Everything
that doesn’t allow that to show up
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

If you put these two processes on a
loop, they will start to change things in
every aspect of your life, not just with
relationships and women.
Are You Making Someone
Righteous?
Class Participant:
I’m struggling with what I want from
my life. I’m second guessing myself
constantly.
Gary:
Let’s try this process:
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial

intensities, and the demons that guard
and protect the righteous I am
following am I choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Did you say, “the righteous”? What is
that?
Gary:
The righteous I am following am I
choosing? Say you decide someone is a
righteous person. They’re not easy;

they’re not a slut. They’re not going to
give themselves away easily. So you
decide they’re righteous, and righteous
means better than you. Whenever you
decide someone is better than you, you
have to make you wrong about anything
you choose. Then you have to look at
how fucked up you are that the person
didn’t choose you.
Not that men do this with women. Oh
yeah, they do! Let’s run this one again.
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, and the demons that guard
and protect the righteous I am
following am I choosing? Everything

that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Have you ever noticed how you say,
“She’s the perfect girl?” That’s making
her righteous. “This girl is perfect. She’s
so beautiful.” Righteous. This is the way
you make someone righteous rather than
having you as valuable.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, and the demons that guard
and protect the righteous you are
following 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
When I called you last week, you gave
me a clearing about choosing for me
instead of choosing for everybody else.
I’ve started to do that more, especially
with my partner, and it has created a lot

of very intense situations, because she
has been used to me choosing her first or
us first and never me.
Gary:
Well, she does have a golden vagina.
Class Participant:
(Laughing) Absolutely. All of what
has happened in the last two weeks
matches the energy of everything you are
saying today. Can you help me to clarify
what I’m not seeing here?
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the golden vagina you are
choosing? Everything that is times a

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Deal and Deliver
Class Participant:
She reacts strongly when I choose to
do or be something different than before.
Gary:
You’re changing things. You never did
a Deal and Deliver with each other did
you?
Class Participant:
No, absolutely not.

Gary:
A relationship is a business deal, so
you have to do Deal and Deliver, as you
would in any business deal. Difficulties
in 
business 
interactions 
and
relationships arise because most people
have no idea what they would like. They
believe that if they’re kind and nice,
people will deliver kind and nice things
to them.
You’re not willing to see what people
want to deliver, what they’re going to
deliver, and what the deal is for them.
You have a godzillion fantasies about
what’s supposed to happen, which
means that you’re not looking at what’s

actually going to occur. You’ve got to do
Deal and Deliver or there won’t be
place from which to increase your
reality. You’ve got to get clear on
exactly what you need and desire and
what the other person needs and desires.
Ask:
• What is the deal?
• What are you going to deliver?
• What do you expect me to deliver?
• Exactly what is this going to look
like and how is that going to work?
• What am I going to have to be for
you?
You’ve got to say, “Hey, sweetheart.

Can we do a Deal and Deliver here?
What do you expect from me?” If you
call 
her 
“sweetheart” 
instead 
of
“sweetie” or “hon,” she’ll have to be
kinder, to live up to the title you have
given her.
Class Participant:
Cool. Have I created demons with my
choices around her?
Gary:
Yes. How many demons do you have
that create your following her at all
times? A lot, a little, or megatons?
Class Participant:
Megatons.

Gary:
Have you made her the guru of your
life? How many of you men have
made women the guru you are
supposed 
to 
follow? 
Everything
you’ve done to create the demons that
keep you following her and her orders
and 
doing 
what 
she 
says 
and
everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
This matches the question I asked you

about whether following somebody was
trying to get power over them.
Will This Expand My
Agenda?
Gary:
For several years, whenever Dain and
I were considering doing something, we
would ask the question, “Will this
expand my agenda?” The idea was that if
doing something would expand our
agenda, we should go for it.
It was very shocking to find out that
all men’s penises are named Agenda,
and if there’s a woman involved, all of
you think your agenda is going to

expand. In fact, you know it is.
Class Participants:
(Laughter)
Gary:
Your agenda is that thing that hangs
between your legs. Every time you think
about sex, you are expanding your
agenda. Dain and I found that a way to
get around asking about our agenda is:
• If I choose this, what will my life be
like in five years?
• If I don’t choose this, what will my
life be like in five years?
It’s the only way you’re going to find
out what you would like to create, which

would be expanding your agenda.
Class Participant:
How come five years? That’s quite far
away. Why isn’t it just a year?
Gary:
Five years is so far into the future that
you can’t invent what something’s going
to be like. Putting it at five years makes
it possible for you to perceive something
energetically rather than from your
thoughts, feelings, and emotions.
Class Participant:
Thank you.
When You’re the Leader,

You Become the Valuable
Product
Class Participant:
The thing of following the righteous
describes the way I’ve always done my
sexual relationships with men. I see a
guy and I say, “Yes, he’s the one.” The
one-digit IQ kicks in, and away we go. I
give him all my power, as you say, and
make him right, and if he doesn’t choose
me, then I’m wrong. Can you show me a
different way to do this?
Gary:
Yeah. You’ve got to ask, “Why am I
following instead of leading?”

What stupidity are you choosing to
avoid the leading you could be
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
What does that look like?
Gary:
Well, when you’re the leader, you
become the valuable product. In Access
Consciousness, women come up to Dain
and say, “Oh, I’d love to have sex with
you.” Do they really mean that?

Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
No. What do they mean?
Class Participant:
They want power over him. They want
to be significant.
Gary:
Yes. They want to be significant and
they want to have a relationship. I got a
note this weekend from a lady. It said,
“I’d love to go out to dinner with you
and have good times and more.” She is
nice looking, but she is a demon bitch
from hell.

Class Participant:
Isn’t that right up your alley, Gary?
Isn’t that what you like?
Gary:
That’s what I used to like. I
discovered that following the golden
vagina usually works out badly for me.
I’m no longer making others the valuable
product. I’ve become the valuable
product, and there’s more available for
me than there has been ever before.
What stupidity are you using to
avoid being the valuable product and
the leader you could be choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,

will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Most of you think that if someone is
willing to have you, or have sex with
you, they can’t be valuable. And if
they’re not willing to have sex with you,
you’re not valuable. Why do you
devalue you?
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Class Participant:
I recently met a woman and it was as
if she was saying, “We have to have sex
now, before we leave.”
Gary:
It has to be about her desire, her
reality, what she chooses, and what she
wants to create. What does that have to
do with what you desire?
Class Participant:
Nothing.
Gary:
Most people function from what other
people desire and require rather than
choosing what works for them.

Class Participant:
How come she has the same lack thing
in her universe?
Gary:
She too is trying to find a person she
can follow. Notice that the first process I
gave you was not about man or woman,
but the opposite sex:
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, 
and 
the 
demons 
of
necessity of following the opposite
sex are you choosing? Everything that
is times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
It applies to both sides of the game.
That’s the thing you’ve got to be aware
of. How do you play both sides of the
game? When you find somebody who
has an insanity that matches yours, you’ll
find yourself very attracted to him or her.
Isn’t that cute? Your matching insanity
attracts you to each other.
Class Participants:
(Laughter)
Class Participant:
And what is it when we want to kill
people we know from other lifetimes? Is

that another thing?
Gary:
When you have those really intense
attractions where you cannot separate
from the person, it’s usually this. It’s
when you say, “I’d really like to do blah,
blah, blah” or “It’s really important to
me that we get together” or “I know that
we’ve been together lots of lifetimes.”
Class Participant:
Recently I’m beginning to do different
things. I haven’t been going into those
old patterns as much as before.
Something has really shifted.
Gary:

Cool, we’re on the way. And that’s
what we want to look for: On the way.
The Wrongness around
Desiring Sex
Class Participant:
Could you talk about demons with
regards 
to 
the 
wrongness 
around
desiring to have sex?
Gary:
First of all, sex and copulation have
always been a wrongness.
How many lifetimes have you
chosen demons and asked for the help
of the Lord or anyone who could stop

you from wanting sex? How many
demons do you have cutting off sexual
energy?
Class Participant:
A lot.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you now demand that
they go back to from whence they
came, never to return to you or your
reality for all eternity?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:

Everything that doesn’t allow that to
show up times a godzillion, on three:
One… two… three! Thank you.
Have you ever said, “Please God,
don’t make me want to have sex all of
the time, because I’m so wrong for
wanting to have sex all of the time” or
“I’ve got to have sex. Can somebody
help me so I can have sex?” Either one
invites the demons in. Either one takes
away your power. You need to have
choice and the willingness to receive.
Total Presence in Sex and
Copulation
Class Participant:

What’s going on when you leave your
body during sex? Is that related to
demons?
Gary:
Well, usually leaving your body during
sex is a way to be present without being
present. You’re trying to leave your
expanding agenda in place without
showing up as you. So it doesn’t work,
does it?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
What would it be like if you were
totally present?

What stupidity are you using to
avoid total presence during sex and
copulation 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Cultural Entrainment
Class Participant:
I’m Asian, and it seems to me that
Asian people are more conservative
about sex.
Gary:

No, they’re more suppressed about
sex.
Class Participant:
Is this cultural programming?
Gary:
Yes.
Class Participant:
I am single and I have problems
approaching girls. I don’t know what the
real issue is. Sometimes it’s like a
feeling of fear or anxiety.
Gary:
Guys, you have to get that you’re
aware. There’s as much fear and anxiety

in the woman’s world as there is in
yours, if not more. You might want to
ask, “Is this mine?” because a lot of
times, the girl has as many problems as
you do.
When I was in high school, there was
a girl who was considered the most
beautiful woman in the school. No one
would talk to her or ask her out. They
were afraid to because they were certain
she would turn them down. I finally
screwed up my courage and asked her
out. She turned out to be the most boring
person I’ve ever been out with. After
that, I chose ugly people to go out with
because at least they were interesting. I

got clear that somebody who’s really
pretty has as much anxiety about being
asked out as somebody who is ugly. You
have to ask, “Is this fear or anxiety or
whatever it is mine? Or is this theirs?”
so you know what’s going on.
Class Participant:
How can I overcome this regardless
of everyone else’s judgments about
approaching girls?
Gary:
You can recognize that you’re the
valuable product.
Class Participant:
I attended the three-day body class

and 
I 
wanted 
to 
exchange 
body
processes with girls, but I have been
taught by society and my mother that
touching girls’ bodies is wrong.
Gary:
You’ve been taught that touching girls’
bodies is wrong. You’re wrong if you
touch them and you’re wrong if you
don’t. 
That’s 
cultural 
entrainment.
Cultural entrainment is everything you
buy from everybody else. It’s everything
your society and your culture say. All
those things are erroneous piles of
debris. Try running this:
What stupidity am I using to create

the 
cultural 
entrainment 
I 
am
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Does that cover religions too?
Gary:
Yes, religion is always a cultural
entrainment. How many lifetimes have
you been a priest and broken your vows
and had sex with somebody, usually a
boy, but we won’t talk about that. It’s not
normal to be chaste.

Everything that is times a godzillion
and all of the lifetimes in which you
have judged yourself for breaking your
vows to be chaste, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What stupidity are you using to
create the unsexing you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Being the Sexual Energy

You Are
Class Participant:
Gary, what is unsexing?
Gary:
Unsexing is where, instead of being
the sexual being you are, you try to deny
it, suppress it, not be it, and find ways to
eliminate it.
Class Participant:
Ah. Right.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the unsexing and uncopulating
you are choosing? Everything that is

times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You guys are putting so much energy
into unsexing and uncopulating! It’s
amazing you ever get laid.
What stupidity are you using to
create the unsexing and uncopulating
you are choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You’ve been trying to unsex and
uncopulate yourself forever! I don’t go

out and have sex, but I have plenty of
opportunities, and I always ask the
questions:
• Will it be easy?
• Will it be fun?
• Will I learn something?
Usually when I ask, “Will I learn
something?” I get “Yeah, I’ll learn how
bad it’s going to be!” So I don’t go there.
I used to figure as long as my agenda
was expanding, it must be right to do it.
None of you have that point of view, do
you?
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial

intensities, and the demons of your
penis always being the source of
expanding your agenda are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
How much of what is sexual energy
are you suppressing?
Class Participant:
It’s the following thing again, isn’t it?
You’ll change or suppress your sexual
energy based on what you think the
woman likes.

Gary:
Yeah, rather than actually being you. If
you’re really being the sexual energy,
you’re being everything you are. If
you’re being everything you are, you
become more intensely exciting, more
valuable, and more desirable.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I got confused there because I’ve been
asking myself, “What does this person

require of me?” and “What is she
willing to receive?” I got what she was
willing to receive and I decided to be
that—but she was not willing to receive
very much.
What Would I Like to
Create for Me?
Gary:
That’s what most of us do. We try to
only give what other people can receive
and we make them right. What if, instead
of assuming the rightness of the other
person, or the righteousness of them, or
the goodness of them, you were willing
to look at it and say, “I would really like

to create something different here. What
would I like to create for me?”
If you started to look at what you
could create for you, would you create
and generate more—or less? Would you
create people in your life who were
more willing to receive if you were
doing what worked for you?
I was talking with Dain recently and I
said, “You’ve got to stop looking for
what women desire and start asking for
what you desire. Your expanded agenda
has no consciousness.”
Does your expanded agenda desire
more 
than 
what 
comes 
in 
the
beginning? Everything that brings up

times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate all of that? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What stupidity are you using to create
the wrongness of being a man are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and uncreate
it all? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys,
and Beyonds.
A man is soft when he’s hard and hard
when he’s soft. Do you know what that
means?

Class Participant:
No.
Orgasm by Contraction /
Orgasm by Expansion
Gary:
If you have a hard-on for somebody,
you will give them whatever they want.
When you don’t give them what they
want, when you get what you want, all of
a sudden, you have no further interest.
This is the way the body works. It’s not
a wrongness or a rightness. If you go for
sex, for the idea of the orgasm, and you
do orgasm by contraction, which is how
most people do it, having sex does not

stimulate you to continue to live. If you
go for contraction to create orgasm, you
are not creating the generative energy of
living, which is what you get when you
do expansion to create orgasm.
Everything that just made you not
understand a word of what I just said,
will you destroy and uncreate all of
that? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
When you were a kid, you might have
gone into the bathroom to masturbate.
You would get it over with as quickly as
possible because you didn’t want
anybody to know what you were doing.

Most 
likely, 
your 
parents 
didn’t
encourage you to enjoy yourself. Very
few mothers or fathers say, “Take your
sweet time. Enjoy yourself and enjoy
your penis.” They ask, “What are you
doing in there?”
If you really want to increase your
sexual energy, I highly recommend you
start by doing masturbation differently.
You can do it with your girl or without
her. She might enjoy it if you actually
took time to masturbate. Decide that
you’re not going to get off in the first
three and a half minutes; you’re going to
take longer than that. Be willing to spend
an hour playing with your penis in a soft

and gentle way, and every time you feel
like you’re getting close, instead of
going faster so you get off, slow down.
Do it more slowly and gently. Add some
lubricant if you want to, but do it slow
and gentle. Be easy, sweet, and kind.
Every time you feel yourself contract,
say “no” and expand out.
You may lose your hard-on during the
process, but go back to playing with
your penis gently until your hard-on
comes back. Continue to stroke gently
and easily. If you do this, you’ll get to
the point where a) you’ll become a
better lover, b) you’ll become willing to
allow yourself to have lovers who will

take that kind of time with you and for
you, and c) instead of exploding with a
burst 
of 
energy 
that 
becomes 
a
limitation, you’ll start to create an
orgasm that generates energy. After
having an orgasm like that—expanded
and not contracted—you’ll want to go to
work, you’ll want to have a good time,
you’ll want to do more than go to sleep.
If you’ve ever had the experience of
wanting to go to sleep right after you’ve
gotten off, you’ve been doing contraction
to create orgasm. Using contraction to
create orgasm always lessens your
body’s generative and creative energies
in favor of the orgasm.

Class Participant:
Is the artificial intensity we are
creating from excitement through porn?
Gary:
When you create stroking your thing as
fast as you can to get off, you’re creating
an artificial intensity to get off on.
Class Participant:
Cool.
Gary:
You’re inventing that as the only way
you can get off, then when you have sex
with a woman, you have to go fast and
hard all the time, as if fast and hard is
the only way she’s going to be satisfied.

First of all, why is it always about how
she is satisfied, not about how you are
satisfied? When you’re willing to
function from expansion instead of
pushing to orgasm, you invite the
orgasm. You invite whoever you’re
having sex with to a different possibility
and a different choice.
Class Participant:
The woman I’m seeing did that with
me the other day. She was stroking my
penis and sucking and licking, and I was
falling asleep. I even snored several
times. What is that? Is that just the body
getting relaxed?

Gary:
Yeah, because the body should be
relaxed. Have you ever woken up with a
hard-on?
Class Participant:
When I’m relaxed, I get really hard
hard-ons.
Gary:
Exactly! Relaxation is the source of
what creates the hard-on. Relaxation is
the source for excitation. That’s the
reason I want you to practice this. Take
away the idea that you’re trying to create
orgasm. Instead you’re shooting for the
ability to create a more sustained hard-

on, a more enjoyable hard-on. It’s
enjoying your hard-on just for being a
hard-on. This will start to make you
better when you are in bed with
someone.
It will also take you to a place where
you have a choice of what you want to
create and the way you want to create it,
which makes you the valuable product.
Right now most of you would be very
happy just to have a moist, warm place
to stick your penis. That’s pretty much
enough for most men. And because that’s
pretty much enough for most men,
women begin to think men are selfish.
They think men are too fast; they don’t

go slow enough. A lot of women have
the point of view that sex is just pound,
pound, pound. They think, “Will you just
get it over with and cum so we can
stop?” It’s not about inviting the women
to an expansive life and living through
the orgasmic quality of sex. It’s about
getting you off or getting them off.
Neither of those should be the target.
Class Participant:
Do you have a clearing connected
with moving from contracting into
orgasm versus expanding?
Gary:
Unfortunately I can’t create that. You

have to practice, because you’ve learned
to do it the other way. It’s not that it’s
wrong. It’s just not going to create what I
think most of you would like to have.
Am I mistaken?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
You’d like sex to be something that
invigorates you and expands your life—
not just your agenda. There’s a different
possibility here, as far as I can see.
What possibility would you most like to
have? The more expansive version of
sex 
and 
copulation 
or 
the 
more

contractive version of it?
Class Participant:
The more expansive version.
Class Participant:
Gary, you gave me a question that has
been very helpful: What can I relax into
that would create a greater possibility in
sex and copulation than I never knew
existed?
Gary:
Thank you for that. I’d forgotten about
that question. That will help, but really,
it’s not about asking a question. You
have to be willing to practice it. When I
gave you that question, it was because

no one would let me talk long enough to
explain what you need to do. So practice
—and use that question. What was it
again?
Class Participant:
What can I relax into that would create
a 
greater 
possibility 
in 
sex 
and
copulation than I never knew existed?
Gary:
What physical actualization of total
relaxation into sex and copulation are
you now capable of generating,
creating, and instituting? Everything
that doesn’t allow that to show up
times a godzillion, will you destroy

and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
When I’m working and it’s getting
intense, sometimes I go and masturbate
in that contractive manner. What is that?
Gary:
You think that getting off will relax
you. But do you want to get off—or do
you want to expand your life?
Class Participant:
The second one.
Gary:

When you’re feeling that kind of
tension, go to the bathroom and stroke
yourself for fifteen minutes instead of
three and a half, and do it without getting
off, then go back to work and see how
you do. The thing is, in order to be hard,
you have to relax.
Class Participant:
Oftentimes I realize that the intensity
is not mine.
Gary:
The intensity is not yours, but you
want to relax into non-orgasmic playing
with your penis, and then when you go
out, people will look at the bulge in your

pants and start to want you. That will do
more to expand your agenda than
anything else.
Integrity with Self
Class Participant:
When I walk down the street, I often
avoid people and contract my sexual
energy. I can actually feel myself
disappear. Is it just a matter of
expanding that sexualness or being
present?
Gary:
Is it that you contract your sexual
energy and make yourself disappear? Or

is it that other people can’t be sexual at
all?
Class Participant:
The second one, yeah.
Gary:
Are you trying to entrain to the people
around you?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
entrain to the vibrational disintegrity
around 
you 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,

will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
What does disintegrity mean? How
does that work?
Gary:
Do people function from integrity—or
do they function from conclusion and
judgment?
Class Participant:
Conclusion and judgment.
Gary:

Okay, is that where you want to
function from?
Class Participant:
No. I should be functioning from
integrity, then?
Gary:
Yes. Integrity with self. You entrain
with the vibrations around you as though
the vibrations around you are what you
should be. But what you should really be
is you regardless of anything else.
Integrity is stepping into the greatness of
you without a judgment. Integrity is
being true to you.
What stupidity are you using to

create the vibrational entrainment with
the disintegrous realities other people
are 
using 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Does this come back to what you were
saying about demons? Are you saying
that when I’m around people and I make
them greater than me, I’m inviting
demons?
Gary:

If you make anyone greater than you
instead of just different than you, you
have to determine whether you’re being
a follower. Truth, are you a good
follower? I said “truth” before I asked
that question, so you have to admit
what’s true.
Class Participant:
No, not really.
Gary:
Nope, you’re a crap follower, which
is why, when you’re in a relationship,
you always get to the point where you
are pissed off. Or you make the other
person get pissed off so you can be in

the rightness of you.
Class Participant:
Can we change that now?
Gary:
Everything you’ve done to have that
as your reality, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What would it be like if you were in
integrity with you and you were being
everything you are with no apology?
Would you be more attractive or less
attractive?
Class Participant:

Who’d give a fuck?
Gary:
Exactly! You wouldn’t give a fuck,
and because you wouldn’t give a fuck,
everybody 
would 
find 
you 
very
desirable. As long as you give a fuck,
they’ll look at how they can use you,
how they can talk you into becoming
what they want you to be, and how they
can convince you that you should do
what they want you to do.
Class Participant:
Thank you for all of that. I just got that
energy, and it’s “Wow!”
Gary:

Well, guys. I think we’re done here.
Class Participants:
Thank you, Gary.
Gary:
All right, my friends, take care. Love
you lots. Talk to you soon.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
4
Become the King of
Possibilities
What if you actually are what you’ve
been pretending not to be?
What if you actually are the king of
possibility?
Gary:
Hello, gentlemen. Dr. Dain is with us

today.
The Eternal Season of
Discontent
Dain:
Hello everyone. I’m happy to be on
this call. I have to say that before we
started doing these calls, I was as
resistant to connecting with other men as
you guys are, so I think something is
changing in our world. Something is
definitely changing in mine. I hope it’s
changing in yours too.
On the one hand, you know you’re
here to change things in the world; on the
other hand, there’s a familiar discontent

that comes up in the presence of other
men. You think it won’t be there with
women, but it’s even more magnified
with women. You don’t want to see it
because women tend to have other
attributes you find…interesting, shall we
say.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, and the demons of the
eternal season of discontent you are
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
Oh, the joy.
Gary:
Oh, the misery.
Dain:
I wonder what we could actually
create together if we got over the idea
that our separation was more valuable to
us 
than 
the 
connection 
of 
the
possibilities we could create.
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, and the demons of the
eternal season of discontent you are

choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
What do you mean by discontent?
Gary:
It means you’re never truly satisfied
with 
anything. 
You 
know 
you’re
supposed to be, but you don’t actually
feel that way, and you keep trying to find
how you could feel satisfied or how it
ought to be that way, because that’s the
way you’re supposed to feel, which

actually isn’t real to you.
Class Participant:
Oh, that one.
Gary:
It’s like believing “Now that I have a
woman, I will be happy.” You guys are
always trying to be content with what
you’ve got and you never are. Why
would you want to be content? What
would be the value of that?
Class Participant:
It’s like there’s no good answer to
that.
Gary:

Why do you keep seeking contentment
instead of awareness? Contentment is
the idea that you should be satisfied with
what you can get. There is not a single
one of you who cannot get a golden
vagina 
in 
your 
life—and 
you’re
supposed to be content with the fact that
you have a vagina available to you upon
demand. You never ask: What choices
do I have here that I haven’t even
considered?
Everything that brought up times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Dain:

eternal season of discontent you are

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
Have you ever noticed that you think
you’re going to be content when you
have a woman in your life—except that
seldom works because the woman is

dedicated to making sure you are never
content? As soon as you’re feeling
content about things, the woman will say,
“Honey, we must have a talk,” which
means, what? “You’re wrong, you’re
fucked, you’re screwed,” and not in a
good way.
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, and the demons of the
eternal season of discontent you are

uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Men think that women are going to be
content with them, but they never are.
Men are always looking for how they
can create contentment with a woman,
because they think that once the woman
is content, they will finally have
contentment, as well. It doesn’t work!
A Twisted Discontent That
Creates Separation between
Men
Dain:
I’ve noticed a strange energy between
men that relates to this. It’s like a twisted
discontent 
that 
creates 
separation
between them and other men. Gary, I

know that you don’t have it with other
guys, but I’ve noticed that a lot of other
guys have it with me. I’ll meet a guy and
I can perceive that energy.
The best way I can describe it is this:
Gary told me that once he was working
with a guy, who said, “I have a problem
with Dain. I’m competing with him.”
What Gary finally got with him was that
the guy really wanted to have sex with
me, and he was creating competition
with me from that place. He’d try to
bring me down. He’d make me wrong
and badmouth me behind my back.
Can you guys imagine what else we
would have available to us if this were

to totally disappear? I don’t know about
you, but this is one of the places where I
destroy the capacities and potency I have
available. It’s the ability to walk with
my head up high and a sense of ease. I
don’t claim to have a path through this;
I’m just bringing it up because it’s
something other guys aren’t willing to be
aware of or talk about. I’m saying, “You
know what? It’s time to talk about it, it’s
time to be aware of it, and it’s time to
fucking change it, because if you’re
separating from other guys, you’re also
creating a separation between you and
you.”
If you woke up tomorrow and you

were no longer straight, no longer gay,
or no longer whatever sexuality you’ve
defined yourself as, do you realize how
much freedom that would create for you?
If you didn’t have to wake up and do the
search for the woman or a search for the
man, if you didn’t have to do the search
for sex, what else could you put your
energy into? What could you create and
generate that would create a different
possibility?
Gary:
And why would you separate you from
you? The thing is, in order to have a
fixed point of view, you have to create a
separation of you from you.

How much of what you’ve tried to
create as your sexuality is actually the
place in which you created a necessity
of being as unaware of what is
possible as you can possibly be?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create personality and sexuality as the
choice of all choices for being are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and

uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What If There Was No Sense
of Need in Your Life?
Gary:
That would be a different place to
function from. It would be a recognition
that there is no need in your life. When
you come out of the sense of need, you
no longer have to create a place in
which there is limitation. Limitation is
based on need. Why? Because need is
always about creating the smallest
common denominator you can. It’s about

inventing things. Whenever you invent
something, you use it to create an upset.
What invention are you using to
create the sexuality you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

What invention are you using to

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
That sense of discontent is why men
are always looking for a new woman.
It’s why relationships can’t exist. You
always have to be discontented with
what you have. You assume that if you
had what you thought you should have,
you’d have a different result, which is

why you can never be happy with just
one woman. And why a woman can
never be happy with just you.
Everything 
that 
is 
times

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Gary:
How many of you have tried to be
content with one woman, yet you are
always looking for another woman at the
same time?
When I was married, I kept thinking,
“There’s got to be something greater,”
then I ran into a past life experience
where I had been a famous guy and there
was a woman who kept seeking me. I
realized I had the point of view that
eventually there would be a woman who

truly loved me, truly wanted me for me,
and truly thought I was wonderful.
Unfortunately, 
that 
doesn’t 
actually
occur. That’s the fantasy world of the
insanity of possibility rather than the
truth of reality.
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, and the demons of the
eternal season of discontent you are
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Luckily none of you guys have had that

point of view.
Class Participant:
(Laughter) No.
Gary:
Yeah you have. You’re so cute. I love
you all.
Dain:

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
I’ve got a question. If you see another
guy that you judge as being similar to
you and you see him choosing more than
you, what does that do in your world?
Class Participant:
It makes me feel pathetic.
Dain:
It makes you feel pathetic, and so you
create a separation where you’re less-
than.
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:

What invention are you using to
create you as less than women are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Wow.
Dain:
What invention are you using to
create you as less than women are you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gary:
Wow, I’m going to change that:
What invention are you using to
create you as less valuable than
women are you choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Being Undefended
Dain:

Wow. That about describes it.
What invention are you using to
create you as less valuable than
women are you choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
There are two other pieces of this you
can look at. One is the invention. Ask:
What invention am I using to create the
problem with approaching women I am
choosing?
The other thing is that we defend a
position, and if you have anything to

defend, you’ll have trouble walking up
to anyone and having a conversation
with them unless you think you’re well
defended against them.
One of the things that attract women
the most is a guy who is willing to be
there totally undefended. They say, “Oh
my God, where did you come from?”
Everyone else goes up to them with the
attitude, “Hey, I’m so cool because of
this, and I’m so cool because of that.
You should see how cool I am.” Women
are used to that, and there’s a certain
amount of trickery in it that can be
entertaining to them, but you are far more
attractive to them when you’re there,

totally undefended.
Undefended doesn’t mean you’re a
pathetic little wimp. It means you have
so much awareness of you available that
you don’t have to defend against
anything. You just walk up and say, “Hi,
I know you might kick me in the nuts. I
know you may not like me. I know you
may laugh at me, but all of that is fine
with me because I know once I walk
away from here I’m going to have as
much of me as I had when I was talking
to you.” When you have to defend a
position, you don’t have that as one of
your choices.
What defended position are you

choosing that you truly could be
refusing, that if you refused to defend
it, would give you the freedom to be?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

Will She Make Me a
Valuable Product?
As long as you’re doing the sexuality
of things, you don’t have the freedom to
be. You don’t have the freedom or the
ease, because most of the time, even
before you even think about walking up

to somebody, you’re looking at, “Does
she match all of the criteria that will
make me a valuable product?” That’s the
only reason you talk to her in the first
place. Ninety percent of the time, ninety
percent of the guys aren’t even interested
in her. It’s more like “Wow, let me see.
Will this one make me valuable? Will
that one make me valuable? Will that one
over there make me valuable?” Not
“Wow, this would be fun for me.”
We take joy and fun out of the equation
and choose to do what will make us
valuable. When I was in college a long,
long time ago, I met a girl. She was the
one girl I knew I definitely could have

sex with, and I hadn’t had sex in a really
long time, so I flirted with her, and I
turned her on. She was not a girl who
would make me a valuable product. She
was fun to have sex with, but she didn’t
have the qualities that would make me a
valuable product, so after we had sex, I
tried to get her out of the house without
waking anybody up so they wouldn’t…
Gary:
Realize how ugly she was?
Dain:
Yeah, so they wouldn’t realize how
ugly she was and how mean she turned
out to be. The thing I realized in that was

“This has nothing to do with me having
fun. I’m looking for a pre-determined
outcome and I’m trying to find someone
who matches it. It has nothing to do with
me and nothing to do with her.” How
much of your sex and relationships have
you created from that place?
The Avoidance of the Joy of
Sex and Copulation
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create 
the 
absolute

total
avoidance of the joy of sex and
copulation

you 
choosing?

Back in the 1970s, I met a girl from
Sweden. The Swedes were supposedly
so much more sexually free than anybody
else in the world that I thought we’d
have a fun time together—except she
was so frigging judgmental and rigid in
her points of view. Where’s the freedom
in that?
Class Participant:
The avoidance of the joy of sex and
copulation. Is this about the standards of

morality and all the other crap that show
up in my universe?
Gary:
Everyone has the standards. They all
have the morality. Luckily for you if
you’re cute enough, you can overcome
all standards and all morality. But if you
aren’t cute enough and sexy enough, you
can’t overcome them. One day I want to
teach you how to walk so you can
overcome your own rigidity.
Class Participant:
What do you mean?
Gary:
You don’t walk like you’re enjoying

your body or you really want to fuck.
You don’t walk like you really want to
have sex. You look like you’re the image
of what would want to have sex, not
somebody who actually likes sex.
You eliminate a certain kind of energy
flow in the body so that you cannot be
that which invites the joy of sex. You can
only be that which invites the possibility
of sex. So you invite the possibility and
then you get to have two or three women
a night, which is fine. It’s great. It’s
wonderful, but where are you in the
computation?
Class Participant:

That’s right. I’m not even there.
Gary:
That’s the part that has to change.
What stupidity are you using to
create you as the prince charming who
never gets laid are you choosing?

The Turn-On You Are
How many of you, when you were a
kid, got inappropriately aroused at
different times without having a clue
why you were aroused?
Class Participant:
Yes. Lots of times.
Gary:
Yeah.
Everything you did to suppress and
repress all of that, will you destroy

and uncreate all of that? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
The reason you get aroused is because
you arouse others. When you are the
sexual energy of you, you arouse sexual
energy in other people’s bodies. You
turn other people on, and because you
turn them on, you get turned on, or at
least your body does.
How much of the turn-on you’ve
received at one time or another is a
place where you invalidated your
awareness of the turn-on you were and
the turn-on other people were toward

you? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
There’s 
serious 
unconsciousness
attached to that. When I was fifteen, I
used to get turned on in my algebra class
every day, and the teacher would call on
me. What’s the turn-on in algebra? For
years, I thought I was just frigging
strange that algebra made me horny. And
then one day I looked at it and said,
“Wow!” I didn’t realize my math teacher
was gay and I was a turn-on to him.
Once I was hard, he would try to get me

to stand up and go to the blackboard to
do an equation.
Everywhere you’re unwilling to
acknowledge the fact that you’re just
as horny as you were when you were
fifteen, and everything you’ve done to
try and suppress and repress it, will
you destroy and uncreate all of that?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I’ve got a question. Sometimes when
I’m with a woman and there’s a really
nice space between us, I get an erection.

It creates a really funky, weird place in
my universe like “I’m not a man here.”
Gary:
So when you’re out with a woman and
there’s a really nice space between you
but you’re not turned on, do you ever
acknowledge that she may not be willing
to have sex? Or that she’s willing to
have sex, but you and your body have no
desire? You think that if a woman wants
you, you have to deliver.
Class Participant:
True.
Gary:
That’s because you’re a complete and

total slut.
Dain:
Gary said it like it’s a bad thing, but I
don’t think it is.
Gary:
I do not have a point of view that
being a slut is a bad thing, but unless you
acknowledge that you’re a slut, when
somebody wants you, you’ll go there no
matter what they look like. Dain was
talking about the girl that he had sex with
because he knew it would be easy. Easy
means it doesn’t cost you anything, so
you go there. You guys keep trying to
say, “Yes, but she must meet my

standards.” Your standards are the things
you use to avoid what you could choose.
What invention of standards are you
using to avoid what you could be
choosing that would be easy and fun?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
This thing about thinking that you have
to deliver, does that have to do with a
standard too?
Gary:

No, that has to do more with being a
prince charming. If you’re not married,
you have to be a prince. Once you’re
married, you’re a slave. You never get to
be king.
Class Participant:
Unfortunately.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to avoid
being the king you could be choosing?
The nice thing about being a king is that
kings can be dirty, they can be smelly,
they can be all kinds of things, and they
still get whatever they want.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
We’re talking about hard-ons and
erections and feeling sexual. I had my
bars run yesterday by an older lady, and
I had a really nice erection while she
was running my bars. This happens a lot
of times. Does this mean that she would
like to have sex with me? Or is it that
I’m arousing her or that I’m aroused by
her? What do you make of that?
Dain:

Yes.
Gary:
That’s correct, yes. I’m sorry. You’re
a man. You have a penis. You’re
breathing. You want to get an erection.
It’s a given. When are you most useful?
When you’re hard as a rock. When are
you useless? When you’re not. Most men
try to avoid that kind of sexual energy.
The older lady was looking at you and
thinking, “Could I please have this?” and
your body went, “Ooh, thanks. Here, I’ll
show you how good it would be,” so you
got a hard-on. It’s not that you wanted
her. It’s the fact that she wanted you and
you were willing to receive it from her

because she’s not your standard.
Dain:
It’s also part of the energy of living.
When you’re living, you’re turned on.
When you’re dying, you’re not. Most
people on the planet are dying, so we
don’t know what it is to be turned on as
a matter of course and a matter of life
and living. Really, it is the energy of
living no matter how much someone or
something else has tried to beat it out of
you.
Class Participant:
Going back to when we were fifteen, I
used to get hard-ons all the time—on the

bus, going home on the train, wherever. I
was just turned on by life and living.
Now it seems to be more irregular. It
doesn’t happen as much. It would be
great to go back to that time when I got
hard-ons more regularly and I was more
aroused by life and living.
The Ultimate Arousal
Gary:
Yes, that’s the ultimate arousal—life
and living. The ultimate arousal is
someone who’s willing to live. The
older lady was willing to live and she
looked at you as a possibility for living
even better. When you’re fifteen, there

are a lot of people who lust after you
and you don’t notice because you’re not
supposed to notice that kind of stuff; you
think it means you’d have to do
something about it. But it doesn’t mean
you have to do anything about it. It just
means that people are lusting after you.
How much energy are you using to
make sure lust never comes after you
and never permeates your life, your
living, your reality, or your hard-on?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.

Dain:
It would be bad if you actually had
lust permeate your reality again. When
you were a teenager, it was out of
control. And you were like Gary in his
algebra class, going, “Oh my God!” He
was thinking, “Oh no! Got another hard-
on,” and then of course, the teacher
would call on him and he’d think, “No! I
don’t understand math.”
Gary:
“I don’t know the answer. I have no
idea. No, I can’t do that problem.” I
made myself inept in that area of my life.
I was algebraically challenged because I

didn’t want to stand up and show my
hard-on.
Dain:
What would have been cool is living
in a reality where he could have stood
up and showed his hard-on. “Hey, I have
a cool thing going on right now. I have
such a hard-on I am just about to lose it
all over everyone. What was it you
wanted 
to 
know 
about 
quadratic
equations again?” What if we lived in a
reality where that were possible? When
you consider that possibility, you realize
how far we are from being able to have
and be whatever is going on for us and
our bodies at the moment. We are so

dynamically cut off from our bodies. If
we didn’t have to do that, what else
would be possible?
Gary:
What invention am I using to avoid
the hard-on I could be choosing?

Class Participant:
This call is making me feel really
turned on.
Gary:

If you had a hard-on for life and
living, would that give you more
creation and more generation than you
currently have?
Class Participant:
Oh, hell yeah!
Gary:
If you’re not willing to have that place
where lust, the joy of living, and the joy
of copulation are part of your reality,
you’re not willing to have a way of
living in a generative and creative
capacity. An orgasmic quality of living
comes from a willingness to have the
intensity of lust and the creative juices

that come with orgasm.

Have any of you noticed you might be
getting just a little bit excited about life

Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
How many of you have noticed that

when you have a hard-on, it makes you
really feel good?
Dain:
It’s kind of a happy time. It’s like “Oh,
hi!”
Gary:
It’s a happy, sloppy time.

find yourself getting excited about life

Gary:
When you’re fifteen, you’re excited

about life and depressed at the same
time. You’re grateful when you have a

important as long as you have a hard-on.

Sex Is a Life Force

Class Participant:
That’s like my life at the moment.
When I’m not having sex, or not
masturbating, or not having a hard-on,
everything else seems to pale in
significance.
Gary:
Yes I know. Why is that? Do you have
any clue?
Class Participant:
No, why is that?
Gary:
When you get a hard-on, you get the
life force that exists with you and your
body. Sex is a life force. It’s something

that gives you the awareness of
possibilities of creating and generating
beyond the limits of this reality—but
that’s not the way it’s presented to us in
this reality. It’s presented as a rightness
or a wrongness, not as an energy that
insists on life and living. Sex is treated
as something that requires us to limit life
and living.
Class Participant:
This is doing my head in.

That’s a good thing. Now if it did both

Seeing You as Valuable
Class Participant:
Lately I’ve been waiting for women to
choose instead of choosing for me. Will
these clearings help with that?
Gary:
The clearing about being valuable,
“What invention are you using to create
women as more valuable than you are
you choosing?” will create the most

change. This is where you can change
the places where you look to how the
woman is valuable instead of you. You
don’t see you as valuable.
Class Participant:
I know.
Gary:
When you don’t see you as valuable,
you come at women with a disgusting,
slutty kind of energy that is pernicious
and not nice. It gives women the point of
view that you’re some kind of pervert.
It’s not an invitation for them to come to
you. It’s like you’re trying to go to them.
Does that make sense?

Class Participant:
I met a woman and in the beginning, I
was the valuable product. I was pulling
energy and I was just me, and then after
a while it was “Oh, I’m back to my old
patterns again.” I don’t know how to get
around that.

What Will It Take for This
Relationship to Work?
Class Participant:
Thank you. I listened to a Gentlemen’s
Club call from Australia, and somebody
asked, “How do I create a relationship?”
You said something like, “The woman
creates her idea of the relationship and
the man creates his idea of the
relationship, and if they try to make them
go together, it doesn’t work.”
Gary:
Basically what it boils down to is

this: You try to see how you fit into the
woman’s world in order to create a
relationship with her. She tries to see
how you could fit into her world, which
is relationship to her, and none of it is
about being present with “What’s
actually going to work here?”
You begin to invent beautiful, romantic
pictures of the two of you together.
You’re 
smiling 
and 
kissing, 
and
everything is perfect. You say, “Oh,
she’s perfect. This is going to be
perfect.” Are those questions? No!
“Everything’s going to work out fine. I
can’t wait to see how this works out.”
None of it is a question. The invention of

the idea of a perfect relationship is not
the awareness of the relationship you
actually do have. You’re creating an
upset for you or an upset for her, one of
the two, rather than seeing what’s
actually possible.
You’ve got to ask:
• What will it take for this relationship
to work?
• What’s going on here and what
would I like this to be?
The Subtlety of Awareness
You Actually Have
Dain:

It’s based on conclusion rather than
the subtlety of awareness you actually
have. You have a subtlety of awareness.
It’s the awareness of every subtlety of
energy that is. It’s an awareness of what
is possible, what is not possible, what’s
possible with someone, and what isn’t.
We’ve been taught to go to conclusion
instead of awareness, and when you go
to conclusion, you cut off all of the
subtleties of awareness that you have;
you cut off all you can see and all you
can perceive. All you can do is function
from the conclusion you have. When you
think about a girl, if you allow yourself
to ask a question, you’ll have a lightness,

you’ll have a heaviness, or you’ll have a
sort of twisting thing that goes on, and
you can ask, “Okay, is this the subtlety of
my awareness?” If it is, then it becomes
detective work to find out what that
something is. If you see that you’ve come
to a lot of conclusions, you can ask:
What can I change now to make this
different? Or is this even capable of
being changed?
Gary:
This is the question you have to go to.
Most guys go to conclusion: “Oh, this
woman is wonderful. This woman is
great. She’s everything I ever wanted,”
and what question is that?

Class Participant:
None.
Gary:
Not having question is more real to us.
We invent the idea that this is the way
something has to be rather than asking,
“What can this be? What would I really
like it to be that I haven’t even
perceived?”
Class Participant:
Recently I was listening to The Place
for the second time, and I just cried. It
was “I know this is possible. How the
hell do I get there?”
Gary:

Yeah, I know. For me, that’s the reality
too. Ask: What is really possible I
haven’t considered here?
Dain:
And what if it were possible to
actually create it as a living, breathing
reality rather than all of the stuff we’ve
tried to make real that we all know is not
real?

Gary:
Isn’t that amazing? Being a hard-on,
even more than having a hard-on, is
what the reality is. When you have a
hard-on, it is the one time you’re most
willing to go after something like having
a greater life. You’re always looking for
“Where can I put this thing? What else
can I do with this?” The only time you
go into question is when you have a

hard-on.
Dain:
But it’s also the one time you go into
absolutely no question.
Gary:
It’s the time where you come to
serious frigging conclusions, as well.
Class Participant:
It’s a very strong demand when you
have a hard-on.
Gary:
Yes. It’s a very strong demand. What if
you were willing to have your desire
and not your demand? What would that

be like?
Gary:
If you used that same energy to create
a different possibility, what would life
be like?

forever.

Gary:
This is the forever process. Put this on
a loop, especially if you’re sleeping next
to a woman. She might get a hard-on and
get after you in the morning. If she gets a
hard-on and it’s a hard-on in her clit,
she’ll want to have sex with you.

I can feel all of your bodies saying,
“Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!” Do you realize how

much of your body you’re trying to turn
off? That’s how we create aging. That’s
why you’re never an eternal boy—
you’re using the turning off of your hard-
on to age your body and make it less real
and less valuable to have one. Do you
want to youthenize? Run this process.

That’s interesting. We were doing
“What stupidity are you using?” now
we’re doing “What invention are you
using?”
Gary:
You’ve made yourself unaware of
things, but now it’s not just the
unawareness that we choose; it’s the
place where we invent things we have
chosen as somehow more real than our
capacity to choose something different,
so that’s part of it, but it’s slightly
different too.

Any of you feel like you have more
blood coursing through your body?
Class Participant:
There’s something about suppressing
the life energy, and all of that that comes
up because it would be inappropriate to
have a hard-on all of the time.
Gary:
You are wrong. It would not be
inappropriate for you to have a hard-on

all the time. It would be an invitation for
more women to use you.
Dain:
Aha.
Gary:
If you don’t have a hard-on, you’re not
useful, are you?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
If you don’t avoid the hard-on you are,
you become a more useful person in
other people’s lives, and in order for
you to see yourself as not valuable you

have to become useless, right? So you
might get that avoiding the hard-on you
could be choosing is affecting all areas
of your life.
Class Participant:
It totally does. It’s like I am keeping it
until it can be unleashed in the
appropriate moment. Not all of life. Like
the image of standard morality in men.
Gary:
Like having a hard-on for life is
different from having a sexually hard
rod, as it were. There are so many areas
of your life that you suppress because it
is not acceptable for you to have a hard-

on. You won’t let yourself have that
enthusiastic element in your life and
living, which means you won’t allow
yourself to be.
Class Participant:
Exactly. Wow.
Gary:

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
If you’re willing to be a hard-on,

you’re willing to be the energy that
creates a hard-on. You’re being the
energy that creates and generates. If
you’re being less than that, you’re trying
to institute whatever the woman wants
you to do or be, which isn’t choosing to
be you.
This is the place where men cut
themselves off from being an energy that
gives what can be received but doesn’t
have to give what can’t be received,
which is what you are if you’re willing
to be that hard-on. If you’re not willing
to be that, then you have to defend her
point of view, refuse to give what she
can receive, and refuse to be what can

be received.
If you’re willing to be the kind of
energy that is an invitation—because
having a hard-on is an invitation. If the
person can receive it, great. If the person
can’t receive it, is it wrong that you have
a hard-on?
For some reason you don’t seem to get
that being a hard-on is an invitation. It
doesn’t mean that people have to take it.
It just means it’s an invitation. What if
you were just hot and that was the
beginning of the possibility of the energy
of sex, copulation, and the hard dick? If
you had that kind of energy of being “I’m
ready to go when you’re ready to go”

would that be a different energy and a
different 
invitation 
than 
“There’s
something wrong with me because I have
a hard dick”?
Class Participant:
Yeah. Can you talk more about that?
Gary:
Yeah. You have that available to you
when you’re willing to have that kind of
energy flow. But you’ve turned it into “a
hard dick to be able to fuck somebody.”
You have to be willing to create what
will create something greater.
Step into the Role of the

King
Dain:
When you are willing to create
something greater, you take yourself out
of the role of the prince. The prince is
the one who gets to play around and let
the world happen around him, and if he
gets laid, he’s happy and that’s enough.
You have to step into the role of the king.
That’s where you realize it’s up to you to
create the reality around you. Nobody
else is going to do it for you. Nobody
else is going to be responsible for you.
They will try to bring you down and they
will judge you, but it’s irrelevant.

You’re the fucking king. And so instead
of living your life believing that you are
flotsam and jetsam and that as long as
you get laid, everything is okay, you ask,
“What am I creating here?”
If you’re willing to be the king and the
hard-on that you’ve been refusing to be,
you realize you are a creative force and
a creative control in the world that
you’ve been refusing to be. If you look at
how much crap we do about women—
whether they like us, whether we’re
getting laid, whether somebody else is
getting laid more than we are, whether
we’re getting laid less, and blah, blah,
blah—all of that is the crap we use to

keep us from being the creative,
generative being we actually are.
What invention are you using to
create you as not the creative,
generative source, force, and control
you could be choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Gary:
There’s something else we need to
add: 
“source, 
force, 
control, 
and
generative energy.”

Dain:
What stupidity are you using to
create the inventions, the artificial
intensities, and the demons of never
being the creative, generative, source,
force, 
control, 
contribution, 
and
generative capacity you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Wow. That one is a rocket.
Class Participant:

Is this also connected to the image
thing?
Gary:
You 
try 
to 
create 
yourself 
as
somebody who looks like rather than
somebody who is. You want to look like
a shag master. You want to look like
what you think a woman is going to
want. You want to look like somebody
who is successful. You want to look like
somebody who is valuable, but being
those things and looking like them are
two different worlds.
What If You Were Willing to
Be the King of Possibilities?

Dain:
You have to be aware that the world is
going to look at you in all kinds of
different ways. People, are going to look
at you in all kinds of ways. You have to
know what your aim is, what your target
is, and what’s actually true for you.
I don’t know about you guys, but I’ve
been doing the prince charming thing for
a long time. It seemed like an ideal place
to be, and I’m realizing at this point that
it’s not enough for me. I don’t know if
it’s enough for you. I don’t know if
you’ve looked at the place I was
functioning from and said, “Wow, that
would be enough for me. Let me take his

spot.”
What if you could realize that in your
own 
world, 
even 
in 
comparing
yourselves to whomever you compare
yourselves to—the comparisons to me,
the 
comparisons 
to 
Gary, 
the
comparisons to anybody else? Are those
enough 
for 
you? 
Maybe 
there’s
something far greater in being the
creative, 
generative 
source, 
force,
control, and capacity we are that takes
us beyond the prince thing we’ve been
doing, where we’re happy to have any
woman who will have us.
What if we were being the king of
possibilities?

Gary:
Oh! Good one!
What stupidity are you using to
create the invention and the artificial
intensity of avoiding being the king of
possibilities you could be choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Have I told you how much I love it
when you open your mouth, Dain?
Class Participant:
Is 
this 
also 
where 
we 
create

separation and competition between
men, when we look at someone else and
say, “Ooh, wow!” and we make
ourselves smaller?
Dain:
Yes, because if you realized you were
the king of possibilities, you would have
a totally different view of you. It would
be “I’m sorry. I would compete with
whom?” You’d be able to see where
other kings in their own right could be a
contribution, a gifting, and a receiving in
this creative, generative capacity and the
force, source, and control of something
different.

We don’t usually use the words force,
source, and control as something to
embrace, but this is a place where we
men haven’t been willing to embrace our
natural capacities. If you did embrace
those capacities, what else would be
possible? And what if the way out of the
competition you’ve been doing with me,
other men in Access Consciousness, or
men outside of Access is to recognize
that you have a greater capacity than
you’ve been willing to acknowledge?
What if you actually are what you’ve
been pretending not to be? What if you
actually are the king of possibilities?
And if you are willing to be that, would

that eliminate the competition with other
men in your world?
Gary:
There 
is 
no 
real 
competition.
Competition is a lie. Competition is
what you do on the playing field for
sports. 
More 
than 
anything 
else,
competition between men is a way you
never have to claim the totality of you.
It’s a way you guarantee you don’t have
to choose the greatness of you. It is a
place where you get to choose against
other men as though doing that is finding
you, rather than seeing what’s actually
possible and how you could work for
you.

Have you ever had the experience of
working with another man, and it was so
cohesive 
and 
easy 
that 
you 
got
everything done really quickly?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
That’s because there is no real
competition. If there were, there would
never be a situation where men could
cooperate with one another. And I see
many instances of men cooperating with
men very easily. What would it be like if
you were willing to have a whole
different world? I’d like you all to put

this on a loop:
What 
energy, 
space, 
and
consciousness can I be that would
allow 
me 
to 
be 
the 
king 
of
possibilities I truly be for all eternity?
Everything that doesn’t allow that
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Dain:
Let’s play, gentlemen. Let’s create a
different reality.
Gary:
Yeah. Let’s have a whole bunch of

kings of possibilities instead of queens
of stupidity.
Dain:
And princes of inanity.
Gary:
And princes of invisibility.
Dain:
So please run these processes, guys.
Thank you so much for you. What else is
possible for us to create together?
Gary:
Thanks so much for being on this call.
You guys rock.
Class Participants:

Thank you!

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
5
The Phenomenal Sex,
Copulation, and
Relationship You
Could Be Choosing
If you were willing to work from the
point of view of the greatest possibility
and the greatest choice rather than
from the wrongness of your point of

view, what else might be possible?
Gary:
Hello, gentlemen.
Creating Demon-
Augmented Occurrences
Recently Dain and I noticed that when
women go after men, the guys cut off
their awareness in order to get laid.
They never question whether it’s what
they want or whether it will make their
life better.
You say things like, “Well, it just
happened,” “I couldn’t help myself,” “I
slipped,” or “It occurred by accident,”

but that’s not the way it is. You think that
if it can occur, it should occur; therefore,
you invite demons in to make sure it
does occur.
What stupidity are you using to
create 
the 
demon-augmented
occurrences 
you 
are 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
What do you mean by “invite demons
in”?

Gary:
You must invite demons in, in order to
create 
the 
power 
you 
have 
as
powerlessness. None of you have been
powerless in the face of your dick, have
you?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
It’s like you’re always powerless. As
soon as your dick starts to get filled with
energy, it’s as if there is no brain
available. You have a single digit IQ.
This works on other areas of life too.
Any time you say, “Well, this just

occurred” or “I couldn’t help it,” you’re
inviting demons to make sure you’re not
responsible for anything that occurred.
Anywhere you say, “Uh, I don’t know
how this happened,” is a lie. That’s what
you do to make sure you are not in
control and you have no capacity to
create anything. You become the effect of
everything that occurs around you.
What stupidity are you using to
create 
the 
demon-augmented
occurrences 
you 
are 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
Well, the good news is you guys have
been demon augmented ever since you
got a penis!
Class Participant:
What does augmented mean?
Gary:
Augmented means the demons come in
and help you with being stupid. They
help you with being less aware. They
help you put yourself in a bad situation.
They help make sure that you don’t have
any idea what’s really going to happen,
which is why bad things occur that
you’re not happy with. It can be with

money, it can be with sex—but usually
for you guys, it’s with sex. I love you all,
and you’re a bunch of dicks looking for a
place to happen.
What stupidity are you using to
create 
the 
demon-augmented
occurrences 
you 
are 
choosing?

Class Participant:
My partner and I are going our
separate ways. We’re moving house and

stuff. After Dain’s Energetic Synthesis of
Being class, I was so clear on what I
would like to create and generate, and
I’ve come back to move out of the house
my partner and I share. But when I
walked into the house, I hit a brick wall.
Is that a demon-augmented occurrence?
Gary:
Are you willing to see what’s true for
you? And remember I thought “truth”
before I asked that.
Class Participant:
I was until I walked into the house,
and now I’m unhappy.
Gary:

Yeah, because you have realized what
you’ve been living with the whole time.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
Once you get clear that you want to do
something else, you suddenly become
aware, finally, of all the things you’ve
been shutting out of your awareness in
order to maintain what you have. You
have the occurrence of the relationship
as it is, where you cut off your
awareness to make sure you continue to
have something the way it is.
Class Participant:

So I’m just more aware of where I’ve
stuck myself?
Gary:
Yeah. You’re aware of what you were
refusing to be aware of before. Any time
your penis is involved, any time you go
into relationship of any kind, you go to
the believable and credible relationship.
You don’t choose the unreal and
unbelievable relationship. Why is it that
you want a relationship that is credible
and believable?
Class Participant:
Yeah, that just hooks you back into this
reality.

Gary:
Yeah. It brings you back into this
reality. It sticks you with this reality
instead of giving you a choice of a
different reality. Why would you not
want a different choice?
Class Participant:
Oh, I do.
Gary:
If you had choice, if you were actually
choosing and you had choice and
awareness, you wouldn’t let demon-
augmented occurrences take control of
your life. But you let demon-augmented
occurrences control your life. You say,

“Oh, I lost this money. I fell out of this
money.” You act like there is no choice
when there is.

you 
are 
choosing?

It Didn’t “Just Happen”
When you suddenly decide you want
to have sex with somebody, it’s not an
accident. It’s not something that just
occurred. It didn’t just happen. Those

women go after you. Is that at all real to
you? I watch people. The other day in a
class, I watched a woman go after a guy.
It was obvious she was after him, and it
was ridiculously ugly the way things
were being done. He couldn’t see it at
all because demons augmented the
occurrence. He didn’t have a clue that he
could actually induce his own death by
the choice he was making.
Class Participant:
Do we choose that from the moment a
girl starts going after us?
Gary:
Yeah. You choose it when she starts

putting her snail tracks on you. This guy
and girl were going out to lunch. I saw
them and I thought, “Oh, poor sucker. He
is doomed.” This girl was mean and evil
and I knew she was going to do mean
and evil things to him. But his agenda got
hard, his brain went away, and he had a
demon-augmented 
occurrence 
called
“the love of the sex.” He shined
everybody else on to be with her.
Everything he promised to do for others,
he refused to do. Everything he said he
was going to accomplish, everything that
made up his business, his life, and his
friendships with everybody in the world
was lost in favor of the golden vagina

that was sliming all over his world.
Class Participant:
Wow.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Have I been using my relationship to
defend against women doing that to me?
Gary:
Well, you’ve been defending against

it. First of all it’s not whether women do
it to you. Men will do it to you too.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
You’re defending against anything that
would give you choice.
Class Participant:
I’m going cross-eyed now. What do
you mean by that?
Gary:
If you define yourself as gay or
straight, or if you have any particular
sexuality, you create a set of judgments

to guarantee that definition and make it
real. You defend against anything that
challenges that or puts you in a place
where you could question it.
What if the best relationship you had
was with a good friend? Years ago I had
a friend I was really close with. We did
everything together. It was really fun. He
was smart and bright and funny, and we
had a great time together. Then he got a
girlfriend. He dumped me like some kind
of cheap suit, and I said, “Uh, wait a
minute! We were so close and now he
can’t even talk to me?”
They broke up and he called me. He
wanted to get together to be friends

again. He said, “Hey, let’s rev up our
friendship.”
I said, “No, because the next time you
get a girl, you’ll dump me again. I’m not
interested.” He was willing to destroy
his friendship with me in order to have
an exclusive relationship with a girl. He
thought that relationship was the most
important.
Are you willing to shine on your
friends for the vagina that’s currently
sliming you? That’s what you do,
whether you have a commitment to do
something or not.
Class Participant:

And even the commitments to yourself.
Gary:
More than anything, the commitments
to yourself. Going against what you
committed to is like saying, “She’s more
important. Everything she has is more
important than my own life.”
Class Participant:
And once you lose that commitment to
yourself...
Gary:
That’s where you start to bring in
death. That’s where you induce death.
Here’s another process I want you guys
to run on your own:

What seduction am I using to create
the induction of death I am choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
We allow ourselves to be seduced to
die. The guy I was just talking about was
seduced into giving up all of his other
friends, people who had supported him
and loved him, in favor of the woman.
That’s all she cared about. When she left
him, she felt like a million dollars; he
felt like a pile of shit.
What seduction am I using to create

the induction of death I am choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Please put this on a loop and run it
nonstop, gentlemen. You have to get to
the place where you’re not seduced into
giving up your life for a woman just
because she wants you.
“I Want Him to Give Up His
Life for Me”
Years ago I was doing a class and a
couple was there. I asked the woman,

“What do you want of him?” and she
said, “I want him to give up his life for
me.”
I said, “What?!” Everyone else in the
room said, “Oh, isn’t that sweet?”
I said, “Sweet? You want the guy to
give up his life for you? Basically
you’re saying he should do everything
you want, he should do whatever you
require and desire, and he should have
no life of his own.”
She said, “Yeah.”
This is the way most relationships are
created. I asked, “Why do people think
this is a good thing?” You have to be

willing to see what you really want to
have as your reality and what you want
to have in a relationship.
Who or what are you willing to give
you away to that if you didn’t give you
away to it, would give you all of you?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Do we create the seduction into the
induction of death by giving ourselves
away?

Gary:
Yeah. You give you away in order to
create it.
What stupidity are you using to
create the defense against the unreal,

fantastic,

Dain was with a lady the other day.
She said, “I think we should spend a
couple of days together.”

He asked, “Why?”
She said, “So we can get to know each
other better.”
He said, “But I don’t need to do that. I
know you.” He’s willing to know. She
was not willing to know. She wanted to
spend time together because her point of
view was you have to spend time to get
to know somebody. What if you didn’t
have to spend time to get to know
somebody? What if you could just know
them?
Who or what are you willing to give
you away for that if you didn’t give
you away for it, would give you all of
you? Everything that is times a

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
When we “spend a couple of days to
get to know someone,” isn’t that where
we find ways we can cut ourselves off to
fit into their reality?
Gary:
Yeah. That’s where you can induce
your death in favor of their life.
How many of you would give up
your life to have a woman? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you

destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Romance
Class Participant:
Is giving yourself away what they call
romance in this reality? Is that what’s
called romantic?
Gary:
Well, what is called romance is
having the fun and the joy of doing what
stimulates you and the woman you’re
with, who creates some illusion that

you’re going to have something greater.
Romance is what you use as a stimulant
for creating a woman’s response.
I personally like romance. I like
dinners and looking into their eyes
longingly, giving them flowers, having
nice wine and music, talking to them,
and 
asking 
them 
questions 
about
themselves nonstop and never telling
them anything about me. At the end of the
evening when they say, “Wow, you’re the
most interesting man I’ve ever met,” I
know I’m going to get laid. I’m more
pragmatic than you guys. I know what my
target is. You think your target is to get a
woman. How many of you have gotten a

woman and then been happy with her
afterwards?
You do romance to stimulate a woman
to let down her barriers and give you
what you want. You don’t give yourself
up to get the woman. You guys would
give up anything to get a vagina. If she
says, “I want you to bark like a dog,”
you’ll frigging bark like a dog. You’ll do
anything she asks because she has the
vagina.
How much of you have you given up
your whole life for a vagina?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Who or what are you willing to give
you up for, that if you weren’t willing
to give you up for it, would allow you
to have all of you? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
“I Seem to Attract Married
Women”
Class Participant:
I seem to attract married women who
are seeking fun times with me and then I

go into the wrongness of giving them my
body. I go into the wrongness of what it
will create afterwards with the husband,
and so on. I would like to know what
your take on this is and how you would
deal with it.
Gary:
Married women who aren’t happy in
their lives will do anything to get a man
they can have sex with. Are they actually
going to leave their husbands for you?
That would be a no. Why are they doing
it? They are choosing you because
you’re safe and because you’re not
willing to make a commitment to them.
The married women who are coming

after you are more masculine in their
point of view than they are feminine.
Most women will go after another
woman’s husband. Are you a husband?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
Are you just a shag?
Class Participant:
Possibly, yes. I’d like to not go into
the wrongness of it and have a bit of fun,
but I keep thinking of what it could
create afterwards for them and their…
Gary:

Are you a humanoid man?
Class Participant:
I believe so.
Gary:
Humanoid men don’t like to go after
married women because they don’t want
to screw up another man’s gig.
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
But you’ve got to look at it for real. Is
the gig already screwed up? Yes or no?
Class Participant:
Yes.

Gary:
Is it real that you need to have a
problem? Or are you trying to create a
problem to justify that you, as the
humanoid man you are, can’t believe it
can be right for you to have sex with a
married woman?
Class Participant:
Yep, That’s it.
Gary:
You’re creating a demon-augmented
occurrence. Here’s a process you need
to run. It will get you clear about the fact
that if a married woman comes after you,
it’s because she has decided she wants

out of her marriage and she’s looking at
you as the source. Now if that were the
case, you’d have to have a load of
money and a well-paying job and you’d
have to appear to be somebody who had
more than you have. Would that be
accurate?
What seduction are you using to create
the induction of death you are choosing?
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:

Well, I’ve got a really good job.
Gary:
Are you handy eye candy?
Class Participant:
It depends whose eyes are looking at
me. Sure. Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder. I don’t know. I don’t know
about that. You’d have to ask them.
Gary:
You’ve got to admit what you are and
stop trying to be what you think you’re
supposed to be. If you’re just a dick that
gets to be used, then be a dick that gets
to be used and enjoy the fuck out of
being used. In reality, that’s what most

young guys are. Married women tend to
go after young guys that they consider a
dick they can use. Why do they choose
handy eye candy? Because they beat
their husbands up so much at home that
their husbands don’t want to have sex
anymore.
You have to be bluntly honest with
yourself, guys, as to what you are. If
you’re a slut, you’re a slut. It’s not a
wrongness; it’s just something you are.
Stop trying to create something that’s not
real for you. You have to look at what’s
real for you—not what’s real for others.
What seduction are you using to
induce the death you are choosing?

Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

Every time you go into judgment, you
go into death. You’re inducing death
every time you go to judgment.
Are You Giving Up You?
Let’s take the friend I was talking
about. By the way, this is not Dain. This
is a different friend. Everybody always
thinks that when I talk about a friend, I’m
talking about Dain. No, I’m not. When
this guy went for it with that woman, he

created upsets with all the people he had
agreed to do things with and for. He
gave up his own life in favor of her and
her point of view of what she wanted.
That stopped a lot of the forward motion
in his life that was creating money,
possibility, and choices. It took him
about two years to turn things around.
Every time you choose to go against
you, you can be seduced out of what is
an awareness for you and you set things
up in such a way that you end up giving
up everything you’ve started in favor of
what you’ve got. You lose your entire
future when you do that.
What seduction are you using to

induce the death you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

Class Participant:
Gary, I’m having an “Oh my God”
moment. Is that what I’ve been doing in
the last year?
Gary:
Yeah, you’ve been trying to adjust
yourself to the person you’re with to
make her happy. That’s a justification; it
is not real. You aren’t doing it to make

her happy. You’re doing it to give you
up. You’re doing it to kill you. How
much of you do you care about? Slim to
none.
Class Participant:
Well, obviously I didn’t.
Gary:
Everything 
that

Class Participant:
Will this seduction process help get
me back out there in the world to create

and generate what I would like?
Gary:
Hopefully. You’ll at least start to be
able to see what you’d like. You won’t
be seduced into the idea that “She won’t
be happy with me if I do this.” You
won’t seduce yourself into not doing
something as though that’s going to make
her happy. It doesn’t make her happy.
Nothing makes a woman happy except
when she decides to be happy. And
nothing makes a man happy except
giving himself up for a vagina. He thinks
he’s happy when he does that, but at the
end of it, he’s fucked up, miserable, and
wants to kill himself. How’s that

working for you, gentlemen?
Class Participant:
Not well!

Have any of you ever noticed that
when you go into relationships, you get
into a start-and-stop thing with your
whole life? You’ll start down some

road, get invested in a woman, and then
the next thing you know, you’re giving up
everything you started to create in favor
of being with her. Why would you do
that?
Who or what are you willing to give
yourself away for or to, that if you
didn’t give yourself away for or to it,
would allow you to have all of you?

Inculcation of Realities
Class Participant:
Dain was talking to me the other day
about the way I inculcate others’ reality.
I grab someone’s reality and blend it
through mine.
Gary:
Inculcating is where you put all of the
parts and pieces of both of you together
and place them in a blender and try to

come out with the two of you being the
same. It’s the way most people try to
create relationships.
We think we have to create a
relationship by blending our realities
and coming out with something that is
palatable to both of us. Except the only
part you get is her shit, and the only part
she gets is your gold. You’ll take her shit
in exchange for your gold all the time.
What?
Class Participant:
Is that what people do with families as
well?
Gary:

That’s what people do with families.
Class Participant:
Cults?
Gary:
Cults and religions—and anything
where you try to fit in. Unfortunately,
most of you are crap at fitting in,
because you’re way too willing to be
leaders rather than followers. In reality,
you’re all like kittens. Nobody can
control you, but you keep trying to
pretend that somehow you can be
controlled. It doesn’t work, but if you’re
happy with it, fine. If it makes you
happy, feel free. Fuck yourselves over

and feel good about it.
There’s also exculcating, which is
where, instead of you and your partner
trying to blend together all the parts and
pieces of yourselves, you try to separate
all that stuff. You are the oil and the
water instead of the choice.
Intertwining of beingness is where
you’re so close to somebody that you
hear 
and 
perceive 
what 
they’re
unwilling to hear and perceive. Dain and
I are very close, and when he refuses to
see what’s actually possible, I always
get to see it and know it.
For me, it’s seeing where the person
needs to understand what’s really going

on and look from a different place. For
example, I would pick up strange shit
from the girls Dain was having sex with
about how they didn’t want him to be
with anybody else. I would think “Oh my
God. I don’t want Dain to be with
anybody else,” and then I’d say, “But
he’s not with me! What is this?”
I knew what he wasn’t willing to
receive. I’m willing to know a lot of
things. I knew that the guy who was in
the class was being slimed by the
woman. I could see exactly what was
going on, but he wouldn’t see it no
matter what was said to him, so I kept
my mouth shut and let him go down the

road to killing himself so he could have
that opportunity yet again. It wasn’t his
best choice. You don’t want to go down
those roads.
Class Participant:
And choice creates awareness.
Gary:
Choice does create awareness. He
chose. He got a lot of awareness. It
wasn’t the awareness he wanted, but he
got a lot of awareness.
What stupidity are you using to
create the inculcation of realities as
relationship 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,

will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

Years ago when I got divorced, there
was a lady who said, “I can’t wait until
we can spend time together.”
I asked, “What do you mean?”
She said, “Well, I figure we’ll spend
seventy-five percent of our time together
from here on out.”
I said, “Seventy-five percent of our
time? Let’s see, in a twenty-four hour
day that means I’m spending eighteen
hours with you? I don’t like to spend

eighteen hours with anybody. I don’t
want to spend eighteen hours with
somebody.”
How many hours would you actually
like to spend with somebody—and to be
totally present with them the whole
time? If you say more than two and a half
hours, you’re lying.
Class Participant:
Yeah. Two or three hours.
Class Participant:
Three and a half hours a week.
Gary:
The time you want to spend with
someone is about ten percent of the time

that you have in a day, because that
means you’re totally present for them.
They’re totally present for you. How
many of you could be totally present for
somebody where you are in no judgment,
no conclusion, no consideration, but just
being there, totally in question and in
presence? How many of you can do that
for longer than two and a half hours?
Class Participant:
Two and half hours seems pretty long.
Gary:
Most of you want to be with someone
until you cum, then you’re ready to go
away.

Be Honest about Where You
Are in Your Life
Gary:
Guys, be honest with yourself. If
you’re a dick looking for a place to
happen, then you’re a dick looking for a
place to happen. That doesn’t make it
wrong or right or anything else. It’s just

that you’re a dick looking for a place to
happen.
You’ve got to be honest about where
you are in life. What kind of person you
are. What’s really important to you.
What you want to create. If you’re
willing to do that, you ask, “Okay, how
can I use this?” instead of “How can I
abuse me with this?” Being a shag
master and a slut are considered bad
things in this reality, but what if they
were the greatest power you had
available to you? If you were willing to
work from the point of view of the
greatest possibility and the greatest
choice rather than from the wrongness of

your point of view, what else might be
possible?
Class Participant:
It’s like I’m using “I’m a slut” as a
justification to kill myself.
Gary:
Yeah, it’s using “slut” as justification
instead of saying, “Okay, I’m a slut. I
will have sex with anybody. How can I
use this to create my life?” It’s not “How
can I use this to destroy my life, to kill
myself?”
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You are a shag master. It’s just what
you are. You can use that to induce your
death or you can use that to create your
life. Which way have you been using it?
Class Participant:
To induce death.
Gary:
Yeah. Not your best choice, is it?
Class Participant:
To create life. What would that look
like?
Gary:

Ask: How can I use being a slut to
create more of a life, not less? Who can
I shag that will expand my universe, give
me the life I want, and make everything
work? Instead of going to what will
create your life, you go for what’s going
to get you laid, because shagging has
become the valuable product—not the
fact that you can shag, not the fact that
you’re cute and you entice people to
shag, not the fact that you can enjoy the
hell out of yourself. You make getting
laid the end goal, the target of
everything. Most men do.
Class Participant:
I’m laughing. I see that so clearly.

Gary:
Creation stops the moment you go to
the completion of “This woman will
have sex with me.” You’re not looking at
“How can I use this to my advantage?” I
hate to tell you this, gentlemen, but
women like to get laid as much as men
do. They just want the romance to be
able to choose it.
How Can I Use Being a
Sleaze Ball to My
Advantage?
Gary:
For example, a few of you do sleaze

ball. Does that usually work well for
you? No, it doesn’t. So you have to ask,
“How can I use being a sleaze ball to my
advantage?” If you added humor to it,
you could use it to your advantage. If you
saw the fun and games in it, if you saw
the possibilities in it instead of the
destruction in it, the badness in it, the
awfulness in it, or any of that stuff,
would a different reality show up?
Class Participant:
Can you give me an example of that?
Gary:
If you do sleaze ball with humor,
people will think you’re not really a

sleaze ball. Sleaze ball means you slime
on girls. You ask, “Hey, can I take off my
pants and show you my penis? Don’t you
want it now that you’ve seen it?” and the
women say, “Gross!” You have not
looked at how you can use this in a
different way. What if you did something
different instead of sleazing all over
women and saying, “You’re going to
want to have sex with me.”
It’s not about changing the fact that you
do sleaze ball. It’s about seeing how you
can use it to your advantage. What I’m
trying to tell you is that you do sleaze
ball, and it doesn’t get you the results
you want. So what would you have to be

or do different to get the results you
really do want? How could you do or be
different with it?
Ask: How can I use this in a different
way? You’ve got to learn how to use it
in a way that works for you. Right now
you’re using it in a way that isn’t
working. You have to get clear on what
you want. Do you want a relationship?
Do you just want to get laid? If you just
want to get laid, make a bunch of money
and hire a hooker. It’s unencumbered. Or
become 
gay, 
because 
that’s
unencumbered sex too.
It’s the same with anything. If you have
good looks, you’ve got to acknowledge

that you have good looks and ask, “How
do I use this to create my life?” not
“How can I use this to get a woman?”
You’ll use your looks to get a woman
and then destroy your life to have her.
You’ll use your looks to kill yourself.
You’re seduced by the fact that your
good looks get you laid, so you seduce
somebody into getting laid in order to
kill yourself.

Using Your Sexual Energy
Class Participant:
I don’t see myself as a shag master or
a sleaze ball. Could you help me find

what that is for me that I could use to
create my life?
Gary:
Are you trying to create yourself as
highly sexual or as asexual?
Class Participant:
Asexual at the moment.
Gary:
Okay, so everything you’ve done is to
make yourself asexual. When you try to
make yourself asexual, are you trying to
put away the sexual energy you have so
you are not seduced into a relationship
that doesn’t work anymore? Or are you
trying to make yourself asexual so you

don’t create problems in other people’s
worlds?
Class Participant:
The last one.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
When you try to make yourself asexual
as though it’s not going to cause
problems in people’s worlds, you entice
a whole lot of people to try and seduce
you, which is the part you like. Don’t

you like it when people try to seduce
you, and you get to say no?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
You like being able to say no. “No,
I’m not that kind of girl… I mean I’m not
that kind of boy. I won’t give it up that
cheaply. I’m not a cheap slut. I’m not a
sleaze ball. I’m not a shag master. I’m a
good boy.”
Class Participant:
So does doing asexual create people
wanting to seduce you? Is that just
intimidation?

Gary:
Total sexualness can be intimidation.
If you’re willing to be totally sexual and
use your sexualness as a way of
intimidating others, a whole new world
opens up. I was doing a sex class once,
and a really pretty young thing looked at
me and said, “I could put my strap on
and do you.”
I asked, “Do you really think you can
handle me, honey?” and she got totally
interiorized. She was doing sex as force.
She wasn’t doing sex as reality. You
have to get to where you recognize that
sex as reality is a totally different
universe. Sex as reality is “Who can I

intimidate with my sexual energy? Who
can I invite with my sexual energy? Who
can I induce into my life that’s not going
to kill me? And who can I create with
that that will create more of the life I’d
really like to have?”
A lot of people use their sexual energy
in order to create art and literature; they
sublimate 
their 
sexual 
energy 
for
copulation and instead use it in artistic
ways, as though that handles things for
them. Sexual energy is not the source of
creation; it is a contribution to it. You
want to expand your sexual energy so it
can be a contribution to everything
you’re able to create, whether it’s art,

literature, painting, music, or anything
else.
You’ve got to have the willingness to
be intimidating sexually, which means
instead of saying, “Oh, she wants me.
Cool. I’m so glad she wants me. I’ll let
her leave her snail trail all over my body
and nobody else will touch me,” you
ask, “Do you really think you satisfy me,
babe? Bye. See you later. I’ve got things
to do, people to see, and places to be!”
not “Yes. I’ll give up my life for you.”
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Most of you don’t want to be sexually
intimidating, because you figure if
you’re sexually intimidating, nobody
will want you. No, the fun ones will
want you.
When you are sexually intimidating,
you are never willing to be less because
someone 
else 
can’t 
receive 
the
sexualness you are. When you are
sexually intimidating, people have to
choose whether or not to be with you
rather than you trying to seduce them into
doing something they don’t want to do.
When you try not to be sexually
intimidating, people try to figure out

what it is you want from them instead of
being able to choose what they want. If
you’re 
willing 
to 
be 
sexually
intimidating, they know what you want
from them and they get to choose
whether they want to do that—or not.
How many times have you been
unwilling to be sexually intimidating?
And all the places where you’ve
decided 
that 
being 
sexually
intimidating is a wrongness, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Most of you, when you have a really

good sexual experience, will dumb it
down next time to make sure you don’t
lose the person.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You’d rather have some lame duck
wanting you rather than somebody who
would be fun and who would enjoy the
fuck out of you, and enjoy fucking you.
And if you said you didn’t want to do
what they wanted you to do, they would
say, “Oh, okay. I’ll do whatever you
want.”

Dain finally got sexually intimidating.
When the lady said she wanted to spend
two days with him, he said, “No, I don’t
want to spend two days with you.” She
texted him the next day and said, “You’re
right. I just want to be with you.
Whatever time I get is such an invitation,
such a contribution. I want to have that.”
If you’re not willing to adjust to
people’s world, they will adjust to
yours. Stop being pansies.
Everything you’ve done to create
yourself as a pansy where anybody
can sniff you or lick you, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and

POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
So if I’m choosing asexualness, am I
seducing myself into the induction of
death?
Gary:
Yeah. You’re seducing yourself to
death. That’s what asexualness is. You
have no sexuality. You have neither man
nor woman nor anything in your life. You
have no sexual energy in your body.
How can you heal your body if you have
no sexual energy?
Class Participant:

You can’t.
What Are You Creating with
Your Sexual Energy?
Gary:
Sexual energy is creative energy. You
need to turn the sexual energy back on,
but you don’t have to use it to get laid.
Class Participant:
No, I can use it to create and generate
my life. So what questions can I be
asking from here?
Gary:
Ask: What seduction am I using to
induce the death I am choosing? You are

seducing yourself into asexualness as
though that’s going to create your life.
No, that’s going to create your death.
You have to look at what you’re
creating with your sexual energy. If
you’re being a shag master, you think that
as long as you’re getting laid three times
a day you’re creating your life. No,
you’re creating your penis. You’re not
creating your life. Life is not a penis. It
doesn’t have to be hard all the time for
you to enjoy it. You have to start looking
at these things from a different place and
begin to ask: What would I really like to
create as my life?
When that lady said to me, “We can

spend seventy-five percent of our time
together,” I had to look hard and long at
it and ask, “Do I truly desire a
relationship?” 
She 
did. 
She 
was
married, by the way, and was going to
leave her husband for me. When I
looked, I realized she wasn’t interested
in me; she was interested in me being
interested in her. What’s the difference?
Class Participant:
That’s the space of you not being
willing to give yourself up.
Gary:
I’m not willing to give myself up for
anybody, any amount of money, or

anything else.
Who or what are you willing to give
yourself up for that if you didn’t give
yourself up for it would allow you to
have all of you? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Great Sex
A guy was telling me about an
experience of great sex that he had. He
asked, “What would it take to have some
more 
of 
that?” 
When 
you 
have
experiences of great sex, instead of

asking, “What would it take to have
more of that in my life?” try “What
would it take for me to perceive that
energy in people?” You have to be
willing to perceive the energy in people
that creates great sex.
Class Participant:
And to choose it.
Gary:
Yes, and to choose what’s going to
create that. You guys create weird-ass
standards based on somebody else’s
point of view about what an attractive
person is. I can see a woman with a
beautiful body or a man with a beautiful

body and say, “Oh wow, beautiful!
Would they be any fun to have sex
with?” No? Okay. Beautiful body.
Beautiful to look at. Incredibly seductive
—and useless from my point of view.
You guys see a beautiful body, a
beautiful set of tits, or whatever it is that
turns you on and… Why is it you see
something that turns you on instead of
just being so turned on that you turn
everybody else on?
Class Participant:
Is the first kind of turn-on the
seduction into the induction of death?
Gary:

Yes. It’s the seduction into the
induction of death, because the person
you’re turned on by is the person who
will induce death in you.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You’re all very cute but you have a
single digit IQ, and it hangs between
your legs.
Class Participant:
I really appreciate this call. These
calls are amazing.

Gary:
If I get two or three of you to the point
where you can actually have some fun
and create your life while still being
able to be a shag master, a slut puppy, or
a sleaze ball, then it will have been
worth it.
Don’t Make Other People’s
Judgments True
Guys! I love you, but you’re just damn,
frigging dumb. When somebody tries to
make you wrong because you are what
you are, don’t make it wrong. Say,
“Yeah, thanks” or “Holy shit! Are you
kidding me?” You have been making

yourself wrong for one of your best
attributes. Instead of using it for you, you
have been using it against you. When
people told me I was a perverted, slut
puppy, I said, “Yeah, I am!”
They said, “Well that’s not a good
thing.”
And I said, “Based on what? It works
for me.”
Class Participant:
So we create the induction of death to
validate somebody’s point of view?
Gary:
Yes, to validate somebody’s point of
view that you’re wrong. You’re not

wrong; you’re just a slut. Slut is not
wrong. Slut is just slut.
Class Participant:
Watch out! Here comes Slut Puppy!
Gary:
All 
right, 
now 
we’re 
getting
somewhere! I’ll be calling you a slut
puppy instead of asexual.
Class Participant:
All this is based on validating other
people’s judgments?
Gary:
It’s all based on validating this
reality’s point of view—the judgments

of other people’s reality. I’d say, “Okay,
so what if I’m a slut?” When people
have a judgment of you, you make it real
and true. I never went there. I would ask,
“What? You would think that was good
or bad or wrong or right, and you
wouldn’t see this other point of view for
what reason?”
When I was in high school, I was a
good dancer and I was good looking. I
didn’t know I was good looking, but I
was. From the first year I was in high
school, I got invited to every senior
prom. I was invited by the ugliest girls
in the world, but I didn’t mind. I was
going to be a virgin when I got married,

and I was not tempted to have sex with
ugly women. I would wine them and
dine them, I would dance with them, and
they would feel really special and
beautiful and that was fine.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
When I finally decided that I was
going to give up my virginity and not
wait till I got married, I went after the
woman who was considered the greatest
slut in the place where I worked. She put
every guy down. She wasn’t interested

in any of them. So I entertained her. I
smiled at her, I talked to her, I was funny,
I was delightful, I was amazing. I pulled
energy from her and I never asked her
out. For three months I didn’t ask her
out. Then I finally asked her out. We had
the best sex! I learned how to have sex
in every position. In every car. On every
piece of furniture. Anywhere at any time.
It was wonderful. She was a girl who
enjoyed sex, and I was interested in
somebody who enjoyed sex. My criteria
were: Will it be easy? Will it be fun?
And will I learn something? Not: Can I
give myself up and die for this woman
so she will know how much I love her?

Please run this for the next month:
What seduction am I using to induce
the death I am choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
I can guarantee you that every woman
you find so seductive you can’t pass up
is designed to induce your death. Yes,
she will expand your agenda, but she is
not designed to create your possibilities.
Use the questions:
• If I choose this what will my life be

like in five years?
• If I don’t choose this what will my
life be like in five years?
And be honest for a change. You figure
that if you’re going to get laid, life is
going to be better. No, it’s not going to
be better. It’s going to be more of the
same thing you’ve been creating that
hasn’t been working. Don’t give up any
part of your life for anybody else,
because if you do, you give up every
future you’ve started to create, and
you’ll have to start from ground zero all
over again. Love you all. That’s it for
today.

Class Participants:
Thank you, Gary.
Gary:
Thank you. You guys are good. Now
be bad. It’s way more fun. Bye-bye.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
6
What Do You Really
Desire?
Your awareness can create a
relationship if you want.
It can create whatever you desire, but
you have to desire it.
The question is: What do you really
desire?
Gary:

Hello, gentlemen. Does anyone have a
question?
What If Everyone Was
Willing to Be a Slut?
Class Participant:
In the last call, you were saying that
being a slut and a shag master is not a
wrongness. I have always bought the
point of view that being a slut or a shag
master is wrong and that a nice, decent
gentleman wouldn’t be or do that. Could
you talk about this some more?
Gary:
What makes you a gentleman? How

softly you put it in while it’s hard? If
everybody was willing to be a slut, we
would have a much easier world, but
everybody tries to be in judgment about
what “proper” things they’re supposed
to be. They think that if they could do the
proper and correct thing, they wouldn’t
have problems. But the problems exist
not because you’re being a slut or shag
master. The problems exist because of
the judgments that people use as a
weapon against you.
How many of you have had someone
use their judgment of your sexual energy
against you? Every time sexual energy
comes up, the first thing you do is go into

the wrongness of you, because the
judgment has been that’s what you have
to do.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What Do You Want to Have
in Your Life?
You have spent so much time being
wrong for everything you chose. You
don’t ask, “What do I really want to
create here?” What if you were willing
to look at what is actually possible?

You have to ask, “Truth, do I desire to
have a relationship? Or do I just like to
have sex? And what am I willing to pay
to have the sex I want?”
Dain:
If you ask, “Do I desire to have a
relationship?” you may say, “Well, not
necessarily, but I like the sex. I also like
going out on dates and playing or
cuddling. Once it gets to relationship,
it’s one heavy bitch. It’s just a pile of
obligations.” I don’t necessarily think
sex is enough for a lot of us. We tend to
like to hang out with people too, so
where does that leave us?

Gary:
You have to look at what you’d really
like to create for you. What do you want
to have in your life? What would it be
like if you were capable of having
everything you desire?
Dain:
And what would that be? We tend to
put it into “Do you just want sex or do
you want relationship?” Isn’t there
something else? Isn’t there a broader
spectrum of possibilities?
Gary:
In this reality, there isn’t a broader
spectrum of reality.

Dain:
Right. Is that part of the reason we
have such challenge and difficulty—
because we keep thinking it shouldn’t be
an either/or, as that’s where every male
tends to put it?
Gary:
You think the only choice you have is
to be the either/or of everybody else’s
point of view. You assume that some sort
of problem or wrongness exists with the
way you are. You’ve got to ask: What
would be the most amazing thing I could
have in life? Unfortunately, I see most
people trying to figure out what they

shouldn’t have rather than what they can
have.
Dain:
I think we all do that. There’s some
place in our worlds where we’re going
along, let’s say in the area of sex and
relationship, and we find somebody and
we have sex with them. We have sex a
few more times, then all of a sudden,
before we realize it has happened, we’re
in a difficult place that is no fun. There
are obligations. We say, “Wait a minute.
How did we get here? Everything was
easy just a moment ago, and now we are
in this impossible place. What’s going
on?” We try to cut off more of us to undo

the impossible place we find ourselves
in rather than realizing that if we had
acknowledged it ahead of time, we might
not have had to go there.
Choosing Awareness
Gary:
Rather than choosing awareness, you
choose to cut off your awareness.
Everywhere you have chosen to cut
off 
your 
awareness 
rather 
than
choosing it, as though cutting it off is a
greater source of choice, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
Everywhere you have chosen to cut
off your awareness, as though that is a
greater source of choice, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
You make women unfathomable. How
many of you have recognized that you
tend to see women as some kind of
unfathomable thing you can’t figure out?
You don’t ask:
• What can I figure out with this
woman?

• What can I be aware of?
• What can I know?
What stupidity are you using to
defend 
totally 
against 
the
unfathomable women, sex, copulation,
and relationships you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
You’ve spent your whole life trying to
figure out how to deal with women, but
you don’t seem able to fathom, to go
deep enough, to figure out what it is. It
becomes an unfathomable place. You

cannot go deep enough to understand or
to get what they’re talking about.
What stupidity are you using to
defend 
totally 
against 
the
unfathomable women, sex, copulation,
and relationships you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
It’s an eternal defense. You have no
choice but to defend against everything.
Dain:
When you did the process initially,

Gary, you said, “the defense against,”
and then the next time you did it, you
said, “the defense for.” Are we doing
both? Defending it and defending against
it?
Gary:
Yeah, apparently so.
What stupidity are you using to
create the eternal defense for and
against the unfathomable men, women,
sex, copulation, and relationships are
you choosing? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
You end up in a no-man’s land.
Gary:
Well, isn’t that pretty much where you
feel you are most of the time? In some
kind of no-man’s land where you have
no clue what is going on and why?
Class Participant:
Absolutely.
You Have to Desire It
Gary:
That’s the whole situation in a
nutshell. You have no idea what’s

occurring or why. All you know is
somehow, something isn’t right. And
usually you are what isn’t right. And
because you’ve determined and decided
you’re not right and there’s something
wrong with you, you have to be in a
constant 
state 
of 
looking 
at 
the
wrongness of you. You don’t look at the
choice and awareness you are. You don’t
see you as the valuable product.
Your 
awareness 
can 
create 
a
relationship if you want. It can create
whatever you desire, but you have to
desire it. The question is: What do you
really desire? I was talking with a guy a
while ago, and he was saying, “Well, I

don’t really want children, but I kind of
maybe.…” It was a whole lot of fantasy
and blah, blah, blah.
I said, “You know what? You don’t
have a choice here. Truth, do you really
want a relationship?”
He said, “It feels heavy.”
I asked, “Do you want a fantasy
relationship?”
He said, “Yeah, I do.”
I asked, “Okay, can you create it?”
He said, “No, it wouldn’t be good.”
I asked, “How do you know? You
haven’t created it yet.” Have any of you
ever achieved the fantasy relationship

you thought was possible?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
Right. You don’t try to do it from
awareness! You try to do it from the
unfathomable 
relationship, 
sex,
copulation, men, and women.
What stupidity are you using to
create the eternal defense for and
against the unfathomable men, women,
sex, copulation, and relationships you
are choosing? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
That’s like defending the foundation of
this reality.
Are You Making Yourself
Wrong for the Truth of You?
Gary:
Yes, 
it 
is 
the 
foundation 
of
relationship, sex, and copulation in this
reality. I would like to get you to the
place where you start to look at the kind
of relationship you would like to create
instead of a relationship based on this

reality.
Class Participant:
When I was in my early twenties I met
a girl at a party, and her friend said to
me, “You just want to fuck.” I clearly
remember saying, “Yes, and what?”
Then I made myself wrong for what I
truly am.
Gary:
Let’s see, that was about fifteen years
ago. The good news is that for fifteen
years, you’ve made yourself wrong,
when in truth what you had going for you
was the truth your early years were.
What stupidity are you using to

defend against the shag master, slut
puppy you truly be are you choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
How much of your awareness do you
have to cut off to not recognize that what
you really want to do is fuck? You make
yourself wrong and then you spend all
your time trying to prove that’s not really
what you want so other people will think
you don’t really want that when it really
is what you want. But other people are
psychic too, so they know you really

want it. You have to lie to them and you
have to lie to yourself doubly in order to
prove that you’re not really wanting
what you really want, because that
would be so bad and sad.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What stupidity are you using to
create the eternal defense against
being the shag master, slut puppy you
truly be are you choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and

Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What stupidity are you using to

sex, copulation, and relationship you

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
What will it take to generate and
create contribution where we go beyond

the crap we invent as more real than
who we really be?
Gary:
That’s what this whole sequence of
calls is about.
An Ideal Relationship with
a Woman
Class Participant:
Would you be able to describe an
ideal relationship with a woman?
Gary:
Yeah. She lives across the country.
You visit each other for three days. I’m
kidding.

You 
keep 
trying 
to 
create 
a
relationship that’s going to be an ideal
relationship. If you’re doing relationship
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
an 
ideal
relationship, are you looking at the
person in front of you? Or are you
looking at who you would like her to be,
who you think she ought to be, and who
you think she might be?
What stupidity are you using to
create the defense for and against the
utopian ideal of relationship you are
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
The best relationship with a woman is
where you can live with each other, and
each one of you allows the other person
to be who they are. You have no
judgment, both of you enjoy the sex you
have, whether it’s a lot or a little, and
you don’t have to spend every moment
together.
Spending Time Together
One of the things all of you need to
look at is how much time you would like
to spend with a woman. I personally like
to spend about an hour to an hour and a
half talking to her, and after that, I want

to have sex with her.
What percentage of your life would
you like to spend with a woman? Ten?
Twenty? Thirty? Forty? Or what?
Class Participant:
Ten.
Gary:
Okay, so you want to spend two and a
half hours a day with her.
Class Participant:
Yep.
Gary:
Two and a half hours a day is
probably a good percentage. Any more

than that, and you’ll most likely get
bored.
Class Participant:
It seems like women want to spend
more time with me than I want to spend
with them.
Gary:
Yes, because you never commit to
being there even when you’re spending
ten percent of your time with them. And
you’re not willing to be intimidating.
You tend to function from a total
incapacity to intimidate them. What if
you demanded of them that they spend
more time with you?

Class Participant:
Would that be intimidating?
Gary:
Yes, because if a man demands that a
woman spends time with him, guess
what she wants to do? Go away. If you
want to make a girl go away, demand
more time with her.
Class Participant:
Can you give me an example of how to
do that? Is it an energetic thing? Is it
what I say?
Gary:
You have to start out with the energy
of it. You have to look at her and say,

“You know what? I don’t think we’re
spending enough time together.”
When you’re away from her, call her
and tell her how much you miss her. If
you keep doing that, she’ll suddenly find
reasons not to be available. If she stops
answering her phone, then you know you
finally have control. How many of you
have had women do that to you? They
call you so often, and so much, that you
don’t want to even answer your phone.
Class Participant:
Yup.
Gary:
So why aren’t you doing that to them?

You resist being so demanding of them
that they have to be quiet and good and
calm around you instead of you being
calm, good, and quiet around them.
Class Participant:
Yeah, holy moly!
Gary:
Do you want a woman to give you
some space? That’s another thing that
most men want in a relationship—
somebody who will give them space.
How many of you realize that as a man
you like your alone time?
Class Participant:
Yes.

Gary:
Men require down time. It’s your
process time. It’s when you take all the
things you’ve collected all day long, put
your attention on them, and come to an
awareness or a conclusion of what you
want to do with the awareness of all of
those things.
Everything that doesn’t allow that to
show up in your life, will you destroy
and uncreate that? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Men have been taught that they have to
do things to indicate that they love or
care. They’re trained to believe that

doing equals caring. So they have to deal
with all the stuff they’ve collected and
ask, “What do I do with all this stuff?”
until they come to “Oh! I see what I need
to do.” It’s the way they come to an
awareness of what they “need to do.”
But it’s not actually an awareness—it’s a
conclusion, which doesn’t give them the
freedom awareness would.
Women can talk about something all
day long and never have to come to
conclusion. A man has to process
something 
until 
he 
can 
come 
to
conclusion and determine what he needs
to do. It’s a different way of dealing with
life.

What’s the Most Important
Thing to Me?
Class Participant:
Would you talk more about creating
our lives?
Gary:
Well, one thing you have to look at is:
What would I like to have as my life?
You have to ask questions like:
• What would I like my life to be like
in five years?
• Do I want to travel?
• How much money do I want to
make?

• What is it that’s most important to
me?
See if there’s a relationship included
in there. I find that most men get their
lives going, and then they decide to add
a relationship, which gets rid of half of
their life. What if a relationship was an
addition to your life, not a replacement
for your life?
Everywhere 
you’ve 
made
relationship a replacement for life and
living, will you destroy and uncreate
all of that? Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD and POC, All Nine,
Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Class Participant:
It seems that I have to make a
commitment to myself with regard to
asking, “What I would like?”
Gary:
Yes, you have to look at whether you
really want a relationship and then make
a commitment to what you’d like. Most
of you get into relationship by default.
Do you recognize that?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Make a List: What I Would
Like in a Partner?

You need to ask, “What would I like in
a partner?” You’ve got to get clear about
what you want in a relationship. The
problem is you don’t ask that. You look
at somebody and you say, “Oh, I like
her.” You never ask, “Does she like me?
Does she like men?” You assume,
because you like her, that she’s going to
like you and she’s going to like men and
everything is going to be perfect.
Find out what you desire. How would
you like your interactions with each
other to be? What would it be like to
interact with her? What do you want to
create with her? Do you want someone
who has a good sense of humor?

Someone 
you 
can 
have 
a 
good
conversation with?
By the way, there’s a big difference
between 
conversation 
and
communication. Communication is “Get
your dirty feet off the couch.” That’s an
honest communication; it’s a good
communication, 
but 
it’s 
not 
a
conversation. Find out what you want to
create with her. Make a list of what
you’d like to have in a partner.
You Also Need an “I Don’t
Want to Have” List
Before I got together with my ex-wife,
I made a list of all the things I wanted in

a woman I was in a relationship with.
She had all those things. What I didn’t
make is a list of all the things I did not
want in that person. So I got everything I
wanted, and I also got everything I didn’t
want.
Class Participant:
How specific does the “don’t want”
list have to be? Isn’t that creating a
limitation?
Gary:
It’s not about limitation. You’ve got to
look at it and say, “I do not wish to have
a woman who’s going to complain all
the time” or “I don’t want a woman who

always argues.” Have any of you noticed
that you’ve chosen a woman who is very
similar to the last woman you chose? It’s
as if she’s the same women in a different
body?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
You’re choosing the same woman over
and over again and expecting a different
result. Who’s the one person you can
change?
Class Participant:
Me.

What Stupidity Are You
Using to Create the Women
You Are Choosing?
Gary:
You’ve 
got 
to 
change 
your
perspective. You can’t change somebody
else’s. Have a look at your perspective.
“I’ve chosen the same woman over and
over again and I’ve got nothing I want
out of it. Why would I do that?” If you’re
going to swim across the river and you
take the same number of strokes in the
same way all the time, are you going to
get to a different place in the river? No.
You’re going to get to the same place

you got to before. So ask: What stupidity
am I using to create the woman I am
choosing?
Class Participant:
I will do that.
Class Participant:
Last month I participated in Dain’s
Energetic Synthesis of Being through
live streaming. Even though I wasn’t
physically there, I found that I was
judging some of the women in the class.
I couldn’t stand the way they asked
questions. It seemed to me they were just
trying to get Dain’s attention.
Gary:

Of course! He’s the leader of the
class. They want to get his attention. So
what’s the deal?
Everything you’re unwilling to
acknowledge about your awareness,
will you destroy and uncreate all of
that? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I noticed that Dain was totally cool
with them. He received them with no
judgment regardless of what they said or
what they asked. How can I be that?
Receiving all girls and women for who

they are. Are there any clearings we can
do so we can do that too?
Gary:
What stupidity am I using to create
the women I am choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Keep running that one.
Being Needless of a Woman
Class Participant:
In the past, I have heard you talk about

needlessness. Can you talk some more
about being needless when it comes to
girls, women, sex, relationship, and
copulation? This is a big one for me. If
there weren’t all these things I thought I
needed, I could have the true value of
me.
Gary:
The more you can function from the
needlessness of it, whatever it is, the
more you begin to recognize the choices
you have to actually choose it. Recently I
asked Dain, “Do you get that these
women want you?” and he said, “No, I
don’t get that.”

I said, “Yeah, you keep thinking you
want them, but the reality is they want
you.”
When you’re needless of a woman,
she wants you all the time. The more
needless you are, the more she wants
you. You have a need to be needed,
because you were taught that you needed
to be able to fix things and do things for
a woman to prove you loved her. You’re
trying to do proof of love instead of
being needless of having love or giving
love.
Class Participant:
Yeah.

Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
defend against the needlessness you
could be choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
When I first started looking for
relationship, it had nothing to do with
me. It was that I needed a relationship to
be the valuable product. There are all
these things we’re told we need.
Gary:

Why do you need a relationship? You
need a relationship to prove something.
You need a relationship to prove that
you’re not a useless pile of debris. You
need a relationship to prove that you’re
not gay. You need a relationship to prove
that you have value. You need a
relationship. Is any of that true?
Class Participant:
No, and it’s the same with everything.
We go into that place of need. “I need to
have kids. I need to get married. I need
to have this much money.”
Gary:
That’s where you complete a choice.

How much of your life have you
done as the completion of choice
based on the need to be something
you’re not? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
“I’ve Stopped Creating”
Class Participant:
I feel like I’m at a place now where
I’ve stopped creating. Can you help me
out with that?
Gary:

Did 
you 
stop 
creating 
because
somebody else was doing all the
creation?
Class Participant:
Hmm. Yeah.
Gary:
Did you stop creating because there
was no need for you to create? And did
you misidentify and misapply no need as
needless?
Class Participant:
Yeah. I misidentified no need as
needless.
Gary:

Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Wow.
Class Participant:
Thank you for asking that question. It
showed me the mess I created so I’d
have something to do. And now I’m not
creating.
Gary:
Your problem is that you’ve created
need as the source of choice instead of

choice as the creation of your life.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
What 
physical 
actualization 
of
creation through choice are you now
capable of generating, creating, and
instituting? Everything that doesn’t
allow that to show up times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Abdicating Your Voice

Class Participant:
In the Right Voice for You facilitators
class, you mentioned that men abdicate
their voices.
Gary:
Yeah. Most of the men in the world
think that it’s important to be the strong,
silent type. How much of your voice in
the world have you abdicated so you can
be strong and silent? A lot, a little, or
megatons?
Class Participant:
Megatons.
Gary:
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,

POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
You abdicate your voice with regard
to women because you don’t want to get
into an argument with them. You think
that if you get in an argument, they’ll go
away. 
Women 
have 
a 
strange
characteristic. They like to discuss
everything and come to no conclusion.
You, as a man, are always trying to come
to conclusion about everything you say
or do. So for you, an argument means
conclusion. For a woman, it means
“We’re just discussing it, and you’re
wrong.”
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Is conclusion trying to work out what
action to take?
Gary:
You only have to figure out what
action to take based on the conclusion
that you’re wrong in the first place. (Not
that you’ve never been made wrong in
relationship!) 
This 
is 
where 
men
abdicate their voice.
What stupidity are you using to

defend the rightness of abdicating your
voice are you choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Well, the bad news, gentlemen, is that
we’re not done. The good news is you
get to go out and practice. Remember,
slip it in gently. That makes you a
gentleman.
Class Participant:
I love it. We now have a definition of
what it is to be a gentleman.

Dain:
Finally!
Class Participant:
You’re wonderful, Gary. Thank you.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
7
Being Good in Bed
I decided I’d better learn everything I
could about how to get a woman off,
so she would be satisfied no matter
what I did.
Gary:
Hello, gentlemen. Let’s begin with a
question.
Class Participant:

The Access Consciousness Level One
manual says that being good in bed is
one of the three elements of a good
relationship. Can you talk about this?
What do you mean by “good in bed”? Is
there a criterion for what’s good in bed?
Create a Galvanic Response
in Her Body
Gary:
Yes, there are several criteria. Let’s
start by looking at the galvanic response
of people’s skin. It’s about the way your
touch creates an effect in the other
person. Pull up your sleeve and run your
hand about a half an inch over your arm

and pull energy. You’ll feel the hair
begin to rise up off your arm to meet
your hand. If you use this with somebody
you’re having sex with, they will see you
as very different from their other lovers
and they will be more excited. The
galvanic responses you can create in
someone’s body are part of what creates
your being good in bed. It’s also part of
what invites your partner’s body to an
orgasm, which also makes you better in
bed. You have to ask, “How much time
am I willing to take to have sex with this
person?”
Go Slow

Most of us have been taught to get it
over with fast. You learned to ejaculate
based on looking at some pictures and
pounding your pud as hard as you could
in order to get it over with quickly,
because somebody was going to knock
on the door, come in, and catch you at
any time. You have to overcome that
point of view. It’s about learning to go
slow.
Learn about the Parts of a
Woman’s Body
The other thing is you want to learn
about the parts of a woman’s body. The
clitoris is the most sensitive part of her

body. Don’t use harshness on the
clitoris. Use the lightest butterfly touch
with your tongue that you can possibly
create and invite that clitoris to be like
the hair on your arm wanting to reach up
and grab your hand.
Touch the clitoris so lightly that it
creates a tingling in the woman’s body
but also an awareness of you and what is
making it tingle. Wait until the clitoris
starts to come up to meet you. Lap down
the sides and put your tongue in the
vagina. And then go back to touching the
clitoris very lightly. If you use your
tongue like a butterfly on a woman’s
clitoris, you can usually bring her to

orgasm within five to seven minutes. If
she has two or three orgasms before you
even enter her, she’s going to think
you’re the best thing in bed ever. So use
this technique.
What Kind of Touch Would
She Like?
And ask: What kind of touch would
this person like? What would create a
dynamic galvanic response in her? When
you do this rather than looking at how
you can get it up, get it on, and get it in
without messing up your hairdo, you’ll
start to get where she functions from and
how she might do things. You want a

different point of view. You want to look
at the possibility of what could be—not
what you want it to be or don’t want it to
be. That’s really important.
Decreased Libido
Class Participant:
Do you know anything that will help
males with sexual dysfunctions like
decreased 
libido 
or 
premature
ejaculation?
Gary:
You have a decreased libido because
you have not chosen to have sex with
people who desire to have sex with you.

Our brain is the thing that creates the
libido, not our body. What are you doing
to stimulate your brain? Most men think
that stimulating the brain means watching
porn or something that is going to turn
them on and make them want to have
more sex. No. Look at the parts of a
body that are a turn-on for you. Some
women have a wonderful curve in their
back, and some men have that too.
Notice how a woman’s butt moves and
how her butt works. Those are things
that stimulate in you a sense of the
possibilities that might occur in working
with that body.
What part of the body is most exciting

to you? Most men have been trained to
believe that tits and vagina are the sum
total of sexual desire. I personally don’t
believe that. I find the way a woman
walks is a great indication of whether
she’s going to be good in bed. She needs
to be able to move those hips. She needs
to be able to move them with you in bed.
And by the way, gentlemen, you need
to be able to walk like that too. You need
to know that you can move your hips in
every direction possible. The purpose of
having a good physique is so you can
fuck better. Go out and create your
physique for greater fucking, not for how
you look in the mirror. You tend to focus

on how you look in the mirror, and that’s
only to inspire other men to think you’re
not in competition with them—or to
think you are. That’s not necessarily your
best choice. Notice how people move
their hips. That probably wouldn’t be
true for a gay guy. He might want to see
how somebody eats, because that’s a
greater indication of whether they’ll eat
him well.
If you have a decreased libido, you
can do things like Viagra. There are also
different kinds of natural substances that
the Chinese have used for years to create
greater and longer-lasting erections. You
just have to find one that works with

your body. Ask your body:
• Would this be good for you?
• Will you like this?
• How would this work for you?
It’s not: “Oh good, this is going to get
me hard.” That’s not the perspective.
First of all, getting hard is one thing;
creating a dynamic capacity in bed is a
totally different universe. You have to
ask: How do I create stimulation in this
person’s body? You want to get to the
point where you’re so present with how
you have sex that you can feel the other
person’s body feeling what you’re doing
to their body, while your body is feeling

it too, so that you get every direction.
That would be the greatest stimulation
you can do for your libido.
Class Participant:
Is there a clearing for that, Gary?
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
defend for and against the galvanic
responses, the stimulating touches, and
the invigorating possibilities that
would alter your limited sexual
capacities 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I have a question about creating my
body for better fucking. Is there a
question or a clearing that would assist
with that?
Gary:
What 
physical 
actualization 
of
creating my body as a fucking machine
could I be choosing that I’m not
choosing? Everything that does not
allow that to show up times a
godzillion, destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Gary, 
when 
you 
say, 
“fucking
machine,” what pops up in my mind is a
rabbit. It’s like you’re doing rabbit sex.
Gary:
Have you judged yourself for doing
rabbit sex because you came too
quickly?
Class Participant:
Not because I came too quickly, but
because I was enjoying it and the
rawness in it.
Gary:

And who judged you for that?
Class Participant:
The woman and I.
Gary:
Was that looking at how you could use
the 
galvanic 
response 
to 
create
something different? No. Look at the
galvanic response I told you about and
how to use the clitoris. There’s also the
G-spot which is on the upper side of the
vaginal area.
Class Participant:
Gary, can you explain that? I don’t
know what that is.

Gary:
The G-spot is on the upper side of the
vaginal area. Go in from the front with
your hand and move it around in little
circles against the front side of the
vagina, and you’ll feel a hardness begin
to occur. The same thing can occur on
the bottom side of the vagina if you use
that technique as well. Now, why would
that occur? Because all of it is designed
to go together. Just think about it. If you
were entering from behind and you put
your penis in—most penises have a tilt
that goes up toward the body—and that
tilt goes up and would hit some place in
the vaginal cavity that would allow for a

greater stimulation. And your balls
slapping against the clitoris can have an
effect on that. That’s why some women
really like to have it from behind.
Stimulating Her Body
When I first began having sex—and
“sex” was three guys going behind the
library and masturbating—we’d pop our
puds to see who could get off the
quickest. One of the guys had a twelve-
inch dick that was about three inches in
diameter, the other one had a ten-inch
dick that was about three and a half
inches in diameter, and I had about five
and a half inches. I thought I was

definitely a retarded child and that
everybody had a ten-inch dick or a
twelve-inch dick.
It was very interesting later in life to
find out that wasn’t so, but because I
thought I was deprived in the penis
department, I decided I’d better learn
everything I could about how to get a
woman off, so she would be satisfied no
matter what I did. I learned about oral
sex, I learned about how to give good
head, I learned about the galvanic
response, and I learned how to touch a
woman’s body to the point where she
was screaming to have intercourse, not
something else.

I started learning how the clitoris
works and what part of her body to
touch, and instead of just putting my
penis in, I went slow. I spent a lot of
time caressing the breasts, caressing the
armpits, caressing the fold of the elbow
on the front side, and touching different
parts of the body. If you run your hands
very slowly down the outside of the
woman’s body from her tits down to her
knees, you can create enough galvanic
response that she starts to get goose
pimples, and you’ll have amazing sex.
You’ve got to get her to the point where
she’s willing to have that kind of
stimulation within her body.

Most women have never learned to
have that kind of stimulation in their
body because the only reason they’re
having sex is to get a relationship. And
men have only been taught to do sex.
Neither of those things is loving sex.
What physical actualization of the
sensual, 
sexual, 
copulation, 
and
innervation am I now capable of
generating, creating and instituting?
Everything that doesn’t allow that to
show up times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.

Masturbation
What if the purpose of masturbation
was to create a greater sensitivity in
your body so that you could be a greater
lover?
Class Participant:
Then I should be the greatest lover on
the planet!
Gary:
Yes, but have you been doing it for
that purpose—or have you been doing it
to get off?
Class Participant:
Ah, I’ve been doing it to get off.

Gary:
When the sole reason you masturbate
is to get off, you’re trying to dissipate
the sexual energy that’s part of life and
living.
Class Participant:
When masturbating, what is the value,
if any, of fantasizing about having sex or
copulation with the various women who
come into my life? For many years, I
have had sex with women in my mind
and my hand, and then I’ve felt that the
act was completed.
Gary:
And it is. That’s one of the reasons

you do it. The question you’re not asking
is: Do these women wish to have sex
with me? And if they do, ask: What
would be the most pleasurable thing to
give them?
If you’re going to fantasize at all, think
about what you would be doing to bring
their body to a higher level of rev and
vitality, because that’s what the purpose
of sex should be. That’s why you don’t
want to go to masturbation to get
completion; you want to get to the point
where your body is stimulated and you
feel more energy coming in. When that
occurs, quit. Go off and do something
else. That will do two things: Number

one, it will start to create a place in your
body where being sexually aroused is a
valuable product, and number two, it
will create more of a libido for you.
Look at masturbation from the point of
view of: What am I creating here? What
am I doing this for?
If you’re masturbating to just get off,
you’re not going to achieve a sense of
the greater energy that can occur from
copulation. The purpose of copulation
should be to make you more stimulated
to live, not to create the little death. The
little death is what the French call
ejaculation. So keep looking at: What is
it that I’m trying to accomplish by what

I’m doing?
Most people masturbate as a way of
desensitizing their penis instead of
sensitizing it. I know someone who took
two Rockhards, which is a stimulant for
the penis. He said, “All I had to do was
brush my penis against something and I’d
get a hard-on.” That’s a level of
sensitivity most men can’t handle and
most women don’t want to know you
have. Another friend mentioned that he
took a Rockhard when was wearing
loose pants without underwear, and the
pants just sort of rubbed around his
body. He said, “I had to stop in the
middle of the street and think of dead

rabbits because I couldn’t get rid of my
hard-on.” There are a different ways of
sensitizing yourself. Ask: How can I
sensitize myself so I’m ready to go at
any time?
Try stimulating your nipples and the
rest of your body by running your fingers
down and doing the galvanic response
until you get a hard-on. The next time
you have sex with a woman, you’re
going to be a much better lover, because
you’re going to be more sensitive and
more aware. You’re also going to have a
willingness to receive that is not
currently in your repertoire. Most men
don’t know how to receive a blow job,

and most women don’t know how to
give one. Now why is that?
Receiving
Class Participant:
It’s about receiving, isn’t it?
Gary:
Yes. You have never taught yourself to
receive; you’ve taught yourself to get off.
If you spend your life masturbating to get
off, you’re not increasing your capacity
to receive, which also limits the amount
of money you can have in your life.
You’ve got to get your body sensitized
again, because you have mostly cut it off.

Most sports are about slamming into
other guys. Is that what you call
sensitivity? It’s actually eliminating
sensitivity. Ask: How do I sensitize my
body so its galvanic responses create a
galvanic response in others?
The galvanic response is a system that
your body has that you may not be using.
Your body has automatic systems in it.
You 
have 
a 
somatic 
response
everywhere in your body. The way your
body responds to something is part of the
information your body is supposed to
get. You have elements in your body that
allow you to “respond” in a different
way to things. You can create a place in

you 
and 
your 
body 
where 
your
sensitivity and your sense of receiving
are more extreme. For example, most
men have never had their anus touched.
It’s one of the most sensitive parts of
their body, but they won’t even bother to
touch it. They wipe it with toilet paper,
but that’s about as far as they go.
Learn how responsive each part of
your body can be. It’s not that you’re
going to go gay. It doesn’t mean that a
woman is going to put a strap on and
fuck you in the ass, although that could
be fun too. Recognize that there’s a
different possibility in the way your
body receives. What would it be like if

you were willing to have more of that
and less of what you currently have? Is
what you currently have enough? Is what
you have what you want?
Seldom do people really get that
there’s a different choice. Most people
have the idea “I have to do this” or “I
have to do that” or “This is the only way
it is” or “This is the way it’s supposed
to be.” What if none of that was actually
real?
Creating a Molecular
Vibration between You and
the Woman
Class Participant:

You say that women usually do sex in
order to get relationship and men usually
do relationship in order to get sex.
Instead of being bound by this reality,
how can I have a different possibility?
For example, how can I have sex without
relationship? I have known quite a few
people who are shag masters, but I can’t
seem to understand why or how they can
be shag masters. It seems like it’s so
natural for them. How is that possible?
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
defend totally against being the shag
master you could be are you choosing?

Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Being a shag master is neither good
nor bad. You have to ask questions:
Does this woman really want to have sex
with me or does she desire something
else? More often than not, women who
would like to have sex with you want
something more from you than just sex,
but you don’t want to know that. You
figure, “Okay, I can shag her” and you
cut off your awareness in order to make
sure you get to shag.

When you get really good at being a
cunnilinguist, when you get really good
at using your fingers in a woman’s body
and you get her off four or five times
before you cum inside her, women will
want to come and visit you again and
again and again.
This is how you start creating the
place where you become a valuable
product. You’ve got to make yourself a
valuable product by sensitizing your
body enough that you can sense what her
body is feeling and have your body feel
what her body feels. Do the galvanic
response stuff so you can get to the point
where you can create communion

between the molecular structures of your
bodies. Ask: How can we create the
molecular vibration between us as
something greater than either one of us
can have alone?
Class Participant:
That’s what you are describing in The
Place isn’t it?
Gary:
Yes. That’s what I’m describing in
The Place. It’s what I’m trying to get
people to recognize: there is this place.
Have I had this place personally? Yes. I
was able to achieve it with a few
different women.

It wasn’t that I was a shag master. I
used my silver tongue in more ways than
one to get anything I wanted. I had
roommates who were good looking,
studly guys who used women. They’d get
a girlfriend and they’d be bored with her
after the first three times they had sex.
I’d ask, “What’s boring about the way
she has sex?”
Talk to Her
My roommates would say, “Uh, I’m
just tired of having to talk to her.” I
realized that if you’re willing to talk to
somebody, you get a lot further than if
you aren’t. So I started talking to these

girls, and I ended up going to bed with
them. The funny part about it is that they
all told me I was better than my
roommates because it wasn’t just about
sticking it in. They said they enjoyed sex
with me. You have to ask: What’s going
to be enjoyable for her? You can ask the
woman, “What’s the most enjoyable
thing for you?”
I was a little different. When I was
young, my point of view was I needed to
learn everything I could because I
wasn’t adequately endowed, so I would
try to find out what other people did. I
would ask the women I was with, “So
you were with this guy. What did he do

that I haven’t done?” or “What did he do
that was really great?” The women were
surprised I would ask, and they were
thrilled to be able to tell. You have to be
willing to ask, “What’s the best thing
anyone 
has 
ever 
done 
with 
you
sexually?” Find out what it is and then
ask, “Can you teach me how to do that?”
Guess what? If you ask them to teach
you, they’ll start to contribute to you.
This is how you get them on your team.
“Teach me how to do the best thing you
ever had. Teach me how to do it. Did I
do it well enough or is there something I
can improve?” You also ask the person’s
body, “What can I do different that

would be an improvement of this?”
People Connect as Bodies
There’s another thing about sensitizing
your body. Recognize that people don’t
connect as beings; they connect as
bodies. If you don’t get that people
connect as bodies instead of beings, your
behavior won’t make sense to you. We
tend to look at the person we’re with, or
the person we would like to be with,
based on where their body is and where
they are in time. This is why, when
somebody dies or when you lose a pet,
for example, you miss them so much.
You miss being able to touch them. When

you feel separate from another, you no
longer feel that your body is connected
to their body.
When you go through the major
changes that Access Consciousness
creates for you, there will tend to be a
sense of separation. That’s where you
ask: Have my body and I changed so
much that we’re no longer findable by
other people’s systems?
By systems, I mean the kinds of things
people look for to have a sense of being
connected to your body. They want to
know where your body is in space and
where you are in relationship to it.
That’s not necessarily the easiest or the

best choice, but that’s the way it’s done
here. As you go through these changes,
your relationship with money changes as
well—because is money for you, the
being, or is money for the body? It’s for
the body.
“You’re Mine”
Class Participant:
I went to a workshop where men and
women paired up, and the woman was to
ask the man for the touch she wanted. My
partner asked me, “Can you touch me as
if I’m yours?” She wanted me to touch
her as if I owned her or she was my
woman.

Gary:
What was that woman telling you?
That she liked men? That she didn’t like
men? Or that she wanted to own one?
Class Participant:
She wanted to own one.
Gary:
Yeah. 
What 
people 
say 
is 
an
indication of what is. Were you able to
satisfy her?
Class Participant:
Actually I was, and it expanded my
universe, because I hadn’t been willing
to go into that energy before. I had a
judgment that the energy “You’re mine”

was bad.
Gary:
There’s a difference between “You’re
mine” and “I own you.”
Class Participant:
The energy was “You’re mine.” That
was 
the 
energy 
she 
wanted 
to
experience.
Gary:
This is what you have to be willing to
look at:
• How do I own this woman forever?
• What can I do that would make her
so thrilled sexually that she can’t

imagine doing without me?
What Does This Person
Want?/What Do I Want?
Class Participant:
Dain talked about how sometimes we
humanoid men like to cuddle and be
romantic. Could you say some more
about that? That was out of my universe.
I am always getting into sex or
relationship.
Gary:
It’s not an either/or. You have to see
what the person you’re with wants. I
ask: Will it be easy? Will it be fun? Will

I learn something? What I learned is that
many women just wanted to cuddle and
not have sex, so I could go home. You’ve
got to look at:
• What do I want?
• What did I come for?
• Why am I here?
• Why do I want to cum with this
person?
• What is it I really desire?
• What is it I really require?
• Where is it I wish to go with this?
Most of us men never ask those
questions. Personally, I realized, “I have
all of these points of view about how

I’m supposed to be as a man based on
what women have told me I should be,
not what was going to actually work for
me. Oh! I need to look at what I really
want and not try to figure it out
according to what women want.” Most
men try to figure out what’s going to be
good for a woman and ignore what’s
going to be good for them.
What stupidity are you using to
defend totally against being the man
you can truly be are you choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
You might want to run:
What physical actualization of a
totally different sexual reality beyond
this reality am I now capable of
generating, creating, and instituting?
I’ve been trying to get you out of the
place where you make women the
authority, the reason, and the justification
for everything. When you stop doing this,
you start having a choice of being you,
having you, and seeing you as valuable.
I’d also like to see you get to the point
where, instead of choosing anyone who
will have sex with you, you start looking

for who would have sex with you that
would actually be fun for you.
So it’s not “Oh, she’ll have sex with
me” equals “I’ll take her.” Instead it’s:
• Will this be fun for me?
• Will I enjoy this?
• Will this make my life greater?
• Will this make everything I desire
more valuable, more phenomenal?
Do you see how different those
questions are from “Will she actually
have sex with me?” When you look at a
woman and you say, “Oh, I’ll bet she’s
it,” that’s a conclusion. That’s not a
question. A question is:

• Is she what I’m looking for?
• Is this going to be what I want it to
be?
How many of you are settling for
whatever you can get rather than
knowing exactly what you want and not
being willing to take less?
Everything 
that 
is

What commitment do you refuse to
make to you that if you made it to you

you

Guys, you’re not committing to you.
You’re committing to your women. Why
is it more important to you to commit to
a woman than to commit to yourself?
Nagging
Class Participant:

It’s to keep her satisfied, so she’s not
nagging at me.
Gary:
In other words, you’re expecting her
to nag you. You expect women to nag
you. Here’s the problem with that:
Because you’re trying to avoid being
nagged, you always pick women who
will nag you. That applies to all of you.
Class Participant:
Can we clear that now, please?
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
That 
is 
funny, 
because 
in 
my
relationship, the only thing I ever react
to is her nagging at me. I don’t care
about anything else, but when she nags at
me, I get really angry.
Gary:
But you always do what you can to
create her nagging at you.
Class Participant:
What am I still defending for or
against with my partner?
Gary:

Are you defending for her being a nag
so you can choose to leave her while
defending against her being a nag so you
can love her?
Class Participant:
That’s frightening.
Gary:
She’s actually a perfect relationship
for you. She’s a girl who will nag you
and nag you and nag you until you do
what she wants, which means you can be
mad at her for making you do what she
wants, but at least she will nag you.
Let me ask you another question. Have
you defined “nagging” as love?

Class Participant:
Apparently.
Gary:
Everything you’ve done to define
nagging as love, and all of you guys
who watched your mothers nag your
fathers because you knew that when a
woman was angry at a man and nagged
at him, it was true love, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
That is awesome. How much are love

and hate basically the same thing?
They’re different sides of the same coin.
I have started to change a lot of that. I
don’t react to my partner anymore when
she is nagging. I am in allowance of it
and I choose something different for me,
but for her, it’s like I’m disappearing
from her universe because I’m not
reacting to it.
Gary:
Yes, I know. She has defined nagging
as an act of love.
Class Participant:
What could I do different here? I don’t
know what to do or where to go.

Gary:
Well, what do you really want from
her?
Class Participant:
That’s a good question.
Gary:
You don’t even know what you want.
Let me ask you a question. What do you
want with a woman? That. What was the
energy that came up when I asked that
question?
Class Participant:
What I get is “someone who is not in
my way.”

Gary:
So you want a woman who’s not in
your way. Would that be your partner?
Class Participant:
(Laughs) Yes.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
So what do you want with a woman?
That.
Class Participant:

Somebody who is resisting or creating
a resistance, so I have something to fight.
Gary:
Cool.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Thank you, Gary. That was really
helpful. Before you asked that question, I
wasn’t aware that I was looking for
somebody who was creating some sort
of resistance or fight. I thought I was

doing something different.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gentlemen, I would like you all to run
this process between now and our next
call.
What stupidity am I using to create
the (the name of the most recent
relationship you’ve had or the person
you’re currently with) I am choosing?
So it’s: What stupidity am I using to

create the (person’s name) I am
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Do that with the person you’re with
now or the last person you were with.
You’ve chosen every woman you’ve
ever had in your life because it matched
some vibration. If you truly want to
create a change in your life, you’ve got
to find out what that vibration is. Okay,
gentlemen, there you go. I’ll talk with
you on our next call. Take care, my
friends. Bye-bye.

Class Participants:
Thank you so much!

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
8
What Is a Gentleman?
A gentleman comes from no
conclusion,and because he has no
judgment,
he opens the door to possibilities for
each and every person he touches.
Gary:
Hello, gentlemen. Does anyone have a
question?

Being a Gentleman
Class Participant:
When I think of the word gentleman, it
feels heavy to me. I feel that being a
gentleman is a limitation. In order to be
a gentleman, there are things you should
do and things you shouldn’t do. What is
your definition of gentleman?
Gary:
First of all, a gentleman is one who is
willing to recognize what a woman
needs and to deliver that.
Everything that doesn’t allow that
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Is there more to that definition?
Gary:
If you’re willing to be a gentleman,
you’re willing to see what a woman
requires of you. A gentleman doesn’t just
take in a man’s point of view. He is
willing to see the woman’s point of
view, as well. He is willing to see what
he can do that will create a different
possibility. If you are not willing to see
what you’re capable of creating as a
different possibility, are you truly able to

create what you’d like to create?
As an example, I can be a gentleman
and open the door for a woman when
she’s getting into a car. When I do this,
she says, “You’re such a gentleman.”
What that means from her point of view
is what you’re looking for, because in
order to create a relationship or sex with
anybody, you have to be what they’re
willing to have you be. If you’re willing
to be a gentleman, women look at you
from a different point of view. Is that
point of view judgment or no judgment?
It’s a point of view of no judgment.
That’s why being a gentleman is an
operative state here.

Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
If you have charge about being a
gentleman, it means that you have been
not a gentleman in way too many
lifetimes.
Everywhere you’ve done “not a
gentleman” and everywhere you’ve
gone to judging yourself for not being
a gentleman and everywhere you’ve
tried to pretend that you actually don’t
care about being a gentleman, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right

and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Can you talk about what it is to be a
gentleman outside of the woman in
relationship?
Gary:
If you’re a gentleman, you realize the
value of each and every person you’re
with. Gentlemen have no judgment of
anyone. They only have the awareness of
what might be possible for each and
every person they’re around. What if you
were willing to have the awareness of

everything that’s possible instead of the
judgment of what you should or
shouldn’t do?
Let’s say you’re a gentleman and
you’re out with a gay man and he’s your
friend. Do you flirt with him or do you
not flirt with him?
Class Participant:
I flirt with him.
Gary:
Yeah, because that’s what he requires
and desires of you. Does it mean you’re
going to do anything?
Class Participant:
No.

Gary:
No. It means you’re going to give him
what he desires of you. You have to be
willing to see what people desire of you.
If you’re not willing to be a gentleman,
you’re not willing to see what people
desire of you. A gentleman always
knows what is required and desired of
him and he delivers whatever he
chooses.
Class Participant:
How do you do that without divorcing
yourself—because that’s what I do?
Gary:
So you’re out with a gay friend and

you flirt with him. Do you have sex with
him?
Class Participant:
Probably not. But I might. Who knows,
actually?
Gary:
Good. You’re always open to the
possibility of what might occur rather
than concluding and judging what can or
cannot occur.
Class Participant:
What’s the difference between a
gentleman and a slut?
Gary:

A gentleman is a very good slut,
because he has no judgment of what he
does or what anybody else does. A
gentleman doesn’t come to conclusion or
judgment. If you were going to look for
the opposite of gentleman you might look
for a sexist. That’s close to being the
opposite of gentleman.
A sexist is one who has determined
what is right. He has decided that it’s the
way it’s supposed to be and that’s what
you have to do. Being a gentleman means
you’re looking for the possibilities,
you’re not looking for the conclusions,
and you’re not looking for the judgment.
Class Participant:

Wow. 
I’m 
getting 
some
acknowledgment or recognition here.
Gary:
It’s the willingness to be something
other people aren’t willing to be.
Class Participant:
Wow.
Gary:
I’m seventy years old and women who
are thirty tell me they would rather be
with me than Dain because they know I
would not hurt them and Dain would. Is
that really true?
Class Participant:

No.
Gary:
No, the only thing that hurts anybody is
when you don’t give them what they
want. Dain is more likely to give them
what they think they want than I am. They
think Dain is going to turn out to be the
prince charming they thought they were
looking for. They know I’m too old to be
a prince charming, so what can I be? The
old man who takes care of them with the
elegance they deserve to be treated with.
A Gentleman Chooses
Possibility over Judgment
People always choose judgment over

possibility. And as a true gentleman, you
will always choose possibility over
judgment, which invites people to
greater possibilities. Years ago I went
out to dinner with a woman and her
father, who was eighty-eight years old.
He was a gentleman of the old school.
He dressed elegantly and he looked
elegant. There was a woman at dinner
with us who was in her fifties and she
was all over him. Why? Because he
offered no judgment of her, only the
possibility of what might actually show
up.
A 
gentleman 
comes 
from 
no
conclusion, and because he has no

judgment, 
he 
opens 
the 
door 
to
possibilities for each and every person
he touches.
Everything that brought up for all of
you, will you destroy and uncreate all
of that? Right and Wrong, Good and
Bad, POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I have oftentimes heard women say,
“Sean Connery is such a gentleman.”
I ask, “Have you met him?”
The women say, “No, but he looks like
a gentleman.”
And I ask, “And I’m not?”

Ask Her to Step Up to a
Greater Possibility
Gary:
Sean Connery is willing to be elegant
in order to create a place in which
people will choose more elegance. If
you are a gentleman, you will always
ask for everyone to become more of
what they can be, not less. How many
times have you had sex with a woman
and asked her to become less of what
she is? A lot, a little, or megatons? If you
ask a woman to give herself to you, are
you asking her to be all of her, or less of
her?

Class Participant:
Less of her.
Gary:
Yeah. As a gentleman, you always ask
her to step up to a greater possibility,
and if you do that, possibility will occur.
She will step up to a greater sexual
energy than you’ve ever had before.
Most of you ask for a woman to give
herself to you, which is not asking her to
be more of her. You don’t ask her to step
up to a greater possibility than she ever
knew was possible. What if you were
asking the women you have sex with to
step up to something they wouldn’t even

know is possible?
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
What would it look like to ask a
woman to do that?
Gary:
It would be “Hey, can I do this for
you?” Years ago, I would ask women,
“What has somebody done for you that
nobody else has ever done for you, that
if it were done for you would give you

more than you ever thought was
possible?” I always wanted to know
what others guys had done that I didn’t
do. Now why would I do that?
Class Participant:
To find out what she likes?
Gary:
Yeah! To find out what she likes, what
makes her happy, and what makes her
body sing. If you ask what some other
man has done for her that nobody else
has done, you will get the energy of it.
When you’re willing to deliver that
energy, you’re being a gentleman who’s
willing to give her everything she ever

desired, everything she ever wanted, and
everything she ever thought was great.
Everything that doesn’t allow you to
perceive, know, be, and receive that,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I’m not as fucked up as I thought I
was.
Gary:
Is that you, Mr. Shag Master?
Class Participant:
Yeah. It’s he who gives himself up to a

woman instantaneously.
Gary:
Have you ever heard me tell you that
you’re not as fucked up as you think you
are?
Class Participant:
Yeah. I’ve heard it a couple of times.
Gary:
Yeah, but you never believed me, did
you?
Class Participant:
I’ve heard that maybe 2,000 times.
Gary:
The next time I see you, you have to

give me a euro to prove that I wasn’t
wrong.
What you’re capable of and what you
do are two different things. What if they
weren’t two different things? Do you
keep trying to see how you’re wrong—
or how you’re right?
Class Participant:
How I’m wrong.
Gary:
What creation of sex and copulation
are you using to validate other
peoples’ realities and invalidate your
reality are you choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you

destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Yeah, I jump into other people’s
reality.
Gary:
Do you want to know that you do that?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
No, you don’t. You are always trying
to figure out how you’re not doing that

rather than seeing how you are doing it.
You have to be able to see what
someone requires and desires of you.
For example, when you think you want
to have sex with someone, do you cut off
your awareness in order to have sex?
Class Participant:
Oftentimes, yes.
Gary:
Not oftentimes. All the fucking time!
What stupidity are you using to
create the defense for and against the
copulation others are choosing for you
are you choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy

and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, all
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You Have to Create from
Your Reality
Class Participant:
Gary, this has been an amazing series.
Last night I had the most phenomenal
sex. There is a desire for me to have
more sex with this particular person and
explore this more. Is it possible to have
a Deal and Deliver with a woman about
how to have more without creating a
relationship?

Gary:
Thank God you have finally had this
experience. Sexual energy is about the
generative capacity of life and living and
the orgasmic quality of life and living
that most of us have never been willing
or able to have. Do you all get this?
Is it possible to have more with a
woman without creating relationship?
Probably not. Would you like to believe
it was? Absolutely. Are you completely
delusional? Yeah, you’re a man. You
have to get that women look for a
different thing than men do. Women
aren’t in the same universe as you. More
often than not, they don’t understand

what you’re asking for or what you’re
interested in.
There’s a different possibility in life
for how you create that. You have to
create from your reality. Start running:
What 
energy, 
space, 
and
consciousness can I be that will allow
me to create the reality I know is
possible can I truly be? Everything
that doesn’t allow that to show up
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
There’s a new process I just came up
with, which I think is appropriate for

this:
What creation of sex and copulation
are you using to subordinate, absolve,
and resolve the choice and the
awareness you have in favor of the
reality of others are you choosing?
Everything that doesn’t allow that to
show up, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You keep trying to choose what will
work for the woman. It’s one of the
things men do. They always try to
choose what will work for the woman.
Is there a reason for that? Yeah. You

have been entrained and trained to
believe that the woman is the most
valuable product on the planet, not you.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What creation of sex and copulation
are you using as the subordination, the
absolution, and the resolution of your
choice and your awareness in favor of
other 
people’s 
reality 
are 
you
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You keep assuming that you’ve got to
give up your reality in favor of
somebody else’s. It’s not even giving up
your reality. It’s that you have no point of
view. You’re a man. You have no point
of view unless your penis is hard and
pointing in a direction. The one thing I
love 
about 
men 
is 
that 
they’re
completely insensitive to anybody else’s
awareness until their penis is pointing.
Penile seeking is the direction you know
how to follow.
Don’t you find it interesting that you
would always try to please and value

somebody else before you’d ever try to
see the value of you?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
Does that make sense?
Class Participant:
Well, no, it makes no sense.
Gary:
It’s the non-sensible universe that you
keep trying to create from. It doesn’t
work.
What Do You Want to

Create?
Class Participant:
On the last call when we talked about
sex, you said to get very good at
cunnilingus and using our fingers. You
said we would then have women who
want to come and visit again and again,
and that is how we start creating the
place where we become a valuable
product. It sounds to me like you’re
saying we are not valuable products, and
that we need to do something in order to
become a valuable product.
Gary:
Yes, in their eyes, you do.

Class Participant:
Isn’t that beingness instead of being?
You’ve said that being is you, the
infinite being you are and that beingness
is something you do to prove that you’re
being.
Gary:
You’ve got to look at what you’re
trying to create, not what you think it
should be. You can have all kinds of
wonderful points of view about what
should be and what ought to be that isn’t.
You’ve got to look at what is—not what
you want it to be.
Class Participant:

Can you please clarify this? It sounds
like you’re saying that men need
women’s acknowledgement to become
the valuable product.
Gary:
To become the valuable product in a
woman’s world, you have to please the
woman in ways that make her value the
sex you like more than she does.
Class Participant:
Doesn’t that make the woman more
valuable?
Gary:
Yes. What’s wrong with that?

Why Is Lust Considered a
Wrongness?
Class Participant:
Last month a female friend posted a
picture of us on Facebook where she
was all dressed up and wearing make-
up. She looked gorgeous, and many men
were commenting on her picture. They
praised her, and some tried to date her.
When I saw that, I noticed I felt a bit
angry. What am I missing here?
Gary:
Did you feel anger or did you feel
envy? You have to get clear about the
difference. My guess is you felt envy,

because you wanted to be lusted after the
way she was lusted after. How many of
you are refusing to be lusted after
because you think that makes you less?
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I had an awareness a few days later
that she was trying to control the
opposite sex with her looks and
appearance. And the anger was because
that’s exactly what I haven’t been

willing to do.
Gary:
You mean you only get angry at what
you yourself are doing or not doing?
Everything you’ve done to make it
real and true for you that you can’t be
the lustful person you truly be, will
you destroy and uncreate all of that?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What refusal of lust are you using to
invalidate the being you could be
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and

uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I have not been willing to take
advantage of my looks. Most of the time
I look normal, and sometimes I look
quite sloppy.
Gary:
I’d say, my sweet friend, that you’re
choosing to be sloppy as often as you
can because you don’t want people to
lust after you. Why is lust considered a
wrongness? I do not understand that.
What creation of lust are you using

to invalidate you and invalidate others
are you choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What creation of lust are you using
to 
invalidate 
your 
reality 
and
invalidate other people’s realities are
you choosing? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:

I’m confused about this. Are you
saying we lust after people to make us
less valuable?
Gary:
Sometimes. The thing is, you’re not
willing to see the value of lust.
Class Participant:
So what’s the value of lust?
Gary:
The value of lust is the place where
you come out of judgment and go into
“I’m going to do this no matter what it
looks like. No matter what it takes. No
matter what occurs.” Lust is not a
wrongness. Lust is a place in which you

cannot overcome your unwillingness to
be limited. You will choose lust over
limitation every time. Instead of seeing
that as an advantage and possibility, you
see it as a wrongness. Why? Because
you’ve been told forever that lust is
wrong. Is it really wrong—or is it just
where you sit?
When somebody wants to have sex
with you, do you say, “Wow, this person
wants to have sex with me. How cool is
that?” Or do you go to the conclusion,
“How can I do this and when can I do
this?” You have to be willing to look at
“And this person wants to have sex with
me for what reason?”

Class Participant:
That would be a change for me.
Gary:
A lot of people would choose to have
sex with you because a) you’re a man, b)
you’re sexual, c) you actually like
women, and d) you know how to do
fairly good cunnilingus, but only fairly
good, not good.
You boys need to learn how to do
better cunnilingus, by the way, in case
you didn’t know that.
What stupidity are you using to
create the defense for and against the
sex somebody else wants to have with

you are you choosing? Everything that
is times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
The other week, I got questioned by a
woman who wanted to have a date with
me. She was starting to defend that she
wouldn’t go to bed on the first date. So I
just asked her “Are you playing hard to
get or what?”
She asked, “Yeah, but who would you
be or what would you do to get to that?”
I said, “Uh, I would be me.”

She said, “Ah, you’ve got some self-
esteem there, right?”
So then I said, “Off my list. Piss off.”
Gary:
The female of the species is designed
for what purpose? To have babies or
have no babies?
Class Participant:
To have babies.
Gary:
Yeah, so who’s she going to choose?
A man who is good breeding stock.
She’ll look at one man and say, “He is
good breeding stock; therefore, I will
have sex with him.” She’ll look at

another guy and say, “He might have a
physical disability. He’s not a good
choice.” She’ll look at someone else and
say, “He has a disease. I don’t want
him,” or “He has an addiction, so he’s
not the best breeding stock.” It’s all
about who can she choose for the best
breeding stock.
Have you ever had a woman say to
you, “We could make such beautiful
children together?”
Class Participant:
Not so many, actually. It’s oftentimes
the other way around for me.
Gary:

You’re the one who is saying it, right?
But that’s what she’s feeding you to say
to her so she can get you to choose to do
that.
Who has another question?
Being Mean to Other Men
Class Participant:
I was once pissed off at another
fellow and I said to him, “The body has
four 
nervous 
systems—the 
central
nervous system, the sympathetic nervous
system, the apathetic nervous system,
and the last one, which is the one that is
most active in you.” Damn. He got
pissed off, and it was fun. Is that how

men operate?
Gary:
No. You felt like having sex with him
and the only way you could not have sex
with him was to avoid it by saying
something mean to him. Men do mean
things to other men because they want to
have sex with them.
Everything you’re unwilling to
perceive, know, be, and receive about
that, will you destroy and uncreate it
all? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Whenever you’re being mean to

another man, ask, “Am I choosing this
because I would like to have sex with
this guy?” It’s not acceptable in this
reality to have sex with another man, is
it? No. Not if you’re a heterosexual. So
why do you have to be a heterosexual?
Class Participant:
That’s the norm. To fit in.
Gary:
Everything you’re doing to make
that your reality rather than having
choice, will you destroy and uncreate
all of that? Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD and POC, All Nine,
Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

By the way, I am not trying to get you
to have sex with men. Please know that.
A gay guy doesn’t get mad with men. He
gets sexual with them. You guys get mad
with men.
Look back at all the places where you
got mad at men that you actually wanted
to have sex with.
Will you destroy and uncreate
everything that doesn’t allow you to
perceive, know, be, and receive that
you would have had a different
response if you’d been willing to have
sex? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.

I’m not advocating that you have sex
with men. I’m trying to give you the
freedom to look at what actually is, so
you know where your choices are. The
fact that you would be willing to have
sex with a man means you would be
willing to have somebody in your life
who was willing to have sex with you.
Class Participant:
Isn’t that a big part of receiving other
men? Not the copulation part, but the
receiving?
Gary:
Yeah. You have to receive when other
men find you sexual as well as when you

find you sexual. It’s not that you need to
have sex with men. What you need to
have is the awareness that you’re so
sexual that you create in everyone
around you the willingness to have sex.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Trying to Steal Other Men’s
Women
Class Participant:
You’ve said that humanoid men don’t
try to steal other men’s women.

Gary:
Yeah.
Class Participant:
I think of myself as a humanoid, yet I
can see that I’ve done that a couple of
times. What is that?
Gary:
Were you really trying to steal their
women or did their women want to make
their men jealous?
Class Participant:
That one.
Gary:
When you’re aware, you tend to look

at things from the point of view of “What
would this person want?” What would it
be like if you were willing to see what
would be possible with each and every
person instead of trying to deliver what
they want from you?
Class Participant:
And choose what works for me.
Gary:
Yeah, and the thing is, you’re so
psychically aware that when you go to
steal another man’s woman, it’s because
that woman wants to make the man
jealous. Dain was with a woman one
night and I was thinking, “I’m so jealous.

I can’t believe he’s having sex with this
woman.” I said, “What? Wait a minute!
Under the best of circumstances, that
could not be my point of view. What is
this?”
I realized it was her thought. She
wanted 
jealousy 
in 
somebody’s
universe. The next morning, I asked
Dain, “What happened last night? What
was going on?” He said, “Well, she
stayed the night because she was too
drunk to drive home, but she called her
boyfriend to say, ‘Don’t worry, I won’t
do anything,’ and then she wasn’t willing
to sleep with me. She slept on the floor. I
don’t understand this woman at all. She

said she wanted to have sex with me, but
then she wouldn’t.”
I asked, “Do you think she might have
been finding a way to make her
boyfriend jealous by going with you and
getting drunk so she couldn’t drive
home?”
Dain said, “Yes!”
Once that was spotted, I realized the
jealousy I was aware of was what Dain
wasn’t willing to be aware of. The
woman was trying to make her boyfriend
jealous. She pretended she was going up
to Dain’s room to sleep with him, but
she was doing it to get her boyfriend
jealous so he would have a meltdown. If

you’re not willing to see where people
are functioning from, you will always be
the effect of their insanity.
Everything you’ve done to make
yourself the effect of people’s insanity
instead of having the awareness of
when they’re being insane, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
I have known this shit forever. Why
don’t others?
Class Participant:
Because you’re weird.

Gary:
Yeah I know. It’s because I’m weird.
Taxation
Have any of you ever had sex with
someone and then felt you had to do
something for them to make it okay?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
That’s a form of taxation. It’s taxation
—not choice, not possibility, and not
creation and generation. Have you ever
gone down on somebody and thought that
they should go down on you?

Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
Or vice-versa?
Class Participant:
Is that taxation as well?
Gary:
Yes. “There is a tax I have to pay for
what I got.” Taxation is all the pieces
and parts of what you have to pay,
regardless of what else occurs. Doesn’t
that sound like fun?
Class Participant:
No. I’m over that.

Gary:
Cool. All right, next question.
A Sexual Reality beyond
This Reality
Class Participant:
Throughout these calls, I’ve noticed
the general tendency is for men to ask,
“How do I get better sex and more sex?”
Is that really what we’re here for?
Gary:
Well, that’s not what we’re here for,
but it’s part of what’s good about being
here.
Class Participant:

From my point of view, my lady is
very sexy and I adore her, but surely
there is more than just getting my dick
wet. From your point of view, what’s
beyond 
this 
that 
we 
haven’t 
yet
considered? What would it take to have
that?
Gary:
What physical actualization of a
sexual reality totally beyond this
reality are you now willing to
generate, 
create, 
and 
institute?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
It’s All a Judgment of
Receiving
Class Participant:
On these calls, there has been a lot of
talk about women and sex. Are we
talking about that because it’s so
interconnected to all the parts of our
lives, and it’s a way to…
Gary:
Unfortunately, we’ve spent a whole lot
of time trying to determine whether we
should have sex or shouldn’t have sex,
whether it’s appropriate to have sex or

not appropriate to have sex, whether we
are going to get more if we have sex or
not have more if we don’t have sex. Is
any of that judgment, or is all of that
judgment?
Class Participant:
It’s all about judgment, and does that
correlate into all of the judgments we
have in all areas, in the other parts of
our lives as well?
Gary:
It’s all a judgment of receiving.
Remember, sex is about receiving.
Class Participant:
I know, I know.

Gary:
Let’s say you’re going to have sex
with a woman. What are you willing to
receive from her? Anything or nothing?
Nothing.
Class Participant:
Nothing came up.
Gary:
Which is why you’re trying to have
sex with her, so you can give her
everything you don’t like about you.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Is there anything to say about the
opposite situation when you have more
to give than the other person can
receive?
Gary:
You’re still in the computation of what
you can give, not what you can receive.
If you were willing to see somebody
who could receive everything you are,
would you be trapped by that?
Class Participant:
I got a yes on that.
Gary:

That’s the problem. When you get
somebody who can receive everything
you are, you feel that somehow you’re
going to be trapped. Is that a truth, or is
that the lie, or is that the insanity you
keep trying to make real that actually
isn’t?
Class Participant:
Ah, shit!
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

You’re more interested in giving up
choice than not.
What creation of life, living, and
copulation are you using to enslave
yourself to the anti-consciousness and
unconsciousness you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Please get that most of you have
enslaved yourself to this reality. You
haven’t been willing to look at what
your choices are. You’re more interested
in what choices you don’t have. It’s not

your best choice.
Class Participant:
I’ve been seeing a beautiful woman
and it has been really different this time.
It has been very easy. The sex is amazing
and so is the way I connect with her. It’s
just space. What is that? Is that me not
receiving her?
Gary:
No, that’s actually receiving,
Class Participant:
It’s so different I almost don’t know
what to do with it. I’m so unused to it.
Gary:

Yeah, you’ve never chosen a woman
who could actually receive from you,
have you?
Class Participant:
No, I haven’t.
Gary:
And have you ever chosen women
who actually cared about you?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
Why? Why would you choose women
who don’t care about you? Is that so you
don’t actually have to care about them?

Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
Everything you’ve done to choose
women you don’t have to care about,
will you destroy and uncreate all of
that? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Luckily, it’s only you who does that.
Class Participant:
Yeah, right.
Gary:
Why do you choose a woman you

don’t have to care about in order to
choose somebody to care about?
Class Participant:
That’s a really good question. Is it to
control myself out of not being greater?
Gary:
Is it to control yourself? Or is that the
way you guarantee you’ll never choose
to be the greatness of you?
Class Participant:
The second one.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and

uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Thank you, Gary. These calls rock my
world. I am so grateful for them.
Gary:
I’m so glad. Even if only six or eight
of you start to choose greater, you guys
may change the world, and I would
really like to see what goes on here
when sex and relationship are different.
Class Participant:
Let’s change the world!

What Kind of Future Is She
Trying to Create?
Gary:
Yeah. Originally, women’s job was to
be willing and able to create a future,
because women are more willing to see
it than most men are. It doesn’t mean
they’re better. It just means they’re more
willing.
Class Participant:
Is that also because women are more
likely to go out and conquer the world,
and men are more likely to stay in the
same place?
Gary:

Most humanoid men would rather
have a comfortable life and create a nest
for their children than go out in the
world and conquer it.
Women want to create a future. The
travesty done to women has been to
make them believe that their desire for
the future is about children, which is not
actually so. They are not doing what
they’re doing for children. They’re doing
what they’re doing for what will create a
different possibility.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
When you’re with a woman, guys, you
have to look at “What kind of future is
she trying to create here?” If she is trying
to create a future that is about having
children, she’s buying into this reality. Is
that the reality you want to live by? If
you get that she’s trying to create babies,
are you going to have the same kind of
relationship with her that you would if
she wasn’t?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
If you start looking at what the future

is that she is trying to create, you will no
longer buy the wrongness of you. When a
woman is willing to create a future that
includes you, it’s not going to make the
wrongness of you more real than the
choice you make.
What would you create if you knew
what future she was trying to create? If
she’s trying to create a greater future
than you’re willing to have, can you be
with her?
Class Participant:
I got a no for that.
Gary:
Yeah. That’s a no. You have to be

willing to create the future she’s willing
to have. How great a future is she
willing to have? If you’re willing to
know that, you can create anything with
her. You can create a relationship. Let’s
say you had a woman who desired to go
out and conquer the world and you were
perfectly happy being home, not doing a
whole lot. If that was the case, could that
woman stay with you?
Class Participant:
No.
Class Participant:
If that was the case, then what?
Gary:

Then you’d have to ask, “Can we
create anything good?”
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
The only way you can create a
relationship is if her desire for future
and your capacity to go there can match.
If you look at the relationships that
haven’t worked for you in the past, did
the woman have a desire for a future that
you had no desire for?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:

That is why those relationships didn’t
work.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
That explains why I have bailed out,
or pulled out, or chosen not to see a
woman anymore. It’s because I was
aware of the future. I was aware of it but
unwilling to see it and I made myself
wrong for it.
Gary:

If the woman has a future in which you
have to be a follower, are you going to
be any good at that?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
No. You’re not a follower. Are you
willing to be a leader?
Class Participant:
Yes, I am.
Gary:
Or are you trying to avoid the leader
you could be?
Class Participant:

Yeah, I am.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Please know that I’m not trying to
make you wrong. I want you to see what
has not been working in your life so you
can create something greater. It’s very
real to me that all of you have the ability
to create something other people don’t
have the ability to create, but you get so
involved with the women in your life.

You keep thinking they’re going to
choose something that’s going to make
everything work more easily. Is that
really possible?
Class Participant:
Not.
Stepping Out of Being
Stoppable
Class Participant:
I contacted my father today. I haven’t
spoken to him for thirteen years.
Gary:
What were you aware of with your
father that you didn’t want to be aware

of that kept you from talking to him?
Class Participant:
He missed me.
Gary:
That’s nice, but that’s not what you
were aware of.
Class Participant:
I think he’s sick as well.
Gary:
That’s not what you were aware of.
Was your father as sexual as you were?
Or was he more sexual?
Class Participant:
More.

Gary:
Did your mother like that or hate that?
Class Participant:
She hated that.
Gary:
Did you like it or hate it?
Class Participant:
I liked it.
Gary:
So did you want to grow up to be like
your father, but you resisted doing so?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:

Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
It hangs together that since I was born,
my mother has resisted me and rejected
him.
Gary:
Were you willing to tone down your
sexual energy to fit your mother’s need?
Class Participant:
Absolutely.

Gary:
How much of your sexual energy have
you toned down to fit other people’s
needs? A lot, a little, or megatons?
Class Participant:
The last one.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
How many of you have toned down
your sexual energy to match something
that was acceptable to your mothers,

or not acceptable to your fathers, or
too much like your fathers to be
acceptable 
to 
your 
mothers?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Just because you were capable of
being as sexual as your father was, or as
sexual as your mother was, or as sexual
as they were together—that’s the one.
You are not willing to be as sexual as
they were together because you assume
that’s what made you. I’m sorry. That
isn’t what made you. You slammed them

together to make you the body you
wanted. That didn’t make you, the being.
You were already you, the being.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You resist all of the sexual energy
from your own life in order not to be as
sexual as your father and your mother
were together in order not to create
somebody like you. That’s cool, and of
course that doesn’t require any judgment
of you, does it?

Class Participant:
Oh my God.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
It’s amazing you guys can walk, talk,
and chew gum, let alone get an erection.
Class Participant:
That also explains the reason why I’m
looking for other things to judge, fix, or
comb over.
Gary:

Why is it that you don’t get that you
are amazing? Why is seeing how
amazing 
you 
are 
untenable,
unfathomable, and inappropriate to you?
How much of you have you made
inappropriate 
because 
you 
were
concerned that you would be as sexual
as your father and your mother were
together, which is what you created in
them in order to create your body? Are
you not willing to create somebody as
great as you and give them a body equal
to what you got? That would be a yes.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
That would invalidate everybody else.
Gary:
Would it invalidate everybody else or
would it inspire everybody else?
Class Participant:
Yeah, it would inspire.
Gary:
How many of you are refusing to
inspire others dynamically so you can
perspire yourself out of existence?
Everything that is times a godzillion,

will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
It’s where we put up all of these
inventions and standards and whatever
we can come up with to box ourselves
in.
Gary:
Well, is any of that actually yours?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:

What creation of your sexuality are
you refusing that you truly could be
choosing that if you would choose it
would create a whole different
universe for you? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Oh, good Lord. Are you kidding me?
Gary:
What creation of your sexuality are
you refusing that if you didn’t refuse it
would actually allow you to be

everything you are? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You guys are doing a lot to refuse your
own sexual energy.
What sexual energy of you are you
refusing in order to create the
limitations 
you 
are 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.

Class Participant:
I’ve always refused my sexual energy.
Gary:
Why? Because nobody could receive
it? Or because if you would be it, you’d
have to be something you didn’t think
you were capable of?
Class Participant:
Oh, shit.
Class Participant:
When I listen to you talk about this, the
word that comes up for me is
unfathomable. It’s unfathomable to step
into that much sexualness.

Gary:
Do you mean stepping out of being
stoppable?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I got to a place where my body wasn’t
willing to have me do that. I broke out in
hives.

Gary:
Was your body really not willing to
have you do it? Or did you know that
your body would have to change if you
were willing to do it? And did your
body know that if you were willing to
choose it, it would have to change?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Gary:
It was telling you, “Okay, this is a
warning shot. If you continue down this
path, you’re going to change way more.”
Class Participant:
That’s interesting, because hives have
always shown up when I was about to
choose something else. Then I would
make myself wrong. I’d go into “What
am I doing wrong? I must be doing
something wrong.”
Gary:
So do you like to make yourself
wrong?
Class Participant:

Well, I’m good at it.
Gary:
If you’re doing it, the answer is yes.
And you are obviously destroying your
life.
Class Participant:
Yeah. I know it. Every time I go into
that place of wrongness, it’s definitely
not creating anything.
Gary:
That’s because you really wouldn’t
want to create anything, right?
Class Participant:
It was interesting for me to be at

home, on my own, while my partner was
away for a couple of weeks. I
recognized the energy of destruction
when it came up.
The Energy of Limitation
Gary:
Is it really the energy of destruction or
is it the energy of limitation?
Class Participant:
Right. That one.
Gary:
Why is limitation more important to
you than possibility?
Class Participant:

Well…
Gary:
Would you have to go beyond the
limits of what you have decided is the
reality you’re willing to have?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
Are you willing to do that?
Class Participant:
I get no.
Gary:
Why would you not be willing to go
beyond the limitations of what you’re

willing to have? Are you willing to live
within the limitations you’re currently
familiar with? Or are you willing to go
beyond what that energy can live with?
Class Participant:
I’m willing to go beyond.
Gary:
This is a demand you have to make of
yourself: Okay, no matter what it takes,
I’m going beyond every limitation here.
I’m not going to live my life from this
limited point of view. It doesn’t work
for me. And no matter who it works for,
it doesn’t work for me.
Class Participant:

Yep.
Gary:
What if it was never about what works
for somebody else? What if it was
always about what worked for you?
Class Participant:
Yeah. I like that.
Gary:
How much of your life have you done
what works for a woman because that’s
easier than what works for you?
Class Participant:
All of it.
Gary:

That’s where you’ve gone into being a
man instead of being a gentleman.
Class Participant:
Exactly.
Class Participant:
Gary, what are your thoughts on the
following clearing I’ve created? Can it
be improved in any way? In your
awareness, is it effective?
What 
energy, 
space, 
and
consciousness can my body and I be to
receive the sexual, nurturing, female
energies 
that 
are 
vibrationally
compatible for me?
Gary:

Well, I’d say there is only one
limitation in it.
What 
energy, 
space, 
and
consciousness can my body and I be to
receive the sexual, nurturing energy
that is vibrationally compatible for me
and my body in totality?
It may not be just female energies that
are sexually nurturing to you. What if
there are also male energies that
contribute to you in dynamic ways?
Would you be willing to receive that?
There are some men, who by being your
friend, can give you more than females
can. If you make it about female energy,
you’ve defined the limitations of what

you’re willing to have as a reality. And
is there actually female energy? Or is
there the energy of people who have
chosen a female body? That’s the only
difference I would make in the clearing.
Class Participant:
Thanks for these calls, Gary. They’re
awesome.
Class Participant:
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Gary:
Thank you, gentlemen, for being on
these calls. I hope that they might change
the future in some way so there’s more
freedom for men and women.

Class Participant:
Thank you Gary. You’re wonderful.
Gary:
Thanks for being the amazing men you
are.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
9
What Do You
Actually Want in a
Relationship?
If you have a relationship,it should be
something that adds to your life
and makes it greater and better and
more fun.
If a relationship doesn’t do that, why
be in one?

Gary:
Hello, gentlemen. Let’s begin with a
question.
The Perfection of Women
Class Participant:
On the last call, you said that a
gentleman is willing to recognize what a
woman needs and requires and he is
willing to deliver that. I’ve been asking
myself, “What’s the value of that?” It
doesn’t seem to do any good for the man.
My ex-girlfriend used that gentleman
thing against me. She would say things
like, “You should do this—or you are

not a gentleman,” and from her point of
view, not being a gentleman was a
wrongness.
Gary:
No. From your point of view, it was a
wrongness, which is why you were
willing to have her say, “You need to do
this” and you did it. Women will use you
to get what they want.
If a woman says, “If you’re a
gentleman, you’ll do this,” it means she
wants to control you. Are you willing to
be controlled? Yes, to a certain extent,
but not totally. We recently came up with
a new process that is damn good. I’m

going to run that on all of you:
What 
bastardization 
of 
the
perfection of women are you using to
create the judgments, the limitations,
and the invitations to the demons, the
sirens, and the sylphs of anti-
consciousness and unconsciousness
are you choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
There is a perfection to women, but
it’s not about the things we think make
them perfect. What makes a woman
better than a man is the fact that she

doesn’t have to come to conclusion. She
doesn’t have to fix anything. She gets to
choose more than a man does. Part of the
perfection of women is that she can
change her mind—and men have to take
it. You have to be able to see this or else
you make yourself miserable.
When you create women as perfect,
you invite the demons, the sirens, and the
sylphs. The sirens are women who will
call a man to his death. The sylphs are
wraith-like beings that wisp in and out
of life but don’t actually become part of
it. We lock ourselves out of being aware
of what a woman is going to require and
desire of us, and then we try to control

the desires and requirements she says
she has. The desires and requirements
she says she has and the ones she
actually has are two different things.
What 
bastardization 
of 
the
perfection of women are you using to
create the judgments, the limitations,
and the invitations to the demons, the
sirens, and the sylphs of anti-
consciousness and unconsciousness
are you choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Okay, let’s go on to the next question.

Class Participant:
As a gentleman, how do you deal with
over-demanding bitches?
Gary:
You 
call 
them 
over-demanding
bitches! A woman who is truly a woman
will fight for creation of a future that has
not existed on planet earth. That’s what a
real woman will do. She will not try to
get you to fulfill all of her desires, all of
her hopes, and all of her requirements.
You have bought into too many of the
romantic comedies, the chick flicks
you’ve had to watch. As a gentleman
how do you deal with over-demanding

bitches? You call them over-demanding
bitches.
Pornography
Class Participant:
Can you do some clearings about
pornography? Even though I know it’s
not real and that whatever they are doing
is not nurturing to bodies, I find the turn-
on of porn more exciting than the real
world.
Gary:
Yes, and that would be a surprise
based on what? If you are functioning
from the illusions of pornography, you

don’t have to include anybody else in
your world. You don’t have to have a
real person in your life.
Class Participant:
Generally, I find that the girls in porn
are prettier and there is more variety. I
would like to clear that and be more
present with the girls in the real world.
Gary:
Well, you don’t need to have that if
you’d rather not. If you’d rather have
women in your life who are more like
women in pornography, you have to be
willing to settle for that kind of woman.
It sounds like you’ve been trying to get

nice girls to be not nice, and you choose
girls who are cute but not too cute, so
they won’t leave you. At the same time,
you’re not willing to have the sluts and
whores that will give you everything you
want sexually.
Everything that brought up times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
The Spells We Create
Dain and I did a radio show tonight
where we talked about the spells we
create. The way we create spells in our

life is by repeating something over and
over again as though it’s true. You cast
your own spell on things. “I want a girl
like this,” is a spell you’re casting. You
can’t have a girl that’s like a porn star
unless you go to the place where they
make porn flicks and find a girl who’s a
porn star. And you assume things about
her that have nothing to do with reality.
How many spells are you using to
create the necessity and love of porn
you are choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Every time you say, “My penis is too
small,” you cast a spell, so it can never
be seen as any bigger. And you can’t
ever make it bigger.
Class Participant:
And the perfection of woman would
also be a spell, right?
Gary:
Yes, you’ve tried to see women as
perfect your whole life. You’ve seen
them as greater than you, or providing
more than you, or some other thing.
A spell occurs when you take a fixed
point of view that creates a holding
pattern in the body. On top of the fixed

point of view you have of the body, there
is also a place where you say certain
things repeatedly. You create a spell
whenever you say, “I can’t” or “I won’t”
or “My life sucks” or “You’re wrong” or
any of that kind of stuff.
How many times have you been told
you were wrong by a woman? She was
casting a spell on you.
All of the spells that have been cast
on you by women to show you that
you’re wrong, that you’re not doing it
right, and that you need to be different
for them, will you destroy and
uncreate all of that? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You don’t need to be different for a
woman. You need to be what works for
you.
Class Participant:
Is that what I’ve been doing? Trying to
see myself through a woman’s eyes?
Gary:
Yes. Have you had a spell cast on you
so that you can only be seen through a
woman’s eyes?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:

Everything you’ve done to make you
viewable only through a woman’s
eyes, and of course, how often does a
woman let you step into her life and
see you through her eyes? Never.
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I was at the class where you first used
that process, and I perceived how the
energy changed in the whole group, for
both men and women, after this process.
It sounds like it’s a process for men, but

it seemed like it lightened up the
universe for women almost even more
than men. Can you talk about that?
Gary:
If you’re projecting at women that
they’re perfect, that is the spell you are
casting on them, so they have to be in
judgment of themselves to try and make
themselves perfect.
Class Participant:
Thank you.
Gary:
You’re welcome. When you’re trying
to make women perfect or you’re trying
to be perfect for women, you don’t have

the freedom to choose.
What 
bastardization 
of 
the
perfection of women are you using to
create the judgments, the limitations,
and the invitations to the demons, the
sirens, and the sylphs of anti-
consciousness and unconsciousness
are you choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
If you are always projecting, “This
woman is going to be perfect for me,”
you’re casting a spell on her to be
perfect for you. Projections are the way

spells get cast. Does that give her
freedom to be her? Does that give you
freedom to be you?
How many spells are you using to
create the trap you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
“I Can’t Stop Thinking
about Her”
Class Participant:
I recently met a woman, and I feel like
there’s a spell on me. I can’t stop

thinking about her. What’s going on with
that?
Gary:
Well, how many spells do you have
to keep you entranced with women?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
And you have no awareness, so you
never know when she’s thinking about
you, right?
Class Participant:
Exactly, which is weird, because she

has cut off all communication, yet the
pull is still there.
Gary:
Why did she cut off communication?
Class Participant:
I have mindfucked with that so much. I
haven’t got an answer for you.
Gary:
Yes, you do. What is it you don’t want
to know about what she chose that if you
knew it would set you free?
Class Participant:
She said she didn’t want to get hurt.
Gary:

Yeah, which means she wants to hurt
you.
Class Participant:
Yeah. She is doing that right now.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
What is it when people say they don’t
want to go into a relationship because
they’re afraid of being hurt? Is that an
attempt to control?

Gary:
It’s just manipulation. Women try to
control men. Why? Because you are
supposedly the guy who is going to go
away and do something to them. Do they
have any projections and expectations on
you?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
How many of those projections and
expectations are creating the wrongness
of you?
Class Participant:
Most of them.

Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
How can I use that sort of stuff to my
advantage? How can I change that? Or
can I change it?
Gary:
Do you want to be with somebody
who would willingly cut you to bits like
that?
Class Participant:

That’s a good question. I want to say
no, but then, really, it’s a yes. But for
what reason do I want to be with her?
Gary:
I don’t know. Maybe because you’re
just damn stupid.
Class Participant:
Yeah, I get that. Totally, yes.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the women you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
“I’ve Been Asking for That”
Class Participant:
What I’m stuck on is every time my
body is with her, it’s like wow. It’s
nurturing and I feel cared for. I’ve been
asking for that.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using with
the 
women 
you 
are 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
What stupidity are you using to
create the hurting women you are
choosing, where you hurt them or they
hurt you? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
So the sex was nurturing and caring?
Class Participant:
Yeah, totally.
Gary:
And you have been asking for that?
Class Participant:

Yes, I have.
Gary:
What was she asking for that she
didn’t tell you?
Class Participant:
I just went blank.
Gary:
Yes, I know. That’s what you do so
you don’t have to know.
How much energy are you using to
create the blankness you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
What was she asking of you that she
didn’t tell you? What was it that you
knew she wanted?
Class Participant:
She wants a guy to take care of her
and her kid.
Do You Have Enough
Money for Her?
Gary:
Yep. Do you have enough money for
her?
Class Participant:
Not in this ten seconds, no.

Gary:
No wonder she got rid of you.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Gentlemen, you want to get to the
point where you have enough money,
because when you have the money, you
have the power. A woman will always
respect that you have the money. It
would be highly recommended that you
give up the spell and curses you have
that keep you from having money.

All of the spells and curses you
have that keep you from having money,
will you now revoke, recant, rescind,
reclaim, renounce, denounce, destroy
and uncreate, and return them all to
sender? Right and Wrong, Good and
Bad, POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Wow. That is opening up a totally new
universe.
Gary:
How much money would you have to
get for it to go the way you want it to go?
Over a million or less than a million?

Class Participant:
Probably over a million.
Gary:
How much energy have you used to
never have over a million so you can’t
have what you would really like to
have?
Class Participant:
Fucking tons.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Class Participant:
This conversation isn’t going the way
I want it to go.
Gary:
Welcome to being a man. It never goes
to the place you want it to go.
Class Participant:
Yeah, I’m frustrated, upset, and angry.
I want it to go the way I want it to go.
What 
is 
that 
frustration 
when
something’s not going your way? Is it
just blind stupidity?
Gary:
You’re a petulant little boy. When you
pitched a fit with your mom when you

were a kid, did you get what you
wanted?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary
Yeah, well, this is not a relationship
with your mum.
Class Participant:
So what can I do?
The Loving Sex You’d Like
to Have
Gary:
It’s not about getting what you want

from a female. It’s about what you have
to be, do, have, create, and generate to
have what you’d like.
What would you have to be, do,
have, create, or generate to get the
loving, nurturing sex you’d like to
have? Everything that doesn’t allow
that to show up times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I’ve never heard you say, “loving sex”
before. What’s that?

Gary:
I haven’t said it before, because for
most of you, that idea would be so
fucking foreign, you’d die rather than
choose it. To have that, you would have
to be willing to receive totally.
Class Participant:
When you ran that process, I had a lot
of space. It was “Okay, who would I
have to be?” It’s just me. I can create
and choose whatever I like in order to
get what I desire, and I can actually
receive what I would like to have.
Gary:
You could have it again. You’re

assuming you couldn’t. You’re also
assuming you’re only going to get it from
her. How many women create that as a
reality—that you’re never going to get it
from anybody else?
Class Participant:
Holy fuck, yeah.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Is that like a love potion or love spell

they create or that I buy into?
Gary:
It’s one you create on yourself. It’s the
spell of “I’ll never get it again. It was so
good this once, I can’t possibly get it
again.” You’ve completely wrapped
yourself up with “There’s not going to be
anybody else.”
How many of you guys have
decided that there won’t be another
one as good as the one you just had?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
Class Participant:
When I go into that vulnerability, it
feels so sad. I’ve been avoiding this
space for so long. When I step into, it’s
bleh.
Gary:
Really? Why is it sad? You just
stepped into something that you’ve
always wanted, and now you’re sad?
Did she have to choose what she chose?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:

Why did she choose that? Could it be
that she was getting too close to you and
that was scary as hell for her?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Why Women Want to Run
Away
Gary:
When you’re really vulnerable and
you’re really present and you’re really
enjoying sex, it is usually so intimidating
to women that they want to run away.
Class Participant:
Oh my God.

Gary:
If you’re that vulnerable with women,
it scares the shit out of them. They don’t
have control over you.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
I once went out with a woman, and we
had the best sex I’d ever had in my life.
It was just wonderful. She was not a
beautiful woman. She was smart, she
was fun, she was light, she was airy, she
loved the sex, and she was really good
at it.

I asked, “Can we go out again?”
She said, “No.”
I said, “What? Why not?”
She said, “You’re too good looking.
You will hurt me. You will leave me.”
So she had to leave.
Class Participant:
I had a massage from a woman the
other day and I was totally willing to
receive the massage from her. The next
day she said, “It was so cool that you
were willing to receive. That’s what all
women want—for men to receive.” Is
that actually true?
Gary:

To a certain extent, but not totally.
When they get a man to receive like that,
they tend to run away.
So you need to be happy with the 1-2-
3 system. First time’s for fun. Second
time you’re in relationship. Third time
you’re getting married. You have to get
what’s really going to happen, not try to
create it the way you think it ought to
happen.
What stupidity are you using to
create the illusions and delusions
about women you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?

and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
“I Shouldn’t Leave Her”
Class Participant:
I stayed in my last relationship for at
least a year longer than I should have. In
the last year of the relationship, it wasn’t
any fun at all. I wanted to quit, but I
didn’t know how. I pretended everything
was okay when I was with her. Being in
a relationship seems to be so hard.
Gary:
It’s “This doesn’t work for me. See
you later.” That’s how hard it really is.

Class Participant:
I kept having the thought, “She isn’t
doing anything wrong. I shouldn’t leave
her,” as if the only way I can quit a
relationship is if my partner is doing
something wrong or something bad.
Gary:
That’s where most of us go. It’s part of
the illusion and delusion of all of this
stuff.
Class Participant:
Every time I thought I had to leave, I’d
think, “If I leave her just like that, she
will feel hurt, and I will be the one with
all of the wrongness.” I didn’t want to be

judged that way. Because of that, I’ve
been unwilling to get into another
relationship. I’m afraid that something
similar will happen again, and I won’t
know how to handle it. It would be the
same old story with a different girl. I see
my friends having the same problem.
They stay in unhappy relationships and
don’t have the courage to end them.
Gary:
It’s called “Get the balls, dude.” You
have to go after it and end it. If it doesn’t
work, it doesn’t work. It’s not that the
relationship is wrong or the person is
doing something wrong. You have to
recognize what’s actually occurring at

the time and recognize whether it works
for you. I stayed in the relationship with
my ex-wife for a long time because I’d
tell myself, “There’s nothing really
wrong here.”
One day I asked, “What would have to
change for this relationship to work for
me?” I sat down and wrote down the
eight things that would have to change
for it to work for me. Once I got to
number eight and looked back at the list,
I realized that six of the things I wrote
down would require the leopard to
change her spots—and you cannot make
a leopard change its spots.
Six out of the eight meant this was not

a relationship that could expand my
reality or my life, and if you don’t have a
relationship that is about expanding your
life, it’s of little to no use. I know that
the majority of you think that if your
penis expands, then everything’s right,
because all of the blood has left your
head and you no longer have awareness.
Class Participant:
That is so true.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the illusions and delusions
about women you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,

will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Who knows what women really
require and desire? Do they truly desire
that much vulnerability and intimacy in a
relationship? No, it induces fear. Does a
man desire that much intimacy in
relationship? No, it induces fear. So
guess why relationships suck? Ninety
percent of them function from fear. They
have nothing to do with expanding your
life or making anything better.
Class Participant:

Gary, you’ve often asked me if I
desire a relationship, and I’ve given the
Access answer, “no,” when I’ve actually
found that it is something I would like to
have, but not in that sucky way.
Gary:
So why don’t you just say what is
true? “Yeah, but I don’t want a normal
relationship.” You guys have to come
away from the point of view that I have a
fixed viewpoint about relationship. I
don’t. The only fixed point of view I
have is “Why be in a crap one?”
Sometimes people say to me, “You
don’t like relationships.” No. It’s that I

don’t like bad relationships. I see no
reason for there to ever be a bad
relationship. If you have a relationship,
it should be something that adds to your
life and makes it greater and better and
more fun. If a relationship doesn’t do
that, why be in one?
If you want a relationship, get clear
about what you want as a relationship
and what you want in the relationship. If
what you want is caring, loving,
nurturing sex and a relationship that
expands your life, then ask for that to
come into your life.
Class Participant:

Gary, just to acknowledge you, I
would never be in the relationship I am
in now if it weren’t for you.
Gary:
Is it more fun for you than any other
relationship you’ve had?
Class Participant:
Yeah, and it looks like nothing I ever
thought it would look like.
Gary:
And how much of you do you have to
give up in order to have it?
Class Participant:
None.

Giving Up You
Gary:
That’s what you’ve got to ask for, guys
—a relationship where you have to give
up no part of you, and you get to have all
of you no matter what the situation is.
Women think they have to require you to
give yourself up, but if you give yourself
up, they want to get rid of you.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:

I’m starting to give up giving up me.
Gary:
Now we’re getting somewhere! Do
you notice there are more women who
find you attractive?
Class Participant:
Oh, yeah.
Gary:
Does your partner want you more now
than she did before?
Class Participant:
Yes. For so many years, I had
somebody else to run my universe when
it came to who was allowed to be in my

universe and who was not allowed to be
in my universe.
Gary:
So you gave up your choice in order to
be in relationship?
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
How many of you have given up
your choice of who you could have in
your life based on your relationship?
Everything that is times a godzillion,

Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD

I was talking to Dain one day and I
asked, “How come you stopped running
and doing all of the things you like?”
He said, “Because you don’t like to do
those things.”
I asked, “So when did we go into
relationship?” I didn’t know we were in
relationship, because relationship should
not be that. I did that when I was
married; there were people I wasn’t
allowed to invite to my house. Dain and
I allow whoever the other person wants
to come to the house. If we don’t want to
be around that person, we go to another
room, and give them the space to have

whatever they want. Stop giving yourself
up, because what a woman truly wants,
requires, and desires of a man is that he
not give himself up. She wants a man
who is willing to be everything he is
rather than just some of the things he is.
Everything

What Would Make You
Thrilled with Your Life?
In the next month, I would like all of
you to look at whether you would

actually like to have a relationship. Do
you really want a relationship? Would
you rather have great sex occasionally?
What would you like to have? What
would make you thrilled with your life?
That’s the most important thing you can
choose. If you choose that, women will
want you like crazy. If you don’t choose
that, you’ll be giving you up all the time
as though that’s what’s valuable.
What 
bastardization 
of 
the
perfection of women are you using to
create the judgments, the limitations,
and the invitations to the demons, the
sirens, and the sylphs of anti-
consciousness and unconsciousness

are you choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
If 
you 
truly 
want 
to 
have 
a
relationship, let’s get you a good one,
damn it. You’ve got “bad one” down to a
fine science. You need to look at
whether it’s going to work for you and
whether it’s going to work for the person
you want to have relationship with.
About a year ago, I realized there was
a woman I could have a relationship
with and it would really work for me,
but I saw that what she wanted was

something I couldn’t give her. The
relationship wasn’t going to work for
her. So I gave up the potential of the
relationship in favor of her getting what
she wanted.
Class Participant:
Are you saying that even if it would
have worked for you, since it wouldn’t
have worked for her, the problems
would have just ended up in your lap
again?
Gary:
Yes. You have to look at all those
things and be aware of them. You have to
look at this stuff from a different place.

You Need to Do Deal and
Deliver
Class Participant:
I have a woman around me at the
moment who is pissed at me a lot. What
am I doing to create that?
Gary:
Are you talking about your partner?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
Why is she pissed at you?
Class Participant:
That’s a big part of my question. I

don’t get it totally.
Gary:
No, you don’t want to get it.
Class Participant:
That might be true. Yeah, that is true.
Gary:
You don’t want to make her happy.
You would rather make her unhappy.
Class Participant:
Is that true?
Gary:
Watch the way you’re doing things.
Class Participant:
Can 
you 
give 
me 
some 
more

information on that? I thought I was
trying to make her happy.
I’m ready to hang this up because it’s
not fun enough at the moment. What
question can I ask here?
Gary:
What is it you’re not being or doing
that you could be or do that would
totally change the relationship? You guys
have to be willing to totally change the
relationship.
Currently you have a woman who is
not willing to communicate with you. If
you really want her, you have to say, “I
want to make a commitment to you.

What’s it going to take for that to occur,
and how’s that going to work for you?”
You need to do Deal and Deliver. Ask:
• Exactly what would you like this
relationship to look like?
• Exactly what do you expect of me?
• Exactly what do you want of me?
• Exactly what can I do to make you
happy?
Class Participant:
That makes it so much easier, doesn’t
it?
Commitment
Gary:

It does. Every woman wants a man
who declares himself first. They want
you to commit to them. If you commit to
them, they know everything’s going to
turn out fine. That’s more important to
them than almost anything else.
Class Participant:
What is that energy of commitment,
then? What’s so powerful about that?
Gary:
It’s powerful because you think it
actually means something. But for most
of 
you, 
being 
committed 
is 
a
straightjacket in which you have no
choice.

Class Participant:
Can you say some more about this?
Gary:
Were you committed to your former
wife?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Gary:
Were you able to end the commitment
with ease? And how many years was
that after you decided to quit?
Class Participant:
Two hundred million.
Gary:

Just thought I’d ask. So commitment
obviously means to you that you’re in a
straightjacket and your choices cease to
exist.
Class Participant:
If I make a commitment to a woman
with regards to Deal and Deliver, is that
allowing me to have an exit from the
straightjacket? Or doesn’t it require the
straightjacket?
Gary:
If you make a commitment from Deal
and Deliver, you know exactly what’s
expected of you. Currently you have the
idea that if you make a commitment, it

means you have to give up everything,
including you and everything you are,
which doesn’t give you much in the way
of choice.
Most of us men don’t want to know
what we know, and you, especially,
don’t want to know that you could do
your life without a woman. You want to
believe that without a woman, you’re a
loser and that having a woman in your
life makes you a winner.
Everywhere you’ve created that
curse and that spell, will you destroy
and uncreate all of that? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and

Beyonds.
I just got an email called “Men
Advice #78.” It said, “When a woman
says, ‘Just do what you want,’ do not
under any circumstances do what you
want.” 
Does 
that 
give 
you 
any
information about men and women?
Class Participant:
Yeah. That’s good to hear.
Gary:
So what do you always choose? For
you or for the woman?
Class Participant:
I always choose what she wants.

Gary:
Why do you always choose what she
wants?
Class Participant:
Because that’s hitting me harder in the
head than the lightness of the awareness
I had just before that.
Gary:
Yes, and if you had actually chosen for
you, would you be willing to give up you
for anything?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:

Everything you’ve done to give you
up for somebody else, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
I’ve tried to get you to look at this
before.
Class Participant:
Yep.
Gary:
Did you want it?
Class Participant:
No, I didn’t.

Gary:
Why not?
Class Participant:
It’s something about the control of
women.
Gary:
Do you like being controlled by
women or do you like to control
women?
Class Participant:
I’m trying to pretend that I like to
control women.
Gary:
Are you pretending you’re controlling

women or are you actually capable of
controlling women and refuse to do it in
order to make sure nobody knows what a
complete asshole you actually are?
Class Participant:
I’m capable of doing it, but I refuse to
do it.
Gary:
How much energy are all of you
using to try to hide the fact that you’re
a 
fucking 
asshole 
by 
women’s
standards? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All

Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Is that the same energy when I’m not
willing to make my partner pissed at
me?
Gary:
You do exactly what will make her
pissed at you so she looks like the idiot.
Class Participant:
Do I really do that? I like that. Yeah.
I’m not saying I don’t. I was not aware I
do that.
Gary:
It wasn’t that you weren’t aware of it.

You just weren’t willing to acknowledge
it, because if you did, you would not be
able to think as many good thoughts
about you to counteract what you have
decided is the wrongness of you.
Class Participant:
Exactly.
What Can I Be or Do
Different That Will Change
All of This?
Class Participant:
So what can I do and be different
instead?
Gary:

Now we’re getting to a good question!
Ask: What can I be or do different that
will change all of this?
Class Participant:
It’s like I’m on the brink of choosing
something different and I have no clue
what it is.
Gary:
Is it that you have no clue of what it is
—or is it that if you were willing to
choose it, it would change too much for
you too rapidly?
Class Participant:
Yeah, that too.
Gary:

Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Trying to Override Your
Body
Class Participant:
I recently slept with a woman, and
then we had lunch. In the evening, up in
the hotel room, I realized, “This isn’t
working. This isn’t fun. I can’t override
my body,” so I chose to leave.
Gary:

Why did you try to override your
body?
Class Participant:
Because I go into one of those
“deliver” moods. Even if I didn’t want
to, I’d have to perform and deliver. A
woman’s expectations of me.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create you as the eternal delivery boy
are you choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

So what do you love about being a
delivery boy?
Class Participant:
Nothing anymore.
Gary:
How many lifetimes have you been a
concubine? Are you still trying to live up
to your reputation? Are you still trying to
live up to your commitment to being
that? Or are you still trying to live up to
delivering—when you promised you
would never be delivered to?
Class Participant:
I think it was everything you just said
and more.

Gary:
All of the commitments you have to
being a universal sperm donor, will
you now give all that up, please?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What stupidity are you using to
create you as the concubine of all
women are you choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What 
bastardization 
of 
the

perfection of men are you using to
create you as the concubine, sperm
donor, and source for the creation of
the bodies of reality are you choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
With regard to the creation of future
bodies, is that in other lifetimes or is that
like tomorrow and the next day?
Gary:
Well, it’s the next day and forever.

That’s the value of men. This is why you
always think you have to get together
with a woman and why you never want
to get together with a woman.
Class Participant:
Yes. Universal sperm donor.
Gary:
You have a commitment to not making
more children. That’s the reason you
have not been interested in having sex
with some women—because they’re
capable of getting pregnant at that
moment.
If you’re committed to not having
children and you’re with somebody

who’s ready to have children, and she
has decided she’s going to trap you into
marriage or a relationship by having a
child with you, your body will say,
“Nope! We’re not going there,” which is
why you’re not interested and you go
home. Thank your body for saving your
ass.
All right, gentlemen. I’d like you to
decide to look at your life and ask:
• Would I truly like to have a
relationship?
• If I were to have a relationship that
was going to expand my life, what
would that look like?

• What would I like the person to have
as her basic personality?
Do you want her to dress well? Do
you want her to spend a lot of money?
Where do you want her to be? You also
have to put down all of the things you
would like her not to be, because the
only way you’re going to get what you
really want is by knowing what you want
as well as what you don’t want.
Please look at this and see if you’d
actually like to have a relationship. You
are humanoid men who would prefer to
have an extremely comfortable place to
nest. That’s not a wrongness, but you
have a tendency to pick the wrong

women for that. I want to get you on the
track of being able to choose the kind of
women you really want.
All right, my friends, great to have you
on the call.
Class Participant:
Thanks Gary, you’re awesome.
Class Participants:
Thank you.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB

The Aggressive
Presence
of Sexualness
The more you have question, the more
presence you are.
The more presence you are, the more
control you have.

Aggressive Presence
Gary:
Hello, gentlemen. I’d like to talk about
aggressive 
presence. 
Aggressive
presence means you don’t give yourself
up for anybody and you always have a
question. When you’re an aggressive
presence, you do not adjust yourself to
other people’s realities. People tend to
adjust their reality to yours.
Class Participant:
Recently there was someone I didn’t
want to be around because I didn’t like
the way he had treated my son. I was
stuck on that rather than asking, “What

would it look like if I could just be me
around anyone?” I realized how much of
me I cut off in order to avoid him.
What’s it going to take to have
aggressive presence?
Gary:
What if you had been willing to say,
“Hey, be kind to my son, mister. He’s
important to me”?
Class Participant:
Is that aggressive presence? 
Gary:
It’s also an unwillingness to eat shit. If
you’re aggressively present, you don’t
take shit from anybody.

Class Participant:
And you become aware of things when
they show up?
Gary:
Yeah. You become aware: “Oh, this
guy is being forceful with my son. He is
not being aggressively present with
him.” You’ve got to be kinder. You’ve
got to be aggressively kind.
Class Participant:
When I’ve seen you do that, Gary, you
don’t make things into a fight. I seem to
go into a place of fight.
Gary:
That’s what you’ve been taught. You

think that makes you a man. It makes you
a man’s man.
Class Participant:
Can you say more about what a man’s
man is?
Gary:
The idea is that when you’re a man’s
man, you will always be liked by men
and not necessarily by women. A man’s
man is somebody that all men think is
sexy and good too. Sean Connery would
be considered a man’s man, but Roger
Moore, who also played 007, wouldn’t.
He’d be considered too pretty.
Class Participant:

So a man’s man is considered a man
through a man’s eyes?
Gary:
Yes.
What can you be or do as a man that
if you would be or do it would give
you everything you desire in life?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Choosing for You
This is where you have to determine
what you want to have as your life. If

you were to have your own life, what
would you choose?
Class Participant:
That question is such a great tool for
me. It’s my number one question at the
moment: If I was choosing my reality,
what would I choose? The awareness I
had on that was how little I was actually
choosing for me.
Gary:
It’s interesting, isn’t it, when you
realize how little you choose for you?
Class Participant:
I also ask, “If I was choosing my
reality, who would I be?”

Gary:
Yeah.
If you were choosing your reality
sexually, who would you choose not to
get fucked by? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
How many of you tend to let women
and friends fuck you over?
Class Participant:
Yeah. And family.
Gary:
Yeah, and family. It’s much better with

family.
Class Participant:
And ourselves.
Gary:
Yeah.
If you were choosing who to have
sex with, who would you not allow to
fuck you over? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Being Sexually Aggressive
I am aggressive sexually, because I

will not cut my sexual energy off for a
male, or a female, or any one person, or
any two people—or anybody. I’m
always that no matter what. When you
are aggressively sexual, people are more
likely to adjust their reality to yours.
How many of you are always trying to
adjust your reality to a woman’s reality?
Class Participant:
That would be a yes.
Gary:
That’s a yes for everybody.
What 
bastardization 
of 
total
sexualness are you using to create the
elimination and eradication of the

aggressive presence of sexualness you
could be choosing are you choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
As men, we tend to be aggressive in
the sense of using force to get a woman
to go to bed with us. It has nothing to do
with kindness and caring. You say, “Hey,
baby, you ready?” How’s that going to
work? It’s not! How many women are
going to go for that? Not very many!
We’re taught how to be sexual from
porn 
flicks—none 
of 
which 
have

kindness or caring as part of their
reference material. It’s about how you
can twist her nipple six times this
direction and six times in the other
direction and it turns her on so much
she’s got to have you. Those images are
not real or true. That is not your best
choice.
You want to be so aggressively sexual
that women want to go to bed with you
just because you are so aggressively
present. How do you do that? You get
there by going to question:
• Will it be easy?
• Will it be fun?

• Will I learn something?
Functioning from Presence
The more you have question, the more
presence you are. The more presence
you are, the more control you have.
You keep trying to create conclusion
as a source of control. Let’s say you
wanted to sleep with somebody. What
question is that? It’s not a question! It’s a
conclusion. 
When 
you 
come 
to
conclusion, you think you’re going to
have more control over the situation and
that people will do what you want them
to do. But it ain’t so.
What makes conclusion greater than

question? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Have you misidentified control with
conclusion? Everywhere you’ve come
to the conclusion that conclusion is
creation, or conclusion is what’s
necessary for you to have control, will
you destroy and uncreate all of that?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
If you function from question at all,
women look at you and think, “Oh. He

might be the man for me.” That’s
because if you’re doing question, you’re
asking, “Is this woman the right person
for me?” and they pick it up from your
head. When you come to conclusion,
their point of view is you don’t care
about them.
The more you function from questions,
the more you’ll realize that what you
want is more fun sex. And the kind of
sex you want doesn’t exist much. Is that
at all real to you? So it reduces the
number of people you can choose to
have sex with, but it expands your
willingness to receive.

The Woman Who Doesn’t
Need You
Gary:
There’s another part of this. When you
function from aggressive presence, the
person doesn’t need you.
How many of you function from the
point of view that you want a woman
who needs you? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What you want is a woman who has
no need for you. This is the place you

should be functioning from. You’re
asking: “Okay, what would be fun for
me?” Not: “What do I have to do right?
What do I have to do wrong? What is
necessary?” but “What would I like to
create and generate here?”
How many of you have spent your
life trying to be needed by a woman?
How many of you were taught by your
mothers that every woman wants a
man who needs her? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:

I just realized I’m being something for
my woman and not for me.
Gary:
Yeah, that would be trying to make
yourself a needed item.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Class Participant:
Is that what we define as love when
we’re kids?
Gary:
Yeah, and that’s what you also define
as what will give you sex.
Class Participant:

Right. I watch it with my son. He goes
to his mom and she needs him. She needs
him and then he comes to me and I don’t
need him at all. Does he have confusion
with that?
Gary:
No. He’s being taught by his mother to
have a woman who will need him.
Class Participant:
Right.
Gary:
How many of you were taught to be
the man you were supposed to be, to
be needed by your mother? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you

destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
When I’m with my father, it’s so
simple. When I go to see my mother, she
needs me. It has always been that way.
What is that? Are women entrained to
that?
Gary:
Women are entrained to believe that’s
the way it’s supposed to be. Your father
wanted you to grow up to be a man’s
man. Your mother wanted you to grow

up to be needed by a woman. Nowhere
were you involved in the computation.
No one asked you, “What do you want?
What do you want to be? What’s
important to you?”
Class Participant:
That feels like abuse to me. Is it?
Gary:
Nope. It’s neglect.
Class Participant:
Can you talk more about the difference
between neglect and abuse?
Gary:
You think it’s abuse to not be

acknowledged as you. But it seldom has
anything to do with abuse. It has to do
with neglect, because most parents don’t
know what is actually happening. They
don’t know how to deal with anything,
so they go into a neglectful state. And
most of you choose women who go into
neglect of you after a while, too, because
your tendency is to find somebody who’s
like one or both of your parents. Being
neglected seems more real to you than
anything else.
Class Participant:
The woman I’m seeing right now has
no need of me whatsoever.

Gary:
Does that make you incredibly needy
of her?
Class Participant:
No, it’s something else.
Gary:
Do you feel neglected by her?
Class Participant:
That’s 
it. 
Yeah. 
It’s 
like 
I’ve
misidentified that non-need as neglect.
What is it that I’m unwilling to look at
here?
Gary:
So are you willing to be totally

needless of a woman?
Class Participant:
Not in this ten seconds, no.
Gary:
What stupidity are you using to
create the needfulness of women you
are choosing? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Aggressive Needlessness
Class Participant:
What would aggressive needlessness

with women look like?
Gary:
It would be the place where, instead
of looking for how you can get laid,
you’re asking:
• What do I really want from this
person?
• Can she provide it?
You seldom go into what somebody
can provide for you. Have you ever
noticed that?
Class Participant:
No, I’m always looking for what I can
provide for them.

Gary:
Yeah. 
You’re 
looking 
to 
be 
a
contribution. And they’re looking for you
to contribute even more. You think that
you never deliver enough. They’re
always right, and you’re wrong. How’s
that working?
Class Participant:
Is that instead of saying, “If you can’t
give me what I want, piss off”?
Gary:
Yeah, and most women have that point
of view, “You can’t provide me with
what I want? Fuck off and go away.”

Aggressive Sexualness
Aggressive sexualness is the place
where you’re not willing to go out of
question. In this reality, aggression is
seen as anything that creates a question.
Have you ever had someone say, “Stop
asking all of those questions! Why are
you asking all those questions? What do
you want from me? How can you be like
that?” Asking a question is considered
wrong. It’s considered aggression unless
you say in advance, “Hey, can I ask you
a question, please?”
If you ask, “Can I ask you a question?”
nobody takes offense. But if you present
a question without first asking, the other

person will go to offense. They go to
offense and then they go to defense.
Those are places you get into trouble
with women.
When a Woman Can’t Have
an Orgasm
Class Participant:
What is it when a woman has
difficulty having an orgasm or can’t have
an orgasm?
Gary:
Usually the reason a woman can’t
have an orgasm is because she’s not
actually in her body. When you’re having

sex, keep the lights on. Lift your body off
of hers; do not lay down on her so she
can hide her eyes. And every time you
see her close her eyes, say, “Come back,
please. Come back. Open your eyes.
Please look at me. I want to feel the
connection to you. I want to feel the
connection to you and I want to feel the
connection to your body. Let me feel all
of you.” That’s how you start bringing
her back to her body and back to what’s
possible.
You just have to do that one thing of
getting her to stay with her body. Most
women who are non-orgasmic or non-
multiple 
orgasmic 
tend 
to 
be

disconnected from their body. Some of
them like to watch from the ceiling.
When you feel them go away or you feel
them step out of their body, ask, “Where
are you? Where’d you just go? What
happened?” 
When 
you 
ask 
those
questions, she’ll start to question.
You’ve got to get her back into question
because question creates presence.
Class Participant:
What questions can I ask of me that
would allow me to be aware when my
wife is doing that?
Gary:
Have the lights on—or at least have

candle light. Ask her to put her legs over
your shoulders so you can see one
another. Be with her and say, “I’m so
glad to be able to look into your eyes.
Looking into your eyes is the most
amazing thing. Stay with me, honey. I
really need this. I really need this.”
And then you have to ask, “Can you
cum or should I?”
Class Participant:
My wife and I have been together now
for about eight years and it’s only in the
last three months that she’s starting to
have an orgasm with me during sex.
She’s quite capable of doing it on her

own, but with me in the picture, it seems
to be a lot harder for her. I will start
going down the track that you’ve
suggested.
Does She Like to Have Sex
with Her Body—or as Her
Body?
Gary:
Some people, especially women, try
to stay out of their bodies during sex.
They don’t actually like to have a
connection to their body. If you really
want to have fun with sex, you have to
ask, “Does this person like to have sex
with her body or as her body?” A lot of

women stand outside the body and look
at it. Does the being have sex—or does
the body have sex?
Class Participant:
The body has sex.
Gary:
So you need to connect with the being
and the body. You want both. If you’ve
got both, you have the capacity for
greater stimulation.
Class Participant:
What would that look like? Or what
questions could I ask to be even more
connected in the body and the being
during sex?

Gary:
You have to have the willingness to
see what the other person is willing to
have.
How much of your energy are you
using to blind yourself to what other
people are capable of? A lot, a little,
or megatons? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
And then you ask, “Where to touch
her? When to touch her? How much to

touch her?”
Gary:
All you have to do is ask the body. It
will tell you where to touch.
“There’s an Energy with My
Penis”
Class Participant:
I’ve been having lots of really great
sex, and I’m finding that there’s an
energy with my penis that is much more
dynamic. What tips would you have for
when I have my penis in the woman’s
vagina? What energies could I be with
that 
that 
would 
give 
me 
more

awareness?
Gary:
When you have your penis in a
woman’s vagina, instead of doing the in-
and-out thing, try holding still and
flexing your penis while putting energy
into it, so it’s as though you’re going in
and out without moving.
Class Participant:
I can do that.
Gary:
And put energy through your whole
hip structure as well. There’s a good
chance that the woman will have an
orgasm just by you doing that.

Class Participant:
Thank you.
Class Participant:
I’ve noticed that when I’m inside the
woman, there seems to be a lot more
space in the vagina than I’ve been used
to.
Gary:
Are you trying to fill up that space or
are you creating the space?
Class Participant:
I’ve been trying to fill that space
rather than creating it.
Gary:

What if you created the space as
something 
that 
contributed 
to 
the
orgasmic quality of what you’re doing?
Class Participant:
Wow! I see that I bought the idea that
it should be a tight fit.
Gary:
Well, how many pieces of crap told
you that was the way it was supposed to
be?
Class Participant:
Lots.
Gary:
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Could you ask your penis to be the
energy that filled the space instead of the
organ that fills the space?
Class Participant:
Will do.
Gary:
Cool.
Class Participant:
Thank you so much. Wow.
“Why Can’t I Have

Multiple Orgasms, Too?”
Class Participant:
I’m getting a bit jealous of women.
Why can’t I have multiple orgasms, too?
Gary:
You can have multiple orgasms. You
don’t have to ejaculate to have an
orgasm. If I lie on my back, I can have
six or eight orgasms without ever
ejaculating.
Class Participant:
How do you do that?
Gary:
I trained myself so that when I was on

my back I wouldn’t cum too quickly; I
wanted the woman to get more aroused.
Class Participant:
How did you train yourself?
Gary:
I just asked my body to show me a
different way.
Class Participant:
That question thing…
Class Participants:
(Laughter)
Gary:
I read about men being multiple
orgasmic and I asked, “How can I have

that?” I got “Get on your back,” so I
said, “Okay.” I got on my back and I let
her sit on top of me and grind till her
heart’s content, and I would use my
fingers with her and do all of that kind of
stuff. I’d do everything I could to make
things better for her, and eventually I
started having orgasms when I was on
my back. I would start to have orgasms
that 
wouldn’t 
necessarily 
be
ejaculations.
It’s a matter of asking your body,
“Body, what would it take for us to have
an orgasm without ejaculation?” When
you start looking at what you can create,
a different possibility starts to show up.

But you have to look from that place, not
from the other places you go.
With multiple orgasms, it feels like
you don’t need or desire to ejaculate, but
you don’t lose your erection. You have a
sense that if you go again you might have
an ejaculation, but you manage to not
have an ejaculation and things just get
better. You feel like you came, but you
didn’t cum. It feels like an inner orgasm
instead of an ejaculation.
Pleasing Yourself
Gary:
Aggressive sexualness is not about
waiting for a woman to want to have sex

with you. It’s about your willingness to
have sex for you. We tend to give up
masturbation, especially when we get
into relationships. When you give up
masturbation, you give up pleasing
yourself, and you give up the idea that
you’re going to have sex whether
anybody else likes it or not.
A man who is aggressive sexually will
have sex and then he’ll get in the shower
and masturbate.
Class Participant:
How does that work in a marriage?
Gary:
You beat off when you choose. You do

whatever you choose. You can say,
“Honey, I’m sorry. I really just have to
go beat off.” If she doesn’t like it, she’ll
say, “Why don’t you let me help you?”
or you could say to her, “You could
come and help if you want.”
Class Participant:
Yeah, I’ve done that a few times.
That’s been fun.
Gary:
There’s a different place to function
from. Try asking: If I was being all of the
sexualness I am, how would I function in
life?
If you were being all of the

sexualness you really are, how would
you function in life? Everything that
brought up times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Run these processes:
If I was functioning as I truly am,
how would I function sexually?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
If I was functioning sexually as me,

how would I function in life?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
There was a time when four women a
day were what I considered functioning.
Unfortunately, I didn’t get much of
anything else done.
Class Participant:
So Gary, what would that look like?
“What Would It Be Like to
Have Sex with This Man?”

Gary:
It would be looking at a man and
asking, “What would it be like to have
sex with this man?” It doesn’t mean you
have to have sex with him. When you’re
willing to look at what it would be like
to have sex with somebody, especially
someone of the same sex where that’s
not your usual preference, you begin to
see the sexual energy of women in a
different way, because you stop trying to
put sexual energy into “man” or
“woman.”
So start asking, “What would it be like
to have sex with this person?” When you
start to have that kind of aggressiveness

sexually, you begin to see what works
and what doesn’t work. And if you’re
willing to see what works and what
doesn’t work, you’re willing to do what
you do in a different way.
Class Participant:
I love that question, “What would it be
like to have sex with this man?” That
opens up a totally different possibility of
receiving. I received a totally different
energy from asking that about a man.
Gary:
Yeah, when you’re willing to ask that
about a man, you’re willing to see more
about what women will choose.

Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
And when you are a man and you’re
straight, and you look at a man from the
point of view “What would he be like to
have sex with?” you have to look at the
being and the body and see whether that
would be fun, which is what you don’t
do with women. You say, “Oh she’s
beautiful. I want her,” which is what
question? It’s not! With men, you’ll
maintain question.
With women you tend not to. If you
were willing to maintain the question,

would you have something greater?
Yeah, and that’s the important part of it.
When you get to the place where you can
look at a man and ask the question,
“Would he be fun to have sex with?” you
can begin to look at women and ask the
same question, “Would she be fun to
have sex with?” You’ll say, “Wow! I had
no idea I had so much awareness.”
Class Participant:
Oh, that’s great! Practice choosing
what’s lighter.
Gary:
That’s how you learn to choose better
people to have sex with.

Class Participant:
I have done that and it works.
Gary:
It does. It’s great.
Class Participant:
Wow. Awesome. I’m grateful.
Gary:
Okay, gentlemen, we’re through.
Class Participant:
Thank you, Mr. Douglas. You’re
wonderful.
Class Participant:
You are.
Class Participant:

It’s always a good one.
Gary:
And remember, try being on your back
and getting multiple orgasms. That’s
home play until next time. The first
person who gets to six orgasms before
he ejaculates wins a prize. Thank you. I
will talk to you next time. Bye-bye.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB

Choosing
Commitment
When you do commitment from
choice,you have to realize what is
actually possible.
It’s asking: What is possible here that
I haven’t considered?
Gary:
Hello, gentlemen. Let’s go to some

questions.
Manliness and Masculinity
Class Participant:
Can 
you 
talk 
about 
manliness,
masculinity, and how to look and sound
more manly and masculine? I don’t have
a deep voice like other men. Do you
have any suggestions for ways to
develop a deeper, more manly voice?
And what about the beard? I don’t have
a lot of beard, either. Is this genetic—or
is it changeable?
Gary:
It 
is 
genetic—and 
it 
can 
be

changeable. You need to ask: What
energy, space, and consciousness can my
body and I be to grow massive amounts
of hair with total ease? The only
problem with that is you’re liable to also
grow hair on your chest, your back, and
your testicles. Try it.
Class Participant:
Does that also work in the reverse?
For less body hair?
Gary:
Try: 
What 
energy, 
space, 
and
consciousness can I be to have less hair
with total ease?
But the problem with that is you might

also go bald.
So you’ve got a choice. You can be
bald with a lot of body hair, and then
she’ll spend all of her time working on
your body, or you can have thick, wavy
hair on your head, and she’ll spend all of
her time with her hand in your hair.
Where do you want her to put her hands?
Class Participant:
Everywhere.
Gary:
Exactly. That’s why you grow hair
everywhere. Stop judging it. Where did
you get the judgment about hair? There
are lots of women who don’t like hairy

men, but if they don’t like hairy men,
they won’t want you, and you won’t
want them. Choose the ones who like
lots of hair. And if you have a lot of hair
on your chest, take your shirt off at every
opportunity to show that you have a
hairy chest. Some women will like that.
And if you don’t have hair on your chest,
then take the opportunity to take your
shirt off so they know what your
equipment is like. Being masculine only
means you are willing to be something
that is not valuable on this planet.
For deepening your voice, try this:
What 
energy, 
space, 
and
consciousness can my body and I be

that would allow our voice to drop
two 
octaves 
with 
total 
ease?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
A Slipstream of Energy
Class Participant:
What is it when you feel like you’re in
a slipstream of energy that propels you
forward to be with another person and it
feels so light and easy? I had an
experience 
after 
the 
last 
Access
Consciousness seven-day event, where

for one week I vividly dreamed I was
having sex with a particular lady, and the
next week, it was actually happening.
We were in bed enacting the dream.
Leading up to this enjoyable time, I
was following a wave of energy toward
her and it felt so easy and energetically
pleasing. It felt like the energy of crazy
possible. It was very nice, I must say.
However, now I’m not sure about what
to do next.
Gary:
This is a place you have to stop going,
folks. You have a tendency to go into
“Oh, now what do I do?” Duh. Keep

going is what you do. If you have a
slipstream happening, slip it in, slip it
out, slip it in, slip it out, and enjoy the
hell out of yourself.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I am trying not to be too keen in case I
scare her off. How do I change it to get
more ease around where to go or what to
do next after having sex? I’d like to take
this possibility further.

Gary:
You’re going into head tripping, my
friend.
Everything you’ve done to make
yourself into a head tripper, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
What 
bastardization 
of 
infinite
sexualness are you using to create the
head tripper, heart tripper, and crotch
tripper you are choosing? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and

POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Could you explain what you meant
when you said he was going into head
tripping? Why is that head tripping?
Gary:
Number one, “I’m trying not to be too
keen.” That’s head tripping. It’s about
what you have to try to be or do. Number
two, “How do I change it to get more
ease around where to go or what to do
next?” Head tripping.
Class Participant:
Is that like trying to work out what’s

going to happen in the future rather than
asking a question?
Gary:
It’s what you create when you have
judgments about what you’re supposed
to have as a relationship or how you’re
supposed to be. When you make a choice
and judge that choice, you create a
solidity that requires the judgment to
extend forward and create your future.
You create a solid future based on those
judgments. Is that really what you would
like to choose?
“No judgment” equals a future without
judgment. “Judgment,” even a positive

judgment, equals a future with judgment.
How Many Futures Have
You Created That Are
Blocking Your Ability to
Create?
Every time you choose, you create.
Every choice creates, whether it is a
choice for you or against you. If you put
a judgment in there with that choice, you
create a future that is starting to happen,
which will create the judgment as future.
Let’s say you’re thirteen years old. You
find a girl and she has sex with you. You
say, “Oh my God, I have to love her
forever. I have to stick with her. I have

to have children with her. I have to have
all of that stuff.” Those are potential
futures you start to create based on your
judgments about what you did and what
you should do.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
All of those become something that
lock in as a potential future, and every
time you come close to somebody who
matches something like that, you add that
energy to that future to create a future
you decided should come true. None of
them are real.

How many futures with women have
you created that are currently blocking
your ability to create? I’m going to count
to four. The “one, two, three” clears the
past and the present. When “four” is
added, it changes the future you are
creating based on the decisions, choices,
and judgments you are making. On four,
we’re going to destroy and uncreate
them all. One... two... three... four. Thank
you.
All the stuff you’ve created about the
future with women, and how you can’t
have a future with a woman, and how
you have to have a future with a woman,
and without a future with a woman,

you’re not a real man, and all of the
places in which you can’t be without
having a woman, all of those futures,
will you destroy and uncreate all of
those on four: One... two... three... four.
Thank you.
What 
bastardization 
of 
infinite
commitment of being are you using to
create 
the 
necessity 
of 
sex,
relationship, copulation, and sexuality
are you choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
How many of you have the point of

view that without a woman, you can’t
be? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Have any of you ever had the feeling
that you were driven by your need for
sex or copulation or relationship?
Class Participant:
Yes.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
That’s what this is about. It’s the place

where you think you have no choice. You
think you have to do it. Where’s your
choice?
Getting to a Place Where
There Is a Real Choice
The whole idea of this series has been
to get you to the point where you can
have choice instead of thinking that you
somehow have no choice and you have
to do sex. If you can get to a place where
there is real choice, you don’t have to
give up any part of you to create a
relationship or sex, and in so doing, you
can have more presence and more fun.
What would it be like if sex was totally

fun for you?
Class Participant:
Yes, please.
Gary:
All the time. Every time.
What 
bastardization 
of 
infinite
commitment of being are you using to
create 
the 
necessity 
of 
sex,
relationship, copulation, and sexuality
are you choosing?
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.

Now, why do I say sexuality? Because
you get to a place where you figure you
have to have sex with a woman in order
to prove you’re a man. What does that
have to do with choice?
Class Participant:
Nothing.
Gary:
That means you only get to have sex
with half the population. The only time
you realize that it doesn’t really matter is
when you get put in prison and you have
nobody else but a man to have sex with.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and

uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
That was supposed to be funny. Where
is your sense of humor? Is it too late for
you to have a sense of humor?
Class Participant:
I think you have to do a POD and POC
about your humor so we can laugh at
your jokes.
Gary:
Everything that doesn’t allow you to
recognize my humor and how brilliant
it is, and everything that doesn’t allow
you to have a sense of humor about

sex, copulation, relationship, and
sexuality, and everything that doesn’t
allow you to play with every form of
sex, relationship, copulation, sexuality
you could possibly have, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Commitment as a
Decision/Commitment as a
Choice
Class Participant:
Gary, can you talk about commitment
and 
choice? 
Are 
we 
creating

commitment as a decision instead of
having it as a choice?
Gary:
Yes.
Class Participant:
Is that this reality’s take on what
commitment means?
Gary:
Yes.
All the futures you’ve created based
on that, will you destroy and uncreate
them all: One... two... three... four.
Thank you.
You guys have to get that you make

decisions about a commitment and then
you try to validate the commitment in
order to make it real and right.
Commitment as a Ten-
Second Choice
Class Participant:
You talk about choosing in ten-second
increments, 
and 
you’ve 
said 
that
commitment is a ten-second choice. I’m
confused about that. How does that
work?
Gary:
When you are choosing in ten-second
increments, in one ten-second increment,

you can say, “I love her.” In the next ten
seconds, you can say, “I don’t love her.”
You can say, “I love my business,” and
ten seconds later, you can say, “I don’t
love my business.” When you choose in
ten-second increments, there exists the
possibility of constant creation.
You guys have somehow come to the
weird point of view that commitment is
permanent. You think that once you make
a commitment, no other choice is
possible.
When you do commitment from
choice, you have to realize what is
actually possible. It’s asking: What is
possible here that I haven’t considered?

What if you looked at what was possible
instead of what you think it ought to be?
That’s different from trying to commit to
the commitment you already committed
to.
Class Participant:
That would be just too damn easy.
Gary:
Yeah, and that’s why you won’t have
ease in your life. You keep trying to look
for the hard parts and the bad parts
instead of what would make something
easy. What if you were doing whatever it
was from what was easy instead of what
was hard?

Class Participant:
That’s so brilliantly simple.
Gary:
It is simple. We keep looking at how
we can make something work that seems
not to work, rather than asking the
questions:
• What works about this?
• What doesn’t work about this?
For example, let’s say you make a
commitment to get married. Does that
mean you have to follow through? If you
get married to a woman, are you married
to her forever?
Class Participant:

No.
Gary:
You keep trying to come to a place you
think you can function from. You think
that’s going to create something greater
than actually being present. You keep
trying to figure out what it’s going to be
before you’ve even chosen it. How many
possible futures are you creating and
how many possible futures have you
created in order to create what doesn’t
work in your life? On four: One... two...
three... four. Thank you.
You’ve got to choose from a sense of
peace. 
What 
kind 
of 
peace 
and

possibility are available here that you
haven’t considered? The only reason to
be in a relationship is to have a sense of
peace, which is the sense of joy and
possibility and the sense that there is
somebody who has your back all the
time, somebody you can have fun with
sexually.
Class Participant:
And not just sexually.
Gary:
Yeah, and there should be a sense of
peace with the sex. If you have sex, you
shouldn’t have the point of view, “I wish
I hadn’t done this.” It should be “What

could I choose that I haven’t chosen?”
What would it be like if you chose
something that was greater?
Creating a Relationship
with Your Partner’s Kid
Class Participant:
Gary, I have a question about a
relationship I’m choosing with a four-
year-old girl. She is doing…I’m not sure
what to call it…protection or defense or
competition with me. Can I talk to her in
a way that will allow her to get that I’m
not stealing Mommy? That’s the thing
that’s coming up.

Gary:
Yes, you can say, “I like hanging out
with your mom. You like hanging out
with 
your 
mom. 
What 
kind 
of
relationship do you want to have with
me?”
Class Participant:
Cool. That’s really light.
Gary:
“What do you want me to be for you?
Do you want me to be your extra dad?
Do you want me to be your mother’s
friend? Do you want me to be your
friend? What do you want?”
Class Participant:

Yeah, and that will give her choice.
Awesome.
Gary:
Yep. She needs to have the choice.
When I got together with my ex-wife, she
had a son, Adam, who was sixteen and
out of control, and a daughter, Shannon,
who was six and out of control. I asked
Adam, “What do you want me to be in
your life? How do you want me to be in
your life? Do you want me to be your
mother’s husband? Do you want me to
be your stepdad? Do you want me to be
your wicked step dad? What do you
want me to be?” He chose for me to be
his dad and I said, “Okay, from now on I

am your dad.”
Class Participant:
And then you be that energy of
whatever the dad is?
Gary:
Yep. Exactly.
Class Participant:
So that might be the lawmaker or
whatever it is.
What’s a Dad to You?
Gary:
You have to ask, “What is a dad to
you?” Find out what their definition is of
being a dad or a brother or whatever.

Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
Let them define the relationship and
you do everything you can to be that.
Class Participant:
That makes it a lot easier.
Gary:
Yeah. You can adjust. They cannot.
Class Participant:
Yeah. I get that.
Gary:
Everybody expects a kid to adjust, and
it’s the wrong thing to do. At one point in

my relationship with my ex, Shannon
was treating me like shit. I asked her,
“How come you treat me like shit?”
She said, “Because you’re not my real
family.”
I said, “If you’re going to treat me like
shit, I’m going to treat you exactly the
same way you treat me, only worse.”
When she would treat me like shit, I
would treat her like shit. I’d give her
exactly the same shit she gave me, and
within three weeks, it all changed.
Class Participant:
Three weeks. That’s a long time!
Gary:

Yeah, it was a long time, but I got
through it. You’ve got to be the more
conscious one.
Class Participant:
Why can’t kids adjust?
Gary:
Because their whole life is about
having to change to everybody else’s
point of view. They feel like they have
no control over anything.
Class Participant:
So they can adjust, but we shouldn’t
expect them to?
Gary:

Well, everybody expects them to
adjust. You expect your kid to adjust to
your reality all the time. So the kid’s
point of view is “I have no control.”
And if a kid has no control, where does
he or she go to gain control? Anger,
rage, fury, and hate.
Class Participant:
Exactly.
Class Participant:
Is that what I’m doing with my son?
Creating my life and expecting that he
will want to come along?
Don’t Create a Conflict or a

Separation in Your Kids
Gary:
The other day you told him, “You’ve
got a choice. Do you want to go home to
your mom and school?” Saying “Do you
want to go back to school?” is one thing,
but using going home to his mom as a
punishment was not a good thing,
because his loyalty to his mom comes in
conflict with his desire to be with you.
Don’t create that in your kids.
Class Participant:
What could I have said?
Gary:
“Hey son, if you want to go home, I

can try to find somebody to take you
home.”
Class Participant:
Yup.
Gary:
Then he has choice.
Class Participant:
That’s so interesting! I never looked at
that till now. That would be treating him
the way I would like to have been
treated.
Gary:
Yeah. If you’re in a relationship with
someone and you treat your kid like that,

the kid has to create anger against the
person you’re in relationship with.
Class Participant:
Oh, all right.
Gary:
And that gives them little to no choice
in life.
Class Participant:
I am looking at how unkind it was to
ask my son, “Do you want to go home to
your mom and school?” Do you have any
more information you can give me about
how I was creating a separation with…
Gary:

Let’s say that you told him that
because you consider it a punishment to
send him to his mother. Does he consider
it a punishment?
Class Participant:
No.
Gary:
If you do that, he has to choose
between his mother—and you and your
partner. Who is he going to take it out
on?
Class Participant:
My partner.
Gary:

Yeah, because she’s the problem.
Class Participant:
Why would I do that? It’s so clear
now that it was unkind.
Gary:
It 
was 
just 
a 
moment 
of
thoughtlessness. You weren’t trying to do
anything intentionally. You were not
functioning from the awareness of the
result that was going to occur by the
choices you made.
Class Participant:
Yeah. Thanks.
Gary:

You haven’t done permanent damage.
Class Participant:
No, and his mom tells him, “I’ll send
you to live with your father! You’re just
like your father!” All of that is such an
unkindness. I hated her for doing that,
and I didn’t even notice I was doing it
with him too, until you said it.
Gary:
That’s because I’m willing to say
things no one else is willing to say.
Class Participant:
Can you tell me where else I’m doing
that?

Where Are You Trying to
Get Him to Prefer You over
Her?
Gary:
You have to look at where you’re
trying to get him to prefer you over her.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
The easier way to get him to prefer
you over her is to let him go stay with
her and just be you when he comes back.
Class Participant:
Yeah.

Gary:
My son’s mother was always trying to
prove that she was better than I was.
Today he wants her to go away and he
wants me to be around all the time.
Shannon’s mother never wanted me to be
anywhere near Shannon and never
wanted me to touch her. And today
Shannon wants to be around me. She
doesn’t want to be around her mother.
This is the way it works. The parent
who tries to prove he or she is better, the
parent who tries to control the kid, loses
the kid. If you’re not living with your
child’s mother, know that the kid is
always going to prefer you over your

mate. You have to make your kid number
one over your mate, and let your mate
know that you’re only doing it to keep
the kid happy. Who is your number one
priority? Your kid or your partner?
Class Participant:
My kid.
Gary:
So if he’s your number one priority,
what is your partner? She’s number one,
as well. You have to take time for each
one of them. Each one has their own
special time with you. Each one knows
that they are number one in your book.
Class Participant:

Right, rather than trying to combine
them.
Gary:
Yeah, because the kid will begin to
feel like he’s losing his position and he
will resent your partner. You have to put
in a certain amount of time with the kid
until the kid feels like he no longer needs
you. It’s like pushing massive amounts of
energy at him until he’s had enough.
If you push massive amounts of energy
at a person, they either fill up or they
want to go away. Either way, they don’t
feel they’ve been left out.
Class Participant:

Whereas I’ve tried to give him
everything his mom can’t so…
Gary:
So that he’ll like you better.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Gary:
That’s only creating a place where he
has to choose against instead of for.
Class Participant:
That helps a lot. Thank you.
Gary:
The great thing for you is that your
partner likes your kid and she’s willing

to do things for him and give him things
that make him happy. That’s the thing that
makes it workable. When a kid lives
with his mother and his father, both
parents will dote on the kid. When
there’s a stepparent, the stepparent often
begins to feel resentful of the fact that the
kid takes so much energy and time. You
must never allow resentment to run your
relationship, which is why you must be
in question and ask: What can I create
here that I haven’t even considered?
“I’ve Tried to Be the Cool
Dad”
Class Participant:

I’m so grateful for the stuff we brought
up. I’m looking at all of the places
where I’ve tried to be the cool dad or
the rich dad or the dad who has no point
of view, rather than somebody who
could just be around his kid. I’ve created
all of these places where I was trying to
do something.
Gary:
Yeah. And what did your mom teach
you? Did she teach you to try to be better
than your father?
Class Participant:
She tried to teach me to not be my
father, so I had to become him in order

to figure out how to not be him.
Gary:
Yeah, and at the same time, you’re still
trying to do what she did, which was to
prove that your father wasn’t as good as
she was.
Class Participant:
Yeah, so how much of my future is
still created by that?
Gary:
A lot. So can we destroy and uncreate
all of that?
Class Participant:
Yeah.

Gary:
One… two… three… four! Thank you.
A fair few others of you have mothers
and fathers who do the same thing.
Class Participant:
I want to say how grateful I am for this
conversation. I’m not a stepdad and I
don’t have a stepmom or anything like
that. I don’t even have kids, but the
awareness that is brought up by this
conversation is applicable to life in
general. It’s brilliant.
Gary:
If you see people making choices that
are going to create things they’re not

looking for, then you at least know what
to help them with or how to help them.
Class Participant:
Yeah.
Class Participant:
Can I ask one more thing about that?
Can we destroy and uncreate all of the
places where I’ve created it as my son’s
future?
Gary:
Everything you’ve done to create this
kind of future. All of the projections and
expectations you’ve had about others
that you’ve created as futures that are
locked in their universe and all of the

projections and expectations: One…
two… three… four! Thank you.
This happens with women too, when
women project that you should be in
their future. They look at you and say,
“Oh, he’s the man for me.” They start
trying to solidify into your reality a
future that should be, based on you being
with them. How many of you guys still
have those kinds of futures being
created?
Class Participant:
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Gary:
Yeah. Can we destroy and uncreate all

of those: One... two... three... four!
Thank you.
Class Participant:
That one is a huge one. Thank you so
much for bringing that up.
Class Participant:
And this applies with money, too.
When I met you, how many projections
did I have with money?
Gary:
Yep. Apparently the process about
having projections taken off of you for
your futures is giving you guys more
freedom than anything I’ve done tonight.
Class Participant:

You’ve 
told 
me 
that 
I’m
inappropriately generous, yet sometimes
my wife still accuses me of being
selfish. She thinks I don’t take her into
account enough. What is that?
Learn to Be Manipulative
Gary:
She’s a woman. If she’s not the
number one priority in your life and the
number one person you listen to and talk
to, her point of view is you’re not paying
enough attention to her. There are all
kinds of ways you can change this.
For example, make sure you bring her
a present at least once a week. It doesn’t

have to be big, just something that shows
you’re thinking about her. It can be a
single flower. Find a beautiful flower
and say, “Honey, I wanted to give this to
you, because it reminded me of you. It’s
so close to perfect, and I couldn’t
imagine anything more beautiful.” That’s
good for three days, and you’re likely to
get a blow job with it, as well. Guys,
you 
have 
to 
learn 
to 
be 
more
manipulative.
Class Participant:
Just little tokens of “I’m thinking of
you?” Can you go over a few more of
these things that would make life with a
woman even more fun and easy?

Gary:
Ask her, “What is it you would like
from me?” and be willing to hear the
answer she doesn’t tell you. Women do
something that I call subtext. You’ll ask a
question like that and they’ll say, “Oh,
nothing,” but it doesn’t mean “nothing.”
It means “I want you to know what I
want without my saying anything.”
If your woman does this, go shopping
with her and ask, “What do you like in
this window? What’s really exciting to
you?” until you begin to get an idea of
what her taste might be. Then you have a
choice.
Every time you’re with her, express

gratitude for her being in your life. “I’m
so grateful you’re in my life. I’m so
grateful for the gift of you.”
Class Participant:
I once said that to my partner, and she
almost cut my nuts off.
Gary:
Yes, because she thought it was a
manipulation. You should have said,
“Darling, I was serious. I really meant
it.”
Class Participant:
I see him tell her how beautiful she is
all the time. Is that expressing gratitude,
as well?

Gary:
Yes, that’s the one way she can
receive it.
Class Participant:
Yes, she can.
Gary:
She can receive “You’re so beautiful.
How did I get so lucky to have you in my
life?” You have to find out what the
person can receive. Give her what she
can receive. Don’t use the lines I give
you here. You’ve already got it worked
out. I’ve watched your partner get
prettier and prettier every year, and I’ve
watched the two of you get more in sync

and more connected to each other all of
the time.
Class Participant:
You once told me to give my partner
things nobody has ever given her. That
was fucking “Wow.”
Gary:
Dain and I once gave a woman who
works for us a necklace that was the
most 
expensive 
thing 
she’d 
ever
received, and it just cracked her
universe. As a result, we’ve made even
more money. When you’re willing to
acknowledge the fact that women
deserve that kind of stuff, they’ll say,

“Oh my God. This guy is really here for
me. I’ve got his back. I’m going for
him.”
And as Dain says, it’s not done from
the place of “Oh, this is going to be a
manipulation.” 
It’s 
done 
from 
the
gratitude and joy that are actually there,
because there’s a gratitude for everyone
who is in your universe and for
everything they gift and provide.
All right, gentlemen, it has been a
pleasure. I think you are some of the
coolest guys on the planet and the only
ones with courage enough to become
men.

Class Participant:
You’re awesome, Gary!
Class Participant:
Thanks Gary.

THE GENTLEMEN’S CLUB
12
Decoding Women’s
Subtext
Subtext is the way women function.
There’s “This is what she says” and
there’s “This is what she’s thinking.”
What she’s thinking is what you’re
supposed to do.
Gary:

Hello, gentlemen. Is anybody happy?
Class Participant:
Yeah. We’re really happy.
Class Participant:
We’re happy! Happy!
Gary:
All right, let’s go. Let me see what I
can create here. Let me see how
miserable I can make you. Who has a
question?
Cultural Entrainment
Class Participant:
I find myself more attracted to women
who are the same race and ethnicity as

me and who have the same skin color. Is
having sex with people of the same race
and ethnicity an implant or some
programming in the body?
Gary:
No, it’s an entrainment you learned
from your culture. We tend to be most
excited 
by 
people 
of 
the 
same
“ethnicity” because we’ve been trained
to believe they’re the most attractive. It’s
not programming; it’s entrainment.
A lot of guys look at a woman and say,
“Oh! She’s hot!” Is that really looking at
her? No, you’re objectifying her and
turning her into a “what” in your world

instead of being with her as a being.
How many entrainments do you
have to determine who or what you
will sleep with and who you won’t
sleep 
with 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?

“I Frequently Attract Gay
Men”
Class Participant:
It seems to me that I frequently attract
gay men. They like to flirt with me, and

it always makes me uncomfortable
because I’m not sure how to respond.
How do I create this?
Gary:
Well. I don’t know. It could be that
you’re actually sexy! The thing about gay
men is that they like men who are sexy. If
you’re sexy, gay men are going to go
after you. It doesn’t mean you’re gay,
although it would make it much easier if
you were. It means you’re good looking.
Too bad you’re a fool. You think you’re
not good looking because women don’t
go after you the way the men do. Dope,
dope, dope.

Class Participant:
Am I sending the wrong signal to gay
guys?
Gary:
No.
Class Participant:
How can I change this?
Gary:
Enjoy it. Recognize that it is just an
acknowledgment of what you’ve done
and what’s working for you.
Where Do You Need to Put
Your Energy?

Class Participant:
I’m starting a conscious relationship
with a woman, and I have found that I
have been moving more into my own
business 
and 
less 
into 
Access
Consciousness and supporting other
facilitators. Am I excluding Access to
create my relationship and my own
business?
Gary:
No. You have to be willing to see
where you need to put your energy each
day. That’s the most important part of all
of this. It’s not about giving up Access.
You have to go with: What’s going to be

the priority that’s going to create the best
result for me?
Class Participant:
What can I be or do different to have
them all as a priority?
Gary:
You can’t have them all as a priority.
You could recognize that there are times
when one thing is a priority and there are
times when another thing is. And if
you’re with a woman, she’s always the
priority.
Class Participant:
What can I be that will allow me to
receive 
more 
from 
Access

Consciousness and from you?
Gary:
What you can be is you. And if you’re
doing your business, if you’re doing all
of the things you’re talking about here,
everything should get better.
A Relationship with a Kid
Attached
Class Participant:
The relationship I have now has a kid
attached. I have found that talking to my
enjoyable other about how we facilitate
her daughter has created a great
connection between us. Is this a

contribution to the child, me, and the
woman—or will this backfire?
Gary:
No, it’s is a contribution. You have to
get that’s where you’re going here. This
is what can be contributed and what’s
really possible.
Class Participant:
After the last call, I asked my
stepdaughter what would she like me to
be in her life, and she said, “Happy.”
After we talked about it some more, she
said, “A friend.” We talked about that,
too, and her point of view is that a friend
is a playmate. How can I use that?

Gary:
Be a playmate.
Class Participant:
She has also been playing with
changing her name to my name and she
called me Dad once.
Gary:
That would mean she’s trying to make
you into a dad. You have to see whether
you’re willing to be that, because even if
you end up not staying with this woman,
you’ve got to be willing to be the dad for
the kid or the woman will hate you.
Class Participant:
My stepdaughter likes making videos

about entities and things like that with
me, and I asked her mom and her if I can
use them to promote my business. They
are both happy with that. What will this
create?
Gary:
This will create their being involved
in your business, which should create
more profit for you.
Class Participant:
Should this be done as a Deal and
Deliver?
Gary:
Yes. Everything should be done as a
Deal and Deliver.

An Undefined Life
Class Participant:
First, I want to say thank you so much
for these calls. They have been life
changing for me in so many ways. I have
gotten more clarity about how I function
with women, with relationship, and what
I can do different to make things work.
I’m not going to the wrongness of me so
much anymore and I have more peace
within. Right now I feel like there’s
nothing to hold onto in any area of my
life. I’ve been asking for an undefined
life, which to me means being free from
the definitions and limitations other

people impose on me. I don’t have any
idea how to function with this, though,
besides asking questions.
Gary:
If you function from question in your
relationships and with everything you
do, you start moving toward having an
undefined life. If everything is a
question, you open the door for a
relationship that has not yet existed. Ask:
What 
energy, 
space, 
and
consciousness can my body and I be
that would allow us to have a
relationship beyond this reality with
total ease? Everything that doesn’t

allow that to show up times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
You might want to put that on a loop
and run it nonstop for at least thirty days
until you start to get that there’s a
different place from which you can deal
with everything.
Dealing with a Woman’s
Anger
Class Participant:
When my woman delivers anger or
projects it at me, I still go into a beyond

and dismiss me. Sometimes I go into the
wrongness of me. I’ve run clearings with
the 
beyonds 
and 
the 
SHICUUUU
implants, but there’s still resistance to
receiving the energy of her anger.
Gary:
Anger is never anything except a way
to control you. What if you could have a
different choice? Would you be willing
to have that?
Class Participant:
Should I run: What energy, space, and
consciousness can my body and I be that
will allow me to be the pathetic pile of
shit, wrongness, and weakness I truly

be?
Gary:
That’s not a good one. You want to
run:
What 
bastardization 
of 
infinite
capacity am I using to create the
wrongness, the pathetic pile of shit,
and the weak, lily-livered coward I
am trying to be, I am pretending to be
am I choosing? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:

I’ve also tried using energy pulls,
lowering my barriers, doing interesting
point of view, and POC and POD, and
they all work sometimes. But when I go
into a beyond, all of those tools are
gone. Is there any other way to be free
here and let go of that?
Gary:
Sometimes you have to be willing to
get angry. You can do anger without
judgment and without force. Doing anger
without judgment and without force is
the generative element of anger. You
have to be willing to do that. Be willing
to go to anger when you need to. Most of
us think that not being angry is the target.

What if that wasn’t it? What if there was
a different choice we haven’t chosen
yet?
Class Participant:
Can anger without judgment be used
with kids, as well?
Gary:
Yeah. With kids you can say, “Stop.
That’s all there is.”
Class Participant:
Is anger without judgment the same as
killing energy?
Gary:
No, anger without force or judgment is

“You know what? Do that again and you
and I are done.” People tend to have the
point of view that anger is always a
wrongness, but it’s not. It’s just that
you’re a man, so you’re a wrongness in
general.
Everything you’ve done not to
perceive, know, be, and receive the
other options you have, will you
destroy and uncreate all of that? Right
and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and
POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Aggressive Presence in
Relationship

Class Participant:
Can you talk more about aggressive
presence in relationship and what that
could look like?
Gary:
Aggressive 
presence 
is 
the
willingness to be you and to be present
in a relationship regardless of the
outcome. It’s about having no point of
view. Everything is just an interesting
point of view, nothing more. When you
are willing to function without the sense
that you have to do anything other than
just be present, you start to create a
reality in which nothing becomes a

wrongness, and everything becomes a
possibility.
How to Approach a Woman
Class Participant:
Can you talk about how to approach
women?
Gary:
It depends on what you’re looking for.
You’ve got to ask:
• What do I really want to create here?
• What do I want to do?
• How’s this going to work for me?
• What do I want to get from this
woman?

If you really wish to create something
with a woman, you’ve got to ask the
question, “What do I really want to
create here?” A lot of you try to create
something based on a lie.
How many lies are you using to
create the relationships you are
choosing? Everything that is times a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
“The Word Commitment Is
Still Sticking Me”
Class Participant:

The word commitment is still sticking
me. For example, the idea of committing
to relationship makes me feel like I have
to exclude all other women I would like
to have sex with or be close with. Or
committing to a business deal or a job
means I have to exclude all other
business possibilities.
Gary:
How many of you are buying the
crap that you’re only capable of, or
willing to, or would like to have only
one person or one business as the sum
total of your reality? Everything that is
times a godzillion, will you destroy
and uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,

Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
The other person’s expectations make
me want to run in the other direction.
Gary:
What if you were just aware—instead
of an idiot?
Class Participant:
(Laughter)
Gary:
Recognize that you are aware. You are
way more aware than ninety percent of
the guys on the planet. So what does that

mean? 
It 
means 
you 
have 
more
possibilities with more women than
other guys do.
Use your awareness and ask:
• What does this person want to hear?
• What does this person want to
create?
• What is this going to look like?
Start to reach into that universe, and
you’ll be able to talk to anyone without
the sense that you can’t choose to be
with her. You’ll be able to create your
empowerment channel as greater than
what you’ve currently been doing.
Class Participant:

I’m scared that if I commit to someone
or something that I’ll lose me to that
person or thing again.
Gary:
Is that really yours? I hate to tell you,
my friend, but you’re way more aware
than you want to know. Ninety percent of
what you guys think is messing you up is
not even yours. How weird is that?
You Can Be You without a
Woman
Class Participant:
I met a woman who is twelve years
younger than I am. She lives about sixty

kilometers away from me, and her life is
very different from mine. She works in
the arts, and I work in business.
Gary:
Why do you think she’s interested in
you? Her basic point of view is that you
must be successful. She wants to learn
how to be successful.
Class Participant:
Everything was really easy with us
and neither one of us was looking for a
serious relationship, so we were just
going along. I really liked her, and she
developed feelings that she didn’t want,
and pushed them away. It’s as if she has

the point of view that she doesn’t want
to be in a relationship, so nothing else
can happen. Even if she moves on with
her life in whatever way she chooses, I
would like to have some more clarity
about what’s going on.
Gary:
What bastardization of the infinite
freedom from women are you using to
create the unconscious relationships
with women you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.

Class Participant:
Whoa! That’s the energy I’ve been
feeling.
Gary:
What bastardization of the infinite
freedom from women are you using to
create the unconscious relationships
with women you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
You guys have the weird point of view
that you can’t be you without a woman.

That’s fucking strange, because you can
be you without a woman. In fact it’s a lot
easier, but for some reason, you have
decided that without a woman, you can’t
be you.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a
godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What bastardization of the infinite
freedom from women are you using to
create the unconscious relationships
with women you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?

Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
Run it again, please.
Gary:
What bastardization of the infinite
freedom from women are you using to
create the unconscious relationships
with women you are choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.

And all of the futures unactualized and
unrealized that you have about your
future as always with a woman and the
only way you’re going to have a future is
with a woman, can we have those
destroyed, 
please: 
One… 
two…
three…. four. Thank you.
You’re Always Going to Go
to Relationship Because
That’s What the Woman
Wants
Class Participant:
I don’t really desire relationship; still,
I met an awesome woman who I really

enjoy spending time with, and even
though everything is easy, it ends up
creating a relationship.
Gary:
You’re a man. You’re an idiot. I love
you, but are you kidding me? You’re
always going to go to relationship
because that’s what the woman wants.
You will give yourself up for the woman
every time, guys. It’s just damn stupid.
You have a penis. Your IQ is only as
large as your penis.
Class Participant:
Can’t things just be enjoyable without
all of this other stuff?

Gary:
No, I’m sorry. You are cute as hell, but
you’re dumber than dirt. There’s no such
thing as a friendship with benefits. Every
woman always assumes that if you’re
friendly and you’re easy, and on top of
that, you’re cute, it means that eventually
you’re going to get into a relationship,
and the only reason you want to hang out
with her is because you really want
relationship. Sorry guys. You have one
brain that works, and it’s the one that
hangs between your legs. The rest of
your brain power is useless.
Class Participant:

Is there any way around this shit?
Gary:
Is there any way around it? Yeah. Get
smart. Look at it. After doing the sex and
relationship class, I got a text message
from a lady that said, “What do I have to
do to have you? Can I send you a picture
of my clit? Do I have to do aggressive
withdrawal? What do I have to do to get
you?” Did she ask me my point of view?
No. Did she ask me if I was interested?
No! Why? Because she’s a woman and
her basic point of view is “If you’re a
man, you have no point of view other
than the one I want you to have.” You
have to get this, guys, because if you

don’t, you’ll spend your entire life trying
to make the woman right and trying to
figure out how you can make it work for
her. Not for you, for her.
The Woman Is Not the
Source of Your Sexual
Reality
Class Participant:
I have stopped making the woman the
source of my sexual reality. This has
given me great freedom.
Gary:
Yeah. The woman is not the source of
your sexual reality. How many of you

have made women the source of your
sexual reality? You make sex the source
of how you live. You decide you can’t
live without sex. The truth is you can
live without sex—but it’s way more fun
to have it. But you guys don’t do sex for
the fun of it. You do it to make sure you
can continue to live.
You think sex is serious. I have a
different point of view. I have the point
of view that sex is something you get to
do for the fun of it. Why not do it just
because it’s fun?
What stupidity are you using to
create the serious sex you are
choosing? Everything that is times a

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
When you get to the point where sex
doesn’t matter, where it’s okay for you
one way or the other, you’re creating a
place where you can actually have
choice, and the sex you do have will be
much greater.
Women make all kinds of weird,
forceful invitations to me, and I have no
desire to have sex with them. I like
somebody who’s fun, not somebody
who’s forceful. There has to be a sense
of fun in it for me personally. When you

get to the point where you have no need
of it, you begin to choose who to have
sex with—and when. It’s an easier place
to function from, and when you get there,
you’ll end up with better sex. I can
guarantee you that.
How Many Jobs Have You
Been Given?
Class Participant:
I see that I’ve been trying to be a
peacemaker in sex and relationship. I’ve
been 
running 
the 
clearing 
“What
stupidity am I using to create the
peacemaker I’m choosing,” and it seems
like things are shifting.

Gary:
Did you take on the job of being a
peacemaker—or were you given the
job? Were you given that job in utero?
Class Participant:
Given feels lighter.
Gary:
So you were given the job of being the
peacemaker in your family. Does that
give you choice or does that make them
the choosers for you?
Class Participant:
It makes them the choosers.
Gary:

If they’re the choosers, what choices
do you have? Do you have a lot of
choices or do you have a little choice?
Class Participant:
Little choice.
Gary:
The reality is that what you really
want to create is a greater possibility,
not a lesser possibility. What would it
be like if you could have the greatest
possibility you’ve ever had? What
would that be like?
Notice you have no answer, because
no answer is the place you were never
given a choice. You were given a job

and that was the job you were supposed
to have. No other job works.
Everything you aligned and agreed
with or resisted and reacted to that
allowed that job to be given to you,
will you destroy and uncreate all of
that? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
How many jobs have you been
given this lifetime by women who
require you to not choose for you, to
not be you, and to do what they want
you to do? All of those, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and

POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
All of the futures that have been
created based on those jobs, can we
destroy and uncreate all of those, please:
One… two… three… four. One more
time: One… two… three… four. One
more time: One… two… three… four.
Okay, do you feel more free to choose?
Class Participants:
Yeah.
Gary:
You keep thinking that because the
woman has given you the job, whether
your job is to take out the trash or to be

the trash, that you’ve been given the job.
A lot of you were given the job of being
the man of the family, especially if you
had divorced mothers. You were given
the job of being the man of the family,
but you were never told what that meant
and you definitely didn’t get any of the
benefits of it. Usually they told you that
your father was so terrible, awful, and
vicious that you decided you didn’t want
to turn out like that, so you didn’t get to
be you at all. The way you know what
you are as a man is by the father you had,
even if you only had him for the thirty
seconds it took for him to cum.
Everything 
that 
is 
times 
a

godzillion, will you destroy and
uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
The Job of Judging Yourself
If you had a mother who judged your
father in any way, shape, or form, the
only choice you had was the job of
judging yourself.
How many of you have been given
the job of judging you nonstop right
the fuck out of existence? Everything
that is times a godzillion, will you
destroy and uncreate it all? Right and
Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and

POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
Class Participant:
How does that work? If your mother’s
judging your father then you’re….
Gary:
You are the offspring. In the Bible, it
says, “The sins of the father shall be
visited upon the child.” That’s it. That’s
the entrainment to assuming that you’re
as bad as your father. And if you spend
your life not wanting to be like your
father, the end result is you’ve already
become that in order to not be it, which
means you’re stuck. In actual fact, you’re

better than your father. Have any of you
ever 
noticed? 
Were 
you 
ever
acknowledged for being way better than
your father?
Class Participant:
No. My mom used to tell me, “You
look like your father,” and people would
say, “You look like your father” and one
day I realized, “Wow, my body’s turning
into my father’s.”
Gary:
Yeah. All of those points of view
were delivered at you. How many of you
have the point of view that you look like
your father, or you look like your mother,

or you look like your uncle or your
grandpa? The truth is none of you look
like anybody except you.
Everything you’ve done to make you
agreeable to looking like somebody
else’s body, will you destroy and
uncreate all of that? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What’s the Subtext Here
That I’m Not
Acknowledging?
Class Participant:
When I ask my woman what she

would like, what something would look
like, or what I could do for her, I rarely
get any information. She doesn’t want to
answer, so we can never get to Deal and
Deliver. I heard you say that women
never tell what’s true for them so they
can control the man. What questions can
I ask or what energies can I be here?
Can you talk more about that? Am I
looking 
for 
the 
answer, 
not 
the
awareness?
Gary:
Yes, you’re looking for the answer, not
the awareness. What would you like to
create? What would you like to create
with a woman?

Everything that does not allow you
to perceive, know, be, and receive
that, will you destroy and uncreate it
all? Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts,
Boys, and Beyonds.
Class Participant:
I have a problem with this, too. Can
we talk a bit more about it? Whenever
I’ve tried to do a Deal and Deliver, the
woman keeps asking me the question I
asked her, so we go around and around.
Gary:
Why does somebody ask you a
question that you’ve just asked them?

Because a) They don’t want to answer it,
and b) They want to find out what your
answer is before they answer.
If you ask a woman, “Do you like this
color?” she will reply, “What color do
you like?” Her point of view is “If you
don’t like the color I like, I’m not going
to like you. If I don’t like the color you
like, we’re not going to get along.” This
is the subtext of every conversation. You
have to ask the question: What’s the
subtext here that I’m not acknowledging?
Class Participant:
I’ve run into a couple of women. We
like the same things, we like to do the

same stuff, and we have a lot of things in
common with each other….
Gary:
Every woman is going to tell you that
you have things in common, whether it’s
true or not. In common means “We’re
destined to be together.” That’s the
subtext of that comment. When a woman
says, “We have a lot in common,” it
means “We’re getting married.”
Class Participant:
That’s what I was leading up to. When
a woman says, “We’ve got a lot of stuff
in common,” I say, “Yeah, and what does
that have to do with anything?”

Gary:
Every woman is going to look for
what you have in common so she can
decide you’re the man she wants. It has
nothing to do with your point of view.
They don’t care about your point of
view.
Class Participant:
True, true, true.
Gary:
When are you going to get that there is
a subtext to every female conversation?
“You’re so interesting” means “Oh, I can
have sex with you.” “Wow, this was
really fun” means “What are you going

to do next?” and “When do I schedule
the church?”
Class Participant:
I get it.
Gary:
You guys have the point of view that
women hear what you say. No, no. They
don’t hear what you say. They’ve
already concocted what’s going to
happen.
How much of your ability to
comprehend is overridden by a
woman’s concoction of what she
wants to hear? Everything that is times
a godzillion, will you destroy and

uncreate it all? Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD and POC, All
Nine, Shorts, Boys, and Beyonds.
What Part of “Women Have
Subtext” Are You Not
Getting?
Women communicate in a circuitous
way, thinking they’re going to get what
they want by changing the way they ask
for it, so you eventually get out of the
way and do what they say. Women
always expect men to do what they want.
Why do you not get that? What part of
“Women have subtext” are you not
getting?

A woman’s point of view is that if you
say what she says, you’re telling the
truth. If you tell her what she wants to
hear, you’re telling the truth. Everything
else is a lie.
You’ve got to get this, guys. Women
function from subtext. Ask: What’s the
subtext I’m not listening to here? Subtext
is the way they function. There’s “This is
what she says” and there’s “This is what
she’s thinking.” What she’s thinking is
what you’re supposed to do. She’s
saying, “Oh, it’s not a problem. Do
whatever you want.” That means “You
do that and I’ll kill you.”
Someone said we should have a

subtext app to decode what women say.
Wouldn’t that be great? She says, “x, y,
z” and it comes up “That means blah,
blah, blah.” In a class we did this week,
I told the women what subtext was and
they all said, “Yes, but…”
I would say, “The subtext of that is
‘blah, blah, blah.’”
They’d say, “What do you mean? I
wasn’t doing subtext!”
I’d say, “Yeah you were! You just did
it! It’s not wrong; it’s just what you do. If
you want to be honest about what you’re
saying, you have to see when you’re
doing it. It’s just one of the ways in
which women are different from men.”

There is a great YouTube video called
“It’s Not about the Nail.”
A lady says to a man, “I need you to
listen. I have this pain in my head.”
The man says, “Well, what about the
nail that’s in your head?”
The woman says, “No, that’s not the
problem! I want you to listen. Why do
you never listen? Stop trying to fix me!”
You know, the thing is, guys. You’re
men.
Class Participant:
Do you have any clearings for more
ease in decoding subtext?
Gary:

Women always have ulterior motives.
They always have a subtext. Nothing is
ever straight. It’s never direct.
What stupidity are you using to
create never perceiving and receiving
the 
subtext 
are 
you 
choosing?
Everything that is times a godzillion,
will you destroy and uncreate it all?
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD
and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys, and
Beyonds.
“We Have a Relationship
Now”
Class Participant:
Is there anything I haven’t looked at

with my relationship that if I’d look at it,
could create more space and possibility?
Gary:
You’re always doing that anyway, so I
don’t think you have to worry about it.
Both you and your partner are trying to
create your relationship. You’re not
trying to live in it. And that’s essential.
The biggest mistake people make is
when they say, “We have a relationship
now.” That’s the end? No, it’s not the
end. It’s just the beginning of what else
is possible. You’re in a constant state of
creation of your relationship when you
function from:

• What else is possible?
• What other choices do we have?
• What else can we create?
• How would we like this to be?
• Can we destroy and uncreate
everything it was yesterday?
Asking these questions keeps you in
the present moment and opens the door
to levels of possibility nobody else
could ever have.
Thank you so much. You guys have
been an amazing gift. This series has
been a huge contribution to a greater
possibility. You guys are about the
bravest guys I’ve ever met, because

you’re willing to talk about being
something different from what other
people are willing to be.
Class Participant:
Awesome. I want to say thank you for
a great series.
Class Participant:
Thank you so much, Gary.
Gary:
Thank you all for being on this call.
I’m so grateful that you guys are in the
world. You guys take care—and go out
and get laid! But remember, you only
want to get laid once. If you go to two,
you’re going to be in relationship, and if

you go to three, you’re getting married.
And if the girl says, “We have so much
in common,” her point of view is you’re
going to get married soon. So you’d
better be ready for the aftermath if you
don’t show up the way you’re supposed
to.
Love you guys. Take care!

The Access
Consciousness
Clearing Statement®
You are the only one who can unlock
the points of view that have you
trapped.
What I am offering here with the
clearing process is a tool you can use
to change the energy of the points of
view that have you locked
into unchanging situations.

Throughout this book, I ask a lot of
questions, and some of those questions
might twist your head around a little bit.
That’s my intention. The questions I ask
are designed to get your mind out of the
picture so you can get to the energy of a
situation.
Once the question has twisted your
head around and brought up the energy of
a situation, I ask if you are willing to
destroy 
and 
uncreate 
that 
energy,
because stuck energy is the source of
barriers and limitations. Destroying and
uncreating that energy will open the door
to new possibilities for you. This is your

opportunity to say, “Yes, I’m willing to
let go of whatever is holding that
limitation in place.”
That will be followed by some weird-
speak we call the clearing statement:
Right and Wrong, Good and Bad,
POD and POC, All 9, Shorts, Boys,
and Beyonds®
With the clearing statement, we’re
going back to the energy of the
limitations and barriers that have been
created. We’re looking at the energies
that keep us from moving forward and
expanding into all of the spaces we
would like to go. The clearing statement
is simply short-speak that addresses the

energies that are creating the limitations
and contractions in our life.
The more you run the clearing
statement, the deeper it goes and the
more layers and levels it can unlock for
you. If a lot of energy comes up for you
in response to a question, you may wish
to repeat the process numerous times
until the subject being addressed is no
longer an issue for you.
You don’t have to understand the
words of the clearing statement for it to
work because it’s about the energy.
However, 
if 
you’re 
interested 
in
knowing what the words mean, there are
some brief definitions given below.

Right and Wrong, Good and Bad is
shorthand for: What’s right, good,
perfect, and correct about this? What’s
wrong, mean, vicious, terrible, bad, and
awful about this? The short version of
these questions is: What’s right and
wrong, good and bad? It is the things that
we consider right, good, perfect, and/or
correct that stick us the most. We do not
wish to let go of them since we decided
that we have them right.
POD 
stands 
for 
the 
point 
of
destruction, all the ways you have been
destroying yourself in order to keep
whatever you’re clearing in existence.
POC stands for the point of creation of

the thoughts, feelings, and emotions
immediately preceding your decision to
lock the energy in place.
Sometimes people say, “POD and
POC it,” which is simply shorthand for
the longer statement. When you “POD
and POC” something, it is like pulling
the bottom card out of a house of cards.
The whole thing falls down.
All 9 stands for the nine different
ways you have created this item as a
limitation in your life. They are the
layers of thoughts, feelings, emotions,
and points of view that create the
limitation as solid and real.
Shorts is the short version of a much

longer series of questions that include:
What’s meaningful about this? What’s
meaningless about this? What’s the
punishment for this? What’s the reward
for this?
Boys stands for energetic structures
called nucleated spheres. Basically
these have to do with those areas of our
life where we’ve tried to handle
something continuously with no effect.
There are at least thirteen different kinds
of these spheres, which are collectively
called “the boys.” A nucleated sphere
looks like the bubbles created when you
blow in one of those kids’ bubble pipes
that has multiple chambers. It creates a

huge mass of bubbles, and when you pop
one bubble, the other bubbles fill in the
space.
Have you ever tried to peel the layers
of an onion when you were trying to get
to the core of an issue, but you could
never get there? That’s because it wasn’t
an onion; it was a nucleated sphere.
Beyonds are feelings or sensations
you get that stop your heart, stop your
breath, or stop your willingness to look
at possibilities. Beyonds are what occur
when you are in shock. We have lots of
areas in our life where we freeze up.
Anytime you freeze up, that’s a beyond
holding you captive. That’s the difficulty

with a beyond: it stops you from being
present. The beyonds include everything
that 
is 
beyond 
belief, 
reality,
imagination, 
conception, 
perception,
rationalization, forgiveness, as well as
all the other beyonds. They are usually
feelings and sensations, rarely emotions,
and never thoughts.

Glossary
Allowance
You can align and agree with a point
of view, or you can resist and react to a
point of view. That’s the polarity of this
reality. Or you can be in allowance. If
you are in allowance, you are the rock in
the middle of the stream. Thoughts,
beliefs, attitudes, and considerations
come at you and they go around you,
because 
to 
you, 
they’re 
just 
an

interesting point of view. If, on the other
hand, you go into alignment and
agreement or resistance and reaction to
that point of view, you get caught up in
the stream of insanity and you go along
for a ride. That’s not the stream you want
to be in. You want to be in allowance.
Total allowance is: Everything is just an
interesting point of view.
Bars
The Bars® are a hands-on Access
process that involves a light touch upon
the 
head 
to 
contact 
points 
that
correspond to different aspects of one’s
life. There are points for joy, sadness,
body and sexuality, awareness, kindness,

gratitude, peace and calm. There is even
a money bar. These points are called
bars because they run from one side of
the head to the other.
Be
In this book, the word be is sometimes
used rather than are to refer to you, the
infinite being you truly be, as opposed to
a contrived point of view about who you
think you are.
Being and Beingness
Being is you, the infinite being you
are.
Beingness is something you do to
prove that you’re being.

Energetic Synthesis of Being (ESB)
ESB is a class that Dr. Dain Heer
teaches. It’s about how you, as a being,
bring 
things 
together 
to 
change
everything around you.
Energetic Synthesis of Communion
(ESC)
This is a process that Dain does.
Basically, the energetic synthesis of
communion puts you in connection with
all the molecular structures of the
universe in a different way. You can find
out more about this on Dain’s website
(www.drdainheer.com). He offers free
“tasters” so you can get a sense of what

it’s like.
Head Tripping, Heart Tripping, Crotch
Tripping
When you are head tripping, you think
about it (whatever it is) all the time.
“What’s next? What are we going to do
next? What’s the next step?” A head
tripper is always going into “next, next,
next.”
A heart tripper is always going into
“Why didn’t you call me? Don’t you
love me anymore? What’s the matter
with you? What’s the matter with me?”
Crotch trippers are always trying to
prove how sexual they are rather than

actually being sexual. It’s a proof of
sexualness—not being sexual. Women
who dress provocatively but who don’t
have an ounce of sexual energy are
crotch trippers. They look like they
ought to be sexual—but they’re in the
image, not the reality.
Holding Patterns
These are patterns we hold in our
bodies. They can be unlocked by a
hands-on 
Access 
Consciousness
process.
Humans and Humanoids
There are two different species of
two-legged beings on this planet. We

call them humans and humanoids. They
look alike, they walk alike, they talk
alike, and they often eat alike, but the
reality is they’re different.
Humans will always tell you how
you’re wrong, how they’re right, and
how you shouldn’t change anything. They
say things like, “We don’t do things that
way, so don’t even bother.” They are the
ones who ask, “Why are you changing
that? It’s fine the way it is.”
Humanoids take a different approach.
They are always looking at things and
asking, “How can we change that? What
will make this better? How can we
outdo this?” They’re the people who

have created all the great art, all the
great literature, and all the great
progress on the planet.
Implants
Implants are things that have been
done to us in one lifetime or another that
have an action on the body and the mind.
An implant creates a particular kind of
vibration 
within 
us; 
it 
becomes
something that impacts us and holds us.
We’ve found that it’s possible to remove
or undo these implants using a process
from Access Consciousness.
Interesting Point of View
Interesting point of view is an Access

Consciousness tool. It is a great way to
neutralize 
judgment 
by 
reminding
yourself that whatever the judgment is,
it’s just a point of view that you or
someone else has at this moment in time.
It’s not right or wrong or good or bad.
Any time a judgment comes up, just
say, “Interesting point of view.” It helps
to distance you from the judgment. You
don’t align and agree with it—and you
don’t resist and react to it. You just
allow it to be what it is, which is no
more than an interesting point of view.
When you can do this, you are in
allowance.
Is This Mine?

“Is this mine?” is a question you ask to
find out if the thoughts, feelings, and
emotions you’re having actually belong
to you—because 98% of thoughts,
feelings, and emotions we have do not
belong to us. We continuously pick up
everybody else’s stuff and assume it’s
ours, especially if it’s bad. And we
assume the good stuff belongs to some-
one else.
Killing Energy
Killing energy is the energy it would
take for you to kill something if you
were willing to do it without any
judgment. It takes energy to kill a cow or
a deer or anything you’re going to eat.

That energy, delivered at somebody the
way you would deliver it if you were
actually slaughtering an animal, is the
energy that will change things for
people.
Lighter/Heavier
That which is light is always true, and
you sense the lightness of it. That which
is a lie is always heavy, and you sense
that heaviness.
The Place
A novel by Gary Douglas about what
you’ve always been looking for and how
and where it might be possible.
POD and POCing

POD and POCing is a short way of
saying that you are going back in time to
the point where you destroyed yourself
with something or to the point of
creation of something that locks you up.
Pulling Energy, Energy Pulls
Most men push energy at the women
they are attracted to. Women get lots of
that and their response is pretty much,
“No thank you!” Instead of pushing
energy at someone you’re attracted to,
try pulling energy from him or her.
That’s the way to attract them. They’ll
suddenly feel drawn to you. Energy
flows 
are 
the 
way 
you 
create
connections with people. You just ask

the energy to pull. It’s that easy.
Put (Something) on a Loop
This is something you can do on your
computer, which allows you to listen to
something over and over again.
Receiving
In this reality, people believe the only
ways to receive are through sex,
copulation, or money.
True receiving is being able to receive
all the information there is. It has to do
with the awareness of everything that’s
possible. It’s the capacity to perceive all
awareness without a point of view.
Sex and No Sex

In Access Consciousness, when we
say sex and no sex, we’re not referring
to copulation. We’re talking about
receiving. We chose these words as they
bring up the energy of receiving and not
receiving better than anything else we’ve
found.
People use their points of view about
sex and no sex as a way of limiting their
receiving. 
Sex 
and 
no 
sex 
are
exclusionary 
universes—either/or
universes—where you either make your
presence known (sex) to the exclusion of
everyone else, or you hide your presence
(no sex) so that you cannot be seen. In
either case, given the focus on yourself,

you don’t allow yourself to receive from
anyone or anything.
SHICUUUU Implants
These are implants that are secret,
hidden, invisible, covert, unseen, unsaid,
unacknowledged, and undisclosed.
Signs, 
Seals, 
Emblems, 
and
Significances
These are the badges you wear all the
time that have nothing to do with who
you are.
What stupidity are you choosing?
Infinite beings, in order to be
unaware, have to create themselves as
stupid. Questions that contain the phrase

“What stupidity are you choosing….?”
are not meant to suggest that you are
stupid. Rather, they seek to bring up the
energy of times you have chosen a lack
of knowing—a stupidity—in order to
create yourself as unaware.

What Is Access
Consciousness®?
What if you were willing to nurture
and care for you?
What if you would open the doors to
being everything
you have decided it is not possible to
be?
What would it take for you to realize
how crucial you are to the possibilities
of the world?

Access Consciousness is a simple set
of tools, techniques, and philosophies
that allow you to create dynamic change
in every area of your life. Access
provides step-by-step building blocks
that allow you to become totally aware
and begin functioning as the conscious
being you truly are. These tools can be
used to change whatever isn’t working in
your life so that you can have a different
life and a different reality.
You can access these tools via a
variety of classes, books, telecalls, and
other products, or with an Access
Consciousness Certified Facilitator or
an 
Access 
Consciousness 
Bars

Facilitator.
The goal of Access is to create a
world of consciousness and oneness.
Consciousness is the ability to be
present in your life in every moment
without judgment of yourself or anyone
else. Consciousness includes everything
and judges nothing. It’s the ability to
receive everything, reject nothing, and
create everything you desire in life,
greater than you currently have and more
than you can ever imagine.

Beyond the Utopian Ideal
By Gary M. Douglas
Most people operate from a fixed idea
or concept of how things are supposed to
be, rather than functioning in the moment,
where they can change anything as
needed to accomplish and create more.
These things are not actually real; they
are conceptual realities that have been

dropped into our existence. This book is
about becoming aware of the ideal
concepts and constructs that create
limitations and barriers to what is
possible for you. The constructs have to
come off so you can create a world that
works for you.
Leading from the Edge of
Possibility: No More Business
as Usual
By Chutisa and Steven Bowman
Just imagine what your business and
your life would be like if you stopped
functioning on autopilot and began to

generate your business with strategic
awareness 
and 
prosperity
consciousness. This is truly possible,
except you have to be willing to change.
Recognizing 
a 
different 
possibility
requires a different mindset and almost
always demands a kind of awareness
that is not part of prior experience. With
this book you’ll get the awareness you
need to lead your business in any
environment!
Divorceless Relationships
By Gary M. Douglas
A Divorceless Relationship is one

where you don’t have to divorce any
part of you in order to be in a
relationship with someone else. It is a
place where everyone and everything
you are in a relationship with can
become greater as a result of the
relationship.
Sex Is Not a Four Letter Word
but Relationship Often Times
Is
By Gary M Douglas & Dr. Dain Heer

delightfully
irreverent, this book offers readers an
entirely fresh view of how to create

great intimacy and exceptional sex. What
if you could stop guessing—and find out
what REALLY works?

About the Author
Gary Douglas
Best-selling 
author, 
international
speaker and a sought-after facilitator,
Gary Douglas is known for his intensity
of awareness and his incredible capacity
to facilitate people to know what they

know. 
He 
chooses 
to 
embody
consciousness in everything that he does,
which inspires others to choose to
become more conscious as a result.
Gary came with an exceptional level
of awareness into the Midwest middle
class “white bread” family and lived the
Leave It to Beaver childhood. He has a
very different view on life and realized
that he was very different from most of
the people he knew when he was only
six years old. He became aware of this
difference by watching people create
their lives and seeing that none of it was
about the joy and the possibilities—it
was always about the wrongness of

everything. Gary knew there had to be
more than this reality was offering, since
there was nothing about it that was
magical, joyful or expansive. So, he
began seeking deeper awareness to life’s
mysteries at an early age. Along the way,
he uncovered a new way forward—one
that would create change in the world
and in people’s lives. He discovered
that magic is all around us; it’s
something 
we 
create—it’s
consciousness. He recognized that the
capacity to be more aware and more
conscious was every person’s gift if they
were willing to choose it.
Over time what he recognised as the

gift he was, was his intensity of
awareness and his capacity to invite
people 
to 
consciousness 
and 
to
recognise that everything is possible and
nothing is impossible. His gift is his
ability to look at life, the universe and
the consciousness that we all are, as
well as the possibilities that are an
intrinsic part of it from a space that no
one else has ever chosen.
Empowering People to See Different
Possibilities
Gary has become an internationally
recognized 
thought 
leader 
in
transforming lives and creating different

choices—willing to empower people to
see 
different 
possibilities 
and 
to
recognize what is truly possible for
them. Gary is acknowledged worldwide
for his unique perspectives on personal
transformation that is unlike anything
else in the world. He is not aligned with
any particular religion or tradition.
Through his writing and workshops, he
gifts processes and tools that bring
within reach the ease, joy, and glory of
life, and the magic of happiness that
expands into more awareness, joy, and
abundance. His simple, yet profound,
teachings 
have 
already 
facilitated
countless people throughout the world to

know what they know and to realize
what they can choose that they never
realised they could choose.
At the Core of His Teachings Lies the
Transformation of Consciousness
After 
recognising 
that 
greater
consciousness in people can change the
direction of their lives and the future of
the planet, the creation and expansion of
Access Consciousness by Gary has been
primarily driven by a single question,
“What can I do to help the world?”
He continues to inspire others, inviting
the awareness of a different possibility

across the world and making an immense
contribution to the planet. He facilitates
people to know that they are the source
for creating the change they desire and
creating a life that goes beyond the
limitations of what the rest of the world
thinks is important. He sees this as an
essential aspect to creating a future that
has greater possibilities in it for
everyone, as well as the planet. This is a
priority not only for personal happiness
but also for the ending of violent conflict
endemic on our planet and creating a
different world. If enough people choose
to be more aware and more conscious,
they will start to see the possibilities of

what they have available to them and
change what is occurring here on planet
earth.
