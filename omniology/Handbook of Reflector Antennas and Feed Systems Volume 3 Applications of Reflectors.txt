Preface
Several books on reflector antennas have been written and the majority of them 
have given excellent treatment to the theory and analysis of reflector antennas. The 
intent of this book is to provide practical applications and design information of 
reflector antennas used for several communications systems. I have been encour­
aged by my industry colleagues to write such a book documenting the application 
aspects of reflector antennas for spacecraft and terrestrial communications. With 
this in mind, I have invited mostly practicing engineers from the antenna industry 
to write these book chapters. Experts from Northrop Grumman, MELCO, NASA/
JPL, Intelsat, Boeing, CMI, AASC, and DUT have largely contributed to this book. 
Reflector antenna technology has been evolving continuously over the last two 
decades to cater to new applications. These include large deployable reflectors for 
mobile satellites, multiple beam reflector antennas for high-capacity satellites, mul­
tiband reflector antennas covering multiple frequency bands, terahertz reflectors for 
radar applications, high-power antenna payloads with low passive intermodulation 
products, low loss reflector antennas for wide scan applications, reflector antennas 
for new terrestrial applications, and reflector antennas for remote sensing. This 
book covers recent developments of reflector antennas used for satellite communi­
cations, terrestrial communications, and remote sensing applications. New subjects 
are introduced for the first time here in a book format dealing with satellite anten­
nas, terahertz antennas, PIM, multipaction, corona, deployable mesh reflector an­
tennas, and mechanical aspects of reflector antennas. A separate topic on integrated 
feed assembly for reflector antennas covering analysis, design, fabrication, and test 
has been included in this book.
The organization of this book is as follows. A brief introduction beginning with 
the history of reflector antennas and its basics is given in Chapter 1. Different types 
of reflector antennas used for satellite communications, including introduction to 
payload systems and antenna farm, are addressed in Chapter 2. Contoured beam 
or shaped beam antennas are described along with analysis results for C-band and 
Ku-band antennas for fixed satellite services. Gain performance as a function of re­
flector size is discussed. Dual-reflector Gregorian antenna configuration for shaped 
beam applications is described. Gridded-reflector antennas with overlapping aper­
tures providing polarization reuse for linear polarization applications are discussed 
along with design formulae for the grid geometry. The subject of multiple beam 
antennas is relatively new and is covered in detail in Chapter 2. Design of MBAs, 
analysis of MBA performance, and several applications of MBAs are discussed.

Preface
Advanced feed technologies as well as reflector technologies that improve MBA 
performance are given with examples. Multiple beam antennas for direct-to-home 
local channel broadcast and personal communications satellites are addressed.
Chapter 3 provides past and recent developments on reflector antennas for ter­
restrial communications applications. There are seven sections that cover reflector 
antennas for different applications. Beam-waveguide fed reflector systems for large 
earth-station reflector antennas are presented. The shaped Cassegrain antenna fed 
by a four-reflector beam waveguide feed is described and is a standard for large 
earth stations all over the world. A trireflector offset antenna for terrestrial mi­
crowave relay link systems with very low cross-polar levels is addressed. Reflector 
antennas used for Japanese communication satellite 2 (CS-2) and an elliptical aper­
ture reflector for satellite news-gathering applications with reduced interference to 
adjacent satellites are discussed. This latter antenna is an offset Gregorian antenna 
with elliptical main reflector. Compact dual-reflector elliptical aperture antennas 
for aeronautical satellite communication systems are presented, including shaping 
methods. The dual-shaped reflector antenna is realized by using a physical optics 
shaping technique and achieves excellent electric performance. Reflector antennas 
used as vessels for mobile communications and terminals for simultaneous com­
munication with broadcast and communication satellites are also discussed.
Use of focusing and nonfocusing reflector systems for terahertz imaging ap­
plications is described in Chapter 4. These systems need to steer the beam over 
the intended field of view with specific spatial resolution. Focal plane arrays that 
would acquire information from several image pixels simultaneously and reflector 
antenna systems integrated with mechanical scanners in order to generate the im­
age at terahertz frequencies are addressed here. Relevant analyses for focal-plane 
and image plane designs are given.  Recent developments in the area of multiband 
reflector antennas and associated feed horns are described in Chapter 5. These 
antennas are capable of supporting multiple frequency bands that are separated 
in frequency and covering several octave bandwidths. They have the advantage of 
using a single antenna instead of several antennas with reduced cost and reduced 
mass. Advanced reflector technologies—such as stepped-reflector, reflectors with 
partially reflective surfaces, and shaped reflectors—are presented. Feed advance­
ments in terms of multimode horns with several “slope-discontinuities” and feed 
assembly developments to isolate the frequency bands are discussed. 
Chapter 6 presents reflector antennas used for remote sensing of the Earth 
and other bodies in the solar system, and relevant sensor technologies to detect 
and classify objects by means of propagated electromagnetic radiation. Sensors de­
ployed on aircraft or satellites make it possible to collect data on a global scale that 
would not otherwise be practical to obtain. Remote sensing is used for a wide range 
of science applications, ranging from global measurement of ocean topography and 
deforestation to the study of Jupiter’s atmosphere. The military employs remote 
sensing techniques to collect data about opposing forces, weather conditions, and 
other information relevant to their mission. Chapter 6 also presents technologies 
related to active and passive remote sensing. For spaceborne remote sensing ap­
plications, reflector antennas have historically been the most widely used antenna 
design. This chapter presents an overview of the various types of reflector antenna 
designs used for remote sensing applications. Antennas flown on historically signif­
icant missions are used to illustrate the practical implementation of each antenna

type. In addition, the chapter presents notable antenna research developments that 
are regarded as enabling technologies for new types of sensors.
Chapter 7 presents two key sections related to the feed assemblies used for 
reflector antennas in space and, to a certain extent, in ground applications. It 
provides the component designs, manufacture, and test results of various types 
of feed assemblies employed at C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band. The feed compo­
nents include horns, orthomode transducers (OMTs), polarizers, filters, diplexers, 
combiners/dividers, and transitions. Manufacturing approaches that yield precise 
tolerances required for high-performance feeds are discussed. Advantages of ad­
vanced design, analyses, manufacture, and test of integrated feed assembly instead 
of conventional piece-part design are discussed. The second part of this chapter 
deals with three important aspects of spacecraft antennas and feeds; namely, pas­
sive intermodulation (PIM), multipaction, and corona. These aspects are critical in 
high-power payloads and multichannel repeaters and significantly impact the feed 
and reflector design.
Space reflectors having sizes larger than the fairing of the booster need to be 
“folded up” in some manner for launch, and then “unfurled” on orbit to their full 
size. These are typically referred to as deployable reflectors, and are the subject 
of Chapter 8. This chapter is organized into three main sections. The first sec­
tion deals with reflector classifications either according to the surface geometry 
or according to the surface type (such as rigid/segmented, semirigid, inflatable/
rigidizable, woven-mesh, and knitted-mesh surfaces). The second section deals in 
more detail with the major constituents/components of the knitted-mesh type re­
flector, which of all deployable reflectors, is most commonly flown in space. The 
last section addresses the major design requirements/considerations for a typical 
deployable reflector subsystem, including electrical, mechanical, thermal, and en­
vironmental drivers. 
Chapter 9 is intended to provide the reader with a framework and top-level 
understanding of the elements and requirements that must be considered in the suc­
cessful design, fabrication, and test of a spaceflight antenna reflector.  It is a guide 
based on over 30 years of professional experience of the authors in engineering, 
fabricating, and testing spaceflight antenna reflectors and systems.  As the state-of-
the-art in antenna reflector design continually advances, this chapter is purposely 
written to provide general recommendations for configuration, design approach 
materials, and testing. There is a wealth of information available from compos­
ite materials suppliers, technical papers, and organizations, such as SAMPE, so 
it is left to the reader to perform the detailed analyses, engineering, and materials 
research to establish the best possible specific choices relative to the set of require­
ments for the particular reflector being considered. A successful antenna reflector 
design is always a carefully balanced combination of many specific and interdepen­
dent choices that must all work together to achieve the best possible results. The 
mechanical design of the reflector antennas have to satisfy electrical, spacecraft, 
launch load, vibration, extreme thermal, deployment in space, stowage, low mass, 
pointing, and structural requirements simultaneously. These are all discussed in 
Chapter 9.
A professional antenna engineer in the current industrial environment must 
be skillful in several areas, including theory, analysis methods, design, mechani­
cal consideration, manufacture, test methods, antenna ranges, error analysis, and

related system aspects. More important, he or she should know what types of 
antennas need to be used for a given application. I have been fortunate to work 
with excellent mentors Chuck Mok and James Huang at Spar Aerospace Limited, 
Montreal, Canada (now called MDA). During the 14 years of my early career, I had 
the opportunity to acquire knowledge about antenna components, reflector anten­
nas for space and ground applications, test range developments, and spacecraft 
antenna testing. I also had the benefit of leading a group of excellent engineers on 
IRAD, new business proposals, and space programs. My best learning experience 
was at Spar and I thank the management for encouraging me with progressively 
more responsible and challenging jobs during the period 1983–1996. The knowl­
edge and experience I gained at Spar was useful later during my professional career 
with Hughes/Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and now with Northrop Grumman. I must 
thank my colleagues Dr. Chih-Chien Hsu, Jim Wang, Minh Tang, Duy Nguyen, 
Sylvain Richard, Raj Sudarsanam, Joseph Kopal, Dr. Philip Law, Dr. Sebong Chun, 
Dr. Jon Gulick, and several others with whom I have worked closely and learned 
much during my association with them. My special thanks to Dr. Kwok-Kee Chan, 
whom I consider the best antenna consultant in the industry; I had the opportu­
nity to work with him on several difficult antenna projects over the past 30 years. 
Thanks also are due to Dr. Clency Lee-Yow, President of Custom Microwave Inc., 
with whom I had worked on advanced feed systems for several flight programs and 
jointly developed a novel high-power spacecraft thermal vacuum test method using 
pick-up horns. 
I am thankful to my coeditors Prof. Lot Shafai and Prof. Satish Sharma for all 
the planning, coordination, and motivation during the long and stressful two-year 
period when the book contents were being finalized. My personal thanks to all the 
chapter authors who took time in spite of their demanding schedules at work and 
spending numerous weekends shaping the technical contents of this book. All the 
authors have shown extreme dedication, professionalism, and cooperation during 
this project and I am grateful to them for their contributions. I thank Northrop 
Grumman management of Jon Gulick, Michelle Bailey, and Verne Nagayama for 
granting me permission to write this book. Special thanks to my best friend Dr. C. 
S. Rao and his wife Mrs. Chandra for their encouragement. I also want to thank 
my family friends in Los Angeles for their interest in my work and keeping me 
relaxed during weekends. Thanks are due to Artech House for guiding me through­
out the book development process and special thanks to Samantha Ronan, Lindsay 
Moore, Jack Stone, Alexis Merry, and Mark Walsh.
Most important, I am grateful to my family for their love and support during 
this endeavor. Without the help and encouragement of my wife Rajani and daugh­
ter Neha, it would not have been possible for me to complete this work.
This book is dedicated to my parents, my wife, and my daughter.

1.1  Introduction
Reflector antennas are widely used for Earth station, satellite, radar, radio astron­
omy, and deep space communications. The main advantage of reflector antennas 
is that they provide high gain values using a large passive aperture that reflects the 
RF signal from the feed without the need for active amplification. It also has the 
advantages of lower cost, lower mass, lower power, and grating-lobe free radiation 
when compared to array antennas and lens antennas.
Isaac Newton is the father of modern reflector antennas, having invented the 
optical reflective telescope in 1672. This type of telescope comprises a concave 
mirror that reflects light rays to a smaller plane mirror, which in turn focuses into 
an eyepiece, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Later developments in reflector antennas 
occurred during the 17th century through the efforts of Cassegrain and Gregory. 
Their work resulted in the dual-reflector Cassegrainian and Gregorian reflector 
configurations that are widely used even today. These two classic reflector configu­
rations are illustrated in Figure 1.2. 
During the 1950s and 1960s, reflector antennas found new applications in ter­
restrial communication systems, radio telescopes, Earth stations, radar antennas, 
and satellite communications. The use of reflector antennas for satellite communi­
cations started in 1960 with the launch of Echo 1, which employed a 30m reflec­
tor to test its propagation and transmission techniques. The launch of the Telstar 
satellite at the C-band (6-GHz uplink and 4-GHz downlink) paved the way to 
bent-pipe satellites for communication applications. Syncom III, launched in 1964, 
was a true geostationary satellite. “Early Bird,” launched in 1965 by Intelsat, was 
the first commercial trans-Atlantic satellite with 240 telephone circuits and live TV 
transmission. In 1965, Russia also launched its first communication satellite in the 
Molniya orbit.

Introduction
In the 1970s and 1980s, significant developments occurred in both satellite 
communication antennas and Earth station antennas. Large Earth stations have 
been constructed in the United States, Japan, and Europe that employ shaped dual-
reflector antennas and fixed-feed beam-waveguide technology with a focus on im­
proving the efficiency of antennas. Gridded reflector technology was developed in 
Canada and the United States for spacecraft reflector antennas. This technology 
allowed for reuse of the aperture space for two orthogonally polarized antenna 
surfaces that are placed one behind the other and fed with two separate feed ar­
rays. This in turn allowed for polarization reuse, which enabled the bandwidth to 
be increased twofold.
Large-mesh reflector technology was developed in late 1980s and early 1990s 
by Harris and Astro-Mesh (now Northrop Grumman) for mobile applications. 
This technology allowed for the use of large reflectors (5 to 12m) that could be 
folded in a small volume for stowage and deployed in space. More recently, large 
reflectors of 22m and more have been built and flown by the space industry for 
both commercial and military applications.
During the late 1980s, another important development occurred in the form 
of shaped reflector technology [1]. Shaped reflector technology allowed contoured 
beam shapes to be created by changing the reflector surface shape and using a sin­
gle-feed instead of large-feed array with a beam-forming network feeding the array. 
This technology has significant benefits in terms of reducing the overall mass and 
cost of the payloads. Shaped dual-reflector Gregorian systems have been developed 
for both linear and circular polarization applications.
Multiple-beam antennas have been developed for mobile and personal commu­
nication applications starting in the 1990s. Several satellite systems, such as M-Sat, 
Anik-E, Globalstar, Inmarsat, ACeS, and Thuraya, have employed multiple beams 
with frequency reuse schemes to increase the effective bandwidths by factors of 4 
to 30. Direct broadcast satellites were developed during the 1990s that resulted in 
high-power downlink beams providing regional coverage that allowed users to re­
ceive signals directly from a satellite using pizza-sized dishes at their homes. Local-

channel broadcasts through the use of multiple spot beams augmented DBS service 
to designated market areas.
With the development of high-power spacecraft buses with 10 to 20 kW of 
DC power, each satellite was able to carry hybrid payloads offering multiple ser­
vices. Reflector and feed technologies have been developed in the recent past that 
allow multiple frequency bands through a single reflector antenna. In addition, 
compact and low-loss feed assemblies and feed networks have been developed by 
several manufacturers throughout the world. Advanced designs with low passive

Introduction
intermodulation (PIM) products and high-power handling technologies have been 
developed during the past 30 years, thus improving the reliability and extending 
the capability of the high-power payloads. Reconfigurable reflector antenna tech­
nology has been developed for DABS (digital audio broadcast satellites) and has 
been successfully flown on Sirius-1 and Sirius-2 satellites that operate in highly 
inclined elliptical orbits. Flat reflector technologies have been developed for radar 
and remote sensing technologies. 
Several excellent books have covered conventional reflector antennas in the 
past [2–6]. However, developments during the past two decades have not been 
documented properly. The intent of this volume of the handbook is to address the 
latest developments in reflector antennas for space, ground, remote sensing, and 
terahertz applications. This volume will be useful for practicing engineers as well as 
academic researchers. All of the chapters have been written by experts in the indus­
try and in academia who bring their valuable experience in dealing with practical 
antennas, hardware design, and related issues. Some of the topics addressed are 
new and documented here for the first time in textbook form.

1.2  Reflector Antenna Basics
Reflector antennas are used for transmission and reception of RF signals provid­
ing high gain. They are preferred over other directive antenna types such as array 
antennas and lens antennas due to their low cost and low mass and because they 
do not require active components, they avoid the use of complex beam-forming 
networks, and they provide large bandwidths. Gain and directivity definitions of 
reflector antennas are sometimes not correctly used. The directivity of the reflector 
antenna is defined as:

The thermal loss is accounted for by computing the directivity with reflector 
surfaces at various temperatures and subtracting the directivity value with ambi­
ent surface. This is typically computed since gain measurements with thermal loss 
are not feasible in practice. Thermal losses include mispointing losses and surface 
distortion losses. 
It is important to optimize the directivity of the reflector antenna by design 
and minimize the feed and reflector losses through hardware design, manufacture, 
and implementation. The key system parameters impacted by the reflector antenna 
design are the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) and the gain-to-noise tem­

can be improved by designing the feed system to provide optimal illumination taper 
(typically 12 to 15 dB of taper), minimizing the feed assembly losses, minimizing the 
surface errors on the reflector system, and minimizing cross-polar levels.
Advanced reflector systems and advanced feed systems have been developed 
to support multiple frequency bands. An example of an advanced feed assembly 
supporting C-band transmitting and receiving bands is shown in Figure 1.3. This 
system isolates the two bands with filters and a symmetric junction and has polar­
izers at both bands with LHCP and RHCP ports at each band. Losses are kept to 
a minimum by making the system very compact using advanced manufacturing 
techniques such as electroforming and minimizing the waveguide flange interfaces.

Chapter 2 describes the various types of reflector antennas used for satellite 
communications. An introduction to payload systems and the antenna farms typi­
cally used for satellites is given. Different types of reflector antennas used for space 
are described briefly. Contoured beam or shaped beam antennas are described later 
along with analysis results for C-band and Ku-band antennas for fixed satellite ser­
vices. The gain performance as function of reflector size is discussed along with the 
gain area product, which is sometimes used as the figure of merit of shaped beam 
antennas. A dual-reflector Gregorian antenna configuration for shaped beam ap­
plications is described. Gridded-reflector antennas with overlapping apertures pro­
viding polarization reuse for linear polarization applications are discussed along 
with design formulas for the grid geometry.
The subject of multiple-beam antennas (MBAs) is relatively new and is covered 
in detail in Chapter 2. Design of MBAs, analysis of MBA performance, and several 
applications of MBAs are discussed. Advanced feed technologies as well as reflec­
tor technologies that improve MBA performance are given with examples. MBAs 
for direct-to-home local-channel broadcast and personal communications satellites 
are also discussed. 
Chapter 3 provides past and recent developments on reflector antennas for ter­
restrial communications applications. This chapter describes reflector antennas in 
practical use, mainly focusing on terrestrial communications. Each of its sections 
describes reflector antennas for a specific application. Section 3.1 presents design 
technologies for beam-waveguide feed systems and practical examples in conjunc­
tion with large Earth station reflector antennas. The shaped Cassegrain antenna 
fed by a four-reflector beam-waveguide feed is described. This type of antenna is a 
standard for large Earth stations all over the world. Section 3.2 introduces a tri-re­
flector offset antenna for terrestrial microwave relay link systems. The reflector an­
tenna is shown to achieve very low cross-polar levels. Reflector antennas used for 
Japanese communication satellite 2 (CS-2) are described in Section 3.3. The shape 
of the wavefront, which corresponds to the desired beam cross section in the sense 
of geometrical optics, is analyzed, and the method used to synthesize the wavefront 
is discussed. The reflector shape is determined from the shape of the wavefront by 
the geometrical optics approach, which is adequate for this application.
Section 3.4 presents the elliptical aperture antenna for satellite news gather­
ing. The antenna is an offset Gregorian antenna with an elliptical main reflector. 
The elliptical aperture is used to reduce the interference from or to adjacent satel­
lites. Section 3.5 also describes a reflector antenna with an elliptical aperture for 
aeronautical satellite communication systems. The elliptical aperture allows for 
the realization of a very low profile antenna under severe envelope constraints

on the airplane. The dual-shaped reflector antenna is realized by using a physical 
optics shaping technique and achieves excellent electric performance. Section 3.6 
introduces the compact reflector antenna for use on vessels for mobile satellite 
communications. For such a system, the antenna needs to be designed to achieve 
low sidelobe and low cross-polar characteristics while keeping the antennas effi­
ciency high. Section 3.7 presents a reflector antenna that is used for simultaneous 
reception from broadcast satellites (BS) and communication satellites (CS). The 
optimum reflector for a single-reflector wide beam-spacing multibeam antenna is 
presented on the basis of wave aberration analysis of defocus-fed reflectors.
Terahertz imaging applications rely on the use of focusing and nonfocusing re­
flector systems. Chapter 4 describes the recent developments in the area of terahertz 
reflector antennas. These systems need to steer the beam over the intended field of 
view with specific spatial resolution. One possible solution is to use focal plane 
arrays (i.e., a camera-like staring imager) that would acquire information from sev­
eral image pixels simultaneously. In the terahertz regime, this is a feasible solution 
for passive detectors, such as bolometers or superconducting detectors, commonly 
used for space applications. However, terahertz heterodyne detector array technol­
ogy is still under development. In such cases most of the current state-of-the-art im­
aging systems, especially for terrestrial applications, make use of antenna reflector 
systems integrated with mechanical scanners in order to generate the image. The 
properties and typical configurations of focusing reflector systems for both types 
of image acquisition are addressed in Chapter 4. An analytical expression of the 
vectorial field in the focal plane of a general focusing system is derived. This deri­
vation is very useful to study the properties of this field and establish equivalence 
between reflector systems focusing in the near and far regions. Moreover, once 
this focal plane field is known, it is shown that the power received by an array of 
antennas in the focal plane can be calculated by using its effective length. With this 
calculation of the received power, the trade-offs between focal plane sampling and 
image acquisition velocity for passive detectors and different types of sources (i.e., 
isolated sources¯ and distributed incoherent sources) can be established.
Recent developments in the area of multiband reflector antennas and associ­
ated feed horns are described in Chapter 5. These antennas are capable of support­
ing multiple frequency bands that are separated in frequency and covering several 
octave bandwidths. They have the advantage of using a single antenna instead of 
several antennas, resulting in reduced costs and reduced mass. Advanced reflector 
technologies such as stepped-reflectors, reflectors with partially reflective surfaces, 
and shaped reflectors are presented. Feed advancements in terms of multimode 
horns with several “slope discontinuities” and feed assembly developments to iso­
late the frequency bands are discussed in Chapter 5. 
Chapter 6 presents reflector antennas used for remote sensing of the Earth and 
other bodies in the solar system and relevant sensor technologies to detect and clas­
sify objects by means of propagated electromagnetic radiation. Sensors deployed 
on aircraft or satellites make it possible to collect data on a global scale that would 
not otherwise be practical to obtain. Remote sensing is used for a wide variety of 
science applications ranging from global measurement of ocean topography and 
deforestation to the study of Jupiter’s atmosphere. The military employs remote 
sensing techniques to collect data about opposing forces, weather conditions and 
other information relevant to its mission. The chapter presents technologies related

to active and passive remote sensing. Remote sensing system design is driven by the 
science requirements that define the mission. Consequently, both the system and an­
tenna designs need to be tailored to meet the unique mission science requirements. 
For spaceborne remote sensing applications, reflector antennas have historically 
been the most widely used antennas. Characteristics of the antenna such as beam 
shape, sidelobe levels, cross-polar isolation, efficiency, and scanning capability are 
driven by specific system design requirements. Chapter 6 also presents an overview 
of the various types of reflector antenna designs used for remote sensing applica­
tions. Antennas flown on historically significant missions are used to illustrate the 
practical implementation of each antenna type. In addition, the chapter presents 
notable antenna research developments that are regarded as enabling technologies 
for new types of sensors.
Chapter 7 presents two key sections related to the feed assemblies used for 
reflector antennas in space and to a certain extent in ground applications. It pro­
vides the component designs, manufacture, and test results for various types of 
feed assemblies employed in the C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band. The feed compo­
nents include horns, orthomode transducers (OMTs), polarizers, filters, diplexers, 
combiners/dividers, and transitions. Manufacturing approaches that yield precise 
tolerances required for high-performance feeds are discussed. The advantages of 
advanced design, analyses, manufacture, and test of integrated feed assembly in­
stead of conventional piece-part design are discussed. The satellite industry has 
recently recognized the benefits of integrated feed assembly design relative to the 
conventional discrete component approach and started using this approach for the 
feed designs. The second part of Chapter 7 deals with three important aspects of 
spacecraft antennas and feeds: passive intermodulation (PIM), multipaction, and 
corona. These aspects are critical in high-power payloads and multichannel repeat­
ers and significantly impact the feed and reflector design. Design guidelines and 
methods to mitigate potential risks due to PIM and multiplication to satellites are 
discussed.
Space reflectors, whose size is larger than the fairing of the booster that carries 
them, need to be “folded up” in some manner for launch, and then “unfurled” on 
orbit to their full size. These are typically referred to as “deployable” reflectors, 
and are the subject of Chapter 8. This chapter is organized into three main sections. 
The first section deals with reflector classifications either according to the surface 
geometry (such as parabolic vs. shaped, circular vs. elliptical, and center-fed vs. off­
set-fed reflectors) or according to the surface type (such as rigid/segmented, semi­
rigid, inflatable/rigidizable, woven-mesh and knitted-mesh surfaces). The second 
section deals in more detail with the major constituents/components of the knitted-
mesh type reflector, which is the most commonly flown reflector in space of all of 
the various types of deployable reflectors. The third and final section addresses the 
major design requirements/considerations for a typical deployable reflector subsys­
tem including electrical, mechanical, thermal, and environmental drivers. 
Finally, Chapter 9 is intended to provide the reader with a framework and top-
level understanding of the elements and requirements that must be considered in 
the successful design, fabrication, and testing of a spaceflight antenna reflector. It is 
a guide based on the more than 30 years of professional experience of the authors 
in engineering, fabricating, and testing spaceflight antenna reflectors and systems. 
Because the state of the art in antenna reflector design continually advances, this 

1.3  Organization of Book Chapters 
11
chapter is purposely written to provide general recommendations for configura­
tion, design approach, materials, and testing. A wealth of information is available 
from composite materials suppliers, technical papers, and organizations, so it is left 
to the reader to perform the detailed analyses, engineering, and materials research 
to establish the best possible specific choices relative to the set of requirements for 
the particular reflector being considered.
A successful antenna reflector design is always a carefully balanced combina­
tion of many specific and interdependent choices that must all work together to 
achieve the best possible results. The mechanical design of reflector antennas has to 
satisfy electrical, spacecraft, launch load, vibration, extreme thermal, deployment 
in space, stowage, low mass, pointing, and structural requirements simultaneously.
This volume provides all aspects of reflector antennas for space and ground 
applications. As the antenna technology moves towards the terahertz regime, new 
types of reflector antenna designs and novel manufacturing methods will evolve in 
the future.

2.1  Introduction
Reflector antennas are widely used in space applications for communication satel­
lites, military satellites, deep space exploration missions, cross-link communica­
tion among satellites, space stations, and remote sensing satellites [1, 2]. The main 
reasons for the use of reflector antennas as opposed to other types, such as array 
antennas and lens antennas, are mature technology, low cost, high performance, 
low losses, low cross-polar levels, light weight, thermal stability, simpler feeds, and 
wide bandwidths. A good review of conventional reflector antennas has been pro­
vided by Rudge [3] and Johnson and Jasik [4]. Although parabolic reflectors were 
widely used in earlier applications, the design and implementation of advanced 
reflector antennas has evolved mostly due to the stringent performance require­
ments and additional capabilities dictated by the space industry operators. Com­
munication satellites have multiple reflector antennas on each spacecraft that cater 
to various services. Typical satellite services that employ reflector antennas include 
the following:
••
Fixed satellite services (FSS) that provide shaped or contoured beams for 
domestic or regional satellite services. These antennas operate in the C-band, 
Ku-band, or Ka-band providing both uplink (satellite receives from ground) 
and downlink (satellite transmits to ground) beams from the same antenna 
or using two antennas.
••
Broadcast satellite services (BSS) that provide mostly downlink beams over a 
coverage region such as the continental United States. This type of antenna

operates over a narrow transmit (Tx) band (typically the Ku-band or K-
band) and provides a highly contoured beam to compensate for the rain 
attenuation. With the recent approval of local-channel broadcast through 
satellites, multiple reflector antennas are typically used for providing several 
spot beams on the ground. Both DirecTV and EchoStar operators have suc­
cessfully used local-channel broadcast satellites for continental U.S. (CO­
NUS) services and extended CONUS services.
••
Personal communication services (PCS) at the K/Ka-band. These systems em­
ploy multiple reflector antennas where each reflector uses a large number 
of feeds for personal communication and data transfer from user-to-user 
via satellite. Such a system typically employs a forward link from ground-
to-satellite-to-user and a return link from user-to-satellite-to-ground. These 
systems employ a number of overlapping spot beams for both forward and 
return links. The capacity of the satellite depends on number of factors such 
as number of beams, frequency reuse scheme, gain of the spot beams, EIRP, 
G/T, copolar isolation among reuse beams, cross-polar isolation, pointing 
error of the satellite, and the DC power capability of the satellite.
••
Mobile satellite services (MSS) that provide communication to mobile users 
via satellite. These mobile satellites operate at lower frequencies (the UHF, L-
band, or S-band) and, therefore, need to use large deployable reflectors in the 
range of 5 to 22m that take advantage of mesh reflector technology. The feed 
array employs a large number of feeds to generate a large number of over­
lapping beams on the ground. Low-level beam-forming networks combined 
with matrix power amplifiers (MPAs) for distributed power amplification 
on the Tx link and low noise amplifiers (LNA) redundancy on the receiving 
(Rx) end are typically used. 
••
Intersatellite services (ISS) that provide communication links and data trans­
fers from satellite-to-satellite. This includes, for example, a satellite constel­
lation used for global communications. Such systems typically employ large 
gimbaled reflectors with autotrack capability. Center-fed dual-reflector sys­
tems with tracking feeds are employed while the antenna is mounted on a 
gimbal mechanism to scan the beam. These are also called cross-link com­
munications antennas.
Communications links are established between satellite and ground, satellite to 
aircraft, satellite to user, or satellite to satellite. The satellite links for FSS and DBS 
satellites are illustrated in Figure 2.1. The FSS has both an uplink and a downlink 
covering the domestic region with contoured beams, whereas the BSS has mainly 
a downlink contoured beam covering the domestic region; its uplink is provided 
through spot beams from ground sites.
Typical satellites have a number of reflector antennas and associated repeaters 
to support hybrid payloads serving, for example, FSS, PCS, and MSS services. The 
spacecraft bus needs to accommodate several large reflectors stowed in a small vol­
ume so that they can fit in the launch fairing envelope, which is about 4 to 5m in 
diameter. This critical requirement demands that several reflectors be deployed in 
space from the stowed launch configuration of the spacecraft. The deployed reflec­
tors are mostly accommodated on the east and west sides of the spacecraft and in

some cases on the nadir deck as well. Fixed smaller reflectors without deployment 
are placed on the nadir deck of the spacecraft along with tracking, telemetry, and 
command antennas and global horns. The majority of the reflectors employ an off­
set configuration to avoid blockage by the feed(s) and/or subreflectors. The feeds 
for all of the reflectors are fixed on the east-west corners of the spacecraft and on 
the nadir deck. This is due to the fact that the feed assemblies carry high power and 
are sensitive to passive intermodulation (PIM). Figure 2.2 shows a typical satellite 
in the deployed configuration. Solar panels are deployed along the north-south 
directions to track the sun.
The payload for any satellite service includes the antenna subsystem and the 
repeater subsystem. The antenna provides the desired radiation characteristics in 
terms of beam shape tailored to the coverage region, required gain to close the 
communication links, desired polarization (either single or dual), diplexing func­
tion between the Tx and Rx bands, high cross-polar isolation for polarization reuse 
systems, copolar isolation outside the coverage, and sidelobe shaping as desired by 
the customer needs.
Figure 2.3 shows the block diagram for a bent-pipe satellite payload providing 
FSS service. The reflector antenna in this example employs a gridded reflector with 
two overlapping surfaces where the front reflector provides vertical polarization 
and the back surface provides horizontal polarization. Each reflector is shaped to 
provide a contoured beam over the coverage region and is fed with its own horn 
with either vertical or horizontal polarization. Each feed is diplexed to isolate the 
Tx and the Rx frequency bands. On the receiving side, the antenna receives the 
RF signals from ground. The uplink signals go through the input filter assembly 
(IFA), receivers that downconvert the 6-GHz signals to 4-GHz signals, and then 
through input multiplexers (IMUX) that separate the wideband signal into various

narrowband frequency channels. These narrowband channels are amplified through 
traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) that are designed to provide the required 
RF power, and combined again through an output multiplexer (OMUX), and then 
transmitted to ground through the Tx antenna. There are redundant networks for 
the receivers and TWTAs in case of primary unit failures. These satellites do not 
have a processor on board and, therefore, they are called bent-pipe transponders 
or receivers.

2.1  Introduction

Key system parameters for the satellites are G/T (gain-to-noise temperature 
ratio) and EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power). Both of these parameters are 
the figures of merit for the satellite design and depend on the antenna gain at both 
the Tx and Rx bands. The communication link quality is determined by the signal-
to-noise power ratio, which is defined in decibels as:

where SL is the system loss in decibels and Bw is the signal bandwidth in hertz. 
The EIRP depends on the transmit power, losses from the amplifier output to the 
antenna, and the antenna gain. The G/T depends on the Rx antenna gain, antenna 
noise temperature, front-end losses, and noise figure of the LNA. The system losses 
include free-space path loss from satellite to ground, atmospheric losses, polar­
ization losses, and loss due to satellite pointing errors. The free-space path loss 
depends on the distance R between the satellite and ground terminal and the wave­
length. It is given in decibels as:

The loss due to pointing error is generally taken care of in the design by ex­
panding the coverage region with the radial pointing error and synthesizing the 
shaped beam with the expanded coverage region and computing the minimum 
coverage area gain. For a spot beam payload, the gain loss (in decibels) due to

where P.E is the satellite worst-case pointing error, and θ3h is the half beamwidth 
at the –3 dB level of the spot beam. For shaped beams the loss is smaller due to 
beam spreading. Antenna gain is very important for satellite designers because it 
has a significant impact on both the uplink G/T and downlink EIRP. Many design­
ers spend a lot of time optimizing the antenna gain values to the last fraction of a 
decibel. Other challenges include minimizing the front-end antenna losses, design­
ing the feed components to meet the high-power handling requirements, meeting 
the low PIM requirements, and improving the copolar and cross-polar isolations 
of the antenna.
Many types of reflector antennas are used for satellite communications. The 
type of reflector antenna depends on the satellite payload requirements and the 
accommodation on the spacecraft. Commonly used reflector antennas for com­
munication satellites are:

in other chapters of this three-volume handbook.
2.2  Contoured Beam Antennas
The contoured beam antennas are the most widely used type in satellite communi­
cations. They are also called shaped beam antennas. These antennas provide down­
link and/or uplink beams that are tailored to fit the geographic coverage region as 
seen from a geostationary satellite from a given orbital slot. Contoured beams can 
be generated using phased arrays or reflectors. Phased arrays have these limita­
tions: narrow bandwidth, lower efficiency of SSPAs, higher DC power dissipation, 
increased delivery schedule, and increased cost and mass. Reflector antennas are 
most commonly used for contoured beam applications and other satellite applica­
tions. Offset-fed reflector configurations (single or dual) are suitable for eliminating 
the geometrical blockage caused by feeds/subreflectors and are simpler to accom­
modate on spacecraft. Two methods are used to generate a contoured beam on the 
ground from a satellite using reflector antennas: (1) a parabolic reflector that is fed 
with a feed array and (2) a shaped reflector with a single feed.
Satellite payloads prior to 1990 employed parabolic reflectors with a large 
number of feed horns [5, 6]. The RF signals to the feed array are combined through 
a beam-forming network (BFN) with appropriate amplitude and phase weight­
ings that are designed to shape the beam. The BFN is realized using a waveguide 
medium at the Ku-band and higher bands and using a TEM-line medium (also 
referred as square-ax medium) at the C-band and lower bands to reduce mass. It 
is designed using a number of couplers with different coupling values, line lengths 
for phase optimization, phase-slope equalizers for maintaining the phase distribu­
tion over the frequency band, and filters to reject frequencies outside the band. 
Because of the bandwidth limitation of the BFN, the parabolic reflector with feed 
array requires two such antennas: one for transmitting and another for receiving, 
which makes it expensive and heavy. The shaped reflector with a single feed avoids 
the need for a BFN and typically requires a single wideband antenna supporting 
both Tx and Rx beams. The Tx and the Rx frequency bands are separated through

Figure 2.4.

This section describes the single-offset solid reflector used for contoured beam 
applications. The reflectors are typically made of graphite material for thermal 
stability and lower mass. The primary objective of the design is to maximize the

minimum gain over the coverage region. The coverage region is irregularly shaped 
to fit a domestic country as seen by the satellite or a region comprising several coun­
tries. Other secondary objectives include:
••
Maximize the cross-polar isolation over the coverage.
••
Maximize the copolar isolation among countries/regions that could poten­
tially use the same frequencies.
••
Minimize the antenna losses, including those from the feed assembly, reflec­
tor manufacture (surface errors), and thermal distortion.
••
Maximize the power handling capability of the feed components.
••
Minimize the interference due to PIM products.
The advantages of a shaped reflector relative to a conventional parabolic re­
flector with a feed array are better antenna directivity due to lower spillover losses, 
lower insertion loss due to elimination of the BFN, better gain and cross-polar 
performance due to avoidance of mutual coupling effects among the feed elements, 
and amplitude and phase variations of the BFN over the frequency and thermal 
ranges. 
The reflector geometry needs to be selected first based on the overall satellite 
system requirements and the spacecraft constraints. Typical satellites carry hybrid 
payloads on the spacecraft that cater to multiple services from a single satellite. 
Several reflector antennas may need to be accommodated on the spacecraft that 
must fit the limited launch fairing of mostly 4m (in some cases 5m) in the stowed 
configuration. The reflectors are generally deployed with the feed assembly fixed-
mounted on the spacecraft.
The key design parameters for the shaped reflector are reflector diameter (D), 
focal length (F), offset clearance (h), feed illumination taper or size, and the fre­
quency bandwidth covering both the Tx and Rx bands. The reflector size is dic­
tated by the system and spacecraft requirements. The focal length is dictated by 
the cross-polar requirements and the beam squint for circular polarizations. The 
F/D ratio needs to be in the range of 0.8 to 1.4, which is a compromise in terms 
of achieving good cross-polar isolation and minimizing the beam squint for CP 
versus mechanical constraints to minimize the deployment boom and mass. The 
offset clearance h is selected such that there is no blockage from the feed assembly 
over the coverage region. Good design practices impose a blockage-free condition 
where the coverage region is expanded by about 3 deg. Figure 2.5 illustrates the 
geometrical parameters of the reflector antenna. The angular parameters of the 
starting offset parabolic reflector prior to shaping are given as:

The angle θ0 determines the feed illumination taper on the reflector and is designed 
with a minimum taper of 15 dB at the lowest frequency of the band(s). It is impor­
tant when selecting the offset clearance h that consideration be given to maintaining 
a blockage-free condition for all coverage angles of the contoured beam from the 
antenna boresight. The maximum angle for blockage-free condition θsm depends 
on the offset clearance, focal length, and the diameter d of the feed and is given as:

For linear polarization applications, the cross-polar isolation is intrinsically 
poor because of the offset configuration of the reflector. Cross-polar suppression 
in addition to the copolar gain contours needs to be incorporated as part of the 
synthesis for reflector shaping. However, for circular polarization applications, the 
reflector does not induce any cross-polar components and the feed assembly cross-
polar levels due to the feed horn and polarizer dominate the antenna level cross-
polar isolation. The offset geometry causes beam squint in the offset plane and is 
given approximately as [7, 8]:

slightly from the reflector focus in order to compensate for the beam squint for 
single sense of circular polarization application or can be accounted for in the shap­
ing process.
Reflector synthesis can be carried out by two methods. An indirect method 
involves designing the surface of the reflector such that it produces a given aperture 
field, which is known to generate a desired far field. The synthesis of the desired 
aperture field most often involves the iterative solution of partial differential equa­
tions that describe the relationship between feed and aperture power distributions, 
and is based on geometrical optics (GO).
The second method is a direct method and is the method most oftenly used. 
In this method, the reflector system is designed such that it produces a prescribed 
far field. The reflector is initially defined in terms of a base surface, for example, a 
paraboloid, and a perturbed surface is then superimposed on the base surface [9]. 
The perturbed surface is defined in terms of a series expansion function such as 
Zernike polynomials or cubic spline functions. At each iterative stage the far field 
is calculated at a number of sample points and compared to the objective func­
tion. This is used to change the coefficients of the expansion until a better match 
is achieved. Physical optics is used to obtain the far field in each calculation. Typi­
cally the expansion functions used are cubic splines because they provide the best 
fit for rapidly varying surfaces due to their local nature. Zernike polynomials are 
also used to define the surface. TICRA’s POS and GRASP commercial software 
programs [10] are used as industry standards for synthesis and analysis of shaped 
reflector contoured beam antennas. A flowchart for the contoured beam design is 
illustrated in Figure 2.6.
The performance of the contoured beam is sometimes defined in terms of gain 
area product (GAP). An ideal GAP for a uniformly illuminated coverage area with 
no radiation outside the coverage is 41,253 [4p steradians = 4*π*(180/π)*(180/π)]. 
This is not practical because it requires an infinite size reflector with no spillover 
and other losses. The GAP for contour beams is generally in the range of 6,000 to 
25,000 and is highly dependent on the reflector size relative to wavelength (D/λ), 
bandwidth of operation, the coverage shape, cross-polar isolation, and sidelobe 
isolation outside the coverage region. The gain in GAP is the minimum gain over 
the coverage region, which usually occurs near the edge of the coverage. The gain 
variation over the coverage region designed with uniform weighting depends on 
the reflector size and the coverage area and varies in the range of 1.0 to 4.0 dB. A 
larger reflector tends to have more uniformly shaped contoured beams with less 
gain variation over the coverage region and hence provides better edge-of-coverage 
gain.
Ku-Band Contoured Beam Design 
Examples of the contoured beam design for Ku-band FSS and BSS payloads are 
discussed in this section. Two coverage regions, the continental United States (CO­
NUS) and South America (SA), are considered from a geostationary satellite at a 
101° W orbital slot. The coverage areas on ground as seen from a geostationary 
satellite are 13 square degrees for CONUS and 26.45 square degrees for SA. The 
reflector is illuminated with a corrugated feed having a minimum illumination of 
14 dB at Tx frequencies and 19 dB at Rx frequencies. Such high illumination tapers 

2.2  Contoured Beam Antennas 
23
(exceeding 14 dB) are required in order to minimize the spillover losses. Various 
reflector sizes are considered in this parametric design and results are summarized 
here for the following FSS and BSS design cases:
Case 1: FSS antenna with Tx band of 10.95 to 12.2 GHz and Rx band of 14.00 
to 14.50 GHz.
Case 2: BSS antenna with Tx band of 12.20 to 12.70 GHz.
Synthesized gain contours of Case 1 over CONUS coverage are shown for 
transmitting and receiving in Figures 2.7 and 2.8, respectively. Minimum coverage 
gain is 31.7 dBi while the peak gain is 33.1 dBi. There is a 1.4 dB gain variation 
over the coverage region. Larger variation can be expected if copolar isolation of 
more than 27 dB needs to be achieved over another spatially isolated region outside 
CONUS (for example, Brazil). The minimum coverage gain will also be reduced by 
about 0.5 to 1.0 dB if stringent copolar isolation requirements need to be met. Gain 
contours over South America for Case 1 are shown in Figures 2.9 and 2.10 for the 
transmitting and receiving bands, respectively. Minimum gain over the coverage is 
29.25 dBi. This gain is 2.45 dB lower than the CONUS gain due to the larger cover 
region (the SA coverage area is about 2.03 times larger than the CONUS coverage 
area). Gain variation is about 1.25 dB for this case with no sidelobe constraints. 
Case 2 BSS transmit-only design results with weighted coverage gain require­
ments over the CONUS and SA regions are shown in Figures 2.11 and 2.12, respec­
tively. The weighted coverage requirements are needed to compensate for the larger

atmospheric attenuation in the rain regions of the coverage with higher antenna 
gain requirements. Peak to edge variations are larger in the weighted coverage cases 
(>4 dB) as seen from the plots. Typical cross-polar isolation contours of the FSS 
antenna with LP are shown in Figure 2.13, which illustrates worst-case cross-polar 
discrimination (XPD) values of better than 23 dB. The XPD is defined as the worst-
case ratio of the copolar signal to the cross-polar signal evaluated at each point 
within the coverage region. Higher XPD values can be achieved by using longer a 
F/D of the reflector and shaping the surface for XPD suppression.
The GAP depends primarily on the reflector diameter (D/λ) and the coverage 
area and to a certain extent on the shape of the coverage. Tables 2.1 and 2.2 sum­
marize results for several designs carried out for the CONUS and SA areas at the 
C-band and Ku-band using the reflector diameter as a variable. The GAP varies 
from 6,222 to 15,575 for C-band designs and varies from 13,303 to 23,037 for 
Ku-band designs. The following conclusions are drawn from the results shown in 
the table and the industry experience:
••
The GAP or minimum coverage gain is proportional to the reflector diameter 
D/λ. Larger reflectors have better shaping capability with lower peak to edge 
gain variation.

••
Larger coverage areas have increased GAP due to better shaping potential 
with more uniform directivity contours over the coverage and with less peak 
to edge variation in directivity.
••
The GAP also depends on the amount of cross-polar suppression within 
the coverage region. Note that a single-offset reflector produces significant 
cross-polar levels for linear polarization (about 20 dB XPD) and needs to be 
suppressed by about 15 dB in order to meet the cross-polar isolation require­
ments of better than 30 dB. This suppression can be achieved through shap­
ing of the reflector surface at the expense of lowering the minimum coverage 
area directivity by about 0.5 dB.
••
The GAP also depends on the copolar isolation requirements outside the 
coverage region. It depends on the spatial distance of other service regions 
from the designed coverage and the area that needs to be suppressed. The 
EOC gain impact could be anywhere from 0.0 to 1.0 dB.
Results of the minimum edge of coverage gain as a function of the reflector size 
are shown in Figure 2.14. Practicing engineers are often interested in how much 
gain improvement can be made for contoured beam designs if a different reflector

size is shown. Figure 2.15 shows the EOC gain delta as a function of the reflector 
size. The gain values with a 1.0m reflector size are used as a reference in the plot 
shown in Figure 2.15. 
2.2.2  Dual-Offset Gregorian Reflectors
The dual-reflector shaped Gregorian is widely used for both FSS and BSS applica­
tions. It gives better cross-polar performance relative to a single shaped reflector 
for linear polarizations. Also, it has two reflector surfaces that provide better shap­
ing potential of the contoured beams. It is well known that an offset dual-reflector 
antenna can be designed to eliminate geometrical optics cross-polarization in the 
main reflector aperture [11, 12]. The feed horn is typically larger since it illuminates 
the smaller subreflector with an illumination taper of better than 15 dB. The sub­
reflector is generally in the near-field region of the feed horn and near-field analysis 
of the feed horn is required through the use of spherical harmonics. Diffraction ef­
fects may increase the cross-polarization in a practical offset dual-reflector system, 
especially one with small subreflectors. To avoid this, an enlarged subreflector size 
is often used, particularly at C-band frequencies. Typical sizes of Gregorian reflec­
tors are:
••
Deployable reflectors: 2m and higher main and 0.7m sub (at Ku-band).
••
Earth deck: 0.8 to 1.5m main and 0.45m sub (Ku-band).
••
Steerable beam applications: 0.8 to 1.0m main and 0.4m sub.

Reflector Antennas for Space Communications
The geometry of the dual-offset Gregorian antenna that satisfies the low cross-
polar Mizuguchi condition [11] is illustrated in Figure 2.16. The geometry of the 
system can be specified by the following six parameters:
••
Diameter of the main reflector, D.
••
Focal length of the main reflector, F.
••
Half distance between the focal points of the subreflector, C.
••
Eccentricity of the sub reflector, e.
••
Angle between the main reflector and subreflector axis, α.

2.2.3  Gridded-Reflector Antennas
Gridded reflectors are used for dual-linear polarization FSS applications at C-band 
and Ku-band. The first dual-gridded reflector antenna was developed by SPAR 
Aerospace Limited and was successfully flown on an RCA Satcom satellite in 1975 
and later by Hughes Aircraft Company. It employs two different reflectors with 
overlapped apertures where the front reflector surface is gridded and the grids are 
laid in such a fashion that they are parallel to either vertical or horizontal polar­
izations and the back reflector is either gridded (orthogonal to the front-reflector 
grids) or solid graphite supporting the opposite sense of linear polarization relative 
to the front reflector. Each of the two reflectors is illuminated by its own feed horn 
or horn arrays. The main features and advantages of the gridded reflectors over 
solid reflectors are as follows:
••
Provides twofold frequency reuse through orthogonally polarized (VP and 
HP) beams.
••
The antenna assembly consists of two reflectors with orthogonal grids shar­
ing a common aperture.

the SA area at the Ku-band Tx using a 2.3m main reflector. The XPD is better than 33 dB over SA.

••
The cross-polar levels of the antenna are lowered by at least 15 dB relative 
to solid reflectors.
••
The reflector assembly comprises two Kevlar honeycomb laminated reflector 
shells, one in the front and the other in the back, which are connected by an 
outer ring. Polarization grids are formed by etching copper from the Kapton 
face sheets.
••
VP and HP reflectors employ different focal lengths to spatially separate the 
two reflector shells and also isolate the two feeds/feed-arrays.
Three types of gridded reflectors are used for satellite communications:
••
Dual-gridded parabolic reflectors fed with two feed arrays and correspond­
ing beam-forming networks (DGP).
••
Dual-gridded shaped reflectors with two feed horns (DGS).
••
Gridded front and solid graphite back shaped reflectors with two feed horns 
(GS).
The concept of DGP is illustrated in Figure 2.19. Each reflector surface sup­
ports one linear polarization (VP or HP) and is illuminated by its own feed array 
to shape the beam. By optimizing the feed array amplitude and phase excitations, 
contoured beams are generated. It is common to use rectangular horns for linear 
polarization applications, since they have excellent cross-polar levels and also al­
low the number of feeds in the array to be minimized. The horn elements are

attached to diplexers in order to separate the Tx and Rx frequency bands. The two 
outputs of the diplexers for each array element are combined through two sepa­
rate beam-forming networks, one for transmitting and the other for receiving. The 
BFNs are implemented in waveguide (Ku-band) or TEM-line media (C-band) using 
hybrid couplers, loads, and line lengths in order to achieve the desired excitations. 
Key aspects of the BFN are high power handling, low insertion loss, and minimal 
variation of excitations over frequency and over temperature range.
The DGS antenna configuration is similar to the one shown in Figure 2.19 with 
the exception that the reflectors are shaped surfaces instead of parabolic and each 
feed array is replaced with a feed horn. Advantage of the DGS relative to DGP is 
that it eliminates the need for BFNs, which results in a significant mass, cost, and 
schedule savings, lower losses, and better RF performance. The GS configuration 
is similar to DGS, but the rear surface is solid graphite surface instead of gridded 
surface. The GS gridded reflectors are most widely used nowadays for fixed satel­
lite services at C-band and Ku-band. 
The gridded reflector antennas have two major types: laterally displaced re­
flectors and a rotated reflector system, as illustrated in Figure 2.20. The laterally 
displaced system has partially overlapped reflectors and the rotated reflector sys­
tem has completely overlapped reflectors that are more compact. The feeds of the 
rotated reflector system are also rotated, providing more spacing between the two 
horns/horn arrays. The rotated reflector system is most commonly used in space­
crafts due to compact size. The RF analysis of the gridded reflectors needs to take 
into account the various contributions from the two reflectors, two feeds, and two 
polarizations for detailed copolar and cross-polar analyses. This is illustrated in 
Figure 2.21 and the various contributions are explained here:

overlap of the two apertures while the rotated system has complete overlap.

CA,1: copolar signal from feed A reflected from reflector surface S1.
XA,1: cross-polar signal from feed A reflected from surface S1 with grid suppres­
sion of >12 dB.
CB,2: copolar signal from feed B reflected from rear reflector surface S2.
XB,1: cross-polar signal from feed B reflected from surface S1 without any sup­
pression. This signal has the same polarization of CA,1 and typically scans 
outside the coverage due to feed separation. It is important to keep this contri­
bution far outside the coverage so that it does not impact the copolar contours 
from feed A. Increased feed separation keeps this signal within the coverage 
region low.
XA,2: cross-polar signal from feed A reflected from rear surface S2 without any 
suppression. This signal has the same polarization as CB,2, but scans outside the 
coverage region due to spatial separation of the two feeds. It is important to 
keep this contribution far outside the coverage region with sufficient separation 
between the two feeds.
XB,2: cross-polar signal of feed B leaking through the front shell and reflected 
back from the front shell out to the rear reflector. This contribution is very low 
and negligible.
The geometry of the gridded reflector to determine the minimum thickness 
between the two surfaces is shown in Figure 2.22. The spacing between the shells’

where D is the projected diameter of the reflector and the variable T also depends 
on the mechanical design of the dual-shell gridded reflector assembly. The two shells 
are attached through a ring structure for mechanical design integrity. The choice of 
the front and rear reflector polarizations depends on where the antenna is placed 
on the spacecraft. The antenna with worst-case polarization is kept in the back in 
order to get cross-pol suppression protection from the front shell grids. For an east-
west offset when the antenna is deployed in the east or west side of the spacecraft, 
the cross-pol is the worst for the HP reflector; hence, it is placed on the rear and the 
VP reflector is placed in the front (closer to the feeds). For antennas placed on the 
deck of the spacecraft with a north-south offset, the cross-pol is the worst for the 
VP reflector, so it is placed in the back and HP reflector is in the front shell. 
The key design parameters are the grid parameters. These are the width of the 
strips (W), the center-to-center spacing between adjacent strips (S), and the thick­
ness of the grids (t). The thickness of the grids is a trade-off between minimizing

where Sd is the skin depth of the conducting material. The value of T is about 
0.0003 in. for copper grids at Ku-band frequencies. The width of the strips W and 
the spacing between adjacent strips (S) are selected based on minimizing the inser­
tion loss and maximizing the cross-pol suppression. The spacing S depends on the 
highest frequency of operation and is determined using 20 strips per wavelength.

The insertion loss due to the grids is about 0.015 dB and cross-pol suppression 
is 38 dB. The parametric curves showing the loss versus W/S for various grid spac­
ings are given in Figure 2.23. The cross-polar suppression values as a function of 
W/S for various S/λ values are plotted in Figure 2.24. These plots are based on an 
analysis by Chan and Hyjazie [13]. In some cases, the industry uses identical grid 
configuration for the C- and Ku-bands in order to reduce cost and process-related 
issues. A compromise design with W = 0.012 in., S = 0.040 in., and T = 0.0003 
in. is used for both C-band and Ku-band FSS gridded reflectors. This particular 
design translates into S/λ values of 0.0125 at C-band and 0.048 at Ku-band. The 
loss values (signal leakage plus two-way loss) are 0.01 dB at C-band and 0.03 dB 
at Ku-band. The cross-polar suppression values are 46 dB at C-band and 38 dB at 
Ku-band.

2.3.1  Introduction
During the past decade, there has been a tremendous growth in the use of multiple-
beam antenna (MBA) technology for satellite payloads for both commercial and 
military communications. MBAs have been successfully used on several satellite 
applications, including:
••
Mobile satellites (M-Sat, Inmarsat, Thuraya, ACeS, MSV, Iridium, etc.).
••
Direct broadcast satellites (DTV-4S, Echostar-10, DTV-7S, Echostar-14, 
etc.).
••
Personal communication satellites (Anik-F, Viasat-1, Jupiter-1, etc.).
••
Military communication satellites (WGS, MUOS, DSCS, etc.).

Reflector Antennas for Space Communications
The need for MBA technology arises from the fact that it allows several-fold 
reuse of the limited frequency spectrum in order to increase the effective bandwidth 
of the communication payloads and hence the satellite capacity. A large number 
of overlapping high-gain spot beams are used over the desired coverage region 
from the satellite orbit instead of a single low-gain coverage beam. The available 
bandwidth is divided into a number of sub-bands and each of the sub-bands is 
reused over several spot beams that are spatially isolated within the desired cover­
age region on the ground as seen by the satellite. As a result, the effective spectrum 
is much larger than the available spectrum by a factor that is called the frequency 
reuse factor (FRF). The FRF depends on the number of beams and the number of 
sub-bands. If the sub-bands are all uniform, then the FRF is given simply as the 
ratio of number of beams used and the number of sub-bands. For nonuniform 
sub-bands and/or nonuniform layout of beams, the FRF is more precisely given by:

(2.18)
where i denotes the beam number in each sub-band j, and 
j
iF  denotes the band­
width associated with each beam within the sub-band. FRF is a function of the 
beam size, coverage region, and the number of sub-bands. Although theoretically 
the FRF could be a very large number, typical values for the FRF are in the range 
of 4 to 40 for communication satellites. The limiting factors for the FRF are often 
the spacecraft power limitations and the difficulty associated with accommodating 
several large reflector antennas on the spacecraft bus within the stowed volume of 
the launch vehicles 
Figure 2.27 illustrates the differences between conventional contoured beam 
coverage and multiple-beam coverage over the continental United States from a 
geostationary satellite. The contoured beam coverage shown in Figure 2.27(a) has 
a typical minimum coverage area directivity (without antenna losses) of about 30 
dBi and has no frequency reuse (FRF = 1). The contoured beam coverage is com­
monly achieved through the use of a single antenna—either a single off-set reflector 
or a dual-reflector offset antenna where the reflector(s) surface profiles are shaped 
in order to synthesize a beam whose contour matches with the desired coverage on 
ground. The multiple-beam coverage shown in Figure 2.27(b) employs 68 overlap­
ping spot beams to contiguously cover the CONUS. The beams are arranged in 
a hexagonal lattice with adjacent beam spacing of 0.52º and a beam diameter of 
0.6º at the triple-beam crossover point, defined as the crossover point of the three 
adjacent beams forming the equilateral triangle. The minimum coverage area di­
rectivity is 45 dBi, which is a 15 dB improvement (31.6 times more power) over the 
conventional antenna design. In addition, the MBA offers a significant increase in 
the spectral utilization. FRF values of about 22.67, 17, and 9.71 could be achieved 
with three-cell, four-cell, and seven-cell reuse schemes, respectively. 
The main advantages of using an MBA instead of contoured beam antenna are 
as follows:

2.3  Multiple-Beam Antennas 
41
••
A significant increase in antenna gain results from the use of smaller spot 
beams. This in turn increases EIRP on the downlink and increases G/T on 
the uplink.
••
The effective spectral bandwidth increases by several-fold due to reuse of the 
frequency channels (sub-bands) over several spot beams.
••
Much smaller ground terminals can be used to communicate with the 
satellite.
Apart from these advantages, it also offers satellite operators the ability to 
provide a significant capacity increase to their users. This is equivalent to a single 
satellite launch instead of several satellite launches, which provides significant cost 
savings.

Reflector Antennas for Space Communications
The coverage region for most applications needs to be contiguously covered by 
the satellite with multiple spot beams. A hexagonal grid layout is usually preferred 
due to the need for tight packing of the beams. The optimum beam diameter for 
a circular coverage region with uniformly sized beams, the total number of beams 
required for the coverage region, and the adjacent beam spacing are given approxi­
mately as:

deg and the beam diameter at triple-beam crossover is 2.0 deg. Table 2.3 shows the 
design variables for a global coverage with a 17.6-deg diameter.
2.3.2  Frequency Reuse Schemes 
Various frequency reuse schemes could be used for MBAs. These include regular 
three-cell, four-cell, seven-cell, or N-cell and also hybrid schemes that employ dif­
ferent schemes over different regions of the coverage region. The generic N-cell 
frequency reuse scheme involves repeating the frequency cell in a regular pattern 
such that any particular frequency cell has all of the beams repeated with uniform 
spacing. There is also a nonuniform cell reuse method that is more appropriate for 
direct broadcast satellite (DBS) applications, which will be discussed later. Figures 
2.29, 2.30, and 2.31 illustrate various reuse schemes and the number of apertures 
needed. The left side of these figures denotes the beam layout on the ground, the 
Arabic letters in these beams denote the frequency cell, and the Roman numbers 
denote the aperture number used for these beams. The apertures are mostly imple­
mented as reflectors, but also as lenses in certain applications. Multiple beams are 
implemented either using a single aperture or multiple apertures depending on the 
applications. The number of apertures in a multiaperture design depends on the size 
and stowage accommodation on the spacecraft bus.
The nonuniform cell reuse and hybrid cell reuse schemes are used primarily 
for DBS services and in certain cases for personal communication satellite (PCS) 
services. For DBS satellites, the satellite provides downlink beams for local channel 
broadcast where the designated market areas (DMAs) are nonuniform in size and 
spacing. One or more channels serve each beam that covers few DMAs.
Figure 2.32 shows typical coverage of the CONUS using nonuniform beams 
with nonuniform cell reuse. Smaller beams with higher gain are used in the East 
Coast beams, whereas large beams are used in the Midwest and in Western beams 
where the rain rate is low. Thirty-four beams cover the CONUS area with more

than 200 DMAs. The contour levels shown are in EIRP. The beam spacings among 
the reuse beams are designed to meet the copolar isolation C/I of better than 13 dB 
for most cases. The design employs multiple reflectors in which each reflector is fed 
with multiple feeds of nonuniform size and with nonuniform spacing in order to 
achieve various beam sizes.
The design challenge here is to cover the majority of DMAS with fewer beams, 
allocate DMAs and frequency channels to the individual beams, allocate beams to 
the reflectors, maximize the copolar isolation among beams re-using the same fre­
quency channels, maximize the cross-polar isolation, allocate beams to the ground 
hubs, and to maximize the frequency re-use factor. Other challenges invovle selec­
tion of beam sizes and spacing among re-use beams for the non-uniform beam 
layout over the coverage region.

In contrast, hybrid cell reuse for PCS services employs a uniform beam layout 
over the coverage region, but uses more channels on the beams requiring higher 
capacity/bandwidth and fewer channels requiring lower capacity in order to best 
utilize the available spectrum [14]. This is illustrated in Figure 2.33 where there 
are 46 beams covering the CONUS from the 105°W orbital slot. The letters within

each beam denote the frequency cells. The densely populated East Coast beams of 
the CONUS are covered with close to three- or four-cell reuse, while the sparsely 
populated Midwest and Western region beams employ higher cell reuse such as 
seven or more. It employs eight ground hubs, providing a frequency reuse factor 
of about 13.
One advantage of this design is that the satellite capacity is weighted based 
on the population density or operator’s requirement and is not wasted in coverage 
regions with low population density. The East Coast and some of the West Coast 
beams that cover high population density areas use a large number of cells in each 
beam and Midwest beams employ one or two cells in each beam.

2.3  Multiple-Beam Antennas

••
Direct radiating array with passive beam-forming network;
••
Phased-array antenna.
The use of a nonfocusing aperture such as a concave hyperboloid with feed lo­
cated at the imaginary focal point has been explored by Ingerson [15]. Large mag­
nification factor (M) values of greater than 20 are required for practical systems 
combined with large feed horns. The gain of this imaging system is dictated by M 
and the feed gain, but is generally independent of the reflector size. Disadvantages 
of this design are limited scan, higher sidelobe levels with scan, and significantly 
lower gain than parabolic reflectors. This antenna is not suitable for MBA applica­
tions and hence not utilized on practical systems.
The lens antennas have been employed in the past in a DSCS military program 
employing waveguide lenses. A number of waveguides are densely packed to form 
the lens and each waveguide length is varied to create a uniform phase front at 
the radiating side of the lens. Dielectric lenses have also been considered in the 
past. The main difficulty with these thick lenses is the large mass associated with 
them. Zoning techniques have been employed to minimize the mass, but the zon­
ing drastically reduces the bandwidth capability of the lens antenna [16]. Dielectric 
lenses are not considered suitable or space applications because of the electrostatic 
discharge (ESD) associated with the dielectrics where surface and bulk charges 
could be developed over the lifetime of the satellite causing multipaction or power 
breakdown of the payloads. Waveguide and dielectric lenses have fallen out of 
favor recently due to their increased mass, limited bandwidth, accommodation is­
sues on the spacecraft, poor return loss, and environmental issues such as ESD and 
power handling.
Direct radiating arrays with passive BFNs are employed when the number of 
beams is limited and the beams are fixed on ground. On the other hand, phased-
array antennas are being employed for space applications requiring agile beams 
on ground, global coverage, and anti-jamming capability. For commercial satellite 
applications, reflector MBAs are preferred and most widely used due to their lower 
mass, lower cost, higher gain, lower losses, mature technology, and simpler accom­
modation and less power dissipation on the spacecraft.
Single-reflector MBAs are used primarily at low frequencies such as UHF, L-
band, and S-band. At these frequency bands, large deployable mesh reflectors rang­
ing from 5 to 22m have been successfully used for mobile satellite communica­
tions such as Thuraya, ACeS, Inmarsat, MSV, SkyTerra, and most recently MUOS. 
Single-reflector MBAs can be implemented using a single feed per beam or multiple 
feeds per beam (referred to as the enhanced feed concept).
A single-feed-per-beam MBA with a single reflector is simpler in terms of hard­
ware since it does not require a beam-forming network. However, the element size 
required is small and is typically of the order of a wavelength in order to achieve 
good overlap of about 3 to 4 dB below the beam peak among the adjacent beams. 
The feed spacing/size depends on the F/D ratio of the reflector and is given ap­
proximately as:

Reflector Antennas for Space Communications
For large deployable reflectors, the F/D ratio is around 0.6 to 0.7 and the feed 
spacing is around 0.75 to 0.88λ to achieve the desired overlap among adjacent 
beams. Figure 2.34 shows typical performance of the MBA as a function of feed 
spacing/size. For a single-reflector MBA with small spacing of about 0.8λ, the beam 
overlap is very good (less than 3 dB) but the beam efficiency is very low at about 
45% and suffers from high sidelobe levels of about 19 dB (below the beam peak). 
On the other hand, a multiaperture MBA with four reflectors provides alternate 
beams from the same reflectors, allowing the feed horn spacing/size to increase 
twice as much compared to a single-aperture MBA. This combined with the large 
F/D of about 1.0 allows for feed spacings in the range of 2.0 to 3.0λ. For such large 
horns, each reflector will be illuminated more optimally with a taper of about 10 
to 15 dB, increasing the antenna efficiency to about 78% and lowering the sidelobe 
levels to about 25 dB. Beam overlap is better than 17 dB among the beams gener­
ated from the same reflector, allowing reuse of the same frequency for all of the 
beams.
Because of the low efficiency and high sidelobe levels of a single-feed-per–beam 
system, single-reflector MBAs employ feed clusters that typically use seven horns 
per beam. This is called the enhanced feed concept [17], in which adjacent beam 
centers correspond to the feed horn centers, but each beam is broadened and illu­
minated more efficiently due to the use of the feed cluster. This concept is illustrat­
ed in Figure 2.35 where the basic feed concept employs seven horns to illuminate a 
reflector and produces seven beams in the far field. In the enhanced feed concept, 
19 feed horns are used with the reflector to generate seven optimal beams that are 
larger than the element beams. Each beam is generated using seven horns and pro­
duces an optimal illumination on the reflector. Therefore, the composite beams of 
the MBA are larger than the element beams with higher gain (or efficiency), lower 
sidelobe levels, and improved overlap among the beams.
The beam layout of the two concepts is illustrated in Figure 2.36. The beams 
use with the enhanced feed concept are larger than those used with the single-feed 
concept and there is better overlap among the beams. A single large offset reflector

being fed with multiple feeds and combined through a matrix power amplifier and 
low-level beam-forming network is typically used for generating multiple overlap­
ping beams over the desired coverage regions.
Figure 2.37 is a block diagram of the MBA using a single reflector antenna. 
The Tx MBA shown in Figure 2.37 employs a low-level dividing network that 
distributes the individual RF signals from each beam to a number of output ports 
that are eventually connected to a number of feed elements within the large feed 
array through the matrix power amplifier (MPA) network. The reason for using an 
MPA is for distributed amplification where each amplifier is shared among mul­
tiple beams and for redundancy in case of amplifier failures. The MPA comprises 
an input hybrid matrix (IHM), power amplifiers, and an output hybrid matrix 
(OHM), which is connected to bandpass filters and the radiating elements of the 
feed array. The feed elements illuminate an offset, parabolic mesh reflector provid­
ing multiple overlapping beams on the ground, as illustrated earlier in Figure 2.28.
Single-reflector MBAs also employ diplexed antennas serving both Tx and Rx 
functions as illustrated in Figure 2.38. The antenna is common to both uplink 
and downlink frequencies. The diplexers behind each element separate the two 
frequency bands, thus providing the necessary isolation. The Tx path employs the 
MPA approach as discussed above, and the Rx path employs LNAs behind each 
diplexer and a low-level BFN for combining a number of closely placed element 
signals into a number of overlapping beams. The Rx path could also use the MPA 
approach for LNA redundancy followed by the low-level beam-forming network. 
The challenge in this approach is to realize the diplexer with large isolation of the 
Tx frequencies in the Rx path in order to minimize the PIM levels. However, the 
diplexed design has significant cost and mass advantages compared to the use of 
separate Tx and Rx antennas.

2.3.4  Design and Analysis of Multiple-Beam Reflector Antennas
The design and relevant analysis of reflector antennas for multiple-beam applica­
tions are discussed in this section. Key design objectives for the MBAs are:
••
Maximize the minimum gain over the spot beam coverage;
••
Maximize the copolar isolation (C/I);
••
Maximize the cross-polar isolation;
••
Minimize the scan loss.
These objectives can be met closely by making the proper design choices for the 
MBA’s reflector and feed systems. A single-reflector antenna with a single feed per 
beam requires small horns (about 1 wavelength in diameter) in order to achieve 
high adjacent beam overlap. This results in a low illumination taper on the reflector 
and increased spillover losses. As a result, the gain values are about 2 to 3 dB lower 
than what could be achieved with a larger horn with optimal illumination. A single-
reflector MBA with overlapping feed clusters improves the gain values, but requires 
a low-level beam-forming network to provide the element sharing among a number 
of beams (typically three or seven) and beam-combining functions. 
Multiple reflector design with a single feed per beam employs either three or 
four reflectors on the practical systems used on commercial satellites. These reflec­
tors can easily be deployed to the east and west sides of the spacecraft leaving the 
nadir deck for other antennas for FSS/BSS and global horns and telemetry, track­
ing, and control (TT&C) antennas. Adjacent beams are generated from different 
apertures, as shown earlier in Figures 2.30 and 2.31, forming interleaved but con­
tiguous spot beam coverage on the ground. The closest spacing between adjacent

beams from the same aperture can be increased from θs to 1.732 θs for a three-re­
flector MBA, and to 2.0 θs for a four-reflector MBA, where θs is the center-to-center 
spacing between adjacent beams of the multiple-beam coverage. The larger beam 
spacing that accompanies the use of multiple reflectors allows for a proportionate 
increase in the horn size, which in turn improves the antenna gain through reduced 
spillover losses and more optimal illumination taper on the reflector. 
The following analysis is generic to single- as well as multiple-reflector MBAs. 
The design of and performance analysis of reflector MBAs is quite tedious. Several 
iterations are required when designing the feeds, analyzing the primary patterns, 
and computing the radiation patterns for the reflector antennas for all beams using 
the physical optics (PO) method of integrating the surface currents on the reflec­
tor surface, and then performing the minimum coverage directivity and the C/I 
evaluation for each beam. This process has to be repeated for each iteration and 
it takes several weeks to arrive at an optimal MBA design. Rao [18, 19] presented 
a simplified design and analysis method for the multiple-beam reflector antennas 
that requires only a few minutes to arrive at an optimal design and performance 
evaluation. The design and analysis are based on approximating the primary and 
secondary patterns using either Gaussian or non-Gaussian beams and deriving sim­
plified equations for the reflector MBA. This method gives results that are in close 
agreement with the tedious PO method and provides a good starting solution. The 
PO method can then be used for the final performance evaluation of the MBA. 
In addition, this analysis can be applied to the antenna performance analysis of 
shaped or contoured beams.
MBA design depends on the beam size, which is related to the minimum cov­
erage area directivity requirement. Other key design objectives include minimum 
scan loss over the coverage, maximum copolar isolation among beams that reuse 
the same frequency, and maximum cross-polar isolation. For MBAs with uniform 
size beams arranged in a hexagonal grid, the minimum directivity occurs at the 
triple beam crossover point of the three adjacent beams as shown in Figure 2.39. 
Typical beam overlaps used for practical MBAs are 3 dB for two adjacent beams

lar parameters for RF analysis 

2.3  Multiple-Beam Antennas 
53
and 4 dB for a three-beam overlap. The optimum overlap depends on the minimum 
coverage gain, required copolar isolation (C/I) among reuse beams, and the fre­
quency reuse scheme (three-cell, four-cell, etc.) of the beam overlap; however, there 
is a trade-off between achieving the maximum coverage gain and maximizing the 
C/I among the reuse beams. The spacing between adjacent beam centers determines 
the number of beams for a given coverage and also the maximum feed size that 
could be used for the reflectors. For the hexagonal grid layout of the beams shown 
in Figure 2.39, θs is given as:
	
q

(2.24)
where Ca is the coverage area in square degrees and the denominator represents the 
area of the hexagonal cell associated with each beam. The coverage area includes 
the expanded coverage with the radial pointing error associated with the station 
keeping of the satellite. The actual number of beams NA is typically 15% to 20% 
larger than Nmin for an efficient layout of the beams over the coverage such that the 
triple-beam crossover levels for outer beams occur at the edge of the coverage edge. 
For a three-reflector (using a three-cell reuse scheme) and a four-reflector (using a 
four-cell reuse scheme) antenna system, the closest spacing between beam centers 
reusing the same frequency are given respectively as:

The closest spacing between the reuse beam edges, θr determines the achiev­

parameter of the MBA is the feed size and feed design. The optimum adjacent feed

angle of the beam to the physical displacement of the feed from the focal point of 
the reflector. The scan factor is related to the reflector geometry shown in Figure

MBA Performance Analysis
This section presents the relevant analysis for evaluating the RF performance of 
reflector MBAs in terms of minimum coverage area directivity and the copolar 
isolation (C/I), which are the two critical parameters that define the overall MBA 
performance. The analysis is generic in nature and can be used for multiaperture or 
single-aperture MBAs.

level (+ve dB) below the peak directivity. Equation (2.39) gives a more accurate 
prediction than the conventional method of using the gain-area product (GAP) 
that antenna designers employ. The GAP-based method does not take into account 
several key parameters such as the reflector size and geometry, feed illumination, 
and the beam scan. The variable ηf in (2.39) is the overall antenna efficiency and is

The maximum value of feed efficiency ηf  is about 0.81 and occurs when the 
feed illumination taper T is about 10 dB. Figure 2.41 shows the computed antenna 
efficiency as a function of illumination taper T. The parameter of the curve is the 
half-subtended angle of the reflector θ1.The results show that a smaller θ1 (in other 
words, a larger F/D ratio of the reflector) results in better gain performance for 
the MBA. Typical values of F/D for reflector antennas used for space application 
range from 0.8 to 1.4 and the choice is often dictated by the reflector size, cover­
age region, launch fairing envelope, and accommodation on the spacecraft. The 
reflectors are typically deployed along the east and west sides on the spacecraft 
body once the satellite is in orbit and are stowed against the spacecraft body dur­
ing launch. An exemplary sketch of the MBA in the deployed views is illustrated 
earlier in Figure 2.2.
Copolar Isolation (C/I) Analysis
The copolar isolation of the downlink antenna is defined as the ratio of the copolar

The dominant interference is from the three closest interferers I1, I2, and I6 (see 
Figure 2.42) and is assumed to be from the skirt of the main-beam patterns of the 
interfering beams. This assumption is valid for most of the practical applications 
with either a three- or four-cell frequency reuse scheme. The impact of sidelobes 
and coma-lobes due to scan is not considered here, because the levels are very low 
(of the order of -25 dB relative to peak) and do not significantly impact the copolar 
isolation values. It is to be noted that (2.43) is valid for most practical F/D values 
in the range of 0.6 to 2.0.

The MBA analysis results shown above are compared with the rigorous simula­
tions using PO reflector analysis. Three antenna cases are compared.
Case 1 is a 56-beam MBA with four reflectors that uses a four-cell frequency 
reuse scheme. The beam is unscanned (δ=0) and the antenna parameters are D/λ = 
106.9, F/D = 1.324, h/λ = 50.31, θ0 = 0.545°, and θs = 0.472°. Using the Gaussian 
beam analysis given in this section, the various design parameters are calculated as

are 49.22 and 46.68 dBi, respectively. The computed directivity values using PO

integration of surface currents on the reflector antenna are 49.11 dBi (peak) and 
46.54 dBi (EOC). The C/I value using the six closest interferers is calculated as 12.0 
dB while the computed value using PO is obtained as 12.5 dB.
Case 2 is the same as Case 1, except that the beam is scanned to 1.666° (δ=2.81) 
from the antenna boresight direction. The feed design parameters are same as Case 
1, and the beam parameters are calculated as θ3(δ) = 0.619° and B = 2.33 dB. The 
improved beam overlap relative to Case 1 is due to a beam-broadening effect with 
scan. The peak directivity, EOC directivity, and C/I (using the three closest interfer­
ers) values are 48.84 dBi, 46.51 dBi, and 13.49 dB, respectively, and the computed 
values are 49.01 dBi, 46.45 dBi, and 13.03 dB, respectively. 
Case 3 is a 24-beam MBA with four reflectors and a four-cell reuse scheme. 
The antenna parameters are D/λ = 79.32, F/D = 1.667, h/λ = 39.66, θ0 = 1.07°, and 
θs = 0.923°. Design parameters are calculated as l =  4.45,
m
d
 T = 13.0 dB, n = 159, ηf 
= 0.802, θ3 = 0.862°, and B = 4.62 dB. This design example employs a larger beam 
overlap to improve C/I. The calculated values for peak directivity, EOC directivity, 
and C/I (with the six closest interferers) are 46.97 dBi, 42.33 dBi, and 21.2 dB, 
while the respective values using rigorous PO computations are 46.70 dBi, 41.92 
dBi, and 19.8 dB. The calculated values agree well with rigorous computations for 
all cases and the Gaussian beam analysis could be used for rapid analysis of design 
trade-offs for practical MBA systems.
Extension to Shaped Beams
The above analysis for MBAs can easily be extended to shaped or contoured beam 
antennas. This type of analysis is more accurate than using the GAP estimates. The 
GAP varies for shaped beams in the range of 6,000 to 25,000 depending on the size 
of the reflector and the extent of shaping. The GAP estimates are very approximate 
since they do not take into account the reflector size, offset clearance, feed illumina­
tion, and so forth. Using the analysis shown in the preceding section, the minimum 
coverage area directivity, Dmin, can be estimated as follows:

where CA is the coverage area of the shaped beam in square degrees, θM is the pencil 
beam beamwidth at M dB below the beam peak directivity (M is typically 4 for 
shaped beam designs), and GL(δm) is the gain loss at a maximum scan angle of δm. 
The maximum scan angle δm is given by the coverage requirements and depends on 
the actual coverage as seen by the satellite and the antenna boresight direction. The 
variable θM is related to the 3-dB full beamwidth θ3 by

The shaped beam example (Case 4) is the contoured beam coverage over South 
America. Antenna parameters for this design are D/λ = 28.45, F/D = 0.824, h/λ = 
3.18, T = 14 dB, M = 4, and CA = 23.7 square degrees. The design parameters are 
calculated as θ3 = 2.43° and GL = 0.45 dB. The calculated minimum coverage area 
directivity using the analysis shown is 27.66 dBi, while the computed value using 
the PO method is 27.6 dBi. Another example (Case 5) is a wide area coverage 
semiglobal beam with antenna parameters as follows: D/λ = 29, F/Dp = 0.3125, T 
= 13 dB, M = 4, and CA = 79.7 square degrees. Design parameters are calculated 
as θ3 = 2.383°, GL = 1.57 dB, and ηf = 0.79. The calculated and PO computed 
minimum directivity values are 21.33 and 21.70 dBi, respectively. The extension of 
MBA analysis to shaped beams predicts the minimum coverage directivity values 
within 0.4 dB of the PO computations. The comparison results of the Gaussian-
type analysis with PO computations is given in Table 2.4 for MBA and shaped 
beam antennas. 
The analysis method based on the Gaussian beam model is useful for quick 
analysis and design of MBAs without the need for time-intensive computations 
and iterations using reflector analysis software. This method gives results close to 
computations for moderate beam scans and is quite useful for initial design, design 
trade-offs, and performance evaluation of MBAs. It is widely used in the satellite 
industry by several companies. Extension of this analysis to shaped beams gives 
directivity predictions that are close to computed results. 
Parametric Analysis of MBAs
The analysis shown in the preceding sections was later generalized [19] using a 
parametric design that includes feed efficiency and satellite pointing error as vari­
ables. For the reflector MBAs, the feed design is most important in dictating the RF 
performance. Corrugated horns were used in earlier designs, but suffer from low 
aperture efficiency of about 55% due to the thick walls needed for implementing 
the corrugations and, as a result, the effective aperture area is much less than the 
physical area. Potter horns have also been used in multibeam satellites with moder­
ate aperture efficiency of about 74%. High-efficiency horns with aperture efficien­
cies of about 93% have been realized in the recent past [25–28]. The feed efficiency 
is a key parameter for optimizing MBA performance parameters. The half-angle of 
the 3-dB beamwidth of the horn is given by:

where h is the efficiency of the feed horn. The above equation works well for ef­
ficiency values in the range of 70% to 95%. Computed radiation patterns for three 
different horn designs with varying efficiency values for a 3.07λ-diameter multi­
mode circular horn are shown in Figure 2.43. The copolar and cross-polar patterns 
are shown in the 45-deg plane. On-axis directivity values are 18.19, 18.72, and 
19.21 dBi for Potter, medium-efficiency, and high-efficiency horns, respectively. The 
feed illumination taper T values at the reflector edge at 20.95 deg can be calculated 
using (2.34) and are 9.2, 10.3, and 12.4 dB, respectively, for the Potter, medium-
efficiency, and high-efficiency horns. The higher edge illumination taper achieved 
for the high-efficiency horn designs will illuminate the reflector more optimally and 
results in higher EOC gain and improved C/I for the MBA. 
The secondary patterns of the MBA can be analyzed more accurately using a 
quasi-Gaussian beam analysis whereby the main beam is represented as a Gauss­
ian beam, the first sidelobe region represented at a constant level, and the sidelobe 
region beyond the first sidelobe is represented with a slope of –6-dB per octave. The 
pattern shape is also a function of the horn efficiency value. The secondary pattern 
in decibels is given by [19]:

where D is the projected aperture of the reflector and T is the illumination taper

Figure 2.44 for SL = –25dB. The analytical model agrees closely with the com­puted 
patterns in terms of half-power beamwidth and the location of the first null. The 
above equations are valid for feeds located close to the focal point of the reflector 
(or for beams close to the antenna’s boresight). As the beams are scanned away 
from the antenna’s boresight, the main impacts on antenna radiation are that the 
main beam broadens, the antenna gain deteriorates due to scan­ning losses, and the 
sidelobe levels increase due to coma-lobes. All three effects due to scanning are in­
cluded in the analysis by modifying the above equations as follows [18, 20]:

Figure 2.45 compares the computed normalized radiation patterns of a 65-in.-
diameter parabolic reflector using the three horn designs (Potter, medium-efficien­
cy, and high-efficiency horns) shown in Figure 2.43. It can be seen that the high-
efficiency horn gives broader patterns and lower sidelobe levels. This results in 
improved copolar isolation due to the fact that the interferers are mostly in the 
sidelobe region.
The electrical performance of the multiple-beam antenna, in terms of the beam 
directivity and copolar isolation (C/I), is analyzed using the following equations 
developed in this section.
The beam layout including the pointing error is shown in Figure 2.46. The 
minimum coverage area directivity, taking into account the pointing error (∆θP), is 
given by [18]:

scan angle, the third term is the peak-to-edge variation for the maximum scanned 
beam, and the last term is the directivity loss due to the pointing error. The antenna 
efficiency, ηi, is a function of the feed efficiency, ηf. A Potter horn has a lower taper 
on the reflector, but has very low spillover loss due to lower sidelobes. The high-
efficiency horn, on the other hand, has higher taper on the reflector and high spill­
over loss (the sidelobe levels are around 19 dB below peak). The overall antenna 
efficiency, ηi, is a function of the illumination taper, the reflector geometry, and the 
feed efficiency, and is given by:

The copolar isolation (C/I) for the downlink antenna is usu­ally more critical 
than for the uplink antenna, and is defined as the ratio of the copolar directivity 
of the beam of interest to the combined directivity interference obtained by adding 
all of the interferers, in power, over the beam of interest. Note that the cross-polar 
levels are not included in this analysis, due to the fact that the total interference is 
dominated by the copolar signals from the adjacent beams reusing the same fre­
quency. Self cross-polar inter­ference can be almost neglected in most cases. The cell 
area of the beam needs to be expanded with the circular pointing error in order to 
compute the worst-case value. (Also, implementation margins necessary to account 
for the reflector-surface distortions and range uncertainties need to be added to all 
interferers to compute the copolar isolation of spacecraft antennas, which are not 
included here.) The combined interference signal due to J interferers onto the beam 
of interest is given by [19]:

Computed C/I results for a four-aperture MBA with D/λ = 100, F/D = 1.138, h/ 
λ = 41.4, and feed diameter d/ λ = 3.01 using the parametric analysis shown above 
are given below. Three feed horn designs are used in these calculations: (1) Potter 
horn with 74% efficiency, (2) medium-efficiency multimode horn with 83% effi­
ciency, and (3) high-efficiency horn with 93% efficiency. Figures 2.47 and 2.48, re­
spectively, show aggregate C/I calculated for a four-cell and a seven-cell frequency 
reuse system. The copolar isolation values shown are the aggregate values where 
all the copolar interferers are added in power and include a ±0.05° pointing error 
due to the satellite. The nonmonotonic behavior of the copolar isolation with scan 
is due to the beam-broadening effect causing the interference signals to shift from 
the sidelobe region to the main beam roll-off region of the copolar beam and also 
due to the presence of coma-lobes. For the four-cell and seven-cell reuse schemes, 
the high-efficiency horn gives about a 1.5 to 2.5 dB improvement relative to the 
Potter horn, respectively, for moderate scans. For a seven-cell reuse scheme, a high-
efficiency horn gives better RF performance, and for a four-cell scheme, either a 
high- or medium-efficiency horn could be used. For a three-cell reuse scheme, the 
Potter horn gives better overall performance of the MBA.

2.3.5  Multiple-Beam Antenna Design Examples for Various Satellite Services
This section provides a few design examples of satellite antennas for multiple-beam 
applications for PCS and DBS services. The evolution of reflector MBA technology 
is illustrated in Figure 2.49. Configuration A is the conventional reflector MBA for 
personal communication satellites that employs a separate set of reflectors for up­
link and downlink beams. Each set comprises four reflectors where alternate beams 
are generated using multiple feeds from the same reflector. The uplink reflectors are 
about 1.5 times smaller than the downlink reflectors. The disadvantage with this 
configuration is that it requires eight reflectors that need to be accommodated and 
deployed on the spacecraft bus, which restricts the size of the reflectors and hence 
the size of the beam. 
Configuration B employs dual-band reflector antennas being fed with corru­
gated horns in order to reduce the number of apertures by half, for example, from 8 
to 4. This is a great advantage in accommodating larger reflectors on the spacecraft 
and, hence, the ability to create smaller beams with higher gain performance. Cor­
rugated horns are used to cover the larger bandwidth of greater than 50% needed 
to support both uplink and downlink beams. However, this suffers from lower per­
formance due to low efficiency of about 54% for the corrugated horns due to the 
thick walls needed for corrugations (larger than a quarter wavelength at the lowest 
frequency of both bands). In addition, it adds mass to the feed assemblies, which 
is also of prime concern for satellite antennas. The dual-band MBA (DMBA) con­
figuration C overcomes the above limitations by employing smooth-walled high-
efficiency horns that support both uplink and downlink frequency bands [25–28].
A novel dual-band MBA using stepped-reflector technology combined with 
smooth-walled high-efficiency horns has been developed in the recent past [29, 30]. 
The concept is illustrated in Figure 2.50 and is shown as configuration D in Figure 
2.49. It combines the feed horn advancements with stepped-reflector technology 
in order to achieve significant performance improvements for future MBAs for 
personal communication satellites. The reflector size is dictated by the downlink 
frequency band and is typically oversized for the uplink band. The uplink beams 
using the same reflector as the downlink are about 33% smaller than the downlink 
beams. The step or steps over optimized annular regions are designed to broaden

the uplink beams by creating a 180-deg phase reversal using steps that gradually 
blend into the reflector shape avoiding abrupt shape changes. Since the step heights 
are designed about quarter-wave at the uplink band, the impact on the downlink 
beam is minimal. The concept and detailed results of stepped-reflector technology 
have been presented in [29, 30]. 
The high-efficiency “smooth-walled” horns were initially developed for single 
narrowband applications where the desired higher order modes are generated by 
step junctions or discontinuities. To achieve high-efficiency values over both the 
downlink (transmit) and uplink (receive) frequency bands of the DMBA, a number 
of slope discontinuities have been used to generate higher order TE1,n modes [27]. 
Diverging-type slope discontinuities from throat to horn aperture are more suitable

for these applications rather than converging-type slopes because the latter have 
the disadvantage of trapped modes causing in-band resonances that are undesired 
for space applications.
The horn geometry is synthesized using iterative analysis that employs a mode-
matching technique combined with a generalized scattering matrix (GSM) approach 
to evaluate the RF performance and optimize the geometry. Desired requirements 
for the horn efficiency, return loss, and peak cross-polar levels can be specified over 
discrete frequencies covering both bands and minimizing the cost function using 
mini-max optimization. 
Figure 2.51 graphs the performance of a 2.27 in. diameter, high-efficiency horn 
compared with a conventional corrugated horn at the K- and Ka-bands. A dual-
band reflector performance has been analyzed using both types of horns and an 
80 in. reflector diameter with a focal length of 116 in. and an offset clearance of 
26 in. The reflector surface is shaped to broaden the Rx beams at the Ka-band for 
both cases. Table 2.5 summarizes a performance comparison of DMBA with both 
types of horns. The DBHEH, when compared to a corrugated horn, improves EOC 
gain by about 0.9 dB at Tx frequencies and by about 2.0 dB at Rx frequencies, 
and improves C/I by about 3.0 dB. DMBA configuration D combines reflector 
improvements through the use of stepped-reflector antenna (SRA) technology with 
horn improvements to further improve DMBA performance. A single step is suf­
ficient for most applications, but multiple steps can be employed for tri-band or 
quad-band applications. Both central and annular stepped regions can be shaped to 
improve the RF performance, and the transition region can be blended into the re­
flector to avoid abrupt discontinuities. The height h of the step needs to be designed 
in conjunction with the feed phase characteristics at the Rx frequencies in order to

provide a 180-deg phase reversal at the step, resulting in a “flat-topped” Rx beam 
with significantly improved gain and hence G/T. The step height is given by:
	
l
≤
4
rm
h
	
(2.72)
where lrm is the wavelength at the center frequency of the Rx band. At 30 GHz, the 
step height h is less than 0.1 in. and can be easily blended with the reflector shape 
over a small region with gradual shaping. The near-field phase distribution of the 
SRA at Rx frequency is shown in Figure 2.52, which also shows the desired 180-
deg phase reversal near the transition region of the step. As a result, the Rx beam 
patterns of the SRA shown in Figure 2.53 have flat-topped patterns with increased 
EOC gain. The Rx beam EOC gain improvement is about 2.0 dB relative to con­
figuration B and about 1.2 dB relative to configuration C. By combining the feed 
phase quadratic variation with the phase variation due to the step, the step size can 
be minimized. The SRA for dual-band and multiband applications works well over 
wide coverage regions with large scan angles. The Tx and the Rx beam patterns of 
a dual-band MBA are shown in Figures 2.54 and 2.55, respectively. The edge of the 
beam gains over the scan region are improved at both Tx and Rx bands relative to 
conventional MBAs.
The BSS satellites for local-channel broadcast over the CONUS area are re­
quired to provide coverage to most of the 212 designated market areas (DMAs) 
throughout the CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii using a multiple-beam spot beam 
payload. These payloads typically employ three or four reflectors for spot beam 
coverage and an additional reflector to provide national broadcasts using a con­
toured beam. An exemplary MBA using four reflectors (designated as NE, NW, 
SE, and SW) is used to create 45 spot beams over the CONUS, Alaska, and Ha­
waii. The beam layout is shown in Figure 2.56. Each reflector has about 10 to 
13 feed horns to create the desired spot beams where each beam is designed to

cover multiple DMAs. The design of these MBAs gets more complicated due to 
nonuniform beam size, nonuniform spacing among reuse beams, and the need for 
efficient use of the limited number of frequency channels. Design challenges include 
combination of DMAs per beam, frequency channels designated to beams, choice 
of beam diameters/horizons, maximizing the copolar isolation among beams us­
ing some frequency channels, and allocation of beams to the hubs on the ground.

In addition, the power allocated to each DMA varies. Therefore, 0/1 analysis has 
to be finally carried out and optimized at EIRP level for payload optimization at 
system level.

3.1  Introduction 
This chapter discusses past and recent developments on reflector antennas for 
terrestrial communications applications. Each of the sections describes reflector 
antennas for a specific application. Section 3.2 presents design technologies for 
beam-waveguide feed systems and practical examples in conjunction with large 
Earth station reflector antennas. The shaped Cassegrain antenna fed by a four-
reflector beam waveguide feed, which is a standard for large Earth stations all over 
the world, is described. Section 3.3 introduces a tri-reflector offset antenna for 
terrestrial microwave relay link systems. The reflector antenna is shown to achieve 
very low cross-polar levels. Reflector antennas used for Japanese Communication 
Satellite 2 (CS-2) are described in Section 3.4. The shape of the wavefront that cor­
responds to the desired beam cross section in the sense of geometrical optics is ana­
lyzed using the geometrical optics (GO) approach, and a method for synthesizing 
the wavefront is also discussed. The reflector shape is determined from the shape of 
the wavefront by the GO approach, which is adequate for this application.
Section 3.5 presents the elliptical aperture antenna used for satellite news gath­
ering. The antenna is an offset Gregorian antenna with an elliptical main reflec­
tor. The elliptical aperture is used to reduce the interference from or to adjacent 
satellites. Section 3.6 describes a reflector antenna with an elliptical aperture for 
aeronautical satellite communication systems. The elliptical aperture realizes a very 
low profile antenna under severe envelope constraints on the airplane. The dual-
shaped reflector antenna is realized by using physical optics shaping techniques 
and achieves excellent electric performance. Section 3.7 introduces a compact re­
flector antenna for the mobile satellite communications used by vessels. For this 
type of system, the antenna needs to be designed to achieve low sidelobe and low

cross-polar characteristics while maintaining high antenna efficiency. Section 3.8 
discusses the type of reflector antenna used for simultaneous reception from broad­
cast satellites (BS) and communication satellites (CS). The optimum reflector for 
a single-reflector type wide beam-spacing multibeam antenna is presented on the 
basis of wave aberration analysis of a defocus-fed reflector. A novel shaped reflec­
tor antenna for base station applications is described in Section 3.9. The antenna 
radiator vertically shaped six-sector beams simultaneously. 
3.2  Large Earth Station Reflector Antenna
Japanese reflector antenna technologies have contributed tremendously to the pop­
ularization and advancement of satellite communication systems. In particular, the 
shaped Cassegrain antenna, fed by a four-reflector beam waveguide feed, is sym­
bolic of the standard reflector antenna for large Earth stations all over the world.
The Cassegrain antenna is a dual-reflector antenna derived from the Cassegrain 
optical telescope [1]. The fundamental Cassegrain antenna uses a paraboloidal re­
flector for the main reflector and a small hyperboloidal reflector for the subreflec­
tor. This antenna has three advantages when applied as an Earth station antenna:
1.	 The radiation characteristics of the Cassegrain antenna become equal to 
those of an equivalent parabolic antenna, the aperture angle of which is 
the same as the radiating angle of the primary feed horn of the Cassegrain 
antenna. Accordingly, the Cassegrain antenna has good radiation charac­
teristics because of the equivalently long focal length and small effects of 
aberrations.
2.	 The insertion loss between a primary feed horn and a receiver/transmitter 
is small, because the primary horn can be located at the vertex of the main 
reflector.
3.	 The noise temperature becomes smaller than that of the parabolic antenna 
because the large spillover of the subreflector points toward the cold sky 
instead of the hot Earth.
The design method and main performance characteristics of large Earth sta­
tion reflector antennas for satellite communications are described in the following 
sections.
3.2.1  Design Method
3.2.1.1  Beam-Waveguide Feed Systems
The four-reflector beam waveguide can obtain a symmetrical beam for Cassegrain 
antennas using an asymmetrically shaped beam-waveguide system [2, 3]. Figure 
3.1 shows a model antenna fed by the four-reflector beam waveguide. This beam 
waveguide consists of two curved reflectors, two plane reflectors, and a horn. The 
broken lines in Figure 3.1 show image rays due to the plane reflectors. This analy­
sis is only applicable for two curved reflectors. These reflectors are assumed to be 
quadric surfaces of revolution.

First, we discuss the relation of rays in one reflector. The incident conical rays 
from focus Fn, as shown in Figure 3.2, are reflected by the reflector, Mn, and changed 
into the different conical rays focused on Fn+1. The conical rays are expressed by 
the unit vector of the center axis, vn, and the cone angle, θn. The incident and re­
flected rays are described by the subscripts n and n + 1, respectively. The relation­
ship between the incident and reflected rays can be obtained as follows:

In the two-reflector system, as shown in Figure 3.3, all conical rays from F1 are

from F3. Here, the unit vector of the center axes, v1, v2, and v3, and the cone angles,

The variables A and B are independent of θ1. Now, the unit vector v1 is as­
sumed to be constant, and the beam of the horn is assumed to be symmetric. The 
unit vector v3 for the conical rays from the reflector system should be independent 
of the cone angle θ1 for the incident conical rays, in order to make the beam from 
the reflector system symmetric. That is, the vector B in (3.4) should be as follows:

Finally, from (3.6) and (3.7), the conditions for obtaining a symmetric beam 
are described as follows:
1.	 The foci of the two reflectors should be arranged in a straight line.
2.	 The eccentricities of the two reflectors, e1 and e2, should be expressed by 
e2 = e1 or e2 = 1/e1. When these conditions are satisfied, the relationship 
between the conical rays radiating into and out of the reflector system is as

These equations mean that both the beams radiating into and out of the reflec­

respect to a straight line drawn through the focal points.

reflectors is restricted. The unit vector v2 must be arranged on the elevation axis, 
and the directions of the unit vectors v1 and v3 must be nearly 180 deg from each 
other. That is, from (3.9), the reflector system should consist of hyperboloidal and 
ellipsoidal reflectors. Only the four types of configurations shown in Figure 3.4 
can thus be selected from the many reflector systems satisfying the preceding con­
ditions. Figure 3.4(d) is equivalent to Figure 3.4(a) or 3.4(b) in the case where the 
focus F2 is at an infinite distance.
Multiple-reflector systems include beam-waveguide systems, since a series of 
quadric surfaces of revolution is reported to be equivalent to an offset parabola 
antenna in terms of geometrical optics [4]. A beam-mode expansion is also ap­
propriate in the analysis and design of beam waveguides [5–7]. The four-reflector 
waveguide can be designed not only to obtain a symmetric beam, but to also reduce

cross-polarization when the equivalent parabola of the series of quadric surfaces of 
revolution is chosen to be a symmetrical parabola.
To obtain a symmetrical beam, a corrugated conical-horn antenna is often used 
as a primary radiator. The corrugated conical-horn antenna consists of a corru­
gated waveguide instead of a normal waveguide [8–10]. The beam shape of this 
horn antenna becomes symmetrical due to the symmetrical hybrid EH11-mode 
aperture distribution. The corrugated horn also has the merit of having broadband 
frequency characteristics.
3.2.1.2  Reflector Shaping
Another important advantage of Cassegrain antennas over parabolic antennas is 
the reflector shaping technique, which is a slight modification of the reflector’s 
surface from a quadratic surface of revolution [11, 12]. When reflector shaping 
is used, the aperture-field distribution can be so tightly controlled that a trade-off 
becomes possible between the aperture efficiency and the sidelobe characteristics. 
For an axially symmetric dual-reflector antenna, a shaped-reflector synthesis based 
on geometrical optics can be carried out by solving a set of ordinary differential 
equations [13].
Figure 3.5 shows cross sections of a sample shaped Cassegrain antenna having 
a uniform aperture-amplitude distribution [13]. The nominal Cassegrain antenna 
has a tapered aperture-amplitude distribution. By applying reflector shaping in or­
der to obtain a uniform amplitude distribution, the thickness of the shaped subre­
flector becomes large compared with the nominal hyperboloidal subreflector for 
scattering the electromagnetic wave to the edge area of the main reflector. Also, the 
shaped main reflector becomes deep (thick) compared with the nominal paraboloi­
dal main reflector, in order to adjust the optical length between the feed horn and 
the antenna‘s aperture and in order to obtain a plane aperture-phase distribution.
When the electrical size of the subreflector is small, the scattering pattern of the 
subreflector needs to be taken into account. Considerations have been made and 
incorporated for Earth station designs [13, 14]. Figure 3.6 shows an example of 
subreflector scattering patterns for various subreflector diameter cases, using the 
Figure 3.4  Beam-waveguide feeds having rotationally symmetric beams [2, 3].

current distribution method when the edge electric-field level of the subreflector is 
set to be –15 dB and the aperture angle of the main reflector is 90°. From Figure 
3.6, the spillover level of the subreflector becomes smaller with increasing sub­
reflector diameter. On the other hand, when the subreflector’s diameter becomes 
large, the blockage area of the subreflector also becomes large, and the aperture 
efficiency decreases. Accordingly, an optimum subreflector diameter for obtain­
ing maximum aperture efficiency exists based on the main reflector’s diameter, as 
shown in Figure 3.7.
3.2.2  Main Performance
To avoid the offset configuration, a four-reflector beam-waveguide feed system was 
developed for the Ibaraki No. 3 Earth Station [15, 16]. Figure 3.8 shows the ge­
ometry of this Earth station. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 and Figure 3.9 show the electrical 
performance, a breakdown of the aperture efficiency, and the radiation patterns, 
respectively.

Table 3.3 shows the electrical performances of KDDI Earth stations in Japan. 
As shown in this table, Yamaguchi No. 2 Earth Station, which is the largest Earth 
station in Japan, achieved an aperture efficiency of around 80%.
The reflector-shaping technique also results in low sidelobe characteristics, be­
cause the edge level of the aperture amplitude distribution can be reduced to a suf­
ficiently low level. The copolarization radiation patterns of Yamaguchi TTC&M/
IOT Station, which was constructed in 1980, achieved Recommendation CCIR 
(now ITU-R) S.465 [17]. Moreover, Yamaguchi No. 2 Earth Station satisfied not 
only copolarization patterns, but also cross-polarization patterns with this recom­
mendation by using shaped struts for the subreflector [18].

3.3  Tri-Reflector Offset Antenna for Terrestrial Microwave Relay Link 
Systems
In microwave relay link systems using 4-, 5-, and 6-GHz bands, in order to address 
congestion and to transition to a digital method from the analog method, it was 
necessary to develop an antenna that has superior wide-angle radiation properties 
and cross-polarization properties and that is capable of decreasing interroute in­
terference and differing polarization interference as compared to the conventional 
horn reflector. To maintain the compatibility of this antenna to the horn reflector 
[19], the signal must be fed vertically upward. Also, in the digital microwave relay 
method, in order to apply space diversity to most of the intervals, a new subantenna 
must be installed at a central height in a preexisting steel tower; therefore, miniatur­
ization and weight reduction are also critical.
To respond to the above-described requirements, an offset antenna compris­
ing a tri-reflector was investigated [20–22]. This tri-reflector composition utilized 
in the offset antenna allows a degree of freedom in the design. Design parameters 
can be optimized to decrease the sidelobe and the cross-polarized radiation level, 
increase efficiency, and perform miniaturization. In this study, there were two types 
of antennas: (1) an offset antenna with an aperture diameter of 3m comprising a 
quadratic surface of revolution and (2) an offset antenna with an aperture diameter 
of 3.6m that corrected the reflector surfaces of a main reflector and subreflectors. 
Because both of these antennas comprised a geometrical optics reflector surface 
system, they corrected undulation and achieved good wide-angle radiation proper­
ties and cross-polarization properties.

Reflector Antennas for Terrestrial Communications
A general description of how these two antennas are applied to microwave 
relay link systems is provided here:
1.	 The high-gain offset antenna with an aperture diameter of 3.6m is used at 
standard relay distance intervals of 50 km and at the terminal.
2.	 The offset antenna with an aperture diameter of 3m is used at relay dis­
tance intervals shorter than 50 km.
Good wide-angle radiation properties are required even at short distance in­
tervals, due to route congestion. Therefore, wide-angle radiation properties nearly 
equivalent to that of the offset antenna with a 3.6m aperture diameter were tar­
geted for the offset antenna with a 3m aperture diameter. Because these antennas 
exhibit excellent electrical and mechanical performance, they are widely used in all 
microwave relay link systems at 4, 5, and 6 GHz.
The antenna needed to meet the following demands:

1.	  Improve the sidelobe and cross-polarization peak level by 10 dB or greater.
2.	 Miniaturize/reduce weight to be able to install a subantenna at a central 
height on an existing steel tower, in order to apply space diversity to all 
intervals.
3.	 To maintain the high reflector surface precision and assembly precision, 
after assembly at the factory, the antenna should be transportable without 
having to disassemble it.
The principal performance of the offset antennas with the 3.6m and 3m aper­
ture diameters that satisfy the above-mentioned requirements are shown in Table 
3.4, and the physical appearance of the antennas is shown in Figure 3.10.
3.3.1  Electrical Design
3.3.1.1  Geometrical Optics Cross-Polarization Cancellation [20]
In microwave relay link systems, because two orthogonal polarizations are used to 
maximize frequency efficiency, cross-polarized components that arise as a result of 
reflector asymmetry become problematic, as shown in Figure 3.11.
The solution to the problem is mutual cancellation of the cross-polarized com­
ponents that occur in each reflector of a tri-reflector offset antenna that uses a 
corrugated conical horn or multimode horn, which generates few cross-polarized 
components, as the primary radiator. Generally, if there is a desired number of sub­
reflectors existing between a primary radiator and a main reflector that is a rotat­
ing quadric surface reflector, it is possible to display an equivalent parabola [23].

Therefore, the tri-reflector offset antenna shown in Figure 3.12 is displayed as an 
equivalent parabola in Figure 3.13.
In this equivalent parabola, if the central axis of the primary radiator matches 
the parabola reflector axis (specifically, if ε = 180 deg), a rotationally symmetric, 
cross-polarization canceling system arises.

3.3.1.2  Design of an Antenna That Accounts for Undulation
A tri-reflector offset antenna designed according to the conditions for geometrical 
optics cross-polarization cancellation will not be a complete cross-polarization can­
cellation system at 4, 5, and 6 GHz. Therefore, the cross-polarized components at 
a specified frequency must be evaluated with respect to undulation.
According to the beam-mode expansion method [5], the maximum value C 
(electrical field) of the cross-polarized components, whose value is based on the 
maximum value of the copolarized radiation pattern, is provided in the following 
formula:

wave. As for δi, when the main reflector is facing downward, δ1 = δ2 = δ3 = 1, and 
when the main reflector is facing upward, δ1 = 1 and δ2 = δ3 = –1. Also, the follow­
ing expressions hold true:

where λ is the free-space wavelength. Ri and Ri′ are the distance between the inter­
section point of the central beam on the reflector and the focal point on the incident 
(reflection) side of the reflector, respectively. They take negative values if there is a 
focal point at the incident side and reflection side of the reflectors and a focal point 
in the direction of light beam movement at the distance between the intersection 
points of the central light beam and the reflectors. Also, d1 is the distance between 
the subreflectors measured along the central beam, and d2 is the distance between 
subreflector #2 and the main reflector measured along the central beam.
Equations (3.10) and (3.14) are used to evaluate antenna cross-polarization 
properties. However, if the target value is not met, a correction is made using the 
abovementioned parameters. Factors other than cross-polarization properties that 
must be considered are edge level and spillover loss, which can be evaluated ac­
cording to the results in [6].
3.3.1.3  Selecting Design Targets and a Reflector Surface System
Design targets are shown in Table 3.5. A reflector surface system that meets the tar­
get values in Table 3.5 should be selected from among the 18 types of reflector sur­
face systems shown in Figure 3.14. However, the forms in which the main reflector 
faces upward are excluded, because the adherence of snow could cause properties 
to degrade. With respect to the remaining 10 types, the required reflector surface 
system is the geometrical optics cross-polarization cancellation system in which the 
aperture is 3.6m, and the results of an evaluation using (3.10) are shown in Table 
3.6. Considering the results in the Table 3.6, type 10 has the lowest cross-polariza­
tion peak level out of the forms that meet the structural requirement of a 6m height 
or below, and therefore, type 10 is selected as this antenna reflector surface system. 
An undulation correction is performed for this reflector surface system to optimize 
wide-angle radiation properties and cross-polarization properties.

3.3  Tri-Reflector Offset Antenna for Terrestrial Microwave Relay Link Systems 
93
A reflector surface system with the optimal design is shown in Figure 3.15. 
Note that the offset antenna with an aperture of 3.6m has the reflector surface 
system that follows the reflector surface modification described in Section 3.3.1.4.
3.3.1.4  Achieving Asymmetric Aperture Distribution by Modifying the Reflector 
[22]
Reflector surface modification is not performed in the reflector surface system of 
the antenna with an aperture diameter of 3m. However, it is performed in the re­
flector surface system of the antenna with an aperture diameter of 3.6m: The main 
reflector and subreflector #2 are modified in order to further improve wide-angle 
radiation properties and cross-polarization properties.
Considering a dual-reflector offset antenna with a hypothetical main radiator 
whose phase center is at one focal point of subreflector #2, reflector surface modifi­
cation in the reflector surface system selected in Section 3.3.1.3 is obtained through

Reflector Antennas for Terrestrial Communications
numerical integration of the partial differential equation derived from the rule of 
reflection at the subreflector under conditions derived from (1) the rule of a fixed 
optical path length, (2) the axially asymmetric of the aperture distribution, and (3) 
the energy-saving side.
The result of reflector surface modification is the improvement of radiation 
properties by combining the aperture surface distribution into a desired distribu­
tion shape. For microwave relay antennas in particular, the important countermea­
sure for interference is to utilize the wide-angle properties of a horizontal surface. 
Low sidelobe properties that are the same over the entire solid angle are not neces­
sarily required. If aperture distribution is achieved such that only surfaces that ab­
solutely must have low sidelobes are rendered in a low sidelobe shape and all other 
surfaces are rendered into highly efficient shapes, then it is possible to implement 
low sidelobes while maintaining aperture efficiency. The target aperture distribu­
tion is shown in Figure 3.16.
3.3.1.5  Primary Radiator Selection and Design
If this antenna requires good wide-angle radiation and cross-polarization properties 
across the 4-, 5-, and 6-GHz bands, then the performance of the primary radiator 
must be as follows:
1.	 The main beam is rotationally symmetric. 
2.	 There is little frequency variation of the main beamwidth.
3.	 Electrical power is high in the main beam.
4.	 The sidelobes are low and the voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) is small.

5.	 There is little frequency variation of the phase center.
6.	 There is a wide frequency range that meets the above-mentioned perform­
ance requirements.
A ring-loaded corrugated conical horn was utilized as the primary radiator 
meeting the above-mentioned performance requirements [24]. There are 35 col­
umns in the corrugated uniform part, and the thickness of the fins is 4 mm. Also, 
the converter unit comprises a ring-loaded converter with 25 columns, and each 
dimension is determined such that trap resonance does not occur due to high-order 
mode waves.
3.3.1.6  Reduction of High-Order Period Components of Reflector Surface 
Distortion
Degradation of wide-angle radiation properties due to the period components of 
reflector surface distortion was a problem in the development project for this an­
tenna. Conventional reflectors were made by press-forming. However, because the 
required reflector surface precision was the highly precise value of 0.3-mm rms, 
precision was ultimately achieved manually. Therefore, although a reflector surface

precision of 0.3-mm rms was eventually achieved, distortion occurred due to strike-
forming at an approximate 300-mm pitch. The fact that distortion due to this high-
order period component causes wide-angle radiation properties to degrade was 
revealed through analytical and experimental results [25]. 
As described next in Section 3.3.2 on structural design, the countermeasure is 
to achieve a reflector surface precision of 0.3-mm rms only through press-forming, 
by producing a highly precise press-forming mold. Figure 3.17 shows the wide-an­
gle radiation properties obtained when using a press-formed reflector and a strike-
formed reflector. As is clear from the figure, antennas using press-formed reflectors 
achieved a maximum improvement of approximately 5 dB from 20 to 30 deg in a 
horizontal plane, compared to antennas using strike-formed reflectors.
3.3.2  Structural Design
3.3.2.1  Mechanical Performance
After the antenna is lifted to an elevated location, such as a steel tower in a moun­
tainous region or on the roof of a city building, the direction of the antenna is 
adjusted to match the azimuth and angle of elevation of the opposing antenna to 
within 1/100th of a degree, and the communication line must be maintained over 
many years against wind and seismic forces. Various mechanical conditions, such as 
air-proofing the entire antenna, must be met in order to accurately preserve strength 
and the relative relationships between the three reflectors and primary radiator, 
as well as to prevent corrosion of the feed waveguide system. Assembling these 
antennas under poor conditions, such as in mountainous regions or on the roofs of 
buildings, creates problems related to both quality and the duration of construction 
work.

Therefore, the offset antenna is completely assembled at the factory, and then 
transported on a large, specialized vehicle without ever disassembling it. This 
makes it possible to begin lifting the antenna to the steel tower immediately. The 
dimensions of the antenna were miniaturized to enable it to be installed at a central 
height on an existing steel tower. The target mass of the antenna with a 3m aper­
ture diameter was 1,000 kg or less, and the target mass of the antenna with a 3.6m 
aperture diameter was 1,600 kg or less. Also, the adjustment range of the azimuth 
angle in the conventional antenna was expanded from ±3 to ±45 deg to increase 
the location freedom on the steel tower. As for the load the antenna needed to with­
stand, the goal was to be able to withstand wind forces at a velocity pressure of 
4.7 kPa (equivalent to a wind velocity of 87 m/s) and seismic forces at a horizontal 
acceleration of 49m/s2 (equivalent to 5G). The physical appearance of the antenna 
that was designed is shown in Figure 3.18.
3.3.2.2  Shape Design
The shape of the offset antenna should be such that the limits of the inner dimen­
sions are determined by a shape through which radio waves pass that accounts for 
undulation, and the limits of the outer dimensions are determined by placement/
transport restrictions. Because the fundamental shape of the reflector surface sys­
tem is a quadric surface, the enclosure of the offset antenna must also be a quadric 
surface, especially one that comprises an assembly of developable surfaces such as 
cylindrical or conical surfaces suitable for sheet metal processing. Reinforcement 
materials are almost unnecessary due to the geometrical stiffness of the curved sur­
face, but the design should be such that the curvature and curvature direction do 
not change suddenly at intersecting parts.

Reflector Antennas for Terrestrial Communications
The geometrical design of a quadric reflector surface can be represented by a 
mathematical formula, and therefore is relatively easy to accomplish. However, for 
modified reflector surfaces expressed by discrete numerical values, a specialized co­
ordinate processing program was developed to enable the coordinates of a desired 
point to be interpolated at micrometer precision.
3.3.2.3  Strength Design
Wind and seismic forces are representative of loads that act on the offset antenna. 
By designing an offset antenna with a decreased weight and low center of gravity, 
the effect of normal seismic forces is decreased compared to that of wind forces. 
Therefore, wind forces are mainly investigated here.
To prevent the obstruction of radio waves, the enclosure, which is the main 
structure of the offset antenna, is a thin shell without internal reinforcements and 
has a streamlined shape. Therefore, it is necessary to consider local negative pres­
sure when investigating wind forces. In creating a strong design, a wind tunnel 
test is implemented using a reduced model, the pressure distribution of each an­
tenna part is determined for each wind direction, and the strength of each part is 
confirmed through finite element analysis. In addition, tests are used to check the 
buckling pressure of the main reflector for which elastic stability (buckling due to 
wind forces) of the flat shell is problematic. Also, large-deformation analyses and 
tests are performed to check the strength of the radome, which changes shape sev­
eral tens of times that of the sheet thickness.
3.3.3  Main Performance of a Prototype Antenna
3.3.3.1  Prototype Antenna Structure
The reflectors of the offset antenna with an aperture diameter of 3m are FRP-
formed reflectors, and the reflectors of the offset antenna with an aperture of 3.6m 
are aluminum alloy press-formed reflectors. Utilizing these forming methods, it is 
possible to achieve good reflector surface accuracy.
As for other antenna components, the corrugated conical horn and the enclo­
sure are aluminum alloy, and the mount is steel, and they are processed by hot-dip 
galvanizing. Also, glass fiber-reinforced Teflon is used for the radome, and radio 
wave absorbers are attached to the inner surface of the enclosure in order to im­
prove wide-angle radiation properties.
3.3.3.2  Gain/VSWR
Table 3.7 shows the gain and VSWR measurement results. VSWR is almost com­
pletely determined by the performance of the corrugated conical horn, and a perfor­
mance of 1.03 or less over the entire bandwidth has been achieved.

an aperture diameter of 3.6m. For the offset antenna with an aperture diameter of 
3m, the target value of the peak cross-polarization in a horizontal plane is –30 dB 
or below. In contrast to this target value, the measured values were approximately 
–30 dB at 3.9 GHz, approximately –32 dB at 4.7 GHz, and approximately –32 dB 
at 6.175 GHz. For the offset antenna with an aperture diameter of 3.6m, the target 
value was –35 dB or below. In contrast to this target value, the measured values 
were approximately –36 dB at 3.9 GHz, approximately –38 dB at 4.7 GHz, and 
approximately –38 dB at 6.175 GHz. These values satisfy the target performance.
3.3.3.4  Wide-Angle Radiation Properties
Figure 3.20 shows the wide-angle radiation pattern of the offset antenna with an 
aperture diameter of 3m and the offset antenna with an aperture diameter of 3.6m. 
To minimize the degradation of the wide-angle radiation properties that arises from 
scattered waves inside the antenna, radio wave absorbers are attached to the ef­
fective parts of the inner wall of the enclosure. Because FRP-forming and press-
forming were utilized to form the reflectors, reflector surface precision is near the 
limit. Therefore, from the perspective of required gain, considering the fact that 
the reflector edge level cannot be lowered further, wide-angle properties are almost 
near the limit.

3.3.3.5  Summary
By using an offset antenna form with a tri-reflector, a miniaturized, lighter weight 
antenna that can be shared on the 4-, 5-, and 6-GHz bands and that has supe­
rior wide-angle and cross-polarization properties was achieved. The application 
of beam-mode expansion allows us to easily obtain properties that require time to 
calculate, such as aperture distribution variation and cross-polarization peak levels, 
and facilitates an optimized design for a repetitive multireflector. By achieving axi­
ally asymmetric aperture distribution through reflector surface modification, and 
by achieving highly precise reflectors through the adoption of a ring-loaded corru­
gated conical horn and press-forming and FRP-forming, wide-angle properties near 
the limit were achieved. Figure 3.21 shows a photograph of a tri-reflector offset 
antenna for terrestrial microwave relay link systems.
3.4  Shaped Beam Horn Reflector Antenna for 20/30-GHz-Band 
Communication Systems
A shaped-reflector antenna consists of a single feed horn and a shaped reflector. 
Beam shaping can be performed for reflector antennas by controlling one or a com­
bination of the following three parameters: aperture shape, amplitude distribution 
on aperture, or phase distribution on aperture.
The phase distribution is easily controlled by changing the surface shape. This 
section presents a reflector design method based on the phase control for a given 
aperture shape and a primary radiator [26]. The method consists of three steps:

wavefront analysis, wavefront synthesis, and the design of the reflector surface. 
The design theory is based on geometrical optics.
3.4.1  Design
3.4.1.1  Wavefront Analysis
The inner part of the wavefront is part of a spherical wavefront as described here, 
and the outer part stays a constant width along the propagation path. In this case 
the energy in the inner part is spread over the desired service area, and that in the 
outer part is concentrated on the edge of the desired area in the sense of geometrical 
optics.
If such a wavefront exists, as shown in Figure 3.22, the normal vector has a 
constant direction on a curved line that passes the point Q, which lies on the con­
tour of the inner part. Therefore, the curved line must be on a plane that includes 
Q. The intersection of the plane including the point Q and the plane including the 
neighboring point on the contour of the inner part of Q is a straight line. Conse­
quently, the curved line mentioned above must be a straight line. In conclusion, the 
outer part of the wavefront is a ruled surface with the directrix of the contour of 
the inner part. If the normal vector on the generator passing Q of the ruled surface 
coincides with the normal vector of the inner part at Q, the ruled surface is the 
desired shape of the outer part of the wavefront.
To describe the wavefront, a rectangular coordinate system (x, y, z) and a polar 
coordinate system (r, θ, φ) with origin at O are defined as shown in Figure 3.22. 
The unit vectors tangential to each coordinate curve are designated by i, j, k, and 
er, eθ, eφ, respectively. The vector W, which goes from O to W, a point on the wave­
front, is represented by (3.12) when W is in the inner part:

The unit normal vector of the wavefront is er. The contour of the inner part is 
determined when θ is defined as a function of φ.
When W is in the outer part and on the generator passing Q, the vector W is 
represented by (3.13), where es designates the unit vector tangent to the generator 
of the ruled surface, s is the distance between W and Q, and n is the unit normal 
vector of the wavefront:

The unit normal vector n is constant on the generator passing the point W; ac­
cordingly it must coincide with er at Q. From this condition, the parameters θ′ and 
φ′ in (3.13) are determined as functions of φ. In (3.15) θ is a function of φ, which 
defines the contour of the inner part of the wavefront. When χ is defined by

It is easily seen that the vector es in (3.13) is perpendicular to the normal vector 
n of the wavefront. Furthermore it is verified that the vector es, is also perpendicu­
lar to the tangential vector of the contour of the inner part of the wavefront. Con­
sequently, the outer part of the wavefront may also be defined as a ruled surface 
whose directrix is the contour of the inner part, and the generator is perpendicular 
both to the tangent of the contour and to the direction of the propagation of the 
wavefront at the cross point of the generator and the directrix.
The condition that the outer part of the wavefront can be determined without 
twist is (dχ/dφ) ≤ 1, and by the relation of (3.15) it is also represented as follows:

3.4.1.2  Wavefront Synthesis
When the function θ(φ) describing the contour of the beam cross section is given 
and satisfies the condition (3.16), the shape of the wavefront is totally determined 
by (3.14) and (3.15) as shown previously. From a practical point of view, the de­
sired shape of the beam cross section can be approximated to a polygon and then 
only the positions of the apices are meaningful. A method to synthesize the wave­
front fitting in this case is now discussed.

For an example of the desired beam cross section, a triangle case is shown in 
Figure 3.23. At the apex A and the point B, whose distance from the beam center 
C is the local minimum, θ(φ) has extremal values. Accordingly at these points tan 
χ = 0 is concluded from (3.15), and it means φ = φ′ by (3.14). From this result the 
problem is to find the functions θ and φ′ of φ that satisfy the following conditions:

Let two apices be designated by A and A′ as shown in Figure 3.23. At the point 
B where the distance from C is the extremal minimum, condition (3.23) must be

are CA and CA′. In the following calculation B is set on the extension of the per­

beam cross section. The resultant shape of the beam cross section is a polygon with 
rounded corners.
3.4.1.3  Design of the Reflector Surface
The reflector shape that converts a spherical wavefront into a desired wavefront is 
determined by the law of the optical path. The vector W that goes from O to W, 
a point on the wavefront, is represented by (3.12) and (3.13). The vector M that 
goes from O to M, a point on the reflector as shown in Figure 3.26, is represented 
by (3.26):

When F and F designate the position of the point source and the vector that

The outer contour of the reflector can be determined as the intersection of the 
extension of the feeding conical horn and the reflector surface. The shape of the 
aperture of this antenna is not a circle, so the diameter is not defined as one value. 
For convenience we define the nominal diameter D of the shaped beam horn reflec­
tor antenna with a conical horn feed by using (3.29):

We presume that the axis of the conical horn passes through F and M0, the 
intersection of the z-axis and the reflector. And l0, φ0, and σ in (3.29) designate 
the distance between F and M0, half of the flare angle of the conical horn, and the 
offset angle as shown in Figure 3.26, respectively. If the given wavefront is a plane, 
the shape of the aperture is a circle and its diameter is represented exactly by (3.29). 
When values of design parameters D, φ0, and σ are given, the size of the antenna 
and the position of F relative to M0 are determined. One more design parameter is 
φ1, which is the maximum angle subtended by the inner part of the reflector to F, 
and this parameter controls the power ratio between the inner part and the outer 
part. When the value of φ1 is given, the distance between O and M0, designated by 
r0 in Figure 3.26, is determined. Hence, a shaped beam horn reflector antenna with 
a conical horn feed is designed when values of parameters D, φ0, φ1, σ, κ and (θa, 
φa) are given.
3.4.2  Performance
A typical antenna of this type is the shaped beam horn reflector antenna used in 
Japanese Communication Satellite 2 (CS-2) [27]. This antenna was designed by the 
preceding theory to fit Japanese islands. Figure 3.27 shows the reflector assembly 
of the antenna. The reflector is made of CFRP skins on an aluminum honeycomb

flector shaping works effectively in the 30/20-GHz bands, and it does not affect the 
desired pencil beam in the 6/4-GHz bands. Figure 3.28 shows measured radiation 
patterns in each frequency band. The performance of the antenna is summarized 
in Table 3.8.

The satellite news gathering (SNG) systems transmit directly from the coverage 
spots, such as image material transmission and event relay. This section describes 
the features of and the design method for an in-vehicle station antenna used as a 
mobile station for an SNG system [28–30].
3.5.1  Reflector Design
This antenna is an offset Gregorian type, with an elliptical-aperture main reflector 
with an effective aperture of 2m (orbit plane) × 1m (orthogonal plane), and with 
reflector modification applied on the main and subreflectors. Additionally, the pri­
mary horn is a double-flare type, triple-mode horn with a rotationally symmetric 
beam for both its transmission and reception bands and a low cross-polarization 
component.
The major advantages of this antenna are that it is very efficient as has an ex­
cellent wide-angle radiation pattern and cross-polarization, which are intended to 
reduce radio wave interference with nearby satellites. (Interference is a particular 
problem with small-diameter antennas.) On-board vehicle antennas can be set on 
the roof of a small four-wheel-drive vehicle and electric power can be used to ex­
pand and retract them and establish satellite connections. Furthermore, all of the 
satellite communications equipment, including the main and subreflectors, is built 
for mounting to and dismounting from a vehicle and can be taken apart (like a 
portable station) so that in places where a vehicle cannot easily pass, the necessary 
equipment can be carried in and used as a portable station antenna.
The reflector system of the antenna is the offset Gregorian type and uses a main 
and subreflector for reflector modification. The reflector modification method used 
here began with selecting a quadratic reflector, which is the standard form, then 
gradually changing the form of the subreflector from a quadratic reflector. Then

the main reflector corresponding to the subreflector was determined based on the 
optical path length. 
A coordinate system describing the main and subreflectors is shown in Figure 
3.29. The rectangular coordinate system XYZ is set such that the Z-axis corre­
sponds to beam direction and the ZX-plane corresponds to the central cross section 
of the antenna; i, j, and k are unit vectors of each axis. The rectangular coordinate 
system X1Y1Z1 is set such that the direction of the central axis of the cone from ori­
gin O to the subreflector is defined as the Z1-axis, and the Z1X1-plane corresponds 
to the central cross section of the antenna. The unit vectors of each respective axis 
are i1, j1, and k1, and the polar coordinates θ and φ are defined in relation to this 
coordinate system.
In Figure 3.30, r, the distance from origin O to any point R on the subreflector, 
is given by a function of θ and φ:

Then, if the vector from origin O to point R is labeled rer, the vector from point

radiation properties depend on r(θ, φ), which determines the form of the subreflec­
tor. In this reflector design method, r(θ, φ) chooses a quadratic reflector as the basis

mirror and –1 for a rotational ellipsoid mirror. The reflector modification function 
fi(θ, φ) is appropriately chosen in the function corresponding to the aperture shape 
or aperture field distribution.
The following points were taken into consideration in the design:

3.5  Offset-Shaped Dual-Reflector Antenna 
113
1.	 The antenna has a circular aperture equivalent to 1.4m. To avoid the inter­
ference in a satellite orbit plane, the real aperture size is set to an ellipse of 
2m × 1m.
2.	 To make the antenna compact, the distance between the main and subre­
flectors should be as short as possible, and the structure should be designed 
so the feed does not overflow from the back of the main reflector.
3.	 After reflector modification, the reflector structure should be such that 
there is as little cross-polarization as possible.
The outline of the designed antenna is shown in Figure 3.31. The aperture dis­
tribution was set to make the edge level as low as possible; about 80% of aperture 
is uniform. The calculated values for the radiation pattern are shown in Figure 
3.32. Calculated gains are 43.5 and 44.4 dB (including 0.2 dB of feed loss), respec­
tively, for 12.25 and 14.5 GHz.
3.5.2  Mechanical Structure
A small on-vehicle station for SNG was put into practical use. The antenna con­
sisted of actuator support parts and a radiation-feed system, which consisted of the 
main and subreflectors, the primary horn, and the feed system. Because the antenna 
is designed to be on board a vehicle, the wind load needed to be as small as possible 
and the antenna light and of a simple structure so that it would be easy to transport, 
assemble, and set up. The mechanical and electrical performances of this antenna 
are shown in Tables 3.9 and 3.10, respectively.
The main reflector, built of sheet molding compound (SMC) using aluminum-
coated glass fiber as its reflective surface, divides into three reflector parts. The 
subreflector has a metal reflector made by pressing an aluminum panel, which 
keeps both the weight and cost low. To realize a weight savings for the feed system, 
aluminum material was used. The feed system is divided into two pieces in the sym­
metry plane, but it is a single piece in the axial direction.

part consists of a worm-drive reducer mechanism and brushless DC motor that can 
switch between two speeds: fast (5°/s) and slow (1°/s).
3.5.3  Main Performance
The antenna gains at the input port of the feed system are 44.8 dBi at 14.25 GHz 
and 43.6 dBi at 12.5 GHz. The aperture efficiency except the feed loss is 70% or 
greater at transmission and reception bands, thus achieving a high level of effi­
ciency. The radiation patterns in the near axis and wide angle are shown in Figures 
3.34 and 3.35, respectively. The radiation pattern has a cross-polarization discrimi­
nation of greater than 35 dB. The radiation pattern also has a low sidelobe that 
meets the condition of being 29 – 25 log θ dBi (1 deg ≤ θ ≤ 58 deg) and –15 dBi (58 
deg < θ), in spite of the antenna having a small aperture of only about 60 wave­
lengths. The noise temperature characteristics of the antenna in elevation angle at 
the output port of the feed system are shown in Figure 3.36. At an angle of elevation 
of 30 deg, it was under 35K. The measurement results confirm that all properties 
were achieved as indicated by the design values. The design method for the high-
efficiency elliptical beam, the cross-polarization elimination reflector system, and 
the double-flare type, triple-mode horn are appropriate.

3.6  Low-Profile Dual-Shaped Reflector Antenna with an Elliptical 
Aperture for Aeronautical Satellite Communication Systems
Mobile satellite communication systems can provide global services without a ter­
restrial communications network by using artificial satellites. Several mobile satel­
lite communications systems for engineering tests and commercial services have 
been reported [31–36]. To provide worldwide services, satellite communications 
antennas are required to point in almost all directions of an upper hemisphere. In 
addition, the antennas must have a low profile because of mounting restrictions.
A planar phased-array antenna [31, 32] is an attractive candidate for a low-
profile satellite tracking antenna; however, it cannot achieve high antenna perfor­
mance up to the low angle of elevation due to an effective aperture area reduc­
tion. On the other hand, a mechanically scanning antenna maintains high antenna 
performance up to a low angle of elevation. The aperture shape of a mechanical 
scanning antenna needs to be elliptical to prevent the increase of antenna height at 
any elevation beam direction. A dual-shaped reflector antenna with an elliptical ap­
erture is employed for the mechanical scanning antenna that realizes a low-profile 
and high antenna performance.
The design of a low-profile dual-shaped reflector antenna with high antenna 
performance follows two procedures. First, the low-profile reflector antenna with 
an elliptical aperture is designed by using Aoki’s geometrical optics (GO) shaping 
technique. The reflector antenna thus obtained realizes a low-profile antenna at 
Figure 3.33  On-vehicle antenna mounted on the vehicle.

any angle of elevation rotation. Next, the initial reflector antenna obtained by us­
ing GO shaping is shaped again to achieve the desired antenna performance by the 
suppression of undesired power. Here the antenna performance and the undesired 
power are evaluated by means of physical optics (PO). The desired antenna perfor­
mance is expected to be achieved because the risk of antenna performance degrada­
tion is reduced by suppressing the undesired scattering. The resulting antenna is a 
low-profile reflector antenna that can be enclosed within a fixed circle to achieve 
the desired performance.
3.6.1  Design Method
3.6.1.1  Dual-Shaped Reflector Antenna with an Elliptical Aperture
The antennas for satellite communications that provide worldwide services must 
have the ability to cover almost all of the beam directions in the upper hemisphere. 
Here we present the basic concept for a low-profile dual-shaped reflector antenna 
that can be mechanically turned in up to the direction of a low elevation angle. The 
height of the main reflector edge is chosen as the focal length f of the paraboloid for 
taking the maximum aperture diameter. The main reflector is shaped to be enclosed 
within the circle viewed from the elevation axis of rotation. The diagrams of the an­
tenna described above are shown in Figures 3.37 and 3.38. The proposed antenna 
maintains a low profile even in the direction of low elevation angle because all parts

3.6.1.2  Initial Design
Several design methods for dual-shaped reflector antennas with an elliptical ap­
erture have been proposed [29, 30, 37–39]. Here the reflector shaping technique 
based on GO proposed by Aoki [29, 30] is employed. Aoki’s design method with 
modified shaping functions is presented in this section.
The coordinate system to define the parameters of a main reflector and a sub­
reflector is shown in Figure 3.39. The rectangular coordinate system (X,Y,Z) is 
defined so that the aperture plane is parallel to the XY-plane. The phase center of a 
feed horn is set at the origin O. The unit vectors i, j, and k are the directions of the 
X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. The coordinates of subreflector and main reflector 
are defined by the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ). Here r is the distance from O to 
the point S on the subreflector and a function of θ and φ.
The point S is expressed by using the direction vector ˆre  as follows:

Once the coordinates of the point S have been determined, the corresponding 
point M on the main reflector is determined by GO [29, 30]. The vector ˆse  is de­
fined by the law of reflection on the subreflector and rs is determined by the law of 
optical paths.
In this design method, r (θ, φ) is defined by a linear combination of some 
shaping functions added to the initial function representing a conventional quadric 
surface of revolution:

and a are the eccentricity and constant of the subreflector, respectively. Two kinds 
of shaping functions are specified, one to modify the aperture shape and the other 
to modify the aperture field distribution. The functions to modify the aperture 
shape are:

where t = θ/θ0, and θ0 is half of the angle subtended by the subreflector to the origin 
O. The functions f1 and f2 include t4 instead of t2 or t3 in the conventional shap­
ing functions [29]. Aoki’s method sometimes yields a meaningless reflector with 
locally reversed surfaces. This problem is resolved by using an appropriate value 
for the exponent. The power of t is modified to realize a highly distorted reflector 
(described later). The function f1 modifies the width of the aperture in the YZ plane 
while keeping the width of the aperture in the ZX-plane. The function f2 modifies 
the asymmetry of the aperture shape with respect to the YZ-plane while keeping the 
widths in the YZ- and ZX-planes. The coefficients x1 and x2 control the magnitude 
of modifications. The functions f1 and f2 are mainly used to modify the aperture 
shape, but will also modify the aperture field distribution. Therefore, the above 
shaping functions should be determined before the modification of the aperture 
field distribution.

Here the appropriate shaping functions are selected and modified from the 
conventional shaping functions. The function f3 is modified to satisfy f3(θ0, 0) = 
0. The target reflector shape can be easily realized because of the fixed shape in 
the xz-plane. The coefficients α1q and α2q change the curves of G1q(θ) and G2q(θ), 
respectively. The function f3 controls the aperture field distribution, while keeping 
the aperture shape approximately. The functions Gpq(θ) and Hq(φ) control aperture 
field distributions depending on θ and φ, respectively. The coefficient ypq controls 
the magnitude of the modification. To keep the aperture shape, G1q(θ) and G2q(θ) 
satisfy the following condition:

Under this condition, a ray from the edge of the subreflector will not change the 
direction, so the aperture shape will be kept approximately, in that it will change 
slightly according to the change in position of the subreflector edge. The desired 
aperture field distribution is realized by using shaping function f3.
3.6.1.3  Final Design
The low-profile dual-shaped reflector antenna enclosed within a fixed circle can 
be realized by the GO shaping described in the previous section. This method can 
successfully control the outline of the dual-shaped reflector antenna. However, the 
desired antenna performance cannot be achieved, especially for the small reflector 
antenna. The partial power reflected by the subreflector returns to the aperture of 
the horn antenna and the subreflector blocking region on the main reflector. The 
former power causes the degradation of the return loss and yields undesired scat­
tering by the horn aperture. The latter power also yields undesired scattering and 
causes degradation of antenna performance. The undesired power must be sup­
pressed to obtain the desired antenna performance.
Meanwhile a ring-focus type reflector antenna [40] does not yield the above 
undesired power in the sense of geometrical optics. However a ring-focus type re­
flector antenna with a highly distorted elliptical aperture cannot be realized by the 
presented GO shaping technique. The presented GO shaping technique does not 

122 
�������������������������������������������������
Reflector Antennas for Terrestrial Communications
restrict the sign of the differential coefficient of the main reflector dM(θ, φ)/dθ and 
yields a meaningless reflector surface on the condition that negative differential 
coefficients occur at the main reflector.
The design conditions for a ring-focus type reflector antenna with a highly dis­
torted elliptical aperture are very severe. It is difficult to keep a positive sign for the 
differential coefficients on the entire surface. Therefore, a design for a low-profile 
dual-shaped reflector antenna with high antenna performance is proposed that in­
volves the following two procedures. First, the low-profile reflector antenna with 
elliptical aperture is designed by using the presented GO shaping technique. The 
reflector antenna thus obtained maintains a low profile at any angle of elevation 
rotation. Next, the initial reflector antenna is shaped again to achieve the desired 
antenna performance by the suppression of undesired scattering. 
The undesired power from the subreflector on the aperture of both the horn 
antenna and the blocking region by the subreflector on the main reflector must 
be suppressed to reduce undesired scattering. The desired antenna performance is 
achieved by suppressing the undesired power to reduce the risk of antenna perfor­
mance degradation. The antenna performance and the undesired power are evalu­
ated by PO because GO does not predict the precise electromagnetic fields of an 
electrically small reflector. The initial reflector is shaped again by using PO. The 
reflector shaping based on PO has been reported on in [41]. The proposed method 
optimizes the suppression of undesired power as well as the antenna performance.
The functions for PO shaping are added in (3.42):

where λnm is the mth root of nth Bessel function of the first kind. The edge of the 
subreflector is fixed because of f4(θ0, φ) = 0. The objective function is defined by 
suppressing the undesired power as well as achieving desired antenna performance. 
The objective function is defined as the summation of individual objective functions 
associated with the antenna gain, the radiation pattern, and the undesired power 
on both regions.
Analytic optimization methods such as the conjugate gradient method are 
not suitable for optimizing the objective function Gtotal because the differentia­
tion value of the objective function cannot be determined. We employ the genetic 
algorithm (GA) [42, 43], which can be easily applicable to various optimization 
problems. The coefficients znm of the shaping function f4(θ, φ) are represented as 
the chromosome, and the value of the objective function is treated as the fitness 
in the GA optimization procedures. The GA searches the optimization solution by 
changing the values of the chromosomes, in other words, changing the shape of the 
reflector surface. The optimum reflector shape is determined after the GA finds the 
optimum values of the coefficients znm.
3.6.2  Main Performance
The dual-shaped reflector antenna is designed by using the proposed method and 
evaluating the validity of the obtained reflector antenna. A Cassegrain antenna is 
used for the initial dual-reflector antenna before performing reflector shaping. The

target diameter of a circle shown in Figure 3.38 is 221 mm in consideration of the 
severe mounting restrictions. The parameters of the initial subreflector in (3.43) 
are a = 103.157, e = 1.738, and θ0 = 30.184°. A corrugated horn antenna with an 
aperture diameter of 64 mm is used as the primary radiator. 
The reflector antenna can be shaped to be enclosed within the above circle 
by using the GO shaping technique described in Section 3.6.1.2. The coefficients 
of shaping functions defined in (3.44) and (3.45) that are used for changing the 
aperture’s shape are x1 = -12.3 and x2 = -21.36, respectively. The aperture field 
distribution is also modified by using the shaping function f3(θ, φ) because initial 
conditions before PO shaping are significant to obtain better antenna performance.
The dual-shaped reflector antenna as thus far described realizes a low profile 
enclosed within a fixed circle. The initial reflector antenna is obtained by using GO 
shaping. However, the desired antenna performance cannot be achieved. So the 
initial reflector antenna is shaped again to achieve the desired antenna performance 
by using the proposed PO shaping described in Section 3.6.1.3. The parameters of 
PO shaping are presented. The reflector antenna is optimized at the center frequen­
cy of both the receiving band (11.2 to 12.8 GHz) and transmitting band (14.0 to 
14.4 GHz). The coefficients of objective functions are determined so that antenna 
gains at both bands are preferentially optimized. The diagram of the designed dual-
reflector antenna is shown in Figure 3.40. 
The proposed PO shaping controls the antenna performance as well as the un­
desired scattering by the undesired power on the horn antenna and blocking region 
on the main reflector. The calculated electric field distributions at 12 GHz on the 
horn aperture are shown in Figure 3.41. The undesired power on the horn aperture 
is successfully reduced up to the design value. Achievement of the desired antenna 
performance is expected because the risk of antenna performance degradation is 
reduced by suppressing the undesired scattering.

The calculated and measured antenna gain and antenna pattern are presented 
to investigate the proposed method. The measured antenna gain of the prototype 
antenna is compared with the calculated values, as shown in Figure 3.42. The mea­
sured antenna gain of the initial reflector is also presented. The proposed method 
successfully resolves the degradation of the antenna gain caused by the undesired 
power. The desired antenna gain is achieved in both the receiving band (11.2 to 
12.8 GHz) and transmitting band (14.0 to 14.4 GHz).
The measured antenna patterns of the fabricated prototype antenna at the cen­
ter frequency of both the Rx and Tx bands are shown in Figure 3.43. The proposed 
method successfully resolves the degradation of the antenna pattern caused by the

both bands. The calculated antenna patterns almost agree with the measured ones. 
It is shown that the degradation of antenna performance caused by the undesired 
scattering is prevented by the suppression of undesired power. The validity of the 
proposed method is supported by the measurements. Figure 3.44 shows a dual-
shaped reflector antenna with an elliptical aperture for aeronautical satellite com­
munication systems [36, 44].

transmission of high-definition video from the scenes of disasters and incidents. 
Such systems require that moving vehicles be equipped with high-gain beam-scan­
ning antennas. A great deal of research and development has already taken place 
on planar active phased-array antennas (APAAs) because they are easily modified 
into low-profile antennas and are excellent for installing in moving vehicles [33, 
46]. However, APAAs have a complex structure and require numerous modules, so 
the cost problems are significant. On the other hand, there is a structure that would 
mechanically drive a compact reflector antenna that could achieve the necessary 
functioning and performance at a reasonable cost [36, 44, 45].
Generally speaking, if a reflector antenna can use a reflector large enough rela­
tive to the wavelength, it can easily realize high performance with just a simple 
structure. For that reason, such antennas are widely used for fixed satellite com­
munications. However, smaller reflectors do not work well enough as ideal mirrors 
and thus their properties are degraded. For that reason, it has been a challenge to 
achieve the required performance given the size limitations of compact reflector 
antennas.
This section presents the problems with compact reflector antennas and dis­
cusses solutions to them. It also describes, as a design example, a compact reflector 
antenna developed for use as a Ku-band broadband ship satellite communications 
terminal, or an ESV (Earth station on vessel).
3.7.1  Compact Reflector Antenna Problems
The typical reflector antenna structures are classified into the offset type and center 
feed type. Figure 3.45 compares the two structures assuming that they have the 
same aperture size, which is a major parameter determining antenna performance. 
In the offset type, there is no blockage in the direction of radiating from the main 
reflector, but the antenna structure is rather large. In the center feed type, the pri­
mary radiator or the subreflector, which is located at the front of the main reflec­
tor, blocks the radiation from the main reflector, but this arrangement allows for 
a compact structure. Thus, the center feed type is effective for applying compact 
reflector antennas.
In terms of antenna radiating properties, blocking makes it difficult to achieve 
high efficiency and low sidelobes. Generally speaking, the lower the ratio of block­
ing area diameter to antenna aperture diameter, the better the performance. The 
aperture efficiency and sidelobe level achievable under blocking conditions and the 
ideal aperture distribution are known [47]. Thus, the problem in terms of a reflec­
tor antenna that needs to achieve both a small size and high performance (high ef­
ficiency and low sidelobe) is how to achieve an optimal aperture distribution close 
to the ideal while minimizing the blocking in a small center feed type.
To reduce blocking, making the primary radiator smaller is important in the 
case of a single-reflector antenna. For this, a backfire-type primary radiator is effec­
tive [48, 49]. A backfire primary radiator is self-supporting, so it has the advantage 
of avoiding the blocking caused by a support structure. However, primary radia­
tion patterns cannot be finely controlled with backfire primary radiators, so there 
are limits on how far the aperture distribution can be optimized.
Dual-reflector antennas have the advantage of being able to optimize aperture 
distribution by using reflector surface modification technology. The diameter of the 

3.7  Compact Reflector Antenna for Ku-Band ESV and VSAT 
127
subreflector must be several wavelengths at least, in order to function as a mirror 
and to realize optimum aperture distribution. 
The results of the above discussion are summarized in Table 3.11. In cases 
where the antenna aperture is relatively large and the blocking of a subreflector is 
acceptable, a dual-reflector antenna that has excellent optimization of its aperture 
distribution is advantageous. Single-reflector antennas are advantageous if the an­
tenna aperture is small and blocking of a subreflector is not acceptable. Thus, it is 
necessary to select an antenna structure suited for the desired radiating character­
istics and size, especially the antenna aperture.
Figure 3.46 shows design examples for a compact reflector antenna for mobile 
satellite communications Earth stations. Figure 3.46(a) shows a 1m antenna (dual-
reflector antenna) for a Ku-band broadband satellite communications terminal on 
board a vessel (Ku-Mate® SX-5300), which is certified for Eutelsat Standard M 
type approval. Figure 3.46(b) shows a Ku-band Helisat 40-cm antenna (a single-
reflector antenna using a backfire primary radiator), compatible with HD video 
transmission on board a helicopter.

3.7.2  Design Example
We next discuss a design example for a Ku-band ESV antenna with a 1m aperture.
3.7.2.1  Design Procedures
The design procedures are as follows:
1.	 Select antenna configuration.
2.	 Determine antenna structure.
3.	 Optimize aperture distribution by reflector surface modification.
4.	 Confirm radiating properties.
The design process was conducted as follows for each step:
1.	 Select antenna configuration. The single-reflector type and double-reflector 
type were comparatively examined. Based on the results, the double-reflec­
tor type was chosen because the antenna aperture was relatively large at 
50 wavelengths. A ring-focus Gregorian antenna structure was chosen in 
order to reduce the effects of subreflector blocking and to ensure freedom 
of design of the primary radiator. The reflector configuration is shown in 
Figure 3.47.

2.	 Determine antenna structure. The beam is scanned with a mechanical drive 
mechanism across the entire antenna, because it tracks a satellite in re­
sponse to changes in ship position and attitude. Thus, to achieve a com­
pact antenna structure, the focal length of the main reflector was based 
on a length that would minimize the swept volume of the antenna sweeps 
across the entire scanned range. The subreflector diameter was set to six 
wavelengths, the minimum necessary to optimize aperture distribution in 
the range where blocking is acceptable.
3.	 Optimize aperture distribution by reflector surface modification. The ide­
al aperture distribution under the condition that there will be blocking 
is known [47], but is hard to actually achieve with a compact reflector 
antenna. Therefore, the first step was to modify the reflector surface us­
ing geometrical optics. Then the surface was corrected using wave theory 
analysis to optimize the aperture distribution, getting close to the ideal dis­
tribution. Analytical precision is a problem with wave theory analysis since 
the subreflector diameter is small. Here, analysis precision was enhanced 
by the finite element method (FEM), wherein analysis was conducted on 
the feed waveguide, the primary radiator horn, and the subreflector.
4.	 Confirm radiating properties. As in step 3, precision was enhanced by us­
ing the results of FEM analysis, taking the main reflector as the radiating 
wave source. The current induced on the main reflector was calculated by 
a physical optics (PO) approximation and the antenna radiating properties 
were analyzed.
3.7.2.2  Reflector Surface Modification Using Wave Analysis
Next we describe a correction of the aperture phase distribution based on wave 
theory analysis.
The phase distribution in the E- and H-planes at the antenna aperture before 
correction is shown in Figure 3.48, with radial coordinates on the horizontal axis. 
The figure shows that there is a gap of up to 60 deg (±30 deg) from the ideal uni­
form phase distribution.

The aperture phase distribution shown in Figure 3.48 can be made close to the 
ideal uniform phase distribution by modifying the main reflector’s surface . The 
amount of modification in the main reflector’s axial direction is shown in Figure 
3.49. Because an axisymmetrical main reflector is easily manufactured, the average 
of the main reflector across the circumferential direction was used as the amount of 
modification. Figure 3.50 illustrates the radiation pattern before and after reflector 
surface modification. It shows that the first and second sidelobes in the E-plane 
and the first sidelobe in the H-plane were reduced as a result of reflector surface 
modification.

3.8.1.2  Design Example
A multibeam antenna with wide beam spacing is designed with a 695-mm-diameter 
parabolic reflector for simultaneous reception of broadcasting from BSs and CSs. 
Primary radiators for CSs are located near the focus of the parabolic reflector, and 
a primary radiator for BSs is located close to the ray, starting from the focus and 
reflected at the center of the parabolic reflector. Figure 3.54 shows the calculated 
radiation pattern.
Calculated results agree well with experimental results. The antenna is con­
firmed to receive broadcasting from BSs and CSs simultaneously.

The multibeam antenna under discussion is shown in Figure 3.55 and its perfor­
mance in terms of simultaneous reception of broadcasting from BSs and CSs is 
summarized in Table 3.12.

fiber cables to subscribers [53, 54]. For base station antennas in such systems, offset 
single-reflector antennas were developed to radiate a beam with a sector shape in

Reflector Antennas for Terrestrial Communications
the horizontal plane and a cosecant-square shape in the vertical plane [55, 56]. In 
these antenna designs, a skilled reflector shaping technique was applied to achieve 
excellent beam shaping. However, these reflectors were required to be as large as 
several tens of wavelength in size. Furthermore, since these antennas radiated single 
beams, multiple antenna reflectors were required in order to cover multiple sector 
areas.
In this section, a novel shaped reflector, six-sector antenna is proposed for a base 
station antenna in P-MP FWA systems. The antenna is advantageous for radiating 
vertically shaped six-sector beams simultaneously with a compact configuration.
3.9.1  Design
3.9.1.1  Antenna Configuration
The antenna configuration is illustrated in Figure 3.56. The antenna is composed of 
a reflector and six feed horns with an omnidirectional horn reflector [57, 58] type

arrangement. The reflector is a funnel-shaped torus reflector whose axis of rotation 
is the x-axis. The rotation radius is designed to achieve the required beamwidth of 
60 deg in a horizontal plane. The generation line of the torus reflector is shaped 
from a parabola to achieve a cosecant-square-like radiation pattern in a vertical 
plane, as described in the following section. Being different from an omnidirec­
tional horn reflector antenna, the six feed horns are symmetrically installed on the 
locus circle of the initial parabola focus. In the current design, the feed horns are 
conventional square aperture horns excited by the fundamental mode for a simple 
feed structure.
3.9.1.2  Reflector Shaping
The shaped torus reflector results from the generating line shaped from a parabola. 
The generating line shaping is based on the path length difference (aberration) in 
the xz-plane including both a feed and the reflector symmetrical axis (x-axis). Fig­
ure 3.57 shows a schematic cross-sectional illustration of generating line shaping in 
the xz-plane. In this figure, F is a feed point, M is an arbitrary point on the generat­
ing line, and es is a unit vector from F to M. The generating line is assumed to be 
shaped along es by amount s from an initial parabola. Path length increase d due to 
shaping is given for rays on the xz-plane by:

On the other hand, we assume that the desired aberration δ is represented by 
a power series of an appropriate coordinate t of the point on the generating line 
[59] as:

where ρ0 and ρ are the position vectors of M on the initial parabola and a shaped 
generating line from the origin M0, respectively, and it is the unit vector of the ap­
propriate coordinate frame for t. We can calculate the shaping amount s by substi­
tuting (3.60) into (3.59) and equating with (3.58).
Provided that the power series coefficients am are determined, we can calculate 
the radiation pattern from the shaped reflector using the shaping amount s. There­
fore, we can design the shaped reflector to achieve a desired radiation pattern shape 
by minimizing the square sum of the difference between desired and calculated 
patterns with respect to optimization variables . In the current design, we apply the 
conjugate gradient method to minimization, and approximate the calculated radia­
tion pattern by a summation of contributions from divided small segments of the 
reflector for calculation convenience.
3.9.1.3  Design Example
Figure 3.56 shows a designed antenna. For the initial parabola, the focal length is 
25 mm, the inclined angle is 90 deg, and the subtended semiangle is 45 deg. The 
radius of the locus circle of the initial parabola focus is 40 mm. For the reflector 
shaping, the origin M0 is at the top of the initial parabola, the coordinate frame for 
t is the –x direction, and orders of the power series considered in (3.59) are m = 1 
to 5 [59]. Radiation patterns designed at 26.125 GHz are shown in Figure 3.58. 
The patterns include only a contribution from current on the reflector, which is

considered in reflector shaping. The radiation pattern in the vertical plane is well 
shaped to a cosecant-square-like shape, but the pattern in the horizontal plane has 
about a 60-deg beamwidth regardless of the reflector shaping.
Figure 3.59 shows the measured radiation patterns for the prototype antenna, 
and Figure 3.60 shows the actual prototype. For comparison, Figure 3.59 includes 
actual calculated patterns, including contributions from both the reflector current 
and the feed horn. The patterns also include the 3-dB loss of a switch connected 
to the feed horn. In the vertical plane, although partial level reduction and some 
ripples appear in the measured pattern caused by the unexpected blocking and 
scattering by the structural parts, the measured pattern agrees well with the cal­
culated pattern. In the horizontal plane, the agreement between the measured and 
calculated values is better. These experimental results validate the antenna design.

Applications

4.1  Introduction
The term terahertz has been ubiquitous in the arena of new technological advances 
during the past couple of years. New applications are emerging every day that are 
exploiting the promises of terahertz: its small wavelength; its ability to penetrate 
dust, clouds, and fog; and the possibility of having a large instantaneous bandwidth 
for high-speed communication channels. Until very recently, space-based instru­
ments for astrophysics, planetary science, and Earth science missions have been 
the primary motivator for the development of terahertz antennas, sensors, sources, 
and systems. In recent years, however, emerging areas such as imaging from space 
platforms, surveillance of person-borne hidden weapons or contraband from a safe 
stand-off distance and reconnaissance, medical imaging and DNA sequencing, and 
the world of high-speed communications have been the driving forces for this area 
of research.
Terahertz science is fascinating. One of the most pivotal quests for humans has 
been to find the answer to the vital question of “Where did we all come from?” It 
turns out that the answer to that lies in the cosmic signatures of the terahertz part 
of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is well known that most of the radiation in the 
universe is emitted at wavelengths longer than 10 microns (<30 THz), and this 
peaks at about 100 microns (3 THz), if we exclude contributions from the cosmic 
microwave background. By studying the minute fluctuations of the electromagnetic 
waves coming from the distant stars and galaxies at terahertz frequencies, one can 
study how stars are formed, how galaxies evolve, and how planetary systems come

about. Even for our own planet Earth, terahertz radiation is an indicator for trac­
ers of global warming and ultimately the health of the planet on which we live. For 
planetary bodies beyond our own planet, terahertz emission is associated with at­
mospheric dynamics and trace constituents in planets, moons, and comets. Instru­
ments at the terahertz frequencies have the potential to reveal information about 
planetary atmospheres, surfaces, and subsurface water and ice contents [1–3].
The study of terahertz frequencies has been very important for astrophysicists 
for a long time. The studies of the birth of our universe, which started with a big 
bang almost 15 billion years ago, has been the most fascinating topic for physicists 
and ordinary people alike to explore. Exploring this extraordinary event in the 
history and evolution of our universe using electromagnetic waves has been the 
primary tool of astronomers for a long time. However, when we look back in time 
by observing distant stars and galaxies through the prism of the electromagnetic 
spectrum, we can go back only to approximately 400,000 years after the big bang 
when the first lights emerged from the primordial soup of the nascent universe 
[4]. The primordial plasma—the hot, dense soup of subatomic particles that filled 
the early universe—was opaque to electromagnetic radiation; any emitted photons 
were scattered by the subatomic particles. The first electromagnetic waves—cosmic 
microwave background (CMB) radiation, the cooled radiation that has permeated 
the universe for nearly 15 billion years—was emitted approximately 400,000 years 
after the big bang, when electrons and protons first combined to form hydrogen 
atoms. CMB was discovered by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, which led to their 
receiving a Nobel Prize in 1978. The microwave radiation of CMB is confined to 
1- to 5-mm wavelengths, peaking at 2-mm wavelengths (150 GHz)—in the terri­
tory of the terahertz frequencies. 
Another area of astrophysics that plays a key role in understanding the nature 
and evolution of our universe is the high-resolution spectroscopic observations at 
terahertz frequencies [5]. The importance of this is emphasized by the key role of 
heterodyne spectrometers in different space-based and ground-based instruments 
such as the Herschel Space Observatory, Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), 
and the airborne Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Star 
formation and key phases of galaxy evolution occur in regions enshrouded by dust, 
obscuring these processes at infrared and optical wavelengths. Meanwhile, the tem­
perature in these regions of the interstellar medium is in the range of ten to a few 
thousand kelvin, which excites a wealth of submillimeter-wave spectral informa­
tion. With high-resolution spectroscopy, resolved line profiles reveal the dynamics 
of star formation, exposing the details of turbulence, outflows, and core collapse. 
Observations of emission from ionized species such as the C + fine structure transi­
tion at 1900.53690 GHz (158 μm) allows direct measurement of the diffuse com­
ponents of the interstellar medium as it cools, the amount of “dark gas” in the 
medium, and analysis of the large-scale motions of this material from which giant 
molecular clouds form.
Instruments at the terahertz frequencies have the potential to reveal information 
about planetary atmospheres, surfaces, and subsurface water and ice contents [6]. 
Recently, through a high-resolution spectrometer at terahertz frequencies operating 
in space, we learned that the water on planet Earth might have come from comets 
and that water molecules are formed in stars at an astonishing rate. Moreover, a 

4.1  Introduction

recent study with a terahertz spectrometer found that the water in a young Sun-like 
star shoots out like high-velocity “bullets” moving at more than 200,000 km/h 
from the star [7]. This can be compared to the velocity of a bullet from an AK47 
rifle, which is traveling at 2,500 km/h or 80 times slower. It is a surprise that water 
molecules are observed at this high velocity—they should have been destroyed in 
the shock where temperatures exceed 100,000 degrees. Observations reveal that 
water very likely re-forms rapidly in the hot and dense shocked gas. The conditions 
are so favorable that approximately 100 million times the amount of water in the 
Amazon River is formed, every second. Discovery of this fascinating bit of informa­
tion was possible due to instruments operating at terahertz frequencies.
Heterodyne spectrometers and imagers at terahertz frequencies also provide 
highly sensitive measurements of our own atmosphere. This is essential for making 
informed policy decisions affecting ozone chemistry, climate, and air quality. These 
measurements have been a key component to help answer a fundamental question 
scientists are grappling with today: “How is the global Earth climatologic system 
changing and what are the consequences for life on Earth?” They have enabled 
studies of fast tropospheric processes using the terahertz limb sounding technique, 
with vertical resolution and cloud and aerosol penetration capability [8, 9].
An emerging area of terahertz applications is security imaging. Demand for 
new surveillance capabilities for use in airport screenings and battlefield security 
checkpoints has led to the development of terahertz imagers and sensors. Imaging 
at terahertz frequencies has several advantages compared to microwave or infrared 
imaging: The wavelengths in this regime are short enough to provide high resolu­
tion with modest apertures, yet long enough to penetrate clothing. Moreover, un­
like with infrared, the terahertz frequencies are not affected by dust, fog, and rain 
[10]. 
Several groups around the world are working on the development of terahertz 
imagers for various applications. One option is to use passive imaging techniques, 
which were very successful at millimeter-wave frequencies, by scaling frequencies to 
the terahertz range. However, the background sky is much warmer at terahertz fre­
quencies due to high atmospheric absorption. Because passive imagers detect small 
differences in temperatures from radiating objects against the sky background, at 
these frequencies passive imagers do not provide enough scene contrast for short 
integration times. In contrast, in an active imager, the object is illuminated with a 
terahertz source and the resulting reflected/scattered radiation is detected to make 
an image. However, the glint from the background clutter in an active terahertz 
imager makes it hard to provide high-fidelity images without a fortunate alignment 
between the imaging system and the target. The group at NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL) has developed an ultra-wideband radar-based terahertz imaging 
system that addresses many of these issues and produces high-resolution through-
clothes images at stand-off distances [11]. The system uses a 675- GHz solid-state 
Tx/Rx system in a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar mode 
working at room temperature. The imager has subcentimeter range resolution and 
comparable cross-range resolution at a 25m stand-off distance with a 1m aperture 
mirror. Figure 4.1 shows a radar image taken in 1 sec using the 675- GHz FMCW 
radar at a 25m stand-off distance.

Reflector Antennas for Terahertz Imaging Applications
Communications at terahertz frequencies have gained attention in recent years. 
The high fractional bandwidth at these frequencies potentially offers multigigabit 
per second wireless data links [12]. Although the data rate increases linearly with 
the carrier frequency for a fixed fractional bandwidth, the free-space path losses in­
crease with the square of frequency, quickly leading to limited transmission ranges 
unless very high power and phased-array based transmitters are used. However, in 
specific applications where communication requirements include very high data 
rates over short distances, terahertz communications are going to play a key role 
in those areas in the not-so-distant future. Some examples of these applications are 
high-speed wireless data transfer between handheld devices such as smart phones, 
home entertainment devices to high-definition television sets, and super-high-speed 
wireless links between high-volume servers in data centers. It will not be unreason­
able to think that we will have 10 Gb/s or higher wireless communication links 
over short distances pretty soon, even with simple data modulation schemes. 
The majority of the terahertz applications mentioned above use instruments 
with single-pixel detectors with reflector antennas. For imaging applications, the 
single-pixel receivers are raster scanned to produce the terahertz images. However, 
there is an increasing need for multipixel arrays of detectors and sensors at tera­
hertz frequencies to produce high-fidelity real-time images, mappings of large areas 
of the sky, and spectroscopic imaging of a large swath of our atmosphere.
Large focal plane arrays at terahertz frequencies are required for direct detector 
instruments to measure the polarization of the CMB, for moderate spectral resolu­
tion spectrometers, and for heterodyne instruments with very high resolution spec­
troscopic mapping. Many direct detector instruments are currently being designed

at these frequencies requiring large focal plane arrays backed by reflector antennas 
[13–15]. However, in the case of heterodyne instruments, the majority of them at 
these frequencies have been single pixel.
Although the possibility of multipixel array detectors at terahertz frequencies 
was first suggested way back in 1979 [16], progress was very slow in developing 
such instruments, although there has been some real progress during the past sev­
eral years [17–19]. But the cost and complexity of building many parallel terahertz 
sources and receivers has been a hindrance to rapid progress. The conventional ap­
proach of building single-pixel receivers and stacking them to assemble multipixel 
array receivers is not suited to terahertz frequencies. What one needs are novel 
ultracompact receiver architectures that are easy to fabricate, preferably by litho­
graphic techniques, to build multipixel heterodyne array receivers where the major­
ity of the front-end components along with the antenna element can be integrated 
in a small form factor. Antennas play a pivotal role in the successful development of 
a large focal plane of direct detector arrays as well as multipixel heterodyne array 
receivers at terahertz frequencies. For fielding these large focal plane instruments 
for ground-based, airborne, and space-based applications, careful design of the 
reflector systems is required [20]. 
In this chapter, the main properties of terahertz reflector systems for imaging 
applications are addressed in detail. Figure 4.2 shows a conceptual sketch of such 
an imaging system. The backend electronics, that is, the receiver (in the case of 
passive systems) or the transceiver (in the case of active systems), are located in the 
focal plane of the reflector system, whereas the reflector system is used to gener­
ated an image of the target plane. This plane is located at a target distance Rf from 
the reflector system aperture. The different pixels in the image can be measured by 
creating a multibeam antenna using a focal plane array (FPA) with many beams 
pointing to different pointing directions θ, or by mechanically rotating the pointing 
direction of the reflector antenna, or by a combination of both.  The image will 
be generated over a certain field of view (FoV) defined by the maximum pointing 
angle θ of the beam in each plane. The different antenna pointing directions and 
pattern shapes create a footprint at the target plane. This footprint defines the 
resolution of the image and has to be optimized to achieve high image acquisition 
speeds.

Reflector Antennas for Terahertz Imaging Applications
In this chapter, we address the properties and typical configurations of tera­
hertz imaging reflector systems for both FPAs and mechanical scanners. To study 
the properties of these systems, we derive an analytical expression of the vectorial 
field in the focal plane of a general focusing system. (Appendix 4A provides the 
detailed derivation for this field.) This analytical expression helps us to study the 
properties of the field at both the focal plane and target plane. 
By studying the field in the target plane, we can define some important param­
eters of the reflector imaging systems such as resolution, depth of focus, and FoV. 
Moreover, it leads us to the derivation of equivalence between reflector systems 
focusing in the Fraunhofer and Fresnel regions. Several design examples of this 
equivalence are provided throughout the chapter.
Moreover, starting from the analytical derivation of the field in the focal plane, 
we introduce a new formulation that allows us to conveniently calculate the power 
received by each detector that composes the focal plane array. We show how the 
power received by an array of antennas can be calculated by using its effective 
length (parameter calculated for the antenna in transmission instead of reception) 
and the field in the focal plane. This formalism is very useful for optimizing the 
array element in relation to the imaging acquisition speed. Therefore, by using this 
new formalism, we can derive some trade-offs on the optimal focal plane sampling 
for FPAs based on active and passive detectors.
In the last section of this chapter, a detailed description of imaging reflector 
systems based on mechanical scanners is provided. We summarize the general prop­
erties of raster and conical scanners, together with the most common types of me­
chanically scanned terahertz reflector systems.
4.2  Reflector Systems Focusing in the Fresnel Region
Reflector antennas are very common in microwave telecommunication systems, 
where in most situations, the object being illuminated is in the far field, that is, in 
the Fraunhofer region. In this case, the surface of the main reflector is a parabola, 
which in optical terms means that the field focuses in the infinity [see Figure 4.3(a)]. 
This is also typical in terahertz imaging reflector systems for space applications, 
where the targets are at very far distances. However, terahertz imaging reflector 
systems for terrestrial applications usually have the target in the Fresnel region, 
the radiative near field, of the focusing main reflector. In this case, to have a well-
focused field, the main reflector surface needs to be an ellipsoid with the second foci 
in the target position [see Figure 4.3(b)]. 
In this section, we briefly address the properties of the reflectors focusing in 
the Fresnel region. We will see that the field radiated around the focal point by a 
focusing aperture such as the one from an ellipsoidal reflector has all the proper­
ties of the far field [21, 22]. Moreover the field distribution in the focal region of a 
focusing device is nearly independent of the location of its focal point, provided it 
is not too close to the antenna. Thanks to this property, we can establish an equiva­
lence between a reflector focusing in the infinity and in the Fresnel region in order 
to facilitate the design of advanced near-field focusing multireflector systems (i.e., 
with reduction of the cross-polarization, improved focal plane performances, lower 
offset aberrations). 

4.2  Reflector Systems Focusing in the Fresnel Region 
151
4.2.1  Focusing in the Fresnel or Fraunhofer Region
The Fraunhofer region is the region where the antenna radiated field can be com­
puted assuming that the paths associated with each individual contribution from 
the radiating aperture are parallel. This assumption is only completely true in the 
infinity; however, one can find a boundary distance where the errors due to the 
approximation become negligible. The definition of what is negligible is slightly 
different in the microwave and optical regimes. In the microwave regime, a more 
conservative definition than in the optical regime is usually taken: Differences in 
the path length smaller than a sixteenth of the wavelength between the individual 
contributions and a contribution coming from the origin of the coordinate system 
are allowed in the microwave far-field region [23]. Instead, path length differences 
of an octave of the wavelength are allowed in the optical regime [24].
To calculate the value of the boundary between the near- and far-field re­
gions, let us start by specifying the path length r
r

infinitesimal contributions in the reflector aperture to the observation point

In the analysis of the fields in the Fraunhofer region, only the first three terms 
of (4.2) are included, whereas we need also the fourth term for calculating the 
fields in the Fresnel region. Therefore, the impact of this last term determines the 
boundary between the two regions. In the microwave regime, this term is usually 
neglected when it is smaller than a sixteenth of the wavelength, leading to a phase 
error smaller than π/8. By imposing this phase limit, one arrives at the definition 
of the boundary distance between the near- and far-field regions:

Figure 4.4 shows the field radiated at 600 GHz by a symmetric parabolic re­
flector with a diameter of 10 cm and a uniform illumination. It has been simulated 
by the commercial antenna software package GRASP [25]. This software will be 
used for all of the simulations shown in this chapter. Figure 4.4(a) shows an xz-cut 
of the radiated field by such a reflector. The white lines represent the spherical cuts 
where the field is computed as shown in Figure 4.4(b). In that figure, the solid curve 
represents the far-field distribution, while all the other curves show the field com­
puted in the near region at different spherical cuts defined by different distances R 
from the aperture center. The far-field boundary is located at R = 20m or R = 40m 
considering the optical or microwave phase error limit, respectively. From Figure 
4.5(b) it is evident that for distances above the optical boundary the differences be­
tween the normalized field patterns are very small. Below this boundary, the main 
beam starts to widen, clearly affecting the quality of the focused pattern. 
Considering this same example, if we need to image a target at a distance Rf 
lower than 20m, we need a better focused field at this distance than the ones shown 
in Figure 4.4(b). Thus we need to introduce a proper quadratic phase distribution 
over the reflector aperture. This phase distribution can be achieved either by us­
ing a parabolic reflector and defocusing its feed location or by using an elliptical 
reflector. The defocusing option does not introduce a perfect quadratic phase on 
the reflector aperture and, therefore, the radiated field can suffer from aberrations. 
4.2.2  Field in the Target Plane of a Focusing Reflector
When we are imaging in the Fresnel region, the main reflector should be an ellipti­
cal one as described previously. In this case, the target plane will be located at the

secondary focus of the ellipse [see Figure 4.3(b)]. To obtain an expression for the 
field in this target plane, we can use Appendix 4A, where an analytical expression 
of the field in the focal plane of a generic focusing reflector is derived assuming a

where Rf is the target distance and e(x′, y′) is the equivalent aperture field gener­
ated in the elliptical reflector by a series of plane waves coming from the first focus, 
excluding the quadratic phase distribution necessary to focus at Rf. In the case of a 
symmetrical elliptical reflector with large Rf /D, the polarization effect of the reflec­
tor on the aperture field can be neglected mx(x′, y′) = 1 and kz ≈ k. Thus, (4.3) can

Equation (4.5) is the same expression as the one obtained in [21], which was 
derived starting from the scalar diffraction field. A similar procedure will lead to 
the derivation of a similar expression for the magnetic field in the target plane of 
a focusing reflector. Therefore, one can conclude that the target field of a focusing 
aperture with large Rf /D has all the properties of the far field, that is, the field am­
plitude is proportional to the Fourier transform of the aperture distribution, and 
the electric and magnetic field are orthogonal and related by the free-space wave 
impedance. 
Equation (4.5) also implies that the field distribution in the target region is 
nearly independent of the location of its focal point, provided it is not too close to 
the antenna. Indeed, the Fraunhofer field of a parabolic reflector and the Fresnel 
field of an elliptical reflector with large Rf /D number are equivalent. Therefore, 
also for elliptical reflectors the same techniques of modification of the field aper­
ture used for parabolic reflectors can be exploited to reduce the sidelobes and for 
beam shaping. Figure 4.5(a) shows a comparison of the near field of an elliptical 
reflector focusing at Rf = 2.5m, with the far field of a parabolic reflector having 
the same diameter and focal distance F as the elliptical reflector (see Figure 4.3).

4.2.3  General Properties of the Field in the Target Plane
4.2.3.1  Resolution
One of the most important parameters in an imaging system is the resolution be­
cause it is directly related to the possibility of distinguishing two objects in an im­
age. There are two main definitions of resolution depending on whether the desired 
imaging is coherent or incoherent. For coherent imaging, where the receiver couples 
to the electric field distribution generated by the reflector on the focal plane (e.g., 
heterodyne receiver), the resolution is usually established to be equal to the an­
tenna half-power beamwidth (HPBW) [26], that is, one-way HPBW. In reality, the 
imaging resolution of a coherent imager will also depend on the antenna pattern 
sidelobes and actual directivity achieved. In contrast, for incoherent radiometric 
imaging, the brightness in the FoV is typically reconstructed by resorting to Fourier 
transformations (FT) of samples acquired over the entire focal plane. Because these 
samples are obtained as convolutions of the real brightness and the radiotelescope 
antenna pattern, as discussed in [26, 27], this procedure limits the resolution to 
HPBW/2. 
If we considered only the HPBW as a measure of the resolution, the best reso­
lution (i.e., the smallest resolution) that can be obtained with a certain reflector 
diameter is when it is uniformly illuminated. In the optical domain, an imaging 
system providing the smallest possible resolution is usually referred to as diffrac­
tion limited. 
The field in the target plane of a focusing reflector with a uniform circular 
aperture can be calculated from (4.5). One only needs to use the Fourier trans­
form of a circ function [i.e., a constant function defined on a circular domain with

A third definition for resolution is for active coherent imaging systems when 
the transmitter and receiver patterns are the same (e.g., the Tx and Rx antennas are 
placed at the focal point of the reflector). In such a case, the resolution is defined by 
taking into consideration the antenna pattern to the second power (i.e., |E|2), that 
is, the two-way HPBW. By finding the –3-B distance of (4.6) to the second power, 
the two-way HPBW can be calculated to be:

4.2.3.2  Depth of Focus
Imaging reflector systems based on ellipsoidal reflectors are designed to have a 
well-focused beam at a certain distance Rf where the object to be imaged is located. 
Unlike with parabolic-based systems, where the beam angular profile remains the 
same from the far-field region boundary to the infinity, the elliptical-based systems 
are only well focused over a certain region along the axial direction that depends 
on the Fresnel number

. Figure 4.6 shows the near field, calculated with 
GRASP, along the axial direction of an elliptical reflector focusing at Rf = 2.5m for 
two different Fresnel numbers. This field is characterized by having a maximum at 
a z-quote smaller than the target distance Rf. This effect is called focal shift and it 
has been studied by many authors [28]. However, note that even if the maximum 
peak of the field is at a different location, the field at the target distance Rf is always 
well focused, as has been shown in earlier examples. Therefore, when designing 
imaging reflector systems for a specific focusing distance, this shift can, in practice, 
be ignored. Actually, the near-field distribution due to a parabolic reflector also 
presents a localized maximum along the axial direction before it is well focused [see 
Figure 4.4(a)]. In contrast, this shift is relevant when defining the depth of focus of 
the imaging system, that is, the region where the field remains well focused, as we 
will see next.
Figure 4.6 also shows, for comparison purposes, the approximated electrical 
field along the axis calculated with the expression derived in [29] and reported 
here:

Starting from this formula, one can calculate the position of the maximum

Figure 4.7(a) shows such a shift, as a function of the Fresnel number, when the 
root of (4.10) has been found both numerically or with expression (4.11). It can be 
seen from the figure that this approximate expression is only valid for N > 5.
The most relevant parameter for imaging applications is the axial HPBW, ∆zH­
PBW, which defines the axial region with a field decay of less than 3 dB with respect 
to its maximum at Rf + ∆Rf. By using this parameter, we can define an axial region 
where the field is well focused, usually referred as depth of focus in the optical 
domain. Figure 4.7(b) shows the axial HPBW as a function of the Fresnel number 
calculated through (4.9). By considering only the first term of the right side of such 
equation, an approximate expression of such axial width can also be calculated as 
follows:

This expression agrees with the one given in [30], where tapered apertures are 
also considered. Figure 4.7(b) also shows the approximate expression for the axial 
HPBW for comparison. Again, the approximate expression is only valid for N > 5.
For large Fresnel numbers, the axial field amplitude distribution around the 
focus is symmetric because the first term on the right side of (4.9) is almost equal 
to unity. In such a case, the field is symmetric around zmax = Rf + ∆Rf, and we can 
easily define a region where the field remains well focused as [zmax – ∆zHPBW/2, zmax 
+ ∆zHPBW/2]. Instead, when there is a significant focal shift, that is, N < 5, the radi­
ated field along the axial distance is not symmetric with respect to either the focal 
distance Rf or with respect to the maximum field at zmax. Indeed, the transverse 
near-field field quality presents a very rapid decay for axial distances smaller than 
zmax due to diffraction effects. In this situation, it is more difficult to define the 
depth of focus. In these cases, as a rule of thumb, we can say that the axial region 
where the field remains well focused is approximately [zmax, zmax + ∆zHPBW]. Figure 
4.8 shows the field at the extremes of the depth-of-focus region, for two different 
Fresnel numbers, with the field at the target plane.
4.2.3.3  Refocusing
We have just said that a focusing reflector has a limited axial region where the field 
remains focused. In remote terahertz imaging applications, especially for large dis­
tance security applications, the target is not stationary and the system is required 
to perform images at different distances. Therefore, a way of changing the target 
distance is needed, that is, a method for refocusing. Here we are going to study a 
simple symmetrical elliptical reflector. A large amount of literature can be found 
on complicated zooming systems (see [31] for instance), especially those that use 
dielectric lenses in the optical domain and all-refractive mirrors in the infrared.

Considering the elliptical reflector shown in Figure 4.9, a displacement ∆zf 
along the axial direction of the feed will be translated into a shift ∆Rf of the target 
focusing distance. This is because the defocusing of the feed modifies the quadratic 
phase distribution over the reflector aperture. Figure 4.10 shows the simulated 
Figure 4.8  Fields radiated at the target plane and extremes of the depth of focus region for the 
same two cases shown in Figure 4.6: (a) N = 2 and (b) N = 50. The insets show the radiated field in

fields for the N = 2 case previously studied in Figure 4.8, where a defocusing shift 
of ±∆zf /F = 0.01 has been considered. Figure 4.10(a) shows the fields radiated 
along the axial direction. Once again, there is a focal shift with respect to the opti­
mal focus associated with the maximum of the axial field amplitude. Figure 4.10(b) 
shows the transversal fields at the refocused target plane in each case. It is worth 
nothing that the curves related to the field of a focused or refocused system, when 
plotted as a function of x/z, are identical. This is because the target field is propor­
tional to the Fourier transform of the aperture current distribution as indicated in 
(4.5) and evaluated on x/z and y/z.
 One can also change the focusing distance of a parabolic reflector from infinity 
to a certain close distance Rf by displacing the feed away from the reflector. This 
solution provides good results as long as the reflector aperture is symmetric or has 
a small offset displacement from the axis of revolution.
Table 4.1 provides an overview of all the properties of the target field that have 
been discussed in this section.
4.2.4  Equivalence Between Offset Parabolic and Elliptical Reflectors
All previous examples have been oriented to symmetrical reflectors. In this case, it 
is straightforward to establish an equivalence between a parabolic and an elliptical 
reflector—we need merely to assume that both reflectors have the same feed focal 
distance, F, and that the target distance of the elliptical reflector is equal to Rf = F 
+ 2c, where c is the distance between the ellipse foci (see Figure 4.3 for clarification 
of the geometry). 
Let us now consider an offset parabolic reflector, as shown in Figure 4.11(a), 
with a circular projected aperture, D. A geometrical mapping of the parabolic main 
reflector to the corresponding elliptical reflector can be done as proposed in [32]. 
This mapping consists of having the same values of the central ray L and the offset 
distance Xo for both types of reflectors, as well as having the secondary focus of 
the elliptical reflector in front of the aperture at the desired focusing distance Rf. 
In such a case the axis of revolution of the ellipse is tilted with respect to that of 
the parabolic reflector; therefore, this mapping allows us to maintain the same 
Figure 4.9  Geometry of an elliptical reflector with a defocusing of the feed, ∆zf.

4.2  Reflector Systems Focusing in the Fresnel Region

definition for the aperture dimensions, D. However, this mapping leads to slightly 
larger values for the cross-polarized focused field with respect to the far field gener­
ated by the equivalent parabolic reflector. This is associated with the fact that the 
Figure 4.10  Field along the (a) axial direction and (b) at the refocused distance simulated by GRASP 
for the N = 2 case of Figure 4.6 and a defocusing shift of ±∆zf/F = 0.01. The field with no defocusing 
is also shown for comparison.

offset portion of the ellipse being used, with respect to the axis of revolution, is 
larger due to the axis of revolution tilt. 
Instead, a different mapping can also be considered when the axis of revolu­
tion is not tilted with respect to the parabola axis, as shown in Figure 4.11(b). This 
mapping leads to similar levels for the cross-polarized field. In this case, the ellipti­
cal surface is defined by means of the major axis distance 2a = Rf + L, and the foci 
distance 2c. However, in this case, the reflector aperture is tilted by an angle α. To 
establish the equivalence, both reflectors need to have the same aperture dimen­
sions, D, as indicated in Figure 4.11. Figure 4.12 shows the field simulated with 
GRASP for the parabolic and an equivalent elliptical offset reflector that focuses 
at 2.5m. The geometrical parameters of these two reflectors are provided in Tables

4.2 and 4.3. One can appreciate the similarities of all of the radiated field compo­
nents, even at the level of the cross-polarization ones. Small differences are appreci­
ated in the cross-polarization field because of the relatively close focusing distance. 
Thanks to this equivalence, one can use the classical design formulation for 
multireflector systems based on a parabolic reflector as the main antenna (e.g., 
compensation of cross-polarization, reduction of off-focus aberrations) with an

equivalent main elliptical reflector. Several examples of this equivalence are shown 
later in this chapter.
4.3  Imaging with Focal Plane Arrays
Figure 4.13 shows a typical configuration representing the key parameters of an 
imaging system obtained with a FPA. A multibeam antenna is then achieved by 
placing an array of antennas at the focal plane of a reflector, characterized with 
diameter D and focal distance F. When an antenna is laterally displaced from the 
reflector focal point, the field radiated by the reflector is scanned toward a certain 
angle θout, as shown in Figure 4.13. This angle can be calculated as θout = BDFθin 
[33], where BDF stands for beam deviation factor. Therefore, an array located at 
the focal plane of a reflector antenna, usually referred as a focal plane array (FPA), 
generates multiple independent beams pointing to different directions in the FoV, 
which can image multiple pixels simultaneously (as much as array elements) and, 
correspondingly, decrease the acquisition time of the image. 
When designing a FPA for imaging applications, the most important parameter 
is the sampling of the focal plane by the array elements, that is, the spacing d of 
the array. The optimum sampling in terms of antenna efficiency and acquisition 
time depends on the imaging architecture (active or passive system, coherent or 
incoherent). The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is directly proportional to the reflector 
illumination efficiency and will play a key role in the FPA optimization. 
Terahertz imaging systems can be distinguished between narrowband and 
broadband systems, depending on the frequency characteristics associated with the 
detectors considered. Terahertz active imaging systems, in which the S/N can be 
increased by generating more power if high-power sources and amplifiers are avail­
able, are generally narrowband systems. The most common active imaging systems

are heterodyne systems with microwave types of detectors (i.e., semiconductor di­
odes). In this case, the sampling of the FPA can be simply optimized at the central 
frequency of the band as described in Section 4.3.2. 
Instead, passive systems are usually designed with broadband detectors to im­
prove the S/N, which makes the selection of the sampling difficult. Moreover, the 
optimum sampling in this case also depends on the type of source that we are 
imaging (isolated or continuous), on whether the receiver is background limited 
or quantum noise limited, and on the noise generated by signals coming from the 
instrument itself. All these aspects are addressed in Section 4.3.3.
4.3.1  Relationship Between the Reflector Aperture Efficiency and the Power 
Received by an Antenna in the Focal Plane of the Reflector
The S/N of any imaging system is directly proportional to the actual power received 
by the antennas in the FPA. Therefore, to optimize the sampling of the focal plane in 
terms of acquisition speed by keeping a certain level of the S/N, we need to calculate 
this received power. It is proportional to the actual illumination efficiency of the 
reflector (i.e., the aperture efficiency) as we will show next. 
In (4A.13) of Appendix 4A at the end of this chapter, an analytical expression 
for this received power is provided for a plane wave impinging on the reflector from 
(a, b) with an amplitude Ee(a, b). This expression can be simplified if we consider 
the following specific case: The antenna is modeled by a magnetic current distribu­
tion along x as described in Appendix 4C, the incident plane wave on the reflector 
is polarized along y, and the reflector is characterized by large F/D numbers. Under 
these assumptions (

The exponential terms in (4.17) are related to the antenna location and the 
direction of the incoming plane wave. The aperture efficiency will be maximized 
when these phase terms cancel out, which occurs when the antenna is placed at xn 
= F sin b cos a and yn = F sin b sin a.
Equation (4.17) can be transformed into spherical coordinates by using an an­
gular parameterization of the reflector aperture where x′ = F tan θ cos φ and y′ = F 
tan θ sin φ. In such a case, (4.17) becomes:

Reflector Antennas for Terahertz Imaging Applications
Both (4.17) and (4.19) lead to the same results, meaning that one can calculate 
the reflector aperture efficiency either on the reflector aperture, by using the Fou­
rier transform of the antenna current distribution, or in the antenna plane by using 
the Airy pattern. Moreover, these expressions (valid for F/D > 1.5), calculated in 
reception, lead to the same efficiency values calculated by using the standard defini­
tions of spillover ηso and taper efficiencies  ηt, as given in [23], which are calculated 
in transmission. The aperture efficiency in transmission is obtained as the product 
of the spillover and taper efficiencies (i.e., ηap = ηtηso).
As an example we consider a reflector antenna with F/D = 3 illuminated by 
the two different antenna feed aperture distributions described in Appendix 4B: 
a uniform distribution and a –16-dB taper distribution. The far field patterns for 
both distributions are shown in Figure 4.14(a). Figure 4.14(b) shows the spillover 
and taper reflector efficiencies for a fixed F/D = 3 as a function of the feed diameter 
when calculated with the definitions provided in [23]. Figure 4.14(b) also shows 
the aperture efficiencies calculated with (4.17) and (4.19) or equivalently in trans­
mission by ηap = ηtηso.
4.3.2  Focal Plane Sampling in Active Systems 
Let us consider an active imaging system realized with a FPA. The source of the ac­
tive system can be located either outside the reflector imaging system leading to a 
broad illumination of the target, or inside the reflector imaging system leading to a 
single pixel illuminated each time. In the first case, the resolution of the system will 
be the one-way HPBW, and the antennas in the FPA will receive power that comes 
from directions all over the target (i.e., different plane waves are arriving at the re­
flector). In such a case, FPA sampling should be optimized by computing the electric 
field generated by all of these plane waves. However, in most terrestrial applica­
tions, the active systems are designed with the transmitter and receiver inside the 
reflector system to illuminate and measure a single pixel with each antenna pointing 
direction. Such a configuration leads to significantly larger signal to noise levels 
and better resolution (i.e., two-way HPBW), but at the cost of higher technologi­
cal complexity. In this case, the sampling of the FPA can be done by optimizing the 
received signal from a single plane wave (i.e., by maximizing the reflector aperture 
efficiency). Actually, the received signal also depends on the reflector illumination 
of the transmitter, which as demonstrated previously, is the same as the efficiency 
in reception if the same antennas are used in the transmitter and receiver. In the fol­
lowing, the optimum FPA sampling of this second case is addressed in detail.
Three parameters characterize the performance of a FPA system: the antenna 
pointing direction separation, ∆θ; the reflector diameter, D; and the focal distance, 
F (see Figure 4.13). Let us consider a parabolic reflector focusing at infinity. The 
beam separation ∆θ in the FoV can be approximated for a relatively low number of 
scanned beams where BFD ≈ 1 as follows:

Note that, if instead of a parabolic reflector, an elliptical reflector focusing at a 
distance Rf is considered, the beams in the FoV will be separated by a distance  ∆ρ = 
∆θ Rf. For the rest of this section, for the sake of simplicity, we will derive the trade-
offs for a parabolic reflector, because the same conclusions can be extrapolated to 
the elliptic reflector case.
In a fully sampled imaging system, the beam separation should be the same 
as the resolution, which in a two-way active system is associated with the two-
way HPBW. From the previous section, we know that for a uniform aperture:

which will be referred to from now on as the single sampling case. Figure 4.15 
shows the antenna beams generated in the FoV by a FPA sampled following the 
condition of (4.21). 
Let us now consider what (4.21) implies in terms of reflector illumination effi­
ciency. From Figure 4.14(b) it is evident that the spillover efficiency improves as the 
diameter of the feed increases. However, in a FPA, this diameter is limited by the 
sampling condition as given in (4.21). Since the feed diameter for a two-way system 
and F/D = 3 is limited to 2.22 wavelengths, the spillover loss for a uniform feed will

be –5.5 dB (the received signal in a two-way system will be affected twice by this 
loss). This efficiency problem in the single sampling condition is independent of the 
F/D ratio because the feed aperture is in any case limited by the sampling condition, 
which is directly proportional to F/D. This means that a very significant part of the 
power is lost. To avoid such a high loss, it is convenient to design the FPA using a 
double or third sampling condition: 
	
two-way
d
0.74
n
F
D
l
≅
	
(4.22)
where n is the sampling order (i.e., n = 1, 2,3, ...). Increasing this sampling order 
allows us to use larger apertures and improve reflector efficiency. For the double 
condition, the aperture efficiency loss is reduced to -1.6 dB. Obviously, the fo­
cal plane will not be fully sampled, and half of the beams will be missing (see the 
dashed lines in Figure 4.15). In this case, it is common to use a technique called 
jiggling [34], which is used, for example, in the Herschel telescope. It consists of 
rotating a small mirror to cover the missing beams. To optimize the focal plane and 
the speed, a trade-off between the system S/N and acquisition speed to cover the 
FoV should be done.
Actually, the optimum aperture efficiency obtained for a uniform feed is 
achieved at a feed diameter of around 5.3 wavelengths as shown in Figure 4.14(b). 
This efficiency is limited to about 72%, due to the high sidelobes associated to 
the distribution given in (4B.6) (see Appendix 4B). To improve this efficiency, one 
can use a tapered field distribution on the feed aperture. For instance, the -16-dB 
distribution given in (4B.8) gives an 82% efficiency for a feed diameter of 6.4 
wavelengths. To achieve this aperture efficiency in the two-way system, one would 
need to use the third sampling condition leading to a feed maximum diameter of 
6.6 wavelengths.
The reflector taper efficiency is important for imaging applications because it 
is directly related to the resolution, that is, the HPBW. As a rule of thumb, we can 
calculate how much the one-way HPBW increases when the reflector is not illumi­
nated uniformly as would be the case for the double or third sampling conditions. 
For that, we can recall that the taper efficiency relates the achieved directivity dir 
with the maximum directivity dirmax that one could obtain from the reflector ap­
erture, that is, ηt = dir/dirmax. Then, by considering the Kraus approximation for 
directive rotationally symmetric patterns [23], that is, dir ≈ 4π/∆θ2HPWB, we can 
compute the increase of the resolution Xres as a function of the taper efficiency. 
Note that this approximation is done for antennas having a single main lobe. For a 
two-way system, this increase will affect the system twice; therefore:

This means that the sampling conditions calculated before are affected by this 
resolution factor, that is, the actual condition will be scaled by Xres. For the previ­
ous example, we have an increase of Xres = 12% for the –16 dB taper feed aperture

at the third sampling condition. This means that the array spacing can actually be 
increased by approximately 12% [ (4.22) is actually 0.74

] and the antenna 
diameters can be kept to 6.4 wavelengths, giving some room for the fabrication of 
the array antennas. 
Equation (4.22) is appropriate when we are dealing with a linear FPA (one 
dimension). However, the sampling of the FoV in a two-dimensional (2D) array 
has to take into account the lattice of the array itself as well. For example, let us 
consider a standard 2D FPA (see Figure 4.13) with a square lattice with the element 
spacing d fixed by the single sampling condition. The black circles in Figure 4.16(a) 
represent the footprint on the target plane generated by the HPBW of the different 
antenna patterns created by the different pointing directions associated with each 
array element position. One can observe that along the vertical and horizontal 
axes, the beams overlap just at the HPBW level, and these directions are correctly 
sampled. In contrast, there are unsampled spots along the φ = 45-deg direction. To 
eliminate these spots, and have a fully sampled FoV, the single sampling condition 
needs to be more restrictive by including a factor associated with the array lattice: 
Xlattice = cos α with α being the lattice skew angle of periodicity (see Figure 4.13). 
In summary, a general expression for the sampling condition including the ar­
ray lattice and taper factors can be derived as follows:

res

X X

≅
	
(4.24)
The lattice factor reduces further the sampling spacing and therefore the reflec­
tor illumination efficiency of the FPA. For the previous example, the array element 
aperture would be limited to 4.7λ for the third spacing condition leading to a reflec­
tor illumination loss of -1.5 dB. 
It is well known that better FoV coverage is obtained with a hexagonal lattice 
where α = 30 deg, as shown in Figures 4.13 and 4.17. If we do not consider, for 
the moment, the lattice factor on the sampling condition, the illumination effi­
ciency of the reflector is the same as that of the square array of Figure 4.16(a), but 
with better coverage over the FoV as evident when comparing Figures 4.16(a) and 
4.17(a). Nevertheless, there are still some spots missing along the 60-deg direction. 
To reduce these spots, we need to apply the lattice factor to the sampling condition 
leading to the footprint of Figure 4.17(b) and obtaining a slightly larger spacing 
than a square FPA. In the example before, the third sampling condition would be 
5.7λ and the spillover loss -0.9dB for a -16-dB taper feed aperture.
Let us now briefly consider the double sampling condition and the jiggling 
mechanism. The footprint of the FPA in the imaging plane is shown in Figures 
4.18(a) and 4.18(b) for the rectangular and hexagonal lattice cases, respectively, 
when a double sampling condition that includes the lattice factor is applied. The 
gray circles are the beams directly generated by the FPA. To fully cover the FoV, 
we need to put into the reflector system a mirror that by wobbling displaces the 
footprint in different directions (jiggling). For the square lattice, the mirror has to 
wobble in four directions to virtually displace the FPA and fully cover the FoV, as 

4.3  Imaging with Focal Plane Arrays

graphically shown in Figure 4.18(a) with different dashed line circles. Similarly, in 
the case of the hexagonal lattice, the FPA has to be displaced virtually by the four 
positions shown in Figure 4.18(b). Instead, if we use the double sampling condition 
without the lattice factor, we would need to displace the footprint in eight different 
positions, as shown in Figure 4.18(c).

Table 4.4 summarizes for different sampling conditions for the two-way loss 
in the reflector illumination for the case of a –16-dB taper aperture, together with 
the factor of increase of the image acquisition time. This factor is directly propor­
tional to the number of pointing directions needed by the jiggling mechanism to 
fully cover the FoV. The final system implementation is a trade-off between the

maximum loss permitted (i.e., larger FPA spacing), the mutual coupling between 
the active elements that can affect the performances of an active systems, and the 
image acquisition speed. 
4.3.3  Focal Plane Sampling in Passive Systems
The purpose of radiometric imaging is to obtain the spectral distribution of the 
incoming radiation for every point in the FoV. This is a typical application for tera­
hertz imaging in astronomy applications, where large FPAs can be fabricated by 
using superconducting or bolometer-type detectors. In such a case, the speed of the 
image acquisition is ultimately limited by the S/N at the receivers, which affects the 
necessary integration time for each pixel to image the FoV with enough sensitivity. 
As discussed in a key article [35], different focal plane architectures with ad­
vantages and disadvantages in terms of relative observing speed can be calculated 
on the basis of reasonable assumptions and typical array parameters. A typical 
configuration representing the key parameters of a radiometric telescope system 
is shown, in a 2D view, in Figure 4.13. During two-way active imaging, as well 
as in a typical telecommunication multibeam application, every beam of the FPA 
looks in a separate direction. For radiometric purposes, the brightness in the sky 
is reconstructed by resorting to Fourier transformation (FT) of samples acquired 
over the entire focal plane. As discussed in [26, 27], this process sets a lower limit 
to the resolution ∆θ = 0.5λ/D and, correspondingly, to the smallest useful separa­
tion between the different focal plane elements (d = 0.5 F/D). Larger samplings d 
would normally lead to lower resolutions; however, this effect can be compensated 
for by jiggling the telescope pointing direction, as explained in the previous section. 
Clearly the observation time with this mode of operation grows proportionally to 
the number of positions that have to be filled (i.e., to the pixel integration time). 
In the following we discuss different array sampling configurations and compare 
them in terms of acquisition speed. To do this, we will focus on a square array 
configuration and consider three sampling cases: d0.5 = 0.5 F/Dλ, d1 = F/Dλ, and d2 
= 2 F/Dλ. These sampling are associated with the standard half, single, and double 
conditions, without including the lattice and taper factors for the sake of simplic­
ity. The extension to the cases that include those factors will be straightforward by 
using the formalism introduced here.
The quantity of interest to optimize the acquisition speed is the S/N after the 
detection. This ratio can be related, as detailed in Appendix 4D, to the integration 
time, the postdetection bandwidth, and the two major contributions to the noise in 
passive detectors: the receiver and photon noises. The relative weight of these two 
noises can be quantified by introducing a constant  that is equal to 0 when the pho­
ton noise is dominating (background limited detectors) and equal to 1 when the re­
ceiver noise is instead dominating. Overall, the required integration time, provided 
in (4D.4) (see Appendix 4D), depends on the useful (signal) power received 
e
nP  as 
well as the contribution coming from the instrument itself 
i
nP , which is typically 
referred to as the instrument background contribution.
The optimal radiometric mapping of the sub-millimeter-wave spectrum of the 
sky leads to different antenna designs depending on the distributed or isolated 
nature of the sources. While the isolated sources case typically leads to the same 
antenna trade-offs that are also used in telecom and radar designs (see previous 

4.3  Imaging with Focal Plane Arrays 
179
section), where the aperture efficiency is maximized, the distributed sources cases 
lead to more compact array designs. 
As a test case, we will assume that the reflector system is perfectly focalizing; 
this means that a single point source at infinity, generating a plane wave, and im­
pinging on the main reflector aperture, is mapped in the focal plane as a clean 
Airy pattern. This  hypothesis is verified for large F/D ratios. In this section we 
use the formulation derived in Appendix 4B to optimize the acquisition speed ver­
sus the FPA sampling by computing analytically the fraction of power received, 
e
nP , by each antenna in a focal plane array for both types of sources, isolated and 
distributed.
4.3.3.1  Isolated Sources
For the case in which an isolated point source is much stronger than the other con­
tributions, the received power is expressed as a function of the coupling efficiency 
related to the squared reaction integral between the aperture field distribution and 
the Airy pattern of the reflector, accounting for the proper phase associated with the 
alignment of the source, and the feed in the focal plane, as derived in (4.19). 
The optimum speed, that is, the shortest integration time expressed in (4D.4), 
for an isolated source is obtained when maximizing the received signal, which is 
equivalent to maximizing the coupling efficiency of the aperture distribution to the 
Airy pattern generated by the point source on the focal plane. Figure 4.19 shows 
Figure 4.19  Coupling efficiency for a point source on axis incident on a F/D = 3 reflector and a re­
ceiving antenna aperture of 2F/Dλ versus the field taper in the antenna. The inset shows the Airy pat­
tern generated by the reflector together with an antenna field distribution with a –16 dB field taper.

erture edge [see (4B.7)]. The coupling efficiency is maximized for a taper of –16 dB. 
The inset of Figure 4.19 shows the Airy pattern together with the antenna distribu­
tion for a 2F/Dλ sampling case.
Now we can take the –16-dB taper antenna and 2F/Dλ sampling FPA as a 
baseline for comparison with other FPA configurations. To compare the acquisition 
speed, we can calculate the ratio between the speeds of the different configurations 
by assuming that the same type of detector is used in all configurations and there 
is no instrument contribution to the noise. This ratio can then be computed as the 
summation of the powers received in each element of the arrays, (4.16), as follows:

where sp is the acquisition speed of the generic pth FPA configuration.
Figure 4.20 shows the speed ratios for these FPAs with respect to the baseline 
as a function of the antenna field taper. If the source is on axis, the -16-dB 2F/Dλ 
sampling case will always be the optimal one because it maximizes the reflector ef­
ficiency. This is because the smaller apertures cannot be as efficient as the perfectly 
matched distribution when the latter is aligned with the incoming signal. Even so, 
the smaller cells will still contribute with a portion of the power, and that is why 
these cases are not too bad in terms of speed.

However, when the point source position is not known, the 2F/Dλ case has a 
drawback: The system has to be aligned with the actual source position because 
of the missing beams in the FoV. Therefore, the antenna system needs first to look 
for the actual position of the source. Known search algorithms typically imply a 
certain loss of time that can be quantified in about 0.66 of loss of efficiency [35]. 
Thus, when comparing the optimal case with the multiple subpixel architectures, 
one should consider this loss of time in the denominator of (4.25). Figure 4.20 also 
shows the speed ratio for this case, where the 0.5F/Dλ sampling is slightly faster 
than the 2F/Dλ when uniform apertures are considered.
4.3.3.2  Noncoherent Distributed Sources
Let us now consider the case in which we would like to image noncoherent distrib­
uted sources. This case can be modeled as a series of plane waves impinging on the 
reflector distributed over angles up to βmax. Because the different plane waves are 
incoherent, the total power received by the antenna will be directly calculated as the 
summation of all the powers associated with each of the plane waves (α, β):

The actual received power can only be calculated when the radiation distribu­

the average of the received power from a continuous distribution of noncoherent 
sources and use this information for the optimization of the FPA sampling. The 
average power received by the antenna can then be calculated as:

 is the average Poynting vector of the source in the FoV (i.e.,

When comparing arrays with half, single, and double sampling conditions, it 
is apparent that the option d0.5 implies a need for 16 times more elements to cover 
the entire focal plane than the d2 configuration. This could be prohibitive if the re­
ceiver’s costs are dominant in the overall architecture; however, this is typically not 
the case in a space science context with cryogenic detectors. Moreover, different 
samplings also imply that the beams arising from the d2 configuration map the field

of view at larger intervals, as explained previously (see Figure 4.18). The voids can 
be imagined to be filled with successive orientations of the main dish or by jiggling 
a small mirror to achieve, eventually, the maximum resolution of the d0.5 case. In 
the following we use τp to indicate the acquisition time and np = 4/p2 (with p = 0.5, 
1, 2) to indicate the number of receivers in the area defined by the double sampling 
condition that corresponds to each configurations. The configuration dp covers 
a field of view region in τp16/np, which accounts for the time of each acquisition 
multiplied per the number of required movements. As a consequence, the speed 
of acquisition of configuration p is

First we will assume that the instrument is sufficiently cold so that the internal 
contribution to the noise is negligible. Then, when the average power received

Let us consider two specific cases: an FPA of corrugated horns with a 100% 
horn aperture efficiency, that is, the field over the horn aperture is uniform in am­
plitude and phase; and a FPA of lenses with a -16 dB taper aperture (these lenses 
are fed by an antenna with an appropriate lens edge taper). Figure 4.21 shows the 
speed ratio between FPAs at 0.5F/Dλ and F/Dλ samplings with respect to a double 
sampling FPA having an antenna with a -16-dB taper. Looking at the antenna ef­
ficiencies in (4.30), it is apparent that the aperture efficiency is the one that is most 
drastically affected by the physical dimension of the antennas in the focal plane 
and, therefore, will drive the trade-off. For these examples, we assume that all the 
antennas are perfectly matched and have no losses. From Figure 4.21 it is evident 
that it is more convenient to use a 0.5F/Dλ sampling, even if the spillover loss is 
larger anyway than in the other sampling cases. This is because we are assuming 
no noise contribution from the instrument itself; therefore, the spillover does not 
really contribute to the noise. The use of 0.5F/Dλ sampling for antennas has usually 
been avoided [26, 35, 36] because it is understood that the antenna performances 
degrades when the aperture is small. This is indeed true, but only for F/D < 2.
Now we can study what happens if there is a contribution to the noise com­
ing from the instrument itself. The average power received by the detector can be 
computed using the effective height of the antenna as described in Appendix 4E. In

this case the ratio between the received powers from signals coming internally and 
externally to the reflector system will drive the speed optimization. This ratio can 
be expressed, by using (4.28) and (4E.3), as follows:

Figure 4.22 shows how the speed ratio of uniform apertures with respect to the 
-16 dB 2F/Dλ sampling case changes as a function of the ratio between the inter­
nal and external brightness. It is evident that the F/Dλ sampling case presents very 
small degradations in the performance provided that the internal brightness is less 
than 10% of the external one. Instead the 0.5F/Dλ sampling case starts to worsen 
already from a 1% of the external brightness.
4.3.4  Typical Reflector Systems
Systems with two reflectors are the preferred solution for designing multibeam 
imaging arrays because they present low off-axis scan degradations. A review of 
the design of dual-reflector systems can be found in [33]. Typical symmetrical

Reflector Antennas for Terahertz Imaging Applications
surface-based solutions, such as a Cassegrain or Gregorian system have been used 
successfully in a large number of terahertz instruments since they present very low 
degradation because of the surface symmetry.
One eminent example is the Cassegrain system designed for the Herschel tele­
scope [37]. The main drawback of such designs is the blockage of the electro­
magnetic wave by the secondary reflector, which leads to a reduction of the use­
ful antenna aperture and an increase in the sidelobes. Therefore, frequently, offset 
surface-based solutions are preferred, such as in the case of the Planck telescope 
[37]. Offset surface portions introduce a significant amount of cross-polarization 
(see Figure 4.12) and very poor off-axis scan performances. To reduce these draw­
backs, dual-reflector systems, both Cassegrain and Gregorian, with compensated 
cross-polarization (i.e., to fulfill the Mizuguchi condition) have been designed [38] 
leading to the possibility of using large FPAs. 
A considerable amount of information can be found in the literature on design­
ing cross-polarized compensated dual reflectors. For instance, in [38], some simple 
design rules are given for a Gregorian system. Taking these rules, the Gregorian 
system shown in Figure 4.23(a) has been designed with the main paraboloid re­
flector geometrical parameters being those of Table 4.2. The dimensions of the 
secondary reflector are given in Table 4.5. Figure 4.23(b) shows the radiated field, 
which has considerably reduced cross-polarization with respect to that shown in 
Figure 4.12. Applying the equivalence that we established in Section 4.1.5 between 
an offset paraboloid and ellipsoid, we can use the same Gregorian system to reduce 
also the cross-polarized field for a field focused in the Fresnel region. Figure 4.23(b)

shows the comparison between the far field and near field of the paraboloid and 
the equivalent ellipsoid system focusing at 2.5m (the dimensions of the elliptical 
mirror were given earlier in Table 4.3). The reduction of the cross-polarized field is 
slightly worse in the elliptical reflector because of the original small differences in 
the cross-polarized field of the offset reflectors shown in Figure 4.12.

Reflector Antennas for Terahertz Imaging Applications
The equivalence of the fields generated by the paraboloid and ellipsoidal reflec­
tors is not only valid for the central pattern, but also for the scanned patterns asso­
ciated with off-focus reflector feeds as long as the feed displacement from the focal 
point is relatively small. This means that we can also use dual-reflector systems 
optimized for focal plane arrays to design focusing imaging reflectors. Figure 4.24 
shows an example of such a system based on a Dragonian top-fed system designed 
following the rules provided in [39]. The geometry is shown in Figure 4.24(a) and 
the geometrical parameters are provided in Tables 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8. The radiated 
fields in the far and 2.5m near regions for a paraboloid and ellipsoid-based system, 
respectively, are shown in Figure 4.24(b) for both the center and scanned beam. 
The fields are indeed very similar up to the level of the sidelobes.
4.4  Imaging with Mechanical Scanners
To generate an image, the antenna reflector system needs to steer the beam along the 
whole FoV with the proper resolution. One possibility is to use FPAs (camera-like 
solution), as described in the previous section, which would require information 
to be acquired from several image pixels simultaneously. This is the most common 
solution for the passive detectors, such as bolometers or superconducting detectors 
[40, 41], commonly used for space applications and some terrestrial applications. 
Nevertheless, terahertz heterodyne detector array technology is still under develop­
ment [42], and most of the current state-of-the-art imaging systems based on this 
technology use antenna reflector systems integrated with mechanical scanners to 
generate the image [32]. 
4.4.1  Types of Mechanical Scanners
Two different types of motions can be used to realize mechanical scanners: transla­
tion and rotation. Rotation motors are usually preferred for designing terahertz an­
tenna systems aiming at long imaging distances and operating at close to real-time 
speeds. Although the translation of a reflector would perform beam steering, this 
type of motion is instead limited to small scanning ranges. In fact, the maximum 
velocity achievable for translation motors is slower than that for rotating motors. 
Therefore, translation motors are only used in terahertz imaging systems where the 
sample is displaced to create the image, such as in time domain spectrometers [43]. 
In such cases, the target is usually very close to the antenna system and the focus of 
the technology is not on the image acquisition speed but on the S/N.

By using rotating motors, it is possible to realize raster and conical scans. 
A raster scan consists of two rotating motors in two orthogonal directions (i.e.,

horizontal and vertical) as shown in Figure 4.25(a). The rotation velocity of the 
two motors will determine the footprint of the reflector scanning system at the 
target plane. Imagine that we want to create a staircase-type footprint, like that 
shown in Figure 4.25(b). The vertical motor rotates at a constant velocity to create 
a vertical line, then stops; and the horizontal one rotates at a constant velocity to 
displace the pointing direction to the next line. In this case one obtains the same 
footprint that is obtained using a 2D focal plane array. Therefore, to achieve a full 
sampling of the FoV, the raster scan rotation step or sampling step in both direc­
tions has to be:

The previous staircase movement creates a well-sampled FoV; however, it is 
very slow because only one motor is working each instant of time. Therefore, for 
applications requiring high acquisition speeds, one motor is usually rotated at a 
constant low speed (e.g., the horizontal one), whereas the other motor is acceler­
ated and decelerated at high speed. This solution has successfully been used in [44]. 
In this case, the footprint created by the raster scan will be like the one shown 
in Figure 4.25(c). In this case, the sampling has to be done at half the resolution

The vertical scanning can be accomplished with a fast precision rotator that 
accelerates for the first half of the scan and then decelerates for the second half to 
achieve a “bang-bang” control approach. The scan time of this configuration will 
be limited by the maximum motor torque. 
A different approach is to use a conical scanner where the mirror spins around 
a tilted axis of rotation, as shown in Figure 4.26. The rotation axis is tilted with 
respect to the normal direction of the mirror surface by an angle α. This tilt cre­
ates an elliptical footprint in the target plane. To study the rotation properties of 
the tilted spinning mirror, we need to calculate the dynamic vector normal to the 
mirror as follows:

= 2α, whereas the output ray azimuthal angle φo is equal to the spinning angle . 
Therefore, the footprint created by this conical scan is a circle. For a generic inci­
dence, we can compute the pointing direction (θ, φ) of the output ray by using the 
previous expressions. Figures 4.27(a) and 4.27(b) show the output angles as a func­
tion of the spinning angle, whereas Figure 4.27(c) shows the footprint generated

by the output ray. If the incident ray arrives with an incident angle θi, the output 
ray creates an elliptical footprint around the specular reflection ray (the one that 
we would obtain without any mirror tilt). The major axis of the generated ellipse 
is found in the same plane of the incident beam (i.e., ZX or φ = 0 in the example of 
Figure 4.26), and is equal to θ=2α, whereas there is a reduction of the output angle 
in the orthogonal plane (i.e., ZY or φ = 90), leading to a minor axis of the ellipse 
of θ = 2α cos(θi). Figure 4.27 shows the output ray angles and footprints for several 
incident angles.
To achieve a full 2D FoV by using such conical mirror, a second motion is 
needed. This second motion can be achieved by using a slow rotating motor in the 
horizontal direction in order to fully sample the FoV by displacing horizontally the 
elliptical footprint created by the conical mirror. This configuration will generate 
the footprint show in Figure 4.28(a). This is a common solution in airborne laser 
scanning systems [45]. The main advantage of this solution is that the fast rotating 
mirror can be spun at a constant angular velocity without the problem of torque 
due to the acceleration and deceleration mechanism. However, as can be seen from 
the footprint of Figure 4.28(a), the sampling of the FoV is not as uniform as it was 
for the raster scan. Note that some areas are well oversampled. To deal with this 
FoV oversampling and generate the image, special postprocessing algorithms are 
needed. This solution has successfully been applied in [46] and in [47, 48] where a 
linear array of detectors was used instead of the slow horizontal motor creating a 
similar footprint.

Another possibility is to use the second motor to change the tilt angle of the 
spinning mirror, α. By changing α, the radius of the circle created by the spinning 
mirror is also modified (i.e., the radius is 2α). Therefore, one can create a spiral 
footprint like the one shown in Figure 4.28(b). This is the solution that was used in 
[49]. Once again the image is oversampled; in this case, the oversampling is around 
the center of the FoV. 
More advance scanning systems can be obtained by more than one spinning 
mirror. Such systems are common in the infrared spectral region [50]. Let us

consider the geometry of Figure 4.29, where we have two rotating mirrors with 
the rotation axes tilted by α and α′, respectively. We can study the footprint gener­
ated by such a system by applying a ray-tracing analysis similar to that described 
in (4.35) and (4.36) for each of the two mirrors. The generated footprints, centered 
around the specular reflection, depend on the relative phase difference between the 
two spinning motors:
1.	 If the spinning motors are rotating in the same direction but out of phase, 
the generated footprint is an ellipse whose minor and major axis dimen­
sions depend on the phase difference between the motors, ψ. In this case, 
the spinning rotation angles are related by θ′m = θm + ψ. Figure 4.30 shows 
the output angle, with respect to the specular reflection, for different  phas­
es. For ψ = 0 the output major and minor axes are equal to θo=2(α+α′) and 
2(α+α′), respectively. For larger phases the ellipse axes are reduced until 
ψ = 180 degrees, where the footprint is basically a point. Using this con­
figuration, one could sample the whole FoV by progressively changing the 
phase difference between the motors and obtaining a footprint similar to 
that shown in Figure 4.28(b). The drawback is again that the FoV would 
not be uniformly sampled.
2.	 In contrast, if the spinning motors are rotating in opposite directions in­
cluding a phase difference, that is, θ′m = θm + ψ, then the footprint is almost 
a line for which the orientation depends on the phase difference, ψ. The 
smaller the tilt angle, the more the footprint resembles a line. Figure 4.31 
shows the output angles for this configuration and several ψ phases. For ψ 
= 0 a horizontal line is generated by a maximum side length of θo=2(α+α′). 
Note that for a complete spinning loop (i.e., 0 to 360 deg), the pointing 
direction goes up and down twice through the line. For larger phases, the

line is rotated as shown in the Figure 4.31(b). The length of the line is re­
duced up to a minimum length of θo=2(α+α′) cos (θi) proportional to the 
minor elliptical axis of the previous case. Again, using this configuration 
one could sample the whole FoV by progressively changing the difference 
in phase between the motors, but with a nonuniform sampling.
A nice scanner has been described in [51], where two spinning mirrors rotating 
in opposite directions were used to generate a linear footprint. A third slowly rotat­
ing motor was then used to fill the FoV by displacing this linear footprint laterally. 
This solution avoids the problem of motor torque because the fast spinning mir­
rors are rotating continuously at a constant angular velocity, whereas the footprint 
in the range plane is practically a raster scan, similar to the one shown in Figure 
4.25(c), that prevents the problem of oversampling the FoV.
4.4.2  Typical Reflector Systems 
When designing reflector systems that make use of mechanical scanning capabilities 
to generate the image from a single receiver, one has to take into account a trade-off 
between the possible aberrations introduced by the scanning antenna system and 
the acquisition time of the image. If the system has the focus on the beam quality 
rather than on the speed, it is more convenient to place the scanning system after 
the main aperture. In such a case, the scanning system should be composed by flat 
mirrors that do not introduce any phase aberrations. With such a configuration, 
one could cover large FoVs with high-quality antenna patterns. The only optical 
aberration present is the Petzval field curvature when working with near-field fo­
cusing reflectors. This aberration is associated with the fact that, when scanning, 
the pattern is well focused along a surface instead of along the target plane.
On the other hand, when the application requires operation at fast imaging 
speeds, the previous solution is only suited for small FoVs or when the diameter of 
the primary aperture (and therefore of the scanning system) is relatively small (typi­
cally below 30 cm). For larger diameters the weight of the scanning mirrors starts 
to become prohibitive for high-speed rotation. In such cases, it is more convenient 
to implement the mechanical scanning system at the level of a secondary reflec­
tor where a magnification factor is used to reduce the dimensions of the rotating 
component. Obviously, in this case, the rotation will introduce aberrations on the 
antenna pattern, and one should arrive at a compromise between the FoV, beam 
quality (i.e., resolution), and imaging speed. 
When the target plane is at large distance with respect to the main aperture (i.e., 
Rf /D >10), Cassegrain or confocal systems with an elliptical main reflector are a 
good solution to obtain a certain magnification. These solutions would reduce the 
rotating mirror diameter while maintaining a good-quality antenna pattern over 
the field of view. For instance, a confocal-based reflector system was used in [32, 
44] to generate the images shown in Figure 4.1. The images were created at 670 
GHz by using an active imager with an elliptical reflector focusing at 25m. The re­
flector system used is shown in Figure 4.32(a), consisting on a primary aperture of 
1m and a magnification of 10, leading to a rotating mirror of approximately 10 cm 
in diameter. The reflector system is based on a confocal Gregorian system consist­
ing of two paraboloid reﬂectors sharing a common focus [52] and the equivalence 

198

between the parabolic and elliptical reflector described previously. In the design, 
the rotating mirror is illuminated by a collimated beam. This is important because

it relaxes the tolerance on the position of the rotating mirror’s principal axes, which 
otherwise would be difﬁcult to align at high frequencies. Such a reflector configura­
tion presents a cancellation of the coma aberrations that are normally present in 
more conventional reﬂector conﬁgurations, and that is the reason why it presents 
very good scanning properties. Figure 4.32(b) shows the simulated near fields at 
the center and at the edge of the FoV. 
In [30], some simple design formulas for ellipsoidal confocal reflector systems 
were provided. The properties of the antenna pattern over the FoV depend on the 
path length rms, d, of all the rays, which start at a rotating mirror and end at the 
target plane, where the bundles of rays are supposed to converge for adequate near-
ﬁeld scanning of the antenna. By doing an intensive parametric study, an empirical 
formula to calculate this rms path length was derived:

where M is the magnification of the system, D is the primary reflector diameter, Fm 
is the primary focal distance, c is half the interfoci distance of the elliptical surface 
of the primary reflector, and ρ is the scanned distance over the FoV. The maximum 
FoV can be defined directly from the rms path length as described here. Considering 
a uniform aperture and allowing a maximum decay of the antenna field over the 
FoV of XdB decibels, the rms path length becomes

When the target plane is relatively close to the main aperture (i.e., Rf /D < 10), 
the design of scanning reflector systems with low aberrations becomes extremely 
difficult. This type of system resembles the optical reflective systems used for mi­
croscopes [53] and spectrometers [54]. A nice system that presents low aberrations 
is the Offner imaging spectrometer [55]. It consists of three spherical reflectors: 
two offset ones and a symmetrical one, as shown in Figure 4.33(a). The smaller 
reflector can be rotated from its center to achieve a mechanical scanned imaging 
system. The radius of curvature and centers of the three reflectors can be optimized 
to achieve clean antenna patterns over the whole FoV as in Figure 4.33(b), where 
the near fields at both the center and the edge of the FoV are shown. 
Appendix 4A  Derivation of Field in the Focal Plane of a Focusing 
Reflector 
In this appendix, we introduce a simple formulation to compute the field in the 
focal plane of a general focusing aperture as a superposition of plane waves. This 

200 
�����������������������������������������������������

formulation can then be used to calculate the power received by reflector antenna 
feeds by using its effective height, as shown in Appendix 4B. 
A real reflector system is composed of a cascade of many reflectors, but the 
basic design trade-offs can be performed considering a single equivalent reflector 
[33]. Let us define this equivalent reflector with a certain aperture of diameter D 
and focal distance F, as shown in Figure 4A.1. 
For analyzing the radiation characteristics of a reflector antenna, two tech­
niques are commonly used: the equivalent current distribution on the reflector 
method, and the aperture distribution method [23]. For the current distribution 
method, a physical optics approximation is assumed to compute the equivalent

currents along the reflector surface, and the radiated field is then obtained by inte­
grating these currents. In contrast, for the aperture distribution method, the field 
reflected by the surface is found over a plane normal to the axis of the reflector by 
using ray-tracing techniques. Then these aperture fields are integrated to obtain 
the radiation characteristics of the reflector. This method is actually more conve­
nient for analyzing a focusing aperture because it allows for expressing implicitly 
the quadratic phase distribution of the field aperture. This quadratic phase will be 
cancelled when calculating the field at the focal plane.
We can define an equivalent aperture in front of the reflector at a distance P 
from the apex of the reflector. As a starting point we are going to consider the focal­
ization system under the incidence of a plane wave coming from ˆ

rents. Note that this radiation integral is expressed as a function of a reference

Now, if we assume that a series of plane waves, with the same polarization, is 
impinging on the reflector, for the linearity of the problem, the electric field on the 
focal plane can be calculated as a superposition of the fields generated by each of 
these plane waves. In the case of plane waves polarized along y, the expression of 
the field becomes:

Assuming that we can neglect the effect of the reflector on the polarization

changed and the field in the reflector equivalent aperture can be expressed directly

where I0 is the current following on the antenna terminals when operated in

If we consider directive antennas, widely used in the terahertz regime, such as 
horns and lenses, we can compute the far field radiated by the antenna in terms of 
a radiation integral involving only magnetic equivalent currents over the aperture 
of the antenna (i.e., the horn aperture or an aperture defined on the top of the lens) 
by invoking the Schelkunoff theorem [56]. The antenna current distribution, ma(x, 
y) can be expressed as a function of generic function, fa(x, y) and a normalization 
constant v: ma(x, y) = fa(x, y).
Then, the actual far-field pattern can be calculated directly from the Fourier 
transform  vFa(kx, ky) of the equivalent current. Assuming an equivalent magnetic 
current along x, the far field can be expressed as [23]:

Appendix 4C  Power Received by an Antenna in the Focal Plane of a 
Focusing Reflector 
In this appendix we derive an expression for calculating the power received by an 
antenna placed in the focal plane of a general focalization system under the inci­
dence of a plane wave coming from a direction identified by the spherical angles (α, 
β) with an amplitude Ee(α, β). For this purpose, we can recall the expression of the 
focal plane field derived in (4A.13). To calculate the power received by the focal 
plane array, we approximate the field in the surrounding of the nth antenna in the 
focal plane, which will be located in (xn, yn), as follows:

Appendix 4D  Integration Time in Passive Detectors 
In this appendix, we provide some formulas to compute the integration time in a 
passive detector needed to achieve a certain signal-to-noise level. These formulas 
will be useful for the optimization of the FPA sampling in terms of image acquisi­
tion speed. 
In a direct detection scheme, the S/N after detection, (S/N)AD, can be improved 
with respect to the one before detection, (S/N)BD. As a matter of fact, as described 
in [27]:

average power captured by each pixel of the focal plane,

that every source of noise can be treated additively. The two major contributions to 
the total NEP are the internal noise of the receiver (NEPdet), and the photon fluctua­
tions of the signal itself (NEPphot). The total NEP is then

For sensitive terahertz space imaging applications, one can concentrate on an 
important situation: the one in which the cooled receiver does not introduce signifi­
cant noise. In such a situation, the limiting noise is the photon noise only, depen­
dent on the background. Therefore, the case where γ = 0 is commonly referred to 
as the background limited case.
The starting point for FPA acquisition speed optimization is (4D.1), indicating 
that the S/N improves with the integration time or the bandwidth. The integration 
time can be expressed as the time required to acquire an image on a specific FoV 
for a certain accepted signal-to-noise ratio, (S/N)AD:

Overall, the required integration time is inversely proportional to the useful 
(signal) power received and directly proportional to the total received power (since 
the entire power received contributes to photon noise). The useful signal is the part 
of the absorbed power that arrives at the receiver from the FoV through the reflec­
tor system. However, in general, the total received power differs from that desired 
signal: For example, a thermal contribution originating in the reflector system itself,

In passive detectors, when the reflector system is not sufficiently cold, an important 
noise contribution arises directly from the instrument itself. For such a contribution 
we can calculate the average power received by the antenna assuming that a series 
of plane waves arrives at the antenna from angles outside the reflector rim as:

Multiband Reflector Antennas
Sudhakar Rao, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems
5.1  Introduction
Advanced reflector antennas supporting multiple frequency bands are required for 
both satellite and ground applications. These antennas have the advantages of re­
ducing the number of reflectors, minimizing the mass, and significantly reducing the 
cost. The technical challenges are the reflector design, feed system supporting mul­
tiple frequency bands, and the feed assembly that separates the various frequency 
bands providing the desired isolation. 
Conventional reflector antennas support either single or two frequency bands. 
Although parabolic reflector antennas are frequency independent, the feed systems 
have limited bandwidths. In addition, when the reflector shape is changed from the 
parabolic surface for shaped beam applications, the reflector also becomes band 
limited. Figure 5.1 shows two conventional methods of supporting two frequency 
bands from a common reflector antenna. The first method employs a subreflector 
that is made up of a frequency selective surface (FSS) to separate the low- and high-
frequency band signals. The high band is reflective to FSS and therefore the high 
band uses the dual-reflector system. The low band is transmissive through the FSS 
subreflector, so single reflector optics are employed at the low band. The FSS in this 
case employs lowpass elements such as annular rings, cross-dipoles, or Jerusalem 
crosses etched on the subreflector. The Voyager spacecraft employed an S/X band 
Cassegrain antenna with FSS subreflector [1, 2]. Disadvantages of with this design 
include the loss associated with the FSS subreflector and the long coaxial line from 
the low-frequency feed to the back of the main reflector. The two bands have to be 
widely separated in order to minimize the losses due to FSS (typically > 2:1 band­
width ratio). It also requires two feeds and a complicated FSS subreflector with 
limitations on the separation of the frequency bands.
The second method employs a dual-band feed and a single reflector. The high-
frequency band uses a central waveguide, whereas the low frequencies are propa­
gated through a coaxial structure [3]. The two conventional methods are illustrated 
in Figure 5.1. There are two separate feed points for the feed. This also requires 

216 
����������������������������
Multiband Reflector Antennas
the two bands to be widely separated. The high-frequency signals leak through the 
outer coaxial structure, requiring either filters or absorbing material to suppress 
the coaxial modes at the high band. A disadvantage with this design is the poor 
cross-polar levels at the low-frequency band due to coaxial mode propagation that 
are unacceptable for space applications and most ground applications.
A number of recent developments related to advanced reflector antennas sup­
porting multiple frequency bands are discussed in this chapter. The following de­
velopments include both reflectors and feeds:
••
Dual-band antennas with a single-waveguide-type feed;
••
Dual-band antennas with multiple feeds;
••
Multiband antennas supporting several frequency bands;
••
Stepped-reflector antennas;
••
Antennas with reflective and partially reflective surfaces.
5.2  Dual-Band Reflector Antennas with Single Feeds
An advanced dual-band feed using a Cassegrain reflector is illustrated in Figure 5.2. 
This antenna has the advantage of covering two discrete bands that are separated 
up to the 3.5:1 bandwidth ratio and able to produce either similar beam shapes 
at two bands or different beam shapes at the two discrete bands. The bandwidth 
ratio is defined as the ratio of highest frequency of the highband to the lowest fre­
quency of the lowband. To produce similar beam shapes at low and high bands, 
the feed needs to be designed with frequency-dependent radiation characteristics.

5.2  Dual-Band Reflector Antennas with Single Feeds

Such a design produces a highly tapered amplitude distribution that might include 
sidelobes on the subreflector at the high band. In addition, the feed creates a phase 
distribution at the high band such that it has a 180-deg phase reversal at the outer 
portion of the subreflector. As a result, the secondary patterns from the antenna are 
significantly broadened at the high band and provide similar beam shapes at both 
bands that are widely separated in frequency [4]. 
The main challenge here is the feed system design, which is tasked with produc­
ing the desired frequency-dependent radiation characteristics. A corrugated horn 
can support dual bands with a limited bandwidth ratio of about 2:1, but cannot 
cover bands that are more widely separated than this. Also, corrugated horns have 
the disadvantages of increased mass due to thick corrugations. A smooth-walled 
multimode horn is more suited for such applications. 
The reflector diameter is chosen to meet the desired gain and beamwidth re­
quirements at the lowest frequency. The design of the horn is based on selecting the 
horn diameter that provides the desired illumination taper on the subreflector at 
the lowest frequency. An illumination taper of around 12 dB is optimum at the low 
band. For this application the aperture distribution is required to be more uniform 
at the low band and tapered at the high band. The feed horn synthesis process using 
mode-matching analysis was developed by Chan and Rao [5]. The required mode 
contents to create a tapered aperture distribution at the high band are chosen [5, 
6]. Based on the mode content, the initial discontinuity points can be determined 
based on the mode cutoff wavelengths in a circular waveguide. Initial synthesiz­
ing of the horn geometry can be performed at the high band in order to provide 
the required illumination taper and gain at the high band. Final optimization of 
the horn’s geometrical parameters can be performed by specifying the desired cost 
function at several frequencies, covering both the low and high bands, and synthe­
sizing the horn using mode-matching analysis. The cost function includes desired 
performance parameters and can be defined as follows:

return loss is better than 29 dB, the axial ratio is better than 1.37 dB over the fre­
quency band (cross-polar isolation is better than 22 dB), and the beamwidths are 
very close despite the wide frequency separation between the low and high bands. 
The computed radiation patterns of the dual-band feed at the low and high 
bands are shown in Figures 5.4 and 5.5, respectively. The amplitude patterns shown 
in Figure 5.4 have a better than 12-dB illumination taper on the subreflector, and 
the phase patterns are mostly uniform with a maximum phase variation of 50 deg 
within the illumination angle of ±19 deg. The cross-polar levels are lower than -20 
dB relative to copolar peak gain.
At the high band, the feed patterns shown in Figure 5.5 have an amplitude 
taper of a better than 17-dB illumination taper. The phase patterns show 180 deg 
phase reversal within the subreflector illumination region. This phase nonunifor­
mity is required in order to broaden the secondary patterns.

The computed secondary patterns at two frequencies at the low band and two 
frequencies at the high band are shown in Figure 5.6. The beam flattening at the 
high band is the result of the nonuniform phase from the feed, and it makes the 
antenna beamwidths at both the high and low bands similar. The peak gain values 
are better than 48 dBi over both bands. The cross-polar isolation is better than 26 
dB over the half-power beamwidth of the antenna. This dual-band antenna has the 
advantages of lower cost, feed simplicity, and beam congruency over both bands.

are used to provide communications among several users that are spread over a 
given coverage region by using multiple overlapping beams [7, 8]. Communica­
tions among users is established through the ground hubs and the satellite. The 
users establish communication with other users using a two-way communication 
link via satellite and the hubs through forward (hub uplinks, satellite downconverts 
and downlinks to users) and return links (user uplinks to satellite, satellite down­
converts and downlinks RF signals to hub). Each beam is generated using a single 
feed that transmits to and receives from the ground the RF signals via the reflector 
antenna.
A four-reflector system is typically used to generate all of the desired beams, 
as explained before in Section 2.3. An exemplary beam layout over the continental 
United States (CONUS) is shown in Figure 5.7. It employs 68 overlapping spot

factor (sometimes referred to as scan factor) that is dictated by the offset reflector 
geometry (see Section 2.3.4). The feed diameter is 2.27 in. and synthesized geom­
etry is shown in Figure 5.8.
Radiation patterns of the dual-band horn providing high efficiency values over 
the Rx and Tx bands are shown in Figures 5.9 and 5.10, respectively. Computed 
values are based on mode-matching software and agree well with the measured 
values. Return loss, efficiency, and cross-polar levels of the dual-band horn are 
summarized in Table 5.2. A number of dual-mode horns are used to illuminate each 
of the four reflector multiple-beam antennas (MBAs) (see Section 2.3.5) to generate 
the 68 overlapping spot beams on the ground, as shown in Figure 5.7. The reflector 
antenna geometry shown in Figure 5.11 has an 80-in. diameter, an F/D of 1.45, and 
an offset clearance height of 26 in.

The antenna radiation patterns for a typical beam computed for various dual-
band horn designs are shown in Figures 5.12 and 5.13. A high-efficiency horn 
helps to improve peak and edge-of-coverage gain (design –F) at the Tx band while 
reducing the peak gain and improving the edge-of-coverage gain at the Rx band; 
this feature is desired due to the fact that the reflector is oversized for Rx frequen­
cies. The main beam rolloff and sidelobe patterns in Figure 5.13 indicate that the 
Tx sidelobe levels are lower with a high efficiency horn by about 3 dB, which helps

in copolar isolation when used with a typical four-cell frequency reuse scheme for 
multiple-beam antennas (see Section 2.3.5 for more details). The antenna edge-of-
coverage gain for various horn designs is plotted in Figure 5.14 at the transmit­
ting and receiving frequencies. Primary and secondary performances of dual-band 
MBAs are summarized in Table 5.3. Note that the high-efficiency horn improves 
gain over the Tx band by about 0.9 dB and improves gain by 2.0 dB over the Rx 
band relative to the conventional corrugated horn. More importantly, the Tx co­
polar isolation (C/I) is improved with the high-efficiency horn (HEH) by about 3.7 
dB with a four-cell scheme with 1.2 dB of degradation in Rx C/I (it is noted that Rx 
C/I is less critical than Tx C/I). 
5.4  Multiband Antennas Supporting Several Frequency Bands
The satellite payloads are progressively becoming more complex and support mul­
tiple services from a single satellite. This is made possible due to the advent of 
high-power satellites developed by several satellite manufacturers with DC power 
ranging from 12 to 20 kW. In addition, the recent trend toward the hosted pay­
loads that combine the commercial payload with government payloads in a single 
satellite for cost reduction have created demand for the multiband antennas. A few 
examples of multiband antennas are described below.
5.4.1  Tri-Band Antenna
A single antenna supporting three bands covering 20, 30, and 45 GHz has been 
described [9, 10]. These three frequency bands potentially combine the existing 
Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) and Advanced EHF (AEHF) satellite into one 
large satellite in the future. It is designed to provide a 1.0-deg beam at 20 and 30 
GHz and a 0.5-deg beam at 45 GHz. The antenna geometry is shown in Figure 
5.15. It employs a 44-in. offset reflector with a focal length of 54 in. and an offset 
clearance of 18 in. It is fed with a tri-band multiflare horn as shown in Figure 5.16.

 The feed aperture needs to be moved by about 3 in. toward the reflector in 
order to improve the overall performance of the tri-band antenna. This is due to the 
fact that the phase center of the horn at 45 GHz is inside the horn and located close 
to 3 in. inside the horn relative to the horn aperture. The computed performance of 
the tri-band antenna is summarized in Table 5.4 with no defocusing of the feed and 
a 3.0-in. defocusing. With the defocusing, the overall antenna gain and cross-polar 
levels are improved. Radiation patterns of the tri-band antenna are plotted in Fig­
ure 5.17. These patterns are computed with 3-in. defocus of the feed and provide 
efficient gain and cross-polar levels of lower than –20 dB. The tri-band antenna

provides congruent beams at the three bands with no differential pointing among 
them. This is another advantage of the tri-band antenna compared to separate an­
tennas. The beams can be scanned over the Earth’s field of view by gimbaling the 
main reflector by about ±5 deg and keeping the feed system stationary.
5.4.2  Multiband Antenna Supporting Five Frequency Bands
An antenna system supporting five frequency bands and three satellite services has 
been described recently [4, 11]. The three satellite services include direct broadcast 
satellite (DBS), reverse DBS (RDBS), and personal communication satellite (PCS). 
With the approval of RDBS bands by the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC), the future satellites are expected to utilize the RDBS services in addition to 
DBS and PCS services. RDBS service uses the same frequency band for the Tx as

the Rx band of the DBS. The Rx band for RDBS is the new 25 GHz that has been 
recently allocated by the FCC. Therefore, either DBS or RDBS service is supported 
at a given time along with the PCS and hence four frequency bands out of five are 
operational at a given time.
The synthesized multiflare horn with seven slope discontinuities is shown in 
Figure 5.18. The performance summary at five bands is shown in Table 5.5. Return 
loss is better than 26.5 dB, cross-polar levels are lower than –22 dB relative to co­
polar peak gain, and efficiency values range from 74% to 82% over the five bands.
The computed radiation patterns of the multiband horn are shown in Figure 
5.19. When used with the reflector, the phase patterns of the horn are important 
and could be used to improve the secondary patterns by changing the location of 
the horns relative to the focal plane for multiple beams or focal point for a single 
beam application. The phase patterns of the multiband horn are plotted for two 
positions of the horn in Figure 5.20. The first position is when the horn aperture 
coincides with the focal point or focal plane of the reflector (no defocus) and the 
second position is the optimized location when the horn is moved toward the re­
flector from the focal plane by 1.0 in.
The peak gain as a function of defocus distance is plotted in Figure 5.21. Larger 
defocus is better at high bands and no defocus is better at the lowest frequency. A 
1.0 in. defocus is optimum over all five bands. Computed radiation patterns of a 
100 in.-diameter offset reflector with 1.0-in. defocus are plotted in Figure 5.22.

Multiband Reflector Antennas
The summarized performance in Figure 5.22 shows that better overall gain perfor­
mance is achieved with 1.0 in. defocus. Peak gain values of 49.0 to 53.6 dBi are 
achieved over the five bands with edge-of-coverage gains ranging from 47.4 to 50 
dBi over the bands. The cross-polar isolation (C/X) is very high at low bands and 
varies from 32.8 to 18.4 dB over the bands. For PCS service at 30 GHZ, a C/X 
of 18.4 dB is good because the interference is dominated by the copolar isolation 
(C/I), which is typically about 14 dB. 
Figure 5.23 shows beam layout for DBS, RDBS, and PCS services over CONUS 
covering the top 40 designated market areas (DMAs). It requires 26 spot beams 
generated using four 100 in. reflectors where each reflector provides six to seven 
beams. The computed minimum gain contours at 12.45 GHz for all beams on one 
reflector are all plotted in Figure 5.24. All beams reuse the same frequency and the

worst-case copolar isolation (C/I) is shown as an inset in Figure 5.24. The C/I is 
better than 21 dB. The Tx and Rx beam plots for PCS are shown in Figures 5.25 
and 5.26, respectively. The C/I values are better than 25 dB at both bands.
The overall performance of the multiband antenna over five frequency bands 
is summarized in Table 5.6. The feed assembly is the key hardware for these types 
of antennas that separate multiple frequency bands through filters and diplexers 
and provide dual circular polarization at each band. The feed assembly concept is 
illustrated in Figure 5.27. The lowest frequency band of 12 GHz is separated out 
through a symmetrical junction using four waveguide slots and four filters that 
reject all high band signals. The outputs of the four lowpass filters are combined 
through two H-plane junctions and a 3-dB hybrid coupler to produce dual CP

tion cuts off the Ku-band signals and passes the remaining four higher bands. The 
second symmetric junction after the step separates the 17 GHz and 20 GHz signals 
through four filters that act as shorts at the 25 GHz and 30 GHZ bands. The sepa­
rated 17 GHz and 20 GHz signals are further isolated using two diplexers, one for 
each polarization. The second step in the circular waveguide acts as a short for the 
17 GHz and 20 GHz signals and passes only 25 GHz and 30 GHz signals to the 
right of the junction. A septum polarizer is used to generate dual-CP and two di­

Multiband Reflector Antennas
using electroforming combined with RF analysis of the feed assembly, including the 
horn, enables the design and manufacture of feed assemblies that meet the stringent 
requirements needed for such antennas.
5.5  Stepped-Reflector Antenna
A stepped-reflector antenna (SRA) suitable for dual-band and multiple-frequency 
band applications has been reported recently [12–14] for multiple-beam applica­
tions. This advanced antenna utilizes reflector improvements in addition to the 
horn improvements that were described earlier in this chapter. A typical reflector 
antenna supporting 20 GHz and 30 GHz frequencies has dissimilar beamwidths at 
the two bands, with the high-frequency band beamwidth being smaller by about 
50% compared to the low-frequency band beamwidth.

Because both bands need to cover the same area on the ground, the beam­
widths have to be similar. By using a step near the outer annular region of the 
reflector, a 180-deg phase reversal is obtained between the inner and outer regions, 
thereby broadening the beam. The step height h can be designed to be a quarter 
wavelength at the high band, However, a quarter wave height at the high band re­
sults in about 0.17λ at the low band and impacts the low band’s performance. To 
have a minimal impact at the low band, a frequency-dependent horn needs to be 
designed that produces Gaussian phase patterns at the high band while producing 
a near uniform phase at the low band. The combination of feed phase and reflector 
phase contribution can be made quarter wave at the outer annular region, which 
results in a smaller step size. This concept is illustrated in Figure 5.28 and has also 
been described in Section 2.3.5.
The SRA consists of a hybrid reflector having a central portion that is either 
parabolic or shaped and an outer annular ring(s) that is (are) either parabolic or 
shaped. The reflector size is larger than the conventional design without the step 
and is required to create a “flat-top” beam. Use of a slightly larger reflector is not 
a problem at higher frequency bands. With the combination of step height and the 
feed quadratic phase variations, a 180-deg phase reversal is obtained in the reflec­
tor illumination near the step region at the high band. Such a nonuniform phase 
distribution at the reflector aperture results in a flat-top beam shape that broadens 
the main beam at the high band. The flat-top beam at the high band has the ad­
vantages of higher edge-of-coverage (EOC) gain by more than 1.0 dB, improved 
copolar isolation (C/I) by about 3 dB, and reduced gain loss due to satellite point­
ing errors. The computed patterns of the SRA with and without the step ring are

shown in Figure 5.29. The step lowers the peak gain and improves the EOC gain 
by about 1.0 dB at the high band without impacting the low band’s performance. 
The computed radiation patterns for multiple beams are shown in Figures 5.30 
and 5.31 for the low and high bands, respectively. The beam is Gaussian in shape 
at the low band and flat-top at the high band, resulting in EOC gain improvements 
in both bands. The SRA can be extended to more than two bands and can be opti­
mized with multiple steps.
5.6  Reflector Antenna with Reflective and Partially Reflective Surfaces
A hybrid antenna similar to the stepped-reflector antenna discussed in Section 5.5 
has been reported in [14]. The advantage with this design is that it requires a mini­
mum number of reflector surfaces for MBA applications, one for transmitting and 
another for receiving functions. This also requires no beam-forming network and 
uses a single horn per beam. The central portion of the reflector is fully reflective 
and the annular regions as shown in Figure 5.32 are partially reflective. This will 
create a stepped illumination on the reflector and lowers the sidelobe levels.
The reflector may include several annular regions having various reflectivity 
levels and thus resulting in attenuation. Since the number of reflectors required 
for a MBA is reduced from four to two, larger reflector sizes can be used to com­
pensate for the attenuation caused by the annular regions. Reducing the number 
of apertures allows each of the reflector apertures to have an increased aperture 
size. The concept is illustrated in Figure 5.32, where the annular regions are made 
up of sparse graphite mesh, and a thin layer of Kapton coated with a resistive film 
such as Nichrome is bonded to the mesh. The mesh is supported by radial ribs that

are attached to the central section. By varying the resistivity of the film, different 
attenuations can be achieved over the annular regions. This method requires a 
larger reflector compared to conventional methods but a single reflector is needed 
to generate all of the beams. For example, Nichrome film of 187 Ω/square resistiv­
ity gives about a 6-dB reflective loss, whereas a 555 Ω/square film gives a 12-dB 
reflection loss.
Typical radiation pattern comparisons are shown in Figure 5.33 where the hy­
brid reflector provided about 1.5 dB more gain and about 7 dB lower sidelobe 
levels compared to a conventional reflector.

Reflector Antennas for Remote Sensing 
Applications
Paolo Focardi and Richard E. Hodges, Jet Propulsion Laboratory
6.1  Introduction
Remote sensing of Earth and other bodies in the solar system uses sensor technolo­
gies to detect and classify objects by means of propagated electromagnetic radia­
tion. Sensors deployed on aircraft or satellites make it possible to collect data on a 
global scale that would not otherwise be practical to obtain. Remote sensing is used 
for a wide range of science applications ranging from global measurement of ocean 
topography and deforestation to the study of Jupiter’s atmosphere. The military 
employs remote sensing techniques to collect data about opposing forces, weather 
conditions, and other information relevant to its mission. 
Remote sensing is broadly classified as either active or passive. Active remote 
sensors, such as radar, transmit electromagnetic radiation toward a target and then 
detect the reflected or backscattered radiation. Passive remote sensors detect the 
radiation that is naturally emitted by an object, either due to (1) reflection of am­
bient electromagnetic energy incident on the object (e.g., sunlight) or (2) emission 
of blackbody radiation. Active sensors include many types of radars, including 
altimeters, which are used to accurately measure altitude; scatterometers, which 
measure ocean surface wind velocity; synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which is used 
to create high-resolution stereographic images of a planet surface; atmospheric ra­

military radars, which are used to locate, track, and identify objects such as aircraft 
or ground vehicles; and so forth.
Passive microwave sensors include many types of radiometers, each of which is 
designed for a specific purpose. Notable examples include the scanning multichan­
nel microwave radiometer (SMMR), a five-frequency instrument primarily used 
to measure sea surface temperature; the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series radi­
ometers, which are used to characterize tropospheric water vapor; the Microwave

to study comets; and the Microwave Limb Sounders (MLS), which are used to 
study the chemistry of ozone destruction in the Earth’s stratosphere. A detailed 
description of these and other instruments may be found in [1].
Remote sensing system design is driven by the science requirements that de­
fine the mission. Consequently, both the system and antenna are typically cus­
tom designs that are tailored to meet the unique mission science requirements. For 
spaceborne remote sensing applications, reflector antennas have historically been 
the most widely used antenna design. Characteristics of the antenna such as beam 
shape and scanning capability are driven by specific system design requirements. 
However, some general requirements are common to most active and passive sen­
sors. For radar, the most important requirements are gain, ability to handle high 
RF power, sidelobes, and cross-polarization suppression. Specific applications may 
also impose unique requirements that strongly influence the type of antenna used. 
For example, scatterometers have gain knowledge and stability requirements that 
preclude the use of antennas that are thermally sensitive. In contrast, radiometers 
require antennas with high beam efficiency, low average sidelobe level and very low 
internal circuit loss, whereas antenna gain is of secondary importance.
This chapter presents an overview of the various types of reflector antenna de­
signs used for remote sensing applications. Antennas flown on historically signifi­
cant missions are used to illustrate the practical implementation of each antenna 
type. In addition, the chapter presents notable antenna research developments that 
are regarded as enabling technologies for new types of sensors.
6.2  Solid Nondeployable Composite Reflectors
Reflector antennas, when feasible, have always been the preferred way of commu­
nicating with spacecraft in Earth orbit and beyond. Their simple geometry enables 
high gain and high data rate performance in a rugged hardware package that can 
support multiple frequency bands and polarization diversity. They come in forms 
and shapes as varied as the missions for which they were designed. The same char­
acteristics that make them the antenna of choice for telecommunications also dis­
tinguish them as instrument antennas. 
In this section we describe the most common technologies used for making 
solid nondeployable instrument reflector antennas and we will briefly describe the 
missions they were designed to support.
6.2.1  Voyager/Magellan
The high-gain antenna design used for the Voyager missions [2] was subsequently 
adapted for use on the Magellan spacecraft [3], and was the first of its kind to sup­
port both telecommunications and instrument systems (see Figures 6.1, 6.2, and 
6.3). It was originally designed to transmit and receive in S-band and also to trans­
mit in X-band. For Magellan, the original S- and X-band telecommunication ca­
pabilities were integrated with an S-band instrument that operated in three modes: 
synthetic aperture radar (SAR), altimeter, and radiometer. The Voyager reflector 
antenna design was attractive because minimal changes were needed to obtain the

the shaped frequency selective surface in front of the S-band feed are clearly visible.

additional required functionality. The side-looking SAR provided—for the first 
time—a remarkably detailed map of Venus’s surface, which is not visible due to 
the planet’s dense atmosphere. The technology proven by Magellan was later used 
on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which provided the first global 
topographic maps of the Earth’s surface obtained from satellite measurements.
The geometry of the antenna consists of a 3.66m paraboloidal reflector with 
an F/D of 0.338. The composite reflector is shared by both the S- and X-band feeds 
as shown schematically in Figure 6.4. At the higher frequency the antenna works 
in a Cassegrain configuration with a dual-mode circularly polarized horn feed and 
a shaped frequency selective surface (FSS) subreflector. At S-band, the antenna is 
configured as a regular prime focus reflector. The geometry of the antenna was 
optimized to work best in X-band. The X-band feed is designed to provide low 
power at the edges of the subreflector to limit the amount of spillover in the for­
ward direction. A shaped subreflector is used in place of a classical hyperboloid to 
provide a uniform illumination over the main reflector as required for high aper­
ture efficiency. The shaping algorithm creates a smaller radius of curvature near 
the center of the subreflector in order to direct more power toward the edges of 
the main reflector. To correct for the resulting phase error and achieve a constant 
phase aperture distribution, the main reflector is also reshaped from its nominal 
paraboloidal shape. However, the deviation from a paraboloid was negligible at 
S-band and had no significant effect on the prime focus reflector performance. A 
circularly polarized S-band low-gain antenna (LGA) completed the assembly and 
was mounted directly above, and coaligned with, the S-band feed of the high-gain 
antenna (HGA) as shown in Figure 6.4.

along with its inertial upper stage (IUS). To the left of the reflector antenna, the altimeter antenna 
(ALTA) instrument is also visible.

The S-band feed is an open-ended circular waveguide with a choke to limit the 
spillover. Several modifications were made to support the addition of the 2385-
MHz radar frequency to the telecom frequencies (2298 MHz for transmitting, 
2115 MHz for receiving). The horn inherently supports both dual linear and circu­
lar polarizations, but the RF components were modified to add linear polarization 
input ports for the radar in addition to the existing right-hand circular polarization 
(RHCP) and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) telecom ports. The feed cables 
were also modified to support the higher power requirements for the radar. 
6.2.2  Cassini
The high-gain antenna on Cassini [4] is also a multifrequency reflector, conceptu­
ally similar to Voyager/Magellan except that it is larger and more complicated. This 
antenna accommodated a wide range of experimental modes, and integrating all of 
them on the same reflector was challenging [5]. It uses S-band for radio science ex­
periments and to keep a radio relay link with the Huygens probe during its mission. 
X-band is used for telecom and Ku-band for radar imaging and altimetry of Titan. 
Finally, Ka-band is used for Doppler experiments, for searching for gravitational 
waves, and for measuring relativistic bending of solar rays. All frequency bands 
were designed for circular polarization (single or dual) except for Ku-band, which 
was linear. Apart from the reflector, all major components of Cassini’s antenna are 
visible in Figure 6.5.
The basic design was heavily constrained by environmental requirements and 
by launch vehicle loads. The antenna needed to survive temperatures as high as 
160°C at the Venus flyby and as low as -210°C close to Saturn. Six thick struts, 
well inside the aperture, were needed for the secondary reflector to survive the 
launch loads (Figure 6.6). The basic design was based on a typical Cassegrain con­
figuration with a maximum aperture of 4m in diameter and an F/D of <0.33. All

frequency selective surface (FSS). Also shown is the position of the low-gain antenna (LGA) in S-band.

frequencies required on-axis pencil beams. At Ku-band, four additional fan beams 
were also required for radar imaging. Maximum gain was required at S- and X-
band, whereas at Ku-band other critical requirements for radar imaging included 
minimizing the sidelobe level and integrated sidelobe ratio and maximizing the 
minimum gain along the range plane line. At Ka-band, a beamwidth 1.6 times 
larger than that achievable by the physical aperture was required as a compromise 
between peak gain and spacecraft attitude control capabilities at the time. The S-
band subsystem is located at the prime focus of the paraboloid, while the X-, Ku-, 
and Ka-band subsystems are located at the Cassegrain focal plane. 
The subreflector consists of a cascade of three FSSs separated by vacuum as il­
lustrated schematically in Figure 6.7. The first one, a regular hyperboloid, reflects 
Ku- and Ka-band and is transparent for X-band. The second one, a shaped reflec­
tor similar to the one used by Magellan, reflects X-band. A third one is used as a 
matching layer for the S-band feed located at the prime focus. A triple-band feed 
horn and four sets of array feeds, each comprised of five 5 × 2 element waveguide 
slot arrays, are then placed in the Cassegrain focal plane. An X-band LGA atop the 
S-band feed completes the assembly. Figures 6.6 and 6.8 show details of the subre­
flector, the feed horn, the waveguide slot arrays, and the LGA. 
The S-band subsystem was located at the prime focus because the feed would 
have been too large compared to the other bands and it would have been in conflict 
with the other subsystems. 
Feeds for the other higher bands are located in the Cassegrain focal plane pri­
marily to minimize transmission line losses and optimize overall efficiency. For 
Ku-band this location also meets the sidelobe levels required for radar imaging. 
A tremendous amount of work was performed by many international institutions 
and universities in order to predict and optimize the performance of this complex

multifrequency instrument (e.g., see [6]). Figure 6.9 shows the completed Cassini 
antenna.
6.2.3  CloudSat
The CloudSat mission was developed to acquire a global data set of vertical cloud 
structure and its variability. The primary science instrument is the Cloud Profiling 
Radar (CPR), a 94-GHz nadir-looking radar that measures the power backscattered

Ka-band are clearly visible. Note the X-band LGA on the back of the subreflector.

by clouds as a function of distance from the satellite [7]. The 94-GHz operating 
frequency was chosen as a compromise between instrument sensitivity, antenna 
size, atmospheric transmission, and transmitter power. CloudSat’s CPR antenna 
system includes a very compact 1.85m-diameter offset Cassegrain reflector (see 
Figure 6.10) combined with a quasi-optical transmission line (QOTL), which is 
used to minimize transmission line loss to the transmitter and receiver [8]. Very 
tight mission requirements on beamwidth (<2 km on Earth footprint), on absolute 
reflectivity measurement accuracy (1.5 dB), on the sidelobe level envelope (<50 dB 
below peak gain for angles larger than 7 deg from boresight), and on detectable

cloud reflectivity (minimum detectable cloud reflectivity (Z) of –28 dBZ at the end 
of the two-year mission) determined the shape and size of the antenna. 
The overall antenna system, illustrated schematically in Figure 6.11, includes 
a collimating antenna (mirrors M1, M2, and M3) and the QOTL, which consists 
of three more mirrors (M4, M5, and M6), a Faraday rotator, and a polarizer. The 
QOTL delivers the signal from the transmitter to the collimating antenna, and 
from the collimating antenna to the receiver on partially different paths. A signal 
emitted by a klystron is reflected by M6 and then goes through a polarizer and a 
Faraday rotator. It is then reflected by M4, which feeds the collimating antenna. 
Mirror M6 can also rotate on its axis and face a backup power source in case of a 
klystron failure. The entire QOTL is assembled just behind M1, making the entire 
instrument very compact. The collimating antenna and the QOTL were developed 
separately. To facilitate this, a corrugated circular test horn was used to provide the 
excitation to M3 on the collimating antenna side and to M4 on the QOTL side.
Given the high frequency at which the instrument operates, the offset Casseg­
rain reflector design procedure was approached from a quasi-optical point of view. 
The pattern of the test horn mentioned above illuminates an elliptical mirror M3, 
which then feeds a shaped mirror M2 through a hole in the primary mirror M1. 
The shapes of M2 and M1 were optimized to achieve maximum efficiency using 
the following procedure. The pattern of M3, fed by the test horn, is used as a 
source for M2. The shape of M2 is then determined by 20 points, which are used 
as optimization variables based on thin-plate deformation theory. Symmetry was 
used to limit the number of unknowns, while one point on M2 was fixed in order 
to fix the mirror position. A constant path length in geometrical optics (GO) then 
defined the shape of M1. Physical optics (PO) was used to determine the directivity 
of M1, the parameter to optimize in the process. The edge tapers on the hole in M1

and at the perimeter of M2 and M3 are 30, 23, and 25 dB, respectively, and they 
allowed the antenna to have very little spillover, resulting in only a 0.16-dB loss for 
the entire collimating antenna. 
6.2.4  Aquarius
The instrument antenna for Aquarius [9] was designed to operate both as a scat­
terometer and a radiometer in L-band to accurately measure sea surface salinity 
from space on a global scale. The antenna design is a compromise between resolu­
tion on the ground and coverage. The reflector dimension was chosen as the larg­
est that would fit in the launch vehicle in order to maximize resolution. Since the 
single-feed beam was too narrow to achieve the required ground coverage, three 
separate feeds were used to create three adjacent beams that together meet the cov­
erage requirement.
The antenna is a 2.5m graphite composite offset reflector with an F/D of 0.633 
and pointed 33 deg from nadir. Figure 6.12 shows the reflector and the feed sub­
system. The reflector boom assembly is hinged so that it can pivot towards the feed 
horns for launch and then deployed once in space. The three identical L-band feed 
horns are located in the focal plane and are offset from the focal point and tilted to 
produce the required beams. These beams combine to create a total ground swath 
width of more than 300 km with gaps between the individual beam footprints 
that are smaller than 50 km. In addition, the polarization of the three horns is also 
clocked to obtain a properly aligned vertical polarization at the sea surface. The ra­
diometer measures the brightness temperature of the sea surface, which is then cali­
brated based on the roughness information calculated by the coaligned scatterom­
eter. The total temperature error allocation is 0.15K for the radiometer, whereas 
the scatterometer has an error allocation of about 0.12K. The pointing stability due 
to thermal and mechanical variations is required to be within 0.05 deg.

The basic design of the reflector and feeds was originally done using a sim­
ple physical optics approach. A scale model of the entire spacecraft (roughly 1/10 
scale) was fabricated and measured in order to validate the simple PO calcula­
tions (Figure 6.13). Very accurate predictions of the antenna pattern are indeed

necessary in order to properly calibrate a radiometric measurement. Typically the 
power radiated by the antenna is integrated in three major regions of space: the 
main beam of the antenna, the sidelobes facing Earth, and those looking at cold 
space. A very complex RF model of the entire spacecraft (Figure 6.14) was later 
developed in order to obtain more accurate predictions of the patterns produced 
by the three feeds in the presence of the entire spacecraft. As can be seen in Figure 
6.14, this RF model is very accurate and is aimed at reproducing all of the details 
of the antenna performance.
6.2.5   Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reflector antenna system [10] was not designed 
to accomplish remote sensing; instead it only supports telecommunications. How­
ever, the design is noteworthy because it has unique features that may be applicable 
to an instrument package such as a radar. MRO was designed with a large 3m 
reflector and used what is called “displaced axis” optics to minimize the blockage 
of the subreflector. The subreflector is shaped such that it diverts the signal coming 
from the feed toward the sides of the reflector without sending excessive power 
back into the feed. The compact nature of the subreflector minimizes blockage. 
Figure 6.15 shows a schematic diagram of the MRO antenna. Photos of the flight 
antenna are shown in Figures 6.16 and 6.17. The feed is an X-band corrugated horn 
in circular polarization integrated with a Ka-band disk-on-rod antenna. While the 
X-band link has become standard for recent space missions, the Ka-band link is also 
being developed in order to achieve higher data rates and support radio science. 
Modern instruments are capable of producing an enormous amount of data and 
higher rates are needed in order to limit the download time. Data rates of the order 
of 6 Mbps can be achieved by this antenna system.

Since 1992, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Na­
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States have 
partnered with CNES in France to measure the global ocean surface topography 
through a series of highly successful missions including TOPEX/Poseidon (1992–
2006), Jason 1 (2001–present), OSTM/Jason 2 (2008–present), and Jason 3 (2014 
scheduled launch). The distance between the satellite and sea surface ocean height

is measured using a 13.6-GHz and a 5.3-GHz radar altimeter that employs a 1.2m 
reflector antenna (Figure .6.18). The altimeter measures the round-trip travel time 
of microwave pulses transmitted by the spaceborne altimeter and reflected from the 
sea surface. In addition, the Advanced Microwave Radiometer (AMR) measures 
radiation from the Earth’s surface at three frequencies (18.7, 23.8, and 34 GHz). It 
measures atmospheric water vapor and liquid water content in order to determine 
the radar signal path delays. Although the Jason 1 radiometer antenna is offset 
fed, four struts were added to meet launch vibration requirements (right photo in 
Figure 6.18). These struts cause sidelobe levels to increase, which degrades the ra­
diometer instrument performance. For this reason, a new radiometer antenna that 
has no struts was designed for use on Jason 2 and 3 (see Figure 6.19). This antenna 
Figure 6.18  Jason 1 spacecraft is shown at left. The larger symmetric fed reflector is the altimeter antenna. 
The upper reflector is the radiometer, which is also shown in the photo at right.

provides very low sidelobes and high beam efficiency, which results in significantly 
improved radiometer performance. Note that these composite reflectors are coated 
with a thin layer of aluminum in order to minimize conduction current losses on 
the reflector surface. 
6.3  Deployable Reflector Antennas
6.3.1  Deployable Composite Reflectors
6.3.1.1  Segmented Folding Composite Reflectors
Deployable composite reflectors developed by Composite Technology Development 
(CTD) use thin graphite composite reflective surfaces that are pleated to reduce 
their size for stowage. CTD has developed and demonstrated this technology for 
both center-fed and offset-fed configurations. The center-fed reflector configura­
tion resembles a coffee filter in the packaged state, whereas the offset-fed reflector 
is formed into a few large, parallel pleats. Both configurations reduce the width of 
the stowed reflector to about one-third of the aperture diameter. Shape memory 
polymer components are used within the system to constrain the reflector in the 
stowed shape, to control and damp deployment, and to stiffen the thin reflective 
surface after deployment. Both the center-fed and the offset-fed reflectors are also 
stiffened by a deep, thermally stable backing structure actuated with shape memory

polymer deployable beams. The packaging and deployment cycle is shown in Fig­
ure 6.20 for the center-fed reflector. Only the small portions of the reflector that 
consist of shape memory polymer must be heated for packaging and deployment. 
The on-orbit power requirement to achieve full deployment is less than 200W over 
a 30-min period. Full-scale engineering models of both the center-fed and offset-fed 
reflectors have been fabricated, cycled through multiple deployments, range tested, 
and thermal distortion tested. The total surface accuracy budget of these demon­
stration units was sufficient for Ku-band operation. Flight reflectors are expected 
to be capable of Ka-band and above.
6.3.1.2  Spring-Back Composite Reflectors
The spring-back reflector consists of a thin graphite mesh dish with an integrated 
lattice of ribs and a stiffening hoop along the rim. The reflector stows by folding, 
and cables along the rim hold the reflector in the stowed position (see Figure 6.21). 
The reflector deploys by releasing the cables so that it “springs back” to the origi­
nal shape. Boeing Satellite Systems (formerly Hughes Space and Communication 
Company) developed this concept, which was first used on MSAT-1 in 1996 for two 
reflectors of 6.8m × 5.25m. Most recently it was used for NASA’s next-generation 
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS; H through J) for a reflector size 
of 5m. The operating frequency is up to Ka-band (27 GHz), and its mass is 20 kg 
with a resultant density of 0.71 kg/m2 (without deployment structure).
The stowed volume of the spring-back reflector is quite large compared to 
the other deployable reflectors, and the stowed length in one direction equals the 
reflector diameter. For this reason, the antenna’s diameter is restricted to approxi­
mately the height of the launch shroud. Although this reflector was designed for a 
telecom application, the concept has obvious application for instruments such as 
radar.

6.3.2.1  Galileo
Although the dual S-band and X-band mesh reflector antenna system developed 
for Galileo [11] was designed to meet telecommunications requirements, the tech­
nology is directly relevant for current remote sensing applications such as SMAP. 
Galileo remains the largest and most complex antenna system flown on an inter­
planetary mission. Because Galileo was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter and en­
dured its uniquely harsh radiation environment for 14 years, this antenna warrants 
careful study by present-day instrument designers.
To understand the Galileo design, it is useful to put it in the context of the time 
it was conceived and developed. The spacecraft was originally designed to be car­
ried into Earth orbit on board a space shuttle and to subsequently start its journey 
directly toward Jupiter using a Centaur upper stage. Voyager size solid reflectors 
(3.66 mm) were the largest that would fit in the shuttle’s bay, but the need for 
higher gain and data rate forced the team to select a larger deployable reflector. A 
4.755m radial rib mesh reflector design that Harris Corporation had successfully 
used for the TDRSS was chosen for Galileo. This design included both S- and X-
band capability similar to that of Voyager; but for Galileo the X-band link was 
intended to be the primary link because it allowed for a data rate of 134.4 kbps, 
the fastest data link flown on a deep space mission at that time. The dual polariza­
tion, circularly polarized, X-band horn was Cassegrain located and used an FSS 
subreflector similar to the Voyager/Magellan design. A linearly polarized S-band 
feed was located at the prime focus of the paraboloid. A low-gain antenna (LGA) in 
S-band originally completed the telecom system, which was mounted on top of the 
reflector’s S-band feed and therefore coaligned with the high-gain antenna (HGA). 
Figure 6.22 shows a schematic diagram of the Galileo antenna. 
The Galileo antenna fabrication and test was already completed when, on 
January 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger disaster occurred. This incident 
changed the Galileo deployment plan because the Centaur upper stage was deemed

unsafe to fly on a space shuttle and the U.S. Air Force’s inertial upper stage (IUS) 
was instead chosen to boost Galileo out of Earth’s gravity. A new trajectory for 
Galileo was designed that included one Venus and two Earth fly-bys, thus requiring 
6 years to reach Jupiter. These changes in the mission plan meant Galileo would 
fly much closer to the sun than originally expected and therefore many parts of the 
spacecraft needed to be retrofitted to survive the new environment. Accordingly, 
two sun shades were installed: one at the top of the Cassegrain tower just below the 
LGA and one behind the reflector. The HGA was not opened for almost two years 
after launch and remained hidden behind the sun shade until the spacecraft was 
far enough from the sun for the mesh reflector to be opened safely. Moreover, the 
launch delay also resulted in the antenna being held in storage for three years and 
the stowed HGA was constantly sun-pointed during the early stages of the mission, 
conditions that the antenna was not originally designed for.
Images of both the partially and fully deployed Galileo antenna are shown in 
Figures 6.23 and 6.24 (the sun shades are not present in these photos). The reflec­
tor, made of a 10-openings-per-inch tricot mesh of molybdenum wires, opens as 
an umbrella. Unfortunately, the reflector failed to fully deploy on April 11, 1991. 
Although the root cause of the failure will probably never be known with certainty, 
the speculation is that the failure was a consequence of the launch delay associated 
with the Challenger accident. As a result, only the two LGAs were available to 
communicate with Earth. Despite this situation, improvements in the Deep Space 
Network and other measures taken to increase the data rate enabled Galileo to 
meet mission requirements.

6.3.2.2  SMAP
The Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission [12] will use an L-band ra­
dar and radiometer to measure Earth soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state. A 6m 
AstroMesh™ offset reflector and a dual-band, dual-polarized, L-band corrugated 
horn are shared by the radar and radiometer instruments. The deployable reflector, 
similar to the one shown in Figure 6.25, uses a 20-openings-per-inch mesh shaped 
by a web of Kevlar strips running across the reflector in three different directions, 
thereby forming a reflector of relatively flat triangular facets. The spacecraft will fly 
on a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit of 680 km and is scheduled to be launched 
in November 2014.
The reflector has a focal length of 4.2m and an F/D of 0.7. It is folded into a 
tight bundle for launch and will deploy once in space, along with its supporting 
boom, to be pointed 35.5° from nadir. Once deployed, the entire instrument will 
spin at 14.7 rpm on top of the bus and solar panels to cover a large 1,000-km 
swath. It will have a spatial resolution of 40 km for the radiometer and 1 to 3 km 
for the radar. It will also be the first spinning mesh reflector and the first radiometer 
instrument based on a mesh reflector to be employed in space.
Achieving the mechanical, thermal, dynamic, and electrical stability required to 
use a mesh reflector proved to be significantly more challenging for the radiometric 
instrument than for the radar. The stability during operation of the electrical to 
mechanical pointing bias and the stability of the integrated power radiated in the 
different regions of space were also critical aspects of the design.

The SMAP development plan does not include measuring the flight antenna 
radiation pattern, and instead relies on the very accurate RF model shown in Figure 
6.26 to predict the instrument performance. For more details about the SMAP RF 
model, see [13]. In the final layout of the spacecraft, the top corner of the solar 
panels intersects the 6m projected aperture of the reflector twice per revolution of 
the instrument. Among the many simulations, the RF model was also used to verify 
that this intrusion was indeed negligible from a performance standpoint. Small 
variations of the various parameters were observed but remained within tolerance 
for the instrument. For instance, the electrical pointing of the antenna is the pa­
rameter that is affected the most by the spinning, but only variations of the order 
of ±0.004 deg in elevation are predicted. 
The radiometer electronics is located next to the feed horn in order to minimize 
electrical noise. The positions of these boxes and that of other instrument boxes 
were also used to counterbalance the spun mass of the reflector and boom. The ra­
dar electronics is located inside the bus and the signal is fed through a rotary joint 
at the center of the spacecraft. 
As noted earlier, RF performance predictions for the antenna assembly are 
based on the RF model because pattern measurements of the actual reflector in a 
1G environment are too costly. Instead, a 1/10 scale model of the entire spacecraft, 
shown in Figure 6.27, was fabricated and tested in order to verify the performance 
and to validate the results of the RF model. Although the scale model reflector is 
solid machined aluminum instead of mesh, the reflector surface is faceted to simu­
late the AstroMesh surface. This scale model also includes the ability to clock the 
spacecraft bus, solar panels, and other components on the non-spun side in order 
to validate the perturbations of instrument performance resulting from the antenna 
rotation. Test results demonstrated excellent overall agreement between the scale 
model measurements and the RF model.

6.3.2.3  ISAT
In 2001, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated the 
Innovative Space-Based Radar Antenna Technology (ISAT) program. Its focus was 
the development of a 300m × 3m electronic scanning radar antenna that is compat­
ible with the stowage requirements of a conventional launch vehicle [14, 15]. One 
of the two ISAT concepts was a phased-array-fed reflector (PAFR). Figure 6.28 il­
lustrates a planned 108m low-Earth-orbit ( LEO) flight demonstration system. This 
design used a linear phased array as the feed for a deployable parabolic-cylinder 
mesh reflector that was developed through the critical design review (CDR) process.
On-orbit antenna deployment is performed with the antenna oriented along 
the gravity gradient. The antenna bays are deployed sequentially in pairs, one in 
each direction beginning with the outermost bays. The mesh reflector assembly is 
synchronously deployed with the truss structure, which supports the phased-array 
feed panels.
A 12m engineering unit, shown in Figure 6.29, was tested in a laboratory en­
vironment and demonstrated an rms surface error of 1 mm. Three complete axial 
stows and deployments were successfully completed. Thermal vacuum environ­
mental testing to characterize surface deformation was not performed due to the 
associated costs and complexity.

6.3.3.1  Reflectarray Technology Overview
The printed circuit reflectarray is a low-profile antenna type that evolved in the 
late 1980s. Reflectarrays use an array of printed circuit elements that is designed to 
control the phase of a reflected signal in order to create a non-Snell’s law reflection

optics that enables a flat surface to function as a focused reflector comparable to 
a traditional parabolic reflector (Figure 6.30). The reflectarray elements control 
the phase of the reflected signal by adjusting some geometrical parameter, such as 
patch size, orientation, or the length of the transmission line. These elements are 
created using standard printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication methods, resulting in 
a low-cost reflector antenna that is readily mass produced. Reflectarrays offer the 
advantages of a traditional reflector, such as the simple feeding arrangement, but 
add many of the advantages of a phased array such as the ability to scan the beam 
and tailor the shape of the radiation pattern. Although reflectarrays are relatively 
narrowband and typically have lower overall efficiency than one can achieve with 
either a reflector or phased-array antenna, they are attractive for many instrument 
applications. Huang and Encinar provide an excellent overview of reflectarray tech­
nology including a comprehensive overview of the wide variety of design concepts 
that have been developed [16].
6.3.3.2  Folded Panel Deployable Reflectarrays
Reflectarrays are frequently built with the PCB material serving as the face sheet 
in a honeycomb sandwich configuration, resulting in a very strong and lightweight 
structural panel. These panels are inexpensive to build and the flat form factor is 
attractive for spacecraft applications because it enables the reflector to be folded, 
which simplifies stowage. This technical approach is well suited to instruments such 
as side-looking radars that require a low-cost, dual-polarization, scanned beam 
antenna. 
Wide Swath Ocean Altimeter (WSOA)
Satellite missions began to use nadir pulsed radar altimeters to measure ocean height 
in 1992 with Topex/Poseidon, followed by Jason 1 in 2001 and Jason 2 in 2008. 
In the late 1990s, a unique experimental mission known as the Wide Swath Ocean

Altimeter (WSOA) was proposed to produce a full three-dimensional map of ocean 
height. WSOA is a cross-track interferometer with a 6.4m baseline. An enabling 
technology for this instrument is a pair of 2.2m × 0.35m Ku-band antennas that are 
stowed by folding. They provide dual-beam, dual-polarization, ~20-dB sidelobes 
and 50% aperture efficiency in a low-mass package. Each antenna is comprised of a 
reflectarray and two feeds located off the focal point to produce two beams scanned 
±3.3 deg from nadir.
Two Ku-band reflectarray antennas were developed for WSOA (Figure 6.31). 
The initial interferometer concept used a symmetric-fed piecewise parabolic (PWP) 
reflectarray with a 1.125m focal length in which each panel is tangent to a pa­
rabola [17]. However, due to consideration of mass, moment of inertia, and inter­
ferometric phase stability, the symmetric-fed reflectarray was abandoned in favor 
of an offset configuration with a 2.8m focal length [18]. Both configurations are 
comprised of five panels and two feeds, one for vertical polarization and one for 
horizontal polarization. A mechanical deployment mechanism is used to fold the 
flat panels into a stowage configuration for launch. The panels use variable-sized 
square patch reflectarray elements printed on Rogers RO4003 substrate material.
The piecewise parabolic design is used to minimize the total phase shift that 
must be supplied by the reflectarray elements in order to collimate the beam. This 
yields a more robust electrical design due to the reduced aperture phase gradient 
and minimization of phase wraps. A flat reflectarray was chosen for the offset-fed 
design in order to minimize scan loss for the two beams [19]. Breadboard tests were 
performed for both configurations. Performance of the two antenna designs was 
found to be comparable and confirmed that the analysis model accurately predicts 
the key antenna parameters.
Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT)
The proposed Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, currently in 
formulation by NASA and CNES, would employ a Ka-band radar interferometer 
(KaRIn) system to characterize ocean circulation at spatial resolutions of 10 km 
and provide a global inventory of all terrestrial water bodies whose width exceeds 
50 to 100m [20].
The interferometer is formed by a pair of 5m × 0.26m reflectarray antennas 
separated by a 10m baseline as illustrated in Figure 6.32. The focal length is 4.37m,

design.

with the focal point located near the spacecraft bus to minimize transmission losses 
to the transmitter/receiver. Each antenna creates two beams, one V-pol and one 
H-pol, which illuminate the two 10- to 70-km swaths. These antennas are a key 
enabler for the KaRIn instrument. Breadboard antenna test results demonstrate 
that the antenna will meet performance requirements [21].
6.3.3.3  Flat Membrane Reflectarrays
The flat membrane reflectarray is a relatively new antenna concept in which a re­
flectarray is pulled taut over a planar frame (usually circular or rectangular). This 
design concept offers the potential for large, ultra-lightweight instrument anten­
nas that stow compactly. This technology is inherently less expensive than that 
of a traditional parabolic reflector because flat, flexible printed material is easier 
to fabricate, package, stow, and deploy in space. The flat membrane reflectarray 
antenna can employ inflatable/self-rigidizable technology in its primary structural 
members, thus allowing the reflectarray antenna to be collapsed and packaged into 
a small launch volume. However, reflectarrays are typically narrowband devices, so 
it is difficult to cover multiple frequency bands that are not harmonically related. 
In addition, the flat surface optics imposes limitations on instantaneous bandwidth 
due to path length differences between the source horn and various regions of the 
reflectarray surface.
Several experimental reflectarray antennas with different sizes and RF frequen­
cies have been developed to demonstrate the technology. The first reflectarray an­
tenna technology demonstration model that used inflatable structure technology 
was a 1m X-band reflectarray antenna [22] (Figure 6.33). The RF component con­
sists of two layers of 1m-diameter circular Kapton membranes that are separated 
by a large number of small foam inserts. A urethane-coated Kevlar inflatable torus 
holds the RF membranes, and a hexagonal ring holds the feed, while three inflat­
able struts connect the torus and the hexagonal ring. 
A 3m technology demonstration model of the inflatable reflectarray at Ka-
band was also developed [23, 24] (Figure 6.34). This antenna is shaped like a 
horseshoe with a hexagonal ring to support its feed. Three asymmetrically located 
urethane-coated Kevlar inflatable struts connect the ring. The horseshoe-shaped

configuration facilitates compact stowage because the deflated support structure 
and membrane can be rolled up onto a rigid tube assembly without causing signifi­
cant wrinkling to the membrane. The inflatable components must remain pressur­
ized throughout the entire mission. The 3m reflectarray achieved an rms surface 
error of 0.16 mm (1/55 wavelength at the 32-GHz design frequency). RF tests 
demonstrated excellent radiation pattern characteristics, although the aperture ef­
ficiency of this demonstration unit was very low due to a design flaw in the reflec­
tarray element design. The boom concept has been tested in the thermal/vacuum 
chamber and is rated at a technology readiness level of 4 to 5.
A dual X- and Ka-band, circularly polarized flat membrane reflectarray unit 
demonstrated that two widely spaced frequency bands can share the same aperture 
without introducing significant performance penalty [25]. This demonstration ar­
ray employs stacked split-ring reflectarray elements that are consistent with the 
flat membrane reflectarray design, and it achieved approximately 50% efficiency 
at both bands. 
6.3.4  Inflatable Reflectors and Structures
Inflatable antenna technology has been the subject of many years of research as 
a large deployable reflector technology that offers several potential advantages, 
including stowage volume and aerial density. An inflatable antenna includes four 
subsystems: reflector, inflation system, controlled deployment system, and struc­
tural support elements. Inflatable membrane structures ideally form a true metal

paraboloid, compared with mesh reflectors, which provide a faceted approximation 
to a parabolic surface. In contrast to a flat membrane reflector, an inflatable pa­
raboloid has a much wider bandwidth and higher efficiency, but it is more difficult 
to accurately create a doubly curved surface.
Although inflation methods have been successfully demonstrated in the labora­
tory, flexible materials will inevitably leak over an extended period of time in space 
as a result of micrometeoroids, radiation damage, and other factors. A variety of 
rigidization methods have been developed to address this issue, as discussed next.
6.3.4.1  NASA Inflatable Reflectors
The NASA-funded development of a variety of inflatable antenna projects began in 
the late 1950s with the Echo balloons. Echo 1 was a 31m-diameter inflated sphere 
made from 0.5-mil Mylar and coated with a layer of vapor-deposited aluminum. 
The 62-kg reflector successfully reflected radio transmissions between various lo­
cations on Earth, but failed to retain its spherical shape on orbit. Echo 2, a 41m-
diameter sphere launched in 1964, served as a Comsat communications satellite for 
1 year.
The Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) was flown in 1996 to validate the 
deployment of a 14m inflatable parabolic reflector structure. Photos of the antenna 
experiment on orbit are shown in Figure 6.35. The basic elements of the antenna 
system include the (1) inflatable parabolic membrane reflector, (2) inflatable to­
rus, which is the support structure for the reflector, and (3) 33m-long inflatable

struts to support the feed structure. A canister assembly provided support for the 
stowed antenna and other experiment equipment. During the 90-min experiment, 
the L’Garde-built antenna structure deployed to the proper shape, but the reflec­
tor failed to completely inflate, precluding any in-flight measurements of surface 
accuracy. Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a low-cost (~$1M) reflector antenna 
of this size can be stowed in a small volume, survive launch loads, and inflate to a 
specified configuration in space. It remains the only significant inflatable reflector 
antenna deployed in space [26].
During the past decade, NASA funded a variety of inflatable reflector research 
efforts [27]. Glenn Research Center (GRC) and SRS Technologies developed a 
0.3m offset inflatable thin-film polymer (CP-1) antenna, which was successfully 
tested at 8.4 GHz in 2004. In 2004–2005, a 4m × 6m offset thin-film inflatable 
antenna was fabricated and tested (Figure 6.36). The measured 3.5-mm rms sur­
face accuracy of this antenna was concentrated in the flattened edge region, so 
the reflector performed better than rms surface error would suggest. The antenna 
achieved a directivity of 49.4 dBi (71% efficiency) at 8.4 GHz and 51.6 dBi (8% 
efficiency) at 32 GHz.

Reflector Antennas for Remote Sensing Applications
In 2001, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and ILC Dover de­
veloped the Hybrid Inflatable Antenna (HIA) concept to address the perceived risk 
of inflatable antenna technology [28]. The HIA combines a traditional rigid para­
bolic antenna with an “inflation-deployed” rigidized reflector and support struc­
tures. A solid-body high-gain antenna is surrounded by a large inflated aperture in 
order to ensure a minimum level of performance for mission success in the event 
of a deployment anomaly (Figure 6.37). The HIA inflatable system stows very 
compactly under the rim of the fixed reflector so there is a relatively small increase 
in the stowed volume. A 2m, one-third scale model, prototype HIA built by ILC 
Dover achieved an rms surface error of approximately 1.1 mm. 
6.3.4.2  Rigidizable-Deployable Structures with Inflatable Deployment Mechanism
Inflatable structures employ a radically different paradigm from conventional me­
chanical support structures in that gas-pressure inflation of a flexible structure re­
places motor and cable actuation of solid elements. This concept has the important 
advantage that the stowed material can be densely packed for maximum stowage 
efficiency. For example, the inflatable structure designed to support a thin mem­
brane reflectarray shown earlier in Figure 6.34 collapses into a small roll, as seen 
in the deployment sequence of Figure 6.38 [23]. Despite the conceptual simplicity 
of the inflation mechanism, the design employs a sophisticated sequence of inter­
nal baffles to control the deployment rate and provide stiffness to the deployed

structure. Velcro strips and constant force springs are also used to stage the deploy­
ment and increase the stiffness of the final deployed structure.
To eliminate the need to maintain constant inflation gas pressure, a variety 
of rigidization methods have been developed. These include passive cooling, UV 
exposure, inflation gas reaction, thin wall aluminum, and foam inflation. A use­
ful description of these methods can be found in [29]. Several are currently being 
investigated for antenna applications. Methods referred to as inflatable-rigidizable 
employ a chemical or photonic mechanism to harden the antenna after deploy­
ment. Thermosetting inflatable rigidization relies on heating the material above 
its glass transition temperature during deployment. Currently, the most promising 
materials are two classes of composites: sub-Tg rigidizable thermoplastics and elas­
tomerics, and UV and heat-cured thermoset plastics. Recent materials technology 
work has validated their use as high-modulus truss elements suitable for the space 
environment. 
It was recognized during the development of the flat membrane Ka-band inflat­
able reflectarray (see Figure 6.38) that rigidization is essential for space missions. 
Consequently, ILC-Dover developed the “movie screen” deployment scheme under 
a Jet Propulsion Laboratory study contract for a space-applicable version of the 3m 
Ka-band inflatable reflectarray antenna [30–32] (see Figure 6.39). The reflectarray 
surface of this design is deployed by two inflatable booms in a manner similar to the 
unrolling of a movie screen. The inflation deployment process of the antenna only 
involves the unrolling and pressurization of two inflatable booms, making it pos­
sible to employ the “spring tape reinforced aluminum laminate boom” inflatable/

this one requires no space power, curing agent, or other added-on mechanisms or 
devices.
6.4  Summary
This chapter provided an overview of the major types of reflector antenna designs. 
The majority of the historically significant antennas that have been flown are solid 
nondeployable composite reflectors. The Voyager/Magellan mission illustrates a 
symmetric shaped reflector that provides dual frequency band capability to support 
both telecommunications and radar instruments. The Cassini antenna demonstrates 
the remarkably wide range of capability that a solid reflector system can provide. 
It delivers channels that cover S-band (radio science), X-band (telecom), Ku-band 
(radar imaging and altimetry), and Ka-band (Doppler).
CloudSat illustrates the level of performance that can be achieved with a re­
flector optimized for a single frequency band radar antenna. The antenna is an 
electrically large (580 wavelength diameter) offset-fed reflector with exceptionally 
high efficiency (59%) and ultra-low sidelobe performance (50 dB). An important 
feature of this antenna is the use of a quasi-optical transmission line to achieve ex­
tremely low transmitter-to-antenna transmission line loss. At another extreme, the 
Aquarius mission uses an electrically small (12 wavelength diameter) multibeam 
antenna that supports both radar and radiometer bands.
All of the aforementioned examples are fundamentally derived from classical 
parabola-hyperbola optics. In contrast, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reflector 
antenna illustrates a new “displaced axis” optics design that provides very low 
blockage in compact antenna design. Finally, the Jason 3 antenna illustrates the use 
of offset-fed reflectors for a dedicated radiometer instrument.
Although future missions will undoubtedly continue to utilize solid composite 
reflectors, new antenna technologies have emerged that represent enabling tech­
nologies for next-generation sensors. Novel materials have enabled development 
of new deployment concepts such as the CTD shaped memory composite reflector 
and the TDRSS spring-back reflector, which take the form of a solid composite 
reflector following deployment.
New mesh reflector designs have demonstrated high surface accuracy and ex­
tremely large aperture sizes, which has enabled the development of missions such 
as Galileo and SMAP.
Reflectarray antenna technology is of special importance for instruments be­
cause it is inexpensive and amenable to compact stowage through folding and in­
flation mechanisms. Moreover, reflectarrays offer unique capabilities, such as the 
ability to select a different focal point for each polarization, which may not be 
possible with a standard reflector. The NASA-proposed SWOT mission illustrates 
how reflectarray technology can be mission enabling. Finally, it should be noted 
that inflatable antennas, although not yet technically mature, have tremendous po­
tential to produce a highly diverse set of antenna shapes that stow very compactly.

7.1  Introduction
Communication satellites and associated ground antennas are used for a wide vari­
ety of commercial applications including TV, telephone, data, radio, and Internet. 
They are also widely used by the military for the flexible exchange of information 
between different units of the armed forces. Most communication satellites are 
located in a geostationary orbit (GEO) and generally use reflector antennas to si­
multaneously transmit and receive RF signals using separate downlink and uplink 
frequency bands for communicating with antennas on Earth. The reflector antennas 
are illuminated directly or indirectly via a subreflector by a feed to provide high-
gain coverage at specific locations on Earth. The feed assembly is key hardware in 
a satellite antenna. It defines the bandwidth, polarization, power handling, passive 
intermodulation (PIM) levels, and illumination on the reflector. It also separates 
various frequency bands, thus providing required isolation among the frequency 
bands and provides a good match with free space.
The feed assembly typically comprises a horn, orthomode transducers (OMTs), 
fillers or diplexers, polarizers, transitions, combining/dividing networks, and an 
antenna interface to the payload. It separates frequency bands, converts circular 
polarization (CP) to and from a linear signal, and isolates orthogonal polarizations 
for frequency reuse while providing a good match with free space. Reflector anten­
nas can use a single or multiple feeds to provide the desired beam coverage. While 
the reflector provides desired gain and beam shape on the ground, the feed assem­
bly dictates most of the RF performance in terms of insertion loss, return loss, axial 
ratio or cross-polar isolation, bandwidth, isolation among the bands for multiband 
payloads, high power handling, and PIM levels.

Feed Assemblies, Passive Intermodulation, Multipaction, and Corona 
The most common frequencies used for current communication satellites are at 
C-, Ku-, and Ka-bands. At these frequencies the feeds can be realized in waveguide 
structures without being too bulky. In addition to their practical size, waveguide 
structures also have low loss, can handle high power, and are very reliable, all of 
which are very desirable features for communication satellites.
In this chapter, some insight is given into the design of commonly used feeds. 
The feed requirements are driven by the overall antenna requirements for beam 
coverage. From the feed requirements, the designers have to arrive at a concept that 
not only meets RF requirements but also fits in a small envelope, has low mass, is 
manufacturable, and can operate in the harsh space environment. The design has 
to be completed in a relatively short time to fit within the schedule allocated for 
design, fabrication, and testing of the feed.
The antenna or payload requirements drive the feed assembly design. The 
payload types include FSS, DBS, PCS, MSS, and so forth. Fixed satellite payloads 
require the feed assemblies to be dual-band supporting both uplink and down­
link frequency bands. Because they employ a common feed assembly, larger band­
width, high power handling, and PIM are the key requirements that need to be met 
in a multicarrier payload. On the other hand, DBS payloads use a transmit-only 
function from the antennas and the key requirements are power handling, ther­
mal design, lower losses, and axial ratio. The PCS multiple beam satellites employ 
multiple feed assemblies for each reflector antenna. Key feed requirements are the 
dual-band capability, a compact assembly that can fit all hardware within the ap­
erture diameter of the feed horn, low losses, low axial ratio, and low mass. The 
mobile (MSS) payloads require a feed array comprising a large number of elements 
and the key requirements are element efficiency and PIM. The types of beam shapes 
on these types of payloads that the feed assemblies and the antenna support include 
shaped or contoured beams, high-gain pencil beams, multiple spot beams, multiple 
contoured beams, and reconfigurable beams.
7.2  Feed Components
The first step in the design process is to decide on a topology that can meet both RF 
and mechanical requirements. A good understanding of waveguide theory, filter de­
sign, waveguide component design, performance capability, integration, and manu­
facturability of each type of component is necessary in order to lay out a concept 
that can be realized successfully without iterations. Waveguide theory [1–3], horn 
design [4, 5], and filter design [6, 7] are discussed in details in a number of books 
and will not be covered here. Instead key components will be discussed to provide 
some insight into how they can be integrated to realize reflector antenna feeds.
7.2.1  Bends
Bends are required to change the direction of the wave propogation in the wave­
guide. Bends can be in the E- or H-plane as shown in Figure 7.1. In a feed network, 
there are usually several of these components in series, making it critical to achieve 
optimal return loss for each bend in order to minimize its impact on the overall feed 
performance. For space applications, where small size is very desirable, mitre bends 

7.2  Feed Components 
281
offer high performance in a small space. E-plane and H-plane mitre bends can 
achieve better than a 50-dB return loss over more than 40% bandwidth. Depend­
ing on the fabrication method, mitre bends may have internal radii that should be 
included in the design and analysis.
7.2.2  Transitions
For optimal performance, waveguide feed components are usually designed in non­
standard sizes. The waveguide cross section can also be rectangular, square, circu­
lar, ridged, or coaxial depending on functionality. To minimize reflections between 
different sizes and cross sections, transitions or impedance transformers are used 
between the different waveguide sections. A number of different transitions are 
shown in Figure 7.2.
A transition typically consists of steps that gradually change the cross section 
between the two waveguide sections to be mated. The lengths and dimensions of 
each section can be optimized together using commercial software to minimize 
reflections and provide maximum power transfer. In general, a single intermediate 
step provides reasonable performance over a narrow band, typically a 30-dB return

loss over about 5% bandwidth. Three to four steps have been found to provide 
good performance over a wide bandwidth for most practical cases at the expense 
of length.
A very compact and commonly used transition between a circular and square 
cross section is an octagonal transition. This transition can be used to provide 
better than a 30-dB return loss over more than 70% bandwidth and can be very 
effective for matching a horn to the rest of the feed network. However the designer 
has to verify that the level of the TM01 mode excited with this transition is within 
acceptable limits so as not to have significant impact on the feed radiation patterns.
Transitions may be fabricated in a single piece by direct machining. When fea­
tures are not accessible by direct machining in a single piece, split block machined 
pieces can be bolted or brazed together. In high-volume production, casting is a 
useful technique to lower costs. For closer integration with other components in 
a more complex assembly, electroforming can be used instead to realize a one-
piece part. Machining radii if present must be accounted for during the design and 
analysis.
7.2.3  Filters
The design of microwave filters has been covered extensively in several well-known 
books [6, 7]. It is notable that the filters and diplexers required in antenna feeds are 
of relatively broadband performance, not the channelized filters present in multi­
plexers. Although the near-band rejection and group delay characteristics of these 
front-end filters and diplexers are not as stringent, they must have very low inser­
tion loss, handle the full power level of all channels simultaneously without multi­
paction, and not contribute to the passive intermodulation of the feed. Front-end 
filters may be lowpass, bandpass, or highpass. Lowpass filters are typically com­
prised of corrugated sections, whereas bandpass filters are often of the inductive iris 
type. These topologies may also be designed together with a common waveguide 
junction to form a diplexer or a triplexer, thereby allowing transmit (Tx) and re­
ceive (Rx) signals to be combined into the same waveguide path. Figure 7.3 shows 
different types of filters commonly used in feed networks.
Filters may be designed to be manufactured by direct machining in pieces, 
which are then bolted or brazed. Machining radii if significant must be included 
in the RF design. This can add more time to the design process because an element 
with radii is not as computationally efficient as one with sharp corners.
Electroforming can be used to construct a seamless single-piece filter or diplex­
er with sharp corners as shown in Figures 7.3 and 7.4. Manufacturing tolerances

must be analyzed to prevent deterioration of key parameters (typically return loss 
is the most sensitive parameter). In some cases, tuning elements are used to com­
pensate for manufacturing tolerances or design uncertainties. However, tuning el­
ements are not typically amenable to high-power or low-PIM applications and 
therefore must be avoided for space hardware.
7.2.4  E-Plane, H-Plane, and Magic Tees
Another basic component found on many antenna feeds is a power divider/com­
biner. In its simplest form it is a three-port device that divides a signal equally into 
two paths or combines two signals into one path and is often referred to as a tee. An 
E-plane tee results in a phase shift of 180 deg between the two outputs. An H-plane 
tee results in a phase shift of 0 deg between the two outputs. A magic tee is a four-
port combination of the two types of tees, and can perform both types of phasing 
operations. Examples of tees are shown in Figure 7.5.
E-plane or H-plane tees are very compact and ideally suited where tight packag­
ing of the components is required. They can be designed to operate over more than 
50% bandwidth with return losses of better than 30 dB. However special attention 
must be paid to the design and fabrication of the tee to ensure it is connected to a 
well-matched and symmetrically balanced structure. Asymmetries from design or 
fabrication tolerances can result in excitation of undesirable modes. Where asym­
metries cannot be avoided, magic tees can be used instead with either the E- or H-
port of the magic tee loaded. The magic tee is not as broadband as the simple tee, 
and more space is required to accommodate the extra port and the load.

Tees are often used when splitting power to a symmetric OMT as shown in 
Figure 7.6, or as components in a comparator network to perform tracking func­
tions as shown in Figure 7.7.
7.2.5  Orthomode Transducers
An OMT is commonly used to provide dual-polarization capability for a feed. 
The OMT separates or combines two orthogonal linearly polarized (LP) dominant 
mode signals while maintaining good return loss at all ports and providing good 
isolation between the two orthogonal signals. Many structures have been used to 
realize an OMT. The particular choice depends on operational bandwidth, return 
loss required, feed layout, power handling capability, and manufacturing technique. 
7.2.5.1  Asymmetric OMTs
When the operating bandwidth is less than about 20%, an asymmetric OMT can be 
used with reasonable return loss performance. This type of OMT is relatively easy 
to realize. Figure 7.8 shows such an OMT machined in two halves, and Figure 7.9 
shows another OMT fabricated in one piece by electroforming. Isolation between 
the two polarizations can be greater than 60 dB at C-band when properly manufac­
tured as shown in Figure 7.10.
7.2.5.2  Symmetric OMTs
When bandwidth greater than around 20% is required, a symmetric OMT de­
sign can extend the performance without exciting undesired modes at the higher 
frequencies. The trade-off is increased fabrication complexity. Symmetric OMTs 
may be manufactured by direct machining in pieces that are then bolted or brazed. 
Electroforming can be used to construct a seamless single-piece OMT, as shown in 
Figure 7.11, which helps reduce the risks of generating PIM in the presence of high 
carrier power.
Symmetric OMTs typically contain some type of matching structure in the 
common junction, such as posts and a vane [8] or steps. Isolation between the two

polarizations can be greater than 55 dB at Ku-band when properly manufactured 
as shown in Figure 7.12.

7.2.5.3  Multiband Symmetric OMTs
Another symmetric OMT is the turnstile junction, which is useful when operating 
over multiple frequency bands. Turnstile junction OMTs can operate as diplexers, 
allowing both orthogonal modes at a specific frequency band to pass through the 
side ports, while simultaneously allowing both orthogonal modes at a second pass­
band to pass through a rear port as shown in Figure 7.13.
Turnstile junctions may also be constructed by machining and bolting or braz­
ing, or by electroforming. They have been used to construct feed networks oper­
ating at one, two, three, or more widely separated frequency bands. Figure 7.14 
shows a feed employing two turnstile junctions in tandem to allow operation at 
K-, Ka-and Q-bands. With any symmetric OMT, manufacturing tolerances must 
be precisely controlled with respect to symmetry, or unwanted modes will be gen­
erated at the common port. These unwanted modes can manifest as large sudden 
changes in group delay, insertion loss drops (suck-outs or spikes), or as additional 
radiated cross-polarization.
7.2.6  Polarizers
Polarizers are used in CP communication systems to convert linearly polarized 
(LP) signals into circularly polarized (CP) signals or vice versa. A few examples are 
shown in Figure 7.15.

7.2.6.1  Corrugated Polarizers
Corrugated polarizers are capable of producing a very pure CP signal (0.2-dB axial 
ratio) over about 25% bandwidth. They can be realized in circular or square wave­
guide cross sections. In a square cross section, corrugations can be on two or four 
sides of the waveguide. They may be fabricated as machined and bolted/brazed 
pieces or as a single piece by electroforming. They are commonly used along with 
OMTs to allow for simultaneous transmission and/or reception of orthogonal CP 
signals (RHCP and LHCP).
7.2.6.2  Septum Polarizers
Septum polarizers are the most common type of single-band polarizers for the sim­
ple reason that they operate with dual polarizations simultaneously from a single 
device. They typically offer excellent performance over a narrow band (0.1 dB 
axial ratio, over 10% bandwidth) and can support wider bandwidths with reduced 
performance (0.3 dB axial ratio, over 20% bandwidth). Like other components, 
septum polarizers can be fabricated as machined and bolted/brazed pieces or as a 
single piece by electroforming.
7.2.6.3  Hybrid-Based Polarizers
Quadrature hybrids (typically short-slot couplers) can be used to generate a CP 
signal when used in conjunction with a turnstile OMT and a pair of tee junctions. 
The hybrid coupler divides a signal evenly in amplitude, with a 90-deg phase shift

between the two outputs. The two outputs can then be divided again, this time 
without a phase shift between the outputs, and fed into the four side ports of a 
turnstile junction OMT. When manufactured with high precision, a very pure CP 
signal can be generated at the common port of the junction over >15% bandwidth 
as shown in Figure 7.16.
7.2.7  Horns
Horns are the most prominent component of the feed. Most modern communication 
satellites use hybrid or multimode horns, consisting of corrugated or smooth-wall 
(profiled) designs [9–11]. Corrugated feed horns typically offer the best cross-po­
larization, return loss, and broadband performance at the expense of aperture effi­
ciency, manufacturing complexity, and mass. Smooth-walled designs can offer very 
high efficiency at the expense of cross-polarization, but they are more easily manu­
factured, have lower mass, and can achieve very high performance when packaged 
in an array configuration for multiple spot beam antennas.
Both corrugated and smooth-wall horns are typically fabricated by direct lathe 
machining of aluminium billets. Both types may also be produced by electroform­
ing, especially when very fine features are present as in submillimeter wavelengths 
(>60 GHz). Manufacturing tolerances must be considered in the design and analy­
sis, particularly regarding the cross-polarization and return loss performance of 
these types of horns.
7.3  Feed Design
Given the typical short schedule for design, fabrication, and testing of an antenna 
feed for space applications, there is usually no time for prototyping or bench tuning. 
Design tools must be very accurate and fabrication methods precise enough to real­
ize a feed that meets requirements that are increasingly becoming more and more 
demanding. It is worth mentioning that a good process has to be in place for project

cessful and timely delivery of the feed.
7.3.1  Integrated Design Approach
Even with widely available sophisticated RF CAD tools, some designers still choose 
to design feed components separately. Prototypes are often produced to either prove 
or refine the design. The feed is then built up using an assembly of these separate 
components. Unfortunately deficiencies in the overall feed performance sometimes 
arise even if individual components exhibit good performance. This is due to the 
fact that interactions among the various components have not been accounted for 
in the design. 
With the RF CAD tools and computing power available today, there is little 
reason why all the components of the entire feed cannot be analyzed together. If 
properly performed, all pertinent RF performances of the entire feed can be char­
acterized, taking into account interactions among the various components. In ad­
dition, manufacturing tolerances can be included by performing sensitivity analysis 
to provide expected performance degradation after fabrication.
Taking the integrated approach one step further, the designer can consider opti­
mizing several components together and having shared features. This approach of­
ten provides better performance over a wider bandwidth than would be possible if 
each component were designed separately. In addition the design is often a lot more 
compact. An example was shown earlier in Figure 7.13 for a diplexing junction 
that is comprised of a turnstile junction, lowpass filters, and harmonic reject filters.
Manufacturing by electroforming is ideally suited for this approach since it 
easily allows for precision fabrication of complex shapes in one piece and in a very 
compact layout.
7.3.2  Other Key RF Design Considerations
During the design process the designer must also keep on mind other requirements 
such as insertion loss, high power, multipaction [12], PIM [13], operating tempera­
ture range, size and mass constraints, port locations, achievable manufacturing tol­
erances, and variation over temperature. Too often some of these requirements are 
overlooked at the start of the design process, resulting in a waste of precious time, 
compromised feed performance, or worse still an unusable feed.
The PIM order and power level will often drive the manufacturing method. In 
general 19th-order PIM or higher is not as critical. Lower order PIM may neces­
sitate reduction in flange joints or the use of special high-pressure or choke flanges 
to minimize the risk of generating PIM. The use of electroforming can eliminate 
seams and greatly minimize the number of flange joints and is in fact a common 
fabrication method used when 3rd-order PIM can be generated in the Rx band due 
to the harmonies of the Tx channels.
Performance variation over temperature can usually be accounted for in the 
design by including thermal guard bands on either side of the operating frequency 
band. This accounts for the expansion and contraction of the feed at the hot and 

7.3  Feed Design 
291
cold temperature extremes. Frequency responses, other than insertion loss, should 
only shift side to side as opposed to up and down for a properly fabricated feed.
7.3.3  Precision RF CAD Tools
Before the advent of sophisticated precision CAD tools and powerful computers, 
the feed design process could be very tedious and lengthy. Each waveguide com­
ponent was designed separately using a number of different techniques, which in­
cluded an empirical approach, prototyping and bench tuning, equivalent circuit 
models, and closed-form expressions. These methods were either limited in accu­
racy or can only be applied to certain specific geometries. Once each component 
had been realized, additional prototyping or bench tuning may have been required 
at the feed assembly level.
As feed requirements became more demanding and delivery schedules got short­
er, these techniques were no longer adequate. With today’s sophisticated CAD tools 
and computing power, most of the waveguide components can be designed with 
very high accuracy in a relatively short time. It is worth noting again that analysis 
of the entire feed assembly is possible with these CAD tools and is highly recom­
mended to avoid surprises caused by interaction between the various components.
Some commonly used RF design CAD tools include CHAMP, μWave Wizard, 
CST Microwave Studio, FEKO, WASPNET, and ANSYS HFSS. CHAMP is used 
for design and analysis of rotationally symmetric horns. The fields inside each 
circular section of the horn can be solved and expressed as analytic solutions of 
Maxwell’s equations. Mode matching (MM) is then used to derive the scattering 
matrix at the discontinuity between adjacent sections. The response of the entire 
structure is then obtained by cascading the matrices from each discontinuity. This 
method is very accurate since higher order modes between each discontinuity can 
be accounted for and it is very fast because of the use of analytical field solutions. 
However, it is limited to cross sections that can be solved analytically such as rect­
angular and circular.
For more arbitrary cross sections and structures, the fields for the entire com­
ponent or feed can be solved using CAD tools based on the finite element method 
(FEM). CST Microwave Studio and ANSYS HFSS are two of the most popular 
FEM-based design software programs. Although these tools are very versatile, they 
are much slower than CAD tools based on MM due to the computation demands 
of FEM.
Waveguide components and antenna feeds can generally be realized using rect­
angular or circular cavities and waveguides. In some cases irregular shapes are 
needed such as for rounded corners. CAD tools such as μWave Wizard focus on 
using MM and their derivatives (hybrid MM/boundary contour and MM/2D finite 
element) wherever possible and only applying 3D FEM for the irregularly shaped 
portion of the structure. The fields in the irregularly shaped portion are solved us­
ing techniques based on FEM and scattering parameters computed before cascad­
ing with S-parameter matrices from the rest of the structure. The result is a CAD 
tool that is not only accurate but also faster for simulation and optimization of 
waveguide components and antenna feeds. In addition copolar and cross-polar pat­
terns can also be part of the optimization process [14], making this type of CAD 
tool even more effective for feed designs.

7.3.4  Mechanical and Thermal Design
While the RF requirements drive the purpose and general design of the feed, that 
purpose and design has to work mechanically in the extreme environments of 
launch and space. The mechanical designer usually has the challenging task of op­
timizing size, weight, thermal, and structural integrity.
The launch environment will be the most extreme mechanical environment 
for any space hardware. A feed may see loads between 10 and 100g’s depending 
on their location in the spacecraft. Some locations enjoy damping and attenuation 
while others could see amplification. Spacecraft subsystems typically define the 
vibration levels that a feed needs to meet. Shock testing is usually not performed 
on an antenna feeds, because all components are mechanical and metallic in nature 
and therefore not sensitive to shock.
As mentioned previously, the short schedule to produce feeds makes prototyp­
ing impractical. For that reason 3D modeling and finite element software is used to 
accurately model and analyze each unit to qualification levels. The parts, however, 
are tested to protoqualification or acceptance levels so they can all be used as flight 
hardware. Positive margins must be shown for structural analyses with factors of 
safety ranging between 1.25 and 3.0. The lower factors would be used with hard­
ware that has a proven flight heritage or has accurate analysis to test correlation 
data. Higher factors would be used with hardware that has no proven heritage 
or accurate correlation. When working with electroform, factors such as material 
thickness variation, material property variation, and manufacturing process must 
be considered, because they can impact stress results. Additionally, depending on 
the requirements, random vibration fatigue can drive a design more strictly than 
overall 3σ rms stresses.
Space is the most extreme thermal environment for antenna feeds and other 
hardware. Spacecraft panels are temperature controlled, and even hardware that 
directly faces space and/or the sun may have active or passive thermal controls that 
keep their temperatures within appropriate operating ranges. Depending on their 
location on the spacecraft and the thermal controls available, a feed may see large 
or small temperature variations. These variations occur as cycles over the lifetime 
of the satellite, driven by the type of orbit. The variations are most often deter­
mined either by spacecraft subsystems or by the feed designer (with input from 
the spacecraft designer) using nodal-based thermal software designed specifically 
for analyzing spacecraft and spacecraft components. These conservatively analyzed 
temperatures then have 20° to 30° added onto the extremes as design and test mar­
gins of safety. The final worst-case temperatures are called the survival or nonop­
erating temperatures. Feeds tend to have survival temperatures between –200 and 
+200ºC. Many boom-supported antennas and feeds are exposed to those extremes, 
but some locations on the spacecraft body are only subjected to –50º to +100ºC.
Keep in mind that some nonmetallic materials may have strength or adhesion 
issues at the temperature extremes. Feeds should be analyzed for stresses induced by 
thermal expansion of mismatched materials and bolted joints. This causes several 
problems. Feeds will very often have aluminium and copper components together. 
These interfaces will produce higher bolt stresses, especially in shear. Because feeds 
are significantly alignment critical, bolt slip can be detrimental and these inter­
faces should be designed to prevent slip or force uniform slip. Feeds should also be

designed with interfaces to the spacecraft panel that allow for expansion without 
causing extreme deformation and stress. Spacecraft panels tend to be made of com­
posite materials having expansion rates near zero, which can put high stresses on 
parts that are rigidly attached. Finally, thermal fatigue, although not as damaging 
as random vibration, can contribute to the cumulative damage index.
7.3.5  Manufacturing Methods
With precision manufacturing the waveguide components can be realized without 
the need for bench tuning, which not only saves time, but reduces overall program 
risk. Some commonly used manufacturing methods for waveguide components in­
clude direct machining using computer numerical control (CNC) mills, CNC lathes, 
and CNC EDM; joining two or more pieces of metal using dip brazing; and creating 
complex high-precision metallic parts using electroforming.
7.3.5.1  Direct Machining
Direct machining using mills and lathes is probably the most widely used method to 
fabricate components for antenna feeds. Aluminum 6061T6 or 7075 T7351 are the 
most common materials used due to their relatively low cost, low density, strength, 
and ease of machining. With direct machining, the parts are usually made in several 
pieces and/or split in halves to provide access for the cutting tool. Bolted joints are 
required for assembly. Wherever possible, joints are along lines of zero current to 
minimize impact on RF performance.
7.3.5.2  CNC EDM
To minimize bolted joints, create sharp internal corners, and machine hard-to-reach 
features with precision, CNC EDM is often used. In this process the desired shape 
is obtained by using rapidly recurring current discharges to erode away material 
between an electrode and the workpiece. A number of different materials can be 
machined using EDM including aluminum. Although this process provides better 
access for machining hard-to-reach internal features, it can be slow and is limited 
by the reach of the electrode. Multiple electrodes are required depending on the 
surface finish and accuracy requirements, adding to the cost and fabrication time 
of the part.
7.3.5.3  Dip Brazing
When tight tolerances are not required, dip brazing can be used to create thin-wall 
aluminum parts without bolted joints. The parts are machined, fixtured, and a 
brazing compound applied to the mating surfaces. The assembly is preheated and 
then immersed into a bath of molten salt, which melts the brazing compound to 
create a bond at all the joints to form the part. Variation in fillet size at the joints 
from the brazing compound, voids in the joints, and variations in feature sizes can 
affect the electrical performance of the part.

7.3.5.4  Electroforming
When direct machining, CNC EDM, or brazing is no longer practical, electroform­
ing [15] can be used to create some of the most complex geometries with high 
precision. Electroforming eliminates most of the constraints associated with these 
other techniques and has been used for more than 30 years to produce hardware 
for space applications.
Electroforming is a process in which a metal component is fabricated by elec­
trodeposition on a mandrel in a plating bath as shown in Figure 7.17. Subsequent 
removal of the mandrel results in a shell with the desired internal features. Exam­
ples of parts that can be created using electroforming are shown in Figure 7.18. The 
most common material used is copper since the plating solution can be formulated 
to provide very good leveling capability to allow plating in deep recesses with sharp 
corners. Copper also has very good electrical conductivity for low loss and good 
thermal conductivity to transfer heat in high-power applications.
The internal surfaces are usually left as electroformed since electroformed cop­
per at C-, Ku-, and even Ka-band frequencies do not have significantly higher loss 
than silver. There is also no need to treat the copper surface for corrosion protec­
tion since the parts are normally stored in typical laboratory environments. Elec­
troformed copper can maintain its original shine under standard laboratory envi­
ronments. Electroforming provides benefits such as high precision, inspection of 
internal features, uniform internal plating, and fabrication of complex shapes and 
is ideally suited where low PIM is critical.
The high mechanical precision permitted by electroforming allows high-per­
formance antenna feeds to be produced without the need for tuning screws. This 
in turn improves power handling and further reduces PIM risks. Tolerances are 
limited by the accuracy of the machined mandrel, which can be as tight as ±0.0002 
in. Waveguide components up to 1.2 THz have been realized using electroforming.
The internal features of the final electroformed part can easily be inspected on 
the mandrel because the electroformed shell’s internal features exactly replicate the 
external features of the mandrel.
If internal plating is required, it is applied on the mandrel first before electro­
forming. This results in a more uniform plating than can be achieved by plating in­

side a component after fabrication as would be the case with other manufacturing 
methods.
Electroforming is ideally suited for manufacturing high-precision parts with 
very complex internal geometries in a single piece without joints. This provides the 
designer with greater freedom to choose and locate internal features, allowing the 
potential for higher RF performance while maintaining a compact envelope.
The absence of tuning screws and split joints and a significant reduction in 
flange connections make this process ideally suited for PIM critical hardware.
7.4   Feed Examples
Using the components described earlier, a wide variety of feeds can be realized for 
specific applications. In some applications the feed can be very simple, whereas in 
others the requirements are such that the feed has to include many waveguide com­
ponents. A number of feed examples are presented in this section to illustrate what 
can be created using the various components described earlier.
7.4.1  Standard C-Band Feed
An ultracompact C-band assembly feed with dual band (Tx and Rx) and dual CP 
(LHCP and RHCP) that meets stringent RF requirements, including high power

Feed Assemblies, Passive Intermodulation, Multipaction, and Corona 
and low PIM over the standard frequency band, is shown in Figure 7.19. This 
configuration is based on using a turnstile junction to separate Tx from Rx signals 
because of the wide operating bandwidth of 56%. The common port of the junction 
is in a square or circular waveguide to support two orthogonal signals and is large 
enough to allow both Tx and Rx signals to propagate. The Rx port of the junction 
is reduced in size to allow only orthogonal signals at Rx frequencies to propagate.
The junction has four coupling waveguides with lowpass filters to reject the Rx 
signal and allow only the Tx signal to pass through. A short-slot coupler is used in 
the Tx path to separate the input signal into two components with equal amplitude 
and in-phase quadrature. The two components then excite orthogonal components 
in phase quadrature in the junction via H-plane tees to generate a CP signal. Excit­
ing the other port of the short-slot coupler provides the orthogonal CP signal. A 
septum polarizer is connected to the Rx port of the junction to generate CP signals 
at Rx frequencies.
A transition is used to connect the junction and the horn with minimum impact 
on return loss and higher order mode excitation. All components of the feed includ­
ing the horn are included in the design to ensure that overall performances at as­
sembly level were met. The tuning-less high-performance network was realized by 
electroforming without any hardware iterations. The use of electroforming allowed 
this complex network to be built with a minimum number of flanged connections. 
This reduces PIM risks and allows the unit to fit within about a cubic foot, which 
is very compact at C-band.
A summary of measured performance is listed in Table 7.1. Excellent agree­
ment was achieved between measurements and simulations for all electrical param­
eters. Typical measured copolar and cross-polar patterns are shown in Figure 7.20 
along with simulated patterns.
This network can easily be reconfigured as a dual-band, dual-LP standard C-
band feed by removing the Tx short-slot coupler and replacing the Rx septum 
polarizer with an asymmetric OMT as shown in Figure 7.21. All other components 
would remain unchanged.
7.4.2  Standard Ku-Band Feeds
The standard Ku-band can be realized in a layout that is simpler than for the stan­
dard C-band feed since it only has to operate over 28% bandwidth. An example

of a dual-band, dual-LP feed is shown in Figure 7.22. A symmetric OMT is used 
to separate the dual-LP signals over both the Tx and Rx bands. A pair of diplexers 
is then used to separate the Tx and Rx bands with sufficient isolation between the 
bands.
This feed provides very high RF performance in a compact layout. The absence 
of tuning screws provides high-power handling and very low PIM at extremely low

temperatures. This feed has been tested and showed no evidence of third-order PIM 
with up to 150W carriers at -120C with a noise floor below -145 dBm.
This symmetric OMT-based layout can easily be configured for different ap­
plications. For example, adding a corrugated polarizer between the horn and the 
OMT provides dual CP as shown in Figure 7.23. The diplexers can also be removed 
or replaced with filters if fewer ports are required. Table 7.2 provides a summary of 
measured performance for a four-port LP feed.
In cases where both CP and LP functionality are required from the same feed, 
a turnstile junction can be used. Such an example is shown in Figure 7.24. Here 
the Tx signal is CP and the Rx signal is LP. The Tx signal could be LP by removing 
the short-slot coupler, and the Rx signal could be CP by using a septum polarizer.

7.4.3  K-Ka-Band Feed
The same approach and methodology used to design and build the standard C-
band feed can be adapted for a compact dual-CP feed operating at K- and Ka-band 
frequencies. This feed is shown in Figure 7.25 and a summary of measured perfor­
mances is given in Table 7.3.
7.4.4  Low Profile K-Ka-Band Network for Feed Array
The K-Ka-band feed shown earlier is based on a single turnstile junction. Although 
it is very compact, it is still not ideal where tight packaging is required as in an ar­
ray configuration. By using a second junction, a more streamlined network can be 
realized as shown in Figure 7.26. In this approach, a septum polarizer is used to 
generate CP and the second junction is used to separate the CP signal into its linear 
components before recombining into the first junction. The first junction with ap­
propriate filters is again used to separate Tx from Rx signals. Electroforming is used 
to fabricate this part with a minimum number of flange joints and no tuning screws. 
A summary of measured performance is listed in Table 7.4.

7.4.5  K-Ka-Q-Band Network
An example of a tri-band dual-CP feed operating at K-, Ka-, and Q-bands was 
shown earlier in Figure 7.14. The design uses the turnstile junction to extract each 
of the frequency bands at specific locations along the feed. The challenge here is to 
design the junction used to extract the lowest frequency band such that excitation 
of higher modes is kept to acceptable levels at the higher frequencies. Precision RF 
CAD is used extensively to minimize higher order mode excitation while achieving 
acceptable RF performance in terms of band isolation, return loss, insertion loss, 
power handling, and axial ratio. Electroforming is again used to realize this feed 
network with high precision. A summary of measured performance is shown in 
Table 7.5.

parator network. A number of components are packaged in a cross section that is 
less than 3.1 in. × 3.5 in. Four WR62 waveguides ports provide the desired CP sum 
and difference signals. As with all almost all feeds produced by electroforming, no 
tuning is required. A summary of measured performance is listed in Table 7.6.

7.5  Qualification and Protoflight Testing
Unlike ground-based antenna systems, spaceborne antennas are not serviceable. To 
reduce the risk of in-orbit failure or performance degradation, the feeds are sub­
jected to extensive testing to validate workmanship and performance. New designs 
typically require rigorous testing on a qualification unit to prove out the design and 
fabrication. Once that is done, subsequent units usually only require protoflight 
(PF) or acceptance testing. Qualification testing differs from PF and acceptance 
testing in that the hardware is exposed to more extreme levels of temperature and 
vibration. In addition, high-power and multipaction tests may be required depend­
ing on operating power levels. Qualification-tested hardware is not used on the 
satellite, because the environmental testing consumes a significant portion of its 
usable fatigue life.
After the feed is fabricated, preliminary tests are performed to verify RF perfor­
mances. In some cases the feed is subjected to thermal conditioning at this stage to 
remove stresses that may have been induced during manufacturing. Once prelimi­
nary testing has confirmed that the feed is performing as expected under ambient 
condition, it is subjected to a formal performance validation test, which can follow 
the sequence as shown in Figure 7.28. The general idea for the flow is to perform 
a sequence of tests similar to what the feed will be subjected to during launch and 
subsequent operation. Some tests however are more practical when performed on

the network only, without the horn. These tests are performed at the beginning 
before integration with the horn.
RF tests are usually done before and after each environmental test (high power, 
multipaction, vibration, thermal cycling) to verify that the feed performance has 
not changed. Post-environmental RF tests are sometimes known as health checks 
and can be a subset of the tests performed before environmental tests. Changes may 
indicate degradation that could negatively impact the integrity of the feed. Any dis­
crepancy detected during the formal test sequence undergoes detailed investigation 
with strict rules and procedures.
Ambient testing at the network level is generally performed to evaluate return 
loss, insertion loss, rejection between bands, group delay, axial ratio if feed is CP, 
and isolation between polarizations under standard room temperature, pressure, 
and humidity. These are usually performed using a vector network analyzer (VNA). 
The same parameters may need to be evaluated over temperature to ensure that 
performances do not degrade beyond expected levels when operating at the ex­
treme hot and cold temperatures in space.
Ambient testing at the feed level may include return loss, rejection between 
bands, axial ratio if feed is CP, and isolation between polarizations under standard 
room temperature, pressure, and humidity. Radiation patterns may also be required 
to characterize gain, copolarized patterns, cross-polarized patterns, and axial ratio 
if the feed is CP. In general, the horn performance is not tested over temperature 
since it is not very practical to do so and its construction and design are such that 
performances are not likely to change significantly at temperature extremes. This 
assumption of course must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis since some horn 
designs and construction may be more sensitive to temperature extremes.
Thermal cycling testing is performed to ensure that the feed design, materials, 
and workmanship can survive the multitude of thermal cycles to which it will be 
subjected during operation in space. Thermal cycling can be performed in a convec­
tion heated and cooled chamber, or in a thermal vacuum chamber. If a convection

chamber is used, an inert gas is typically used to purge the chamber during testing 
to prevent moisture from accumulating during the cold cycles and oxidation dur­
ing the hot cycles. Thermocouples are placed at specific locations along the feed to 
monitor its temperature during the cycles.
Sine and random vibration tests are performed to verify that the hardware will 
perform properly through the launch environment. The levels are flowed down by 
the spacecraft team and depend on where the unit will be located on the spacecraft 
and what type of launch vehicle will be used. Random levels are typically anywhere 
from 10 to 30 g over 20 to 2000 Hz. Sine levels are typically between 8 and 20 g 
max over 10 to 100 Hz.
Random vibration tests are the more extreme environment for feeds with high­
er natural frequencies. For lower frequencies, however, a sine test will produce 
greater displacement and can be the worst-case environment for large feeds with 
a first natural frequency (FNF) in that range. Both tests are usually required for a 
feed regardless of FNF, so for feeds with higher natural frequencies, the sine test is 
simply a way to verify that the first mode is not in the 10- to 100-Hz range and to 
make sure there are no hidden workmanship defects.
The random run times and sine sweep rates are both set to ensure that test 
cycles are well under the fatigue limits. In both cases accelerations are monitored 
at the input and at various locations on the unit. Limiting or notching may be used 
to keep the unit responses from going too high at resonances but must always be 
approved by the spacecraft team, as it changes the input levels.
PIM tests at ambient or over temperature may be required for feeds that sup­
port both uplink and downlink frequencies. When frequencies in the downlink 
band can mix to produce low-order PIM products that fall within the uplink band, 
there is a risk that these products will be produced at levels that can adversely im­
pact the uplink signals. PIM is a serious concern that is hardly discussed in most 
textbooks. It is, however, very important for designers to have a good understand­
ing of its causes and how to minimize the risk of generating PIM. This subject is 
discussed in more details in Section 7.7, which provides the designer some insight 
into PIM as it applies to antennas for communication satellites. 
Multipaction testing is usually required to validate a feed design for high-power 
handling. If sufficient margin exists before multipactor breakdown, testing on sub­
sequent units is usually not required. The onset of multipaction can be predicted 
and is well documented. Section 7.8 provides more details on this phenomenon and 
how to set up and perform multipaction testing.

industry, experience has taught that these phenomena are anything but subtle or 
unexpected due to the harsh environmental conditions and limited available real 
estate. The space industry has dealt with these effects for many years, and they have 
caused substantial delays, cost, and system degradation despite detailed require­
ments, analysis, design, and extensive testing and qualification programs.
This section is intended as a high-power effects primer such that the antenna 
systems designer gains a basic understanding of the most serious known pitfalls 
that could render a perfectly good textbook design useless or cause major redesign. 
Special emphasis is placed on requirements, testing, qualification programs, and 
final verification. These are the most critical mitigation efforts and are the most 
likely to be underestimated because there are no formal industry standards and 
virtually no regularly scheduled training programs within the educational system 
to cover such critical issues. 
7.7  Passive Intermodulation
Passive intermodulation distortion (PIM) is a phenomenon by which passive com­
ponents and/or ordinary “metal-to-metal” contacts, found in and around medium 
and high-power RF transmitters, act like mixers that cause the Tx carrier energy 
to spread in frequency and interfere with neighboring receivers. PIM is a parasitic 
nonlinearity that is distinguished from active intermodulation (AIM), which is the 
result of a nonlinear transfer function commonly known to result from devices that 
exhibit voltage, current, or power gain such as vacuum tubes and transistors.
PIM was first observed on ships as the “rusty-bolt” phenomenon in the 1960s. 
It was later observed on S-band deep space systems and communication satellites in 
UHF and L-band systems [16]. PIM has also been observed as harmonic distortion 
in RF filters. It is possible on any high dynamic range system where transmitters 
and receivers are colocated. PIM is a routine design criterion for all communica­
tion satellites and requires special designs, materials, and extensive test programs 
to circumvent its occurrence on the most PIM-sensitive satellites. 
7.7.1  The PIM Problem
Common items such as standard connectors, cables, filters, antenna components, 
thermal blankets, and supporting structures become inadvertent circuit components 
capable of generating substantial interference to nearby receivers. PIM interference 
is not stable, may exist only under a very narrow set of conditions (a single tempera­
ture, for example), and can have amplitude variations of more than 100 dB. PIM 
is prevalent in satellite communication systems, avionics, ships, deep space probes, 
cellular telephone repeaters, and any application where high-power transmitters are 
used in proximity to sensitive receivers. In the case of a satellite repeater, PIM will 
generate ring-around, self-interference. 
Communication satellite PIM is an interference signal that is generated when a 
transmission line or radiated metal-to-metal interfaces or other nonlinear passive 
components are exposed to the high-power RF energy of the satellite transmitters. 
The interfering signal is collected by the sensitive satellite receiver and “retransmit­
ted” as increased noise or discrete interference to the desired transmitted signal.

�������������������������������������������������������������������
Feed Assemblies, Passive Intermodulation, Multipaction, and Corona 
Sources of PIM can be located within the Tx chain of the satellite or exist externally 
on the spacecraft body.
Figure 7.29 shows satellite repeater PIM with separate transmitting and receiv­
ing antennas that have substantial RF isolation between them. The transmission 
paths of payload systems that have diplexed Tx–Rx antennas are far more suscep­
tible to PIM since there is no inherent isolation between the high-power transmitter 
and the receiver. 
7.7.2  PIM Defined
Passive intermodulation can be functionally defined as a conducting or transmissive 
medium that, above a specific power threshold, exhibits a nonlinear voltage-to-
current transfer that results in the production of harmonics and or spectral spread­
ing for a single RF Tx carrier and produces sums and differences of multiple RF Tx 
carriers and their harmonics. 
PIM can be physically defined as passive transmission components, associated 
hardware, materials, radiated components and hardware in the environment that 
couples some degree of RF transmitted energy, contains a nonlinear property, and 
results in undesired frequency spreading of the Tx energy into Rx bands. 
The effects of PIM can be subtle to the point where they are hardly noticed or 
will not be prevalent until multicarriers or modulation are present and then pos­
sibly only under certain environmental conditions. Even when PIM is precluded 
by intensive analysis and design, a testing program is typically necessary to verify 
workmanship or that the design was implemented properly. 
The worst-case source of PIM is a form of low-pressure or loose metal-to-metal 
contact. Any metal-to-metal interface can produce spurious currents in the pres­
ences of RF energy, especially if it is loose [17]. However, worst-case PIM is caused 
by electron tunneling through angstroms-thick, insulating metal oxide layers that

form on the surface of most metals [16]. So when two metal components are con­
nected, there is some portion of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) interface instead 
of a good electrical metal-to-metal contact everywhere. The presence of RF energy 
can cause a voltage difference between the MIM interfaces, and when the voltage 
potential becomes great enough, electrons tunnel across the insulating interface, 
resulting in a nonlinear voltage-to-current progression. This causes harmonics of a 
single incident radio frequency to be generated and causes harmonics of multiple 
incident frequencies to add and subtract with each other. The harmonics and/or 
the sum and difference of some harmonics can land in a payload Rx band and thus 
cause unwanted interference.
Therefore, sources of PIM produce harmonic distortion in single-carrier sys­
tems and intermodulation distortion in multiple-carrier systems [16] as described 
here: 
Harmonic distortion: the appearance of integer multiple frequencies at the out­
put of the transmitter.
Intermodulation distortion: the appearance of frequencies at the output of the 
transmitter equal to the sums and differences of integer multiples (harmonics) 
of the input frequencies.
The frequency of intermodulation products can be found by the expression in 
Figure 7.30.
Discrete PIM frequencies are located at the sums of integer multiples (m and n) 
of the carrier frequencies, which also determine PIM order. The multiples (m and 
n) can be any integer positive, negative, or zero. The example illustration in Figure 
7.31 gives a partial distribution of PIM products [18, 19]. As the PIM order in­
creases, the “amplitude” of the PIM generally decreases. Thus, the lower the order, 
the more sensitive the system is to PIM.
When Tx carriers are spaced close together, all of the intermodulation products 
near Tx carriers are “odd-order” products and these are the PIM products that 
are typically addressed on communications systems because Tx and Rx frequen­
cies normally exist within the same frequency band (L-band, C-band, etc.). “Even-
order” products typically have less energy than odd-order ones, but still must be 
considered if they dominate in the payload Rx band.
7.7.3  Causes of PIM
There are a variety of voltage, current, or thermally induced sources of PIM: MIM 
junctions, magnetic hysteresis, micro-arcing, and inherent material nonlinearity 
(molecular) as follows:

Common Sources of Voltage-to-Current Nonlinearities [16]
••
Electron tunneling: This penetration of a barrier of higher potential occurs 
as a result of MIM junctions. MIM junctions result when metals such as 
aluminum or stainless steel come into contact with that form surface oxides 
layers. Oxide layers are typically 20 to 40 Å thick. 
••
Electron discharges: Electrons bridge a gap between conductive structures 
(i.e., gas ionization, micro-arcing, field emission).
••
Magnetic hysteresis: Nonlinearities are caused by the use of ferromagnetic 
materials, magnetic nickel, stainless steel, and so forth.
••
Carbon fiber composites and graphite materials:  PIM is probably due to 
low-pressure contacts between fibers providing voltage-dependent current 
paths.
••
Certain known nonlinear materials and metals such as loaded circuit board 
dielectrics, conductive thin films, and so forth. 
••
Semiconductor (diode) junctions, dissimilar metal-to-metal contacts. 
••
RF switches (during transition).
••
Transmission line surface finish irregularities. 
••
Electrothermal nonlinear effects [20] of low thermal mass transmission line 
components resulting in current-dependent resistance, and so forth.
Although many of the published articles discourage the use of graphite and fer­
romagnetic materials and the other nonlinear materials listed above, loose metal­
lic connections or MIM junctions (Figure 7.32) are by far the most common and 
worst generators of PIM. They are caused by voltage-induced electron tunneling

and some are possibly combined with microdischarging. Also, since the above list­
ed nonlinear materials and others found in the public domain can be eliminated 
during the design phase, the MIM interface remains the most troublesome and 
unpredictable source of PIM.
7.7.4  Mathematical Definition [18, 19]
Linear System
Consider a “source of PIM” to be excited by two carrier signals of frequency f1 and 
f2. The term Vi is the voltage sum of the combined signals and V1 and V2 are voltage 
amplitudes of the two carriers and t = time.
	
Vi = V1 cos(2πf1 t) + V2 cos(2πf2t) 	
 (7.2)
For a linear system the current can be expressed as:	
	
Ilinear = A0Vi	
where A0 is the amplitude coefficient of the system (gain or loss) and Ilinear is the 
linear output of the current. Figure 7.33 shows the linear system response. 
Nonlinear System
A nonlinear device does not obey Ohm’s law, and the relation of current and voltage 
is a curve that is commonly represented by an nth-order power series:

Inonlinear = A0Vi + A1Vi2 + A2Vi3+A3Vi4 + ... 	
(7.3)
The current Inonlinear is the sum of the linear output term (A0Vi) plus the sum of 
the nonlinear terms. The amplitude coefficients A0...An depend on the voltage-to-
current properties of the nonlinear PIM junction. 
Substituting the expression for Vi from (7.2) into (7.3) gives the nonlinear spec­
trum of Inonlinear for a single condition of PIM. Figure 7.34 shows the nonlinear 
system response. The linear amplitude coefficient A0 in the previous plot has been 
eliminated to emphasize the intermodulation energy that is present. 
 The curve in Figure 7.35 represents the accompanying DC to millimeter-wave 
nonlinear voltage-to-current characteristic (that can be measured on a PIM junc­
tion with a low-frequency curve tracer), which is dependent on the instantaneous 
magnitude of the transmitted signal. This curve [21] is defined by the amplitude 
terms: A0, A1, A2, A3,.... The previous chart in Figure 7.34 shows intermodulation 
products that exist close to the Tx carrier frequencies. Sources of PIM produce 
both harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion over a much broader 
range of frequency.
The chart in Figure 7.36(a) shows a single 0.26-GHz carrier gradual taper of 
even- and odd-order harmonic distortion responses. The chart in Figure 7.36(b)

carrier response.

tion over a broad band of frequencies for a two-carrier response.

The chart in Figure 7.38 shows a typical power transfer curve for a single third-
order intermodulation product resulting from the passive nonlinearity of a stan­
dard SMA connector. In this case, the PIM appears well ordered and predictable. 
However, MIM junctions are routinely unstable and exhibit both nonlinearity, as 
shown, plus attributes of an extremely intermittent connection. This makes them 
both difficult to predict and difficult to measure. Therefore, the safest route is to 
avoid them through good design and PIM mitigation techniques.

7.7.6  PIM Mitigation
PIM mitigation is an activity that is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the 
increased dynamic range of communication systems and an increase in the sheer 
number of new communication systems. PIM mitigation techniques vary widely 
depending on hardware, requirements, design philosophy, and local culture.
It is not the intention here to provide detailed design criterion but to raise 
awareness of the issue and emphasize requirements definitions and testing and

verification methods. Suffice it to say that in the presence of high-power RF, PIM 
can be avoided in most cases by providing an excellent oxide-free RF electrical 
connection or decoupling direct metal-to-metal RF paths (electrical isolation) and 
by avoiding known nonlinear material. Substantial design information regarding 
materials and hardware configuration is available within the public domain (see 
the list of references at the end of this chapter) and review the list in Section 7.7.3 
for causes of PIM. 
7.7.7  Susceptible Systems
System susceptibility begins with calculating the lowest PIM order as given above 
using two carriers within the Tx band of a multicarrier system or the lowest har­
monic that lands within a susceptible Rx band. 
A PIM order greater than 19th may not require more than good workmanship 
using standard RF components, construction techniques, and connectors to avoid 
PIM interference in many systems. However, the lowest orders will require substan­
tial PIM mitigation especially within high-power Tx–Rx diplexed antenna systems. 
Separating the Tx and Rx antennas will effectively relieve excessive susceptibility 
within the high-power transmission line but exterior radiated hardware in proxim­
ity to the antennas may yet have extreme sensitivity even at low power especially 
with longer wavelengths (≥6 in.). Radiated Tx flux and Rx coupling analysis cou­
pled with a component test program will further define PIM susceptibility.
7.7.8  Hardware PIM Requirements
Once PIM susceptibility has been established, hardware requirement compliance 
must be defined to ensure that system operational conditions are satisfied. This is 
typically done by specifying two-carrier PIM test parameters as follows:
••
Transmit band, flow to fhigh – PIM energy source.
••
Transmitter single-carrier power × two carriers.
••
Receive bands, flow to fhigh – PIM target payload.
••
Maximum allowable PIM power at the Rx antenna port (dBm) with little or 
no degradation to receiver noise floor considering the lowest or lowest pre­
dominant PIM order power density over the Rx channel bandwidth.
••
Environmental operating conditions, specifically the thermal range of 
operation.
••
Direction of propagation (reflected or through or radiated).
The PIM requirements for hardware in a radiated environment are the same as 
the above except Tx power is defined in terms of two-channel flux density at the 
radiated hardware location, and allowable PIM is defined as maximum PIM flux 
density at the Rx antenna aperture at a specified distance and angle of illumination 
from the radiated hardware (see Appendixes 7A and 7B).

7.7.9  PIM Test and Verification Methods
Some level of PIM testing is required to verify design and workmanship during 
hardware development depending on the level of risk. Tests are normally conducted 
at ambient temperatures for lower risk hardware or over some degree of thermal 
range for higher risk devices. Usually PIM is more active at lower temperatures or 
especially during temperature transitions.
PIM testing is normally done with two carriers set near the band edges of the 
Tx band. This produces the lowest order, discrete intermodulation products that 
fall in the receiver bandpass. The use of two carriers will force all of the energy of 
the PIM source to fall into a few discrete frequencies that can be predetermined by 
(7.1), to be more readily located during testing. 
Test-Related Terms
••
Reflected PIM: PIM energy that is excited by and is traveling back toward 
the source of the incident energy, usually in reference to Tx–Rx diplexed 
systems.
••
Transmitted PIM or through PIM: PIM energy that is excited by and is trav­
eling in the same direction of the incident energy.
••
Radiated PIM: usually refers to reflected or through PIM in free space.
••
Contact PIM: PIM generated by the contact of any material with another 
“highly” conductive material, such as a metal, while being exposed to RF 
fields.
••
Inherent PIM: a form of contact PIM in which the PIM is generated by con­
tact of the material with itself and/or inherent contacts within the material 
such as a conductive loading.
••
Intrinsic PIM: a form of PIM that results from a noncontacting intrinsic 
molecular nonlinear feature of the material such as magnetic hysteresis or 
semiconductor action.
••
Thermal PIM: A PIM test conducted while thermal cycling a device. This is a 
method of stimulating dormant “contact” PIMs or gap-sensitive PIMs. Some 
contact- or gap-related PIMs are vibration sensitive and some are not, but 
nearly all are thermally sensitive. 
••
Ambient PIM: A PIM test conducted at ambient temperature. This test nor­
mally accompanies some light physical manipulation, or tapping, of the de­
vice under test to stimulate contact PIMs. Some contact- or gap-related PIMs 
can be missed with “ambient-only” tests. 
The PIM test procedure example, listed in Appendix 7C, is a generic procedure 
that can be used for the test configurations discussed next to verify that PIM sensi­
tivity requirements have been met and maintained over the duration of the device 
under test (DUT) PIM testing.

7.7.9.1  Hardline Closed-Loop PIM Test Setups
A closed loop transmission line PIM test configuration can be set up for the trans­
missive or through PIM by directly connecting the Tx reject filter to the DUT out­
put Tx–Rx diplexer or set up for reflective PIM by directly connecting the Tx reject 
filter to the Tx–Rx diplexer at the DUT input. This is the most versatile PIM test 
setup, which can also be used for antenna and/or materials radiative tests. But it is 
the most expensive and difficult PIM test setup to construct. 
Figure 7.39 shows a Tx multiplexed, Tx–Rx diplexed transmission line setup. 
Other carrier power-combining methods are shown in Figures 7.40 and 7.41. The 
passively combined method of Figure 7.40 causes half of the transmitted power to 
be dissipated in the hybrid load. The actively combined method of Figure 7.41 gen­
erates high-level active intermodulation (AIM) that requires low connector leakage 
and/or shielding for radiated tests and a high degree of receive reject filtering up to 
180 dB.

7.7.9.2  Radiated PIM Test Setups
The space combined reflected free-space PIM test, shown in Figure 7.42, consists of 
a PIM test setup that transmits radiated energy to the DUT. The resulting DUT PIM 
energy travels back to a test setup receiver. This configuration requires minimal 
filtering mainly to reduce power amplifier noise that is generated in the Rx band. 
In most cases, standard (non-PIM design) filters can be used since the carriers are 
space combined. This is useful for testing reflectors, hardware samples, materials, 
and so forth, only in a radiative, reflective measurement configuration.
The radiated PIM test configuration of Figure 7.43 is useful for reflective/
transmissive antenna or reflective free-space device/material radiated PIM testing. 
Shown in the reflected or Tx–Rx diplexed configuration, a separate Rx antenna or 
a probe used for troubleshooting may also be connected to the receiver for PIM 
transmissive tests. 
7.7.9.3  PIM Measurement Considerations
It is preferable to use circularly polarized test antennas during radiative tests of 
materials and devices to overcome polarization sensitivities within the DUT. In test 
setups having a DUT Rx band matched source and load as in Figure 7.39:

••
Measurements in the through or transmissive configuration will contain an 
in-phase summation of all PIMs within the DUT. 
••
Measurements in the reflected configuration will result in a vector summa­
tion of distance related or distributed phase of all sources of PIM for electri­
cally large devices with multiple sources of PIM.
••
Reflected and through PIM will measure approximately the same for electri­
cally small devices that contain multiple sources of PIM.
7.7.9.4  General Filter Requirements
The filtering pass band of the PIM test setup can be designed to cover several PIM 
orders so they may be selected for current and future use. For example, if the system 
test requirement is for a fifth- or seventh-order PIM, design the PIM test setup to 
enable a third-order test in which the fifth- and seventh-order PIM products can be 
made to land at the same Rx frequency as the third simply by setting the Tx carrier 
closer together within the Tx band.
••
The transmit multiplexer must be designed to handle the full rated power of 
the amplifiers and provide enough channel-to-channel rejection (about –30 
dB at the band edges) for the amplifiers to safely operate.
••
The receive reject filters must be designed for low PIM operation and provide 
enough rejection to eliminate the passives generated by the multiplexer or 
combiner. Elimination of the AIM, generated by the amplifier in a single-
amplifier system, can require filter rejection to a level of less than –160 dBm. 
Typically the rejection for passives should be –80 to –100 dB and rejection 
for actives should be rated according to the “third-order intercept point” of 
the amplifier. Low PIM connectors must be used at the DUT ports.
••
The Tx–Rx diplexer must also be designed for low PIM operation and should 
have a minimum rejection of –35 dB to avoid PIM from the connector inter­
faces. Standard connections can be made at the Rx port, but low PIM con­
nectors must be used at the common port and Tx port.
••
The transmit reject filter prevents low-noise amplifier (LNA) saturation by 
the Tx carriers. The minimum rejection required is established by the range 
in decibels from the saturation input level of the LNA (its maximum output 
minus the gain) to the maximum output level of the transmitter. The diplexer 
rejection can be added to the rejection of the Tx reject filter to achieve the 
minimum required rejection. Typical values are –80 to –110 dB.
7.7.9.5  PIM Receive/Spectrum Analyzer
Because PIM-sensitive hardware by definition would incorporate a high dynamic 
range and, therefore, a very sensitive receiving system, the PIM setup receiver would 
also require high sensitivity. This is achieved by the use of a low-noise preamplifier 
and the use of narrow intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidths.
Typically PIM measurements are done at IF bandwidths between 10 and 100 
Hz. This requires the receiver to have a high-stability frequency standard (reference 

318 
�������������������������������������������������������������������
Feed Assemblies, Passive Intermodulation, Multipaction, and Corona 
oscillator) and a frequency locking capability. The dynamic range of the receiver 
should be at least 50 dB and is normally closer to 100 dB to capture the wild varia­
tions due to PIM. 
Normally, a spectrum analyzer set for 10 Hz IF resolution bandwidth is used 
with a 30- to 50-dB gain LNA to obtain an average noise floor of approximately 
-155 to -160 dBm depending on system losses.
7.7.9.6  Frequency Source
Because the ultimate sensitivity of the PIM test setup receiver is directly related to 
the frequency stability of the system, frequency locking capability is required. The 
PIM receiver and both frequency sources must be locked to the same high-stability 
reference oscillator. 
7.7.9.7  PIM Test Setup Sensitivity and System Noise [22]
The required sensitivity of the PIM test setup receiver will be driven by the ultimate 
PIM sensitivity of the DUT and should be one to two orders of magnitude better 
that the DUT to ensure measurement margin.
The test system sensitivity can be determined by finding the kTSB noise floor. 
This is defined as follows: 
	
N
floor = kTSB
where:
B = receiver bandwidth (Hz).
TS = system noise temperature (deg).
k = 1.38 × 10–23 J/K, which is Boltzmann’s constant (heat capacity).
7.7.9.9  PIM Test System Noise Temperature
The system noise temperature, TS, contains contributions from the antenna, the 
antenna feed, the LNA, and the PIM test setup receiver or spectrum analyzer. This 
consists of the following: 
	
TS = Tant + T0(L - 1) + LT0(FLNA  - 1) + LT0(FRx - 1)/GLNA	
where:
Tant = antenna or load noise temperature (290 K).
L = losses between antenna and LNA (a power ratio).
FLNA = LNA noise factor (a power ratio).
FRx = receiver or spectrum analyzer noise factor (a power ratio).
GLNA = LNA gain (a power ratio).
T0 = ambient temperature (290 K).

7.7.9.9  PIM Verification
It should be noted that PIM test setup verification is the most important aspect in 
the PIM measurement.
Because test data is relied on to qualify critical hardware, system failure can 
result if PIM testing does not properly detect sources of PIM. Therefore, it is cru­
cial to have correct initial calibration and a procedure in place that will guarantee 
continuous PIM test setup sensitivity throughout the duration of the test. 
The key items that will ensure PIM test setup verification are listed as follows:
••
Ensuring accurate initial calibration: Includes accurate Tx power levels, ab­
solute Rx levels, and PIM source (initiator) verification
••
Ensuring the correct intermodulation product is located: Most of the time 
the correct product is easy to find and this is not an issue. However, in some 
cases this gets missed and a spur, electromagnetic interference (EMI), or other 
PIM product is inadvertently monitored in lieu of the specified product and 
the test is therefore invalid.
••
Ensuring calibrated setup conditions do not change midtest:  Continuously 
monitor Tx power and periodically recheck the PIM source.
••
Ensuring accurate final calibration: Repeat initial calibration routine and 
PIM source verification.
The key elements to PIM verification can be implemented as discussed next.
Pretest Calibration
This consists of precise calibration of Tx power and Rx channel and then verifica­
tion by measuring with an external calibrated standard. On hard-line tests a power 
meter with a high-power sensor can be used to verify Tx power at the DUT. A 
calibrated RF radiation meter can be used to verify Tx flux for radiated tests. The 
receiving channel amplitude is verified by connecting directly to a calibrated fre­
quency source while incrementing amplitude to ensure that the receiver and data 
collection system track amplitude changes and absolute level.
Pretest PIM Source Initiator
Once calibration has been established, a known source of PIM such as a medium-
gain antenna attached to a mixer can be used to verify radiated PIM tests or a mixer 
attached to a Tx coupled port can be used to monitor hard-line tests. In the radi­
ated tests, the PIM source should be placed in a fixed position where changes in Tx 
power up and down are recognizable and where a significant and stable PIM level 
can be monitored. Placing the PIM source in this position should produce repeat­
able results if nothing has changed in the setup.
PIM Frequency Verification
The receiver center frequency of the PIM is verified by measuring the frequency 
of each Tx carrier using the Rx channel analyzer and calculating the exact PIM 
frequency per (7.1) of Figure 7.30 (see Section 7.7.2), then setting the Rx spectrum 
analyzer to that exact frequency. Install a PIM source and find the generated PIM at 

320 
�������������������������������������������������������������������
Feed Assemblies, Passive Intermodulation, Multipaction, and Corona 
or very near the calculated frequency. If measuring a repeater link or intermediate 
frequency, measure the carrier frequency, obtain the translation frequency from the 
system engineers, and again calculate as in (7.1) of Figure 7.30 (see Section 7.7.2) 
considering the translation frequency.
Once the exact PIM frequency has been centered, the spectrum analyzer fre­
quency span is set to 0 Hz such that continuous monitoring for PIM over time is 
enabled. The spectrum analyzer and the Tx frequency source must be locked to the 
same local oscillator (LO) for stable frequency readings within a 10-Hz bandwidth.
PIM Test Setup Residual PIM Verification
Once the Rx channel PIM frequency has been verified, the PIM source is removed 
and the test setup residual PIM floor (Rx channel noise floor plus setup PIM) is veri­
fied either with a surrogate DUT or through connection (no DUT). An acceptable 
residual or setup PIM floor is a least 10 dB below the DUT PIM requirement at full 
Tx power. If the measured level is not low enough, the setup or chamber needs to 
be diagnosed and repaired for arbitrary sources of PIM or potential EMI ingress 
from external sources.
Periodic PIM Source Calibration Checks
Verification of frequency, PIM sensitivity, and Tx power needs to be taken at vari­
ous points for a test that lasts longer than an hour. Because narrow IF bandwidths 
are used for PIM testing, frequency drift of only a few hertz can cause amplitude 
errors of the Rx channel. Therefore, replacing the PIM source in the known fixed 
position as described earlier and verifying that the PIM level is repeatable serve as 
verification that nothing has changed in the setup since the initial calibration. If the 
level has changed, set the analyzer’s frequency span to 100 or 300 Hz and record 
the difference in level between the center frequency reading and the peak reading, 
then recenter the frequency and reset for 0 Hz.
Post-Test Calibration
The first step here is an end-of-test PIM source check. Next, perform the same steps 
as done for the pretest calibration. Record any differences. 
See Appendix 7C for an example test procedure that can be used to ensure the 
items above are implemented during testing. This can be used as part of a boiler­
plate test procedure.
7.8  Multipactor, Corona, and Ionization Breakdown
This section presents an overview of known and predictable high-power RF voltage 
breakdown effects that are capable of causing system degradation ranging from 
interfering intermodulation and/or noise, to gradual hardware deterioration, to in­
stantaneous and catastrophic hardware failure. The intention of this section is to 
raise awareness and give a basic understanding of the phenomena with a focus on 
requirements, test, and verification.

7.8.1  Multipactor
Multipactor is well known and well-documented electron discharge phenomena 
dating back to Philo T. Farnsworth’s early 20th-century invention of the cold cath­
ode multipactor vacuum tube. Farnsworth used this device as an RF oscillator 
for radio transmissions and also as a current amplifier for his cathode-ray tube 
invention. 
The action of a multipactor is relatively simple and predictable. If a sufficiently 
high-voltage RF field is applied in a vacuum between two parallel surfaces and the 
electron transit time between the plates is an odd multiple of one-half cycle of the 
RF, multipactor is likely to initiate. 
Although conditions might be right for multipactor to occur, RF voltages in 
microwave transmission lines typically do not have the field intensity to cause elec­
trons to directly emit from transmission line surfaces (field emission). Therefore, 
some other mechanism needs to be present to generate free electrons. The free elec­
trons will then accelerate within the RF field with sufficient momentum to initiate 
secondary electrons on collision with the transmission line surfaces.
Multipactor is often initiated by random energetic electrons present in the en­
vironment or by other mechanisms such as released electrons through exposure to 
ultraviolet (UV) light or other forms of radiation. Once initiated, gasses trapped in 
the surface materials may also release and ionize due to collisions with accelerated 
secondary electrons, obscuring pure multipactor until adequate venting evacuates 
the gas. This is followed by the multipactor potential to create an electron ava­
lanche forming a sheet-like cloud of secondary electrons if the secondary electron 
emission (sometimes called SEE) coefficient of the surface is greater than one (δ > 
1) as shown in Figure 7.44.
In Farnsworth’s case, a coating was applied to the surfaces to increase the sec­
ondary emission coefficient in order to actively initiate continuous multipactor 
discharge. In designing high-power RF or microwave transmission hardware, the 
effort is to have the lowest possible secondary electron emission to minimize dam­
aging multipactor effects. However, most materials compatible with high-power 
microwave transmission, such as aluminum, silver, and gold, have a secondary 
emission coefficient that is low but still greater than one. Therefore, it is necessary 
to deliberately design multipactor potential out of a transmission system [23] in 
case the electron transit time happens to exist within the operating parameters of

the system. Although coatings δ < 1 are available, mitigation is more reliably done 
by increasing the gap dimensions between the transmission path surfaces such that 
the electron transit time does not now match the RF operational parameters.
If multipactor is not considered in the design and multipactor discharge occurs, 
the system is likely to fail. The avalanche of electrons traveling back and forth 
perpendicular to the propagation of the RF effectively causes a low-impedance 
conduction path aligned with the electric field that both reflects and absorbs a 
substantial portion of the high-power transmitted energy. While reflected RF may 
be damaging to the system, the usual cause of failure is excessive RF absorption in 
locations along the transmission path that were not designed to dissipate the ad­
ditionally generated heat. This sometimes results in a severely conductive discharge 
event caused by ionization breakdown from local, overheated organic materials 
initiating gas discharge. The resulting intense heat of an ionization breakdown is 
capable of vaporizing metallic components in the area that are not rated for exces­
sive heat dissipation. In this manner, the transmission line may be destroyed.
7.8.1.1  Multipactor Susceptibility
Multipactor susceptibility is defined by frequency, gap distance, RF voltage, and 
surface material secondary emission coefficient [24–26]. Additionally, a high vac­
uum (typically <10–4 Torr) is required along with a random energetic electron or 
other type of initiator. The example chart in Figure 7.45 shows predicted multipac­
tor breakdown for a silver surface δ ≈ 1.6. The X-axis marks the frequency-gap 
related variable (typically referred to as the fd product) and the Y-axis defines the

operational RF voltage determined by total operational power, impedance effects, 
VSWR effects, and multicarrier/frequency spreading effects. The outer envelope of 
the chart gives the multipactor breakdown threshold for uniform fields as found 
between parallel plates. For example, if a frequency of 1 GHz were used in a 50-Ω 
transmission line that had a 0.06-in. gap between the inner conductor and outer 
conductor, the initial breakdown threshold would exist at approximately 65 volts 
rms as indicated.
Breakdown continues to occur until approximately 510V rms. As the voltage is 
increased beyond the upper threshold at 510V, the multipactor will terminate since 
the increased voltage will further accelerate the electron such that the transit time is 
now too rapid to synchronize with the RF half cycle. In practice, devices should be 
designed such that there is sufficient margin to the minimum breakdown voltage; 
in other words, the design should be made such that there is some amount less than 
65V in this particular gap.
One variable that is not included in the chart is the time required to produce 
enough secondary electrons to have a noticeable effect on performance. This has 
been estimated to be something between 20 and 40 electron crossings to accumu­
late a large enough electron cloud. Although evidence exists and it is generally 
agreed upon, this is most likely a conservative estimate. The system multipactor 
susceptibility time frame is determined by the expected time-domain RF operation­
al waveform wherein the peak power envelope exceeds the multipactor threshold 
in Figure 7.46 for a period lasting longer than 20 to 40 crossings. This pertains 
mainly to multicarrier systems where the carriers tend to sum over a very short 
period of time.
Figure 7.46 gives an example of five equally spaced, equal amplitude 5W car­
rier waves all in phase at t = 0 sec. Obviously, the peak power envelope far exceeds 
the given multipactor threshold as shown; however, the peak envelope time period 
falls considerably short of the 20-crossing estimate. The waveform shown is the 
worst case for peak power production but is not typically an operational condition. 
Normally, the operational condition will cause a 20-crossing time period some­
where between total average power and the worst-case peak power. Establishing 
the 20-crossing time base requires an operational waveform analysis and/or multi­
pactor test to determine the multicarrier susceptibility threshold.
The power instantaneous rms voltage waveform can be calculated by the ex­
pression in Figure 7.47.
Although the multipactor peak power summation may potentially initiate mul­
tipactor, the effect to the system may not even be noticeable. This is one of the areas 
that requires an in-depth signal/waveform analysis or multipactor test to determine 
ultimate susceptibility. The other area that potentially requires significant analysis 
is determining the maximum operating voltage within complex hardware such as 
high-power filters and antenna components. Electromagnetic solvers require sig­
nificant knowledge and skill to accurately predict operating voltages. Even then, 
modeling uncertainty, workmanship, contamination, and so forth, may require a 
threshold test of hardware even though a significant margin is predicted. Detailed 
design and analysis information, particularly EM and multicarrier, is not the pur­
pose of this section. However, is it available and covered rather extensively in the 
public domain (see the references at the end of the chapter).

7.8.2  Corona and Ionization Breakdown
Other related but entirely different phenomena are corona and gas ionization break­
down [26]. Both multipactor and ionization breakdown are initiated by electron 
collisions. However, the major difference from multipactor is pressure. Whereas 
multipactor requires a vacuum of at least 10–2 Torr for unobstructed electron flow 
between the surfaces, corona and ionization exist only within a pressurized gas or 
partial pressure environment. When this exists, the path between the surfaces is ob­
structed by the gas where the mean free electron path is shorter than the electrode 
or surface separation such that secondary electron emission now results in collision 
with the gas. This results in an ionized gas rather than a pure electron cloud. Gas 
ionization also can exist within direct current (DC) fields, whereas multipactor is a 
resonant, synchronous time-based electron avalanche resulting only from AC fields. 
The power density of the discharge is also pressure dependent. At pressures 
<10–2 Torr, power density can range from very low at the multipactor threshold 
to intermittent and can have an erratically high density during high current mul­
tipactor where the electron current becomes large enough to partially short the 
incident energy. When this takes place, the incident RF voltage may drop below

the multipactor threshold and multipactor momentarily ceases to exist. As the RF 
voltage then recovers, the multipactor cycle repeats. 
On the other hand, gas ionization may run the gamut from a very weak power 
density at low pressure (plasma globe) to an extremely intense high-current local­
ized plasma arc at higher pressures (plasma arc welding). As such, corona generally 
refers to a nonthermal discharge, whereas arc discharge refers to high temperature 
or thermal discharge. Obviously, the high-pressure plasma arc is the most destruc­
tive, potentially reaching temperatures in excess of 10,000ºC near atmospheric 
pressure. This is a major concern for satellite waveguides operating at high power 
densities such as WR75 and WR51 in ambient pressure [27].
If an arc is initiated by any form of vaporizing debris, the ambient gas will 
sustain the arc and it will travel back to the RF power source at a relatively slow 
speed (a few meters/second or less) until it encounters an obstacle such as a wave­
guide window. If temperatures are sufficient, it will crack the window and destroy 
the hardware. Extreme care must therefore be taken to circumvent any form of 
metallic debris or organic debris within the waveguide that might overheat and 
vaporize. This would include bonding agents commonly used in waveguide load 
manufacturing. 
Because gas ionization breakdown involves electrically charged particles creat­
ing an electrically conductive discharge within the high-power transmission path, 
it appears with similar attributes as multipactor discharge. Therefore, the same 
screening test can be used to detect both phenomena with the only difference being 
the test pressure. Multipactor is always tested in high vacuum (<10–4 Torr), where­
as corona is tested from ambient pressure through partial pressure to high vacuum. 
Of course, inadvertent gas discharge (heat releasing trapped gases from surfaces) 
during corona testing can give a similar test response as multipactor depending on 
the monitoring scheme.
7.8.3  Hardware Test Requirements
Hardware requirements are typically given in terms of margin to analysis and/or 
margin to test. In simple types of hardware, where multipactor margin can be ac­
curately predicted, analysis with significant margin may be sufficient in lieu of a 
test requirement. In other cases and with certain philosophies, unit tests may be 
required of all hardware. At a minimum in all cases, a system-level operational test 
in vacuum is required to discover unpredictable items such as contamination and 
workmanship. Requirements for multipactor tests are usually defined as follows:
••
Test average power: The actual operational rms power considering potential 
limiter faults (amplifier saturation), VSWR effects, optimistic RF insertion 
losses, plus some small degree of margin that does not overstress the hard­
ware but creates the operational heating effects.
••
Peak power: This is determined from the momentary summation of rms 
power of each amplifier (considering all the carriers), the minimum number 
of electron crossings at the multipactor threshold, plus those listed in the pre­
ceding entry (test average power). It is the anticipated peak test power with 
some practical degree of margin to multipactor depending on the system. 

326 
�������������������������������������������������������������������
Feed Assemblies, Passive Intermodulation, Multipaction, and Corona 
During a multipactor or corona test, average and peak power are run con­
currently by running a peak power pulse with an average power duty cycle. 
The peak power is to deliver the correct voltage to the device, while the aver­
age power is to apply the correct thermal load.
••
Operational frequency band: This can include frequency and power of the 
system carriers with a requirement to test at a specific power-weighted aver­
age frequency (see the expression in Figure 7.48). In single-carrier devices 
that have a large operational band, it is sufficient to test at the worst-case 
frequency based on the susceptibility curves.
••
Pretest high-vacuum soak: This is typically done at ambient temperature in 
high vacuum for a minimum of 12 hours for multipactor tests. In the case 
where the unit under test has poor venting or volatile materials, a soak of 
24 hours or more may be needed to ensure the entire unit is at a vacuum 
pressure and not in the critical pressure region where corona may occur. For 
a corona test, a unit should soak in ambient air for at least an hour before 
beginning testing if it has recently been in a vacuum environment.
••
Operational temperature limits: All metal devices are usually tested at the 
maximum operational temperature. Devices that contain dielectrics, with 
thermally sensitive gaps, are tested over a minimum and maximum thermal 
cycle. Corona tests are typically done at ambient temperature to simulate the 
operational environment of launch.
••
Free-electron source: This is normally a radioactive cesium source (Cs-137) 
on or slightly upstream of the predicted most likely location on the hardware 
to break down (small gap with high voltage). Other possible free-electron 
sources include strontium (Sr-90) or an electron gun.
••
Multipactor initiator: An initiator is required to prove the multipactor test 
setup is capable of detecting multipactor independent of the device under 
test. This is a device that is designed and built to break down at a known 
threshold near the test article’s maximum input power level. Power is ap­
plied to this device prior to the actual unit under test to prove that the test 
equipment is sensitive enough to detect breakdown. This is ideally done both 
before and after the actual unit test. This is done for corona tests as well.
••
Surrogate device: In cases where a DUT fails a high-power test, it may be 
necessary to have a replacement device to demonstrate that the test setup is 
not causing the DUT to fail. In coaxial devices, this may be a barrel; in wave­
guide devices, it may be a piece of regular waveguide.
••
Test pressure requirements: Multipactor testing can occur only when pres­
sures in the chamber are below 10–4 Torr (and after the soak times described 
earlier for the pretest high-vacuum soak). Units undergoing multipactor

testing should have a dry run at ambient pressure before being tested for 
multipactor in high vacuum. Corona is tested from ambient pressure through 
partial pressure to high vacuum at a controlled rate slower than the opera­
tional profile. 
••
Venting requirements: High-power vacuum tests require adequate venting 
such that vaporizing trapped gas will rapidly escape the high-power RF field 
areas and the unit internal pressure will reach high vacuum in a reasonable 
amount of time to test.
7.8.3.1  Multipactor Testing
There are many ways to meet the hardware test requirements outlined in the last 
section, but several best practices have been developed in the industry that allow 
for reliable results.
The most important part of a multipactor test is determining the detection 
methods. There are many ways to detect multipactor, and it is beyond the scope of 
this text to provide details, but some of the most common detection methods are 
listed here. It is required in any test to have at least two detection methods and it 
is always better to have more. A test failure is defined as simultaneous multipactor 
detection on two or more unrelated detection methods.
••
Nulling of forward/reverse power: Consists of a continuously variable at­
tenuator and phase shifter that are used to null the forward and reverse 
power to a level close to the noise floor of a spectrum analyzer. Any sudden 
increases in the null indicate an event has occurred. The null must be con­
tinuously adjusted during the test to remain useful.
••
Third harmonic noise: A highpass filter is coupled at the output of the trans­
mission that rejects lower harmonics. Multipactor is seen as a sudden pertur­
bation in the third harmonic signal on a spectrum analyzer.
••
Monitoring bias current: Current from an event is detected on a picoamme­
ter through a bias-T and a services battery box. The RF path of the device 
must not have a path to ground.
••
Electron probes: Current from an event is detected on a picoammeter through 
a services battery box. An electron probe is placed near a vent hole to detect 
the electrons.
••
Forward/reverse/output power detection: In any test, the power levels are 
monitored. During an event, the input power can be substantially reflected 
(and the output power attenuated). This is a much slower detection methods, 
but an indicator nonetheless.
The test equipment used for a multipactor test can vary widely depending on 
the detection methods, power level required, and the test frequency. However, a 
typical test consists of a block diagram very similar to that shown in Figure 7.49. 
This test setup uses two of the most common detection methods, a forward/re­
flected null and third harmonic detection. The detection methods for corona are 
typically the same.

7.8  Multipactor, Corona, and Ionization Breakdown 
329
There are a few important notes about the test equipment. First, the spectrum 
analyzers used must be set to a 0-Hz span (to view the data in the time domain) 
and have a video-out port connected to a data collection system or strip chart (to 
overcome the screen refresh rate) to ensure all events are detected. Simply using the 
maximum hold feature on the screen is not sufficient to declare success in a test 
because potential events could be missed. However, these events may be visible on 
the strip chart due to the video-out feature if the sampling rate is fast enough.
Next, the high-power amplifier (HPA) selection is very important; there are 
several options to meet requirements. Continuous-wave (CW) amplifiers are com­
mon and can be used if one can be located that provides a high enough power level 
for the test. Unfortunately, with some tests, the power level needed after adding 
margins is too high for a CW amplifier. Because the peak power is what matters 
for inducing multipactor, a very low duty cycle pulsed amplifier can be used. A CW 
amplifier can also be applied to obtain the required average power for heating, if 
needed. If a pulsed high-power amplifier is not available, a ring resonator can be 
used for closed loop tests. A resonant ring can passively amplify an input signal 
from a lower power amplifier by a factor of 10 or more. The lower the loss in the 
ring, the higher the amplification it provides.
To ensure that a high-power test is yielding meaningful results, several sequen­
tial steps should be followed:
1.	 The test equipment must be set up properly according to the block diagram 
and all measurement devices must be calibrated. 
2.	 A surrogate device should be installed in place of the DUT and the power 
increased to full level at ambient pressure to ensure that the setup can 
handle the power. 
3. 	 Repeat step 2 with the DUT. 
4.	 To demonstrate that the test setup itself is multipactor free, the surrogate 
device should be installed once again, but this time pumped down to vacu­
um and soaked. Power should be applied and all detection methods moni­
tored for any signs of breakdown. This proves that any events seen during 
the test are from the DUT and not the setup. If a corona test is being per­
formed, this step should include power on from ambient through vacuum 
to demonstrate the setup will not have corona effects.
5.	 The known multipactor device (multipactor initiator) should be installed 
in the chamber. (Ideally, the penetration plate will have enough ports to 
have the DUT and initiator devices in the chamber at once so pumpdown 
does not need to be repeated.) After a soak at vacuum, the power should be 
applied in approximately 10 incremental steps of at least 5 min each until 
breakdown is observed on all detection methods. 
6.	 This step varies depending on test type. For a multipactor test, after the 
required vacuum soak, power may be applied to the DUT in incremental 
steps until full power is reached. For a corona test, power should be ap­
plied at ambient pressure and remain on through pumpdown.
7.	 After the required dwells and thermal cycling (if applicable), power should 
be applied to the initiator device again until breakdown is observed to 
prove that nothing changed in the test setup.

8.	 The final step in any test is to collect data items that are sufficient to prove 
to a third party that a device has successfully passed. 
For either type of high-power test, several data items are required:
••
First, there should be a continuous strip chart of all detection methods, 
power meters, and thermocouples with high enough sampling rates to ensure 
that all possible events were captured. 
••
Next, there should be evidence from the detection methods showing the 
breakdown of the multipactor initiator device. On a forward/reflected null, 
for example, there would be an image from the spectrum analyzer screen 
depicting the event. 
••
There should also be evidence that temperatures and pressures were within 
specification limits during the test and that all dwell times were met. 
••
If any events were recorded on the DUT, there should be images of the events 
on the detection methods and detailed descriptions of the test conditions 
during the event(s). 
This is the general outline of the steps required for high-power testing. Re­
quired data collection is discussed next.
7.8.3.2  Strip Chart or Data Acquisition Annotation 
The following items must be continuously recorded on the strip chart or within the 
data acquisition software. The channels with low data rate must update by at least 
one sample per second and detection method channels typically require a 1-kHz 
sampling rate or faster. It is usually difficult for an outsider to review test data from 
a high-power test, especially when a phase bridge is used, so data should be as well 
annotated as possible.

7C.1  Example Test Procedure
PIM Test Setup and Calibration Procedure:
1.	 Set up equipment as shown in Figure 7C.1 and photograph the installed 
DUT. 
2.	 Plug in and warm up spectrum analyzers and signal generators for a mini­
mum of 1 h before starting test.
3.	 Set signal generators to Tx f1 = 3.7 GHz, Tx f2 = 4.2 GHz (or other fre­
quencies in between to produce a ninth-order Rx-band PIM).
4.	 Set power meter offset equal to measured coupling value of coupler plus 
WR229 waveguide loss from coupler to DUT to be able to read the abso­
lute power level at DUT.
5.	 Set spectrum analyzer 1 to Rx = f3 to 6.2 GHz (or equivalent ninth-order 
PIM). 
Figure 7C.1  Carrier frequencies may be adjusted between 3.7 and 4.2 GHz provided the ninth-
order PIM product falls within 5.925 to 6.425 MHz.

6.	 Set spectrum analyzer scale to 10 dB/division, reference level to –70 dBm, 
and attenuation to 0 dB. 
7.	 Inject -70-dBm signal at Rx f3 PIM frequency into WR137 interface at 
DUT and set spectrum analyzer reference offset such that spectrum ana­
lyzer reads -70 dBm.
8.	 Center the frequency at 10-Hz IF resolution bandwidth, set frequency span 
to 0 Hz, then step the injected Rx signal (of step 7) down in 10-dB incre­
ments and record the resulting stair-step on the strip chart or data collec­
tion system (data recorder).
9.	 Set data recorder “amplitude and position offset” to read the same scale as 
the recorded instrument displays and to continuously monitor (or sample a 
minimum of 1 point/second) the spectrum analyzer output, system power, 
and the chamber temperature. Set chart speed to 1 mm/min for the test and 
10 mm/min when performing PIM source check and frequency centering.
10.	Ensure a system receiver noise floor of -150 dBm or lower (average 
reading).
11.	Support the first DUT in the thermal chamber with Kapton-covered foam 
blocks and place approximately 12 to 18 in. from the absorber panel, ver­
ify absorber power handling (expect 2 W/in.2;  absorber power handling is 
5 W/in.2), and connect as shown.
12.	Attach thermal couples to DUT at points 1–2 in Figure 7C.2.
13.	Install radiated PIM source in an established repeatable location (ambient 
only).
14.	Power up DUT with 2 × 50W and turn on the data recorder.
15.	Set the frequency span to 100 Hz (or wider if necessary) and find the 
fourth-order PIM with spectrum analyzer.
16.	Center the PIM on the spectrum analyzer using an IF bandwidth of 10 Hz 
and set frequency span to 0 Hz as in Figure 7C.3 then momentarily vary Tx 
power by 3 dB to ensure that the PIM source is not saturated (for power-
sensitive hardware, reduce power by -3 dB). Relocate source if necessary.
17.	Remove the PIM source and verify that the residual PIM level is below the 
“PIM product detection level” of <–145 dBm.
18.	If necessary, remove or correct any sources of PIM found in the chamber or 
test equipment.
19.	Conduct a single thermal cycle PIM test with the profile indicated in Table 
7C.1 and record the results in Table 7C.2. Do not exceed 9°C/min ramp 
rate and dwell for 1 h at hot and cold each. Notice the indicated tolerance

a frequency check of the spectrum analyzer at both dwell points. (Can be 
done using an external mixer as a PIM source at power monitoring cou­
pler.) Record all of the data on the data recorder as shown in Figure 7C.3.

8.1  Introduction
All but the smallest reflectors used on today’s spacecraft are deployable in some 
sense. The great majority of those are substantially rigid structures that deploy by 
hinging about an axis using a motorized or spring-activated mechanism. The size 
of those reflectors is limited by the size of the booster fairings on which they are 
carried into space. Larger reflectors that exceed the size of the fairings need to be 
“folded up” for launch in some way, and “unfurled” to their full size on orbit. It is 
those foldable and unfurlable reflectors, simply referred to as “deployable” reflec­
tors, which are the subject of this chapter.
After this introduction, the remainder of the chapter deals with three main 
subjects. Section 8.2 deals with reflector classifications. Sections 8.3 through 8.7 
describe the various reflector types and styles, and Section 8.8 covers the most 
important subsystem design considerations/requirements for deployable reflectors.
Reflector classifications are done from two points of view. The first classifica­
tion is according to the surface geometry such as parabolic vs. shaped, circular vs. 
elliptical, and center-fed vs. offset-fed reflectors. The second classification is ac­
cording to the reflector surface type and includes rigid/segmented, semirigid, inflat­
able/rigidizable, woven-mesh, and knitted-mesh types. Because the knitted-mesh 
type reflector is the most common and most flown of all deployable reflectors, its 
major constituents are further discussed in Sections 8.7.1 through 8.7.4, which 
cover the mesh itself, the net/soft structure, the deploying structure, and the mesh/
soft structure management provisions. Seven different styles of deploying structures 
used with knitted-mesh reflectors are discussed in Sections 8.7.3.1 through 8.7.3.7. 
The subject of subsystem design considerations/requirements for deployable re­
flectors is discussed in Section 8.8. It includes discussions of electrical, mechanical, 
thermal, and environmental design drivers. The electrical requirements discussion 

342 
���������������������
Deployable Reflectors
covers the various factors that contribute to gain-loss, as well as a brief discussion 
of other common requirements including side/grating lobe limits, passive inter­
modulations, and electrostatic discharge. The mechanical requirements discussion 
covers mass, frequency, and pointing requirements. Finally, a brief discussion of the 
thermal analysis and design aspects, as well as environmental design drivers such as 
radiation and solar transparency, is presented. 
Reflector categories that, for various reasons, are not covered in this chapter 
are as follows:
1.	 Space assembled/erected reflectors: These were studied extensively in the 
early shuttle era. They are assembled/erected in low Earth orbit by astro­
nauts from numerous subassemblies carried to orbit aboard one or more 
shuttle missions to form extremely large reflectors. They were believed to 
have the potential for producing extremely high surface accuracy for their 
size. To the author’s knowledge, this style of reflector is no longer being 
pursued. 
2.	 One-dimensional deployable reflectors: The ISAT radar reflectarray is one 
example. It utilizes a parabolic cylinder shaped reflector 300m in length 
and only a few meters wide; therefore, it only needs to deploy in one di­
mension. Several designs were being pursued by competing government 
contractors when the effort was terminated in the mid-2000s.
3.	 Shape-memory reflectors: These utilize phase-change materials that assume 
different shapes when heated (or cooled) beyond a certain phase-change 
temperature. Two different categories of these reflectors have been con­
sidered. In the first category, those materials are used in conjunction with 
inflatable reflector technology, which is further discussed in Section 8.5. 
In the second category, those materials are used to form the reflector sur­
face itself in a manner analogous to the segmented and semirigid surface 
reflectors discussed in Sections 8.3 and 8.4, respectively, but will not be 
discussed here any further, since that technology is considered to be still in 
its early stages of development.
8.2  Reflector Classifications
To keep track of the large variety of reflectors that have been conceived, they may 
be classified in accordance with two main aspects. Specifically, they may be classi­
fied according to their surface geometry or according to their surface type. 
8.2.1  Classifications According to Reflector Surface Geometry
Regardless of whether a reflector is fixed or deployable, its ideal surface geometry 
in its simplest shape is formed by intersecting a parent surface of revolution, usu­
ally paraboloidal, with a cylindrical “cookie cutter,” the axis of which is parallel to 
the axis of the surface of revolution. In this classification, the type of the reflector 
depends on three aspects: the shape of the parent surface, the shape of the “cookie 
cutter,” and the location of the surface axis versus the “cookie cutter” axis, as dis­
cussed next.

8.2  Reflector Classifications 
343
Shape of the Parent Surface
Parabolic: This type uses a paraboloidal surface of revolution. This shape com­
prises the vast majority of deployable reflectors (as defined herein) that have 
been flown.
Mildly shaped: This type may utilize a nonparabolic surface of revolution, or 
a paraboloidal surface wherein the focal length of the constituting parabola 
varies gradually as it rotates about its axis of revolution. In all cases, the mildly 
shaped surface always curves in the same direction: toward the reflector focus. 
Arbitrarily shaped: In this type of reflector, the surface, which typically starts 
with a mildly shaped surface, is further perturbed by the addition of a series 
of higher order surface functions. The magnitudes of these surface functions 
are typically optimized through the use of sophisticated numerical techniques 
aimed at optimizing certain antenna performance parameters via reflector sur­
face shaping. Usually, this results in forming certain “bumps” over the surface 
of the reflector, which may cause the surface to locally curve in a direction 
opposite to the general direction of the reflector surface curvature (i.e., have 
regions of negative curvature). 
Shape of the Cylindrical “Cookie Cutter”
Circular: This shape is the most common, and obviously produces a circular 
reflector (when viewed along the reflector boresight). It typically produces a 
“pencil beam” with a circular main lobe in the far field when illuminated with 
a single feed located at or near the focal point. The size of that pencil beam, in 
degrees, is inversely proportional to the reflector diameter for a given RF wave­
length. Alternatively, when illuminated with a number of independent feeds 
located near the focal point, it can produce what is known as a multibeam 
antenna. 
Elliptical: As expected, using an elliptical cylinder for the “cookie cutter” pro­
duces an elliptical reflector. Also as expected, an elliptical reflector produces an 
elliptical or “fan” beam in its far field. The orientation of the major diameter of 
that beam, however, corresponds to the direction of the minor diameter of the 
reflector surface. This becomes obvious when you consider the inverse propor­
tionality relationship between the beam size and the reflector diameter stated 
above.
Arbitrarily shaped perimeter: While not ideal, the desire to maximize the area 
of a reflector that can fit within the available booster fairing occasionally leads 
to the design of somewhat oddly-shaped reflectors. This is more common with 
fixed (i.e., nondeployable) reflectors. Also, with deployable mesh reflectors, the 
outer perimeter of the reflector often “recedes” inward between the mesh at­
tachment points along the perimeter, resulting in a shape that more closely ap­
proximates a multifaceted polygon. 

344 
���������������������
Deployable Reflectors
The use of noncircular and nonelliptical shaped reflectors has two drawbacks. 
First, since it is difficult to design a simple feed that can efficiently “illuminate” 
an arbitrarily shaped perimeter reflector, such a reflector will typically suffer from 
increased spillover losses or a high cost. Second, the corresponding nonuniform il­
lumination of the reflector edges and the increased spillover energy manifest them­
selves in the form of higher level sidelobes, which are oftentimes detrimental to the 
system-level performance. 
Location of the Surface Axis vs. the “Cookie Cutter” Axis
Center-fed reflector: This type of reflector corresponds to a reflector in which 
the two axes coincide. As a result, the feed (which must be located on, or near, 
the axis of the reflector surface) is also located near the center of the “cookie 
cutter,” which defines the outer perimeter of the reflector. Hence, the reflector 
is “center fed.”
Offset-fed reflector: Here, the two axes are parallel but offset relative to each 
other. In most practical applications, the axis of the reflector surface is located 
entirely outside of the “cookie cutter.”
The obvious advantage of the offset-fed design is that the feed (which is located 
on, or near, the axis of the reflector surface) does not substantially block the path 
of the energy reflected off of the surface of the reflector, if at all. For this reason 
and because offset-fed reflector designs enhance the architectures of the spacecraft, 
they are prevalent. On the other hand, with a center-fed reflector, the feed—and 
often its support structure and feed waveguide—blocks and scatters some of the 
reflected energy, resulting in a loss of efficiency and the generation of sidelobes. 
Since the center of the reflector is where the energy density is highest, the effect of 
the center feed blockage and scattering on the reflector efficiency is amplified. Ad­
ditionally, the energy blocked by the feed (and its support) is scattered away from 
the main antenna lobe and ends up adding to the energy in some of the sidelobes, 
which can be detrimental to system performance in certain applications. Nonethe­
less, there are important reasons for implementing large center-fed apertures for 
some applications. 
8.2.2  Classification According to Reflector Surface Type
From the point of view of the type of surface used to construct a reflector, the vari­
ous reflectors known to the authors may be classified into the following types: 
1.	 Rigid surface—one piece: This is the basic type of surface used on fixed 
(nondeployable) reflectors. Because this chapter is concerned only with the 
deployable reflectors, this type is not discussed further.
2	
Rigid surface—segmented: In this reflector type, the surface is divided into 
a collection of rigid segments connected with hinges and/or linkages. Pairs 
of three-segment 5m reflectors of this type were flown on several XM-
Radio satellites, and at least one two-segment folding aperture was flown 
on a European satellite. This type is further discussed in Section 8.3.

8.3  Segmented Reflectors 
345
3.	 Semirigid surface: This type is also known as the spring-back antenna. Two 
pairs of this type were flown on the Mobilesat spacecrafts, and several sets 
of three reflectors were flown on the TDRS-II satellites. Spring-back reflec­
tors are further discussed in Section 8.4.
4.	 Inflatable/rigidizable surface: This type comprises a lenticular structure 
with an RF transparent front surface and a metalized back/reflecting sur­
face. The surfaces may be rigidized in space using various technologies, 
or kept under constant, but very low, pressure for the life of the reflector 
mission. An Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) was flown on the space 
shuttle, which provided a significant learning experience. This technology 
is further discussed in Section 8.5.
5.	 Woven-mesh surface—wrap-rib reflector: A woven-mesh surface has near-
zero shear stiffness and is therefore suitable for use on the wrap-rib reflec­
tor built by Lockheed Martin. A 9.5m version was flown on the ATS-6 
satellite in 1974. More discussion is given in Section 8.6. 
6.	 Knitted-mesh surface: A knitted mesh has the advantage of providing ex­
tremely low extensional stiffness, excellent RF properties, and very low 
weight. It is suitable for use at frequencies no higher than about 50 GHz 
to avoid substantial reflection losses. Over half a dozen different styles of 
deployable reflectors utilizing this type of reflecting surface have been built 
and most of them successfully flown. They total well over 40 units on-orbit 
at the time of writing this chapter and thus represent the majority of the de­
ployable reflectors that have been placed on orbit. Therefore, much of the 
discussion in the remainder of this chapter pertains to this type of reflector 
and its various styles. 
8.3  Segmented Reflectors
As the name implies, in this type of reflector, the surface is divided into a number of 
substantially rigid segments. These segments are interconnected with hinges and/or 
linkages of various designs. The objective is to permit the stowage of one or more 
reflectors, each having a diameter larger than that of the launch vehicle fairing, to 
be carried to orbit within the available volume inside that fairing. Typically, the 
larger the number of segments into which a reflector is divided, the smaller the vol­
ume in which it can be stowed; or conversely, the larger the diameter of the reflector 
that can be stowed within a given volume. This can be described as having higher 
stowage efficiency. On the other hand, the larger the number of segments utilized, 
the larger the number of interconnecting hinges/linkages needed, which results in 
increased complexity, cost, mass, and RF loss. The increased RF loss is due to the 
increased length of the intersegment boundary seams and the increased cumulative 
misalignment error through the increased number of interconnecting features. It is 
because of this increase in complexity and RF loss that some authors estimated that 
this type of reflector is practically limited to 10m in diameter [1].
The use of this type of reflector is motivated by two main advantages:
1.	 The increased surface accuracy (at least within each individual segment) 
makes it suitable for use at higher frequencies (such as 40 GHz or higher).

346 
���������������������
Deployable Reflectors
2.	 It is suitable for producing arbitrarily shaped surface reflectors, wherein 
regions of reversed curvature may exist. 
The oldest of these reflectors is the Sunflower, which was developed by TRW 
in the early 1980s, when they built a 4.9m engineering model [2, 3]. The reflector 
may employ one or two rings of segments as shown in Figures 8.1 and 8.2 [3]. Two 
other designs, known as DAISY and MEA, were developed by the European Space 
Agency (ESA) and Dornier, for which they built engineering models. 
A fourth model named the Solid Surface Deployable Antenna (SSDA) was de­
veloped by DSL, of which they built a 1.5m demonstration model (Figure 8.3) [3]. 
Unfortunately, all of these models provide relatively poor stowage efficiency and 
use large numbers of segments (approximately 20 to 50 segments).

347
In the late 1990s, a new concept was patented by Hughes (now Boeing), in 
which linkages, rather than simple hinges, were used to connect adjacent segments, 
allowing them to stow back-to-front, instead of front-to-front, thus substantially 
matching each other’s curvature and stow more compactly (Figure 8.4) [4]. Several 
concepts having from 2 to 10 segments were presented and shown to stow com­
pactly. The company produced a number of 3-segment 5m reflectors.
A pair of those reflectors were stowed on the sides of their standard HS702 
spacecraft and flown in the early 2000s in a standard 3.7m-diameter booster fair­
ing. Those reflectors were used on the XM-Radio satellites, and are arbitrarily 
shaped, which made them more difficult to nest together than their paraboloidal 
counterparts. The fact that those reflectors were arbitrarily shaped was the reason 
why segmented, rather than the more common mesh, reflectors were used, since at 
that time, arbitrarily shaped mesh reflectors had not yet been developed. To date, 
those XM-Radio reflectors remain the only shaped segmented reflectors that have 
ever been flown.  
8.4  Semirigid Surface Reflectors: Spring-Back Antennas
The spring-back antenna (SBA) concept was developed by Hughes (now Boeing) in 
the mid-1990s, and flown for the first time on Mobilesat-1 in 1996. Figure 8.5 [5] 
shows that spacecraft with two SBAs on it, one stowed and the other deployed. This 
novel reflector design is made of a thin graphite shell reinforced with flat strips and 
an outer hoop integrated into a single bonded, semiflexible assembly. That shell is 
elastically folded (like a taco) to form about a 300-deg arc. It is kept in this gently

stowed configuration by tie cables connected to the outer hoop and to a damped 
release mechanism designed to absorb some of the deployment energy. A pair of 
such reflectors, each 5.25m × 6.8m in diameter, is nested together in their stowed 
configuration to form a nearly 5.3m-high, truncated cone. The reflectors are tied to 
each other and to external supports at several locations using launch locks in order 
to provide adequate strength and stiffness during launch. 
Although the stowage efficiency for SBAs is low, the fact that the stowed reflec­
tor is substantially hollow, makes it possible, and even advantageous, to stow two 
(or three) reflectors nested together in the same space—significantly increasing that 
efficiency. Additionally, the fact that the SBA design is extremely simple drastically 
cuts down its development cycle in comparison with any other deployable reflector. 
In fact, this enabled the incorporation of the SBAs on the Mobilesat spacecraft in 
an extremely short 9-month period from conception to launch. 
A more recent application for SBAs has been on the NASA TDRS second- and 
third-generation spacecraft, where 4.6m-diameter SBAs are used in frequencies as 
high as the Ku-band. 
8.5  Inflatable/Rigidizable Reflectors
Much like a Mylar birthday balloon, an inflatable reflector is constructed out of 
two plastic membranes circumferentially seamed together to form a lenticular struc­
ture. The front membrane is kept as an RF transparent sheet, while the back one is 
metalized to form an RF reflective surface. In addition to completing the balloon, 
the front surface serves as a canopy, which helps athermalize the reflecting surface.
The reflector takes its shape on orbit by being inflated by a very low-pressure 
inert gas (on the order of 2 to 3 Pa). The pressure is kept particularly low for two 
reasons: first, to minimize the membrane stress (which is proportional to the pres­
sure times the reflector radius, divided by the membrane thickness), and second, 
to minimize the mass of the gas needed to inflate the reflector and to maintain the 
pressure for the duration of the mission. The problem of determining the mass of 
the maintenance gas needed is nontrivial. At the beginning of life, the leakage rate 
depends primarily on the permeability of the membrane material (including any 
material defects). As time goes on, however, one has to account for the probability 
that some holes/tears may develop due to micrometeoroids or space debris. The 
size and number of such holes can only be determined statistically, and will obvi­
ously increase with the length of the mission life.
The first inflatable reflectors were developed in the United States by L’Garde, 
under Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) leadership and funding. With the very low 
stiffness and pressures involved, ground testing had limitations and did not suf­
ficiently reduce the development risk for the technology. JPL/NASA therefore ini­
tiated the Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE), together with L’Garde. The ex­
periment involved a 14m reflector made out of 0.25-mil-thick Mylar membranes 
(Figure 8.6) [6]. The reflector was reinforced with an outer toroidal ring and sup­
ported by three long struts, all of which were made of 12-mil-thick Kevlar compos­
ite and pressurized to much higher pressures. The entire structure, together with the 
inflating equipment and pressurant, was packaged in a rectangular box about 1 m3 
in volume. The experiment was flown on the space shuttle and deployed in orbit, 

350 
���������������������
Deployable Reflectors
in 1996. Although the results of the experiment may not have been flawless, the 
experiment provided invaluable lessons learned, and remains the first and only on-
orbit demonstration of the potential capabilities of inflatable precision structures. 
Near the turn of the century, JPL was developing the Advanced Radio Interfer­
ometry between Space and Earth (ARISE) mission, which involved a 25m precision 
deployable reflector. An inflatable reflector, as one of the two options funded by 
JPL, was being developed by L’Garde. Although significant progress was made by 
both organizations, the ARISE mission is, unfortunately, no longer being pursued 
(most likely due to NASA funding cuts). 
A rigidizable reflector structure is a subclass of the inflatable technology. It 
overcomes the issue of replenishing the pressurant, especially for longer missions, 
by using a material that turns rigid after being inflated on orbit. This is particu­
larly advantageous for the secondary reflector structures, such as the support struts 
and the toroidal reinforcing ring, which require higher pressures to maintain their 
rigidity. Several technologies have been considered/pursued for achieving on-orbit 
rigidization [7] including the following:
••
Fiber-reinforced space-curable epoxy composite materials: These materials 
cure in about 6 h at 110°C, which is easily achievable in direct sunlight on 
orbit.

••
Fiber-reinforced subglass transition temperature (sub-Tg) elastomeric mate­
rials: Some of these are also known as “shape memory” composites. These 
materials become rigid at very low (sub-Tg) on-orbit temperatures, but are 
soft at warmer temperatures above their Tg.
••
Fiber-reinforced ultraviolet (UV) curable resins: These materials slowly cure 
on orbit as they are exposed to the sun’s UV rays. 
••
Polymers laminated with annealed aluminum foil: These materials can be 
folded during stowage/launch, and then inflated on orbit to stresses beyond 
the yield stress of the aluminum foil. When the pressure is removed, the 
prestretched foil retains much of the laminated material’s shape and rigidity. 
In addition to the JPL/L’Garde work on the IAE and ARISE inflatable reflec­
tors, ESA and Contraves (a European company) have developed the Inflatable 
Space Rigidizable Structure (ISRS) reflector for a joint ESA/NASA program (Figure 
8.7) [6]. The reflector membranes were made of Kevlar impregnated with space-
curable epoxy of the type described earlier. Although the Mylar membranes used 
in the L’Garde reflectors are much lighter and thinner than those used on ISRS, 
the effect on the overall mass of the reflectors is small since the mass of the Mylar 
membranes represents only about 10% of the overall system mass. In return, the 
thicker Kevlar membranes provide much higher structural stiffness and strength, 
and free the reflector from the limited life constraint/risk due to the limited amount 
of make-up pressurant available, providing instead a nearly infinite reflector life. 
Kevlar also has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) than Mylar, thus 
resulting in potentially lower on-orbit thermal distortion errors. 
In summary, the main potential advantages of the inflatable/rigidizable tech­
nology are simplicity, high deployment reliability, high stowage efficiency, low ar­
eal mass, and low reflection loss at high frequencies. The disadvantages are the 
difficulty of deployment testing and obtaining high shape accuracy on the ground 
due to limited adjustability and limitations on accurate 1G simulation.

8.6  Woven-Mesh Surface: The Wrap-Rib Reflector
The wrap-rib reflector was developed by Lockheed in the 1970s under a JPL con­
tract. It consists of a central hub to which a number of radial ribs (typically one to 
four dozen) are attached via nearly vertical hinges. The ribs, which are shaped along 
the parabolic reflector surface, have either a slightly curved cross section (similar to 
a large carpenter tape) or a lenticular cross section (representing two face-to-face 
carpenter tapes). They are fabricated out of either metallic (aluminum or titanium) 
or composite GFRP materials. In addition to providing a place for supporting the 
reflector rib attachment hinge, the hub’s upper and lower surfaces are extended 
radially outward in order to provide a toroidal-shaped compartment, which starts 
slightly inboard of the rib hinge locations and extends a sufficient distance out­
board of those hinges to provide enough room to stow the ribs (and the mesh) as 
they are “wrapped” around the hub (hence the name “wrap-rib”). Figure 8.8 is a 
sketch of the hub design (after [8]). 
To wrap the ribs, they are first rotated approximately 90 deg about their hinges 
until they become substantially tangential to the hub. The cross section of each rib 
is then flattened periodically along its length in order to permit it to wrap around 
the hub in a spiral fashion (like a clock spring). The reflective mesh attaches to the 
top edges of the ribs, and is fanfolded between the ribs and stowed with them as 
they are wrapped around the hub. To retain the stowed ribs and mesh in place, 
the outer edge of the extended lower surface of the hub is fitted with a set of 
spring-loaded doors, which run circumferentially around the hub. These doors are 
closed upward to a vertical position, and kept in place with a cable, which wraps 
around the hub like a bellyband. The cable is then pyrotechnically released to effect

deployment. The rotation of the hub during deployment may or may not be me­
chanically damped; if not, the deployment may be quite energetic due to the release 
of stored energy.
The reflective mesh of the wrap-rib reflector is usually made out of trapezoidal-
shaped gores, which are seamed together proximate the ribs. Each gore forms a 
facet, whose shape approximates a parabola of revolution but is in fact closer to a 
segment of a parabolic cylinder. The curved facets are bounded by two parabolic 
ribs, an outer catenary member, and a part of the circumference of the central hub. 
Since the ribs rotate about 90 deg as they are stowed, the inner edges of the mesh 
gores have to undergo extremely high shear strains in the process. A mesh made of 
an open plain weave is therefore necessary in order to be able to withstand such 
large strains without excessive shear stresses. Such a woven mesh also possesses a 
very low Poisson’s ratio, which is important to minimize “pillowing” distortion. 
Pillowing is a type of distortion in which the surface moves toward the center-of-
curvature as it is tensioned in the radial direction. 
A 9.5m wrap-rib reflector was built by Lockheed for the Application Technol­
ogy Satellite in the 1960s (Figure 8.9) [6, 9]. The reflector had 48 aluminum ribs. 
Lockheed also built a sector of a 55m-diameter reflector having GFRP ribs with 
lenticular cross sections [6]. This type of closed cross section provides for a signifi­
cant increase in both the torsional and lateral weak-plane stiffness of the ribs, and 
thus greatly improves their torsional-buckling capability. 
The wrap-rib reflector is particularly suited for a center-fed antenna. In such 
a case, the large number of contoured ribs typically needed become identical in 
shape. Also, the on-orbit mechanical and thermal loads become primarily axial 
and radial (due to symmetry), which the ribs are best suited to handle. Finally, this 
symmetry permits the reflector to be designed with a free-wheeling hub, which

greatly reduces the loads at the end of deployment. On the other hand, an offset-fed 
antenna reflector loses all of the above advantages, becoming difficult and costly to 
successfully design and build. 
8.7  Knitted-Mesh Surface Reflectors
Knitted-mesh surface reflectors are the most popular and prevalent among deploy­
able reflectors that have flown in space. There are at least half a dozen different 
styles of reflectors, some with different substyles, that fall in this category. Most 
of them have been successfully used on orbit. The mesh itself is particularly suited 
for large deployable reflectors due to its extremely high flexibility, low mass, and 
excellent RF performance.
Certain basic components/systems make up a reflector of this type: the mesh, 
the shaping net/soft structure, the deploying structure, and the mesh/net manage­
ment system. In the following subsections, each of these components/systems is 
discussed, as well as some of their variations as they pertain to the most common 
styles that have been developed. 
8.7.1  The Knitted Mesh
This mesh is typically produced using a two-bar tricot machine, which was per­
fected for textile manufacture during the 19th century. Its density is measured by 
the number of openings per inch (OPI), with the typical range being 5 to 30 OPI, 
and the most common being 10 OPI (Figure 8.10). Practically all of the knitted 
reflector meshes that have been flown use gold-plated molybdenum wires with a 
diameter of about 1 mil. Molybdenum has an extremely high modulus of elasticity 
and strength that, with the resulting bending stiffness of the wire loops, provides 
the knitted structure with a high strain capability and relatively stable orbital ten­
sion levels. The importance of this fact to the success of these reflectors cannot be 
overstated. The CTE of molybdenum is fairly low, but there is a common miscon­
ception that an even lower CTE is important to control deformations and/or loads 
in view of the extreme on-orbit thermal behavior of the mesh, where the gold may 
cause temperatures to range from -180° to 300°C. However, because the mesh is 
a soft spring that is strained possibly up to 10% in its deployed configuration, the 
addition of another 0.25% of strain at the temperature extremes does little to affect 
the mesh tension—it simply sits there. Also, its thermal mass is too low for the mesh 
temperature extremes to adversely affect any adjacent structure.
The gold plating provides the benefits of excellent corrosion resistance, low 
contact resistance, and high electrical conductivity. Gold also facilitates the knit­
ting process. Without gold plating, the lubricity of the wire would be too low to 
knit because the molybdenum base metal is highly abrasive. This mesh has several 
characteristics that make it particularly suited for use on deployable reflectors:
1.	 It has extremely low extensional stiffness as knitted and a high strain ca­
pability. As a result, it can be sufficiently prestretched so that it does not 
go slack on orbit without overtaxing the deployment structure that has to 

8.7  Knitted-Mesh Surface Reflectors 
355
react to those preloads. Also, it does not kink or permanently wrinkle after 
being stowed for a long period of time. 
2.	 It has excellent RF properties. Specifically, it has low reflectivity loss (up 
to 50 GHz, provided a sufficiently dense knit pattern is used) [10] and a 
high passive intermodulation (PIM) threshold (provided it is kept clean of 
conductive debris). 
3.	 It has very low areal mass, 0.025 kg/m2 is typical, which makes it suitable 
for large reflectors.
Because of the small diameter of the wire, as well as the excellent electrical 
conductivity and softness of the gold plating, the mesh exhibits very low wire-to-
wire contact resistance, even after losing much of its preload at the high on-orbit 
temperature environment. This is essential for maintaining good RF performance. 
Another knitted mesh was developed by Hughes in the mid-1990s, and was 
knitted out of a specially formulated “Aracon” thread, which is a DuPont material 
made up of nickel-plated Kevlar yarn. This net has excellent PIM characteristics 
and a low CTE, at the expense of somewhat higher mass and reflectivity loss. This 
makes it particularly suited for severe PIM environments, especially if excellent 
cleanliness cannot be guaranteed. Unfortunately the low bending stiffness of the 
Aracon fibers resulted in a mesh with nonlinear stiffness characteristics and a nar­
row band of deflection between the slack and fully taut states. This makes it more 
difficult to produce a consistently tensioned mesh in the deployed reflector.
One of the characteristics of the knitted mesh is that it has extremely low uni­
axial stiffness, but a high Poisson’s ratio (ν), which has a geometric average in the x

and y directions of near unity. As a result, the mesh biaxial stiffness, which has the 
quantity (1 – νx ⋅νy) in its denominator, is more than an order of magnitude higher 
than its uniaxial stiffness. This is important for the tensioning process during re­
flector fabrication since it becomes very easy to biaxially overtension the mesh, 
and because the thermal expansion of the mesh typically results in biaxial loading. 
8.7.2  The Shaping Net/Soft Structure
Because of the very low stiffness and high Poisson’s ratio of the mesh, attempting to 
force it into a paraboloidal shape by controlling it only at a reasonably small num­
ber of points, say a few hundred, will result in a high pillowing error. Pillowing re­
fers to the tendency of the mesh surface to move toward the reflector focus (or more 
precisely its center of curvature) in an attempt to relieve its pre-strain. An effective 
way to minimize mesh pillowing is to subdivide it into a collection of nearly flat 
“facets” that approximate the reflector’s paraboloidal surface shape. The surface of 
the mesh within a facet stays flat if its edges are kept substantially flat and coplanar. 
The above can be achieved by introducing a “net” made of cords (or straps), 
the openings of which will define the edges of the facet, and its vertices will be 
controlled to fall on the theoretical paraboloidal surface. This can be accomplished 
by tying those vertices directly to a hard structure, by pulling them toward that 
hard structure, or by pulling them toward another “net” or a set of cords located 
behind the net controlling the mesh. This “pulling” is achieved by a set of cords 
usually running substantially perpendicular to the reflector surface, which are of­
ten referred to as “drop ties” and may be adjustable and/or spring loaded. In some 
reflector styles, especially the older ones, additional drop ties are incorporated be­
tween the net vertices. Doing so, however, results in nonflat facets and may be 
less effective in controlling the mesh pillowing. In order for the mesh surface to be 
controlled by the net, it is either placed behind it (i.e., on its anti-focus side), where 
its pillowing tendency makes it naturally push against the net, or it is sewn to the 
net continuously or at very close intervals. 
Typically, the front net divides the reflector surface into either triangular or 
quadrilateral facets depending on the style of the reflector. The quadrilateral facets 
are typically trapezoidal, or square/rectangular in shape [Figures 8.11(a) and (b)] 
[6, 11]. Triangular nets provide the reflector with in-plane shear stiffness, which 
is something that the AstroMesh Perimeter Truss reflectors greatly benefit from 
[Figure 8.11(c)] [12]. Actually, the AstroMesh reflector uses fairly stiff Kevlar or 
GFRP straps to form a net that operates on an “inextensible tensioned membrane” 
theory where soft tension ties preload the pseudo-geodesic net structure in the nor­
mal direction. 
Quadrilateral nets, on the other hand, are used for the great majority of re­
flectors. Umbrella-style reflectors, which are the oldest and most manufactured/
flown style, typically use trapezoidal nets, which are particularly compatible with 
the use of “gored” meshes. They are made up of elongated nearly triangular (or 
trapezoidal) segments referred to as gores, which correspond to the space between 
two contiguous reflector ribs. The net divides each gore into trapezoidal facets that 
increase in width as they get further away from the center. In the TRW and Har­
ris umbrella-style reflectors, the facets incorporate additional intermediate drop 
ties in between the vertices on the wider sides, which extend in the circumferential 

8.7  Knitted-Mesh Surface Reflectors 
357
directions [review Figure 8.11(b)]. Because the facet vertices are located directly 
above the ribs, they may, in many situations, tie directly to the ribs through short, 
adjustable links. The intermediate drop ties, however, often need to react their 
loads against another set of cords located behind the main net, forming what may 
be either an “aft” net or a set of circumferential polygons configured much like 
spider webs. The collection of cords forming the main net, the drop ties, and the aft 
nets or circumferential cords, are often referred to as the “soft structure.” 
Some of the more recently developed reflectors, however, use square (or rect­
angular) net arrangements. These provide more uniform distribution of vertices 
over the surface of the reflector and are easier to fabricate and pretension. This is 
because they can be fabricated out of fewer, long pieces of cord, which extend from 
one edge of the reflector to its opposite edge, each of which can be preconditioned 
and pretensioned as a whole. On the other hand, the trapezoidal, spider web–type

nets require many more cord segments, especially in the circumferential direction, 
which need to be fabricated, preconditioned, and pretensioned independently. 
A phenomenon associated with the uniform square reflector facets, as well as 
the triangular facets (such as those used on the AstroMesh reflector), is that they 
produce significant “grating lobes.” These are large, pencil-shaped, sidelobes that 
form at certain locations surrounding the main reflector’s RF lobe, and have long 
been recognized for phased arrays with uniformly spaced radiating elements. The 
phenomenon has been described by Thomson [13] for the AstroMesh triangular 
net, and in the specifications of a Boeing patent [14] for the square net. Because this 
can be detrimental to some system designs, that same patent describes solutions 
that can easily be implemented in the net design. For example, Figure 8.12 shows 
that using nonuniform rectangular net openings can significantly reduce the levels 
of the grating lobes. Those net openings would be made smaller near the reflector 
center, and grow gradually toward the edges. This also provides additional perfor­
mance advantages for two reasons:

1.	 The feed illumination is highest at the center of the reflector; therefore, 
smaller facets, with associated smaller deviations from the theoretical sur­
face, are more important near the reflector center. 
2.	 The curvature of a paraboloidal reflector surface is highest at its center; 
thus, smaller facets are needed to reduce surface deviations near the center 
than those needed near the outer edges of the reflector. 
Due to the curvature of the reflector surface, there are finite angles between the 
adjacent mesh facets. As a result, the preload in the mesh translates into loading 
along the net cords in a direction normal to the surface, causing them to tend to 
pillow. To minimize the “net” pillowing (which translates into corresponding mesh 
pillowing), the net cords are usually preloaded to significantly higher loads than the 
mesh itself. Because the stiffness of the net cords is often in the same order as (or 
even higher in certain directions than) that of the deploying structure itself, a signif­
icant reduction in the net load can affect the accuracy of the final reflector surface 
shape. This can occur due to repeated deployments on the ground, or to thermal 
cycling and long-term creep on orbit. Therefore, some deployable reflector designs 
introduce sources of flexibility, often in the form of nonmetallic spring elements, at 
some interfaces between the front/back nets or cords and the deploying structure. 
Because the shape of the net has a direct impact on the accuracy of the reflector 
surface, careful consideration must be given to its configuration and the materials 
used in making it. As will be discussed in more detail in Section 8.8, the size of the 
net openings controls the “faceting loss,” whereas the accuracy by which the net 
vertices is located controls the “random surface loss.” Therefore, while increasing 
the number of facets can reduce the faceting loss, because the mesh can be made to 
more closely “hug” the theoretical surface, it unfortunately increases the random 
surface loss. This is due to the corresponding significant increase in the number of 
vertices, which makes it harder to place all of them at their precise theoretical loca­
tions within a reasonable number of surface adjustment iteration cycles and within 
a reasonable time span (not to mention the increased time and cost to fabricate and 
assemble the components of the soft structure as a whole).
For on-orbit thermal, moisture and creep stability, graphite and quartz cords 
are the materials of choice for fabricating the soft structure. Although graphite is 
often preferred due to its higher stiffness, it poses significant risk for PIM-critical 
applications since the main (forward) net makes casual (i.e., low-pressure) contact 
with the mesh, thus promoting PIM. For those applications, quartz must be used. 
Additionally, because quartz fibers are much finer than graphite, braided quartz 
cords are very durable and can be more easily terminated by the use of special 
knots—and hence are preferred by some reflector designers.
Positional and preload adjustments of the various components of the soft struc­
ture have traditionally been accomplished via the use of threaded hardware. How­
ever, two Boeing/Hughes patents [15, 16] describe methods for terminating and 
adjusting the length of cords by using a “continually adjustable non-return knot.” 
Several examples have been described for using this special knot for tying a cord 
to a structure, or for tying two cords together through a small bead. Continuous 
and smooth adjustment of the cord’s length can be achieved by pulling its loose 
end through the knot, while temporarily relieving its tension [Figures 8.13(a) and 
(b)] [15, 16]. In some applications, a release loop is added to the knot to facilitate 

360 
���������������������
Deployable Reflectors
loosening and readjusting the cord during the surface assembly and adjustment 
process. The release loops are often removed after the surface adjustment is final­
ized and prior to the final reflector acceptance testing. 
8.7.3  The Deploying Structure
As mentioned earlier, many different styles of deployable reflectors that use the 
knitted mesh have been developed. Those styles differ primarily in the design of the 
deploying structures they utilize. These reflectors have been developed in the United 
States, Europe, and Asia. A number of these reflector styles are discussed in this 
subsection. The fact that the majority of the discussion pertains to U.S.-developed 
reflectors is more a reflection of the authors’ extent of personal familiarity with 
them than of their importance or efficiency. It is interesting to note that, although 
much of the initial development in the field of deployable reflectors has been carried 
out under the auspices of government entities such as JPL and other NASA centers 
in the United States and ESA in Europe, beginning in the mid-1990s, the torch has 
been transferred to the commercial arena, and much of the recent progress has been 
funded in support of commercial satellite programs. Progress in Asia and to a large 
extent in Europe, however, is still being made with the support of government fund­
ing, perhaps because it is still in the earlier stages of development. 
8.7.3.1  The Radial-Rib Reflector (RRR) 
The umbrella-style reflector developed by Harris Corporation for the NASA/TRW 
TDRS satellite was perhaps the first knitted mesh reflector developed (Figure 8.14). 
It is a 4.8m main reflector of a Cassegrain antenna. It comprises 18 contoured tu­
bular graphite ribs hinged to a central hub. It uses a 10-OPI knitted mesh, except in 
its central region, where a denser mesh is used. It operates up to the Ku-band range. 
Although a dozen of these reflectors have been successfully flown, a similar one that 
Harris built for the NASA Galileo mission failed to deploy. Circumstantial evidence 
points to the failure of a launch-lock as the likely cause.

More recent RRRs built by Harris corporation use fewer straight tubular ribs 
(i.e., not contoured) (Figure 8.15), which are lighter and stow more compactly. 
Depending on spacecraft accommodations, reflectors of this style as large as 8m in 
diameter, may be feasible to stow in a standard 4m fairing. 
A third RRR variant was developed and patented by Hughes (now Boeing) in 
1997 [17]. It is designed to have a low stowage profile, such that an offset reflector 
with a physical size of 15m × 12.25m can be accommodated in a standard 3.7m 
fairing without the need to articulate the ribs. To achieve this feat, the reflector was 
designed with the following features:
••
A very compact hub that fits near the tip of even the tightest 4m fairing nose 
cone.
••
Efficient highly tapered contoured ribs with only 2 in. high at their tips.
••
An odd number of ribs (31) that permits nesting of the long attachment rib at 
one reflector end between the two longest ribs from its opposite end.
••
A powerful composite hub deployment apparatus [18], which comprises 
a composite deployment shaft that stows primarily below the hub during 
launch.
The contoured attachment rib was built sufficiently stiff to permit achieving a 
1-Hz resonance when the entire reflector is carried from it on orbit. The remaining 
30 contoured ribs were routed out of lightweight graphite honeycomb sandwich 
panels. They were trussed out to be so mass efficient that the longest ribs, which

were over 24 feet in length, weighed under 1 kg each. The entire reflector, except 
for the stiff attachment rib, could be deployed unassisted in a 1G field. Figure 
8.16 shows deployed and stowed sketches of the antenna mounted on the Hughes 
Geomobile spacecraft. Figure 8.17 shows a photograph of the 15m × 12.25m en­
gineering model reflector deployed without a 1G offloader. Figure 8.18 depicts the 
composite hub deployment apparatus and a typical composite honeycomb deploy­
ment rib. 
8.7.3.2  The Folding-Rib Reflector (FRR)
As with a regular umbrella, folding the ribs makes for more compact stowage. 
Folding-rib antennas were developed by both TRW and Harris, mostly in the 1980s 
and 1990s. However, with TRW acquiring Astro Aerospace from SPAR around the 
turn of this century, including its then newly developed AstroMesh reflector tech­
nology, they limited their deployable reflector development effort to studies aimed 
at improving the AstroMesh reflector. Harris proceeded to develop several folding-
rib umbrella designs, most of which having a single mid-rib hinge with diameters 
as large as 18m (an example of an FRR deployed in the test chamber is shown in 
Figure 8.19).

A more compact design, utilizing “bat-wing” style riblets integrated into the 
forward net to produce an almost fully round reflecting surface, was flown by 
Harris for the first time on the ICO spacecraft in 2008. This design permitted the 
use of even fewer and somewhat shorter ribs than their older FRR design shown 
in Figure 8.19, for the same required reflector diameter. Figure 8.20 is an on-orbit 
photograph taken from a spacecraft-mounted camera of the fully deployed ICO 
reflector, with the bat-wing riblets clearly visible. This design idea is applicable to 
all recent styles and sizes of Harris reflectors.
8.7.3.3  The Hoop-Column (Maypole) Reflector
In the 1980s, Harris developed the hoop-column (Maypole) reflector under a NASA 
Langley contract for the LSST program. The design was aimed at developing a 
large 100m-diameter parent paraboloid, of which four separate offset reflectors

are formed. As a proof-of-concept task, Harris built and tested a 15m engineering 
model reflector. As the name implies, it includes a telescoping column and an articu­
lating hoop. These are the only compression-carrying members in the system. The 
large mesh and net are shaped by a system of cables extending between the column 
and the hoop. Figures 8.21 and 8.22 show the general concept and a rough deploy­
ment sequence [19]. Because the concept is aimed at very large reflectors, it neces­
sarily has a very high stowage efficiency. For example, this 15m model stows inside 
a 2.7m high by 0.9m diameter cylinder. This design was the result of the realization 
that as the reflector gets larger, a hoop, rather than an umbrella-type structure, is 
most efficient [20].
8.7.3.4  The AstroMesh Reflector
This very efficient reflector structure was developed by Astro Aerospace in the 
1990s. A 12.25m version was flown on the Thuraya spacecraft in 2000 and seven 
other units having 9m to 12m aperture diameters have flown on various missions 
as of this writing. The general concept of the reflector was shown earlier in Figure 
8.11(c). The deployment structure is a perimeter truss that stows by allowing the 
telescoping truss diagonals to expand, thus causing its bays to collapse. Deployment 
is effected by shortening a cable that runs continuously through the diagonals and 
wraps around a pair of drums located on the deployment booms at either end of 
the cable. This provides redundancy, since operation of either one of the drums can 
deploy the entire reflector.
This type of perimeter structure, which has no central structural feature, is par­
ticularly suited for use on an offset-fed reflector, where it is supported via a short 
boom attached to a point along the perimeter truss (Figure 8.23) [8]. As mentioned 
in Section 8.7.2, this reflector uses relatively stiff triangular (geodesic) front and 
Figure 8.19  Artist’s conception of folding-rib reflector deployed on orbit (Harris Corporation).

Deployable Reflectors
back nets fabricated out of Kevlar (or graphite) straps, which provide the reflector 
with much of its in-plane stiffness and thermal stability. The front and back nets are 
pulled toward each other by a set of spring-loaded drop ties located at each of the 
net vertices, which provide for a significant tension field in the nets. 
Although all AstroMesh reflectors flown to date operate at the L- and S-band 
ranges, studies have confirmed its suitability for use at the Ku- and Ka-bands with 
impressive performance, for up to 12m and 6m diameters, respectively. Two other 
factors make this design suitable for high-frequency applications: 
••
Its excellent thermal distortion performance, aided by the lack of the system­
atic/periodic errors usually associated with the umbrella rib pattern, leaving 
much of the distortion as global shape changes that can be largely mitigated 
by active fine pointing correction [13]. Also, the inherently shorter boom 
makes for a lower boom thermal distortion contribution. 
••
Its inherently high stiffness, due to its drum-like structure, and its use of a 
relatively short boom with a load path that does not need to first reach the 
hub, as is the case with an umbrella-style reflector. The higher stiffness makes 
for less interaction with the spacecraft control system, resulting in better 
pointing stability, which is much needed for high-frequency applications, as 
discussed in Section 8.8.2. 
As mentioned in the hoop-column reflector discussion, reflectors that are based 
within a circumferential ring are more suited for larger apertures than the historic 
umbrella type [20]. Add to this its suitability for use on offset-fed reflectors, and 
you have what may be considered the most efficient large reflector design available. 
More recent developments at Astro are aimed at further reductions in the stowed

ployed on orbit, 2008 (Harris Corporation).

reflector length and diameter, in order to permit packaging reflectors as large as 
100m within currently available booster fairings [9]. 
8.7.3.5  Other Hoop-Based Reflectors
In addition to the AstroMesh and the hoop-column, other hoop-based design reflec­
tor designs have been developed, and two of them have been flown. The largest and 
most recent of these is the Harris hoop-truss reflector, a 22m version of which was 
flown in 2010 on what became the largest commercial satellite in orbit. The deploy­
ment structure is a ring-like truss combining folding rigid tubes for its compression 
members with preloaded cords for its tension members. The structure shown in 
Figure 8.24 is an octagonal ring truss with three rigid members in each bay, plus a 
multitude of pretensioned cords. Additional folding mechanisms at the middle of 
the long sides enable compact stowage of the structure. The mesh and the forward 
net stretch across the top corners of the deployment structure. As with the Harris

orbital station (Figure 8.25) [21] in July 1999. As can be seen from the photograph, 
the hoop structure is a cylindrical pantograph that stretches a set of radial soft ribs 
that connect to a central fitting (somewhat like the hoop-column reflector). The 
reflector stows in a compact 0.6m diameter by 1.0m high package, and weighs a 
total of 35 kg, including its electrical deployment system. 
8.7.3.6  Modular Mesh Reflector
A new concept in deployable reflector architecture was pioneered by the National 
Areospace Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) on what they called the Large 
Deployable Reflector (LDR), of which they launched a pair on the Engineering 
Test Satellite VIII (ETS-VIII) in December 2006. Cameras on board the satellite 
photographed the reflectors as they were being deployed; the fully deployed photo­
graphs are shown in Figure 8.26 [22]. As can be seen, each reflector comprises 14 
hexagonally shaped modules. The modules are 4.8m each (tip-to-tip) and the com­
posite reflector spans 19m × 17m with a conservative inscribed projected circular 
aperture of 14m. Ozawa [22] describes the design of the module (Figure 8.27) as 
having a gold-molybdenum mesh with a triangular quartz net, quartz drop ties, and 
quartz spider web-shaped aft reaction cords. The deployment structure comprises 
six radial collapsible ribs, each looking like one of the bays of an AstroMesh reflec­

tor. Deployment is effected by a combination of motors for controlled reversible 
deployment and springs for added deployment force margins.
The advantages of a modular design are fairly obvious and significant. Of the 
most important are the programmatic advantages associated with the ability to 
build, test, and adjust the modules in parallel, in smaller/cheaper facilities. Techni­
cal advantages include more accurate surface accuracy due to better offloading ac­
curacy, and scalability of the design to various sizes by increasing either the number 
or the size of the modules, or both. The design also provides for compact stowage, 
whereby the entire 19m × 17m reflector stows within a 1m-diameter by 4m-long 
package, which is more efficient than the 12 m AstroMesh reflector stowage.

8.7.3.7  The Arbitrarily Shaped Mesh Reflector
Although almost any mesh reflector can be used to provide a nonparaboloidal gen­
tly shaped surface, providing an arbitrarily shaped mesh surface (i.e., one that may 
have both positive and negative curvature regions) requires specific reflector design 
changes. Such a specialized reflector was developed by Boeing in 2005 with a patent 
filed in February 2006 (Figure 8.28) [11]. That patented reflector uses a radial-rib 
design as an illustration; however, other reflector styles may also be usable. Because 
the nature of an arbitrarily shaped surface involves higher surface curvatures (both 
positive and negative), and since the normal loading on the net elements is propor­
tional to the angles between the facets surrounding them (which is proportional to 
the surface curvature), such a reflector requires significantly higher preloads in its 
net. With the higher preload comes the need for a stronger deployment mechanism

(or springs) and stronger/stiffer deployment structure (or ribs). Therefore, instead 
of the tubular ribs usually used on umbrella reflectors, tapered ribs routed out of 
composite sandwich plates are preferred. Those ribs provide the higher preloads 
needed. The tapered shape is consistent with the higher loads toward the roots of 
the ribs. 
This type of reflector preferably uses a net with square (or rectangular) open­
ings. A number of the advantages provided by rectangular nets were discussed 
previously in Section 8.7.2. There are two additional advantages particular to an 
arbitrarily shaped reflector net. First, as the net is modified during the surface ad­
justment process, the lengths of the web elements change slightly. With a square/
rectangular net, the entire net cord, stretching from one end of the reflector to its 
opposite end, acts as one cord along which those changes in length can be equal­
ized and averaged, resulting in only minimal preload changes. This effect is further 
aided via the use of relatively soft net cords. Second, since shaping of a surface that 
includes reversed curvatures requires pushing on the surface at certain locations 
(instead of pulling), those elements that are under compression need to be stabi­
lized in at least two different directions. This precludes the use of intermediate edge 
control points for any “push” locations [as was the case with the old RRR used on 
TDRS and shown in Figure 8.11(b), for example].
A novel design was devised for the “push” elements used at the reversed curva­
ture locations [Figures 8.29(a) and (b)]. That design uses a telescoping spring-load­
ed tube through which extends a standard, finely adjustable tension tie. The spring-
loaded telescoping tube pretensions the tension tie, thus allowing it to sustain both 
tensile and compressive loads, as long as the compressive load does not exceed its 
preload. Because the tension tie itself is much stiffer than the spring-loaded tele­
scoping tube, the stiffness and thermal expansion properties of the pair are domi­
nated by the drop tie properties, regardless of the properties of the telescoping tube. 
Figure 8.28  Arbitrarily shaped mesh reflector (mesh not shown) [11].

8.7  Knitted-Mesh Surface Reflectors

To maintain a stable high tension in the net throughout the life of the reflec­
tor and at all temperature conditions, the net cords are tensioned against eight 
perimeter catenary members, the ends of which are tensioned by pivot arms that 
terminate with composite flexures. The large flexibility of those flexures makes for 
a stable tension load throughout the net elements. 
Similarly, stability of the tension in the aft catenary members is provided via 
termination of each of them at a composite flexure, which in turn attaches to one 
of the deployment ribs [Figure 8.29(c)]. The large flexibility of those flexures pro­
vides a high enough deflection to be an accurate indicator for the catenary initial 
tensions, as well as the stability of those tensions. 
8.7.4  Mesh and Soft-Structure Management Provisions 
The biggest risk of failure in a deployable knitted mesh reflector is that of en­
tanglement of the mesh or the soft structure in a manner that halts the deployment 
or damages the reflector if deployment is “forced through.” Therefore, sufficient 
mesh/soft structure management features are typically needed to ensure the safe 
and reliable deployment of the reflector. The design and placement of those features 
requires significant hands-on experience and is as much of an art as it is a science. 
Some of the principles and tools involved are: 
1.	 The management provisions should permit only gradual release of the 
mesh and soft structure as deployment progresses such that the portions

(b)

���������������������
Deployable Reflectors
released are not large or long enough to reach and entangle around other 
components. 
2.	 One commonly accepted rule for assessing the adequacy of the manage­
ment features at any point in the deployment process is called the “one-
hand rule.” It suggests that management features are inadequate if one can 
use a single hand to cause a portion of the mesh or soft structure to wrap 
around another component in such a way that the deployment tends to 
be halted (or damage becomes imminent). This usually indicates that ad­
ditional (or different) features are needed.
3.	 Another important principle in designing deployment systems and mesh 
management devices is to design for “soft failure.” This means that if a 
hard “snag” should develop during deployment, the deployment motor 
should stall (or its drive clutch capability be overcome) or at least a clear 
telemetry indication of off-normal behavior must be received, resulting in 
an automatic pause or abort command before a “hard” structural failure 
can occur. Breakaway features may also be provided for some of the man­
agement provisions/cords so that a snag may resolve itself with minimal or 
no damage. Because most deployment structures have variable mechanical 
advantage over a given snag at different points in deployment, and be­
cause it is not known beforehand at what point a snag will occur or what 
load it can develop and yet remain “safe,” then using a set stall torque or 
clutch torque limit may compromise deployment reliability. Some system 
designers may thus choose to provide additional “boost” motor power, 
which theoretically can exceed the minimum capability of the structure, 
but which can only be applied through ground intervention after all other 
available means to resolve a deployment stall have been exhausted. Yet 
another useful strategy is to current-limit the motor torque in anticipation 
of a nominal deployment; the torque limiting value can even be varied as 
a function of deployment progress based on analytical results or known 
nominal deployment profiles. At any time during deployment, it would be 
possible to override the preset current limit and use a more aggressive yet 
“safe” limit.
4.	 Other safety features that are considered desirable in designing a deploy­
able system include installation of on-orbit observation cameras, which 
could help and to possibly identify the cause of a hangup or a snag. Anoth­
er feature that some system designers utilize is the ability to relieve built-up 
strain due to a snag or another anomaly by a passive backdrive capability 
of the actuator, or the ability to reverse the deployment motion altogether 
in case of a hangup. Although backing down to lower levels of strain is 
usually a safe strategy, full reversal of the deployment motion, however, 
should be considered very carefully and only be used as a last resort, espe­
cially in the absence of an adequate observation system, since backing up 
the deployment for any significant distance can result in large uncontrolled 
mesh/cord spans, which can lead to more entanglement.
A main concern in evaluating the adequacy of the management features is that 
the 1-G offloaders used during deployment are often inadequate, especially when 

8.8  Reflector Subsystem Design Considerations  
375
it comes to offloading the soft structure. The 1-G environment tends to cause the 
soft structure (and the mesh) to behave in a somewhat regular and predictable/
repeatable manner. However, in zero-G any built-in or residual stresses in the soft 
structure (e.g., cords) cause it to move in an unpredictable manner and sometimes 
take bizarre shapes. This is why the one-hand rule permits manipulation of the soft 
structure into any shape that can be imposed on it by the use of a single hand.	
Some of the features that have been successfully used for managing the mesh/
soft structure include the following:
1.	 Attaching plastic rings or washers to the mesh/net then passing control/
management elements (which may be rigid or semirigid) through them. The 
mesh is then draped or fanfolded between the rings for launch in a manner 
similar to a theatre curtain or a drape. During deployment, the control/
management element is gradually withdrawn, allowing the rings to sequen­
tially fall off and release successive portions of the mesh/net. An example of 
this system is described in a Boeing patent [Figures 8.30(a) and (b)] [15]. 
2.	 In another example, snaps are used to shorten certain management straps, 
which cause portions of the mesh/net to be “bunched up” during launch. 
As the deployment structure starts to deploy, it pulls on the straps, which in 
turn “unsnaps” the snaps in a sequential manner, permitting the mesh/net 
to deploy gradually. Other means, such as Velcro fasteners or looped plas­
tic elements, may be used instead of the snaps to produce a more gradual 
release. 
3.	 Other soft structures, such as cords, may be controlled by passing them 
through snug semiflexible “spaghetti” tubing [15] or stowing them in Zip­
loc bag-style pouches. The cords may also be controlled by looping them 
through a pair of snug-fitting holes in a fixed (or deploying) component, 
which keeps the cords taut during deployment by requiring them to over­
come the friction force needed to pull it through those holes.
4.	 The patent also describes a technique in which the mesh control cords are 
formed into loops that are then placed around the teeth of a comb-like 
component. This component is kept in a locked position during launch by 
snubbing it against certain members of the deployment structure. As those 
members are deployed, the comb-like component is released and permitted 
to rotate to a new position, thus allowing the loops to slip off and release 
the cords being controlled [Figures 8.30(c) and (d)]. 
The possibilities are almost endless, but all control devices utilized need to be 
carefully characterized through multiple environmental test runs, and the adequacy 
of the entire management system needs to be evaluated through multiple partial 
and/or full cup-up and cup-down deployments. 
8.8  Reflector Subsystem Design Considerations 
Deployable reflector subsystem specifications typically include electrical as well 
as mechanical, thermal, and environmental requirements. The electrical require­
ments include allowable gain-loss, allowable side/grating lobe levels, passive 

376 
���������������������

intermodulation (PIM) levels, and electrostatic discharge (ESD) requirements. The 
mechanical requirements include geometric requirements for both deployed and 
stowed configurations (e.g., aperture diameter, focal length, offset, stowed volume, 
shadowing, and stay-out requirements), mass properties, stowed and deployed fre­
quencies, and pointing requirements. In this section, we discuss the electrical and 
critical mechanical design drivers; thermal and environmental requirements are just 
briefly touched on. 
8.8.1  Electrical Requirements 
8.8.1.1  Gain-Loss Allowance
The total allowable gain-loss from all sources for a deployable reflector subsystem 
is one of its most critical design drivers, and must be specified in order for the entire 
system to operate successfully. For commercial low- to medium-frequency reflectors 
(L- through Ku-band), a total loss of 0.3 dB has been shown to be achievable [13]. 
Using the well-known Ruze formula [23], this translates to a maximum equivalent 
root-mean-square (RMS) error of λ/50, where λ is the minimum operating wave­
length. For a higher frequency/shorter wavelength, higher gain-loss [24] has often 
been permitted by the system design, especially for larger reflectors (e.g., greater 
than 500λ in diameter). All sources of gain-loss must be accounted for, although 
some of the smaller contributors are often lumped together. The following is a brief 
discussion of those losses: 
1.	 Blockage loss: In center-fed reflectors, shadowing from the feed elements, 
waveguides, subreflector, and often feed supports cause effective area loss, 
which must be accounted for in the design. Fortunately, this type of loss 
is usually entirely avoidable for offset-fed reflectors. This is particularly 
Figure 8.30  Examples of soft structure management provisions [15].

important for multibeam antennas (MBAs), where the size of the feed clus­
ter can be significant. The gain-loss due to blockage is given by the follow­
ing simple equation:

2.	 Surface roughness/random loss: This is usually due to manufacturing er­
rors/tolerances, as well as roughness of the reflective surfaces and inaccura­
cies in locating/adjusting the net vertices. The RMS error of the measured 
reflector surface relative to the “as-designed” theoretical faceted surface 
can be plugged into the Ruze formula to calculate this loss contribution: 
	
Gain loss (dB) = 688 (RMS error/ λ)2	
3.	 Faceting loss: The difference between the ideal surface and the faceted ap­
proximation introduced by the forward net theoretical shape is referred to 
as the faceting error. The faceting loss is the difference in gain performance 
between these two theoretical surfaces. This performance difference can be 
determined via RF analysis of the gains obtainable from the two surfaces. 
Reference [13] showed that a slightly conservative estimate for this facet­
ing loss, at least for triangular facets, can be obtained by calculating the 
RMS of the differences between these two surfaces and substituting that 
value into the Ruze formula. This is despite the fact that the faceting er­
ror is actually a systematic error, whereas Ruze’s formula was derived for 
random errors. This approximation is particularly convenient for prelimi­
nary designs, because it allows for easy optimization of the facet size. This 
optimization is important because the cost and time required to build a 
deployable reflector are driven, to a great extent, by the number of facets 
used. 
	
  Hudgepeth [25] has derived simple relationships between the facet size 
(l), the focal length (F), and the faceting RMS error (WRMS) for various 
facet shapes that can be rewritten as follows: 
	
l = K(F ⋅ WRMS)1/2	
	
where K = 7.87 for triangular facets; 6.17 for square facets; 7.33 for rect­
angular facets having widths less than 0.5l; and 6.82 for gore-shaped nets, 
wherein l represents the gore width at the rim. 
4.	 Pillowing loss: As described in Section 8.7.2, the curvature of the reflector 
surface, coupled with the tension in the mesh, loads the net cords, causing 
them to curve slightly toward the reflector focus, which causes the mesh to 
curve toward the focus as well. This deviation from the theoretically flat 
facet surface constitutes the faceting error. It can be shown that the pillow­
ing error is proportional to the faceting error multiplied by the ratio of the 
total mesh tension to the net tension. Because that tension ratio is usually 

378 
���������������������
Deployable Reflectors
kept low (about 0.1), the pillowing error is often very small. Reference 
[25] provides equations for the combined pillowing and faceting errors for 
facets of various shapes. From those equations, one can derive the follow­
ing relationship between the RMS of the pillowing error and that of the 
faceting error:
	
WRMSpillowing = K1 ⋅ WRMSfaceting ⋅ (Nl/T)
	
where N is the mesh tension, l is the facet edge length, and T is the net cord 
tension. The constant K1 = 0.33 for triangular facets, and 0.2 for square 
facets. If Nl/T is kept below 0.1, then the pillowing RMS is only 1% to 2% 
of the faceting RMS. Note, however, that since the faceting and pillowing 
errors are directly correlated, the magnitudes of their corresponding RMSs 
should be added directly (and not RSSed), and the resultant RMS error can 
be used to calculate a combined faceting/pillowing gain-loss from the Ruze 
formula (for preliminary analysis). 
5.	 Thermal distortion and moisture desorption losses: Due to the temperature 
extremes that reflectors are exposed to on orbit, thermal distortion is often 
a significant contributor to the reflector’s gain-loss. Unfortunately, evaluat­
ing thermal distortion losses is a complex process that requires significant 
interdisciplinary effort involving thermal, thermomechanical, and electrical 
(RF) analyses interaction. It is therefore almost never performed during the 
preliminary design stage, but rather reserved for the final design verifica­
tion stage, with an estimated “allowance” made for it in the earlier stages.
	
  In general, the process starts with performing transient thermal analysis 
for at least two orbit periods at each season (summer, winter, and equi­
nox) using both beginning-of-life (BoL) and end-of-life (EoL) properties. 
Spacecraft shadowing, eclipses, and through-the-thickness gradients in the 
ribs/booms are important considerations for those analyses. The tempera­
tures determined are then mapped onto a detailed thermo-structural finite 
element model for a large number of time steps for each season at both 
BoL and EoL, and the surface deflections determined. For this stage, good 
knowledge of the reflector’s components, including soft structure stiffness 
and CTE properties (including rotational CTEs), as well as the uncertainty/
variability of those properties, is critical. Finally, either a best-fit analysis is 
performed to separate elastic surface distortions from rigid body rotations/
translations and defocusing, or direct RF analysis is performed to directly 
determine the gain-loss and beam mispointing.
	
  Moisture desorption effects are also evaluated in a manner analogous 
to thermal distortions, but by using coefficients of moisture expansion 
(CMEs) instead of the CTEs. The resulting distortion limits can be added 
as initial reflector shape distortions to all thermal distortion cases, or the 
resulting gain-loss evaluated and added separately (or in combination with 
other effects such as creep, relaxation, and radiation effects) for both BoL 
and EoL evaluations.
6.	 Deployment repeatability, measurement uncertainty, and 1-G relief losses: 
These factors represent uncertainties in the initial on-orbit shape relative 

8.8  Reflector Subsystem Design Considerations

to the final measurements performed on the ground. Reasonable estimates 
are made for the effects of these uncertainties on the shape with the results 
RSSed together, and the corresponding equivalent loss added to the other 
gain-loss components. For example, the deployment repeatability effect is 
evaluated by comparing the results of successive surface measurements tak­
en after each deployment test, excluding those separated by environmental 
exposures. Measurement uncertainty, on the other hand, is evaluated based 
on knowledge of the measurement system accuracy (typically photogram­
metry), the available shooting angles, and the number of shots taken. The 
1-G relief effects depend on the quality of the 1-G offloaders used, how 
well the soft structures are offloaded, and how large and nonlinear (cup 
up vs. cup down) the predicted mesh deflections are in the offloaded test 
environment. 
7.	 Mesh reflectivity loss: Gold-molybdenum meshes are available in several 
densities suitable for use up to Ka-band. Reference [13] presents analytical 
and measured data on 10-, 20-, and 30-OPI meshes, and discusses a newer 
low-loss mesh for Ka-band applications (Figure 8.31) [13]. The data and 
discussions suggest that with the use of the appropriate mesh density, the 
reflectivity loss can always be kept within 0.1 dB. It also suggests that the 
10-OPI mesh is suitable for use up to C-band, the 20-OPI up to Ku-band, 
and the 30-OPI up to Ka-band. 
8.8.1.2  Other Electrical Requirements 
Depending on the system design, several other electrical requirements may become 
important drivers for the reflector design. Low sidelobe and/or grating lobe levels 
may be necessary to reduce interference and improve beam-to-beam insulation, 
especially for MBAs. The outside perimeter shape of the deployable reflector (e.g., 
round vs. octagonal with perimeter catenaries as in Figure 8.12) can significantly

affect the sidelobe levels. Additionally, as discussed in Section 8.7.2, grating lobes 
can develop as a result of using uniformly spaced facets, such as square or the geo­
desic triangular nets used on the AstroMesh reflector. Those grating lobes can be 
broken down to much smaller lobes by introducing variations in the net opening 
sizes, as described in [14] and illustrated in Figure 8.12. 
For other systems, such as those using a dual-mode reflector that combines 
both Tx and Rx functionality, PIM avoidance can become a critical driver. For ex­
ample, the FleetSatcom spacecraft built by TRW in the early 1970s was originally 
intended to utilize a dual-mode deployable reflector that used a woven mesh. Unac­
ceptable PIM levels, however, forced the redesign of the system to add a separate 
Rx antenna in the 11th hour. Additionally, since high PIM levels are generated as 
a result of casual (i.e., low-pressure) metal-to-metal contacts between conductors, 
the wires forming the woven reflective mesh had to be welded/soldered together 
at each mesh wire intersection. Alternatively, woven meshes may have to use insu­
lated wires for PIM reduction. As mentioned in Section 8.7, the gold-molybdenum 
knitted meshes produce acceptably low PIM levels, as long as they are kept clean 
from metallic debris; otherwise, a mesh woven out of Aracon threads can be used 
to avoid PIM under all conditions. In addition to design considerations to avoid ca­
sual metal-to-metal contact throughout the antenna system, extensive PIM testing 
in specially designed PIM-free facilities is also necessary for PIM-sensitive systems. 
Electrostatic discharge avoidance is another design driver for many deployable 
reflectors. Mitigating it typically involves avoiding large nonconductive surfaces 
that can get charged in the space environment, and then discharged suddenly, caus­
ing either physical damage to the low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) or sufficiently fre­
quent low-level discharges that interfere with the operation of the communications 
system. Although designing for ESD avoidance is typically an easy task with the 
use of proper ESD coatings, simultaneously avoiding both ESD and PIM is much 
trickier since they entail somewhat competing requirements. A number of compa­
nies, however, have developed proprietary plastics, resins, and coatings that satisfy 
both requirements. 
8.8.2  Mechanical Requirements 
Meeting the basic reflector deployed and stowed geometric requirements is the ba­
sic driver in developing the large variety of deployable reflectors discussed through­
out this chapter and therefore will not be further discussed in this section.
8.8.2.1  Mass Properties
Because of the sheer size of the deployable reflectors, minimizing mass and inertia 
has been a major thrust in developing those reflectors. Thanks to the lightweight 
knitted mesh (that by itself weighs only about 0.025 kg/m2), very lightweight mesh 
reflectors have been developed. An areal mass of 0.37 kg/m2 was reported for the 
12.25m AstroMesh reflector (excluding its boom and stowage cage) [12], with 
lower values predicted for larger reflectors [9].

8.8  Reflector Subsystem Design Considerations  
381
8.8.2.2  Frequency Requirements
To avoid significant interaction with the attitude control system (ACS), and since 
deployable reflectors represent large appendages with very high inertias, a mini­
mum deployed frequency requirement is typically specified for the reflector. For 
smaller reflectors and older control systems, frequencies in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 
Hz were specified; however, with larger reflectors and state-of-the-art control sys­
tems, frequencies in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 Hz are tolerable with careful ACS de­
sign. Often, the deployed frequency is dominated by the boom stiffness, the stiffness 
of the local area of the reflector where the boom is attached, and the deployment 
mechanisms. Stowed frequencies, on the other hand, are specified for minimizing 
launch loads, just as with any other structure. It is appropriate, to a large extent, for 
the reflector deployment structure to be sized for deployed frequency and launch 
loads, but not launch frequencies. Instead, the stowage restraint subsystem, which 
supports the reflector in its stowed configuration, should be designed to enable the 
reflector system to meet the stowed frequencies. 
8.8.2.3  Pointing Requirements 
As deployed reflectors get larger, and higher frequencies more prevalent, the RF 
beams get smaller in width. For example, for communications from Martian dis­
tances at high data rates, (of the order of 1 Gbps) a joint NASA/Boeing paper [26] 
suggested that reflectors with diameters of the order of 1,000 wavelengths would 
be needed. Such a reflector would produce an RF beam of the order of 1.5 milli­
radians (mrad) in width. To limit the pointing loss to less than 1 dB, the pointing 
error from all sources needs to be less than 0.5 mrad, which represents a significant 
design challenge. 
Pointing requirements include pointing accuracy and pointing stability. Many 
factors contribute to each of these, which must be carefully budgeted and veri­
fied. The deployable reflector is only one of the contributors to pointing errors. 
As mentioned in Section 8.8.1, under thermal distortion loss, the best-fit analysis 
performed on the distortion data separates the rigid body motions from the elastic 
distortions. Those rigid body motions represent the reflector’s thermal distortion 
contribution to the pointing error. Similarly, the moisture distortion analysis re­
sults in a BoL contribution to pointing. In addition, to the reflector, the reflector 
boom, feed support, and the bus itself all contribute to the thermal and moisture 
distortions, and must be accounted for in the system pointing budget. Additionally, 
dynamic interaction between the reflector and its boom with the control system 
provides yet another contribution to pointing inaccuracy. 
Finally, the pointing error contributors are bucketed into various groups, de­
pending on the time domain. For example, ground alignment accuracy, launch 
hysteresis effects on the reflector, boom and deployment mechanisms, moisture 
desorption effects, and average orbital temperature distortions are all contributors 
to the initial “pointing accuracy,” or misalignment. Often, much of the effect of 
this initial misalignment is mitigated by various calibrations during initial on-orbit 
testing. In contrast, other variable or delayed contributors are “pointing stability” 
contributors. Those, in turn, are usually divided into short-, medium-, and long-
term stability contributors. Dynamic events due to station-keeping and momentum 

382 
���������������������
Deployable Reflectors
dumping are typical short-term stability error contributors, while thermal distor­
tion diurnal errors (typically occurring over one orbit period) represent medium-
term contributors. Finally, long-term errors include such contributions as creep, 
orbital radiation effects, and the difference between the mean BoL and EoL thermal 
pointing contributions. 
8.8.3  Thermal and Environmental Requirements
Thermal analyses and testing of deployable reflector systems are significant activi­
ties that are usually performed in the stowed, deployed, and “deploying” conditions 
of the reflector, with the objectives of ensuring that all materials and components 
remain within their safe temperature ranges and of providing data for use in the 
thermal distortion/pointing analyses previously discussed. In parallel with the ini­
tial analyses, thermal design and test activities take place in order to determine the 
appropriate thermal finishes and blankets needed, and to design and plan the ap­
propriate testing. 
Other environmental design drivers for a deployable reflector include effects 
of exposure to radiation and UV rays on the CTEs and dimensional stability of 
the materials, as well as effects of micro-meteoroids on survivability and surface 
integrity of the reflector (especially for an inflatable reflector). Another important 
requirement for all large reflectors is their optical transparency. This affects the 
electrical power subsystem, because the reflectors often shadow the solar panels 
(at least at certain times/seasons), as well as the ACS operation/fuel consumption, 
because solar pressures tend to push the spacecraft around. Therefore, minimum 
transparency requirements are often specified for deployable reflectors and could 
limit the acceptable mesh density; otherwise, a larger solar array (for power consid­
eration) and/or a solar sail (for ACS considerations) may be required.

This chapter provides the reader with a framework and top-level understanding of 
the elements and requirements that must be considered in the successful design, fab­
rication, and testing of a spaceflight antenna reflector. It is a guide based on more 
than 30 years of professional and personal experience in engineering, fabricating, 
and testing spaceflight antenna reflectors and systems.
Because the state of the art in antenna reflector design is continually advancing, 
this chapter is purposely written to provide general recommendations for configu­
ration, design approach, materials, and testing. A wealth of information is avail­
able from composite materials suppliers, technical papers, and organizations such 
as SAMPE, so it is left up to the reader to perform the detailed analyses, engineer­
ing, and materials research required to establish the best possible specific choices 
relative to the set of requirements for the particular reflector type being considered. 
A successful antenna reflector design is always a carefully balanced combination 
of many specific and interdependent choices that must all work together to achieve 
the best possible results.
9.1  Mechanical Considerations for Spaceflight Antenna Reflectors
The fundamental function of an antenna reflector is to collect, focus, and direct the 
energy radiated by an RF source, which is commonly single or multiple waveguide 
horns or other type of radiators. Sometimes multiple surfaces are used in the re­
flector antenna subsystem optics to further enhance antenna performance such as 
a subreflector/main reflector system. The reflector system may also contain more 
than one “antenna” such as a dual-shell (dual-polarized) reflector or a subreflector 

386

Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
that is frequency selective. In both of these cases, the antenna is effectively two an­
tennas packaged into the same volume.
From a physical packaging perspective reflectors systems fall into three broad 
categories:
1.	 Fixed-mount reflectors that have rigid RF surface(s) and are directly 
mounted to the satellite structure or other fixed appendage and remain in 
the same relative alignment on orbit as for launch.
2.	 Deployable reflectors that have rigid RF surface(s) and are moved (de­
ployed) via one or more mechanisms once on station to a different align­
ment or configuration from launch.
3.	 Furlable reflectors that have multiple-piece or deformable surfaces and are 
unfurled to the final desired surface shape after launch. An unfurled reflec­
tor may also be moved via one or more mechanisms once on station to a 
different alignment or configuration on orbit as for launch.
Note that the reflector systems of the last two entries above may also be mov­
able or steerable on orbit to either purposefully point the antenna beam or to 
perform an on-orbit beam correction or fine alignment. This is quite common on 
satellites that have more than one antenna where the relative pointing of multiple 
antennas needs to be very precise. 
9.2  Spaceflight Reflector Design Requirements
The exact physical requirements for a spaceflight reflector are dependent on the 
mission environmental and structural requirements as well as the RF performance 
requirements. The RF and mechanical requirements are interrelated and interde­
pendent to varying degrees. 
Antenna reflectors are primarily RF components and function as key mission-
critical items in the communications payload. The primary electrical performance 
parameter of the reflector (gain) is directly related to its aperture size. In almost all 
instances for commercial communications antennas, it is desirable to have the larg­
est aperture possible, thus increasing the gain, which reduces the amount of trans­
mitter power required and improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the receiving 
system. The optimum comsat reflector will have the largest aperture, most accurate 
surface figure, lowest mass, and lowest cost while satisfying all of the other mission 
requirements. For science missions, the reflector only needs to be large enough to 
take full advantage of the available bandwidth and provide an acceptable SNR. 
There are many established mechanical approaches/solutions to spaceflight re­
flector design depending on the exact RF and mission requirements, but in the end 
they are all compromises to some degree made to satisfy the basic requirements 
discussed next. Of course, the design engineer must also comply with the two criti­
cal nontechnical program requirements of cost and schedule, which for a typical 
commercial program almost always significantly constrain the design space.

9.2  Spaceflight Reflector Design Requirements 
387
9.2.1  RF Requirements
9.2.1.1  Aperture Size (Gain, Beamwidth)
The ideal reflector will have an aperture size large enough to minimize the payload 
power requirements while still satisfying the coverage (beamwidth) requirements. 
For a parabolic antenna the gain increases and the 3-dB beamwidth decreases with 
an increase in aperture diameter. 
9.2.1.2  Reflectivity of Surface
The ideal reflector will have a perfectly RF reflective (conductive) surface at the 
specified RF frequency resulting in no ohmic losses. 
Although a homogenous, solid, and continuous surface is optimum from an RF 
performance perspective, nonuniform, woven, or otherwise distributed materials 
are often used for their acceptable electrical properties and very good mechanical, 
thermal, and structural properties.
In general, carbon fiber composite communications reflectors operating below 
30 GHz are only occasionally metalized and reflectors operating above 60 GHz are 
often metalized.
9.2.1.3  Accuracy of Reflector Shape
The ideal reflector will have a perfectly accurate surface contour resulting in no 
losses due to scattering, diffraction, or phase-induced errors. RF performance deg­
radation sensitivity due to surface irregularities increases as the RF frequency in­
creases (wavelength decreases). 
Reflector shape accuracy is typically measured as a rms of the deviations of 
measured points to their ideal locations. Extremely high frequency reflectors such 
as those used on radiometers often require surface contours with rms accuracies 
approaching the submicron level. In addition to RMS surface errors, the peak er­
rors need to be carefully controlled for reflectors used for shaped or contoured 
beam applications.
9.2.2  Mechanical Requirements
9.2.2.1  Size/Volume
The reflector must fit within the available space inside of the launch vehicle fairing 
that is not already occupied by the satellite structure and its other appendages. This 
often means that the reflector must be deployed from the satellite structure or and 
sometimes also unfurled. As a rule, deploying and unfurling add complexity (cost), 
reduce the reliability of the antenna subsystem, and are employed only when defini­
tively required by a top-level systems engineering design trade-study. 
9.2.2.2  Stiffness
For launch the ideal reflector would be infinitely rigid, but in reality a reflector will 
be designed to have sufficiently high stiffness-to-mass ratio to prevent any dynamic 

388 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
interaction or coupling between the reflector and the fundamental launch vehicle 
and spacecraft modes in the launch configuration.
On orbit, the reflector system needs to have a stiffness that is greater than and 
that does not couple unfavorably with the attitude control system frequency or 
other deployed appendages such as solar arrays. The on-orbit (deployed) stiffness 
is not very often a structural design driver for a reflector, except for large furlables, 
but must still be carefully considered at the system level. 
Ground-handling (1G) effects must also be considered for fabrication, align­
ment, and RF testing. Special fixturing, tooling, and alignment procedures may be 
required. Great care must be exercised to ensure that the alignment achieved on the 
ground under 1G is replicated on orbit under 0G. For large reflectors, especially 
furlables, fixturing to eliminate or compensate for effects due to gravity deforming 
the reflector can be very challenging.
9.2.2.3  Strength
The reflector structure must be strong enough to survive launch loads (quasi-static, 
dynamic, acoustic, pressure, thermal), deployment loads, and on-orbit load cases 
(usually thermally driven). Although these are the typical minimum margin load 
cases, in some special instances other loads may need to be considered. For instance, 
it is not unusual for Mars missions to use the reflector as a part of the aero-braking 
surface of the spacecraft when entering orbit, and in some cases the launch vehicle 
fairing is jettisoned early enough during launch that free molecular heating may 
also be a design case.
Special consideration may also need to be made for ground handling including 
shipping, RF range testing, and deployment testing.
9.2.2.4  Mass
Being a spaceflight structure, the ideal reflector will have a mass that is as low as 
possible while meeting all of the other requirements.
The reflector may also need to carry nonstructural mass such as mechanisms, 
thermal control (blankets and paint) and occasionally other sensors, antennas, and 
balance mass.
Reducing and minimizing mass without complicating the design is often the 
single most effective means of also reducing fabrication costs and schedules, and 
because the loads are predominantly dynamically generated it also serves to reduce 
the interfacing loads and stresses.
9.2.2.5  Survivability (Thermal, Radiation, Atomic Oxygen, and So Forth)
The ideal materials used for reflector fabrication will not be susceptible to degrada­
tion from the on-orbit environment. The exact environments will vary depending 
on the mission profile, whether Earth orbit (low, medium, or geostationary) or in­
terplanetary. For certain environments such as low Earth orbit, which still has some 
oxygen atom presence (atomic oxygen), additional protection will be required for a 
typical composite reflector structure to prevent atomic oxygen erosion.

9.2  Spaceflight Reflector Design Requirements 
389
9.2.2.6  Dimensional Stability
The ideal reflector will not deform or distort due to on-orbit effects such as temper­
ature changes/gradients or moisture dryout. With currently known materials and 
manufacturing technology, it is not possible to create a perfectly stable reflector, but 
clever combinations of materials and design configurations can produce deforma­
tions that have very little or negligible effect on the RF performance of the reflector.
9.2.3  Reflector Geometries
9.2.3.1  Common Geometries
The most fundamental reflector shape is the parabola, which is a parabolic curve 
rotated about the focal axis. By means of simple ray tracing, energy originating at 
the focus of the parabola will be collimated and radiated parallel to the focal axis 
of the parabola. A center-fed system cuts the resulting surface with an aperture 
centered on the focal axis, and an offset system cuts the parabolic surface with an 
aperture parallel to the focal axis, but offset from it.
Dual-reflector systems utilizing a subreflector are also very common. The sub­
reflector collects a larger percentage of the energy radiated by the feed and directs 
it more efficiently onto the main reflector, thus reducing spillover and increasing 
the performance (gain, efficiency) of the antenna.
Most reflectors are circular in aperture when viewed along the antenna bore­
sight axis. An offset parabolic reflector will be elliptical when viewed in the plane 
of the edge of the reflector. If the reflector is of a parabolic surface contour and has 
a circular aperture cut in an axis parallel to the focal vector, then the rim of the 
reflector will also lay in a plane regardless of whether the reflector is center fed or 
offset. This simple geometric fact can often be used to simplify tooling, assemblies, 
and inspections. 
Commonly used fundamental antenna reflector geometries include the 
following:
••
Parabolic;
••
Cassegrain;
••
Gregorian;
••
Axially displaced ellipse (ADE);
••
Shaped reflectors;
••
Dual-surface reflectors, either polarization selective or frequency selective.
It is interesting to note that due to commercially available antenna design soft­
ware packages it is increasingly rare to see an antenna design that is a simple geo­
metric contour and not a “shaped” modification.
9.2.3.2  Modified (Shaped) Surface Geometries
Both the reflector aperture and surface shape may be modified from the parent 
(simple) geometry to influence the distribution of the RF energy, thus optimizing 

390 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
the antenna coverage, reducing spillover, or minimizing sidelobe levels. Modern 
communications antenna reflectors commonly utilize reflector surface shaping as a 
means to measurably improve RF performance. The antenna design starts off with 
simple standard parent geometry, such as a parabolic surface, and then using the 
RF design software, the parent surface is discretely displaced, modifying the phase 
front radiated from the reflector to create a far more efficient and optimized energy 
distribution. The magnitude of the surface deviation from the parent surface is a 
function of the frequency (wavelength) of the energy being radiated. Higher fre­
quencies (shorter wavelengths) will have fundamentally less physical surface devia­
tion than lower frequencies (longer wavelengths).
Shaped surface reflectors can present both structural and fabrication chal­
lenges, depending on the amount of physical deviation from the parent surface. 
At lower RF frequencies the shaping of the reflector can cause quite radical peaks 
and valleys that influence the geometrical structural properties and resulting stiff­
ness of the assembly, making the reflector shell more susceptible to mechanical and 
thermoelastic instability. Figure 9.1 shows the manufactured surface of a somewhat 
typical shaped surface reflector antenna.
Fabrication of a composite reflector shell with large surface deviations also 
presents issues and challenges. For example, maintaining proper fiber orientations 
to achieve the desired mechanical properties while forming the material to the cor­
rect contour requires careful materials choices and layup designs that may include 
darts, patches, and ply-pattern development. Another challenge, peculiar to sand­
wich-style construction, is ensuring that the core conforms to and is fully bonded to 
both the front and rear faceskins. Obviously, if the curvature is pronounced (small 
radius of curvature) and assuming a constant core thickness, the front and rear fac­
eskins will have quite different contours. When faced with this difference, a design/
materials decision must be made: (i) invest in two mandrel tools, one with the front 
contour and one with the back, and pre-cure both skins; (ii) co-cure the rear fac­
eskin directly against the core, supported only by the inside core and a caul-sheet 
on the backside; or (iii) machine or shape the core to provide the same contour to 
the front and rear faceskins.

9.3  Mechanical Design Considerations 
391
It is important for the mechanical design engineer to work closely with the 
antenna RF engineer to ensure that the fabrication techniques and implications are 
balanced against the theoretically optimized and idealized RF surface.  It is point­
less, but altogether too common, to have the RF engineer optimize the analytical 
RF surface to gain an additional small fraction of a decibel of performance only to 
discover that it is not feasible to fabricate the reflector accurately enough to realize 
that gain.
9.2.3.3  Modified (Noncircular) Reflector Apertures
The launch vehicle envelope available to package the reflector will almost always 
accommodate shapes other than the classic circular aperture. Enlarging the aper­
ture area of the reflector can capture energy from the feed that might spill over the 
edge of the reflector, theoretically increasing the antenna gain. Of course, nothing 
is free and for a conventional reflector with a single feed a noncircular aperture will 
degrade some key antenna performance parameters. But with surface shaping or a 
multiaperture feed, it is often possible to gain an RF performance benefit from the 
additional area of a noncircular aperture while minimizing the resulting negative 
consequences. With modern RF optimization techniques, it is not uncommon to 
see reflector apertures that are far from circular and in some instances look square 
or rectangular in shape with rounded corners. These are commonly termed super-
elliptic apertures.
9.3  Mechanical Design Considerations
Mechanical design considerations are outlined in the subsections below and possi­
ble approaches/solutions are suggested in the following construction considerations 
section. Although presented separately, design, analysis, test, and fabrication issues 
must be balanced against each other and also against the program limitations of 
cost and schedule.
9.3.1  Reflector Support Points and Interfaces
Probably the single most influential driver to the structural design of the reflector 
is the location and characterization of the support points or launch restraints. The 
more efficiently the reflector is supported, the less supporting structure that will 
be required to meet the dynamic loads and stiffness requirements. For example, a 
reflector that is cantilevered from one edge is going to be far more complex and 
challenging mechanically than one that it supported by four points equally spaced 
around a circular aperture. The launch configuration geometry is a key mechanical 
systems-level commitment, usually made very early in the program design phases. 
As a result the reflector design engineer often has very limited design flexibility in 
this regard. 
The structural characteristics of the reflector launch-lock interfaces and de­
ployment mechanisms must also be carefully considered during the reflector design 
and analysis activities. Although simple and idealized fixed-base assumptions for 
these interfaces may be convenient, the materials, stiffness, and degrees of freedom 

392 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
of the restraints are often so influential that a fixed-base assumption may unrealis­
tically drive the structural design of the reflector. Incorrect assumptions can easily 
lead to dramatically over- or underdesigning the reflector by either adding mass or 
potentially resulting in a structural failure during unit-level or subsystem testing.
The local interface mechanical properties and characteristics are just as impor­
tant as the interface geometry and fixity. A carbon fiber reflector mounted to an 
aluminum satellite structure via titanium or other metallic interfaces/mechanisms 
may result in significant thermal stresses due to differences in temperature and the 
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The reflector, satellite structure, and mech­
anism design teams will all need to be aware of the interface loads and the analysis 
assumptions used to generate them. Whether it is a restraint that needs to separate, 
or a hinge or gimbal that needs to deploy, static loads due to strain resulting from 
thermal, hygroscopic, or simple mechanical misalignment can significantly impair 
a mechanism’s ability to function as designed.
Environmentally testing the reflector also poses similar issues with fully and 
correctly representing/simulating the interface characteristics. For a reflector unit-
level test, it is impractical to design a vibration test fixture that accurately repre­
sents the flight structure interface; however, it should be designed such that the 
test considers the system-level loads, local stresses, and so forth, but not by a large 
margin that would overdesign the reflector and add unnecessary mass. How the 
reflector is going to be tested should not be overlooked and must be included or at 
least considered as a part of the reflector design and analysis cycle. Oftentimes the 
local stresses in the test configuration will not just envelop, but will be quite differ­
ent from the flight stresses, and may even be a minimum margin analysis case and 
in some cases a design driver. 
9.3.2  Mass
The mass of a reflector assembly is driven by the requirements and environments 
listed below but it is fundamentally dictated by the physical size (aperture), the 
support points (interface locations or launch locks), and the launch environment 
(loads). Remember that if a reflector did not have to survive the launch environ­
ment, it could be something as simple as a piece of electrically reflective foil with 
just enough structural stability to maintain its shape and location relative to the 
parent spacecraft on orbit. As with any good structural design, the design engineer 
logically begins with the elements that are already defined (i.e., the RF surface 
and interfaces) and then only adds just enough reinforcing structure to satisfy the 
reflector requirements.  An efficient design approach with simple load paths using 
efficient geometry will provide the best performing, most economical solution at 
the lowest mass.
Reflectors are rarely a structural load path and are primarily dynamically driv­
en; therefore, keeping the mass of the reflector low is a key contributor to keeping 
the launch loads low, the stiffness and stability up, and, if implemented intelli­
gently, controlling the costs and schedule. Less material, fewer layups, less han­
dling, less fixturing, and more robust deployment and pointing mechanisms are all 
beneficial natural consequences of minimizing mass. Keeping the launch-mass low 
is always a key goal in spaceflight design, but deliberately and carefully consider­
ing mass in every aspect of the reflector design pays off in all areas and especially 

9.3  Mechanical Design Considerations 
393
at the system level. Obviously, practical and financial limits to keeping mass to a 
minimum must not be disregarded. Too much emphasis on mass reduction can 
result in a design that is difficult and expensive to fabricate, or not structurally 
robust, or that employs higher cost or higher performing materials with little or no 
system-level benefit.
9.3.3  Stiffness
The system-level stiffness requirement for the first mode frequency of a reflector as­
sembly in the launch configuration varies depending on the size of the reflector and 
the exact program requirements. For smaller assemblies (<1m) the requirement is 
commonly that the first mode exceed 100 Hz. If the reflector first mode frequency 
exceeds 100 Hz, then it will not couple with the primary modes of the spacecraft 
and/or launch vehicle, thus simplifying the satellite coupled loads analysis. 
For certain programs, a mass versus stiffness evaluation or assessment at the 
systems level may be warranted. The trade-space might be to design a lighter, less 
complex and probably cheaper reflector that requires more analysis (inclusion in 
coupled loads) and possibly more testing, or to design a stiffer, more expensive, and 
possibly heavier reflector that is consistent with simplified and robust analysis and 
test assumptions.
For larger reflectors (approximately 1.5m to 2.5m) it is common to see a mini­
mum stiffness requirement in the range of 35 to 50 Hz (or higher) depending on 
the critical modes of the spacecraft/launch vehicle assembly. The minimum first 
mode frequency is selected to ensure that the unit is safely above and does not 
dynamically couple with any major spacecraft or launch vehicle modes. Significant 
dynamic coupling can be very difficult to predict and can produce excessively high 
load factors. A flexible body representation of a large reflector is almost always 
an important part of the coupled loads cycle for the spacecraft and launch vehicle.
Very large reflectors (>2.5m) or antenna assemblies generally cannot be mount­
ed with sufficient rigidity to the spacecraft to be safely above the spacecraft/launch 
vehicle modes. In such a case the reflector assembly may need to be tuned in stiff­
ness characteristics so as to fall between and not couple significantly with any 
of the other major spacecraft modes. When the prediction method uncertainty is 
large, it is sometimes necessary to provide tuned-stiffness features in the design, 
allowing the modal characteristics to be measured and adjusted in the flight hard­
ware at the subsystem- or system-level test phase. It should be obvious that this 
requires considerably more design and analysis effort, is particularly challenging to 
implement, and is not an attractive option.
9.3.4  Stability
The stability of the reflector’s surface shape and its pointing orientation are the 
most critical elements to the on-orbit RF performance of the antenna system. Any 
degradation of the reflector surface figure or rigid body movement of the reflector 
will impact the communications payload alignment and performance and, as such, 
must be kept to a practical minimum.
The most obvious prime drivers for on-orbit reflector stability are the tem­
peratures of and thermal gradients within the reflector structure. Two fundamental 

394 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
design areas need to be addressed: (1) reducing the temperature extremes and ther­
mal gradients by efficient thermal control and good thermal design, and (2) fabri­
cating the reflector assembly from materials with a near-zero CTE and coefficient 
of moisture expansion (CME) so that the reflector assembly is largely unaffected by 
the temperature/vacuum environment.
There are limits and practical constraints to both thermal design and the ideal 
zero-CTE structure design and fabrication. Therefore, it is important that in ad­
dition to having a low absolute value of CTE, the reflector design configuration 
should have some flexibility that allows for the RF surface shape to be as insensitive 
as possible to temperature extremes, gradients, and magnitude/variations in CTE.
Understanding that the parameters affecting the thermal distortion of a reflec­
tor go beyond those typically incorporated into a structural finite element model 
(FEM) is critical. FEM techniques using 2D plate or laminate elements may be 
valid for dynamic and stress analysis, but discount through-thickness properties. 
Neglecting the mismatch between through-thickness and in-plane properties can 
significantly influence the accuracy of a structural model used to predict thermal 
distortion. Joint design is one area that tends to perform differently than what is 
predicted in a structural model due to highly localized characteristics that are not 
accounted for in a typical FEM. It is unrealistic and insufficient to purely increase 
the amount of elements and complexity of the structural model and expect it to 
account for these factors. It is very difficult to analytically account for all pos­
sible boundary condition and material property variations, and highly theoretical 
approaches commonly under- or overpredict thermal stresses and strains. Estab­
lishing modeling techniques that are intelligently correlated to measured thermal 
distortion testing of both coupons and full reflectors is a much better, accurate, and 
reliable process; however, it is also more time consuming and can be very expensive 
to execute well.
An example of how an FEM might underpredict thermal distortion is a simple 
multilayer composite laminate cured into a 90-deg “L” shape. The laminate will 
not maintain an angle of 90 deg over temperature due to the through-thickness 
CTE being much higher than the in-plane CTE. This effect will not be accurately 
predicted by a plate or laminate FEM because of the 2D simplification of that 
type of element. Similarly, a curved sandwich structure will behave the same way 
due to the high through-thickness CTE of a typical honeycomb core. Measuring 
through-thickness laminate CTE with any accuracy is challenging, and even if a 
measurement were to be successfully completed, using that value in an FEM will 
probably not result in an accurate distortion prediction because of the detailed 
micromechanical interactions of the core, film adhesive, matrix resin, and fibers. 
A better first-order approach is to measure distortion of a simple coupon and then 
tune the specific uncertain material properties in the FEM to match the measured 
results. There are many instances like this in the construction of a reflector that 
are not modeled by the typical FEM or not modeled in a way that will accurately 
predict the thermal distortion performance of the reflector.
9.3.5  Dynamics Considerations
The primary purpose of dynamics analysis in reflectors is to predict the mechanical 
accelerations, usually dimensioned relative to the acceleration of gravity on Earth 

9.3  Mechanical Design Considerations 
395
and returned to G-loading. As a starting point, systems engineers sometimes turn to 
the satellite/launch vehicle generic mass acceleration curve (MAC), which presents 
a conservative design-level G-loading as a function of the mass of the subsystem. 
The MAC is not usually an appropriate source for G-loading of a reflector because 
the reflector’s distributed loading and very light mass make it an outlier from the 
database of all the panel-mounted components’ responses that form the basis of the 
MAC envelope. Depending on the launch configuration, MAC-loading is some­
times way too high or way too low. A combination of design experience (heritage) 
and coupled loads or base-drive systems analysis is required to develop rational 
quasi-static design loads for antenna reflectors.
In addition to G-loading, sometimes a large stiff antenna with a significant 
footprint will stiffen the satellite structure to which it is mounted, which means 
that in addition to considering G-loading of the reflector itself, the interface and 
reflector structure must be able to accommodate forces and moments from satellite 
structure modes and transfer-orbit thermal conditions.
Because the reflector structure is very lightweight and very stiff, the design 
level loads are typically quite high. Nominal G-loads of 30G to 50G are common 
and peak local responses of as high as 100G are not unusual. High G-loading can 
make designing a test to envelop and verify these loads quite challenging. Because 
of certain basic test practical limits, it is often necessary to design the reflector 
structure for the test environment, which safely envelops the stresses of the flight 
environment, rather than designing the test to envelop flight without exceeding any 
structural margins. 
9.3.6  Acoustics Considerations
The things that make a reflector design better from a performance standpoint—
larger aperture (more surface area), higher stiffness, lower mass, and so forth—are 
also those things that will make it more responsive to acoustic energy. For larger 
aperture reflectors (>1.5m) it is common for the acoustic pressure environment to 
produce the highest loads (lowest structural margins) at the reflector interfaces and 
surrounding load-bearing areas of the structure.
The acoustic spectrum is defined by the launch vehicle/satellite top-level speci­
fication, but determining the response of the reflector structure to this dynamic 
pressure loading, and then backing out load factors (G’s) with which to perform 
strength and stress analyses, can be challenging to do with any reasonable accuracy. 
Part of the challenge is that the reflector responses are different when mounted to 
the spacecraft structure than when a fixed-base or “free-free” approach is used. 
Two different philosophies of addressing the acoustic environment on reflectors 
have emerged and are discussed next. Either is valid when followed consistently.
9.3.6.1  Fixed-Base Approach
Reflectors typically exhibit higher acoustic test responses when mounted to a fixed 
base than when mounted to a satellite structure. Test data from multiple past pro­
gram indicate that the reflector assembly’s Q (dynamic response ratio) is generally 
and consistently higher in a fixed-base (test) configuration than on the satellite 
structure. In addition, a fixed-base reflector configuration will result in significant 

396 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
excitation of the out-of-plane fundamental reflector modes, which will also pro­
duce significant loading and local stresses at the support interfaces. As a result, a 
fixed-base reflector assembly-level acoustic test almost always envelops and in some 
cases overtests a reflector subsystem as compared to the final assembly-level test. 
The loading at the support interfaces is usually enveloped by the low-frequency 
reactions, and the local loading of all the discrete bonded and laminated connec­
tions is commonly enveloped by the high-frequency responses. The design engineer 
can take advantage of this envelope if the reflector can be designed to and tested to 
this boundary condition without having to resort to painfully heavy or expensive 
structural design changes. Typically, reflector designs that are very lightweight and 
have well-conceived joints without significant stress-risers can be produced with 
this conservative approach. The significant benefit of this is that the reflector-level 
acoustic test becomes an excellent screen for design and workmanship of the reflec­
tor structure. Since even the in-plane interface loads are often enveloped by this 
fixed-base acoustic testing, sine vibration, random vibration, and static or sine-
pulse testing are often not necessary.
9.3.6.2�  Free-Free Approach
Acoustic testing reflectors that are supported on a highly elastic and highly damped 
foundation, hanging from elastic cords for example, still exhibit significant high-
frequency responses, which induce representative stresses in local bond-joints and 
laminates. The first flexible-body (free-free) mode of a reflector is typically a twist­
ing-style mode, which can put significant stress on the overall rib to shell joints. Re­
sponsiveness of this twisting mode and also the many high-frequency local modes of 
a reflector structure will make a free-free acoustic test a more than adequate screen. 
If a reflector design is well tested by sine, random, and/or static (proof or sine pulse) 
tests, then a free-free acoustic environment will avoid the likely overtest situation 
of a fixed-base test. 
9.3.6.3  Reducing Acoustic Responses 
Logically, the acoustic sound pressure environment reacts against impervious or 
high stiffness surfaces more than porous or compliant surfaces. It is somewhat im­
practical to create a highly damped reflector surface; however, it is possible to create 
a surface that has enough porosity that it does not respond to acoustic pressure in 
any significant way. The fact must not be ignored, however, that a reflector laminate 
with “holes” will suffer measurable degradation in RF reflective properties as the 
RF frequency increases, but for lower RF frequency large aperture reflectors it has 
proven to be a very successful solution.
One very convenient open-weave construction solution is to use a triaxial 
weave material. Even at 2 or 3 plies thick, it still has enough open area to signifi­
cantly reduce acoustic responses while providing acceptable RF performance even 
above 10 GHz.

9.3  Mechanical Design Considerations 
397
9.3.7  Thermal Considerations
Common thinking is that any materials used in a composite structure fabrication 
should have a glass transition temperature (Tg), the temperature when the mate­
rial starts to soften, above the hot service temperature for the assembly. In reality, 
the published Tg does not define a phase change or change of state at an exact 
temperature when a polymer becomes unusable; instead, it defines the onset of 
softening. It is not uncommon for polymers, matrix resins, and adhesives to see 
use above their Tg with careful consideration of the requirements and properties at 
these temperatures. 
Modern resin systems used for spaceflight hardware fabrication are consider­
ably better than they were in the 1980s and early 1990s. Current modified epoxy 
and cyanate systems have excellent resistance to microcracking at cryogenic tem­
peratures and have a high enough Tg that it should not pose an issue for most 
requirements. However, resin properties are affected by temperature, so if there is a 
defined structural load case at a cold or hot temperature, the analysis must account 
for the actual properties of the laminate at those temperatures. As a general rule, 
the structural properties that are most affected by temperature are going to be resin 
matrix driven, such as interlaminar or flatwise characteristics, and not fiber driven, 
such as in-plane stiffness or strength. 
The design engineer must also be aware of the temperature-dependent thermal 
properties of composite laminates and bond joints. Thermal conductivity and espe­
cially heat capacity (sometimes referred to as thermal mass) vary considerably with 
temperature. For a lot of missions this can be significant when predicting tempera­
ture extremes and gradients. The heat capacity of a carbon fiber laminate will vary 
by more than an order of magnitude over the typical temperature ranges seen by a 
geostationary satellite reflector.
With careful selection, elevated-temperature curing film adhesives used for 
sandwich bonds should not pose an issue for most applications. However, film 
adhesive properties also change with temperature and in some instances this can be 
significant to the design. If the film adhesive is being used to bond materials with 
differing CTEs, such as a metallic fitting to a carbon fiber laminate, thermal strain 
will be induced that can cause local and sometimes global surface shape distortion. 
Because of the CTE mismatch between the matrix and fiber, residual strain is pres­
ent in all laminates when returning to room temperature from the cure tempera­
ture, but this influence is more pronounced in sandwich construction.
For ease of fabrication, joint and fitting bonds are commonly made with room 
temperature curing epoxies, which can be the limiting factor to the hot service tem­
perature extremes for the assembly. The Tg for room temperature epoxies should 
be carefully evaluated because many are below 100°C, which is a common design 
limit temperature for spaceflight reflectors. As explained above, a low Tg indi­
cates that the temperature-dependent properties of the adhesive and the bond joint 
should be considered relative to the loading. A design engineer should also under­
stand that manufacturer quoted service temperatures are not usually the Tg of the 
material, but the temperature when the adhesive properties drop below a certain 
shear strength. Once again, it should be noted that many designs are perform­
ing successfully in orbit even though they are experiencing temperature extremes 
beyond the Tg or recommended use temperatures of the materials used for the 

398

construction; however, this does require careful consideration of the materials per­
formance at those temperatures.
9.4  Construction Considerations
9.4.1  Design Configuration
The RF performance of the reflector is driven by the precision (shape, orientation, 
and aperture) and RF reflectivity of the reflector surface. It is the design engineer’s 
job to maintain these RF characteristics over the on-orbit environments as best as 
possible while satisfying the structural, typically launch-driven, requirements for 
the reflector.
Any reflector design will begin with the RF surface figure provided by the an­
tenna design engineer and the structural interfaces from the reflector to the satellite 
structure. For a fixed-mount reflector, the orientation (pointing) is also fixed so 
there is often little latitude in where the reflector aperture can be placed relative to 
the physical satellite structure, sensors, or other equipment that may be packaged 
close to the reflector and the launch vehicle fairing envelope. The interface loca­
tions from the reflector to the structure may or may not have much available real 
estate to attach to, and the interfacing structure may have to avoid other compo­
nents such as electronics boxes mounted to the satellite underneath the reflector. 
The reflector thermal requirements are typically focused on the temperatures for 
the reflector itself. However, other requirements are occasionally imposed, such as 
isolating the reflector thermally from the satellite bus and payload, or perhaps us­
ing the reflector aperture as additional radiator area. 
For a deployable reflector, the design team will have at least a little more lati­
tude to package the reflector since the kinematics of deploying the reflector allow 
it to be stowed relative to the satellite structure with some moderate degree of flex­
ibility. The configuration of the launch-lock and deployment mechanisms is often 
limited in physical location to whatever is convenient and available on the primary 
structure and in quantity by mass and reliability considerations.
Once the reflector surface and interfaces have been located, the goal is to pro­
vide sufficient structural support to the reflector surface at minimum mass while 
staying within the available envelope and maintaining the surface figure accuracy 
and pointing over the life of the reflector, including in the test, launch, and on-orbit 
environments. 
9.4.1.1  Sandwich
Probably the most prevalent reflector construction medium is a thin laminate-
skinned honeycomb sandwich. The front-face laminate, cured against a controlled 
surface mandrel (mold tool) provides the RF reflective surface. The sandwich con­
struction, a core with a back-face laminate, provides the required structural stabil­
ity and stiffness in a very mass-efficient manner. There are many viable choices 
for the sandwich constituents used for this type of construction. Faceskin material 
and form choices include uniaxial tape, woven fiber fabric, and triaxial fabric. The 

9.4  Construction Considerations 
399
honeycomb core material is often also a composite, either aramid or carbon fiber, 
and occasionally aluminum where the requirements allow for the higher CTE. 
The reflector shell must be structurally connected to the interface locations 
(restraint points) to provide a load path for stowed stiffness and reacting dynamic 
and acoustic loads. A convenient and efficient method for doing this is to construct 
a reinforcing sandwich rib structure “egg crate” on the rear of the reflector shell 
as shown in Figure 9.2. As well as being an efficient and cost-effective method for 
stiffening the shell, using the same sandwich construction for the shell and the ribs 
also matches the CTEs, which has advantages in managing thermal distortion.
Obviously the ribs must be structurally connected to the shell, to each other 
at the rib nodes, and to the support interfaces. Usually this attachment is achieved 
via an adhesive bond fillet. In areas of higher stress, some form of carbon fiber 
reinforcement or angle clip will often be required to increase the load-carrying 
capability of the joint. These structural connections can and will drive thermal 
distortion to some degree due to the joint having a different stiffness and CTE than 
the ribs and shell. Minimizing the distortion effects should not be overlooked in 
the detailed design of the reflector. In addition, the strength and stiffness of these 
joint designs are almost always both critical and somewhat difficult to accurately 
predict analytically. 
Once on station, the rib structure must also provide a dimensionally stable 
connection between the satellite body and the reflector RF surface, being the sole 
means of maintaining the relative pointing between the antenna system and the 
satellite. The link to the satellite body is usually realized via bolted joints for a 
fixed-mount reflector or a connection to one or more mechanisms, such as hinges 
or gimbals, for a deployed reflector. Because the rib structure is supporting the 
reflector shell, it will by default control or drive the thermal distortion of the shell 
contour. The challenge is to design the rib structure to provide a stable support 
platform to minimize thermal distortion and not drive it. 
The reflector design engineer must be aware of a couple of things about pre­
dicting thermal distortion using customary analysis tools. A typical structural 
FEM assumes uniform and constant material properties throughout the structure 
Figure 9.2  Typical egg-crate rib structure. (Copyright AASC 2012.)

400

as defined by the materials cards in the FEM. It also assumes a perfect geometry. 
The actual hardware, however, has a meaningful amount of variability in all of 
these values. As such, successful FEM analysis results are not necessarily suffi­
cient to avoid resulting significant thermal instability in the reflector itself. For in­
stance, most engineers will have been presented with the “cookie sheet in the oven” 
phenomenon. At an elevated temperature, a flat cookie sheet will suddenly warp 
into a definitively twisted alternative geometry. The facts that the cookie sheet has 
variability in geometry, materials properties, and thickness, is not perfectly flat 
to begin with, and has a low structural and geometric resistance to out-of-plane 
deformation mean that relatively small in-plane thermal strain differences resolve 
themselves as significant out-of-plane distortions. Analogous behavior can occur in 
a reflector assembly when the reflector rib structure consists solely of a tic-tac-toe 
style open-box construction. Although not necessarily shown as being required by 
the analysis, adding shear stability to the open boxes via triangulation or shear 
panel close-out is almost always a wise design choice.
9.4.1.2  Laminate/Membrane
For some reflectors it may be feasible to use a simple laminate for the reflector RF 
surface and not a sandwich. Laminate-style reflector construction has both poten­
tial advantages and challenges. 
A laminate will more than likely be more stable thermally than a sandwich 
structure because it will be easier to achieve in-plane properties very close to zero 
CTE for a laminate than for a sandwich structure. Thermal gradients, especially 
through-thickness, will also be less with a laminate compared to a sandwich, po­
tentially resulting in lower magnitudes of thermal distortion. A laminate is also po­
tentially lower mass, takes less touch labor to fabricate, uses less material (no core, 
no film adhesive, etc.), and as a result is often cheaper to fabricate than a sandwich.
A laminate shell has significantly less out-of-plane stiffness, so it will not be 
as stable structurally as a sandwich and may be susceptible to buckling or pop-
through during vibration or acoustics. Therefore, a laminate shell may require 
more ribs that are spaced closer together to adequately support the shell. Designing 
and fabricating a laminate rib structure that matches the shell properties can be 
quite challenging because the rib laminates are also more susceptible to buckling. 
If a sandwich rib structure is used to support a laminate shell, any CTE mismatch 
between the rib sandwich and the shell laminate will compromise the thermal dis­
tortion performance. 
Many laminate shell reflectors with both sandwich and laminate rib structures 
have been successfully built and launched and have proven to work very well. Once 
again it is up to the design engineer to evaluate the design space and decide on the 
best approach for satisfying the requirements of each particular program.
9.4.2  Reflector Construction Materials
9.4.2.1  Carbon Fiber
Carbon fibers have electrical conductivities that can be used to produce a reflector 
surface with very good RF performance at frequencies of less than 30 GHz and 

9.4  Construction Considerations 
401
acceptable performance up to and in some instances beyond 60 GHz. The higher 
the RF operating frequency, the more critical it is to select a high-conductivity fiber 
and carefully consider the fiber form or weave type. As a general rule of thumb, 
pitch-based fibers are more conductive than polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers of the 
same modulus, and the higher the modulus (stiffness) of the fiber, the higher the 
electrical conductivity. 
It should not be overlooked that as fiber modulus increases and the desirable 
electrical conductivity and RF performance also increase, that the fiber also be­
comes more fragile (lower strain to failure) and harder to process without caus­
ing some degree of fiber damage that weakens the laminate. Very high modulus 
fibers are also many times more expensive than lower modulus fibers and they tend 
to produce laminates with distinctly negative CTEs, which can result in thermal 
distortion instability, increase the overall thermal stresses, and induce increased 
residual strain on cooling from the cure temperature. Once again, it is the reflec­
tor design engineer who must balance RF performance against mechanical perfor­
mance and fabrication/raw material costs.
Probably the most common carbon fibers found in spaceflight reflector con­
struction are in the range of 65 to 80 msi in modulus yielding quasi-isotropic lami­
nates in the 10- to 13-msi modulus range. A quasi-isotropic layup using 70-msi 
fiber with a cured fiber volume (Fv) in the range of 54% to 60% will produce a 
near-zero, in-plane CTE laminate. Note that weaker pitch fibers are typically pre­
ferred over PAN fibers due to their better electrical and thermal conductivity. 
Fiber Orientation/Form
For a fiber-reinforced laminate reflector, the fiber is highly conductive along its 
length but poorly conductive between fibers or orthogonal to the fiber axis. Thus 
a carbon fiber laminate RF reflective surface is electrically nonisotropic. The selec­
tion and form of the carbon fiber used for the reflector surface construction must 
be carefully considered, because the type and orientation of the carbon fibers in 
the reflector surface will usually have a pronounced effect on the RF performance. 
Unidirectional Material
Because the RF reflective property of a carbon fiber reflector is provided by the fiber 
encapsulated within the resin of the laminate, a reflector shell constructed from uni­
directional material will naturally have a distinct polarizing effect on the RF energy 
hitting it. This is due to a combination of effects, but primarily it is a result of the 
conductivity of the unidirectional laminate being orders of magnitude higher in the 
fiber direction than in the transverse direction. The result may be an unacceptably 
high level of cross-polarization degradation in RF performance. Unidirectional fiber 
laminate reflectors have an extensive spaceflight heritage and can work very well if 
the RF characteristics of the laminate are understood and accounted for. Figure 9.3 
shows a reflector laminate manufactured with unidirectional material.
Woven Material
Woven forms of carbon fiber (fabrics) are often used for antenna reflectors because 
they are easier to form to the compound curvature and shaping of the typical reflec­
tor surface than unidirectional materials. The woven form of the fiber presents a

less dramatic difference in directional conductivity to the RF energy impinging on 
the reflector surface. However, the fibers in a woven fabric also appear discontinu­
ous to the RF energy so the fabric weave must be carefully selected with the RF 
requirements of the reflector in mind. 
Fabric that is easier to form, such as a satin weave (as shown in Figure 9.4), 
typically has a greater effect on RF depolarization than a plain weave due to the 
somewhat directional properties of the surface fibers. However, a satin weave will 
typically have a higher RF conductivity than a similar plain weave because it ap­
pears less discontinuous to the RF field. Once again it is important to consider all 
aspects of the design space when selecting material fiber type and form.
Coarseness/Thickness of the Weave (Surface Roughness)
Even though a laminate reflector surface may appear to be quite smooth, the electri­
cally conductive medium is the carbon fiber and not the resin matrix, and it is the 
nonconductive resin that provides the smooth surface contour. As the fiber bundles

(tows) alternate over and under each other in the weave, they effectively create a 
rough surface than can be equated to a degradation in surface figure roughness, 
sometimes defined by the local surface rms (root-mean-square variation across a 
very fine grid of points). The roughness orthogonal to the fiber direction and the 
amount of tows per inch also create RF performance irregularities that can be equil­
ibrated to surface roughness. The coarseness (weave density) and thickness of the 
fabric weave become more and more critical as RF frequencies increase (wavelength 
decreases). A thinner, finer weave will result in a smoother electrical surface and 
will provide measurable improvements in RF performance as frequencies increase. 
The design engineer must consider the exact requirements of the reflector in choos­
ing materials since at lower frequencies a coarser and thicker material is likely to be 
more economical and may provide perfectly acceptable RF performance.
Because the matrix resin is a dielectric, the resin will have an effect on RF 
performance if the reflector surface is resin rich with the open areas of the weave 
being filled with resin. The dielectric constant and loss tangent of the resin system 
may be important for a carbon fiber reflector but will definitely be influential for 
a dual-surface (dielectric) reflector structure. Again, the reflector design team must 
account for the dielectric effect, but for most single-surface reflector applications it 
is not a significant driver of RF performance. 
Density of the Weave (Gaps)
One way of obtaining very good mechanical properties from a woven material is 
to mimic unidirectional material with thin and flat tows but in a woven form. This 
is commonly known as a spread fabric and is so called because after weaving, the 
tows (fiber bundles) in the material are spread to a flat form that yields a weave 
with little or no open space (porosity). In addition to less porosity, the spread fabric 
is smoother and thinner than an unspread weave and thus provides measurably 
better RF surface roughness and improved RF performance at higher frequencies. 
Figure 9.5 shows an example of spread fabric plain weave reflector.

Triaxial Weaves
Triaxial weave material has been and is still quite commonly used for antenna re­
flectors. A triaxial woven material, often referred to as triax, has a three-direction 
(triaxial) weave rather than the common two-direction biaxial (orthogonal) woven 
fabrics. There are mechanical advantages to the triaxial form of the material, but 
there are also RF disadvantages. 
A triaxial weave is typically less dense (more porous) and thicker than an 
equivalent areal weight biaxial weave, which can measurably degrade the electrical 
performance at higher RF frequencies. Triax does, however, have some desirable 
mechanical advantages in that a single ply is extremely close to quasi-isotropic so 
the number of plies can be very small; in fact, a single ply is often adequate. A lami­
nate constructed with very few open-weave plies results in a porous laminate struc­
ture that is not responsive to acoustic energy; this can significantly reduce loads on 
larger aperture (surface area) reflectors. Figure 9.6 shows a reflector surface with 
triaxial weave construction.
Note that due to the naturally high in-plane shear stiffness of the triangular 
weave, triaxial materials do not form as readily to curved or shaped surfaces as do 
biaxial materials.
Laminate Matrix
The customary laminate matrix material is an elevated temperature cured resin 
polymer, usually a modified epoxy or cyanate, specifically formulated to work with 
the desired fiber in the thermal and deep space radiation environment. There are a 
relatively small number of space-qualified resin systems with heritage in spaceflight 
reflector construction that possess acceptable radiation resistance and exhibit very 
good structural integrity over the wide temperature ranges experienced. Almost all 
resins available today are blends or hybrids of various elements that add toughness, 
strength, stability, radiation resistance, and so forth.
The matrix resin has a distinct set of properties that must be considered in the 
design and manufacture of the reflector laminates, sandwiches, and assemblies. 
Most obviously, the resin is an electrically nonconductive polymer and it is also 
an extremely good thermal isolator. The resin has a much lower modulus than the 
carbon fiber, but a CTE that can be orders of magnitude higher. The resin will also

9.4  Construction Considerations

exhibit a change in volume relative to ambient humidity, known as the coefficient 
of moisture expansion (CME).
Filled Matrix Resins
Current development activities are evaluating the addition of nanofiber and/or 
particle fillers to resin matrices to improve the less desirable resin properties. For 
example, carbon fillers can increase conductivity, lower CTE, lower CME, reduce 
resin shrinkage, and increase resin modulus. Of course, almost all benefits come 
with compromise; the fillers can have some nondesirable effects such as reducing 
toughness, and as a result may affect certain laminate properties. These specialized 
resins definitely deserve consideration and will likely become more common in the 
future if only for specialized applications that can take full advantage of the specific 
customized properties.
Low-Moisture Matrix Resins
All polymer resin matrices possess varying degrees of affinity for moisture and 
as such they will expand according to the increasing humidity of the surround­
ing environment. Of the most common resin systems, epoxies possess the highest 
CMEs, whereas the CMEs of cyanate esters are measurably less and the CMEs 
of the somewhat-specialized cyanate siloxanes are very low. These three types are 
broad categories of resins and within each there are specific resin formulations that 
have measurably lower CMEs than others.
For a conventional laminate, cured under vacuum in an oven or autoclave, the 
cured resin will be at its zero-stress state at the cure temperature (or thereabouts) 
and zero humidity. As the resin reabsorbs moisture in the ambient environment, 
the resin will expand and impart micromechanical stresses into the laminate. Con­
versely after launch, the resins will dry out and shrink. The hygroscopic effects on 
most reflector assemblies are measurable and may be of a magnitude that makes 
CME a design consideration; this is especially true with dual-surface reflectors.
9.4.2.2  Dual-Surface Reflector Materials
Certain reflector designs require one or more of the reflector shells to be RF trans­
parent or transmissive to certain RF polarizations or frequencies and highly reflec­
tive to others. This adds additional RF requirements beyond reflectivity, and results 
in a new set of mechanical challenges due to the introduction of another subset of 
materials with their own distinct properties and characteristics.
RF Circuitry
For RF transmissive reflectors the RF conductive surface of the reflector is a discrete 
pattern of conductive elements that may be a linear polarization grid, or a resonant 
element pattern such as a ring or other types of RF features such as dipoles. These 
features are almost always required to be highly conductive, so the design engineer 
has to decide on the best materials, form, and fabrication techniques to satisfy the 
additional RF requirements while maintaining the typical mechanical and thermo­
elastic requirements. RF reflective (conductive) features on reflectors have success­
fully used copper, aluminum, and carbon fiber elements. There is always a size and 

406 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
often a positional dimensional tolerance that is required with the RF elements that 
will limit the possible approaches to achieving the feature pattern accurately on the 
completed reflector shell. There have been a wide variety of successful construction 
and fabrication methods for applying the RF features that have been qualified and 
all have associated specific challenges or compromises. An example of an RF trans­
missive aramid fiber laminate subreflector constructed using frequency selective 
material is shown in Figure 9.7.
RF Transmissive Materials
Once the RF element design has been established, it will need a substrate (reflec­
tor shell) to accurately position the element in the antenna system. In addition to 
providing the required stiffness, strength, and thermoelastic stability, the substrate 
must incur the minimum possible impact on the RF energy passing through the re­
flector shell. It is easier to think of the reflector shell in this case as a radome, which 
is designed to have the lowest possible impact on the RF performance as possible.
As a starting point if the design engineer considers typical radome materials he 
or she is presented with glass fiber, quartz fiber, aramid fibers (KevlarR), and other 
more specialized options such as ceramics and poly-p-phenylenebenzobisoxazole 
(PBO or ZylonR). Assuming that the same structural considerations are made as 
for a solid-surface carbon fiber shell reflector, a reasonable starting point is to di­
rectly replace the carbon fiber of the solid surface design with the dielectric fibers 
required for the transmissive design. This is a very good starting point but results 
in very distinct structural differences that must be considered:
••
Stiffness: The typical dielectric fiber has a modulus that is less than half that 
of the commonly used carbon fiber, reducing the critical structural stiffness 
characteristics of the reflector assembly. Increasing the core thickness and

9.5  Manufacturing Considerations 
407
the number of supporting ribs begins to address the issue for the assembly; 
however, the resulting effects on RF performance must also be considered. A 
thicker reflector shell and more ribs, which will also need to be RF transmis­
sive, will almost certainly result in measurable degradation to the reflector 
RF performance. 
••
CTE: The lower modulus of the dielectric fiber also makes designing a ther­
mally stable structure much more challenging because the laminate is in­
fluenced to a greater degree by the high positive CTE of the resin matrix 
materials and adhesives used for assembly of ribs and so forth. This, com­
bined with the fact that common fibers such as glass and quartz have dis­
tinctly positive CTEs, results in a structure with anything but a zero CTE 
making a design that has low thermal distortion very challenging. This does 
present a challenge to the design engineer, but note that some very clever pro­
prietary solutions to minimizing the critical out-of-plane distortions while 
allowing significantly higher in-plane dimensional changes have been quali­
fied and flown.
••
CME: For reasons similar to those for the increase in CTE (lower fiber mod­
ulus), CME is also going to be higher for a dielectric fiber laminate because 
the fiber has less influence over the higher CME resin matrix. In the case of 
an aramid fiber where the fiber itself has a measurable CME, the resulting 
shell moisture shrinkage can be even more significant.
••
Thermal and radiation effects: Most of these dielectric fibers also have in­
creased susceptibility to the on-orbit radiation environment and also to large 
numbers of thermal cycles. These factors must be recognized and accounted 
for, but will be easier to manage if the reflector assembly has thermal control 
that covers the critical material surfaces. 
9.5  Manufacturing Considerations
9.5.1  Mold Tooling
The reflector surface mold tool is logically the most critical piece of tooling in the 
reflector fabrication process because it ultimately governs the surface figure (RF 
prescription) and accuracy of the flight reflector. There are relatively few well-estab­
lished tooling materials and fundamental designs used for the majority of composite 
reflector fabrication. 
9.5.2  Mold Tool Surface Accuracy
Surface figure, the geometric fit of the as-built surface to the ideal surface, is the 
primary requirement for a reflector mold tool. The specified reflector accuracy ul­
timately dictates the mold construction, materials, and machining and finishing 
techniques that will be required. Tools with optical mirror-type surface accuracies 
can be produced but are almost always too time consuming and costly for a com­

408 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
munications antenna reflector so it is up to the design engineer to evaluate the avail­
able options and select the one that best suits the current set of requirements.
The as-delivered room temperature accuracy of the mold tool is only one as­
pect of realizing a successful design. Because the reflector shell laminate or sand­
wich shape will be formed at the laminate cure temperature, the tooling should 
also match the reflector laminate or sandwich CTE or may need to have the surface 
figure thermally compensated to the cure temperature.
9.5.2.1  Machining Accuracy
The practical machining accuracy that can be achieved is dependent on size, tool 
design (rigidity), and machine tool accuracy. It is quite possible to cut a tool surface 
to a profile accuracy of a few thousandths of an inch or less on smaller tools using 
a gantry milling machine yielding a surface rms of less than 1 mil on smaller tools 
(<30 in.) and 2 mils on tools up to around 90 in. Tools of 120 in. or more in diam­
eter have been produced with surface accuracies of less than 0.0015 in. with ad­
ditional time spent to finesse the surface by repeated measurement and handwork.
9.5.2.2  Postmachining Operations (Benching)
The most common technique used for machining contoured surface tools is to use 
a ball end or radiused-type milling cutter and “raster” the required surface on 
a five-axis CNC milling machine. This process leaves a machined surface with a 
washboard-type ridged surface. With the correct choice of cutter radius and path 
spacing, the depth of the resulting ridges can be very small, often less than 1 mil.
Once the machining of the surface has been completed, the surface must be 
hand finished to remove the peaks of the ridges down to the same level as the val­
leys. This finishing step, often called benching, levels the surface to the low spots 
of the troughs, which were controlled during machining to the desired surface con­
tour. Figure 9.8 shows the photograph of a machined tool during the benching 
process.
The skill required to perform this task is relatively high, but by using shop aids 
such as machinist’s blue dye and a semistiff sanding tool to bridge the ridges, an

9.5  Manufacturing Considerations 
409
experienced technician can efficiently produce a very smooth and accurate finished 
tool surface.
9.5.2.3  Measurement Limitations
Surface contour inspection measurements of a very large and heavy mold tool can 
be somewhat challenging. Often it is not practical to move the tool onto a coor­
dinate measuring machine or similar fixed inspection station, so the tool must be 
measured in situ. Inspecting the tool using the machine used for creating the tool 
is acceptable as a first-order inspection, but it does not isolate any errors present 
in the machine itself and is rarely used to accept the final tool contour. The tool is 
typically much better supported on the bed of the machine than it is in service, so 
gravity distortion (sag) effects may not be accurately assessed with a measurement 
on the machine. Ideally the tool should be inspected in the configuration in which it 
will be used, typically on an autoclave cart or perhaps a cure table for smaller tools. 
Remote dimensional inspection methods for tooling are quite common such 
as a laser tracker, Romer™ arm, and occasionally photogrammetry. The measure­
ment accuracy limitations of these methods must be considered and evaluated by 
the design engineer. The dimensional accuracy of both photogrammetry and laser 
tracker methods is largely driven by angular resolutions, so dimensional accuracy 
decreases as the measurement distance increases. As a rule of thumb, single-point 
measurement accuracies of better than 0.001 in. even on smaller parts should not 
be expected without special consideration for the setup, measurement technique, 
and data processing.
9.5.2.4  1G Effects
Mold tools can be very heavy. Steel, Invar, or bulk graphite tools for 2.5m reflectors 
can weigh 10,000 lb or more. Heavy tools maintain their surface contour during 
machining because they are well supported on the machine bed. However, once the 
tool is moved off the machine, it will distort to some degree, degrading the surface 
figure accuracy. To ensure that the tool maintains its accuracy during layup, curing, 
and assembly operations, the structural design and in-use support of the tool must 
be carefully engineered. If in-house experience in tool design is not available, then 
contracting a tool designer or manufacturer that has design and analysis capability 
may be the best or only option.
9.5.2.5  Stability During Curing/Assembly
As the contour of the reflector composite laminate/sandwich is established at the 
cure temperature of the resin system/adhesive, it is important to understand the 
surface figure of the mold tool at the cure temperature. The CTE of the tool ma­
terial obviously has a profound effect, but the difference between the CTE of the 
part being cured and the tool must also be addressed.  Ideally the tool and the part 
should have close to the same CTE. If the tool and part CTEs match and the tool 
has the desired contour at room temperature, so will the part, because they will 
both expand and contract at the same rate.

410 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
It is possible and not uncommon to design a tool out of a more economical, 
higher CTE material by thermally compensating the tool contour such that when 
the composite part cools back to room temperature it has the desired contour. This 
technique is very common for making composite tubes where it is desirable to have 
the tool shrink more than the part so that the part will slide off the tool after curing. 
Depending on the final accuracy requirement for the reflector and whether 
the tool is to be used for multiple cures, the stability of the tool contour may also 
be very important. Conditioning the tool through a few temperature (cure) cycles 
before final machining to allow for any stress relief or relaxation to occur can be 
critical to the long-term stability of the tool contour. 
9.5.3  Mold Tool Design Considerations
9.5.3.1  Size/Mass
As layup curing tools become larger in size, the mass of the tool and its carrier or 
cart becomes more and more important to consider. The greater the mass of the 
tool, the longer it will take to heat up and cool down during the cure cycle. Thicker 
sections of the tool will also tend to heat up more slowly than thinner sections, 
which can cause uneven curing and warping of the part. In a simplistic way this can 
be compared to how a potato chip cooks from the outside edge toward the center, 
causing it to warp. The logistics of moving the tool around the facility must also be 
considered. The load-bearing capacity of the flooring, ramps, or steps in the path 
from the layup room to the autoclave, installing the tool into the autoclave, and 
the capacity of the rails in the autoclave may have a distinct influence on the final 
tooling design and tool material choice. 
9.5.3.2  Cost
The cost of the completed tool is driven by size, required accuracy, choice of raw 
material, and complexity of fabricating the tool. The relative price of different tool­
ing approaches also varies as the size increases. For a very small tool, a machined 
Invar configuration may actually be the most economical because it can be pro­
cessed from a billet of raw material with only NC programming and machining 
costs. However, a larger Invar tool will be on the high end of the price scale, because 
it requires forming of various individual pieces of Invar plate, welding, and heat 
treating steps before it even reaches the five-axis NC mill for contouring. 
9.5.3.3  Tooling Features
Both the reflector mold tool and the reflector shell produced from the tool will re­
quire some form of physical reference to establish the base reflector coordinate sys­
tem to facilitate accurate assembly and alignment. These features can be accurately 
located and machined as features on the tool during machining and then transferred 
to the composite shell during or after cure. Locating holes or pins in the tool and 
bosses or inserts in the reflector shell are simple and effective at establishing the 
nominal reflector shell coordinate system for assembly.

9.5  Manufacturing Considerations 
411
In some instances it is both convenient and efficient to assemble the reflector 
face down on the mold tool, in which case incorporating features that the locate 
backing structure and interfaces into the tool should be considered. 
9.5.4  Mold Tool Material Options
Over the years many mold tool materials have been used including wood, plaster, 
and other readily machinable options that are relatively stable and will survive the 
required curing temperatures. However, the industry has largely evolved to the ba­
sic tool material options discussed next.
9.5.4.1  Metallic Tools
Invar 36
Invar is a high nickel content steel that is available in many different alloys, each 
possessing specific properties. The lowest CTE formulation of Invar commercially 
available is Invar 36 (36% nickel) and it is the most commonly used type for reflec­
tor mold tools. Approximately the same density as steel, large Invar tools usually 
have the front surface formed and welded to an open rib style backing structure, 
heat treated to relieve welding stresses, and then machined. Depending on the size, 
Invar 36 mold tools are often comparable in cost to bulk graphite, they are lighter 
weight, and they possess relatively good thermal conductivity and a very low CTE 
comparable in magnitude to bulk graphite. The lower mass and relatively uniform 
thickness of a fabricated Invar tool can have distinct advantages for certain high-
accuracy reflector applications due to the ability to far better control tool heating 
during the cure cycle. An Invar reflector mold tool is shown in Figure 9.9.
Figure 9.9   Invar reflector mold tool. (Copyright AASC 2012.)

412 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
Steel
Steel tooling is quite commonly used for glass fiber or quartz fiber laminates and 
sandwiches that have a CTE similar to that of steel, or for assemblies that do not 
require a highly accurate surface contour. Steel mold tools (see Figure 9.10) are 
more economical than Invar due to the lower materials costs, lighter weight than 
bulk graphite, good thermal conductivity, and lower CTE than aluminum.
Aluminum
Aluminum is rarely used as an elevated temperature cure reflector shell mold tool 
due to its high CTE. However, it is commonly used for tube mold tools or assembly 
tooling due to its light weight and relatively economical fabrication costs.
9.5.4.2  Composite
The composite tooling description covers a wide range of tooling configurations: 
castings, simple laminates, supported laminates, sandwich structures, shell and 
core, and many more including hybrids. Simple composite tools (skin and core) are 
probably going to have accuracies and CTEs that are larger than those required for 
a precision reflector fabrication; however, they may be viable for lower accuracy 
requirement parts. They are also likely to have temperature limitations constraining 
their use to room or lower temperature cures.
Many years ago fabricated composite tooling was used for the construction of 
many high-accuracy reflectors (see Figure 9.11). Composite tooling was (and is) 
potentially the most accurate medium because the tool construction and materi­
als can be designed to mimic the part being cured on it for a near-perfect match 
in CTE and thermal properties. The challenge is how to assemble the tool surface 
to the stiffening structure required to support it while maintaining good struc­
tural joint integrity at typical cure temperatures and pressures. Room-temperature 
epoxies would be a logical and convenient choice for a rib-supported structure; 
however, they have service temperature limitations that may preclude their use.

9.5  Manufacturing Considerations 
413
The unfortunate result is that fabricating high-accuracy composite tools like this 
becomes as challenging as the flight reflector and as a result they have lost favor to 
bulk graphite and Invar.
There have been recent developments in tools constructed from a carbon core 
with a machinable carbon molding compound skin. The core is rough machined 
undersize to accommodate the molding compound thickness. The compound is 
then applied to the core and the tool assembly cured, resulting in a blank that may 
be within a few tenths of an inch of the final contour. Once the tooling blank has 
been created, it is then machined like a typical bulk graphite tool, then benched and 
sealed. To this point tool to part replication accuracies have not been quite as good 
as equivalent bulk graphite or Invar tools; however, as the technology matures this 
type of tooling design may become a very attractive option, especially for large 
tools where weight and thermal mass become significant challenges.
9.5.4.3  Bulk Graphite
Bulk graphite tools are constructed from amorphous sintered graphite blocks ma­
chined and bonded together to form a tooling blank large enough to fit the desired 
shape. Once bonded together, the blocks are CNC machined, hand finished, and 
sealed to produce a vacuum-tight tool surface. The processes, adhesives, and seal­
ers are very specialized and use competition-sensitive formulations.  As such, there 
are relatively few tooling houses that can successfully produce bulk graphite tool­
ing. Machining bulk graphite is also a very dirty and hazardous process due to the 
graphite dust that is created. Bulk graphite does have a very low CTE, comparable 
to that of Invar; however, the CTE can be slightly directional. For larger tools re­
quiring extreme cure accuracies, the slightly positive and directional bias of the bulk 
graphite thermal expansion should be considered in the tool design. Figure 9.12 
shows an example of a bulk graphite mold for shaped reflectors.
Bulk graphite tools are often comparable in cost to Invar depending on the size 
(and volume). Larger bulk graphite tools tend to be more massive than Invar due 
to the bulk volume of material involved compared to the thinner Invar weldment-
type construction. The thermal conductivity of bulk graphite is acceptable, but the

mass makes heating very large tools at a rapid enough rate somewhat challenging. 
Imbedding electrical heaters in the bulk graphite tool may be necessary in some 
instances.
9.5.5  Composite Fabrication Equipment Requirements
9.5.5.1  Processing
Composite spaceflight hardware processing requires a controlled clean area with 
temperature and humidity monitoring, if not controls. Environmental controls 
are critical for all layup activities (uncured materials) and generally important 
for assembly activities unless the hardware is easily and thoroughly cleaned once 
completed.
Contamination Control
Contamination control is critical at all times while processing composite hardware. 
Mold release operations must be performed in a separate room that has a com­
pletely stand-alone and separate air handling system. It is preferred that mold re­
leases be wiped on rather than sprayed to avoid inadvertent direct or secondary 
contamination of flight hardware. Uncured mold release on clothing, gloves, shoes, 
tools, or shop aids must be very carefully controlled. 
Many bond failures have been attributed to contamination of the bond surfac­
es with mold release, fingerprints, oils from compressed air sources, and so forth. 
Thorough abrading and cleaning of faying surfaces before bonding will remove 
most contaminates, but not silicones. As a rule, free or uncured silicones should 
be isolated from any composite hardware fabrication activities. Silicone-based 
painting, room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) bonding for optical solar reflectors 
(OSRs) or solar cells, or similar specialized activities must be carefully planned and 
separated from composite structure and bonding activities. It is common practice 
for a water-break test to be performed on critical bond surfaces before adhesive 
application to verify that there is no surface contamination that would prevent a 
successful structural bond. 
Figure 9.12  Bulk graphite shaped reflector mold tool.

9.5  Manufacturing Considerations 
415
For reflectors with dielectric shells, contamination of ribs or other RF trans­
missive components from conductive materials such as metal shavings and even 
carbon fiber or carbon dust must also be eliminated or at the least very carefully 
controlled. Conductive inclusions in an RF transmissive reflector shell or structure 
can result in devastating impacts to the RF performance especially from passive 
intermodulation (PIM). It most instances it is required that all layups be performed 
in an area that is not used for any conductive materials processing such as carbon 
fiber layups or processing or metal bonding and it is preferred that all assembly 
bonding operations be handled in an area with similar requirements. For the fab­
rication of some reflectors with particular sensitivity to PIM, it is not unusual to 
require that the machine used for running the pre-preg either be a dedicated non­
carbon machine or that it be scrupulously cleaned before the dielectric pre-preg is 
run through it. 
Laminates
Due to the harsh environment and temperatures involved, virtually all spaceflight 
reflector hardware uses elevated temperature curing resins systems for laminate and 
sandwich structures. The rigorous structural requirements of a spaceflight antenna 
dictate that autoclave curing is more often required than oven curing because it pro­
duces a higher quality part. Autoclave-cured laminates will have better ply consoli­
dation, lower void content, and, as a result, more consistent and better mechanical 
properties than similar oven-cured laminates. Figure 9.13 shows a 16-ft × 30-ft au­
toclave facility at the AASC facility in Stockton, California. As noted earlier, layups 
will virtually always have a requirement to be performed in a controlled clean area 
with temperature and humidity control. The design engineer should also be aware 
of the susceptibility of certain materials and processes to the presence of moisture 
and solvents that can affect the curing chemistry and result in compromised lami­
nates. Note that a white powdery residue or caste on the surface of a cured laminate 
is often a sign of a potentially serious cure issue.

Sandwiches
Sandwich bonds can be satisfactorily made using an oven because the pressures 
involved (commonly vacuum only) are considerably less than those used for a lami­
nate cure. Also the heat-up rate is less critical for a sandwich bond. It is custom­
ary to perform sandwich bond layups in a controlled clean area with temperature 
and humidity control. Also remember that sandwich structures should be vented 
to allow for pressure equalization during launch ascent. Aluminum cores can be 
purchased already perforated, but composite core materials are not usually vented 
and this must be accounted for in the design or addressed by adding vent paths to 
the core.
Assemblies
Other than the specialized equipment and facilities required for processing lami­
nates and sandwiches and performing end item inspections and alignments, there 
is relatively little in the way of expensive equipment that is required for assembly 
of the reflector. A well-designed and manufactured set of tooling to locate critical 
structural elements and interfaces and common hand tools and shop aids will be 
adequate in almost all instances. As is always the case for spaceflight hardware, it 
is customary to perform assembly operations in a clean area that is monitored for 
temperature and humidity control.
9.5.5.2  Surface Measurement
Inspection of the reflector surface figure and alignment against the program speci­
fications is a key requirement and a critical measurement step. The industry has 
largely gravitated to one of three methods: coordinate measuring machine (CMM), 
laser tracker, or digital photogrammetry. Other techniques, including hybrids of 
these methods, are constantly being developed, but as of this writing they have ei­
ther not achieved the accuracy or repeatability required for most spaceflight reflec­
tor inspections or they are too expensive or not practical for the types of alignments 
and inspections typically needed in the fabrication and inspection of a spaceflight 
reflector. 
Laser Tracker
A laser tracker is a very convenient portable measurement system that uses a laser 
beam to accurately measure a target placed on the part being inspected. The target 
usually used for laser tracker measurements is called an spherically mounted ret­
roreflector (SMR) and consists of three mirrored faces representing the sides of the 
corner of a cube with the apex being located exactly at the center of a sphere. Any 
light ray that enters the reflector portion of the SMR will be reflected back to the 
source along a path that is equivalent to the distance from the laser tracker head to 
the center of the sphere and back to the laser tracker. The laser tracker calculates 
the location of the SMR by angular encoders in the laser tracker head and distance 
(flight time and phase differential) to the SMR and back. Laser tracker ranging is 
extremely accurate and consistent over long distances; however, the azimuth and el­
evation accuracy of the laser tracker does degrade with distance due to the accuracy 
of the digital encoders resolving the pointing angles. A good laser tracker operator 

9.5  Manufacturing Considerations 
417
will carefully set up the inspection measurement to minimize the limitations of the 
angular encoder accuracy. 
Laser tracker measurement (see Figure 9.14) is a contacting measurement, and 
data capture occurs over a period of time so this must be accounted for. If the part 
being measured can be measurably deflected by contact pressure of the SMR or is 
not rigidly mounted relative to the laser tracker head for inspection, it will be very 
difficult if not impossible to perform an accurate inspection. 
Photogrammetry
Photogrammetry is the process of determining the positions of features from mul­
tiple photographic images. It should be immediately apparent that this method is 
noncontacting and instantaneous, eliminating two of the challenges of laser tracker 
measurement. It is critical for each image (photograph) to contain a known scale 
and for a series of images to be taken that provides a wide range of viewing angles 
of the part being inspected. The accuracy of the measurement will also increase 
relative to the number of images used in the measurement data set. Measurement 
resolutions of 0.001 in. or slightly better can be achieved at close distances with a 
well-thought-out measurement setup; however, as with the laser tracker measure­
ment method, the accuracy decreases with distance in this case primarily due to the 
resolution of the charge-coupled device sensor and optics in the camera.
For spaceflight hardware inspection the features being “measured” in each 
photograph are typically retroreflective targets consisting of a small accurately cut 
circular piece of higher reflective material with a self-adhesive backing. “Targets” 
can be a variety of sizes from less than 0.1 in. in diameter to 0.25 in. in diameter or 
more. For a reflector inspection the surface would be populated with a distribution 
of targets at a spacing and density designed to provide a good characterization of 
the surface being inspected. In addition, retroreflective targets would be placed at 
the reflector interfaces and known tooling locations on the reflector shell surface to 
establish the nominal coordinate system.

Photogrammetry also lends itself to taking measurements in different environ­
ments such as in vacuum or at temperature to establish the thermoelastic perfor­
mance of a reflector assembly. There are obviously significant challenges in per­
forming the measurements and performing them accurately, but nonetheless there 
are companies (albeit limited) that have established accurate techniques for per­
forming these measurements. A photogrammetry measurement setup is illustrated 
in Figure 9.15.
9.5.5.3  Alignment
Proper alignment of the reflector at the antenna subsystem level to the feed and 
spacecraft coordinate system requires knowledge of the reflector surface figure and 
its orientation and location relative to the boresight of the antenna subsystem. To 
establish this alignment, certain tooling references on the reflector are extremely 
useful to avoid having to remeasure the reflector surface for each alignment step. 
Tooling hole (or similar) features established from the mold tool provide easily 
measured locational references for the reflector alignment. Optical cube(s) may also 
be useful for measuring and characterizing the fixed antenna or deployed reflector 
angles (pointing) relative to the satellite master reference cube and also to check 
deployment angles and deployment repeatability.
9.6  Mechanical and Environmental Testing
Risk reduction testing occurs at all levels of the fabrication and assembly of a reflec­
tor, not just on the completed assembly. Integrating deficient material or an out-of-
specification component into a reflector assembly that is not identified until the end 
item is tested would be devastating to the program schedule and budget.

9.6  Mechanical and Environmental Testing 
419
9.6.1  Fabrication In-Process Testing
Due to the schedule, time, and material investment in a reflector assembly, it makes 
sense to screen the materials, processes, and subassemblies throughout the fabrica­
tion process to capture issues as early as possible. 
9.6.1.1  Material Acceptance and In-Process Testing
All of the constituent materials used for a composite assembly should be screened as 
part of an incoming receiving test to ensure that they meet minimum requirements 
before being used for hardware fabrication. Material acceptance testing establishes 
that the purchased materials are compliant with their respective specifications. 
Even though the laminate fiber and matrix properties will have been confirmed 
via material acceptance testing, it is still necessary to validate the production pro­
cess variables. It is especially critical to perform in-process testing to confirm that 
the flight laminate layup matches the drawing and has been processed to the pre­
scribed cure cycle and that the fiber volume and void content are within drawing 
tolerance. Sandwich bonds are customarily checked by performing in-process de­
structive testing by flatwise tension testing of an offcut or tag end of the sandwich. 
The integrity of sandwich bonds can also be checked by nondestructive evaluation, 
often through-transmission ultrasonic testing (see below).
Due to the specific geometry of reflectors, room-temperature bonds for fittings 
and ribs often cannot be reasonably proof loaded except at assembly-level environ­
mental testing. Therefore, it is especially critical to check that the bond surfaces 
have been prepared correctly, often by means of the water-break test. In addition, 
inspectors must verify that the adhesive has been applied correctly by visual inspec­
tion and that the adhesive has been mixed and cured correctly by performing a 
hardness test on a sample of the adhesive, often called a “hockey puck.”
9.6.1.2  Nondestructive Testing
In many instances it makes sense to perform a level of nondestructive testing (NDT) 
or nondestructive evaluation (NDE) during the fabrication of the assembly to iden­
tify and isolate any structural integrity issues before considerable time and effort 
have been invested in the hardware. Common NDE techniques in use for spaceflight 
hardware are coin tap and ultrasonic inspection including the use of through-trans­
mission ultrasonic (TTU) scanning. Although it may sound crude, an experienced 
operator can identify extremely small flaws with a simple coin tap (nickel) test. 
Most automated TTU scanners are designed for scanning flat panels and can 
usually only scan in the X,Y-plane (not Z). This means that a reflector shell sand­
wich that is not within a few inches of being flat presents a significant challenge 
when performing an automated TTU scan, requiring either an automated Z-axis 
capability or that the surface be scanned in smaller area segments that do meet the 
flatness deviation requirement. Figure 9.16 shows a TTU air scanner setup for a 
sandwich cylinder.

9.6.2  Reflector Assembly Acceptance and Environmental Testing
Any spaceflight component must undergo rigorous ground testing before launch to 
ensure that it will survive the launch environment and satisfactorily meet all design 
requirements once on station. Although a satellite reflector is primarily an electrical 
payload component, it is a passive device and its mechanical testing is similar to 
that of a lightweight structural component such as a solar array substrate. There­
fore, the customary testing is very different that that for an electrical component 
and tailored somewhat differently to a typical structural component. 
The preferred and customary order of reflector-level environmental testing is 
as follows:
••
Dimensional inspection: This is the baseline surface figure and interface lo­
cation inspection that will used as the “before” comparison standard. This 
inspection is repeated as an intermediate or post-test inspection as part of the 
test success criteria to establish that the structural integrity of the reflector 
has not been compromised.
••
Low amplitude sine signature/modal: For some larger reflectors or reflectors 
with specific structural requirements, it may make sense to establish a base­
line for the modal signature characteristics of the reflector before any testing 
is performed. The signature can be repeated as an intermediate or post-test 
inspection as part of the test success criteria to establish that the structural 
integrity of the reflector has not been compromised.
••
Thermal cycle: This test is extremely effective at screening out bad laminates, 
bonds, or bond prep that may not have been caught by in-process testing or 
NDE. 
••
Thermal distortion: The thermal distortion test is really only placed here in 
the flow sequence out of convenience because it can be combined with the 
thermal cycling test to save setup and test time. Thermal distortion testing

9.6  Mechanical and Environmental Testing 
421
can be performed at any point in the test sequence and in some instances it 
may be warranted to measure thermal distortion at a lower level of assembly, 
say for a subreflector, that cannot be surveyed well at the assembly level.
••
Static proof load: For some larger reflectors or reflectors with specific struc­
tural requirements, it may be appropriate to perform a static proof load test 
of certain interfaces if possible. Note, however, that reacting the applied load 
often makes a static load test impractical.
••
Sine vibration/sine pulse: The intent of this test is to excite the reflector at the 
lower frequencies (<100 Hz) to quasi-statically load the reflector.
••
Acoustics: The intent of this test is to acoustically excite the reflector struc­
ture in the higher frequency ranges and may also be used to load the reflector 
interfaces.
Between and after each of these tests there should be an inspection or verifica­
tion step to ensure that no permanent damage or degradation has occurred to the 
reflector assembly. Depending on the exact reflector design and end item require­
ments, the inspections may be one or more of the following: visual inspection, 
dimensional inspection, nondestructive evaluation (such as TTU or coin tap), and 
modal signature.
9.6.2.1  Thermal Cycling
Thermal cycling is a critical test of composite and bonded structural assemblies. In 
any composite reflector assembly, there are many interfaces between materials with 
dramatically different CTEs and stiffnesses where thermal strain can create large 
stresses. Fiber to matrix, core to faceskin, metallic fittings to composite laminate 
and/or core, and adhesive-filled joints are the most obvious but there are many 
other areas where thermally induced strain can overstress an assembly.
Exercising the assembly by thermal cycling is a very effective way of validating 
that the bond joints at critical interfaces were prepared and bonded correctly be­
fore any other environmental testing is performed. Depending on the hot tempera­
ture requirement, thermal cycling may also post-cure the room-temperature curing 
adhesives to some extent, which in almost all cases will cause them to shrink, in­
ducing some small level of additional strain. Thermal cycling also has the effect of 
relieving and balancing the strains in the assembly, which for a reflector in which 
surface figure is a key design parameter is a critical step in dimensionally stabilizing 
the assembly. 
It may be wise to perform thermal conditioning at lower levels of assembly, 
laminates, sandwiches, and subassemblies if they contain critical structure or struc­
tural bonds in order to reduce technical risk at the top-level assembly.
Because certain construction elements of the reflector have an affinity for mois­
ture, it is very important to conduct any cold thermal cycling in a “dry” environ­
ment to prevent icing, but more importantly to prevent the freezing of moisture 
present in the polymers or voids in the assembly from causing microcracking or 
other failures. It is common to conduct thermal cycling in a dry nitrogen environ­
ment and to bake out the moisture from the assembly for a 12- to 24-h period 
before commencing cold cycling.

422 
���������������������������������������������������������������
Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
9.6.2.2  Thermal Vacuum/Balance
Thermal cycling in an ambient pressure dry environment is usually adequate for 
testing an antenna reflector unless there are specific reasons to perform a vacuum 
test. 
For certain science missions it may desirable to remove as much condensable 
volatile content as possible that could degrade optical instruments or other sensi­
tive equipment on orbit. In these cases an extremely sensitive measuring device, a 
thermoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (TQCM) is placed in the vacuum cham­
ber and is used to measure the rate at which the volatiles are being released from 
the hardware. During TQCM bake-out the hardware will remain in the vacuum 
chamber until the desired rate of condensable volatile emissions is achieved, which 
can take from a few hours to many days depending on the reflector materials, the 
thickness of the materials in the construction, and the bake-out temperature. 
Another reason for a vacuum test could be to correlate an analytical thermal 
model. Most reflector designers will have a database on the key thermal properties 
of reflector materials (laminates/sandwiches) and construction elements such as 
bond joints that may have been established from simple materials or coupon tests. 
However, there are many possible areas for the analytical model to under- or over­
predict temperatures and gradients that can significantly affect the performance of 
the reflector on orbit. Empirically correlating any hardware design to the thermal 
model at least once significantly reduces the analytical uncertainty.
9.6.2.3  Thermal Distortion
As outlined previously the surface contour and contour stability over on-orbit envi­
ronments is a critical parameter for a reflector and one that should be validated for 
a certain design if not each unit before launch. If the reflector distorts in an undesir­
able or unpredicted way, the resulting distortion can have profound effects on the 
RF beam shape and pointing, compromising the satellite payload performance—
sometimes in a catastrophic way.
The ability to perform thermal distortion measurements at temperature to 
the accuracies required is a challenging and specialized capability that is for the 
most part limited to the satellite prime contractors and only a couple of composite 
manufacturers. With very few exceptions the customary measurement technique 
is photogrammetry, which is a noncontacting technique that uses retroreflective 
targets placed on the reflector assembly. The camera used for the measurements 
is limited in the temperature range to which it can be exposed, so it must be fairly 
well isolated from the thermal (or thermal vacuum) chamber environment. Also 
photogrammetry is dependent on photographs from multiple view angles requiring 
that either the unit under test or the camera be repositioned multiple times dur­
ing the test. A scale reference that is stable over the test temperature range is also 
required to be located in the chamber in a fixed location relative to the unit under 
test. Thermal distortion test setup for multiple reflectors is shown in Figure 9.17.
Virtually all thermal distortion tests of reflectors will be designed to establish 
the thermally induced deformation of the reflector relative to the satellite attach­
ment interface, which may be a set of “feet” for a fixed-mount reflector or a single 
hinge or gimbal interface for a deployable or steerable reflector.

9.6  Mechanical and Environmental Testing 
423
In addition, it is almost always the case that the results of a thermal distor­
tion test will not represent any particular on-orbit environment. Bulk temperature 
test cases are used to correlate the structural FEM, which is then used in conjunc­
tion with thermal analysis results to predict the actual on-orbit thermal distortion. 
The on-orbit thermal prediction profiles are generated from the analytical thermal 
model, which may have also been previously correlated to the hardware in a ther­
mal balance test.
9.6.2.4  Acoustic Vibration
For large surface area lightweight reflectors, acoustic excitation (high-frequency 
pressure loading) is often the structural design driver in the direction normal to 
the reflector surface. In-plane loads are usually driven by quasi-static conditions 
derived from coupled loads analysis or transfer orbit thermal loading. Medium and 
small reflector designs are more likely driven by random vibration inputs, both in 
plane and out. For all reflectors, the acoustic environment is an excellent workman­
ship test because its high-frequency pressure loading exercises laminates and joints 
globally, even those that are not in the launch configuration’s primary load path. 
Whether the reflector structural margins of safety are acoustically driven is 
somewhat dependent on the reflector mounting interface configuration and geom­
etry, which will govern the load distribution into the structure. For smaller reflec­
tors the bounding environment is likely to be a combination of sine (quasi-static) 
loads at the lower frequencies (<100 Hz) combined with random vibration loads 
at the higher frequencies. The breakpoint between a reflector being acoustically 
driven or sine/random driven is in the 1.5m aperture size range for a nonporous 
surface reflector. Larger surface area reflectors are usually acoustically driven by 
the acoustic energy exciting the reflector directly, and smaller ones are often driven 
by random vibration input from the panel or structure that the reflector is mounted 
to exciting the reflector.

Mechanical Aspects of Reflector Antennas for Space Applications
It is very important to understand how the acoustic test setup correlates with 
the flight configuration. If the acoustic test configuration is hard mounted to the 
flight interfaces, then the test is usually enveloping of the flight-like configuration; 
however, careful analysis of the design and test configurations must be performed 
to ensure that a significant overtest condition is not created by the test fixture in­
terfaces being too stiff.
If the fixturing that supports the reflector responds to the acoustic energy or is 
dynamically coupled to the reflector responses, a significant overtest is also likely 
so this must be carefully considered. Similarly, it is also possible to undertest the 
unit by having unrealistically flexible boundary conditions. For some reflector de­
signs where the acoustics do not drive the interface loads, it may be valid to hang 
the reflector on bungee cords (free-free) for the test. The key is to understand and 
analyze both the flight and the test configurations and how well they correlate.
9.6.2.5  Vibration (Sine, Random, Pulse)
The purpose of vibration testing is to expose the interfaces and critical areas of the 
reflector assembly to flight-like structural loading and to verify the predicted fun­
damental frequency characteristics.
For dynamic testing it is especially important to understand how the testing 
relates to the launch environment. The test scheme should, as much as possible, 
be designed to fully and realistically test the assembly to the flight environment in 
the flight configuration without significant under- or overtesting. Analysis of the 
test configurations is critical because, as much as it is not desirable and should be 
avoided, it is not unusual to have the test condition become a design driver. 
In reality, a reflector design is often driven by the unit-level test environment 
because the flight-level environment or boundary conditions are uncertain and as 
such the unit-level vibration requirements are specified with some if not consider­
able additional margin. Unless it drives a lot of cost and mass, the system design 
team will often assess the risk, and determine that it is easier and better to design 
to an enveloping simply described and implemented test condition as opposed to 
designing to a flight configuration with complex interface stiffness and uncertain 
loads. The test environment levels and boundary conditions are often more predict­
able and verifiable than the system-level test or flight, and the systems engineers 
can determine that the test condition bounds the stresses of the flight condition 
more readily than they can predict the exact flight condition. 
Because the reflector assembly is rarely required to act as a part of the satellite 
structure, it is common for the loads at the interfaces to be driven purely dynami­
cally due to the vibration environment acting on the mass of the reflector assembly. 
Depending on the reflector interface design details, the critical strength margins at 
the interfaces may be driven dynamically (quasi-static loads) or acoustically and it 
is important to understand this when designing the tests and test fixtures.
9.7  Concluding Remarks
A successful and efficient reflector design is a system-level balancing act be­
tween a large number of requirements, but ultimately it boils down to cost versus 

9.7  Concluding Remarks 
425
performance and as with most things the cost performance benefit is not linear 
but exponential. Understanding the impact on system-level performance of all the 
specific antenna-level requirements, such as reflector surface rms, pointing, mass, 
stiffness, and so on, is key to trading off technical requirements while remaining 
within a program’s cost and schedule requirements. The antenna RF design en­
gineer should understand what is reasonable and achievable within the program 
cost and mass budgets for surface rms, pointing and on-orbit degradation due to 
thermal distortion, and so on, and allow enough margin in the RF design to accom­
modate these aspects. If that is not done, the reflector mechanical design engineer 
may be forced into a more complex and expensive design that exceeds mass, cost, 
and perhaps schedule requirements and still may not meet the requirements speci­
fied by the RF antenna design engineer. 
Mechanically, reflector designs are a finely tuned recipe of tooling, materials, 
fabrication techniques, construction elements, joint designs, fittings, and so on, 
that all work together in a balanced way. So many variables are involved in a good 
design that it is critical for the whole team to be thinking about fabrication and 
tooling while evolving the reflector structural design. For instance, designing a re­
flector that incorporates “blind” bond joints will introduce fabrication challenges 
that could lead to extra tooling, additional labor, increased process variability, and 
inherent inaccuracies, resulting in degradations in joint performance. Sometimes 
design elements like this are inevitable or the lesser of two evils, but the earlier 
in the design cycle that these challenges are identified, the more likely it is that 
they can be incorporated into the design with minimum impact to the reflector 
performance.
Many of the most successful reflector designs are by far the simplest in con­
figuration, selection of materials, complexity, and required tooling. Almost without 
exception this and is a result of effective communication between the RF antenna 
design engineer, the antenna subsystem engineer, and the satellite subsystem engi­
neer with everyone involved being aware of what is possible within the program 
cost, schedule, and mass budgets.
