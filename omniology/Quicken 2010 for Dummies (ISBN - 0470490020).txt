About the Author
Stephen L. Nelson is a CPA in Redmond, Washington. Nelson has an under­
graduate degree in accounting, a Master of Business Administration degree in 
finance, and a Master of Science degree in taxation. He’s spent more than two 
decades helping individuals, real estate investors, and businesses manage 
their finances — usually, in part, by better use of computer systems such as 
Quicken.
As corny as it sounds, Steve truly enjoys writing books that make using per­
sonal computers easier and more fun. In fact, a substantiated rumor that 
appeared first in The Wall Street Journal says Steve has written more than 150 
computer books.
Steve is the best-selling author on the Quicken product. In fact, Wiley recently 
tallied up Steve’s Quicken For Dummies sales — and lo and behold, if Wiley 
hasn’t printed more than one million copies!

Quicken 2010 For Dummies 
xx

Introduction
Y
ou aren’t a dummy, of course. But here’s the deal: You don’t have to be 
some sort of technogeek or financial wizard to manage your financial 
affairs on a PC. You have other things to do, places to go, and people to meet. 
And that’s where Quicken 2010 For Dummies comes in.
In the pages that follow, I give you the straight scoop on how to use Quicken 
2010 Premier for Windows, without a lot of extra baggage, goofy tangential 
information, or misguided advice.
About This Book
This book isn’t meant to be read from cover to cover like some Dan Brown 
page-turner. Rather, it’s organized into tiny, no-sweat descriptions of how to 
do the things you need to do. If you’re the sort of person who just doesn’t 
feel right not reading a book from cover to cover, you can, of course, go 
ahead and read this thing from front to back.
I can recommend this approach, however, only for people who have already 
checked the TV listings. There may, after all, be a Dog the Bounty Hunter 
rerun on.
How to Use This Book
This comment dates me, but I’m not ashamed to say that I always enjoyed 
reading those encyclopedias my parents bought for my siblings and me. I 
could flip open, say, the E volume, look up elephants, and then learn just 
about everything I needed to know about elephants for a fifth-grade report: 
where elephants live, how much they weigh, and why they eat so much.
You won’t read anything about elephants here, but you can use this book in 
the same way. If you want to learn about something, look through the Table 
of Contents or index and find the topic — printing checks, for example. Then 
flip to the correct chapter or page and read as much as you need or enjoy. No 
muss. No fuss.
If you want to find out about anything else, you can, of course, just repeat the 
process.

2
Quicken 2010 For Dummies 
What You Can Safely Ignore
Sometimes I provide step-by-step descriptions of tasks. I feel very bad that 
I have to do this. So to make things easier for you, I highlight the tasks with 
bold text. That way, you’ll know exactly what you’re supposed to do. I also 
often provide a more detailed explanation in regular text. You can skip the 
regular text that accompanies the step-by-step descriptions if you already 
understand the process.
Here’s an example that shows what I mean:
	
1.	Press Enter.
	
	Find the key that’s labeled Enter. Extend your index finger so that it 
rests ever so gently on the Enter key. In one sure, fluid motion, press the 
Enter key by using your index finger. Then release the key.
Okay, that’s kind of an extreme example. I never go into that much detail. 
But you get the idea. If you know how to press Enter, you can just do that 
and not read further. If you need help — say, with the finger depression part 
or something — just read the nitty-gritty details.
Can you skip anything else? Let me see now. . . . You can skip the paragraphs 
with the Technical Stuff icons next to them. See the “Special Icons” section, 
later in this Introduction, for an example of the Technical Stuff icon. The 
information I stick in those paragraphs is really only for those of you who like 
that technical kind of stuff.
What You Should Not Ignore 
(Unless You’re a Masochist)
Don’t skip the Warnings. They’re the text flagged with the picture of the 19th 
century bomb. They describe some things you really shouldn’t do.
Out of respect for you, I’m not going to put such stuff in these paragraphs as 
“Don’t smoke.” I figure that you’re an adult. You can make your own lifestyle 
decisions.
So I’ll reserve the Warnings for more urgent and immediate dangers — things 
akin to “Don’t smoke while you’re filling your car with gasoline.”

 Introduction
Three Foolish Assumptions
I assume just three things:
	
✓	You have a PC with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista, or 
Windows 7.
	
✓	You know how to turn it on.
	
✓	You want to use some flavor of Quicken 2010.
The Flavors of Quicken
Okay. I lied in the previous section. I’m going to assume one more thing: You 
own or somehow have access to a copy of Quicken.
You may be interested to know that Quicken comes in several versions. It 
doesn’t really matter which one of the several versions you have. Each ver­
sion works in basically the same way, and this book applies to them all. But 
because each version has a few unique features, you may find that your 
screen doesn’t look exactly like the screens shown in this book. You may, 
for example, have a few buttons that you don’t see in the figures I show you. 
Don’t worry if this happens. It probably means that you’re working with a dif­
ferent version than I am.
Just to let you know, I used the super-duper, includes-everything version 
to write this book. You can tell this because the menu bar, which appears 
in some of the figures, shows both a Rental Property menu and a Business 
menu. If you have a different version, your menu bar will not show these 
menus. Your title bar (if you compare) will also show a different name
The upshot here? Don’t freak out if your version of Quicken 2010 looks a wee 
bit different from the figures shown in this book.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into six mostly coherent parts.

4
Quicken 2010 For Dummies 
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture
Part I covers some up-front stuff you need to take care of. I promise I won’t 
waste your time here. I just want to make sure that you get off on the right foot.
Part II: The Absolute Basics
This second part of the book explains the core knowledge you need to know 
in order to keep a personal or business checkbook with Quicken: using the 
checkbook, printing, reporting on your finances, using online banking, bal­
ancing your bank accounts, and using the Quicken calculators.
Some of this stuff isn’t very exciting compared to The Colbert Report — which 
really is a good show, isn’t it? — so I’ll work hard to make things fun for you.
Part III: Home Finances
Part III talks about the sorts of things you may want to do with Quicken if 
you’re using it at home: credit cards, loans, mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. 
You get the idea. If you don’t ever get this far — hey, that’s cool.
If you do get this far, you’ll find that Quicken provides some tools that elimi­
nate not only the drudgery of keeping a checkbook, but also the drudgery of 
most other financial burdens.
While I’m on the subject, I also want to categorically deny that Part III con­
tains any secret messages if you read it backward.
Part IV: Very Serious Business
The “Very Serious Business” part helps people who use Quicken in a busi­
ness or for real estate investing.
If you’re pulling your hair out because you’re using Quicken in a business, 
postpone the hair pulling — at least for the time being. Read Part IV first. It 
tells you about measuring profits, preparing payroll for any employees, track­
ing the amounts that customers owe you, and other wildly exciting stuff.

5
 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
By tradition, a For Dummies book includes “The Part of Tens.” It provides a 
collection of ten-something lists: ten answers to frequently asked questions 
about Quicken, ten ways not to become a millionaire, and ten tips for trouble­
shooting Quicken when you encounter a problem.
Part VI: Appendixes
It’s an unwritten rule that computer books have appendixes, so I include two. 
Appendix A gives you a quick-and-dirty overview of Windows for those new 
to the world of Windows. Appendix B is a glossary of key business, financial, 
and computer terms.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make the best use of your time and energy, you should know about the 
following conventions I use in this book.
When I want you to type something, such as Hydraulics screamed as the 
pilot lowered his landing gear, I put it in bold letters.
By the way, with Quicken, you don’t have to worry about the case of the stuff 
you type (except for passwords, which are case sensitive). If I tell you to type 
Hillary, you can type HILLARY. Or you can follow e. e. cummings’s lead and 
type hillary.
Whenever I describe a message or information that you see on the screen, I 
present it as follows:
Surprise! This is a message on-screen.
Special Icons
Like many computer books, this book uses icons, or little pictures, to flag 
things that don’t quite fit into the flow of things. For Dummies books use a 
standard set of icons that flag little digressions, such as the following:

6
Quicken 2010 For Dummies 
	
This icon points out nerdy technical material that you may want to skip (or 
read, if you’re feeling particularly bright).
	
Here’s a shortcut to make your life easier.
	
This icon is just a friendly reminder to do something.
	
And this icon is a friendly reminder not to do something . . . or else.
Where to Next?
If you’re just getting started, flip the page and start reading the first chapter.
If you have a special problem or question, use the Table of Contents or the 
index to find out where that topic is covered and then turn to that page.

Part I
Zen, Quicken, and 
the Big Picture

In this part . . .
W
hen you go to a movie theater, some prerequisites 
are necessary for the show to be truly enjoyable. 
And I’m not referring to the presence of Angelina Jolie or 
Will Smith on the screen. Purchasing a bucket of popcorn 
is essential, for example. One should think strategically 
both about seating and about soda size. And one may even 
have items of a, well, personal nature to take care of — 
such as visiting the little boys’ or girls’ room.
I mention all this stuff for one simple reason: To make 
getting started with Quicken as easy and fun as possible, 
you have to complete some prerequisites, too. And this 
first part of Quicken 2010 For Dummies talks about these 
sorts of things.

Chapter 1
Setting Up Shop
In This Chapter
▶	Installing and setting up Quicken
▶	Setting up your bank (or other) accounts if you’re a first-time user
▶	Providing a Quicken overview
▶	Solving setup problems
I
f you’ve never used Quicken, begin here. This chapter tells you how to 
install Quicken (if you haven’t already) and how to start the program 
for the first time. You also find out how you go about setting up Quicken 
accounts to track banking activities — specifically, the money that goes into 
and out of a checking or savings account.
If you’ve already begun to use Quicken, don’t waste any time reading this 
chapter unless you want the review. You already know the stuff it covers.
By the way, if you have Windows, I assume that you know a little bit about 
it. No, you don’t have to be some sort of expert. Shoot, you don’t even have 
to be all that proficient. You do need to know how to start Windows applica­
tions (such as Quicken). It also helps immensely if you know how to choose 
commands on menus and how to enter stuff in windows and dialog boxes. 
If you don’t know how to do these kinds of things, flip to Appendix A. It pro­
vides a quick-and-dirty overview of how you work in Windows. Read the stuff 
in the appendix, or at least skim it, and then come back to this chapter.
	
When I say Windows, I mean a recent version of Windows — something 
Microsoft is either currently selling or has sold in the last few years. Quicken 
2010 won’t run on Windows 3.1 or Windows 95, so if you want to run the latest 
version, I’m afraid it’s time to upgrade. By the way, for the computer I used to 
write this book, I used Windows Vista.

10
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
Installing and Starting Quicken
You install Quicken the same way that you install any program in Windows. 
If you already know how to install programs, you don’t need any help from 
me. Stop reading here, do the installation thing, start your newly installed 
Quicken program, and then start reading the next section, “Finishing Setup If 
You’ve Used Quicken Before.”
If you need help installing Quicken, here are the step-by-step instructions. 
Installing Quicken from a CD-ROM is as easy as one, two, three, four:
	
1.	Insert the CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.
	
	 In a short amount of time, Quicken should display the Quicken 2010 
installation window. I’m not going to show this window in a figure. 
There’s really nothing in the window to talk about. The window just 
reads Welcome.
	
	 Note: If nothing happens when you put the CD-ROM into the CD-ROM 
drive, don’t panic! First, try removing the CD and then putting it in again. 
If Windows still doesn’t recognize the CD, you need to tell Windows that 
it should install your Quicken program. In many versions of Windows 
(but not necessarily with your version), you do this with the Windows 
Control Panel by using the Programs tool. To do this, refer to your 
Windows user guide or a good book about your version of Windows 
(such as Windows Vista For Dummies, written by Andy Rathbone).
	
2.	Click Next.
	
	 Quicken then displays a window that asks you a few questions:
 
• Whether you accept the Quicken license agreement.
 
• Where you want to install Quicken. You should accept the instal­
lation’s program suggestion. (The installation program suggests a 
Quicken subfolder in your Program Files folder.)
 
• Whether it’s okay to uninstall the previous version of Quicken if 
there is a previous version of Quicken installed on your computer. 
You may also be asked whether it’s okay with you if Quicken gets 
any program updates and if you’re okay with the Quicken program 
sending Intuit information about how you use Quicken.
	
3.	Answer these questions by clicking the appropriate buttons. Click 
Next to move to the next question. Then click the Install button when 
you answer the last question.
	
	 Quicken installs itself. This process takes a few minutes. Along the way, 
you see several other screenfuls of messages, including marketing infor­
mation about the features new to Quicken and some progress reports on 
the installation itself.

11
 Chapter 1: Setting Up Shop
	
	 When in doubt about some installation option, just accept the default 
suggestion by pressing Enter.
	
	After the installation is complete, Quicken displays an installation 
complete message.
	
4.	Click Done.
	
	 Congratulations. You’re done.
After you install Quicken, you need to start it to finish the setup process. If 
you told the installation program to launch Quicken 2010, you should see the 
Quicken program window on your screen. If you didn’t tell the installation 
program to launch Quicken, you need to start Quicken.
	
The easiest way to start Quicken is to double-click the Quicken shortcut icon 
that (post installation) appears on your Windows desktop. The Quicken pro­
gram window appears, almost like magic.
	
Quicken might ask whether it can download program updates over the 
Internet. You can just say yes if it asks you this question.
Finishing Setup If You’ve 
Used Quicken Before
If you’ve used a previous version of Quicken, the Quicken program might 
show option buttons to indicate what you want to do next: Open the found 
data file. (Alternatively, you can indicate that you want to open some other 
data file.) You’re done. You’re ready to begin Quicken-ing.
	
The Quicken setup process can usually tell whether you’ve used Quicken 
before. The setup process knows where the Quicken installation program 
usually puts the Quicken program and data files, and the installation pro­
gram will look there. If you’ve used Quicken before but Quicken can’t see 
this, two possibilities exist: The first possibility is that you put the Quicken 
data file someplace weird. (If that’s the case, hopefully, you remember the 
weird place you hid the Quicken data file. But if not, see the later section, 
“The mysterious case of the missing Quicken data files,” at the end of this 
chapter.) The second possibility is that you didn’t do anything with the 
Quicken data file but that the data file has somehow gone missing. (If that’s 
the case, hopefully you backed up the Quicken data file to a CD or to some 
other disk from which you can restore the data file.)

12
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
Finishing the Setup
If Quicken can’t figure out whether you’ve used the Quicken program before, 
it displays a friendly welcome message (not shown), which asks if you’re a 
new Quicken user or if you’re already a Quicken user.
If you’re a new Quicken user, Quicken asks whether it’s okay to use the 
default location for the data file (you should agree to this) and then automati­
cally sets up a data file for you (you don’t need to worry about it). Quicken 
next prompts you to register. (You might as well do this. The registration 
takes only a few minutes. All you do, in a nutshell, is provide your name and 
address, a bit of information about how you use Quicken, and your e-mail 
address.)
If you’ve used Quicken before, select the I Am Already A Quicken User 
option. Quicken then displays another Get Started With Quicken 2010 
window, shown in Figure 1-1, that asks whether you want to open a Quicken 
file located on this computer, restore a Quicken data file you’ve backed up to 
CD or disk, or start over and create a new data file.
	
Figure 1-1: 
Another Get 
Started With 
Quicken 
2010 
window.
	
If you indicate that you want to open another Quicken data file located on the 
computer, Quicken displays a dialog box that asks where that file is. If you 
indicate that you want to grab a backup copy of the Quicken file, Quicken 

13
 Chapter 1: Setting Up Shop
displays a dialog box that asks where that file is. Presumably, if either of 
these situations is your case, you’ll know where the data file or backup copy 
of the data file is.
After the data file is set up, Quicken starts the Home page (see Figure 1-2). 
The Setup Center walks you through the steps for setting up Quicken. (You 
can find out much more on this process in the next section.)
	
Figure 1-2: 
The Quicken 
Home page.
	
Describing Your Banking
The first time you start Quicken 2010, the program shows a Home page that 
includes a big Get Started button in (roughly) the middle of the screen.
Clicking the Get Started button allows you to provide information about your 
bank account and its current balance. Figure 1-3 shows the window that col­
lects the first part of this information, but just so you don’t get confused, 
here are the precise steps you take:

14
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
	
Figure 1-3: 
The What 
Is The 
Financial 
Institution 
For This 
Account 
window.
	
	
1.	Identify the financial institution — usually a bank — by typing your 
institution’s name in the text box provided.
	
	 As you type, Quicken displays a list of financial institutions that match 
what you’ve typed so far. The more you type, the shorter the list of 
possible matching institutions. If you see your bank or whatever listed, 
select it. When you click the Next button, Quicken displays the next 
Quicken Setup Center window, which simply enough asks whether you 
want to download transactions and account balance information directly 
from your bank’s Web site.
	
2.	Tell Quicken whether you want to download transactions directly 
from your bank or enter transactions manually.
	
	 If your bank provides Internet access to your bank account — and many 
banks do — Quicken knows. And as a result, Quicken will, in a polite but 
firm way, suggest that you save yourself a whole lot of headache by just 
grabbing data from the bank’s Web site. I’m going to suggest, however, 
that you maintain your account manually. You have plenty of time later 
to find out how online banking works. (Online banking is really cool, 
though. See Chapter 6 for more information.) To indicate that you’ll 
manually set up your account, click the No I Don’t Have A User Name 
And Password option, select Next, and then select the Continue I’ll Enter 
My Transactions Manually option button. Note that Quicken may not get 
into this online banking stuff if Quicken can tell that your bank doesn’t 
support online banking.
	
3.	Tell Quicken the name you want to use for the checking account.

15
 Chapter 1: Setting Up Shop
	
	 You do so by typing a name in the Account Name/Nickname text box, 
shown in Figure 1-4. Furthermore, if given the choice, click one of the 
option buttons that appears below the Account Name/Nickname text 
box to indicate whether you’re using the bank account primarily for 
business finances, personal finances, and so on. By the way, as far as the 
account name goes, you can be as general or as specific as you want. 
But brevity is a virtue here, so be concise: Quicken uses your account 
name to label stuff within the Quicken window and on Quicken reports. 
If you use a long account name, the name may not always fit on reports 
and screens.
	
Figure 1-4: 
The Tell 
Quicken 
About This 
Checking 
Account 
window.
	
	
4.	Enter the ending bank statement date by referring to your bank 
statement.
	
	 After you provide Quicken with a name and general description of 
the account’s transactions, click Next, and Quicken displays another 
account setup dialog box (shown in Figure 1-5) that asks about the 
account’s ending statement date and ending statement balance. Enter 
the date of your last bank statement into the Statement Ending Date text 
box. This date, by the way, is forward from which you will start using 
Quicken. Enter the date in MM/DD/YYYY or MM/DD/YY fashion.
	
	 “Geez, Steve,” you’re now saying to yourself, “what’s MM/DD/YYYY fash­
ion?” Okay. Here’s an example: If your bank statement is dated July 7, 
2010, type 07/07/2010, or you can type 070710.

Figure 1-5: 
The Enter 
the Ending 
Date and 
Balance

Latest 
Statement 
window.
	
	
5.	Enter the ending bank statement balance by referring to your bank 
statement.
	
	 This balance is whatever appears on your bank statement. This balance 
is also the amount of money in your account on the date you begin your 
financial record keeping. If you have $4.16 in your checking account, 
type 4.16 in the Statement Ending Balance text box.
	
6.	After you type the bank statement balance, click the Next button to 
continue moving through the Account Setup.
	
	 Ultimately, you’ll see a window that provides buttons you can click to 
start using Quicken and to add additional bank accounts and even credit 
card accounts.
	
	 If you have several other bank accounts that you want to set up within 
Quicken, you should repeat the preceding steps for each account. Just 
click the button that refers to you adding another bank account.
Slogging Through More Setup Stuff
Okay, from my perspective, after you’ve described your bank account(s), 
you’re ready to start using Quicken. With Quicken, the key thing you want to 
do is track your bank account or accounts so you can monitor and measure 
your income and your outgo. And so that you know how much money you 
have in an account.
The folks at Intuit, however, allow you to provide the Quicken program 
with a lot more information about your financial affairs. For example, the 
Intuit gang lets you describe in detail your income sources, your regular 

17
 Chapter 1: Setting Up Shop
expenditures, any of your investments, your other assets, debts such as 
car loans and mortgages, and the real reason you had a crush on Millicent 
Peabody in third grade.
To tell Quicken all about your financial life, click the Setup tab (which 
appears in the upper-right corner of the Quicken Home page). When you do, 
Quicken displays the buttons and boxes shown in Figure 1-6. The Tax Status 
area asks for information about your family status, including whether you’re 
married and whether you have dependents. This area also asks which book­
keeping activities you plan to use Quicken for: personal, small business, 
rental property, and so on. To provide Quicken with more information about 
how you’ll use the software, answer the questions as best you can by check­
ing the boxes. If you don’t know how to answer some question, don’t worry 
about it. Go ahead and skip the question.
I talk more about this stuff in future chapters. Don’t worry. But just so I don’t 
leave you drifting, let me also mention that people who want to go hog wild 
can scroll down through the Setup Center’s buttons and boxes. Figure 1-7 for 
example, shows some buttons and boxes that appear beneath the buttons 
used for setting up bank accounts, which I just talked about.
To provide more information to Quicken — such as information about your 
income — click a button like the Add Paycheck or Add Other Income button. 
After you click one of these sorts of buttons, Quicken displays a series of 
dialog boxes that ask for the gory details. If you click the Add Paycheck 
button, for example, Quicken asks for the name of your employer and for the 
details of your paycheck.
The best way to get started
Quicken wants you to use your last bank state­
ment to set up the bank account you track. 
This way, your financial records synchronize 
with the bank’s records when you start using 
Quicken.
But I want to suggest something slightly dif­
ferent to you. Go back farther than just to the 
beginning of the previous month (which is what 
you do when you use your last bank statement). 
Go back to the beginning of the year, and use 
the last bank statement of the previous year — 
even if it’s now several months after the begin­
ning of the year. Now, I’m not trying to waste 
your time. Let me point out two big advantages 
to having a complete year’s data in Quicken: 
Tracking and tallying your tax deductions will 
be a snap, and planning your finances will be 
easier. When you enter the activity, be sure to 
enter any outstanding checks or deposits from 
the prior period with their correct dates also. 
That way, they are there to check off when you 
do your first reconciliation.
Going back to the beginning of the year isn’t 
as hard as you may think. Quicken provides a 
bunch of tools to help you enter several months’ 
worth of data in a very short time, as you can 
see in this chapter and in the two or three that 
follow.

 Chapter 1: Setting Up Shop
Steve’s Overview
You don’t need to know much about the mechanics of the Quicken interface — 
the way its windows work — to begin working with Quicken, especially in any 
chapters in this book in which I cover the basics. I provide plenty of detailed 
instructions, but I have a couple of quick comments now.
Starting Quicken for the second time
The second time you start Quicken — and every subsequent time — things 
work pretty much the same way as the first time. Double-click the Quicken 
icon on your desktop. Or, if you like doing things the hard way, click Start 
and then choose All Programs➪Quicken 2010➪Quicken 2010.
Using Quicken document windows
Quicken doesn’t use document windows the way that some other Windows 
applications do. Quicken basically turns document windows into pages 
that you leaf through by clicking the links, or hyperlinks, that appear in an 
Accounts bar along the left edge of the program window. In Figure 1-7, for 
example, you see links for Banking and Business. (You may see different 
hyperlinks on your monitor if you’re using a different version of Quicken and 
additional hyperlinks for Investing, Rental Property, and Property and Debt if 
you’ve set up Quicken differently.)
Navigating with QuickTabs
Quicken arranges all its features — whistles, bells, or whatever else you want 
to call them — using navigation QuickTabs that appear near the top edge of 
the window. For example, if you look closely at Figure 1-7, you will see tabs 
labeled Home, Bills, Banking, Planning, Business, and so on.
If you’re still confused, click the buttons and bits of text in the area of the 
Quicken window that I’m talking about. You’ll clearly see how things work.

Solving Tricky Setup Problems
I want to quickly go over a handful of annoying setup problems new Quicken 
users may encounter. If you have Quicken set up and are ready to roll, skip 
this stuff.
Did somebody say Macintosh?
You can use the existing old Quicken files if you’re working with a new ver­
sion of Quicken. In fact, if the Quicken installation program can find a version 
of old Quicken files on your computer, it gives you the option of just skipping 
all the Quicken Express Setup stuff. In this case, you just begin using your 
existing files. (I mention this point earlier in this chapter, in fact.)
If you’ve been using Quicken for Macintosh, however, you have to export 
your data from the Macintosh before you can read it in the Windows ver­
sion. And I can think of about a million things more fun to do than export­
ing Quicken data from a Mac to Windows. See the section in Chapter 17 on 
importing data from an old accounting system for a brief discussion on the 
procedure and some suggestions for better ways to spend your time.
The mysterious case of the missing 
Quicken data files
If Quicken doesn’t find the old files, you need to open the specific files. But 
if you have this problem, you should be able to solve it yourself. What has 
happened, if you find yourself in this boat, is that you’ve moved or messed 
around with the Quicken files with some other program, such as Windows. 
If you did that, presumably you had a reason. And more to the point, you 
should know where you put the files.
Migrating from Microsoft Money
Suppose that you’re moving from Microsoft Money to Quicken. The question 
of the hour is this: Can you reuse your old or existing Money files in Quicken? 
The answer is, “Yes, sort of.”

21
 Chapter 1: Setting Up Shop
First of all, the Quicken File menu includes an Import command that lets you 
import files from Microsoft Money 2007 or 2008. So far, so good. 
Further, if you’ve got an older version of Microsoft Money you want to con­
vert data from, you can download a program called Data Converter from the 
Quicken support Web site. Data Converter converts Microsoft Money data 
files from Microsoft Money 2003 and later versions to the Quicken 2004, 2005, 
2006, 2007, and 2008 file format. Quicken 2010 should easily then convert one 
of these old-format Quicken files to the Quicken 2010 file format. So, theoreti­
cally, you can move old Microsoft Money data files to Quicken.
Practically, however, moving financial information from Quicken to Money or 
vice versa doesn’t seem to work all that well. Transactions seem to get lost. 
Account balances get messed up. People ruin their lives. Well, maybe that last 
comment is a slight exaggeration. But, no kidding: Migrating is problematic. If 
you do want to move from one program to another, I suggest making sure that 
you have a really good reason for doing so and that you allow yourself enough 
time to track down and correct any errors. The Data Converter is available 
from https://quicken.custhelp.com — use the search term Microsoft 
Money after you select your Quicken version.

Chapter 2
Introduction to the Big Picture
In This Chapter
▶	Distilling Quicken to its very essence
▶	Setting up additional bank accounts
▶	Adding, removing, and modifying categories
▶	Understanding tags
B
efore you spend a bunch of time and money on Quicken, you have to 
understand the big picture. You need to know what Quicken can do. 
You need to know what you want to do. And, as a practical matter, you need 
to tell Quicken what you want it to do.
Boiling Quicken Down to Its Essence
When you boil Quicken down to its essence, it does six things:
	
✓	It lets you track your tax deductions.
	
	This feature makes preparing your personal or business tax return 
easier for you or your poor accountant, Cratchit.
	
✓	It lets you monitor your income and outgo either on-screen or by 
using printed reports.
	
	Usually, this stuff is great fodder for discussions about the family 
finances. And, if you’re running a business or investing in real estate 
rental properties, this income and expense information becomes more 
than just great conversation fodder — the information helps you better 
manage your business.
	
✓	It lets you print checks (and sometimes other forms, too).
	
	This device is mostly a timesaver, but it can also be useful for people 
who are neat freaks.

24
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
	
✓	It lets you track the things you own (such as bank accounts, invest­
ments, and real estate) and the debts you owe (such as home mortgage 
principal, car loan balances, and credit card balances).
	
	These things are really important to know.
	
✓	It helps you make better personal financial planning decisions about 
such matters as retirement, your children’s future college costs, and 
your savings and investments.
	
	I think this stuff is really neat.
	
✓	It gives you the opportunity to pay bills electronically and, in some 
cases, even do all your banking electronically.
	
	This stuff is pretty neat, too. No, let me amend that. Online bill paying 
and banking are really neat. I do have some minor (very minor) reser­
vations that I discuss in Chapter 6, which deals with online banking in 
depth.
Tracking tax deductions
To track your tax deductions, make a list of the deductions you want to 
track. To do so, pull out last year’s tax return. Note which lines you filled in. 
(Perhaps mortgage interest, property taxes, state income taxes, and chari­
table contributions?) This method works because there’s a darn good chance 
that the tax deductions you claimed last year will also be the tax deductions 
you’ll claim in the future.
I cover the Quicken categories, which you use to track your tax deductions, a 
little later in this chapter.
Monitoring spending
At our house, we (my wife, Sue, and I, your humble author) use Quicken to 
monitor our spending on the mundane little necessities of life: groceries, cloth­
ing, dog food, cable television, and, well . . . you get the picture. To keep track 
of how much we spend on various items, we also use the Quicken categories.
	
If you want to monitor a particular spending category, decide up front what 
the category should be before you begin recording your data.
Your list of spending categories, by the way, shouldn’t be an exhaustive list 
of superfine pigeonholes, such as Friday-night Mexican food, Fast food for 
lunch, and so on. To track your spending on eating out, one category named 
something like Meals or Grub usually is easiest.

25
 Chapter 2: Introduction to the Big Picture
In fact, I’m going to go out on a limb. You can probably start with a dozen 
categories, more or less:
	
✓	Car
	
✓	Clothing
	
✓	Entertainment and vacation
	
✓	Groceries
	
✓	Household expenses (besides food)
	
✓	Insurance
	
✓	Medical and dental
	
✓	Rent (or mortgage payments)
	
✓	Taxes
	
✓	Utilities (electric, water, cable television)
	
✓	Work expenses
If you want to, and over time, you can expand this list. Heck, you can create 
dozens and dozens of categories. My experience, though, is that you’ll prob­
ably use only a handful of categories.
Printing checks (and other forms)
You can use Quicken to print checks. This little trick provides a couple of 
benefits: It’s really fast if you have several checks to print, and your printed 
checks look very neat and darn professional.
To print checks, you need to do just two things. First, look through the check 
supply information that comes with Quicken, and pick a check form that suits 
your style. Then order the form. (The check forms that come with remittance 
advices — or check stubs — work well for businesses.)
Preprinted check forms aren’t cheap. If you’re using Quicken at home with 
personal-style checks (such as those that go in your wallet), using computer 
checks may not be cost effective. Even if you’re using Quicken for a business, 
and you’re used to buying those outrageously expensive business-style 
checks, you’ll still find computer checks a bit more expensive.
I’m pretty much a cheapskate, so I don’t use printed checks at home 
(although I do use them in my business). I should admit, however, that I also 
don’t write very many checks.

26
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
	
By the way, I’ve “checked” around. Although you can order Quicken check 
forms from other sources (such as your local office supplies store), they’re 
about the same price from Intuit (the maker of Quicken). If you want to order 
from Intuit, you can refer to the catalog that came in the Quicken packaging. 
You can also visit www.Quicken.com.
One other comment here about printing checks: If you’re going to pay bills 
electronically, you don’t need to print checks with Quicken. Oh, sure, you 
can print checks if you want. But you won’t want to. Paying a bill electroni­
cally is easier and cheaper than paying a bill with a Quicken-printed check.
A general comment about printing other forms: If you run a business, and the 
business needs to produce invoices, you can use Quicken Home & Business 
and Quicken Rental Property Manager (two business-y flavors of Quicken) to 
produce invoice forms, too.
Tracking bank accounts, credit 
cards, and other stuff
You must decide which bank accounts and credit cards you want to track. In 
most cases, you want to track each bank account you use and any credit card 
on which you carry a balance.
You may also want to track other assets and liabilities. Assets are just things 
you own: investments, cars, a house, and so on. Liabilities are things you 
owe: margin loans from your broker, car loans, a mortgage, and so on.
Shoot, I suppose that you could even track the things your neighbor owns — 
or perhaps just those things you especially covet. I’m not sure that this is a 
very good idea, though. (Maybe a healthier approach is to track just those 
things that you’ve borrowed from your neighbor.)
Planning your personal finances
Your computer’s computational horsepower makes it the ideal tool for doing 
complicated calculations. So maybe you’re not surprised that Quicken comes 
with five powerful calculators that let you make smarter borrowing choices, 
better mortgage-refinancing decisions, more accurate savings and investment 
calculations, and extremely helpful retirement and college savings calculations.

27
 Chapter 2: Introduction to the Big Picture
I believe that these financial planning tools are the most valuable features 
that Quicken offers. I’m just sorry that I have to wait until Chapter 10 to talk 
about them.
Banking online
If you want, you can tell Quicken that it should do the work of paying some 
person or merchant electronically. In other words, at the same time that you 
describe some check to Quicken — you do so by entering stuff in a window — 
you can say to Quicken, “I not only want you to record this check for me, I also 
want you to pay it for me.”
If your bank supports online banking, you may also be able to move money 
between your accounts and get up-to-date statements electronically. Ask 
your bank for details about this service if you’re interested.
To perform this sort of online banking, you need to have an Internet connec­
tion, and you need to do a little bit of paperwork. But the Quicken Online 
Banking features can save you scads of time. And the features are easy to use. 
Basically, all you do is use Quicken in the usual way — which is what I talk 
about in the chapters that follow — and then click a couple of extra buttons.
Setting Up Additional Accounts
When you first began working with Quicken — and this may have only been 
a few minutes ago or several years ago — you were prompted to set up an 
account. And you probably set up at least a checking account because this is 
probably your most active bank account. If you want to track any additional 
accounts — for example, a savings account — you must set them up, too.
Setting up another banking account
To set up an additional checking, savings, or money market account, you give 
the account a name and then its balance as of a set date. Here’s how:
	
1.	Click the Setup tab.
	
	 Quicken displays the Setup tab window, shown in Figure 2-1.

28
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
	
Figure 2-1: 
The Setup 
tab.
	
	
	 You can collapse and expand the different areas on the Setup tab by 
clicking the small button marked with a plus symbol or a minus symbol 
that’s just left of the area label. For example, to collapse and expand the 
Customize Quicken area on the Setup tab, click the button that’s just 
to the left of Customize Quicken. If the button shows a minus symbol, 
clicking the button collapses the Customize Quicken setup area. If the 
button shows a plus symbol, clicking the button expands the previously 
collapsed Customize Quicken setup area.
	
2.	Click the Add Checking Account or Add Savings Account button.
	
	 The Add Account buttons appear a little way down the Setup tab page, 
so you may need to scroll down a bit. When you click this button, 
Quicken displays the Account Setup dialog box, shown in Figure 2-2.
	
3.	Identify the financial institution and then click Next.
	
	 To identify where you’re banking, enter your institution’s name in the 
Enter The Name Of Your Financial Institution Or Select From A List By 
Clicking The Buttons Above text box. Alternatively, you can select the I 
Do Not Want To Enter My Financial Institution radio button if you want 
to go fast or skip the intrusive questioning.
	
4.	Indicate whether you want to connect to your bank online, and then 
click Next.

29
 Chapter 2: Introduction to the Big Picture
	
Figure 2-2: 
The first 
Account 
Setup dialog 
box.
	
	
	 When Quicken asks whether you want to download account activity 
and balance information directly from your bank or enter the informa­
tion manually, indicate that you don’t have a username and password, 
unless you already know how to use online banking, and then on the 
next screen indicate that you want to just enter transactions manually. 
(Quicken asks the “manual versus online” questions if you select a finan­
cial institution that allows for online banking.) 
	
5.	Name the account, and then click Next.
	
	 When Quicken displays the first Tell Quicken About This Account dialog 
box (see Figure 2-3), move the cursor to the Account Name/Nickname 
text box and type a name in that box. Click Next after you do this. You’re 
almost done.
	
6.	Enter the account balance date.
	
	 When Quicken displays the Statement Date and Balance dialog box 
shown in Figure 2-4, enter the date that you’re going to start keeping 
records for the bank account with Quicken. (Quicken wants you to 
start your record keeping for an account on a bank statement date 
because on a bank statement date, you have a really good balance from 
the bank.) Move the cursor to the Statement Ending Date text box and 
type the month number, a slash, the day number, a slash, and the year 
number. If you start on July 16, 2010, for example, type 07/16/2010. 
Or, if this is way too complicated for you, click the button at the end of 
the Statement Ending Date text box so that Quicken displays a pop-up 
calendar. Then click the date. Use the << and >> buttons to move back 
and forth a month at a time.

	 Note: If you want to keep your transaction records for tax purposes, of 
course, it makes sense to track whatever accounts you can from the first 
of the year, assuming that you have all the necessary statements or your 
own records of all the transactions.
	
7.	Click inside the Statement Ending Balance text box and enter the 
bank account balance.

31
 Chapter 2: Introduction to the Big Picture
	
	 Use the number keys to enter the balance. The folks at Intuit, by the 
way, really want you to use the balance from your bank statement. If you 
have terrible financial records — for example, you haven’t reconciled 
your account since Bill Clinton left office — this idea is probably good 
advice. If you have neat, accurate financial records, go ahead and use 
your check register balance.
	
	 If you do use the bank statement balance as your starting balance, be 
sure to enter all the transactions that cleared or will clear after the bank 
statement balance date. (This should make sense, right? If a check or 
deposit isn’t reflected in the bank statement figure, you must enter it 
with its correct date into Quicken.)
	
8.	Click Next and then the Done button.
	
	 Quicken re-displays the Setup tab.
Hey, Quicken, I want to use that account!
In Quicken, you work with one account at a time. The logic is simple: You 
record income and expenses for a particular account — a specific checking 
account, savings account, and so on. That makes sense, right?
Here’s the next thing you want to know about using these accounts: In gen­
eral, you work with an individual account by using the register window, as 
shown in Figure 2-5. I talk about using the register window a lot more in the 
chapters that follow, but in a nutshell, you enter account transactions in 
the register. Entering transactions in a register is the basic, Quicken record-
keeping task.
Here’s the next thing you need to know about working with a particular 
Quicken account. You use the Accounts bar, which appears along the left 
edge in the Quicken program window (see Figure 2-5) to tell Quicken which 
account you want to work with in a register window.
To use the Quicken Accounts bar, you click its hyperlinks. In other words, 
select the account you want by clicking the account name. Quicken displays 
the register window for that account.
	
You can collapse and expand the Accounts bar by clicking the small button 
marked with a plus symbol or a minus symbol that’s just left of Accounts. If 
the button shows a minus symbol, clicking the button collapses the Accounts 
bar. If the button shows a plus symbol, clicking the button expands a previ­
ously collapsed Accounts bar.

window.
	
Whipping Your Category Lists into Shape
Quicken supplies categories to, well, categorize your spending. For example, 
you would probably use the Rent category to categorize all the checks you 
write to pay rent.
The predefined categories list may be just what you want. Then again, it may 
not. Table 2-1 shows the all-inclusive category list.
	
Your category list may vary somewhat from the one shown in Table 2-1. 
Quicken may customize your starting category list based on your answers to 
questions it asks on the Quicken Setup tab. I talk about the Quicken Setup tab 
briefly in Chapter 1. 
Take a minute to look through the category list. If you find categories you 
don’t need, cross them off the list in the book. You can delete them from 
Quicken in a minute or so. If you need categories you don’t see, add them at 
the bottom of the list. You can add them in about two minutes or so.

33
 Chapter 2: Introduction to the Big Picture
	
✓	To track a certain income or spending item for income tax purposes — 
wages, property taxes, and so on — you need a Quicken category.
	
✓	To track a certain income or spending item because you’re just inter­
ested in knowing how much you spend on it (for example, renting 
DVDs), you need a Quicken category.
	
✓	To budget by categories (because you need a category for any income or 
spending item that you want to budget), you need a Quicken category.

Subcategories . . . yikes, what are they?
You surely didn’t buy Quicken so that you could spend all day Saturday 
sitting at your computer instead of taking the kids to the zoo. I realize this 
and want to make Quicken easier for you to use. To do so, I figure I should 
tell you which Quicken features you can ignore if you’re feeling a bit over­
whelmed. Subcategories are among those things I think that you can ignore.
“Subcategories?” you ask. “Yikes! What are they?”
Subcategories are categories within categories. If you look at the Taxes 
expense category in Table 2-1, for example, you’ll notice a bunch of catego­
ries that follow the Tax category and are slightly indented: Fed (federal tax), 
Medicare (Medicare tax), Other (miscellaneous taxes), Property, SDI (state 
disability insurance), Soc Sec (Social Security tax), and State (state tax).
When you use subcategories, you can subcategorize a transaction that pays, 
for example, taxes; you can further break down this category into subcatego­
ries such as federal income tax, Medicare tax, and Social Security tax. If you 
want to see a list of the ways you’ve spent your money, Quicken summarizes 
your spending both by category and, within a category, by subcategory. On a 
Quicken report, then, you can see this level of detail:

Category
Expense
Taxes
  Federal tax
900
  Medicare tax
100
  Soc Sec tax
700
Total taxes
1,700
No doubt about it: Subcategories are useful tools. But they make working 
with Quicken a little more complicated and a little more difficult. As a practi­
cal matter, you usually don’t need them as you start off. If later on you want 
to track a spending category in fine, granular detail, you can go ape on the 
subcategory thing then, okay? For these reasons, I’m not going to get into 
subcategories here.
If you get excited about the topic of subcategories later — after you have 
the hang of Quicken — you can peruse the Quicken documentation for more 
information.
	
If you do want to use the Quicken subcategories, don’t delete the subcatego­
ries shown in Table 2-1. If you don’t want to use the subcategories, go ahead 
and delete them. (I tell you how to remove categories in “Removing categories 
you loathe,” later in this chapter.)
Category groups . . . double yikes!
Category groups, which were known as supercategories in a previous version 
of Quicken, combine categories into sets that you can use in reports and in 
your budgeting. Sure, they’re sort of cool, but you don’t need to worry about 
them if you’re just starting with Quicken.
If you’re dying to know more about category groups, you can refer to the 
Quicken online help. Quicken Help works like Help in other Windows pro­
grams. If you don’t know Windows all that well — or at least not well enough 
to comfortably use Help — see Appendix A.
Four tips on categorization
I have just four tips for categorizing:
	
✓	Cross off any category you won’t use.
	
	If you don’t pay state income taxes in the state you live in, for example, 
get rid of the state tax category. Extra, unneeded categories just clutter 

39
 Chapter 2: Introduction to the Big Picture
your list. I think it’s great if you can get down to just a handful of 
categories.
	
✓	Don’t be afraid to lump together similar spending categories.
	
	Take your utilities expense, for example. If you pay water, natural gas, 
electricity, and sewer, why not use a single Utilities category? If you pay 
different utility companies for your water, natural gas, electricity, and 
sewer, you can still see what you spend on just electricity, for example, 
even with a single catchall category for utilities.
	
✓	Be sure to categorize anything that may be a tax deduction.
	
	Categorize alimony, educational, medical, and dental expenses; state 
and local income taxes; real estate taxes; personal property taxes; 
home mortgage interest and points; investment interest; charitable con­
tributions; casualty and theft losses; moving expenses; unreimbursed 
employee expenses; and all those vague, miscellaneous deductions. (By 
the way, the foregoing is a pretty complete list of itemized deductions 
in the United States at the time this book was written.)
	
✓	Don’t sweat this category stuff too much.
	
	In spite of the preceding three tips, don’t let these category lists or the 
work of customizing them scare you. If you want to spend a few minutes 
cleaning up the list, hey, that’s great. If not, or if you’re starting to get 
anxious, just skip ahead to Chapter 3.
Ch-ch-changing a category list
You should now be ready to fix any category list problems. Basically, you 
need to do three things: add categories, remove categories, and change cat­
egory names and descriptions.
Adding individual categories you’d love to use
Adding individual categories is a snap. Here’s all you have to do:
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Category List on the menu bar.
	
	 Quicken displays the Category List window (shown in Figure 2-6). This 
window lists the categories available and the accounts you’ve set up. 
Careful readers may notice that the categories shown in Figure 2-6 
include those shown in Table 2-1.
	
2.	Click the New button in the Category List window.
	
	 The New button, by the way, is the first button on the upper right. 
Quicken dutifully displays the Set Up Category dialog box (shown in 
Figure 2-7). You probably aren’t surprised that you use this puppy to 
describe the new category.

Figure 2-6:

Category 
List window.
	
	
Figure 2-7: 
The Set Up 
Category 
dialog box.
	
	
3.	Enter a short name for the category.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Name text box and type a name. Although you 
can use up to 15 characters, use as short of a name as possible to clearly 
identify the category. Why? Because you use this category name every 
time you want to tag a transaction to fall into the category.

41
 Chapter 2: Introduction to the Big Picture
	
4.	Enter a description for the category.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Description text box and then describe the cat­
egory. Quicken uses the category description on reports that show the 
category. If you don’t add a description, Quicken just uses the category 
name. You don’t need a description, obviously, if your category name is, 
well, adequately descriptive.
	
5.	(Optional) Identify the category group.
	
	If you disregarded my earlier suggestion to not worry about category 
groups, open the Group drop-down list box and select the appropriate 
group.
	
6.	Indicate whether the category is an income category or an expense 
category.
	
	 Select the appropriate Income, Expense, or Subcategory Of option 
button — just select the appropriate option button with your furry little 
friend, the mouse. If you’ve totally blown off my admonition not to use 
subcategories just yet, use the dialog box’s drop-down list to indicate 
into which income or expense category a new subcategory falls.
	
7.	Indicate whether the category tracks an amount you will use on an 
input line on next year’s tax return.
	
	 By line, I mean the actual tax form line — such as the line on the U.S. 
1040 form that tracks alimony.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Tax-Related check box and then select the check 
box if the category is tax-related or deselect the check box if the category 
isn’t tax-related. Just to clear up any confusion, vacationing in Hawaii 
probably isn’t a tax deduction — even if your neighbor promises that it 
is. Then identify the form and line by opening the Tax Line Item drop-
down list box and selecting one of its entries.
	
8.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken adds the new category in the Category List window (refer to 
Figure 2-6) and then redisplays the window. Now that you understand 
the stuff in the Category List window, note that it shows the category 
name, its type, notations concerning the category’s tax-reporting status, 
and, golly darn, even its description and group. (The tax information 
about on which tax return line a category gets reported appears only if 
the Show Tax Line Item choice under the option button is checked.)
Adding categories from a situational list
Quicken keeps lists of categories that are standard for people in certain situ­
ations, including Quicken users who are married, homeowners, real estate 
investors, and business owners.

42
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
To use these situational lists as a source of new categories, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Category List on the menu bar.
	
	 Quicken displays the Category List window (refer to Figure 2-6).
	
2.	Click the Add Categories button.
	
	 Quicken displays the Add Categories dialog box. This window lists the 
categories that may be useful in certain situations.
	
3.	Select one of the situational lists.
	
	 Open the Available Categories drop-down list box — you can do this 
simply by clicking the box — and select the situational list of categories 
you want to display: standard, married, homeowner, business, children, 
investment, or rents and royalties. Quicken displays the categories from 
the situational list selected.
	
4.	Select the categories you want to add.
	
	 Click the categories in the Categories list that you want to add. Quicken 
marks the categories you select with a check. You can, by the way, mark 
all the categories shown in the situational list by clicking the Mark All 
button. You can unmark all the “marked” categories by clicking the Clear 
All button.
	
5.	Add the selected categories.
	
	 After you mark the categories you want to add, click the Add button. 
Quicken adds the categories to the Categories To Add list. To complete 
the addition of the categories, click Add.
Removing categories you loathe
Removing categories takes only a couple of keystrokes. With the Category 
List window displayed, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the category you want to remove and then choose the Delete 
button that appears.
	
	 If no transactions are in the category, Quicken displays a message that 
asks you to confirm your decision.
	
2.	If you want to remove the selected category, click OK.
	
	 Otherwise, press the Esc key or click the Cancel button.
Changing category names and descriptions
You can change a category name, its type, its description, and its tax-related 
setting if you later discover you made some mistake, such as misspelling a 
word in a description.

43
 Chapter 2: Introduction to the Big Picture
To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the Category List window (refer to Figure 2-6).
	
2.	Use the arrow keys or click with your mouse to select the category you 
want to change and then click the Edit button.
	
	 Quicken displays a dialog box that has text boxes and option buttons 
describing the selected category’s information: its name, description, 
type, and tax-related settings.
	
3.	Make the changes you want by replacing text box contents or chang­
ing option button settings. Click OK to save your changes and return 
to the Category List window.
Merging categories
A quick, related point: If you select a category and then click the Merge 
button — the button appears to the right of the category information — 
Quicken displays a Merge Category dialog box, which you use to re-categorize 
transactions in the selected category. The dialog box provides a drop-down list 
box you use to select the new category you want to use. The dialog box also 
provides a check box you can check if you want to delete the category after 
moving transactions out of it.
Want to Play Tag?
Using categories isn’t the only way that you can summarize your financial 
records. Quicken provides a second tool, called tags, which lets you sum­
marize transactions in addition to the way you summarize transactions with 
categories. (In previous versions of Quicken, tags were known by another 
name: classes.)
Now, typically, tags are not something you need to worry about — especially 
if you’re just using Quicken to regain control over your personal finances. 
However, tags can be very useful if you’re using Quicken in a business or if 
you’re investing in rental real estate.
For these reasons, I want to quickly describe how you set up tags.
To set up a tag (or several tags), take these steps:
	
1.	Display the Tag List window.
	
	 To do this, choose Tools➪Tag List.
	
2.	Click the New button in the Tag List window.
	
	 Quicken displays the New Tag dialog box (shown in Figure 2-8).

44
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
	
Figure 2-8: 
The New 
Tag dialog 
box.
	
	
3.	Enter a short name for the tag.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Name text box and type a name. Use as short of a 
name as possible to clearly identify the tag. You use this tag name every 
time you want to tag a transaction. (If you’re using tags to identify real 
estate rental properties — which is probably their most common use — 
you might want to use the street name as the tag: Winston as the tag for 
the duplex on Winston Street, Roosevelt as the tag for the cottage on 
Roosevelt Avenue, and so on.)
	
	 The reason real estate investors tag transactions is this: By tagging each 
income or deduction transaction with, for example, the property name, 
Quicken easily produces a profit and loss statement for each property 
using the categories and tags to slice and dice the data.
	
4.	Enter a description for the tag.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Description text box and then describe the tag. 
Quicken uses the tag description on reports that show the tag. If you 
don’t add a description, Quicken just uses the tag name. You don’t need 
a description, obviously, if your tag name is, well, adequately descriptive.
	
	 The technical editor, David (who’s also a CPA), wants me to tell you that 
you should just ignore the Copy Number box. He’s probably right. But, if 
you’re just dying to know what this box does, click the Tell Me More link. 
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken adds the new tag in the Tag List window and then redisplays 
the window. And that is that.

In This Chapter
▶	Deciding whether you need a budget
▶	Discovering tips for personal and business budgets
▶	Setting up and reviewing a budget
I
don’t think that a budget amounts to financial handcuffs, and neither 
should you. A budget is really a plan that outlines the way you need to 
spend your money to achieve the maximum amount of fun or the way a busi­
ness needs to spend its money to make the most profit.
Should You Even Bother with a Budget?
A budget, as you probably know, is a list of the ways you earn and spend 
your money. If you create a good, workable category list with Quicken (see 
Chapter 2), you’re halfway to a good, solid budget. (In fact, the only step left 
is to specify how much you earn in each income category and how much you 
spend in each expense category.)
Does everybody need a budget? No, of course not. Maybe, at your house, 
you’re already having a bunch of fun with your money. Maybe, in your busi­
ness, you make money so effortlessly that you really don’t plan your income 
and outgo.
For the rest of us, though, a budget improves our chances of getting to wher­
ever it is we want to go financially. In fact, I’ll stop calling it a budget. The 
word has such negative connotations. I know — I’ll call it a Secret Plan.

46
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
Serious Advice about Your Secret Plan
Before I walk you through the mechanics of outlining your Secret Plan (your 
budget), I want to give you a few tips.
Your personal Secret Plan
	
You can do four things to make your Secret Plan more likely to work:
	
✓	Plan your income and expenses as a family.
	
	With this sort of planning, two heads are invariably better than one. 
What’s more, though I don’t really want to get into marriage counseling 
here, a family’s budget — oops, I mean Secret Plan — needs to reflect 
the priorities and feelings of everyone who has to live within the plan. 
Don’t use a Secret Plan as a way to minimize what your spouse spends 
on clothing or on long-distance telephone charges talking to relatives in 
the old country. You need to resolve issues regarding your clothing and 
long-distance charges before you finalize your Secret Plan.
	
✓	Include some cushion in your plan.
	
	In other words, don’t budget to spend every last dollar. If you plan from 
the start to spend every dollar you make, you undoubtedly have to fight 
the mother of all financial battles: paying for unexpected expenses when 
you don’t have any money. (You know the sort of things I mean — car 
repairs, medical expenses, or that cocktail dress or tuxedo you abso­
lutely must have for a special party.)
	
✓	Regularly compare your actual income and outgo to your planned 
income and outgo.
	
	This part of your plan is probably the most important and also the part 
that Quicken helps you with the most. As long as you use Quicken to 
record what you receive and spend, you can print reports showing what 
you planned and what actually occurred.
	
✓	Make adjustments as necessary.
	
	When you have problems with your Secret Plan — and you will — you’ll 
know that your plan isn’t working. You can then make adjustments, for 
example, by spending a little less calling the old country.

 Chapter 3: Maximum Fun, Maximum Profits
Two things that really goof 
up Secret Plans
Because I’m talking about you-know-what, let me touch on a couple of things 
that really goof up your financial plans: windfalls and monster changes.
The problem with windfalls
Your boss smiles, calls you into his office, and then gives you the good 
news. You’re getting a $5,000 bonus! “It’s about time,” you think. Outside, of 
course, you maintain your dignity. You act grateful but not gushy. Then you 
call your husband.
A Secret Plan for your business
The tips for personal Secret Plans also apply to 
businesses, but I have two special tips for small 
businesses using Quicken. (I’m going to write 
very quietly now so that no one else hears. . . .)
Here’s the first special tip: Visit the BizStats.
com Web site at www.bizstats.com. It 
provides tons and tons of good, interesting 
business statistics about businesses just like 
yours!
Here’s the second special tip: Go to the 
library, ask for the RMA (Risk Management 
Association) survey, and look up the ways that 
other businesses like yours spend money. If 
your library doesn’t have the RMA survey, see 
whether it has the Dun & Bradstreet survey 
or Troy’s Almanac of Business and Industrial 
Financial Ratios survey.
These surveys are really cool:
	✓	The RMA surveys bank-lending officers, 
creates a summary of the information these 
bankers receive from their customers, and 
publishes the results.
	✓	Dun & Bradstreet collects and summarizes 
its proprietary financial information.
	✓	Troy (who’s actually a business PhD) col­
lects Internal Revenue Service data and 
publishes the same sort of financial results.
At both the BizStats.com Web site and in the 
preceding surveys, you can get really useful 
information about what businesses like yours 
spend, make, and own. For example, you can 
look up what percentage of sales the average 
tavern spends on beer and peanuts, the aver­
age profit your CPA makes, and the profit a car 
dealer makes on the average car sale. (Isn’t 
that all kind of interesting stuff?)
By the way, neither the BizStats.com Web site 
nor the surveys will actually have a line on the 
taverns page labeled beer and peanuts, for 
example. It’ll be called cost of goods sold or 
some similarly vague accounting term.

48
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
Here’s what happens next. Bob (that’s your husband’s name) gets excited, 
congratulates you, and tells you he’ll pick up a bottle of wine on the way 
home to celebrate.
On your drive home, you mull over the possibilities and conclude that you 
can use the $5,000 as a big down payment for that new family minivan you’ve 
been looking at. (With the trade-in and the $5,000, your payments will be a 
manageable $300 per month.)
On his way home, Bob stops to look at those golf clubs he’s been coveting, 
charges $800 on his credit card, and then, feeling slightly guilty, buys you the 
$600 set. (Pretend that you’re just starting to play golf.)
You may laugh at this scenario, but suppose that it really happened. 
Furthermore, pretend that you really do buy the minivan. At this point, you 
spent $6,400 on a van and golf clubs, and you’ve signed up for what you’re 
guessing will be another $300-per-month payment.
This turn of events doesn’t sound all that bad now, does it?
Here’s the problem: When you get your check, it’s not going to be $5,000. 
You’re probably going to pay roughly $400 in Social Security and Medicare 
taxes, and maybe around $1,500 in federal and state income taxes. Other 
money may be taken out, too, for forced savings plans — such as a 401(k) 
plan — or for charitable giving. After all is said and done, you get maybe half 
the bonus in cash — say $2,500.
Now you see the problem. You have $2,500 in cold hard cash, but with Bob’s 
help, you’ve already spent $6,400 and signed up for $300-per-month minivan 
payments.
In a nutshell, you face two big problems with windfalls:
	
✓	You never get the entire windfall, yet spending as if you will is quite 
easy.
	
✓	Windfalls, by their very nature, tend to get used for big purchases (often 
as down payments) that ratchet up your living expenses: boats, new 
houses, cars, etc.
	
Regarding windfalls, my advice to you is simple:
	
✓	Don’t spend a windfall until you actually hold the check in your hot little 
hand. (You’re even better off to wait, say, six months. That way, Bob can 
really think about whether he needs those new golf clubs.)
	
✓	Don’t spend a windfall on something that increases your monthly living 
expenses without first redoing your budget.

 Chapter 3: Maximum Fun, Maximum Profits
The problem with monster income changes
If your income changes radically, planning a budget becomes really hard. 
Suppose that your income more than doubles. One day you’re cruising 
along making $70,000, and the next day you’re suddenly making $170,000. 
(Congratulations, by the way.) I’ll tell you what you’ll discover, however, 
should you find yourself in this position: You’ll find that $170,000 a year isn’t 
as much money as you may think. (By the way, this business about monster 
income changes is true no matter what your income level. Like, if you’re 
cruising along making $500,000 and see your income rocket to $1,000,000, 
everything I’m saying here still applies.)
Go ahead. Laugh. But for one thing — if your income doubles, your income 
taxes almost certainly more than quadruple.
One of the great myths about income taxes is that the rich don’t pay very 
much or that they pay the same percentage. But that’s not actually true. If 
you make $70,000 per year and you have an average family, you might pay 
about $2,000 in federal income taxes. If you make $170,000 a year, though, 
you pay about $20,000 per year. So, if your salary slightly more than doubles 
from $70,000 to $170,000 (perhaps your spouse gets a really good job), your 
income taxes increase almost tenfold, going from $2,000 to $20,000. I don’t 
bring this fact up to get you agitated about whether it’s right or fair that you 
should pay a bunch of any extra income you make in taxes. I bring it up so 
that you can better plan for any monster income changes you experience.
Another thing — and I know it sounds crazy — is that you’ll find it hard to 
spend an extra $100,000 wisely when you’ve been making a lot less. And if 
you start making some big purchases, such as houses and cars and speed­
boats, you’ll not only burn through a great deal of cash, but you’ll also 
ratchet up your monthly living expenses.
Monster income changes that go the other way are even more difficult. If 
you’ve been making, say, $170,000 a year and then see your salary drop to 
a darn respectable $70,000, it’s going to hurt, too. And probably more than 
you think. That old living-expense ratcheting effect comes into play here. 
Presumably, if you’ve been making $170,000 a year, you’ve been spending 
it — or most of it.
But other reasons contribute — at least initially — to making a monster 
salary drop very difficult. You’ve probably chosen friends (nice people, 
such as the Joneses), clothing stores, and hobbies that are in line with your 
income.
Another thing about a monster salary drop is sort of subtle. You probably 
denominate your purchases in amounts related to your income. Make $70,000, 
and you think in terms of $10 purchases. But make $170,000 a year, and you 

50
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
think in terms of $20 purchases. This observation all makes perfect sense. But 
if your income drops from $170,000 down to $70,000, you’ll probably still find 
yourself thinking of those old $20 purchases.
So what to do? If you experience a monster income change, redo your Secret 
Plan. And be particularly careful and thoughtful.
Setting Up a Secret Plan
Okay, now you’re ready to set up your budget — er, I mean, Secret Plan.
Introducing the Budget window
To get to the window in which you enter your budget, click the Planning tab, 
open the Other Tools menu (by clicking on the Other Tools button), and then 
choose the Budget command. (Note: In some versions of Quicken, you open 
the Planning menu and then choose the Budget command.)
Quicken displays the Setup tab in the Budget window. Click the Automatic 
button if you want Quicken to create a starting budget using any exist­
ing financial data. Otherwise, click the Manual button. After you make this 
choice, click the Create Budget button.
If you indicate that you want to create an automatic budget by, essentially, 
recycling your old “actual numbers,” Quicken displays the Create Budget: 
Automatic dialog box, in which you can specify which old actual numbers to 
use (see Figure 3-1). This window allows you to
	
✓	Choose a date range to scan. Use the From and To boxes to identify the 
range of dates that span the months or the year you want to use.
	
✓	Select a budget method. Use the Select Budget Method option buttons 
and text box to indicate how you want Quicken to budget:
 
• Using average monthly amounts (the default)
 
• Using the exact monthly amounts
 
• Using the exact quarterly amounts
	
✓	Set your options. Use the Options check boxes to tell Quicken how to 
handle rounding and one-time, extraordinary transactions. (By default, 
Quicken rounds budget amounts to the nearest dollar and does not 
exclude one-time transactions.)

51
 Chapter 3: Maximum Fun, Maximum Profits
After you describe the automatic budget, click OK.
After you indicate that you want a manual budget (if you’re creating a manual 
budget) or after you describe how you want an automatic budget corrected 
(if you’re creating an automatic budget), Quicken displays the Choose 
Categories dialog box. When prompted, select the categories and accounts 
you want to budget and then click OK; Quicken next displays the Income tab 
in the Budget window, shown in Figure 3-2.

dialog box.
	
	
Figure 3-2:

tab in the

52
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
You use the Income tab to enter your budget for income amounts, and use 
the Expenses tab to budget for expense amounts. If you want to budget sav­
ings, you can enter these by using the Savings tab. (Budgeted savings, by 
the way, are just planned account transfers — money you plan to move, for 
example, into a savings account.)
Initially, none of the tabs show categories or accounts, which are what you 
use for your budgeting. To display categories and accounts, follow these 
three simple steps:
	
1.	Click the Choose Categories button so that Quicken displays the 
Choose Categories dialog box. (Or, if you’re looking at the Savings 
tab, click Choose Accounts so that Quicken displays the Choose 
Accounts dialog box.)
	
2.	Click the Mark All button.
	
3.	Click OK.
Categories or accounts appear along the left edge in the window (see Figure 
3-3). Any categories with subcategories (if you have these) contain subtotals 
for the total inflows and for the total outflows.

Categories 
(and sub-
categories) 
appear 
on the left 
side in the 
Budget 
window.
	

53
 Chapter 3: Maximum Fun, Maximum Profits
	
To move among the Income, Expenses, and Savings tabs, click the tabs.
In a pane along the right edge in the Budget window, Quicken displays option 
buttons and check boxes you use to budget the selected income, expense, or 
savings amount, which I talk about in the next section.
Entering budgeted amounts
To budget an income or expense amount, select the category and then enter 
the budget into the Amount box or boxes. Use the Method option buttons to 
specify how you want to budget the amount: using an average amount, using 
different monthly amounts (indicated by marking the Monthly Detail option 
button), or using different quarterly amounts (indicated by marking the 
Quarterly Detail option button). Different Amount text boxes appear for dif­
ferent budgeting methods. After you specify your budget amounts, click the 
Apply button (which is grayed out in Figure 3-4).
	
Figure 3-4: 
Enter a 
budget in 
the fields 
at the right 
side in the 
window.
	
As you enter amounts, Quicken updates any subtotals and grand totals that 
use those amounts.

54
Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
Reviewing the options
If you click the Options menu, which appears near the upper-right corner in 
the Budget window, Quicken displays a menu of several useful commands 
and switches:
	
✓	Save Budget: Saves a copy of the current budget.
	
✓	Restore Budget: Replaces whatever information shows in the Budget 
window with the information contained in the last saved copy of your 
budget.
	
✓	Show Cents: Turns on and off the display of cents. This baby is a real 
lifesaver if you need to literally watch your pennies.
	
✓	Separate View: Tells Quicken to separate income, expenses, and savings 
budgeting information on separate Income, Expenses, and Savings tabs.

Part I: Zen, Quicken, and the Big Picture 
What to do after you enter your budget
After you create your Secret Plan, you don’t have to do anything special to 
save your work. Oh, sure, you can tell Quicken to save your budget by choos­
ing Options➪Save Budget in the Budget window, but you don’t have to. When 
you leave the Budget window or close it, Quicken automatically saves your 
work for you.
If you want to revert to the previously saved version of the budget, choose 
Options➪Restore Budget in the Budget window.
I talk more about using the budget in later chapters (Chapter 7, for example). 
If you want to print a hard copy (computerese for paper) of the budget, 
choose Reports➪Spending➪Budget. If you have a printing question, go to 
Chapter 5.
You’re not going to use the Secret Plan for a while. But don’t worry; in 
Chapter 7, I explain how to print reports, including a report that compares 
your actual spending with, uh, your budget.

The Absolute 
Basics

In this part . . .
O
kay, you’re ready for the show to start (which is 
good). This part covers all the nitty-gritty details of 
using Quicken to keep your personal and business finan­
cial records. Whether you’re just starting to use the 
Quicken program or you’ve just come from Part I, you’ll 
find the stuff covered here dang important — dare I say, 
essential — to using Quicken in even the most basic way.

T
his is it. The big time. You’re finally going to do those everyday Quicken 
things: entering checks, deposits, and transfers. Along the way, you also 
use some of the neat tools that Quicken provides for making these tasks 
easier, more precise, and faster.
Getting Started
Okay. I’m going to start at the very beginning.
As you start working with Quicken, you probably want to work from the 
Banking tab (shown in Figure 4-1). Basically, it looks and works (sort of) like 
a Web page that provides clickable hyperlinks to some of the most popular 
banking and bookkeeping features of Quicken and supplies interesting tidbits 
of financial trivia.
	
If you don’t see the Banking tab, or window, you can click the Banking 
hyperlink, which appears at the left edge in the Quicken window in the 
Accounts bar.

60
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Figure 4-1: 
The Banking 
tab, or

Finding Your Checkbook
To enter checkbook transactions, use the Transactions tab in the Checking 
window (shown in Figure 4-2). If you can see the bank account you want to 
work with listed in the Accounts bar, you can click it to display that account’s 
Transactions tab. The Transactions tab looks and works like a check regis­
ter. If you don’t see the account anyplace, you can choose Banking➪Go to 
Banking and then select the account you want to work with.
Figure 4-2 shows the account name — Checking — to the left of the 
Transactions tab.
The starting balance you specified as part of setting up the account is the 
first amount that Quicken lists. In Figure 4-2, for example, the starting balance 
is $4.16. Bummer.

Recording Checks
First things first: You can enter checks by using the Banking tab and its reg­
ister (refer to Figure 4-2) or the Write Checks window, which I describe in 
Chapter 5.
You use the Banking tab’s register for the checks that you don’t want to print 
or pay electronically with Quicken; you use the Write Checks window to 
enter the checks that you do want to print or pay electronically with Quicken. 
(This rule isn’t etched in stone, but it does make things easier, so it’s the rule 
that I follow.)
Interested in online banking and bill payment?
If you want to know more about how Online Bill 
Payment and online banking work, read Chapter 
6. For now, just pay attention to how the Quicken 
register works. Everything you read about in 
this chapter will help you more easily use the 
Quicken Online Account Access feature.

62
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Entering a check in the register
Entering a check in the register is a simple matter of describing to whom you 
wrote the check and how much you paid. Suppose, for example, that you 
paid $25.50 to the cable television company for your monthly cable service. 
Here’s how you enter this check:
	
1.	Enter the check date.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Date field in the next empty row of the register (if 
it isn’t already there) and type the date by using the MM/DD format. To 
enter August 31, 2010, for example, type 8/31. You usually don’t have to 
type the year because Quicken retrieves the current year number from 
the little clock inside your computer.
	
	 You can adjust the date in a Date field by using the + and – keys on your 
keyboard. The + key adds one day to the current date; the – key sub­
tracts one day from the current date.
	
2.	Enter the check number.
	
	 Move the cursor (or tab) to the Num field and type the check number. 
Alternatively, move the cursor to the Num field and then, when Quicken 
displays a list box of entries (such as ATM, Deposit, EFT, Next Check 
Number, Print Check, Send Online Payment, and Transfer Funds), select 
Next Check Number if you want. Quicken then fills in the number with its 
guess as to the new check number — one more than the previous check 
number you entered. If this guess is right, you can just leave it in place. 
If it isn’t right, type over what Quicken guessed with the correct number 
or use the + or – key to increase or decrease the check number.
	
3.	Enter the payee.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Payee field. Type the name of the person or busi­
ness you’re paying. If the cable company’s name is Movies Galore, for 
example, type Movies Galore. (In the future, you can probably select 
payee names in the Payee list box.)
	
4.	Enter the check amount.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Payment field and type the check amount — 
25.50 in this example. You don’t have to type the dollar sign, but you do 
need to type the period to indicate the decimal place and cents.
	
5.	Enter the category.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Category field. Quicken displays a drop-down 
list box of category names from your category list. You can select one 
of these categories by using the arrow keys or the mouse. Or, if you’re 
the independent type, just type the name yourself. For example, if you 
use the standard Quicken categories list, you may categorize a payment 
to your cable company as Utilities: Cable TV. The first part of this entry, 
Utilities, is the category. The second part, Cable TV, is the subcategory.

63
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
	
	 If you go with the typing approach and you’re not a superfast typist, 
Quicken can probably guess which category you’re entering before you 
enter it. When you start typing Ut, for example, Quicken fills in the rest 
of the category name — ilities for you (Ut + ilities = Utilities). This fea­
ture is called QuickFill, and I talk about it in more detail in the section, 
“Working with a kooky (and clever) little thing named QuickFill,” later in 
this chapter.
	
6.	(Optional) Tag that transaction.
	
	 If, after reading about tags in Chapter 2, you decided to use tags, you 
can also enter a tag in the Category field. Just to make this a bit clearer, 
suppose that you’re using tags to segregate expenses by house because 
you actually own two homes: your principal residence and a cabin in the 
mountains. If you’ve set up two tags — principal and cabin — you record 
utilities expenses for your principal residence by entering utilities/prin­
cipal in the Category field. You record utilities expenses for your cabin 
by entering utilities/cabin in the Category field.
	
7.	(Optional) Enter a memo description.
	
	 If you’re using the Two-Line Display mode, move the cursor to the Memo 
field and describe the specific reason that you’re paying the check. You 
may identify the cable payment as the June payment, for example. If 
you’re using Quicken for a business, use this field to identify the paid 
invoice — usually by entering the invoice number you’re paying. You 
don’t have to enter anything in this field, by the way.
	
8.	Click the Enter button.
	
	 Click the Enter button that appears in the transaction’s row of the reg­
ister. This option tells Quicken that you want to record the transaction 
into your register. Quicken beeps in acknowledgment, calculates the 
new account balance, and moves the cursor to the next slot, or row, in 
the register.
A neat little trick
You can expand and edit the list box of Num 
entries that Quicken displays. If you want to add 
some new Num entry to the Num drop-down list 
box, for example, do the following:
	 1.	 Click the Edit List button, which appears at 
the bottom of the Num drop-down list.
	
	 Quicken displays the Edit Num List dialog 
box.
	 2.	 Click the New button and then complete 
the dialog box that Quicken displays.
	
	 You can also remove any new Num entries 
you add by using the Edit Num List dialog 
box.
I won’t spend anymore time describing how 
this works, so if you want to figure it all out, just 
experiment. You can’t hurt anything.

64
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Figure 4-3 shows the cable television check recorded into the register. You 
can’t see it in this black-and-white figure, but the –21.34 in the Balance field 
is in red after the $25.50 check is recorded. This red number indicates that 
you’ve overdrawn your account. I don’t need to tell you what that means: 
overdraft charges.

Changing a check you’ve entered
What if you need to change a check that you’ve already entered? Suppose 
that you make a terrible mistake, such as recording a $52.50 check as $25.20. 
Can you fix it? Sure. Just use the arrow keys or click the mouse to highlight 
the check transaction that you want to change. Use the Tab and Shift+Tab 
keys to move the cursor to the field you want to change. (You can also select 
the field by clicking in it with the mouse.) Then make your fix. Click the Enter 
button when you finish or press Enter on the keyboard.

65
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
Packing more checks into the register
Normally, Quicken displays a single row of information about each check that 
you enter. It also displays a single row of information about each of the other 
types of transactions you enter. If you want to show more transaction infor­
mation, click the Account Actions button (which appears near the top-right 
corner of the register) and then choose the Two-Line Display command on 
the menu that Quicken displays. After you do, Quicken displays all the regis­
ter information in a double-line format (shown in Figure 4-4). To return to the 
single-line format, click the Account Actions button and choose the Two-Line 
Display again.
	
Figure 4-4: 
How the 
register 
looks with 
the Two-
Line Display 
format.
	
Sorting transactions
If you click the Account Actions button, you notice that it also displays a 
bunch of other commands, in addition to the Two-Line Display command I 
talk about in the preceding paragraph. Most of these commands I talk about 

66
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
elsewhere in this book, but let me mention one set of the commands here. If 
you choose the Sorting Options command, Quicken displays a submenu of 
commands that begin with Sort. These commands all work the same basic 
way. They let you reorganize the transactions shown in the register in some 
new way: by date, amount, check number, and so on.
Don’t worry. I’m not going to waste your precious time telling you things 
such as that the Sort By Date command sorts transactions by their dates 
or that the Sort By Amount (Largest First) command sorts transactions by 
descending size of the transaction amounts.
	
If you point to the column heading for the Payee field, the Payment field, or 
the Cleared Status field (labeled with Clr), Quicken displays a pop-up com­
mand that you can use to re-sort the transactions in the register. These 
options are self-explanatory. The one that appears when you point to the 
Payee field is Sort Payees In Alphabetic Order. And the one that appears 
when you point to the Cleared Status field is Sort Transactions Into Groups of 
Reconciled, Cleared, and Uncleared Transactions. You get the picture.
Working with a kooky (and clever) 
little thing named QuickFill
Here’s kind of a funny quirk about Quicken: If Quicken can guess what you’re 
typing in a field, it fills in the rest of the field for you. Earlier in this chapter, I 
mention how this QuickFill feature works when you type category names. But 
it gets even better than that.
The second time you use a payee name, for example, Quicken knows that 
it’s the second time. Quicken also figures that, “Hey, some stuff from the last 
Movies Galore transaction will probably be the same for this transaction.” 
When you type the first few letters of the payee name, Quicken supplies a 
payee name for you. After you press the Tab key to accept the name, Quicken 
uses the last transaction’s information to fill in all the current transaction’s 
fields.
This feature is a real time-saver. Suppose that you did write a $25.50 check 
to Movies Galore for your June cable television bill. When you type Movies 
Galore to record July’s cable television check, the amount will probably be 
the same. The complete payee name will certainly be the same, and the cat­
egory will also be the same. So Quicken fills in all these fields, too.
QuickFill doesn’t do everything for you, however. You still need to make sure 
that the date and check number are correct. If Quicken QuickFills a field with 
the wrong information, just replace the wrong information with the right 
information.

67
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
Recording Deposits
Recording a deposit works almost the same way as recording a check. The 
only difference is that you enter the deposit amount in the Deposit field 
rather than enter the check amount in the Payment field.
Entering a deposit into the register
Suppose that you receive $100 as a birthday gift from your elderly Aunt 
Enid and deposit it into your checking account. Here’s how you record this 
deposit in the register:
	
1.	Enter the deposit date.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Date field of the next empty row of the register 
(if it isn’t already there) and type the date. Use the MM/DD format. You 
enter August 31, 2010, for example, as 8/31. As with check dates, you 
have to enter the year only if the current year number, which Quicken 
retrieves from the little clock inside your computer, is wrong.
	
	 You can adjust the date in a Date field in Quicken by using the + and – 
keys. The + key adds one day to the current date; the – key subtracts 
one day from the current date.
Memorized payees
Quicken provides another feature — memo­
rized payees — which is almost irrelevant to 
day-to-day Quicken use now that the QuickFill 
feature exists. But because you may hear about 
this tool, I briefly describe how it works.
A memorized payee is one that you’ve stored 
or that Quicken has stored in a special list. (To 
store the transaction, you select it in the regis­
ter and choose Edit➪Transaction➪Memorize 
Payee.)
To later use or abuse a memorized transaction, 
choose Tools➪Memorized Payee List to display 
a list of previously memorized payees. When 
Quicken displays the list, select the payee you 
want to reuse and click Use.
A memorized payees list is a handy tool. But if 
you’re feeling a little overwhelmed, don’t spin 
your wheels trying to get up to speed on this 
feature. QuickFill almost always does the job 
for you because — get this — it automatically 
grabs memorized payees from the list.

68
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
2.	Type the code DEP (for deposit) in the Num field.
	
	 Are you the meticulous type? Then go ahead and move the cursor to the 
Num field. Open the Num drop-down list box and select Deposit.
	
3.	Type the name of the person from whom you received the deposit.
	
	 In this case, move the cursor to the Payee field and type Aunt Enid. (I 
don’t mean to sound presumptuous, but, well, the next time Aunt Enid 
sends you birthday money, you can select her name in the Payee drop-
down list box.)
	
4.	Enter the deposit amount.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Deposit field and type 100. Don’t type the dollar 
sign — or any other punctuation. (If Aunt Enid sweats money and some­
times passes out $1,000 gifts, for example, you record the deposit as 
1000 — not 1,000 or $1,000.)
	
5.	Enter the category.
	
	 You know how this works by now. Move the cursor to the Category 
field. Open the Category drop-down list box, if necessary, and select 
the appropriate category. Alternatively, if you like living on the edge, 
try typing the category name. You might describe Aunt Enid’s check as 
Other Inc.
	
	 To add a category, type a name in the Category field and move to 
another field. When Quicken doesn’t recognize the category name, it 
asks you whether you want to add the category. Click Yes, and Quicken 
displays the Set Up Category dialog box. See Chapter 2 if you have ques­
tions about how this works.
	
6.	(Optional) Enter a memo description.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Memo field and describe something, such as the 
reason for the deposit. Aunt Enid’s money may be described as birthday 
gift. If you’re a business depositing a customer’s check, use this entry to 
identify the invoice the customer is paying.
	
7.	Click the Enter button.
	
	 This command tells Quicken that you want to record the transaction in 
your register. Quicken beeps in protest but then adds the transaction.
Figure 4-5 shows the Checking register (in the Two-Line Display format) after 
you enter Aunt Enid’s thoughtful gift. Your account is no longer overdrawn — 
so you have that going for you. Maybe before you go any further, you should 
call Aunt Enid to thank her.

69
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
	
See the ending balance given at the bottom in the register window? The 
Ending Balance shows the account balance after every register transaction. If 
you enter future-dated transactions, the register window shows both a current 
balance — the balance as of the current date — and an ending balance, which 
is the balance after all the transactions.
	
Figure 4-5: 
A Checking 
register as

Quicken also includes a Paycheck Setup Wizard that you can use to describe 
the taxes withheld from your paycheck and categorize the deductions from 
your paycheck. That much said, you probably don’t need to keep track of these 
amounts unless, for some reason, you want precise estimates of the income 
taxes you pay. Remember that your employer already does this accounting. 
Also remember that you must use the employer’s data, which appears on your 
W-2 form — and not your Quicken data — when you prepare your U.S. taxes. If 
you do decide to use the Paycheck Wizard, just click the Setup tab and then 
click its Add Paycheck button. Quicken launches the Paycheck Setup Wizard, 
which asks you a few general questions about your deductions and then pro­
vides a dialog box similar to a Split Transaction window where you can enter 
and categorize your deductions. For more information about splitting transac­
tions, see the “Splitting Transactions” section, later in this chapter.

70
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Changing a deposit you’ve already entered
Big surprise here — changing a deposit works just like changing a check. 
First, use the arrow keys or click with the mouse to select the deposit. Use 
the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to move the cursor to the field you want to 
change. Tab moves the cursor to the next field. Shift+Tab moves the cursor 
to the previous field. (You can also select the field by clicking in it with the 
mouse.) Then make your fix and click the Enter button.
Recording Account Transfers
Account transfers occur when you move money from one account, such as 
your savings account, to another account, such as your checking account. 
But jeepers, why am I telling you this? If you have one of those combined sav­
ings and checking accounts, you probably do this sort of thing all the time.
Oh, now I remember why I brought this up — Quicken makes quick work of 
account transfers as long as you already have both accounts set up.
If you don’t have the second account set up, you need to do that first. If you 
don’t know how, flip to Chapter 2.
Entering an account transfer
Buckle up. I speed through the steps for recording an account transfer. For 
the most part, you record an account transfer the same way you record a 
check or deposit.
Suppose that you want to record the transfer of $50 from your checking 
account to your money market account. Maybe you want to set aside a little 
money — little, presumably, being a key adjective — to purchase a gift for 
your generous Aunt Enid.
Say that you’re working with your checking account and want to record a 
transfer to your money market account. Here’s what you need to do:
	
1.	Enter the transfer date.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Date field. Then type the date that you move the 
money from one account to another.

71
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
	
2.	Flag the transaction as a transfer.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Num field. Open the drop-down list box and 
select the Transfer entry. Quicken abbreviates transfer as TXFR.
	
3.	Enter a description of the transaction.
	
	 Use the Description field to describe the transfer — for example, Birthday. 
You know how this works by now, don’t you? You just move the cursor to 
the field. Then you pound away at the keyboard. Bang. Bang. Bang.
	
4.	Enter the transfer amount.
	
	 You enter amounts that you transfer out of an account in the Payment 
field, and you enter amounts that you transfer into an account in the 
Deposit field. So move the cursor to the right field (right as in right and 
wrong, not right and left) and then enter the transfer amount.
	
5.	Indicate the other account.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Category field, which has a modified name of 
Xfer Acct (standing for Transfer Account). When Quicken drops down 
a list box of accounts, select the other account. In Figure 4-6, I show 
the transfer as going to an account named Money Market. I set up this 
account secretly, while you weren’t watching. But note that the steps for 
setting up a second bank account parallel those for setting up a check­
ing account. See Chapter 2 for more information.
	
6.	(Optional) Enter a memo description.
	
	 Enter more information about the transaction (if you need to) in the 
Memo field. Perhaps a gift idea for Aunt Enid?
	
7.	Click the Enter button.
	
	 This command tells Quicken that you want to record the transfer trans­
action into your register.
Figure 4-6 shows the Checking register after you transfer money from your 
checking account to your savings account so that you’ll have money to 
purchase something nice for Aunt Enid’s next birthday — maybe that new 
Raconteurs CD.
	
Take a look at the Category field. Notice that Quicken uses brackets — [ ] — to 
identify the Category field entry as an account and not as an income or 
expense category.

Working with the other half of the transfer
Here’s the cool thing about transfer transactions: Quicken automatically 
records the other half of the transfer for you. Figure 4-6 shows the $50 reduc­
tion in the checking account because of the transfer. Quicken uses this 
information to record a $50 increase in the savings account. Automatically. 
Biddabam. Biddaboom.
To see the other half of a transfer transaction, right-click the transfer trans­
action and choose the Go To Matching Transfer command on the shortcut 
menu. Quicken displays the other account in a new register window, shown 
in Figure 4-7.
Changing a transfer you’ve 
already entered
Predictably, this activity works just like changing a check or a deposit:
	
1.	Select the transfer by using the arrow keys or by clicking the mouse.

73
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
	
2.	Use the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to move the cursor to the field that 
you want to change.
	
3.	Make your fix, click the Enter button, and then go to lunch.

Splitting Transactions
Here’s a sort of Quicken riddle for you: Suppose that you have a check that 
pays more than one kind of expense. You trot down to the grocery store, for 
example, and pick up $10 worth of junk food and junk beverages (which you 
should categorize as a Groceries expense) and $10 worth of 10W-40 motor oil 
(which you should categorize as an Auto expense). How do you categorize a 
transaction like this? Well, I’ll tell you. You use a split category.
Here’s how a split category works: When you’re ready to categorize the 
check, you click the Split button, and Quicken displays the Split Transaction 
window, shown in Figure 4-8.

74
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Figure 4-8: 
The Split 
Transaction 
window.
	
Steps for splitting a check
Being a clever sort, you probably already know how the Split Transaction 
window works. I go through the steps anyway. Suppose that you want to cat­
egorize a $20 check that includes $10 for groceries and $10 for motor oil.
To categorize a check in the Split Transaction window, do the following:
	
1.	Enter the first category name in the first Category field.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Category field (if it isn’t already there). Activate 
the drop-down list box by pressing Alt+S or by clicking the down arrow 
and then selecting the category name.
	
	 (Despite what a dietitian may say, you can call the soda and candy 
Groceries.)
	
2.	(Optional) Tag the first categorized portion of the check.
	
	 If you’re using tags to further classify your spending, move the cursor 
to the first Tag field and then type the tag. If you have no idea what I’m 
talking about here, either just forget I said anything, or see the final 
paragraphs of Chapter 2.
	
3.	Enter a memo description for the first categorized portion of the 
check.
	
	 Move the cursor to the first Memo field and then type whatever you 
want. (Maybe a description of the food you bought. Er, then again, 
maybe if you’re buying real junk, you should just leave this blank.)

75
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
	
4.	Enter the amount spent for the first category.
	
	 Move the cursor to the first Amount field and then type, well, the 
amount. If the first category is what you’re calling Groceries and you 
spent $10 on this, you type 10.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 1–4 for each spending category.
	
	 If you spent another $10 on motor oil, for example, move the cursor 
to the second Category field and enter the category and, optionally, 
the subcategory you use to summarize auto maintenance expenses. In 
Figure 4-9, for example, I use the category-subcategory combination 
Auto:Service. Optionally, tag the transaction. Optionally (again), move 
the cursor to the second Memo field and enter a memo description 
of the expenditure, such as motor oil. Move the cursor to the second 
Amount field and enter the amount of the expenditure, such as 10.
	
	 Figure 4-9 shows a Split Transaction window that is complete. A split 
transaction can have up to 30 pieces. Use the scroll bar and PgUp and 
PgDn keys to scroll through the list of split amounts.
	
6.	Verify that the Split Transaction window shows no uncategorized 
spending.
	
	 If you find extra spending — this shows up as the Remainder amount — 
either add the category you need or delete the split transaction line that’s 
uncategorized. To delete a split transaction line, move the cursor to one 
of the fields in the line and choose Edit➪Delete. You can also click the 
Adjust button to get rid of the Remainder amount — but in this case, 
Quicken adjusts the amount originally entered into the register so that it 
agrees with the details you’ve supplied in the Split Transaction window.

	 If you want to insert a new line, move the selection cursor to the line 
above where you want to make your insertion and choose Edit➪Insert. If 
you’re fed up and want to start over from scratch, choose Edit➪Clear All 
(which causes Quicken to erase all the split transaction lines).
	
7.	Click OK.
	
	 After you complete the Split Transaction window — that is, after you 
completely and correctly categorize all the little pieces of the transac­
tion — click OK. Quicken closes the Split Transaction window. If you 
didn’t enter an amount in the Payment column of the register before 
opening the Split Transaction window, Quicken displays a dialog box 
that asks whether the transaction is a payment or a deposit. You select 
an option button to make your choice known.
	
	 To let you know that the transaction is one that you’ve split, the 
Category field shows --Split-- when you select the split transaction 
to show that you’ve split a transaction among categories or tags. Take a 
peek at Figure 4-10 to see for yourself.
	
8.	Click the Enter button.
	
	 This command tells Quicken that you want to record the transaction in 
your register.

 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
Editing and deleting split categories
You can delete or change any individual line of a split category. To do so, 
first select the transaction (to display the Split Transaction window) and 
then click the check mark button, which appears in the register’s Category 
field after you record the transaction. After Quicken dutifully displays the 
Split Transaction window, you can edit a field by selecting it and then typing 
over its contents. You can delete any line of the split category by choosing 
Edit➪Delete. (If you want to delete all the lines of the split category so that 
you can start over, choose Clear All instead.)
If you want to unsplit the transaction so that you can assign it to a single 
category, you need to use a little trick. Click the X button that appears in the 
register’s Category field after you record the transaction.
Steps for splitting deposits and transfers
Wondering whether you can split deposits and transfers? Well, you can. The 
steps for doing so work just like the steps for splitting categories for a check 
transaction. The basic trick — if you can call it a trick — is to use the Split 
Transaction window to list all the category names and amounts.
Splitting hairs
Quicken assumes that any transaction amount 
you enter in the register should agree with the 
total of the individual split transaction amounts 
entered in the Split Transaction window.
If you’re not sure what the split transaction 
amount’s total is, your best bet is to NOT — 
I repeat, NOT — enter the amount on the 
Transactions tab. Instead, enter the indi­
vidual split transaction amounts in the Split 
Transaction window. When you leave the Split 
Transaction window, Quicken totals your indi­
vidual split amounts, and then prompts you to 
see whether the total is a payment or a deposit. 
Then it plugs this total into either the Payment 
or the Deposit field.
If you’ve already entered either a payment 
amount or a deposit amount, but you’re not 
sure that the split transaction amounts agree 
with what you entered, you can tell Quicken to 
adjust the Payment or Deposit amount on the 
Transactions tab to whatever the individual 
split transaction amounts total. To do so, click 
the Split Transaction window’s Adjust button. 
Quicken then adds the split transaction lines 
and plugs the total into the register. (This 
approach may best be called, “I don’t care if 
it’s a round hole; I want to pound this square 
peg into it.”)
By the way, Quicken shows any difference 
between the amount shown on the Transactions 
tab and the individual split transaction amounts. 
It shows this difference as the last split transac­
tion line, so you can tell whether the individual 
splits agree with the payment or deposit amount 
shown in the register.

78
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
One other point I should make here is that you can mix and match categories 
and transfers in the Split Transaction window. Some of the splits, for example, 
can be categories, and some can be transfer accounts. This type of transac­
tion is common in a business setting. (See Chapter 15 for more information.)
Deleting and Voiding Transactions
You can delete and void register transactions by using the Edit button’s 
Delete and Void Transaction(s) commands. If you’ve looked at the Edit 
button — it appears just beneath the selected transaction when you’re enter­
ing data — you’ve probably already guessed as much.
Using either command is a snap: Just highlight the transaction you want to 
delete or void by using the arrow keys or by clicking the mouse. Then click 
the Edit button and choose the command. And that’s that.
Use the Void Transaction(s) command any time you void a check. Quicken 
leaves voided transactions in the register but marks them as void and erases 
the Payment or Deposit amount. So by using the Void Transaction(s) com­
mand, you keep a record of voided, or canceled, transactions.
Use the Delete command if you want to remove the transaction from your 
register.
Sort of a voiding bug . . .
When you mark a transaction as void — you 
do this by selecting a transaction and choos­
ing Edit➪Transaction➪Void Transaction(s) — 
Quicken does three things: It sticks VOID in the 
start of the Payee field, it marks the transac­
tion as cleared, and it erases the amount in the 
Payment or Deposit field. So far, so good. But if 
you later fill in the Payment or Deposit field and 
don’t pay attention to the warning from Quicken 
that you’re editing a reconciled transaction, 
Quicken uses the payment or deposit amount 
that you enter to adjust the account balance — 
even though Quicken still shows the transaction 
as void. I keep thinking the folks at Intuit will 
fix this, but they haven’t — at least not yet. The 
bottom line is that you need to make sure that 
you don’t edit transactions after you void them. 
Otherwise, you can all too easily foul up your 
account balance — perhaps even overdraw 
your account. I won’t tell you about how I hap­
pened to learn this. . . .

 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
The Big Register Phenomenon
If you start entering a bunch of checks, deposits, and transfers into your reg­
isters, you’ll soon find yourself with registers that contain hundreds and even 
thousands of transactions. You can still work with one of these big registers 
by using the tools and techniques I talk about in the preceding paragraphs. 
Nevertheless, let me give you some more help for dealing with . . . (drumroll, 
please) . . . the big register phenomenon.
Moving through a big register
You can use the PgUp and PgDn keys to page up and down through your 
register a screenful of transactions at a time. Some people call this scrolling. 
You can call it whatever you want.
You can press Ctrl+Home to move to the first transaction in a register and 
Ctrl+End to move to the last transaction in a register.
You can also use the vertical scroll bar along the right edge of the Transactions 
tab. Click either above or below the square scroll bar marker to page back and 
forth through the register. Or, if you have no qualms about dragging the mouse 
around, you can drag the scroll bar marker up and down the scroll bar. If you 
drag the scroll bar marker to scroll through the register, Quicken displays a 
pop-up box that shows the transaction date you’ve scrolled to.
Finding that darn transaction
Want to find a specific check, deposit, or transfer? No problem. The Find 
command provides a handy way for doing just that. Here’s what you do:
	
1.	Choose Edit➪Find & Replace➪Find, or click the Find button on the 
Transactions tab.
	
	 Quicken, with restrained but obvious enthusiasm, displays the Quicken 
Find dialog box (shown in Figure 4-11). You use this dialog box to 
describe the transaction you want to find in as much detail as possible. 
(Notice that you don’t choose the Edit command on the Transactions 
tab to get to this command; you click the menu bar’s Edit menu.)

80
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Figure 4-11: 
The Quicken 
Find dialog 
box.
	
	
2.	Enter the piece of text or number that identifies the transaction you 
want to locate.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Find text box. Then type the text or number. By 
the way, the case of the text doesn’t matter. If you type aunt, for exam­
ple, Quicken finds AUNT or Aunt.
	
3.	Specify which pieces, or fields, of the register transaction you want 
Quicken to look at.
	
	 Click the down arrow to the right of the Search list box; then in the 
drop-down list, select the field that Quicken should look at during the 
search: Amount, Cleared Status (the Clr field), Memo, Date, Category/
Class (whatever is in the Category field), Check Number (what’s in the 
Num field), or Payee. Or get truly crazy and pick the All Fields list entry 
so that Quicken looks both high and low.
	
4.	Tell Quicken whether you’re using a shotgun or a rifle.
	
	 You need to specify how closely what you stuck in the Find text box 
needs to match whatever you selected in the Search drop-down list box. 
To do so, open the Match If drop-down list box. Then select the appro­
priate matching rule:
 
• Contains: Select this rule if the field or fields you’re searching just 
need to use a piece of text. If you enter Aunt into the Find text box 
and use this matching rule to search Payee fields, Quicken finds 
transactions that use the following payee names: Aunt Enid, Aunt 
Enid and Uncle Joob, Uncle Harry and Aunt Edna, and — well, you 
get the idea.
 
• Exact: Select this rule if the field you’re searching needs to exactly 
match your Find text box entry. If you enter the Find text box entry 
as Aunt, for example, and you’re searching Payee fields, Quicken 
looks for transactions where the Payee field shows Aunt — and 
nothing more and nothing less.
 
• Starts With: Select this rule if the field you’re searching for just 
needs to start with what you entered in the Find text box. For 
example, if you enter Aunt in the Find text box, and you’re 

81
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
searching the Payee fields, Quicken looks for transactions where 
the Payee field starts with the word Aunt — such as Aunt Enid or 
Aunt Enid and Uncle Joob. (Uncle Joob and Aunt Enid wouldn’t cut 
the mustard in this case, though.)
 
• Ends With: Select this rule if the field you’re searching for just 
needs to end with what you entered in the Find text box.
 
• Greater: Select this rule if the field you’re searching for needs to 
hold a value that exceeds the number you entered in the Find text 
box. This makes sense, right? Like you’re looking for checks you 
wrote for more than $100?
 
• Greater Or Equal: Select this rule if the field you’re searching for 
needs to hold a value that either exceeds or equals the number 
you entered in the Find text box.
 
• Less: Select this rule if the field you’re searching for needs to hold a 
value that is less than the number you entered in the Find text box.
 
• Less Or Equal: Select this rule if the field you’re searching for 
needs to hold a value that is less than or equal to the number you 
entered in the Find text box.
	
5.	Tell Quicken whether you want it to search forward or backward from 
the selected transaction.
	
	 Select the Search Backwards check box if you want to look backward 
starting from the selected transaction.
	
6.	Let the search begin.
	
	 You click either the Find or the Find All button to begin the search. If 
you click Find, Quicken looks through the register, and if it can find a 
transaction like you describe, it highlights the transaction.
	
	 If you click Find All, Quicken looks through the register and builds a 
list of all the transactions that are like the one you describe. Then it 
displays the list in an expanded version of the Search Results window 
(shown in Figure 4-12). To edit a found transaction, select the transac­
tion and click the Edit Transaction(s) button.
Quicken supplies another command that is similar to Find. The Edit menu 
Find/Replace command lets you both locate and modify transactions that 
look like the one you describe. (To use the Find/Replace command, choose 
Edit➪Find & Replace➪Find/Replace.) For example, you may want to locate 
transactions showing Aunt Enid as the payee so that you can replace Aunt 
with Great Aunt. The Find/Replace command works in a similar fashion 
to the Find command except that you need to describe what you want to 

82
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
modify in the found transactions. After you complete the initial dialog box 
that Quicken displays when you choose the command, Quicken displays a 
window listing the transactions it has found. (This window looks like the 
one shown in Figure 4-13.) You mark — by clicking — the transactions you 
want to modify, describe the replacement information, and then click the 
Replace button.

action that 
matches 
the search 
criteria.
	
	
Figure 4-13: 
The Find 
And 
Replace 
dialog box.
	
You can’t use the Find/Replace command to find and replace categories, 
but you can use another command: Recategorize. (To use the Recategorize 
command, choose Edit➪Find & Replace➪Recategorize.) For example, 
you may want to recategorize all your cable television payments as the 
Entertainment category (where earlier, you placed them in the Utilities 

83
 Chapter 4: Checkbook on a Computer
category). When you choose the Recategorize command, Quicken displays 
the Recategorize window (shown in Figure 4-14). Enter the category you 
want to replace in the Find Category text box and the new replacement cat­
egory in the Recategorize Selected Transaction(s) With text box. Next, click 
the Find All button to tell Quicken to display a list of transactions that use 
the category you want to replace. Click the transactions you want to recat­
egorize (to mark them), supply the replacement category, and then click 
the Recategorize button.

Pop-Up Calendars and Calculators
Can I tell you just a couple more things? (If not, skip this section. If so, read 
on.) Quicken provides a pop-up calendar anytime you move the selection 
cursor to a Date field. To get to the calendar, click the button that appears 
at the right end of the Date field. Quicken displays a calendar for the current 
month (shown in Figure 4-15). All you have to do is select the day you want 
as the date. (If you want to see a calendar for a different month, click the << 
and >> buttons.)
Quicken also provides a pop-up calculator anytime you move the selection 
cursor to an Amount field. To get to the calculator, click the button that 
appears at the right end of the Amount field.
Quicken displays a calculator like the one shown in Figure 4-16 when you 
choose the Tools➪Calculator command. This baby works like a regular hand­
held calculator. You just type the math you want to perform. Quicken dis­
plays the calculation result in the Amount field.

If you type a number in the Amount field and then type any one of the math 
operand keys (+, –, /, *), Quicken pops open the calculator to continue the cal­
culation. You don’t have to click the calculator button first.
Attaching Flags, Notes, and Images
Inside the register window, just to the right of the Split button, Quicken pro­
vides an Attach button. If you wouldn’t mind, take a minute and see if you can 
find the Attach button — it shows a picture of a paper clip.
Okay, here’s why this button may interest you: When you click this button, 
Quicken displays a menu of commands that you can use to attach a follow-
up flag, a little note, or even a PDF image of the check or other receipt. You 
choose the command that corresponds to the flag, note, or image you want 
to attach, or connect, to the register transaction. Quicken then displays a 
dialog box that you use to provide the flag or note or to identify the PDF file 
that holds the check or receipt image.

Chapter 5
Printing 101
In This Chapter
▶	Printing a check
▶	Recovering from a mistake after you’ve printed the check
▶	Printing a register
I
bet you can’t guess what this chapter describes. Gee, you guessed it — 
how to print checks and reports.
Printing Checks
Printing checks in Quicken is, well, quick. All you basically need to do is enter 
the information you want to print on the check form and the number you 
want Quicken to use to identify the check. Sounds simple enough, doesn’t it? 
It is, as you can read in the steps that follow.
To enter the information on a check form, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the Write Checks window.
	
	 You can display the Write Checks window in a bunch of different ways. 
For example, when the register shows in the Banking tab, you click the 
Banking Actions button and choose the Write and Print Checks com­
mand. And when the Banking tab’s register shows, you can also click the 
Account Actions button and choose the Write and Price Checks com­
mand. You can also use the command shortcut, Ctrl+W. Figure 5-1 shows 
the Write Checks: Checking window.
	
2.	Select the account on which you want to write the check.
	
	 This step is very important! To select the account you want to use, open 
the Write Checks From drop-down list in the top of the window. (You 
can do this by clicking the arrow button that’s just to the right of the 
box.) When Quicken displays the list of accounts, choose the one you 
want to use.

88
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Figure 5-1: 
The Write 
Checks: 
Checking 
window.
	
	
3.	Enter the check date.
	
	 First, use the mouse or Tab key to move the cursor to the Date field. 
Then, type the date that you’re going to print the check (probably 
today’s date). Remember to type the date in a MM/DD/YYYY format — 
enter August 31, 2010, as 8/31/2010. You don’t need to enter the year if 
the year number that Quicken retrieves from your computer’s internal 
system clock is correct. You can adjust the date by a day by using + 
and – from the numeric keypad. You can also click the button at the 
end of the Date field to display your friend, the pop-up calendar.
	
4.	Enter the name of the person or business you’re paying.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Pay To The Order Of field and type away. For 
example, to write a check to me, type Steve Nelson. (Feel free to do so, 
by the way. If you send me a check, I’ll even cash it as a sort of public 
service.) If you’ve written a check to the payee before, when you start to 
type the name, Quicken recognizes it and fills in the rest for you.
	
5.	Enter the amount of the check.
	
	 Move the cursor to the $ text box and type the amount. (If you’re send­
ing a check to me, be sure to make the amount nominal — for sure, 
not more than $10 or $20. . . .) When you press the Tab key, the cursor 
moves down to the next field, and Quicken writes the amount in words 
on the line under the payee name and before the word Dollars.

89
 Chapter 5: Printing 101
	
6.	Enter the payee’s address.
	
	 If you plan to mail the check in a window envelope, move the cursor to 
the Address field. (You can do this by clicking in the field.) Then enter 
the name and address of the person or business you’re paying.
	
	 Here’s a little address entry trick: You can copy the payee name from 
the Pay To The Order Of text box to the first line of the Address field. 
Click the mouse in or select the first line of the address field. Then press 
the ’ (apostrophe) key. Now fill in the rest of the address block, includ­
ing the street number and name, city, state, and ZIP code. After you 
enter this, Quicken memorizes these address details for the next time 
you use this payee.
	
7.	(Optional) Enter a memo description of the check.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Memo field and enter a description (such as 
an account number or an invoice number) of why you’re sending your 
money to this person or business. Or, if you’re sending someone a check 
because you didn’t have time to go out and buy a real gift, type Happy 
Birthday in the Memo field. It’s the little things that make a difference.
	
8.	Enter the category.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Category field and type the category name for 
the expense you’re paying with the check. If you don’t remember the 
category name, scroll down the category list to find the category. Figure 
5-2 shows the completed window for a check payable to Movies Galore, 
the local cable TV company.
	
	 You can assign a check to more than a single category by using the 
Split Transaction window. Using the Split Transaction window with 
the Write Checks window works the same way as using the Split 
Transaction window with the Transactions tab. (I describe using the 
Split Transaction window with the Transactions tab in Chapter 4.) Okay. 
So why do I bring this up? You use the Split Transaction window when 
a check pays more than one type of expense or is transferred to more 
than one account.
	
	 For example, if you’re writing a check to pay your mortgage, with part of 
the check paying the actual mortgage and part of the check going into 
an escrow account for property taxes, you can use the Split Transaction 
window to describe the transaction’s individual components. To split 
a check amount so that the amount is assigned to multiple spending 
categories, click the Split button or press Ctrl+S. Either way, Quicken 
displays the Split Transaction window for you to indicate the categories 
and categorized amounts that make up the check total. If you have ques­
tions about how split transactions work, refer to Chapter 4.

90
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Figure 5-2: 
A completed 
check.
	
	
9.	Click the Record Check button.
	
	 Quicken records the check. It displays the current account balance and 
the ending account balance, and it even adds a Checks To Print total in 
the bottom of the window. If you’re working with a monitor that sup­
ports a high screen resolution, you’ll also see a Checks To Print window 
that lists all the nitty-gritty about the checks you have to print, as 
shown earlier in Figure 5-2. Shoot, when you’re finished with one check, 
Quicken even scrolls the completed check off the screen and replaces it 
with a new, blank check that you can use to pay your next bill. It doesn’t 
get much better than this, does it?
What if you make a mistake 
entering a check?
Don’t worry. If you haven’t yet printed the check, fixing mistakes is easy. 
If you press the PgUp and PgDn keys with the Write Checks window dis­
played, Quicken pages you through the check transactions. That way, you 
can display any check that you wrote — but have not yet printed — in the 
Write Checks window. Or, an even easier way if you’ve got a lot of checks 
is to double-click the check in the list that appears beneath the check form. 
(Quicken adds a check to this list when you click the Record Check button.)

91
 Chapter 5: Printing 101
With the check redisplayed, you can fix the mistake in two ways:
	
✓	If you incorrectly entered some bit of check information, move the 
cursor to the field with the incorrect data and just type over the data.
	
✓	If you’re really mad or frustrated, you can delete the entire check by 
clicking the Delete button. (I should ’fess up here and suggest that you 
delete the check if you accidentally entered a check to me, for example.) 
Then you can re-enter the check — only this time, correctly.
	
Don’t use this method to delete a check that you’ve already printed. To void a 
check that you’ve already printed, follow these steps:
	
1.	You must first go into the Transactions tab. To display the register, 
you can click the Accounts bar hyperlink for the account.
	
	 The Accounts bar appears along the left edge of the Quicken program 
window.
	
2.	Find the check on the Transactions tab, select the check, and void it 
by clicking the Edit button and choosing the drop-down list’s Void 
Transaction command.
	
3.	Write something, such as VOID, in large letters across the face of the 
printed check.
Printing a check you’ve entered
Printing checks is easy. Here’s what you need to do:
	
1.	Load the checks into your printer.
	
	 You do so the same way you load any other paper into your printer. If 
you have questions about it, refer to your printer documentation. (Sorry 
I can’t help more on this process, but with a million different printers on 
the market, I can’t guess which one you have.)
	
2.	Click the Print button in the top of the Write Checks window and 
then choose the Checks command on the menu Quicken displays (or 
choose File➪Print Checks or press Ctrl+P).
	
	 Quicken displays the Select Checks To Print: Checking dialog box, 
shown in Figure 5-3. At the top of the dialog box, Quicken shows how 
many checks you have to print and the total dollar amount for those 
checks.
	
3.	Enter the first check number.

92
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Figure 5-3: 
The Select

	 Move the cursor to the First Check Number text box and type the 
number printed on the first check form you’ll print. Figure 5-3 shows 
1001, for example, so the first check form is numbered 1001. To quickly 
increase or decrease the check numbers, use + or – on the numeric 
keypad.
	
4.	Indicate which checks Quicken should print by selecting one of these 
options:
 
• All Checks: Select this option button if you want Quicken to print 
all the checks you’ve entered by using the Write Checks window, 
which is the usual case. (If you select this option, skip to Step 6.)
 
• Checks Dated Through: Select this option button if you want to 
print all the checks through a certain date; then type that date in 
the text box. (If you select this option, skip to Step 6.)
 
• Selected Checks: Select this option button if you want to pick and 
choose which checks to print.
	
5.	If you say that you want to select which checks to print, click the 
Choose button.
	
	 Quicken, with some annoyance, displays the Select Checks To Print 
window, shown in Figure 5-4. Initially, Quicken marks all the checks 
dated on or earlier than the current date by placing a check mark in the 
Print column. If you don’t want to print a check, either leave the Print 
field for that check clear (unchecked) or click in the field to remove 
the check mark. When only the checks you want to print are marked 
to be printed, click Done to continue with this crazy little thing called 
check printing. Quicken, happy with your progress, redisplays the Select 
Checks To Print: Checking dialog box (refer to Figure 5-3).

6.	Indicate which Quicken check form you’re using.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Check Style drop-down list box, click the arrow 
so that the list drops down, and then select the check form you pur­
chased: standard, voucher, or wallet checks.
	
7.	Tell Quicken if you’re printing a partial page.
	
	 If you’re printing a partial page, use the Checks On First Page option but­
tons to indicate the number of check forms on the partial page. Select 
the Three option button if you have three checks, the Two option button 
if you have two checks, or the One option button if you have one check.
	
8.	Indicate whether you want extra copies of the check form.
	
	 To do so, type the number of copies you want in the Additional Copies 
text box. (This text box appears only if you’re set up for the voucher 
check style.)
	
	 If you use Quicken for business to keep accounts payable files, make 
copies of checks to attach to the invoices that the checks pay. Then 
if a vendor calls later, starts hassling you, and asks which check paid 
an invoice, you can easily check your accounts payable files, quickly 
answer that question, and basically cover your derrière.
	
9.	Click OK and let the games begin.
	
	 If you’re using a partial starting page of forms, your printer may prompt 
you to feed the first page of forms manually. When it finishes, Quicken 
asks whether it printed your checks correctly (as shown in Figure 5-5).
	
10.	If the checks printed correctly, click OK. You’re done. If the checks 
didn’t print correctly, enter the number of the first check that printed 
incorrectly and click OK; then repeat Steps 3–9.
	
11.	Sign the printed checks.
	
	 Then — and I guess you probably don’t need my help here — put the 
checks in the mail.

Check(s)

dialog box.
	
What if you discover a mistake 
after you print the check?
This problem isn’t as big as you may think.
If you’ve already mailed the check, you can’t do a whole lot. You can try to 
get the check back (if the person you paid hasn’t cashed it) and replace it 
with the correct check. (Good luck on this one.)
If the person has cashed the check, you can’t get the check back. If you 
overpaid the person by writing the check for too much, you need to get the 
person to pay you the overpayment amount. If you underpaid the person, 
you need to write another check for the amount of the underpayment.
If you printed the check but haven’t mailed it, void the printed check. First, 
write VOID in large letters — in ink — across the face of the check form. (Use 
a ballpoint pen if you’re using multipart forms so that the second and third 
parts also show as VOID.) Second, open the Register tab, highlight the check, 
click the Edit button, and then choose the Void Transaction command. (This 
option marks the check as one that has been voided in the system so that 
Quicken doesn’t use the voided check in calculating your account balance.)
A few words about check printing
Check printing is kind of complicated at first, isn’t it?
For the record, I’m with you on this one. But you’ll find that printing checks 
does get easier after the first few times.

95
 Chapter 5: Printing 101
Pretty soon, you’ll be running instead of walking through the steps. Pretty 
soon, you’ll just skate around things like check-form alignment problems. 
Pretty soon, you’ll know all this stuff and never have to read “pretty soon” 
again.
Printing a Check Register
You can print a check register or a register for any other account. To print a 
register, follow these magic steps:
	
1.	Display the register by clicking the Accounts bar hyperlink for the 
account, click the Account Actions button to display its Account 
Actions menu, and then choose Print Transactions.
	
	 Quicken displays the Print Register dialog box, shown in Figure 5-6.
	
Figure 5-6: 
The Print 
Register 
dialog box.
	
Oh, where, oh, where, do the unprinted checks go?
The register stores unprinted checks — those 
you’ve entered by using the Write Checks: 
Checking window but haven’t yet printed. To 
identify them as unprinted checks, Quicken 
sets their check numbers as Print. After you tell 
Quicken to print the unprinted checks, Quicken 
prints the checks in your register that have 
Print in the check number field and replaces the 
word Print with the actual check number.
This information is of little practical value in 
most instances, but it results in several inter­
esting possibilities. For example, you can enter 
the checks you want to print directly into the 
register — all you need to do is enter the check 
number as Print. (Notice that you can’t enter 
an address anywhere in the register, so this 
process isn’t practical if you enter addresses 
that will be printed on your checks.) You also 
can cause a check you’ve printed once to print 
again by changing its check number from, say, 
007 to Print. I can’t think of many good rea­
sons why you would want to change a check 
number. The only one I can think of is that you 
accidentally printed a check on plain paper and 
want to reprint it on a real check form.

96
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
2.	(Optional) Enter a register title.
	
	 If you’re the sort who likes to add your own special titles to things, move 
the cursor to the Title text box. Then type the title or description that 
you want Quicken to print at the top of every page of the register.
	
3.	(Optional) Limit the range of dates.
	
	 To print a register of something other than the current year-to-date 
transactions, use the Print Transactions From and To text boxes. This is 
pretty dang obvious, isn’t it? You just move the cursor to the From and 
To text boxes and type the range of dates the register should include.
	
4.	(Optional) Tell Quicken to print split transaction information.
	
	 To print the split transaction information — categories, memos, and 
amounts — move the cursor to the Print Split Transactions check box. 
Then press the spacebar or select the check box.
	
5.	Click Print.
	
	 Quicken displays the Print dialog box (shown in Figure 5-7). You don’t 
have to fool around with this dialog box. If you want to print a register 
pronto, just click OK. Then again, if you’re the sort of person who likes to 
fool around with this kind of stuff, carry on with the rest of these steps.
	
	 If you want to see the effects that the different register-printing text 
boxes and check boxes have, just experiment. You can’t hurt anything 
or anybody.
	
	 The rest of these steps are optional. Do them if you feel like it.
	
6.	(Optional) Export the report to disk if you want.
	
	 To print the report to disk as a text file, select one of the following 
options in the Export To drop-down list:
 
• Text File if you want to create a text file, such as when you want to 
import the register into a word-processing program.
 
• Tab-Delimited (Excel Compatible) Disk File, such as when you want 
to import the register into a database program. (Oooh . . . fancy. . . .)
 
• 123 (.PRN) Disk File, such as when you want to import the register 
into Lotus 1-2-3 or any spreadsheet program that will open 1-2-3 
files (which, basically, means any spreadsheet program, including 
Microsoft Excel).
	
	 If you do indicate that you want a disk file, after you click the Print 
button to start the ol’ printing process, Quicken displays the Create Disk 
File dialog box, shown in Figure 5-8. This dialog box asks for the file­
name that Quicken should create as part of printing the file to disk and 
asks where you want to store the file. Just enter the filename you want 

97
 Chapter 5: Printing 101
in — you guessed it — the File Name text box. (Use a valid filename, of 
course.) Use the Save In text box to indicate where you want to store the 
file. And what do you do with the disk file? You’re on your own here. . . .
	
Figure 5-7: 
The Print 
dialog box.
	
	
7.	(Optional) Tell Quicken which pages to print.
	
	 Use the Print Range option buttons and text boxes to limit the pages 
Quicken prints (refer to Figure 5-7). How? Select the Pages option button 
and then type the range of page numbers you want to print. That’s 
simple enough, right?
	
8.	(Optional) Color your world.
	
	 If you have a color printer and want to print your register in color, select 
the Print In Color check box in the Print dialog box (refer to Figure 5-7).

dialog box.
	

98
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
9.	(Optional) Trade speed for quality.
	
	 Or you can select the Print In Draft Mode check box to tell Quicken it 
should print faster and spend less time worrying about the quality of the 
printing job (refer to Figure 5-7). In other words, you can use this check 
box to trade print quality for print speed. Life is full of trade-offs, isn’t it?
	
10.	(Optional) Tell Quicken to scrunch the information so that it fits 
across the page.
	
	 Click in the Fit To One Page Wide check box to tell Quicken that you 
want its register information to fit across the width of the page (refer to 
Figure 5-7).
	
11.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken finally prints the register. I’m not going to show a printed copy 
of the register here. All it is, really, is just a printed copy of the same 
account detail information you see on the Transactions tab.
Should you save a printed copy of your register?
Here’s a question for you: Should you save a 
printed copy of your register? I don’t know. The 
case for printing a copy of your register and 
then having it handy in case, well, just in case, 
is this: If your computer goes haywire and you 
need to re-enter your transactions or you need 
a hard-copy record of your transactions and 
for some reason don’t have access to Quicken, 
having a printed register will make things much 
easier for you. You know what, though? I think 
that most people, if they religiously back up 
their Quicken data files (something I describe 
in Chapter 9), don’t really need to print copies 
of their registers.
Now, I should say that if you’re someone who 
likes to keep meticulous records of your income 
and spending, and you always double-check 
to make sure that you haven’t left the iron on 
or even plugged in whenever you leave your 
house, you could print a copy of the register. 
And what I would suggest is that you print a 
copy of the register at the end of the year and 
then file this report away with your tax return.
By the way, I’ve been using Quicken since 
1988 and have never needed a printed copy 
of my register. I’ve made frequent use of other 
reports. But never have I needed a hard, paper 
copy of my register. Anytime I have had a ques­
tion, I’ve simply looked through the online ver­
sion of my current register or archived files 
from previous years.

M
any banks now offer electronic banking services in a big, big way. 
This is a step toward providing a pretty impressive variety of online 
services to the general consumer (you and me). This chapter covers the 
Quicken electronic banking services: Online Account Access and Online Bill 
Payment.
What Are Online Account Access 
and Online Bill Payment?
I’m going to start with the basics — a definition of these two services.
Online services means that you can connect your computer to your bank’s 
computer electronically through your Internet connection. You may think 
that doing so sounds scary, but Online Account Access and Online Bill 
Payment provide some very neat benefits:
	
✓	With Online Bill Payment, you can tell your bank or (in a pinch) the Intuit 
online financial services unit to make payments to specific individuals or 
businesses. In other words, rather than providing all this information in 
the usual way (on checks), you send the same information — the payees’ 
names, their addresses, the amounts, and so on — and then the bank 
writes the checks. You can tell the bank to make automatic recurring pay­
ments for bills that you pay on a regular basis, such as a rent or mortgage 
payment. You can use Online Bill Payment at any bank.

100
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
✓	With Online Account Access, you can get transaction information — 
such as information about which checks and deposits cleared your 
account and what bank service fees you’ve been charged — from the 
bank’s computer. You can also transfer money between accounts — 
such as from your savings account to your checking account and from 
your checking account to your credit card account (to pay a credit card 
bill). To use Quicken for Online Account Access, your bank must sup­
port the Quicken Online Account Access service.
Wise Whys and Wherefores
Neither Online Account Access nor Online Bill Payment is difficult to use. 
And despite the nightmares that people with delusional paranoia may 
develop about electronic banking, the service is safe, secure, and very solid. 
Nevertheless, before you, too, jump onto the Online Account Access and 
Online Bill Payment bandwagon, you should probably consider a few points:
	
✓	As I note in the preceding section, if you want to use the Online Account 
Access feature, your bank must be a part of the Quicken Online Account 
Access program. (See the next section for details on how to find out 
whether your bank qualifies.)
	
✓	To sign up for and use Online Account Access or Online Bill Payment 
services, you need an Internet connection.
	
✓	You should be fairly comfortable with Quicken, especially with account 
transactions and transferring money between accounts. (Therefore, if 
you’re new to Quicken, you should at least record a handful of checks, 
make some deposits, and reconcile your account before venturing into 
Online Account Access. This ramping up of your Quicken skills should 
take, oh, I don’t know, about two weeks.)
	
✓	Make sure that your records are completely up to date and reconciled 
with the last statements you received from the bank.
This stuff usually ain’t free. I can’t tell you how much these two services 
will cost because your bank sets the charges. A good guess is $10 to $20 per 
month — and that adds up over the course of a year. But in choosing to use 
Online Account Access or Online Bill Payment, do consider all the hidden 
costs of the normal way of banking and paying bills. Gasoline, time, and post­
age can all add up, and these almost hidden costs may make the costs of the 
online services appear more reasonable. (Besides, you won’t have to deal 
with all that nasty glue on your tongue from licking envelopes.)

101
 Chapter 6: Online and In Charge
Banking with Online Account Access 
and Online Bill Payment
To begin using either the Online Account Access or the Online Bill Payment 
service, you have to sign up. If you want to use Online Account Access, you 
sign up with your bank. Just visit your bank’s Web site or call your local 
branch and ask someone whether the bank supports Online Account Access 
with Quicken. (If your bank doesn’t support Online Account Access, you can 
still sign up with Intuit for Online Bill Payment — check the Quicken.com 
Web site for details.) Then do whatever the folks at the bank tell you to do 
to sign up. You’ll probably have to fill out an application, agree to pay some 
extra fees, and then wait a few days for a customer identification number and 
a PIN, or personal identification number.
After the bank does its preparation and sends you its welcome letter, you can 
set up Quicken for Online Account Access. To set up Quicken to use Online 
Account Access or Online Bill Payment services, display the account for 
which you want to activate online services. You can do this, for example, by 
following these steps:
	
1.	Click the account’s hyperlink on the Accounts bar.
	
2.	Tell Quicken you want to set up online banking or bill payment.
	
	 Click the Account Actions button and choose the Setup Online command, 
shown in Figure 6-1. Quicken may display an Account Setup dialog box 
that asks which version of your bank’s online banking service you’re 
already set up to use. If you see this question, select the online banking 
service that corresponds with what you’ve set up. Then click Next.
	
3.	Identify yourself.
	
	 When Quicken displays the Quicken Account Setup dialog box that asks 
for your login information (see Figure 6-2), supply your customer identi­
fication number and PIN.
Let me say a couple more quick things about setting up Online Account 
Access or Online Bill Payment. Your bank or the Quicken folks may, as part 
of the application process, send you a letter asking for more information, a 
canceled check, or a signature. (If they do, of course, be sure to respond.)
Using Online Account Access and Online Bill Payment is extremely easy. You 
pay bills in pretty much the usual manner. You make account transfers in the 
same manner. And then you reconcile transactions with a mouse click.

 Chapter 6: Online and In Charge
Finding an online bank — online
You can determine which banks support Online Account Access by using 
your Internet connection. To do so, start your Web browser and then enter 
the following Web address into the browser’s address box:
https://quickenonline.intuit.com/quickenweb/external/
fi-select.jsf
Paying bills
You have three ways to record online payments. If you’re comfortable using 
the Write Checks window, you write a check in the usual way. You enter the 
payee name, an amount, probably a category, and so on. Just make sure that 
you select the Online Payment check box. The Online Payment check box 
appears in the lower-right corner of the on-screen check form.
If you have questions about how the Write Checks window works, Chapter 5 
shows you — among other things — how to use the Write Checks window 
to describe checks you want to print. You use the same basic procedure to 
describe online payments that you want to make.
If you’re more comfortable using the register to record payments, you can 
make online payments with that, too. In the Num column, just specify the 
payment number as Send.
If you have questions about how the register works, you may want to read 
Chapter 4. Chapter 4 describes — in some detail, I might add — how the 
Quicken register works.
By the way, the first time you make an online payment to someone, Quicken 
asks for some information in the Set Up Online Payee dialog box: where the 
person lives or where the business is located, and what account number 
Quicken can use to identify the person or business. You can also describe 
online payees by choosing Online➪Online Payee List, which displays a list of 
online payees. Then click the New button, which displays the Set Up Online 
Payee dialog box.
After you record a payment, you send it to the bank. To do so, choose the 
Online➪One Step Update command.

104
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Quicken connects, through the Internet, to your bank’s computer. As part of 
making this connection, you need to provide a PIN. When Quicken finishes 
sending your payment instructions to your bank, it displays a summary that 
basically says you’ve connected to the bank’s computer and sent it some 
payment instructions. At this point, you’re done.
Note: The first time that you use Online Account Access, Quicken asks you to 
change your PIN.
Note: You can have Quicken regularly update your account information. To 
do this, choose the Online➪Schedule Updates command and follow the on-
screen instructions.
Honest Steve’s evaluation of online services
I hate making financial record keeping more 
complicated. I like things simple. But all that 
said, I think Online Bill Payment and, in particu­
lar, Online Account Access are slick.
If you’re using Quicken to keep your financial 
records, you get to pay your bills and rec­
oncile your bank accounts for basically no 
extra work. Well, okay, you have to click your 
mouse an extra time. And initially, you need 
to provide addresses and account numbers 
for your payees (which takes about five min­
utes). So you do have to do a little extra work 
at the beginning. But Online Account Access 
saves you time and hassle when it comes to bill 
paying and banking.
The only catch — and this is a big one for 
some Quicken users — is that to use Online 
Account Access, your bank needs to have its 
act together. (Note that if your bank doesn’t 
support Online Account Access with Quicken, 
you can still use Online Bill Payment by signing 
up for online payment with Intuit, as detailed at 
the Quicken.com Web site.)
Now, all that said, I want to close with two caveats. 
Here’s the first one: Online Account Access 
isn’t worth it if it means you end up banking at 
some poorly run bank. I, er, well, yeah, you see, 
I’ve been there. And it isn’t pretty. To make a 
long, sorry story short, a long time ago, I had 
the experience of moving my banking from a 
well-run bank that didn’t have Online Account 
Access to a poorly managed bank that did. 
Online Account Access is not — I repeat, is 
not — such a cool tool that you’ll be happy 
banking at First National Idiots.
And now a second caveat: I have to tell you 
that online payments aren’t, in my experience, 
as reliable as writing a regular check and then 
sending that check through the mail. I don’t 
know why this is. But it’s been my experience 
that online payments more frequently get lost, 
and they sometimes get delayed. I’ve been 
using online banking and bill payment for sev­
eral years now, and a time or two a year, people 
or businesses call and say, “Dude, we never got 
your payment” or, “Dude, we got your check 
late — you owe us a late fee.” In comparison, 
my experience is that the U.S. Postal Service 
almost never loses my mailed payments.

105
 Chapter 6: Online and In Charge
	
I need to make an important point here. You must send your payment 
instructions to the bank several days in advance of the time the bill needs to 
be paid. For obvious reasons, the bank needs a day or two to process the bill. 
And then the check probably has to go through the U.S. Postal Service. (I say 
“probably” in the previous sentence because only a few payments get made 
electronically.)
Transferring money between accounts
As you may expect, you record Online Account Access transfers the same 
way that you record regular transfers — or at least in almost the same way. 
For online transfers, you can use the register in the normal way, but you need 
to specify that the transaction is an online transfer. You do this by activating 
the Num drop-down list box and selecting the Online Transfer entry.
If you have a credit card with a bank that supports Online Account Access 
and if you also set up the credit card for Online Account Access, you can 
pay your credit card bill by transferring money from a bank account to your 
credit card account. You probably already thought of this if you have a credit 
card account. But I thought I’d mention it anyway. (For more information 
about credit card accounts, refer to Chapter 11.)
Updating your Quicken accounts
One major advantage of Online Account Access is that you can get the most 
up-to-date information regarding your accounts. Let me explain: When you use 
the Online menu’s One Step Update or Schedule Updates command, your bank 
automatically sends current transactions to your computer. If Quicken can 
match the bank’s records with your records, no problem. Everything is fine.
If Quicken can’t match the bank records with your records, however, it lists 
the mystery transactions on the Downloaded Transactions tab of the account 
register window. You then examine them before they go into your records. 
You can add downloaded transactions from the bank’s list to your register by 
clicking.
	
By regularly downloading transactions into your online accounts and match­
ing transactions between your Quicken records and the bank’s records, you 
make reconciling your bank accounts a snap. In effect, by downloading and 
matching transactions, you get information about checks and debit card trans­
actions that you’ve forgotten to record much earlier (because you don’t have 
to wait until the end of the month). Note, however, that you should still recon­
cile your account in the usual way (described in Chapter 8).

106
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Are you still with me?
Okay, I’m going to take a little breather here — 
just to make sure that you understand what’s 
going on. When you boil everything down to its 
essence, online payments are really just pay­
ment instructions you send to your bank. And 
when you make an online transfer, you are 
effectively just calling the bank and saying, 
“Please transfer money from one account to 
that other account.”
This makes sense, right? You’re really just 
giving instructions to the bank. And then the 
bank (or actually the bank’s computer) goes 
off and does whatever you’ve told it to do. It’s 
pretty simple.
Is Online Account Access anything to get all 
excited about? Is it really as slick as some 
people think? I think so. Sure, it’s not always 
cheap. But after you get going, you get away 
from that business of finding your checkbook, 
signing checks, finding stamps, and then, on 
occasion, running down to the post office to 
drop off some overdue bill.

uicken enables you to summarize, slice, and dice register and account

reports and produce graphs easily. This stuff is much easier to understand if 
you know how to print a transaction list first (a trick I describe at the end of 
Chapter 5).
Creating and Printing Reports
After you know how to print checks and transaction lists, all other printing in 
Quicken is easy, easy, easy.

108
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Printing the facts, and 
nothing but the facts
The transactions you enter in the transaction list window or a transaction 
form and the checks you enter in the Write Checks window determine the 
information in a report. To print a report, just choose the Reports menu and 
tell Quicken which report you want to print.
Quicken produces a bunch of different reports. To make sense of what may 
otherwise become mass confusion, Quicken arranges all its reports into 
groups: Banking, Comparison, Investing (available when you’ve set up invest­
ment accounts), Net Worth & Balances, Spending, Tax, Rental Property (if 
you’re using Quicken Rental Property Manager), and Business (if you’re using 
Quicken Home & Business).
To see the reports in one of these groups, click the Home, Banking, Planning, 
or Business tab, click the All Reports and Graphs button, and then select the 
report group on the Reports menu. As you may know, those little triangles to 
the right of menu commands tell you that another menu follows.
Figure 7-1 shows the Banking group of reports. Pretty exciting stuff so far, 
don’t you think?

 Chapter 7: Reports, Charts, and Other Cool Tools
To create a Cash Flow report (or any other report, for that matter) on the fly, 
choose the report on the appropriate menu. For example, to create the Cash 
Flow report, click the Home tab, click the All Reports and Graphs button, and 
choose Banking➪Cash Flow. Quicken then creates the report, placing it in a 
newly opened window. Figure 7-2, for example, shows the Cash Flow report. 
After you create a report, you can change the report date or date range by 
using the boxes at the top of the report.

To find out what type of information a report includes before you create the 
report or to preview a report, click the All Reports and Graphs button and 
then choose Reports & Graphs Center. This displays the Reports & Graphs 
window, shown in Figure 7-3. Select a report group by clicking a topic on the 
left side and then select the report with the report group that you want to 
create. (In Figure 7-3, the Spending report group is selected and therefore 
shown. Within the Spending report group, the Spending By Category report is 
selected and therefore shown.)
You can change the report date or date range by using the box(es) provided. 
Click the Show Report button to create the report. If you don’t enter a new 
range of dates, Quicken assumes that you want to include transactions from 
the start of the current calendar year through the present date.

window.
	
Reports that show account balances — such as the Account Balances 
report, the Net Worth report, the Balance Sheet report, or the Portfolio 
Value report — don’t need a range of dates because these reports show 
account balances as of a specific date. In these cases, if you don’t enter 
a date, Quicken assumes that you want account balances for the current 
system date from your computer’s internal clock.
You can’t see the entire on-screen version of a report unless your report is 
very small (or your screen is monstrously large). Press the PgUp and PgDn 
keys to scroll up and down and use Tab and Shift+Tab to move right and 
left. Or if you’re a mouse lover, you can click-and-drag various pieces of the 
scroll bars.
To print your report, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Print Report button.
	
	 Quicken displays the Print dialog box (see Figure 7-4).
	
2.	To accept the given specifications — which are almost always fine — 
just click Print.
	
	 You’ll never guess what happens next: Quicken prints the report!
	
3.	(Optional) To modify the default printing suggestions, use the option 
buttons and text boxes in the Print dialog box to mix it up a bit and 
then click Print:

Figure 7-4: 
The Print 
dialog box.
	
 
• Print To: The Print To option buttons let you tell Quicken where it 
should send the report it produces: to the printer or to a disk file. 
If you choose to print it to a file, Quicken displays another dialog 
box you use to specify where the print file should be located and 
what the print file should be named. (I describe how this print-
to-file option works in Chapter 5, so I won’t repeat the discussion 
here. If you want the scoop, refer to the section about printing a 
check register.)
 
• Print Range: Printing a long report? Consider using the Print Range 
option buttons and text box to specify that you want to print only 
a specified range of pages. As you might guess (if you’re a clever 
person), click the Pages button and then specify the individual 
pages (separating each page by a comma) or the range of pages 
(separating the start and end page range with a hyphen). For exam­
ple, the following page-range specification says, “Hey Quicken, 
print pages 1, 4, and 5 and, oh shoot, I don’t know, maybe the page 
range 34 through 41 as well.”
	
	1, 4, 5, 34–41
 
• Copies: As you probably guessed, use the Number Of Copies text 
box to tell Quicken to print multiple copies of a report.
 
• Page Scaling: For some reports — although not all — you can use 
the Page Scaling option buttons and text boxes to tell Quicken 
that it should try to squish the report onto a smaller number of 

112
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
pages. Ever the thoughtful software program, Quicken provides 
two squishing methods. You can click the Page Scaling Adjust To 
option button and then enter a squishing percentage. Or you can 
click the Page Scaling Fit To option button and then specify the 
report size as a certain number of pages wide by a certain number 
of pages tall.
 
• Print What: The Print What check boxes let you flip-flop between 
printing a graph and printing a report of the Quicken data you’ve 
said you want to see a report on. The easiest way to see what this 
report option does is to click and unclick.
 
• Orientation: The Orientation option buttons allow you to specify 
how Quicken prints a report on pages: vertically (Portrait) or hori­
zontally (Landscape). Again, if you’re confused about this option, 
experiment by clicking the different buttons.
	
	Note: When you click a Print dialog box button or enter some value 
in a Print dialog box field, Quicken redraws the Preview box to 
show you what the report looks like with your new specification.
 
• Ink Color: If you use a color printer, Quicken provides Ink Color 
option buttons, which let you choose whether you want to 
print the report in expensive colored ink, in cheap black ink, or 
in shades of gray so that you can go all film noire about your 
finances.
 
• Fonts: The two Change Font buttons let you customize the look 
of your report by changing the font settings (point size, font, 
style, and so on) of the text used for your report’s header text 
and body text. I feel kind of like a broken record saying this, but, 
dude, seriously — the way to most easily figure out what these 
options do is simply to experiment. You can’t foul up or corrupt 
your Quicken data by fiddle-faddling with the Print dialog box 
settings. And this is true even if you do something truly visually 
outrageous.
 
• Adjust Margins: Click the Adjust Margins button to add margin-
setting boxes to the Preview area in the Print dialog box. After 
Quicken adds these margin-setting boxes, you can change the 
printed report’s margins by changing the margin settings.
Reviewing standard reports
Tables 7-1 through 7-8 describe the Quicken reports by group. (Some of these 
babies won’t make sense unless you understand how to collect the informa­
tion that goes into the report, as I describe in Chapters 13, 14, 15, and 16.)

Finding the report you want
Okay, if you’ve read or even skimmed the reports I describe in Tables 7-1 
through 7-8, you’re probably a little overwhelmed. Quicken produces a bunch 
of different reports. How do you know which one provides the answers you 
want? What are you supposed to do? Sift your way through three dozen of 
these babies?
Thankfully, the answer is no. Quicken also provides something called 
EasyAnswer reports. In effect, EasyAnswer reports let you identify the 
question that you want a report to answer. After you identify the question, 
Quicken produces the appropriate report. Here’s how this all works:

118
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
1.	Click the All Reports and Graphs button and choose EasyAnswer.
	
	 Quicken displays the EasyAnswer topic in the Reports & Graphs 
window.
	
2.	Indicate your question.
	
	 To tell Quicken what your question is, click one of the questions, and 
then use the drop-down list boxes that accompany each question to 
further refine your question. For example, the “Where did I spend my 
money?” question lets you pick the period of time you’re asking about: 
Last Year, Last Month, Current Year, Month to Date, and so on.
	
3.	Click Show Report.
	
	 Quicken produces a report that answers your questions. For example, 
if you ask, “Where did I spend my money last year?” Quicken produces 
a Cash Flow report that summarizes the previous year’s income and 
expenses by category.
Going to the printing dog-and-pony show
You can do some neat things with the reports you create. I won’t spend a 
bunch of time talking about these things, but I do want to give you a quick 
rundown of some of the most valuable tricks.
Got a question about a number? Just zoom it
If you don’t understand where a number in a report came from, point to it 
with the mouse. When you point to numbers, Quicken changes the mouse 
pointer to a magnifying glass marked with a +. Double-click the mouse, and 
Quicken displays a list of all the transactions that make up that number.
This feature, formerly known as QuickZoom, is extremely handy for under­
standing the figures that appear on your reports. If you double-click the 
Utilities number in the report in Figure 7-2, for example, Quicken displays the 
report shown in Figure 7-5.
Ah, yes. Two cable TV bills. And you’re not even buying the premium chan­
nels package. Yikes.
See a problem? Fix it
You can sometimes fix erroneous report data right in a report window. If 
you select a report transaction and Quicken enables the Edit button (shown 
in the upper-left corner of the report window), you can click the button 
to display an Edit menu. The menu lists editing commands you can use to 
delete the selected transaction or to change the category, payee, or memo 
information.

119
 Chapter 7: Reports, Charts, and Other Cool Tools
	
Figure 7-5: 
The report 
you get 
after drilling 
down deep 
into the 
data.
	
Got a question about register transactions? Use a mini-report
If you’re looking at the Quicken register and you select either the Payee or 
Category field, Quicken adds a mini-report button to the end of the field. 
(The actual mini-report button looks like a small piece of paper.) If you click 
the mini-report button, Quicken creates a small report that summarizes the 
transactions falling into the same category or transactions with the same 
payee, as shown in Figure 7-6.
If you click the Show Report button, which appears in the mini-report 
window, Quicken creates a transaction report for the same information 
shown in the mini-report.
Sharing report data with spreadsheets
If you use Microsoft Excel, you can export the report to the spreadsheet 
program. Just click the Export Data button and choose the Report To Excel 
Compatible Format option. Quicken displays a dialog box you use to name 
and locate a tab-delimited text file. (Any spreadsheet program worth its salt 
can open a tab-delimited text file.) You may need to use this feature if you 
want to use a spreadsheet to analyze the report data.
You can also copy the stuff that shows in a report window to the Clipboard. 
Just click the Export Data button and choose the Copy Report To Clipboard 
command. Then, to use the copied report, start your spreadsheet (or other) 
program and choose Edit➪Paste to paste the stuff from the Clipboard. This 
process really isn’t very hard, so go ahead and try it.

Customizing your reports
If you want to extract some financial tidbit, you 
can usually get what you want from one of the 
reports listed on the Reports menu, especially 
if you use the EasyAnswer feature to find the 
right report!
I should tell you something: Quicken is remark­
ably sophisticated in its reporting. You can cus­
tomize any report you see on the Reports menu.
To customize these reports, click the Customize 
button to get to the nuts and bolts of your 
selected report.
I’m not going to describe the customization 
process. I feel kind of bad about this omission 
because a few people are probably out there 
who, late one night, will decide that they want 
to know how to filter, sort, and customize. Of 
course, there are also people who will decide 
late some night that they want to know how 
to replace the transmission on a 1971 Triumph 
Spitfire. And I’m not describing that here, either.
If you really want to customize your reports, just 
noodle around. You can’t hurt anything.
If you do play around with these items, you can 
save any custom report specifications that you 
create. To do so, click the Save Report button at 
the top of the report window. Quicken displays 
a dialog box that asks you to supply a name for 
your customized report. (You can also provide a 
default report date range.) After you name the 
customized report, Quicken lists it whenever 
you choose Reports➪Saved Reports & Graphs 
Center.

121
 Chapter 7: Reports, Charts, and Other Cool Tools
Sharing report data in PDF files
You can create a PDF version of the report. To do this, click the Export Data 
button and choose the Export To PDF Format option. Quicken displays a 
dialog box that you use to name and locate the PDF file it will momentarily 
create. A PDF file of the report is an electronic version of the report. 
Editing and rearranging reports
You may notice that when Quicken displays the report window, it also 
displays a row of buttons, including Back, Customize, Delete, Export Data, 
Forward, History, Preferences, Save Report, and Sort (refer to Figure 7-2). 
Also appearing are the Date Range and the Subtotal By drop-down list boxes. 
Earlier in the chapter, in “Printing the facts, and nothing but the facts,” I talk 
about what the Date Range drop-down list box does. So in the interest of fair 
play, I briefly discuss what the other buttons do. (Not all these buttons are 
available in every report document window. And sometimes Quicken uses 
different names to refer to them. I don’t know why, really. Maybe it’s just to 
keep you guessing.)
You really don’t need to worry about these other buttons. Read through the 
discussion that follows only if you’re feeling comfortable, relaxed, and truly 
mellow. Okay?
Back, Forward, and History
The Back and Forward buttons let you move back and forth between open 
report windows. The History button displays a list of the windows you’ve 
displayed; you can choose a previously displayed window by clicking it in 
the list.
Delete
The Delete button deletes the current report from the report list. You can 
use this button to, in effect, undo any changes you’ve made to a report and 
return to the default report specifications.
Export Data
I talk about this option in the “Sharing report data with spreadsheets” and 
“Sharing report data in PDF files” sections, earlier in this chapter. Look there 
if you have questions.
Sort
The Sort button displays a list of sorting options that you can use for arrang­
ing information on the report. Enough said.

122
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Save Report
Say you get into this customization thing. If you do, you should know that 
you can save your customized reports by clicking the Save Report button. 
When you click Save Report, Quicken displays the Save Report dialog box, 
shown in Figure 7-7. Mostly, Quicken displays this dialog box so that you can 
give your creation a name. You also use this dialog box to indicate in which 
financial activity center Quicken should save your report.
	
Figure 7-7: 
The Save 
Report 
dialog box.
	
By the way, after you create a saved report, you can reproduce it by select­
ing the report from the My Saved Reports section of the Reports & Graphs 
Center.
What’s the Preferences button for?
When you click the Preferences button, Quicken displays a Preferences 
dialog box with a bunch of boxes and buttons that let you change the way the 
window looks or works.
If I were a really great writer — the Stephen King of computer books, for 
example — I might be able to whip up a riveting discussion of how the 
Preferences dialog box works. I’m going to do both you and my publisher a 
favor, however, by making a suggestion: Just play with these option settings 
if you’re interested. You’ll find it more fun and a better learning experience.
Date Range
I briefly mention the Date Range box earlier in this chapter, but here I pro­
vide a slightly more detailed description. The Date Range box displays a 
drop-down list that you can use to specify what time period you want listed 
on your report: the current month, last year, the current quarter to date, and 
so on.

123
 Chapter 7: Reports, Charts, and Other Cool Tools
Column subtotaling
The Column drop-down list box displays a list that enables you to tell 
Quicken you want subtotal amounts by some criterion, as shown in Figure 
7-8. Just select the criterion. Note that sometimes Column is replaced with 
Subtotal By.
	
Figure 7-8: 
The Column 
drop-down 
list box.
	
Customizing
The Customize button works pretty much the same no matter which report 
shows in the document window.
When you click this button, Quicken displays a dialog box that lets you 
enter the report title and specify the range of dates the report should cover 
by using text boxes. It also lets you choose from a variety of other options, 
too, such as which accounts to use, which transactions to use, and how the 
report’s information should be arranged.
Charts Only Look Tricky
I love charts. I know that sounds goofy. But data graphics — as the snobs and 
academics call them — open up wonderful opportunities for communicating. 
And Quicken charts are really easy to use.

124
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
In fact, many times, Quicken will add a small chart to a report window. Take a 
look at Figure 7-8, for example, and see what I mean. You can also display just 
a chart, however.
To produce just a Quicken chart, first choose the report you want by using 
the Reports & Graphs window, which you get by choosing the EasyAnswer 
command from the Reports & Graphs window. Then select the report you 
want and click the Show Graph button. That’s it. Easy as rolling off a log.
Note: Not all reports provide data that can be plotted in a graph. Accordingly, 
you won’t see a Show Graph button in every report window.
Figure 7-9 shows a picture of a bar graph of income and expense figures, but 
you’ll have much more fun looking at your own data in a picture. By the way, 
you can drill down (described earlier in this chapter in “Got a question about 
a number? Just zoom it”) through a chart to see a report that describes the 
data being plotted.
	
Figure 7-9: 
The Income/
Expense 
graph.
	
You can memorize customized graphs the same way you memorize cus­
tomized reports. Just click the Save Report button at the top of the graph 
window. Then, when Quicken prompts you, give the graph a name. To later 
reuse the graph, select the graph from the My Saved Reports section of the 
Reports & Graphs Center.

125
 Chapter 7: Reports, Charts, and Other Cool Tools
QuickReports: Last But Not Least
Before I forget, I need to tell you about one other variant of the Quicken report­
ing feature: QuickReports. Ah, yes, QuickReports. Here’s the deal. Quicken 
supplies a quick-and-dirty report called, cleverly enough, a QuickReport. If 
you’re working with the transaction list, you can produce a quick report that 
summarizes things, such as the checks written to a particular payee or the 
transactions assigned to a specific income or expense category. 
To produce a QuickReport, first move the cursor to the field that you want to 
summarize in the report. Then right-click the field to display a shortcut menu. 
Typically, the second-to-last command will produce a QuickReport. The report 
shown in Figure 7-10, for example, is a QuickReport that shows the payments 
you’ve received from your Aunt Enid. She is such a sweetheart. (The name of the 
second-to-last command selected was, “Payments Received From Aunt Enid.) 
Note: The very last command on the shortcut menu will usually (if selected) 
produce a mini-report, like that shown in Figure 7-6.

A Matter of Balance
In This Chapter
▶	Choosing the account you want to balance
▶	Telling Quicken to balance an account
▶	Giving Quicken the bank statement balance
▶	Entering monthly service charges and interest income
▶	Marking account transactions as cleared or uncleared
▶	Verifying that uncleared transactions explain the account difference
▶	Checking for errors: What you should do if your account doesn’t balance
I
 want to start this chapter with an important point: Balancing a bank 
account in Quicken is easy and quick.
I’m not just trying to get you pumped up about an otherwise painfully boring 
topic. I don’t think balancing a bank account is any more exciting than you 
do. (At the Nelson house, we never answer the “What should we do tonight?” 
question by saying, “Hey, let’s balance an account!”)
My point is this: Because bank account balancing can be tedious and boring, 
use Quicken to speed up the drudgery.
Selecting the Account 
You Want to Balance
This step is easy. And you probably already know how to do it, too.
	
1.	Click the Banking tab.
	
	 Quicken displays the Banking window.
	
	 The Banking window lists information about your bank accounts (as 
shown in Figure 8-1).

128
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
2.	Click the account that you want to balance.
	
	 Quicken displays the transactions tab, or account register, for the 
account.
	
Figure 8-1: 
The Banking 
window.
	
Balancing a Bank Account
As I said, balancing a bank account is remarkably easy. In fact, I’ll go so far 
as to say that if you have any problems, they’ll stem from . . . well, sloppy 
record keeping that preceded your use of Quicken.
Telling Quicken, “Hey, man, I want 
to balance this account”
To tell Quicken that you want to balance, or reconcile, your account records 
with the bank’s records, click the Account Actions button and then choose 
the Reconcile command. Quicken displays the Statement Summary: Checking 
dialog box, shown in Figure 8-2.

129
 Chapter 8: A Matter of Balance
	
Figure 8-2: 
The 
Statement 
Summary: 
Checking 
dialog box.
	
Giving Quicken the bank’s information
As you probably know, in a reconciliation, you compare your records of a 
bank account with the bank’s records of the same account. You should be 
able to explain any difference between the two accounts — usually by point­
ing to checks that you’ve written but that haven’t cleared. (Sometimes depos­
its fall into the same category; you’ve recorded and mailed a deposit, but the 
bank hasn’t yet credited your account.)
The first step, then, is to supply Quicken with the bank’s account informa­
tion. This information comes from your monthly statement. Supply Quicken 
with the figures it needs as follows:
	
1.	Verify the opening balance.
	
	 Quicken displays a figure in the Opening Balance text box. If this figure 
isn’t correct, replace it with the correct figure. To do so, move the 
cursor to the text box and type over the given figure. (If you’re reconcil­
ing your account for the first time, Quicken gets this opening balance 
figure from your starting account balance. If you’ve reconciled before, 
Quicken uses the Ending Balance that you specified the last time you 
reconciled.)
	
2.	Enter the ending balance.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Ending Balance text box and type the ending, or 
closing, balance shown on your bank statement.
	
3.	Provide the statement’s ending balance date.
	
	 Move the cursor to the New Statement Ending Date text box and type 
the ending date for the statement you’re using to reconcile.

130
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
4.	Enter the bank’s service charge.
	
	 If your bank statement shows a service charge and you haven’t already 
entered it, move the cursor to the Service Charge text box and type the 
amount.
	
5.	Type a transaction date for the service charge transaction.
	
	 Quicken supplies its best guess for the date. If you’re reconciling for the 
first time, Quicken uses the current system date from your computer’s 
clock. If you’ve reconciled the account before, Quicken picks a date one 
month later from the last time you reconciled the account. If the date 
Quicken picks isn’t correct, type the correct date.
	
	 You can adjust a date one day at a time by using either the + or – key.
	
6.	Assign the bank’s service charge to a category.
	
	 Quicken helps you out by displaying the Bank Charge category in the 
first Category text box — the one beneath the Service Charge text box. 
If you want to use a different category, click the down arrow in the 
Category text box to open the Category drop-down list box; then select a 
category by scrolling down the list and pressing Enter.
	
7.	Enter the account’s interest income.
	
	 If the account earned interest for the month and you haven’t already 
entered this figure, type the amount in the Interest Earned text box.
	
8.	Enter a transaction date for the interest income transaction.
	
	 You already know how to enter dates. I won’t bore you by explaining it 
again (but see Step 5 if you’re having trouble).
	
9.	Assign the interest to a category.
	
	 Type an appropriate income category for any interest — perhaps some­
thing like, er, Interest Inc.
	
10.	Tell Quicken that the bank statement is complete.
	
	 To do so, just click OK. Quicken displays the reconcile window, which I 
describe in the next section.
Explaining the difference between your 
records and the bank’s records
Next, Quicken compares your register’s account balance with the bank state­
ment’s ending account balance. Then it builds a list of checks and deposits 
that your register shows but that haven’t yet cleared (haven’t been recorded 
by the bank). Figure 8-3 shows the Statement Summary: Checking window 
that Quicken displays to provide you with this information.

131
 Chapter 8: A Matter of Balance
	
Figure 8-3: 
The 
Statement 
Summary: 
Checking 
window.
	
As Figure 8-3 shows, the Statement Summary: Checking window is basically 
just two lists — one of account withdrawals and one of account deposits. The 
window also displays some extra information at the bottom of the screen: the 
Cleared Balance (which is your account balance including only those trans­
actions that you or Quicken have marked as cleared), the Statement Ending 
Balance, and the Difference between these two figures.
	
If you don’t like the order in which withdrawals and deposits are arranged, 
you can change it. Click the View button and choose Sort By Date, and 
Quicken reorders the transactions by date. (You can also sort by check 
number, payee, or amount.)
Marking cleared checks and deposits
You need to tell Quicken which deposits and checks have cleared at the 
bank. (Refer to your bank statement for this information.)
	
1.	Identify the first deposit that has cleared.
	
	 You know how to do so, I’m sure. Just leaf through the bank statement 
and find the first deposit listed.
	
2.	Mark the first cleared deposit as cleared.
	
	 Scroll through the transactions listed in the right column of the 
Statement Summary: Checking window, find the deposit, and then mark 
it as cleared by clicking it. Quicken places a check mark in front of the 
deposit and updates the cleared statement balance.

132
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
3.	Record any cleared but missing deposits.
	
	 If you can’t find a deposit, you haven’t entered it into the Quicken 
register yet. I can only guess why you haven’t entered it. Maybe you 
just forgot. In any event, return to the Quicken register by clicking 
the Edit button and then enter the deposit in the register in the usual 
way — but type a c (for cleared) in the Clr column. This mark identifies 
the deposit as one that’s already cleared at the bank. To return to the 
Statement Summary: Checking window, click the Return To Reconcile 
button.
	
4.	Repeat Steps 1–3 for all deposits listed on the bank statement.
	
5.	Identify the first check or other withdrawal that has cleared.
	
	 No sweat, right? Just find the first check or withdrawal listed on the 
bank statement.
	
6.	Mark the first cleared check or other withdrawal as cleared.
	
	 Scroll through the transactions listed in the left column of the Statement 
Summary: Checking window, find the first check, and select it to mark it 
as having cleared the bank. Quicken inserts a check mark to label this 
transaction as cleared and updates the Cleared Balance.
	
7.	Record any missing but cleared checks or withdrawals.
	
	 If you can’t find a check or withdrawal — guess what? — you haven’t 
entered it in the Quicken register yet. Display the Quicken register by 
clicking the Edit button. Then enter the check or withdrawal in the 
register. Be sure to type a c (for cleared) in the Clr column to identify 
this check or withdrawal as one that’s already cleared the bank. To 
return to the Statement Summary: Checking window, click the Return To 
Reconcile button.
	
8.	Repeat Steps 5–7 for withdrawals listed on the bank statement.
By the way, these steps don’t take very long. It takes me about two minutes 
to reconcile my account each month. And I’m not joking or exaggerating. By 
two minutes, I really mean two minutes.
Making sure that the difference equals zero
After you mark all the cleared checks and deposits, the difference between 
the cleared balance for the account and the bank statement’s ending bal­
ance should equal zero. Notice that I said should, not will. Figure 8-4 shows 
a Statement Summary: Checking window in which everything is hunky-dory, 
and life is grand.

133
 Chapter 8: A Matter of Balance
	
Figure 8-4: 
The 
Statement 
Summary: 
Checking 
window 
showing a 
cleared 
balance.
	
If the difference does equal zero, you’re done. Just click the Finished button 
to tell Quicken that you’re done. Quicken displays a congratulatory message 
telling you how proud it is of you, and then it asks whether you want to print 
a Reconciliation report.
As part of the finishing-up process, Quicken changes all the cs to Rs. There’s 
no great magic in this transformation. Quicken makes the changes to identify 
the transactions that have already been reconciled.
	
Can’t decide whether to print the Reconciliation report? Unless you’re a busi­
ness bookkeeper or an accountant reconciling a bank account for someone 
else — your employer or a client, for example — you don’t need to print the 
Reconciliation report. All printing does is prove that you reconciled the 
account. (Basically, this proof is the reason you should print the report if you 
are a bookkeeper or an accountant — the person for whom you’re reconciling 
the account will know that you did your job and will have a piece of paper to 
come back to later if he or she has questions.)
If the difference doesn’t equal zero, you have a problem. If you click Finished, 
Quicken provides some cursory explanations as to why your account doesn’t 
balance (via the Adjust Balance dialog box, shown in Figure 8-5). This dialog 
box tells you, in effect, that you can force the two amounts to agree by click­
ing the Adjust button.

134
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Forcing the two amounts to agree isn’t a very good idea. To do so, Quicken 
adds a cleared and reconciled transaction equal to the difference. (I talk about 
this transaction in the upcoming section, “Ten Things You Should Do If Your 
Account Doesn’t Balance.”)
	
Figure 8-5: 
The Adjust 
Balance 
dialog box.
	
If you want to reconcile later without saving your unfinished work, click 
Cancel in the Statement Summary: Checking window and then click Yes 
when Quicken asks you whether you really want to quit without saving your 
work. The next time you click the Reconcile button, you’ll have to start over 
from scratch.
If you can’t get your account to reconcile but want to save your work, click 
the Finish Later button. Quicken leaves your reconciliation work basically 
half done. The transactions that you marked as cleared still show a c in the 
Clr field. And you still have an unexplainable difference between the bank 
statement and your register.
Either way, postponing a reconciliation and not choosing to adjust the 
bank account balance is usually the best approach. It enables you to locate 
and correct problems. (I give you some ideas about how to do so in the 
next section.) Then you can restart the reconciliation and finish your work. 
(You restart a reconciliation in the same way that you originate one.)
Ten Things You Should Do If Your 
Account Doesn’t Balance
I have some suggestions for reconciling an account that’s causing you prob­
lems. If you’re sitting in front of your computer wringing your hands, try the 
following tips.

135
 Chapter 8: A Matter of Balance
Make sure that you’re working 
with the right account
Sounds dumb, doesn’t it? If you have a bunch of different bank accounts, 
however, ending up in the wrong account is pretty darned easy. So go ahead 
and confirm, for example, that you’re trying to reconcile your checking 
account at Mammoth International Bank by using the Mammoth International 
checking account statement.
Look for transactions that the bank 
has recorded but you haven’t
Go through your bank statement and make sure that you have recorded every 
transaction that your bank has recorded. Cash machine withdrawals, special 
fees or service charges (such as for checks or your safety deposit box), auto­
matic withdrawals, direct deposits, and so on are easily overlooked.
	
If the difference is positive — that is, the bank thinks you have less money 
than you think you should — you may be missing a withdrawal transaction. If 
the difference is negative, you may be missing a deposit transaction.
Look for reversed transactions
Here’s a tricky one. If you accidentally enter a transaction backward — a 
deposit as a withdrawal or a withdrawal as a deposit — your account won’t 
balance. And the error can be difficult to find. The Statement Summary: 
Checking window shows all the correct transactions, but a transaction 
amount appears positive when it should be negative or negative when it 
should be positive. The check you wrote to Mrs. Travis for your son’s piano 
lessons appears as a positive number (a deposit) instead of a negative 
number (a check), for example.
Look for a transaction that’s 
equal to half the difference
One handy way to find a transaction that you entered backward — if you only 
have one — is to look for a transaction that’s equal to half the irreconcilable 
difference. For example, if the difference is $200, you may have entered a 
$100 deposit as a withdrawal or a $100 withdrawal as a deposit.

136
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but the sign (that is, positive or negative) of 
the difference should help you find the problem. If the difference is positive — 
the bank thinks you have less money than your register indicates — you 
may have mistakenly entered a withdrawal as a deposit. If the difference is 
negative — the bank thinks you have more money than your register says — 
you may be missing a deposit transaction.
Look for a transaction that’s 
equal to the difference
While I’m on the subject of explaining the difference by looking at individual 
transactions, let me make an obvious point. If the difference between the 
bank’s records and yours equals one of the transactions listed in your reg­
ister, you may have incorrectly marked the transaction as cleared or incor­
rectly left the transaction marked as uncleared.
I don’t know. Maybe that was too obvious.
Check for transposed numbers
Transposed numbers occur when you flip-flop two digits in a number. For 
example, you enter $45.89 as $48.59.
These turkeys always cause accountants and bookkeepers headaches. If you 
look at the numbers, detecting an error is often difficult because the digits 
are the same. For example, when comparing a check amount of $45.89 in your 
register with a check for $48.59 shown on your bank statement, both check 
amounts show the same digits: 4, 5, 8, and 9. They just show them in different 
orders.
	
Transposed numbers are tough to find, but here’s a trick you can try. Divide 
the difference shown on the Statement Summary: Checking window by nine. If 
the result is an even number of dollars or cents, you may have a transposed 
number somewhere.
Have someone else look over your work
This idea may seem pretty obvious, but I’m amazed at how often a second 
pair of eyes can find something that you’ve been overlooking.

137
 Chapter 8: A Matter of Balance
If you’re using Quicken at home, ask your spouse. If you’re using Quicken at 
work, ask the owner or one of your coworkers (preferably that one person 
who always seems to have way too much free time).
Look out for multiple errors
By the way, if you find an error by using this laundry list and still can’t bal­
ance your account, you should start checking at the top of the list again. You 
may, for example, discover — after you find a transposed number — that you 
entered another transaction backward or incorrectly cleared or uncleared a 
transaction.
Try again next month (and maybe 
the month after that)
If the difference isn’t huge in relation to the size of your bank account, you 
may want to wait until next month and attempt to reconcile your account 
again.
Before my carefree attitude puts you in a panic, consider the following exam­
ple. You reconcile your account in January, and the difference is $24.02. Then 
you reconcile the account in February, and the difference is $24.02. Then you 
reconcile the account in March, and, surprise, surprise, the difference is still 
$24.02.
What’s going on here? Well, your starting account balance was probably off 
by $24.02. (The more months you try to reconcile your account and find that 
you’re always mysteriously $24.02 off, the more likely it is that this type of 
error is to blame.)
After the second or third month, I think it’s pretty reasonable to tell Quicken 
that it should enter an adjusting transaction for $24.02 so that your account 
balances. (In my opinion, this is the only circumstance that merits your 
adjusting an account to match the bank’s figure.)
By the way, if you’ve successfully reconciled your account with Quicken 
before, your work may not be at fault. The mistake could be (drum roll, 
please) the bank’s! And in this case, you should do something else. . . .

138
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Get in your car, drive to the 
bank, and beg for help
As an alternative to the preceding idea — which supposes that the bank’s 
statement is correct and that your records are incorrect — I propose this idea: 
Ask the folks at the bank to help you reconcile the account. (Check to see 
whether they charge for this service first, of course.) Hint that you think that 
the mistake is probably theirs. Smile a great deal. And one other thing — be 
sure to ask about whatever product they’re currently advertising in the lobby. 
(This behavior encourages them to think that you’re interested in that 180-
month certificate of deposit, and they’ll be extra nice to you.)
In general, the bank’s record keeping is usually pretty darned good. I’ve 
never had a problem as a business-banking client or as an individual. (I’ve 
also been lucky enough to deal with big, well-run banks.)
Nevertheless, your bank may have made a mistake, so ask the people there 
to help you. (Note: Be sure to have them explain any transactions that you 
discover only by seeing them on your bank statement.)

O
kay, you don’t have to worry about chasing dust bunnies in Quicken, 
but you do have to take care of little housekeeping tasks. This chapter 
describes these chores and how to do them right, with minimal hassle.
Backing Up Is Hard to Do
You should back up the files that Quicken uses to store your financial 
records. But you need to know how to back up before you can back up.
Backing up the quick-and-dirty way
You’re busy. You don’t have time to fool around. You just want to do a pass­
able job backing up files. Sound like your situation? Then follow these steps:
	
1.	Insert a writable CD into the appropriate drive, or a flash drive into a 
USB port.
	
	 You can back up to any disk or storage device you can write to — this 
can be a floppy disk, writable CD, Zip disk, or flash drive. You only need 
to know which letters your computer uses to label its drives. If you 
don’t, consult the documentation that came with your computer.

140
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
2.	Verify that the file you want to back up is active.
	
	 Display the Cash Flow Center and make sure that it displays one of the 
accounts in the file you want to back up. (If you don’t remember setting 
up multiple files, don’t worry. You probably have only one file — the 
usual case.)
	
3.	Start the backup operation by choosing File➪Backup And Restore➪
Backup Quicken File on the menu bar.
	
	 Quicken displays the Quicken Backup dialog box, shown in Figure 9-1.
	
Figure 9-1: 
The Quicken 
Backup 
dialog box.
	
	
4.	Identify the backup drive.
	
	 Select the On My Computer option button. Then verify that the disk 
letter shown in the text box is the one you want to use for backing up. If 
it isn’t, click the Change button. When Quicken displays the Browse For 
Folder dialog box, shown in Figure 9-2, select the correct disk.
	
	 You can use any removable disk, including a flash drive, a recordable 
CD, or even a Zip disk.
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 You see a message on-screen that says, “Aye, Cap’n, I’m working just as 
fast as I can” (or something to that effect). Then you see a message that 
says the backup is complete. Don’t worry. You’ll never see a message 
that says, “She’s starting to break up, Cap’n. She can’t take warp 9 much 
longer.” You will see a warning message if the file you want to back up is 
too large. In this case, you need to shrink the file, use a different disk, or 
use multiple disks.

141
 Chapter 9: Housekeeping for Quicken
	
Figure 9-2: 
The Browse 
For Folder 
dialog box.
	
	
As Figure 9-1 indicates, you can also back up Quicken online. When you select 
the Online option button and click OK, Quicken explains the service and gets 
you started. Just so you know, an online backup gets stored on Intuit’s com­
puters — Intuit makes Quicken — rather than on your computer’s disks. 
Online backup works the same basic way as disk backup, except you need an 
Internet connection, and the online backup service costs money. The service 
costs from $9.99 to $149.99 a year at the time I’m writing this book, depending 
on the level of service you choose. I’m as cheap as the next guy, but I think the 
online backup option is something to consider. The prices seem cheap rela­
tive to the value of the data you’re probably backing up.
Deciding when to back up
Sure, I can give you some tricky, technical examples of fancy backup strate­
gies, but they have no point here. You want to know the basics, right? So 
here’s what I do to back up my files. I back up every month after I reconcile. 
Then I stick the flash drive in my briefcase, so if something terrible happens 
at home, I don’t lose both my computer and the backup disk with the data. 
I admit that my strategy has a few problems, however. For example, because 
I’m backing up only once per month, I may have to re-enter as much as a 
month’s worth of data if the computer crashes toward the end of the month. 
In my case, I wouldn’t lose all that much work. However, if you have really 
heavy transaction volumes — if you write hundreds of checks per month, for 
example — you may want to back up more frequently than monthly, such as 
once weekly. If you use the same disk or set of disks to back up your Quicken 
file, Quicken will warn you before it replaces the old file with the new one. 
You can go ahead and let Quicken do this, as long as you’re sure that you 
won’t want to access the old file anymore.

142
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
A second problem with my strategy is only remotely possible but is still worth 
mentioning. If something bad does happen to the Quicken files stored on my 
computer’s hard drive and the files stored on the backup disk, I’m up the 
proverbial creek without a paddle. I should also note that a removable disk 
is far more likely to fail than a hard drive. If this worst-case scenario actually 
occurs, I’ll need to start over from scratch from the beginning of the year. 
To prevent this scenario from happening, some people — those who are reli­
giously careful — make more than one backup copy of their Quicken files.
By the way, Quicken periodically prompts you to back up when you try to 
exit. (You’ll see a message that basically says, “Friend, backing up is a darn 
good idea.”) You can, of course, choose to ignore this message. Or you can 
take Quicken’s advice and do the backup thing as I describe earlier in this 
chapter, in the section, “Backing up the quick-and-dirty way.”
You know what else? Here’s a secret feature of Quicken: Quicken adds a sub­
directory called Backup to the Quicken directory. And Quicken will stick a 
backup copy of your files in this directory every few days. (Sorry to be vague 
on this point, but it’s hard to be specific and concrete when it comes to 
undocumented features.) You can find out more on this later in this chapter 
in the section, “Losing your Quicken data when you haven’t backed up.”
Losing your Quicken data 
after you’ve backed up
What happens if you lose all your Quicken data? First of all, I encourage you 
to feel smug. Get a cup of coffee. Lean back in your chair. Gloat for a couple 
of minutes. You, my friend, will have no problem.
After you’ve sufficiently gloated, carefully do the following to reinstate your 
Quicken data on the computer:
	
1.	Get your backup disk.
	
	 Find the backup disk you created and carefully insert it or plug it in. (If 
you can’t find the backup disk, forget what I said about feeling smug — 
stop gloating and skip to the next section.) 
	
2.	Start Quicken.
	
	 You already know how to do this, right? By the way, if the disaster that 
caused you to lose your data also trashed other parts of your computer, 
you may need to reinstall Quicken. Shoot. I suppose it’s possible that 
you may even need to reinstall Windows.
	
3.	Choose File➪Backup And Restore➪Restore From Backup File on the 
menu.

143
 Chapter 9: Housekeeping for Quicken
	
	 Quicken probably displays a menu listing the automatic backup copies 
of the Quicken data file that Quicken has secretly previously made. If 
that’s the case, you can simply select the automatic backup copy you 
want to use. Quicken then automatically restores the file for you — and 
you get to skip ahead to Step 6.
	
	 Alternatively, you can select the Restore From Backup button and then 
click the Browse button. Quicken looks at the selected folder or disk and 
displays a list of the files stored there, as shown in Figure 9-3. If your 
computer has another disk in it and this other disk has the backup copy 
of the file, use the Look In drop-down list box to select the other drive.
	
Figure 9-3: 
The Restore 
Quicken File 
dialog box.
	
	
4.	Select the file you want to restore and then click OK.
	
	 Use the arrow keys or the mouse to select the file that you want to 
restore.
	
	 If the file you select is the one Quicken used last, the program displays 
a message asking whether it’s okay to overwrite, or replace, the file with 
the one stored on the disk.
	
	 When you restore a file, you replace the current, in-memory version of 
the file with the backup version stored on the disk. Don’t restore a file 
for fun. Don’t restore a file for entertainment. Restore a file only if the 
current version is trashed, and you want to start over by using the ver­
sion stored on the backup disk.
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken replaces the file it’s currently using with the one from the 
backup disk. After it finishes, Quicken displays a message telling you 
that it has restored the file. You’re almost done.

144
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
6.	Update the account registers as necessary.
	
	 Using the register windows for each of the accounts in a file, re-enter 
each of the transactions you recorded since you created the backup. 
Be sure that you update your accounts because you’ve almost certainly 
entered transactions since the last time you backed up.
	
	 Just to be on the safe side, you should back up the file after you com­
plete this process. Using a new flash drive is probably a good idea, too. I 
have heard that lightning never strikes the same place twice, but I’m not 
sure that the old saying is true. If you have hard drive problems or 
another recurring problem, whatever fouled up your file this time may 
rear its ugly head again — and soon.
Losing your Quicken data when 
you haven’t backed up
What do you do if you haven’t backed up your files in a while and you lose all 
the data in your Quicken files? Okay. Stay calm. All may not be lost.
First, you can try restoring the files from the secret Quicken backup directory. 
To do so, you follow the same file restoration steps I cover in the preceding 
section, with one minor exception. After you choose the Restore From Backup 
command, look at the list of automatic (secret) backup files that Quicken has 
squirreled away on your computer.
Select the newest automatic backup file and then click OK. Quicken uses that 
file to restore the current file. As I alluded to earlier in this chapter, grabbing 
one of these secret backup copies of the Quicken data file may just work. And 
if it does, you should feel very lucky. Very lucky indeed.
Okay. So suppose that you’ve tried the approach described in the preceding 
paragraph, and it didn’t work. What next?
You have to re-enter all the transactions for the entire year. Yeah. I know. It’s 
a bummer. This method isn’t quick, and it isn’t pretty, but it works.
If you have copies of the registers, of course, you can use these as your 
information source to re-enter the information in your files. If you don’t have 
copies of the registers, you need to use your bank statements and any other 
paper financial records you have.
	
If, for some unfortunate reason, the only copy you have of your Quicken data 
seems to have become corrupted, you can have Quicken try to rebuild the file. 

145
 Chapter 9: Housekeeping for Quicken
To do so, choose File➪File Operations➪Validate and enter the name of the file 
you want rebuilt in the File Name text box. You typically do this, however, 
only when instructed by Quicken or Intuit technical support people.
Working with Files, Files, and More Files
As part of setting up Quicken, you create what Quicken calls a file: a 
place where Quicken stores all your accounts (bank accounts, credit card 
accounts, investment accounts, and so on).
You can have more than one Quicken file at any time. Most people won’t 
want to do this. But, for example, you can use different files to keep your per­
sonal financial records separate from business financial records.
Using multiple files does have a little drawback, however. You can’t easily 
record, in one fell swoop, account transfer transactions between accounts in 
different files. You need to record the transaction twice — once in the source 
account, the file where the transaction originates, and again in the destination 
account, the file where you are transferring the transaction.
If the two accounts involved in a transfer are in the same file, just enter the 
account name in the Category text box. Quicken then records the transfer in 
the other account for you.
Setting up a new file
To set up a new file so that you can create accounts in it, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose File➪New on the menu bar.
	
	 Quicken displays the Creating New File: Dude, Are You Sure? dialog box, 
shown in Figure 9-4.

Enter.
	
	 Quicken displays the Create Quicken File dialog box, shown in Figure 9-5.
	
3.	Enter a name for the Quicken file.
	
	 Position the cursor in the File Name text box and type some meaningful 
combination of letters and numbers. You don’t need to enter a file exten­
sion because Quicken supplies the correct file extension — QDF — 
for you.
	
	 Note: You can use the symbol characters on your keyboard, but doing 
so gets a little tricky. If you must use symbol characters in the filename, 
refer to the Quicken user documentation.
	
4.	Use the default file location.
	
	 Accept Quicken’s suggestion to store the file in the QUICKEN directory. I 
can think of no good reason to put the file in another location.
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken displays the Quicken Home page with the Get Started button, 
shown in Figure 9-6.
	
6.	Run the Setup.
	
	 To set up the new Quicken file, click the Get Started button. You might 
also want to click the Setup tab and then read through the Setup tab’s 
information and answer its questions. If you have questions about either 
of these steps, refer to Chapter 1.

Flip-flopping between files
You can work with only one file at a time. So, after you create a second file, 
you need to know how to flip-flop between your files. If you’re recording busi­
ness stuff, for example, you want to be using the business file. However, what 
if a transaction comes in that clearly is meant for your personal file and you 
want to enter it there immediately? Flip-flopping allows you to get from one 
file to another in no time.
Flip-flopping is easy:
	
1.	Just choose File➪Open.
	
	 Quicken displays the Open Quicken File dialog box (see Figure 9-7).
	
2.	Pick the file you want from the File Name text box and then click OK.
	
	 Zap! You’re in the new file.
	
If you really want to switch to another file with lightning speed, you can select 
the name of the other file directly on the bottom of the File menu, where 
Quicken lists the last four files you used.

When files get too big for their own good
You can enter a large number of transactions in a Quicken file; in fact, you 
can record tens of thousands of transactions in a single account or file. 
Wowsers!
In spite of these huge numbers, I can think of some good reasons to work 
with smaller files if you can. For example, working with files of a manageable 
size means that you can more easily and more quickly back them up. Also, 
fewer transactions mean that Quicken runs faster because more memory is 
available for Windows. (Windows likes lots of memory — the same way that 
some people like lots of ice cream.)
Note: Oh, jeepers. My technical editor wants me to remind you that there 
are good reasons to work with large files when you can. And, of course, he’s 
right. Having several years of data at your fingertips, for example, is handy. 
With several years of data, you can easily get answers to all sorts of ques­
tions: how much money wealthy relatives have given you over the years, how 
much cable television has gone up in price, and so on.
If your files have gotten too big for their own good, you can knock them down 
to size by creating a new file that contains only the current year’s transac­
tions. You end up with a copy of the big file that you won’t use anymore and 
a smaller, shrunken file with just the current year’s transactions. Working 
with a smaller file probably means that Quicken will run faster. (The memory 
thing comes into play again.) And smaller files should make backing up easier 
because you can probably keep your files small enough to fit on a single, 
double-density floppy disk.

149
 Chapter 9: Housekeeping for Quicken
Call me a Nervous Nellie — or a Nervous Nelson — but because shrinking 
a file involves wholesale change, I’d really feel more comfortable helping 
you through this process if you first back up the file you’re about to shrink. 
I don’t think that you need to be anxious about anything, but just in case 
something does go wrong during the shrinking process, I know that you want 
to have a backup copy of the file to fall back on.
To shrink a Quicken file, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose File➪File Operations➪Year-End Copy on the menu bar.
	
	 Quicken displays a portrait of Barry Nelson, the first actor to portray 
James Bond. No, not really — I just wanted to see whether you were 
awake. Actually, Quicken displays the Create A Year End Copy dialog 
box, shown in Figure 9-8.
	
2.	Describe what you want in the current data file.
	
	 Your next step in creating a year-end copy is to describe what informa­
tion you want in the current data file, which is the Quicken file that 
you’ll continue to work with. Like the Create A Year End Copy dialog 
box suggests, you have two choices: The Do Nothing choice leaves the 
Quicken data file alone. The Do Something (please!) choice creates a 
copy of the Quicken data file using only balances and transactions after 
a specified date. To shrink the current Quicken file, you predictably use 
the Do Something (please!) option by selecting the appropriate option 
button and then specifying the cutoff date.
For people who just have to be in the know . . .
What Quicken refers to as a file is really a set 
of data and index files with the same filename, 
such as HOME, but different file extensions, 
such as QDF, QPH, QEL, and IDX. So when 
Quicken refers to the HOME file, it really is 
referring to the set of files that includes HOME.
QDF, HOME.QPH, HOME.QEL, and HOME.
IDX. 
In most cases, you never need to know the 
distinction between the files in the set, but the 
knowledge may come in handy someday. For 
example, if you happen to stumble onto the 
Quicken directory, knowing about the set of 
HOME files keeps you from panicking when you 
see all the multiple copies of the HOME file. Or, 
on a more serious note, if you use a third-party 
backup utility, you need to know that all these 
files contain data that should be backed up.

150
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Figure 9-8: 
The Create 
A Year End 
Copy dialog 
box. 
	
	
	 When you archive, you make a copy of the Quicken data file, but (typi­
cally) just through the end of the previous year. You continue to work 
with the big, everything-is-still-there data file. Why archive? So that you 
can have a copy of the Quicken data file as it existed at a point in time. 
You might archive the Quicken data file on CD and store the archive file 
with your tax return, for example. By doing this, you’d be sure of always 
being able to later look at the Quicken data file that explained your tax 
deductions.
	
3.	Confirm the name in the Give The Archive File A Name And Location 
text box.
	
	 You can actually ignore the filename and folder location information 
that Quicken enters into the Give The Archive File A Name And Location 
text box. However, if you really must have it your way, you do have the 
option of replacing what Quicken suggests with another name. You can 
also click the Browse button and choose another folder location by 
using the dialog box that Quicken displays.
	
4.	Specify a starting date.
	
	 Using the Specify Starting Date text box, type a cutoff date. Nowadays, 
the folks at Quicken are calling this the This Archive Data File Will 
Contain Transactions Up To And Including text box, but you guessed 
that, didn’t you? Quicken deletes all cleared transactions with dates that 

151
 Chapter 9: Housekeeping for Quicken
fall before this cutoff date from the current Quicken file. (Remember: 
This file is the one you work with and want to shrink.) I chose 12/31/2008 
as the cutoff date in Figure 9-8 so that I could create a new file for all 
2009 and later transactions (2009, 2010, and so on). (Note: Quicken 
doesn’t delete uncleared transactions, and it doesn’t delete investment 
transactions.)
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken creates an old-transactions “Old File” with the filename dis­
cussed in Step 3. If you told it to, Quicken also deletes all the old trans­
actions from the current file so that your current file contains only the 
transactions that are dated after the cutoff date.
	
	 Quicken then displays the dialog box shown in Figure 9-9, which tells 
you the file was successfully copied. Select the File For New Year option 
button if you want to use the current file you’ve just shrunk. Select the 
Old File option button if you want to use the old-transactions file. Click 
OK after you make your choice.
	
Figure 9-9: 
The File 
Archived 
Success-
fully dialog 
box.
	
	
	 If you want to see the old-transactions, or archive, file again, you can 
select it in the Open dialog box (accessed by choosing File➪Open). You 
should not enter any new transactions in the old-transactions file, how­
ever, because these new transactions will change the old file’s ending 
account balance without changing the current file’s beginning account 
balance.
Using and Abusing Passwords
I have mixed feelings about Quicken passwords. Theoretically, they let you 
lock up your Quicken data so that your rebellious teenagers (if you’re using 
Quicken at home) or the night janitors (if you’re using Quicken in a business) 
can’t come in and print checks, process automatic payments, and just gener­
ally mess things up.

152
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
	
Using passwords sounds pretty good, of course. But before you set up a pass­
word and then start relying on it to protect your information, let me remind 
you that a Quicken password only prevents someone from accessing your 
data with Quicken. Using a password doesn’t prevent someone from fooling 
around with your computer itself. If the night janitors — or, heaven forbid, 
your teenagers — are the nefarious types, they can erase your files with 
Windows or scramble them with another program, such as a spreadsheet or 
word-processing program. And they may even be able to get in and manipu­
late the data with another checkbook or accounting program.
Passwords come with one other little annoying problem, too. Darn it, you 
have to remember them.
For these reasons, I think that passwords are best left to computer systems 
that use them on a global basis to control access to all programs and to com­
puter systems that can track all users (you, your teenagers, the night jani­
tors, and anyone else) by name. Your PC doesn’t fall into this category.
Setting up a file password
You still want a password? Okay. With much trepidation, I give you the fol­
lowing steps for setting up a password for a Quicken file:
	
1.	Select the file you want to protect with a password.
	
	 If the file you want to password-protect is not the active file, choose 
File➪Open on the menu and then either double-click the file you want or 
select it and click OK.
	
2.	Choose File➪Set Passwords for This Data File on the menu bar. 
	
	 Quicken displays the — you guessed it — Passwords submenu, which 
lists two commands: File and Transaction.
	
3.	Choose the File command.
	
	 Quicken displays the Quicken File Password dialog box, shown in 
Figure 9-10.
	
4.	Enter the password into the New Password text box.
	
	 You can use up to 16 characters. Quicken differentiates between lower­
case and uppercase characters, by the way, so Washington, wASHING­
TON, and WASHINGTON are all different from its point of view. Quicken 
doesn’t display the actual characters you type; it displays asterisks 
instead. If you type Dog, for example, it displays ***. (Passwords 
require strict secrecy, you see.)

153
 Chapter 9: Housekeeping for Quicken
	
5.	Enter the password you want to use again — only this time into the 
Confirm Password text box — and then click OK.
	
	 Congratulations! You’re done.
	
Figure 9-10: 
The 
Quicken File 
Password 
dialog box.
	
Assigning a password to a file doesn’t prevent you from doing anything with 
the file that you would normally do. However, the next time you try to use 
this file — after you start Quicken or when you try to select the file by using 
the File➪Open command — Quicken will ask you for the file’s password. You 
need to supply the password to gain access to the file.
So what are transaction passwords?
If you choose File➪Set Password For This Data 
File, you create a file password that a Quicken 
user needs to provide before he or she gets 
access to the Quicken data. In general, you use 
such a password, called a file password, to pro­
tect the access into a Quicken file.
However, you can also set a transaction 
password by choosing File➪Set Password To 
Modify Transactions. A transaction password 
works a little differently from a file password. 
With a transaction password, the user has to 
enter the transaction password if he or she 
tries to enter a transaction that is dated before 
a specified date. You specify the date, called 
the cutoff date, when you set up the transac­
tion password.
You would use transaction passwords, my 
guess is, when you want to “lock” the previous 
year’s records. In other words, if you don’t want 
people to intentionally or accidentally change 
last year’s transactions — because that would 
mean they’re screwing around with things like 
your records of tax deductions you’ve claimed 
on a return — you use a transaction password.
Transaction passwords are okay, I guess. But I’m 
going to go out on a limb here and suggest some­
thing different: You can create and safely store 
backup copies of the Quicken file for last year or 
last month. Or you can keep the idiots from fool­
ing around with your Quicken files. Jeepers, if 
somebody can’t understand an instruction such 
as, “Use the current date,” do you really want 
them mucking about in your books?

154
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Changing a file password
After you set up a file password, you’re not stuck with it forever. You can 
either change the password or remove it by choosing File➪Set Password for 
This Data File. 
If you’ve already set up a password, however, Quicken doesn’t display the 
Quicken File Password dialog box shown in Figure 9-10. Instead, Quicken 
displays a mutated Quicken File Password dialog box that asks for the pass­
word you’re now using and the new password you want to use in the future 
(as shown in Figure 9-11). Type the current password in the Old Password 
text box and the new password in the New Password and the Confirm 
Password text boxes. Then press Enter or click OK. From now on, you need 
to use the new password to gain access to the file. If you don’t want to use 
a password anymore, just leave the New Password and Confirm Password 
text boxes blank.
And a final tip for you concerning Quicken passwords . . . If you lose your 
password, the Quicken technical support ninjas will retrieve your password-
protected file for you. The cost for this service equals $9.95. (To initiate

T
he folks at Intuit provide several nifty little calculators (most are dialog 
boxes) with Quicken. I strongly encourage you to use these tools. At the 
very least, the calculators should make your work easier. And if you invest a 
little time, you should gain some enormously valuable perspectives on your 
financial affairs.
What’s more, the most recent versions of some flavors of Quicken include a 
handful of more powerful financial planning wizards that I want you to know 
about. I won’t walk you through the steps to using these wizards. But I do 
want to preview them in the same way that a restaurant critic tells you what 
you should and shouldn’t order at some nice restaurant. You know what I 
mean. “Darling, you absolutely must try the foie gras, but do stay away from 
the chocolate mousse. It’s abominable. . . .”
Noodling Around with Your Investments
My favorite Quicken calculator is the Investment Savings Calculator. I guess I 
just like to forecast portfolio future values and other similar stuff.

156
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Using the Investment Savings Calculator
Suppose that you want to know how much you’ll accumulate if you save 
$4,000 per year for 35 years in a stock mutual fund that you anticipate will 
earn 10 percent annually. Use the Investment Savings Calculator to estimate 
how much you should ultimately accumulate. To use it, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the Savings Calculator.
	
	 Click the Planning tab to display its buttons. Click the Financial 
Calculators button to display its list of calculators, and choose the 
Savings Calculator. Quicken displays the Investment Savings Calculator 
dialog box (see Figure 10-1). 
	
Figure 10-1: 
The 
Investment 
Savings 
Calculator 
dialog box.
	
	
2.	Enter what you’ve accumulated as your Opening Savings Balance.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Opening Savings Balance text box and then type 
the amount of your current investments. If this amount is zero, for exam­
ple, type 0.
	
3.	Enter the Annual Yield that you expect your investments to earn.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Annual Yield text box and type the percent. If 
you plan to invest in the stock market and expect your savings to match 
the market’s usual return of about 10 percent, for example, type 10 
(don’t type .10).
	
4.	Indicate how long you plan to let your investments earn income.

157
 Chapter 10: Compound Interest Magic and Other Mysteries
	
	 Move the cursor to the Number Of drop-down list box and select the 
time period appropriate to your investment planning. (Usually, you’ll 
select Years, as Figure 10-1 shows.) Then move the cursor to the 
Number Of text box and indicate how long (enter the number of time 
periods) you want to maintain these investments. For example, if you 
select Years in the drop-down list box and you plan to let your invest­
ments grow for 35 years, you type 35.
	
5.	Enter the amount you plan to add to your investments every period.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Contribution Each text box and type the amount 
you plan to add. Figure 10-1 shows how to calculate an individual retire­
ment (IRA’s) future value, assuming a $4,000 annual contribution.
	
6.	Enter the anticipated inflation rate.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Predicted Inflation text box and type the inflation 
rate. By the way, over the 20th century, the inflation rate averaged just 
over 3 percent.
	
7.	Indicate whether you plan to increase your annual contribution as a 
result of inflation.
	
	 Select the Inflate Contributions check box if you plan to annually 
increase — by the annual inflation rate — the amount you add to your 
investment portfolio. Don’t select the check box if you don’t want to 
inflate the payments.
	
8.	After you enter all the information, click Calculate.
	
	 The Ending Savings Balance field shows how much you’ll accumulate in 
present-day, uninflated dollars: $274,727.07. Hmmm. Sweet.
If you want to know the amount you’ll accumulate in future-day, inflated 
dollars, deselect the Ending Balance In Today’s $ check box.
To get more information on the annual deposits, balances, and so on, click 
the Schedule button, which appears at the bottom of the Investment Savings 
Calculator dialog box. Quicken whips up a quick little report showing the 
annual deposits and ending balance for each year you plan to add into the 
savings. Try it. You may like it.
Trying to become a millionaire
So you want to be a millionaire some day.
To find out how to realize this childhood dream, use the Calculate For 
option buttons, which appear in the Investment Savings Calculator dialog 
box (refer to Figure 10-1). With these option buttons, you click the financial 

158
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
variable (Opening Savings Balance, Regular Contribution, or Ending Savings 
Balance) you want to calculate. For example, to determine the annual amount 
you need to contribute to your investment so that your portfolio reaches 
$1,000,000, here’s what you do:
	
1.	Select the Regular Contribution option button.
	
2.	Select the Inflate Contributions check box.
	
3.	Deselect the Ending Balance In Today’s $ check box.
	
4.	Enter all the other input variables.
	
	 Remember to set the Ending Savings Balance text box to 1000000 (the 
Ending Savings Balance field becomes a text box after you select the 
Regular Contribution option).
	
	 The Investment Savings Calculator computes how much you need to 
save annually to hit your $1,000,000 target.
Starting from scratch, it’ll take 35 years of roughly $2,500-per-year payments 
to reach $1,000,000.00, as shown in Figure 10-2. (All those zeros look rather 
nice, don’t they?) Note that this calculation assumes a 10 percent annual yield.
	
Figure 10-2: 
The secret 
to your 
success: 
$2,500 per 
year for 35 
years.
	
“Jeepers, creepers,” you say. “This seems too darn good to be true, Steve.”
Well, unfortunately, the calculation is a little misleading. With 4 percent infla­
tion, your million bucks will be worth only $253,415.55 in current-day dollars. 
(To confirm this present value calculation, select the Ending Savings Balance 
option button and then the Ending Balance In Today’s $ check box.)

One of my pet ideas is that it really is possible for most people to become 
millionaires. There are just three tricks to doing so. First, make sure that you 
use tax-advantaged investments like 401(k) plans and IRAs. Second, invest 
this money into an index stock mutual fund like the Vanguard Total Stock 
Market Portfolio to make sure that, over time, your returns average out to the 
average. Third, use Quicken and your computer to make smarter financial 
decisions — by doing this, you can rather easily free up an extra $50, $100, or 
even $200 per month. I talk about this subject in Chapter 18.
The Often Unbearable Burden of Debt
To help you better manage your debts, Quicken provides a neat Loan 
Calculator that computes loan payments and balances.
Using the Loan Calculator 
to figure payments
Suppose that one afternoon, you’re wondering what the mortgage payment 
is on one of those monstrous houses: tens of thousands of square feet, acres 
of grounds, cottages for the domestic help, and so on. You get the picture — 
something that’s a really vulgar display of wealth.
To calculate what you would pay on a 30-year, $5,000,000 mortgage if the 
money costs 6 percent, use the Loan Calculator:
	
1.	Display the Loan Calculator.
	
	 Click the Planning tab. Click the Financials Calculators button to dis­
play Quicken’s list of financial calculator tools. Then choose the Loan 
Calculator. Quicken displays the Loan Calculator dialog box. (See Figure 
10-3 for a picture of this handy tool.)
A timing assumption you should know
The Investment Savings Calculator assumes 
that you’ll add to your portfolio at the end of the 
period — what financial planners call an ordi­
nary annuity.

Figure 10-3:

shows that 
you can’t 
afford that 
huge 
mansion.
	
	
2.	Enter the loan amount.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Loan Amount text box and type the amount of 
the loan. (If you’re checking the lifestyle of the ostentatious and vulgar, 
type 5,000,000.) 
	
3.	Enter the annual interest rate.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Annual Interest Rate text box and type the inter­
est rate percent. If a loan charges 6 percent interest, for example, type 6.
	
4.	Enter the number of years you want to take to repay the loan.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Number Of Years text box and type the number 
of years you plan to make payments.
	
5.	Indicate how many loan payments you plan to make per year.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Periods Per Year text box and type the number 
of loan payments you plan to make per year. If you want to make 
monthly payments, for example, type 12.
	
6.	Indicate how frequently the lender will calculate, or compound, 
interest.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Compounding Period box and select the interest 
compounding period. If a loan uses monthly compounding, for example, 
select Monthly. (By the way, just so you know, most loans use compound­
ing periods equal to the payment period. Some don’t. But most do.)
If you click Calculate or move the selection cursor, Quicken calculates the 
loan payment and displays the amount in the Payment Per Period field. Hey, 
wait. $29,977.53. That doesn’t seem so bad, does it? I mean, you could almost 
make an annual — oh, never mind. That’s a monthly payment, isn’t it? Yikes!

161
 Chapter 10: Compound Interest Magic and Other Mysteries
I guess if you have to ask how much the mortgage payment is, you really 
can’t afford it.
To get more information on the loan payments, interest and principal por­
tions of payments, and outstanding loan balances, click the Schedule button, 
which appears on the face of the Loan Calculator dialog box. Quicken whips 
up a quick loan amortization schedule showing all this stuff.
Calculating loan balances
To calculate the loan principal amount, select the Loan Amount option 
button under Calculate For in the Loan Calculator dialog box. Then enter all 
the other variables.
For example, those $29,977.53-per-month payments for the monster mansion 
seem a little ridiculous. So calculate how much you can borrow if you make 
$2,000-per-month payments over 30 years and the annual interest rate is 6 
percent:
	
1.	Select the Loan Amount option button.
	
2.	Type 6 in the Annual Interest Rate text box.
	
3.	Type 30 in the Number Of Years text box.
	
4.	Type 12 in the Periods Per Year text box.
	
5.	Type 2000 in the Payment Per Period text box.
After you click the Calculator button or move the selection cursor, the Loan 
Calculator computes a loan amount of $333,583.23, as shown in Figure 10-4.

162
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
The Refinance Calculator
You won’t read about the Refinance Calculator here — but not because I’m 
lazy. Believe it or not, I enjoy writing about things that help you make better 
financial decisions. The Refinance Calculator merely calculates the difference 
in mortgage payments if you make new, lower payments; then it tells you how 
long it would take the savings from these lower payments to pay back the 
refinancing costs you incur.
For example, if you save $50 per month because you refinance and it costs 
$500 to refinance, the Refinance Calculator tells you that it would take ten 
months of $50-per-month savings to recoup your $500.
You know what? Although you may want to know how long it would take 
to recoup the refinance costs, that information doesn’t tell you whether 
refinancing is a good idea. Deciding whether to refinance is very, very com­
plicated. You can’t just look at your next few payments, like the Refinance 
Calculator does. You also need to look at the total interest you would pay 
with the old mortgage and the new mortgage.
I can’t think of any good reason to use the Refinance Calculator; it just 
doesn’t do what it purports to do.
So that I don’t leave you hanging, however, let me give you two general rules 
to help you make smarter refinancing decisions:
	
✓	First, if you want to save interest costs, don’t use refinancing as a way to 
stretch out your borrowing. That is, if you refinance, make sure that you 
make payments large enough to pay off the new mortgage by the same 
time you would have paid off the old mortgage. In other words, if you 
have 23 years left on your old mortgage, don’t go out and get a 30-year 
mortgage. Find a lender who will let you pay off the new mortgage in 23 
years.
	
✓	Here’s a second trick, if you can find a willing lender. Ask the lender to cal­
culate the annual percentage rate (APR) on the new mortgage, assuming 
that you’ll pay off the mortgage by the same time you would have paid off 
the old mortgage. (An APR includes all the loan’s costs — interest, points, 
miscellaneous fees, and so on — and calculates an implicit interest rate.) 
If the APR on the new loan is lower than the current loan’s interest rate, 
refinancing would probably save you money.
	
Let me issue one caveat. When you base your refinancing decision on the com­
parison between the new loan’s APR and the current loan’s interest rate, you 
assume that you’ll live in your current house until the mortgage is paid.
I hope this information helps. As I said, mortgage-refinancing decisions are 
tough if you truly want to save money.

 Chapter 10: Compound Interest Magic and Other Mysteries
The Retirement Calculator
I think that this section is the most important one in this book. No joke. Your 
financial future is much too consequential to go for easy laughs or cheap shots.
The dilemma in a nutshell
By the time the 30-something and 40-something crowd reaches retirement, 
Social Security coverage almost certainly will be scaled back.
But the problem isn’t just Social Security. More and more often, employer-
provided pension plans are defined contribution plans, which add specific 
amounts to your pension (such as 2 percent of your salary), rather than 
defined benefit plans, which promise specific pension amounts (such as 
$1,000 per month). As a result, although you know that someone will throw a 
few grand into your account every so often, you don’t know how much you’ll 
have when you retire.
So what does all this mean? In a nutshell, you need to think about your retire­
ment now. Fortunately, the Quicken Retirement Calculator can help you.
The truth about Social Security
Every so often, the Social Security Adminis-
tration sends you a Personal Earnings and 
Benefits Summary, sometimes known by the 
acronym PEBS. You want to pay close attention 
to both the statement and the accompanying 
letter. The statement shows you how much you 
can expect to receive in the way of retirement 
savings based on your past earnings, assum­
ing you continue to earn similar amounts in the 
future. The statement also typically tells you 
that if Congress does nothing, there will only 
be money to cover x percent of your benefits 
at some point a few decades in the future. 
For example, the statement may say some­
thing along the lines of “Blah, blah, blah, and if 
Congress does nothing to fix the funding chal­
lenges faced by the nation’s aging workers, in 
2039 the trust fund will be depleted, and Social 
Security tax receipts will be only enough to pay 
70 percent of the retirees and other recipients’ 
benefits. . . .” Okay, that’s a bummer. I know.
But think about the worst-case scenario. 
If Congress really does nothing, the Social 
Security Administration now tells you, implicitly 
through the PEBS statement, by what amount 
your benefits will be cut. The last PEBS that I 
saw, for example, suggested that the trust fund 
runs out of money in roughly 35 years, and, at 
that point, benefits will have to be cut back to 
70 percent of their current levels. For example, 
someone who would have gotten $1,000 per 
month will get only $700. Okay, that’s not good. 
But as long as you’re not depending solely on 
Social Security, it isn’t quite a financial melt­
down either. You can easily save just a bit more 
money yourself and more than make up the 
difference.

Part II: The Absolute Basics 
Retirement planning calculations
Imagine that you decide to jump into your employer’s 401(k) thing (a type of 
profit-sharing plan), and that it allows you to plop $6,000 into a retirement 
account that you think will earn about 9 percent annually.
Fortunately, you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out. 
You can just use the Retirement Calculator:
	
1.	Display the Retirement Calculator.
	
	 Click the Planning tab. Click the Financial Calculators button. Choose 
the Retirement Savings command. Quicken displays the Retirement 
Calculator dialog box, shown in Figure 10-5.
	
Figure 10-5: 
The 
Retirement 
Calculator 
dialog box.
	
	
2.	Enter what you’ve already saved as your current savings.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Current Savings text box and type your current 
retirement savings: for example, if you have some IRA money or you’ve 
accumulated a balance in an employer-sponsored 401(k) account. Don’t 
worry if you don’t have anything saved — most people don’t.
More about timing
The Retirement Calculator assumes that you or 
your employer will add to your retirement sav­
ings at the end of the year — what financial 
planners call an ordinary annuity. If you or your 
employer adds to your retirement savings at the 
beginning of the year, you earn an extra year of 
interest. As a result, your after-tax income will 
be more than Quicken shows.

165
 Chapter 10: Compound Interest Magic and Other Mysteries
	
3.	Enter the annual yield that you expect your retirement savings to earn.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Annual Yield text box and type the percent. In 
the little example shown in Figure 10-5, I say the annual yield is 9 per­
cent. This is, I’ll remind you, about the average return that the stock 
market produces over long periods of time.
	
	 You can use the long-term return the stock market delivers as your 
expected yield if you’re taking a do-it-yourself approach, investing in 
a diversified portfolio of stocks (such as through mutual funds), and 
you’re really watching your investment expenses — such as would be 
the case if you’re using low-cost index funds to keep costs low. If you’re 
working with a financial planner that charges you, say, 1 percent a year, 
obviously, your return will be 1 percent less in effect. Also, if you’re 
investing some of your money into lower-risk investments like bonds, 
that approach, although perhaps very prudent, will also reduce your 
annual yield.
	
4.	Enter the annual amount added to your retirement savings.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Annual Contribution text box and type the 
amount that you or your employer will add to your retirement savings at 
the end of each year. In the example, I say that I plan to add $6,000 (refer 
to Figure 10-5).
	
5.	Enter your current age.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Current Age text box and type a number. You’re 
on your own here, but let me suggest that this is a time to be honest.
	
6.	Enter your retirement age.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Retirement Age text box and type a number. 
Again, this is purely a personal matter. (Figure 10-5 shows this age as 65, 
but you should retire when you want.)
	
7.	Enter the age to which you want to continue withdrawals.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Withdraw Until Age field and type a number. I 
don’t want to beat around the bush here. This number is how old you 
think you’ll be when you die. I don’t like the idea any better than you do. 
Let me say, though, that ideally you want to run out of steam — there, 
that’s a safe metaphor — before you run out of money. So go ahead and 
make this age something pretty old — like 95.
	
8.	Enter any other income you’ll receive — such as Social Security.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Other Income (SSI, etc.) text box and type a 
value. (Figure 10-5 shows $15,000.) Note that this income is in current-
day, or uninflated, dollars. By the way, you can request an estimate of 
your future Social Security benefits (this is the PEBS statement I talk 
about in the “The truth about Social Security” sidebar in this chapter) by 

166
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
visiting the Social Security Administration (SSA) Web site at www.ssa.
gov or by contacting your local SSA office. Also, note that if you haven’t 
received a benefits estimate already, the SSA is actually supposed to 
send every worker an estimate of his or her future benefits.
	
9.	Indicate whether you plan to save retirement money in a tax-sheltered 
investment.
	
	 Select the Tax Sheltered Investment option button if your retirement 
savings earns untaxed money. Select the Non-Sheltered Investment 
option button if the money is taxed. Tax-sheltered investments are such 
things as IRAs, annuities, and employer-sponsored 401(k)s and 403(b)s. 
A 403(b) is kind of a profit-sharing plan for a nonprofit agency.
	
	 As a practical matter, tax-sheltered investments are the only way to ride. 
By deferring income taxes on your earnings, you earn interest on the 
money you otherwise would have paid as income tax.
	
10.	Enter your current marginal tax rate, if needed.
	
	 If you’re investing in taxable stuff, move the cursor to the Current Tax 
Rate text box. Then type the combined federal and state income tax rate 
that you pay on your last dollars of income.
	
11.	Enter your anticipated retirement tax rate.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Retirement Tax Rate text box, and then . . . hey, 
wait a minute. Who knows what the rates will be next year, let alone 
when you retire? I think that you should type 0, but remember that the 
Annual Income After Taxes is really your pretax income (just as your 
current salary is really your pretax income).
	
12.	Enter the anticipated inflation rate.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Predicted Inflation text box and type the inflation 
rate. By the way, in recent history, the inflation rate has averaged just 
above 3 percent (refer to Figure 10-5).
	
13.	Indicate whether the annual additions will increase.
	
	 Select the Inflate Contributions check box if the additions will increase 
annually by the inflation rate. (Because your salary and 401(k) contribu­
tions will presumably inflate if there’s inflation, Figure 10-5 shows the 
Inflate Contributions check box selected.)
	
14.	After you enter all the information, click Calculate and take a peek at 
the Annual Income After Taxes field.
	
	 Figure 10-5, for example, shows $28,838.76. Not bad really. If you 
want to see the after-tax income in future-day, inflated dollars, dese­
lect the Annual Income In Today’s $ check box but leave the Inflate 
Contributions check box checked.

167
 Chapter 10: Compound Interest Magic and Other Mysteries
To get more information on the annual deposits, balances, income, and so 
on, click the Schedule button, which appears on the face of the Retirement 
Calculator dialog box. Quicken whips up a quick little report showing the 
annual deposits, income, and ending retirement account balances for each 
year you plan to add to and withdraw from your retirement savings.
If you’re now bummed out 
about retirement
First, don’t feel depressed. At least you know now if your golden years seem 
a little tarnished. After all, you acquired Quicken to help you sort out your 
finances. Now you can use Quicken and your newly gained knowledge to help 
improve your financial lot.
Basically, retirement planning depends on just three things:
	
✓	The number of years that the retirement savings will accrue interest
	
✓	The real yield (that is, adjusted for inflation) you earn — in other words, 
the annual yield minus the predicted inflation
	
✓	The yearly payments
Anything you do to increase one of these variables increases your retirement 
income.
If you invest, for example, in something that delivers higher real yields, such 
as the stock market, you should see a big difference. (Of course, you usu­
ally bear more risk.) Or if you wait an extra year or two to retire, you wind 
up making more annual payments and earning more interest. Finally, if you 
boost the yearly payments (for example, by participating in an employer-
sponsored 401(k) or 403(b) plan, where your employer matches a portion of 
your contribution), you’ll see a huge change.
Noodle around with the variables. See what happens. You may be surprised.
Retirement roulette
Use the Calculate For option buttons in the Retirement Calculator (refer to 
Figure 10-5) to determine a retirement income variable. You can calculate 
current savings, annual contribution, or, as I describe earlier in the section, 
“Retirement planning calculations,” the annual after-tax income.

168
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
To calculate the yearly payment required to produce a specific level of retire­
ment income, for example, select the Annual Contribution option button. 
Then enter all the other variables — including the desired after-tax income — 
and click Calculate. The Retirement Calculator figures how much you need to 
save to hit your target retirement income.
Cost of College
Ouch. I have a couple of daughters, so I know how you feel. Man, oh, man, do 
I know how you feel.
The College Calculator
Suppose that you have a child who may attend college in ten years, and you 
haven’t started to save yet. If the local university costs $20,000 per year and 
you can earn 9 percent annually, how much should you save?
The College Calculator works like the Retirement Calculator:
	
1.	Display the College Calculator.
	
	 Click the Planning tab. Click the Financial Calculators button. Choose 
the College Savings command. Quicken displays the College Calculator 
dialog box, shown in Figure 10-6. 
	
Figure 10-6: 
Use the 
College 
Calculator 
dialog box 
to determine 
whether 
you’ll have 
to take out 
a second 
mortgage 
to pay for 
Junior’s 
college 
education.
	

169
 Chapter 10: Compound Interest Magic and Other Mysteries
	
2.	Enter the annual college costs.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Annual College Costs text box. Then type the 
current annual costs at a school Junior may attend. Figure 10-6 shows 
this amount as $20,000.
	
3.	Enter the number of years until enrollment.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Years Until Enrollment text box and type a 
number. For example, if Junior will start college in 10 years, type 10.
	
4.	Enter the number of years enrolled.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Number Of Years Enrolled text box and type a 
number. Assuming that Junior doesn’t fool around, type 4 or 5.
	
5.	Enter the amount of the current college savings.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Current College Savings field and type an 
amount. Figure 10-6 shows this amount as $20,000. Perhaps Grandpa has 
really come through for little Junior on this.
	
6.	Enter the annual yield that you expect the college savings to earn.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Annual Yield text box and type the percent. 
Figure 10-6 shows the yield as 9 percent.
	
7.	Enter the inflation rate anticipated in college tuition.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Predicted Inflation text box and type the inflation 
rate percent. Figure 10-6 shows this rate as 4 percent.
	
8.	Indicate whether you plan to increase your annual contribution as a 
result of inflation.
	
	 Select the Inflate Contributions check box if you plan to annually 
increase — by the annual inflation rate — the amount you save. Figure 
10-6 shows this check box selected.
After you enter all the information, click Calculate or move the selection 
cursor. The Annual Contribution field shows how much you need to save 
each year until the child graduates from college.
Just to beat this thing to death, Figure 10-6 shows that the lucky student will 
attend five years at a college that currently costs $20,000 per year and that you 
expect to earn 9 percent annually and anticipate 4 percent annual inflation. 
Given these cold hard facts, you need to start saving $3,663.95 every year.
	
Because I’m a CPA, I want to offer you a quick tax-planning tip. If you do 
embark on a serious college savings program for a child or grandchild, take 
a look at the Sec. 529 college savings plans that are offered by most banks, 

170
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
brokers, and mutual fund companies. With a Sec. 529 plan, neither you nor the 
future college student gets taxed on the interest the college savings earn as 
long as the money is ultimately used for college expenses.
To get more information on the annual deposits, tuition, and balance, click 
the Schedule button, which appears on the face of the College Calculator 
dialog box. Quicken whips up a quick little report showing the annual depos­
its, tuition, and ending college savings account balances for each year you 
add to, and Junior withdraws from, the college savings money.
If you’re now bummed out 
about college costs
Look at the positive side: You now understand the size of the problem and 
the solution.
College planning depends on four things:
	
✓	College costs
	
✓	The number of years that the savings earn interest
	
✓	The real yield (that is, adjusted for inflation) you earn — in other words, 
the annual yield minus the predicted inflation
	
✓	The yearly payments
I don’t mean to sound like a simpleton, but you can successfully save for a 
college education in three basic ways:
	
✓	Reduce the costs (find a less expensive school)
	
✓	Invest in things that deliver higher yields
	
✓	Boost the yearly payments
Use the Calculate For option buttons (refer to Figure 10-6) to compute a 
specific financial variable. Select the variable you want to calculate and then 
input the other values. The College Calculator computes the flagged variable.
	
Finding a less expensive school isn’t necessarily the same thing as looking for 
the cheapest tuition fees. Another huge factor these days is whether a pro­
gram takes four years or five years to complete. A cheap-tuition school that 
requires five years may be more expensive than, say, a good private school 
that gets a student out — and working — in four years.

 Chapter 10: Compound Interest Magic and Other Mysteries
Planning for Taxes
Quicken also comes with a very powerful, very useful Tax Planner. The Tax 
Planner helps you make a precise estimate of the taxes that you’ll owe. To 
use the Tax Planner, take the following steps:
	
1.	Display the Tax Planner.
	
	 Click the Planning tab. Click the Tax Tools button. Choose the Tax 
Planner command. Quicken displays the Tax Planner window. To move 
past the introductory information, click Let’s Get Started and then click 
Next. Quicken shows the second page (see Figure 10-7). 
	
	 Note: Quicken may display a dialog box that asks whether you want to 
learn how TurboTax can help with year-round tax planning. Click No if 
you see this message. You have my help.
	
Figure 10-7: 
The second 
page of the 
Tax Planner 
window.
	
	
2.	Verify the tax year and filing status.
	
	 In the upper-left corner of the Tax Planner window, notice that the tax 
year (labeled Year) and the filing status (labeled Status) appear. These 
are probably correct. Quicken can guess the year by looking at your 
computer’s clock. It determines your filing status based on information 
that you supply when you set up Quicken. But if one of these bits of 

172
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
information is wrong, click the Year or Status hyperlink. The hyperlinks 
are those bits of text along the left edge of the Tax Planner window. 
Quicken displays the Tax Planner Options text boxes, which let you 
specify the Tax Year and the Filing Status and choose a Scenario.
	
	Note: A Scenario is just a set of income tax inputs. You may have only 
one Scenario. Or you may have several Scenarios based on different 
guesses about your income and deductions.
	
3.	Enter the wages and salaries that you and your lovely or handsome 
spouse expect.
	
	 Click the Wages hyperlink. Then, when Quicken displays the Wages text 
boxes, type your wages and, if you’re married, those of your spouse. 
Quicken totals your wages and then makes a first rough calculation 
of the amount you’ll owe in taxes. Of course, Quicken needs to collect 
some more data before this number is accurate, so don’t freak out yet.
	
	 You can move to the next set of input text boxes by clicking the Next 
hyperlink and to the previous window of input text boxes by clicking the 
Previous hyperlink. The Next and Previous hyperlinks appear near the 
bottom of the Tax Planner window. (You may have to scroll down to see 
them on your computer.)
	
4.	Enter the other income you’ll have from interest, dividends, capital 
gains, and so on.
	
	 To record the other income that you’ll need to pay taxes on, click the 
Interest/Dividend Inc, Business Income, Capital Gains, and Other Income 
hyperlinks and provide the information that Quicken requests. Some 
of these numbers are pretty easy to guess. Some of them aren’t. You 
can also look at last year’s tax return or at the year-to-date information 
you’ve already collected by using Quicken.
	
5.	Identify any adjustments to your gross income.
	
	 Click the Adjustments hyperlink and then, using the Adjustments to 
Income text boxes, identify or estimate any adjustments to gross income 
that you’ll have. Most people make only one adjustment — contributions 
to a deductible IRA. Self-employed individuals, however, also typically 
have several other adjustments, including half of their self-employment 
tax (which Quicken automatically calculates and enters), a portion of 
any health insurance paid, and Keogh and SEP pension contributions.
	
6.	Estimate your itemized deductions.
	
	 Click the Deductions hyperlink and then use the Standard and Itemized 
Deductions text boxes to estimate your deductions for expenses, such 
as state and local taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions. 
Alternatively, if you’ll probably or possibly use the standard deduction, 
carefully check any of the boxes that Quicken uses to determine which 
standard deduction you should use.

173
 Chapter 10: Compound Interest Magic and Other Mysteries
	
7.	Tell Quicken how many personal exemptions you’ll claim.
	
	 Click the Exemptions hyperlink and then specify the number of depen­
dents you’ll claim on your return. The basic rule is that you get one 
exemption for every person in your family (you, your spouse if you’re 
filing jointly, and your kids) as long as they live in your house. I should 
mention, however, that things become tricky if you have shirt-tail rela­
tives (your Aunt Enid, for example) living at your house, if your kids live 
away from home or are married, or if some of the kids in the house have 
divorced parents. If you have questions because one of these situations 
sounds vaguely familiar, get the IRS preparation instructions and read 
the part about who is and is not a dependent.
	
8.	Indicate whether you owe any other taxes or have tax credits you can 
use to reduce your taxes.
	
	 Click the Other Tax, Credits hyperlink and then use the Other Taxes & 
Credits text boxes to describe any of the federal taxes you’ll pay in addi­
tion to the usual federal income tax. The other taxes, by the way, typi­
cally include just two taxes: self-employment tax (which is the tax that 
self-employed people pay in place of Social Security and Medicare tax) 
and, in special cases, the alternative minimum tax. A bunch of different 
tax credits exist. You can very possibly look at your prior years’ returns 
to see if they apply (typically) in your situation.
	
9.	Enter any estimated taxes you’ve paid or any federal income taxes 
your employer has withheld from your paycheck.
	
	 Click the Withholding hyperlink and use the Withholding text boxes to 
record how much money you’ve paid through withholding. Then click 
the Tax Payments hyperlink and use the Estimated Tax Payments text 
boxes to record how much you’ve paid in estimated tax payments and 
to guess how much you’ll pay in the coming months.
	
10.	Return to the Tax Planner Summary and review the Quicken pro­
gram’s calculations.
	
	 After you complete the preceding steps, click the Tax Planner Summary 
hyperlink and review the calculations that Quicken makes. Quicken esti­
mates the total tax you’ll pay (which is useful and interesting in itself), 
the estimated refund or payment you’ll have to make, and one other 
particularly useful bit of information — your marginal income tax rate 
(which Quicken labels Marginal Rate). If you want to print a copy of the 
Tax Planner’s information and calculations, click Print (in the upper-
right corner of the window).
	
Knowing your marginal income tax rate enables you to make more precise 
investment calculations. For example, the Retirement Calculator — described 
earlier in the chapter in the section cleverly titled, “The Retirement 
Calculator” — uses your marginal income tax rate to make more precise 

174
Part II: The Absolute Basics 
calculations. You can also use the marginal income tax rate to calculate the 
after-tax return that taxable investments deliver. Simply multiply the taxable 
return by the factor (1 – marginal tax rate).
The Other Planning Tools
In the preceding pages of this chapter, I talk about the personal financial 
planning tools that are most useful. Before I wrap up my discussion, let me 
quickly mention that Quicken provides some other interesting and, for some 
people, useful tax and financial planning tools.
If you open the Tax Tools menu, for example, you’ll notice Tax Category 
Audit, Deduction Finder, Itemized Deduction Finder, and Tax Withholding 
Estimator commands. These calculation tools walk you through specific tax 
accounting and planning projects — and may be helpful to some taxpayers. 
If you open the Other Tools menu, you’ll notice two commands: Cash Flow 
Forecast and Debt Reduction Planner. These two command wizards walk you 
through the steps to planning for your personal cash flows or working your 
way out from under your debts. In my opinion, most people won’t be inter­
ested in taking the time to use the wizards. But if you’re really serious or wor­
ried or compulsive about one of these topics, well, it just may be worth your 
time to explore a bit.

A
re you going to be using Quicken for your personal 
financial stuff? If so, you should know that this pro­
gram offers more than just the checkbook-on-a-computer 
business that I describe in Part II. Quicken can help you 
manage and monitor such things as credit cards, home 
mortgages, and investments. If this stuff sounds interest­
ing, keep reading.

Chapter 11
Credit Cards, Petty Cash, 
and PayPal
In This Chapter
▶	Tracking credit cards with Quicken
▶	Setting up a credit card account
▶	Selecting a credit card account so that you can use it
▶	Recording a credit card charge
▶	Changing charges you’ve already entered
▶	Paying a credit card bill
▶	Reconciling a credit card balance
▶	Deciding whether to use Online Account Access
▶	Tracking cash with Quicken
▶	Tracking PayPal with Quicken
You can use Quicken to track your credit cards and even the cash in your 
pocket in much the same way that you use Quicken to keep a checkbook. 
Tracking these items uses a nearly identical process — with a few wrinkles.
First, however, I need to discuss whether you should even bother.
Tracking a Credit Card
Of course, if you do carry a credit card balance — and about 50 percent of 
people do — you can set up a Quicken credit card account and use it for 
tracking credit card purchases. If you just need to keep track of how much 
you charge during the month (even if you’re going to pay the balance in full), 
you must also set up a credit card account and use it. I should make one 
other point: In order to track not just what you charge (by using spending 
categories) but also where you charge it (by using the Payee field), you must 
set up a credit card account and use it.

178
Part III: Home Finances 
I don’t use Quicken to track my credit card purchases because I pay my credit 
card balance in full every month. (Don’t feel bad if you don’t — it’s like a natu­
ral law that CPAs like me must do this.) Therefore, I don’t have an open credit 
card balance to track. What’s more, when I pay the monthly credit card bill, 
I can easily use the Split Transaction window to describe my spending cat­
egories: $3.53 on food for lunch, $52.64 for car repair, and $217.54 for books 
(a dangerous, and ultimately destructive, personal weakness). If you’re in the 
same boat — meaning you use a credit card but you don’t carry a balance — 
you don’t need anything special to track your credit card purchases. And, 
of course, you don’t need to use Quicken to tell you your account balance 
because it’s always zeroed-out at the end of the month.
How to Set Up a Credit Card Account
If you want to track credit card spending and balances with Quicken, you 
must set up a special credit card account. (In comparison, you use bank 
accounts to track other things, such as the money that flows into and out of a 
checking account.)
Adding a credit card account
To set up a credit card account, you follow roughly the same steps as you do 
to set up a bank account. Here’s what you do:
	
1.	Display the Quicken Home page.
	
	 You can do this by clicking the Home tab. Figure 11-1 shows the Quicken 
Home page.
	
2.	Click the Add Account button.
	
	 The Add button appears in the lower left-hand corner, by the way. (I 
mention this because the button is a little hard to spot.) Quicken dis­
plays the Quicken Account Setup dialog box.
	
3.	Tell Quicken you’re setting up a credit card account.
	
	 Select the Credit Card option button when Quicken asks what type of 
account you want to set up (see Figure 11-2). Then, click Next to display 
the Quicken Account Setup dialog box (or boxes) that ask about the 
financial institution foolish enough to issue you a credit card.

you want to

	 Quicken displays one or two dialog boxes that ask for the name of the 
credit card issuer. The first “identify your financial institution” dialog 
box, shown in Figure 11-3, lets you enter the issuer name or part of the 
name into a text box or, alternatively, lets you use buttons to generate 

180
Part III: Home Finances 
a list of credit card issuers (mostly banks) that begin with, for example, 
the word bank or the letter L. Alternatively, you can mark an option 
button that indicates you don’t want to identify your credit card issuer. 
A second “identify your financial institution” dialog box — which may 
not even appear, depending on whether your entries into the first dialog 
box accurately identify the credit card issuer — allows you to enter the 
name of the credit card company into the text box that asks you for 
the name of your financial institution, at which point Quicken asks you 
to select the financial institution from its list — or just use the name 
you entered. You click Next to display the next Quicken Account Setup 
dialog box, which you use to name the account.
	
5.	Name the account and then click Next.
	
	 Why not? Move the cursor to the Name This Account text box and type a 
name. After you click Next, Quicken displays the Quicken Account Setup 
dialog box that lets you provide the account balance on a specific date, 
as shown in Figure 11-4.
	
6.	Enter the date on which you will start keeping records for the credit 
card account.
	
	 You should probably choose the date of your last statement, like 
Quicken suggests. Move the cursor to the Statement Ending Date text 
box and type the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. August 31, 2010, for 
example, should be entered as 8/31/2010. 
	
7.	Enter the balance you owed at the end of the last credit card billing 
period after making your payment. Then click Next.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Statement Ending Balance text box and type the 
balance value by using the number keys. After you click Next, Quicken dis­
plays the sixth Quicken Account Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-5.

credit card company has arbitrarily decided is a reasonable balance for 
you to shoulder.
	
9.	Click Next and then Done.
	
	 Click Next, and Quicken displays a message that the account setup is 
complete. Just click Done. Quicken finally gets the message and re-
displays the Quicken Home page shown in Figure 11-1.

182
Part III: Home Finances 
Note: As you complete the credit card account setup, Quicken may also 
display a message that urges you to sign up for your credit card company’s 
online banking services. For now, ignore this. If you later want to sign up, just 
tell your bank, and it’ll help you get set up.
Selecting a credit card account 
so that you can use it
To tell Quicken that you want to work with an account, you use the Accounts 
bar. Just click the credit card account’s name.
	
You can also use the Account List window to get to the new credit card 
account — or to any other account, too. To get to the Account List window 
again, choose Tools➪Account List and then select the account you want to 
work with.
After you select the account you want, Quicken displays the register for that 
account so that you can begin recording transactions (which I describe in the 
next section).
How to Enter Credit Card Transactions
After you select a credit card account, Quicken displays a special version of 
the register, as shown in Figure 11-6.
Touring the credit card register
The credit card register works like the regular register that you use for a 
bank account. You enter transactions into the rows of the register. After you 
record a charge, Quicken updates the credit card balance and the remaining 
credit limit (if you entered the optional credit limit information when you set 
up the account).
You can use the same techniques and commands as you do for your regular 
ol’ bank account register. I talk about these in earlier chapters, so I won’t 
regurgitate those discussions here.

Recording a credit card charge
Recording a credit card charge is similar to recording a check or bank 
account withdrawal. For the sake of illustration, suppose that you charge 
$30.57 for dinner at your favorite Mexican restaurant. Here’s how you record 
this charge:
	
1.	Enter the charge date.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there) and type the 
date using the MM/DD format. For example, enter September 1, 2010, as 
9/1. You usually don’t have to type the year because Quicken retrieves 
the current year number from the little clock inside your computer. Or, 
if you want, get crazy — click the box that remotely resembles a calen­
dar at the end of the field, and Quicken displays a pop-up calendar (see 
Chapter 4 for more information) from which you can select the appropri­
ate month and day.
	
	Don’t bother with the Ref field. Quicken supplies it so that you can 
record the credit card reference number — a bit of data that’s usually 
about 20 characters long. You, my friend, have better things to do with 
your time, however. So just skip the field.
	
2.	Record the name of the business you paid with a credit card.

184
Part III: Home Finances 
	
	 Move the cursor to the Payee field and type the name of the person or 
business you paid. If the restaurant is Florencia’s Cantina, for example, 
type Florencia’s Cantina into the Payee field.
	
3.	Enter the charge amount.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Charge field and type the total charge amount — 
30.57 in this example. Don’t type a dollar sign, but do type the period to 
indicate the decimal place and cents.
	
4.	Enter the category.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Category field, open the drop-down list box, and 
select the appropriate category. You may categorize a restaurant charge 
as Dining, for example.
	
5.	(Optional) Enter a memo description.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Memo field and type the specific reason you’re 
charging the item, such as a special date with your spouse or an impor­
tant business meeting. The Memo file — just so you know — only 
appears when the register display is set to Two-Line Display mode. 
	
6.	Record the charge and click the Enter button.
	
	Quicken beeps and then calculates both the new credit card balance and 
the remaining credit limit. Quicken then moves the cursor to the next 
slot in the register.
Figure 11-7 shows the charge at Florencia’s. Good food and reasonable 
prices — you can’t ask for much more than that.
Changing charges you’ve already entered
Use the arrow keys or click the mouse to highlight the charge that you want 
to change. Use Tab and Shift+Tab or the mouse to move the cursor to the 
field that contains the misinformation you want to fix. You can then fix the 
entry and record the transaction by clicking the Enter button. That’s easy 
enough, isn’t it?
Paying credit card bills
If you’re tracking the credit card account balance with a credit card account 
like the one I’m describing here, Quicken provides two ways for you to pay a 
credit card bill.
Note: If you’re not using a credit card account in Quicken, you record the 
check you send to pay a credit card bill in the same way you record any other 
check. And that means you don’t have to read anything I’m about to say.

185
 Chapter 11: Credit Cards, Petty Cash, and PayPal
	
Figure 11-7: 
The 
charge at 
Florencia’s 
Cantina.
	
A most bodacious way to pay a credit card bill
This method is pretty simple, so don’t blink your eyes because you may miss 
the action.
Look at your credit card statement. Decide how much you want to pay. Select 
the bank account on which you’ll write the check. Then write the check and 
record it in the bank account register — but as a transfer to the credit card 
account.
You’re done. If you have questions, take a peek at the selected check transac­
tion shown in Figure 11-8. It pays $30.57 of the credit card balance. The only 
trick — if you want to call it that — is that the credit card account is speci­
fied as the account to which the money is transferred. (You can see the other 
account by right-clicking the transaction and choosing Go To Transfer, or 
you can click the other account’s QuickTab, of course.)
If you could look at the credit card account register now — of course, you 
can’t because you’re not sitting in front of my computer — you would see 
that this check reduces the credit card balance by $30.57.

A less bodacious way to pay a credit card bill
You can also tell Quicken that you want to pay some portion of the credit 
card bill as part of reconciling the credit card’s account balance. What will 
happen is that after you reconcile the credit card account, Quicken will (or 
may) ask whether you want to make a payment. If you say you do, Quicken 
prompts you to describe the payment.
I think that this method is slightly more difficult. But if you want to reconcile 
your credit card account, think about using this second method. If you’re recon­
ciling a credit card statement and paying some portion of the credit card balance 
at the same time, you may find this method more convenient. Who knows?
I describe how to reconcile a credit card account in the very next section.
Reconciling That Crazy Account
You know that trick in which you compare your checking account records 
with your bank’s records of your checking account? The one in which you 
calculate the difference between what you think is your account balance and 
what the bank thinks is your balance? And this difference is supposed to 
equal the total of the transactions floating around out there in the system? 
You can use this same trick on your credit card account.

187
 Chapter 11: Credit Cards, Petty Cash, and PayPal
To reconcile a credit card account, first get your credit card statement. Next, 
display the credit card account in a transaction list window.
What the nasty credit card company says
To tell Quicken what that nasty credit card company says, follow these steps 
and put on some music if you can’t seem to get the rhythm thing right:
	
1.	Click the Account Actions button on the transaction list window and 
choose the Reconcile command.
	
	 Quicken displays the Statement Summary: Credit Card dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 11-9.
	
Figure 11-9: 
The 
Statement 
Summary: 
Credit Card 
dialog box.
	
	
2.	Enter the charges and cash advances that your statement shows.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Charges, Cash Advances text box and then type 
the number.
	
3.	Enter the payment and credits that your statement shows.
	
	 You know the drill: Move the cursor to the Payments, Credits text box 
and type the number.
	
4.	Enter the new balance shown on the credit card statement.
	
	 Now I bet this is a surprise. Go ahead and type the figure in the Ending 
Balance text box — even if you just can’t believe you charged that much.
	
5.	Enter the ending statement date.
	
	 I don’t know why Quicken is now collecting this piece of information. 
For more than ten years, Quicken has been able to reconcile your credit 
card account (and any other account) without this snidbit of data.

188
Part III: Home Finances 
	
6.	Enter the monthly interest charge by using the Finance Charges text box.
	
	 Pause for a moment of silence here if this topic makes you sad, sad, sad.
	
7.	Assign the monthly interest to the appropriate spending category, 
such as Interest Exp.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Category text box and type the category name. 
(Are you getting bored yet? I know: move and type . . . move and type . . . 
all I ever seem to say is “move and type.”) Remember that you can click 
the little down arrow at the end of the text box to see a list of categories 
to select from.
	
8.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken displays the Statement Summary: Credit Card window (see 
Figure 11-10). Use this window to tell Quicken which credit card charges 
and payments appear on your statement. (This step is akin to looking 
at a bank statement and noting which checks and deposits have cleared 
the bank.)
	
Figure 11-10: 
The 
Statement 
Summary: 
Credit Card 
window.
	
Ouch! Did I really spend that much?
After you give Quicken an overview of your credit card situation, you can 
note which charges have cleared and which charges have not.

189
 Chapter 11: Credit Cards, Petty Cash, and PayPal
If you’re comfortable whipping through a bank reconciliation, you can proba­
bly do this reconciliation with your eyes closed. If you need some help, leave 
your eyes open so that you can read these steps:
	
1.	Find the first charge listed on the credit card statement.
	
2.	Mark the charge as cleared.
	
	 Charges are listed in the left list box. If you charged a bunch of stuff, 
scroll through the transactions listed in the Charges window until you 
find the charge. After you see a charge that appears on your credit card 
statement, click it. Or select the charge by using the arrow keys and 
then press the spacebar. Quicken adds the check mark symbol in front 
of the list entry in the Clr column to mark this charge as cleared and 
then updates the cleared statement balance.
	
3.	Enter any missing charges.
	
	 If you can’t find a charge, you probably didn’t enter it in the Quicken 
register yet. Open the credit card account register by clicking its tab 
and then enter the charge into the register in the usual way — except 
enter a c (the letter c) into the Clr column by clicking the Clr field. By 
doing so, you identify the charge as one that’s already cleared. After you 
finish, click the Return To Reconcile button to return to the Statement 
Summary: Credit Card window.
	
4.	Repeat Steps 1–3 for charges listed on the credit card statement.
	
	 Or until you’re blue in the face.
	
5.	Find the first payment or credit listed on the credit card statement.
	
	 Any payments and credits appear in the right list box.
	
6.	Mark the payment or credit as cleared.
	
	 Scroll through the transactions listed in the Payments window until you 
find the first payment or credit and then click it. Or select the credit 
and then press the spacebar. Quicken adds the check mark symbol in 
front of the list entry to mark the payment or credit as cleared and then 
updates the cleared statement balance.
	
7.	Enter any missing payments or credits.
	
	 If you can’t find the payment or credit — you probably know what I’m 
going to say — it means you haven’t entered it into the Quicken register 
yet. Open the credit card account register by clicking its tab, and then 
enter the payment or credit into the register in the usual way, but put 
a c in the Clr column. When you finish, click the Return To Reconcile 
button to return to the Statement Summary: Credit Card window.
	
8.	Repeat Steps 5–7 for payments or credits listed on the credit card 
statement.

190
Part III: Home Finances 
If you record a transaction wrong, do this
As you’re looking through the credit card statement, you may discover that 
you incorrectly recorded a transaction. If this happens, display the credit 
card register so that you can make the necessary fixes.
Oh, that explains the difference
After you mark all the cleared charges and payments, the difference between 
the cleared balance for the credit card and the statement’s ending balance 
should be zero.
Figure 11-11 shows how this looks. By the way, reconciling with fictitious 
data is darned easy.
	
Figure 11-11: 
When the 
difference 
between 
the cleared 
balance and 
the state-
ment is zero, 
the recon-
ciliation is 
complete.
	
If you’re ready to finish
If the difference does equal zero, you’re cool. You’re golden. You’re done. 
(Sort of makes you sound like fried chicken, doesn’t it?)
All you need to do is click Finished to tell Quicken that you’re done. Quicken 
asks you whether you want to make a credit card payment. Jump ahead to the 
“Paying the bill as part of the reconciliation” section for help doing just that.

191
 Chapter 11: Credit Cards, Petty Cash, and PayPal
If the difference doesn’t equal zero, you have a problem. If you clicked 
Finished in spite of the problem, Quicken displays a message that has some 
cursory explanation as to why your account doesn’t balance. This message 
also tells you that you can force the two amounts to agree by pressing Enter.
Forcing the two amounts to agree isn’t a very good idea, though. To make the 
balances agree, Quicken adds a cleared transaction equal to the difference. 
(Quicken asks for a category if you choose the adjustment route.)
Despite the ease of making adjustments, you should still correct the error 
responsible for the difference.
Chapter 8 provides some ideas for trying to figure out why a bank account 
that should balance doesn’t. You can apply the same list of tips to credit card 
reconciliations if you’re in a bad way.
If you want to postpone the inevitable
You can postpone reconciling the account by clicking the Finish Later 
button. When you click this button, you abandon your reconciliation work. 
Transactions that you mark as cleared still show the c in the Clr text box. You 
still have an inexplicable difference between the credit card statement and 
your register. Even so, postponing a reconciliation is usually better than forcing 
the cleared balance to equal the credit card statement balance. By postponing 
a reconciliation, you can hopefully find the problem or problems and fix them. 
Then you can restart the reconciliation and finish your work. (You restart a 
credit card reconciliation in the same way that you originally start one.)
When you finish, Quicken redisplays the Transactions tab. You may notice 
that when you mark credit card transactions as cleared, Quicken puts a c 
in the Clr column of the credit card register. When you finish reconciling 
the credit card account, Quicken changes all these cs to Rs. None of what 
Quicken does here is magical. Quicken just makes this change to identify the 
transactions that have already been through the reconciliation process. (The 
c shows that a transaction has been marked as cleared. The R shows that a 
transaction has been reconciled.)
Paying the bill as part of the reconciliation
After you finish reconciling the credit card account, Quicken does two things. 
First, if some of the stuff in the credit card register doesn’t agree with the 
credit card statement, Quicken displays a message box to alert you to these, 
er, discrepancies and then suggests you let Quicken bring your records 
into agreement with the statement (see Figure 11-12). To synchronize your 
records with the credit card statement, verify that Quicken is using a reason­
able expense category to “categorize” the discrepancy and then click Adjust.

192
Part III: Home Finances 
	
Figure 11-12: 
The 
Adjusting 
Register To 
Agree With 
Statement 
dialog box.
	
Quicken also does a second thing after you finish reconciling a credit card 
account. Quicken asks whether you want to pay the bill. Figure 11-13 shows 
the Make Credit Card Payment dialog box, which is the tool that Quicken 
uses to collect the necessary data. You simply identify the bank account on 
which you want to write the check and indicate whether you’ll use a printed 
check or a handwritten check. Quicken then records a check that pays the 
credit card balance into the register. You can edit, print, and do whatever 
else you want to do with this check in the usual way.
	
Figure 11-13: 
The Make 
Credit Card 
Payment 
dialog box.
	
The Online Banking Hoopla
As I briefly mention in Chapter 6, Quicken supports online banking. If you 
have your credit card with a credit card company — probably a bank — that 
is set up to handle Quicken online banking, you can grab your credit card 
statement directly from the credit card company. If you have a checking 
account at the bank that issued the credit card, you can also pay your credit 
card bill simply by transferring money from your checking account to your 
credit card. (This feature is actually pretty slick, I have to say.)
The big hoopla concerning this feature — at least as it relates to credit 
cards — is that you don’t have to enter the credit card transactions into a 
register. Rather, you retrieve them by using an Internet connection.

193
 Chapter 11: Credit Cards, Petty Cash, and PayPal
Should you even bother?
Is the online-banking-with-a-credit-card-thing a feature that you should look 
into? Does it really save you time? Is it a good deal? Inquiring minds want to 
know, so I’ll tell you what I think. (I should point out that what I’m about to 
say next is just my humble opinion.)
I think that online banking in general is well worth the fee you probably have 
to pay for the service when you consider the time savings. You’ll probably 
pay only a few dollars a month. (What you pay depends on the bank issuing 
the credit card.)
Something bothers me about the whole deal, however: You really just receive 
an electronic version of your statement, which means — at least from my 
perspective — that you’re more likely not to see erroneous transactions. 
And reconciling your bank statement against, well, your bank statement isn’t 
going to make a whole heck of a lot of sense. (Golly, gee, Batman, the charge 
to Edna’s Pet School appears on both statements, too!)
How to use Online Account Access 
with your credit card
Okay, so you’ve listened to my side of the story, but you still want to use the 
Quicken Online Account Access feature with your credit card — and your 
bank is one that provides this service. “What next?” you’re wondering.
Here’s the answer: You set up online credit card accounts the same way you 
set up online bank accounts. Note: For more information about the Quicken 
Online Account Access feature, see Chapter 6.
Petty Cash and Mad Money
You can track petty cash in your business as well as the petty cash in your 
wallet by using a special Quicken cash account. To track the cash, you must 
set up a cash account and then enter the increases and decreases into the 
cash account’s register. Sure, this stuff isn’t exactly rocket science, but 
shoot, I thought I’d just quickly go over it to show you how easy it really is. 
Okay?

Part III: Home Finances 
Adding a cash account
To set up a cash account, you follow roughly the same steps as you do for 
setting up a bank account. Because you’ve probably already set up a bank 
account, you can move quickly through the following steps to set up a cash 
account:
	
1.	Display the Quicken Home page.
	
	 Click the Home tab. Quicken displays the Quicken Home page (refer to 
Figure 11-1). You remember this puppy.
	
2.	Click the Add Account button to set up a new account.
	
	 Quicken, of course, is no fool, so it displays the Quicken Account Setup 
dialog box. The Add Account button appears in the lower-left corner of 
the window.
	
3.	Set up a cash account.
	
	 You can guess how to do this, can’t you? You simply step through 
Quicken’s questions about the account you want to set up. You need 
to give the account a name, for example, such as cash or pocket money. 
And you need to provide a starting balance value using the faithful, 
familiar Quicken Account Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-14.
	
Figure 11-14: 
The final

	 When you finish describing the cash account, click Done. Quicken dis­
plays the new cash account in a register window.

 Chapter 11: Credit Cards, Petty Cash, and PayPal
Tracking cash inflows and outflows
After you set up a cash account, you can use it to track the cash you receive 
and spend in the same way that you track the deposits and checks for a bank 
account.
To record your cash inflows and outflows, use the QuickTab for the account, 
which should appear on the Accounts bar. Figure 11-15 shows the cash 
account version of the register. Until you start entering transactions, only the 
first opening balance transaction shows.
To record the amount of money you spend, fill in the Date, Payee, and Spend 
fields. To record the amount of money you receive, fill in the Date, Payee, and 
Receive fields. To track the reasons that you’re receiving and spending the 
cash, use the Memo and Category fields.
	
Figure 11-15:

account

196
Part III: Home Finances 
Recording checks you cash 
instead of deposit
	
By the way, you don’t necessarily need to set up a cash account if you like to 
spend cash (rather than, say, write checks or charge on a credit card). If you 
just cash a check and you do have a bank account set up, you can record the 
transaction in another way that may be simpler: Just use the Split Transaction 
window to show both the income category (Salary, for example, for an indi­
vidual) and how you’re going to use the money.
For example, if you cash a $1,000 check and you plan to use the $1,000 for 
spending money, you may show a positive $1,000 in the Salary category and 
a negative $1,000 in the Entertainment spending category. Figure 11-16 shows 
this trick.
Note that the transaction shown in Figure 11-16 produces a transaction 
that equals zero. This is correct. Cashing a check that you never deposited 
doesn’t affect your checking account balance. But by filling out the Split 
Transaction window, as shown in Figure 11-16, you do end up recording both 
the $1,000 of income and the $1,000 of expense.
Don’t worry. I won’t ask why you’re carrying around $1,000 in cash.

Updating cash balances
You can update a register’s cash balance to reflect what you actually have 
in petty cash, your wallet, under the mattress, in the cookie jar, or wherever 
else you keep your cash, by taking the following steps:
	
1.	Display the cash account register.
	
2.	Click the Account Actions button and choose Update Balance.
	
	 Quicken displays the Update Account Balance: Cash Account dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 11-17.
	
3.	Enter the actual cash balance in the Update Balance To text box.
	
4.	Enter a date in the Adjustment Date text box.
	
5.	Choose the category that you want to update in the Category For 
Adjustment drop-down list box.
	
	 After you click the arrow to the right of the drop-down list box, you get a 
list of all the categories that you have set up.

PayPal Can Be Quicken’s Friend
One final point before I end this discussion.
If you use PayPal, you can and should use Quicken to track the money 
flowing into and out of your PayPal account. Fortunately, tracking a PayPal 
account with Quicken is pretty dang easy.

198
Part III: Home Finances 
To track PayPal using Quicken, you just want to remember these three 
points:
	
✓	A PayPal account is really just another bank account, albeit a special 
sort of bank account. Accordingly, you want to set up a Quicken PayPal 
account in the same way that you set up any other Quicken bank 
account. (Refer to Chapter 2 for additional information about setting up 
a bank account.)
	
✓	If you use your credit card to pay money into the PayPal account, you’re 
actually transferring money from your credit card account to your 
PayPal account. To record this transfer, you record a credit card charge 
into your credit card register (similar to the charge made to Florencia’s 
Cantina shown in Figure 11-7). However, rather than use a Quicken cat­
egory, you specify the PayPal account.
	
✓	You should reconcile your PayPal account just like any other bank 
account or credit card account. During this reconciliation, be sure to 
record any PayPal charges.
And one final snidbit for people who really want to push the envelope: PayPal 
will allow you to download your transaction history into a QIF file, which 
can then be imported into Quicken. You may want to refer to Quicken’s and 
PayPal’s online help for more information.

A
 popular, financial self-help writer thinks that one of the secrets to finan­
cial success is using other people’s money: the bank’s, the mortgage 
company’s, the credit people’s, your brother-in-law’s. . . . You get the idea.
Me? I’m not so sure that using other people’s money is the key to financial 
success. Borrowing other people’s money can turn into a nightmare.
Quicken can help you here. No, the folks at Intuit won’t make your loan pay­
ments for you. But in a way, they do something even better: They provide 
you with a tool to monitor the money you owe other people and the costs of 
your debts.
Should You Bother to Track Your Debts?
I think that tracking your debts — car loans, mortgages, student loans, and so 
on — is a good idea when lenders fail to tell you the amount that you’re paying 
in annual interest or the amount you owe after each and every payment.
If your lenders are doing a good job at keeping you informed, I don’t think 
that using Quicken for this purpose makes much sense. Heck, it’s their 
money. They can do the work, right?

200
Part III: Home Finances 
Let me make one more observation. If lenders have half a clue, they send you 
a United States 1098 tax form at the end of every year. The number shown on 
that form equals your tax deduction if the interest stems from a mortgage, 
business, or investment loan. Note that personal interest expenses aren’t 
deductible anymore, so you shouldn’t track them unless you really want to 
be mean to yourself.
How Do You Get Started?
To track other people’s money with Quicken, you must set up a liability 
account. Setting up one of these babies is easy. Just remember that you 
must set up a liability account for every loan or debt you want to track: one 
account for your mortgage, another for your car loan, still another for your 
student loan, and so on.
Setting up a liability account 
for an amortized loan
An amortized loan is one on which you make regular, equal payments. Over 
time, the principal portion of each payment pays off, or amortizes, the loan 
principal. If you borrowed money to purchase a house, a car, a Winnebago, 
or anything else that’s really expensive and that you pay off over several 
years, chances are that your loan is of the amortizing variety.
Setting up a loan account requires a few dozen steps, but none of the steps 
are difficult. And none takes that much time to complete. As long as you have 
your loan information handy — the loan amount, interest rate, balance, and 
so on — setting up this type of account is a snap.
Here’s the recipe for setting up a liability account:
	
1.	Click the Add Account button.
	
	 The Add Account button appears in the lower-left corner of many 
Quicken tabs, including the Home page and the Banking tab.
	
2.	Tell Quicken you want to set up a loan account.
	
	 When Quicken displays the Account Setup dialog box, click Loan and then 
Next. Quicken displays the Loan Setup dialog box. Click the Summary tab 
to see the dialog box exactly as it’s shown here (see Figure 12-1).

201
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money
	
Figure 12-1: 
The Loan 
Setup 
dialog box.
	
	
3.	Provide some basic background information. Then click Next.
	
	Use the Loan Type option buttons to specify whether you’re borrowing 
money or lending money. Use the New Account text box to name the 
new loan account something clever like mortgage or car loan. And use 
the Have Any Payments Been Made? option buttons to indicate, well, 
whether you’ve started making payments yet. After you click Next, 
Quicken displays another set of boxes and buttons, shown in Figure 12-2.
	
Figure 12-2: 
Another 
Loan Setup 
dialog box.
	
	
4.	Enter the date that you borrowed the money in the Opening Date text 
box; or, if your loan has a grace period (like a student loan), enter the 
date when your loan enters the repayment period.
	
	Quicken needs to know this date so that it can calculate the interest the 
loan started to accrue when you borrowed the money. The program sug­
gests the current system date as the Opening Date, but this is probably 
wrong.

202
Part III: Home Finances 
	
5.	Enter the original loan balance.
	
	 Enter the original loan amount into the Original Balance text box. You 
can get this amount, if you’re unsure, from the original loan documents.
	
6.	Enter the loan term in years in the Original Length text box.
	
	 If you set up a 30-year mortgage, for example, type 30. You may have to 
perform one tiny trick when entering this figure: If you set up a loan that 
includes a balloon payment, enter the number of years over which the 
loan will be fully paid — not the number of years used for calculating the 
loan payment. For example, loan payments may be calculated based on 
a 30-year term, but the loan may require a balloon payment at the end of 
7 years. In that case, type 7 in the Original Length text box.
	
7.	Indicate how often the bank calculates loan interest.
	
	 Use the Compounding Period text box to specify how often the bank 
calculates interest on the loan. The interest-compounding period usually 
equals the payment period.
	
8.	Describe how often you make a loan payment by using the Payment 
Period options.
	
	 If you make regular monthly payments, for example, select the Standard 
Period option button, open the Standard Period drop-down list box, and 
choose Monthly. If you can’t find an entry in the Standard Period drop-
down list box that describes how often you make payments, select the 
Other Period option button and then type the number of payments you 
make each year in the Payments Per Year text box.
	
9.	Click Next.
	
	 Quicken displays another set of boxes and buttons on the Summary tab 
(shown in Figure 12-3).
	
Figure 12-3: 
More 
buttons and 
boxes you 
can use to

loan.
	

203
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money
	
10.	(Optional) Describe the balloon payment (if you have one).
	
	 The balloon payment option buttons and boxes let you alert Quicken to 
any balloon payment you must make in addition to the last regular loan 
payment. If the loan doesn’t have a balloon payment, ignore this stuff 
and make sure that the No Balloon Payment option is selected.
	
	 If the loan does have a balloon payment, select the Amortized Length 
option button; then use the Amortized Length text box and drop-down 
list box to specify the number of years or months (or whatever) over 
which the loan is amortized. If you know that you have a loan payment 
(and know the loan payment amount) but don’t know what the amount 
is or when it occurs, select the Calculate option button in the Balloon 
Information area.
	
11.	Enter the Current Balance if you’ve made any payments.
	
	 If you indicated that you’ve already made payments on the loan, specify 
how much you still owe on the loan after making the last payment by 
using the Current Balance text box. If you don’t know the current bal­
ance, call the lender and ask for it. If you haven’t made any payments 
yet, skip to Step 12. You know the drill by now. Just move the cursor to 
the text box and pound a few number keys.
	
12.	Enter the date as of which the current balance is, well, current.
	
	 Use the As Of field to indicate the date for which you’ve entered the cur­
rent balance. All the standard date entry and date-editing tricks apply to 
this text box. You can press the + and – keys, for example, to move the 
date ahead and back by one day. And you can click that icon at the right 
end of the As Of text box to display a pop-up calendar.
	
13.	Specify the interest rate.
	
	 Enter the loan’s interest rate into the Interest Rate text box in the 
Payment section in this window. The loan interest rate, by the way, isn’t 
the same thing as the APR, or annual percentage rate. You want to enter 
the actual interest rate used to calculate your payments. Enter the inter­
est rate as a decimal amount. For example, don’t type 75⁄8; instead, type 
7.625. You should be able to get this rate from the lender or the pro­
spective lender.
	
14.	(Optional) Describe the payment in more detail (if necessary).
	
	 If you’ve entered all the loan information that Quicken has requested in 
the preceding steps, you can just select the Calculate option button in 
the Payment area. Quicken then calculates the loan payment by using 
the loan balance, term, balloon payment information, and interest rate 
you entered. If you haven’t entered all this information — say, you left 
out the balloon payment information because you don’t know what it 
is — select the Payment Amount (P+I) option button and then enter the 
loan principal and interest amount into the Payment Amount (P+I) text 
box. If necessary, edit the next payment date in the Due On drop-down 
list box.

204
Part III: Home Finances 
	
15.	Click Done.
	
	 If you asked Quicken to calculate anything for you, a dialog box pops up, 
telling you that Quicken did so. Click OK. Make sure that the Quicken 
calculations make sense and then click Done again. Quicken displays the 
Set Up Loan Payment dialog box (shown in Figure 12-4).
	
Figure 12-4: 
The Set 
Up Loan 
Payment 
dialog box.
	
	
16.	Verify the principal and interest payment calculated by the program.
	
	 If it’s wrong, you can keep going, but let me point out a minor yet annoy­
ing problem. You probably entered one of the loan calculation inputs 
incorrectly, such as the loan balance, loan term, or the interest rate. 
Fortunately, these errors are only a minor bummer. Later in this chapter 
(in the “Fixing loan stuff” section), I describe how to restart.
	
17.	(Optional) Indicate any amounts you pay besides principal and 
interest.
	
	 Click the Edit button. Quicken displays the Split Transaction dialog box 
(see Figure 12-5), which you can use to describe any additional amounts 
the lender requires you to pay. In the case of a mortgage, for example, 
you may be required to pay property taxes or private mortgage insur­
ance. After you enter the information and click OK, Quicken calculates 
the full payment and redisplays the Set Up Loan Payment dialog box 
(refer to Figure 12-4).
	
18.	Indicate how you make payments in the Type drop-down list box.
	
	 Choose one of the payment transaction types listed in the Type drop-
down list box. Payment means that you handwrite checks; Print Check 
means that you print checks by using Quicken; and Online Pmt means 
that you use Quicken Online Banking to make electronic payments.

205
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money
	
	 If you print checks by using Quicken and want to put the payee’s 
address on the check, click the Address button in the Set Up Loan 
Payment dialog box. Quicken displays a dialog box that you can use to 
input the payee’s address, as shown in Figure 12-6. When you finish pro­
viding name and address information, click OK and go get another cup 
of coffee. When you come back, Quicken will have redisplayed the Set 
Up Loan Payment dialog box.

19.	Type the lender’s name in the Payee text box.
	
	 The payee is just the name of the person or business that loaned you the 
money.
	
20.	(Optional) Type a memo description.
	
	 Does the lender always get mixed up when you send the check? Stick the 
loan account number in the check’s Memo text box. I refrain from using 
this text box to comment on the fairness of the bank’s interest rate, to 
mock the intelligence of the loan payment processors, or to perform 
other emotionally gratifying, but generally unproductive, acts.
	
21.	Type the date of your next loan payment in the Next Payment Date 
text box.
	
22.	Enter the interest category.
	
	 Open the Category For Interest drop-down list and choose the appropri­
ate category.
	
	 Quicken lets you schedule (have Quicken automatically enter) or memo­
rize (just have Quicken remind you to enter) loan payments and elec­
tronic payments. I assume that you don’t want to be doing this kind of 
stuff — at least not yet. If I’m assuming incorrectly, click the Payment 
Method button. Then fill in the dialog box that appears. It’s not all that 
difficult. If you’re still confused, I explain how you can use the Calendar 
to schedule loan payments later in this chapter.
	
23.	With the Set Up Loan Payment dialog box displayed, click OK.
	
	 Quicken removes the Set Up Loan Payment dialog box and asks whether 
any asset is associated with the loan. If you want to associate an asset 
with your loan, Quicken walks you through the steps for setting up an 
asset account. But you know what? Don’t worry about setting up an 
asset account. It actually isn’t worth it. Just click No. Quicken displays a 
new Net Worth tab, or window. You probably want to see the new liabil­
ity you’ve set up in its own register, so click the new account. Quicken 
displays the transaction list register thingy, shown in Figure 12-7.
	
	 By the way, I want to apologize to you for describing a 23-step process. I 
couldn’t do anything about it, but I feel bad anyway.
Fixing loan stuff
Nobody’s perfect, right? You may have made a tiny little mistake in setting up 
either the loan or the loan payment. This mistake doesn’t need to be a major 
financial or personal crisis, however. Just display the loan account’s transac­
tions (such as by clicking the account name in the Accounts bar) and then 
click the Loan Details button. Quicken displays the View Loans dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 12-8.

Hey, can I mention one other thing about the View Loans dialog box? See 
those two tabs labeled Payment Schedule and Payment Graph? You can 
probably guess what they do, but if you click the Payment Schedule tab, an 
amortization schedule shows the interest and principal portions of each loan 
payment. If you click the Payment Graph tab, Quicken displays a line chart 
that shows how you pay off the loan balance over time. You may want to take 
a minute and experiment with these two tabs. They’re pretty neat.

208

Changing loan or loan payment information
If you want to change something about the loan, click the Edit Loan button. 
Quicken displays the Edit Loan dialog box. It works like the Loan Setup dialog 
boxes in Figures 12-1 and 12-2. Make the changes and click OK.
To change something about the payment, click the Edit Payment button. 
Quicken displays the Edit Loan Payment dialog box. Make your changes and 
click OK.
Working with adjustable rate loans
Before I wrap up this discussion, let me mention a few other things. If you 
have a variable rate loan, you can click the Rate Changes button to display 
the Loan Rate Changes dialog box (shown in Figure 12-9). This dialog box has 
a very simple purpose: It lists the interest rates you entered for a loan and 
the dates these interest rates were used in loan calculations.
	
Figure 12-9: 
The Loan 
Rate 
Changes 
dialog box.
	
If you want to record new interest rates — because you have a variable rate 
loan and the interest rate changes, for example — follow these steps in the 
Loan Rate Changes dialog box:
	
1.	Indicate that you want to record a new interest rate.
	
	 Click the New button in the Loan Rate Changes dialog box or right-click 
in the dialog box and choose New on the shortcut menu that appears. 
Quicken displays the Insert An Interest Rate Change dialog box, shown 
in Figure 12-10.
	
2.	Provide the effective date of the interest rate change.
	
	 Use the Effective Date text box to indicate when the new interest rate 
becomes effective. You can either type in a date or open the drop-down 
list box and select a date from the calendar.

209
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money

3.	Give the new interest rate.
	
	 Type the new interest rate in the Interest Rate text box. When you move 
the selection cursor to a new box, Quicken refigures the loan payment 
and sticks the new loan payment figure in the Regular Payment text box.
	
4.	Click OK.
Removing and adding loans
You can delete (remove) and add loans by using the Loan Summary tab in 
the View Loans window (refer to Figure 12-8).
Delete a loan that you no longer need or shouldn’t have added in the first 
place by clicking the Choose Loan (x) button and selecting the loan account. 
Then click the Delete button. Quicken then warns you that you’re about to 
delete your loan and asks you whether you want to save the account for your 
records. Saving the account keeps the account available in your Accounts 
window but eliminates it in your View Loans window. You can hide the saved 
account later if you want it to disappear from your Accounts window. (To do 
so, choose Tools➪Account List, click the account when Quicken displays the 
Account List window, and then check one of the Hide This Account boxes.)
You can add loans in the View Loans window, too (refer to Figure 12-8). To do so, 
click the New button in the View Loans window. Quicken displays the Loan Setup 
dialog box and walks you through the sequence of steps that I describe earlier 
in the “Setting up a liability account for an amortized loan” section to set up the 
loan. For example, you fill in both the Loan Setup dialog box (refer to Figures 12-1 
and 12-2) and the Set Up Loan Payment dialog box (refer to Figure 12-4).
Delivering a Pound of Flesh (Also 
Known as Making a Payment)
After you set up a liability account, you’re ready to hand over a pound of 
your flesh — that is, make a payment. Before you say that this phrase is just 
some sort of populist bull-dweeble, I want to remind you that this metaphor 
comes from Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, in which a loan is guaran­
teed with a pound of human flesh. Ouch.

210
Part III: Home Finances 
Recording the payment
After you set up the loan and the loan payment, you’re ready to record the 
payment in (drumroll, please) the register.
I’m trying to make the old Quicken register more exciting for you because 
you’re probably becoming pretty darn familiar with it. And familiarity, as 
they say, breeds contempt.
Anyway, complete the following steps to record a payment:
	
1.	Display the View Loans window by choosing Net Worth➪Loans.
	
	 If the Net Worth tab doesn’t appear, choose View➪Tabs to Show➪
Net Worth. And if the Net Worth command happens to be disabled, 
don’t freak out. Rather, choose Tools➪Loan Details.
	
2.	Display the loan you want to pay.
	
	To do so, click the Choose Loan (x) button in the top of the dialog box 
and select the loan in the drop-down list.
	
3.	Click the Make Payment button.
	
	 Quicken displays a message box that asks whether the payment you’re 
making is a regular payment (one the lender expects) or an extra pay­
ment (perhaps to amortize the loan more quickly). After you select the 
payment type, Quicken displays either the Make Regular Payment or the 
Make Extra Payment dialog box. Figure 12-11 shows the Make Regular 
Payment dialog box; the Make Extra Payment dialog box looks almost 
exactly the same.
	
Figure 12-11: 
The Make 
Regular 
Payment 
dialog box.
	
	
4.	Describe the loan payment.
	
	 I’m not going to give you the blow-by-blow account here. If you’ve gotten 
this far, you don’t need my help. (Mostly, as you know, you just type 
stuff in boxes.)

211
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken enters the loan payment in the liability register and bank 
account register. You’re done.
Handling mortgage escrow accounts
I should talk about one minor, mortgage record-keeping annoyance — 
mortgage escrow accounts.
If you have a mortgage, you know the basic procedure. Although your mort­
gage payment may be $599.55 per month, your friendly mortgage company 
(while insisting that it trusts you completely) makes you pay an extra $125 
per month for property taxes and other such things. In other words, even 
though you’re paying only $599.55 per month in principal and interest, your 
monthly payment to the mortgage company is, according to this example, 
$724.55 ($599.55 + $125).
The mortgage company, as you probably know, saves this money for you in 
an escrow account or a set of escrow accounts. A couple of times yearly, the 
mortgage company pays your property taxes; and, a time or two per year, it 
pays your homeowner’s insurance. If you have private mortgage insurance, it 
may pay this fee every month as well. And so it goes.
The question, then, is how do you treat this stuff? Like with most things, you 
can take the easy way (which is rough, dirty, and unshaven) or the hard way 
(which is precise, sophisticated, and cumbersome).
You can choose whichever method you want. It’s your life.
The rough, dirty, and unshaven method
Suppose that you do pay an extra $125 per month. You can treat this extra 
$125 as another expense category, such as Tax:Property or Other Housing or 
Property Expenses. (I’m just making up these categories. If you can think of 
better ones, use your own.)
Nice. Easy. No fuss. These words and phrases pop into my head when I think 
about the rough, dirty, and unshaven method of mortgage escrow record 
keeping. Figure 12-12 shows a sample Split Transaction window filled out 
this way. If the Split Transaction window seems like too much fuss, mosey on 
over to Chapter 4, where I give you the rundown on using it.

212
Part III: Home Finances 
	
Figure 12-12: 
A mortgage 
payment 
with an 
escrow 
account 
treated as 
an expense.
	
I use the rough, dirty, and unshaven method. Let me make a confession, 
though. This approach doesn’t tell you how much moolah you have stashed 
away in your escrow accounts. It also doesn’t tell you how much you really 
spend in the way of homeowner’s insurance, what you’re entitled to claim as 
a property tax deduction, or how much they’re bleeding you for private mort­
gage insurance.
To get these figures, you have to peruse the monthly and annual mortgage 
account statements — that is, if you get them. Or you have to call the mort­
gage lender and rattle a cage or two.
Still, with all its shortcomings, I like the easy-to-use, rough, dirty, unshaven 
method.
The precise, sophisticated, and cumbersome approach
You say you can’t live with the uncertainty, the stress, the not knowing? Then 
I have another approach just for you.
You can set up an asset account for each escrow account for which the mort­
gage company collects money.
You set up asset accounts like you set up a checking account. And, in fact, 
you should think of escrow accounts essentially as special checking accounts 
into which your lender deposits money collected from you so that it can pay 
your property taxes and insurance.

213
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money
Because I explain this “setting up a checking account” process in Chapter 1, 
I’ll just cover it quickly. You set up an asset account with its starting balance 
equal to the current escrow account balance. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the Quicken Home page or some other Quicken tab that shows 
the Accounts bar along the left edge of the window.
	
2.	Click the Add Account button to indicate that you want to create a 
new account.
	
3.	As you step through the seemingly interminable account setup pro­
cess, identify the account as an asset account and give it a name.
	
4.	Tell Quicken how much money is in the account as of a specific date.
	
	 If you’ve set up an account or two in your time, this process should take 
you about 40 seconds.
After you set up your asset account and record its current balance, you’re 
ready to cruise. Record payments in the escrow as account transfers when­
ever you record the actual loan payment.
You need to do one other thing. When you set up an escrow account, you 
must record the payments that the bank makes from your escrow account 
to the county assessor (for property taxes) and to the insurance company 
(for things such as homeowner’s and private mortgage insurance). You don’t 
know when these payments are really made, so watch your monthly mort­
gage account statements.
When the mortgage company disburses money from the escrow account to 
pay your first property tax assessment, for example, you need to record a 
decrease equal to the payment for property taxes and then categorize the 
transaction as a property tax expense. This process isn’t tricky in terms of 
mechanics. The account increases after every loan payment and decreases 
after a disbursement.
Basically, the Asset Account register mirrors the Checking Account register. 
The only difference is that the Payment and Deposit fields are labeled Decrease 
in the latter and Increase in the former. To get to this account’s register, click 
its name in the Accounts bar.
This second approach doesn’t seem like all that much work, does it? And if 
you use this approach, you can track escrow balances and escrow spending 
precisely. You can, for example, pull your property tax deduction right from 
Quicken. Jeepers, maybe I should try the sophisticated approach next year.

214
Part III: Home Finances 
Your Principal-Interest Breakdown 
Won’t Be Right
Not to bum you out, but your principal-interest breakdown will often be 
wrong. You may calculate interest expense as $544.55 when your bank calcu­
lates it as $544.56. A few pennies here, a few pennies there, and pretty soon, 
your account balance and interest expense tallies are a few pennies off.
So you can’t change the world
You can try calling the bank, telling whomever you talk to what a bozo he (or 
she) is, and then demanding that someone there correct your balance. (If this 
approach works for you, let me know.)
Or (and this method is really more practical) you can adjust your records to 
agree with the bank’s records. Here’s how:
	
1.	Display the register for the liability.
	
	To get to this account’s register, you just click the account name on the 
Accounts bar.
	
2.	Click the Account Actions button and choose the Update Balance command.
	
	 (Go ahead. Tap your keys very hard if you’re angry that the bank won’t 
adjust its records.) Quicken displays the Update Account Balance dialog 
box, shown in Figure 12-13.
	
Figure 12-13: 
The Update 
Account 
Balance: 
Mortgage 
dialog box.
	
	
3.	Enter the correct account balance (that is, the one that the bank says 
is correct).
	
	 Type the correct figure in the Update Balance To text box. (The amount 
probably comes from the year-end or month-end loan statement.)

215
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money
	
4.	Enter the last day of the month or year for which you’re making the 
adjustment.
	
	 Enter a transaction date in the Adjustment Date text box. (You must use 
a transaction date that sticks the adjustment transaction — which fixes 
the principal-interest split — into the right month or year.)
	
5.	Enter your interest expense category.
	
	 Type the correct category name in the Category For Adjustment text 
box. (To see a list of categories, open the drop-down list box.)
	
6.	Record the adjustment.
	
7.	When the Update Account Balance dialog box correctly describes the 
needed adjustment, click OK.
Think this adjustment business is kooky?
Does the whole adjustment transaction business make sense to you? At 
times, it can seem kind of backward, so let me throw out a quick observation.
	
When you record loan payments, you split the loan payment between the 
interest expense category and a principal account transfer that reduces 
the liability. Here’s what’s tricky: When the liability gets reduced either too 
much or not enough, you must fix the liability balance and the principal-
interest split.
Let me give you an example. Suppose that over the course of a year, you 
record $0.17 too little interest expense — and, therefore, record $0.17 too 
much principal reduction, despite your best efforts to be accurate. You need 
to increase the liability account balance by $0.17 in this case, but you also 
need to increase the interest expense figure by $0.17. By entering the interest 
expense category in the Category For Adjustment field, Quicken does these 
adjustments for you. Pretty cool, huh?
Automatic Payments
Quicken has a couple of nifty features — Scheduled Transactions and the 
Calendar — that can help you with automatic loan payments.
The Calendar and Scheduled Transactions features may be useful in 
other instances as well. For example, a business may use the Scheduled 
Transactions and Calendar features to schedule and plan employee payroll 
checks, tax returns, and deposits. But I think that they’re both most useful in 
the case of a loan. So I talk about them both here.

Scheduling a payment or a reminder
If a payment occurs regularly — the payment might be for a loan or some 
other regular bill, like your cable TV service — you can tell Quicken to 
remind you about the payment, or you can set it up as a scheduled payment. 
When you do so, Quicken either reminds you or automatically records the 
payment for you based on a schedule.
Follow these steps to set up such a reminder or scheduled transaction:
	
1.	Display the Calendar window.
	
	 To display the Quicken Calendar window, you can press Ctrl+K. Or, you 
can click the Banking tab and then click the Calendar button. Either 
way, Quicken displays the Calendar window, shown in Figure 12-14. The 
figure shows a calendar for the current month and, optionally, a list of 
memorized payees. 
	
	 Note: If you can’t see the list of transactions along the right edge in the 
Calendar window, click the Options button and then choose the Show 
Memorized Payees List command from the menu Quicken displays.
	
2.	Display the first month for which you want to schedule the transaction.
	
Figure 12-14: 
The 
Calendar 
window.
	

217
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money
	
	 Using the left-arrow and right-arrow buttons, select the starting month 
for the reminder or scheduled transaction. You can also enter a date 
into the Go To Date box and click the Go button. Quicken displays the 
month you want to schedule a payment for inside the Calendar window.
	
3.	Identify the scheduled transaction and date.
	
	 Select the transaction for which you want to create a schedule. In Figure 
12-14, for example, you may want to schedule the payment to Movies 
Galore to fall on the 16th. To do so, select Movies Galore from the payee 
list by clicking it.
	
	 Then drag Movies Galore to the 16th. When you release the mouse 
button, Quicken displays the Add Transaction Reminder dialog box (see 
Figure 12-15). Quicken marks the Remind Me option button — which 
is correct. But note that you can mark the Enter Now option button to 
have Quicken enter the transaction when you click OK.
	
Figure 12-15: 
The Add 
Transaction 
Reminder 
dialog box.
	
	
4.	Verify that the transaction type is Bill or Payment.
	
	 Click the Bill or Payment option button to indicate you’re scheduling a 
payment or a payment reminder. (Of course, if you were setting up some 
other type of transaction reminder, you might choose something else, 
such as Income or Deposit or Transfer.)

218
Part III: Home Finances 
	
5.	Verify that the Pay To and Amount fields are correct.
	
	 They probably are. But I have kind of a compulsive personality. Because 
I’ve been telling you to check all this other stuff, I thought I’d also sug­
gest that you check these fields.
	
6.	Check the payment scheduling stuff.
	
	 Verify that the Next Due Date text box shows the correct date for the 
first payment. If this is a recurring payment, use the How Often text box 
to specify how frequently Quicken should remind you about this pay­
ment. Finally, if you want to get really crazy, use the option buttons and 
text boxes to more precisely specify when you want to make payments 
or be reminded about payments.
	
7.	Identify how the payment should be made.
	
	 Open the Pay From Account drop-down list box and then select the 
appropriate account. You can also specify the payment method and the 
check delivery method.
	
8.	Categorize, tag, and bag.
	
	 If you’re scheduling a reminder for a transaction you’ve already cor­
rectly recorded once, the Category, Tag, and Memo fields should show 
the correct information. You should still check them, however. You 
don’t want to have Quicken copy some old error you made. Note that 
the Tag field only appears if you’ve enabled the Show Tag Field option 
in the Register section of the Quicken Preferences window.
	
9.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken adds the payee’s transaction to the Calendar.
Note: When you schedule payments, you may implicitly break your budget. 
If you’ve set up a budget and scheduling a payment does “break” the budget, 
Quicken alerts you. Quicken also asks (in the nicest way possible) if you 
want to update your budget. For more information about budgeting, refer to 
Chapter 3.
Another way to schedule transactions
By dragging payees to the Calendar, you add transactions to the register one 
at a time, using previously recorded transactions. However, Quicken also 
allows you to automatically schedule the adding of transactions.
To create these scheduled transactions, you choose Tools➪Manage Bill and 
Income Reminders. Quicken displays the Bill and Income Reminders window 
(see Figure 12-16).

219
 Chapter 12: Other People’s Money
	
Figure 12-16: 
The Bill and 
Income 
Reminders 
window.
	
To create a scheduled transaction, click the Create New button and select 
Scheduled Bill Or Deposit to display the Add Transaction Reminder dialog 
box that you use to describe automatically scheduled transactions (see Figure 
12-17). Note that you can automatically schedule any kind of transaction — 
loan payments, insurance premiums, child support, or whatever. (I’m describ­
ing the automatically scheduled transactions feature here in this chapter, 
though, because loan payments are one of the most common ways to use this 
Quicken feature.)
To schedule a transaction, describe the payee, category, and amount; the 
account to use; the transaction method; and so on. You shouldn’t have any 
trouble figuring out what goes into these boxes. They’re the same boxes you 
use to record a check into the register.
After you describe the transaction, use the Scheduling options to describe 
the payment schedule. The Next Due Date text box, for example, lets you 
describe when the first payment occurs. The How Often options let you tell 
Quicken when you want to be reminded about the payment. The How Often 
and the Options settings let you describe the payment pattern: every month 
on the 13th, the second Friday of every month, and so on (see Figure 12-17). 
You can also use the End On boxes to identify when the payments stop.

220

Checking out the Calendar
The bar along the top of the Calendar (refer to Figure 12-14) provides some 
other tools that you may want to use. I’m not going to spend much time on 
them; you’ll have more fun trying them out yourself than you would reading 
about them. Nevertheless, let me give you a bird’s-eye view:
	
✓	The Add Note button lets you post a note on a calendar day. You use 
this feature to create reminder notes that will also appear in the Alerts 
area of the Cash Flow Center. For example, you may want to post a note 
saying Remember Wedding Anniversary on the big day. After you click 
this button, Quicken displays a dialog box in which you type the mes­
sage. Then you click Save My Butt. The program also marks the calendar 
day with a little yellow square — a miniature stick-on note. Click the 
square to read the message.
	
✓	The Options button displays a menu of commands that let you specify 
which transactions should appear in the Calendar, add an account bal­
ance graph in the Calendar window, and fiddle with the memorized 
transactions list. The transactions shown in that list box along the right 
edge of the Calendar window, by the way, are memorized transactions. 
(Chapter 4 briefly discusses memorized transactions.)

nvestment record keeping is something that more of us need to think 
about. More of us are investing as the population ages and we prepare for 
retirement. And the near meltdown in the financial markets in 2008 means 
that we probably all need to save more.
Fortunately, Quicken provides great tools for managing your investments, 
including your tax-deferred investments. And this chapter talks about those 
tools. But first, I should talk about whether you even need to do this.
Deciding to Use Investment Features
The Quicken investment record-keeping feature lets you do three important 
things:
	
✓	Track your interest and dividend income
	
✓	Track real and potential capital gains and losses
	
✓	Measure an investment’s performance by calculating the annual return 
from an investment

222
Part III: Home Finances 
If you’re a serious investor, these things probably sound worthwhile. But 
before you invest any time learning how Quicken investment record keeping 
works, be sure that you need all this power.
Are your investments tax-deferred?
If your investments are tax-deferred — if, for example, you’re using individual 
retirement accounts (IRAs), Simple-IRAs, Roth accounts, or 401(k)s — you 
don’t really need to track investment income and capital gains and losses. 
Tax-deferred investments have no effect on your personal income taxes in 
the United States. You get a tax deduction for the money you stick into IRAs, 
for example, and anything you take out is taxable. (Or in the case of a Roth 
IRA or Roth 401(k), you don’t get a deduction for amounts you stick into 
the account, but then you also don’t get taxed on amounts taken out of the 
account — which means that you don’t need to closely account for Roth IRA 
investments, at least for tax accounting reasons.)
With tax-deferred investments — like deductible IRAs, 401(k)s, and Simple-
IRAs — you record all that you should need to know via your checking 
account. Checks earmarked for investment are categorized as IRA Deductions, 
for example, and investment account withdrawals deposited into your check­
ing account are categorized as IRA Distributions. In other words, you don’t 
need to set up special accounts for tracking your investments. Your bank 
accounts track everything you need to keep track of.
Note: For purposes of this chapter, 529 plans are also tax-deferred invest­
ments, but a 529 plan works a little differently. In a 529 plan, you save money 
for someone else’s college costs — probably a child or grandchild. You don’t 
get a tax deduction when you put money into the 529 plan, but the invest­
ment earnings are not taxed as they are realized. And later, when the plan 
beneficiary (again, probably your child or grandchild) withdraws money, the 
withdrawals aren’t taxed as long as the money is used for college costs. In a 
sense, a 529 plan works like a Roth account — except the money goes for col­
lege and not for retirement.
Are you a mutual fund fanatic?
I want to make a related point. If you’re a fan of mutual funds, you don’t need 
Quicken to measure the funds’ annual returns. Fund managers provide these 
figures for you in quarterly and annual reports. In fact, part of what you’re 
paying the mutual fund manager for is record keeping and performance 
management.

223
 Chapter 13: Tracking Tax-Deferred Investments
Accordingly, if you’re investing in mutual funds through a tax-deferred 
account, you probably really don’t need to be going to the extra work of figur­
ing out the Quicken investment recording stuff.
Some investors don’t need Quicken
Let me give you an example of someone who doesn’t need to use the Quicken 
program’s investments feature — me. Once upon a time, I bought and sold 
common stocks, fooled around with half a dozen mutual funds, and learned 
firsthand why junk bonds are called junk bonds. (Apparently, junk bonds are 
more risky. And so fluctuate wildly in value.) For more than the last decade, 
and even though my investment account has grown steadily through com­
pound interest and additional savings, I’ve simplified my financial affairs 
considerably.
I don’t invest directly in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds these days; instead, 
I stick money into an IRA. My investments don’t produce taxable dividends 
or interest income, nor do they produce taxable or tax-saving capital gains 
or losses. Money I put into the IRA is tax deductible. And money I ultimately 
take out of the IRA will be taxable.
I’m also sticking with a handful of mutual funds, but I don’t need to calculate 
the annual return — that’s what mutual fund managers do. So I don’t need to 
figure, for example, what my shares of Vanguard Total Stock Market Portfolio 
(my favorite mutual fund) delivered as an annual return when I include both 
the 1 percent dividend and the 8 percent price change.
Because I don’t need to track investment income, or track capital gains and 
losses, or calculate the progress of my investment portfolio, I don’t need 
Quicken investment record keeping for my personal use.
Many investors do want Quicken
Of course, many people — including mutual fund investors using tax-deferred 
investment options like 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and individual retirement 
accounts — do want to track their investments with Quicken in spite of the 
laziness I’m trying to promote. Accordingly, I’m going to describe how to 
track tax-deferred accounts with Quicken.
Furthermore, if you have a taxable portfolio stuffed full of individual stocks 
and bonds, you’re going to want to use Quicken to track your other taxable 
investment accounts anyway. And if you’re going to go to that work, it’s not 
much additional effort to track tax-deferred investments with Quicken, too.

Part III: Home Finances 
How to pick a mutual fund
Would you mind terribly if I took a minute and 
provided a handful of tips about how to pick a 
mutual fund? I guess I’m thinking that maybe, 
just maybe, my observations might be useful to 
you. I am not, after all, trying to earn a commis­
sion by selling you some financial product or 
service, so maybe I can be a bit more objective. 
I’m also rather over-educated (with a couple of 
masters degrees — one in finance and one in 
taxation). And I’ve been a CPA for, jeepers, 25 
years, am a former registered investment advi­
sor but am not trying to sell you investments, 
and, most interestingly, have seen countless 
real-life examples of people’s investing suc­
cesses and mistakes. . . .
Here, then, are my tips:
	 1.	 Carefully watch your investment expenses, 
including both commissions and the mutual 
fund management fees. Why? Despite 
what you may have been told, in my expe­
rience, you almost never get extra invest­
ment returns by paying extra for investment 
advice or financial planning. And note that 
every bit of financial research — the kind 
that finance professors do — supports this 
statement. Usually, you want to pick the 
cheapest mutual fund alternative. Almost 
always, that’s an index fund. And one other 
note: Remember that paying a 2 percent fee 
on investments earning 8 percent means 
you’re giving up 25 percent of your profit to 
the mutual fund or financial advisor. That’s 
like a 25 percent tax!
	 2.	 Use tax-deferred investment accounts like 
401(k)s, 403(b)s, and IRAs for your invest­
ments. Income taxes can be a huge drag 
on your investment returns. And over the 
decades that you’ll be investing, minimiz­
ing your income taxes will add at least 
tens of thousands of dollars and potentially 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to your 
wealth.
	 3.	 To diversify, use an inexpensive index fund, 
one per investment category. For example, 
you can diversify by investing in one index 
fund that invests in the U.S. stock market, 
another index fund that invests in corporate 
bonds, another that invests in real estate 
investment trusts, and so on. Diversification 
reduces your investment risk.
	 4.	 Consider one of the new target retirement 
funds such as those offered by Vanguard, 
T. Rowe Price, or Fidelity. With one of 
these babies, you don’t worry about trying 
to diversify. You don’t worry about asset 
allocation or rebalancing. You don’t worry 
about adjusting your investment mix as you 
get older. You just pick a single fund that’s 
tied to your retirement year. For example, 
if you will retire in 2025, you would buy the 
target retirement that assumes you’ll retire 
in 2025. That’s it. That’s the last investment 
decision you need to make.
	 5.	 For goodness sakes, don’t trade, attempt­
ing to buy low and sell high. Trading rarely 
works. And it’s always expensive. Be a 
long-term investor who buys inexpensive 
mutual funds and holds them for the long 
term.
	 6.	 Invest some time and money in beefing 
up your investment knowledge. You can 
do this by reading pretty much anything 
that Burton Malkiel or John Bogle has 
written. I particularly like and recommend 
Burton Malkiel’s A Random Walk Guide to 
Investing (published by W. W. Norton & 
Company).

 Chapter 13: Tracking Tax-Deferred Investments
Tracking a Tax-Deferred Investment
If you need to track a tax-deferred investment, you need to know how to set 
up a tax-deferred account and then record your investment activities.
If you’ll use Quicken to track any of your investments, you shouldn’t skip this 
section. Understanding how tax-deferred investment works makes tracking 
taxable investments much, much easier for you.
Setting up a tax-deferred 
investment account
Setting up an investment account to track a tax-deferred investment account 
works the same way as setting up any other account:
	
1.	Display the Account List window.
	
	 Choose Tools➪Account List to do this.
	
2.	Click the Add Account button.
	
	 Quicken dutifully displays the first Quicken Account Setup dialog box 
that you use to add a new Quicken account (see Figure 13-1). You’ve 
likely seen this dialog box a million times by now. It just asks you to 
identify the type of account you want to add.
	
Figure 13-1: 
The first 
Quicken 
Account 
Setup 
dialog box.
	

226
Part III: Home Finances 
	
3.	Identify the type of investments in the account.
	
	 You click the Investment/Retirement button to indicate you’re adding an 
investment account. After you click the Investment/Retirement button, 
Quicken displays a second set of option buttons that asks you to be more 
specific and indicate whether you’re setting up a standard brokerage 
account, an IRA or Keogh-type account, a 401(k) or 403(b) account, or a 
529 plan. Click the option button that best describes your investment.
	
	 Just to quickly identify what these different account types actually are, 
a 529 plan is a college savings account that complies with Sec. 529 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k) and 403(b) accounts are retirement 
accounts that comply with Sec. 401(k) and Sec. 403(b) of the Internal 
Revenue Code. The IRA and Keogh account type is for individual retire­
ment accounts (IRA) and Keogh accounts (an old retirement savings 
account option). The standard brokerage account option is the catchall 
account type for investment accounts that aren’t tax-favored retirement or 
college savings accounts. (I talk about this type of account in Chapter 14.)
	
4.	Identify the financial institution.
	
	 After you specify which type of investment account you’re setting up, 
Quicken displays the second Account Setup dialog box, which asks for 
the name of the bank or broker holding your investments. This dialog 
box lets you enter the bank or broker name or part of the name in a text 
box or, alternatively, lets you use buttons to generate a list of banks 
and brokers that begin with, for example, the word bank or the letter L. 
Alternatively, you can click an option button that indicates you don’t 
want to identify your bank or broker.
	
5.	Click Next, name the investment, and then click Next again.
	
	 Quicken displays the third Quicken Account Setup dialog box (shown in 
Figure 13-2). Move the cursor to the Account Name/Nickname text box 
and type a name for the account. If you’re setting up an account to track 
an individual retirement account, you might type IRA. Note that you can 
indicate whether the account holds personal, business, or real estate 
transactions. But the default selection — Personal Transactions — should 
be correct.
	
	 After you click Next, Quicken displays the fourth Quicken Account Setup 
dialog box.
	
6.	Provide the last statement date and then click Next.
	
	 The fourth Quicken Account Setup dialog box (see Figure 13-3) asks for 
the date of the statement you’re using to enter your investment infor­
mation. This date is the starting date, in essence, for your investment 
record keeping with Quicken. Enter the date and then click Next.

Account 
Setup 
dialog box.

The fourth 
Quicken 
Account 
Setup 
dialog box.
	
	
7.	Describe the cash balance or money market balance (if any) associ­
ated with the account and then click Next.
	
	 As you probably already know if you’re investing through a broker, 
some investment accounts have a cash account associated with the 
main investment account. The cash in this account, of course, provides 
the money you use for additional investments. And when you receive 
cash from selling some investment or from some dividend, the money 
goes into this account.

228
Part III: Home Finances 
	
	 To describe this cash account, use the Cash and Money Market text 
boxes to give the opening balances. You can probably guess this, but at 
the risk of being redundant, the information that you provide to set up 
a cash account or money market fund mirrors the information you pro­
vide to set up a regular ol’ checking account.
	
8.	Identify the account owner.
	
	 When prompted by the fifth Quicken Account Setup dialog box, indicate 
who owns the tax-deferred investment account — you or your spouse. 
Click Next to display the sixth Quicken Account Setup dialog box (see 
Figure 13-4).
	
9.	Name the security, provide the ticker symbol, and then click Next.
	
	 This sixth dialog box does two things for you:
 
• First, it collects the investment’s ticker symbol (if available) so 
that you can download share prices several times during the day 
and drive yourself half mad with anxiety (see Figure 13-4). If you 
don’t know the ticker symbol, click the Ticker Symbol Lookup 
button to display a Quicken.com Web page that lets you find the 
ticker symbol.
	
Figure 13-4: 
The sixth 
Quicken 
Account 
Setup 
dialog box.
	
 
• Second, it asks you to name the security held in the investment 
account you’re setting up, using the Security Name box. This 
won’t make sense in some cases — such as when you’re holding 
a single certificate of deposit in an IRA. But in other cases — like 
when you’ve set up an IRA with a mutual fund company and 
you’ve invested in three different mutual funds within the IRA — 
separately identifying the different securities within the account 
will make sense.

229
 Chapter 13: Tracking Tax-Deferred Investments
	
	 After you click Next, Quicken displays the seventh Quicken Account 
Setup dialog box, shown in Figure 13-5.
	
Figure 13-5: 
The seventh 
Quicken 
Account 
Setup 
dialog box.
	
	
10.	Provide a total shares count.
	
	Enter the number of shares you hold of each security you identified in 
Step 9.
	
11.	Click Next.
	
	 Quicken displays a dialog box summarizing the investment that you’ve 
just entered. If something seems amiss, click the Back button to find the 
Quicken Account Setup dialog box where you entered some incorrect bit 
of information. If everything seems okay, click Done. For some types of 
tax-deferred investment accounts, Quicken may also ask for additional 
information. For example, if you set up an IRA account, Quicken asks 
about the type of IRA you’re setting up. And Quicken may ask if you’re 
setting up an account that will hold a single mutual fund. Answer the 
question, if asked, by clicking the Yes or No button as appropriate. Then 
click Done again. This time click harder — like you really mean it.
	
12.	Review the new (partially described) investment.
	
	 To check your work so far, click the Investing tab so that Quicken 
displays the Investing tab, or window. (You can also display this 
window any other time simply by clicking the Investing hyperlink in the 
Accounts bar along the left edge of the Quicken window.) Then, click the 
account’s name in the Investing window. Quicken displays the Holdings 
window for the new investment, as shown in Figure 13-6.

Recording your initial investment
After you set up an investment account and describe the securities in the 
account, you can record an initial purchase of the investments.
Of course, you need to know the original price of those first shares. So dig 
through that kitchen drawer where you stuff bank statements, financial 
records, and those kooky birthday cards from Aunt Enid.
When you find the proper paperwork that shows the number of shares you 
purchased and the price per share, here’s what you do:
	
1.	Open the investment account, if it isn’t already open.
	
	 Display the Investing tab, or window; then open the investment account 
by clicking the account name in the Accounts bar. 

231
 Chapter 13: Tracking Tax-Deferred Investments
	
If the Investing tab isn’t shown, chose View➪Show Tabs➪Investing.
	
2.	Tell Quicken you want to enter cost basis data.
	
	 Click the Enter Cost hyperlink in the Cost Basis column. If the Cost Basis 
column doesn’t show the Enter Cost hyperlink, click the plus (+) symbol 
next to the Security Name you choose for the mutual fund. After you 
click the hyperlink, Quicken displays the Enter Missing Transactions 
dialog box, shown in Figure 13-7.
	
Figure 13-7:

actions

3.	Click the Enter Missing Transaction button.
	
	 Quicken displays the Buy - Shares Bought dialog box, shown in Figure 13-8.
	
4.	In the Transaction Date text box, enter the date you first purchased 
the fund shares.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Transaction Date text box and enter the date by 
using the MM/DD/YYYY format. Note: You don’t have to enter a two-
digit month or day number if a single digit makes sense. Enter July 18, 
1989, for example, as 7/18/89. You may also select the date from the 
pop-up calendar.

5.	(Optional) Enter a memo description.
	
	 If you want to tie the purchase to a confirmation order number, for 
example, enter the data in the Memo text box. I suppose that you could 
use this text box to record anything: Kilroy was here. Save the Whales. 
Don’t tread on me.
	
6.	Indicate the size of your purchase.
	
	 To enter the total number of shares, move the cursor to the Number Of 
Shares text box. (Fractional shares are okay.)
	
7.	Indicate what you paid per share.
	
	 With the cursor in the Price Paid text box, enter the amount you paid for 
the lot. After you supply Quicken with the adjusted cost basis, it calcu­
lates the total cost.
	
8.	Record the initial purchase of mutual fund shares by clicking the 
Enter/Done button.
	
	 Quicken redisplays the Enter Missing Transactions dialog box (refer to 
Figure 13-7).
	
9.	(Optional) Repeat Steps 2–8, if necessary.
	
	 You need to repeat Steps 2–8 to record any other lots you purchased. 
For example, if you own 10,000 shares of Vanguard Total Stock Market 
Index, but you accumulated these shares by buying shares six different 
times over the last 15 years, you need to record six separate lots. The 
last time through the steps, if you’re setting up a tax-deferred invest­
ment account that you didn’t really need to set up, you can ask yourself 
why you didn’t listen to me when I said you don’t need and therefore 
don’t want to do this for tax-deferred investments.

233
 Chapter 13: Tracking Tax-Deferred Investments
After you describe each lot that makes up your holdings of the mutual fund 
investment, the Enter Missing Transactions dialog box shows that there 
aren’t any placeholders for missing transactions because the Shares place­
holder and the Cost placeholder should both equal zero (see Figure 13-9). 
You can click Done.

If you make a mistake entering a transaction, you can click the Edit or Delete 
button to the right of the transaction to change or remove the erroneous data.
Buying investments
As you buy additional investments — by contributing additional amounts to 
your retirement account or by reinvesting dividends and capital gain distri­
butions — you record the transactions for the investment account.
By writing a check
If you buy shares by writing a check, display the investment window (by 
clicking the Investing tab and then the investment account), and then record 
the purchase by following these steps:
	
1.	Click the Enter Transactions button.
	
	 Quicken displays the dialog box used to enter investment transactions.
	
2.	Select Buy - Shares Bought in the Enter Transaction drop-down 
list box.
	
	 Quicken displays the Buy - Shares Bought version of the investment 
transaction entry dialog box, shown in Figure 13-10.

3.	Enter the purchase date in the Transaction Date text box.
	
4.	(Optional) Enter a description in the Memo text box.
	
5.	Enter the bank account on which you’ll write the check that pays for 
the shares.
	
	 Select the account name in the From drop-down list box.
	
6.	Indicate the size of your purchase by using the Number Of Shares and 
the Price Paid text boxes.
	
	 Tell Quicken the size of your investment by giving the number of shares 
purchased and the price paid per share.
	
7.	Enter the commission or fee that you paid.
	
	 Move the cursor to the Commission text box and enter the commission 
or fee you paid to purchase the shares. (The amount shown in the Total 
Cost text box includes this figure.)
	
8.	Record the purchase.
	
	 Click the Enter/New button if you want to record the transaction and 
enter another new transaction, or click the Enter/Done button if you 
want to record just the single transaction. Quicken records your pur­
chase of new shares. You are now a capitalist. Congratulations.
By reinvesting dividends, interest, or capital gains
When you reinvest your dividends, interest, or capital gains, you also must 
record your reinvestment transactions. Essentially, you’re buying new 
shares using the dividend or capital gain proceeds you could have received. 
To record the reinvestment of investment profits, display the investment 
window (by clicking the Investing tab and then clicking the investment 
account), and then follow these steps:

235
 Chapter 13: Tracking Tax-Deferred Investments
	
1.	Click the Enter Transactions button.
	
	 Quicken displays the dialog box used to enter investments transactions.
	
2.	Select Reinvest - Income Reinvested in the Enter Transaction drop-
down list box.
	
	 Quicken displays the Reinvest - Income Reinvested version of the invest­
ment transaction entry dialog box, shown in Figure 13-11.
	
Figure 13-11: 
 The 
Reinvest -

3.	Enter the purchase date (in this case, the reinvestment date) in the 
Transaction Date text box.
	
4.	(Optional) Type a brief explanation of the transaction in the Memo 
text box.
	
5.	Use the Amount and Shares columns to describe the reinvestment.
	
	 Take another look at Figure 13-11. No, really, go ahead. I’ll wait. See those 
rows labeled Dividend, Interest, Short-Term Cap Gain Dist, Mid-Term Cap 
Gain Dist, and Long-Term Cap Gain Dist? And see the columns labeled 
Amount and Shares? Use these rows and columns to record the amounts 
of dividends, interest, and capital gains distributed to you by the mutual 
fund and to record the numbers of shares you purchase by reinvesting 
these amounts. For example, if you receive $100 of dividends and use this 
amount to purchase two shares, you enter 100 in the Dividend Amount 
box and 2 in the Dividend Shares text boxes, respectively.
	
6.	Record the reinvestment transaction.
	
	 Click the Enter/New button if you want to record the transaction and 
enter another new transaction, or click the Enter/Done button if you 
want to record just the single transaction.

236
Part III: Home Finances 
Figure 13-11 shows $450 of dividends being reinvested in the mutual fund by 
buying 5 more shares and $4500 of long-term capital gains being reinvested 
by buying 50 shares.
Recording your profits
Perhaps regularly, you’ll receive distributions directly from the investment 
account’s investments that you don’t immediately reinvest. Instead, you’ll 
deposit these proceeds into the investment accounts’ cash account or money 
market account.
To record these kinds of distributions, you follow a process very similar 
to those I describe in the preceding set of steps. For example, to record an 
income transaction directly into the investment account, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Enter Transactions button.
	
	 Display the investment window — by clicking the Investing button and 
then clicking the Enter Transactions button. Quicken displays the dialog 
box used to enter investment transactions.
	
2.	Select Inc - Income (Div, Int, Etc.) in the Enter Transaction drop-down 
list box.
	
	 Quicken displays the Inc - Income (Div, Int, Etc.) version of the invest­
ment transaction entry dialog box. The Inc – Income (Div, Int, Etc.) ver­
sion of the investment transaction entry dialog box closely resembles 
the Reinvest - Income Reinvested dialog box, so I won’t show it here.
	
3.	Enter the distribution date in the Transaction Date text box.
	
4.	Use the Transfer Account drop-down list to identify the account into 
which you’ll deposit the check that the mutual fund company sends you.
	
5.	(Optional) Type a brief description of the distribution in the Memo 
text box.
	
	 Be creative — type your wedding anniversary, the name of your dog, or 
even a piece of data related to the dividend or distribution.
	
6.	Indicate the dividend or capital gains distribution amount.
	
	 Enter the amount in the appropriate amount text box. A dividend, I hope 
you can guess, goes into the Dividend box. A short-term capital gain 
goes into the Short-Term Cap Gain Dist box, and so on.
	
7.	Record the dividend or distribution transaction.
	
	 When you click either the Enter/New or the Enter/Done button, you 
record the dividend. If you click the Enter/New button, Quicken leaves 
the dialog box open so that you can enter some other transactions.

Selling investments
Selling mutual fund shares works basically the same way as buying them — 
only in reverse. To record the sale of shares held in an investment account, 
perform the following actions:
	
1.	Click the Enter Transactions button.
	
	 Display the investment window by clicking the Investing Center button 
and then clicking the Enter Transactions button. Quicken displays the 
dialog box used to enter investment transactions.
	
2.	Select Sell - Shares Sold in the Enter Transaction drop-down list box.
	
	 Quicken displays the Sell - Shares Sold version of the investment trans­
action entry dialog box, shown in Figure 13-12.
	
Figure 13-12: 
The Sell - 
Shares Sold 
dialog box.
	
	
3.	Enter the sale’s date in the Transaction Date text box.
	
4.	(Optional) Type a brief description of the sale in the Memo text box.
	
5.	If you’re selling all your shares, click in the Sell All Shares In This 
Account check box.
	
6.	Give Quicken the number of shares you’re selling.
	
	 Use the Number Of Shares box to specify the number of shares you’re 
selling (if you didn’t click in the Sell All Shares check box in Step 5).
	
7.	Indicate the price per share that you received by using the Price 
Received text box.
	
	 With a little luck, your selling price is more than you paid.

238
Part III: Home Finances 
	
8.	Enter the commission or fee you paid to sell the shares in the 
Commission text box.
	
	 No wonder Bernie, your broker, does so well, huh? He makes money 
even if you don’t.
	
	 Quicken calculates whatever you don’t enter. For example, if you tell 
Quicken how many dollars you sell (by using the Price Received text 
box), it calculates the number of shares you sell by dividing the total 
sales amount by the price per share. If you tell Quicken how many 
shares you sell (using the Number Of Shares text box), it calculates the 
total sales amount by multiplying the number of shares by the price per 
share. I guess this feature is handy.
	
9.	Enter the bank account into which you’re going to deposit the sale’s 
proceeds.
	
	 Open the To drop-down list box and select the appropriate account. 
(Probably, you’ll deposit the proceeds into the associated cash 
account.)
	
10.	Click one of the Enter buttons.
	
	 Quicken records your sale.
Correcting a mistake
If you make a mistake, don’t worry — it’s not a problem. You can edit an 
investment transaction. To edit a particular transaction, you first need to 
display the investment transactions list. Start by clicking the investment 
account you want to work with, clicking the Investing Reports button, and 
then choosing the Investment Transactions command. Quicken displays the 
Investment Transactions list (see Figure 13-13).
To edit one of the transactions you see listed for the investment account, 
double-click the transaction. Quicken opens the dialog box you originally 
used to record the transaction (such as the one shown in Figure 13-14), and 
you use it to make your changes.
	
If you don’t see the transaction listed, use the Date Range box to specify that 
you want to see all transactions for the account.

Part III: Home Finances 
Working with slightly tricky 
investment transactions
I haven’t described every possible investment transaction that you’re likely 
to encounter in a typical tax-deferred investment account — although I have 
described every one I’ve encountered in the past 10 or 12 years. You should 
know, however, that Quicken does let you record three additional, common-
to-tax-deferred-investment-account transactions by specifying several almost 
magical actions: shares out, stock split, and reminder transactions.
How do I remove shares from an account?
You can tell Quicken to remove shares from an account — without moving 
the money represented by the shares — to some other account. Why would 
you want to remove shares from an account using a shares-removed transac­
tion? I can think of two situations:
	
✓	You erroneously added shares to the account with the shares added 
transaction action and now you need to remove them.
	
✓	You’re using an investment account to record old investment activity, 
such as activity from last year.
The first instance is self-explanatory because you’re simply correcting an 
error that you made. In the second case, however, you don’t want to transfer 
the proceeds of an investment sale to a cash account because the money 
from the sale was already recorded as a deposit at some point in the past.
You can record a shares-removed transaction directly into Quicken by click­
ing the Enter Transaction button and choosing Remove - Shares Removed in 
the Enter Transaction drop-down list box. Then fill in the rest of the fields in 
the dialog box the same way that you would for a regular ol’ sell transaction. 
The only difference is that you won’t give a transfer account for the sale 
proceeds — because there aren’t any proceeds.
What? The stock split and then doubled?
Stock splits don’t occur very often; however, when they do occur, the com­
pany issuing the shares, in effect, gives you a certain number of new shares 
(such as two) for each old share you own.
To record a stock split, you click the Enter Transactions button and select 
Stock Split in the Enter Transaction drop-down list box. When Quicken dis­
plays the Stock Split version of the dialog box used to enter investment trans­
actions (see Figure 13-15), you indicate the ratio of new shares to old shares. 
For a two-for-one split, for example, you indicate that you get two new split 
shares for each old unsplit share. The whole process is pretty easy.

Split ver-
sion of the

Quicken, will you remind me of something?
A reminder transaction is the electronic equivalent of a yellow stick-on note. 
If you put a reminder transaction in an investment account, Quicken gives 
you a reminder message on the reminder date. You can’t goof up anything by 
trying out reminders, so if you’re curious, enter a reminder transaction for 
tomorrow and see what happens.
You can post a reminder note by clicking the Enter Transactions button, 
selecting Reminder Transaction in the Enter Transaction drop-down list box, 
and filling in the dialog box that Quicken displays (see Figure 13-16).

dialog box.
	

242
Part III: Home Finances 
You might want to use reminder transactions to record due dates for con­
tributions to retirement accounts or for required minimum distributions 
amounts or dates.
Reconciling an account
You reconcile a tax-deferred investment account the same basic way that 
you reconcile a bank account. The only real difference — and it doesn’t affect 
reconciliation mechanics — is that you focus on investment shares and not 
on account balance dollars. To begin reconciling a tax-deferred investment 
account, display the Investing tab, click the Investing Actions button, and 
choose the Investing Activities➪Reconcile An Account. If you have questions 
about what to do next, refer to Chapter 8. It describes how you reconcile a 
bank account, but the same procedures apply to both tax-deferred and regu­
lar investment account.
Trying reports
	
I just want to say one thing about Quicken reports as they relate to your 
investments — both tax-deferred investments and taxable investments: 
Remember that the reports are available. (For more information, see Chapter 7.)
Using menu commands and other stuff
For the most part, the commands and menus available for an investment 
account (no matter whether you’re talking tax-deferred or taxable) are the 
same as those available for all the other accounts Quicken supplies. I write 
about the commands that I think are most helpful to new users in the pre­
ceding chapters of this book. If you have a question about how the Void 
Transaction(s) command works, for example, refer to the index, which 
directs you to a specific discussion of that command.
Updating Securities Prices
You can collect current market prices and store this information with your 
accounts (both tax-deferred and taxable). Just display the Investing tab, click 
the View button, and choose the Portfolio command. Quicken displays the 
Portfolio tab (see Figure 13-17).

243
 Chapter 13: Tracking Tax-Deferred Investments
	
Figure 13-17: 
The Portfolio 
view of the 
Investing 
tab, or 
window.
	
To record the current market price for a security, use the arrow keys or click 
the mouse to select the security. Then move the cursor to the Quote/Price 
text box and enter the current price.
Quicken updates the Market Value field in the Portfolio tab as well as the 
Market Value figure at the bottom of the register window. After you update 
the market price, you can return to the investment account window register 
by clicking the investment account name on the Portfolio tab.
If you invest exclusively in tax-deferred investments, the information in this 
chapter should be all you need. If you also invest more actively using taxable 
accounts, you may want to turn to Chapter 14. It describes how you use a 
Quicken investment account to track a typical brokerage account.

244
Part III: Home Finances 
The Portfolio tab
You can do more with the Portfolio tab (refer 
to Figure 13-17) than just update share prices.
The As Of field lets you specify the date on 
which you want to see and set market prices 
and values. The Show drop-down list box lets 
you customize how Quicken reports on your 
investment holdings. The Customize View 
button displays a dialog box that lets you 
add all sorts of information to the Portfolio 
view — information that can give you all sorts 
of insights into how you’re doing with your 
investing.
I’m not going to go into more detail here about 
what all these extra bells and whistles do, how­
ever. If you’re interested in this stuff, just take 
the time to explore these commands. You will 
gain some interesting insights into your finan­
cial investments.

A
fter you understand how Quicken handles tax-deferred investments, 
working with a regular taxable brokerage account (and the extra com­
plexity that such an account typically includes) is a snap.
	
If you haven’t yet used Quicken for tax-deferred investment record keeping or 
read Chapter 13, I recommend you at least skim Chapter 13. That chapter pro­
vides some useful information about the fundamentals of investment record 
keeping with Quicken.
Setting Up a Brokerage Account
Setting up a brokerage account is similar to setting up a regular tax-deferred 
account. Because I describe this process in painstaking detail in Chapter 13, I 
don’t repeat the discussion here.
The one bit of information that I will note is this: During the investment 
account setup process, when Quicken asks you what kind of account you’re 
setting up, specify that you’re setting up a standard brokerage account.

246
Part III: Home Finances 
Recording your initial share balances
If you’ve already read or skimmed Chapter 13 (which talks about using 
Quicken to track tax-deferred investments), you may remember a section 
titled, “Recording your initial investment.” That little section explains how to 
tell Quicken what you paid for the mutual fund shares, stock shares, and so 
forth, held in your tax-deferred investment account.
Okay. So here’s the deal. Just as you need to describe your starting share 
balances when you set up a tax-deferred investment account, you need to 
describe your starting share balances when you set up a standard brokerage 
investment account. In other words, if you own three stocks in your broker­
age account — IBM, GE, and Boeing — you need to describe how much you 
paid and when you purchased your IBM, GE, and Boeing shares.
	
Rather than copy that earlier discussion (I’d literally be copying and pasting 
material from Chapter 13), let me refer you to the “Recording your initial 
investment” section in Chapter 13. Go through the nine-step process 
described there for each stock you hold.
Working with brokerage accounts
Brokerage accounts work like tax-deferred accounts, which I describe in 
Chapter 13, except for a handful of minor differences.
Essentially, only three general differences exist between tax-deferred invest­
ment accounts and brokerage investment accounts:
	
✓	Brokerage accounts typically use more extensive security lists (whereas 
tax-deferred investment accounts don’t).
	
✓	Brokerage accounts have cash accounts (whereas tax-deferred invest­
ments usually don’t).
	
✓	Brokerage accounts let you record a handful of goofy transactions that 
tax-deferred investment accounts don’t (because they don’t make sense 
in the context of conventional tax-deferred investments).
I spend the next few paragraphs of this chapter describing features that are 
unique to brokerage accounts.

247
 Chapter 14: Stocks and Bonds
Setting up security lists
Typically, a brokerage account probably contains more than one type of secu­
rity. You may have shares of Boeing, General Motors, or Google. You name it, 
and someone owns it.
Therefore, a brokerage account uses a list of securities — and you, as the 
investor, need to create and maintain the list of securities (stocks, bonds, 
and so on) that your account holds.
To do so, set up the brokerage account (as described in the first part of this 
chapter) and then complete the following steps:
	
1.	Choose the Security List command.
	
	 Display the Investing tab, click the Investing Lists button, and choose 
the Security List command. Quicken displays the Security List window, 
shown in Figure 14-1. Note that any mutual funds you’ve already set up 
appear in the list as securities. 
	
2.	Click the New button in the Security List window.
	
	 Quicken displays the first Add Security To Quicken dialog box, shown in 
Figure 14-2.
	
Figure 14-1: 
The Security 
List window.
	

248
Part III: Home Finances 
	
3.	Enter the stock symbol for the security in the Ticker Symbol text box.
	
	 If you don’t know the symbol, make sure that you have the name of the 
security correct and then click the Look Up button to search for the 
ticker symbol at Quicken.com. 
	
4.	Click Next to continue.
	
	 Quicken retrieves information about the stock whose ticker symbol you 
entered and displays it in another Add Security To Quicken dialog box.
	
Figure 14-2: 
The first Add 
Security To 
Quicken 
dialog box.
	
	
5.	Click Done.
	
	 Quicken adds the security to the security list and redisplays the Security 
List window. If you have additional securities, you can add them by 
repeating Steps 2–4. Also, you can add securities on the fly while you’re 
recording the purchase of a security for the first time. When you do this, 
Quicken starts this little “Oh, let’s add another security to the list” pro­
cess for you at Step 3.
	
Before I quit this discussion of the security list, let me just make a couple of 
observations for your benefit. See those buttons at the top of the Security List 
window? (Go ahead and flip back to Figure 14-1.) You can use them to do 
useful stuff. For example, click Edit to change security information. Click 
Delete, predictably, to remove a security from the list. Use Hide to hide the 
selected security, Choose Market Indexes to select which security indices you 
want Quicken to report, Report to display the security report window, Print to 
print the list, and Options to view or “un-view” (is that a real word?) previ­
ously hidden securities. Just thought you’d want to know.

249
 Chapter 14: Stocks and Bonds
Working with cash
One of the big differences between a brokerage account and a traditional tax-
deferred investment account is that a cash management, or money market, 
account is always, always attached to the brokerage account — and is 
actively used.
When you initially set up a brokerage account, your money goes into this 
account. (The broker bought you a doughnut and coffee in this meeting, 
remember?)
You purchase your first shares with the cash from this account. And when 
you sell shares, all cash proceeds go into this account.
Transferring cash to and from an account
Because you work with cash in a brokerage account, you need to know how 
to record the cash that flows into and out of the account.
To transfer cash to an account, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the investment account’s window.
	
	 You can do this in more than one way, as luck would have it, but one 
easy way is to click the investment account on the Accounts bar. The 
investment account window should look something like the one shown 
in Figure 14-3. (If you’re lucky.)
	
2.	Indicate that you’re transferring money.
	
	 Click the Enter Transactions button. Quicken displays the dialog box 
shown in Figure 14-4. Choose Cash Transferred Into Account in the Enter 
Transaction drop-down list box.
	
3.	Record the transaction date, amount, and account.
	
	 To record the amount of a cash transfer, confirm the transaction date 
(shown in the Transaction Date text box), enter the dollar amount in the 
Amount To Transfer text box, and then specify the checking account 
supplying the cash in the Transfer Account drop-down list box. Then 
click the Enter/New or the Enter/Done button. (If you click Enter/New, 
Quicken records the transaction but leaves the dialog box open so that 
you can record some more transactions.)

	 Click the Enter Transactions button. Quicken displays the dialog box 
shown in Figure 14-5. Choose Cash Transferred Out Of Account in the 
Enter Transaction drop-down list box.
	
3.	Record the transaction date, amount, and account.
	
	 To record the amount of a cash transfer, again confirm the transaction 
date (using the Transaction Date text box), enter the dollar amount in 
the Amount To Transfer text box, and specify the checking account 
receiving the cash in the Transfer Account drop-down list box. Then 
click either the Enter/New or the Enter/Done button.
Mutual (fund) acquaintance
I don’t want to get into the subject of load mutual 
funds versus no-load mutual funds — you pay 
a commission to buy load funds, and you don’t 
pay a commission to buy no-load funds — but 
if you’re interested in how these two types of 
funds work, flip open the Wall Street Journal 
and look for advertisements from no-load fund 
managers such as Vanguard, Scudder, and T. 
Rowe Price. Give them a call, and they’ll tell 
you why they think that you should bypass the 
middleman — your broker. Next, talk to a broker, 
who will tell you why you shouldn’t bypass the 
middleman. Then you make the decision.
What? You want my opinion? With much trepi­
dation, I’ll tell you: I always use no-load mutual 
funds because I’m a big fan of the do-it-yourself 
approach. You save substantial amounts both in 
commissions and, typically, in annual mainte­
nance fees. Quite honestly, if you can figure out 
how to use Quicken and are reading a chapter 
like this, you have enough smarts to choose 
your own mutual funds (especially if you’re will­
ing to do a bit of research through reading). Try 
Andrew Tobias’s classic, The Only Investment 
Guide You’ll Ever Need (Harvest Books) or 
Burton Malkiel’s A Random Walk Guide to 
Investing (W.W. Norton & Company). However, 
I also think that a good broker — good is the 
operative word here — is well worth the com­
mission fee if he or she helps you avoid expen­
sive mistakes. It is not, however, necessarily 
easy to find a good broker or financial planner.

Buying near and selling dear
Buying and selling securities in a brokerage account is very similar to buying 
and selling shares of a tax-deferred investment. You fill in the same fields in 
almost the exact same way.
	
1.	Display the investment account window.
	
2.	Click the Enter Transactions button. When Quicken displays the 
dialog box, choose Buy - Shares Bought in the Enter Transaction drop-
down list box.
	
	Quicken, ever responsive to your needs, displays the Buy - Shares 
Bought dialog box (shown in Figure 14-6). When Quicken displays this 
dialog box, provide the transaction date. Select the security in the 
Security Name drop-down list box. Use the Number Of Shares, Price 
Paid, and Commission text boxes to describe your purchase. (You can 
get this information from your order confirmation slip.)
	
3.	Indicate whether Quicken should adjust a cash account.
	
	 Use the From This Account’s Cash Balance or the From option button 
to specify which cash account Quicken should adjust for the transac­
tion. You can say the usual cash account (by selecting the From This 
Account’s Cash Balance option button) or specify some different 
account (by clicking the From option button and then choosing 
the account in the From drop-down list box).
	
4.	Click the Enter/New or the Enter/Done button when you’re finished.
	
	 Pretty simple, right?

dialog box.
	
Selling a security works in the same basic way as buying a security:
	
1.	Display the investment account window and then click the Enter 
Transactions button.
	
2.	When Quicken displays the dialog box, choose Sell - Shares Sold in 
the Enter Transaction drop-down list box.
	
	 Quicken displays the Sell - Shares Sold dialog box (shown in Figure 14-7). 
Use the Transaction Date box to provide the sales date. Use the Security 
Name drop-down list box to identify the stock, bond, or mutual fund 
you’re selling. You use the Number Of Shares, Price Received, and 
Commission text boxes to describe your sale, and you use the To This 
Account’s Cash Balance or the To option button to specify whether 
Quicken should adjust some bank account balance for this transaction.
	
3.	Click the Specify Lots button.
	
	 If you purchased share lots at different prices or at different times, 
you can click the Specify Lots button to open the Specify Lots For 
Investment dialog box. Here, you can pick and choose which lots to sell 
so that you can minimize the capital gains taxes you’ll owe. (Good idea, 
huh?) A lot is simply a batch, or set, of shares that you purchase at one 
time. If you sell the most expensive lots, you reduce your capital gains 
and the taxes on those gains.
 
• To pick an entire lot: Double-click it. (You need to double-click the 
date field, by the way.)
 
• To pick a portion of a lot: Select it, then, in the Selected text box, 
type the number of shares from the lot you want to sell.
 
• To clear your selections and start over: Click the Reset button.

254
Part III: Home Finances 
	
Figure 14-7: 
The Sell - 
Shares Sold 
dialog box.
	
	
	 The Specify Lots For Investment dialog box also provides nifty command 
buttons for automating the process of selecting lots. If you click the 
Maximum Gain or the Minimum Gain button, Quicken picks lots for you in 
a way that produces the largest possible or smallest possible capital gain, 
respectively. Alternatively, you can click the First Shares In or the Last 
Shares In buttons to sell either the oldest shares or newest shares first, 
respectively. This business about picking the lots you sell is rather arbi­
trary, of course. By letting Quicken pick lots, you can manipulate the capi­
tal gain you’ll have and the capital gains taxes you’ll pay. But it’s all legal 
(as long as you specifically tell the brokerage company which lots you’re 
selling). And honorable. And it can save you money because you can time 
your capital gains so that they occur when they’ll cost you the least.
	
	 If you’re someone who has large capital loss carryforwards — as many 
investors do after the brutal years of this decade — your capital loss 
carryforwards may totally wipe out any gains you have to recognize 
over the next few years (or decades, gulp). In this case, you may not get 
much benefit from fooling around with this specific identification busi­
ness. Consult your tax advisor for details. 
	
4.	Click the Enter/New or the Enter/Done button.
Recording dividends, capital gains, and other goodies
Taking care of this stuff is easy. Any time you receive investment income, 
click the Enter Transactions button and choose Inc – Income (Div, Int, Etc.) in 
the Enter Transaction drop-down list box. When Quicken displays the dialog 
box used to record income, use the Security Name drop-down list box to 
confirm the stock, bond, or mutual fund producing income, and then use the 
Dividend, Interest, Short-Term Cap Gain Dist, Mid-Term Cap Gain Dist, Long-
Term Cap Gain Dist, and Miscellaneous text boxes to record the amount and 
type of income, as shown in Figure 14-8.

255
 Chapter 14: Stocks and Bonds
	
Figure 14-8: 
The dialog 
box used 
to record 
income.
	
Note: You use the Transfer Account drop-down list box to identify the 
account into which income amounts are deposited when you don’t use the 
investment account’s regular cash account.
	
To record dividends, capital gains, and other income when you reinvest the 
money you receive, click the Enter Transactions button and choose Income 
Reinvested in the Enter Transaction drop-down list box. When Quicken displays 
the dialog box, describe the amounts received and how you’ve reinvested.
Recording other not-so-tricky transactions
Quicken lets you record all sorts of transactions in a brokerage account. 
Not only can you do reminder and stock split actions (which I describe in 
Chapter 13), but you can also do a bunch of other things.
I briefly describe these other transactions here and explain how to record 
them because you’re more likely to encounter them when you’re working 
with a standard brokerage account.
Bonds . . . James Bonds . . .
If you invest in bonds, you know that a bond’s price is actually quoted as a 
percentage of its face value. A bond that sells for $950 with a face value of 
$1,000, for example, is quoted as 95 because the $950 price is 95 percent of 
the $1,000 face value. Quicken, however, doesn’t let you describe a bond’s 
price as a percent. You must enter the bond price as its price in dollars 
and cents.

256
Part III: Home Finances 
Going for the gold
You can use Quicken to record precious metal investments. Suppose, for 
example, that you’re hoarding Krugerrands (1-ounce gold coins minted in 
South Africa). For this investment, the price is the price per Krugerrand, and 
the shares figure is actually the number of ounces (equal to the number of 
Krugerrands). Because Quicken doesn’t supply price-per-ounce or number-of-
ounces fields, you insert the information in the Price and Shares fields on the 
Investment list.
Recording margin interest expenses
To record margin interest expense, click the Enter Transactions button and 
select Margin Interest Expense in the Enter Transaction drop-down list box. 
When you do, Quicken displays the margin interest expense version of the 
investment transaction entry dialog box, which you use to describe the cost of 
your financial adventure. Only the most sophisticated investors should be using 
margin interest expense, anyway. If you’re one of these financial cowboys or 
cowgirls, I assume that you’re smart enough to figure out this stuff on your own.
Paying a miscellaneous expense
Sometimes you need to pay an expense. One rarely sees these occur for stock 
or bond investments. Expenses sometimes do arise with real estate partner­
ship interests (which can be treated like common stock shares) or precious 
metal investments (which can also be treated like common stock shares).
If you need to pay a fee for account handling or for storing your stash of 
South African Krugerrands, for example, you can record such an expense 
by clicking the Enter Transactions button and then choosing Miscellaneous 
Expense in the Enter Transactions drop-down list box. When Quicken dis­
plays the dialog box, fill out the boxes in the miscellaneous expense version 
of the investment transaction entry dialog box.
Recording a return of capital
The old return of capital trick. Sometimes, the money you receive because 
you own a security isn’t really income. Rather, it’s a refund of part of the pur­
chase price.
Consider this example: You buy a mortgage-backed security — such as a 
Ginnie Mae bond — for which the mortgagee (the person who borrowed the 
mortgage money) pays not only periodic interest but also a portion of the 
mortgage principal.
Obviously, you shouldn’t record the principal portion of the payment you 
receive as income. You must record this payment as a mortgage principal 
reduction or — in the parlance of investment record keeping — as a return 
of capital.

257
 Chapter 14: Stocks and Bonds
As another example, suppose that you invest in a limited partnership or real 
estate investment trust that begins liquidating. Some of the money that the 
investors receive in this case is really a return of their original investment, or 
a return of capital.
To record a return of capital action, click the Enter Transactions button. 
When Quicken displays the return of capital version of the investment trans­
action entry dialog box, choose Return Of Capital in the Enter Transaction 
drop-down list box and describe the security that’s returning capital.
Special investment transactions
Quicken also supplies some other investment transaction types. Quicken 
provides special investment transactions to record the receipt of stock 
options, exercise of stock options, and repricing of stock options. Quicken 
also supplies investment transaction types for short selling and investment 
transactions for dealing with corporate mergers, spinoffs, and reorganiza­
tions. To use these other special investment transactions, you follow the 
same general approach described in the preceding sections.
More Quick Stuff about 
Brokerage Accounts
Let me tell you a couple other quick things. You’ll almost certainly find these 
tidbits helpful.
Monitoring and updating securities values
Regardless of whether you’re working with a mutual fund account or with 
securities in a brokerage account, you can collect current market prices and 
store them with the Quicken account information.
To do so, use the Portfolio window (which you can open by clicking the 
Views button and choosing the Portfolio command) to display the invest­
ment account with the mutual fund shares or the securities that you want to 
update.
To record the current market price for a security, use the up-arrow and 
down-arrow keys to select the security (or click the security with the 
mouse). Then move the cursor to the Quote/Price field and enter the 
current price.

258
Part III: Home Finances 
Researching investments
If you display the Investing tab, click the Investing Tools button, and choose 
the Online Research Tools command, Quicken displays a short menu of 
commands for accessing online research resources available through the 
Quicken.com Web site. I think that the Mutual Fund Finder is particularly 
valuable. And the other tools can also be pretty darn useful. By the way, if 
you do use the Mutual Fund Finder to look for good mutual funds, you should 
know that investment management fees are highly, highly negatively corre­
lated with long-term investment performance. In other words, the higher the 
investment management fees, the lower the returns over long periods of time.
Adjusting errors
You can adjust the cash balance in a brokerage account and the shares bal­
ance in brokerage accounts if for some reason the figures are incorrect.
Oops, my brokerage cash balance is wrong
How you adjust the cash balance in a brokerage account depends on how 
you set up the account.
To adjust an investment account’s cash balance, when the cash balance 
information isn’t tracked in a separate linked cash account, click the invest­
ment account’s name on the Accounts bar, click the Investing Actions button, 
and choose Investing Activities➪Update Cash Balance. When Quicken dis­
plays the Update Cash Balance dialog box, shown in Figure 14-9, specify the 
correct cash balance and the date as of when the figure you enter is correct.
	
Figure 14-9: 
The Update 
Cash 
Balance 
dialog box.
	
To adjust an investment account’s cash balance (or cash management 
account, as some brokerage houses call them), click the account name on 
the Accounts bar, click the Investing Actions button, and choose Investing 
Activities➪Reconcile An Account. You reconcile a brokerage cash account 
the same way you reconcile a regular old checking account. For information 

259
 Chapter 14: Stocks and Bonds
about how to reconcile a checking account, refer to Chapter 8. Chapter 8 
describes how to reconcile a bank account, but reconciling a brokerage cash 
account works the same way.
Oops, my brokerage account shares balance is wrong
To adjust the shares balance for a security in a brokerage account, click the 
brokerage account on the Accounts bar, click the Investing Actions button, 
and choose Investing Activities➪Update Share Balance.
Quicken next displays the Adjust Share Balance dialog box, shown in Figure 
14-10, where you specify the security, the correct number of shares, and the 
date for which you’re entering the balance. Fill in the text boxes and then 
click either Enter/New or Enter/Done. Quicken adjusts the shares balance for 
the security you specified.

Share 
Balance 
dialog box.
	
A few words on the Investing 
tab’s views and tools
If you’ve read this whole chapter, you know that I mostly describe how you 
get information into the windows and dialog boxes of the Investing tab. But 
before I stop talking about the Investing tab, I want to give you a little more 
information on how you can use the tab to monitor your investments.
The first thing to notice is that the Investing tab provides several views 
(available as menu commands when you click the Views button), each of 
which provides its own information: Account Overview, Performance, Asset 
Allocation, Portfolio, and Online Portfolio:

260
Part III: Home Finances 
	
✓	The Account Overview view simply lists the investment accounts 
you’ve set up within Quicken and provides a bit of high-level information 
about each.
	
✓	The Performance view (see Figure 14-11) graphs your investment 
account values and lets you compare these values to some external 
benchmark, such as the S&P 500.
	
✓	The Asset Allocation view provides charts and tables of information 
that let you see how your overall investments are allocated and how 
you’ve said they should be allocated (see Figure 14-12). (You need to 
have identified which asset category your individual investment securi­
ties fall into in order to see your portfolio allocation.)
	
✓	The Portfolio view provides overall summary information about all your 
investment accounts (see Figure 14-13).
	
✓	The Online Portfolio view displays the (currently free) Quicken.com 
Investing Portfolio Web site, which you can use to monitor all your 
investments and to perform investment research. For example, if you 
do register with the Quicken.com Web site, you can download updated 
prices for your securities by clicking the Download Quotes button, 
which appears on many of the Investing tab’s views.

262
Part III: Home Finances 
The other thing I want to just mention in passing are the asset allocation 
and portfolio analysis tools available when you click the Investing Tools 
button. Through the Investing Tools button, Quicken provides several 
useful commands:
	
✓	The Asset Allocation Guide command displays a Web page that pro­
vides lots of solid information you can use to think smartly about how 
you allocate your investments between stocks and bonds and other 
choices. (This command is definitely worth a few minutes of exploration 
on your part.)
	
✓	The Buy/Sell Preview command lets you estimate the financial effect on 
your portfolio of buying and/or selling specific investments.
	
✓	The Capital Gains Estimator command calculates the unrealized capital 
gains and losses in your investment portfolio using the most current 
prices available to Quicken.
	
✓	The Portfolio Analyzer command displays a report that shows the over­
all return on your investment portfolio over a specified time horizon.
	
✓	The Portfolio Rebalancer command displays a report that summarizes 
what buy and sell actions you should take to balance your investment 
portfolio so it matches the target asset allocation you’ve chosen using 
the Asset Allocation Guide command.
	
✓	The Security Detail command displays the Security Detail View window, 
which lets you see all the information that Quicken has collected for a 
partnership security in your portfolio. (You specify which security you 
want to see details for by choosing the security from the drop-down list 
box in the upper-left corner of the window.)
	
✓	The Online Research command displays a menu with six additional, 
self-explanatory commands that you can use to research investment 
choices. Rather than try to provide short descriptions of these com­
mands, let me suggest you poke around these commands on your own.

I
f you use Quicken Home & Business for your small 
business or you use Quicken Rental Property Manager 
for real estate investments, you’ll benefit from some extra 
information and hand-holding about how to use your 
flavor of the Quicken program. Sure, you can learn these 
things by sitting down with your certified public accoun­
tant (CPA), having a cup of coffee, and paying about $200

Or you can read on, pretend that we’re chitchatting over 
coffee, and save the $200.

Chapter 15
Mind Your Business
In This Chapter
▶	Setting up a business using Quicken
▶	Working with your customers
▶	Bookkeeping whistles and bells in Quicken Home & Business
▶	Doing payroll using Quicken
T
he preceding chapters of this little book talk about using Quicken for 
your personal bookkeeping. But you may be interested to know that 
Quicken also does just a truly excellent job at small business accounting, too.
If you want to use Quicken for small business accounting, you need to do 
just a couple of things: First, you want to make sure you’re working with the 
Home & Business version or the Quicken Rental Property Manager version of 
Quicken, because both these flavors of Quicken supply an extra menu of seri­
ously useful business bookkeeping commands. Second, and this is only my 
humble opinion, you want to skim through this chapter’s discussions so you 
get the business bookkeeping stuff setup right.
	
If you’re not already working with Quicken Home & Business, you can upgrade 
to Home & Business by choosing the Add Business Tools or Add Rental 
Property Tools command on the Help menu. If that option isn’t available or 
doesn’t make sense, contact Intuit by visiting the www.quicken.com Web site. 
Setting Up a Business the Quicken Way
To use Quicken for a small business bookkeeping, you need to describe each 
business you or your spouse operates. For example, if you work as a one-
person consultant, and your spouse runs a landscape design business, 
you need to tell Quicken a little bit about both businesses. Quicken needs 
this information so it can separately track each business and can produce 
invoices for each business.

266
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
Describing your business(es)
To describe your business to Quicken, you need to give the business’s name 
and identify the owner. Here’s how you do this:
	
1.	Choose the Manage Business Information command.
	
	 Display the Business tab, click the Business Tools button, and choose 
the Manage Business Information command. Quicken displays the 
Manage Business Information window.
	
	 If you don’t have a Business tab, either you need to choose View➪
Standard Menus or you need to choose Help➪Add Business Tools.
	
2.	Click the Add button.
	
	 Quicken displays the Add Business dialog box (see Figure 15-1).
	
Figure 15-1: 
The Add 
Business 
dialog box.
	
	
3.	Enter your firm’s name in the Business Name text box.
	
	 Optionally, you can also enter a brief description in the Description box, 
which appears just below the Business Name text box.
	
4.	Identify the business owner.
	
	 Use the Owner option buttons, Self and Spouse, to indicate who owns 
the business — you or your better half.
	
5.	Create a tag for the business.
	
	 You want the tag to be a memorable yet short acronym or abbreviation 
you can use to mark transactions as connected to a particular business. 
For example, say your family does operate two businesses: a consult­
ing business and a landscape design business. You might use the tags 
“Cons” (for consulting) and “Land” (for landscape design).

267
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
	
6.	(Optional) Specify this business is the default business.
	
	 You can tell Quicken that a particular business is the default business — in 
other words, that Quicken should assume a business transaction relates 
to this business unless you tell Quicken otherwise. To do this, check the 
Business Transactions Without A Tag Belong To This Business box.
	
7.	Save your business description.
	
	 Quicken returns you to the Manage Business Information window, 
which now lists your newly described business venture. If you need to 
add more businesses, repeat Steps 2 through 7. Click Done to close the 
Manage Business Information window.
	
	 The Manage Business Information window provides two useful buttons I 
should briefly mention: Delete and Edit. You can click the Delete button 
to remove the selected business description. And you can click the Edit 
button to display the Edit Business dialog box, which allows you to 
change the selected business’s description.
Designing business invoices
You need to add your business’s name and address to the business 
invoice template that Quicken produces. To do this, display the Business 
tab, click the Business Actions button, and then choose the Invoices and 
Estimates➪Design Forms command. When Quicken displays the Forms 
Designer window, click the Company Address Properties button so that 
Quicken displays the Company Address dialog box (see Figure 15-2). Then 
enter your business and address. Note that you may need to click the Let’s 
Get Started button the first time you want to access this dialog box.
	
Figure 15-2: 
The 
Company 
Address 
dialog box 
on top of 
the Forms 
Designer 
window.
	
I’m not going to discuss the Forms Designer window in more detail, but you 
may want to poke around the window a bit. You can use the window’s but­
tons and boxes to customize with abandon the invoice form that Quicken 

268
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
produces. Note, too, that you may need or want to create and customize 
multiple invoice templates — such as if you are using Quicken for more than 
one business or such as when you want to use distinctly different invoices 
for different customers, products, or services. You can create a new invoice 
template by clicking the Forms Designer window’s Layout button and then 
choosing New on the menu that Quicken displays.
Identifying invoice items
The stuff that appears on invoices — product or service descriptions, standard 
prices, and so forth — needs to be provided up-front to Quicken by setting up 
invoice items.
Suppose, for example, that you’re using Quicken to keep the books for a one-
person consulting business, and that you bill your consulting services by the 
hour, charging people $125 an hour. To describe this standard invoice infor­
mation, you would set up a “consulting” item, using the following steps: 
	
1.	Choose the View All Invoice Items command.
	
	 Display the Business tab, click the Business Actions button, and then 
choose the Invoices and Estimates➪View All Invoice Items command. 
Quicken displays the Customize Invoice Items window.
	
2.	Click the New button.
	
	 Quicken displays the New Item dialog box (see Figure 15-3).
	
3.	Name the item you’re creating.
	
	 For example, you might name an item for consulting services “consult.” 
You just need to use an item name that’s descriptive enough that you 
remember the item details when you see the item name.
	
Figure 15-3: 
The New 
Item dialog 
box.
	

269
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
	
4.	Categorize and tag.
	
	 Use the Category/Tag box to specify which income category should be 
used to account for the item and, when you’re running multiple busi­
nesses, which tag should be used to identify the business. For example, 
you might want a “consult” item (which bills for professional services) 
to get categorized using a “Service Revenue” income category while you 
might want a “client costs” item (which bills for costs you’ve incurred 
on behalf of a client) to get categorized using a “Reimbursed Expenses” 
income category. 
	
	 If you’ve set up two different businesses, consulting and landscape 
design, and use the tags “cons” and “land” to differentiate, you would 
append the “/cons” tag to the category you specify for consulting busi­
ness invoice items. And you would append the “/land” tag to the cat­
egory you specify for landscape design business invoice items. Note that 
you precede the actual tag name with a slash (/) symbol to tell Quicken 
that you’re using a tag.
	
5.	Describe the item in more detail, please.
	
	 Use the Description text box to provide the text you want to automati­
cally appear on the invoice for the item. You can (and probably should) 
be quite descriptive here. Of course, you can add more text to the 
invoice and edit the invoice item descriptions later on when you actually 
create the invoice. But Quicken automatically enters the item descrip­
tion for you. You therefore want to make Quicken type up any long, 
detailed descriptions.
	
6.	Flag any subtotal items.
	
	 Okay, here’s a weird thing about items that appear on an invoice. 
Anything that you want to put in the body of your invoice is an item. 
Obviously, the services and products you sell need to be set up as items. 
But other stuff that you want to put on the invoice — shipping charges, 
discounts, markups, and so on — also need to be set up as items.
	
	 After you understand this weirdness, things become more clear (hope­
fully) about subtotal items. The Subtotal Of The Preceding Items check 
box, if marked, tells Quicken that the item simply adds up the preceding 
items shown on the invoice. Probably, by the way, the right item name 
and description for a subtotal item is subtotal (for the item name) and 
Subtotal or Total (for the item description).
	
	 If you indicate an item is a subtotal, by the way, you don’t provide a 
category or tag. But that makes sense: Quicken grabs the category and 
tag information from the individual “real” items getting subtotaled — not 
the subtotal item.
	
7.	(Optional) Add a blank line after the item.
	
	 To tell Quicken to add a blank line on invoices after an item, check the 
Print Extra Blank Line box.

270
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
	
8.	Set the item price.
	
	 Use the Per Item Rate to specify a default price for the item. In the case 
where you’re setting up an item for a service, for example, you might 
enter the hourly billing rate into the Per Item Rate box.
	
9.	Identify items subject to sales tax.
	
	 If an item is subject to sales tax — in other words, if you’re supposed to 
charge sales tax on the item — check the Taxable box.
	
10.	Give the percentage for any percentage-based items.
	
	 You may not need percentage items for your invoices. But if you regu­
larly bill people for items that get calculated as a percentage of some 
other item on the invoice, you use a percentage item.
	
	 Percentage items calculate an amount for your invoice by multiplying a 
percentage against the previous item. For example, if the previous item 
shown on an invoice equals $1000, a 10 percent “percentage” item adds 
another $100 to the invoice.
	
	 Note that when you check the Percentage box, the value you enter into 
the Per Item Rate is not a dollar amount but a percentage value. You 
enter 10 percent, for example, as 10.
	
	 When you finish describing an item, click the New Item dialog box’s OK. 
Quicken returns you to the Customize Invoice Items window. To add 
more items, repeat the preceding steps. Or click the Customize Invoice 
Item window’s Done button.
Working with Customers
You can invoice customers, record their payments, and monitor unpaid 
amounts after you’ve described your business, finalized your invoice form(s), 
and created an item list.
Setting up a Customer Invoices account
Quicken needs you to set up a Customer Invoices account to track the 
invoices you create. But this isn’t difficult to do. Simply display the Business 
tab, click the Business Actions button, and choose the Invoices and 
Estimates➪Customer Invoices command. When you do, Quicken checks to 
see whether you’ve already set up an account to track amounts your custom­
ers owe you. If you haven’t, Quicken asks if it can set up such an account. 

271
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
If you answer “yes,” Quicken asks if it’s okay to use a name like “Customer 
Invoices.” When you click the “Sure, I don’t care what you name the account” 
button, Quicken then sets up the account for you. When Quicken sets up the 
Customer Invoices account, it also sets up a sales tax payable account to 
track any sales taxes you collect from customers.
I’m not going to talk a bunch more about the Customer Invoices account, but 
let me make just three quick points:
	
✓	The Customer Invoices account is a regular Quicken account — sort of 
like a bank account. You will see the Customer Invoices account listed, 
for example, in the Accounts bar and on the Account List window.
	
✓	You can enter or edit transactions directly by viewing the account in a 
register window (the same sort of register window I describe in detail 
in Chapter 4). Typically, you won’t work directly with the register, 
however, because Quicken provides easy-to-use tools for recording cus­
tomer invoices and payments (as described a bit later in this section).
	
✓	The Unpaid Invoices List is an easy way to see which customer invoices 
are open (often these are the only invoices you truly care about). To dis­
play this list, display the Business tab, click the Business Tools button, 
and then choose the Unpaid Invoices List command.
Invoicing your customers
To invoice a customer, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Create Invoice command.
	
	 Display the Business tab, click the Business Actions button, and choose 
the Invoices and Estimates➪Create Invoice command. Quicken displays 
the Invoice window (see Figure 15-4). The Invoice window in Figure 15-4 
shows a bit of information in its boxes, but don’t get confused about 
that. In the steps that follow, I describe how to enter this information.
	
2.	Identify the customer and provide the address, if necessary.
	
	 If you’re invoicing a customer for the first time, type his or her name 
into the Customer box in the upper-left corner of the Invoice window. 
Quicken will copy the company name to the Bill To box. You can then 
complete the address by adding the street information, city, state, and 
ZIP code.
	
	 If you’re invoicing a customer for the second or subsequent time, open 
the Customer box and select the customer from the list that Quicken 
displays.

Figure 15-4: 
The Invoice 
window.
	
	
	 You can add customers on the fly — which is what I describe in the 
preceding step — and which means you only briefly describe your cus­
tomers with sketchy vagueness. Alternatively, you can also go hog wild 
and describe each and every customer in painstaking detail. To go the 
painstaking detail route, choose the Business➪Customers➪Add 
Customer command. When Quicken displays the Edit Address Book 
Record dialog box, use its boxes to describe your customer. Note that 
you can use the Add Customer command at any time. You don’t need 
to wait until you’re ready to record an invoice.
	
3.	Tag the transaction.
	
	 If you’re using Quicken to track more than one business and you’ve 
(very rightly) created a tag for each business, enter the appropriate tag 
into the Business Tag box.
	
4.	Provide the Date, Invoice Number, and Purchase Order Number 
information.
	
	 Use the Date box to indicate the invoicing date (typically the invoice 
date is the actual date you create the invoice). Use the Due Date box 
to specify when you expect payment. Use the Invoice # box to give the 
invoice a unique number. Finally, if you’re billing on purchase order 
numbers, use the P.O. Number box to provide the customer his or her 
purchase order number.

273
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
	
5.	Describe the individual items you’re invoicing the customer for.
	
	 To enter an invoice item, click the Item column for the line you want to 
add and then select an item from the list Quicken displays. Quicken adds 
the category and description information you provided for the item — 
but you can edit these if you want. Next, specify the item quantity and 
verify the rate.
	
	 You can initially fit ten items onto an invoice, but if you need more 
room, click the Add Lines button.
	
6.	Add sales tax if applicable.
	
	 If items on the invoice are subject to sales tax, enter the sales tax rate into 
the Tax box. Quicken then calculates the sales tax for you by multiplying 
the sales tax percentage against each of the taxable items on the invoice.
	
	Note: Quicken tracks the sales tax you’ve collected using a liability 
account. Quicken shows the liability account in the Tax Account drop-
down list box at the bottom of the window.
	
7.	(Optional) Add customer messages or memo descriptions to the 
invoice.
	
	 If you want to add a message to the invoice, enter the message in the 
Customer Message box.
	
	 If you want to record a bit of extra information about the invoice — 
information that won’t appear on the invoice — enter that into the 
Memo box.
	
8.	Save the invoice.
	
	 You can save the invoice and close the Invoice window by clicking Save 
and Done. Or, you can save the invoice and redisplay an empty Invoice 
window so you can create another invoice by clicking Save and New.
Printing invoices
You can print invoices as you create them. Simply click the Print button on 
the Invoice window. The Print button looks like a printer and appears in the 
lower-left corner of the window. When you click the Print button, Quicken 
displays the Print Invoice dialog box. Click its OK button to print the invoice.
You can also print invoices in batches. To use batch printing, first create 
your batch of invoices (obviously). Next, display the Business tab, click the 
Business Tools button, and then choose the Print Invoices/Invoices List 
command. When Quicken displays the Invoices List, verify that the invoices 
you want to print are marked with a check, click the Print button so that 
Quicken displays a menu of print commands, and then choose the List com­
mand. Quicken displays the Print dialog box. Click its OK button to print the 
selected invoices.

274
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
	
The Print Invoice and Print dialog boxes provide a bunch of buttons and 
boxes you can use to control how Quicken prints your invoices. If you have 
questions about how these printing options work, refer to Chapter 5. Chapter 
5 describes how to print checks and check registers, but the process for print­
ing those items closely resembles the process for printing invoices.
Recording customer payments
To record a customer payment, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose the Receive Customer Payment command.
	
	 Display the Business tab, click the Business Actions button, and choose 
the Invoices and Estimates➪Receive Customer Payment command. 
Quicken displays the Payment window (see Figure 15-5).
	
Figure 15-5: 
The 
Payment 
window.
	
	
2.	Select the customer.
	
	 Open the Customer box and select the customer for whom you want to 
record a payment. After you select the customer and move to the next 
box, Quicken displays a list of any unpaid invoices the customer owes.
	
3.	Describe the payment.
	
	 You should enter the payment amount into the Amount box. That, I’m 
sure, represents a big surprise.

275
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
	
	 You should probably also record the payment date using the Date box 
and the customer’s check number using the Check Number box.
	
4.	Select the bank account into which you’ll deposit the check.
	
	 This is easy. Open the Deposit To drop-down list box and select the 
bank account.
	
5.	Identify the open invoices the customer is paying.
	
	 Quicken attempts to guess at which unpaid invoices the customer is 
paying, marking the invoices with a check. Often Quicken guesses cor­
rectly, but verify that the correct invoice shows a check mark. You can 
mark and unmark invoices by clicking the check mark.
	
	 If a payment pays partial amounts of unpaid invoices, you can click 
the Payment column in the Outstanding Invoices list and then edit the 
amount.
	
6.	Record the payment.
	
	 After you describe the payment and apply it to the correct open 
invoices, click the Enter button. Quicken records the payment and 
updates the invoice open balance(s).
Issuing credits and making refunds
Quicken provides commands and windows for issuing credits and for making 
refunds to customers.
To record a credit — a credit is essentially a backwards invoice that says you 
owe your customer money rather than the other way around — display the 
Business tab, click the Business Actions button, and choose the Invoices and 
Estimates➪Issue Credit command. When Quicken displays the Credit window 
(which is a mirror image of the Invoice window), record your credit memo. 
You won’t have any trouble using the Credit window if you’ve previously 
used the Invoice window. But if you have questions, refer to the steps pro­
vided earlier for invoicing your customers.
To refund money to a customer because of an earlier credit memo, display 
the Business tab, click the Business Actions button, and choose the Invoices 
and Estimates➪Issue a Refund command. When Quicken displays the Refund 
dialog box, identify the account you’ll write the refund check on, specify to 
which customer you want to issue a refund by using the Customer box, and 
then click Enter. Quicken records a check for you in the appropriate bank 
account register.

Business Bookkeeping 
Whistles and Bells
Quicken Home & Business (which is what I’ve spent the earlier paragraphs of 
this chapter talking about) provides a handful of additional business book­
keeping tools. I’m not going to describe these tools in any detail in this book 
because I don’t think you’ll use the tools. Nevertheless, I do want to give you 
a quick overview.
Jobs and projects
If you’re really alert and have good eyes, you’ll have noticed a Project/Job 
box in some of the figures of this chapter and on some of the Quicken Home 
& Business windows. Just a quick note to explain: Most small businesses 
probably bill customers. But you can find yourself, in some industries, bill­
ing jobs or projects that are in turn owned or managed by a customer. If this 
sounds like your situation, you’ll want to use the Customers➪Create Project/
Job command (available when you click the Business Actions button avail­
able on the Business tab) to set up jobs or projects underneath your cus­
tomers. When you invoice, you’ll also want to include not only the customer 
name on the invoice but also the project or job.
Using finance charges, estimates, 
and statements
Three customer-invoicing commands (available on the Business tab when 
you click the Business Actions button and choose the Invoices and Estimates 
command) deserve a quick description: Create Estimates, Create Finance 
Charge, and Print Statements.
The Create Estimates command allows you to create a dummy invoice you 
can give to a customer as a preliminary cost estimate of a job or service. The 
Estimate window, not surprisingly, mirrors the Invoice window. In fact, if you 
ultimately need to invoice the customer for something you’ve previously 
estimated, you display the Business tab, click the Business Tools button, and 
choose the Estimates List command. When Quicken displays the Estimates 
List window, select the estimate from the window that Quicken displays, and 
click the Convert button.

277
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
The Create Finance Charge command allows you to assess a finance charge 
on a past due invoice. In essence, when you use the command, Quicken 
creates an invoice for the customer with a single item on it for the finance 
charge.
The Print Statements command lets you print customer statements, which 
show the open invoices for a customer at a specific point in time. If you have 
customers for whom you need a statement, you’ll obviously need to use this 
command.
Managing vendor bills
If you display the Business tab, click the Business Actions button, and choose 
the Bills and Vendor command, Quicken displays a menu of commands that 
let you create a simple accounts payable system for tracking your unpaid 
bills from vendors.
I’m not going to describe these commands here. You really shouldn’t need 
to set up an accounts payable system for a small business except in the 
special case where someone has foolishly decided your business should 
use accrual-based accounting rather than cash-basis accounting. (If that is 
your situation — my apologies, but you need to get help from the nabob 
who sent you down the accrual-based accounting path.)
	
If you just record expenses by writing checks — this is the way that Chapters 
4 and 5 describe — you essentially keep your books using cash-basis account­
ing. Cash-basis accounting usually works best for small businesses. It delays 
your income tax expenses, and it keeps your bookkeeping simpler.
Vehicle Mileage Tracker
Quicken Home & Business provides a handy utility you can use to keep a 
log of your business auto or truck usage. As you’re probably tired of hearing 
your accountant say, you need to keep such a log in order to prove your busi­
ness vehicle usage.
I’m not going to describe the Vehicle Mileage Tracker here, though. You’ll 
find the tool very straightforward to use. Simply display the Business tab, 
click the Business Tools button, choose the Mileage Tracker command, and 
poke around a bit.

Quicken Dirty Payroll
A lot of people who own small businesses or who have a household employee 
(nannies, for example) need to deal with payroll. Although Quicken Home & 
Business doesn’t provide you payroll tools, I still want to provide you with 
some quick-and-dirty instructions about how to handle simple payroll situa­
tions with Quicken. Oh, sure. It won’t be fancy. But I promise you it’ll be fast 
and cheap.
Getting ready for payroll
To do payroll in Quicken, you need to set up a couple of payroll expense cat­
egories. Fortunately, doing so is not particularly difficult.
	
I’m going to describe how you do this task for purposes of U.S. federal 
income and payroll taxes. If you employ people in a state that has a state 
income tax — California, say — you may also have to deal with state payroll 
taxes. But you can track and process these the same way you process the 
federal taxes. (Some counties and cities even have income taxes, but these 
should also work the same way.)
Setting up the wages expense category
You need to set up a payroll expense category for taking the wages you pay 
employees. Here’s all you do:
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Category List.
	
	 Quicken, with no hesitation, displays the Category List window.
	
2.	Click the New button.
	
	 Quicken displays the Set Up Category dialog box (see Figure 15-6).
	
3.	Enter Wages as the category name by moving the cursor to the Name 
text box and typing Wages.
	
	 If you told Quicken during the setup that you’ll use Quicken to track a 
business, Quicken may have automatically set up the Wages category.
	
4.	(Optional) Enter a description of the category.
	
	 If you want, you can type a description in the Description text box.
	
5.	In the Type section, click the Expense option button.
	
	 This choice tells Quicken that you’re setting up an expense category.

279
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
	
6.	Describe the tax characteristics of this category.
 
• If you’re preparing payroll for a business, select the Tax-Related 
check box.
 
• If you’re preparing payroll for a household employee — like a 
nanny, say — don’t select the Tax-Related check box. This little 
check box merely tells Quicken to include this category on the 
Tax Summary report. Household employee payroll expenses 
aren’t tax deductible — as you probably know.
	
	 Optionally, you can select the tax form from the Tax Line Item drop-
down list box on which this category should be reported for U.S. federal 
tax purposes.
	
7.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken adds the category to the category list and redisplays the 
Category List window.
	
Figure 15-6: 
The Set Up 
Category 
dialog box.
	
Setting up the payroll 
tax expense category
You also need to set up a payroll tax category to track payroll taxes that the 
employer pays, including the company’s share of Social Security taxes, the 
company’s share of Medicare taxes, and any other employer payroll taxes 
(such as federal unemployment tax or the equivalent state employer taxes).

280
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
To set up a payroll tax expense category, follow the same steps I give you 
for setting up a wages expense category (in the preceding section). You can 
name the category payroll taxes, or taxes-payroll, or something else that’s 
even more clever.
Getting the taxes stuff right
You also need to do a couple other things if you want to do payroll the right 
way in the U.S. of A.
Requesting (or demanding) an employer ID number
First, you need to file an SS-4, or Request for Employer Identification Number 
form, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so that you can get an Employer 
Identification Number. You can get this form by calling the IRS or by visiting 
the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov).
In one of its cooler moves, the IRS allows you to apply for and receive an 
Employer Identification Number right online. Visit the www.irs.gov Web 
site and then click the Apply For An Employer Identification Number (EIN) 
link located on the left side of the page.
So what about Social Security, Medicare, and withholding taxes?
You need to do two things before you can figure out how to handle all those 
taxes. First, you need your employees to fill out W-4 forms to let you know 
what filing status they’ll use and how many withholding allowances, or per­
sonal exemptions, they’ll claim. You can get blank W-4 forms from the www.
irs.gov Web site, too.
You also need to get a Circular E Employer’s Tax Guide publication. The 
Circular E publication is the pamphlet that tells you how much you should 
withhold in federal income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare from 
employees’ salaries based on what they say about their filing statuses and 
the number of withholding allowances they claim on the W-4 forms men­
tioned in the preceding paragraph.
Paying someone for a job well done
After you set up the two needed expense categories within Quicken and after 
you collect the necessary tax information, you’re ready to pay someone.

281
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
Figuring out the gross wages figure
Determining how much to pay your employees should be pretty easy. Does 
Raoul make $15 per hour? Did he work 40 hours? Then you owe him $600 
because $15 times 40 equals $600. Is Betty’s salary $400 per week? Then you 
owe her $400 for the week.
Calculating that deductions stuff
Your next step — after you know how much you’re supposed to pay Raoul 
and Betty — is to figure out what Uncle Sam says you must withhold.
To determine this amount, you need both Raoul’s and Betty’s W-4s to find 
out their filing statuses and personal exemptions. Then just flip to the page 
in the Circular E that describes withholding for persons claiming those filing 
statuses and weekly pay.
If Raoul is single and claims just one personal exemption, for example, you 
need to flip to the page that shows appropriate withholding amounts for 
single people receiving weekly payroll checks. That page shows a table that 
will clearly indicate what you’re supposed to withhold from Raoul’s check for 
federal income taxes. For example, the table might say that a single person 
making $600 a week who claims one withholding allowance should have $79 
withheld for federal taxes.
And Betty? Remember that fictional Betty’s pay is $400 per week. If Betty’s 
filing status is married, she is filing jointly, and has three personal exemp­
tions, you’d need to need to flip to the page in the Circular E that shows with­
holding amounts for a married person filing a joint return when the person 
claims three withholding allowances. Pretend just for the sake of illustration 
that the Circular E says you’re supposed to withhold $18 each week from 
Betty’s check.
You determine Social Security and Medicare amounts by multiplying the 
gross wage figure by a set percentage. Social Security is 6.2 percent of 
the gross wages up to roughly $100,000. The Medicare tax is 1.45 percent 
of the gross wages with no wage limit. Be sure to check your faithful Circular E 
if you think limits come into play for a particular employee. Note, too, that as 
I’m writing this, Congress is tinkering with the tax laws again. But, of course, 
Congress is always tinkering with the tax laws.
Figuring out someone’s net wages
Table 15-1 summarizes the payroll calculations based on the example devel­
oped in the preceding paragraphs.

What’s left over
Does Table 15-1 make sense? If it doesn’t, quickly skim through the preceding 
four or five paragraphs. All I’ve really done in the table is reorganize some 
information, calculate the Social Security and Medicare taxes, and show how 
Raoul’s and Betty’s gross pay gets nickeled and dimed by the various taxes 
they owe.
Working with other taxes and deductions
If you have other taxes and deductions to make and you know how the fed­
eral income taxes, Social Security taxes, and Medicare taxes work, you won’t 
have any problem working with other taxes — whatever they are.
State income tax withholding, for example, works like the federal income tax 
withholding. (Of course, you need to get the state’s equivalent to the Circular 
E guide.)
In general, you treat other taxes and the amounts the employee pays similarly.
	
In fact, the only thing that you need to be careful about is what affects your 
employees’ gross pay for income taxes but not their Social Security taxes — 
things such as 401(k) deductions and certain fringe benefits. If you have these 
kinds of things to deal with and you need help, just ask your accountant. 
(Providing general answers that will work for everyone who reads this para­
graph is just too difficult — and actually kind of dangerous, too. Sorry.)
Recording a payroll check
After you make the tax deduction and net wages calculation, you’re ready to 
record the check. Suppose that you’re going to record the check by using the 
Write Checks window. After you display the window, follow these steps:
	
1.	Enter the date of the payroll check in the Date field.
	
2.	Enter the payroll check number in the Num field.
	
3.	Enter the employee name in the Payee field.

283
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
	
4.	Enter the net wages amount in the Payment field.
	
5.	Categorize the payroll tax as wages (see Figure 15-7).
	
	 Specify the expense category as Wages.
	
6.	To record the payroll check, click Record Check.
	
Figure 15-7:

You did it! You recorded a payroll check. Maybe it wasn’t all that much fun, 
but at least it wasn’t very difficult. (Chapter 5 describes how to print checks, 
just in case you’re interested.)
Depositing taxes
Make no mistake. Uncle Sam wants the money you withhold from an employ­
ee’s payroll check for federal income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare. 
Uncle Sam also wants the payroll taxes you owe — such as matching Social 
Security and Medicare taxes and federal unemployment taxes.
Every so often, then, you need to pay Uncle Sam the amounts you owe.
Making the payments for these taxes is easy.

284
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
Depositing the employee withholding
To remit the payroll taxes you withhold from an employee’s check, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Get an 8109 tax deposit coupon from the IRS.
	
	 You should call the IRS a few weeks before you need the coupons. 
Sometimes, note, the IRS will send you a yellow booklet of tax deposit 
coupons automatically.
	
	 You can usually get the IRS to rush you several blank coupons if you’re 
running a little late.
	
2.	Fill out the coupon by adding your name, address, and employer iden­
tification number.
	
	 This will be easy. Write your name in the space provided. Write in the 
amount. You’ll also need to indicate what type of deposit you’re making 
and for what quarter:
 
• 941: Deposits of income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare taxes 
are 941 deposits.
 
• 940: Deposits of federal unemployment taxes are 940 deposits.
	
3.	Write a check equal to the payroll taxes that you withheld from the 
employee’s check.
	
	 Make the check payable to the local bank. Categorize the check as falling 
into the Wages expense category. In the example case of Betty, where 
the withholding includes $18 of income taxes, $24.80 of Social Security 
taxes, and $5.80 of Medicare taxes, you would write a check for $48.60 
payable to the local bank. Again — and sorry to be so anal about this — 
you need to categorize the check in the Wages expense category.
	
	 Do not categorize the check that remits the employee’s portion of his or 
her taxes as falling into the payroll tax category. That would be a mis­
take. And, yes, I know: It seems like payroll tax expense would be the 
right category. The withheld taxes are tax expenses of the employee, 
however — not tax expenses of the employer. The money represents a 
wage expense to the employer.
	
	 Betty’s true earnings were $400: the $351.40 net payroll check plus the 
$48.60 of payroll-related and income taxes that she owed but that you, 
the employer, withheld.
	
4.	Bring the check you’ve written and the 8109 coupon to the bank.
	
	 Hand them both to the teller. Pretend like you know what you’re doing. 
And whatever you do, stay cool and smile.
	
	 And that’s it. 

285
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
Paying employer payroll taxes
You have to match any Social Security and Medicare taxes paid by the 
employee. To record the payment of these payroll taxes, you follow a similar 
set of steps as in the preceding section. Find or get another 8109 tax deposit 
coupon and fill it out. Write a check equal to the payroll taxes you owe as 
the employer. (In the example case of Betty, where the withholding included 
$24.80 of Social Security taxes and $5.80 of Medicare taxes, you would write 
a check for $30.60 payable to the local bank.) Then bring the check and the 
8109 coupon to the bank.
	
When you pay the employer’s payroll taxes — such as the matching Social 
Security and Medicare taxes — you want to categorize the check as a payroll 
tax category. This money absolutely does represent a payroll tax expense to 
the employer.
Tax deposit tips
Let me make a handful of suggestions about making tax deposits easier and 
less painful. On the subject of tax deposits, let me also tell you that my fast-
but-fancy payroll method has a weakness you should know about.
Tax deposit tip #1: Combine checks
Here’s my first tip. In the preceding discussion, I suggested you use one 
check and one 8109 coupon to pay the employee’s taxes and another check 
and another 8109 coupon to pay the employer’s taxes.
Specifically, I described how to write a $48.60 check categorized as a wage 
expense and then how to write a $30.60 check categorized as a payroll tax 
expense. But you could, in fact, save yourself a bit of fiddle-faddling by writ­
ing one check for $79.20 that combines both payments. If you do this, just be 
sure to split the transaction with $48.60 categorized as a wage expense and 
$30.60 categorized as a payroll tax expense.
Tax deposit tip #2: Combine employees
In the running example in this chapter, I describe how to deal with payroll 
taxes for a single employee.
I feel sort of dumb saying this, but you would (of course) often have more 
than one employee. And in that case, you would probably combine the pay­
roll tax deposits for all the employees.
	
If you do have multiple employees, you probably want to consider using 
either a small business accounting system, such as QuickBooks, or an 
outside payroll service bureau. Most of the payroll calculations and 

286
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
bookkeeping will be pretty easy, but figuring out what you owe in terms of 
payroll tax deposits can be a bit messy if you have more than one employee 
to pay at a time.
Tax deposit tip #3: Don’t delay your deposit
The system I describe in the preceding paragraphs doesn’t keep track of 
what you owe in payroll tax liabilities (the withheld taxes, the company’s 
matching of Social Security tax, and so on). And that’s bad, obviously. You 
shouldn’t just foolishly ignore any of your business or personal debts, of 
course. If you just quickly deposit your payroll taxes (immediately after every 
payroll), you should be fine.
Tax deposit tip #4: Consider using EFTPS
The IRS provides an alternative to writing checks and filling out 8109 cou­
pons. You can sign up for an online payment system — EFTPS — that tells 
the U.S. Treasury to just grab money directly from your checking account. 
(For you word nerds out there, Electronic Federal Tax Payment System is this 
system’s full name.)
The EFTPS service is really convenient and slick. (I use it for my business 
payroll.) To use EFTPS, you simply fill out an on-screen window that resem­
bles the 8109 coupon.
You can get more information about this service and even sign up for it at the 
www.eftps.gov Web site.
Tax deposit tip #5: Know the De Minimis rule
While I’m talking about federal payroll tax deposits, I should cover another 
general — but very useful — rule related to when you need to make the 
deposit: If your accumulated payroll taxes are less than $1,000, you can pay 
the taxes the next time you’re supposed to remit payroll taxes: the next pay­
roll date, the next month, or whatever. (This is called the De Minimis rule — 
named after the Congresswoman Dee Minimis, I think.) Don’t rely on this rule, 
however, without first checking with the IRS or your tax advisor.
	
Some businesses are either now, or will shortly be, required to electronically 
remit payroll tax deposits directly to the U.S. Treasury. The IRS should tell you 
when that’s the case. Sign up for EFTPS if you need to do this.
Filing quarterly payroll tax returns
At the end of every quarter, you need to file a quarterly payroll tax return. 
(Specifically, you must file a Form 941 — which is a form you fill out to say 
how much you paid in gross wages, how much you withheld in federal taxes, 
and how much you owe for employer payroll taxes.)

287
 Chapter 15: Mind Your Business
If you don’t own a business but have household employees — such as a 
nanny — you file a Form 942. You fill out this form to say how much you paid 
in gross wages, withheld in federal taxes, and owe in payroll taxes.
To get the gross wages totals and the balances in each of the payroll tax lia­
bility accounts, print a Cash Flow report for the quarter you need to report. 
You can do this by choosing Reports➪Banking➪Cash Flow. Quicken displays 
the Cash Flow report, but the dates will probably be wrong, so click the 
Customize button. Quicken displays the Customize Cash Flow dialog box.
Specify the range of dates as the start and end of the quarter for which you’re 
preparing a quarterly report. Then click OK. Quicken produces a Cash Flow 
report, which you can easily use to fill out the quarterly payroll tax return.
You’ll also need to report on the 941 tax form how much money you withheld 
from the employee’s checks for federal withholding. You can do this manu­
ally (by looking through their payroll records) or algebraically (by comparing 
whatever the 941 or 942 shows as the total Social Security and Medicare taxes 
amount with the total payments made to the IRS). The difference between what 
you paid in total 8109 payroll deposits and what you paid in total payments to 
the IRS for payroll taxes should equal the federal withholding amount.
However, you know what? If your accountant fills out the 941 or 942 for you, 
you don’t even need to read the stuff in the preceding three sections. Your 
accountant won’t have any problem completing the quarterly payroll tax 
return by using the Quicken report, and, in fact — I kid you not — will prob­
ably even enjoy it.
	
Even if you want to do payroll returns yourself in the future, have your tax 
accountant prepare the first return. You can then use that as a template for 
correctly preparing any future returns.
Computing annual returns 
and wage statements
At year end, you need to file some annual returns — like the 940 federal 
unemployment tax return and the W-2 and W-3 wage statements. (You’ll need 
to prepare these by hand. Perhaps to protest all the work that small busi­
nesses have to do in order to comply with tax laws, you could prepare these 
forms by hand, using a cheap ballpoint pen. Just an idea.)
As a practical matter, as long as you’re doing payroll for a single employee, 
the only thing that’s different about filling out these reports is that you need 
to use a Cash Flow report that covers the entire year — not just a single quar­
ter. So you need to enter the range of dates in the Cash Flow report dialog 
box as January 1 and December 31.

288
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
The 940 annual return is darn easy if you’ve been wrestling with the 941 or 
942 quarterly returns. The 940 annual return works the same basic way as 
those more difficult quarterly tax returns. You print the old payroll report, 
enter a few numbers, and then write a check for the amount you owe.
	
You need to prepare annual state unemployment summaries before preparing 
the 940. The 940 requires information from the state returns.
For the W-2 statements and the summary W-3 (which summarizes your W-2s), 
you just print the old Cash Flow report. Then, carefully following directions, 
enter the gross wages, the Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld, and 
the federal income taxes withheld into the appropriate blanks.
If you have a little trouble, call the IRS. If you have a lot of trouble, splurge 
and hire someone to do it. Again, any experienced bookkeeper can do the job 
for you.
Doing the state payroll taxes thing
Yeah. I haven’t talked about state payroll taxes — at least not in any great 
detail. I wish I could provide this sort of detailed, state-specific help to you. 
Unfortunately, doing so would make this chapter about 150 pages long. It 
would also cause me to go stark-raving mad.
However, you still need to deal with the state payroll taxes. State payroll 
taxes follow the same basic mechanics you apply to federal payroll taxes. 
For example, state income tax works the same way federal income tax works, 
employer-paid state unemployment taxes work the same way employer-paid 
federal unemployment taxes work, and employee-paid state taxes work the 
same way employee-paid Social Security and Medicare taxes work.
If you’re tuned in to how federal payroll taxes work in Quicken, you really 
shouldn’t have a problem with the mechanics of the state payroll taxes.

▶	Describing tenants
▶	Recording tenant rent payments
▶	Recording rental expenses
▶	Tracking rental property profits
T
he Quicken Rental Property Manager version of Quicken — the focus of 
this short chapter — provides everything available in the other versions 
of Quicken. The Rental Property Manager version also includes tools for 
tracking both your rental properties and your rental income and expense.
If you own rental properties — and I say this as a CPA who breaks down and 
cries several times each year when I see the messy financial records that 
most real estate investors keep — you definitely want to make the invest­
ment and buy Quicken Rental Property Manager. You’ll have a much better 
handle on your rental property investments, the rental income the properties 
earn, and the rental deductions the properties produce.
Describing a Rental Property
In order to track rental properties with Quicken, you need to describe each 
property. To describe a property, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the Rental Property tab.
	
	 If you purchased the Rental Manager version of Quicken, you should 
also have a Rental Property tab available in the Quicken window. If you 
want to manage rental properties but didn’t buy the Rental Manager 
version of Quicken, you may be able to buy and immediately turn 
on the Rental Manager functionality by choosing Help➪Add Rental 
Property Tools.

Part IV: Very Serious Business 
	
2.	Click the Properties button and choose Add Property.
	
	 Quicken displays the Add Rental Property dialog box (see Figure 16-1).
	
	 The Properties button also displays another command, Show Property 
List, which displays a window that lists the previously added rental 
properties. You can edit a rental property that appears in this property 
list by selecting the property and then clicking the Edit button. You can 
remove a rental property that appears in this property list by selecting 
the property and then clicking the Delete button.
	
3.	Describe the property.
	
	 Describe the rental property you’re going to track in Quicken. You’ll 
want to name the property using the Property Name text box. You can 
then create a tag for the property’s income and expense transactions 
using the Tag text box. Optionally, you can enter the street, city, state, 
and ZIP code information in the appropriately labeled text boxes.
	
	 Note: You use the tag to mark, or tag, each income or expense transac­
tion for a specific property. By tagging the transactions in this way, 
Quicken easily produces a profit and loss statement by rental property. 
You want a profit and loss statement by property to manage your real 
estate investments, of course. But you also need a profit and loss state­
ment by property for your year-end income tax returns.
	
4.	Indicate whether the property is a single or multiple unit.
	
Figure 16-1: 
The Add 
Rental 
Property 
dialog box.
	

291
 Chapter 16: Managing Rentals
	
	 Use the Property Type Information option buttons — Single Unit 
Property and Multiunit Property — to specify whether the property is 
a single unit property (like a single family rental house) or a multiunit 
property (like a four-plex or a strip mall).
	
5.	(Optional) Identify the multiple units.
	
	 If you indicate in Step 4 that a rental property is multiunit, Quicken adds 
the Unit Information text boxes to the Add Rental Property dialog box 
(see Figure 16-1 again if you like). Use these boxes to name each of the 
rental units using, for example, apartment letters, suite numbers, or 
some similar identifying label.
	
6.	(Optional) Track the net worth of the property.
	
	 If you want to track the fair market value or your estimate of the fair 
market value of the rental property, mark the Yes I Want To Track The 
Value Of This Rental Property button. Then, without laughing, enter the 
fair market value of the property in the Approximate Value text box.
	
	 Note: If you decide to track the net worth of the property, Quicken adds 
an asset account to the Quicken account list.
	
7.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken displays the Rental Property tab, or window, with the rental 
property you just created (see Figure 16-2).

Describing Tenants
After you describe your rental property or properties, you need to describe 
the tenants that occupy the property or properties. To describe the tenants, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the Rental Property tab.
	
2.	Click the Tenants button and choose Add Tenant.
	
	 Quicken displays the Add Rental Property Tenant dialog box (see 
Figure 16-3).
	
Figure 16-3: 
The Add 
Rental 
Property

	 The Tenants button also displays another command, Show Tenants 
List. Choose the Show Tenants List command to display a window that 
lists the previously added tenants. You can edit and delete tenants that 
appear in the list by clicking the tenant and clicking either the Edit or 
Delete button.
	
3.	Describe the tenant.
	
	 Describe the tenant by clicking the Rent Details tab and then entering 
the renter’s name in the Tenant Name text box and the monthly rent in 
the Rent Amount text box.
	
	 Select the bank account name into which you’ll deposit rent in the 
Account Name drop-down list box and the property (or property and 
unit) the tenant occupies in the Property drop-down list box.

293
 Chapter 16: Managing Rentals
	
	 You can specify the rent due date — and I’m sure this is a big surprise — 
using the Rent Due On drop-down list box.
	
	 Optionally, you can use the Contact tab of the Add Rental Property 
Tenant window to collect and store contact information for the tenant, 
including work phone number, home phone number, e-mail, and so on.
	
4.	(Optional) Document the lease agreement.
	
	 You can use the Terms and Agreement tab to document the rental agree­
ment, recording items such as the lease term, lease start date, late fee, 
and so forth.
	
	 You can use the Security Deposit tab to record the security deposit you 
collect at the start of the lease and any security deposit you return at 
the end of the lease.
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 Quicken displays the Rental Property tab, or window. The tenant or 
tenants you’ve added appear indented below the rental property they 
occupy.
Recording Tenant Rent Payments
After you describe your properties and your tenants, you can begin record­
ing tenant rent payments as tenants pay you, the lord of manor. Simply follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Display the Rental Property tab.
	
	 No problem here, right? You just click the tab.
	
2.	Select the tenant.
	
	 Select the tenant for whom you want to record rent. Quicken highlights 
the tenant information and adds two, tiny, rather cute buttons labeled 
Enter and Skip to the tenant information.
	
3.	Click the tenant’s Enter button.
	
	 Quicken displays the Enter Transaction dialog box (see Figure 16-4). 
Quicken knows most of what it needs to know in order to record the rent 
payment: the property, the tenant name, the rent amount, and so on. 
But confirm that this information is correct. You might want to edit the 
contents of the Memo text box, for example. Or you may need to assess 
a late fee if the tenant has paid late.

Transaction 
dialog box.
	
	
4.	Click Add to record the transaction.
	
	 Quicken adds the rent payment to your records, recording the rent 
check as a deposit into the specified bank account. Behind the scenes, 
Quicken tags the transaction as income related to a specific property — 
just as you want it to do.
Recording Rental Expenses
I’m not going to provide you with a blow-by-blow recipe for recording rental 
expenses. The reason? You actually already know how to record rental prop­
erty expenses if you’ve used Quicken for recording checks and other pay­
ments from a bank account.
All you need to do to record a rental property expense is tag the transaction 
with the property’s tag. That’s it. Seriously. Take a peek at Figure 16-5. See 
the last highlighted transaction — written to Joe’s Plumbing for $75 dollars? 
That Repairs expense counts as a rental property expense because the Tag 
text box shows a rental property tag, Wetmore Duplex. Notice that the rental 
property expense category is followed by the “/” symbol and then the tag.
If you have questions about how to record checks into a Quicken bank 
account, refer to Chapter 4.

295
 Chapter 16: Managing Rentals
	
Figure 16-5: 
Use tags 
to record

property 
expenses.
	
	
This is kind of an awkward question, but how good is your eyesight? Can you 
see the details of Figure 16-5 clearly? If you can’t, can you find a pair of reading 
glasses and squint a bit? The reason I ask these questions is that a few rows 
above the $75 check to Joe’s Plumbing, you’ll see a couple of tagged deposits. 
These deposits are example rent checks.
Tracking Rental Property Profits
I don’t want to talk too long about the Rental Property Manager features. If 
I do that, you’ll think the tools are complicated to learn and use. The tools 
aren’t complicated. They’re really, really easy.
Before I quit, however, I do want to share one quick reminder: In Chapter 7, 
I talk about how to produce reports in Quicken, including how to produce 
reports specifically designed to track your rental properties. Peek back there.

296
Part IV: Very Serious Business 
Another thing to point out — and this is sort of redundant, but it’s so darn 
important — is that the Rental Property Manager features let you track rental 
income and rental expenses by properties using those tags you create for each 
property. This tagging means you can produce reports that show profit by 
property (see Figure 16-6). This “profit by property” measurement is really 
important. You use the segmented profit data to manage your properties — 
and to report what’s happening with your rental properties on your tax return.
	
Figure 16-6: 
A Cash Flow 
report by 
property.
	
Working with tags
The Quicken tags aren’t just for rental prop­
erties. In fact, tags (which used to be called 
classes in a previous version of Quicken) pro­
vide you with a second method for organizing 
the data. Categories, of course, are the first 
data organization method, but tags are the 
second. And they deserve your respect and 
admiration.
Because tags can get used for other purposes, 
Quicken’s Tools menu provides a Tag List 
command. Choose this command, and Quicken 
displays the Tag List window. This window lists 
all the tags you’ve set up — and all the tags 
that the Quicken Rental Property Manager 
has set up for you. You can add still more tags 
by choosing the Add button. You can edit and 
delete existing tags by selecting a tag and then 
choosing the Edit or Delete button.

W
hen people find out that I’ve written a book about Quicken, they 
always ask a question or two. In this chapter, I list the most common 
questions and their answers.
What Are Quicken’s Best Features?
Quicken has become more and more complicated over the years, so I think it 
may be fair to include a few sentences that review its most valuable and least 
valuable features. As far as what’s best or most valuable, I would say that 
its checkbook feature is still clearly the most valuable. If you should use one 

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
feature in Quicken, it’s the checkbook stuff. (To do so, set up a bank account 
for your checking account as described in Chapter 1 and then use Quicken 
to keep track of your balances, income, and expenditures as described in 
Chapter 4.)
I also have to say that I think that Intuit, the maker of Quicken, provides 
pretty neat stuff at its Quicken Web site, so I’d give that feature my vote as 
the second best. I don’t talk about the Quicken.com Web site a whole lot in 
this book. That’s because you can have more fun and more success with 
Quicken.com by exploring the site on your own.
Just because I’m super-compulsive not only about my personal finances but 
also about yours, let me say that I think that the Quicken financial calcula­
tors (I describe them in Chapter 10) are also really valuable. If you’re willing 
and able to do just a bit of planning right now, you’ll be truly amazed by the 
positive impact that planning has on your financial affairs a few years down 
the road.
So this leads rather nicely to another question: What are Quicken’s least 
valuable features? I think the answer really depends on the person. I used to 
pooh-pooh the online banking because my bank caused me headaches, and 
my at-home, dialup Internet connection was unreliable. (With a fast cable 
modem connection now, however, I really do like online banking.) The credit 
card stuff and cash account stuff don’t do much for me. But you know what? 
Those tools may do wonderful things for you. It depends on the way you’ve 
organized your finances.
I guess the bottom line, to me, is that the least useful features depend on what 
you don’t need to do. But what you don’t need to do will probably differ from 
what I don’t need to do. I’m sorry that I don’t have more helpful criticism.
Does Quicken Work for a Corporation?
Sure. But let me talk for a minute about what’s unique — at least from an 
accountant’s perspective — about a corporation.
In addition to recording assets (such as bank accounts and receivables) and 
liabilities (such as mortgages and trade payables), a corporation often needs 
to track, or keep records for, stockholder equity.
Stockholder equity includes the amount people originally paid for their stock, 
any earnings the corporation has retained, cumulative income for the current 
year, and sometimes other stuff, too.

301
 Chapter 17: Ten Questions I’m Frequently Asked about Quicken
“Ugh,” you’re probably saying to yourself. “Ugh” is right. Accounting for stock­
holder equity of a corporation is mighty complicated at times. It’s so compli­
cated, in fact, that Quicken can’t track a corporation’s stockholder equity.
	
I’m not saying that you can’t use Quicken if you’re a corporation, and I’m not 
saying that you shouldn’t. (I do business as a corporation, and I used to use 
Quicken just for laughs.) Just remember that someone — probably your poor 
accountant — periodically needs to calculate your stockholders’ equity.
Fortunately, the financial information you collect with Quicken provides, 
in rough form, much of the information that your poor accountant needs in 
order to do things manually.
But, er, this all makes me remember something else. If your corporation 
enjoys revenue of $250,000 per year or more or owns assets that total 
$250,000 or more, you must include a balance sheet with your corporate tax 
return. (This isn’t something I just made up. It’s actually the law.) Quicken 
isn’t very good about creating business balance sheets — or at least the sort 
of balance sheet that needs to get included with your tax return. Accordingly, 
if your corporation grows so that its revenues or assets equal or exceed 
$250,000, consider retiring Quicken and upgrading to QuickBooks.
What Happens to Stockholders’ 
Equity in Quicken?
	
Quicken doesn’t exactly ignore a corporation’s stockholder equity. In an 
Account Balances report, the difference between the total assets and the total 
liabilities actually represents the total stockholder equity. (Quicken labels this 
total Net Worth.) So, to the extent that your total assets and total liabilities fig­
ures are correct, you know your total stockholder equity.
Does Quicken Work for a Partnership?
Yep, it does. But a partnership that uses Quicken faces the same basic prob­
lem as a corporation that uses Quicken. In a partnership, the partners want 
to track their partnership capital accounts (or at least they should). A part­
nership capital account simply shows what a partner has put into and taken 
out of a business.

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
As noted in the preceding section, Quicken calculates a net worth figure for 
you by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. So, to the extent that your 
total assets and total liabilities are accurately accounted for in Quicken, you 
know roughly the total partnership capital.
To solve this problem, you (or someone else) need to track what each partner 
puts into the business, earns as a partner in the business, and then takes out of 
the business. You can also (and I’ve helped clients do this) just use the Quicken 
loan accounts for partnership equity accounts. You just need to not get freaked 
out when your net worth shows as zero, and you need to remember that the 
partnership equity accounts aren’t really loans — they’re capital.
One other thing to think about here concerns your partnership tax return. 
If your partnership books revenue of $250,000 per year or more or owns 
assets that total $650,000 or more, you will need to include a balance sheet 
with your partnership tax return. As mentioned in my earlier discussion 
about using Quicken for a corporation’s accounting, Quicken isn’t very good 
about creating the sort of balance sheet that needs to get included with a 
tax return. Accordingly, if your partnership grows so that its revenues equal 
or exceed $250,000 or so that its assets equal or exceed $650,000, consider 
upgrading to QuickBooks.
Can I Use Quicken for More 
Than One Business?
Yeah, but be very careful. Very careful. You must be especially diligent in 
keeping the two businesses’ financial records separate.
Quicken provides a handy tool for keeping them straight: You can work 
with more than one file. Each file, in effect, is like a separate set of financial 
records. You can’t record automatic transfers between accounts in different 
files; instead, you must record each side of the transaction separately. You 
can, however, keep truly separate business records.
To create a separate file, choose File➪New.
If you’ve been using Quicken for a while, you can probably figure out for 
yourself how the File➪New command works.
	
Keeping separate bank accounts is a must. If you keep separate records for two 
distinct businesses in Quicken, you need to set up separate bank accounts for 
them. In fact, my attorney tells me that in the case of a corporation, you must 
set up a separate corporate bank account for the corporation to be truly consid­
ered as an independent legal entity. Talk to your attorney if you have questions; 
attorneys can tell you the specifics that apply to a particular state and situation.

303
 Chapter 17: Ten Questions I’m Frequently Asked about Quicken
What Kinds of Businesses 
Shouldn’t Use Quicken?
You’re probably saying to yourself, “Quicken works for corporations (sort 
of), and it works for partnerships (sort of). Does that mean that it works for 
just about any kind of business?”
The answer is no. Quicken is a darn good product. In fact, for many small 
businesses, it’s a great product. But it doesn’t work in every situation.
The following is a three-part test that you can use to determine whether 
your business should use Quicken. If you answer yes to two or three of the 
questions, you should seriously consider moving up to a full-featured, small-
business accounting system (like QuickBooks).
	
✓	Do you regularly need to produce business forms other than checks?
 
• If you answer no to this question, you’re in good shape with 
Quicken, which produces checks easily. And if all you need is an 
occasional invoice, you can create it easily enough on your com­
puter. To produce a handful of invoices per month, for example, 
you can use your word processor. If you want to, you can also 
use one of the super-sized versions of Quicken: Quicken Home & 
Business or Quicken Rental Property Manager. Both of these ver­
sions of Quicken do not only invoices but also monthly customer 
statements. (I talk about these features in Chapter 15.)
 
• If you do produce a lot of forms besides checks and invoices — 
for example, purchase orders — you should probably consider 
moving to a small business accounting system that produces 
the forms you want. If you’ve been using Quicken, for example, 
take a look at QuickBooks, another Intuit product. Microsoft’s 
Office Accounting program merits a look. Another more power­
ful but wonderfully designed product you might try is Peachtree 
Accounting for Windows from Peachtree Software. You can prob­
ably buy any of these programs at the local office supplies store. 
You can certainly buy the QuickBooks and Peachtree Accounting 
programs by visiting www.quickbooks.com or www.peachtree.
com. For reference, I can recommend these two Wiley books: 
QuickBooks 2010 For Dummies, by yours truly (earlier versions of 
QuickBooks have their own editions), and Peachtree For Dummies, 
3rd Edition, by Elaine Marmel and Diane Koers (both from Wiley 
Publishing).
	
✓	Do you need to track assets other than cash, accounts receivable, or 
investments?

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
	
	For example, do you buy and resell inventory? Do you have a bunch of 
fixed assets (furniture, equipment, and stuff like that) that you need to 
track? An accounting system is usually helpful in tracking these items. 
Quicken doesn’t do a very good job of tracking these other assets, so 
you may want to look at one of the other small business accounting 
products — QuickBooks, for example.
	
✓	Are you having problems measuring your profits with cash-basis 
accounting?
	
	I’m not going to get into a big, tangled discussion of cash-basis versus 
accrual-basis accounting. It wouldn’t be any fun for you. It wouldn’t be 
any fun for me, either. Nevertheless, you should know that if you can’t 
accurately measure your business profits by using cash-basis account­
ing (which is what Quicken uses), you may be able to more accurately 
measure your business profits by using accrual-basis accounting. To do 
so, use an accounting system that supports accrual-basis accounting. 
I should be totally honest with you and tell you that to measure your 
profits the right way, you (or your accountant) need to use — horror of 
horrors — double-entry bookkeeping.
	
If you’re a Quicken user but realize that you’re outgrowing the checkbook-
on-a-computer scene, check out QuickBooks. (No, I don’t get a kickback from 
Intuit.) Here’s the deal: QuickBooks looks and feels a lot like Quicken. Plus, it 
uses the data that you’ve already collected with Quicken, so you’ll find that 
moving from Quicken to QuickBooks is only slightly more complicated than 
rolling off a log.
Can I Use Quicken for 
Real Estate Investing?
Yeah. Absolutely.
In a nutshell, all you need to do is set up an income category to track your 
rental income and then some expense categories to track your rental 
expenses. (In Chapter 2, in the section about changing a category list, I 
describe how to set up income and expense categories.)
To see which rental expense categories you need, either look at the Schedule 
E tax form that went with last year’s tax return (if you’ve already been invest­
ing in real estate) or grab a Schedule E tax form from www.irs.gov (if you’re 
new to real estate investing).
Now, before you stop reading and rush off to do the bookkeeping for your 
growing real estate empire, let me tell you one other critical thing: The 
Schedule E tax form on which you report your real estate income and 

305
 Chapter 17: Ten Questions I’m Frequently Asked about Quicken
deductions requires you to segregate your income and deductions by prop­
erty. For example, if you have two rental properties — a duplex on Winston 
Street and a single-family cottage on Roosevelt Avenue — you’ll need to 
break down your income and expenses by property.
To break down income and expenses by property, you use a Quicken feature 
called tags. Oh, yes, it all sounds complicated. But all you need to do is enter 
the tag name in the Tag field. For example, rather than just enter rent in the 
Category field when recording a rent payment from your tenants living in the 
Winston Street duplex, you enter rent (as the Category) and then also enter 
Winston (as the Tag).
By appending the tag Winston to the transaction, you can later easily pro­
duce a cash flow that shows income and expenses for the Winston duplex.
Just to make sure that you understand this, let me give you another example. 
Rather than record a check to pay the utilities expenses for the house on 
Roosevelt as utilities, enter utilities as the category and Roosevelt as the tag.
By appending the tag Roosevelt to the transaction, you can easily produce a 
cash flow later that shows income and expenses for the Roosevelt cottage.
A couple of other notes about this: The first time you enter a tag name into 
the Tag field, Quicken asks whether you want to set up a new tag. When you 
click “Heck yeah,” Quicken prompts you for a bit of information about the tag. 
After that, though, you just enter the tag without fanfare or embarrassment.
To produce a report that summarizes income and deduction information by 
tag, choose Reports➪Banking➪Cash Flow By Tag.
I talk a bit about the rental property management features in Quicken in 
Chapter 16.
Can I Use Quicken Retroactively?
Yeah. And the idea is better than it may seem at first.
Entering one year’s worth of transactions doesn’t take long in Quicken (as 
long as you have decent records to work with). If you’re a millionaire, the 
task may take you a couple of days. (Of course, in this case, you can hire 
someone to do it for you.) If you’re a regular, ordinary person, I bet you can 
get it done on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
After you enter all the information into a Quicken register, you can easily 
monitor your spending in various categories, track your income and outgo, 
and reconcile your bank accounts. I know one professional who uses Quicken

Part V: The Part of Tens 
records to do these things every year. Hey, it’s not the most efficient way to 
do things. And it’s not a very good way to manage business or personal finan­
cial affairs. But it works. Sort of.
Can I Do Payroll with Quicken?
Yes. See Chapter 15 for more details.
By the way, if you have only one or two salaried employees who always 
earn the same amount — a nanny, for example — you can rather easily use 
Quicken for payroll. But if you have a bunch of employees or even a single 
hourly employee, you’ll probably want to either purchase a full-featured, real-
live, small business accounting program (such as QuickBooks) or use a pay­
roll service (such as Paychex or ADP) to take care of the whole thing for you.
Intuit makes and sells QuickBooks, as you may guess by its name. You can 
get QuickBooks from the local software store, from one of the mail-order 
places, or by downloading it from the Intuit Web site.
You can look up either payroll service — Paychex or ADP — in the telephone 
book. You can also look up either payroll service — Paychex or ADP — at 
www.paychex.com or www.adp.com, respectively.
Can I Prepare Invoices?
Not with Quicken Premier or Quicken Deluxe, but you can (very nicely, 
thank you) with Quicken Premier Home & Business and with Quicken Rental 
Property Manager. If you want invoices, at least step up to Quicken Premier 
Home & Business. This requirement may also be a symptom indicating that 
you should consider moving up to a full-featured, small business accounting 
system, such as QuickBooks.
Can I Import Data from an 
Old Accounting System?
Someone had to ask this question, I guess. (Imagine me taking a deep breath 
here.) Yes, you can import data from your old accounting system. To do so, 
export the old system’s data into a file that matches the Quicken Interchange 

307
 Chapter 17: Ten Questions I’m Frequently Asked about Quicken
Format, or QIF, specification. (A QIF file just neatly organizes financial infor­
mation in a well-documented structure so that other programs — and even 
people — can read and understand the data.) Then import this file into an 
empty Quicken file. Keep in mind, however, that this process isn’t for the 
timid or fainthearted. I would also say that it isn’t for people who have better 
things to do with their time.
My advice to you? Go to a movie. Mow your lawn. Read a trashy novel. Forget 
all about this importing business. Or, if you’re really determined, look for a 
QIF conversion tool on the Internet. They do, er, exist.
What Do You Think about Quicken?
I think it’s great. But I bet your question isn’t really whether Quicken is good 
or not. Heck, the package has something like 10 million happy users, so we 
both know that the package is pretty good, right? My guess is that what you 
really want is my opinion about using Quicken in particular business or per­
sonal situations.
It’s tough to answer this question in a one-way conversation. Even so, let me 
give you some of the best reasons for using Quicken:
	
✓	You always know your bank account balances, so you won’t ever have 
to wonder whether you have enough money to pay a bill or charge a 
purchase.
	
✓	Reconciling your account takes about two minutes. (I’m not joking.)
	
✓	You get a firm handle on what you’re really making and spending.
	
✓	You can budget your spending and then track your spending against 
your budget.
	
✓	If you’re a business, you can measure your profits as often as you want 
by using cash-basis accounting.
	
✓	If you’re an investor, you can monitor your investments and measure 
their actual returns.
I hope these answers help. My guess is that if you think that a program such 
as Quicken will help you better manage your financial affairs, it probably will.

(Almost) Ten Tips on How Not to

investments and earning just average returns

employer matching
▶	Don’t tap your computer’s and the Quicken program’s power to develop powerful,

▶	Give in to the first big temptation of wealth building
▶	Give in to the second big temptation of wealth building
You read the chapter title right. But let me explain a couple of things. 
First, about ten years ago, I wrote a book about how to save a million 
dollars for one’s retirement. That sounds a little money-grubbing, I’ll agree, 
but my argument then (and now) is that most people need to accumulate a 
nice-sized nest egg for retirement because most of us can’t or shouldn’t really 
count on things like pensions and Social Security for all our retirement needs.
If Congress does nothing — absolutely nothing — to save Social Security in 
the United States, the best studies show that, about 30–40 years from now, 
the government will need to reduce benefits to around 70 percent of the 
amount it pays today. For example, someone who may receive $1,000 per 
month today may instead receive $700 in the future. Likewise, someone who 
receives $400 today may instead receive $280 in the future. Although that dif­
ference isn’t quite the financial meltdown some people think, it does mean 
that you and I really must prepare to augment our retirement income by 
having our own savings.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
So, anyway, as part of promoting this book, I spent several weeks on the road 
doing radio call-in shows, bookstore appearances, and television talk shows. 
I learned several things from that experience. First, I learned that after one 
appears on some television show, it is, apparently, customary to remove the 
strange makeup that’s applied for the cameras. This step is especially impor­
tant if you plan to appear later in public.
I also learned something else in my travels and talking with people. Although 
everyone is interested in becoming a millionaire or in preparing financially 
for retirement, it turns out that most people are really more interested in 
how not to become a millionaire. In other words, they wanted me to explain 
in financial terms why people don’t accumulate wealth.
At first, I thought that this was a little strange. But then finally somebody 
explained, “We all know you need to save and invest to build wealth. . . . What 
we don’t know are those things that prevent or sabotage our attempts to do 
this.” People in the audience didn’t want to make the same mistakes.
And so that is what I want to cover here. I want to share with you my obser­
vations and research results about why people who know they should save at 
least some money for retirement don’t end up building wealth. I’ve observed 
that eight really common problems or traps foul up most people.
	
Before I begin, note that one thing that happens when you start talking about 
compound interest and future values is that inflation makes comparing apples 
to apples difficult. In other words, I can say something like, “ . . . and then 
you’ll have $3,000,000.” But you then have to wonder what that amount will 
be worth factoring in inflation. To deal with this annoying complexity, I adjust 
for inflation all the numbers I use in the following paragraphs. I subtract the 
inflation amount and give you only the adjusted-for-inflation numbers in cur­
rent-day dollars. Note that the Quicken financial planners also let you adjust 
for inflation by checking the Adjust For Inflation check box, which appears in 
most of the calculator dialog boxes.
Ignore the Fact That You Can 
Build Wealth by Investing in 
Ownership Investments and 
Earning Average Returns
You can build surprising wealth just by investing in ownership investments 
that produce average returns. By ownership investments, I mean basically 
stocks and maybe real estate. Here are three examples:

311
 Chapter 18: (Almost) Ten Tips on How Not to Become a Millionaire
	
✓	Just by earning the stock market’s average inflated adjusted return of 
around 6 percent, a 25-year-old saving $150 per month can build as 
much as $300,000 by age 65.
	
✓	Just by earning the stock market’s average inflated adjusted return of 
around 6 percent, a 35-year-old saving $300 per month can build as 
much as $300,000 by age 65.
	
✓	Just by earning the stock market’s average inflated adjusted return of 
around 6 percent, a 50-year-old saving $850 per month can build as 
much as $300,000 by age 65.
I want to stop here. An important truth here is that, sadly, most people miss 
this information. Consider what this means: You don’t have to get fancy. 
You don’t have to spend a bunch of time worrying. You don’t need to spend 
a bunch of money on advisors, newsletters, or commissions — or even on 
books about using Quicken.
Compound interest is a powerful engine, and it creates wealth. And that 
means that you can build surprising wealth by investing in ownership invest­
ments and earning just average returns.
Note, too, that you can lock in average returns by choosing a low-cost 
index fund, such as The Vanguard Group’s Index 500 or Total Stock Market 
Portfolio mutual fund.
	
If you choose an actively managed mutual fund or a mutual fund that charges 
average fees for managing your money, you basically don’t have a snowball’s 
chance in you-know-where of actually earning an average return over time. 
Over the long investment horizon required to prepare for retirement, if you 
go this route, chances are you’ll actually earn a return that’s equal to the mar­
ket’s return less the expense ratio that the mutual fund manager charges and the 
trading costs the manager incurs. Expense ratios for actively managed funds run 
about 2 percent annually. So, rather than a 6  or 7 percent annual adjusted-
for-inflation return, you’ll actually earn a 4 or 5 percent annual adjusted-for-
inflation return on actively managed mutual funds.
One final point: People see way more risk in this investing than really exists — 
particularly after the last few years. But over decades, which is how long 
you’ll invest, the risk drops. If you had begun investing in the stock market 
in the mid-1920s and then continued systematically investing for 25 years 
through the crash of 1929, the global depression of the ’30s, World War II, 
and the start of the Cold War, you would have earned about an 8 percent 
return on your money. Given that the inflation rate was just 2 percent over 
this same period of time, you still could have built wealth by investing in 
ownership investments producing average returns. I honestly expect similar 
real returns over the remaining decades (I hope) of my life.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Ignore the Fact That You Can Get Much, 
and Maybe Most, of the Money from Tax 
Savings and Employer Matching
Okay. I’m moving on to another really important point. It’s fine to say that 
you need to invest just $300 per month, and that produces the wealth you 
need. The big question is this: Where do you get that money?
You’ve got bills to pay and a rent or mortgage check to write. You want to 
enjoy at least a few of the material pleasures — like food and drink — that 
life offers up. Where in the world does someone come up with this kind of 
money?
Well, the answer is mostly from the tax man and your employer. No kidding. 
Because of the way that employer-matching provisions work in things like 
401(k) and Simple-IRA plans and because of the way our progressive income 
tax system works, you can get a lot of money from your employer and from the 
government in the form of tax-deduction savings. You may even be able to get 
most of the money you need for your retirement savings from these sources.
Table 18-1 shows how someone who wants to save $300 a month might come 
up with the money. And, in fact, the first line of Table 18-1 shows how much 
you want to save: $300.
The second line of the table shows how much you might get from your 
employer in a 401(k) or Simple-IRA plan. Note that an IRA obviously doesn’t 
include employer matching. (This line shows up, therefore, as zero in Table 
18-1.) But 401(k) plans commonly provide a 50 percent match on at least the 
first portion of your contribution. (This shows up as $100 in the table.) And 
basically by law, Simple-IRAs provide a 100 percent match on the first portion 
of your contribution (which shows up as $150 in the table).

313
 Chapter 18: (Almost) Ten Tips on How Not to Become a Millionaire
The third line of the table shows how much you might get in the way of tax 
savings. For example, if you’re contributing $300 per month to an IRA, you 
might actually enjoy $90 per month in federal and state income tax savings if 
the tax rate you pay on your last dollars of income equals 30 percent. (This 
rate would be the case for many readers.)
The fourth line of the table shows what you need to come up with yourself. 
The IRA is the worst case shown in the table. With an IRA and $300 per month 
of savings, you would need to come up with $210 yourself. The 401(k) plan 
looks better; with it, you need to come up with $140 yourself. The Simple-IRA 
is the best case in the table. With it, you need to come up with only $105.
I don’t want to overload you with data. But please note that this is an incred­
ibly powerful insight. Much, and maybe most, of the money you need to build 
wealth can come from other people — specifically the tax man and your 
employer, if you work someplace that offers a 401(k) or Simple-IRA plan.
Don’t Tap Your Computer’s Power to 
Develop Wealth-Building Insights
This is hard to describe in general terms because by definition, what the 
computer lets you do is get very specific. Consider this: Personal financial 
planning is essentially applied mathematics. What that means is that to 
make a decision, you often need to tally up the costs and benefits of Option 
A versus Option B, and then you need to make time/value of money calcula­
tions. (Practically speaking, this just means that you also need to figure in 
things like interest expense and investment income.) These sorts of tasks are 
the perfect applications for the personal computer.
When you use your computer to make better personal financial decisions, 
you develop powerful, wealth-building insights that often supply the rest of 
the money you need for your investing. More specifically, if you need to save 
$300 per month and you can get $150 of this from your employer and through 
tax savings, you still need to come up with that last $150 per month. But what 
I’m saying is that your computer can, and should, help you find this money.
Here’s one example: Have you heard about early mortgage repayment? It 
sounds like a good idea, at least on the surface. If you add an extra $25 per 
month to the regular mortgage payment on a typical mortgage, you often save 
about $25,000 in interest. (Maybe more. How much you save depends on the 
interest rate, the mortgage balance, and the remaining number of payments.)

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Based on that bit of financial data, early mortgage repayment sounds like a 
pretty good idea. Lots of people — encouraged by financial writers — have 
started doing this. But is it a good idea? It depends.
To determine whether this is truly a good idea, however, you need to weigh 
your options. If you can instead put an extra $25 a month into a 401(k), you 
end up with about $100,000.
So there you have it: Option A, which is early mortgage repayment, sounds 
pretty good because $25,000 of interest savings is a lot of money. But Option 
B, the 401(k) option, is clearly better because, for no extra pain or hassle, you 
end up with $100,000.
But other important financial decisions and personal financial planning 
issues often provide you with similar opportunities for free money or extra 
wealth because you use your computer:
	
✓	ARMs: Sometimes, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) actually make you 
bear less risk and work better.
	
✓	Buying a home: Sometimes this isn’t a good investment — even when it 
seems like it is.
	
✓	Car leases: They can be great deals or terrible deals. It all depends on 
the implicit interest rate that the lease charges.
In Chapter 10, I talk about how you use the Quicken financial planners to 
make better financial decisions. The Internet also provides a ton of tools, 
many helpful, for doing personal financial planning. I don’t want to sound 
like your mother or some cranky uncle, but I urge you to use these sorts of 
computer-based financial tools to make wiser decisions. A little extra money 
here, a little there — and pretty soon, you’ve found that last bit of money you 
need to save for a comfortable retirement. No kidding.
Give Up, Because It’s Too 
Late to Start Anyway
Another common trap that prevents people from saving money for retire­
ment is they give up, thinking that it’s too late to start. I have to tell you that, 
mathematically speaking, that’s just dead wrong.
You may think that wealth-building schemes that rely on compound interest 
work only for young people. It’s true that wealth building can be very easy 
for someone who’s young. Often, young people need to make only a single, 

315
 Chapter 18: (Almost) Ten Tips on How Not to Become a Millionaire
clever decision in order to build wealth. For example, if a 25-year-old, pack-
per-day smoker quits smoking and puts the money he saves into savings, he 
can rather easily build $1,000,000 by retirement. All he needs to do is save 
his money in an IRA and select a small-company, stock mutual index fund. 
(Remember, I adjust for inflation; so really, this person will probably have 
between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000 of inflated dollars.)
You can’t do that if you’re 50 years old. I mean, you can’t make one decision 
and expect that single good decision to grow to $1,000,000.
But there’s another angle in all this: You aren’t limited to making a single 
good decision. Oh, sure. That’s easiest. But I really believe that if you make 
five or six or seven — maybe even ten — good decisions, you can still build 
substantial wealth by the time you stop working.
I don’t think that surprises you if you’re a mature investor. And I don’t think 
it should discourage you. You possess more life experience and, I daresay, 
more wisdom, than someone who’s 25. You can use your experience and 
wisdom to make a greater number of good decisions, and that can produce 
the wealth you need.
Get Entangled in at Least One 
“Get-Rich-Quick” Scheme
Get-rich-quick schemes don’t work except for the person selling the scheme. 
And, in fact, they drain off energy and money you really should be using to 
build your investments. You know all this, of course. We all do. But I think 
that all of us have a tendency to assume that this one particular great invest­
ment or business we’re presented with is different. Oh, sure, we know that 
other dummies get suckered, but “fill in the blank” is different.
I actually don’t think trying the occasional flier is a bad idea. If you have 
some small percentage of your investment money chasing speculative 
returns, that’s okay, but only as long as this iffy investing doesn’t foul up 
your other, more important, boring-but-predictable wealth building for retire­
ment. That’s fair, right? If you or I want to try chasing down the hottest new 
mutual fund or try online day-trading or invest in some friend’s start-up busi­
ness, that seems okay. But you can’t allow these get-rich-quick schemes to 
foul up your meat-and-potatoes investing.
Unfortunately, I see that most of the people who get involved in get-rich-quick 
schemes try to use this speculation as a replacement for true, disciplined invest­
ing. And I have never seen a get-rich-quick scheme that consistently works.

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
I offer one other comment: Many, and perhaps even most, of the best-selling 
books about money and investment techniques amount to just new get-rich-
quick schemes. I’m not going to name names here. Neither my attorney nor 
the publisher will let me. But any book that promises you some way to magi­
cally and consistently double or triple the returns that other investors earn is 
a get-rich-quick scheme.
However, some wonderful books out there show you how to better manage 
your money. For example, Eric Tyson’s book, Personal Finance For Dummies, 
5th edition, is a really good book about the basics. And I’m not just saying 
this to schmooze the publisher. (Both Eric’s book and this book are pub­
lished by Wiley.) I also love basically everything that Andrew Tobias writes 
plus John Bogle’s books about mutual fund investing — Bogle on Mutual 
Funds (Irwin) and Common Sense on Mutual Funds (Wiley) — and Burton 
Malkiel’s The Random Walk Guide to Investing (Norton). All these books 
provide good, fact-based advice that leads you in the right direction.
Fake It with False Affluence
I talk about this a bit in Chapter 3, but it’s an important point and worth 
repeating. When people spend all their money trying to look rich, they don’t 
have any money left over to save and invest. That means that most people 
have to decide — either explicitly or implicitly — whether they want to be 
rich or look rich. Weird, right?
Yet, most millionaires live average lives. They live in average houses located 
in middle-class neighborhoods. They drive average cars.
Ironically, most of the people who live in big houses or drive expensive cars 
aren’t rich. They may have high incomes, but they aren’t rich. And yet that 
makes sense. You can’t become rich if you’re spending all your money trying 
to look rich.
Faking affluence is a trap that goofs up more people than you’d guess.
Give In to the First Big Temptation 
of Wealth Building
I think that when you boil everything down to its very essence, the big 
problem is that most people lack the commitment. We all must be culturally 
programmed this way or something. But most of us — I’m the same way — 
stumble over a couple of big temptations. So I mention these temptations 
here and in the next section.

317
 Chapter 18: (Almost) Ten Tips on How Not to Become a Millionaire
Temptation #1: I can tell you, and so can any good financial planner, how to 
come up with an extra $100 or even $500 per month. Also, if you really do 
use Quicken in a disciplined way to manage your financial affairs, you’ll find 
yourself freeing up money. You’ll save a little bit of money here, waste a little 
less over there; pretty soon, you’ll find yourself with a bit of extra cash. But 
you must have the commitment to save and invest that money. You and I 
have to decide to dedicate the next $100 or $500 to investments. If we do, we 
don’t have to worry about financial security in retirement. And if we don’t, we 
should worry. But anyway, that’s the first temptation. When you find some 
extra money, you need to have the discipline to save and invest those funds. 
And if you do start to do this, you’ll rather quickly amass thousands of dollars.
Give In to the Second Big Temptation 
of Wealth Building
Ironically, resisting Temptation #1 leads rather quickly to…
Temptation #2: After you collect an extra $5,000 or $25,000 or $50,000 in 
your portfolio, you need to have the commitment necessary to let that 
money grow. That seems obvious, of course. But I’ve also noticed that a lot 
of people don’t do this. A lot of people, after they amass a nice little pot of 
money, decide it’s time to abandon a strategy that has worked wonderfully. 
They decide to buy a bigger house or a boat. Or they change investment 
strategies, maybe by investing in some friend’s or family member’s new busi­
ness. Or they turn their money into a hobby — perhaps deciding that they’re 
going to use their retirement money to try out this online investing thing or 
leveraged real estate investing.
It’s your money, of course. You get to do with it whatever you want. But I am 
going to be honest with you and say that if you really want to build up a nice 
nest egg for retirement, you need to be committed enough to resist these two 
big temptations.

fter writing about Quicken for almost 20 years, I’ve had a revelation of 
sorts. People not only want specific, step-by-step information about 
how to use the program, but they also want troubleshooting advice. They 
want techniques and tactics that they can use to solve the inevitable prob­
lems they encounter while using Quicken in real-life settings. What follows is 
my list of the best troubleshooting techniques that I can offer you.
Tactics #1 and #2: Use the Quicken 
Help File and This Book
I know what you may be thinking. You may be thinking that you have some 
problem that you can’t solve by using Help, and it’s either a bug or some 
glaring error in the Quicken documentation. And, of course, you’ve looked 
through this book, and it says nothing — absolutely nothing — about your 
question. In fact, upon further reflection, you may be thinking that you’ve 
encountered some problem that you can’t possibly solve by consulting the 
Quicken Help file or this book.
Maybe you’re right.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
But in my experience (when I talk with people who have problems), about 
half the time, the problem is that people don’t know enough about Quicken to 
know what to do. People simply experience a mechanical problem, and they 
can’t make the program work because they haven’t used Quicken enough to 
figure out how it works. Therefore, the right way to solve this sort of problem 
is to find out more about Quicken and try again. For example, if you’re having 
problems printing a report, just finding out more about printing and reports 
often solves your problem.
In most cases, though not all, you should be able to find the information in 
this book by using either its index or Table of Contents.
Usually, you should be able to find the information (perhaps in a slightly less 
friendly form) in the Quicken Help file. To find information in the Quicken Help 
file, choose Help➪Quicken Help to display the Help window, click the Search 
Quicken Help tab, and then enter the word or phrase that you want to look up.
Tactic #3: Visit the Quicken 
Product Support Web Site
Another really good resource for troubleshooting is the Intuit product sup­
port Web site for Quicken. This Web site, available at http://quicken.
custhelp.com, supplies a rich database of troubleshooting information.
To use the Web site, you select the version of Quicken you’re using. After 
you click your version, you see a Web page that lists common categories of 
problems or questions. You select a category, and you’re on your way. The 
product support Web site then displays a list of troubleshooting articles that 
may help you solve your problem.
Tactics #4 and #5: Check the Microsoft 
or the Hardware Vendor Product 
Support Web Site
Keep in mind the possibility that your problem may not be a problem with 
Quicken at all, but rather a problem with your computer and its hardware 
or with Microsoft Windows. If your problem stems from the hardware or the 
operating system, you can consult the hardware or software maker’s product 
support Web site for troubleshooting information. The Microsoft product 

321
 Chapter 19: (Almost) Ten Troubleshooting Tips
support Web site, which is phenomenally rich in information, is available 
at http://support.microsoft.com. You can usually find the hardware 
maker product support Web site easily by using a good Internet search 
engine. For example, to locate Dell Computer’s product support Web site, 
type something like Dell Computer product support into a search engine 
such as www.google.com.
	
You can find troubleshooting information about Intuit products at the 
Microsoft product support Web site. If the solutions that the site offers aren’t 
very reassuring, at least you can find out whether others have experienced 
the same problem. Microsoft may suggest that you contact the vendor (which 
is Intuit) or that you upgrade to a newer version of the Quicken software. But 
knowing that the problem you’ve encountered is a real problem that Microsoft 
has logged into its product support knowledge base (that’s what Microsoft 
calls it) and described in some technical detail is often useful.
Tactic #6: Contact Intuit Directly
In addition to the option of using the Intuit product support Web site, you 
can also contact Intuit directly. The URL for Intuit support is http://
quicken.custhelp.com.
If you’re willing to wait for your help, you should also know that free support 
is available by e-mail (consult the Intuit support Web site for current details).
Tactic #7: Try a Quicken Newsgroup
If your problem with Quicken isn’t really a program bug or can’t be easily 
solved by getting more information, you can sometimes find an answer by 
consulting other Quicken users. One of the easiest ways to do this is by 
browsing the Quicken newsgroup at http://www.usenet-replayer.com/
opennews/alt.comp.software.financial.quicken.html.
To browse the Quicken newsgroup, you need to use an Internet service pro­
vider that supports newsgroups and a newsgroup reader (such as Outlook 
Express). Assuming that you have these things, you can subscribe to the 
Quicken newsgroup and talk with other Quicken users about the problems 
you’re encountering.
	
You may not need this background information, but I’m going to point out a few 
important things about newsgroups. A specific organization doesn’t typically 
support or police newsgroups. For example, Intuit doesn’t maintain or support 
the Quicken newsgroup. Newsgroups, including the Quicken newsgroup, really 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
amount to freeform — and, sometimes, unruly — discussions among users. You 
can’t expect to have your question answered. And good newsgroup etiquette 
suggests that, if you’re going to ask questions, you should also try to answer 
questions.
Tactic #8: Install and Use 
Antivirus Software
Okay, this shouldn’t really be tactic #8. This tactic deserves a higher ranking 
than that. But that’s beside the point. The point is this: If you can’t solve a 
problem and you have Internet access and you’ve been downloading files or 
accepting e-mail messages with attachments from strangers, your computer 
may have a virus. And it may be that your Quicken problems (particularly 
Quicken problems that you can’t solve in other ways) stem from the virus.
In this case, I’d buy, install, and use antivirus software such as Norton 
AntiVirus or McAfee VirusScan. Consider one of these software programs 
just another part of the price of Internet connectivity. To locate online stores 
where you can download antivirus software, use www.google.com to search 
for Norton AntiVirus or McAfee VirusScan.
Tactic #9: When All Else Fails . . .
If you use a CPA to prepare your federal and state income taxes, you can 
probably get a quick (and perhaps free) answer from him or her. CPAs, as 
you may guess, have spent years learning about and working with accounting 
systems. Commonly, the problems people have with Quicken aren’t technical 
software problems but accounting or bookkeeping conundrums. So what you 
think is a Quicken bug may, er, really be an operator error.
Let me also mention that even if you don’t have a CPA prepare your tax 
return, you may want to find one who you can ask for help and then pay him 
or her. Even if you’re using Quicken for a small business or for real estate 
investing — something a wee bit complicated — an hour or so of personal­
ized training is often all you need to get all your questions answered.

Part VI
Appendixes

In this part . . .
I
f you’re new to Windows Vista, this part contains a lot 
of useful information, such as how to get the system up 
and running, find things you need, and get your computer 
to respond when you want it to do something.
I also include a glossary of the business, financial, and 
computer terms you see throughout the book. Throw 
around some of these terms in casual conversation, and 
everybody will think you’re an expert.

Appendix A
Quick-and-Dirty Windows Vista
I
f you’re new to Microsoft Windows Vista, you need to know a few things 
about the Vista user interface. Although this appendix doesn’t reveal any­
thing earthshaking, it does provide a quick-and-dirty overview of what you 
need to know to get around. 
If you’ve used other Windows applications, you probably don’t need to read 
this appendix because you already know the material it covers.
I won’t bore you with technical details. The information here, though, will 
enable you not only to operate Quicken but also to converse easily about the 
newest versions of Windows at cocktail parties, over lunch, or with the guy at 
the computer store.
If you want more information, you may want to read a book such as Windows 
Vista For Dummies or Windows 7 For Dummies, both by Andy Rathbone (Wiley). 
	
If you’re working with Windows XP or Windows 7, much of what this appendix 
talks about will also apply to your use of Quicken 2010. (Windows 7 was not 
yet released at the time of this writing.)
What Is Windows Vista?
Vista — and when I use the term Vista here, again, I mean any version of 
Microsoft Windows Vista — is an operating environment that manages your 
system resources (things like memory, your monitor, your printer, and so on).
Applications (programs such as Quicken) run on top of Vista. In other words, 
you first start Vista by turning on your personal computer (PC). Then, after 
Vista is running, you can start applications, such as Quicken.
Vista provides a standard graphical interface. In English, Vista provides a 
common approach for using visual elements — icons, buttons, check boxes, 
and so on. (This appendix describes how the major pieces of this graphical 
interface work.)

326
Part VI: Appendixes 
Vista enables you to run more than one application at a time. You may, for 
example, run Quicken, a tax preparation package, and even a Windows acces­
sory program, such as the Calculator.
Starting Windows Vista
Starting Vista is easy. You just turn on your personal computer (PC). If you 
can find the on-off switch, you’re set.
If you can’t find the on-off switch or it doesn’t seem to work, don’t feel silly. 
Ask someone who has used that computer. Sometimes the on-off switch is on 
the front of the computer and is labeled On-Off (which makes good sense, of 
course). Sometimes, I’m afraid, manufacturers stick the on-off switch on the 
back of the computer or label the switch something really stupid, such as 0 
and 1. Sometimes, too, people plug a computer and all its peripherals (print­
ers, modems, and all that junk) into a power strip that needs to be turned on 
to turn on the computer. So just ask someone. (If you bought the computer, 
of course, you can just telephone the place you bought it from.)
Just so you don’t feel like a complete imbecile, I have to tell you something. 
I once had to call someone to learn how to click the stupid mouse that I got 
with my laptop computer.
Figure A-1 shows a typical Vista desktop. The desktop is what you see after 
Vista starts. Other Windows desktops look similar.
Starting Programs
To start a program like Quicken, you click the Start button (the round 
Windows button in the lower-left corner of the screen) so that Vista displays 
the Start menu. Then you choose the All Programs menu option so that Vista 
lists all the programs that you, Vista, or someone else has installed. And then 
you click one of the listed programs to start that program.
Some programs — such as Quicken — don’t appear as options on the All 
Programs menu. They appear on submenus. If you click Start and then 
choose the All Programs menu, you’ll see a Quicken item, for example. 
(Pointing to some object like the Start button and then pressing the 
mouse’s left button is called clicking the object.) Choosing the Quicken 
item from the All Programs menu displays the Quicken submenu, which 
lists a bunch of different options (which depend on the version of Quicken 
you’ve installed). To start Quicken, you choose All Programs➪Quicken 
2010➪Quicken 2010 Premier.

To practice this starting business, try starting the WordPad application that 
comes with Vista by following these steps:
	
1.	Click the Start button.
	
2.	Choose All Programs➪Accessories➪WordPad.
	
	 Vista opens the WordPad program. Figure A-2 shows the WordPad 
program window. (A program window is just the window that a program 
like WordPad or Quicken displays.)

Part VI: Appendixes 
Choosing Commands from Menus
To set something in motion in Vista, you usually need to choose commands 
from menus.
I don’t know why they’re called commands. Perhaps because you often (but 
not always) use them to command Vista and applications to do things. “Hello, 
Vista? I command thee to start this application,” or “Quicken, I command 
thee to print this report.”
Most application windows have a menu bar — a row of menus across the top 
of the window. Predictably, not every menu bar contains the same menus, 
but they’re often darn similar. Some of the commands on the Quicken menus, 
for example, mirror commands on the WordPad menus.
This menu similarity isn’t some nefarious conspiracy. The common command 
sets make things easier for users.
If you choose to read the next section, don’t worry about what particular com­
mands or menus do. Just focus on the mechanics of choosing commands.
Choosing commands with 
the furry little rodent
I think that the easiest way to choose a command is to use the mouse.
A tidbit about the taskbar
At the bottom of your screen, Vista displays a 
taskbar. It provides the Start button, which I 
talk about earlier in this chapter, so that you 
can start another program. (With Vista, you 
can run several programs at the same time.) 
The taskbar also provides buttons that you can 
click to move among the programs you’re run­
ning. If you look closely at it while you’re run­
ning WordPad, for example, you see a taskbar 
button for the WordPad program. You also see 
a taskbar button for any other program you’re 
running at the same time. You probably will be 
glad to know that multitasking, which is what 
running multiple programs is called, is this easy 
to do — just click the buttons on the taskbar 
to switch from one running program to another. 
By the way, in this book, I hide the taskbar so 
it doesn’t obscure any of the Quicken program 
windows.

329
 Appendix A: Quick-and-Dirty Windows Vista
To select one of the menus by using a mouse, move the mouse pointer — the 
small arrow that moves across your screen as you physically roll the mouse 
across your desk — so that it points to the name of the menu that you want 
to select. Then click the mouse’s left button: Vista or the application program 
displays the menu. Now click the command that you want to choose.
If you inadvertently display a menu, you can deselect it (that is, make it go 
away) by clicking anywhere outside the menu box.
Choosing commands by using 
the Alt+key combinations
Another way to choose a command is to use an Alt key (cleverly labeled Alt, 
these keys are usually at either end of the spacebar):
	
1.	Press the Alt key.
	
	 Doing so tells Vista or the application that you want to choose a command.
	
2.	Press the underlined letter of the menu that you want to choose.
	
	 Doing so tells Vista or the application program which menu contains the 
command you want.
	
3.	Press the underlined letter of the command you want to choose.
	
	 Each command on a menu is usually underlined, too, so that you can 
tell the program which command you want to choose by pressing the 
underlined letter of that command. For example, if you’ve chosen the 
File menu, you can choose the last option, Exit, by pressing the letter X. 
(You can try choosing Exit if you want, but then restart WordPad so that 
you can continue to follow along, okay?)
	
Some Vista programs, Quicken included, don’t show you the underlined 
letter that chooses menus and menu commands until you press the Alt key. 
Weird, huh?
Vista and Vista applications offer yet another way to choose menu commands. 
After you press the Alt key, use the left- and right-arrow keys to highlight the 
menu that you want. Then press Enter. Vista or the Vista application displays 
the menu. Use the up- and down-arrow keys to highlight the command that you 
want to choose. Then press Enter.
For example, press Alt to activate the menu bar. Press the right-arrow key to 
highlight the Edit menu. Press Enter to display the Edit menu of commands 
(shown in Figure A-3). Press the down-arrow key seven times to highlight the 
Find command. Then press Enter.

330
Part VI: Appendixes 
	
Figure A-3: 
The 
WordPad 
Edit menu.
	
If you want to deselect a menu but still leave the menu bar activated, press 
the Esc key once. To deselect the displayed menu and, at the same time, 
deactivate the menu bar, press the Esc key twice.
Using shortcut-key combinations
For many menu commands, Vista and Vista applications offer shortcut-key 
combinations. When you press a shortcut-key combination, Vista or the Vista 
application program simultaneously activates the menu bar, chooses a menu, 
and chooses a command.
Vista (and application programs, such as WordPad and Quicken) displays 
the shortcut-key combination that you can use for a command on the menu 
beside the command.
By using one of the menu selection techniques that I describe earlier, acti­
vate the Edit menu (refer to Figure A-3). Do you see the rather cryptic codes, 
or whatever, that follow the command name? Following the Undo command, 
for example, you can just barely make out the code Ctrl+Z. And following the 
Paste command, you can see the code Ctrl+V. These are the shortcut-key 
combinations. If you simultaneously press the two or three keys listed — the 
Ctrl key and the Z key, for example — you choose the command. (Shortcut-
key combinations often use funny keys — such as Ctrl, Alt, and Shift — in 
combination with letters or numbers. If you’re not familiar with some of these 
keys’ locations, check your keyboard.)

331
 Appendix A: Quick-and-Dirty Windows Vista
Disabled commands
Oh, jeepers. I almost forgot to tell you something. Not every menu command 
makes sense in every situation. So Vista and Vista applications disable com­
mands that would be just plain kooky to choose. To show you when a com­
mand has been disabled, the program displays disabled commands in gray 
letters. In comparison, commands you can choose show up in black letters. 
Take another look at Figure A-3. Several of the commands on that menu are 
disabled. That’s why you can barely read some of their names.
Using command icons
Let me make one other point about choosing commands in the Vista environ­
ment. Vista, as the screen shots in this book show, makes your computing 
experience as visual and graphical as possible. Accordingly, if Vista or a pro­
gram designed for Vista can replace a boring old menu command with a click­
able picture or icon, that’s how it appears.
The WordPad program shown in Figures A-2 and A-3 doesn’t do this much. 
About the only clickable icons are those buttons you see in a row beneath 
the menu bar. Furthermore, Quicken doesn’t yet make fetish-like use of 
command icons. If you poke around Vista much or if you work with other 
Microsoft programs, such as Office 2007 or Office 2010, you’ll see what I 
mean. Oh, baby, will you see what I mean.
Working with Dialog Boxes
Vista (and application programs like Quicken) uses a special type of window, 
called a dialog box, to communicate with you. In fact, after you choose a com­
mand, Vista and application programs often display a dialog box to get the 
information they need to carry out the command.
Dialog boxes have these unique design elements: text boxes, check boxes, tabs, 
radio buttons (also called option buttons), command buttons, and list boxes.
Text boxes
Text boxes provide a space into which you can enter text. To see what a text 
box looks like, start WordPad (if you haven’t already), type Semper fidelis, 
and then choose Edit➪Find. WordPad, responding nicely to your deft touch, 
displays the Find dialog box (shown in Figure A-4). The text box is the box to 
the right of the words Find What.

332
Part VI: Appendixes 
	
Figure A-4: 
The Find 
dialog box.
	
If the selection cursor — the flashing line or outline that selects the active 
element of a dialog box — isn’t already in the text box, you need to move it 
there by clicking in the text box. Then type in the text. If this “active element” 
mumbo jumbo seems too technical, just press Tab a bunch of times and 
watch the dialog box. See that thing that moves around from box to button to 
box? It selects the active element.
You can move the selection cursor several ways:
	
✓	Click in the text box.
	
✓	Press Tab or Shift+Tab until the selection cursor is in the text box. 
(Pressing Tab moves the selection cursor to the next element; pressing 
Shift+Tab moves the selection cursor to the preceding element.)
	
✓	Press the Alt+key combination. For example, press Alt+N to move the 
selection cursor to the Find What text box.
If you make a typing mistake in the text box, use the Backspace key to erase 
incorrect characters. Other editing tricks are available, but I don’t describe 
them here. (After all, this chapter is just a quick-and-dirty overview of Vista.)
You also can move the insertion bar — the vertical line that shows where 
what you type gets placed — by using the left- and right-arrow keys. The left-
arrow key moves the insertion bar one character to the left without deleting 
any characters. The right-arrow key moves the insertion bar one character to 
the right without deleting any characters.

333
 Appendix A: Quick-and-Dirty Windows Vista
Check boxes
Check boxes work like on-off switches. A check box is “on” if the box is 
selected with a check mark. A check box is “off” if the box is empty. Figure 
A-4 shows the Match Case check box turned off, whereas Figure A-5 shows 
the Options dialog box with the Automatic Word Selection check box turned 
on. (WordPad displays the Options dialog box when you choose its View➪
Options command.)
	
Figure A-5: 
A dialog box 
with some 
option but-
tons and a 
check box.
	
To turn a check box on or off with the mouse, click the check box. If the 
check box is on, your click turns off the check box. If the check box is off, 
your click turns on the check box.
You also can use the spacebar to select and deselect a check box. After you 
move the selection cursor to the check box, press the spacebar to alterna­
tively select and deselect the check box. Toggle, toggle, toggle.
Which commands display dialog boxes
Seeing which menu commands display dialog 
boxes is easy: Command names that prompt 
dialog boxes are followed by ellipses, as shown 
in the Edit menu in Figure A-3, after Paste 
Special, Find, and Replace. Choosing these 
commands always opens a dialog box.

334
Part VI: Appendixes 
Tabs
You frequently see tabs in dialog boxes. Take another look at Figure A-5. See 
how the Options dialog box actually supplies several tabs of information, 
including the Options tab shown. To see another tab, you click it. For the 
Options dialog box shown in Figure A-5, for example, you can move to the 
Text tab by clicking the word Text, which marks the Text tab.
Option buttons
Option buttons (or radio buttons) are sets of buttons representing mutually 
exclusive choices. The Options dialog box, which appears when you choose 
WordPad View➪Options, uses one set of option buttons, the Measurement 
Units options buttons: Inches, Points, Centimeters, and Picas (refer to 
Figure A-5).
You can select only one option button in a set. Vista or the Vista applica­
tion identifies the selected button by putting a bullet, or darkened circle, 
inside the button. In Figure A-5, for example, the Inches option button is 
selected. The easiest way to select an option button is to click the option 
button you want.
Command buttons
Every dialog box has command buttons. Command buttons tell Vista or an 
application program what you want to do after you finish with a dialog box.
Figure A-5, for example, shows command buttons labeled OK and Cancel. If 
you use the Options dialog box to make some changes, you click OK after 
completing the rest of the dialog box. If you don’t want to use the Options 
dialog box after all, you click Cancel.
To choose a command button, either click it or move the selection cursor to 
a command button, and then press Enter.
List boxes
List boxes list a series of possible choices. To see an example of a list box in 
WordPad, for example, choose the File➪Open command. WordPad displays 
the Open dialog box (shown in Figure A-6).

335
 Appendix A: Quick-and-Dirty Windows Vista
	
Figure A-6: 
The Open 
dialog box.
	
Vista and Vista applications use two types of list boxes: a regular list box 
(which is always displayed) and a drop-down list box (which Vista won’t dis­
play until you tell it to).
Regular list boxes show you a bunch of choices, and you make your choice 
by clicking one of the items listed. The big open area shown in Figure A-6, for 
example, is a regular list box. You can select any of those things listed (files 
in this case) by clicking.
Drop-down list boxes look like text boxes with a down-arrow button at the 
right end of the box. To open a drop-down list box — such as the Files Of 
Type list box shown in Figure A-6 — click the down-arrow button. (The unla­
beled Files Of Type list box appears to the right of the File Name text box.)
After it’s opened, a drop-down list box works the same as a regular list box. 
After you select an item from the list box (by using the mouse or the arrow 
keys), press Enter.
Unfortunately, a list is sometimes too long for the list box to completely dis­
play. When this minor tragedy occurs, you can use the PgUp and PgDn keys 
to page through the list.
You also can use the scroll bar — the vertical bar with arrows at either end. 
Just drag the square scroll bar selector up or down. You also can click the 
arrows at either end of the scroll bar, or you can click the scroll bar itself. 
(This last trick moves the scroll bar selector toward the place where you 
clicked.)

336

Stopping Quicken in Vista
To stop an application program like Quicken, either click the application’s 
Close box — the button with the X in it that appears in the top-right corner of 
the application window — or choose File➪Exit.
A Yelp for Help
Help, a separate application within Vista, has powerful tools to help you learn 
about Vista and application programs, such as WordPad and Quicken. To 
access Help, select the Help menu or click the ? icon.
The Quicken 2010 Help menu (see Figure A-7) lists as many as 13 commands: 
Learn About Next Steps After Setup, Quicken Help, Current Window, Product 
And Customer Support, Quicken Live Community, Quicken Support, Submit 
Feedback On Quicken, Join The Quicken Inner Circle, About Quicken, Privacy 
Statement, Register Quicken, Unlock Again, and Add Rental Property Tools. 
Different versions of Quicken have different Help menus and supply different 
commands. For the most part, they all work pretty much in the same way. So 
in the following paragraphs, I briefly describe how each command shown in 
Figure A-7 works.
	
Figure A-7:

Help menu.
	

337
 Appendix A: Quick-and-Dirty Windows Vista
The Learn About Next Steps 
After Setup command
The Learn About Next Steps After Setup command displays windows that list 
Quicken Help topics related to getting the Quicken program set. The windows 
also provide hyperlinks you can use to find out about setting up Quicken.
The Quicken Help command
If you choose Help➪Quicken Help, the Help program displays a window 
(shown in Figure A-8) that has two tabs: Contents and Search Quicken Help.
	
Figure A-8: 
The 
Contents tab 
lists major 
Help topics.
	
If you exit Quicken the wrong way
If you exit Quicken by turning off (or resetting) 
your computer, the index file that Quicken uses 
to organize your financial records gets, well, 
wasted. Quicken rebuilds the index when you 
restart, but this process takes a few seconds.
Don’t exit Quicken (or Vista) by turning off your 
computer. Doing so may not cause serious 
problems (let me say, though, that Vista isn’t 
as forgiving as Quicken), but it is bad form — 
akin to eating the last potato chip or leaving the 
gas tank empty in your spouse’s car. You can 
read about how to safely quit Vista later in this 
chapter.

338
Part VI: Appendixes 
The Contents tab lists some of the major Help topic categories. To display 
the topics within a particular category, double-click the Help topic category. 
Help expands the list shown so that it shows the topics within each category. 
Double-click the topic to display the Help information on that topic.
You can click the Search Quicken Help tab (shown in Figure A-9) to search 
through the Help topics. To use the Search tab, enter your search words, or 
keywords, into the first text box, and then select the Help topic from the last 
list box.
	
Figure A-9: 
The Search

Help tab lets 
you search 
for Help 
topics by 
keywords.
	
The Current Window command
You can also get Help information specifically related to the active window 
(the window that appears on top of any others). To do so, either press F1 
or choose the Help➪Current Window command to start the Help program. I 
really don’t need to say any more about this command. If you have questions 
about it, just try it.
The Product And Customer 
Support command
The Product And Customer Support command displays a dialog box that 
describes the various ways that you can get help from Intuit, including the 
Quicken troubleshooting feature, Intuit’s Worldwide Web support, and fax 
support. Basically, I guess, the folks at Intuit are looking for some way to give 

339
 Appendix A: Quick-and-Dirty Windows Vista
you help but without actually having to talk to you in person. (This practice 
sounds terrible, but if you end up having to talk with someone, Intuit will 
probably spend more money paying people to talk to you than it will make 
from your purchase.)
The Quicken Live Community command
The Quicken Live Community command connects you to an Intuit-sponsored 
Quicken support forums Web site (https://qlc.intuit.com) so that you 
can discuss Quicken problems and solutions with other Quicken users.
The Quicken Support command
The Quicken Support command opens a Web page at Intuit’s product support 
Web site for Quicken. There’s lots of good information here.
The Submit Feedback On 
Quicken command
The Submit Feedback On Quicken command opens a Web page that you 
can use to submit suggestions, share comments, or report bugs. If you have 
something you need to say, this is the way you do it.
The Join The Quicken Inner 
Circle command
The Join The Quicken Inner Circle command lets you sign up with Intuit, Inc. 
to participate in customer feedback programs where you can share com­
ments with the Quicken product managers, marketers, and developers.
The About Quicken command
The About Quicken command displays a dialog box that gives the applica­
tion’s complete name, for example, Quicken 2010 Premier. To remove this 
dialog box from the screen, click OK.

340
Part VI: Appendixes 
The Privacy Statement command
This command displays information about the ways Intuit attempts to keep 
your financial data secure and about the business practices that Intuit 
employs.
The Register Quicken command
The Register Quicken command helps you start the process of registering the 
Quicken software with Intuit. Just choose the command and follow the online 
screen instructions.
The Unlock Again command
The Unlock Again command (which is also called Enter Unlock Code in some 
versions of Quicken) isn’t really a Help command. What this command does 
is walk you through the steps for accessing a more powerful version of 
Quicken, such as Quicken Premier Home & Business. (Essentially, you pay an 
unlock fee, and Intuit supplies an unlock code.)
The Add Rental Property Tools command
Figure A-7 shows a Help menu that includes an Add Rental Property Tools 
command. This command, available in the Quicken Home & Business version 
of Quicken 2010, lets the user upgrade automatically to the Rental Manager 
version of Quicken. Note that in other versions of Quicken, you might not 
see this command on the Help menu — though you might have another com­
mand in its place that lets you upgrade to some other version of Quicken.
Quitting Vista
To quit Vista, click the Start button and then the button in the lower-right 
corner of the Start menu that shows an arrowhead pointing to the right. 
When Vista displays the menu of commands related to shutting down, 
choose the Shut Down command.

Federal withholding tax) you’ve collected and remitted.
942 Payroll Tax Form: The quarterly payroll tax form that tells the IRS what 
domestic employee payroll taxes an employer has collected and remitted.
account: In Quicken, a list of the increases and decreases in an asset’s value 
or in a liability’s balance.
account balance: The value of an asset or the outstanding principal owed for 
a liability. For example, the value of a checking account is the cash value of 
the account. The balance of a mortgage liability is the principal you still owe.
account transfer: An amount you move from one account (such as a checking 
account) to another (such as a savings account).
account type: Different Quicken versions, or types, of accounts. There are 
accounts both for keeping records of the things you own (checking, saving, 
money market, cash, brokerage, IRA or Keogh, 401(k), dividend reinvestment 
plan, other investments, house, and vehicle), and for keeping records of the 
amounts you owe (credit card and liability).
Accounts bar: The list of accounts and hyperlinks that appears in a verti­
cal list along the left edge of the Quicken program window. If you click an 
account hyperlink, Quicken displays the account in a register.
accounts payable: In a business, the amounts you owe your trade creditors — 
your landlord, the office supplies store, the distributor from whom you pur­
chase your inventory, and so on. People who prefer monosyllabic speech often 
refer to accounts payable as A/P.

342
Part VI: Appendixes 
accounts receivable: In a business, the amounts your customers or clients 
owe you. People who prefer monosyllabic speech often refer to accounts 
receivable as A/R.
amortization: The itsy-bitsy principal payments you make over the course of 
repaying a loan. Eventually, these principal reductions pay off the loan.
ASCII: An acronym for the American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange. People usually use the term to refer to files — in other words, 
ASCII files — that contain just regular old text: letters, numbers, symbols 
from the keyboard, and so on.
backing up: Making a copy. If something terrible happens — fire, hard drive 
failure, thermonuclear exchange — you still have a copy on removable 
media, such as CDs, DVDs, or flash drives, safely stored away from your com­
puter, preferably offsite.
balancing an account: The steps you take to explain the difference between 
what your records show as a balance and what the bank’s records (state­
ments) show as a balance. Also referred to as reconciling an account.
bookkeeper: Someone who keeps the “books,” or financial records.
brokerage account: A Quicken account specifically set up to track a brokerage 
account that you use to invest in securities. Unlike a mutual fund account, a 
brokerage account includes a cash element. See also account type.
budget: A plan that says how you will make and spend money.
capital account: The money a sole proprietor leaves in or contributes to the 
sole proprietorship. Also, the money a partner leaves in or contributes to a 
partnership.
capital gain: What you earn by selling an investment for more than you paid. 
Capital gains (and losses) receive special treatment on your income tax 
return.
capital loss: What you lose by selling an investment for less than you paid.
category: In Quicken, how you summarize income and outgo. For example, 
you may use a category, such as Wages, to summarize your payroll check 
deposits. You may use categories (such as Housing, Food, and Fun) to sum­
marize your checks.
category list: The list of categories you can use. Quicken suggests category 
lists for home users and for business users as part of the setup.

343
 Appendix B: Glossary of Business, Financial, and Computer Terms
certified public accountant (CPA): Someone who’s taken a bunch of under­
graduate and graduate accounting courses, passed a rather challenging test, 
and worked for at least a few years under a CPA doing things like auditing, tax 
planning and preparation, and consulting. Real exciting stuff, in other words.
chart: A picture that shows numbers. In Quicken, you can produce pie charts, 
bar charts, line charts, and so on.
check date: The date you write your payment instructions, or check. 
Technically, the check date is the date on which your payment instructions 
to the bank become valid.
check form: The preprinted form that you use to provide payment instruc­
tions to your bank: “Okay, Mammoth National, pay Joe Shmoe $32 from my 
account, 00704-844.” Theoretically, you could use just about anything as a 
check form — a scrap of paper, a block of wood, and so on. In fact, rumor has 
it that someone once used a cowhide. It’s easier for your poor bank, though, 
if you use check forms that follow the usual style and provide OCR (optical 
character recognition) characters along the form’s bottom edge.
Circular E: Instructions from the IRS to employers. This publication tells 
stuff like how much federal income tax to withhold. Call the IRS and request a 
copy if you need one. Or visit the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov).
class: The old name for what Quicken now calls tags.
cleared: When a check or deposit has been received by the bank. An 
uncleared transaction hasn’t been received by the bank.
commands: What you use to tell Quicken what it should do. For example, 
“Quicken, I command thee to print a report.” Note that while you can use 
menu commands to navigate within Quicken, you can also use the buttons, 
QuickTabs, and the hyperlinks that appear within the Quicken windows. Just 
thought I’d mention this.
controller: A business’s chief accountant — and usually the brunt of most 
accountant jokes. Also known as a comptroller.
corporation: A legal business entity created by state law, owned by share­
holders, and managed by directors and officers. As a business entity, a cor­
poration has unique advantages and some disadvantages. Ask your attorney 
for more information. But know that for small businesses, a limited liability 
company (LLC) is usually better. See also LLC.
credit card account: A Quicken account specifically set up to track credit 
card charges, payments, and balances. See also account type.
deleted transaction: A transaction that Quicken has removed from the 
register.

344
Part VI: Appendixes 
disk: The thingamajig in your computer on which Windows stores your pro­
grams (such as Quicken) and your data files (such as the Quicken file for 
your financial records). A hard drive (or hard disk) inside your computer can 
store a great deal of information; removable storage devices (such as CDs, 
DVDs, and flash drives) typically store a lot less data than a hard drive.
exit: To shut down, terminate, or stop a program. By the way, you want to 
always do this the right way, which means by using the File menu’s Exit com­
mand or by clicking the program window’s Close button. Don’t just turn off 
your computer.
file: Where data is stored. Your Quicken financial records, for example, are 
stored in a set of files.
filename: The name of a file in which Quicken stores data. Actually, what 
Quicken calls a filename is actually the name used for several files. You don’t 
need to worry about this unless you create multiple files.
financial wizards: People who believe that they know so much about the 
world of finance that it is actually their God-given duty to share their exper­
tise with you. See also wizard.
Find: A tremendous bargain, as in: “At $22,000, the five-bedroom house was a 
real find.” In Quicken, also an Edit menu command that you can use to locate 
transactions. See also search criteria.
fiscal year: An accounting year. Most of the time, a fiscal year is the same as 
the calendar year, starting on January 1 and ending on December 31. Some 
businesses and foreign taxpayers use a different fiscal year, though. (Why 
they do that is way, way beyond the scope of this book.)
folder: What Windows uses to organize your hard drive. Some people call 
folders directories.
formatting: Hey, this word is too complicated for a book like this, isn’t it? Let 
me just say that formatting means doing some things to a disk so that you 
can write files to that disk. It can also mean setting up some nice typesetting 
“looks” in your printed documents.
Help: A program’s online documentation — which can almost always be 
accessed by pressing F1. Also, a verbalized cry for assistance.
hyperlink: A bit of clickable text (and sometimes a clickable picture) that 
you can use (by clicking, of course) to move to some other Quicken feature 
or some other Web page. Quicken 2010, as you may have noticed, scatters 
hyperlinks everywhere. And I mean everywhere.
index fund: What almost everybody should use for their retirement invest­
ments but almost nobody does. . . . Alas.

345
 Appendix B: Glossary of Business, Financial, and Computer Terms
internal rate of return: An investment’s profit expressed as a percentage of 
the investment. If you go down to the bank and buy a certificate of deposit 
earning 7 percent interest, for example, 7 percent is the CD’s internal rate of 
return. I don’t want to give you the heebie-jeebies, but internal rates of return 
can get really complicated really fast.
liability account: A Quicken account specifically set up for tracking loans, 
payments, the principal and interest portions of these payments, and the out­
standing balance. See also account type.
limited liability company: See LLC.
LLC: An abbreviation for limited liability company. LLCs are popular with tax 
accountants and tax attorneys because they sort of give you the best of both 
the corporation and partnership worlds. For small businesses and real estate 
investments, LLCs are nice because (compared with corporations) they offer 
both simplicity and less paperwork.
memo: A brief description of a transaction. Because you also give the payee 
and category for a transaction, it usually makes sense to use the Memo field 
to record some other bit of information about a check or deposit.
menu: In Quicken, a list of commands. In a restaurant, a list of things you can 
order from the kitchen.
menu bar: A horizontally arranged row, or bar, of menus. Yes, it does sound 
like a place where menus go for a drink after work.
missing check: A gap in the check numbers. For example, if your register 
shows a check 101 and a check 103, check 102 is a missing check.
mutual fund account: A Quicken account specifically set up to track a mutual 
fund investment.
online banking: An extra service you can buy from your bank. With online 
banking, you record a payment in your Quicken register and then transmit 
the payment information to your bank so that it can make the actual pay­
ment. Online banking also lets you electronically transfer money between 
your accounts and grab your statement electronically.
Online Bill Payment: An extra service you can buy from Intuit, the folks who 
bring you Quicken. With Online Bill Payment, you record a payment in your 
Quicken register and then transmit the payment information to Intuit’s com­
puter or your bank. Intuit or your bank then uses this information to make 
the actual payment.
online investing: Downloading transactions from many (and maybe even 
most) of the online brokerage services right into your investment accounts. If 
you’re buying and selling securities, downloading these transactions (rather 

346
Part VI: Appendixes 
than entering them by hand) saves you time. This is a particularly valuable 
feature for people who want to see how quickly they can lose everything they 
own through day trading.
partnership: A business entity that combines two or more soon-to-be-former 
friends. In general, each partner is liable for the entire debts of the partnership.
password: A word you have to give Quicken before Quicken gives you access 
to a file. The first password, “Open sesame,” was used by Ali Baba.
payee: The person to whom a check is made payable. (If you write a check to 
me, Steve Nelson, I’m the payee.) In Quicken, however, you can fill in a Payee 
field for deposits and for account transfers.
power user: Someone who’s spent far more time than is healthy fooling 
around with a computer. Power users are good people to have as friends 
because they can often solve your worst technical nightmares. However, note 
that most people who describe themselves as power users aren’t.
QIF: An abbreviation for Quicken Interchange Format. Basically, QIF is a set of 
rules that prescribes how an ASCII file must look if you want Quicken to read 
it. If you’re a clever sort, you can import category lists and even transactions 
from ASCII files that follow the QIF rules.
Quicken: The name of the checkbook-on-a-computer program that this book 
is about. You didn’t really need to look this up, did you?
Quicken.com: The Intuit Corporation Web site especially for Quicken users. 
Visit this Web site, my friend. It’s really good.
Quicken Premier: A supercharged and multimedia version of Quicken that 
includes a bunch of extra whistles and bells, including multimedia help infor­
mation, a really neat program for locating great mutual funds (called, cleverly 
enough, Mutual Fund Finder), and a Home Inventory System program. This 
book is about Quicken Premier, but Quicken Basic, Quicken Deluxe, Quicken 
Premier Home & Business, and Quicken Rental Property Manager users can 
apply this book to their products. (All the products are similar in their core 
functionality.)
Quicken Quotes: An online service that you can use to grab up-to-date price 
information on stocks and bonds. This book doesn’t talk much about Quicken 
Quotes.
QuickFill: A clever little feature. If Quicken can guess what you’ll type next in 
a field, it types, or QuickFills, the field for you. QuickFill types in transactions, 
payee names, and category names.
register: Another name for the transaction list, a register shows the increases 
and decreases in an account balance.

347
 Appendix B: Glossary of Business, Financial, and Computer Terms
report: An on-screen or printed summary of financial information from one or 
more registers.
restore: Replace the current version of a file with the backup version. 
You may need to do this after a fire, hard drive failure, or thermonuclear 
exchange. See also backing up.
savings goal accounts: A Quicken pseudo-account. In effect, a savings goal 
account is a compartment in a banking account where you can “hide” or set 
aside money that you’re saving for a special purpose. A new car. A boat. A 
trip to Montana. Whatever.
scroll bars: The vertical bars along the window’s right edge and the horizon­
tal bars along the window’s bottom edge. Use them to scroll or page through 
your view of something that’s too big to fit on one page.
search criteria: A description of the transaction that you want to locate. See 
also Find.
sole proprietorship: A business that’s owned by just one person and that 
doesn’t have a separate legal identity. In general, businesses are sole propri­
etorships, partnerships, corporations, or limited liability companies.
split transactions: A transaction assigned to more than one category or 
transferred to more than one account. A split-check transaction, for example, 
might show a $50 check to the convenience store paying for both groceries 
and automobile expenses.
stockholder equity: The money that shareholders have contributed to a 
corporation or allowed to be retained in the corporation. You can’t track 
stockholders’ equity with Quicken.
subcategory: A category within a category. For example, the suggested 
Quicken home categories list breaks down utilities spending into Cable TV, 
Gas and Electric, Telephone, and Water subcategories.
supercategory: A group of categories that you monitor as a group. You create 
supercategories so that you can monitor them.
tabs: The clickable labels that look like file folder tabs and appear near the 
top of the Quicken program window underneath the menu bar and icon bar.
tag: Tags (or classes) amount to another way to summarize Quicken data 
when categories just aren’t enough. This book doesn’t really talk about tags 
much. Sorry.
tax deduction: For an individual, an amount that can be deducted from total 
income (such as alimony or IRA contributions) or used as an itemized deduc­
tion and deducted from adjusted gross income (such as home mortgage 

348
Part VI: Appendixes 
interest or charitable contributions). For a business, any amount that repre­
sents an ordinary and necessary business expense. Be sure to consult with 
your tax advisor if you have any questions about what is or isn’t a valid tax 
deduction.
tax-deferred account: Some accounts aren’t taxable — IRAs, for one example, 
and 401(k) plans for another. To deal with this real-life complexity, Quicken 
lets you tag any account as being tax-deferred. As a practical matter, how­
ever, it’ll probably be only investment accounts and the occasional bank 
account that are tax-deferred.
technogeek: Someone who believes that fooling around with a computer is 
more fun than anything else in the world.
transaction list: The list of increases and decreases in an account balance. 
Quicken displays a transaction list in a window that looks remarkably similar 
to a crummy old paper register — your checkbook. To print a copy of the reg­
ister that you see on your screen, press Ctrl+P and then press the Enter key.
transposition: Flip-flopped numbers — for example, 23.45 entered as 24.35 
(the 3 and 4 are flip-flopped as 4 and 3). These common little mistakes have 
caused many bookkeepers and accountants to go insane.
Vista: The current version (as of the date I’m writing this book) of the 
Microsoft Windows operating system. See also Windows.
W-2: The annual wages statement that employers use to tell employees what 
they made and to tell the IRS what employees made.
W-3: A summary form of W-2s. When employers send a stack of W-2s to the 
IRS, they also fill out a W-3 form that summarizes all the individual W-2s. W-2s 
and W-3s aren’t much fun, but they’re not hard to fill out.
Windows: The Microsoft Windows operating system. Quicken 2010 for 
Windows relies on Windows to do a bunch of system stuff, such as print. 
Refer to Appendix A for more information.
Windows 7: The newest edition of Windows; available October 2010.
wizard: A little program that walks you through the steps to completing 
some tasks that some programmer thinks you’re too dense to figure out on 
your own. Although a wizard sounds bad, it actually isn’t. Quicken supplies a 
bunch of cool wizards, including wizards for setting up accounts and setting 
up how you want to record a paycheck, planning for retirement, planning for 
your kid’s college expenses, reducing your debts, and so on.
