About the Author
Laura Miller is a freelance writer based in Buffalo, New York,
though she’s spent countless hours scouring Central Florida’s
theme parks over the years — both with and without her husband
and five kids. A family-travel expert who religiously makes an
annual pilgrimage to the Land the Mouse Built, she’s the author of
Frommer’s Walt Disney World & Orlando 2005 and contributes to
Frommer’s Florida and Frommer’s Walt Disney World & Orlando with
Kids. She’s currently researching and writing a guide to Florida for
families.

Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies 2006

Introduction
W
elcome to Walt Disney World and Orlando, Florida, a land ruled
by a mouse who thinks nothing of sporting bright red shorts,
gigantic white gloves, and big yellow shoes — a place that’s for some,
including the young and young-at-heart, absolutely magical. Walt Disney
World has continued to evolve, bringing back its faithful followers, and
enticing future fans. Though showing the wear and tear of a weakened
economy, Walt Disney World has remained resilient; it continues to add
attractions throughout its parks and regularly announces plans for
future projects. Millions of people make the pilgrimage each year — a
group that includes Olympic medal-winners, a prince or two, and of
course us regular folks. To some, WDW is a national shrine, to others,
a right of passage, albeit a crowded one.
For some folks, charting a successful course through the home of Mickey
Mouse can seem like a lot of work. For you, it won’t be. All you need to
ensure an enjoyable trip to Orlando is patience, planning, and a little
childlike wonder — now how hard is that?
About This Book
Pay full price? Read the fine print? Do it their way?
Excuse me. There’s no need for any of that.
You picked this book because you know the For Dummies label, and you
want to go to Walt Disney World. You also probably know how much
you want to spend, the pace you want to keep, and the amount of plan-
ning you can handle. You may not want to tend to every little detail, yet
you don’t trust just anyone to make your plans for you.
In this book, I boil down what has become a world unto itself — Walt
Disney World — and the surrounding Orlando area. Walt Disney’s
Florida legacy is still growing a full four decades after his death in 1966.
At current count, WDW includes four theme parks and a dozen lesser
attractions, two entertainment districts, tens of thousands of hotel
rooms, scores of restaurants, and twin cruise ships.
Universal Orlando and SeaWorld add another four theme parks, three
resorts, and an entertainment district to the mix. There are 80 or so
additional smaller attractions nearby, as well as an avalanche of restau-
rants and more than 114,000 lodging rooms in Orlando.
How can anyone sort through all these choices, you ask? It takes 
experience.

After decades of stomping through the House of the Mouse, I know where
to find the best deals (deals that are not rip-offs). In this book, I guide you
through Walt Disney World and Orlando in a clear, easy-to-understand
way, so you can find the best hotels, restaurants, and attractions with-
out having to read this book like a novel — cover to cover. Although you
can read this book in that order if you choose, you can also flip to only
those sections that interest you. I also promise not to overwhelm you
with choices. I simply deliver the best, most essential ingredients for a
great vacation.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this disclaimer is especially true of prices (the theme parks
like to raise theirs on a whim). I, therefore, suggest that you call ahead
for confirmation or check the Internet when making your travel plans.
Doing so is especially important when you have your heart set on visit-
ing a particular attraction because theme parks are constantly making
changes to their lineups, including shortening hours, closing shows on
certain days, and boarding up restaurants in poor economic times. 
The author, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the
experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us,
however, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite
targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book an easier reference guide for you, I use some handy
abbreviations when I review hotels, restaurants, and attractions.
You’ll probably notice first that I often substitute WDW or Disney World
for Walt Disney World to spare you from having to read those three
words again and again. Another common abbreviation that you’ll find is
the use of Universal in place of Universal Orlando. Also, because almost
everything in Orlando revolves around its theme parks, you often find
that I refer to the section of Central Florida that encompasses the theme
parks as simply “the parks.”
Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies 2006

Dummies Post-it
® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it
® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

And because Orlando does its best to make you max them out, I use the
following abbreviations for commonly accepted credit cards:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I also include general pricing information to help you decide where to
unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I use a system of dollar
signs to show a range of costs for one night in a double-occupancy room
or a meal at a restaurant. 
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs might be as a traveler. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Orlando and wants expert advice on how to maximize your
time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Walt Disney World and
Orlando and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Orlando or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction
available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on
the places that will give you the best experience in Orlando.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Walt Disney World & Orlando For
Dummies 2006 gives you the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies 2006 is divided into seven
parts. The chapters in each part lay out the specifics within each sec-
tion’s topic. Likewise, each chapter is written so that you don’t have to
read what came before or after, although I sometimes refer you to other
areas for more information.
Here’s a brief look at the parts.
Introduction 3

Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando
Think of this part as the hors d’oeuvres. In this part, I tempt you with
the best experiences, hotels, eateries, and attractions at Disney and
the rest of Orlando. I give you a little history lesson (but not to worry —
no quiz will follow), suggest a few movies and books to get you in the
Mickey mood, and then tip you to Orlando’s best special events. Because
the city has some pretty distinct seasons, I also delve into the pros and
cons of visiting during different times of the year and even throw in a
weather forecast.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World
& Orlando
This part covers the nitty-gritty of trip planning. Orlando has been known
to take a chunk of change out of unsuspecting visitors’ wallets, so I sug-
gest some ways to save money so you don’t feel like you have to take out
a second mortgage to do this trip. I delve into the various ways to get
here and give you the lowdown on vacation package options; they’re a
very popular method of traveling to Orlando — and there are a whole lot
of them out there. And because I’d like everyone to have fun on their
vacation, I also provide special tips for those who could use some more
specialized trip information: families, seniors, travelers with disabilities,
and gay and lesbian travelers.
Part III: Settling into Orlando
After I get you to Orlando, I introduce you to the neighborhoods and
explore some of the modus transporto (local buses, trolleys, taxis, shut-
tles, and other vehicles to get from hither to yonder). I also give you the
lowdown on Disney’s special transportation system. From there, it’s on
to a discussion of the city’s plethora of accommodation options and in-
depth reviews of the best places to sleep. And because it takes lots of
fuel to keep you going inside the theme parks, I discuss the city’s best
places to eat and tell you all about that most Orlando of dining experi-
ences: the character meal. (Because what says Disney more than having
dinner with Donald Duck and Goofy? Or Cinderella? Or Simba? Well, you
get the idea.)
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World
You’re now checked in and fueled up. Great. Welcome to Walt Disney
World, the number one tourist destination in the country. You could
easily spend months exploring this mammoth resort, but if you’re like
most visitors to the House of Mouse, you have only a week or less to get
it all in. No worries. In this part, I explain Disney’s ticket system and tell
you about the best options in each of Disney’s major parks. And if you
don’t think a visit to WDW would be complete without a set of Mickey
ears or some other souvenir, I also fill you in on Disney’s best shopping
opportunities.

Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando
Can’t face all Mickey, all the time? No problem. There is, in fact, a lot
more to Orlando than Disney World. If theme parks are your thing,
Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, and Discovery Cove all await you, and I
fill you in on all their highlights. The city is also home to a plethora of
smaller attractions and rides, and I provide in-depth information on the
best of them. Should you prefer exercising your credit card to walking
the parks, I let you know the best places for shopaholics to indulge.
And if you need a break from the city itself, I give you two great day-trip
options. One thing is for certain: You won’t get bored.
Part VI: Living It Up after Dark: Orlando Nightlife
Kids may rule this town, but Disney and the rest of Orlando have discov-
ered that many of you want to party into the night. In Part VI, I explore
Pleasure Island, CityWalk, and other thriving Orlando hot spots. Then
I give you details on Orlando’s popular dinner shows and the city’s per-
forming arts. (Yes, Orlando does indeed have a respected cultural scene.)
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book offers The Part of Tens. Finding this part in
a For Dummies book is as certain as annual price hikes at Disney and
Universal. In Part VII, I give you parting knowledge about cheap attrac-
tions and places to stay fit as a fiddle.
You also find two other elements near the back of this book. I have
included an Appendix — your Quick Concierge — containing plenty of
handy information you may need when traveling in Orlando, such as
phone numbers and addresses of emergency personnel or area hospitals
and pharmacies, contact information for baby sitters, lists of local news-
papers and magazines, protocol for sending mail or finding taxis, and
more. Check out this Appendix when searching for answers to the many
little questions that may come up as you travel. 
Should you desire even more detailed or specialized information, I also
include a list of the best sources of Orlando and Disney information,
from official tourist offices to Web sites to newspapers and magazines. 
You can easily find the Quick Concierge because it’s printed on yellow
paper.
Icons Used in This Book
You find six icons throughout this guide:
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips or great deals.
Introduction 5

Best of the Best highlights the best Orlando has to offer in all
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping,
and nightlife. 
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Because many of you will be toting kids when you visit Orlando, I decided
to get some kids’ input (namely, my five children, ages 4 to 12) on many
of the popular rides and attractions in the city. This icon indicates a high
approval rating.
This icon obviously indicates a low approval rating. Kids are kids and
this rating may have been given for any number of unfathomable rea-
sons. I’m just passing along my raw data.
Where to Go from Here
I’ve briefed you on what to expect from this book and told you how to
use it to plan a magical vacation to Walt Disney World — no pixie dust
necessary. So start reading; you have a lot to do before you arrive, from
arranging a place where you’ll rest your weary feet each night to explor-
ing the best that Orlando’s theme parks have to offer. Like the Boy
Scouts’ creed, the successful Orlando traveler needs to “be prepared;”
follow the advice in this book, and you will be. So put on your Mouse
ears and smile — you’re going to Disney World!

acationing in Orlando is like escaping to another time and place, a
world of fantasy, a world filled with fun. The city attracts the young
and the young at heart from all over the world who come for the theme
parks, world-class resorts, and the area’s spectacular natural beauty.
It should come as no surprise to you that Orlando is the No. 1 family
vacation destination in the United States, not to mention one of the
top vacation destinations in the world. Yes, it gets crowded, and in the
summer it’s hot and sticky, but one thing you definitely won’t be is bored.
Note: With the exception of the items listed in “The Best Orlando
Experiences,” I’ve highlighted all of the hotels, restaurants, and attrac-
tions in this chapter with a “Best of the Best” icon throughout the book.
Without further delay, here are the best of the best that Orlando and
Walt Disney World have to offer.
The Best Orlando Experiences
If images of Cinderella Castle, its spires reaching high up to the sky, pop
into your head the minute anyone mentions Orlando, you’re not alone.
The Magic Kingdom’s iconic castle and the lovable Mouse who started it
all are, by far, the most famous of all Disney icons and the reason most

folks venture to the sunshine state in the first place. But keep in mind
that while a visit to the Magic Kingdom is definitely one of the biggest
highlights of an Orlando vacation, especially if you have kids, there are
plenty more attractions and experiences that await:
 Spend a day at Epcot. At Epcot, you can find the high-speed thrills
of Mission: Space and Test Track, the breathtaking experience of
Soarin’ over the California landscape, and the simple pleasure of
splashing about in the dancing waters. Then it’s off to tour some
of the world’s most unique countries along the World Showcase.
Play on the Viking ship in Norway, dance with the oompah band
in Germany, or try to belly dance with the natives in Morocco. For
more on things to do at Epcot, see Chapter 13.
 Spend another day at Disney’s Animal Kingdom. Head out on the
Kilimanjaro Safari for an expedition through the African savanna, or
make your way by foot through the rainforests and jungles of Asia
for a glimpse of the exotic wildlife that inhabits the park. Travel
back to the time when dinosaurs ruled the Earth. Be sure to catch
Mickey’s Jammin’ Jungle parade, one of the most unique and lively
parades in all of Disney. Kali River Rapids will leave you soaked, but
that’s half the fun. Check out Chapter 15 for details on other attrac-
tions in the park.
 Visit Disney–MGM Studios. You can find some of the most intense
thrills in all of Walt Disney World here, with both the Tower of Terror
and Rock ’n Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith taking center stage.
But be sure to take in some of the spectacular shows, too — this is
a studio after all. Top billing goes to Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme
Stunt Show, the parks newest addition, and the Indiana Jones Stunt
Spectacular. Be sure to close out the night with the incredible
Fantasmic!, an after-dark show that combines a love for all things
Disney with the most amazing combination of water and fireworks.
See Chapter 14 for the lowdown on all the park has to offer.
 Experience Universal Studios Florida (USF). Once just a diversion,
Universal has worked hard to turn itself into a true destination. The
rides here run the gamut from all ages to “what was I thinking?” Not-
to-be-missed attractions include Revenge of the Mummy, Terminator
2: 3-D Battle Across Time, Men in Black: Alien Attack, and the most
recent additions: Fear Factor Live and Shrek 4-D. Really feeling adven-
turous? Finish the day by getting slimed at Nick Studios. Chapter 18
offers information on other cool things to see and do at USF.
 Test your physical limits at Islands of Adventure. You can spin; you
can fly upside down; you can get wet. And that’s just in the first few
hours in this park. Don’t miss the Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man;
Dueling Dragons twin roller coasters; Jurassic Park: River Adventure;
and the big, green behemoth, the Incredible Hulk roller coaster. If it’s
really hot out, a good soak on Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges is
just the thing to refresh you. For information on other adventures
awaiting you in the park, see Chapter 19.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
12

 Find your own waterworld at SeaWorld and Discovery Cove.
There are a few thrill rides at SeaWorld, namely Journey To Atlantis,
Kraken, and Wild Arctic, but the real reason to come to both of
these parks is the chance to interact with a variety of marine ani-
mals. Discovery Cove even gives you the chance to swim with a
dolphin. It’s a bit pricy, but it’s well worth it if you love animals.
For more information on both parks, see Chapter 20.
 Watch an evening park performance. Many of the parks love to
close out their day with a fireworks display or performance that’s
guaranteed to impress. So check out the Magic Kingdom’s Wishes
or SpectroMagic, Epcot’s Illuminations, Disney–MGM’s Fantasmic!,
or SeaWorld’s Oddyssea. For a truly magical performance, see
Cirque du Soleil’s La Nouba; it’s expensive, but also unforgettable.
For information on all of these spectacles, see Chapters 12, 13, 14,
20, and 25.
 Go to Gatorland. An Orlando original, Gatorland has been astound-
ing visitors with its crocodiles and alligators since long before the
mouse moved in. Take in one of the amazing shows, such as Gator
Wrestlin’ and Gator Jumparoo, or just take a leisurely stroll through
swamp and marsh on the boardwalks — no one’s in a hurry here.
For more information on Gatorland, see Chapter 21.
The Best Hotels 
One of the cool things about a trip to Orlando is the chance to stay at one
of its great resorts or themed hotels. Check out Chapter 9 for more in-
depth information about all the accommodations listed in this section:
 Best for Families: Both Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge and
Wilderness Lodge offer rooms with bunk beds. Nearby Lake Buena
Vista is where you can find the Nickelodeon Kids Suites Hotel, a
first for the Nick brand, as well as the Holiday Inn Sunspree, which
features Kid Suites (which offer separate themed sleeping areas
with bunk beds for kids).
 Best Inexpensive Hotels: If your budget determines where you stay,
you have several good choices that offer basic amenities in conven-
ient locations for a low price. On Disney property, choose the new
Pop Century Resort, which offers themed motel-style rooms for the
lowest prices in Mickeyville. The Masters Inn Maingate offers a good
location and moderate amenities for less than $50 a night, as does
the Microtel Inn and Suites.
 Best Moderate Hotels: Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort edges
out the other two WDW moderate resorts with slightly larger rooms
and a cool Mayan temple pool. 
 Best for a Romantic Getaway: The Portofino Bay Resort at
Universal is molto romantic with its quaint Italian village theme.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Walt Disney World & Orlando 13

If money is no object, sweep your significant other off to a getaway at
the lushly tropical Ritz-Carlton, Grande Lakes or the Mediterranean-
inspired Villas of Grand Cypress.
 Best Hotel for Business Travelers: The Orlando World Center
Marriott in Lake Buena Vista and the Peabody Orlando both offer
an extensive array of business services and amenities.
 Best Location: All three Universal Orlando resorts are within walk-
ing distance of Universal’s parks and CityWalk, and all offer boat
transportation to the theme parks as well. But if I had to choose the
best of the bunch for location and value, I like the Royal Pacific
Resort best. At WDW, Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa
offers the best accommodations in the World and is right on the
monorail. For those who must be in the thick of it all, Disney’s
Yacht Club and Beach Club (both close to Epcot) also get my vote.
 Best Pools: The Hard Rock Hotel boasts a sandy beach and an
underwater sound-system that brings out the lounging rock star
in you. Stormalong Bay is the name given to the 3-acre mini water
park that calls itself a pool at Disney’s Yacht and Beach Club
Resorts. Away from the theme parks, the Hyatt Regency Grand
Cypress Resort has an amazing lagoonlike pool that sports rock
grottoes and 12 waterfalls.
The Best Restaurants
Fast food may rule in Orlando, but the city doesn’t lack good places to
dine. You can find more in-depth information about all of these restau-
rants in Chapter 10:
 Best for Kids: It’s hard to go wrong with any of the Walt Disney
World character breakfasts. Kids also seem to love the noisy
jungle-themed Rainforest Café (locations at Downtown Disney
and Animal Kingdom).
 Best Seafood: Todd English’s Blue Zoo (inside the Dolphin) is 
a relative newcomer on the scene, but is already drawing raves.
Fulton’s Crab House at Pleasure Island is a longstanding favorite
with a great wine list and a creative menu.
 Best Steakhouse: The highly regarded Yachtsman Steakhouse at
Disney’s Yacht Club offers wood-fire grilled steaks.
 Best Dining with a View: This one’s a toss-up between Manuel’s
on the 28th, which offers a stunning after-dark view of the city and
food to match, and Arthur’s 27, which boasts spectacular views of
Disney’s fireworks and a winning wine list.
 Best Buffet: Boma, inside Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge, offers
the most eclectic buffet menu in Orlando, mingling traditional
buffet items with exotic African fare.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
14

 Best Margarita: Head to Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville, of course.
The mango margarita’s the best of the bunch.
 Best Spot for a Romantic Meal: Victoria & Albert’s is the runaway
leader in this category. 
 Best Value: Kim Wu has been a local favorite for over 20 years.
Café Tu Tu Tango offers inexpensive tapas dishes, ranging from
Cajun egg rolls with blackened chicken to alligator bites that are
perfect for sharing.
The Best Thrill Rides
If you’re a speed freak who lives for the ups and downs of a good ride,
here are the top stomach churners and G-force generators in Orlando:
 Mission: Space (Epcot): Disney’s latest contribution to the thrills
category uses NASA technology to create an astronaut simulator so
effective they’ve had to install “lunch bags” for all the motion sick-
ness it causes. See Chapter 13.
 Rock ’n Roller Coaster (Disney–MGM Studios): You launch from
0 to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and go right into the first inversion
as 120 speakers in your “stretch limo” mainline Aerosmith at
(yeeeow!) 32,000 watts right into your ears. See Chapter 14.
 Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (Disney–MGM Studios): The free-
fall experiences (there are several possible scenarios) are more
than thrilling — they’re scary. After your legs stop shaking, some
of you may want to ride again. See Chapter 14.
 Summit Plummet (Disney’s Blizzard Beach): This one starts slow,
with a lift ride (even in Florida’s 100° dog days) to a 120-foot moun-
tain summit. But it finishes with the world’s fastest body slide, a test
of your courage and swimsuit as it virtually goes straight down and
has you moving sans vehicle at 60 mph by the end. See Chapter 16.
 Revenge of the Mummy (Universal Studios Florida): Universal’s
newest thrill ride combines a coaster run with magnetism and the
best cinematic special-effects technology (flame ceilings, scarabs
pouring out of the walls) for a ride that touches on your worst pho-
bias. See Chapter 18.
 The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man (Islands of Adventure):
3-D doesn’t get any better than this chase-the-bad-guys ride where
you twist, spin, and soar before a simulated 400-foot drop that feels
an awful lot like the real thing. It’s sure to get your Spidey senses
tingling. See Chapter 19.
 Dueling Dragons (Islands of Adventure): Your legs dangle as you
do five inversions at 55 to 60 mph and — get this! — three times
come within 12 inches of the other roller coaster. See Chapter 19.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Walt Disney World & Orlando 15

 Incredible Hulk Coaster (Islands of Adventure): You blast from
0 to 40 mph in two seconds, spin upside down more than 100 feet
from the ground, and execute seven rollovers and two deep drops
on this glow-in-the-dark roller coaster. You may find this hard to
believe, but it’s the smoothest ride around. See Chapter 19.
 Jurassic Park River Adventure (Islands of Adventure): Riders
travel through a prehistoric land inhabited by fierce, unbelievably
real-looking dinosaurs. Creatures five stories tall growl and bare
their teeth, some within inches of your face. As if that weren’t
enough, after being threatened by a Tyrannosaurus rex, you plunge
85 feet almost straight down into the water below. See Chapter 19.
 Kraken (SeaWorld): This floorless, open-sided coaster uses speed
(up to 65 mph), steep climbs, deep drops, and seven loops to
create a stomach-churning ride that lasts far too long for some
folks. See Chapter 20.
The Best of the Rest
For those who can’t stomach the thought of boarding anything that pulls
the same G-forces as a fighter jet or induces adrenaline rushes of any sort
of magnitude, the theme parks have several exceptional (and tamer) rides
and shows that nobody should overlook:
 Haunted Mansion (Magic Kingdom): Forget the unfortunate Eddie
Murphy film and be sure to visit this cult favorite, which shows off
Disney’s knack for details as 999 ghosts offer up more delights than
frights. See Chapter 12.
 Pirates of the Caribbean (Magic Kingdom): This one’s another
oldie but goodie, made even more popular by the Oscar-nominated
film of the same name. You’ve got randy, rum-filled pirates and lots
of yo-ho-ho music. See Chapter 12.
 Test Track (Epcot): Fasten your seatbelts. This collaboration
with GM allows riders to take a “car” through a series of standard
motor vehicle test sequences that include a near crash, a speed
run, and some rather interesting weather. It’s not adrenaline pump-
ing enough to be considered a thriller, but it’s definitely a cool ride.
See Chapter 13.
 Soarin’ (Epcot): Soarin’ is the latest ride to debut at Epcot. After
boarding the multiseat gliders, you’ll find yourself flying high over
some of California’s most spectacular landscapes with realistic 
multisensory effects. See Chapter 13.
 Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular (Disney–MGM Studios):
Special effects, razzle-dazzle stunts, and pyrotechnics make this stunt
show worth the (incredibly long) wait. Wear a bright-colored shirt,
wave your arms spastically, and you may be called up on stage as
an extra. See Chapter 14.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
16

 Lights, Motors, Action! Stunt Spectacular (Disney–MGM Studios):
The thrill of a high-speed car chase, pyrotechnics, special effects,
and some amazing stunt driving add up to an action-packed show
for the whole family. See Chapter 14.
 Jim Henson’s Muppet*Vision 3-D (Disney–MGM Studios): The
action takes place in a perfect recreation of the Muppets’ theater
(complete with the blessedly crotchety Statler and Waldorf cri-
tiquing the action from the balcony) and is a zany mix of 3-D film,
animatronics, and live-action and special effects. See Chapter 14.
 Festival of the Lion King (Animal Kingdom): One of the best
shows in town, this is a don’t-miss Broadway-esque version of the
famous Circle of Life. See Chapter 15.
 Kilimanjaro Safaris (Animal Kingdom): At this must-see attrac-
tion, the special safari trucks bump you about as you head out into
Disney’s version of the African wilderness. You’ll enjoy the thrill of
seeing giraffes and zebras up close. See Chapter 15.
 Men in Black Alien Attack (Universal Studios Florida): Zap icky
aliens with ray guns as you ride through the streets of New York. At
the conclusion, you tackle the Big Roach himself and then get rated
by Will Smith for your shooting prowess. See Chapter 18.
 Shrek 4-D (Universal Studios Florida): This attraction uses 3-D
movie effects married with seats that move and bounce to continue
the story of Shrek and Fiona. It’s fun for all ages and very popular!
See Chapter 18.
 Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time (Universal Studios Florida):
This production features the creepy-steely T-1,000,000 and live-
action doubles of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong, who
roar onto the stage on Harleys and then into a giant movie screen, a
very cool trick you absolutely must see. This show’s an absolute
winner. See Chapter 18.
 Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges (Islands of Adventure): A bit
too tame to be considered a thrill ride, this white-water raft experi-
ence can have you soaked in no time at all. If the waves don’t get
you, the kids firing water soakers at you from the sidelines won’t
miss. See Chapter 19.
 Shamu Adventure (SeaWorld): Even if you’ve seen the show
before — and they change it regularly, to keep things interesting —
you still “ooh” and “ahh” as the sleek, black-and-white killer whale
shoots out of the water. See Chapter 20.
 Shark Encounter (SeaWorld): At this aquatic exhibit, you find a
walk-through tunnel populated with the scarier denizens of the
deep, such as moray eels, barracudas, rays, scorpion fish, and (of
course) sharks. It’s the coolest aquarium in town. See Chapter 20.

 Mastering the local lingo

T
his chapter offers a bit of perspective into how Orlando evolved
from a sleepy little southern town to the theme park capital of
the world. After our quick trip back in time, I give you an overview of
Florida’s cuisine scene and then offer a tutorial on the local lingo. For
those of you who want even more background on Orlando and WDW,
I wrap up this chapter by recommending some books and films.
History 101: The Main Events
Believe it or not, there was life in Orlando before Mickey. The city’s
transformation into theme-park mecca didn’t happen overnight. And
it may never have happened if Walt Disney hadn’t run out of real estate
in California.
Orlando B.D. (Before Disney)
Before there was Disney, Universal, SeaWorld and the wealth of other
tourist attractions that exist today, Central Florida was ruled by the 
economics of the three “C” industries: cotton, cattle, and citrus.
Originally named Jernigan, the town now known as Orlando had its gene-
sis in the remnants of an Army post that was abandoned in 1849. The
name was officially changed to Orlando in 1857, though the origin of the
moniker is somewhat opaque. (Depending on whom you ask, the city
was named for a plantation owner, the friend of a city commissioner, or
a character from Shakespeare’s As You Like It.) The cattle and cotton
industries thrived here until the Civil War, when area homesteaders real-
ized that citrus trees were far easier to grow than cotton and just about

every field was taken over by lush orange groves. At its peak, in the
1950s, more than 80,000 acres of citrus trees were thriving throughout
Central Florida. The ’50s also saw two major developments that would
bring even more people and industry to the area: the building of the
space center at nearby Cape Canaveral and (most important of all) the
invention of air-conditioning.
Around this time, Walt Disney began making waves by opening Disneyland
in Anaheim, California. The doors officially opened July 17, 1955, and it
was an instant hit. Soon, the overwhelming demand made it obvious to
Walt that he needed to expand. However, his 27 acres in the middle of the
city didn’t exactly give him the room for his next endeavor. So he turned
his eyes eastward to Florida.
Orlando A.D. (After Disney)
In a top-secret operation that would have impressed even the CIA, Walt
Disney began a search for the site of his next theme park, and, having
decided on his new location, began secretly buying up land through
dummy corporations. On November 11, 1965 (the city’s version of
“D” Day) — after Disney had acquired more than 28,000 acres for a
mere $5.5 million — he came clean and announced that a new Disney
theme park would be built in Orlando, Florida. Unfortunately Walt never
got to see his dream become a reality. He passed away the morning of
December 15, 1966, a mere year after his plans were unveiled. His brother,
Roy O. Disney, decided the right thing to do was to carry on in Walt’s name.
Construction began on the Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12) and its first
two resorts in 1969. On a fine fall day, October 1, 1971, Roy O. Disney led
the dedication ceremony that officially opened the Walt Disney World
Resort to the public.
SeaWorld (see Chapter 20) splashed onto the scene soon after, when it
opened to the public in December 15, 1973. And it seemed, for a while,
that its opening would be it on Orlando’s expansion front. But Disney
continued to break attendance records each year and, not content to
rest on its laurels — or its acres of empty land — the Walt Disney World
Resort continued expanding. In 1982, 11 years after Magic Kingdom
opened, Epcot (see Chapter 13) was christened the second WDW theme
park. In 1989, the Disney–MGM Studios (see Chapter 14), a behind-the-
scenes look at Tinseltown, became the third jewel in the WDW park
crown. At the same time, WDW added Typhoon Lagoon (a 56-acre water
theme park; see Chapter 16), and Pleasure Island (a nightclub district
for adults; see Chapter 25).
A year later, Universal Studios Florida (see Chapter 18) brought the
world of movies to life in Orlando, opening its doors in 1990. Direct com-
petition spurred Disney to create its fourth, and currently, last, theme
park in Orlando. A cross between conservation park and theme park,
Animal Kingdom (see Chapter 15) opened its doors on Earth Day,
April 22, 1998. Universal immediately countered with CityWalk, a vast
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Orlando 19

nighttime entertainment district (see Chapter 25). Not to be outdone,
Disney stormed back by consolidating its three major after-park-hours
entertainment, dining, and shopping venues — Disney’s West Side,
Pleasure Island, and the Disney Village Marketplace — into an all-
encompassing zone called Downtown Disney. The Disney folks also
started their own cruise line for good measure.
Universal didn’t follow out to sea, but it upped the ante when it opened
its second park in 1999. Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19) was all
about the thrills of the theme-park experience. Islands, when combined
with CityWalk, USF, and several on-property resorts, helped Universal
complete its transformation into the resort destination of Universal
Orlando, as it’s now known. Not just a day trip, anymore, Universal now
offers the total vacation experience, just as Disney does.
The most recent theme-park addition to the Orlando roster came unex-
pectedly from SeaWorld. They decided to keep doing what they do best
and opened Discovery Cove (see Chapter 20) in 2000. More than just a
theme park, this is an all-inclusive interactive marine experience, offering
snorkeling and dolphin swims. Even more surprising, SeaWorld added its
first roller coaster, the unquestionably thrilling Kraken.
Things have died down a bit in the expansion department, but the theme
parks are hardly sitting still, constantly revising and building new attrac-
tions. Orlando currently offers more than 95 attractions, 114,000 hotel
rooms, and 5,100 restaurants, as well as the second largest convention
center in the nation. The city is showing signs of an improved economy,
and the travel landscape has recently begun to see the numbers reflected
in visitor turnout as it once again is reaching sky-high levels. Tourism, of
course, has become the leading industry for Central Florida with more
than 43 million visitors annually and an economic impact of $24.9 billion.
And it all started because of a mouse named Mickey.
Taste of Orlando: Local Cuisine
Offerings have improved in recent years as the city has opened a fair
share of good restaurants, but the Orlando dining scene can’t compete
with the likes of foodie cities like San Francisco or New York. And if
there’s a predominant cuisine, it’s one of the fast-food variety, with the
many casual eateries, a few steps higher on the food chain, coming in a
very close second. The biggest decision most theme-park goers have to
make is whether to opt for a burger, a taco, or a hot dog along with the
ubiquitous french fries. And don’t worry about finding a branch of your
favorite chain, should the urge strike you; the odds are that you can find
not just one, but several outlets of it within reach of your hotel.
Though the city caters to a rich and diverse clientele, don’t expect to find
an equitable number of ethnic eateries. The most famous spots in town
for ethnic cuisine are Epcot’s World Showcase restaurants. Although
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
20

theme-park food is not exactly first-class, some of it can be surprisingly
good. On the healthy front, you will find plenty of fresh fruit — Orlando
is still a major citrus town. And even the theme parks now offer a few
healthier and vegetarian options beyond the usual fast food.
The biggest news on the city’s dining front over the last five years has
been the increasing number of gourmet spots for finicky foodies. Famous
culinary magicians, such as Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd
English, have all opened restaurants here. A few first-class steakhouses
will please carnivores. And Universal has stepped up theme-park dining
a few notches with the addition of their Islands of Adventure eateries.
Something you can’t find, however, is a bevy of high-class seafood restau-
rants; landlocked Orlando isn’t nearly as stuck on seafood as most other
cities, especially the way those along the coastlines are. If you must have
that lobster, however, a list of a few noteworthy spots, along with all my
other best picks for dining, can be found in Chapter 10.
Given the importance the city places on entertainment value, it probably
shouldn’t surprise you that Orlando’s most famous dining experience —
the Character Meal — doesn’t really revolve around the cuisine. The
name says it all: You and the kids get to chow down on buffet food with
Mickey or Goofy, SpongeBob Squarepants, or even Shamu. The fare at
these ubiquitous events, staged at most of the theme parks in some form
or another, and even at select hotels, won’t often tickle your taste buds,
but the food’s not really the point. Who cares what pancakes taste like
when Cinderella’s smiling beatifically at your enthralled three-year-old or
Mickey’s posing with you for that all-important Kodak moment? Disney’s
turned their character meals into something of an art form, and Universal
and SeaWorld have recently followed suit. For a rundown of the best
character meals in town, see Chapter 10.
Words to the Wise: The Local Lingo
Though good old-fashioned English is all you need to know in order to
have a blast in Orlando, the theme parks do have a language all their
own. Knowing the right word or phrase may help ease your way as you
navigate the maze of the city’s rides and attractions. Here’s a rundown
of common terms you’ll likely come across while in Orlando:
 FASTPASS. This is Disney’s legal line-jumping pass, and it’s avail-
able at most of WDW’s primo park rides. You insert your park
ticket into a machine, which spits out a pass with a time window
(usually of about an hour) stamped on it. You come back within the
window indicated, and you can get in a special line with little to no
wait. For more on FASTPASS, see Chapter 11.
 Universal EXPRESS. This is Universal’s answer to Disney’s FASTPASS,
and it works in pretty much the same way. For more information,
see Chapter 18.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Orlando 21

 Ride-share. Most of Orlando’s theme parks operate a ride-share
program (also known as a parent-swap) for parents with small chil-
dren at their major attractions. With this option, one parent can
ride an attraction with the kids able to ride while the other stays
with the kids too young to partake; then the adults can switch
places without the second one having to stand in line again. Notify
one of the ride staff if you wish to participate when you get in line.
 Cast member. In its ever-present attempt to keep up the illusion that
WDW is some kind of giant on-going production, Disney refers to its
staff as cast members. Whatever you call them, they are almost
always knowledgeable and well trained.
 Advanced Dining Reservations. This is the Disney version of a
restaurant reservation (and the concept is being used increasingly
at other Orlando restaurants as well). Instead of reserving an exact
time at a restaurant, you reserve the right to arrive at a specific
time and get the next available table (which can sometimes —
though not often — take up to 30 minutes). For more on this
system, see Chapter 10. 
In addition, many locals commonly shorten or abbreviate the major
theme-park names, as do a number of the highway signs you’ll see on
the road. Universal Orlando is often just referred to as Universal and
Universal Studios Florida is shortened to Universal Studios or abbrevi-
ated USF, while Islands of Adventure is either Islands or IOA. Walt
Disney World is usually known merely as Disney World, Disney, or WDW.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
The best Walt Disney World & Orlando guidebook on the planet (yes,
this one) covers almost everything most travelers need and want to
know. But, to be fair, here are a few others that can get you into Mickey
mode before you arrive:
 The Walt Disney World Trivia Book (2004; Intrepid Traveler
Publishing) is loaded with fun facts and minutiae about Disney
World. Hundreds of multiple-choice questions keep you and your
kids entertained even as they enlighten. 
 Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando (2003;
Yale University Press) is a serious and not always flattering look at
the relationship between the Disney corporation and the city of
Orlando. It’s a trifle didactic in tone, but its in-depth details make
it fascinating reading nonetheless.
 Since the World Began (1996; Hyperion) was published to coin-
cide with Disney World’s 25th anniversary and is a history of
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
22

WDW’s first 25 years. It offers a lot of interesting information and
insight into the creation of all Disney’s parks and resorts.
 Orlando: City of Dreams (2003, Arcadia) is a meticulously
researched history of Orlando before it became the city of the
Mouse.
 How It Feels to Be Colored Me (1928), Mules and Men (1935),
Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), The Florida Negro (1938),
and other books and essays by Zora Neale Hurston, chronicle life
and racism in Florida, including Eatonville, the town just north of
Orlando where she grew up. If you’re a Hurston fan, don’t miss the
listing for the January festival in her honor in the Calendar of
Events in Chapter 3.
If your tastes run more toward the visual medium, there’s no shortage of
films that can get you in the mood for your Orlando vacation. Here are a
few viewing suggestions before you set out on your trip:
 Disney’s plethora of animated films will introduce kids to the char-
acters and ride themes they’ll be running into inside WDW. A few
recent goodies include Finding Nemo, The Lion King, Toy Story
(and Toy Story 2), Aladdin, Lilo & Stitch, 101 Dalmatians, The Little
Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast. For an introduction to Disney’s
classic characters (who are alive and well in the theme parks), I
suggest Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty,
Dumbo, Pinocchio, and Fantasia (though it may be a tad too sophis-
ticated for very young kids). 
 If you prefer live action to animation, break out the popcorn and
put on any of these pictures, all of which are represented in some
form or another inside the Disney parks: Mary Poppins; Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids; Swiss Family Robinson; and, more recently, The
Haunted Mansion and the Oscar-nominated Pirates of the Caribbean.
 They do say it’s the place to “Ride the Movies” so it should come as
no surprise that Universal Studios Florida is filled with rides and
attractions that seemingly put you smack in the middle of some of
their most famous films. Some of the best previews include The
Mummy, Back to the Future, Twister, Jaws, Men in Black, Shrek, E.T.,
and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. If you’re heading to Islands of
Adventure, then Jurassic Park, X-Men, and Spider-Man should be
on to your movie list. Pick up a copy of Cat in the Hat (or any one
of Dr. Seuss’s classic books for that matter) for the younger kids.
Universal caters more to teens and adults than Disney does, and
these films (like the rides they inspired) are definitely aimed more
at that audience; so take your child’s age into consideration before
popping that movie in.
 Before heading off to SeaWorld, you may want to watch a few
marine-related National Geographic specials to get some back-
ground on some of the animals you can see in that park.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Considering the pros and cons of traveling in each season
 Checking out Orlando’s weather patterns
 Consulting a calendar of special occasions
A
lthough Orlando is bustling with activity throughout the year,
some seasons are definitely busier than others. When you go may
very well affect what you see, how much you pay, and how long you
stand in line. In this chapter, I explain the advantages and disadvantages
of visiting during the spring, summer, fall and winter months so you can
decide the best time for your big vacation.
The Secrets of the Seasons
Although Orlando has something for all ages, the city is primarily a des-
tination for families. So anytime children are out of school, whether for
break or a three-day holiday, the theme parks are a tangle of pushy,
sweaty little bodies. By far the busiest times to visit are during spring
break (Feb to mid-Apr), the summer (Memorial Day weekend to Labor
Day weekend), and the winter holidays (mid-Dec to early Jan). Keep in
mind that any holidays that fall during those peak-season weeks bring
with them exponential increases in crowd levels, and a vacation experi-
ence that may very well border on the insane.
Obviously, your vacation experience would be the best when crowds are
thinnest and the weather is mild. In most destinations, such times would
normally describe the off season; however, there really is no off season
in Orlando. As the tourists begin their homeward journey, business
clients and the convention trade start pouring in, and they come in
droves. International visitors also keep things busy year-round. This
year-round popularity means that many hotels don’t offer a traditional
high- and low-season rate scale, and it also means that you need to book
your trip as early as possible.
My favorite time of year to head to Orlando is between September and
October. The crowds tend to be thinnest following the Labor Day week-
end and through the first two weeks of October as school is once again
back in session. Florida residents often scoot to the parks during this time

for a day trip or a long weekend. But most out-of-state guests don’t have
that luxury. If you have younger children, consider pulling them out of
school for a few days during the slower months to avoid the horrendous
lines. Ask their teachers for schoolwork to take with you. You can also
suggest that your kids write a report on an educational element of the
vacation. (And yes, they’ll actually learn something while they’re traipsing
around places like Innoventions and the World Showcase at Epcot).
Even if you come during the off season, the parks run close to full tilt,
although operating hours are generally markedly shorter. No matter
what time of year you find yourself heading to Orlando, you’ll want to
be aware of that season’s perks and pitfalls.
Spring: Excitement blooms in Orlando
Spring is sensational in Orlando because
 The weather is mild. Sunny days are followed by cool breezy nights.
By early spring the flowers are beginning to bloom, and they are
bursting with color later in the season. If your hometown is still
blanketed by feet of snow, you’ll be in heaven.
 Accommodations often offer spring discounts (with the exception
of the weeks surrounding the Easter holiday, when rates can be at
their highest).
 The lines inside the theme parks are relatively short. Visit on a
weekday, and your wait for a ride is likely to be less than 30 min-
utes (again the exception being the two, sometimes three, weeks on
either side of the Easter holiday, which can bring with it some of
the longest lines of the year).
But keep in mind that
 Without a winter, spring is fleeting. The daytime hours can already
be hot and humid by late April, although the really sticky weather
doesn’t usually arrive until mid- to late May.
 The high pollen count can drive allergy sufferers crazy.
 April is, by far, one of the busiest months to visit, especially around
Easter. College students are headed down for their share of fun in the
sun while families take advantage of the time off for travel. Hotels are
booked well in advance, the lines are, at times, unbearable, and the
crowds border on being intolerable. Everything, including the road-
ways, restaurants, hotels, and the parks, is jam-packed with people.
Summer: Have fun in the Orlando sun
Summer is superb in Orlando because
 Daylight is plentiful, and most parks take full advantage by remain-
ing open until 9 p.m. or often later (10, 11, or even midnight closings
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 25

are not out of the question), and long days are many times capped
off by spectacular nighttime fireworks displays.
 Crowds are manageable. Even though it’s one of the most popular
seasons, it pales in comparison to spring break and the winter holi-
days. The weekends are busier than at almost any other time of the
year, but the weekdays bring a bit of relief. 
 August brings with it back-to-school sales at Orlando’s many malls
and outlets.
 All hotels, major restaurants, and indoor tourist attractions in
Central Florida have air conditioning.
 Orlando has some of the coolest pools and unique water parks.
Splashing around in any one of them makes for a fun way to beat
the heat.
However, keep in mind that
 Outside, the heat and humidity can be downright oppressive. The
phrase “I’m melllllllting” takes on new meaning. Those with respira-
tory problems would do best to avoid Orlando in summer, when it
may feel like you’re trying to breath in a steam room.
 Crowds and sweat create a sometimes unpleasant perfume in the
air. And with the UV index at its extreme, you’ll burn in less than
20 minutes without a good sunscreen. 
 There’s not much of a chance of getting discounts. Why should
anyone cut prices when everything is running at capacity?
Fall: Harvest good times in Orlando
Fall is fabulous in Orlando because
 With schools back in session, crowds are at their thinnest.
 Accommodations that do give discounts often offer them in the fall.
 With smaller crowds, wait times for lines can be 30 minutes or less.
In fact, I’ve sometimes gotten off a ride, only to turn around and
walk right back on.
But keep in mind that
 Although the weather is cooler, the temperature doesn’t get as mild
as spring until Thanksgiving or later. 
 Shorter crowds mean shorter park hours. Closing times of 6 or
7 p.m. (sometimes even earlier) are not uncommon.
 Once mid-December arrives, so do the higher prices.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
26

Winter: You’ll be warm and welcome in Orlando
Winter is wonderful in Orlando because
 Orlando doesn’t have a true winter — although some nights
approach freezing temperatures, the days are still relatively mild and
sunny. January and February have the biggest temperature swings.
One day it can reach 80°, the next it may only get into the 40’s.
 With the exception of the holiday period from mid- December to
just after New Year’s — the busiest season of all — lines at the
parks don’t get much shorter than they do during this time of year.
However, remember that
 The many conventions held in Orlando throughout the year keep
room rates from plunging completely, and conventioneers can take
over entire hotels, sometimes making rooms hard to find. 
 During the Thanksgiving and mid-December to early January holi-
days, the parks are just as crowded (if not more so) as summer
weekends.
Weather Warnings
You don’t need to worry too much, but knowing a little about Florida’s
weather-related temper tantrums is a good idea. Here’s a list of weather
events that you may experience during your stay:
 Hurricanes: The Gulf and Atlantic hurricane seasons run from June
1 to November 30. In an average year, the Atlantic churns out ten of
these storms, and one or two touch Florida. The Gulf adds three to
five. The good news: Orlando’s inland location generally means the
worst a hurricane can do is ruin a couple days of vacation with
heavy rains and the occasional tornado. (That said, in Aug and Sept
of 2004, hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne swept through
Orlando causing massive shutdowns and evacuations. While this
was an extremely rare occurrence, it’s something to keep in mind.)
 Lightning: This scary but beautiful show, courtesy of Mother
Nature, makes regular appearances during Orlando’s frequent
summer thunderstorms.
Don’t let lightning ruin your trip, however. Unless you go out of
your way to attract it, lightning’s wrath likely won’t bother you.
Use common sense and you should be fine.
 Sun: Florida isn’t called the Sunshine State without good reason.
Make sure that you use plenty of sunscreen (an SPF of 30 or higher
is recommended) during your trip. Florida tourism thrives on the
sun, but you won’t enjoy your vacation much if you’re laid up with
a painful sunburn or, even worse, sun poisoning.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 27

Sunburns can really ruin a fun day at the parks. Preventing your skin
from turning a magnificent, and painful, shade of red is simple: Slather
yourself and your kids (even the ones in covered strollers) with a sun
block that has a SPF of at least 30 (50 is even better for the kids) and
that, preferably, contains zinc or titanium oxide. Pick a formula that’s
both waterproof and sweatproof. And don’t forget to keep re-applying
it, especially after you hit the swimming pool. Every two hours is best.
Likewise, remember to bring a wide-brimmed hat and don’t forget a
Florida native’s favorite fashion statement — sunglasses.
To avoid dehydration, another vacation killer, drink more fluids than you
think you need. By the time you’re thirsty and cranky from walking around
in the heat, you’re already dehydrated. Ignoring these signs could lead to
heat exhaustion or worse. Avoid caffeinated or carbonated beverages, as
well as alcoholic drinks and those high in sugar — these actually cause
you to lose more body fluids. Sports drinks can supplement fluids in your
body, but water should be your first choice. 
Freeze a couple water bottles to bring along — they stay cold far longer
and save you a few dollars in the end (especially as you can refill them
at a fountain for free throughout the day). 
Take frequent breaks under the shade of a tree or in the comfort of air-
conditioning, especially if you have kids in tow. Wearing lightweight light
colored clothing will all help alleviate the affects of the searing sunshine. 
For those looking for exact forecasts, log onto www.weather.com the week
of your trip and use zip code 32830 to get a ten-day forecast for the area.

Orlando’s Calendar: Attractions in Review
In this section, I list (by month) just a few of Orlando’s many exciting 
festivals and special events. Please double-check with the festivals’
respective governing organizations before planning your vacation around
any of them. Event dates, as with everything else, are subject to change.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
28

You can access the Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors
Bureau Web site at www.orlandoinfo.com for information about other
upcoming events.
January
The second-ranked teams from the Southeastern and Big Ten college
football conferences square off against each other at the annual Capital
One Florida Citrus Bowl. Tickets are $55 before November 1 and $65
up until the day of the game. Call % 800-297-2695 or 407-423-2476 for
information or Ticketmaster at % 877-803-7073 or 407-839-3900 (on the
Internet, go to www.fcsports.com). January 2.
Why walk through the WDW parks, when you can run the Walt Disney
World Marathon (% 407-939-7810; www.disneysports.com)? The 26.2-
mile course starts and ends at Epcot, winding through each of the other
Disney parks, as well as along the Boardwalk. Spots fill up fast, so if this
sounds like something you want to do, you had better sign up as soon
as you finish reading this sentence. The entrance fee will run you $95.
A half-marathon ($85), beginning at Epcot, making its way through the
Magic Kingdom, and ending back at Epcot, is an option for those not
quite ready for all 26 miles. Those with children won’t be left behind as
the 5K Family Fun Run ($25–$30) winds around Epcot’s World Showcase
with shorter races especially designed for the kids, including a 100, 200,
400, and infant diaper dash (each costs $5). January 7 and 8.
The four-day Zora Neale Hurston Festival (% 407-647-3307; www.zora
nealehurstonfestival.com) is celebrated in Eatonville, the first incor-
porated African-American town in America. It highlights the life and
works of author Zora Neale Hurston. Eatonville is 25 miles north of the
parks. Admission is $5 to $10 adults, $3 kids ages 4 to 17. Lectures or
seminars are extra. Last weekend in January.
February
Authentic parade floats from New Orleans, stilt walkers, and traditional
doubloons and beads add to all the fun at Mardi Gras at Universal
Studios Florida (% 800-837-2273 or 407-363-8000; www.universal
orlando.com). Not unlike the original celebration, this party is flowing
with plenty of alcohol, making it more of an adult-oriented event —
though, thankfully, you don’t have to show any skin to get beads thrown
at you. On Saturday nights, nationally known bands and artists ranging
from K.C. and the Sunshine Band to Donna Summer play the stage inside
the park. All Mardi Gras events are included in the regular price of
admission to the park. Daily from mid-February to mid-March.
The Atlanta Braves head south for spring training to Disney’s Wide
World of Sports Complex. They play a 16-game spring season that
begins in early March. Tickets are $13 to $21. For general information,
call % 407-939-GAME or check online at www.disneysports.com. To
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 29

purchase tickets, call Ticketmaster at % 877-803-7073 or 407-839-3900.
You can also get online information at www.atlantabraves.com or www.
majorleaguebaseball.com. Beginning in late February.
March
The ten-day Florida Film Festival (call % 407-644-6579 or 407-629-1088;
www.floridafilmfestival.com or www.enzian.org), showcasing
the year’s best independent and foreign films, has become one of the
most respected regional film events in the country. Single tickets are
$10 or less, with special ticket packages also available. Mid-March.
Spanning two weekends in March, SeaWorld’s BBQ Fest (% 800-423-
8368; www.seaworldorlando.com) offers a great barbecue buffet while
listening to the sounds of popular country artists. The concerts are
included with regular park admission, but the buffet is an additional
$14.95 adults and $8.95 for children ages 9 or younger. Mid-March.
Also in mid-March, you can enjoy the wonderful Winter Park Sidewalk
Arts Festival (% 407-672-6390; www.wpsaf.org), which is rated as one
of the nation’s most prestigious fine arts festivals and draws artists from
all over North America. Each year, more than 350,000 people enjoy this
free three-day event filled with art, food, children’s activities, and per-
formances by nationally recognized jazz artists. Third weekend in March.
April
From garden beds color-coordinated to form those famous Mickey ears
to whimsical topiaries specially grown and groomed to take the shape
of Disney’s classic characters, the six-week Epcot International Flower
and Garden Festival (% 407-934-7639; www.disneyworld.com) is
geared towards those with an appreciation of what Disney can do to
Mother Nature’s finest foliage. Nightly classic-rock and pop concerts are
featured at the America Gardens Theater near the American Pavilion.
Included with regular Epcot admission. Late-April to early June.
May
More than 100 acts from around the world participate in the eclectic 
ten-day Orlando International Fringe Festival (% 407-648-0077; www.
orlandofringe.com), which takes place at various locations in down-
town Orlando. Entertainers perform everything from drama to political
satire, experimental theater, and Hamlet. Ticket prices vary, but most
performances are less than $10. Usually starts third week of May.
Whether you’re a Jedi-in-training or Darth Vader–wannabe, the Force will
be with you during the four Star Wars Weekends at Disney–MGM Studios
(% 407-934-7639; www.disneyworld.com). In addition to various Star
Wars–themed shows and parades, each weekend features meet-and-greets
with actual actors from the movies such as Anthony Daniels (C3PO) and
Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca). Included with regular Disney–MGM admis-
sion. Begins in mid-May.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
30

June
Gay Days (www.gayday.com or www.gaydays.com) draws tens of thou-
sands of gay and lesbian travelers to Central Florida. This event began
in 1991 as an unofficial event at Disney World that ended up attracting
50,000 people. It has expanded to a week-long celebration, during which,
Universal Orlando and SeaWorld also host events. Keep in mind, red is
the color of choice for event-goers during this week, and Saturday is
when they descend en masse on the Magic Kingdom. First weekend
in June.
July
Orlando heats up as Independence Day is celebrated with bands,
singers, dancers, and unbelievable fireworks displays at Disney’s Star-
Spangled Spectacular (% 407-824-4321; www.disneyworld.com). The
parks stay open late for the occasion. SeaWorld (% 407-351-3600; www.
seaworld.com) exhibits a dazzling laser/fireworks spectacular, and
Orlando’s Lake Eola Park (% 407-246-2827; cityoforlando.net) fea-
tures activities and entertainment throughout the late afternoon as well
as a free nighttime fireworks display. Local radio station WXXL hosts
an annual Fourth of July concert (% 407-916-7800; www.wxxl.com)
in Altamonte Springs that brings in Top-40 radio acts, such as Jessica
Simpson, to play for thousands of people outdoors. July 4.
September
One weekend each September, the Magic Kingdom plays host to a con-
temporary Christian and Gospel music festival, Night of Joy, featuring top
artists. This event is very popular, so get tickets early. Admission to the
concert is separately ticketed from regular admission; Magic Kingdom
attractions are included. Ticket prices are $36.95 (one night), $59.95 (two
nights), and $79.95 (all three nights). Call % 407-824-4321 or visit www.
nightofjoy.com for concert details. Universal goes head-to-head with
Disney, scheduling its Rock the Universe Christian music concert the very
same weekend (% 800-837-2273; www.rocktheuniverse.com). Tickets
are $35.95 for one night or $58.95 for both nights; admission includes
entrance to Universal Studios after 4 p.m., the concerts, and full use of
the park’s rides and attractions until 1 a.m. Second weekend in September.
Later in the month, SeaWorld offers a weekend of sensational music,
concerts, dance, food sampling, and crafts to celebrate Hispanic culture
in Florida at its Viva La Musica (% 800-423-8368; www.seaworld
orlando.com). Admission is included with regular park admission.
Last weekend in September.
October
At the six-week Epcot International Food & Wine Festival (% 407-824-
4321; www.disneyworld.com), you have the chance to sip and savor
the food and beverages of 30 countries for the measly sum of $3 to $5
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 31

per sample. Events include wine-tastings, seminars, concerts, and
celebrity-chef cooking demonstrations. Some specially ticketed dinners
or wine-tastings are available at prices ranging from $85 to $175. You
must be 21 or over to enjoy the libations, but all ages can enjoy the culi-
nary treats. October 1 to mid-November.
Orlando is frightfully fun in October as Islands of Adventure transforms
its grounds with haunted attractions for about 20 or so nights in honor
of Universal Orlando’s Halloween Horror Nights (% 800-837-2273 or
407-363-8000; www.universalorlando.com). Complete with live bands,
special shows, a psychopath’s maze, and hundreds of ghouls and gob-
lins roaming the streets, the studio closes at dusk and then reopens in
a new, chilling form at 7 p.m. The park charges full adult admission
($54.75) for this event (children under 10 aren’t permitted), which lasts
until about midnight. Guests aren’t allowed to wear costumes so that
Universal employees can spot their peers. This event tends to sell out,
especially nearer to Halloween, so get your tickets early. Runs on select
nights in October.
If your young ones are more into treats than tricks for Halloween,
Mickey hosts the annual Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party
(% 407-824-4321; www.disneyworld.com) at the Magic Kingdom,
complete with special parades and a complimentary family photo.
Each guest is also given a Halloween bag, and, throughout the park,
cast members hand out treats. This is a separately ticketed event held
after regular park closing, but most attractions are open. Tickets are
$32 for adults and $26 for children 9 or younger. This event tends to
sell out, especially nearer to Halloween, so get your tickets early
(they go on sale in May!). Runs on select nights in October.
November
Soap opera–fanatics from all over the world descend upon Disney–MGM
Studios during the ABC Super Soap Weekend (% 407-824-4321; www.
disneyworld.com) to get up-close-and-personal with their favorite stars
from ABC’s long-running soaps — All My Children, One Life to Live, and
General Hospital. The event is included with regular park admission.
First weekend of November.
Downtown Disney Marketplace is home to The Walt Disney World
Festival of the Masters (% 407-824-4321; www.disneyworld.com), one
of the largest art shows in the South. The exhibition features top artists,
photographers, and craftspeople — all winners of juried shows through-
out the United States. Admission to the festival is free to all. The second
weekend in November.
December
During the Disney Christmas festivities, Main Street in the Magic
Kingdom is lavishly decked out with lights and holly, and carolers wel-
come visitors. Thousands of colored lights illuminate an 80-foot tree.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World & Orlando 
32

Epcot and Animal Kingdom also offer special embellishments and 
entertainment throughout the holiday season, as do all Disney resorts.
Disney–MGM Studios offers the world-famous Osbourne Family Spectacle
of Lights. One holiday highlight includes Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas
Party, an after-dark ticketed event, which takes place on weekends at the
Magic Kingdom and offers a traditional Christmas parade and fireworks
display. Admission ($33.95 adults, $23.95 kids 3 to 9) includes cookies,
cocoa, and a souvenir photo. The best part? Shorter lines for rides.
Another holiday highlight is the Candlelight Procession at Epcot, which
features hundreds of candle-holding carolers, a celebrity narrator telling
the Christmas story, and a 450-voice choir that’s very moving. Regular park
admission is required, but special dinner packages include special seat-
ing for the event ($29–$42 for adults, depending on the Epcot restaurant
chosen; $11 for ages 3–11, regardless of restaurant). Call % 407-824-4321
for details on these events or visit www.disneyworld.com. Dates vary,
but most events are staged at various times in December.

In this part . . . 
O
kay, it’s nitty-gritty time. In this part, I suggest some
ways you can save money on your vacation and lay out
the different ways you can get to Disney World and Orlando. I
also sort out the various travel packages available to the city
and offer suggestions on buying travel insurance, staying
healthy, and staying in contact with those who didn’t get to
make the trip. And so everyone has a good time, I also offer
dedicated advice to those people who have special travel
needs or interests, be it families, seniors, or gays and lesbians.

Managing Your Money

D
eveloping a realistic budget is an important key to enjoying your
vacation — the last thing you want to experience when you get to
Orlando is sticker shock, as Central Florida is famous for its ability to
exact a pound of flesh from even the most cost-conscious traveler. From
hotel rooms to meal tabs to admission fees, you can easily break the
bank if you don’t do some homework and set some limits in advance.
The good news is that there are ways to avoid blowing your bankroll,
and I show them to you in this chapter.
Planning Your Budget
When it comes to your Orlando vacation, working out a budget may be
the single most important thing you do. The hard part is sticking to it
after you’ve been swept up in all the excitement. Mickey and his pals are
masters when it comes to separating you from your money. But by using
the tips I give you, you can come up with a pretty accurate estimate of
what a trip to Mickey’s place may cost you. 
When making your budget, be sure to include every possible expense,
especially hidden charges that are almost never quoted when you inquire
about hotel or rental-car rates, attraction admissions, and restaurant
prices unless you specifically ask. Florida sales taxes, which run from
6.5 percent on merchandise to almost 25 percent on rental cars, are chief
on the list of these hidden charges. For more information, see “Taxes” in
the Appendix.
Another hidden expense many travelers fail to budget for is tips. Orlando
is a tip-happy place. A 15-percent tip is the general rule for restaurant
service and cab rides. The hotel housekeeper deserves $1 to $2 a day for
cleaning your mess, making your beds, and keeping you stocked with
towels and toilet paper. Baggage handlers usually receive at least $1 per
bag. And don’t forget about a $1 to $2 tip for valet parking.

Most of your Orlando vacation expenses fall into six categories: 
 Lodging. The average rack rate for a three-star hotel in Orlando
is about $85 per night (see Chapter 9). In most cases, those rates
include any children younger than 12, and usually younger than
18, staying in your room. The lowest rates at WDW are those at the
All-Star resorts, which, depending on the season, run from $77 to
$131. They’re pricier than comparable rooms in the outside world;
they’re tiny, basic, and heavily themed, but they’re on Disney soil. 
 Transportation. Some hotels offer free shuttles to the parks; others
take you for a fee (see Chapter 8 for more information). If you stay
at Disney, you can access its free transportation system (though
it’s plodding). Rental-car rates start at about $35 a day after you’ve
tossed in Florida’s various taxes and surcharges (which can total
up to 20–25 percent above the quoted rate). And don’t forget to
add the $8 ($9 for some) daily charge to park your car at the theme
parks — though you won’t have to pay this at the Disney parks if
you’re a guest at one of Mickey’s resorts. If you’re a fan of valet
parking, add at least $12 to $15 per day (and possibly a whole lot
more) for fees and tips. If you’re flying into Orlando, don’t forget to
add the cost of getting to the airport, airport parking (if you’re driv-
ing yourself), airline tickets (you can find tips for getting the best
airfare in Chapter 5), and transportation from the Orlando airport
to your room. If you’re driving to Orlando, be sure to include your
fuel costs and tolls.
 Dining. Satisfying your stomach in Orlando is the biggest variable
in your budget, and outside of admissions and tickets, it can easily
end up being your biggest expense. If you’re happy with a diet of
nothing but fast food, expect an average of $30 to $40 per person,
per day. Adding one or two restaurant meals jumps the average up
to $40 to $60 per person, per day, including tax and tip; and expect
to spend $60 or more per person if you dine mostly in the theme
parks or at Disney’s and Universal’s resorts, where prices are
almost 25 percent higher than those in the outside world. (See
Chapter 10 for more information on dining.) Keep in mind that food
in the parks and resorts is overpriced and is, for the most, part
average at best (though there are exceptions). Outside the parks,
you can find delis and pizzerias for takeout as well as assorted
budget minded eateries. 
 Attractions. Your expenses for attractions depend on which parks
you plan to visit and how many days you spend at each. When you
throw in sales tax, Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld charge just
over $60 per adult and around $50 per child age 3 to 9, per day.
(See Chapters 12–16 and 18–20 for information about the individual
parks.) If you’re planning to visit any of these parks more than once,
buying a multiday and, in some cases, multipark pass is the by far
the best way to go. Chapter 21 also includes some less expensive
and even free attractions that you can visit if you want to cut your
costs and broaden your experiences.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando 
38

 Shopping. Orlando is a shopper’s paradise, with several large malls
and outlets (see Chapter 22) and an array of souvenir shops to
choose from. The amusement park gift shops are notorious for inflat-
ing prices on souvenirs, and although I don’t recommend picking up
more than a couple of souvenirs at the parks, be prepared for their
ability to lure you in. Budget accordingly.
 Nightlife. If you stick to the theme park options, plan on dropping
about $30 to $40 for admission to the various nightspots and a few
$5 beers. (See Chapter 25 for information about the various park
nightlife options.) If you have a car (rental or your own), downtown
options can come in slightly less, at around $20 to $30 for cover
charges and a few beers. 
After estimating your expenses, be sure to tack on another 15 to 20 per-
cent to your budget as a safety net — there’s bound to be a pair of fuzzy
light-up Mickey ears calling the name of someone in your group.

Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
You can conserve your cash in more than just a couple of ways when you
vacation in Orlando. Using these tips can keep your costs manageable:
 Visit off season. Hotel prices in the off-season (Sept–Nov or Apr to
early June) can be substantially lower, depending on the property. 
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on
a different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 5.
 Try a package tour. For many Orlando destinations, you can book
airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some additional
perks just by making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a
price much less than if you put the trip together yourself. (See
Chapter 5 for more on package tours.)
 Ask whether your kids can stay in the room with you. A room
with two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with
a queen-size bed. And many hotels don’t charge you the additional
person rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you.
Many Orlando hotels offer “suites” with bunk beds or separate
sleeping areas for kids. They may cost more than a regular room,
but even if you have to pay extra for the extra space or a rollaway
bed, you can save hundreds by not taking two rooms. 
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut costs; several motels have
minifridges, coffeemakers, and even a microwave. Buying supplies
for breakfast saves you money — and probably calories.
 Don’t bunk with Mickey. This one may be hard to swallow for
those who want to immerse themselves in all things Disney. And if
your vacation can’t be complete without a stay on Walt Disney
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando 
40

World property, then by all means go for it. But if you’re on a tight
budget, you can stay in some wonderful, themed (albeit, non-Mickey)
properties for considerably less than you would pay for the cheapest
Disney hotels.
 Take advantage of your in-and-out privileges if you have a multi-
day pass to a theme park. Go back to your hotel for a picnic lunch
and a swim or nap. You can eat economically, miss the midday sun,
and refuel for an afternoon or, in some cases, an evening at the park
without having to pay admission fees again.
 Avoid splurging — pace yourself. Your money goes fastest when
you overexert yourself exploring the parks, and you end up too
hungry, thirsty, or tired to care about how much you spend. Be
sure to schedule rest breaks throughout the day and begin each
day with a big breakfast (several hotels offer spreads that are
included in their room rates). You can find several buffets outside
the parks for around $4 to $6 (see Chapter 10). 
 Brown-bag it. Bringing your own food is extremely cost-effective.
The parks are wise to this scheme and many don’t allow coolers,
but they generally ignore it when you aren’t obvious about it, so
make your operation covert — hide food in a fanny pack or back-
pack. If you don’t want to schlepp food, do bring drinks or stop
often at drinking fountains — the bottled water and soda prices in
the parks can have you wondering if the theme parks are selling
liquid gold instead of Coke.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner costs at a top restaurant, and
the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save on gas to boot. For more on car rentals, see Chapter 5.
 Don’t spend every day at a theme park. Discover your hotel’s
pool, playground, workout room, and other freebies, or head out of
town to a state park, beach, or one of the lower-priced attractions
away from theme park central. 
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories could be
the best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the T-shirts and other trinkets.
 Hit the Web. The Web site www.mousesavers.com keeps track of
almost all available discounts for Disney-related vacations (from
room discount codes to special packages and promotions). If you
want to stay at a Disney resort, Mousesavers will likely help you
save money doing it.
 Receive instant discounts with an Orlando Magicard. The Orlando
Magicard is good for up to $500 in discounts on accommodations,
car rentals, attractions, and more. Better yet, the card is free. You
can get a Magicard from the Orlando/Orange County Convention &
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

Visitors Bureau, 8723 International Dr., Suite 101, Orlando, FL 
32819 (% 800-643-9492 or 407-363-5872; www.orlandoinfo.com/
magicard/index.cfm). You may also be eligible for other discounts
if you’re a member of AARP, AAA, the military, or service clubs, so
don’t be bashful — just ask.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.master
card.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) ATM networks
span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see which network
you’re on, then call or check online for ATM locations at your destina-
tion. You can find ATMs at all of Orlando’s major theme parks; check the
guide map you get upon entering each park for locations.
Keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is used
at a different bank’s ATM. In Florida, you’re assessed an average charge
of $2.75 when you use an ATM that isn’t affiliated with your bank. (That’s
on top of any fees your bank may charge.) 
Be extremely careful when using ATMs, especially at night and in areas
that are heavily traveled but not well lighted. Don’t let the land of
Mickey lull you into a false sense of security. Minnie and Goofy won’t
mug you — but thieves working the theme park zones may. 
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses and generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks provide the number over
the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some other
personal information.

42

Keep in mind that you start paying interest on credit card cash advances
the minute you get them and it’s generally much higher than the rate for
charging your purchases.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own. So if you’re withdrawing
money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — provided
that you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to cash
one. All of the major theme parks and resorts accept traveler’s checks
from major banks.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
Be sure to contact all of your credit-card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in the United States:
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 43
Dollars — Disney style
Walt Disney World theme parks and some resorts offer their own way of paying. You
can use your electronic room key as a debit card in Disney’s shops and restaurants —
items are charged directly to your room. 
Although I don’t recommend doing so, you can buy Disney Dollars (currency with cute
little pictures of Mickey, Goofy, or Minnie on it) at the resorts or the guest services
desk in each of the parks. The bills come in $1, $5, and $10 denominations, and they’re
good at shops, restaurants, and resorts throughout Walt Disney World and in Disney
stores elsewhere on the planet. This currency provides no real benefit other than its
negligible souvenir value. If you want to trade Disney Dollars for real currency upon
leaving, you end up facing — you guessed it! — one more line in the theme parks.
Be advised that refunds for deposits on wheelchairs, strollers, and such in the theme
parks are often paid in Disney Dollars. But if you’re persistent, you can get your refunds
in Uncle Sam’s currency, instead of Mickey’s.

etting to your destination isn’t always half the fun of your trip, but
you can choose ways to get from point A to point B without too
much hassle or expense. In this chapter, I eliminate the travel double
talk, shed the useless options, and make sure that you have a fun and
easy time planning your getaway.
Flying to Orlando
Getting to Orlando by plane is a breeze. Almost every major domestic
airline offers direct service to Mickeyville from most major cities in the
U.S. and Canada. A number of international carriers also fly direct from
several major European and South American cities.
Finding out which airlines fly there
If you’re flying to Orlando, the best place to land is Orlando International
Airport (% 407-825-2001; www.orlandoairports.net). The airport, also
known as OIA, offers direct or nonstop service from approximately 60 U.S.
and 25 international cities. About 40 scheduled airlines and several char-
ters feed more than 31 million people through its gates annually. For a list
of all the major airlines that fly into the city, see “Toll-free Numbers and
Web Sites” in the Appendix. Delta (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com)
provides nearly 20 percent of the flights to and from Orlando International
Airport, offering service from roughly 150 cities.
The sheer number of flights in and out of its gates makes OIA the top
dog as far as local airports go, and its location reinforces that even
more. The airport connects to highways, Interstate 4, and toll roads that
get you (whether you’re driving or being driven) into the heart of it all
within 30 or 40 minutes (fewer if you’re headed into downtown Orlando).
If a proposed train running from the airport to the theme park zones
ever gets built, OIA will become that much more convenient.

Orlando Sanford International Airport (% 407-585-4500; www.orlando
sanfordairport.com) is much smaller than the main airport, but it has
grown a bit in recent years, thanks mainly to a small fleet of international
carriers including Air 2000, Britannia, and Jetsgo, as well as several
regional airlines such as Southeast, TransMeridian, and Vacation
Express. While you may save money flying into Sanford International, it
has some drawbacks. The flight schedules aren’t always convenient; the
airlines using the airport don’t serve all that many cities; and you defi-
nitely need a rental car — the airport is on the northern side of Orlando,
well over 45 minutes away from Walt Disney World.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . . ), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, otherwise known as the full fare. But if you can
book your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing
to travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can take advantage of far
less expensive ticket prices — usually only a fraction of the full fare. On
most flights, even the shortest hops within the United States, can cost
upwards of $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance purchase ticket
may cost half that amount, possibly even less. Obviously, planning
ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales,
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — September
to November and April to early June. You almost never see a sale around
the peak summer vacation months of July and August, or around
Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare
they have to pay. 
Another option is to fly on one of several no-frills airlines — low fares
but no amenities — that service Orlando. The biggest is Southwest
Airlines (% 800-435-9792; www.southwest.com), which has flights
from many U.S. cities to Orlando. Spirit Air (% 800-772-7117; www.
spiritair.com) offers a good selection of flights (several of them
cross-country) to Orlando out of several U.S. cities. JetBlue Airways
(% 800-538-2583; www.jetblue.com) is a low-cost carrier that operates
mostly on the Eastern Seaboard but offers a number of routes from the
West Coast. AirTran Airways (% 800-247-8726; www.airtran.com) reg-
ularly has sales on routes to Orlando from around the country and offers
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando 
46

the option to upgrade to business class on most flights at the gate for
only $35 for each segment of your flight. Most of these so called no-frills
airlines actually offer more in the way of extras than many of the larger
carriers do, given all of the cutbacks and reductions in service of late,
making them an all-around good buy.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available
to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality
only beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
airline Web sites or check mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists of
last-minute specials, such as Smarter Living (smarterliving.com). For
last-minute trips, www.site59.com in the U.S. and www.lastminute.com
in Europe often have better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for travel
on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a mysterious
change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major, well-known
carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia to Orlando
via Omaha is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight
are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you buy; Priceline
usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play their “name
our price” game. Note: In 2004, Priceline added non-opaque service to its
roster. You now have the option to pick exact flights, times, and airlines
from a list of offers — or to bid on opaque fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the airline
sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday.
You can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each 
Chapter 5: Getting to Orlando 47

individual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight
booking, and information on late-breaking bargains.
Driving to Orlando
Driving to Orlando is sometimes a less expensive and potentially more
scenic option, unless the distance is so great that making the road trip
eats up too much of your vacation (and, thanks to rising gas prices, your
budget as well).

AAA (% 800-222-1134; www.aaa.com) and some other automobile clubs
offer free maps and optimum driving directions to their members (among
several other worthwhile travel perks). In addition, several comprehen-
sive Web sites offer door-to-door driving directions with personalized map
routing, including MapQuest, www.mapquest.com; MapBlast!, www.map
blast.com; and Yahoo! Maps, http://maps.yahoo.com.
Arriving by Train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) trains pull into two central
stations: 1400 Sligh Blvd. in downtown Orlando (about 23 miles from
Walt Disney World) and 111 Dakin Ave. in Kissimmee (about 15 miles
from Walt Disney World).
Amtrak’s Auto Train allows you to bring your car to Florida without
having to drive it all the way. The service begins in Lorton, Virginia —
about a four-hour drive from New York, two hours from Philadelphia —
and ends at Sanford, Florida, about 23 miles northeast of Orlando.
Reserve early for the lowest prices. Fares begin at $530 ($1,100 with a
berth) for two passengers and one auto. Call Amtrak for more details.
As with airfares, you can sometimes get discounts if you book train rides
far in advance. But you may find some restrictions on travel dates for
discounted train fares, mostly around the very busy holiday periods. If
you’re willing to travel off season, however, and spend four or more of
your vacation days in transit, you can score rare deals like an offer listed
a while back for a Los Angeles–Orlando round-trip for $50. Amtrak also
offers money-saving packages, including accommodations (some at
WDW resorts), car rentals, tours, and so on. For vacation package infor-
mation, call % 877-YES-RAIL.
Choosing a Package Tour
For popular destinations, such as Walt Disney World, package tours can
be a smart way to go. In many cases, a package tour that includes air-
fare, hotel, and transportation to and from the airport costs less than
the hotel alone on a tour you book yourself. That’s because packages are
sold in bulk to tour operators, who then resell them to the public. It’s
kind of like buying your vacation at a buy-in-bulk store — except the
tour operator is the one who buys the 1,000-count box of candy bars and
resells them 10 at a time at a cost that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those candy bars, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels
for lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell
charters. Some packages limit your choice of accommodations and
travel days. 
Chapter 5: Getting to Orlando 49

If you choose to buy a package, think strongly about purchasing travel
insurance, especially when the tour operator asks you to pay up front.
But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If they don’t fulfill their
obligation to provide you with the vacation you’ve paid for, you have no
reason to think they’ll fulfill their insurance obligations either. Obtain
travel insurance through an independent agency. See Chapter 7 for more
information about buying travel insurance.
Where can I find travel packages?
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel & Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.
libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast
and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several
big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online at www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with
them.
Theme-park offerings
Disney offers a dizzying array of packages that can include airfare,
accommodations on or off Disney property, theme-park passes, a rental
car, meals, and a Disney cruise. Disney offers seasonal packages, as well
as special themed vacations, including, but not limited to, golf, honey-
moons, spa makeovers, and so on.
Here are some of the plusses of booking a Disney package tour:
 Using Disney as your source for an all-Disney vacation is hard to
beat. The company’s Web site (www.disneyworld.com) offers spe-
cial planning tools that help visitors design and price their own
Disney vacation packages. There’s even a “Magical Gatherings”
option for families and large groups traveling together that offers
special planning tips and features.
 Nobody knows the Diz better than its own staffers.
 Disney reps can offer rooms in all price ranges ($77 and up).
 New ticketing options allow far more flexibility than ever before, so
you don’t end up with all that extra stuff you really don’t want.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando 
50

However, be aware of the following drawbacks to Disney package deals:
 Resort guests receive the same perks, whether you buy your Disney
package from Disney or someone else (and sometimes other places,
such as AAA, offer additional perks to those booking with them
instead of directly with Disney).
 You have to prod Disney reservation agents for details. If you don’t
ask about them to begin with, the agents frequently don’t volunteer
suggestions, such as the possibility that you can save money if you
start your Disney vacation a day earlier or later. 
 Some WDW package perks aren’t always worth the extra money
you pay in the package price. For example, if they say you get your
picture taken with Mickey as part of the deal, expect that you can
find a better deal elsewhere and pay for your own photo. What
you’re really paying for is the convenience of having Disney plan
the details.
 If you want to see more of Orlando than WDW (and most people
do), you need to compare the offerings of a Disney agent with those
of a regular travel agent. A motivated travel agent can put together
a package of Disney and non-Disney accommodations and attrac-
tions for less than the amount WDW charges.
For detailed information on Disney packages, write to Walt Disney World,
Box 10000, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830-1000; call % 407-828-8101; or go
online to www.disneyworld.com to order a Walt Disney World Vacations
brochure or DVD. You’ll find a dizzying menu of options from which to
choose.
Although not on the same scale as Disney, the packages at Universal
Orlando have improved greatly since the addition of the Islands of
Adventure theme park (see Chapter 19), the CityWalk entertainment
district (see Chapters 10 and 25), and the Portofino Bay, Hard Rock,
and Royal Pacific hotels (see Chapter 9). Your package choices include
resort stays, VIP access to the parks, rides, and often restaurants and
discounts to other non-Disney attractions. Universal also offers pack-
ages that include travel and transportation. Contact Universal Studios
Vacations at % 800-711-0080 or 800-447-0672 for TTY users, or surf
online to www.universalstudiosvacations.com.
SeaWorld also offers packages that include rooms at a handful of
Orlando hotels including the Renaissance Orlando Resort at SeaWorld
(see Chapter 9), car rental, tickets to SeaWorld (see Chapter 20) and,
in some cases, tickets to other theme parks. You can get information
at % 800-557-4268 or online at www.seaworldvacations.com.
Area hotels often join forces with the parks by offering special ticket
deals or stay-and-play packages, so be sure to ask when making your
hotel reservations. The World Center Marriott often offers SeaWorld
packages, and JW Marriott Orlando, Ritz–Carlton Orlando, and
Chapter 5: Getting to Orlando 51

Grande Lakes (see Chapter 9) often offer holiday packages featuring
special meals, park tickets, and discounted rates. 
Other places to find packages
Beside airline and theme-park packages, you can also find packages else-
where. If you have Internet access, the United States Tour Operators
Association’s Web site (www.ustoa.com) has a search engine that enables
you to look for operators that offer packages to specific destinations.
Other package specialists include:
 Touraine Travel (% 800-967-5583; www.tourainetravel.com)
offers a wide variety of tour packages to Disney and Disney proper-
ties, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld.
 If you’re a linkster, try Golfpac Vacations (% 800-327-0878;
www.golfpacinc.com), which offers a slate of play-and-stay 
packages — from basic to comprehensive. Another option provid-
ing similar services is Golf Getaways (% 800-800-4028; www.
golfgetaways.com).

W
orried that your kids are too young or that you’re too old to
enjoy Disney and beyond? Afraid you may experience barriers
blocking your access or lifestyle? In this chapter, I dispense a little
advice for travelers with specific needs.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an
insurmountable challenge. But family travel can be immensely reward-
ing, letting you see the world through smaller pairs of wondrous and
curious eyes. Orlando loves kids and welcomes them like no other city
in the world. In addition to its theme parks, Orlando has plenty of
smaller kid-friendly attractions. All but a few restaurants offer lower-
priced children’s menus (see Chapter 10 for more info on kids and
dining), and most hotels love their younger guests, providing pint-size
pools and, in some cases, special gifts and programs. (See Chapter 9 for
kid-friendly hotels.)
Despite Orlando’s reputation as one of the kid-friendliest places around,
you may find some of its attractions a bit too edgy, sophisticated, or
intense for kids, including many of Epcot’s exhibits (see Chapter 13) and
many of the primo thrill rides at Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19).
Likewise, you may find other attractions, such as Discovery Cove (see
Chapter 20), somewhat cost-prohibitive, even for adults.

Traveling with tots
Traveling with young children can often bring you more stress than
relaxation on your vacation. Consider that younger children have special
needs. They require frequent bathroom breaks and have very short
attention spans. (Does the phrase, “Are we there yet?” ring a bell?) Here
are a few general suggestions for making travel plans for you and your
youngsters:
 Consider age — are your kids old enough? Do you really want to
bring an infant or a toddler to an overcrowded, usually overheated
world that he or she may not appreciate because of his or her age?
The large number of stroller-pushing, toddler-toting parents in the
parks suggests that many people think the experience isn’t too ter-
rible, but I’m warning you anyway. If your child or grandchild is
4 years old or younger, he or she may be able to appreciate only
some of the parks’ offerings, though a good deal of Disney’s Magic
Kingdom is geared to youngsters (see Chapter 12). However, some
of the costume-wearing characters may intimidate very young kids.
And no matter how organized you are, little ones are going to slow
you down. Ask yourself whether your kids are the right age to make
the most out of a trip that costs the equivalent of a developing
nation’s GNP.
 Accommodations for the little ones. Kids younger than 12 (and at
times up to 17) can usually stay for free in their parents’ room at
most hotels. Look for places that have pools and other recreational
facilities so you have the option to spend a day or two away from
the parks without incurring too many additional expenses. If you
want to skip a rental car and aren’t staying at Disney, International
Drive is the next-best place for centralized rooms, restaurants, and
attractions. The I-Drive trolley makes frequent runs up and down
the thoroughfare, hotels often offer family discounts (see Chapter
9), and many provide free or moderate-cost shuttles to Walt Disney
World, SeaWorld, and Universal Orlando.
 Sitter services. Most Orlando hotels, including all of Disney’s, offer
some form of baby-sitting services (usually from an outside serv-
ice) and several feature counselor-supervised activity programs for
children who’ve been toilet-trained. Baby-sitting rates usually run
$10 to $15 per hour for the first child, and often offer a discounted
rate for additional children.
 Plan ahead for character dining. If you’d like to eat a meal with
a cast of Disney characters while at Walt Disney World, make
Advanced Dining Reservations when you reserve your hotel room
(or even earlier as they book up quickly; see Chapter 10 for more
details about character dining). Once you’re in WDW, check the
daily schedule for character meet-and-greets (all the major parks
post the information on their guide maps or on boards near the
parks entrance) and make sure that the kids know when they’re
going to meet their heroes because doing so is often the highlight
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando 
54

of their day. A little planning can help you avoid running after every
character you see, which only tires your little ones and gives you
sore feet. And remember — the “in” thing is getting character auto-
graphs, so take my advice: If price is no object, buy an autograph
book at the parks (it doubles as a good souvenir) or buy one at
home and bring it along. 
 Keep tabs on the little ones in the land of Mickey. Getting lost
inside a theme park is easy no matter what your age. For adults and
older kids, make sure that you arrange a lost-and-found meeting
place as soon as you arrive in the park. Attach a name tag to younger
kids (on the inside of their clothes) and find a park employee as soon
as you’ve been separated from your party. I list lost-and-found loca-
tions in my descriptions of the major theme parks in Chapters 12 to
16 and 18 to 20. Consider carrying along a pair of two-way walkie-
talkies to help keep in touch with everyone.
 Pack to toddler-proof your hotel room. Although your home may
be toddler-proof, hotel rooms aren’t. Bring outlet covers and what-
ever else is necessary to prevent an accident from occurring in
your room.
 Stay safe in the sun. Don’t forget to bring sunscreen for the entire
family. If you forget, buy sunscreen with a 30 SPF or higher rating
before you go out in the sun. Slather your young children — even if
they’re in a stroller — and make sure that you pack a hat for infants
and toddlers. Likewise, make sure that everyone traveling with you
drinks plenty of water to avoid dehydration.
 Remember ride restrictions. Most parks explain their height
restrictions for certain attractions or identify those that may unset-
tle young children. (I also list these restrictions in my discussions
of the major theme parks in Chapters 12–16 and 18–20.) Save your-
self and your kids some grief before you get in line and experience
disappointment. Remember that a bad trip down a darkened tunnel
or a scary loop-de-loop can make your youngster cranky for the
rest of the day.
 Take time out for a show. Catching an inside, air-conditioned show
two or three times a day provides a nice break for everyone, espe-
cially on hot and steamy summer afternoons. You may even get
your littlest tikes to nap in the darkened theater. Be sure to arrive
at least 20 minutes early if you want good seats, but not so early
that the kids go berserk waiting. (Most of the waiting areas are out-
side, even if the show is inside.)
 Pack a snack. When dreaming of your vacation, you probably don’t
envision hours spent waiting in lines. Unfortunately, doing so is
inevitable. Store some lightweight snacks in an easy-to-carry back-
pack, especially when traveling with small kids. You’ll save yourself
headaches and money.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 55

 Bring your own stroller. Although you have to haul it to and from
the car and on and off trams, trains, and monorails at Disney,
having your own stroller can be a tremendous help. It’s with you
when you need it — say, back in the hotel room as a high chair, or
for an infant in a restaurant when a highchair is inappropriate. And
it’s an absolute lifesaver at Universal Studios Florida and Islands
of Adventure, where you face long walks from the parking lot to
the ticket booths. Your stroller should be lightweight, easy to fold
and unfold with one hand, have a canopy, be able to recline for
naps, and have plenty of storage space. The parks offer stroller
rentals for between $7 and $15, however, these are hard and
uncomfortable. They don’t recline and have little or no storage
space for kid gear. And they are absolutely inappropriate for infants
and toddlers. They are good, however, if you have older kids who
just need an occasional break from all the walking. For infants and
small toddlers, you may want to bring a snugly sling or backpack-
type carrier for use in traveling to and from parking lots and while
you’re standing in line for attractions. 
 Take a break. The Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld parks all fea-
ture some rather unique play areas that offer parents a rest and the
kids a place to continue to have fun. Schedule two or three visits to
these spots a day, depending on your stamina. Many of these zones
include water toys, and some parks have major water-related rides,
so packing a change of clothes for the whole family is a good idea.
Rent a locker ($5–$7) and store your spare duds until you need
them. During summer months, the Florida humidity can keep you
feeling soggy all day, so you’ll appreciate the fresh clothing, espe-
cially if you’re headed out for dinner afterwards.
 Plan playtime for parents. Walt Disney World and Universal
Orlando offer a ride-share program for parents traveling with small
children. On many “big kid” rides, one parent can ride the attrac-
tion while the other stays with the kids, and then the adults can
switch places and the second parent can ride without having to
stand in line again. Notify a staff member that you want to take
advantage of this program when you get in line.
Finding kid-friendly tours
Many theme parks design tours for the younger set that include great
sources of age-appropriate entertainment.
SeaWorld has justifiably earned its reputation as a park that makes edu-
cation fun with a variety of tours. One of the most interesting is the Polar
Expedition Guided Tour. This hour-long journey gives kids a chance to
come face to face with a penguin and get a behind-the-scenes look at
polar bears and beluga whales. Saving a Species, another hour-long tour,
allows you to see some of the park’s rescue and rehabilitation work with
several species, including manatees and rare sea turtles. And shark fans
will enjoy the Predators tour. All tours are kid-friendly, although the latter
two may appeal more to older children. SeaWorld tours are offered on
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando

a first-come, first-served basis, so reserve a place at the Guided Tour
Information desk when you enter the park. They cost $15 per adult,
$12 ages 3 to 9, in addition to park admission ($60 adults, $48 kids). Call
% 800-406-2244 or go to www.seaworld.com for more information.

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors 
Although Orlando is kid and family oriented, many of its hotels, restau-
rants, and attractions also roll out the red carpet for older travelers,
especially those coming with grandkids. The theme parks don’t offer 
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 57
More fun options for kids
Many of Disney’s resorts offer special options for the young set. Here’s just a sampling
of the best programs for kids:
 Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort offers a Pirate Cruise Adventure, where children
ages 4 to 10 depart from the Grand Floridian Marina to visit exotic “ports of call”
to follow clues and collect “buried treasure.” Most kids will have a jolly good time.
It’s offered Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. and the $28
price tag includes lunch. Grand Adventures in Cooking invites up to 12 youngsters,
3 to 10 years old, to make dessert in a two-hour decorating class ($20 per child,
usually Tues and Fri). The Wonderland Tea Party gives kids the same age a one-
hour primer in cupcake decorating — with their fingers! They also feast on heart-
shaped PBJs and sip apple juice “tea” while they play with Alice and the Mad
Hatter ($23 per child, weekdays).
 Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge features daily Junior Researcher (animal famil-
iarization) and Junior Chef (cookie decorating) enrichment programs that are free
for children staying at the lodge, as is the nightly African storytelling. Both pro-
grams are geared to potty-trained children ages 3 to 9; if you’re interested, ask
about them at check-in.
 At Disney’s Wilderness Lodge, you can take advantage of a special family option
that both kids and adults enjoy: The Flag Family program. If you’re selected, the
entire family can traipse up to the Wilderness Lodge’s roof in the morning (times
seem to vary, so ask) and raise the American flag that flies over the resort. You
get a picture, a certificate, and a fabulous view. If you’re interested, ask at the
front desk upon check-in.
For information on all of the above programs, call % 407-827-4321 or surf the Net to

Accessing Orlando: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
A disability need not prevent you from savoring the magic of Orlando and
Walt Disney World. Many of the city’s attractions and hotels are designed
to accommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities, from specially
equipped guest rooms to audio aids for the sight impaired. A little advance
research and planning, however, is a smart idea.
Finding accommodating lodgings
Every hotel and motel in Florida is required by law to maintain a special
room (or rooms) equipped for wheelchairs, but keep in mind that the
law is being phased-in over time, so some hotels may not yet have
rooms for those with disabilities. A few have wheel-in showers. Walt
Disney World’s Coronado Springs Resort (% 407-934-1000), which
opened in 1997, maintains 99 rooms that are designed to accommodate
guests with disabilities, so make your special needs known when making
reservations. For other information about special Disney rooms, call
% 407-939-7807.

If you don’t mind staying 15 minutes from Disney, Yvonne’s Property
Management (% 877-714-1144 or 863-424-0795; www.villasinorlando.
com) is a rental agency for, among other things, some handicapped-
accessible homes that have multiple-bedrooms, multiple-baths including
accessible showers, full kitchens, and pools outfitted with lifts. Most
cost less than $200 a night and are located in Davenport.
Getting around
Public buses in Orlando have hydraulic lifts and restraining belts for
wheelchairs, and they serve Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, shopping
areas, and downtown Orlando. When staying on Disney property, you
can use shuttle buses that accommodate wheelchairs.
If you need to rent a wheelchair or an electric scooter for your visit,
Walker Medical & Mobility Products will deliver one to your room; it
offers a model that accommodates guests weighing up to 375 pounds that
fits into Disney’s transports and monorails and into rental cars. For more
information, call % 888-726-6837 or 407-518-6000; or visit Walker’s Web
site at www.walkermobility.com. You can also rent conventional and
electric chairs daily at the theme parks (see Chapters 12–16 and 18–20).
Many of the major car-rental companies now offer hand-controlled cars
for drivers with disabilities. See the Appendix in the back of the book for
the major rental companies’ toll-free numbers and Web sites. Avis Rent-
a-Car has an Avis Access program that offers such services as a dedicated
24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers with special
travel needs; special car features such as swivel seats, spinner knobs,
and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) can provide you with
redcap service, wheelchair assistance, and special seats if you give 72-
hour notice. Travelers with disabilities also are entitled to a 15 percent
discount off the lowest available adult coach fare. Documentation from a
doctor or an ID card proving your disability is required, however. Amtrak
also provides wheelchair-accessible sleeping accommodations on its long-
distance trains. Amtrak permits service dogs aboard, and they travel free.
TTY service also is available at % 800-523-6590 or by writing to P.O. Box
7717, Itasca, IL 60143.
Greyhound (% 800-752-4841; www.greyhound.com) allows a physically
challenged passenger to travel with a companion for a single fare. When
you call 48 hours in advance, the bus line also arranges assistance along
the route of your trip. It also permits service dogs aboard.
Maneuvering through theme parks
All the parks offer parking as close as possible to the entrance for
people with disabilities. Tell the parking booth attendant about your
special needs, and he or she can direct you to the appropriate spot.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 59

Each park’s guide map tells you what to expect when you arrive. Most
theme-park rides and shows, especially the newer ones, are designed to
be accessible to a wide variety of guests. Likewise, theme parks often
give people in wheelchairs (and their parties) preferential treatment so
that they can avoid long lines. If you need crutches or suffer from some
other medical problem that may restrict your mobility in any way, you’re
probably better off renting a wheelchair; the amount of walking you
need to do in the parks may wear you down quickly. You can rent wheel-
chairs at most major Orlando attractions, but you’ll probably be more
comfortable in your chair from home (and will save some money, too).
Keep in mind, however, that wheelchairs wider than 241⁄2 inches may make
navigating through some attractions difficult. And crowds can make get-
ting around tough for any guest.
Walt Disney World
The Magic Mickster offers a Guidebook for Guests with Disabilities that
details many services. Disney no longer mails them prior to visits, but
you can pick one up at Guest Relations near the entrances of the four
parks. They’re also available at some resorts. You can also call % 407-
824-4321 or % 407-824-2222 for answers to questions about special
needs. For accessibility issues relating to the WDW resorts, call % 407-
939-7807. A special link at the bottom of Disney’s Web site at www.
disneyworld.com leads to a host of information for those with dis-
abilities. Examples of Disney services include the following:
 Almost all Disney resort hotels have rooms for people with 
disabilities.
 You can find Braille directories inside the Magic Kingdom in front of
City Hall, and at Guest Relations in the other parks (a $25 refundable
deposit is required). You can pick up complimentary guided-tour
audiocassette tapes and recorders (a $25 refundable deposit is
required) at Guest Relations to assist visually impaired guests.
 Assisted-listening devices are available to amplify the audio at
selected attractions at WDW parks. At some attractions, guests also
can get handheld wireless receivers that display captions about
those attractions. (Both services are free but require a $25 refund-
able deposit). Inquire at Guest Relations inside each park.
 Sign translation is available for most of Disney’s live shows on a
rotating schedule: Mondays and Thursdays at the Magic Kingdom,
Tuesdays and Fridays at Epcot, Sundays and Wednesdays at
Disney–MGM Studios, and Saturdays at Disney’s Animal Kingdom.
Guests desiring sign translation should call Disney at % 407-824-
4321 (voice) or 407-827-5141 (TTY) at least two weeks in advance.
 Several attractions inside the major parks offer special closed-
captioned LED screens for the hearing-impaired. Inquire at Guest

Relations inside each park for the list of attractions currently offer-
ing this option.
 Service animals are allowed in all parks and on some rides.
Universal Orlando
If you’re physically challenged, go to Guest Services, located just inside the
main entrances of Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, to
get a Riders Guide, a Telecommunications Relay System (TTY), or other
special assistance. You can rent wheelchairs from the concourse area of
the parking garage. Wheelchairs can navigate the entry lines at all attrac-
tions with the exception of Back to the Future, which has a special access
entrance. Universal also provides audio descriptions on cassette for visu-
ally impaired guests and has sign-language guides and scripts for its
shows. (Advance notice is required; call % 800-837-2273 or 407-363-8000
for details, or check each park’s Web site at www.universalorlando.com
for details.) Sign language–interpreting services are available at Universal
Studios Florida or Islands of Adventure, at no charge. Arrangements for
an appointment with an interpreter should be made one to two weeks
in advance by contacting the Sign Language Services Department at
% 888-519-4899 (toll-free TTY), 407-224-4414 (local TTY), or 407-224-5929
(voice).
SeaWorld
SeaWorld provides a guide booklet for guests with disabilities, although
most of its attractions are accessible to people in wheelchairs. You can
pick one up at Guest Services inside the park or download it at www.sea
worldorlando.com. SeaWorld also provides a Braille guide for the visu-
ally impaired and a very brief synopsis of its shows for the hearing
impaired. Sign language–interpreting services are available at no charge,
but must be reserved by calling % 407-363-2414 at least a week in
advance of your visit. Assisted-listening devices are available at select
attractions for a $20 refundable deposit. For a complete rundown on all
of your options, head to Guest Services when you enter the park; you can
also call % 407-351-3600 for more information.
Advice for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
The popularity of Orlando as a destination for gay and lesbian travelers
is apparent in the development of the Gay Day Celebration at Disney
World into Gay Days weekend festivities. Gay- and lesbian-related
events also take place at Universal and SeaWorld. These festivals are
scheduled the first weekend in June and draw tens of thousands of gay
and lesbian travelers to Central Florida. Find information at www.gay
day.com or www.gaydays.com.
You also can get information about events for Gay Days and for
events that occur throughout the year from Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual
Community Services of Central Florida, 934 N. Mills Ave., Orlando, FL
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 61

32803 (% 407-228-8272; www.glbcc.org). Welcome packets usually
include the latest issue of Triangle, dedicated to gay and lesbian issues,
a calendar of events pertaining to Florida’s gay and lesbian community,
and information and ads for the area’s clubs. Gay Orlando Network
(www.gayorlando.com) is another good resource.
Both the entertainment industry and theme parks have helped build a
strong gay and lesbian community in Orlando. Same-sex dancing is
acceptable at most clubs at WDW’s Pleasure Island, especially the large
and very popular Mannequins Dance Club. Many of Universal’s CityWalk
establishments are similarly gender blind. The tenor of crowds can
change, however, depending on what tour is in town, so respect your
own intuition.
If you’re interested in sampling some of the other local gay and lesbian
hot spots, check out the following places:
 The Club at Firestone, 578 N. Orange Ave. at Concord Street, in a
converted garage that still bears the Firestone sign (% 407-426-
0005; www.clubatfirestone.com). Go-go boys dance on lifts 
converted into raised platforms, and a diverse group boogies on
the large concrete floor. This is a serious dance club, with dark
lighting, cavernous rooms, and a high-energy atmosphere, which
also sometimes features well-known DJs. Saturdays are the best day
to visit for a heavy gay-centric crowd. It’s open daily from 9 p.m. to
2 a.m. The cover charge varies from $5 to $10. Limited lot parking is
available for $3 to $5.
 Parliament House, 410 N. Orange Blossom Trail just west of down-
town (% 407-425-7571; www.parliamenthouse.com). This resort
is one of Orlando’s wilder, and most popular, gay spots, although
it’s not particularly fancy and not in the best neighborhood in
town. It is, however, a popular place to drink, dance, and watch
shows that include female impersonators and male revues. The
Parliament House has six bars and clubs. Its disco opens daily at
9 p.m., except on Sunday when things start up at 3 p.m.; show
times vary. Cover charges vary but usually don’t rise above $10.
 Southern Nights, 375 S. Bumby Ave. between Anderson Street and
Colonial Drive (% 407-898-0424; www.southern-nights.com).
Voted “Best Gay Bar” by readers of a local alternative weekly paper,
Southern Nights offers theme nights for women on Saturday and for
men on Friday. Female-impersonator shows are featured during the
week. At press time, it was closed for major renovations, but it’s
due to reopen in 2006. In the past it was open nightly, hours varying
according to event. Cover charges vary but usually don’t rise above
$10. Self-parking is free, while valet parking costs $5.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA) (% 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for

the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of 
gay- and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to their Web site and click
on “Members.”
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and operated
travel service. Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or 510-655-
0364; www.olivia.com) charters entire resorts and ships for exclusive
lesbian vacations and offers smaller group experiences for both gay and
lesbian travelers.
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores, or you can order them from Giovanni’s
Room bookstore, 1145 Pine St., Philadelphia, PA 19107 (% 215-923-2960;
www.giovannisroom.com); Out and About (% 800-929-2268 or 415-
644-8044; www.outandabout.com), which offers guidebooks and a
newsletter ($20/year; 10 issues) packed with solid information on the
global gay and lesbian scene; Spartacus International Gay Guide
(Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide) and
Odysseus, both good, annual English-language guidebooks focused on
gay men; the Damron guides (www.damron.com), with separate, annual
books for gay men and lesbians; and Gay Travel A to Z: The World of
Gay & Lesbian Travel Options at Your Fingertips by Marianne Ferrari
(Ferrari International; Box 35575, Phoenix, AZ 85069), a very good gay
and lesbian guidebook series.

Remaining Details

 Dealing with illness away from home
 Staying in touch using the Web and cellphones
 Getting through airport security
You’re almost ready to leave for Orlando. All you need to do is take
care of a few last-minute details, plan an itinerary, put the dog in
the kennel, stuff your bags with everything that’s clean, water the gerani-
ums, pay the mortgage, and finish 50 other 11th-hour musts.
The information in this chapter gives you planning tips and saves you
from wasting precious vacation hours after you’re in Magic Mickeyville.
You can discover whether it’s worth your while to rent a car, get advice
about buying travel insurance, check out your options should you get
sick on your trip, find out how to keep in touch with your relatives back
home, and figure out how to navigate your way through today’s airline
security procedures.
Renting a Car — Or Not
First off, you have to decide whether you need a rental car for your
Orlando vacation. If you’re going to spend most of your time at a resort,
especially Walt Disney World, you may not need a car. Disney has its
own free transportation system; buses, ferries, trams, and monorails run
throughout the property, connecting all its resorts, parks, and entertain-
ment venues. (See Chapter 8 for more information about the Disney
transportation system.)
The Disney system does have some notable drawbacks: You’re a pris-
oner of WDW’s often slow and indirect schedule. Depending on your
starting point and your destination, it can take up to an hour to get

where you’re going. During peak hours in the busiest seasons, you may
have trouble getting a seat on the bus, so keep that in mind if you’re
traveling with kids, seniors, or with companions with disabilities. Also,
if you’re bringing along children and strollers, consider the frustration
factor of loading and unloading strollers and all their paraphernalia on
and off buses, ferries, and trams.
If you plan to spend most of your time at Universal Orlando and stay at
one of its resorts, a rental car may also be unnecessary. All of Universal’s
resorts offer boat transportation to its theme parks and CityWalk (See
Chapters 18 and 19 for more on Universal’s theme parks).
If you won’t be spending all your time solely at either WDW or Universal,
and you want to visit SeaWorld and other attractions or areas of Central
Florida, you need to either rent a car or choose an alternate form of trans-
portation, such as one of a number of hotel shuttles. (Some are free;
others charge an average of $7–$12 per person.) Mears Transportation,
which is a shuttle service, and taxis (though horridly expensive) are other
options. (See Chapter 8 for more information on transportation options in
Orlando, including the I-Ride Trolley.) Getting several people to the parks
on a daily basis can be expensive if you choose these routes, but you can
save on car-rental fees, gas, and the $8 or $9-per-day parking fee at the
major attractions if you take advantage of Orlando’s transit system. You
need to decide whether the added convenience and mobility of a rental
car is worth the extra expense; if you plan to be in Orlando only for a
short while or are traveling with kids, I definitely recommend you shell
out for the car in order to maximize your vacation mobility.
WDW has an Alamo car-rental desk (% 800-327-2996) right on property,
so if you’re interested in renting only for a day or two instead of your
entire vacation, this may be a good option for you.
Getting a good rate
Car rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Doing a little research may save you hundreds of dollars.
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask whether the rate is the same for pickup Friday morn-
ing as it is for Thursday night.
 Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if you don’t return
the car to the same rental location; others, notably National, don’t.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport.
 Find out whether age is an issue. For drivers under 25, many car-
rental companies add on a fee, while some don’t rent to them at all.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 65

Under-age rental fees are common in Orlando and can add as much
as $15 a day to your total rate.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate; otherwise you may be charged the stan-
dard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA,
AARP, and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to
discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or at
least most-used) airlines likely to have sent you discount coupons,
but most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the
major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia
(www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter Living
(www.smarterliving.com), for example — have search engines that
can dig up discounted car-rental rates. 
Most car-rental companies charge on a 24-hour basis. That means if you
pick up the car at 3 p.m., you need to return it by 3 p.m. on the specified
end date of your rental. Often, if your flight arrival and departure times
in Orlando are far apart (say you arrive at 10 a.m. and don’t fly out until
8 p.m.), you need to rent the car for a day longer than your stay. However,
if the inbound and outbound flight times are within an hour or two of each
other, inquire about hourly rates — they may be less than the cost of
another full day. If you want information about specific rental-car compa-
nies serving Orlando, see the Appendix in the back of this book.
Adding up extra rental costs
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). The
Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for damage
to the car in a collision, is covered by many credit-card companies.
Check with your credit-card company before you go so you can avoid
paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal-effects insurance (if your
luggage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at
home probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if
your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your
car-rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around
the Hope diamond, and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk
anyway, you can probably skip the personal-effects insurance, but driv-
ing around without liability or personal accident coverage is never a
good idea. Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and 
liability claims can be complicated.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando 
66

Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for
your initial full tank of gas up front and can return the car with an empty
gas tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you
don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this
option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car
with a full tank or face charges of $3 to $4 a gallon for any shortfall. If
you usually run late and a fueling stop may make you miss your plane,
you’re a perfect candidate for the fuel-purchase option.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is my advice on all
three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in Oct 2001 because they were wary of flying.)
A good resource is Travel Guard Alerts, a list of companies consid-
ered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travelinsured.
com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a
credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back on
goods and services not received if they report the loss within
60 days after the charge is listed on their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever, and avoid buying insurance from the tour or cruise company
you’re traveling with so you don’t put all your money in one place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check before you go, par-
ticularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost-luggage insurance isn’t necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 67

international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9 per pound, up to $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check
items more valuable than the standard liability, see whether your
valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage
insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package,
or buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy the over-
priced insurance at the airport. Be sure to take any valuables or
irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage because
many valuables (including books, money and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.

ers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com);

Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.
com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-
insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick can ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you.)
If you have a serious or chronic illness, talk to your doctor before 
leaving on a trip. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through Medic Alert’s 24-hour
hot line. 
Preventing the easily preventable
The biggest health obstacle you’ll encounter in Orlando will be the strong
Florida sun. Limit your exposure, especially during the first few days of
your trip and, thereafter, during the hours of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., when the
sun is at its strongest. Use a sunscreen with at least a sun protection
factor (SPF) of 25 (especially for children) and apply it liberally and often.
If you have children under a year old, check with your pediatrician before
applying a sunscreen — some ingredients may not be appropriate for
infants. A hat and sunglasses are de rigueur fashion in Florida for a
reason and keep you from suffering sun glare or a painful sunburn.
Dehydration is another potential issue when touring Orlando. Be sure to
drink plenty of fluids and see that any children traveling with you do so
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando 
68

as well. Note that soft drinks loaded with caffeine, a diuretic, can cause
or make dehydration worse, so stick to water or decaffeinated drinks.
Finally, the bane of many a theme park walker who hasn’t hoofed it any-
where lately are blisters. If you have problematic feet, bring comfortable
walking shoes, lots of socks, and buy some protective moleskin. A change
of socks mid-day may keep you from hobbling by nightfall.
Knowing what to do should you get sick
All the major theme parks have first-aid stations; ask a park employee
or consult your park map for its location. Doctors on Call Service
(% 407-399-3627) is a group that makes house and room calls in most 
of the Orlando area 24 hours a day.
To find a dentist, call Dental Referral Service (% 800-235-4111; www.
dentalreferral.com). They can refer you to the nearest dentist who
meets your needs. Phones are staffed weekdays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
If your ailment isn’t a life-threatening emergency, use a walk-in clinic 
in Orlando. You may not get immediate attention, but you’ll probably
pay around $75 rather than the $300 minimum for just signing in at an
emergency-room counter. Centra-Care (www.centracare.org) has sev-
eral walk-in clinics listed in the Yellow Pages, including ones on Vineland
Road near Universal (% 407-351-6682) and at Lake Buena Vista near
Disney (% 407-934-2273) among others.
You can fill your prescriptions at dozens of pharmacies listed in the
Yellow Pages. Walgreen’s operates a 24-hour pharmacy at 7650 W. Sand
Lake Rd. (% 407-345-9497; www.walgreens.com); for other locations in
the area, check the company’s Web site.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Want to tell the folks back home that you arrived safe and sound? Or
e-mail them that digital snapshot of your meeting with Mickey? It’s
easier than ever to stay in touch with your friends, family, even the
office (unlucky for you), while you’re on the road.
Using a cellphone across the U.S.
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it’ll work else-
where in the country (thanks to our nation’s fragmented cellphone
system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in Orlando, however.
But take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its Web site
before heading out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are particularly weak
in rural areas. If your wireless company doesn’t have good coverage in
the Orlando area, rent a phone that does from InTouch USA (% 800-
872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental-car location, but beware
that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more for airtime.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 69

If you’re not from the U.S., you’ll be appalled at the poor reach of our
GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used by
much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work in most
major U.S. cities; it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. (To see
where GSM phones work in the U.S., check out www.t-mobile.com/
coverage/national_popup.asp). And you may or may not be able to
send SMS (text messaging) home. Assume nothing — call your wireless
provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-case scenario, you can always
rent a phone; InTouch USA delivers to hotels.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility.
But even if you don’t have a computer, you can still access your e-mail
and even your office computer from cybercafes. It’s hard nowadays to
find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes. Although there’s no defini-
tive directory for cybercafes — these are independent businesses, after
all — two places to start looking are at www.cybercaptive.com and
www.cybercafe.com.
Inside Walt Disney World, you can find an Internet cafe inside
DisneyQuest, and you can also send e-mail at Innoventions in Epcot,
though you have to pay the park admission fees to use the Web termi-
nals. Payphones with touch-screen displays offering Internet access
have been installed at locations throughout Walt Disney World; you can
access your e-mail for 25¢ a minute with a 4-minute minimum.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most public libraries offer Internet access
free or for a small charge. Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re
willing to pay exorbitant rates.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout their
gates. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in shopping malls, hotel lobbies,
and tourist information offices, give you basic Web access for a per-minute
fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and
high price mean they should be avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
whether it has a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account.
If your ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web
service (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For
more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account
with Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World & Orlando 
70

If you are bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer access
is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), where you can get high-speed connection with-
out cable wires, networking hardware, or a phone line, and more and
more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless “hotspots.”
You sign up for wireless-access service much as you do cellphone service,
through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that have
made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and coffee
shops. T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up wire-
less connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nationwide.
Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set up
networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. Best of all, you don’t
need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s network; just set
yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The companies’ pricing poli-
cies can be Byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-connection, and
per-minute plans, but, in general, you pay around $30 a month for lim-
ited access — and as more and more companies jump on the wireless
bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more competitive.
You can also find a few free wireless networks. To locate these free
hotspots, go to www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/Wireless
Communities.
WDW offers Wi-Fi access and high-speed Internet connections to guests
at several of its resorts, and all Universal Orlando’s resorts offer high-
speed Internet access. Most business and higher-end hotels in Orlando
offer at least an in-room dataport and several offer Internet connections.
You can bring your own cables, but most hotels rent them for around
$10. Call your hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major Internet Service Providers (ISP) have local access
numbers in Orlando, allowing you to go online by simply placing a local
call. Check your ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how
you can use your current account away from home and how much it
will cost.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and two
hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an airline
employee and he or she will probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 don’t need
government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for inter-
national flights to most countries.)
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 71

In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
your home computer. To check-in online, log on to your airlines’ Web
site, access your reservation, and print out your boarding pass — the
airline may even offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk 
at the airport, bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your
frequent-flier card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and
simply proceed to the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo
ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you can
do so using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing
the kiosk system, but always call your airline to make sure these alterna-
tives are available. Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines,
although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go. 
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or unaccompanied children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine — but
security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring food
in your carryon rather than checking it, as explosive-detection machines
used on checked luggage have been known to mistake food (especially
chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the U.S. are allowed
one carry-on bag, plus a personal item such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop
bag. You can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a
laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal item. The TSA has issued a list
of restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp)
for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and re-lock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage
inspectors with a special code or key. For more information on the locks,
visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-
approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.

In this part . . . 
O
rlando isn’t New York or London, but it can seem over-
whelming at ﬁrst. Getting around the tourist areas and
downtown Orlando can be a little intimidating. Don’t worry,
though — it isn’t as complicated as it looks. In this part, I
walk you through the city’s neighborhoods, tell you where
to catch local transportation, and erase any confusion you
may have. 
Once you’ve got your bearings, I review the city’s best hotels
so you can zero in on a room that’s right for you. Then I detail
Orlando’s A-List eateries and give you lists of the city’s best
restaurants by price, location, and cuisine. And for dessert,
you get a thorough rundown of that most quintessential of
Orlando experiences — character meals.

Oriented

A
ll roads in Orlando don’t lead to Disney, although the reverse may
seem true to first-time visitors. Yes, you’d be hard-pressed to drive
along a street or highway without coming across a sign directing you to
Walt Disney World, but this abundance of directions doesn’t mean that
you won’t find other signs pointing you to the rest of the city’s high-
lights. In this chapter, you take the first step, getting from the airport
to the parks, and you gain some insight about Orlando’s “other” major
neighborhoods.
Arriving in Orlando
Unlike many tourist-oriented cities, Orlando’s airports do not lie in the
heart of the city’s action. But fear not — both of the cities airports are
relatively user-friendly, and getting to the any one of the theme parks is
a generally hassle-free experience.
Navigating the airport
While some of your fellow travelers (in particular, those unfortunate
souls who didn’t read this book) are aimlessly meandering through the
hallways of the Orlando International Airport (% 407-825-2001; www.
orlandoairports.net), you’ll zippity-do-dah to baggage claim and into
your chariot of choice. Though the airport itself is generally easy to nav-
igate, it’s usually quite busy, there are plenty of distractions, and it can
take you a while to get from point A to point B.

Follow the signs carefully to get from the terminal you land in to baggage
claim. (You may need to take the tram to the main terminal and then go
to Level 2 for your bags.) Note: If you’re arriving from a foreign country,
you have to go through Immigration before baggage claim and then
through Customs after picking up your luggage. 
If you need cash, ATMs are located in the arrival and departure termi-
nals near the three pods of gates (1–29, 30–59, and 60–99). ATMs also
are located where shuttles deposit you in the main terminal. If you need
to convert your pounds, euros, and so on to U.S. dollars, you can find
currency exchanges (open 9:30 a.m.–8 p.m.) opposite the ATMs at the
locations described above.
Most major car-rental companies are located at the airport (on Level 1)
with others located a mile or so down the road. Keep in mind that if the
company you choose is at a nearby location instead of right on-site,
you’ll need to take the shuttle to pick up your car. (See the Appendix in
the back of this book for the toll-free numbers of the major rental com-
panies.) You can catch hotel shuttles or taxis on the ground level of the
main terminal.
If you’re arriving on one of the newer regional or international budget
airlines that serves Orlando Sanford Airport (% 407-585-4000; www.
orlandosanfordairport.com), you’ll appreciate the smaller airport
layout. Baggage claim is downstairs, ATMs are found in the gate areas,
and most of the car-rental companies have locations right at the airport.
Finding your way to your hotel
The Orlando International Airport is a 25- to 40-minute hop, skip,
and long jump from Walt Disney World, depending on traffic, and 15 to
25 minutes from Universal Orlando and downtown. Mears Transportation
Group (% 407-423-5566; www.mearstransportation.com) is the major
shuttle player. It runs vans between the airport (you board at ground
level) and all Disney resorts and official hotels, and most other area
properties, every 15 to 25 minutes. Round-trip to downtown Orlando or
International Drive is $25 for adults ($18 for kids 4–11); it’s $29 for adults
($21 for kids) to Walt Disney World/Lake Buena Vista or Kissimmee/
U.S. 192.
Quick Silver Tours &Transportation (% 407-299-1434; www.quick
silver-tours.com) is more personal. You’re greeted at baggage claim
with a sign bearing your name. The cost is more than Mears, but it’s
coming for you, not other travelers, too. And it’s going only to your
resort. Included is an array of services, including a quick stop for gro-
ceries. Rates run $70 (up to four, round-trip) to I-Drive/Universal
Orlando and $90 to $100 to Disney. If you have a larger group (five or
more, round-trip) and require a van, the rates run $85 to Universal and 
I-Drive and $105 to $115 to Disney. A Selective Transportation (% 888-
784-2522 or 407-354-2456; www.selectivelimo.com) is another company
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
76

that offers a very high level of service. For $180, you get round-trip stretch
limo service from the airport to your hotel for up to eight people; the
price includes a free stop at a supermarket for food supplies, safety
seats for any children in your party, and a complimentary stuffed Mickey
Mouse for the kids. Cheaper shuttle rates are also available; check their
Web site for specials.
Taxis are another option when your party has enough people. The 
standard rates for Ace Metro (% 407-855-0564) and Yellow Cab
(% 407-699-9999) run as high as $3.25 for the first mile and $1.75 per
mile thereafter, although you can sometimes get a flat rate. A one-way
trip to the I-Drive area could cost upwards of $30 or more, to Disney
closer to $60, and to the U.S. 192 area, expect to pay around $50. Vans
and taxis load on the ground level of the airport.
A few hotels offer free shuttle service to and from the airport, so be sure
to ask when booking your room. Hotel shuttles load on the ground level.
If you’re driving from the airport with a rental car, you have two options.
You can take the north exit out of the airport to 528 West (a toll road,
also known as the BeeLine Expressway). Follow the signs to I-4, then go
west to exits marked for Disney (you’ll find three), and follow the signs
to the appropriate area. Your drive should take about 30 to 40 minutes if
traffic isn’t too heavy. Disney exits are clearly marked on big green signs.
This route is also best if heading to Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, or the
International Drive area. If your destination is solely Disney, you can also
take the south exit from the airport, which leads you down Boggy Creek
Road to SR 417 West (another toll road known as the Greeneway). Exit
onto 536 and follow the signs straight into Disney. This route has less
traffic but costs about an extra dollar in tolls.
When you’re traveling from Orlando Sanford Airport, a rental car is
really your best bet — even if you only rent it for the days you arrive
and depart Orlando (if this is the case, choose a company with locations
in or near your hotel for pick-ups and drop-offs). Taxi or shuttle service
from the airport is expensive; expect a minimum fare of $60 to the
Universal Orlando/International Drive areas and a minimum fare of $100
to the Disney and Kissimmee areas.
Upon leaving Sanford airport, exit onto Lake Mary Boulevard. From here,
you can take the 417/Greeneway exit and follow that to Disney. Or you
can go past that exit and take the one for I-4 West, which leads you past
downtown to all the major theme-park attractions. Again, the Greeneway
is the less traveled, faster route, but it’s a toll road. For either route,
expect about 45 minutes to the Universal Orlando/International Drive
areas and about 60 minutes to Disney (even longer if driving I-4 between
3 and 6 p.m.).
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Though the area encompassing the various theme parks and their
accompanying paraphernalia (hotels, restaurants, and so on) is almost
always referred to as Orlando, the region is actually made up of some
very distinct sections, several of which are not actually in Orlando
proper at all.
Walt Disney World
The empire, its big and little parks, resorts, restaurants, shops, and
assorted trimmings, are scattered across 30,500 acres, or a total area
of about 41 square miles. What you may find most surprising is that
WDW isn’t really located in Orlando at all — it’s just southwest of the city
proper, off I-4 between West U.S. 192 and S.R. 535. If you choose to stay
with Mickey you’ll find that convenience has its price. Accommodations 
at the mouse’s house can run as much as double the price of nearby
Kissimmee hotels and resorts. On the plus side, you get access to the free
Disney Transportation System (though at times that may not be that big
of plus) and a handful of perks and privileges (such as early park entry
and extra evening hours) that are extended only to Disney resort guests.
Also on Disney property is Downtown Disney, an area off to itself
encompassing three very distinctive zones: Downtown Disney West Side
and Pleasure Island, Disney’s two nighttime entertainment districts,
and Downtown Disney Marketplace, the nearby shopping district.
Combined, they’re filled with restaurants, shops, entertainment venues,
and clubs; each quite unique in its offerings, atmosphere, and price.
Downtown Disney is closest to the Lake Buena Vista zone described
later.
Even if you’re not staying or driving in Mickeyville, getting a map of the
Walt Disney World Transportation System is a good idea, so you can see
where everything is. It’s currently included in Disney’s Planning Guide to
Recreation, Dining, and Shopping, which is free and available at the Guest
Relations desks inside all the Disney hotels and theme parks.
Lake Buena Vista
Lake Buena Vista is Disney’s next-door neighborhood. It’s where you
find “official” (yet not Disney-owned) hotels, and it’s close to Downtown
Disney and all of its offerings. This charming area has manicured lawns,
tree-lined thoroughfares, and free transportation throughout the realm,
but it may take a while to get from Point A to Point B because of a combi-
nation of slow shuttle service and heavy traffic. There is a plethora of
shops, services, and restaurants practically at your doorstep, and all
within minutes from the Mouse. Although this area is not nearly as
costly as Walt Disney World itself, it’s generally more expensive than
International Drive and Kissimmee.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented

Celebration
Imagine an entire town designed by Disney, with perfect white picket
fences, tree lined walkways, and gingerbread trimmed houses. In
Celebration, Disney redesigned reality to reflect an idealized version
of Small Town, U.S.A. The 4,900-acre town has thousands of residents
living in beautiful colonial-and Victorian-inspired homes. Celebration’s
downtown area is, however, designed for tourists, though it does have
charming appeal. It’s filled with upscale shops, boutiques, restaurants,
and coffee shops, and it even has its own small, yet elegant, hotel.
Kissimmee
Way back before Mickey moved to town, Kissimmee was the hotspot.
Overlooked, in recent years, with the expansion of the International
Drive and Lake Buena Vista tourist districts, Kissimmee is being revived
and made more tourist-friendly with the addition of wide walkways,
landscaping, and improved roadways. Although still filled with some of
the tackier T-shirt shops and tourist traps in the area, some moderately
priced hotels and even a few luxury resorts have begun to spring up just
to the south. Kissimmee is only a short drive (roughly 10–15 miles)
southeast from the House of Mouse and, with plenty of modest motels
and resorts, it’s a great choice for travelers on a budget. The town 
centers on U.S. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, which, alas, is
perennially under construction.
International Drive
Known locally as I-Drive, the tourist mecca of International Drive
extends 7 to 10 miles north of the Disney kingdom between Highway 535
and the Florida Turnpike. From bungee jumping and skate boarding,
surfing to shopping, themed restaurants, more than a hundred hotels,
and a slew of shops, this stretch of road is the tourist strip in Central
Florida. It’s home to the Orange County Official Visitors Center and
offers easy access to SeaWorld and Universal Orlando. The northern
half of I-Drive beyond Sand Lake Road is already packed, and developers
continue to eat up space in the southern half, especially near the Orange
County Convention Center; south of the Bee Line Expressway (528) the
resorts become far more spread out than in the north. Traffic along this
route is perennially problematic, so be sure to allot plenty of extra time
if you’re traveling on it during the morning and evening rush hours.
Dr. Phillips
Once a non-descript residential area dotted with a few odd shops and
doctors offices, the Sand Lake strip of Dr. Phillips, just west of I-4,
has been developed into an upscale shopping and dining mecca. The
new mall complexes at the intersection of West Sand Lake Road and
Dr. Phillips Boulevard now host no fewer than a dozen fine dining 
restaurants. For a quiet and sophisticated dining experience, outside
the commotion of the theme parks, this is by far your best bet.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
80

Downtown Orlando
Right off I-4 East, Downtown Orlando is actually north of the theme-park
areas and is home to loads of clubs, shops, cultural attractions, and
restaurants. Dozens of antiques shops line Antique Row on Orange
Avenue near Lake Ivanhoe. Hotels in this area are mostly aimed at busi-
ness travelers, as this is also the commercial center of the city and isn’t
a convenient place to stay if visiting the theme parks is the major point
of your trip to Orlando. A few B&Bs draw couples seeking more sophisti-
cated surroundings, and it is a great place for a night out on the town. 
Winter Park
Just north of downtown Orlando, the quiet town of Winter Park is where
many of Central Florida’s old-money families call home (and where new-
money ones come to shop and dine). It’s noteworthy for Park Avenue,
a collection of upscale shops and restaurants along a tree lined, cobble-
stone street. Winter Park’s appeal comes from its sophisticated, yet
charming, upscale offerings and has little, if any, kid appeal. It’s defi-
nitely too far north to use as a home base if you plan on spending much
of your time at the Disney parks. If you want some quiet time away from
the theme-park madness, though, it’s a nice place to spend an afternoon.
Finding Information after You Arrive
After you’ve landed, your best and most immediate source for up-to-date
information is the concierge or the front desk at your hotel (especially
if you’re staying at Disney or Universal, as they’re more knowledgeable
than most).
If you’re in the International Drive area, stop for information at the offi-
cial Orlando Visitors Center, 8723 International Dr. (% 407-363-5872;
www.orlandoinfo.com), just four blocks south of Sand Lake Road.
Both the Orlando Weekly (distributed every Thurs) and Friday’s calen-
dar section in the Orlando Sentinel include plenty of tourist-friendly
information about dining and entertainment.
At Orlando International Airport, arriving passengers can find assistance
at The Magic of Disney (third level, right behind the Northwest Airlines
ticket counter) and Disney Earport (across from the Hyatt Regency), two
shops located in the main terminal. They sell Disney multiday park tick-
ets, make dinner, show, and hotel reservations, and provide brochures
and information. Facilities are open daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Also in the main terminal at the airport, you’ll find two locations each
of the Universal Studios Store and the SeaWorld Store, as well as a
Kennedy Space Center Store. All provide similar services with ticketing
and are open daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

Getting Around Orlando
Your major decision regarding Orlando transportation will be whether to
use Walt Disney World’s transportation system (which is truly useful
only to those staying at a WDW resort), use your own car (yours or a
rental), or stick to other means. The system that works best for you
depends on what you want to see, where you’re staying, and how much
time (and money) you want to spend getting around the city.
By Disney’s transportation system
If you plan to stay at a Disney resort or an official hotel (see Chapter 9
for more information about Disney hotels) and spend the majority of
your time visiting Disney parks, you can probably skip a rental car — at
least for most of your stay. A free transportation network runs through
Disney World. Buses, ferries, water taxis, and monorails operate from
two hours prior to the parks’ opening until two hours after closing.
Likewise, Disney offers service to Downtown Disney, Typhoon Lagoon,
Blizzard Beach, Pleasure Island, Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground,
and all the Disney resorts.
The advantages of using Disney’s transportation system include
 It’s free.
 You save on car-rental and gasoline charges.
 You don’t have to pay $8 a day to park in the theme-park lots.
(Note: Disney resort guests are exempt from parking fees at the
theme parks.)
 If your party wants to split up, you can easily head elsewhere while
others remain behind without being stranded.
 During busy periods when Disney’s parking lots may close (and this
does happen), those riding the transportation system will still get
to the parks.
Disadvantages include
 You’re at the mercy of Disney’s schedule.
 The shortest distance between two points is not always a straight
line. You may very well have to take a ferry to catch a bus to get on
the monorail to reach your hotel. The system makes a complete cir-
cuit, but doesn’t necessarily travel the most direct route for you.
It can take an hour or more to get somewhere that’s right across a
lagoon from you. 
 You must endure multiple stops, particularly on buses and at peak
periods, with crowds that may well force you to wait for the next bus.
 Parents may find herding young children and their accompanying
paraphernalia off and on buses exhausting.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
82

If you plan to travel on the Disney network, first verify with the driver,
the bell staff, or someone at your hotel’s guest-relations desk that you’re
taking the most direct route. Keep asking questions along the way. Unlike
missing a highway exit, missing a stop on the bus route means you have
to take another ride on the Mickey-go-round.
By car
Most visitors to Orlando — especially those staying a week or more —
choose to rent a car for at least a day or two in order to venture beyond
the parks. (Yes, there is far more to Florida than its thrills and theme
parks.) See Chapter 7 for more information on renting a car in Orlando;
check out the Appendix at the back of this book for toll-free numbers of
various car-rental agencies.
Orlando’s major artery is Interstate 4. Locals call it I-4 or that #@$*%^#!!
road, because it’s often horridly congested, especially during weekday
rush hours (7–9 a.m. and 4–6 p.m.), when it more likely resembles a
parking lot. I-4 runs diagonally across the state from Tampa to Daytona
Beach. Exits from I-4 lead to all WDW properties, Universal Orlando,
SeaWorld, International Drive, U.S. 192, Kissimmee, Lake Buena Vista,
downtown Orlando, and Winter Park. Most of the exits are well marked,
but construction is common, and exit numbers occasionally change. If
you get directions by exit number, always for ask the name of the road
as well to avoid getting lost. (Cellphone users can call % 511 to get a
report of I-4 delays.)
Despite the fact that when you look at any map of the area it will seem
that I-4 runs north to south, on road signs, it’s always listed as east and
west. To avoid getting lost, remember that I-4 west takes you towards
Disney World (and Tampa) from Universal Orlando, I-Drive and down-
town Orlando; I-4 east heads from Disney and Kissimmee towards
Universal Orlando (and Daytona).
The Florida Turnpike crosses I-4, near Universal Orlando, and links with
I-75 to the north. U.S. 192, a major east-west artery that’s also called the
Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, reaches from Kissimmee to U.S. 27,
crossing I-4 near the WDW entrance road. Farther north, the BeeLine
Expressway toll road (or Hwy. 528) goes east from I-4 past Orlando
International Airport to Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center.
The East-West Expressway (also known as Hwy. 408) is another toll road
that runs from I-4 near downtown east to SR 50 by the University of
Central Florida. The final major toll road, SR 417 (also known as the
Greeneway), partially encircles the eastern edge of Orlando starting at 
I-4 just south of Disney and winds past the southern edge of Orlando
International Airport before ending up near the northern edge of Orlando
by the Orlando Sanford Airport.
One of the area’s lesser known roads, Turkey Lake Road runs parallel to
I-4 and is often used by locals to avoid the heavy traffic of I-4 from WDW
to Universal Orlando. It starts as the Palm Parkway near Disney and
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83

turns into Turkey Lake Road just past the hotel area, eventually running
right up to Universal. It intersects with both Central Florida Parkway,
which takes you right to SeaWorld, and Sand Lake Road, which takes
you to both Dr. Phillips and the I-Drive areas.
Here are a few (in some cases, redundant) tips for driving in Orlando.
 Remember to allow for rush-hour traffic from 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to
6 p.m. daily.
 In Florida, you can turn right on red after coming to a full stop and
making sure that the coast is clear (unless signs say otherwise).
Consider yourself warned: If you’re sitting at a red light with your
blinker on and not turning right, you’ll probably hear horns blaring.
Make sure that your path is clear and then move it.
 Don’t try to drive and read the road map at the same time (it just
needed to be said).
 Posted speed limits are enforced vigorously. Fines for speeding begin
at more than $150. Pay particular attention to road construction
and school zones, where speed limits are reduced and speeding
fines are doubled — they’re not kidding.
 Remember the Name Game: International Drive is called I-Drive. Irlo
Bronson Memorial Highway is U.S. 192 or just 192. Highway 528 is
the BeeLine Expressway. State Route 535 is also known as Apopka
Vineland. State Road 50 is more commonly called Colonial Drive,
and Highway 417 is also known as the Greeneway.
 You must have a handicap permit to park in handicap parking
places. Handicap permits from other states are honored, but a dis-
abled license plate alone won’t do.
 Buckle up: Florida law says front- and rear-seat passengers alike
must wear a seat belt. This includes children, who, if younger than
age 5, must be restrained in an approved safety seat (seat belt or
booster seat) and, if younger than age 3, in an approved car seat. If
you don’t want to bring your own from home, most car-rental agen-
cies can provide one for about $10 a day.
 In an emergency, dial % 911, or you can reach the Florida Highway
Patrol on a cellphone by dialing % *FHP.
By taxi
Yellow Cab (% 407-699-9999) and Ace Metro (% 407-855-0564) are
among the taxicab companies serving the Orlando area. But for day-to-
day travel to and from the attractions or restaurants, cabs are expensive
unless your group has five or more people. Rates can run as high as
$3.25 for the first mile and $1.75 per mile thereafter, though sometimes
you can get a flat rate.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
84

By shuttle
Mears Transportation Group (% 407-423-5566; www.mears
transportation.com) operates shuttle buses to all major attractions,
including Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, and Disney. Shuttles also run
to Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral and Busch Gardens in
Tampa and it is also one of the most cost effective of all the shuttle serv-
ices available. (For more about great attractions just outside of Orlando,
see Chapter 23.) Rates vary by destination.
By trolley
The I-Ride Trolley on International Drive (% 407-248-9590; www.iride
trolley.com) runs every 20 to 30 minutes, from 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
(75¢ for adults, 25¢ for seniors, kids younger than 12 ride free; exact
change is required). An unlimited one-day pass also is available for $2
per person. The main route runs from the Belz Factory Outlet Malls to
SeaWorld with an additional route that runs along Universal Boulevard
from Sea World Road to Kirkman Road. Because of I-Drive’s heavy traffic,
the trolley is usually the best way to get around whenever you’re staying
or spending a good portion of the day in this area.
By motorcycle
If you have a valid motorcycle license, you can rent bikes at Orlando
Harley Davidson, 3770 37th St. (% 877-740-3770 or 407-423-0346; www.
orlandoharley.com), and American V Twin, 5101 International Drive
(% 800-268-8946 or 407-903-0058; www.amvtwin.com/orlando_
harley_rentals.html). Their inventories can be in short supply, so
call in advance. You must be at least 21 (and sometimes 25) years of
age, have a motorcycle license, and have a major credit card. Rentals
start at about $750 per week (or around $150 per day) and include hel-
mets, locks, and a brief orientation.
Reserve months in advance when you’re visiting during Bike Week —
in late February and early March — or Biketober Fest in mid-October.
(Both events are held in Daytona Beach, but many bikers still stay in
Orlando.)
By bus
Lynx (% 407-841-5969; www.golynx.com) public bus stops are marked
with a paw print. Some bus routes serve Disney, Universal Orlando,
International Drive, and the downtown area ($1.25 for adults, 50¢ for
kids ages 8–18), but they are slow going and not very visitor-friendly.
On foot
I don’t recommend traveling on foot anywhere in Orlando, but it is occa-
sionally necessary to walk across a parking lot or street. Be extremely
careful. With rare exception, this city isn’t conducive to strolling. Within
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

the safe confines of the theme parks, you’ll have no problems hoofing it
(in fact, you’ll be on your feet quite a bit), but walking anywhere outside
the theme parks is a thrills-and-chills experience most people would
prefer to avoid. Orlando is among the most dangerous cities in the coun-
try for pedestrians, according to a Washington, D.C.–based research
group. Wide roads designed to move traffic quickly and a shortage of
sidewalks, streetlights, and crosswalks are to blame.

W
here you plant yourself during your Orlando vacation determines
many things about your trip, including your itineraries, the
amount of money you spend, and your need, if any, for a car rental.
Deciding where to stay in the city isn’t easy because its 114,000 rooms
come in many different flavors: hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts
(B&Bs), and so on. Luckily, I show you how to narrow down your choices.
Getting to Know Your Options
Something you can take to the bank: Unlike the less competitive areas
of Florida, almost all hotels in Orlando — at least the ones listed in
this guide — have been either built or renovated in the past 10 or
12 years (though it’s likely renovations have been closer to within the
last 1–3 years), so you can expect reasonably modern trimmings. The
city sometimes seems like Chain Central, and you will find branches
of pretty much every major hotel and motel chain in the major tourist
zones, especially on International Drive and in Kissimmee. Note that
even the high-end properties tend to have a more relaxed feel than coun-
terparts in other cities thanks to the theme parks; you’re more likely to
see Goofy hats than Gucci ones here. (See the Appendix at the back of
this guide for a list of the major hotel chains’ toll-free numbers.)
Every hotel that I list in this chapter has air-conditioning and at least
one pool (or I tell you otherwise). Most have cable TV, and some offer 
in-room movies, Internet connections, and Nintendo for a fee. Likewise,
many have hair dryers, coffeemakers, and in-room safes. Almost all

hotels in the city (with a few exceptions that I alert you to) offer free
parking, but few these days throw in breakfast with your room rate
(most that do tend to fall on the lower end of the price scale). Most
places in Orlando try to make kids feel as if they’re Mickey’s favorite 
relatives and offer lots of little extras and amenities for families. While
that’s great for parents, Orlando (believe it or not) is the top honeymoon
destination in the United States, so there are plenty of places that cater
to the adults, too.
Avoiding children for almost any length of time during your visit is next
to impossible, but if you’re childfree and don’t relish the thought of
screaming kids in the room next door, there are ways to improve the
odds to your favor. The bad news is that the quiet definitely costs
you. As a general rule — Disney and Universal Orlando properties not
included — the more expensive a hotel is, the less likely you are to run
into children (but keep in mind that even the business hotels here still
cater to the family market in some form or another). Some of Orlando’s
B&Bs don’t allow children younger than 16 to stay as guests, and these
often feature luxurious rooms that rival those of the big resorts. If you
don’t want to spend the extra money, remember that few people spend
much time in their rooms anyway.
Price and location, when all is said and done, are the factors that really
decide where you rest your head for the night. Although you pay more
for the best locations, you may find these hotels well worth the conven-
iences they offer. The closer your hotel is to the things you want to do
and see, the less time and money you waste getting to your destination.
And that’s why the two major players in town are deserving of a closer
look.
Walt Disney World
Disney has the corner on the Orlando hotel market, boasting high 
occupancy rates even during slow times. There are 22 Disney-owned-
and-operated resorts and nine “official” hotels — those that are privately
owned but have earned Disney’s seal of approval — located on WDW
property.
Disney’s accommodations run the gamut from motel-style rooms to
grand villas with full kitchens. The decision to bunk (or not to bunk)
with the Mouse is probably the most important one you make regarding
your accommodations. To decide whether an on-property stay is right
for you, consider these facts: The benefits of lodging in Mickey’s back-
yard include:
 Unlimited free transportation via the Walt Disney World
Transportation System’s buses, monorails, ferries, and water taxis
to and from the four theme parks, resorts, and smaller attractions.
This also means you’re guaranteed admission to all the parks, even
during peak times when parking lots fill to capacity and many folks
not staying with Mickey are left in the cold.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
88

 Free parking inside theme-park lots if you choose to chauffeur your-
self. (Other visitors pay $8 a day.)
 Kids younger than 17 stay free in their parent’s room, and reduced-
price children’s menus are available in most restaurants.
 Access to some of the best hotel pools in all of Orlando.
 Resort guests can charge most purchases (including meals) made
anywhere inside WDW to their room. You can also usually have
them delivered to your room at no extra charge.
 You can purchase WDW park and attraction tickets right at your
hotel’s guest-relations or concierge desk, avoiding the often long
lines at the parks themselves. (See Chapter 11 for more on WDW
admission options.) You can also make reservations for dining and
preferred tee times at Disney’s golf courses through guest relations
or the concierge.
 No resorts are more convenient to the Disney parks and attractions.
 The Extra Magic Hour allows resort guests before- and after-hours
admission to one of the four theme parks. Disney distributes a
schedule that lists which parks are open extra hours on what days
and at what time (for information, see Chapter 11).
 Disney’s Magical Express transports you and your luggage from the
airport to your resort if you fly via participating airlines (currently
American, Continental, Delta, Song, United, Ted, and Northwest) to
Orlando International Airport. Your luggage will appear in your
resort room without you ever having to retrieve it from baggage
claim in Orlando. You will be transported (round-trip) to your
resort at no additional charge in a special Disney shuttle. Other
great perks include the ability to print your boarding pass prior to
departing from your resort, therefore avoiding at least one line at
the airport. This service is available throughout the Happiest
Celebration on Earth, which kicked off in May 2005 and will run
through late 2006.
The drawbacks of staying with the Mouse include:
 The Walt Disney World Transportation System can be excruciat-
ingly time-consuming and difficult to maneuver with young children
and all their paraphernalia.
 Resort rates are about 20 to 30 percent higher than prices at com-
parable hotels and motels located beyond the parks’ boundaries.
 You may wind up a prisoner of Disney, unable to avoid the stiff
pricing for meals, trinkets, and so on.
 Without your own vehicle, it’s difficult and expensive to leave Disney
property to experience the rest of what Orlando has to offer (which
is quite a bit).
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 89

Universal Orlando
Universal Orlando is actually a relatively new player on the Orlando hotel
scene and only boasts three properties (though plans to tack on at least
two more in the future have been drawn up). The Universal resorts are all
operated by the luxury Loews Hotel group and the standard of accommo-
dations is actually a bit better than the majority of those at Disney. If your
itinerary favors Universal Orlando, staying at one of its three properties
affords you some rather meaningful perks at the Universal parks.
The benefits of staying at one of Universal’s three resorts:
 Unlimited free transportation via water taxi from the resorts to
CityWalk and both Universal parks. 
 Unlike Disney, Universal Orlando’s smaller number of resorts
means everything really is within walking distance of the parks.
 Resort guests enjoy special privileges at the Universal Orlando
theme parks, including front-of-the-line access to rides and preferred
seating at shows and many restaurants from the day of check-in to
the day of check-out. This is a huge benefit, especially during the
more crowded months when lines can be excruciatingly long. All
you have to do is show your room key and you can bypass the reg-
ular lines. Additionally, guests are allowed early entry to the parks
on scheduled days. 
 Universal’s resorts all accept pets, so Fido or Fluffy can live the 
luxurious lifestyle right along with you instead of having to be 
relegated to a kennel.
The drawbacks of staying at the Universal resorts are as follows:
 While there is shuttle service to SeaWorld and Wet ’n Wild from
the resorts, you’ll have to arrange your own transportation if you
want to set foot on Disney property.
 Resort rates are at least 30 percent higher than at comparable
hotels and motels (though, honestly, few are really comparable)
located even a block from the parks. You won’t find anything for
under $100 a night.
 As when staying at a Disney resort, you’re subjected to higher
prices for dining and other vacation necessities.
 Universal resorts don’t offer free parking (it costs $6 a day), which
is a universal perk everywhere else in the theme-park zones!
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the published (and usually the maximum) rate a hotel
charges for a room. It’s the rate you get if you walk in off the street and
ask for a room for the night. You sometimes see these rates printed on
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
90

the fire/emergency exit diagrams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate and it’s likely
you’ll get one.
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-free
number and see which one gives you a better deal. Whatever you do,
don’t ever come to town without a reservation. Orlando is a year-round
destination, it has a heavy convention and business trade, and school
lets out during varying times of the year in other nations. If you come
without a reservation, you may find yourself extremely disappointed —
or even completely out of luck.
If you’re a student, senior, military or government employee (or retiree),
or a member of AAA or AARP, ask about discounts. The Orlando/Orange
County Convention and Visitors Bureau’s free Magicard (% 800-643-
9492; www.orlandoinfo.com) is good for a family of six and offers 
hundreds of dollars in discounts on accommodations, car rentals, attrac-
tions, and restaurants. The Entertainment Book (www.entertainment
book.com) is another good source for discounts on hotels, car rentals,
restaurants, and attractions. It costs $25 for the Orlando version, but
you will recoup your investment after using just a few coupons. 
As a rule, Disney resorts, villas, and official hotels don’t offer regular 
discounts other than for slight seasonal variations. WDW’s 2005 value
seasons or lowest rates were available from January 1 to February 16,
August 28 to October 4 (except Labor Day weekend), and November 27
to December 19. Regular season rates were available from April 17 to
August 27 and October 5 to November 26. Peak rates applied from
February 17 to April 16, and December 20 to December 31. While the
actual dates will shift a little (and those listed are for the value and mod-
erate resorts and vary slightly for the deluxe and vacation-club level
resorts), the same periods should apply in 2006.
One of the best ways to catch a break from Mickey’s prices is through a
travel package (see Chapter 5). Disney offers vacation plans that can
include meals, tickets, recreation, airfare, rentals, dinner shows, and
other features. Call the Central Reservations Office (% 407-934-7639)
or go to www.disneyworld.com to book both rooms and packages or to
get the lowdown on WDW, including vacation brochures and DVDs.
Before calling Disney to make reservations, take a moment to visit
MouseSavers (www.mousesavers.com). This unofficial Disney discount
site is extremely diligent about keeping up-to-date listings on all dis-
counts offered by Disney, whether it be room discount codes or details
on special package deals. Spending a few minutes looking over the list-
ings can save you hundreds of dollars when booking direct with Disney.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 91

When booking your room, don’t forget to allow for the area’s combined
sales and resort taxes. In Orange County (Orlando, Lake Buena Vista,
Winter Park, and Maitland), the tax equals 11 percent. In Osceola County
(Kissimmee/St. Cloud), the taxes add 12 percent to your bill.
When making your reservation, ask some pointed questions to make sure
that you have the best room in the house. For example, always ask for a
corner room. They’re usually larger and quieter, include more windows
and light than standard rooms, and don’t always cost more. Likewise, ask
which floor and side has the best view, if there is one, as well as whether
the hotel is renovating. (If so, request a room away from the renovation
work.) You can also ask about the location of the restaurants, bars, and
clubs in the hotel — these may be a source of irritating noise. If you
aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front desk. If
they have another room, they will likely accommodate you — within
reason, of course.
Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the
placement.
You almost never find a WDW resort on any discounter’s Web site. If you
want to book a Disney hotel online, you have to go through a packager or
Disney’s own Web site at www.disneyworld.com. Each individual resort
is listed on the site and information is available on rooms, rates, floor
plans, restaurants, recreation, and so on. The only hotels on Disney prop-
erty that you can book through a discounter are the “official” hotels.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia offers a long list of special deals and
“virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so you can see what you’re
paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that the best rooms
are often held back from bargain-booking Web sites). Travelocity posts
unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according to the
AAA rating system. Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An
excellent free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you
search multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard
of — and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
92

taxes and service charges. It covers a large number of Orlando’s best
hotels, and I heartily recommend giving it a try.
Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb), is partly owned by
the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and Starwood
chains) and is therefore plugged directly into the hotels’ reservations
systems — unlike independent online agencies, which have to fax or
e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good portion of which get 
misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers have arrived at the
hotel, only to be told that they have no reservation. To be fair, many
of the major sites are undergoing improvements in service and ease of
use, and Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into the reservations
systems of many hotel chains — none of which can be bad news for con-
sumers. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation number
and make a printout of any online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe and Asia, though it’s much
better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding
anything at the bottom of the scale. On the down side, many hotels stick
Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingforTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay up front, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not
provide loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-stay ameni-
ties when you book a room through opaque online services.
Arriving Without a Reservation
My first bit of advice: Don’t come to Orlando without a reservation. If
you do, you’re more likely to end up feeling like Grumpy than Happy.
This advice is especially true when it’s high-travel season and rooms are
both pricey and scarce. If you do, however, decide to head for Orlando
on a spur-of-the-moment inspiration, there are a few options to pursue
before setting up camp in your car.
The Orlando Visitors Center is related to the Orlando/Orange County
Convention and Visitors Bureau. These folks find last-minute rooms for
nonplanners. Room rates, depending on the seasons, can be a bargain.
However, you can get a room only for the night you visit the center, and
you have to come in person to find out what is available. The Visitors
Center is located in Orlando at 8723 International Drive, a mile west of
Sand Lake Road (% 407-363-5872 for information only).
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 93

Your only other option is to try the reservation service listed in the
“Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals” section earlier in this chapter.
Orlando’s Best Hotels
All the rates in this section are per night double, but many accommoda-
tions, including all Disney resorts, allow kids younger than 17 to stay
free with their parents or grandparents (as long as the number of guests
doesn’t exceed the maximum occupancy). However, always ask about
rates for kids when booking your room. Also, unless otherwise noted,
all the hotels in this section offer free self-parking.
To make it easy for you to recognize expensive versus moderately
priced hotels, each of the following entries includes one or more $ sym-
bols. See Table 9-1 “Key to Hotel Dollar Signs” for the meaning behind
the symbols. In general, expect higher hotel prices on the more upscale
digs as well as those in or near the attractions. Almost every hotel in
Orlando caters to families with children, but I list hotels, resorts, and
inns that are especially good fits for adults on the “Good for Grown-ups”
list found on this book’s tear-out cheat sheet.
Several of the properties in this chapter add resort fees that can range
from $5 to upwards of $15 to their daily room rates. That’s part of an
unfortunate but growing hotel trend of charging for services that used to
be included in the rates, such as use of the pool, admission to the health
club, or in-room coffee, safe, or phones (each hotel varies greatly). If it’s
a concern, ask if your hotel charges such a fee (and just what it’s for)
when booking so you don’t get blindsided at checkout. At some hotels
the fee is optional, and you don’t need to pay it if you don’t use the
amenities or recreational facilities it covers. 
Table 9-1
Key to Hotel Dollar Signs
Dollar Sign
Price Range
What to Expect
$
Less than $100
Accommodations at this level generally
include basic trimmings and limited space.
They also lean toward the no-frills side. Those
at the higher end may offer amenities such as
hair dryers, coffeemakers, cable TV, a midsize
pool, a kid’s play area, and continental break-
fast. If they’re multistory, they also usually
have an elevator.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
94

Dollar Sign
Price Range
What to Expect
$$
$101–$200
Lodgings in this price range probably offer a
choice of king-size or double beds, possibly
suites if they fall in the higher end, a full range
of amenities (hair dryer, coffeemakers, two TVs
in the two-room models, multiline phones and,
possibly, a modem line, VCRs, free daily news-
paper, and designer shampoos), and room
service. Rooms are slightly larger, and a
Jacuzzi and fitness center may accompany
the pool. The continental breakfast probably
includes fresh fruit, granola, and muffins rather
than day-old doughnuts and little boxes of
cereal. The hotel may also have at least one
palatable on-site restaurant. Some may have a
guest-services desk for purchasing attraction
tickets and making dinner arrangements.
$$$
$201–$300
Hotels at this level are sure to have a guest-
services desk, possibly a concierge. They also
usually include a large, resort-style pool, possi-
bly a second smaller or toddler pool, and multi-
ple Jacuzzi tubs (some of the higher-end rooms
have their own), a fitness center, and occa-
sionally a small spa. Rooms generally have
multiple phones, minibars, a bath and separate
shower. Many rooms are larger, some with
small sitting areas, a pull-out sofa, and large
work desks. Some hotels in this category offer
supervised children’s programs and activities. 
$$$$
$301 and up
Nothing in this price range is impossible. In
addition to the amenities in the previous cate-
gories, many of these hotels offer concierge
levels, extra-large rooms, spacious suites, 24-
hour room service, gorgeous pool bars, and
live entertainment in their lounges. Some also
include full-service spas, gourmet restaurants,
shopping arcades, and tight security.
Recreational facilities are usually extensive
and lavish. Many offer supervised children’s
programs and activities.

It’s tough to beat the value and roominess of these kitchenette-equipped
suites, especially if your goal is to be very close to the Universal theme
parks without having to pay the heftier rates that come with staying on
park property. The modern, spacious rooms allow you to stretch out more
than in standard hotel/motel accommodations, and the location is especially
convenient if Universal Orlando is your target. The free buffet breakfast is
a bonus.

A home away from home
If you want all the comforts of home or are traveling in a group of five or more, you
might consider bypassing hotels or motels in favor of a rental condo or home. Rates
vary widely depending on quality and location, and some may require a 2- or 3-night
minimum stay. A lot of these properties are 5 to 15 miles from the theme parks and
offer no transportation, so having a car is a necessity.
On the plus side, most have two to six bedrooms and a convertible couch, two or more
bathrooms, a full kitchen, multiple TVs and phones, and irons. Some have washers
and dryers. Homes often have their own private, screen-enclosed pool, while condos
have a common one.
On the minus side, they can be lacking in services. Most don’t have daily maid serv-
ice, and restaurants can be as far away as the parks. (There’s another reason you’ll
need a car.) Be sure to check and see if they offer dinnerware, utensils, or salt-and-
pepper shakers — it generally depends on the level of the home chosen.
Rates range from about $75 to $450 per night ($300–$3,200 per week).
All Star Vacation Homes offers an array of homes and condos, all of which are within
only 4 miles of Disney and close to all the areas restaurants and attractions. Homes
fall into a wide range of luxury and size. Many have private, screened-in pools. Call

safes, hair dryers, and TVs with Nintendo. Suites and studios have 
refrigerators and wet bars. Other amenities include a pool, Jacuzzi, and

restaurants are within walking distance. A free shuttle to WDW parks, and
transportation for a fee to other parks are available.

Set back from the main drag, this fairly new and welcoming hotel is one of
the nicest in the area. The lobby and accommodations — consisting of
studio and one-bedroom suites — are bright and inviting. The main pool
and the children’s pool, with an umbrella fountain to keep everyone cool,
are open around the clock. For entertainment, Old Town (a small-scale
shopping, dining, and entertainment complex) is next door, and a great
miniature golf course is located just in front of the property.

Kissimmee 
Just across the street from the La Quinta Inn Lakeside (see below) and up
the road from WDW, this clean, comfortable, place to stay has kept itself
modern and in good shape. The “suites” have a small dividing wall slightly
separating the living area from the sleeping quarters, but the illusion of
privacy is there. Accommodations are a bit bigger than most and can
squeeze in up to six. A bit of tropical landscaping gives it an inviting atmos-
phere and shelters guests from busy U.S. 192. At least 10 restaurants and
a small shopping plaza are within walking distance, and there’s a minia-
ture golf course right across the street. A buffet breakfast is included in

Crowne Plaza Orlando-Universal
$$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Sleek, modern, and upscale, this 15-story hotel is close to Universal
Orlando and SeaWorld (about midway between them), although getting to
Disney is no problem because the hotel offers free shuttles to all the major
parks. It’s also close to the I-Ride Trolley, making it easy to get to the many
attractions and eateries lining I-Drive. Subdued, but well appointed, rooms
offer floor-to-ceiling windows. Some of the pricier rooms are in the Atrium
Tower, where glass elevators climb to the top. Other perks include a fit-
ness center and heated pool. This place is geared to business travelers
and adults without kids in tow.

Disney’s All-Star Movie Resort
$–$$
Walt Disney World
Kids aren’t the only ones amazed by the, uh, aesthetics of this resort.
When did you last see architecture as inspiring as Goliath-size Dalmatians
leaping from balconies? If you’re not saying, “Oh, brother!” by now you
may enjoy all the larger-than-life versions of a host of other characters
from famous Disney movies (Toy Story, 101 Dalmatians, and Fantasia
among others) that decorate the buildings here, and the low (by Mickey
standards) rates will thrill some travelers. The All-Star Resorts that fol-
lows this listing are pretty much the same, save the theme — expect tiny
(260 sq. ft.) rooms and postage-stamp size bathrooms with few frills but
plenty of families. Either way you’re “on property,” and you’re enjoying the
lowest prices your Mouse money can buy. This All-Star resort has a family-
friendly food court that serves pizza, pasta, sandwiches, salads, burgers,
chicken, and family-dinner platters. Room service is very limited. Each of
the All-Star resorts features a main pool, smaller second pool, toddler pool,
and a very small playground as well as an arcade.

Disney’s All-Star Music Resort
$–$$
Walt Disney World
If you insist on staying on Disney property and are on a tight budget, the
rates at the All-Star’s are difficult to beat. But you’d better be prepared for
full-time family togetherness, as the mouse-size rooms mean you’ll be up
close and personal. (They’re about the size of what you get on a cruise
ship if you choose a midprice cabin). And if the idea of residing in build-
ings decorated with immense musical notes and other music-related
motifs doesn’t appeal, head elsewhere.

Disney’s All-Star Sports Resort
$–$$
Walt Disney World
Adjacent to the All-Star Music Resort, this 82-acre property is an instant
replay of its sister All-Stars. It draws sports fans looking for a vacation and
visual overload. The buildings feature football (huge helmets protect stair-
wells from rain), baseball, basketball, tennis, and surfing motifs. Amenities
include a brightly decorated food court, very limited room service, baby-
sitting (from an outside service), a guest-services desk (a standard at
Disney resorts), pools, and a video arcade. Like its two siblings (listed pre-
viously), the All-Star Sports Resort is fairly isolated in WDW’s southwest
corner. Renting a car is a far better choice than relying on the Disney
Transportation System if you want to get anywhere quickly.

Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
Disney’s newest arrival offers the exotic atmosphere of an African game
preserve. The rooms follow a kraal (semicircular) design, giving guests a
hit-or-miss view of 130 species of birds and 75 giraffes, gazelles, and other
grazing animals on the 30-acre savanna. The huge picture windows in the
lobby offer similar views, while the interior public areas are adorned with
authentic African artwork and artifacts. The rooms are quite comfortable,
although bathrooms are a bit cramped (a problem with many of Disney’s
properties). Two of the best and most unique restaurants (Jiko and Boma)
are located here. Not surprisingly, this resort is the closest you can stay to
Animal Kingdom, but almost everything else on WDW property is quite
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 101

a distance away. And although families appreciate the animals and wide
array of activities for kids (not to mention the bunk beds available in some
rooms and the supervised kids’ club), the more relaxed and sedate nature
of the resort also makes it a good spot for couples. A concierge level is
available.

Disney’s Beach Club Resort
$$$$
Walt Disney World
It’s only a brisk walk to Epcot from the Beach Club, which resembles the
grand seaside resorts that once dotted the eastern seaboard around the
turn of the 20th century. The Beach Club’s atmosphere is a bit more casual
than its sister resort (the Yacht Club, listed below) that shares its many
restaurants and recreational facilities. Though still upscale, brightly col-
ored beach umbrellas, seashells, and a casual Cape Cod feel permeate the
resort. Kids love the 3-acre, free-form, sand-bottom swimming pool of
Stormalong Bay, winding its way along the beachfront. Rooms can sleep
up to five, and views range from the pool to the parking lot. The villas,
added in 2002, sleep up to eight. Studios have kitchenettes, while the one
and two bedroom villas have full kitchens, washer/dryers, and whirlpool
baths. All units come with balconies. The BoardWalk, Swan, and Dolphin
resorts are just a short walk across the bridge, adding their own enter-
tainment and dining options to the mix. The proximity to the parks (MGM
and Epcot especially), as well as other resorts, makes it one of the best
upscale destinations at Disney, especially for families.

Disney’s BoardWalk Inn
$$$$
Walt Disney World
More than any other Disney property, the BoardWalk Inn appeals to those
looking for a sliver of yesterday. The 1940s “seaside” resort overlooks a
village green and lake. Some of the Cape Cod–style rooms have balconies
(rooms sleep up to five), and the corner units offer a bit more space.
Center rooms on the upper floors facing the lake have the best view of the
nightly fireworks at Epcot. Recreational facilities are extensive and include
two pools set in a lavish Coney Island atmosphere, tennis, fishing, boat-
ing, bike rental, and even a moonlight cruise. The villas sleep up to 12, and
the 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom villas have full kitchens, washer/dryers, and
whirlpool baths. The resort has a quarter-mile boardwalk reminiscent of
those once made popular along the mid-Atlantic seaboard, featuring
shops, restaurants, and street performers, which means you’ll find plenty

Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort
$$
Walt Disney World
This moderately priced hotel’s amenities may not be quite as extensive as
those at some of Disney’s higher-end properties (or those in the same class
outside the World), but the hotel still offers great value for families.
Grouped into five Caribbean island–themed villages, many of the rooms
offer views out over the beaches and the water. Standard rooms feature
two double beds, small bathrooms, and privacy curtains for a vanity area
with a double sink. The main swimming pool resembles a Spanish-style
fort, and most of the villages have their own basic pool as well. Other
pluses are a nature trail, small aviary, and a picnic area. The hotel also has
a restaurant, as well as a lively market-style food court. The closest park
is the Disney MGM–Studios, though it can take up to 45 minutes to get
there using Disney transportation — it’s probably best to rent a car if you
stay here. Note: When booking, ask for a recently refurbished room.

Disney’s Contemporary Resort
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
If location is a priority, the Contemporary has one of the best in the World
because the monorail literally runs through the hotel, allowing you a fast
track to Epcot or the Magic Kingdom. The 15-story, A-frame resort —
Disney’s first in Florida — overlooks the manmade Seven Seas Lagoon and
Bay Lake. The original rooms in this tower were built separately and then
slid into the framework, an unusual process befitting the futuristic archi-
tecture. The separate two-story Garden Wing buildings were added several
years later. Standard rooms are among Disney’s biggest, a plus for fami-
lies. The more expensive Tower rooms (which will undergo renovation
from 2005–2006) have the best views, and the higher floors tend to be qui-
eter. The pool area is virtually a mini water park, and many of Disney’s
watersports options are headquartered here. The hotel offers three restau-
rants, including one of the more-popular character meals (see Chapter 10),
and a health club.
This is the least themed of the expensive Disney resorts, and the décor
scheme could be described as business bland, so if you want an all-Mickey
atmosphere, stay elsewhere.

Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort
$$
Walt Disney World
The spirit of the American Southwest can be felt throughout this moder-
ately priced resort, which has a slightly more upscale feel than others of
its class. Rooms are housed in four- and five-story hacienda-style buildings
with terra-cotta tile roofs and palm-shaded courtyards. Some overlook the
15-acre Golden Lake; the better your view, the higher the price. Rooms fea-
ture two double beds (the décor differs in each section, but the layout is
the same), with a small bathroom and dual vanities set inside a separate
niche. Ninety-nine rooms are specially designed to accommodate travelers
with disabilities, and nearly three-quarters of the rooms are nonsmoking.
If you like to swim, you’ll delight in the Mayan temple–inspired main pool.
Dining options include a restaurant and a food court. The nearest park is
Animal Kingdom, but the Coronado is at the southwest corner of WDW
and a good distance from most other areas in the park.

Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground
$–$$$
Walt Disney World
This woodsy, 780-acre resort delights campers, but it’s quite a hike from
most of the Disney parks, except the Magic Kingdom (and even it might
feel far away if you use Disney transportation to get there). Even so, you’ll
have more than enough to keep you busy right here. Guests enjoy 
extensive recreational facilities, ranging from a riding stable to a nightly
campfire with fishing, biking, and swimming among the offerings. Secluded
campsites offer 110/220-volt outlets, barbecue grills, picnic tables, and
kids’ play areas. Wilderness cabins (actually, they’re cleverly disguised
trailers) can sleep up to six people; they also have living rooms, fully
equipped eat-in kitchens, coffeemakers, hair dryers, and barbecue grills.
Nearby Pioneer Hall plays host to the rambunctious Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical
Revue (see Chapter 24) nightly. The nightly campfire and marshmallow
roast, followed by a Disney movie, shown right in the great outdoors, is a
big hit with families.
Some sites are open to pets (the ones with full hook-ups), at an additional
cost of $3 per site — not per pet — which is less expensive than using the
WDW resort kennel, where you pay $9 per pet.

Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa
$$$$
Walt Disney World
You won’t find a more luxurious address — in a Victorian sense anyway —
than this 40-acre Great Gatsby–era resort on the shores of the Seven Seas
Lagoon. It’s a great choice for couples seeking a bit of romance, especially
honeymooners who aren’t on a tight budget. The Grand Floridian is Walt
Disney World’s upper-crust flagship, and it’s as pricey as it is plush. The
opulent, five-story, domed lobby hosts afternoon teas accompanied by
piano music. In the evenings, an orchestra plays big-band tunes. Virtually
all of the inviting Victorian-style rooms overlook a garden, pool, courtyard,
or the Seven Seas Lagoon; many have balconies and the “dormer rooms”
have vaulted ceilings. The hotel is one of three on the Disney monorail line.
The resort also has a first-rate health club and spa, as well as five restau-
rants, including the incomparable Victoria & Albert (see Chapter 10).

Disney’s Old Key West Resort
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
The peace and quiet of a remote locale away from the dizzying Disney
theme-park pace is just part of your reward when you stay here. This Disney
Vacation Club timeshare property mirrors turn-of-the-20th-century Key
West, though the theme is tastefully understated. Pastel colors and ginger-
bread trim adorn the charming buildings while palm trees are scattered
about providing a bit of shade along the beaches. Tourists can rent rooms
here when their owners are not using them, and they’re a great choice for
large families or long stays. The accommodations include studios, along
with one, two, and three-bedroom villas that have full kitchens,
washer/dryers, Jacuzzis, and balconies. Recreational facilities are extensive
and include beaches, pools, an array of watersports, a playground, video
arcade, and more. There’s a restaurant as well as a large grocery store.

Disney’s Polynesian Resort
$$$$
Walt Disney World
The 25-acre Polynesian Resort was built when Disney first opened its
doors and sort of resembles the South Pacific. Though it has aged, it still
offers one of the best locations — just across from the Magic Kingdom
and right on the monorail line. The guest rooms are reasonably large, and
most have balconies or patios, with bamboo and rattan furnishings. The
Tahiti and Rapa Nui buildings have rooms that are slightly larger, but they
are also the furthest from the main building, dining, and volcano pool area.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 105

Numerous recreational activities are available, including fishing and boat
rentals. The Spirit of Aloha Dinner Show (see Chapter 24) is the big nighttime
activity here, and Ohana is a favorite restaurant for families as it features
kid-friendly activities during the dinner hour.
Though the South Pacific theme may bring on visions of romance, many a
honeymooner who stays here is dismayed to discover the resort is over-
flowing with kids. Adults looking for privacy beware.

Flower power, the Rubik’s Cube, and Play-Doh still rule supreme at the Pop
Century Resort. Nestled behind the Caribbean Resort, near Disney’s Wide
World of Sports, this newest Disney value property is still a work in
progress, as only one section of the resort was open at press time. The
remainder will open in phases over the next few years. This value (Disney’s
word for budget) resort is perhaps the most fun for adults, who will enjoy
the many reminders of their past, including a bowling alley–shaped pool
and a three-story tall Big Wheel. The all-too-small rooms are in buildings
decorated with pop culture references from the last four decades and
mirror those at the All-Star Resorts in most every way. Forget frills — there
aren’t any; though, because it’s new, there’s been no wear and tear yet.
Amenities include a brightly decorated food court, baby-sitting, three
pools, and video arcade.

Disney’s Port Orleans Resort
$$
Walt Disney World
Port Orleans has the best location, landscaping, and the coziest atmos-
phere of the resorts in this class. This Southern-style property is really a
combination of two distinct resorts: the French Quarter and Riverside.
Overall, this resort offers some romantic spots and is relatively quiet,
making it popular with couples; but the pools, playgrounds, and array of
activities make it a favorite for families as well. The Doubloon Lagoon pool
in the French Quarter is a family favorite, with a water slide that curves
out of a Sea Serpent’s mouth before entering the recently refurbished pool.
The rooms and bathrooms (equivalent to all rooms at Disney’s moderate
resorts) are somewhat of a tight fit for four (the Alligator Bayou rooms
have a trundle bed, allowing for an extra person), but the vanity areas now
have privacy curtains. Boatwright’s Dining Hall (see Chapter 10) serves
New Orleans–style cuisine; there’s also a lively food court. Port Orleans is

Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
This new Disney Vacation Club timeshare property opened its first sec-

aren’t using them. It’s a good choice for large families or long stays. It’s
modeled after the luxurious upstate–New York country retreats of the late
1800s. The small, resort town of Saratoga Springs is evoked through lavish
gardens, Victorian architecture, a pool designed to look like natural
springs, and a country setting. The renowned spa offers a chance for relax-
ation and rejuvenation — both necessary after a day or two at the parks.
The accommodations include studios, and one, two, and three-bedroom
villas that have full kitchens or kitchenettes, coffeemakers, hair dryers,
and all the comforts of home. The property has a restaurant, playground,
video arcade, and four pools. The water taxi can transport you to
Downtown Disney for more evening entertainment options.

Disney’s Wilderness Lodge 
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
Here’s an option for those who like the great outdoors but prefer the com-
fort of an indoor resort. The geyser out back, the mammoth stone hearth
in the lobby, and bunk beds for the kids are just a few reasons this resort
is a favorite of families, though couples will find the surroundings to their
liking as well. The theme of the Great American Northwest is felt through-
out the lodge; its rustic architecture is patterned after a lodge at
Yellowstone National Park. The immense and winding swimming area cuts
through the rocky landscaping. The nearest park is the Magic Kingdom,
but because the resort is in a remote area, it can take some time to get
there. The main drawback is the difficulty in accessing other areas via the
WDW Transportation System. 
The 181 units at the adjacent Villas at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge were
added in November 2000. This is another Disney Vacation Club timeshare
property that rents vacant rooms. It offers a more upscale mountain retreat
experience, and more room than accommodations at the Wilderness Lodge,

phere. This property is geared more toward adults and families with older
children, although young kids are still catered to (you’re in Disney World,
after all). The relatively large rooms sleep up to five, and most rooms have
patios or balconies, although some views are of the asphalt parking lots.
The resort has two restaurants, an extensive swimming area that it shares

Set near the end of Palm Parkway, just off Apopka-Vineland, this fun and
welcoming all-suite resort is close to all the action of Downtown Disney

sleeps five and includes separate living area (with a pullout sofa) and

Hard Rock Hotel
$$$–$$$$
International Drive area/Universal Orlando
You can’t get rooms closer to CityWalk, Islands of Adventure, or
Universal Studios Florida than those at this California mission–style hotel.
This Loews resort is on par with WDW’s Animal Kingdom Lodge, although
its rooms are 15 percent larger. Rooms come with two queens or one king
and feature all the standard amenities. The giant outdoor pool with sand
beach and underwater sound system is capable of bringing out the lounging
rocker in you. Unfortunately, although the rooms are relatively sound-
proof, a few notes seep through the walls, so ask for a room away from the
lobby area if quiet is important to you. Camp Li’l Rock will keep the kids
entertained while also offering Mom and Dad the chance for some time off.
Free transportation is available to the Universal and SeaWorld parks. As
for Disney, you’re on your own. The biggest perk: Guests get no-line access
to almost all rides and restaurants at Universal’s theme parks.

Holiday Inn Nikki Bird Resort

Kissimmee
Here’s another great family base and the closest Holiday Inn to Walt
Disney World’s main gate. The resident mascot, Nikki, wanders the 26-acre
resort, which offers extensive recreational facilities and Camp Nikki, a
supervised kids’ club. Kids 12 and younger eat free with a paying adult
(two kids per adult) and are also treated to nightly entertainment, includ-
ing puppet shows, songs, and games. Standard rooms sleep four, while Kid
Suites have a separate area for youngsters. Suite themes vary. All accom-
modations feature refrigerators and microwaves. Transportation to the
WDW parks is free; it’s available for a fee to the other parks.

Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort Lake Buena Vista

Lake Buena Vista
Also close to the Disney parks, this Holiday Inn caters to kids in a big way.
They get their own check-in desk, can watch a movie at the theater in the
lobby area, or have fun at Camp Holiday, the supervised activity center (one
of the best around). The hotel’s spacious Kid Suites accommodate up to six
and have themes such as a space capsule, igloo, jail, and more. Standard
rooms are somewhat smaller and sleep four. All accommodations feature
refrigerators and microwaves. If you like sleeping in, ask for a room that
doesn’t face the pool area. Kids younger than 12 eat free in their own restau-
rant, though fine dining it isn’t (kids wouldn’t appreciate that anyway).

Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress
$$$–$$$$
Lake Buena Vista
A resort destination in and of itself, this hotel is a great place to get away
from the Disney-crowd frenzy while still remaining close to the action. You
need deep pockets to stay here, but the reward is a palatial resort with
lush foliage. The hotel’s 18-story atrium has inner and outer glass eleva-
tors, which provide a unique thrill. The beautifully decorated rooms offer
the usual amenities. Recreational facilities are extensive and include golf
(45 holes), 12 tennis courts (5 lighted), 2 racquetball courts, a spa, an
adjoining equestrian center, and more. The property’s half-acre, 800,000-
gallon pool is one of the best in town, with caves, grottoes, and waterfalls.
There’s free transportation to WDW, however you’ll have to pay to go else-
where. If you’re in need of a break, the kids can play at the supervised
childcare facility, one of the better ones around.

JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes
$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Opened in 2004, this Moorish-themed resort is situated on 500 acres of
lush, tropical landscaping at the new Grande Lakes development, just east
of SeaWorld. The guest rooms are on par with those in Disney’s moderate
class. Ask for a west-facing room for the best views. The smoke-free resort
is home to six restaurants and lounges and shares its recreational facili-
ties with the neighboring Ritz-Carlton (see later this chapter), including a
Greg Norman–designed 72-par golf course and a 40,000-square-foot spa.

Kissimmee
The hand-painted exteriors, lobby, and common areas of this recently ren-
ovated hotel give it a unique charm not found in its hotel brethren. Just
up the road from the Disney entrance, this 24-acre resort looks deceptively
small when you first pull up (most of the accommodations are hidden
behind the lobby area), but amenities include numerous recreational
options (pools, playgrounds, and so on), a food court, good-sized con-
venience store, and a bountiful, free breakfast. Rooms are standard in size
and offerings, but are nicely decorated and will comfortably sleep four.
Other pluses include a childcare facility and free transportation to all the
major theme parks. A continental breakfast is included.

Clean rooms, a heated outdoor pool, free continental breakfast, and free
shuttles to the Disney parks, all for under $50 a night, have made this prop-
erty a budget favorite. Some two-room suites are available at terrific prices
as well. There are two other Masters Inn properties in the Orlando theme-
park areas, but this one, nearest the Magic Kingdom, has received the 
ultimate approval for a property trying to get in good with Mickey — an
official stamp of approval as a Disney “Good Neighbor” hotel.

Nickelodeon Family Suites Resort

Lake Buena Vista
This all-suite property opened in July 1999 as the Holiday Inn Family Suites
Resort and does a fantastic job catering to families. A $20-million trans-
formation into an official Nickelodeon property, in 2004, has made it even
more kid friendly. The suites now feature Nick-decorated bedrooms for the
kids, complete with bunk or twin beds and a TV and video-console system.
The resort offers two sprawling pools with waterslides and flumes; pool-
side game areas and a game room; wake-up calls from Nick stars; daily
Nick-character breakfasts; a food court; and live entertainment featuring
the only Orlando appearance of the popular Nickelodeon characters out-
side of Universal Orlando. Most suites come with kitchenettes, but the new
three-bedroom units have full kitchens. The location — only a mile away
from Walt Disney World — is another plus.

Greg Norman, a vast pool area with its very own lazy “river,” a 10,000-
square-foot European spa, and much more. The beautifully-appointed
rooms feature 9-foot ceilings and a complete roster of amenities, including
plush robes. The service is as impressive as the facility itself, with a lengthy
list of guest services, including a program especially geared to youngsters.

facilities are first class, and its grotto swimming pool features waterfalls

golf course, as well as the dining and lobby areas. The large, comfortable,
and beautifully decorated rooms sleep four with options for larger parties
available. The upper floors facing Disney have great views of nightly fire-
works. The location, only minutes to Disney via a less-congested road,
can’t be beat.

Welcome to the home of the famous — drum roll, maestro, s’il vous plaît —
Marching Mallards. These real ducks march through the lobby into their
luxury pool each morning at 11 a.m. (no kidding!), accompanied by — what
else? — John Philip Sousa’s marching music and a red-coated duck master,
and then back out at 5 p.m.
The Peabody Hotel is located across from the Convention Center, in the
thick of all the action I-Drive has to offer, including attractions, restaurants,
and shopping. Guest rooms, even standard ones, are lavishly furnished and
come with numerous amenities. The Peabody offers not only the best serv-
ice in town but also some of the best hotel dining — look for its signature
restaurant, Dux, in Chapter 10. You’ll have to pay for transportation to all
the theme parks, so a rental car is a good idea if you want to stay here.
The Peabody is scheduled to begin a major expansion, which will double
its room capacity and add more family-friendly elements (which are lack-
ing), sometime during 2005.

International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Another Loews property, this one really delivers for those with deep pock-
ets. Inspired by a comment from director Steven Speilberg, who at the time
was working on a ride at Islands of Adventure, it offers six restaurants/
lounges, a spa, a beach pool with a fort and water slide, and a fitness
center in a package that’s convincingly designed to look like the
Mediterranean seaside village of Portofino, Italy. The accommodations
offer four-poster beds with cloud-soft pillows, and bathrooms outfitted
with marble tubs and tiled foyers. Rooms are state-of-the-art “smart
rooms” that provide security, adjust room temperature, and report mal-
functions as they occur. The hotel offers free transportation to Universal’s

Disney ones. Best feature: Guests get no-line access to almost all rides at

$$–$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Large rooms, good service, and a luxurious interior (a 10-story atrium
houses lush gardens, cascading waterfalls, a koi pond, and an elegant free-
flight aviary) are this hotel’s calling cards. Its most valuable feature, however,
is a location that’s perfect if you’re going to Universal, SeaWorld (it’s right
across the street), and, to a lesser degree, the second-tier I-Drive attrac-
tions. The beautifully decorated rooms are oversized, allowing for plenty
of space to spread out and relax. The Renaissance has four lighted tennis
courts, a health club, spa and sauna, and a completely renovated pool
area, as well as two restaurants, and arguably the best Sunday brunch in
Orlando. Transportation to the parks is available for a fee, though most
guests can easily walk to SeaWorld.

courses are currently operational with a third underway. A kids’ program
offering a variety of supervised activities is set to begin soon as well.
Future plans include two luxury hotels, additional villas, resort homes,

Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes
$$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Part of the lush 500-acre Grande Lakes Resort complex, this luxury resort —
styled like an Italian palazzo — opened in 2004. All the spacious guest rooms
feature dual private balconies, flat-screen TVs, and oversized marble bath-
rooms with separate bathtub and shower. For the ultimate experience,
upgrade to the Club Level to receive butler service, Bulgari bath amenities,
an in-room DVD/VCR/CD player, and free snacks. There are seven on-site
restaurants and lounges and the Ritz shares some recreational amenities
with the neighboring JW Marriott (see the review earlier in this chapter),
including a Greg Norman–designed golf course and a 40,000-square-foot spa.
The resort’s Ritz Kids program includes a children’s pool and playground,
separate check-in area, and on-site nanny service (for a fee). Kids’ suites
offer equally lavish accommodations especially designed for younger
guests. You will need your own transportation if you want to visit the parks
and attractions.

Royal Pacific Resort
$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
The newest Universal resort sports an attractive Polynesian theme that’s
the best of the bunch. Highlights of the property include an exquisite
orchid garden, five restaurants and lounges (one run by famed chef Emeril
Lagasse), and a lagoon-style pool — the largest in Orlando. The guest
rooms are smaller than those at Universal’s other hotels, but are com-
fortable and are far better than those at comparable Disney resorts. The
Royal Pacific isn’t cheap, but it offers good value for the money, especially
when you factor in the hotel’s free transport to Universal’s theme parks,
where guests get no-line access to almost all rides. One thing I could do
without: The outrageous $6 self-parking charge, especially when the park-
ing lot is quite a hike from the hotel.

children, as well as standard rooms and regular two-room suites. The
rooms provide a reasonable amount of space for a family of five, with the
two-room unit sleeping up to eight. There are plenty of family recreational
activities, from swimming to tennis, and the hotel’s movie theater shows
free family films nightly. There’s also a family-friendly food court, and kids
12 and younger eat free (two kids per paying adult) in the hotel’s cafe.

Lake Buena Vista
A Summerfield Suites in a previous life, this recent addition to the
Staybridge Suites chain is located just off Apopka–Vineland, close to the
action of Downtown Disney and the theme parks, as well as many restau-
rants. An excellent choice for families, this hotel’s room sizes, price, and
friendly staff are three more good reasons to stay here. Featured are one-
and two-bedroom suites (can sleep up to eight), all with full kitchens
(some two-bedroom suites have two bathrooms). The suites have large,
comfortable, separate living areas when compared to other all-suite hotels.
A continental breakfast is included.

Downtown Orlando
Located in Thornton Park, this inn near scenic Lake Eola is an option if you
want to stay near the downtown museums but not in a motel or hotel. Its
four buildings date to the early 1900s. All units (studios to suites) include
private baths and entrances; some have garden tubs, balconies, kitch-
enettes, and four-poster beds. The two-bedroom, two-bath Key Lime Cottage
($209) sleeps four and has a full kitchen. Rates include a continental break-

is a necessity for most guests. Note: Children are not permitted.

hotel, offer privacy not found in most resorts. You can play 45 holes of golf
on Jack Nicklaus–designed courses or take lessons at the golf academy.
The horse crowd loves the top-of-the-line equestrian center; riding lessons
and packages are available. (See Chapter 27 for more information on
riding.) The Mediterranean-style villas, which range from junior suites to
four-bedroom affairs, have patios or balconies, and Roman tubs. Larger
villas have full kitchens. There’s free shuttle service to the resort’s recre-
ational facilities and to the WDW parks. Unlike its sister Hyatt property,
this resort caters primarily to adults, but Villa guests with kids can use the
Hyatt’s childcare as well as recreational facilities.

Walt Disney World Dolphin
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World/Official WDW Hotel
What a wonderful place for folks a) not on a budget, b) wanting to be close
to Epcot and Disney–MGM Studios, and c) desperate to stay in a place
that answers the question: What kind of gingerbread would Dali have cre-
ated if he were an architect? It’s hard not to notice the massive, 56-foot
twin dolphin caricatures on the roof of this resort. Once inside the lobby,
you’ll encounter prints from the likes of Matisse and Picasso.
Rooms offer views of the grounds and parts of WDW and were upgraded
throughout 2004. The resort shares its extensive recreational facilities,
including a grotto pool with waterfalls, water slide, and whirlpools, as well
as a Body by Jake health club, and soon a new luxury Mandara Spa, with
its sister hotel the Walt Disney World Swan (listed later in this chapter).
The hotel offers free transportation to the WDW parks, but you have to
pay for a ride to the others.
Though it’s essentially treated as a Disney hotel, and guests get the same
privileges as a Disney resort guest, this one is actually owned and operated
by Starwood hotels as a Westin Resort. As a result you may find discounts
for this one that wouldn’t otherwise be available at Disney-owned hotels.
On the downside, it also means you get socked with a daily resort fee.

statues and seashell fountains. The Swan and Dolphin hotels are connected

by a canopied walkway and both share recreational facilities, including four
pools and four lighted tennis courts. The luxurious rooms are a shade
smaller than those in the Dolphin but have Nintendo games (for a fee), and
Westin’s signature “Heavenly Bed” (firm mattress, down blanket, comforter,
and five pillows). The resort underwent a major renovation in 2003 by orig-
inal architect Michael Graves, who redid the resort in tones of silver-blue
and white. You can get a free ride to the Disney parks and transportation,
for a fee, to the other theme parks.

Westin Grand Bohemian
$$–$$$$
Downtown Orlando
The Grand Bohemian has an early-20th–century Euro-Bohemian look. It
caters almost exclusively to the business and romance crowds, which
means you’ll find few children on the premises. Its rooms feature an Art
Deco motif, with plenty of chrome, reds, purples, and mirrors. The
“Heavenly Beds” (firm mattresses, down comforters, blankets , and five
pillows) are among the best in Orlando. The upper floors on the east side
overlook the pool; the north side faces downtown. The hotel, which is
smoke free, has more than 100 pieces of 19th- and 20th-century American
fine art. This isn’t the most convenient hotel if your vacation is solely cen-
tered on the parks, but it is far enough away if you need a break from all
the manic energy of screaming kids and adults in costume. Not to mention
the wonderful downtown nightlife right outside the front door.

Lake Buena Vista/Official WDW Hotel
The hotel’s spacious accommodations — most with lake-view balconies
or patios — are literally across the road from Downtown Disney. It’s an
ideal spot for honeymooners or those looking for a romantic weekend get-
away. Many of the appealing business-standard rooms have balconies or
patios; ask for one above the fifth floor with a “recreation view.” Because
business people make up 75 percent of its guests, the hotel offers some of
its best rates in July and August, contrary to the other Orlando main-
stream tourist resorts. Amenities include three pools, a fully equipped spa,
a sauna, a video arcade, and two restaurants, including the 27th-floor
Arthur’s 27 (see Chapter 10). Rates include free transportation to Disney;
you pay a fee for transportation to the other theme parks.

Dining and Snacking
in Orlando
In This Chapter
 Sampling Orlando’s eateries
 Dining options for the budget-conscious 
 Exploring the best dining in Orlando
 Sharing a meal with the Mouse and other characters
W
ith more than 5,000 restaurants in the Orlando area, there’s cer-
tainly no lack of dining choices. New restaurants are opening all
the time with just as many stale ones closing. Most are surprisingly decent
(Orlando is, after all, a city where food tends to be viewed merely as fuel);
though some of the more recent entries on the dining scene are definitely
making their mark. In this chapter, I offer general pointers about dining in
the land of Diz, explain the ins and outs of making reservations, provide
detailed reviews of the city’s best restaurants, and give you the lowdown
on Orlando’s most famous meal experience: character dining.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Few people come to Orlando with fine dining on the mind, though it’s a
lot easier to find nowadays than it used to be. The city has its fair share
of fancier spots that can compete with the best in the country (Disney’s
Victoria & Albert, Emeril Lagasse’s two Universal Orlando restaurants,
Manuel’s on the 28th), but most visitors tend to dine at the chains,
which are seemingly everywhere you turn, or inside the theme parks,
where the food doesn’t often astound, but the atmosphere is right. In this
city, the emphasis tends to be more on the experience and the theme
than it is on the food (which, most restaurant execs appear to reason, is
used to generate enough kick to get through the attractions without your
tank getting empty). 
With only a very few exceptions, if you want truly first-class cuisine with-
out having to take out a second mortgage, you have to get out of the
theme-park zones. Restaurants catering to locals (especially in the Dr.

Philips area and Winter Park, but also in Downtown Orlando) usually
offer excellent food and a sophisticated atmosphere at prices far less
daunting than inside the major tourist zones, with a small handful of
others located in downtown Orlando as well. I review a number of excel-
lent local restaurants in this chapter.
Most Orlando restaurants go out of their way to cater to kids, offering
children’s menus, diversions such as crayons at the table, high chairs,
and so on. The high kid-quotient generally means a higher volume level
and a more jovial atmosphere. Adults seeking a quiet, sophisticated, or
romantic night out do have options, however, and I note restaurants that
offer some respite from the kids on the “Good for Grown-ups” list found
on this book’s tear-out cheat sheet. 
Orlando’s own tend to dine early (as do most visitors with kids). For a
more leisurely and relaxed meal, try to eat dinner after 8:30 p.m., but
don’t wait too late — except for a few fast-food joints, many restaurants
close between 10 and 11 p.m.
For more information on the types of Orlando cuisine, see Chapter 2.
Dressing down
Didn’t pack the tux this time around, or just not a fan of dressing for
dinner? The good news is the city’s casual attitude generally extends
to most of its restaurants, so you can leave the penguin suits and long
gowns at home. At the theme parks, nobody will look at you twice if you
walk in to an otherwise formal atmosphere in shorts and a T-shirt. That
said, there are a few high-end restaurants that do require formal or semi-
formal attire; if a coat and tie is called for at a restaurant, I note it in the
restaurant reviews in this chapter.
Lighting up
If you’re a smoker, don’t plan on lighting up over dinner. Effective July 1,
2003, a state constitutional amendment banned smoking in Florida’s
public workplaces, including all restaurants and bars that serve food.
Stand-alone bars that serve virtually no food are exempt, and so are des-
ignated smoking rooms in hotels and motels, but they are becoming
fewer and farther between.
Making reservations
Reserving a table is a wise idea for most of Orlando’s finest restaurants,
but in most cases, you can wait to make same-day reservations. You
will find, of course, some exceptions to this rule, and I note them in the
appropriate restaurant reviews. 
Advanced Dining Reservations (previously known as Priority Seating)
is the only option available at most Disney properties. This practice is
Mickey’s way of saying that you get the next available table after you
arrive (at your pre-arranged arrival time). Understand however, you’ll
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Orlando 125

probably still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes after you get to the restau-
rant before actually being seated. I recommend that you always call as
far ahead as possible to make an Advanced Dining Reservation. If you
try walking in off the street to find a table, you may not get one before
your stomach starts growling at you (if you get one at all). Call % 407-
939-3463 to stake a claim to a table at Mickey’s place. If you’re staying
at a WDW resort, you can make Advanced Dining Reservations at the
hotel’s Guest Relations desk, with the concierge, or dial % 55 from your
room phone and arrange it yourself.
Don’t even think of showing up for a Disney character meal (see “Dining
with Disney Characters” at the end of this chapter) without an Advanced
Dining Reservation made far in advance if you want to ensure you get a
table. Some of the meals take Advanced Dining Reservations up to two
years ahead of time — and some of them book up within minutes. 
You can also make Advanced Dining Reservations after you’re inside the
Disney parks — best done immediately upon your arrival. At Epcot, make
reservations at the Worldkey interactive terminals at Guest Relations in
Innoventions East, at Worldkey Information Service satellites located
on the main concourse to World Showcase, and at Germany in World
Showcase, or at the restaurants themselves. In the Magic Kingdom, you
can sign up at Guest Relations inside City Hall or at the restaurants. For
Disney–MGM Studios, reserve a table via Guest Relations just inside the
entrance or at the restaurants. At Animal Kingdom, reserve at Guest
Relations near the entrance.
Worried WDW can’t entertain your vegetarian taste buds? Looking for
kosher food? Disney can usually handle those diets and other special
ones (for people who need fat-free or sugar-free meals, or for folks who
have allergies or a lactose intolerance, for example), as long as guests
give Disney advance notice — usually no more than 24 hours. It’s a good
idea to discuss these requirements when you make your Advanced
Dining Reservation arrangements. Select counter-service eateries now
offer specialty food items on their menu (check your park map for
details on which ones and what they offer). If you’re not staying at
WDW, call % 407-939-3463.
Tipping and taxes in Orlando
Sales tax on restaurant meals and drinks ranges from 6.5 to 7 percent
throughout the Orlando area. (These taxes don’t apply to groceries.)
In addition, the standard tip in full-service restaurants is 15 percent, and
a 12 percent tip is usually warranted at a buffet where a server brings
your drinks, fetches condiments, and cleans the table. If you have a pre-
dinner drink, leave a small tip to reward the server. 
Make sure that you carefully look over your check before coughing up a
tip because some restaurants have started automatically tacking a gratu-
ity onto your bill, especially for larger groups. There’s no sense doubling
a tip for routine service.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
126

Trimming the Fat from Your Dining Budget
If you’re staying in the parks until closing, you may find it more conven-
ient to eat there, but you’ll probably pay an average of 25 percent more
than in the outside world. (Dinner for two at a sit-down restaurant in
WDW, including tax and tip, can cost $50 or more — sometimes, a lot
more especially if you add in appetizers, dessert, and drinks.) If you
don’t mind ditching Mickey every now and again, you can substantially
decrease your eating expenses.
Here are a few suggestions to get the most out of your dining dollars:
 I won’t list all of them, but if you spend any time on International
Drive or U.S. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway between
Kissimmee and Disney, you’ll see all sorts of billboards peddling 
all-you-can-eat breakfast buffets at chain restaurants for $4 to $7.
A buffet is a great way to fuel up for the day early and skip or, at
least, lighten up on lunch. The drawback: You loose valuable time
when the parks are less crowded. 
 Make sure you pick up all the free magazines and ad books that
you see everywhere in Orlando hotels, tourist information centers,
most convenience stores, newspaper racks, highway rest areas,
and so on. These publications include coupons good for a second
meal free, discount prices on entrees, or a free dessert, beverage,
or appetizer with a meal. Also, watch for ads from restaurants that
offer kids-eat-free specials or discounts for early birds.
 Inexpensive (by now you know that’s a relative term) kids’ menus
(usually $7 and under) are common at most of Orlando’s moder-
ately priced and family-style restaurants. Many also offer place
mats with mazes or pictures to color.
 If you enjoy a cocktail before dinner, don’t ignore places with
happy-hour specials, including two-for-one drinks — some at bar-
gain rates — usually from 4 to 7 p.m. Again, you can find listings in
the free area guides in hotel lobbies and other places throughout
Orlando. 
 If your vacation won’t be complete without trying at least one of
the sit-down theme park restaurants, consider scheduling your
meal at lunch instead of dinner, when prices are almost always 
significantly cheaper.
 If you’re on a tight budget and your room has a kitchen, or at least
a spot to sit and grab a bite, consider dining in a night or two and
saving a few bucks. Area grocers, many with delis that turn out
ready-to-eat treats, include Albertson’s, 7524 Dr. Phillips Blvd.,
(% 407-352-1552; www.albertsons.com) and Gooding’s at the
Crossroads Shopping Plaza in Lake Buena Vista, 12521 Hwy. 535/

Orlando’s Best Restaurants
In this section, I review, in alphabetical order, what I think are some of
Orlando’s best restaurants. I also throw in some handy indexes at the
end of the chapter to help you narrow down your choices by category.
Because you may spend a lot of time in the Walt Disney World area, I’ve
given special attention to choices there. Don’t worry, though. I haven’t
forgotten to toss in plenty of worthwhile restaurants outside of Disney’s
domain — including a handful of Universal Orlando’s latest entries (you

Cutting food costs inside WDW
Eating at Disney parks can set you back more than a few bucks. For example, a 20-
ounce bottle of cola or spring water is $2.50 or more. To save money, buy a bottle (or
six-pack) of water from a local grocery costing far less, (freeze it the night before to
keep it really cold) and take it with you to the park, refilling it at water fountains
throughout the day. Also, in Animal Kingdom, you can belly up to the bar at the
Rainforest Cafe, order a soda for $2.50, and get a free glass of water. If you’re eating
lunch, the average price per person is barely under $10 if you eat at the counter serv-
ice–style fast-food areas, but it’s much less expensive than at the full-service eater-
ies. One of the cheapest entrees at the parks is a smoked turkey drumstick for $4.75
(and they’re huge!). You also can get a pineapple float for around $2.75.
Most of the resorts at Disney offer a refillable mug, which is good for refills there for the
duration of your WDW visit (the mugs must be used at the resort in which they were
purchased). The cost for the glass in most of the resorts is $12. At most resorts, the refills
are free (with a list of select beverages), although a few of them charge $1. The price may
seem steep, but if you consider that most sodas cost around $2 or more individually and
you take into account how much you’d drink during your stay, it’s actually a good deal.
Some of Disney’s water parks have refillable glasses, but refills are limited to the day
you’re in the park. For more information, call Disney at % 407-934-7639.

can find in-park dining options for the Universal theme parks in
Chapters 18 and 19) and some of the favorites elsewhere around town. 
Sit-down restaurants in the WDW theme parks (not their resorts) require
admission, with one exception: the Rainforest Café at Animal Kingdom.
Unless you are a Disney resort guest, all of the Disney theme-park
restaurants will also set you back $8 in parking fees (the same goes for
Universal Orlando’s restaurants, unless you arrive after 6 p.m., when
parking becomes free). And keep in mind, too, alcohol isn’t served in
Magic Kingdom restaurants, but liquor is served at Animal Kingdom,
Epcot, and Disney–MGM Studios restaurants, and elsewhere in the
Disney domain, as well as at the other major theme parks. 
Dining in Orlando constitutes your biggest vacation expenditure. To
make it easy for you to recognize expensive versus moderately priced
restaurants, each of the following entries includes one or more $ sym-
bols, based upon the average price of an adult dinner entree and one
non-alcoholic drink. For the meaning behind the dollar symbols, see
Table 10-1.

Lake Buena Vista
INTERNATIONAL
Come first for the 27th-floor sunsets and spectacular view of Disney’s
sparkling fireworks display. (You can get a much cheaper look from the
Top of the Palace Lounge, next door.) Beyond the long distance visuals,
the atmosphere is romantic and mellow. It has the elegant feel of a 1930s
supper club, filled with intimate alcoves, but minus the clouds of cigarette
smoke. You can choose from selections such as herb-crusted rack of lamb
or pineapple and soy glazed duck, though the entrees aren’t always as
impressive as the price may indicate. Overall, portions lean toward the
small size. Select four- and five-course meals are also available. The wine
list is commendable but priced well above retail.

Although a tad pricey, this small and elegant restaurant offers some of the
better seafood in Orlando. The atmosphere is intimate with dark woods,
chandeliers, and booths separated by etched glass. The periodically
changing menu offers treats such as a Mediterranean seafood medley
(Florida lobster, black grouper, shrimp, and scallops), and grilled sea bass.
But the champagne Sunday brunch served in the Renaissance Orlando
Resort’s huge atrium is the real crowd-pleaser. Themes change, but the 100-
item menu includes quail, duck, lamb chops, Cornish hen, clams, mussels,
snapper, sea bass, and sushi. A reservation for brunch is recommended,
given the crowds.

The newest restaurant on the scene at Universal Orlando is located in the

Riviera, the restaurant serves Italian fare in an upscale atmosphere, though
it’s a bit more down-to-earth than its predecessor. Bice is a family-owned-
and-operated restaurant with several other locations throughout North
America, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. The menu includes
items such as a Belgian endive salad in a light Dijon mustard dressing with
gorgonzola cheese and toasted walnuts; spaghetti with Maine lobster,
cherry tomatoes, and braised green onions; and veal chops in a porcini
sauce. You can choose to dine inside with views that overlook the water-
ways along the piazza of the hotel, or at a table on the piazza itself.

Sink into an upholstered booth or belly up to a stool at the counter of this

black-and-white tile, and red leather create a vision of yesterday’s road-

portions of comfort foods, such as chicken pot pie, roast pork with apples,
or a ham-and-cheese sandwich on a baguette. Health foods and vegetar-
ian specials also are available.
Although this is a diner-style restaurant and there is a kids’ menu, it’s not
a good spot to take young children as it’s located at The Peabody, a very

Walt Disney World Resorts
NEW ORLEANS
A family atmosphere (lively and noisy), good food (by Disney standards),
and reasonable prices (ditto) make Boatwright’s a hit with Port Orleans
Resort guests. Most entrees have a Cajun/Creole spin. The jambalaya is
sans seafood, but it’s filled with veggies, rice, chicken and sausage, and
it’s got a kick. Vegetarians will appreciate the vegetable medley or four
cheese ravioli; other entrees include bayou seafood stew, bourbon glazed
chicken, glazed pork ribs, and a hearty pot roast. Boatwright’s is modeled
after a 19th-century boat factory, complete with the wooden hull of a
Louisiana fishing boat suspended from its lofty, beamed ceiling. Most kids
like the wooden toolboxes on every table; each contains a saltshaker that
doubles as a level, a wood-clamp sugar dispenser, a pepper-grinder-cum-
ruler, shop rags (to be used as napkins), and a little metal pail of crayons.

AMERICAN
You can smell the hickory smoke emerging from the chimney of this
restaurant for blocks. This is, hands down, some of the best barbecue
you’ll find anywhere. And, if nothing else, you have to love the name. The
atmosphere is extremely informal, but watch the sauces. Even the mild
may be too hot for tender palates; the killer sauce comes with a three-
alarm warning — you may not be able to taste anything else for days. If
you can eat the night or day away, go for “The Big-Big Pig” platter (beef,
sliced pork, and turkey with fixins). And it wouldn’t be a barbecue without
plenty of brew on hand.

This colorful eatery with the flair of an artists loft features treats from Latin
America, Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the United States. It’s
an ideal spot for sampling different dishes; every order comes in a minia-
ture size. The roasted pears on pecan crisps — topped with Spanish bleu
cheese and a balsamic reduction — are a must. Chocolate fiends will not
want to pass up the dessert of handmade truffles — truly to die for. Guests
frequently see an artist bringing a canvas to life. You can also buy wine by
the glass or bottle. Note: Although, individual tapas are relatively inex-
pensive, ordering several tapas and drinks can easily turn this meal into a
$$$ restaurant.

California Grill
$$–$$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
AMERICAN
The 15th-floor views of the Magic Kingdom and environs are stunning, and
the food is pretty good, too. The Art Deco dining room features an exhibi-
tion kitchen with a wood-burning oven and rotisserie. The constantly
changing menu features fresh market fare, as well as pizzas and pastas.
Highlights may include seared yellowfin tuna that arrives rare, soft-shell
crabs with corn salad, or black grouper with mushroom risotto. The Grill
also has a nice sushi and sashimi menu (Dungeness crab, eel, tuna, and
more), ranging from appetizers to large platters. The restaurant sports a
grand wine list and some excellent vegetarian options.

Les Chefs de France
$$–$$$
Epcot
FRENCH
Three famous French chefs — Paul Bocuse, Roger Vergé, and Gaston
LeNotre — concocted the menu at this restaurant, which serves
respectable fare that’s far better than the usual theme park offerings. The
Art Nouveau interior is agleam with mirrors and candelabras, and etched-
glass and brass dividers create intimate dining areas. Dinner entrees
include Mediterranean seafood casserole (grouper, scallops, and shrimp
dusted with saffron and then allowed to swim in a mild garlic sauce) and
grilled tenderloin of beef with a Bordeaux wine sauce. The sauces tend to
be on the lighter side than at most traditional French restaurants. The
restaurant also offers a substantial wine list.

Christini’s
$$–$$$
Dr. Phillips Area
ITALIAN
The numerous awards and trophies on the walls attest to restaurateur
Chris Christini’s high standard of service. The fact that he’s been around
since 1984 shows he’s a survivor. Count on his restaurant for a possible
peek at show-biz celebrities from down the road at Disney–MGM and
Universal. A tender broiled veal chop seasoned with sage and served with
applesauce is one of the headliners. Another good choice is the pan-seared
Chilean sea bass over shrimp-and-lobster risotto. The food is quite good,
and the wine list is definitely a winner. The atmosphere is somewhat
formal, making it a good spot for a romantic night out.

Cinderella’s Royal Table
$$–$$$
Magic Kingdom
AMERICAN
Ornate murals of colored tile line the castle walls leading to the restaurant’s
entrance where the Gothic interior, which includes leaded-glass windows
and a spiral staircase, transport you to a time of knights and kings. Your
meal is delivered by servers who address you as “M’Lord” or “M’Lady.”
You can order from a menu with fancy names (the Grand Duke, for example),
but it boils down to roasted chicken, crusted salmon, and a New York strip.
The location and ambience are what makes this restaurant so popular, but
the food is reasonably good, too. (For information on the character break-
fast held here, see “Dining with Disney Characters” later in this chapter.)

The chef of this bright and airy restaurant makes a statement with French,
Alsatian, and Provençal cuisine with California and Florida touches.
(Whew!) Depending on when you visit, the menu may include basil-crusted
rack of lamb, pan-seared sea bass with shellfish bouillabaisse, or grilled
salmon with fennel ravioli and Swiss chard. The Old World–style dining
room filled with wrought-iron railings, mosaic-tile floors, and flickering
lights, features a show kitchen and spectacular views of the Seven Seas

can add a three-course wine pairing for $25.

SEAFOOD
Seafood rules at this very popular restaurant, which offers fabulous views
of the Living Seas aquarium and a dash of classical music to help set a
romantic tone. The menu, unfortunately, is less imaginative than the ambi-
ence. Entrees include grilled mahimahi with wasabi-mashed potatoes and
collard greens, and Florida snapper, with a decent selection of landlubber
fare as well. The Reef serves wine by the glass. Note: Diners get fish-
identifier sheets with labeled pictures so they can put names on the faces
swimming by their tables.

Cuban grilled swordfish topped with lime cilantro and blue crabmeat (talk
about a taste explosion); and Thai-spiced filet mignon served with mashed
potatoes and asparagus. Many of the seats are stools at high tables; if
that’s not for you, you may have a long wait. There’s a modest wine list.

International Drive Area
INTERNATIONAL
Think posh with a capital P — that’s what comes to mind when you slip
inside these walls. The restaurant’s name honors the mallards that splash
all day in the marble fountains in the Peabody’s grandly formal lobby.
(Staffers assure us that birds of the quacking variety will never appear on
the menu.) Candlelit tables surround a large chandelier, and textured gold
walls are hung with watercolors of the various duck species. Its eclectic
menu changes with the seasons. Possibilities include a tender veal chop
roasted medium rare with an artichoke-basil fricassee and garlic au jus; or
steamed red snapper in tomato fricassee and fennel. Choose a wine from
one of the best wine lists in the city. The service is impeccable; for most
people, however, the prices make Dux a choice only for special nights or
expense-account meals.

Emeril’s
$$–$$$
Universal Orlando
NEW ORLEANS
The Florida home of culinary genius Emeril Lagasse, star of Emeril Live on
cable TV’s Food Network (and, therefore, rarely on the premises), offers a
feast for both the eyes and mouth. This two-story restaurant resembles
an old warehouse, albeit one with pricey art on its walls. The second floor
has a 12,000-bottle wine gallery. If you want a show, I highly recommend
trying to get one of the eight counter seats where you can watch the chefs
working their Creole-cuisine magic, but to get one, you’ll need to make
reservations excruciatingly early. (Reserve at least six weeks in advance.)
Best bets include the Texas redfish (an extremely moist white fish with
roasted pecan-vegetable relish and meunière sauce) and a grilled-and-roasted
half chicken served with rice pilaf. Though jackets are recommended for
gents at dinner, you’ll find a lot of diners, fresh out of the Universal theme
parks, far less dressy.
Emeril’s lunch menu is cheaper but has many of the same items as the one
at dinner. It’s also easier to get a reservation, and the dress code is more
casual.

50’s Prime Time Cafe
$$
Disney–MGM Studios
AMERICAN
If you yearn to go back to a time when life was simpler, this is the place for
you. The décor is right out of the television sitcoms, and servers deliver
comfort foods, including meatloaf, fried chicken, and pot roast. The food
isn’t quite the way mom used to make it, but the place offers enough fun
that you may love it anyway. Black-and-white TVs air shows such as Topper
and My Little Margie as servers zap you back to the days when you had to
finish your vegetables if you wanted dessert. Mom, aka your server, may
very well scold you if put your elbows on the table or don’t clean your
plate. Desserts like s’mores and sundaes top off the menu, and there’s even
a neat selection of specialty drinks.

Walt Disney World Resorts
SEAFOOD
Welcome to Coney Island, circa 1940, à la Disney. The vibrant colorful décor
here is almost as elaborate as the show kitchen, which puts the chefs at
center stage where everyone can see meals being prepared. The seafood is
among the freshest in town, so the menu changes frequently. Headliners
may include potato-wrapped red snapper and oak-grilled salmon. You’ll
also find beef, poultry, and veggie options. If you can’t get a table here, ask
about sitting at the counter — you get a great view of the kitchen.

SEAFOOD
Lose yourself in a world of brass, shining mahogany, and river charts as
you dine on the city’s best seafood while inside a moored Mississippi
Delta-style paddlewheeler (just bring your bank account along). Lobster
(Maine and Australian) and crab (stone, king, and Dungeness) dominate
the menu. The grilled tuna mignon is served rare, and the Dungeness crab
cakes are a real treat. One popular meal for two combines Alaskan king
crab, snow crab, and lobster with potatoes and creamed spinach. You’ll
find a comprehensive wine list. You can dine on the outdoor deck if the
weather’s fair.

If Papa were to eat at his namesake, he might dive into the beer-battered
coconut shrimp with horseradish sauce and orange marmalade or the
blackened swordfish with Cajun tartar sauce. No doubt, he would skip the
wine list (there is a decent one) and opt for a few Papa Dobles, a potent
rum concoction he invented and, according to legend, once downed 16 at
one sitting! The interior of Hemingway’s has a Key West air, and the walls
are adorned with several sepia photographs of the famous author and his
fishing trophies. The eatery has a romantic, indoor dining room lighted by
hurricane lamps, and there’s a wooden deck near a waterfall. It’s usually
childfree, although there is a kids’ menu.

The huge derby marks the entrance to this restaurant at Disney–MGM.
Inside, this re-creation of the restaurant where Hollywood’s stars gathered
in the ’30s and ’40s is decorated with caricatures of the regulars on its walls
and white linens on the tables. The food (on the pricy side) won’t win an
Academy Award, but the restaurant does have a respectable pan-seared
black grouper with green beans al dente and mustard-crusted rack of lamb
with acorn squash and sweet-and-sour cabbage. The restaurant’s two sig-
nature dishes are the Cobb salad, invented by then-owner Bob Cobb in the

House of Blues
$$
Downtown Disney
AMERICAN
Inside this Louisiana clapboard building, you find hearty portions of down-
home Southern food served in an atmosphere literally pulsing with rhythm
and blues. Exceedingly crowded on days of big concerts, the music in the
nightclub next door is as much a draw as the food. Funky folk art with a
voodooish feel covers the rustic walls from floor to ceiling. The back patio
has seating and a nice view of the bay. Foodwise, the spicy Creole jamba-
laya (shrimp, chicken, ham, and andouille sausage) and pan-seared
voodoo shrimp are good bets. Sunday’s Gospel Brunch is a ton of foot-
stomping fun, with plenty of southern favorites like chicken jambalaya,
cornbread, and BBQ chicken alongside breakfast staples including
omelets, sausage, and bacon. Brunch is the only time you can make reser-
vations, and it sells out fast, so make them early.

pan-roasted monkfish, and lemon-cumin marinated ahi tuna. The wine list
features an extensive number of South African vintages. If you have an
adventurous palette, it’s well worth the trip.

Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville
$–$$
Universal Orlando
CARIBBEAN
The laid back atmosphere may take you to paradise, but after the parrot-
heads have had enough to drink, the noise can make it hard to hear your
table mates. You have your choice of three watering holes: the Landshark
Bar, the 12-Volt Bar, and the Volcano Bar, which comes complete with a
two-story, margarita-spewing mini mountain. Despite the renowned cheese-
burgers in paradise (yes, they’re on the menu at $9.95), the food has
Caribbean leanings. And although it isn’t contending for a critic’s choice
award, it’s fairly tasty. Best bets include jerk chicken, jambalaya, and a
Cuban meat loaf survival sandwich that’s a cheeseburger of another kind.
The “Porch of Indecision” offers the best spot for those with kids along. 
Watch your tab. At up to $8 a pop for margaritas (the mango ones are
best), the bill can climb to $50 or more for a routine lunch.

award-winning favorite, which offers traditional Chinese food done right.
Dishes are flavorful and excellently presented. Best of all, most entrees are
priced in the single digits. It’s been around for over 20 years, and for good
reason. Most nights, owner Tom Yuen works the floor greeting guests like
family.

Le Cellier Steakhouse
$$–$$$
Epcot
STEAKS
You’ll feel welcome in this cozy steakhouse, which tends to be less
crowded — and less manic — than some of Epcot’s other restaurants. The
dining room resembles a wine cellar, where you’ll sit in tapestry-upholstered
chairs under vaulted stone arches, with lanterns lighting the room.
Although it doesn’t compete with some of the better outside-world steak-
and-chop houses, it has a surprisingly good selection of Midwest, corn-fed
beef in the usual cuts: filet, porterhouse, prime rib, rib-eye, and so on.
Wash your meal down with Canadian wine or beer.

Liberty Tree Tavern
$$
Magic Kingdom
AMERICAN
This sit-down restaurant’s 18th-century colonial pub atmosphere (period
music plays and the décor features antiques, oak-plank flooring, and a
huge fireplace filled with copper pots) and good service help make it one
of the better places to dine in the Magic Kingdom, but few will be com-
pelled to visit a second or third time. The cuisine is traditional American,
and the vittles are basic: roast turkey, carved beef, and smoked pork with
all the trimmings. Lunch offers à la carte service, while dinner gives you a
character buffet (see “Dining with Disney Characters” later in this chap-
ter for more on the character meal). Note: Even though this place calls
itself a tavern, it does not serve alcohol.

Little Saigon
$
Downtown Orlando
VIETNAMESE
Situated in the heart of a tiny Vietnamese neighborhood, this ethnic eatery
has been open since 1987 and thrives on regulars from the community.
The menu offers everything from appetizers to noodle dishes to stir-fries
that mix and match pork, beef, seafood, and vegetables. The combo plates
are a good deal. Service and attention depend on the traffic. Order food
by number; if you need a description of a dish, you may need to ask the
manager, whose English is better than that of some of the servers. Don’t
miss the summer rolls with peanut sauce.

L’Originale Alfredo di Roma
$$–$$$
Epcot
ITALIAN
Sample southern Italian cuisine in a re-creation of Alfredo De Lelio’s
famous eatery in Rome, including some lovely wall murals and an exhibi-
tion kitchen. It may be the World Showcase’s most popular restaurant
(Advanced Dining Reservations are a must), but Alfredo’s servers can be
snooty and its pasta is very overpriced. Your best bets include the signa-
ture fettuccine Alfredo and the calamari in a white wine, garlic, and tomato
sauce served on fettuccine. The dining room noise level can be quite high,

Lotus Blossom Café
$
Epcot
CHINESE
The open-air cafe offers familiar favorites much like what you find in
Chinese restaurants located in mall food courts. Expect slightly above fast-
food quality stir-fry, hot-and-sour, lo mein, and pork-fried rice. The outdoor
(though covered) seating is refreshing. You can buy Chinese beer and wine
as well. Quality aside, it’s still a bargain in pricey Epcot.

Manuel’s on the 28th
$$$
Downtown Orlando
INTERNATIONAL
Manuel’s is, literally, the pinnacle of elegance, situated in a posh,
panoramic enclave on the 28th floor of a downtown bank. Come here for
a stunning after-dark view of the sparkling, sprawling metropolis that
Orlando has become. To make sure you don’t miss out on the view, the
dining room has floor-to-ceiling windows. The best news: The food
matches the scenery, despite the small kitchen. The dozen or more appe-
tizers and entrees hit high notes with duck, lamb, yellowfin tuna, lobster,
and filet mignon. One popular dish is miso-marinated Chilean sea bass.
The service is very professional, and the restaurant has a great wine list.

Marrakesh
$$
Epcot
MOROCCAN
For a spot of romance and truly authentic flavor, head for Marrakesh. Of
all the World Showcase restaurants, this venue best typifies the interna-
tional spirit of the park. Hand-laid mosaics in intricate patterns set the
scene for lavish North African dining, complete with belly dancers.
Marrakesh uses a long list of spices, including saffron, to enhance flavor-
ful specialties. Most entrees come with the national dish, couscous
(steamed semolina with veggies and sometimes other embellishments).
Good bets include a marinated shish kebob of lamb roasted in its own
juices, and a seafood medley.

Ming Court
$$–$$$
International Drive Area
CHINESE
Dine in a romantic setting, graced by lotus ponds filled with colorful koi
while you’re entertained by — get this — zither music. One of O-Town’s
favorite Chinese restaurants, Ming Court lets you rub elbows with more
locals than tourists thanks to innovative twists on traditional cuisine. The
flavors are delicate and probably more balanced than at your neighbor-
hood Chinese place. Try the grilled filet mignon with Szechuan seasoning
or the lightly battered and deep-fried chicken breast with lemon-tangerine
sauce. Portions are sufficient, there’s a moderate wine list, and the serv-
ice is excellent.

Nine Dragons
$$–$$$
Epcot
CHINESE
Nine Dragons shines in the décor department with carved rosewood pan-
eling and an amazing dragon-motif ceiling. But the food doesn’t match its
surroundings, and portions tend to be smaller than what most expect in a
Chinese restaurant. Main courses feature Mandarin, Shanghai, Cantonese,
and Szechuan cuisines. The dishes include spicy beef stir-fried with
squash in sha cha sauce, lightly breaded lemon chicken, and a casserole
of lobster, shrimp, and scallops sautéed with ginger and scallions. You can
order Chinese or California wines with your meal.

’Ohana
$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
PACIFIC RIM
This restaurant is a hit in the fun department, but the decibel level can
climb pretty high. Servers will address you as “cousin,” as ’Ohana means
family in Hawaiian. As your luau is prepared over an 18-foot fire pit, the
staff keeps your eyes and ears busy. A storyteller is followed by coconut
races in the center aisle, and then you can find out how to shake your
booty during a hula lesson. Soon after you’re seated, the feeding frenzy
begins in rapid succession. (Ask your waiter to slow down if the pace is
too fast.) Included is a variety of skewers (think shish kebob), including

ITALIAN
The ceiling of this restaurant contains fiber optics that create an aura of
dining under the stars, but try the patio if you want the real thing. Some
servers can be a little aloof, but the price and taste make up for it. Pacino’s
serves thick, juicy veal chops that are usually fork tender, a challenging
32-ounce porterhouse steak, and fruitti di mare (shrimp, calamari, clams,
and scallops sautéed with white wine and herbs and heaped onto a mound
of linguine).

AMERICAN
This location is the 23rd member of a chain started more than 75 years
ago in New York, and the food is good, if overpriced. The décor leans
toward the upscale supper clubs of the ’30s and ’40s, and the walls are
lined with caricatures of celebrities. Beef and seafood headline a menu
that features a 36-ounce New York strip steak for two and a 3-pound Nova
Scotia lobster. Smaller appetites and budgets can feast on salmon or veal
chops. Validated parking is available.

caramelized onions and three-cheese potatoes. A sautéed double breast
of chicken has a jacket of sour-orange sauce and sliced avocados. There’s
also a small selection of sandwiches ($7–$10).

The pizzas here go beyond the routine to quattro formaggio (with four

But it’s the less casual entrees that pack people into this place. On the
menu, you may find a wood-roasted Atlantic salmon or pasta with Alaskan
king crab, scallops, shrimp, and clams in light wine sauce. Situated in a
gabled Bermuda-style house, the Portobello’s awning-covered patio over-
looks Lake Buena Vista. Its cellar is small, but there’s a nice selection of

$$–$$$
Downtown Disney & Animal Kingdom
AMERICAN
Set amid a jungle with tropical sounds of birds and waterfalls, this place is
one that most kids love! The food’s pretty respectable (with an extensive
menu), but it’s really the décor that makes this restaurant. As its name sug-
gests, entering the Rainforest Café is like walking into a jungle — lifelike
silk plants, chattering Animatronic monkeys and elephants, the occasional
rain and thunder rumblings are all over. Fun dishes include Caribbean
Coconut Shrimp (with a sweet mango sauce), and Maya’s Mixed Grill (ribs,
chicken breast, and shrimp) but there’s just too many to list. The barstools
resemble zebras, giraffes, and other wild-and-crazy critters. 
Don’t even think of showing up here without an Advanced Dining
Reservation, or you could end up waiting hours to get in. 
Also be aware you have to walk right by the souvenir shop to dine so keep
little heads turned to the left if you can.

music, and some spirited servers. Dine on such traditional dishes as fish-

an English pie sampler (pork and cottage, and chicken and leek). On the
lighter side, bar food includes sausage rolls, Cornish pasties (meat pies),
and a Stilton cheese and fruit plate. You can order ale, lagers, and stouts

warmer to make sure Guinness is served at 55 degrees, just like its British
guests prefer. If you only want to grab a pint or a snack at the bar, you don’t
need Advanced Dining Reservations.
The restaurant’s outdoor seating (weather permitting) offers a fantastic

It’s always night at the San Angel, where you’ll eat at one of several roman-
tic candlelit tables located in a hacienda courtyard surrounded by dense
jungle foliage. The shadow of a crumbling Yucatán pyramid looms in the
distance, and you hear the sound of faraway birds and faint rumblings of
the volcano while you dine. The ambience of this restaurant, located inside
the Mexico Pavilion, is exotic, and the fare is traditional — that’s why you
won’t find nachos or Mexican pizza on the menu. Entrees include mole
poblano (chicken simmered with more than 20 spices and a hint of choco-
late) and filete motuleño (grilled tenderloin of beef served over black
beans, melted cheese, pepper strips, and plantains). Your drinking options

MEDITERRANEAN
Tapas, pizza, and pasta are the main items on the menu at this
Mediterranean-style restaurant, which features an open exhibition kitchen

fried calamari, and a sampler platter. You can also choose from several
conventional entrees, including Moroccan-spiced tuna and grilled pork
porterhouse with goat cheese polenta. Table-side sangria presentations
add something special to the evening. Although popular, the quality here
doesn’t rival Café Tu Tu Tango (reviewed earlier).
During the height of the summer, Spoodles gets crowded, and the wait can
be long, even with Advanced Dining Reservations, so this restaurant isn’t
a good choice for famished families coming straight from the parks, and
really not a great choice for families with young kids along either.

Teppanyaki Dining Room
$$–$$$
Epcot
JAPANESE
If you’ve ever been to a Japanese steakhouse, then you know the drill:
Diners sit around the large grill-tables while the chefs expertly and quickly
dice, slice, stir-fry, and serve up your food to your plate with amazing dex-
terity. Kids especially enjoy watching the chef wield a cleaver and other
utensils. Several parties are seated at teppanyaki tables, which makes for
sociable dining, especially for single travelers looking for conversation.
Expect the entrees to have chicken, steak, scallops, lobsters, or a combi-
nation. Kirin beer, plum wine, and sake are served.
The adjoining Tempura Kiku counter-restaurant offers sushi, sashimi, and
tempura-battered shrimp and chicken.

Todd English’s BlueZoo

Walt Disney World Resorts
SEAFOOD
Celebrity chef Todd English put down roots, in 2004, at the Walt Disney
World Dolphin with this restaurant, which serves innovative seafood in an
unusually vibrant upscale setting. The food is served with an artistic flair
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Orlando 153

almost as impressive as the décor. On the entree front, try the mizo-glazed
Chilean sea bass or the catch of the day roasted on a rotisserie grill. There
are a few non-marine items on the menu, but the emphasis here is on all
dishes aquatic. Shellfish lovers will enjoy the raw bar (just be sure to bring
your wallets!).

Victoria & Albert
$$$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
INTERNATIONAL
The setting is Victorian and a nostalgic reminder that dining out was once
a treat to be savored in an evening-filling, relaxed, and stylish manner. The
chef works wizardry with food from a diverse marketplace. This restaurant
is the most memorable (and memorably expensive) in WDW. But if money’s
no object and you’re serious about food and romance going hand in hand,
head here. The intimate dining room has exquisitely appointed tables. The
food is impeccable and presented with a flourish by an attentive and pro-
fessional staff. (Each table has servers named Victoria and Albert.) The
seven-course menu changes nightly. You may begin with roasted duck with
candy-striped and golden beets, followed by Monterey abalone with lemon
and baby spinach. Then, shrimp bisque may precede an entree such as
Australian Kobe-beef tenderloin. English Stilton served with a poached pear
sets up desserts such as vanilla-bean crème brûlée and Kona chocolate
soufflé. Dinners are 21⁄2- to 3-hour affairs, though the later sitting can run
longer. If you want to try the chef’s table experience (you actually dine in
the kitchen and watch them prepare your meal), be sure to reserve it excru-
ciatingly early (they begin taking Advanced Dining Reservations 180 days
in advance). Note: I don’t recommend this restaurant for children.
See map p. 130. 4401 Floridian Way, in Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. % 407-
939-3463. www.disneyworld.com. Advanced Dining Reservations required well
in advance, especially for the Chef’s Table. Main courses: fixed-price menu $95 per

Wolfgang Puck Grand Café
$$–$$$
Downtown Disney
AMERICAN
This restaurant’s sushi bar, an artistic copper-and-terrazzo masterpiece,
delivers some of the best sushi in Orlando. You can eat gourmet pizza, with
a thin crust and exotic toppings, on an outdoor patio or inside. Upstairs,
the main dining room presents a seasonally changing menu that may fea-
ture Szechuan beef and crimini satay with a spicy vegetable stir fry or
pumpkin ravioli with sage, hazelnut butter, and parmesan. The lower level
can be noisy, making conversation difficult, and the downstairs wait for a
table is excruciatingly long. Puck’s also has a grab-and-go express restau-
rant that sells sandwiches, pizzas, desserts, and more.

Yachtsman Steakhouse
$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
STEAKS
Regarded as one of Orlando’s top steak-and-chop houses, Yachtsman
Steakhouse is a good place to come if you love red meat. You can see the
cuts age in a glass-enclosed room, and the exhibition kitchen provides a
tantalizing glimpse of steaks, chops, and seafood being grilled over oak
and hickory. The décor includes knotty-pine beams, plank floors, and
leather-and-oak chairs. Steak options range from a 6-ounce filet to a 12-
ounce bourbon-marinated strip to a belly-busting 24-ounce T-bone. The
menu also includes salmon, chicken, and rack of lamb. The Steakhouse is
prone to crowds, but most folks say that it’s worth the wait.
See map p. 130. 1700 Epcot Resorts Blvd., in Disney’s Yacht Club Resort. % 407-939-

Dining with Disney Characters
The opportunity to chow down with Mickey, Donald, Cinderella, and many
of the other major characters is the major dining experience in Orlando.
The 8-and-under crowd usually gets starry-eyed when characters show
up to say howdy, sign autographs, pose for photos, and encourage them
to eat their broccoli. Character mealtime appearances at Disney parks,
attractions, and resorts are incredibly popular. As a result, one-on-one
interaction is somewhat brief, so be ready for that Kodak moment or hope
a WDW photographer captures it for you (at a premium price). 
You may not find a seat when you show up to a character appearance
unannounced, so call % 407-939-3463 to make Advanced Dinning
Reservations as far in advance as possible (these reservations don’t lock
down a table, but they give you the next available table after you arrive at
your appointed time). To take the guesswork out of figuring out how far in
advance (60 days? 90? 180?) you need to make an Advanced Dining reser-
vation, head online to the PS Planning Guide (www.pscalculator.net).
This unofficial site does a very good job of keeping up-to-date on all the
rules and reservation windows for every restaurant at Disney. But its best
feature is a calculator that allows you to punch in your desired reserva-
tion date, and then tells you when the Advanced Dining Reservation
window for your chosen restaurant will be open. Best of all, this service
is free.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Orlando 155

The cost of catching characters
Prices for Disney character meals are pretty much the same no matter
where you dine. Breakfast (most serve it) averages $17 to $20 for adults
and $9 to $11 for children 3 to 11. Dinner, which is only available in some
places, runs $22 to $27 for adults and $10 to $13 for children. In general,
presentation at all the character meal listings here is high on the fun
front but middle-of-the-road when it comes to the food.
Character meals accept American Express, Diners Club, Discover,
MasterCard, Visa, and the Disney card. For more information on these
meals, check Disney’s Web site at www.disneyworld.com.
The most characters money can buy
Although I mention specific characters here, be advised that WDW
frequently changes its lineups, so don’t promise the kids a specific 
character or you may get burned. Also, keep in mind that you’ll have
to add the price of admission (and, if you aren’t a Disney resort guest, the
$8 parking fee) to meals that are served inside the theme parks. When
bringing children to these meals, remember that some of the very young
ones may actually end up scared of — and not delighted with — the
larger-than-life characters.
Cape May Café
This delightful, New England-themed dining room offers buffet breakfasts
(eggs, pancakes, bacon, pastries, and more) that are hosted by Admiral
Goofy and his crew — Chip ’n’ Dale and Pluto. Again, the characters that
show up may vary.

Character dining at Universal 
Orlando & SeaWorld
Though it’s the recognized leader in the category, Disney doesn’t have a lock on char-
acter dining in Orlando. At Islands of Adventure, you can have breakfast with Spider-
Man, the Cat in the Hat, and other Marvel and Dr. Seuss characters Thursday through
Sunday from park opening to 10:30 a.m. at the Confisco Grille. The cost is $16 for adults
and $10 for children ages 3 to 9, plus tax and tip. Call % 407-224-4012 for the manda-
tory reservations.
Shamu and a group of his marine friends (Penny Penguin and Seamore the Sea Lion,
among others) welcome you at the Shamu & Crew Character Breakfast served from
8:45 to 10:15 a.m. at the park’s Seafire Inn. The cost is $15 for adults and $10 for chil-
dren ages 3 to 9 (children younger than 3 enter free, but must have a reservation). For
the mandatory reservations, call % 800-327-2420 or go to the park’s Web site at www.
seaworld.com.

See map p. 130. 1800 Epcot Resorts Blvd., in Disney’s Beach Club Resort. Character
breakfast: $18 adults, $10 children. Open: Daily 7:30–11:30 a.m.
Chef Mickey’s
The whimsical Chef Mickey’s welcomes your favorite cartoon characters
twice a day: at buffet breakfasts (eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, and
other items) and dinners. (Entrees change daily and are joined by a salad
bar, soups, vegetables, and ice cream with toppings.) Mickey and various
pals are there to meet and mingle.
See map p. 130. 4600 N. World Dr., in Disney’s Contemporary Resort. Character break-
fast: $18 adults, $10 children; character dinner: $27 adults, $12 children. Open: Daily
7:30–11:30 a.m.; 5–9:30 p.m.
Cinderella’s Royal Table
This castle — the focal point of the park — is the setting for daily charac-
ter breakfasts. The menu has standard fare: eggs, bacon, Danish, and fresh
breads. Hosts vary, but Cinderella always makes an appearance. This meal
is a great way to start your day in the Magic Kingdom.
Advanced Dining Reservations are a must here, and thanks to the crowds,
the most difficult character breakfast to get. If this is a must-do breakfast,
I suggest you begin trying as soon as the reservation window opens up
90 days in advance (call exactly at 7 a.m. and if — lucky you — you get
through on your first try, don’t get picky about your seating arrangements
and dining times). Note: Advanced Dining Reservations for this breakfast
must be made with a guaranteed credit-card payment that will cost you $10
for adults and $5 for kids if you don’t cancel them at least 24 hours in
advance.
See map p. 130. In Cinderella Castle, Magic Kingdom. Character breakfast: $22 adults,
$12 children. Open: Daily 8–10:30 a.m.
Crystal Palace
The real treats here are the characters, Pooh and his pals, who are on
location throughout the day. The restaurant serves breakfast (eggs, French
toast, pancakes, bacon), lunch, and dinner (a variety of beef, chicken, veg-
gies, kids’ favorites, a sundae bar, and more).
See map p. 130. On Main St., Magic Kingdom. Character breakfast: $18 adults, $10
children; character lunch: $20 adults, $12 children; character dinner $23 adults, $12
children. Open: Daily 8–10:30 a.m.; 11:30 a.m.–2:45 p.m.; 4 p.m. until park closing.
Donald’s Prehistoric Breakfastosaurus
Here’s another all-you-can-eat buffet of eggs, bacon, French toast and other
favorites. Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto are on hand to entertain the
little ones while they almost eat. Note: This is the only place in Animal
Kingdom that offers a character breakfast.

vanilla ice cream.
See map p. 130. In Liberty Square, Magic Kingdom. Character dinner: $22 adults, $10
children. Open: Daily 4 p.m. until park closing.
1900 Park Fare
The exquisitely elegant Grand Floridian Resort hosts character breakfasts
(eggs, French toast, bacon, and pancakes) and dinners (prime rib, pork
loin, fish, and more) in the festive, exposition-themed 1900 Park Fare. Big
Bertha — a 100-year-old French band organ that plays pipes, drums, bells,
cymbals, castanets, and the xylophone — provides music. Mary Poppins,
Alice in Wonderland, and friends appear at breakfast; Cinderella and
friends show up for Cinderella’s Gala Feast at dinner.

Exploring Walt
Disney World

In this part . . . 
I
have some great news for you: You’re going to visit the
“Happiest Place on Earth” And now for the bad news: If
you neglect to plan ahead, you may just be the unhappiest
person there.  
In an average year, more than 42 million people ﬁnd their way
to Disney’s four major theme parks, and all are determined to
ride the same rides and eat in the same restaurants as you
(sometimes, it would seem, all at the same time!). You’ll have
much more fun if you arrive knowing which parks and attrac-
tions are best suited to your tastes as well as knowing which
places aren’t worth the effort. In this part, I guide you through
matching up the parks’ features to your tastes so that you can
decide where you want to spend the majority of your time.

Getting Acquainted with
Walt Disney World
In This Chapter
 Familiarizing yourself with the Disney parks

 Pricing the cost of your visit

 Getting around the crowds
T
he first time I made a pilgrimage to the Magic Kingdom, I wandered
in slack-jawed awe among the many marvels of Mickeyville.
Today, I marvel at a different wonder: growth. Walt Disney’s legacy has
exploded in the last three decades. It has truly become a world unto
itself, with four theme parks, nearly a dozen smaller parks and attrac-
tions, clubs, hotels, restaurants, shopping districts, its own transit
system, and two cruise ships. It’s enough to fog your brain, but that’s
why I’m here — to defog and demystify the planning process.
In this and the next several chapters, I introduce you to the parks, tanta-
lize you with ride descriptions, and offer you some suggested itineraries.
With the many thanks to my own children and those of my sisters and
friends, I also use a special ratings system to give you a kid’s view
(“KidRating”) of the rides and shows in the parks. My reviews are based
on those of my children: Ryan (12), Austin (10), Nicolas (8), Hailey (6),
and Davis (4).
Introducing Walt’s World
Disney’s four main theme parks line the western half of this 30,500-acre
world. The Magic Kingdom is the original attraction; with just over 15 mil-
lion visitors in 2004, it was busier than any other U.S. theme park. Epcot
was third busiest with 9.4 million visitors, followed by Disney–MGM
Studios at 8.2 million, and Animal Kingdom with 7.8 million. (In case

Walt Disney World Parks & Attractions
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
168
you’re curious, Disneyland, in California, holds the No. 2 slot.) Here’s a
quick look at what you can find in all four Disney parks:
 Magic Kingdom: Built as Disney’s flagship park, the Magic Kingdom
is divided into seven themed lands. They’re laid out like the spokes
of a wheel, with the park’s icon — Cinderella Castle — at the hub.
Anyone with kids, or who is just young at heart, needs to give the
Magic Kingdom at least one full day. It offers more for young children
than any other Orlando theme park, but it has broad appeal for first-
timers and Disney fans, too. If you fall into these categories, I recom-
mend two days or more, provided you have the time and budget.
(See Chapter 12 for more details about the Magic Kingdom.)
 Epcot: Built as an exposition of human achievement and new 
technology (albeit a somewhat commercialized version), Epcot is
symbolized by Spaceship Earth, an attraction often described as
“that big silver golf ball.” Future World, the first of Epcot’s two sec-
tions, has innovative exhibits and rides. This part of the park is also

home to three of Disney’s newest rides, Soarin’, Mission: Space,
and Test Track. The far end of the park, World Showcase, consists
of a lagoon surrounded by pavilions showcasing the cultures of
11 countries. Allowing two days for the shows, rides, shops, and
ethnic restaurants in Epcot is a good idea. (See Chapter 13 for
more details about Epcot.)
This park is the least attractive for younger children, but the best
one for inquiring minds and those who appreciate the world’s
unique cultures (as well as ethnic dining) (see Chapter 10).
 Disney–MGM Studios: This showbiz-themed park is reminiscent of
the Tinseltown of the ’30s and ’40s. It blends working studios with
shows such as the all new Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show,
Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!, and thrill rides such as the
Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Rock ’n’ Rollercoaster starring
Aerosmith. Young kids will find some cool things to occupy their time
here, though they won’t be able to do the two major thrill rides. And
best of all for the foot-weary: You can tackle this part of WDW in
only one day, and a more relaxed one at that. (See Chapter 14 for
more details about Disney–MGM Studios.)
 Disney’s Animal Kingdom: The newest Disney kid on the block is
symbolized by the 14-story Tree of Life, which is to this park what
Cinderella Castle is to the Magic Kingdom. At this park, guests
explore Asia, Africa, and even the age of the Dinosaur. The wildlife
exhibit, zoo, and theme park features shows such as It’s Tough to Be
A Bug! and Festival of the Lion King, as well as rides like Kilimanjaro
Safaris, DINOSAUR, and Expedition Everest (debuting in 2006). You
won’t have trouble touring this park in one day, but keep in mind
that this one’s best seen early in the day. (See Chapter 15 for more
details about Disney’s Animal Kingdom.)
Have time for more?
In addition to the big four, a few other parks and attractions round out
the Disney empire:
 DisneyQuest is a whole lot more than just a fancy video arcade. It’s
a virtual reality world unto itself, with top-flight games and simula-
tors that put the game consoles you have at home to shame. 
 Disney’s Wide World of Sports is a 240-acre complex filled with
an array of state-of-the-art sports facilities for football, soccer, 
baseball, softball, as well as other sports and activities. At the
interactive Multi-Sports Experience, guests can participate in a 
variety of challenges that put their skills to the test. The complex
also has a 7,500-seat baseball stadium that’s the spring training
home of the Atlanta Braves. 
 Walt Disney World Speedway has a stock car–racing track that
serves as host to the Richard Petty Driving Experience, where you
Chapter 11: Getting Acquainted with Walt Disney World 169

can even drive a car or ride shotgun at 145 mph. (If you’re from
Talladega or Darlington, you probably can do that in your sleep.)
 A pair of themed miniature golf courses whose whimsical décor
schemes (think “Santa goes to the beach” and “Disney classic film
comes alive”) entertain even as they challenge putters with all-too-
realistic water hazards and tricky sand traps. To visit Santa in all his
sunny glory, head for Winter Summerland; for Mickey’s sorcerer’s
hat and dancing hippos, take your irons to Fantasia Gardens.
 Two splashy parks let you float along lazy streams, scream down
gravity defying waterslides, and more. They’re especially appealing
in summer, when the heat and humidity both are above 90° and
90 percent. Kids and adults alike will enjoy cooling off at Blizzard
Beach and Typhoon Lagoon.
I give you more info about these attractions in Chapter 16.
Planet Disney also has several shopping (see Chapter 17) and nightlife
(see Chapter 25) venues. For example:
 Disney’s BoardWalk is a good place to stroll the waterfront, dine,
dance, or catch a game in the sports bar.
 Downtown Disney comprises Pleasure Island, an adult nightclub
district; Downtown Disney Marketplace, which features dining and
shopping; Downtown Disney West Side, with more shopping, dining,
Cirque du Soleil, and the House of Blues; and DisneyQuest, a high-
tech, interactive video arcade.
You can get additional information about all WDW properties by calling
% 407-934-7639 or visiting its Web site at www.disneyworld.com.

Palling around with Mickey
Introduced in 2003, Pal Mickey is a talking 101⁄2-inch-tall stuffed digital Mickey Mouse
who serves as a semi-amusing novelty guide to the Disney parks, telling guests about
parades, show times, and so on when activated. Designed for kids, he nevertheless
gets toted around by adults, too. (Pal Mickey comes with an attachable belt clip and
most grown-ups, much to the amusement of their kids, often get confused and go for
their pagers when he vibrates to let them know he’s got a message for them). His com-
puter chips pick up wireless signals throughout the park and dispenses pertinent fun
and facts; after you leave, a few corny jokes are all that’s left of his repertoire. Pal
Mickey operates on three AA batteries — they’re included! — and dispenses more
than 700 bits of wisdom. He’s available for purchase ($60) inside all Disney resort gift
shops, and at select stores inside the theme parks. For that much money, I’d prefer
the real Mickey to show me around instead of his little electronic brother, but at least
you can take him home. 

For a peek at the layout of Walt Disney World’s various theme parks and
other “lands,” consult “The Lands” map earlier in this chapter.
Want to go behind the scenes?
If you’d like an insider’s look at how the Wizards of Diz make magic,
Behind the Scenes Tours are the way to go. So many options are available
that the Disney folks sometimes have trouble remembering them all. 
Reservations are recommended and, in many cases, essential for these
tours. Call % 407-939-8687 to make your reservations.
Note: Unless otherwise noted, you have to pay park admission, cur-
rently $60 for adults, $48 kids 3 to 9, in addition to the tour price. But
ticket prices, times, and tours change often, so check before your trip by
calling Disney’s tour line at % 407-939-8687; for custom guided tours
call % 407-560-4033.
Here’s a sampling of the best offerings:
 Family Magic Tour: This two-hour scavenger hunt brings you face
to face with Disney characters at the Magic Kingdom ($25 for ages
3 and older). It kicks off at 11:30 a.m. daily outside City Hall, but
you need to book in advance.
 Hidden Treasures of World Showcase: This three-hour tour lets
you explore the architectural and entertainment offerings at Epcot’s
11 World Showcase nations. The tour costs $59 for ages 16 and older
and begins at 9:45 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
 Keys to the Kingdom: Receive a 41⁄2-hour orientation to the Magic
Kingdom and a glimpse into the high-tech systems behind Mickey’s
magic. It’s $58 for ages 16 and older and includes lunch. The tour
starts at 8:30, 9:30, and 10 a.m. daily.
 Backstage Magic: At the top of the price chain — $199 per person —
Backstage Magic is a seven-hour, self- and bus-propelled tour
through areas of Epcot, the Magic Kingdom, and Disney–MGM
Studios that aren’t seen by mainstream guests. If you must know
how things work, this tour is for you. You may see mechanics repair-
ing and building animatronic beings, and you venture into Magic
Kingdom tunnels that aren’t only work areas but also paths for the
cast to get from one area to another without fighting tourist crowds.
It is offered at 9:45 a.m. weekdays and is limited to 20 adults (age 16
or older), so book as early as possible (Disney recommends at least
two months in advance). Park admission isn’t required.
 Custom guided tours: Not satisfied with any of the standard tour
offerings? Disney let’s you can create your own itinerary. There are
no age requirements, though be prepared for a minimum of 5 hours
at $125 per hour (WDW resort guests pay only $95 per hour). 
Chapter 11: Getting Acquainted with Walt Disney World 171

For those up to the task, not to mention the price tag, call % 407-560-
4033 to make tour arrangements. Photo ID’s are required at check-in for
all tours. 
Finding Your Way to the Fun
If you’re driving, Interstate 4’s Disney exits are clearly marked (though
the exit numbers periodically change thanks to construction). You can’t
miss them unless you close your eyes.
Interstate 4 is woefully crowded, especially during rush hour (7–9 a.m.
and 4–6 p.m. daily). In addition to the thousands of people heading for a
day at the parks, thousands of locals are heading to work. So remember
to factor possible delays into your time schedule.
Parking in the Disney theme-park lots costs $8 per day (unless you’re
a WDW resort guest, and then it’s free) and is a snap. Just do what the
people in the yellow-striped shirts ask you to do. In the Size XXXL Magic
Kingdom lot, you’ll probably want to ride the tram to the front gate.
(The trams are a hoot — the seats are made out of petrified plastic, so
if you lack posterior padding, you’ll probably remember the ride for a
while. And don’t forget a jacket if you plan on making a day of it; the
ride back to your car at night can make you feel like you’re one of those
frozen Mickey pops.)
Getting from the parking lot to the action can take up to an hour at the
Magic Kingdom, so be patient as you begin the day. The first stop after
the tram ride is the Ticket and Transportation Station, where you trans-
fer to the monorail or the ferry to get to the park.
At Epcot, Disney–MGM, and Animal Kingdom, trams are available, but
walking can be faster — unless you have small children or sore feet — if
you’re parked in the front half of the lot. 
Don’t forget to make a note of your parking area, including your row and
space number, or you may end up on an unfortunate scavenger hunt
when you head home. After a day spent standing in lines, listening to
screaming kids, and being tapped-out by cash registers, you’ll have a
hard time remembering your name, not to mention where you parked.
And odds are that at least a few of the cars in the lot will be clones of
your own, making it that much harder to spot your own.
If you don’t have a car, or prefer to skip the drive, many area accommo-
dations offer shuttles that are sometimes free but can also carry a fee.
(Check the listings in Chapter 9 for hotels that offer shuttle service.)
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World

Traveling within the World
If you’re staying at a WDW resort, you can take the Walt Disney World
Transportation System to get to the parks. The system also serves
Downtown Disney, Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach, Pleasure Island,
and Disney’s Wide World of Sports. It’s a thorough network that includes
buses, monorails, ferries, and water taxis serving the major parks from
two hours prior to opening until two hours after closing. On the downside,
it doesn’t always offer direct routes, and moving between locations can
make for a long and complicated journey. For more on the pros and cons
of using the transport system, see Chapter 8. Disney properties also offer
transportation to other area attractions, but you have to pay for it.
Ask at the Guest Relations desk in your hotel or at the theme parks for a
copy of the Walt Disney World Shopping, Dining & Recreation guide, which
includes a map of the entire transportation system. The map shows you
everything in the empire and gives you an idea of where your hotel is in
relation to places that you want to visit. You can also look at the map of
WDW’s areas in this chapter to help orient yourself.
Preparing for Park Admission Costs
The number of admission options — from one- to multiday tickets —
offered at Walt Disney World is staggering, and they’re all expensive.
Deciding which option works best for you depends on the number of
days you plan to spend in the parks, what parks and attractions you
want to see, and whether you’re staying at a WDW resort.
IIf you choose to buy a single-day admission pass, you’re limited to seeing
one Disney park; you can’t hop to another one in the middle of the day
without paying a separate admission. Most people get the best value from
four- and five-day Magic Your Way passes with the Park Hopper option
added on, which, as the name implies, let you move from park to park on
the same day.
Magic Your Way is an all new ticketing system at Disney, and it’s designed
to save you money the longer you stay and play and allows you add on
several optional features. 
If you plan on visiting Walt Disney World more than one time during
the year, inquire about the no expiration option or money-saving annual
passes ($395–$515 adults, $336–$438 children 3–9). For information on a
host of WDW tickets and options, see the following tables.

WDW considers everyone 10 and older an adult, and the prices that I give
you don’t include 6.5 percent sales tax. Also, fluctuating attendance fig-
ures and new multimillion dollar rides continue to escalate the single-day
admission fee. (It’s now $60 for adults, $48 for kids 3–9, but I expect that
price to continue rising, so check before your trip for up-to-the-minute
costs.) You can save an average of 10 percent off the regular prices of all
passes by ordering online in advance at www.disneyworld.com.
As with many of the attractions in the area and across the state, Florida
residents can take advantage of additional and special savings. Inquire
about these savings when ordering your tickets.
The average family will spend $100 to $125 per person per day on park
admissions, midday food, snacks, and souvenirs alone.
Getting the Most Out of Your Trip to the World
The Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney–MGM Studios usually open at
9 a.m. (sometimes earlier) throughout the year. They’re open at least
until 6 or 7 p.m. and often as late as 11 p.m. or midnight during peak peri-
ods (holidays and the summer months). Animal Kingdom usually opens
at 8 or 9 a.m. and closes at 5 or 6 p.m. It’s a safe bet that the longer a park
stays open, the more people visiting that day, so planning your schedule
before you get to the park is essential. Unfortunately, hours of operation
vary greatly, so it’s always wise to call % 407-934-7639 ahead of time, or
to check the official calendar on Disney’s Web site at www.disneyworld.
com. When you arrive at the park, pick up a Times and Information guide
to use for the rest of your stay.
Beating the lines
Everyone’s looking for a shortcut, and no wonder — lines at Disney and
the other big parks can be incredibly long and irritating if you come at
the wrong time. Twenty minutes is considered cruising when it comes
to line time, and 45 minutes to one hour is common at the primo rides,
unless you use FASTPASS. In peak periods — summer, holidays, week-
ends, and other times when kids are out of school — it can take an hour,
sometimes longer, to reach the front of the line and in three or four min-
utes, the ride is over.
Chapter 11: Getting Acquainted with Walt Disney World 175

Here are the best tips I can give you to beat the long lines:
 Come during off-season periods.
 Arrive as early as possible — the crowds pour in beginning at
around 11 a.m. and only get worse from there.
 Plan to spend the morning in one section, and the afternoon in
another. That way, you won’t waste time and energy running back
and forth.
 Spend two days in the park if time and your budget allow.
 Ask about or read the health and height restrictions before you get
in line to avoid wasting time on a ride that isn’t for you.
 Disney parks have tip boards that provide up-to-the-minute infor-
mation on show times and ride waits. You can find the boards at
Main Street, U.S.A., near Casey’s Corner in the Magic Kingdom, on
Hollywood Boulevard near the entrance to Sunset Boulevard in
Disney–MGM Studios, in the southwest quadrant of Innoventions
Plaza near Epcot’s Future World Fountain, and in Discovery Island at
Animal Kingdom. 
Don’t want to stand in line as long as other guests, yet not flush enough
to hire a stand in? Disney parks have installed a ride-reservation system
called FASTPASS where you go to the primo rides, feed your theme-park
ticket into a small slot, and get an assigned time to return. When you do,
you get into a short line and climb aboard. Here’s the drill:
Hang on to your ticket stub when you enter and head to the hottest ride
you want. If it’s a FASTPASS attraction (they’re noted in the guide map
you get when you enter), feed your stub into the waist-level ticket taker.
Retrieve your ticket stub and the FASTPASS stub that comes with it.
Look at the two times stamped on the latter. You can return during that
one-hour window and enter the ride with almost no wait. In the mean-
time, you can do something else until the appointed time.
Note: Early in the day, your one-hour window may begin 40 minutes after
you feed the FASTPASS machine, but later in the day it may be hours,
especially at Epcot’s Test Track (see Chapter 13). Initially, Disney allowed
you to do this reservation system on only one ride at a time, but now,
your FASTPASS ticket has a time when you can get a second FASTPASS,
usually two hours later, even if you haven’t yet used the first pass. And
be prepared, FASTPASS tickets do run out. They are limited in quantity
and often run out by noon so be sure to get yours as soon as you can.
Using E-Ride tickets
The Magic Kingdom’s E-Ride Nights — a three-hour window after regular
closing time where you can ride that park’s nine most popular rides, such
as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Space Mountain, and Buzz Lightyear’s
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
176

Space Ranger Spin, as many times as you want — are a bargain for Disney
hotel guests who are persistent enough to track down tickets. Characters
wander the park to pose with visitors, and some shops and fast-food
restaurants stay open. Better still, Disney admits only 5,000 guests (about
20 percent of the normal day’s park attendance) into the park on E-Ride
Nights. 
E-Ride tickets cost $12 adults, $10 kids 3 to 9 and are sold on a first-come,
first-served basis at the Guest Relations desks in the Disney hotels and at
the Magic Kingdom ticket window (the latter sells them only on the day
of the E-Ride Night). In order to purchase an E-Ride ticket, you will be
required to show a Disney Resort Guest ID or proof of stay at an Official
Hotel, and a valid multiday admission pass. After 4 p.m. on the day of
your E-Ride Night, take your ticket and park admission pass to one of
three locations — City Hall on Main Street, U.S.A.; Splashdown Photo in
Frontierland; or Tomorrowland Arcade — to get a special wristband that
you must wear in order to remain in the park after closing. Call % 407-
934-7639 for details and dates when E-Ride Nights are scheduled.
Taking advantage of Extra Magic Hours
Each day a particular park offers either admittance one hour early or up
to three hours after closing for Disney Resort Guests and those staying
at an Official Hotel. To take advantage of the Extra Magic Hours, your
ticket must be good for the participating park or you must have the Park
Hopper option (allowing you to enter any of the four major parks). At
press time, the Magic Hours schedule was: Magic Kingdom, Sunday and
Thursday; Animal Kingdom, Monday and Friday; Disney–MGM Studios,
Tuesday and Saturday; and Epcot, Wednesday. Get a show schedule
when entering the park
Getting a show schedule (it’s part of the handout guide map) as soon
as you enter the park is essential. Spend a few minutes looking it over,
noting where you need to be and when. Many of the attractions in Walt
Disney World are nonstop, but others occur only at certain times or
once a day. You can find maps and schedules at counters on one side
or the other of the turnstiles; sometimes at both. They’re also found at
most Disney shops.
Avoiding the Crowds
Crowds are a fact of life at Walt Disney World, but that doesn’t necessar-
ily mean you’ll have to stand in long lines at all the rides and attractions.
Forward thinkers can definitely decrease their risk of encountering a
major swarm of tourists. In addition to FASTPASS (see the section “Beating
the lines,” earlier in this chapter), here are some facts to keep in mind as
you plan your crowd-avoiding strategy:
Chapter 11: Getting Acquainted with Walt Disney World 177

 Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays are the busiest days in The
Magic Kingdom. Tuesdays and Fridays are the busy days at Epcot.
Sundays and Wednesdays are crowded at Disney–MGM Studios,
and Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are beastly at Animal
Kingdom.
 Although it isn’t guaranteed, the parks tend to be less crowded
from mid-April (or after the Easter Holidays) to late May and from
September through November, except for Thanksgiving. You also
have a better chance of avoiding crowds if you go in the middle of
the week. Also, while most people steer clear on rainy days, the
parks can be less crowded, and you won’t miss much other than
parades. (There’s plenty of good stuff indoors.)
 Finally, if you dine at Disney, make Advanced Dining Reservations
early in the day, or before you arrive at the park, to lock in the time
you want to eat. (See Chapter 10 for more on Advanced Dining
Reservations.)

I
f you have kids or a soft spot for vintage or classic Disney, make your
way to this WDW signature park first. Magic Kingdom is the most
popular of Mickey’s enterprises, attracting more than 40,000 people a
day, with good reason. Be prepared for long lines, and lots of ’em.
Proof of the staying power of Magic Kingdom lies in the fact that the
park has changed very little during its 30-plus years of existence. Most
of its newer attractions, such as Mickey’s PhilharMagic, are hardly the
adrenaline generators you encounter at other theme parks, but Magic
Kingdom remains the fairest of them all.
Managing Magic Kingdom Logistics
Yes, you can find rides, shows, and characters galore, but you also need
to know some practical items about Magic Kingdom. This section gives
you the lowdown on prices, hours, and services.
Buying tickets and making reservations
Ticket prices (at printing time) for a one-day admission are $60 for
adults, $48 for kids 3 to 9, but these change frequently, so call ahead.
(See Chapter 11 for more information on park admission prices.)
Tickets aren’t the only thing you’ll spend big bucks on. Magic Kingdom
(and the other parks) nails you to the tune of $2 or more for a soda
or milk, $1.25 to $2 for bottled water, $2.40 for an ice-cream bar, and
$1.70 for a cup of coffee or cocoa. Note: If you’re on a tight budget,
whenever you can, bring bottled water from the outside world, where
you can often get an entire six-pack of bottles (freeze them the night
before so they’re really cold) for less than just two bottles at the parks.
A big bag of snacks costs far less and go a lot further as well.
When you first show up, make your Advanced Dining Reservations
immediately (if you haven’t done so before arriving) if you want to have

a sit-down meal at a special venue. See Chapter 10 for details. You also
want to check out the list of special shows and daily events in the enter-
tainment schedule in the park guide-map you get upon entering. You may
find information about special concerts, visits from Disney characters,
plus fireworks and parades.
Arriving early and staying late
Although Magic Kingdom is usually open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., there
are exceptions. In fact, the gates sometimes open 15 to 30 minutes earlier
than the official opening time. I recommend trying to get to the park early,
but not just because of the possibility of early opening hours. An early
arrival helps beat morning traffic and allows you a more relaxed pace
to get from the parking lot to the fun, which can take as long as an hour.
At the end of the day, the park often closes later than 6 p.m., sometimes
as late as 10 or 11 p.m., especially during the summer and on holidays.
Magic Kingdom may even be open as late as midnight for certain special
events. Call % 407-934-7639 for more details.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forget to bring essential items or need special assistance at
the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that can help:
 ATMs are located at the main entrance, in Adventureland, and in
Tomorrowland. They honor cards from banks using the Cirrus,
STAR, and Plus systems.
 Baby-changing facilities, including rocking chairs and toddler-size
toilets, are next to the Crystal Palace at the end of Main Street. Of
course, it isn’t the most cost-effective place to buy them, but you
can purchase disposable diapers, formula, baby food, and pacifiers
in the Baby Care Center. Changing tables are also located at the
center, as well as in all women’s restrooms and some of the men’s.
 Disposable cameras and film are available throughout the park,
but Disney doesn’t seem to have caught on to the popularity of 
digital cameras, as supplies such as rechargeable batteries and
storage cards are limited.
 The First Aid Center, staffed by registered nurses, is located along-
side Crystal Palace and the Baby Care Center.
 You can access lockers in an arcade underneath the Main Street
Railroad Station. They cost $7, plus a $2 refundable deposit.
 Lost children are often taken to City Hall or the Baby Care Center,
where lost children logbooks are kept. Children under 7 should wear
name-tags inside their clothing.
 You can send packages from any store to guest relations in the
Plaza area, so you can then pick them up at the service desk at
day’s end instead of hauling souvenirs around with you. Allow three
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
182

hours for delivery. When you’re staying at the Disney resorts, you
can have your packages sent straight to your room at no charge,
though it may take a day or two for them to get there.
 Pets, except service animals, are prohibited in the parks, but you
can board yours at the Transportation and Ticket Center’s kennels
(% 407-824-6568). Day rates are $6; overnighters cost $11 ($9 for
Disney resort guests).
 Rent strollers at the Stroller Shop near the entrance. The cost is
$8 for a single and $15 for a double, including a $1 deposit.
 Rent wheelchairs at the gift shop to the left of the ticket booths
at the Transportation and Ticket Center or at the Stroller and
Wheelchair Shop inside the main entrance to your right. Cost is $7
with a $1 deposit; $30 and a $10 deposit for battery-run chairs.
 You can find some of your favorite characters at Mickey’s
Toontown Fair. In Fantasyland, look for them in the Fantasyland
Character Fest and Ariel’s Grotto. In Mickey’s Toontown Fair head to
the Judges Tent and the Toontown Hall of Fame. Characters also
appear in Adventureland (by Pirates of the Caribbean) and Main
Street (near City Hall) as well as in Liberty Square at the Diamond
Horseshoe and occasionally in Tomorrowland behind Buzz
Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin. (See the guide map that you get
when entering the park.) 
You can get more information about WDW properties by calling % 407-
934-7639 or visiting Disney’s Web site, www.disneyworld.com.
Making the Rounds: Magic Kingdom’s
Top Attractions
More than three-dozen attractions, an array of shops, and numerous
eateries are located within Magic Kingdom’s 107 acres. The following
tour, complete with descriptions, begins at the front gates and takes
you counterclockwise through the park’s seven uniquely themed lands.
To find all the listed attractions, see “Magic Kingdom” map on page 180.
Main Street, U.S.A.
Although it’s considered one of the kingdom’s lands, Main Street is more
of an entry zone where you can easily lose yourself in the pleasant nostal-
gia of yesteryear. I recommend passing through it quickly when you arrive
(so you can make a beeline for the more popular attractions before the
lines get too long). You have to make a return voyage on Main Street when
you cry “uncle” at the end of the day. At that time, stamina permitting, you
can browse through the shops at a more leisurely pace before exiting the
park. Here are a few of the highlights of Main Street, U.S.A.:
Chapter 12: Magic Kingdom 183

 Walt Disney World Railroad: This authentic steam-powered train
makes a 15 to 20 minute loop around the park, with stops in
Frontierland and at the far end of Mickey’s Toontown Fair. During
busy periods and parade times, this is a great way to get around
the park without fighting your way through the crowds. It also
gives the kids (and you) a well-deserved, albeit brief, break.
 Harmony Barber Shop on Main Street in Magic Kingdom is a real
scissor shop where you can get your hair cut. The barbershop
quartet might even take a break from entertaining guests along the
street to serenade you. Hours are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Adult
haircuts are $17; kids’ are $14; colored gel will run you $5. If it’s
your child’s very first haircut, Disney barbers will cut his or her
hair for free and throw in a certificate and set of mouse ears. The
shop is on Main Street near the firehouse, but it’s a bit hidden so
keep your eyes peeled.
Tomorrowland
This land attempts to focus on the future, but in 1994, the WDW folks
realized that Tomorrowland (originally designed in the 1970s) was
beginning to look a lot like “Yesteryear.” As a result, Disney revamped
the entire area to show the future as seen from the past (sometime
around the 1920s or ’30s) with a galactic, science fiction–inspired com-
munity filled with aliens, robots, and video games. 
Here’s a sampling of what you can find in Tomorrowland:
 Astro Orbiter: Future astronauts, especially those who are 7-years-
old and younger, love whirling high (and I mean high — you have to
take an elevator to get there) into the galaxy in the colorful rockets
that circle around while gently rising and falling. Unfortunately,
the orbiter lines can stretch for lightyears, so if you’re on a tight
timetable save it for later. 
 Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin: On this ride you go to infin-
ity and beyond in an interactive space adventure in which you help
Buzz defend the Earth’s supply of batteries from the evil Emperor
Zurg. You fly an XP-37 space cruiser armed with twin lasers and a
joystick that’s capable of spinning the craft. (Space Rangers who
get motion sickness should sit this attraction out. There’s enough
space debris flying around without your help.) While you cruise
through space, you collect points by blasting anything that looks
or smells remotely like Zurg (just look for all the neon “Z”’s and
shoot). Your hits trigger light, sound, and animated effects. This
ride is a tamer version of Men in Black Alien Attack at Universal
Studios Florida (see Chapter 18). My 3-year old, 8-year old, and 
10-year old all adore this ride.
 Space Mountain: Imagine a roller coaster. Then imagine it in
the dark. This ride, plus Big Thunder Mountain Railroad (in the
“Frontierland” section, later in this chapter) and Splash Mountain
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
184

(also in the “Frontierland” section), are the three major Magic
Kingdom attractions that tweens, teens, and thrill seekers alike
head to first, so get here early or use FASTPASS. Space Mountain is a
classic roller coaster with plenty of dramatic dips and drops, and
the darkness makes it seem like it’s going much faster than its top
speed of 28 mph. Grab a front seat for the best ride. 
“It was such a rush! In the dark you couldn’t tell what was going to
happen next.” And: “The twists and turns happened really fast —
it’s definitely the coolest ride at Disney.” It’s recommended for those
ages 10 and older, but because it was one of the first generation of
modern, dark-side coasters, and is, therefore, somewhat outdated,
it’s a bit tamer than some of the more modern thrill rides at Disney–
MGM Studios. Note, however, that you must be 44 inches or taller
to ride, and there’s a bailout area for those who decide at the last
minute that they’re not quite up to space travel. The seats and lap-
bar restraints on Space Mountain may not fit some larger plus-size
riders.
 Stitch’s Great Escape!: Gone is the ultra-scary ExtraTERRORestrial
Alien Encounter, and in its place is this slightly more family-friendly
attraction based on the Disney hit film Lilo & Stitch. The storyline is
a prequel to the movie, showing the mischief caused by rascally
Experiment 626 (also known as Stitch) when he was originally cap-
tured. For those who experienced Alien Encounter, not that much
has changed other than the characters, who are now far less fright-
ening to look at. The state-of-the-art audio-animatronics are neat,
but there are just too many gaps in between. There are long peri-
ods of darkness with no sound and really nothing going on — other
than the screams of the scared little kids making their way to the
door — and the multisensory effects, including an oderous burp
belted out by Stitch, are a bit over the top. You must be 38 inches or
taller to experience the great escape, a height restriction that keeps
most of Stitch’s fans from even entering. 
 The Timekeeper: This seasonal attraction is a circlevision film
hosted by none other than the very amusing Robin Williams. Upon
entering you are greeted by a wacky animatronic robot who explains
that he will be sending his assistant back through time, when, sud-
denly, everything starts to go awry, and you end up along for the
ride. The journey takes you through various periods in time — when
dinosaurs roamed the earth, the Ice Age, the Renaissance — where
you meet famous figures such as H.G. Wells and Jules Vernes. While
somewhat interesting for adults, it’s a test of endurance for younger
kids, who may not like standing (as is required) for the entire show. 
 Tomorrowland Resort Indy Speedway: Kids, especially those ages
4 to 8, like slipping into these Indy-car knockoffs and taking them for
a spin; but older children, teens, and adults (especially those with
need for speed) generally hate them. The long lines and less-than-
stellar steering, combined with an ultra-slow top speed of a mere
7 mph, add up to one giant snooze of an experience. Additionally, a
Chapter 12: Magic Kingdom 185

thick iron rail separates your tires, so you’re pretty much kept on
track. This isn’t a ride that will make you go vroom, even though you
have to be a minimum of 52 inches tall to drive alone. 
 Tomorrowland Resort Transit Authority: The small, five-car
trains on this elevated people-mover are engineless. They work
by electromagnets, create no pollution, and use little power. The
environmentally friendly cars wind around Tomorrowland and into
Space Mountain on a lazy ride that encourages you to nod off when
it’s late in the day, and you begin to realize that they’ve already
covered 4 or 5 miles. There’s usually no wait, but this ride is
another one to skip if you’re in a hurry. If you need to rest weary
feet or have tired toddlers in tow, however, this one’s a real winner.
(It’s also a good place to wait it out with your little ones when the
older kids are riding Space Mountain.)
 Walt Disney World Carousel of Progress: Open only seasonally,
this Disney oldie was refurbished to its original state in 1994. The
22-minute show takes you on a quasi-historical trip through time;
hosted by an audio-animatronic family who explains how their
lives have changed with the introduction of electricity and other
technological advances of the past 50 years. Older guests may find
it nostalgic, younger ones may wonder how anyone lived before
the invention of video games. Although not particularly exciting,
and definitely one to be skipped if you’re pressed for time, it,
nonetheless, is a good way to spend some down time waiting for
the thrill seekers in the family to get through Space Mountain.
Mickey’s Toontown Fair
Head off cries of “Where’s Mickey?” by taking young kids (ages 2 to 8) to
this two-acre site as soon as you arrive. It’s by far the best place to meet
the characters, including Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto.
Magic Kingdom’s smallest land is filled with a whimsical collection of
rides, play areas, and candy-striped tents. 
 The Barnstormer at Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm is a mini roller
coaster designed to look and feel like a crop duster that flies slightly
off course and right through the Goofmeister’s barn. It has a 35-inch
height minimum, and its tight turns and small dips even give some
adults a rush.
 Donald’s Boat (The S.S. Miss Daisy) is an interactive play area
with fountains and water snakes that win squeals of joy (and relief
on hot days). Unless you want to wear wet clothes for the rest of
the day, bring along a dry change of clothes or a swimsuit. 
 Mickey’s & Minnie’s Country Houses provide a lot of visual fun
and some interactive areas for youngsters, though they’re usually
crowded and the lines flow like molasses. Mickey’s place features
garden and garage playgrounds. Minnie’s lets kids play in her
kitchen, where popcorn goes wild in a microwave, a cake billows
up in the oven, and the utensils strike up a symphony of their own.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
186

 Toontown Hall of Fame hosts meet and greets with various
Disney characters as well as one of the largest souvenir shops in
the park. You have to wait in line to meet the characters (each with
his or her own separate line, so you’ll have to decide which one is
most worth the wait), but the payoff is that each family is allowed
a few minutes with the character of their choice where hugs are
exchanged and photos are snapped.
Fantasyland
Disney classics come to life in Fantasyland, where the rides are based on
the movies you grew up with way back when, as well as a few of the more
recent additions to the Disney treasure chest of films. The entire area is
dedicated to the younger set, who would happily spend the entire day
here; unfortunately, the seemingly endless lines eat up a good portion
of your time unless you use FASTPASS. Here’s a list of attractions in
Fantasyland:
 Cinderella Castle: Modeled on several French châteaux, the fairy-
tale Gothic-style castle sits at the end of Main Street in the center of
the park. Its hard to miss the 189-foot landmark and its 18 towers,
especially now as its decked out in golden adornments for the
Happiest Celebration on Earth (an 18-month-long celebration to
commemorate Disneyland’s 50th birthday. Festivities are in full
force at every Disney theme park around the world. For it’s part,
Walt Disney World has welcomed in new rides, shows, and special
events, many of which are borrowed from its fellow Disney parks in
California, Tokyo, and Paris.) The Castle is a favorite photo op, and
if you land at the right time, you can meet Cinderella and a handful
of other favorite characters at the Forecourt Stage just after the all
new “Cinderellabration” production (a continuation of the Cinderella
story set during her coronation pageant; the times guide will list the
daily schedule of shows). Otherwise, the castle is mainly a visual
attraction. The interior corridor is lined with beautiful murals and
exquisite mosaics depicting the classic story of Cinderella. The
upper level of the castle is also home to Cinderella’s Royal Table
restaurant (see Chapter 10).
 Cinderella’s Golden Carousel: This old beauty was built in 1917
by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company and served tours in Detroit
and New Jersey before it was discovered in the late 1960s by Disney
Imagineers and brought to Magic Kingdom. A patriotic red, white,
and blue in its first incarnation, it was restored and re-themed in
time for the park’s opening, and now tells the tale of Cinderella in
18 hand-painted scenes set above magnificent antique horses. It’s a
delight for kids and carousel lovers of all ages. The organ plays —
what else? — Disney classics such as “When You Wish Upon a Star”
and “Heigh Ho.”
 Dumbo The Flying Elephant: This attraction doesn’t do much for
adrenaline-addicted older kids — or line-hating parents — but it’s a
Chapter 12: Magic Kingdom 187

favorite of kids ages 2 through 6. Dumbo’s ears keep them airborne
for a gentle, circular flight with some little dips. Except for the Disney
theme, it’s not all that different from the kiddie rides at most local
carnivals. Most kids older than 6 will be humiliated if you even sug-
gest they ride it. If your little ones are dying to ride Dumbo, get here
early — wait times are brutal, and it doesn’t have FASTPASS!
This ride is designed for the young ones, so plus-sized parents may
have troubles getting their elephant to fly, and the taller among you
may feel somewhat cramped.
 “it’s a small world”: Young kids and most parents love this attrac-
tion; teens and most other adults however may find it a real gagger.
Nevertheless, pay your dues — it’s an initiation rite every Disney
visitor needs to undergo, and the sun-sheltered line isn’t usually
too long. You glide around the world in small, slow moving boats,
meeting children (audio-animatronic, of course) from around the
world, including Russian dancers, Chinese acrobats, and French
cancan girls, and every one of them sings the tune that eats its way
into your brain and refuses to stop playing for months. 
A 10-year-old’s take: “It was annoying with all the dolls, and the
song just kept playing over and over.” A 6-year-old: “It was so pretty
with all the fancy costumes and lights in the sky, and nothing was
scary.” Either way, it’s a cool place to rest for a while if you need a
break from the summer heat.
Those of you who have ridden this attraction in the past may have
noticed the recent refurbishments. This attraction, one of the origi-
nal few that opened with the park in 1971 (and originally built by
Walt Disney for the 1964 World’s Fair) underwent a major renova-
tion in 1994 that included painting and repairing the animatronics
figures, as well as replacing the sound system and lights. 
 Mad Tea Party: You make this tea party mild or wild, depending on
how much you choose to spin the steering wheel of your gigantic
teacup, though the cup does a little spinning of its own as well.
This ride is suitable for ages 3 and older. Teens and older kids seem
to enjoy this ride’s potential for turning unwary passengers green.
The woozy mouse who pops out of a big teapot in the center of the
platform would no doubt sympathize with those left spinning.
 The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: Pooh inadvertently
created a small storm of protest when Disney used this ride to
replace the popular Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride in 1999. The Many
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh features the cute-and-cuddly little
fellow along with Eeyore, Piglet, and Tigger. You board a golden
honey pot and ride through a storybook version of the Hundred
Acre Woods, keeping an eye out for Heffalumps, Woozles, blustery
days, and the Floody Place. This ride has become a favorite of kids
2 to 8 and their parents, so a FASTPASS is often needed.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
188

 Mickey’s PhilharMagic: Mickey, Donald, Ariel, Aladdin, and a
handful of other favorites appear in this animated and impressively
3-D–enhanced adventure (it’s projected on a 150-foot screen — the
largest wraparound screen on the planet) in which a mischievous
Donald has not so surprisingly gotten into a spot of trouble. This
show is similar to Jim Henson’s Muppet*Vision 3-D (see Chapter 14)
at Disney–MGM Studios, but is far more engaging in its combina-
tion of music, animated film, puppetry, and special effects that
tickle several of your senses. Kids love the effects, and if you’re a
sucker for the classic Disney films, you will absolutely adore it. 
 Peter Pan’s Flight: Another popular ride among visitors younger
than 8, it begins with a nighttime flight over London (even adults
ooh and aah here) in search of Captain Hook, Tiger Lily, and the
Lost Boys. It’s one of the old glide rides dating back to the limited
technology that was available when Magic Kingdom was born, but
the simplicity is part of what makes it so popular. Terribly long lines
are almost a signature of this ride, so plan on using a FASTPASS to
avoid the worst of it. My younger kids wouldn’t miss it no matter
how long they have to wait.
 Snow White’s Scary Adventures: Your journey takes you to the
dwarfs’ cottage and the wishing well, ending with the prince’s kiss
to break the evil spell. This version of the Grimm’s fairy tale is much
less grim than it was years ago, when the focus was inexplicably
on the wicked witch, though she still makes several appearances.
Snow White now appears in several more-friendly scenes, though
kids younger than 4 will likely still get scared. I can’t recommend it
if your time schedule is tight; for those young enough to want to
ride, it’s not worth the tears and screams, and those who won’t get
frightened are too old to get much pleasure out of it. 
Liberty Square
Located between Fantasyland and Frontierland, Liberty Square is a 
re-creation of Revolutionary War–era America that infuses you with 
colonial spirit. Younger guests may not appreciate the historical touches
(such as the 13 lanterns symbolizing the original 13 colonies that hang
from the gigantic live Oak), but they’ll delight in the chance to pose for a
picture while locked in the stocks or march along with the fife-and-drum
corps that sometimes makes an appearance along the cobblestone streets.
Although it is one of the smallest lands in all Magic Kingdom, Liberty Square
has an impressive number of attractions, including the following:
 Liberty Square Riverboat: The steam-powered paddlewheeler
Liberty Belle departs Liberty Square for scenic cruises along the
Rivers of America. The passing landscape recalls the Wild West, with
an occasional Indian village, and a large wooden fort peeking through
the trees. It makes a restful interlude for foot-weary park-stompers.
 The Hall Of Presidents: American-history buffs ages 10 and older
most appreciate this show, which can be a real squirmer for
Chapter 12: Magic Kingdom 189

younger children. The Hall is an inspiring production based on
painstaking research, right down to the clothes — each president’s
costume reflects his period’s fashion, fabrics, and tailoring tech-
niques. The show begins with a film on the importance of the
Constitution projected on an immense 180-degree screen, then
the curtain rises on America’s leaders, from George Washington
through George W. Bush. Pay special attention to the roll call of
presidents. The animatronic figures are incredibly lifelike and amaz-
ingly impressive: they fidget, whisper, and talk to the audience. 
 The Haunted Mansion: Although this attraction has changed little
through the years, the mansion continues to be a favorite and even
has a cult following. (My editor makes a pilgrimage here every time
she hits the park, as do I.) It has detailed special effects (this was
one of the last rides Walt Disney actually had a hand in designing)
and an atmosphere that’s far more fun than creepy. You may
chuckle at the corny tombstones lining the entrance before you
hop aboard your Doom Buggy and are whisked past a ghostly ban-
quet and ball, a graveyard band, weird flying objects, and more.
And don’t forget the 999 spirits of the house, one of whom may try
to hitch a ride home with you. I always get a kick out of the fact
that Disney has to continually add dust and cobwebs to keep up
this attraction’s old and decrepit appearance. 
“The ghosts are really cool, but it’s not all that scary. The best part
is at the end when you see the ghost right next to you.” I whole-
heartedly agree with Ryan (age 12). The ride doesn’t get much
scarier than spooky music, eerie howling, and things that go bump
in the night. It’s best for those ages 6 and older however. FASTPASS
is recommended, as this attraction usually has a long line, though
you might be able to sneak right in at parade time.
Frontierland
Frontierland is located behind Adventureland and the rough-and-tumble
Old West architecture runs to log cabins and rustic saloons, while the
landscape is Southwestern scrubby with mesquite, cactus, yucca, and
prickly pear. Attractions in Frontierland include the following:
 Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: The lines don’t lie: This rocking
railroad is a favorite in Magic Kingdom. Thunder Mountain bounces
you around an old mining site, where you dodge floods, a bridge
collapse, rock slides, and other mayhem. The ride is something of
a low-grade roller coaster with speed and a lot of corkscrew action.
It has enough of a reputation that even first-time visitors make a
beeline for it. So if you can’t get to it as soon as the park opens,
FASTPASS is your best bet. Or give it a try late in the day, or when
a parade pulls most visitors away from the rides. Most Disney
coaster veterans maintain the ride is at its best after dark. 
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
190

“So Cool . . . you really whip around the mountain, I loved this
ride.” “It’s really fast and it kind of jerks you around when you are
turning, that’s so fun.” Austin and Nicolas are both right on the
money — the action is fast and a bit jerky, especially compared to
some of the newer monster rides. The ride can be too intense for
kids younger than 6 (and for those with neck problems); riders
must be at least 40 inches tall.
 Country Bear Jamboree: The stars of this 15-minute animatronic
show are the gigantic bumbling country bears, crooning country-
and-western tunes and completely corny jokes. The Jamboree is a
park standard — a show that’s been around since Disney invented
dirt — but it’s still a huge hit with Disney buffs and little kids. The
audience gets caught up in the hand-clapping, knee-slapping, foot-
stomping fun as Trixie laments lost love while she sings “Tears Will
Be the Chaser for Your Wine.” Teddi Beara descends from the ceil-
ing in a swing to perform “Heart, I Did All That I Could,” and Big Al
moans “Blood in the Saddle.” It’s a great way to cool off with tired
toddlers, so sit back and relax for a spell.
“You can’t be serious,” were the words uttered by my 12-year-old
as he rushed past in search of Splash Mountain. Unless you have
an affinity for all things Disney or have younger children (5 and
under), this might be best saved for those really hot days when you
need a break inside. Most teens, young adults, and repeat visitors
won’t want to do it, even then. 
 Frontierland Shootin’ Arcade: Combining state-of-the-art elec-
tronics with a traditional shooting-gallery format, this arcade offers
97 targets (slow-moving ore cars, buzzards, and gravediggers) in
an 1850s boomtown scenario. If you hit a tombstone, it may spin
around and mysteriously change its epitaph. Coyotes howl, bridges
creak, and skeletal arms reach out from the grave. To keep things
authentic, newfangled electronic firing mechanisms with infrared
bullets are concealed in genuine buffalo rifles. When you hit a
target, you set off sound and motion gags. Fifty cents fetches
25 shots. Younger kids may find this more frustrating than fun.
 Splash Mountain: If I had to pick one ride as the Kingdom’s most
popular, Splash Mountain would be it (that should properly prepare
you for the lines — sometimes longer than 2 hours — you will most
definitely end up experiencing). It’s on par with SeaWorld’s Journey
to Atlantis (see Chapter 20), though half a click below Jurassic Park
River Adventure at Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19). Still, it
has a flair that only Disney can deliver. Splash Mountain is a nifty
voyage through the world of Disney’s classic film Song of the South,
past 26 colorful and delightful scenes that include backwoods
swamps, bayous, some spooky caves, and waterfalls. You ride in
a hollow log flume as Brer Fox and Brer Bear chase the ever-wily
Brer Rabbit and end your journey with a 52-foot, 45-degree, 40 mph
finish, with an impressively high splash factor (around 200 mega-
tons worth of wet) that thoroughly soaks you and anyone remotely
Chapter 12: Magic Kingdom 191

close by. If you’re lucky enough to have some real heavyweights
in the front seat, look for a little extra explosion on the five-story
downhill. While FASTPASS is available, this is one that runs out
early.
In summer, this ride can provide sweet relief from the heat and
humidity, but in cool weather, parents may want to protect their
kids (and themselves) from a chill. Splash Mountain is recommended
for ages 8 and older. If they’re unsure if they want to ride, let them
watch from the bridge for a few minutes — they’ll make up their
minds after they see one or two logs make the drop. Riders must be
at least 40 inches tall.
On warmer days, the ride shoots out a spray of water onto the
viewing bridge in front of the big drop. If you want to catch your
friends unaware for a good soaking, count the log drops: Every
third one emits a good spray.
 Tom Sawyer Island: Board Huck Finn’s raft for a 2-minute float
across a river to this densely forested island, where kids can
explore Injun Joe’s Cave (complete with such scary sound effects
as whistling wind), navigate a swinging bridge, and explore an old
wooden fort. Narrow, winding dirt paths lined with oaks, pines, and
sycamores create an authentic backwoods atmosphere. It’s easy to
get briefly lost and stumble upon some unexpected adventure. It’s
a great place for kids to lose a little excess energy and for moms
and dads to relax and maybe indulge in lunch or a snack at Aunt
Polly’s, which overlooks the river. 
“It fun just being able to run around, not wait in all the lines.”
“The caves and the bridges were really cool but so was the whole
island.” Nicolas and Austin, ages 10 and 8, weren’t the only ones
who gave it great reviews — everyone in the family concurred. 
Adventureland
Adventureland is a left turn just at the end of Main Street. Kids can
engage in swashbuckling behavior while walking through dense tropical
foliage (complete with vines) or marauding through bamboo and thatch-
roofed huts. The architecture here is a combination of the Caribbean,
Southeast Asia, and Polynesia Walt Disney wanted this section of the
park to exude romance, mystery, and (duh!) adventure. There’s plenty of
the latter here, especially for kids, though you may have more trouble
finding the first two. Here is a list of some of the most popular attrac-
tions in Adventureland:
 The Enchanted Tiki Room: Upgraded over the years, the show’s
newest cast member is Iago of Aladdin fame. This attraction is set
in a Polynesian-style building with thatched roof, bamboo beams,
and tapa-bark murals. Other players include 250 tropical birds,
chanting totem poles, and singing flowers that whistle, tweet, and
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
192

warble. The show runs continuously throughout the day. Young
children are most likely to appreciate this one (though beware the
very young, under 2, may be frightened by the loud noises), but
so will nostalgic adults. Otherwise, consider this only as a respite
from the heat.
 Jungle Cruise: Give Disney 10 minutes, it gives you four famous
rivers on three different continents. This narrated voyage on the
Congo, Amazon, Mekong, and Nile rivers offers glimpses of anima-
tronic animals, tropical and subtropical foliage (most of it real), a
temple-of-doom–type camp, and lots of surprises. The ride passes
animatronic pythons, elephants, rhinos, gorillas, and hippos that
pop threateningly out of the water and blow snot — well, it could’ve
been snot if they weren’t robots — on you. This exhibit is about
30 years old, which means it’s pretty hokey at times, but it’s still
a nice way to relax if the lines don’t stretch too long (though the
waiting area for this ride does offer some amusing moments —
check out the prop menus on the walls).
 The Magic Carpets of Aladdin: The first major ride added in
Adventureland since 1971 delights wee ones and even some older
kids. Its 16 four-passenger carpets circle the giant genie’s bottle
while camels spit water at unsuspecting riders in much the same
way riders are spritzed at One Fish, Two Fish at Islands of Adventure
(see Chapter 19). As the fiberglass carpets spin, you can move them
up, down, forward, and back. 
If the lines are too long at Dumbo (see the “Fantasyland” section,
earlier in this chapter), this is a good alternative, as the rides are
similar and the lines here aren’t nearly as sluggish.
 Pirates of the Caribbean: This oldie-but-goodie is another cult
favorite (a Disney archivist confessed to me that it’s still his
favorite, which should be no great surprise given that this is
another ride that Walt Disney had a hand in creating). After walking
through a long, and somewhat eerie, grotto, you board a boat
headed into a dark cave where you are warned that “Dead men tell
no tales.” Therein, elaborate scenery and hundreds of incredibly
detailed (some of Disney’s best) animatronic figures re-create an
almost refreshingly non-P.C. Caribbean town overrun by bucca-
neers. To a background of cheerful yo-ho-ho music, the sound of
rushing waterfalls, squawking seagulls, and screams of terror, pas-
sengers pass through the line of fire into a raging raid and panorama
of almost fierce-looking pirates swigging rum, looting, and plunder-
ing. This ride, in addition to being one of the best in the park, is
another great place to cool off on a hot day. 
“The drop takes you by surprise — that’s pretty cool, and the
pirates are great, it’s almost like being in the middle of the movie.”
Kids ages 5 and younger may find a pirate’s life a bit too scary,
especially with the small drop in the dark. Most kids 6 or older,
Chapter 12: Magic Kingdom 193

though, will enjoy it. The recent Oscar-nominated film based on the
ride (alas, there’s no Johnny Depp to be found here) has made it
even more popular with the young and teen set, who have fun spot-
ting the scenes appropriated by the movie. 
Offer a tip of your head to the parrot who sits above the ride’s
entrance plaza and you may get a hearty greeting in response. 
 Swiss Family Treehouse: The story of the shipwrecked Swiss
Family Robinson (via the 1960 Disney film of the same name)
comes alive in this attraction made for swinging, exploring, and
crawling fun. The “tree,” designed by Disney Imagineers, has
330,000 polyethylene leaves sprouting from a 90-foot span of
branches; although it isn’t real, it’s draped with actual Spanish
moss. It’s simple and void of all that high-tech stuff that’s popular
in today’s parks, but that’s what makes it so fun. 
Be prepared to stand in a slow-moving line on busy days — the
only thing that moves on this one are your feet, so the experience
is only as fast paced as the people ahead of you make it. The attrac-
tion is also difficult for travelers with limited mobility to navigate.
My younger kids (those under 8) thought it was neat, while the
older ones moved onward to bigger adventures.
Parades and fireworks
Disney excels at producing fanfare, and its parades and fireworks dis-
plays are among the best of their kind in the world. Note, however, that
some productions are staged only on a limited basis or during certain
times of the year. Grab a times guide when you arrive. It includes an
entertainment schedule that lists special goings-on for the day, including
concerts, encounters with characters, holiday events, and other major
happenings. If you want to know whether a specific parade or fireworks
show will be staged when you’re in town, consult the calendar at www.
disneyworld.com or call % 407-934-7639. 
During fireworks and parades, Disney ropes off designated viewing spots
for travelers with disabilities and their parties. Consult your park map or
a park employee at least an hour before the parade, or you may have
trouble making it through the crowds to get to the designated spots.
Additionally, if there are two showings of a parade, the later one is usu-
ally less crowded.
If nobody in your party is a huge parade fan, these are the best times
to ride some of the more popular attractions — while everyone else is
lined up along the parade route. You can also use the Walt Disney World
Railroad (mentioned earlier in the chapter) to navigate around the vari-
ous areas of the park when the parade route has blocked off most major
routes through the park.

Here are Disney’s best parades and fireworks displays:
 Wishes Nighttime Spectacular: This explosive display debuted in
fall 2003 and is touched off nightly at closing, except during the
summer and on holidays when extended park hours allow for
the fireworks to be shown between two scheduled showings of
SpectroMagic (see next in this list). Before the display, Tinker Bell
flies magically from Cinderella Castle. Then as a cacophany of intri-
cately choreographed fireworks fills the skies, and Jiminy Crickett
narrates, images are projected onto the castle in time to the medley
of Disney songs being broadcast parkwide. Suggested viewing areas
include almost anywhere on the front side of Cinderella Castle,
including the very front of Liberty Square and Frontierland. The
back of Liberty Square, Frontierland, and Mickey’s Toontown Fair
offer views as well, though some of the spectacular effects get a
bit lost from behind. Disney hotels close to the park (the Grand
Floridian, Polynesian, Contemporary, and Wilderness Lodge —
all reviewed in Chapter 9) also offer views, as the fireworks display
is rather large. This show can make even the most blasé fireworks
watcher say “wow!”
 SpectroMagic Parade: This after-dark parade combines fiber optics,
holographic images, clouds of liquid nitrogen, old-fashioned twin-
kling lights, and a soundtrack featuring classic Disney tunes. Mickey,
dressed in an amber and purple grand magician’s cape, makes an
appearance in a confetti of light. You’ll also see the SpectroMen atop
the title float, and Chernabog, Fantasia’s monstrous demon, who
unfolds his 38-foot wingspan. It takes the electrical equivalent of
seven lightning bolts (enough to power a fleet of 2,000 trucks) to
bring the show to life. 
SpectroMagic plays only on limited nights, when park closing extends
past dusk (generally during busy periods and on weekends). When
park hours are extended to 10 p.m. or later, there are often two
chances to view the parade. Check your show schedule to deter-
mine availability.
 Share a Dream Come True Parade: This parade honors the 100th
anniversary of Uncle Walt’s birth (which has come and gone though
the parade lives on). Loads of characters (over 110 cast members
take part) march up Main Street and into Frontierland in gigantic
snowglobes on a daily basis. It’s one of the most popular parades in
the park since it takes place during the height of the day.

rab a big pot. Start with a theme park foundation, stir in a heaping
helping of technology, and add splashes of global architecture, street
performers, and interactive exhibits. What do you have? Epcot, a science
field trip combined with a whirlwind tour of the world — without the jet
lag, although some say it’s just as draining when you try to experience it
in one day.
Walt Disney wanted his “Experimental Prototype Community of
Tomorrow” to be a high-tech city. But, when it opened 15 years after his
death, it was a theme park, and the name was shortened to an acronym,
Epcot, because, well, it looked good in the snazzy Disney brochures. 
While the Magic Kingdom is every child’s dream, Epcot isn’t. It’s techno
and worldly. Epcot is best suited for older children (over 8) and adults
with vivid imaginations or cravings to know how things work — or will
work in the future. It’s the least friendly of the Disney parks for those
younger than 8, even with Disney’s relatively recent additions that were
intended to keep the younger members of the family entertained. If you
have wee ones, or if all your kids are under the age of 6, I recommend
skipping it this time around. If, on the other hand, you have older kids or
an inquiring mind yourself, I suggest at least a two-day visit because it’s
so vast and varied. In the World Showcase, you experience exotic, far-
flung lands without a passport; you can visit China’s Temple of Heaven,
or Italy’s St. Mark’s Square. In Future World, you can jump into the third
millennium as you explore cutting-edge technology and the latest and
greatest thrill rides.
Discovering Epcot’s Essentials
Before helping you dive into Epcot’s attractions, I need to get a few prac-
tical matters out of the way.

Buying tickets and making reservations
Tickets to Epcot cost $60 for a one-day adult admission, $48 for kids
ages 3 to 9, but prices frequently change. See Chapter 11 for other admis-
sion options.
Tickets aren’t the only thing you’ll find that deplete your stash of cash.
The prices of consumables are pretty much standard among Disney
parks. Epcot will put you out $2 or more for a soda or milk, $1.25 to $2
for bottled water, $2.40 for an ice-cream bar, and $1.90 for a cup of coffee
or cocoa.
You can make Advanced Dining Reservations (see Chapter 10) at Guest
Relations in the Plaza area, though it’s best to make them ahead of time
by calling % 407-939-3463.
Future World usually is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and sometimes as
late as 10 p.m. World Showcase usually opens at 11 a.m. or noon and
generally remains open until 9 p.m., sometimes later.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATM machines accept cards from banks using Cirrus, STAR, and
Plus. You can find them at the front of the park, in The American
Pavilion (near the very back), and on the bridge between World
Showcase and Future World.
 The baby-changing area for Epcot is located in the Baby Care
Center near the Odyssey Center in Future World. It sells dispos-
able diapers, formula, baby food, and pacifiers. Changing tables are
in all women’s and some men’s restrooms.
 You can buy disposable cameras and film throughout the park,
although supplies for digital cameras are few and far between.
 Registered nurses staff the First Aid Center. It’s located near the
Odyssey Center in Future World.
 Lockers are located west of Spaceship Earth, outside the Entrance
Plaza, and in the Bus Information Center by the bus parking lot.
The cost is $7 a day, plus a $2 deposit.
 Lost children are usually taken to Earth Center or the Baby Care
Center. Children under 7 should wear name-tags on the inside of
their clothing.
 You can send packages from any store in the park to Guest Relations
in the Plaza area, where you can pick them up all at once at the end
of the day. (This service is free.) Allow three hours for delivery. A
package pickup also is located at the International Gateway entrance

in the World Showcase. Disney resort guests can have their pur-
chases sent directly to their hotels. 
 You can arrange pet care for $6 a day at kennels outside the
Entrance Plaza at Epcot (% 407-824-6568). Proof of vaccination is
required. Four other kennels are available in the WDW complex.
 Rent strollers east of the Entrance Plaza and at World Showcase’s
International Gateway. The cost is $8 for a single and $15 for a
double. The prices include a $1 refundable deposit.
 Rent wheelchairs inside the Entrance Plaza to your left, to the
right of ticket booths at the Gift Shop, and at World Showcase’s
International Gateway. They cost $8, including a $1 refundable
deposit. Electric chairs cost $40 a day with a $10 deposit.
Call % 407-934-7639 or visit www.disneyworld.com to obtain addi-
tional information about WDW properties.
Touring Epcot’s Top Attractions
Epcot’s 300 acres are vibrantly landscaped, so enjoy the scenery on your
way through its two very distinctive areas, Future World and World
Showcase.
Epcot is big enough that walking around it can be exhausting (the World
Showcase semicircle alone is 1.3 miles). That’s why some people say
Epcot stands for “Every Person Comes Out Tired.” If you don’t spend
much time lingering in the World Showcase, you can see all Epcot in one
day, but you’ll need a vacation after you’re finished. A boat launch runs
from Future World to Germany or Morocco so unless you want the com-
plete world tour, this may be a great way to get a sampling of World
Showcase. The good news is that most of the attractions take a fair
amount of time, giving you a break between all that walking. 
To locate the attractions I discuss in the following sections, check out
the “Epcot” map on p.199.
Experiencing Future World
Most visitors enter Epcot through the main entrance at Future World
(there is, unlike at any other park, a back entrance where guests of the
BoardWalk, Swan, Dolphin, Yacht Club, and Beach Club resorts have
access by boat). Spaceship Earth, that thing that looks like the giant
silver golf ball meant for a club to fit Paul Bunyan, centers Future World.
Major corporations such as Hewlett Packard, General Motors, Nestlé,
and Kodak sponsor Future World’s nine themed areas. The exhibits
focus on discovery, scientific achievements, and technology in areas
spanning from energy to undersea exploration.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
200

Innoventions: The Road to Tomorrow
The crescent-shaped buildings to your right and left, just beyond
Spaceship Earth, showcase cutting-edge technology and future products
in the Innoventions exhibit. The headliner in the building to the left
(Innoventions East) as you enter the park is House of Innoventions,
which offers a preview of tomorrow’s smart house (including a refrigera-
tor that can itemize and order groceries and a Jacuzzi with surround
sound). A recent addition is Plastic Works, where kids can build their
own robot and — bonus — they get to keep it for free. The Test the Limits
Lab exhibit has six kiosks that let kids and fun-loving adults try out a
variety of products. In one, you can pull a rope attached to a hammer
that crashes into a TV screen to see whether it’s shatter resistant. In
another, you can push a button that releases a magnet that falls onto a
firefighter’s helmet. Other exhibits focus on communications, the new
Segway transport device, and outer space.
Across the way at Innoventions West, crowds flock to Video Games of
Tomorrow, which has nearly three dozen game stations, and the Ultimate
Home Theater, which offers a look at the history of home entertainment
and a futuristic home set-up that will have couch potatoes salivating.
ThinkPlace presented by IBM looks at various interactive software pro-
grams (including voice recognition technology) and also features
Internet Postcards that allow you to take a picture and send it via e-mail
to family and friends back home. Where’s the Fire? is America’s largest
fire-safety display, where kids can get an up-close look at a life-size fire
truck and follow a lighted path through a burning house to safety. Other
diversions include a virtual-reality playground and a display highlighting
advances in the life sciences at The Great American Farm.
Journey into Imagination with Figment
Even the fountains in front of this pavilion are magical — shooting water
snakes through the air. (The fountains are popular with kids, who like to
try to catch water snakes and, in the process, get a good soaking.)
When the Journey into Imagination exhibit reopened in summer 2002
after a year-long refurbishment, it marked the return of an Epcot golden
oldie — Figment, a crazy-but-lovable purple dinosaur, who was a fixture
at Epcot until 1999 (his three-year disappearance was greeted with
major boos by Disneyphiles, who abandoned ship until he returned).
Things begin with an open house at the Imagination Institute, with Dr.
Nigel Channing (played by Monty Python’s Eric Idle) taking you on a
tour of the labs that demonstrate how the senses capture and control
one’s imagination. Figment arrives at each of the areas to prove it’s far,
far better to set your imagination free. He invites you to his upside-down
house, where a new perspective enhances your imagination. “One Little
Spark,” an upbeat ditty that debuted when the attraction opened in 1983,
has also been brought back. This ride is best for the younger set as older
kids may find it too tame. 
Chapter 13: Epcot 201

After you disembark from the ride, head for The Kodak “What If” Labs,
where your kids can burn lots of energy while exercising their imagina-
tions at a number of interactive stations that allow them to conduct
music, experiment with video, or transform themselves into animals.
The lab can be accessed from the outside as well, so older kids can
experiment while waiting for their younger siblings to ride along with
Figment.
The pavilion’s main attraction is the 3-D “Honey, I Shrunk the Audience”
ride, based on the Disney film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, in which you’re
caught up in all the mayhem of another shrinking experiment gone awry.
Inside, mice terrorize you and, after you’re shrunk, a large cat adds to
the trauma; then a giant 5-year-old gives you a good shaking. Vibrating
seats and sensory effects enhances all the 3-D action. In the end, every-
one is returned to proper size — but not the dog, who offers up one final
surprise. Kids under 4 may be frightened by some of the 3-D and special
effects; most older kids will be utterly amused. 
The Land Pavilion
The Land is Future World’s largest pavilion (a whopping 6 acres) and
showcases the wonders of food and the environment. Living with the
Land, a 14-minute boat ride through a simulated rain forest, an African
desert, and the Great Plains, may be a tad too dry for visitors not inter-
ested in agriculture. New farming methods and experiments ranging
from hydroponics to plants growing in simulated Martian soil are show-
cased in real gardens. 
A 45-minute Behind the Seeds walking tour for gardeners and others who
want a more detailed agricultural lesson is offered daily and costs $8 for
adults and $6 for kids 3 to 9. Sign up at the Green Thumb Emporium to
the right of the Sunshine Seasons food court area.
Live footage and animation mix in Circle of Life, a 15-minute, 70mm motion
picture based on The Lion King. The story line has Timon and Pumbaa
building a monument to the good life called Hakuna Matata Lakeside
Village, but their project, as Simba points out, is damaging the savanna
for other animals. It’s a fun, but pointed, environmental message.
The Land’s newest attraction is Soarin’, a ride borrowed from Disney’s
California Adventure park. The experience combines cinematic artistry
and state-of-the-art motion technology as you are seated in mock-gliders
and lifted 40 feet inside a giant projection screen dome. Completely 
surrounded with the beauty and wonder of the state of California, the
elevated seats take you on a scenic tour over the Golden Gate Bridge,
the Redwood forests, Napa Valley, and Yosemite, gliding and swooping
over the changing landscapes. You can even feel the sweeping winds and
smell fragrant orange blossoms and pine trees around you. The entire
experience is absolutely one of the best in all of Disney. It makes me
wonder if a version showcasing Florida’s highlights may be up next . . .
Epcot is in Florida after all. You must be 40 inches tall to ride. This is 
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
202

definitely a good candidate for FASTPASS as the lines are lengthy with
wait times of at least an hour, even during the slower seasons.
The Living Seas
The Living Seas pavilion has a 5.7 million-gallon aquarium filled with
more than 4,000 sharks, barracudas, rays, dolphins, and other reef fish.
It starts with a film, The Seas, demonstrating the formation of the Earth
and the seas as a means to support life. You also can see other exhibits
such as a diving barrel used by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. and Sir
Edmund Halley’s first diving bell (1697). After the films, you enter
“hydrolators” (a somewhat hokey elevator ride) and descend to the 
simulated ocean floor and Sea Base Alpha. The two-level base displays
numerous exhibits dealing with various aspects of marine science and
technology, and — most important of all — you get close-up views
through acrylic windows of real denizens of the deep, as they swim
amidst a man-made coral reef. Both kids and adults enjoy visiting the
rescued manatees (sea cows), which reside on the second level.
In the past I’ve complained that The Living Seas could be a snoozer for
younger kids unless they are fascinated by the sea. Disney must have
been listening, because they’ve added a few attractions that are sure
to keep kids younger than 10 entertained. Turtle Talk with Crush, an
interactive theater presentation, captivates kids’ attention as well as
their hearts. In a small theater adults are seated on benches in the back
while children are asked to sit on the floor right in front of the screen
(which, for the moment, looks like a giant underwater viewing area).
After a brief introduction, Crush, a 152-year old sea turtle from the film
Finding Nemo, appears swimming around, chit-chatting to himself and,
before you know it, with the kids — and I mean really conversing.
Chapter 13: Epcot 203
Water-cooler conversations
Many an ordinary item at Disney World has hidden entertainment value. Take a sip of
water at the drinking fountain in Epcot’s Innoventions Plaza (the one right next to the
Mouse Gear shop close to Innoventions East) and it may beg you not to drink it dry. No,
you haven’t gotten too much sun — the fountain actually talks (much to the delight of
kids and the surprise of unsuspecting adults). A few more talking fountains are scat-
tered around Epcot. 
The fountains aren’t the only items at WDW that talk. I’ve kibitzed with a walking and
talking garbage can (named PUSH) in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom (he’s been
known to make appearances at Epcot as well). An assortment of sassy (if not mobile)
garbage cans are also in place at the Magic Kingdom inside Cosmic Ray’s Starlight
Cafe. And a personable palm tree (who goes by Wes Palm) may strike up a conversa-
tion with you at Animal Kingdom. Ask a Disney employee to direct you if you want to
meet any of these chatty contraptions.

Through some amazing technology and animation the talking turtle can
“see” the audience, pick out whose question he’d like to answer by
describing their clothing, and actually respond to their questions. Kids
love it.
Disney has also added a small play area where little ones can expend
some of their extra energy. Bruce’s Sub House features some larger
than life (albeit animated) sharks to climb on, in, and around. 
Epcot’s DiveQuest program enables certified divers ages 10 and up
(those between 10 and 14 are required to have an adult participate along
with them) to take part in a three-hour program that includes a 30-
minute dive in the Living Seas aquarium. The program costs $140. Call
% 407-939-8687 for details. Keep in mind, however, that that you get
more dolphins for your money at Discovery Cove (see Chapter 20).
Spaceship Earth
Epcot’s iconic, silvery geosphere houses an attraction of the same
name, a slow-track journey back to the roots of communications. The 
15-minute ride begins with Cro-Magnon cave painting and then advances
to Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Phoenician and Greek alphabets, the
Gutenberg printing press, and the Renaissance. Technologies develop at
a rapid pace, through the telegraph, telephone, radio, movies, and TV.
It’s but a short step to the age of electronic communications. You’re cat-
apulted (though slowly) into outer space to see Spaceship Earth from a
new perspective, returning for a finale that places the audience amid
interactive global networks. Unfortunately, the presentation is not par-
ticularly engaging, and I recommend that you skip it unless it’s a really
hot day or you need time off your feet.
Test Track
Test Track is a $60 million marvel of a ride that combines GM engineer-
ing and Disney Imagineering. You can wait in line an hour or more during
peak periods, so use FASTPASS. (See Chapter 11 for more information
about beating the long lines.) During the last part of your wait, you snake
through displays about corrosion, crash tests, and more. The 5-minute
ride follows what looks to be an actual highway. It includes braking
tests, a hill climb, and tight S-curves in a six-passenger “convertible.”
The left front seat offers the most thrills as the vehicle moves through
the curves. There’s also a 12-second burst of heart-pumping speed to
the tune of 65 mph on the straightaway (with no traffic!). It’s one of the
best thrill rides in Epcot, and for those who can’t stomach roller coast-
ers, it offers a few thrills that you most likely can handle.
“The beginning is a lot of stopping and starting but once you hit 60 it’s a
blast.” Ryan liked it, but it may be too intense for those younger than 10,
and it has a 40-inch height minimum. The single-rider line (which allows
singles to fill in vacant spots in select cars) can speed up your wait time
if all the FASTPASSES are gone — which really happens! — but you have
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
204

to be willing to split up your party to use it. Also keep in mind that rain
will shut it down, so head here early in the day if there’s even the slight-
est chance of a sprinkle. 
Mission: SPACE
The headliner for Mission: SPACE is a motion simulator like those used
by astronauts training for space. (Think G-force and weightlessness.)
You assume the role of commander, pilot, navigator, or engineer, depend-
ing on where you sit, and must complete related jobs vital to a flight to
the Red Planet (don’t worry if you miss your cue, you won’t crash). The
ride uses a combination of visuals, sound, and centrifugal force to create
the illusion of a launch and trip to Mars. As the launch begins, your
rocket rumbles under you, white clouds of steam billow around you, and
you shoot into the galaxy. Of course, there are some unexpected twists
and turns that require you to react pronto in order to complete your
mission successfully. Even veteran roller-coaster riders who tried the
simulator said the sensation mimics a liftoff, as riders are pressed into
their seats and the roar and vibration tricks the brain during the launch
portion of the 4-minute adventure.
In the pre-ride show, you go to the futuristic International Space Training
Center and then proceed to the Ready Room where you learn your role
as commander, pilot, navigator, or engineer from CapCom (played by
actor Gary Sinese, who co-starred in Apollo 13). 
This is probably one of the most physically intense rides at Disney. If
you are prone to motion sickness from spinning, have a sinus infection,
or experience severe claustrophobia, do not ride this attraction. There’s
a reason they put motion sickness bags in each capsule and post all the
warnings. Once the door of your pod closes, that’s it, there’s no escape.
You’re going to Mars whether you like it or not. If the experience gets
too much mid-trip, a Disney Imagineer told me that focusing straight
ahead can help minimize the effects, and he warned against closing your
eyes as that actually enhances the ride’s intensity.
So you know, if you’re taller (or shorter, in the case of younger kids)
than average, you may have difficulties seeing the screen from the opti-
mum perspective or handling the controls from the optimum angle. 
“It was awesome — the whole ride was intense, but awesome.” 12-year-
old Ryan, who has an intense hatred for roller coasters, survived and
was even smiling after the ride, but be aware that it may be too intense
for those younger than 10 and has a 44-inch height minimum.
Universe of Energy
Sponsored by Exxon, Universe of Energy has a roof full of solar panels
and a goal of bettering your understanding of America’s energy prob-
lems and potential solutions. Ellen’s Energy Adventure, the pavilion’s 
32-minute ride, features comedienne Ellen DeGeneres tutored by Bill Nye
Chapter 13: Epcot 205

the Science Guy to be a Jeopardy! champ. An animated movie depicts
the Earth’s molten beginnings, its cooling process, and the formation
of fossil fuels. You then move back 275 million years into an eerie, 
storm-wracked landscape of the Mesozoic Era. Giant audio-animatronic
dragonflies, pterodactyls, dinosaurs, earthquakes, and streams of molten
lava threaten before you enter a misty tunnel deep in the bowels of a vol-
cano. When you emerge into a giant space that looks like a NASA control
room, a 70mm film projected on a massive 210-foot wraparound screen
depicts the challenges of the world’s increasing energy demands and the
emerging technologies that will help meet them. The show ends on an
upbeat note — a vision of an energy-abundant future and Ellen as a new
Jeopardy! champion. The ride itself is a bit slow moving (literally), but
the bits featuring Ellen are funny, and it’s a good place to escape the
heat. Younger kids may find brief parts of the film a bit intense and the
fleeting appearance of the dinosaurs a tad too lifelike. 
Wonders of Life
The focus of the Wonders of Life pavilion (you can’t miss the giant DNA
strand that marks its entrance) is on health and biology.
The entire Wonders of Life pavilion began opening on a limited schedule
(mostly during peak crowds to alleviate long lines on other rides) in
January 2004, prompting speculation that a new exhibit may be installed
here within the next few years.
The Making of Me, starring Martin Short, is a 15-minute film combining
live action with animation and spectacular in utero photography to
create a sweet introduction to the facts of life. Short travels back in time
to witness his parents as children, their meeting at a college dance, their
wedding, and their decision to have a baby. Alongside him, Making of Me
visitors view his development inside the womb and witness his birth.
The presentation may prompt some pointed questions from young 
children — if you’re not ready for them, think about heading them off
and heading elsewhere; I recommend it for ages 10 and older.
Didn’t get your fill of being shrunk at Imagination? Haven’t been shaken
up enough on a simulator? Try Body Wars, where you’re reduced to the
size of a cell for a rescue mission inside a human’s immune system
(it reminds many sci-fi fans of the Isaac Asimov classic novel Fantastic
Voyage). This motion-simulator takes you on a wild ride through gale-
force winds in the lungs and pounding heart chambers. It’s nowhere
near as cool as the similar Star Tours attraction at Disney–MGM Studios
(see Chapter 14), but is still fun.
Engineers designed this ride from the last row of the car, so that’s the
best place to sit to get the most bang for your buck. Riders must be at
least 40 inches tall to climb aboard.
In the hilarious Cranium Command, Buzzy, an animatronic brain-pilot-in-
training in the Cranium Commando Squad, is charged with the daunting
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
206

task of controlling the brain of Bobby, a 12-year-old boy, during adoles-
cent traumas that include meeting a girl and a run-in with the principal.
The audience is seemingly seated inside Bobby’s head as Buzzy guides
him through his day — and gets chewed out every now and then by his
animated C.O., General Knowledge. Well-known actors and comedians,
including Charles Grodin, Jon Lovitz, and Dana Carvey, play the boy’s
body parts. This must-see attraction has a very loyal fan following and is
good for all ages.
Don’t skip the very funny pre-show film at this attraction, as it sets up
the action that happens inside. 
At The Fitness Fairgrounds, you can have your tennis, golf, or baseball
swing analyzed by experts. You can also get a computer-generated eval-
uation of your health habits or ride the exercycles, touring through
Disney via video.
Traveling through the World Showcase
World Showcase is enjoyed mainly by adults or older kids with an
appreciation of world history and cultural shows. Its 11 miniature
nations, each re-created with meticulous detail, open at 11 a.m. daily and
surround the parks 40-acre lagoon. All the showcase’s countries have
authentically indigenous architecture, landscaping, background music,
restaurants, and shops. The nations’ cultural facets are explored in art
exhibits, song and dance performances, and innovative rides, films, and
attractions. And all the employees at each of the pavilions are natives of
the country represented.
Most of these nations offer some kind of live entertainment throughout
the day. You may see acrobats, bagpipers, mariachi bands, storytellers,
belly dancers, and stilt walkers. Characters regularly appear in the
Showcase Plaza. Check your guide map/show schedule when you enter
the park. You can also find schedules posted near the entrance to each
country.
Those with kids should grab a copy of the Epcot Kids’ Guide at Guest
Relations upon entering the park; it uses a “K” in a red square to note
Kidcot Fun Stops inside the World Showcase. These play and learning 
stations are for the younger set and allow them to stop at various World
Showcase countries, do crafts, get autographs, have Kidcot passports
stamped (these are available for purchase in most Epcot stores and make
a great souvenir), and chat with cast members native to those countries.
Your kids will get the chance to learn about different countries and make a
souvenir to bring home. For more information, stop in at Guest Relations
when you get into the park. The stations open at 1 p.m. daily.
Finally, excellent shopping and dining opportunities are available at all
the pavilions. For details on dining inside the World Showcase, see
Chapter 10; shopping information can be found in Chapter 17.
Chapter 13: Epcot 207

Canada
The pavilion’s highlight attraction is O Canada! — a dazzling, 18-minute,
360-degree CircleVision film that shows Canada’s scenic wonders, from
sophisticated Montréal to the thundering flight of thousands of snow
geese departing the St. Lawrence River.
The theater has no seats and you stand for the entire production
(though there are lean rails).
The architecture and landscape in Canada include a mansard-roofed
replica of Ottawa’s 19th-century Château Laurier (here called the Hôtel
du Canada) and an Indian village complete with 30-foot replicas of
Ojibwa totem poles. The Canadian wilderness is reflected by a rocky
mountain (really made of concrete and chicken wire); a waterfall cascad-
ing into a whitewater stream; and a mini forest of evergreens, stately
cedars, maples, and birch trees. Don’t miss the stunning floral display
inspired by Victoria’s world-renowned Butchart Gardens. Off Kilter enter-
tains visitors with New Age Celtic music.
China
You enter Epcot’s version of China through a triple-arched ceremonial
gate inspired by the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, a summer retreat for
Chinese emperors. Passing through the gate, you’ll see a half-size replica
of this ornately embellished red-and-gold circular temple, built in 1420
during the Ming dynasty. Gardens simulate those at Suzhou, with minia-
ture waterfalls, lotus ponds, and bamboo groves.
Inside the temple, you can watch Reflections of China, a 20-minute 360-
degree CircleVision film that explores the culture and landscapes in and
around seven Chinese cities. It visits Beijing, Shanghai, and the Great
Wall (begun 24 centuries ago!), among other places. 
Like Canada, the theater here has no seats and you stand for the entire
production (though there are lean rails).
Land of Many Faces is an exhibit that introduces China’s ethnic peoples,
and entertainment is provided daily by the amazing Dragon Legend
Acrobats.
France
This pavilion focuses on France’s Belle Époque (Beautiful Age) — the
period from 1870 to 1910 — when art, literature, and architecture ruled.
You enter via a replica of the beautiful cast-iron Pont des Arts footbridge
over the Seine and find yourself in a park with bleached sycamores,
Bradford pear trees, flowering crape myrtle, and sculptured parterre
flower gardens inspired by Seurat’s painting A Sunday Afternoon on the
Island of La Grande Jatte. The grounds also include a 1⁄10-scale model of the
Eiffel Tower, which was built from Gustave Eiffel’s original blueprints.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
208

The premiere attraction here is Impressions de France. Shown in the pala-
tial Palais du Cinema, a sit-down theater à la Fontainebleau, this 18-minute
film is a journey through diverse French landscapes projected on a vast,
200-degree wraparound screen. Outside, grab a French pastry and watch
the antics of Serveur Amusant, a comedic waiter, or the visual comedy of
Le Mime Roland.
Germany
Enclosed by castle walls, Germany offers ’wursts, oompah bands, and
a rollicking atmosphere. The clock tower in the central platz (plaza) is
embellished with a glockenspiel that heralds each hour with quaint
melodies. The Biergarten was inspired by medieval Rothenberg, while
16th-century building façades replicate a merchant’s hall in the Black
Forest and the town hall in Frankfurt’s Römerberg Square.
If you’re a model-train fanatic or visiting with young kids, don’t miss the
exquisitely detailed version of a small Bavarian town, complete with
working train station, located between Germany and Italy.
Italy
Italy lures visitors over an arched stone footbridge to a replica of Venice’s
intricately ornamented pink-and-white Doge’s Palace. Other architectural
highlights include the 83-foot Campanile (bell tower) of St. Mark’s Square,
Venetian bridges, and a piazza enclosing a version of Bernini’s Neptune
Fountain. A garden wall suggests a backdrop of provincial countryside,
and citrus, cypress, pine, and olive trees frame a formal garden. Gondolas
are moored on the lagoon.
In the street entertainment department, the seemingly lifeless forms of
Imaginum, A Statue Act fascinate visitors young and old daily, and the
hilarious World Showcase Players, who, at press time, were seen spoofing
Shakespeare’s Italian-set Taming of the Shrew here.
Japan
A flaming red torii (gate of honor) on the banks of the lagoon and the
graceful blue-roofed Goju No To pagoda, inspired by an 8th-century
shrine built at Nara, welcome you to the Japan pavilion, which focuses
on Japan’s ancient culture. If you have some leisure time, enjoy the
exquisitely cultivated Japanese garden — it’s a haven of tranquility 
in a place that’s anything but, and 90 percent of the plants you see are
actually native to Japan. The Shishinden, inspired by the ceremonial
and coronation hall found in the Imperial Palace grounds at Kyoto, is
home to Mitsukoshi’s department store (discussed in Chapter 17). The
Bijutsu-kan Gallery offers rotating exhibits ranging from 18th-century
Bunraki puppets to Japanese baseball.
Make sure that you include a performance of traditional Taiko drumming
by Matsuriza, which entertains guests daily. Japanese storytellers offer
up native tales every now and then.
Chapter 13: Epcot 209

Mexico
The music of mariachi bands greets you at Mexico’s festive showcase,
fronted by a Mayan pyramid modeled on the Aztec temple of Quetzalcoatl
(God of Life) and surrounded by dense Yucatán jungle landscaping. Just
inside the pavilion’s entrance, a museum exhibits rare Oaxacan wood
sculptures. Also inside the pyramid you’ll find an open-air marketplace
filled with artisans peddling their wares under the star-filled skies above
(it’s always nighttime here) behind which is El Rio del Tiempo (River of
Time), an eight-minute cruise through Mexico’s past and present (the
audio-animatronic dolls you encounter en-route may remind you of those
in Magic Kingdom’s It’s a Small World). Along the river route, passengers
get a close-up look at the Mayan pyramid and the erupting Popocatepetl
volcano. 
Mariachi Cobre, a 12-piece mariachi ensemble, performs Tuesday
through Saturday.
Morocco
A replica of the world famous Koutoubia Minaret, the prayer tower of a
12th-century mosque in Marrakesh, overlooks the very atmospheric
pavilion of Morocco, featuring the architectural styles of several cities
inside the North African kingdom. The exotic ambiance is enhanced by
geometrically patterned tile work, hand-painted wood ceilings, and brass
lighting fixtures. The Medina (old city), entered via a replica of an arched
gateway in Fez, leads to a traditional Moroccan home and the narrow,
winding streets of the souk, a bustling marketplace where authentic hand-
icrafts are on display. The Medina’s courtyard centers on a replica of the
ornately tiled Najjarine Fountain in Fez. 
The Gallery of Arts and History contains ever-changing exhibits of
Moroccan art. A guided tour of the pavilion, Treasures of Morocco, runs
three times daily. (Check your show schedule.) Speaking of shows, the
band Mo’Rockin’ kicks things up with Arabian rock music.
Norway
The Norway pavilion’s stave church, located off a charming cobblestone
plaza and styled after the 13th-century Gol Church of Hallingdal, features
changing exhibits focusing on Norwegian art and culture. A replica of
Oslo’s 14th-century Akershus Castle is the setting for the pavilion’s restau-
rant (see Chapter 10). Other buildings simulate the red-roofed cottages of
Bergen and the timber-sided farm buildings of the Nordic woodlands.
Norway includes a two-part attraction. Maelstrom, a boat ride in a
dragon-headed Viking vessel, travels Norway’s fjords and mythical
forests to the music of Peer Gynt. Along the way, you see polar bears
prowling the shore and are turned into frogs by trolls that cast a spell
on your boat. The watercraft crashes through a narrow gorge (two
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
210

small separate drops) and spins into the North Sea, where a storm is
in progress. (Don’t worry — this is a relatively calm ride, though some
of mthe thunder elements may frighten the very young.) The storm
abates, a princess’s kiss turns you into a human again, and you disem-
bark to a 10th-century Viking village to view the 70mm film Norway, 
highlighting history and culture (you can proceed through the theater
to the exit if you don’t want to watch the film).
Spelmanns Gledje plays lively Norwegian folk music.
United Kingdom
The United Kingdom pavilion evokes Merry Olde England through its
Britannia Square — a London-style park complete with copper-roofed
gazebo bandstand, a stereotypical red phone booth (it really works!), an
old-fashioned pub, a thatched cottage, and a statue of the Bard. Four
centuries of architecture — from the Tudor era all the way through the
English Regency period — line cobblestone streets. In the horticulture
department, there’s a formal garden with low box hedges in geometric
patterns, and the flagstone paths and a stone fountain replicate the land-
scaping of 16th- and 17th-century palaces.
Don’t miss The British Invasion, a group that impersonates the Beatles;
vivacious pub pianist Pam Brody; and Jason Wethington, a pub magician
who offers up Disney magic of the sleight-of-hand variety.
U.S.A. — The American Adventure
This flagship pavilion’s main building is a 108,000-square-foot Georgian
mansion and occupies the central spot in the World Showcase. Notable
U.S. landmarks that inspired Disney’s Imagineers in the design of the
building include Independence Hall, Monticello, and Colonial Williamsburg.
The action takes place in an elegant colonial-style 1,024-seat theater
loaded with Corinthian columns, chandeliers, and 12 marble statues 
symbolizing the 12 “Spirits of America.” The flags you pass under as you
enter the theater — 44 in all — include every one that has flown over the
United States throughout its history.
The actual production, a 29-minute CliffsNotes version of U.S. history,
utilizes a 72-foot rear-projection screen, rousing music, and a large cast
of lifelike audio-animatronic figures, including narrators Mark Twain and
Ben Franklin. You follow the voyage of the Mayflower, watch Jefferson
writing the Declaration of Independence, and witness Matthew Brady
photographing a family that the Civil War is about to divide. You can also
witness Pearl Harbor and the Eagle going to the moon. Teddy Roosevelt
discusses the need for national parks; Susan B. Anthony speaks out on
women’s rights; Frederick Douglass discusses slavery; and Chief Joseph
talks about the plight of Native Americans. It’s one of Disney’s best his-
torical productions.

Entertainment includes the Spirit of America Fife & Drum Corps and the
Voices of Liberty a cappella group, which sings patriotic songs in the lobby
of the main theater between shows. Large-scale outdoor productions are
often staged in the America Gardens Theatre, a 1,800-seat outdoor venue
across from the main pavilion building.
Ending your day at Epcot
Epcot’s end-of-day celebration, IllumiNations, is a moving blend of fire-
works, lasers, and fountains in a display that’s signature Disney. The
show is worth the crowds that flock to the parking lot when it’s over.
You can find tons of good viewing points around the lagoon (one excellent
spot is the terrace at the Rose & Crown Pub in the United Kingdom — see
Chapter 10 for more on the pub). That said, it’s best to stake your claim at
least a half-hour or so before show time, which is listed in your entertain-
ment schedule.

D
isney touts Disney–MGM Studios as “the Hollywood that never
was and always will be.” Its movie- and TV-themed shows and
props set the stage, so to speak, but this little park is also home to two
of the biggest thrill rides in Orlando — The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror
and Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith. Its neighborhoods include
Hollywood and Sunset boulevards, where Art Deco movie sets evoke the
Golden Age of Hollywood. Streets of America is lined with miniature ren-
ditions of the cityscapes of New York City and San Francisco, including
re-creations of actual city streets and buildings. You can find some of the
best street performing in the Disney parks here. More importantly, it’s a
working movie and TV studio where shows are occasionally produced.
The new Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show lets you experience
the thrills of a high-speed chase and other dramatic movie stunts as well
as gives you insight into how such effects are created, designed, and
filmed for the movies. 
Unlike the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, you can pretty much see Disney–
MGM’s 154 acres of attractions relatively easily in a single day; that is if
you arrive reasonably early and keep up a brisk pace. If you don’t get a
Disney–MGM Studios Guidemap and entertainment schedule as you enter
the park, be sure to grab one at Guest Relations.
Check show times as soon as you arrive and work out an entertainment
schedule that works for you. Likewise, take a second to plan ahead for
mealtimes and make your Advanced Dining Reservations immediately if
you haven’t already; many of the park’s rather unique restaurants fill up
quickly.

Acquainting Yourself with 
Disney–MGM Studios
Before I head off for a closer look at the park’s rides and attractions, I
must first deal with some mundane matters that you may very well
appreciate once you’re there:
Buying tickets and making reservations
Admission prices to Disney–MGM are $60 for a one-day adult ticket, $48
for children ages 3 to 9. See Chapter 11 for other ticket options.
Tickets aren’t the only thing you spend your hard-earned money on. The
prices of consumables are pretty much standard among Disney parks.
Disney–MGM Studios nails you to the tune of $2 or more for a soda or
milk, $1.25 to $2.50 for bottled water, $2.40 for an ice-cream bar, and
$1.70 to $1.90 for a cup of coffee.
If you have not done so in advance by calling % 407-939-3463 (the 
preferred course of action), make Advanced Dining Reservation
arrangements the minute you enter the park if you care to eat a sit-
down meal at one of the park’s unique dining venues. See Chapter 10
for details on Disney–MGM’s best restaurants.
Park hours are generally from 9 a.m. to 6 or 7 p.m., with extended
hours — sometimes as late as 10 p.m. — during holidays and summer.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATMs accept cards from banks using Cirrus, STAR, and Plus and are
located to the right of the main entrance and next to Toy Story
Pizza Planet, across from Jim Henson’s Muppet*Vision 3-D.
 The Baby Care Center is to the left of the main entrance and
includes places for nursing and changing. You can buy disposable
diapers, formula, baby food, and pacifiers. Changing tables also are
in all women’s restrooms and some men’s rooms.
 You can find disposable cameras and film throughout the park,
although digital camera supplies are extremely limited.
 The First Aid Center, staffed by registered nurses, is in the
Entrance Plaza adjoining Guest Relations.
 Lockers are located near Oscar’s Classic Car Souvenirs, to the right
of the entrance. They cost $7 a day, plus a $2 refundable deposit.

Pitting Disney–MGM Studios Against
Universal Studios Florida
If you love the movies, Broadway-style productions, or the Golden Age
of Hollywood, you’ll enjoy wandering the streets, shops, and sets of
Disney–MGM Studios. Universal Studios Florida (see Chapter 18) caters
more to visitors with children thanks to Nickelodeon Studios, Fievel’s
Playland, and Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone. But is this town big enough
for two studios? Both offer unique experiences and a flair all their own,
so if you can swing it, it’s well worth your time to experience both. I gen-
uinely feel for the visitor who has time to visit only one of these stellar
parks.
Both have a variety of good shows and, alas, unavoidably long lines.
Universal has an edge in the number and diversity of rides, but MGM’s
Tower of Terror is, arguably, the best thrill ride in either park (even with
the addition of Universal’s Revenge of the Mummy) and Rock ’n’ Roller
Coaster Starring Aerosmith is nothing to sneeze at either. Universal is
larger, which means you wear out more shoe leather, but it isn’t as 
congested.
My overall evaluation is that MGM Studios has some great shows and
rides, mainly the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!, The Twilight Zone
Tower of Terror, Star Tours — the ultimate Star Wars thrill ride, Jim Henson’s
Muppet*Vision 3-D, and the Disney–MGM Studios Backlot Tour, but I give
Universal a microscopic edge.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
216

The following sections divide attractions in Disney–MGM Studios into
two categories. Rides and shows rated G will assuredly entertain the
youngest visitors and, in many cases, the older ones as well. PG-rated
rides are those geared toward adults and teens (and may bore or
frighten children). For a look at the park, turn to the “Disney–MGM
Studios” map on page 215.
Entertaining the Whole Family: 
G-Rated Attractions and Rides
Rides and attractions listed in this category are suitable for everyone,
although a few in particular may not appeal to teens or adults.
Beauty and the Beast — Live on Stage
A 1,500-seat, covered amphitheater provides the stage for this 30-
minute, live production of Beauty and the Beast, adapted from the movie
version. Musical highlights include the rousing “Be Our Guest” opening
number and the poignant title song featured in a romantic waltz-scene
finale. Sets and costumes are lavish, and the production numbers are
spectacular. Arrive early to get a good seat. The park usually hosts four
or five shows a day.
“Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” Movie Set Adventure
In this 11,000-square-foot playground, everything is larger than life. A
thicket of grass is 30 feet tall, mushroom caps are three stories high, and
a friendly ant makes a suitable seat. Play areas include a massive cream
cookie, a 52-foot garden hose with leaks, cereal loops 9 feet wide and
cushioned for jumping, and a waterfall cascading from a leaf to a dell of
fern sprouts. (The sprouts form a musical stairway, activated when you
step from sprout to sprout.) There’s also a root maze with a flower-petal
slide, a filmstrip slide in a giant film canister, and a huge spider web with
11 levels. This attraction is a great place for children ages 2 to 8 to work
off their excess energy, while you regain some of your sanity.
Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!
Spectacular barely begins to describe this 35-minute rock ’em, sock ’em
extravaganza guaran-double-teed to keep you entertained and on the
edge of your seat. The show is held in a big, open-air stadium and
recruits a handful of adult volunteers to help out. It begins with Indy rap-
pelling down from the rafters, and the amazing special effects soon have
him dodging spikes, falling into a pit of molten something-or-other, sur-
viving two ax-wielding gargoyles, grabbing a priceless amulet, and then
outrunning fire, steam, and a tremendous boulder that nearly flattens
him. The actors, special effects folks, and director use the breaks to
explain what you just saw or are about to see, including stunt secrets. In
later scenes, Indy battles the evil Nazis in a Cairo marketplace and at an
Chapter 14: Disney–MGM Studios 217

airport-munitions dump. Shots are fired and flames are bursting all
around the set. For some stunts, adult victims . . . err . . . volunteers are
chosen from the audience.
The closer to the front of the theater you are, the more likely you are
to feel the extreme heat from the explosions, so if you have young kids
along you may want to sit a few rows back.
“It looked just like the movie — how cool is that!” It’s definitely an adren-
aline booster, though loud noises may make this show a little too intense
for kids under 5. There usually are five or six shows a day.
Jim Henson’s Muppet*Vision 3-D
This must-see production stars Kermit and Miss Piggy in a delightful 
marriage of Jim Henson’s puppets and Disney audio-animatronics, special-
effects wizardry, 70mm film, and cutting-edge 3-D technology. The action
takes place in a pretty darn accurate reproduction of the theater most of
you grew up watching on TV. In the show, you encounter flying Muppets,
cream pies, cannonballs, high winds, fiber-optic fireworks, bubble show-
ers, and even an actual spray of water. Kermit is host, Miss Piggy sings
“Dream a Little Dream of Me,” Statler and Waldorf heckle the action from
the balcony, and Nicki Napoleon and his Emperor Penguins (a full Muppet
orchestra) provide music from the pit. Kids of all ages will enjoy this
whimsical attraction and adults will be just as delighted. The 25-minute
show (including a 12-minute video pre-show) runs continuously. 
Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show
Inspired by the popular Stunt Show Spectacular at Disneyland Paris,
this high-octane stunt show takes places on the set of a spy thriller in
progress, with a quaint Mediterranean village as the backdrop. The show
features specially designed stunt cars, motorcycles, and jet skis, plus
some rather amazing special effects and even more spectacular driving —
with an audience member pulled in for a bit of the fun. Much like the
Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!, insiders reveal industry secrets,
detailing how stunts are created, designed, and filmed for the movies.
Filmed images are shown on an oversized screen, illustrating how the use
of different camera angles can add drama to filmed scenes. 
Seating is in a large outdoor stadium with a degree of cover from the
sun, but a late-afternoon show may be the best way to avoid the direct
rays and heat. The only bad seats in the house are the few rows in the
center just above an entry to the set used by some of the vehicles.
The Magic of Disney Animation
The new Drawn to Animation tour opens with a live artist interacting
with Mushu from Disney’s Mulan and a cute video on the making of that
film. Alas, Disney’s real-life Florida animators were all laid off in 2004, so
the inspection of their former working quarters strikes a somewhat sour
chord. The tour ends on an up note, however, as visitors attempt their
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
218

own Disney character drawings under the supervision of a working ani-
mator. Just before exiting, be sure to have the kids head to an animation
station. The short computerized program photographs your children’s
faces and asks a few questions to determine which Disney character
they are most like. 
Playhouse Disney — Live on Stage!
Younger audiences (2–8 years old) love this 20-minute show, where
they meet characters from Bear in the Big Blue House, The Book of Pooh,
Jo Jo’s Circus, and other favorite Disney stories. The show encourages
preschoolers to dance, sing, and play along with the cast. It happens
several times daily. Check your show schedule.
Sounds Dangerous — Starring Drew Carey
Drew Carey (on film) provides laughs while dual-audio technology pro-
vides some incredible hair-raising effects during a 12-minute mixture of
movie and live action at ABC Sound Studios. You feel like you’re right in
the middle of the action of a TV pilot featuring undercover police work
and plenty of amusing mishaps. Even when the picture disappears, you
continue the chase via headphones that demonstrate “3-D” sound effects
such as a roomful of angry bees, a herd of galloping elephants, and a
deafening auto race.
Most of the show takes place in total darkness, and the sound and sen-
sory effects may be frightening to younger ears, so think twice before
bringing younger children.
Voyage of The Little Mermaid
Hazy lighting helps paint a picture of an underwater world in a 17-minute
show that combines live performances, movie clips, puppetry, and spe-
cial effects. Sebastian sings “Under the Sea,” Ariel performs “Part of Your
World,” and the evil Ursula, 12 feet tall and 10 feet wide, belts out “Poor
Unfortunate Soul.” The Voyage has some scary scenes, but most little
kids don’t mind because, just like the movie, they know the show has a
happy ending. You get spritzed with water during the show, making this
an especially good experience during hot days.
Exploring PG-Rated Attractions and Rides
Rides and attractions in this category appeal to older children and
adults. In some cases, they have age, height, or health restrictions —
most of them well deserved. 
The American Film Institute Showcase
More of a shop than anything, the showcase includes an exhibit area
where you can waltz through Hollywood history, learning about the folks
Chapter 14: Disney–MGM Studios 219

behind the movies — editors, cinematographers, producers, and direc-
tors whose names roll by in the blur of credits. It also spotlights some of
the institute’s lifetime-achievement winners, including Bette Davis, Jack
Nicholson, and Elizabeth Taylor. A special exhibit here, Villains: Movie
Characters You Love to Hate, features the costumes and props of several
notable bad guys, including Darth Vader.
Disney–MGM Studios Backlot Tour
This fun, 35-minute special-effects show starts on foot and finishes in a
tram. You get a behind-the-scenes look at the vehicles, props, costumes,
sets, and special effects used in some of your favorite movies and TV
shows. On most days, you see costume makers at work in the wardrobe
department (the largest of its kind, with around 2 million garments). But
the real fun begins when the tram heads for Catastrophe Canyon, where
an earthquake in the heart of oil country causes canyon walls to rumble.
A raging oil fire, massive explosions, torrents of rain, and flash floods
threaten you and other riders before you’re taken behind the scenes to
see how filmmakers use special effects to make such disasters. 
Groans at the thought of enduring a tour of the backlot gave way to
screams after Austin, Ryan, and Nicolas experienced Catastrophe Canyon,
where the “earthquake” shook the tram and a very large, very wet wave
threw 70,000 gallons of water our way. All in all, this ride is very similar
in type to Earthquake — The Big One at Universal Studios Florida (see
Chapter 18). Sit on the left side of the tram if you want to get wet.
The Great Movie Ride
Set inside a replica of Los Angeles’s famous Grauman’s Chinese Theatre,
this 22-minute journey down MGM’s memory lane starts in the 1930s and
moves forward from there, using lifelike audio-animatronic versions of
famous actors to re-create some memorable movie moments. The line/
waiting area features film clips from various classic films, and several
cinematic artifacts to gawk at, including a set of Dorothy’s ruby slippers
from the Wizard of Oz. Then, you’re off to watch Bogey say goodbye to
Bergman, Tarzan (the Johnny Weismuller version) swing through the
jungle, James Cagney act tough, and Gene Kelly dance — and sing — in
the rain. A live outlaw enhances the action when he kidnaps you and
your mates, but — revenge is so sweet, isn’t it? — he goes the wrong
way, hopping onto a set that has an uncanny resemblance to one in
Raiders of the Lost Ark. After a narrow escape from the space thing from
Alien, your bank-robbing buddy gets incinerated when he tries to steal
the sphinx’s jewel. You survive to follow the yellow brick road to Oz,
where a remarkable likeness of the witch warns, “I’ll get you my pretty,
ahahahaha!” 
Even though this ride was recently refurbished, the older kids expressed
zero interest in it, so we split up. They headed for the heart-pounding
thrills down on Hollywood Boulevard while my two youngest (ages 3
and 5) and I enjoyed the slow moving trip (with a brief moment or two of
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
220

excitement thrown in for good measure) through Tinseltown. Movie
buffs and nostalgic adults will love it. 
Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith
It takes a lot to really wow anyone anymore but this ride is sure to do
the trick. This inverted roller coaster is one of the best thrill rides that
WDW has to offer, definitely not a ride for younger kids or anyone with
neck or back problems, faint hearts, a tendency toward motion sickness,
or fear of the dark. 
Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster is a fast-and-furious indoor ride that puts you
in a 24-passenger stretch limo, outfitted with 120 speakers that blare
Aerosmith at 32,000 watts! A flashing light warns you to “prepare to
merge as you’ve never merged before,” and faster than you can scream
“Stop the music!” (around 2.8 seconds, actually), you shoot from 0 to
60 mph and into the first gut-tightening inversion at 5Gs. The ride’s
beginning is a real test of your courage as you blast into a wild journey
through a make-believe California freeway system. One inversion cuts
through an “O” in the Hollywood sign, but you won’t feel that you’re
going to be thrown out because the ride’s too fast and too smooth for
that. It’s so fast, the Disney hype says, that it’s similar to sitting atop an
F-14 Tomcat. The ride lasts 3 minutes and 12 seconds, the running time
of Aerosmith’s hit, “Sweet Emotion,” which is one of the tunes played in
the limos. Similar to Space Mountain, the entire ride takes place indoors
and in the dark, but this one packs far more of a punch. Riders must be
at least 48 inches tall.
Plus-size guests with larger chests may not be able to pull the shoulder
harness fully closed and, therefore, may not be able to ride this. 
“Lets do it again!” 8-year-old Nicolas screamed while playing air guitar.
Austin (age 10) screamed back in agreement. I wasn’t sure if they were
screaming from the excitement or as a result of the loud music being
pumped from the speaker behind their heads on the ride. People with
sensitive ears should probably bring earplugs for this ride. 
Star Tours — the ultimate Star Wars thrill ride
Star Tours, like the slightly lesser Body Wars at Epcot (see Chapter 13), is
a virtual ride where you go nowhere, but you feel like you do. Your jour-
ney to a place far, far away begins with a pre-ride warning about high
turbulence, sharp drops, and sudden turns, and a winding walk (a line)
through the woodlands, where you see an Ewok village in the trees over-
head and a humungous Imperial Walker standing guard near the entry.
The pre-ride, which is expected to be updated eventually with charac-
ters from the prequels, now has R2-D2 and C-3PO running a galactic
travel agency of sorts. After boarding your StarSpeeder, the ride itself
starts kind of slow, but it finishes fast as you soar through space as
the good-guy fighter, with R2-D2 and C-3PO helping you make passes
through the canals of a Death Star. The special effects include hitting
Chapter 14: Disney–MGM Studios 221

hyperspace speed (you feel like you’re going up against a very small 
G-force) and falling. All things considered, though, this ride isn’t quite
up to modern rides here and at Orlando’s other theme parks, including
Back to the Future at USF (see Chapter 18), but it’s still highly enjoyable.
Sit in the last row to feel the motion best. If you feel a twinge of motion
sickness there are plenty of stationary objects you can look at to get
your bearings. 
“That was so awesome!” Austin, a Star Wars fan, was definitely impressed.
It’s not nearly as threatening or active as the Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster
Starring Aerosmith, but Star Tours still carries a 40-inch height minimum.
The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror
A truly stomach-lifting (and dropping) ride, Disney continues to fine-tune
the Tower of Terror to make it even better. That includes a January 2003
upgrade that added random drop sequences, meaning you get a different
fright every time you ride. Its legend says that during a violent storm on
Halloween night 1939, lightning struck the Hollywood Tower Hotel, caus-
ing an entire wing and an elevator full of people to disappear. And you’re
about to meet them as you star in a special episode of The Twilight Zone
(cue that television show’s famously creepy music). En route to this for-
merly grand hotel, guests walk past overgrown landscaping and faded
signs that once pointed the way to stables and tennis courts; the vines
above the entrance trellis are dead, and the hotel is a crumbling ruin.
Eerie corridors lead to a dimly lit library, where you can hear a storm
raging outside. The detailing on this ride is some of the best around.
After various ghostly apparitions, blasts of chilling air, and creepy expe-
riences, your ride ends in a dramatic climax: a terrifying 13-story fall into
The Twilight Zone! From there it’s anyone’s guess as to what happens
next — not even the bellhops operating the elevator know what the ride
is going to do. At 199 feet, it’s the tallest WDW attraction, and it’s a cut
(or two or three) above its rival Dr. Doom’s Fearfall at Universal’s Islands
of Adventure (see Chapter 19). 
“Absolutely the best ride ever!” 10-year-old Austin couldn’t get enough,
but my 8- and 12-year-olds wouldn’t get near the ride. I have no way of
knowing whether it was from the screams coming from the building or
the semi-green faces on a family that came out as we were about to get
in line. They aren’t alone, though: One of the Disney Imagineers who
helped design the attraction is too afraid to ride his own creation. Note,
however, that there were plenty of other kids ready for more at the ride’s
end. This ride carries a 40-inch height minimum.
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire — Play It!
Forget about winning $1 million — it ain’t happening here — but contest-
ants can win points toward prizes ranging from collectible pins to a
leather jacket to a three-night cruise on a Disney cruise ship (see
Chapter 16 for more on Disney cruises). Based on Disney-owned ABC
TV’s game show, the theme-park version features the same dramatic
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
222

music and lighting that made the TV version so famous. Lifelines (such
as asking the audience or calling a stranger on two phones set up in the
park) are available for contestants who need a little help answering up
to 15 multiple-choice questions in the climb to the top. It’s great fun to
play along, but you soon realize it isn’t as easy as it looks when you’re
under the gun (the audience is timed as well). Games run continuously
in the 600-seat studio. 
Unlike the TV show, the entire audience competes to get in the hot seat
by answering questions on keypads; the fastest to answer qualifying
questions become the contestants.
Taking Time Out for Fantastic 
Parades and Fireworks
In addition to its assortment of rides, Disney–MGM also offers its own
daily parade and an exceptional evening fireworks display.
Fantasmic!
It’s hard not to be in awe of the choreography, laser lights, and fireworks
that are the core of this 25-minute extravaganza held once — sometimes
twice — a night, weather permitting. Shooting comets, great balls of fire,
and animated fountains, and projection animation are among the many
special effects that entrance the audience. The cast includes 50 perform-
ers, a gigantic dragon, a huge king cobra, and 1 million gallons of water.
The entire show represents Mickey’s dream, filled with fanciful songs and
fantastic visuals. The dream turns into a nightmare thanks to the mischie-
vous magic of some of Disney’s more infamous villains. Surprisingly,
much of the show is rather dark, with foreboding music and frightening
creatures, with Mickey taking on some evil villains. The magical mouse of
course triumphs, and the show ends on a festive note. Younger children
might be frightened. 
If you want to avoid a real traffic jam after the show, arrive up to 60 min-
utes early and sit on the right (the theater empties right to left) side of
the amphitheater. When there are two shows per night, especially during
peak periods, finding a seat at the later show is usually easier. 
At press time, Disney was offering preferred seating at the end-of-the-day
spectacular, Fantasmic!, along with a fixed-price dinner at one of
Disney–MGM’s sit-down restaurants. All you need to do is make
Advanced Dining Reservation arrangements (% 407-939-3463) and
request the Fantasmic! package for the Hollywood Brown Derby ($37
adults, $10 kids 3–11), Mama Melrose’s Ristorante Italiano ($29 adults,
$10 kids 3–11), or Hollywood & Vine ($23 adults, $11 kids 3–11). Note:
You must tell the reservation agent you want the Fantasmic! package.
You’ll get your line pass at the restaurant and instructions on getting to
the special entrance to the preferred-seating area of the show.

Be aware that the prices above are for a fixed-price meal and don’t include
sales tax, tip, or alcoholic beverages; ordering off the menu costs you
more. The prices also don’t include a reserved seat at Fantasmic!, only a
pass that gets you into the preferred seating area (you must arrive at least
30 minutes in advance — a much shorter wait than usual).
Disney’s Stars and Motor Cars Parade
This motorcade includes a fun, highly recognizable procession of Disney
characters and their chariots. The parade is popular enough that if you
decide to skip it, you can find far shorter lines at the park’s most popu-
lar rides and shows. (Check the parade schedule in your park map.)

 Exploring the attractions in Animal Kingdom
D
isney’s fourth major park combines exotic animals, elaborate land-
scapes, and a handful of rides and shows to create yet another
reason why many WDW resort-goers don’t venture outside this World.
The $800 million park opened in 1998; its most recent land, Asia, was fin-
ished in 1999. Speaking of Asia, it will be the home of Animal Kingdom’s
first and long-awaited thrill ride. Expected to debut in 2006, Expedition
Everest, will be a high-speed, coasterlike train ride through glaciers,
waterfalls, and canyons, climaxing with an encounter with a yeti. Even
with this addition, and although the park offers some unique experi-
ences, an expedition here requires only a half to three-quarters of a day,
leaving some visitors (and I’m among them!) to believe there isn’t enough
there to justify the $60 admission charge per adult or $48 per child (3–9).
But don’t go canceling that safari vacation just yet. Animal Kingdom is a
theme park after all — even if the exotic wildlife can move out of your
view. It’s filled with some amazing experiences and some of the most
remarkable landscaping and architectural recreations in all of Disney
(after Epcot’s World Showcase pavilions, that is). In this chapter, I give
you helpful information about Animal Kingdom and its marvels, as well
as basic info for visiting the park.
Finding Helpful Services in the Kingdom
Before trekking through the jungle of attractions at Animal Kingdom, you
need to know some basic information, key to your survival when on
safari about the park.
Buying tickets and making reservations

Animal Kingdom
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
226

Tickets aren’t the only things to cut down on your cash. You’ll pay the
Disney park standard of $2 and up for a soda, $1.25 to $2.50 for bottled
water, $2.60 for an ice-cream bar, and $1.80 for a cup of coffee. If you buy
a soda, note that the park doesn’t provide lids or straws with its fountain
drinks. They’re not trying to make it difficult for you to walk around with
your soda — these items are banned because, in the hands of litterbugs,
they can become deadly to the wildlife. Another no-no: chewing gum. 
You can make Advanced Dining Reservations (see Chapter 10 for details
on call-ahead dining) at Guest Relations just inside the entrance, though
it’s best to make them in advance by calling % 407-939-3463.
Hours at Animal Kingdom are from 8 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m., but they’re
sometimes extended to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (though it’s rare).
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 You can find ATMs in Animal Kingdom near Garden Gates Gifts to
the right of the park entrance. Cards from banks using the Cirrus,
STAR, and Plus systems are accepted.
 The Baby Care Center is located near Creature Comforts on the
west side of the Tree of Life. As in the other Disney parks, you can
also find changing tables in women’s restrooms and some men’s
rooms. You can also buy disposable diapers at Guest Relations.
 Disposable cameras and film are available throughout the park,
but digital supplies are limited.
 The First Aid Center, which is staffed by registered nurses, is
located near Creature Comforts near the Tree of Life.
 Lockers are located in Garden Gate Gifts to your right as you enter
the park. You can also find them to the left, near Rainforest Café.
Rent lockers for $7 a day, plus a $2 deposit.
 A lost children center is located near Creature Comforts near the
Tree of Life. This area also is the site of same-day lost and found.
Kids age 7 and younger should wear name-tags.
 Shop clerks can send your packages (at no charge) to the front
of the park at Garden Gate Gifts. Allow three hours for delivery.
If you’re staying at a Disney resort, you can have your packages
shipped there, though it may take a day or two to get to your room.
 Pet care facilities are just outside the park entrance to the right.
You can board your pet for $6 a day (% 407-824-6568). The
Transportation and Ticket Center at the Magic Kingdom has
overnight boarding available for $11 ($9 for Disney resort guests).
Proof of vaccination is required.
Chapter 15: Animal Kingdom 227

 Rent strollers at the Garden Gate Gifts shop to the right as you
enter the park ($8 for a single, $15 for a double, including a $1
refundable deposit). Satellite locations are also throughout the
park. Ask a Disney employee to steer you in the right direction.
 Rent wheelchairs at the Garden Gate Gifts shop that’s on your right
as you enter the park. Rentals cost $10 for a standard wheelchair,
and $35 (plus a $5 deposit) for electric carts. Ask Disney employees
for other locations in the park.
You can call % 407-934-7639 or visit Disney’s Web site, www.disney
world.com, to find out more about WDW properties.
Deciding between Animal Kingdom 
and Busch Gardens
When Disney’s fourth theme park opened, it raised two questions: Is it a
first-rate park worthy of the same sticker shock as Orlando’s other major
parks, and when does the area have too many parks? 
Well, when it comes to visitor volume and diversity of things to do,
Animal Kingdom ranks as one of the top two animal parks in Florida.
Busch Gardens ($56 per adult, $46 per child entry) in Tampa is the
other. Although I discuss Busch Gardens in Chapter 23, I’m going to talk
about it briefly here so that I can draw a few comparisons.
Animal Kingdom is as much a park for animals, a conservation venue, as
it is an attraction. The short of it is that its creatures aren’t as easy to
see; they’re given much more cover than at Busch Gardens, so when
they want to avoid your probing eyes and the heat, they can. Even in
high-profile areas, such as Pangani Forest Exploration Trail, Disney goes
to great lengths to protect resident lowland gorillas, including a magnifi-
cent silverback, from prying eyes. The beautiful foliage used to create
that cover also means that Animal Kingdom is a lot prettier than its
Tampa rival.
Although I’m all for protecting wildlife, Animal Kingdom can do a much
better job of providing shade for the only species that doesn’t get much
consideration in the park — the homo sapiens who paid to get in. The
amount of cover given to tourists waiting in line is decidedly unimpres-
sive (a problem in all of Disney’s parks, in my opinion). Arriving early at
both parks, especially in summer, saves you the unpleasant experience
of languishing under a blistering sun. 
The best time to catch the animals out and about at Animal Kingdom
is in the early morning just after the park opens — usually 7 or 8 a.m.
(depending on the season) — or at closing as the day begins to cool.
Most animals are on the prowl at those times, not at midday (especially
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
228

during the summer). Busch’s animals are far easier to see, regardless of
the time of day, as they have fewer places to take cover.
Animal Kingdom wins the battle of shows with humdingers such as
Festival of the Lion King. Although the Animal Kingdom has three — soon
to be four — thrill rides (and I’m being kind in including two of them in
the thrill category), Busch Gardens pulls ahead with six roller coasters
including SheiKra, the incredible new dive coaster, and Gwazi, a set of
dueling wooden coasters.
Busch is the better all-around park. New additions aside, many criticize
Animal Kingdom — fairly, in my opinion — for not offering enough to jus-
tify a ticket price comparable to Busch Gardens and the other Orlando
theme parks. But geographically speaking, you may not have or want a
choice between the two. Animal Kingdom is located right in the center of
the Orlando action, where you can find a ton of other things to do. Alas,
Busch Gardens is at least a 75-minute drive or shuttle trip from O-Town,
and the Tampa Bay area simply doesn’t have the draw of Orlando,
though it does offer cultural centers, museums, aquariums, and sandy
beaches. If you’re considering a trip to the Tampa Bay area, I recom-
mend buying a copy of Florida For Dummies or Frommer’s Florida (both
published by Wiley); both books have a wealth of information about
attractions, accommodations, and restaurants on the state’s Suncoast.
Checking Out Animal Kingdom’s
Top Attractions
The overall conservation theme in this state-of-the-art park is simple but
not subtle. Everywhere you turn, you find an environmental message,
including the park’s signs and the narratives of the tour guides on rides
such as Kilimanjaro Safaris. It’s this underlying theme that connects the
park’s rather diverse sections, where you’ll encounter everything from a
dinosaur-themed thrill ride to a kid-friendly zone where Disney charac-
ters hang out. 
Animal Kingdom, like WDW’s Magic Kingdom, is set up on a hub-and-
spoke format with the Tree of Life (in Discovery Island) as its hub and
five other sections scattered around it. The following sections provide
you with a closer look at the six lands of Animal Kingdom. You can find
all the Kingdom’s attractions on the “Animal Kingdom” map on page 226.
The Oasis
The Oasis Exhibits is your introduction to Animal Kingdom, but a lot
of folks, itching to get to the action, launch their way through it, over-
looking the fact that this is one of the better places to see not-so-rare
animals early in the day. The lush vegetation, streams, grottoes, and
Chapter 15: Animal Kingdom 229

waterfalls on either side of the walkway are good places to spot walla-
bies, miniature deer, anteaters, sloths, iguanas, tree kangaroos, otters,
and macaws. But a misty fog and the landscaping also give them room
to escape your eyes whenever they choose. 
Discovery Island
After you pass through The Oasis, Discovery Island lies directly ahead,
with the park’s signature icon, the Tree of Life, in the center of it all.
Although you will find only three attractions, they are among the park’s
most unique features. 
Discovery Island Trails
The Discovery Island Trail is another of the park’s animal-viewing areas,
a leisurely path through the root system of the Tree of Life (Animal
Kingdom’s 145-foot man-made tree described in detail later in this sec-
tion) and a chance to see real, but not-so-rare, critters such as axis deer,
red kangaroos, otters, flamingos, lemurs, galapagos tortoises, ducks,
storks, and cockatoos.
The best viewing times are early or late in the day, though I’d save this
one for later and head to the park’s few thrill rides first.
It’s Tough to Be a Bug!
Take the walkway through the Tree of Life’s 50-foot base, grab a pair of 
3-D glasses, and settle into a sometimes creepy-crawly seat. Based on the
Disney-Pixar film, A Bug’s Life, the special effects in this multimedia adven-
ture are pretty impressive. Although it may not be a good choice for kids
younger than 4 (it’s dark and loud) or bug haters. The attraction offers a
fun and sometimes-poignant look at life from a smaller perspective. After
you put on your bug-eye glasses, all your senses are awakened by the
stars, including ants, beetles, spiders, and — oh, no! — a stink bug. 
I won’t say who, but more than one of my kids came out in tears, but for
reasons you may not expect. The simple sensory effects, mostly because
they occur unexpectedly and in the dark, terrorized even some of the
older ones. The issue my youngest had was with the bugs — he HATES
them.
On the other hand, Katie (a cousin), thought the show was “really
funny.” Viewers experience some spritzes of water, blasts of air, and a
foul smell when the stink bug gets its revenge. The show’s finale, when
the on-screen insects run amok, definitely leaves you buzzing.
The Tree of Life
Like Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12 for more
details) and Spaceship Earth in Epcot (described in Chapter 13), the 
14-story Tree of Life is a park icon. The man-made tree, and its carved
animals, are the work of Disney artists, teams of which worked for more
than a year on its carved, free-form animal sculptures. It isn’t as tall or
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
230

imposing as those other icons, but it is certainly impressive. It has
8,000 limbs, 103,000 leaves, and 325 mammals, reptiles, amphibians,
insects, birds, dinosaurs, and Mickeys carved into its trunk, limbs, and
roots. Different animals appear or vanish depending on the angle from
which you view the Tree. One of the creators says he expects it to
become one of the most photographed works of art in the world. 
Although passing up a detailed inspection of the tree as you enter the
park is hard to do (it is awesomely difficult to ignore), I recommend gawk-
ing only while standing in line for It’s Tough to Be a Bug! You’ll have time
for a more detailed look at the tree — if you so desire — on the way out.
Camp Minnie–Mickey
Youngsters love this place, though I don’t share their enthusiasm. It’s
a favorite hangout for Disney characters from the forest and jungle,
including Simba from Lion King and Baloo from The Jungle Book. Mickey,
Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, Donald, Daisy, and other stars also make appear-
ances from time to time around this woody retreat, which was designed
to resemble an Adirondack summer camp. The lines for the meet and
greets are often excruciatingly long, and unless the kids insist on visit-
ing, I recommend avoiding waiting to meet with Disney characters here. 
In addition to the characters, this land is also home to some of Disney
World’s best stage shows, including Festival of the Lion King, an exhila-
rating extravaganza.
Character Greeting Trails
If you’re traveling with children, this attraction is probably a must-do, but
be prepared for a long wait. A variety of Disney characters from Timon
and Winnie the Pooh to Pluto and Donald Duck shake your hand, give
hugs, allow photos to be taken, and sign autographs. Mickey and Minnie,
in recognition of their star status, get their own shaded pavilions.
Festival of the Lion King
This Broadway-style production at the Lion King Theater is the best in
Animal Kingdom and one of the top three productions in all of Walt Disney
World. The extravaganza celebrates nature’s diversity with a talented, col-
orfully attired cast of singers, dancers, and life-size critters who lead you
to an inspiring sing-along. Based loosely on the animated movie, this stage
show combines the pageantry of a parade with a tribal celebration. The
action takes place on the center stage and even around the audience.
Even though the pavilion has 1,000 seats, arrive at least 20 minutes early
to ensure you get a spot. The show lasts just under a half-hour. 
Pocahontas and Her Forest Friends
The wait to see Pocahontas and Her Forest Friends can be nightmarish,
and the 15-minute show isn’t remotely close to the caliber of Festival of
the Lion King. In this presentation, Pocahontas and Grandmother Willow,
Chapter 15: Animal Kingdom 231

with the help of some of the forest creatures (a raccoon, turkey, porcu-
pine, rat, and more), bring to light the importance of treating nature with
respect and protecting our forests. Young fans of the movie and of little
creatures will be most appreciative of the performance. If you must go,
go early. The theater has a mere 350 seats, but standing-room crowds
are admitted.
Africa
Enter through the town of Harambe, which means “coming together” in
Swahili. This area of Africa is a re-creation of an African coastal village
poised on the edge of the 21st century. The impressive whitewashed
structures, built of coral stone and thatched with reed brought from
Africa, surround a beautifully landscaped central marketplace that’s rich
with local wares and colors. After passing through the town, the various
trails lead you to Africa’s other rides and attractions.
Kilimanjaro Safaris
This attraction is one of the few rides and the best animal-viewing venue
in the kingdom. But remember: The animals are scarce during the middle
of the day, especially in the heat of summer.
You can wait 45 minutes or more in line at this attraction. Yes, using 
FASTPASS (see Chapter 11) is an option, but it virtually eliminates the
chance of riding during the best viewing times. My advice: Skip FASTPASS,
get to the park a bit before its scheduled time to open, and make your way
straight here. If you simply aren’t a morning person, your next best shot is
to get a FASTPASS that lets you ride as close to the park’s closing as you
can get (so know ahead of time you will have to check back every so often
to get a pass that doesn’t have you returning mid-day!).
After you reach the end of the very long and winding line, you’ll board a
rather large truck specially made for such an expedition, and set off on a
bouncy ride through the African landscape. Animals in the Safari include
black rhinos, hippos, antelopes, Nile crocodiles, zebras, wildebeests,
and lions that, if your timing is right, may offer a half-hearted roar
toward some gazelles that are safely out of reach. The animals roam
freely, occasionally crossing the path of the truck allowing a really up-
close view, but again, it’s far more likely to occur in the morning or
evening hours. Predictably, the theme is conservation. There’s even a
little drama — this, after all, is a theme park ride — as you and your
mates will help pursue some park poachers.
“The bumpy ride was fun and way better than having to walk around to
see the animals. Looking over railings isn’t nearly as fun.” I agree with
Nicolas — several giraffe came practically within arms length on this
ride. This one’s fun for the whole family, although very small infants
shouldn’t ride because of the bumps.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
232

Pangani Forest Exploration Trail
You can get a good look at hippos, mole rats, and African birds on the
Pangani Falls Exploration Trail, but lowland gorillas are the main feature.
The trail has two gorilla-related areas: One is home to a family com-
prised of a 500-pound silverback, his ladies, and kids; the other has five
bachelors. Most people tend to rush through the trails, missing out on
the chance to see the giant apes, and the animals are not always cooper-
ative, especially in hot weather when they tend to spend most of the day
in shady areas out of view. But visitors who have good timing or who
make return visits are truly rewarded with up-close views (through
Plexiglas) of these magnificent creatures. A new Endangered Animal
Rehabilitation Centre that includes Colobus and Mona monkeys is one of
the latest additions to the trail.
Rafiki’s Planet Watch
This area of Africa includes Conservation Station, which offers a behind-
the-scenes look at how Disney cares for animals inside the park, as you
walk past a series of nurseries and veterinary stations. The problem is
that these facilities need staff members present to make them interest-
ing, and that isn’t always the case. Affection Section gives you a chance
to cuddle some friendly animals (including goats and potbellied pigs),
while Habitat Habit! has a trail that’s home to some smaller animals, such
as cotton-topped tamarins. Note: Take heed of the signs in the Affection
Section that instruct you to put all paper, including maps, away. Goats
love paper and will cause a stampede in an attempt to snatch your
paper products from you. 
Asia
Disney’s Imagineers outdid themselves in creating the mythical kingdom
of Anandapur (place of delight) in the Asia section of the Kingdom, with
an exotic atmosphere enhanced by the crumbling ruins of an ancient 
village, its temples, and even a maharajah’s palace, all decorated with
intricate carvings and artwork. 
Expedition Everest
Animal Kingdom’s newest thrill ride is scheduled to make its debut in
2006. Guests will board an old mountain railway bound for Mount
Everest which, at 200 feet, will be one of Florida’s highest peaks. Passing
through bamboo forests, thundering waterfalls, and glacier fields, the
train ascends higher and higher to the snow-capped peaks of the moun-
tain. As you might expect, what starts out as a relaxing tour turns into
an exciting expedition as the train hits tracks that are mangled and
twisted. The train races frantically through the icy canyons and caverns
as you suddenly find yourself face-to-face with the Yeti (also known as
the abominable snowman). FASTPASS will be a necessity when the expe-
dition opens. There will be height and health restrictions, although no
information was available at the time this book went to press. 
Chapter 15: Animal Kingdom 233

Flights of Wonder
This live-animal action show is a low-key break from the madness and
offers a few laughs, including Groucho the African yellow-nape, who
entertains the audience with his op-parrot-ic a cappella solos, and the
just-above-your-head soaring of a Harris hawk and a Eurasian eagle owl.
Other feathered stars include an American bald eagle and a crowned
crane.
Kali River Rapids
Whitewater fanatics may scoff, but for a theme-park raft ride, the Kali
River Rapids ride is pretty good — slightly better than Congo River
Rapids at Busch Gardens (see Chapter 23), but not as good as Popeye
& Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges at Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19);
though the theme is more alluring here. This ride’s churning water
mimics realistic rapids and its optical illusions make you wonder
whether you’re about to go over the falls. The ride begins with a peace-
ful tour of lush foliage, but soon you’re dipping and dripping as your tiny
raft tosses and turns through the jungles. You will get wet (or, more pre-
cisely, soaked). The lines are long, but keep your head up, and enjoy
some of the marvelous art overhead and on the beautiful murals. This
ride has a 38-inch height minimum.
Maharajah Jungle Trek
Disney keeps its promise to provide up-close views of animals with this
exhibit, whose setting is almost an attraction in its own right. Lush tropi-
cal foliage and bamboo grow amidst the ruins, architecture, and carvings
of Nepal, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. It’s some of Disney’s best thematic
work.
If you don’t show up in the midday heat, you’ll probably see Bengal
tigers roaming an abandoned maharajah’s palace through a thick glass
barrier. Nothing but air separates you from dozens of giant fruit bats
hanging in what appears to be a courtyard. Some of the bats have
wingspans of six feet. (If you have a phobia, you can bypass this, but
know that the bats are harmless.) Guides are on hand to answer ques-
tions, and you also get a brochure that lists the animals you may spot.
You also have chances to see Komodo dragons, tapirs, playful gibbons,
and acrobatic siamangs, whose calls have been likened to someone in
the throes of pain or passion. 
DinoLand U.S.A.
Located to the right, or east side, of Discovery Island as you enter,
DinoLand U.S.A. is Disney’s attempt to capitalize on the dinosaur craze
inspired by Jurassic Park and (ugh) Barney. You enter beneath Olden
Gate Bridge, a 40-foot-tall brachiosaurus reassembled from excavated
fossils. Speaking of which, until late summer 1999, DinoLand had three
paleontologists working on the very real skeleton of Sue, a monstrously
big tyrannosaurus rex unearthed in the Black Hills of South Dakota in
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
234

1990. The paleontologists patched and assembled the bones here, mainly
because Disney helped pay for the project. Alas, Sue has moved to her
permanent home at The Field Museum in Chicago, but a cast replica of
her 67-million-year-old bones, called Dino-Sue on the handout guide
maps, is on display.
The Boneyard
The Boneyard is a great place for parents to catch a second wind.
Kids absolutely love the prehistoric playground, and there are plenty of
activities to wear them down a bit. They can slide and climb over a pale-
ontological dig site and squeeze through the fossils and skeletons of a
triceratops and a brontosaurus. They can even search the sands for
skeletal remains.
You have to be vigilant about keeping track of your kids here. The Bone
Yard is a large area, and although Disney staff monitors them at both
ends, kids play in a multilevel arena where tube slides can take them
from one level to the next in a heartbeat.
DINOSAUR
This ride hurls you through darkness in a CTX Rover time machine, past
an array of snarling audio-animatronic dinosaurs. Some kids may find
the dinosaurs (and darkness) frightening; adults might find them a bit
hokey. However, after Expedition Everest, DINOSAUR is as close as
Animal Kingdom comes to a thrill ride — a twisting-turning, and very
jerky, adventure in which you and 20 other passengers try to save the
last Iguanadon on Earth from an asteroid. Evolution, nature’s fragility,
and potential catastrophe are the punch lines in this lip-biting, armrest-
clenching ride against time. It features some very large lizards (such as
a 33-foot carnotaurus, named for its favorite food — meat). 
Plus-size riders may find the seats uncomfortably narrow, especially
with the jerky motions of the ride. 
“You felt like you were really being thrown around,” Ryan announced
after he got off. Austin called it “Awesome!” but added that it wasn’t as
scary as he thought it would be. Riders must be at least 40 inches tall.
DINOSAUR also has a list of warnings aimed at folks with neck and back
ailments. If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like aboard a bucking
bronco, this rough ride is probably pretty comparable.
Primeval Whirl
Sometimes criticized for being too passive, Animal Kingdom jumped into
the coaster craze with Primeval Whirl. Primeval Whirl is a bit tame, and
it doesn’t have inversions, but it does have plenty of spinning action in
carnival-style, rider-controlled cars that whirl by asteroids and hokey
dinosaurs that pop up along the track. The ride has tight loops, short
dips, and a final spin that sends you into the gaping jaws of a fossilized
dinosaur.

TriceraTop Spin
The principle behind this kiddie favorite is pretty much the same as
The Magic Carpets of Aladdin and Dumbo The Flying Elephant at WDW’s
Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12). Cartoonish dinosaurs take riders up,
down, and all around. To the delight of the kids, a dinosaur occasionally
pops his head in and out of the central hub. Most young children, espe-
cially those ages 2 to 6, love it. Parents loathe the long lines.

I
n Chapters 12 through 15, I acquaint you with the major parks of Walt
Disney World. But the House of Mouse is home to much, much more.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the smaller, second-tier attractions, as
well as a few holiday happenings and the Disney Cruise Line.
Playing It Up at DisneyQuest
The minute you step inside you realize this is no ordinary arcade —
throughout the five levels are some of the most unique and cutting edge
games ever created. Disney has taken the state of the art technology of vir-
tual reality, added a spirit of adventure, and has shaken it all up with some
of that magical pixie dust for good measure. The result is the World’s most
interactive game complex. From kids just old enough to work the controls
to teens, reactions to DisneyQuest are pretty much the same: “Awesome!”
And although many adults enter the arcade thinking that they’re only
going to find kids’ stuff, many bite the hook as hard as their offspring
when they get a gander at the electronic wizardry — everything from old-
fashioned pinball with a newfangled twist to virtual-reality adventure rides.
Here are just some of the entrees that you can find at DisneyQuest:
 Aladdin’s Magic Carpet Ride: straddling the magic carpet you’ll fly
through the 3-D Cave of Wonders, the alleys and streets of Agrabah,
in search of the magic lamp. This is definitely fun, but your head
may get hot from the virtual-reality helmets.

 Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold outfits you
and up to three mates in 3-D helmets so you can battle pirate ships
virtual-reality style. One of you volunteers to be the captain, steering
the ship, while the others assume positions behind cannons to blast
the black hearts into oblivion — maybe. Each time you do, you’re
rewarded with some doubloons, but beware of sea monsters that
can gobble up you and your treasure. In the game’s final moments,
you come face to face with the ghost of Davey Jones. It’s great fun
for all ages.
 The Mighty Ducks Pinball Slam is an interactive, life-size game in
which the players ride platforms and use body English to try to
score points. It’s your opportunity to explore life as a pinball —
from the ball’s perspective. Just try to stop the quivering in your
arms after this.
 If you have an inventive mind (and a steel stomach), stop in at
Cyberspace Mountain, where Bill Nye the Science-Turned-Roller-
Coaster Guy helps you create the ultimate loop-and-dipster, which
you then can ride in a very real-feeling simulator. It’s a major hit
with the coaster-crazy crowd. (I know some adrenaline junkies who
spent hours here constructing, then riding, one heart-stopper after
another.) Bring your own motion-sickness medicine (though you
can choose slow, medium, or quick death).
 If you need some quiet time, sign up at Animation Academy for a
mini course in Disney cartooning. The academy also has snack and
food areas; a typical theme park–style meal and drink runs from
$12 to $15 per person.
Crowds really start building after lunch when the heat of the day begins
to truly kick in, and they’re simply maddening after dark.
While there are some rides and games appropriate for a variety of ages,
Disney Quest is by far most appealing to those over 8 or even 10 (some
attractions also have height requirements so be sure to check ahead of
time to avoid disappointments). If you have toddlers in tow, be aware
that strollers are not allowed in the building.
See map p. 168. In Downtown Disney West Side (off Buena Vista Drive). %407-828-4600.
www.disneyquest.com. Admission: $34 adults, $28 kids 3–9 for unlimited play.
Open: Sun–Thurs 11:30 a.m.–11 p.m., Fri–Sat 11:30 a.m. to midnight. 
Fielding the Fun at Disney’s 
Wide World of Sports
Disney’s Wide World of Sports is a 200-acre, megacomplex that has a
7,500-seat baseball stadium, 10 other baseball and softball fields, 6 bas-
ketball courts, 12 lighted tennis courts, a track-and-field complex, a golf
driving range, and 6 sand volleyball courts.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
238

If you’re a true sports fan, call for a package of information about the
facilities and a calendar of events (see the listing data below). You can
also consult the facility’s Web site for up-to-date information. 
Here’s a sampling of the options at Disney’s Wide World of Sports:
 The Atlanta Braves play 16 spring training games in the stadium
during a one-month season that begins in early March. Tickets for
the stadium’s two seating areas cost $12 to $21. For tickets call
Ticketmaster (% 407-839-3900). Note: In addition to the Braves,
the facility also hosts the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ spring-
training camp.
 The Multi-Sports Experience, which is included in Wide World’s
general admission price, is open on select days. It challenges
guests with activities covering many sports: football, baseball, 
basketball, hockey, soccer, and volleyball. 
 The NBA, NCAA, PGA, and Harlem Globetrotters also stage
events, sometimes annually and sometimes more frequently, 
at the complex.

Gearing Up at the Richard 
Petty Driving Experience
Compared to the Richard Petty Driving Experience at the Walt Disney
World Speedway, Epcot’s thriller Test Track is for sissies. This is your
chance to race like a pro in a 600-horsepower NASCAR race car. How real
is it?
You must sign a two-page waiver with words such as Dangerous, Calculated
Risk, and Update Your Will! before getting into a car. At one end of the
spectrum, you can ride shotgun for a couple of laps at 145 mph ($99).
At the other end, you can spend from three hours to two days learning
how to drive the car yourself and racing other daredevils in 8 to 30 laps
of excitement (for a cool $349 to $1,249, not including tax). You must be
18 or older to ride in the car.

Preparing for the PGA at Disney Golf
The Magic Mickey offers 99 holes of golf: five 18-hole, par-72 courses
and a 9-hole, par-36 walking course. All WDW courses are open to the
public and offer pro shops, equipment rentals, and instruction. For tee
times and information, call % 407-939-4653 up to 60 days in advance.
(Disney resort guests can reserve up to 90 days in advance.) Golf pack-
ages are also available (with select packages available only 7 days in
advance), and you can call % 407-934-7639 to make reservations.
Greens fees for Disney hotel guests can range from $69 to $159 per 
18-hole round (it’s $10 more if you’re not a resort guest), though rates
are subject to change at any time and do vary by season and by course.
Special pricing may also available for play after 10 a.m., after 3 p.m., and
after 5 p.m. Here’s a rundown of Disney’s courses:
 Palm Course (18 holes): By PGA standards, the Palm is Disney’s
toughest course. Set among natural Florida woodlands, the elevated
greens, water, and sand traps offer more hazards than Interstate 4.
Good luck with the 18th hole; it’s rated among the toughest holes
on the PGA Tour.
 Magnolia Course (18 holes): The longest course on Disney property
is designed in classic PGA style. Wide fairways are deceiving; you’ve
got to hunker down and whack the ball, but take care: Eleven holes
have water hazards, and 97 bunkers are on the course. The 6th hole
has a special hazard — a Mickey Mouse–shaped sand trap.
 Lake Buena Vista Course (18 holes): This course has a classic
country-club style, with many pines spread across a residential
area. Well-bunkered, it’s also a challenge that demands accuracy.
This course is one of a few that have played host to PGA, LPGA,
and USGA events.
 Eagle Pines Course (18 holes): Expansive traps and sloping fair-
ways follow the natural lay of the land. Rough pine straw and
sand replace grass on this course, and 16 holes feature water 
hazards.
 Osprey Ridge Course (18 holes): This Fazio-designed course 
combines rolling fairways cut through forests of scrub oak, pine,
palmetto, cypress, and bay trees. The Osprey course is ranked as
one of the best courses in Florida by Golf Digest.
 Oak Trail Course (9 holes): If you can’t go a day without getting in
a few holes, but don’t have time for the 18-hole courses, this course
is the place to spank the ball. This 9-hole walking course is designed
for families or for a quick golf fix.

Puttering Around at Disney Miniature Golf
Those too timid to tee off at Disney’s majors — or whose big games aren’t
yet up to par — can try their putters on the World’s miniature golf courses.
Thanks to four whimsically themed courses, everyone, from novices to
master minigolfers, should find at least one course to their liking.
Fantasia Gardens
Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf, located across from Disney–MGM
Studios, offers two 18-hole miniature courses drawing inspiration from
the Walt Disney classic cartoon of the same name. On the Fantasia
Gardens course, hippos, ostriches, and gators appear, and the Sorcerer’s
Apprentice presides over the final hole. This is a good course for begin-
ners and kids. Seasoned minigolfers will probably prefer the tougher
Fantasia Fairways, a scaled-down golf course complete with sand traps,
water hazards, tricky putting greens, and holes ranging from 40 to 
75 feet — as for the kids, only those who can actually golf may find
the Fairways any fun.

Winter Summerland
Santa Claus and his elves supply the theme at Winter Summerland, a
well-designed miniature-golf spread that has two 18-hole courses. The
Winter course takes you from an ice castle to a snowman to the North
Pole. The Summer course is pure Florida, from sand castles to surfboards
to a visit with Santa on the Winternet.

Making a Splash at Disney’s Water Parks
Disney’s two water parks are great places to chill out for all or part of a
day. Here are a few things to keep in mind before you head off for a swim:
 Go in the afternoons — about 2 p.m., even in summer — if you can
stand the heat that long and want to avoid crowds. The early birds
are usually gone by then, and lines are far shorter.
 Another way to enjoy the smallest crowds is to go early in the week
when most week-long guests are filling the lines at the theme parks.
 Kids can get lost just as easily at a water park, and the consequences
can be worse. All Disney parks have lifeguards, usually wearing bright
red suits, but, to be safe, ask how to identify an on-duty lifeguard,
and keep an eye on your little ones. Life jackets are available, at no
charge, for an added measure of safety but are limited in availabil-
ity and are in no way a substitute for adult supervision.
 If modesty is your policy, women should remember to bring a one-
piece bathing suit for the more daring slides. All bathers should
remember the wedgie factor on the more extreme rides, such as
Summit Plummet. You may enter the park wearing baggies, but,
thanks to high-speed water pressure, find yourself in a thong.
Blizzard Beach
The youngest of Disney’s water parks is also tops in the country in 
attendance. Blizzard Beach is a 66-acre “ski resort” set in the midst 
of a tropical lagoon beneath 90-foot, uh-oh, Mount Gushmore. The base
of Mount Gushmore has a sand beach and several other attractions,
including a wave pool and a smaller, kids’ version of the mountain.
Here are brief descriptions of other Blizzard Beach attractions:
 Cross Country Creek is a 2,900-foot tube ride around the park and
through a cave where you get splashed with melting ice.
 Runoff Rapids allows you and your tube to careen down your
choice of three twisting-and-turning runs, one of which plunges
you into darkness.
 Ski Patrol Training Camp is designed for preteens. It features a
rope swing, an airborne water drop from a T-bar, slides, such as
the wet and slippery Mogul Mania, and a challenging ice-flow walk
along slippery floating icebergs.
 Slush Gusher is a speed slide that shoots you along a snow-
banked gully. It packs a 48-inch minimum height requirement.
 Melt Away Bay is a one-acre, relatively calm wave pool.
 Snow Stormers has three flumes that descend from the top of Mount
Gushmore along a switchback course through ski-type slalom gates.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
242

 Summit Plummet is wild! Read every speed, motion, vertical-dip,
wedgie, and hold-onto-your-breastplate warning in this guide. Then
test your bravado in a bull ring, a space shuttle, or dozens of other
death-defying hobbies as a warm-up. This one starts out pretty slow,
with a lift ride (even in Florida’s 100° dog days) to the 120-foot
summit. Once you’re at the top, kiss any kids or religious medal you
may carry with you because, if you board, you will be on the world’s
fastest body slide. It’s a test of your courage and your swimsuit as
you’ll be headed virtually straight down and moving, sans vehicle,
at 60 mph by the time you reach the catch pool (the stop zone).
Even the hardiest of riders may find this slide hard to handle; 
a veteran thrill-seeker has described the experience as “15 seconds
of paralyzing fear.” Minimum height requirement is 48 inches.
 Teamboat Springs is the World’s longest white-water raft ride.
Your six-passenger raft twists down a 1,200-foot series of rushing
waterfalls.
 Tike’s Peak is a mini version of Blizzard Beach for mini visitors.
It offers short slides, a squirting ice pool, a fountain play area, and
a snow castle.
 Toboggan Racers is an eight-lane slide that sends you racing, head
first, over exhilarating dips into a “snowy” slope.
See map p. 168. On World Drive, north of the All-Star resorts and across from Winter
Summerland. % 407-560-3400. www.disneyworld.com. Admission: $34 adults,
$28 kids 3–9. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m., with extended hours during peak times, such
as summer. 
Typhoon Lagoon
Typhoon Lagoon is the ultimate in water theme parks. Its fantasy setting
is a palm-fringed tropical island village of ramshackle, tin-roofed island
shacks, the entire area strewn with cargo, surfboards, and other marine
wreckage left by the great typhoon. The storm-stranded fishing boat (the
Miss Tilly) dangles precariously atop the 95-foot Mount Mayday, the steep
setting for several rides. Every 30 minutes, Tilly’s stack blows shooting a
50-foot geyser even higher into the air.
Here are some other park highlights:
 Castaway Creek is a 2,100-foot lazy river that circles most of the
park. Hop onto a raft or an inner tube and meander through a misty
rain forest and then past caves and secluded grottoes. Water Works,
its theme area, is where jets of water spew from shipwrecked boats,
and a Rube Goldberg assemblage of broken bamboo pipes and
buckets soak you. Tubes are included in the admission.
 Crush ’n’ Gusher is the newest addition to the park. Coaster crazies
will appreciate its gravity defying drops between which powerful
jets of water propel riders back uphill, through twists and turns,
Chapter 16: Enjoying the Rest of Walt Disney World 243

only to drop them again. The Banana Blaster, Coconut Crusher, and
Pineapple Plunger offer a unique, out-of-control experience, each
sending riders careening on a different route through the remains
of a ramshackle fruit exporting plant. Roughly the same length
(410–420-ft. long) the three spillways feature varying degrees of
slopes and turns to keep you coming back for more.
 Humunga Kowabunga consists of three 214-foot Mount Mayday
slides that propel you down the mountain on a serpentine route
through waterfalls and bat caves and past nautical wreckage at up to
30 mph before depositing you into a bubbling catch pool; each slide
offers slightly different views and thrills. Seating also is available
for non-Kowabunga folks whose kids have commissioned them to
“watch me.” Women should wear a one-piece on the slides (unless
you don’t mind putting on a different sort of show for gawkers).
This attraction has a 48-inch height minimum.
 Ketchakiddie Creek is a kiddie area designed exclusively for the
kiddie set (2–5 years). An innovative water playground, it has bub-
bling fountains in which kids can frolic, mini waterslides, a pint-size
white-water tubing run, spouting whales and squirting seals, rubbery
crocodiles on which to climb, grottoes to explore, and waterfalls
under which to loll. 
 Typhoon Lagoon is the park’s main swimming area. This large
(2.75 million gallons) and lovely lagoon (one of the world’s largest
inland wave pools) is the size of two football fields and is surrounded
by a white sandy beach. The chlorinated water has a turquoise hue
much like the waters of the Caribbean. Large waves hit the shore
every 90 seconds. A foghorn sounds to warn you when a wave is
coming. Young children can wade in the lagoon’s more peaceful
tidal pools — Blustery Bay and Whitecap Cove.
You can catch a wave at popular early-bird surfing sessions that
take place at the lagoon on select mornings before the park offi-
cially opens. For those not brave enough to learn in the ocean,
this controlled environment may be a good alternative. For more
information on the surfing program, see Chapter 27.
 White-Water Rides, found in Mount Mayday, is the setting for three
white-water rafting adventures — Keelhaul Falls, Mayday Falls, and
Gang Plank Falls — all of which offer steep drops coursing through
caves and passing lush scenery. Keelhaul Falls has the most spiral-
ing route, Mayday Falls has the steepest drops and fastest water,
and the slightly tamer Gang Plank Falls uses large tubes so that the
whole family can pile on.

Enjoying the Holiday Season at Disney
Disney uses extra pixie dust during the holidays as the parks and resorts
are decked out even more spectacularly than you can even imagine.
They bring out the holiday spirit in a way only Disney can. Lights, trees,
caroling, and special activities begin around Thanksgiving and last until
the first of the new year. For more information on all of the events in this
section, call % 407-934-7639 or check out www.disneyworld.com.
Three of the best Yuletide attractions include the following:
 Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party, an after-dark ticketed
event (7 p.m. to midnight), takes place on select nights at Magic
Kingdom and offers a traditional Christmas parade and a breath-
taking fireworks display. The charge ($44 adults, $35 kids 3–9; if
purchased in advance you will save $5 per ticket) includes cookies,
cocoa, and a souvenir photo. The best part? Shorter lines for the
rides that are open.
 The Candlelight Procession at Epcot features hundreds of candle-
holding carolers, a celebrity narrator telling a Christmas story, a
450-voice choir, and a 50-piece orchestra. Also held on select nights,
this moving event features several celebrities during its five-week run.
Normal theme park admission ($60 adults, $48 kids 3–9) is charged.
 The Osborne Family Spectacle of Lights came to Disney–MGM
Studios in 1995, when an Arkansas family ran into trouble with home-
town authorities over their multimillion-light display. It seems they’d
committed the ultimate Little Rock sin, taking to heart the old hymn
that says, “You can’t be a beacon if your light don’t shine.” Their
Christmas-light collection of 2-million-plus blinkers, twinklers, and
strands was so bright that their neighbors complained. (Imagine it
next to your bedroom window!) After the flow of faithful spectators
in cars caused mile-long backups, the neighbors, finally seeing the
light, went to court. Disney came to the rescue and, in 1995, moved
the whole thing to Orlando, adding a million or so bulbs to the dis-
play. You can see it all for the normal park admission ($60 adults,
$48 kids 3–9). 
 For those 21 and over, Downtown Disney’s Pleasure Island features
an Island Wide New Year’s Eve celebration featuring big name per-
formers (in the past acts have included Cheap Trick, Tone Loc, Kurtis
Blow, and Kim Waters among others). Tickets include entrance to
all the P.I. clubs and a spectacular midnight fireworks display —
not to mention all the loud music your ears can handle. 
The other Orlando parks and many of the WDW resorts hold their own
holiday festivities featuring special activities, spectacular decorations,
holiday-themed parades, and more. Be sure to ask in advance or check
with your concierge or at guest services when you arrive. 
Chapter 16: Enjoying the Rest of Walt Disney World 245

Sailing the Seas with Disney
It took them a while to catch on, which is unusual for the Disney folks,
but they finally discovered another place to expand their empire — the
high seas. Despite delays, the Disney Cruise Line launched the Disney
Magic and the Disney Wonder in 1998 and 1999, respectively.
The two ships have small differences. The Magic is Art Deco, with a giant
Mickey in its three-level lobby and a Beauty and the Beast mural in its top
restaurant, Lumiere’s. The Wonder is Art Nouveau; Ariel commands its
lobby, and its featured eatery, Triton’s, sports a mural from The Little
Mermaid. Both ships have recently been refurbished.
The restaurants, nightlife, shows, and other onboard activities on both
vessels are very family-oriented (indeed, the Disney ships are the best in
all cruisedom for kids). One of the ships’ unique features is a dine-around
option that lets you move among main restaurants (each ship has four)
from night to night while keeping the same servers. Disney also offers
Castaway Cay, its own private Bahamian island featuring water sports
and other activities.
The Disney Magic sails seven-day eastern Caribbean (St. Thomas,
St. Maarten, and Castaway Cay) and seven-day western Caribbean
(Key West, Grand Cayman, Cozumel, and Castaway Cay) itineraries
on an alternating basis year-round. A special 10-day Caribbean cruise
is scheduled for the end of December 2006; call for details and rates.
The Disney Wonder offers shorter three- and four-day Bahamas cruises
that are often (though not necessarily) sold as part of seven-day vaca-
tion packages, combining the sailings with a Walt Disney World land
experience. Subtle differences aside, these two ships are nearly identical
twins. Both are 83,000 tons with 12 decks, 875 extra large cabins, and
room for up to 1,755 guests (when each ship’s children’s berths are filled
to capacity, that total can reach as high as 3,325). The ships have some
adults-only areas, but no casinos.
Recently updated, the line’s free kids’ programs are some of the best at
sea. Just like at Disney World, costumed Disney characters are available
at scheduled times during the voyage, so that passengers can line up
for hugs and photos. The children’s program is divided into four age
groups: the Flounder’s Reef Nursery for ages 3 months to 3 years;
Disney’s Oceaneer Club for ages 3 to 7; Disney’s Oceaneer Lab for ages
8 to 12; and The Stack for ages 13 to 17. Each program offers numerous
age-appropriate activities and diversions. 
Especially important to parents with young kids, Disney has expanded its
Flounder’s Reef Nursery on both ships to hold as many as 30 children
with a child/counselor ratio of four to one. Extended hours are featured
on seven-night cruises so parents can dine alone, try a spa treatment, or
sneak off for a shore excursion. Best of all, unlike other cruise lines, the
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
246

nursery welcomes infants from as young as 12 weeks old to 3-year-old
toddlers. The space has cribs and counselors do change diapers (though
you must supply them). The price is $6 per child per hour with a two-
hour minimum.
You can get discounted fares if you book well in advance and go during
non-peak periods. The line also offers special fares for kids 3 to 12 travel-
ing as a third, fourth, or fifth passenger sharing a cabin with two adults.
All cruises depart from Port Canaveral, which is about an hour east of
Orlando by car. If you buy a Land and Sea package, transportation to and
from Orlando is included. For more information, call Disney Cruise Line
or check out its very informative Web site, which also allows you to plan
and reserve shore excursions before you go. 
Hwy. 528 at A1A, Cape Canaveral. % 800-951-3532. www.disneycruise.com.
Seven-day land-sea packages include three or four days afloat with the rest of the
week at a WDW resort. Prices range from $799–$5,199 for adults, $399–$2,199 for
kids 3–12, and $139 for kids younger than 3, depending on your choice of resort and
stateroom. Some packages include round-trip air, and unlimited admission to Disney
parks, Pleasure Island, and other attractions. Cruise-only options for three nights are
$399–$2,849 for adults, $229–$1,099 for kids 3–12, and $99 for those younger than 3;
four-night cruises are $499–$3,249 for adults, $329–$1,199 for kids 3–12, and $99 for
kids younger than 3.

Shopping in Walt 
Disney World
In This Chapter
 Getting money-saving tips
 Shopping inside the parks
 Cruising the shopping districts outside of Disney
 Taking advantage of airport options
P
art of the fun of going on vacation is stocking up on souvenirs. A
trip to Walt Disney World shouldn’t be any different — unless you
want to arrive home with money in your wallet. In this chapter, you dis-
cover the ins and outs of shopping for Walt Disney World mementos. 
Money-Saving Tips for Top-Notch Take-Homes
The kids are tugging at your shirt, begging you for 14-carat mouse ears
and the biggest stuffed Mickey on the planet, your mother just has to have
a pair of Goofy slippers, and you’ve always wanted a crystal Cinderella
clock for the den. Then you see the price tags. Gasp! Are they kidding?
No, unfortunately, they are not.
You’re an emotional and physical captive of a commercial enterprise
sprinkled with feel-good pixie dust when you’re at Disney. Now I’m just
guessing and don’t know this for sure, but I think Disney uses a simple
formula for setting prices: Start with reasonable retail and then multiply . . .
by three. Don’t panic just yet, not everything is so completely out of
reach, and if you keep reading I’ll point you in the right direction. 
But no matter how much I warn you, most of you probably won’t escape
without a sizable contribution to the stockholders’ fund, especially if it’s
your first trip to Walt Disney World or you have kids in tow. So before you
start spending, here are a few things to think about:
 If there’s a Disney Store near your hometown, some of what’s sold
in the Disney parks likely is sold in there as well. You can also get a
fairly large selection of it on the Internet through the shopping link

at www.disney.com. So there’s no need to rush into a purchase.
(Notable exceptions however are goods sold in the World Showcase
pavilions at Epcot and Walt Disney World logo merchandise sold
throughout the parks.) 
 At the other end of the spectrum, many WDW shops sell products
themed to their particular area of the park (such as the shops
found at the exit of many rides or the kiosks found throughout
the different lands), and finding the identical item elsewhere 
in the parks (let alone outside the parks) may be difficult at best.
(You do get an eleventh-hour shot at the airport, but the selection
is limited. See “Last Chance: Shopping for Disney Doodads at the
Airport,” at the end of this chapter.)
 Don’t be fooled the discount stores offering you a “bargain.” You
usually won’t find bargains or discounts on true or authentic WDW
merchandise anywhere. If someone offers you one (especially out-
side the parks), beware. The bargain or discount may be a cheap
imitation or knock off — or worse, “hot.” 
 Theme park shops keep the same hours as the attractions: usually
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (or whatever time the park happens to close that
day) though the main shops near the parks’ entrances often remain
open at least a few minutes extra for those last minute shoppers on
their way out.
 Don’t forget to account for the 6.5 percent sales tax on purchases.
Loading Up Your Cart at 
Walt Disney World
In general, you’ll find three categories of merchandise in the WDW parks.
Souvenirs that scream “Disney!” are the most common. (The number of
choices — from Ariel to Winnie the Pooh and beyond — can, and will,
fog your brain.) Collectibles, including some not related to Disney, are
another. You find these items in some of the Main Street shops in the
Magic Kingdom, as well as around the World Showcase in Epcot and
at the Downtown Disney Marketplace. The last category, merchandise
native to the 11 countries showcased throughout Epcot’s World Showcase,
and is completely unrelated to Disney whatsoever, is aptly considered a
World Showcase specialty.
Why lug all your bulky purchases around? You can send your purchases
from any store to designated areas near the entrance, where you can pick
them up as you leave the park that day. In the Magic Kingdom, you can
pick up packages at Guest Relations next to City Hall in the Plaza area. In
Epcot, you can send your packages to The Gift Stop in the Entrance Plaza
or the World Traveler at the International Gateway in World Showcase.
Disney–MGM Studios shop clerks will send your goodies to the package
pickup next to Oscar’s Super Service in front of the park. And you can
Chapter 17: Shopping in Walt Disney World 249

pick up your Animal Kingdom purchases at Garden Gate Gifts near the
Entrance Plaza. (Allow at least three hours for delivery.) If you’re a Disney
resort guest, you can have your packages delivered to your room for
free — ask the shops about this service. Packages, however, may not
arrive until the next afternoon if purchased prior to 7 p.m.; if purchased
after 7 p.m. they will arrive the second afternoon after your purchase
was made. 
Magic Kingdom
The Emporium along Main Street, U.S.A., has a large selection of
Disneyana including pricey collectibles such as Minnie Mouse cookie
jars and vintage Mickey Mouse wristwatches, as well as apparel, toys,
and trinkets. The Fantasy Faire inside Cinderella Castle sells family
crests, tapestries, suits of armor, and other medieval wares, as well as
miniature carousels.
Pirates Bazaar in Adventureland peddles hats, Captain Hook T-shirts,
ships in bottles, toy muskets, and loads of other yo-ho-ho buccaneer
booty, in addition to jewelry and a small selection of resort wear. It’s 
outside the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Also look for the tiny little
shack (selling mostly camera supplies) just up the way before you get
to Frontierland — it sells Mickey and Minnie two-way radios, which
are a great way to communicate in the parks. 
The Frontier Trading Post in Frontierland hawks cowboy hats, western
shirts, coonskin caps, turquoise jewelry, belts, and toy rifles.
The Yankee Trader in Liberty Square is a charming country store that
sells Lion King and Pooh cookie jars, Disney cookie cutters, and fancy
food items. Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe features plenty of holiday ideas,
some Disney, some not.
Sir Mickey’s in Fantasyland is supply central for a variety of Disney-motif
trinkets. Wares at Tinker Bell’s Treasures include Peter Pan merchan-
dise, costumes (Tinker Bell, Snow White, Cinderella, Pocahontas, and
others), and collector dolls. And just at the exit of Mickey’s PhilharMagic,
you’ll find a collection of trinkets, toys, and T’s that feature Donald Duck. 
Pooh’s Thotful Shop in Fantasyland is dedicated to 100 Acre gang mer-
chandise, including plenty of Pooh and Tigger items. 
Inside the Toontown Hall of Fame you’ll find a large array of toys, T’s,
candy, and other Disney-themed trinkets.
Mickey’s Star Traders and Merchants of Venus in Tomorrowland is
another place to get a look at Disney collectibles along with just about
anything else Disney, and the spaceship shaped kiosk just outside Buzz
Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin has enough Toy Story toys to fill any
kid’s toy chest.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
250

Epcot
World Showcase pavilions carry unique and unusual items that represent
their respective pavilion’s country. Following are some of the shopping
highlights.
Heritage Manor Gifts in The American Adventure sells autographed
presidential photographs, needlepoint samplers, quilts, pottery, candles,
Davy Crockett hats, books on American history, historically costumed
dolls, classic political campaign buttons, and vintage newspapers with
banner headlines such as “Nixon Resigns!” You can also buy Disney art
and character merchandise, as well as popular Disney pins.
The Canada pavilion’s Northwest Mercantile carries sandstone and
soapstone carvings, fringed leather vests, duck decoys, moccasins,
an array of stuffed animals, Native American dolls and spirit stones,
rabbit-skin caps, knitted sweaters, and, of course, maple syrup.
China’s Yong Feng Shangdian Department Store is a bustling marketplace
filled with an array of merchandise including silk robes, brocade pajamas,
lacquer and inlaid mother-of-pearl furniture, jade figures, cloisonné vases,
tea sets, silk rugs and embroideries, dolls, fans, wind chimes, and clothing.
Artisans demonstrate calligraphy here, too.
Emporia is the covered shopping area filled with several little boutiques
found in France. Merchandise includes art, cookbooks, cookware, wines
(there’s a tasting counter), Madeline and Babar books and dolls, perfumes,
and original letters written by famous Frenchmen, such as Napoleon.
This is one of only two locations in the entire world to feature signature
Guerlain fragrances (cosmetics and accessories are available as well). 
Germany’s shops feature Hümmel figurines (one of only eight worldwide
locations to carry a complete collection), crystal, glassware, cookware,
cuckoo clocks, cowbells, Alpine hats, German wines (there’s a tasting
counter) and foods, books, and toys (German Disneyana, teddy bears,
dolls, and puppets). An artisan sometimes demonstrates molding and
painting Hümmel figures; another paints detailed scenes on eggs.
La Cucina Italiana and Il Bel Cristallo in Italy stock cameo and delicate
filigree jewelry, fine-leather goods, Armani figurines, cookware, Italian
wines and foods, Murano and other Venetian glass, alabaster figurines,
inlaid wooden music boxes, and festive Carnivale masks.
The Mitsukoshi Department Store (Japan’s answer to Sears) stocks lac-
querware, kimonos, kites, fans, dolls in traditional costumes, origami
books, samurai swords, Japanese Disneyana, bonsai trees, Japanese
foods, Netsuke carvings, pottery, and electronics. Artisans in the court-
yard demonstrate the ancient arts of anesaiku (shaping brown rice candy
into dragons, unicorns, and dolphins), sumi-e (calligraphy), and origami
(paper folding). Kids interested in the Hello Kitty gang or anime cartoons
will find plenty to ask you to buy. 
Chapter 17: Shopping in Walt Disney World 251

Given Tokyo’s notorious astronomical prices, this store may be one of
the few places in WDW where you can actually score a relative bargain. 
Shops in and around the Plaza de Los Amigos (a Mexican mercado
market with a tiered fountain and street lamps) display an array of
leather goods, baskets, sombreros, piñatas, pottery, embroidered
dresses and blouses, maracas, jewelry, serapes, paper flowers, colorful
papier-mâché birds, and blown-glass objects (an artisan gives glass-
blowing demonstrations).
Morocco’s streets lead to the souk, a bustling marketplace where 
handcrafted pottery, brassware, hand-knotted Berber carpets, color-
ful Rabat carpets, ornate silver and camel-bone boxes, straw baskets,
and prayer rugs are sold. You can also catch weaving demonstrations
during the day.
Norway’s shops sell hand-knitted wool hats and sweaters (including a
collection by Dale of Norway), toys (there’s a LEGO table where kids can
play), trolls, woodcarvings, Scandinavian foods, pewterware, jewelry,
and Christmas items. There’s also a nice selection of fragrances, body
creams, and candles.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
252
Great things to buy at Epcot
Epcot’s World Showcase shines in the shopping department. Although the selections
here change from time to time and may not necessarily represent bargains — Disney
never quits trying to lighten your wallet — they are the kind of unique and unusual items
you may not find anywhere else.
 If you’re into silver jewelry, don’t miss the Mexico pavilion. You can find trinkets
ranging from simple flowered hair clips to stone-and-silver bracelets.
 The shops in Norway have great sweaters and Scandinavian trolls that are so ugly,
you’re likely to fall in love with them.
 In China, browse through jade teardrop earrings, Disney art, and more. Its mer-
chandise is among the most expensive and most fetching in Epcot.
 Italy’s 100-percent silk scarves and ties come in several patterns.
 Style-conscious teenagers may love a Taquia knit cap, something of a colorful
fezlike chapeau, that’s available in Morocco. You can also find beautifully painted
pottery.
 Wimbledon shirts, shorts, and skirts are among the hard-to-find items in the
United Kingdom, which also has an assortment of tea accessories, sweaters, and
Beatles memorabilia.

High Street and Tudor Lane shops in the United Kingdom display a broad
sampling of British merchandise, including toy soldiers, Paddington bears,
Thomas the Tank Engine wooden train sets, personalized coats of arms,
Scottish clothing (cashmere and Shetland sweaters, golf wear, tams, knits,
and tartans), Wimbledon sportswear, fine English china, Waterford crys-
tal, and pub items such as tankards and dartboards. A tea shop occupies
a replica of Anne Hathaway’s thatch-roofed 16th-century cottage in
Stratford-upon-Avon. Other stores represent the Georgian, Victorian,
Queen Anne, and Tudor periods.
Disney–MGM Studios
The Animation Gallery carries collectible animation cels, books about
animation, arts-and-crafts kits for future animators, and collector figurines.
Sid Cahuenga’s One-of-a-Kind sells autographed photos of the stars,
original movie posters, and star-touched jewelry and other memorabilia.
Over at The Darkroom/Cover Story, you can have your photograph put
on the cover of your favorite magazine, anything from Forbes to Psychology
Today to Golf Digest. Celebrity 5 & 10, modeled after a 1940s Woolworth’s,
is filled with unique Disneyesque housewares, MGM Studio T-shirts, and
movie posters.
Many of the park’s major attractions also have shops or kiosks filled
with items such as Indiana Jones adventure clothing, Little Mermaid
stuffed characters, Star Wars light sabers and LEGO sets, and so on.
Animal Kingdom
The Oasis’s Outpost Shop deals in T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, toys, and
other souvenir items.
Beastly Bazaar in Safari Village has a wide selection of items related to
The Tree of Life and the show, It’s Tough to Be a Bug! Along with choco-
lates, candies, and home décor items. Creature Comforts sells clothing,
stuffed animals, and toys, and is mostly geared for kids. Island Mercantile
offers theme merchandise that represents the park’s lands with a plenti-
tude of character merchandise. They also have a hair-braiding service
and are a pin-trading location.
Mombasa Marketplace/Ziwani Traders in Africa sells Kilimanjaro Safaris
apparel and gifts, as well as realistic animal items, including beautiful
wood carvings, and other authentic African gifts.
Chester & Hester’s Dinosaur Treasures in DinoLand U.S.A. has wild
and wacky dinosaur souvenirs, tons of toys, and T-shirts.
Other shopping ops include Mandala Gifts in Asia just beyond Kali
River Rapids and the Dino Institute Shop just beyond DINOSAUR in
DinoLand U.S.A. 
Chapter 17: Shopping in Walt Disney World 253

Disney Shopping Outside the Theme Parks
Don’t think that the enticement to spend money magically disappears
when you step outside the theme parks. Walt Disney World also encom-
passes some shopping districts that house a multitude of shops — some
of which carry merchandise you can’t get anywhere else — that offer
you the chance to blow your budget.
Disney West Side
Disney West Side has many rather unique specialty stores where you
can find plenty of unusual gifts and souvenirs.
Guitar Gallery tempts string-strokers with custom guitars, including
one-of-a-kind and rare collectibles with a selection of accessories, books,
and clothing. Hoypoloi Gallery is a New Age store offering artsy glass,
ceramics, sculptures, and other decorative doodads made from metal,
stone, and wood. Magnetron is — well, wow! Can there be a market for
this many refrigerator magnets? Magic Masters, a re-creation of Harry
Houdini’s private library, is the place for magic tricks and illusions, and the
magic experts here often entertain guests with a few tricks of their own.
Smoking may be on the way to sayonara-ville, but Sosa Family Cigars
beckons with sweet smells and a tradition reaching back to yesterday’s
Cuba. Over at Starabilias, the main events are jukeboxes, Coke machines,
and other lost treasures. 
Disney West Side (% 407-828-3800; www.disneyworld.com) is on
Buena Vista Drive. From I-4, exit on Highway 536 or Highway 535 and
follow the signs. Some shop times vary, but the complex is open daily
from 9:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Downtown Disney Marketplace
Basin offers a cornucopia of fresh-made bath products, including glycerin
soaps and wonderful bath bombs. The Art of Disney is a one-of-a-kind
gallery that also includes sculpture, crystal, and more. EUROSPAIN comes
calling with products that crystal and metal artists make before your eyes.
Once Upon a Toy has Disney-themed versions of many popular games,
including Mr. Potato Head and Monopoly.
The newly-renovated LEGO Imagination Center is one of the best shops
around. This spot is fabulous for moms and dads to relax while your
young whippersnappers unwind in a free LEGO building play area beside
the store. World of Disney comes with the (don’t-hold-it-to-them) prom-
ise that if it exists, and it’s Disney, it’s on their shelves.
Downtown Disney Marketplace (% 407-828-3800; www.disneyworld.
com) is on Buena Vista Drive at Hotel Plaza Boulevard. From I-4, exit on
Highway 536 or Highway 535 and follow the signs. It’s open daily from
9:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.

Part V
Exploring the Rest
of Orlando

In this part . . . 
M
ickey may be the toughest mouse around, but he
doesn’t own Orlando anymore. Yes, this is still the
town that Disney built, but the fact is, half of the eight big-
league attractions in Orlando don’t belong to Disney.
This part of the book explores the rest of Orlando, including
the exciting attractions at Universal Orlando as well as what
you ﬁnd at SeaWorld, Discovery Cove, the smaller attractions,
and some of the best shopping venues outside the parks. It
also includes information on great day trips to two of the
most popular attractions outside of the immediate Orlando
area: Busch Gardens and the Kennedy Space Center.

 Seeing the best things at Universal Studios Florida
 Eating at USF
 Shopping for souvenirs
W
ith two studios in Orlando, you soon get the picture, literally and
figuratively, about which studio produces what films in the movie
business. Both Universal and Disney–MGM Studios (see Chapter 14) have
plenty to offer, and they both spend plenty of money plugging their movies
and characters. At Universal, that investment means you’ll encounter the
Mummy, Twister, Terminator, Jaws, E.T., Shrek, Barney, and many more.
You’ll also find plenty of grown-up, cutting edge, hurl-’em-and-twirl-’em
rides, such as Back to the Future, Men in Black Alien Attack, and Earthquake.
Universal has recently made great strides to appeal to younger kids as
well, especially with Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone and its pint-size rides,
shows, and play areas.
As a plus, Universal is a working television and movie studio, so occa-
sionally there’s some live filming done at Nickelodeon’s sound stages or
elsewhere in the park. You can also see reel history displayed in the form
of actual sets exhibited along Hollywood Boulevard and Rodeo Drive.
A talented troupe of actors portraying Universal stars, such as the Blues
Brothers, or a wide range of not-so-recognizable characters, often wander
the park chatting with guests along the way. And park shows, such as
Terminator 2: 3D Battle Across Time and Fear Factor Live deliver heart-
pumping excitement.
In this chapter, I give you helpful hints and basic information about visit-
ing Universal Studios Florida and experiencing its attractions.
Finding Out Important Park Information
Before I get on to the good stuff of USF, I first need to get the logistical
information out of the way; believe me, you’ll appreciate it when you get
there.

Buying tickets and making reservations
You can choose from several ticket options and tours: 
 A one-day ticket costs $60 (plus 6.5 percent sales tax) for adults,
$48 for children 3 to 9. 
 A two-day, two-park, bonus pass, is $105 for adults and children.
These passes enable you to move between Universal Studios Florida
and Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19) throughout the day so
you can go back and forth whenever you like. Note: For a limited
time, if you buy them online (www.universalorlando.com), you
get two more days for free, for a total of four consecutive days of
admission. Bonus passes also give you free access at night to select
CityWalk clubs (see Chapter 25). 
 Annual Passes (the Preferred Annual Pass and the Power Pass)
allow entry to the park for an entire year (some blackout dates
apply to the Power Pass; there are no blackout dates with the
Preferred Annual Pass). The cost is $180 and $120 respectively.
For more details check out www.universalorlando.com. 
 The FlexTicket multiday, multipark option is the most economical
way to see the various “other-than-Disney” parks. You pay one price
to visit any and all of the participating parks during a 14-day period.
A four-park pass to Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure,
Wet ’n Wild, and SeaWorld is $185 for adults and $151 for children 3
to 9. A five-park pass, which adds Busch Gardens in Tampa, is $225
for adults and $190 for kids. You can order the FlexTicket by calling
% 407-363-8000 or online by going to www.universalorlando.com.
 Universal Studios Florida offers five-hour, guided VIP tours for
$100 per person for just USF, $125 per person for a two-park, six-hour
tour that also includes Islands of Adventure. Guided tours include
line-cutting privileges and preferred seating at several attractions,
and they start at 10 a.m. and noon daily. For more information on
the VIP tour, call % 407-363-8295. Note: The price of the VIP tour
includes neither the 6.5 percent sales tax nor admission to the park!
The park prices are not the only place you’ll wish you’d left your wallet
behind. Expect to spend up to $2.50 for a coke, $1.80 for a cup of coffee,
about $5 for a beer, $2.60 for popcorn, and $2.50 for bottled water.
However, you can save 10 percent on your purchases at any gift shop or
on a meal by showing your AAA (American Automobile Association)
card. This discount isn’t available at food or merchandise carts. Likewise,
tobacco, candy, film, collectibles, and sundry items aren’t included in
discounts.
For information about new travel packages and theme-park information,
call % 800-711-0080, 800-224-4233, or 407-363-8000; write to Guest Services
at Universal Studios Florida, 1000 Universal Studios Plaza, Orlando, FL
32819-7601; or visit its Web site at www.universalorlndo.com. Once
you’re at the park, just head over to Guest Services.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
260

Universal Orlando is located about half a mile north of I-4’s Kirkman Road/
Highway 435 exit. You may find construction in the area, so keep an eye
out for the road signs directing you to Universal Orlando.
The park is open 365 days a year. Park hours generally are from 9 a.m. to
6 or 7 p.m., though they vary seasonally and might close as late as 10 p.m.
during the summer and on holidays. Call or check online before you go
for exact times.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATMs accepting cards from banks using the Cirrus, STAR, and Plus
systems are on the outside and just inside Universal’s entrance and
in San Francisco/Amity near Lombard’s Seafood Grille restaurant.
 You can find baby-changing tables in all men’s and women’s 
restrooms; nursing facilities are at Family Services, just inside
the main entrance and to the right. (Family Services doesn’t sell 
diapers or infant supplies of any kind, so be sure that you bring
enough of your own.)
 Disposable cameras and film (and limited digital supplies) are
available at the On Location shop in the Front Lot, just inside the
main entrance. One-hour photo developing is available, but I don’t
recommend paying park prices. You can find many cheaper one-hour
or overnight places around town, including many near tourist-area
motels. 
 Universal has its own version of Disney’s FASTPASS, called Universal
EXPRESS. The system operates much the same as Disney’s does.
You feed your admission ticket into the machine at the EXPRESS
Distribution Center for a given ride (they’re usually located close
to the entrance of rides that accept EXPRESS passes) and you get
a second pass (along with your park ticket) stamped with a desig-
nated time window in which you can return to ride. At any time
within the window you can head straight for the shorter EXPRESS
line (usually no more than 15 minutes) and off you go. You can only
get one EXPRESS pass at a time, but similar to Disney, you can get a
second pass just two hours after the first one is issued — the time
you can obtain your next EXPRESS pass is printed on the first pass.
If you’re not willing to chance that there will be an EXPRESS pass
left (and they do run out, sometimes as early as noon during peak
periods) you can purchase the Universal EXPRESS Plus Pass. It
allows access to the Express line at each and every attraction that
accepts the Universal Express Pass without having to continually
obtain separate passes or wait for any time limits to expire before
heading to Universal Express line at the next attraction. The price
varies with the season, and I have seen prices as high as $39 during
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 261

peak periods. In addition, it is only good for one day at one park,
regardless of what type of park tickets you hold, and it can only be
used once at each of the attractions. 
 Universal offers a separate line-beating option as a perk for those
visitors staying at its resorts. All guests of the Portofino Bay, Hard
Rock, and Royal Pacific hotels have to do is to show their room
keys to get at or near the front of the line for most of the rides and
even most of the restaurants. 
 You can find first aid centers between New York and San Francisco,
next to Louie’s Italian Restaurant, and just inside the main entrance
next to Guest Services.
 Rent lockers for $8 and $10 a day plus a $2 refundable deposit
across from Guest Services, near the main entrance.
 Report lost children to any staff member and then go to Guest
Services near the main entrance or Security (behind Louie’s Italian
Restaurant, between New York and San Francisco). Make sure chil-
dren younger than 7 wear name-tags inside their clothing for easy
identification in case they get lost.
 When parking in multilevel garages, write down your location,
including the character, level, row, and space number so you can
find your car later. Parking costs $9 for cars and trucks. Valet park-
ing is available for $16. After 6 p.m., parking is free. Universal’s
garages are connected to its parks by walkways and a series of
moving sidewalks, but reaching the gates can take a while. 
 The park provides car assistance, including battery jumps. If you
need assistance with your car, raise the hood and tell any parking
attendant your location. Use the call boxes located throughout the
parking garage to call for security.
 Pet care for your small animals is available at the shelter in the
parking garages for $10 a day (no overnight stays), but you’ll have
to feed and walk your animals yourself. Ask the parking attendant
where you pay for parking to direct you to the kennel.
 Rent strollers in Amity and at Guest Services, just inside the entrance
to the right. The cost is $10 for a single and $16 for a double.
 You can rent regular wheelchairs for $12 per day in Amity and at
Guest Services just inside the main gate. Electric wheelchairs are
$40 per day. Both require a $50 deposit and a signed contract.
 Package delivery is available for purchases made at park stores
(though not at the kiosks and carts). You can have your purchases
sent to the Universal Studios Store near the entrance to be picked
up on your way out. If you are a guest at one of the three Universal
Resorts you can have your purchased delivered to your room
(though delivery will be the following day, so don’t try this if it’s
your last day).
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
262

If you find you have arrived home without that essential USF T-shirt
or all-important blaster gun, you can call % 407-224-5800 and the
Universal Mail Order Department will help. Just let them know
what the item is, where it is located, and they can arrange to have
it shipped to you house (for a fee, of course). 
Exploring the Top Attractions
Universal matches Disney stride for stride, and in some cases is a half-
step ahead, when it comes to cutting-edge rides. Real and virtual thrills,
terrific special effects, mammoth screens, and 3-D action are all part of
its successful mix.
The rides and shows at Universal are located in six distinctive sets:
Hollywood, New York, Production Central, San Francisco/Amity,
Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone, and World Expo. The Front Lot serves
as the parks main entrance. Universal is much better than Disney at
keeping you occupied while you’re standing in line. There are entertain-
ing preshows, some of which are just as amusing or interesting as the
main event, and elaborate surroundings intended to create the feeling
that you’ve already begun your experience. Most of the lines are under
cover from the sun, with the occasional water spritzer or drinking foun-
tain nearby. Although these extras may not initially seem like a big deal,
it makes your time in line far more tolerable.
The “Universal Studios Florida” map, found on page 258, will help you
visualize the layout of the park.
Hollywood
Hollywood is to the right of the Front Lot, and its main streets include
Rodeo Drive, Hollywood Boulevard, and Sunset Boulevard, all lined
with ornate buildings in soft hues, much like you would have found in
Hollywood’s heyday so many years ago. Here’s a list of the best that
Hollywood has to offer:
 Lucy — A Tribute. This show is a remembrance of America’s queen
of comedy, Lucille Ball. If you love Lucy, it’s a must, filled with memo-
rabilia and a really neat interactive trivia game, but if you’re pressed
for time or have a handful of smaller kids along, it’s skippable.
 Terminator 2: 3D Battle Across Time. This attraction is billed as
“the quintessential sight and sound experience for the 21st century!”
and the park has little need to be modest about its claim. The movie’s
director, Jim Cameron, supervised this $60-million production which
combines 3-D film, live action, and sensory effects into a seamless
winner. After a slower start (the preshow sets up a pre-Terminator
storyline), it builds to one of the best action shows in Orlando. Live
actors and six giant Cyborgs interact with the Governator himself,
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 263

who appears on-screen (actually three huge screens). The crisp 3-D
effects are among the best in Orlando. (When liquid mercury falls
from the screen, cold water really hits your legs.)
“All the action was so cool, and the motorcycle and special effects
were amazing. I thought for sure the hand that came out into the
audience was going to grab me,” says 12-year-old Ryan. The show,
however, is rated PG-13, Universal’s way of saying violence and
loud noises may make it unsuitable for preteens. Younger children
may find the crashing and flying 3-D effects (in conjunction with a
few of the sensory effects) too intense.
 Universal Horror Make-up Show. This show (loaded with corny
humor) gives you a behind-the-scenes look at the wizardry behind
Hollywood’s monster makeup. It also takes an up-close look at some
cinematic make-up masterpieces, including the transformation
scenes from such movies as The Fly and The Exorcist. It, too, is
rated PG-13, mostly due to the scary on-screen characters.
New York
New York is near the back of the park and includes rides and shows set
among mock-ups of 42nd and 57th streets, Park Avenue, and Delancey
Street. The premiere attractions in this section are:
 The Blues Brothers. This foot-stomping revue takes to the street
(Delancey Street, actually) five times a day. Clap along as Jake and
Elwood, the “bad boys of the blues,” belt out a medley of their
greatest hits.
 Twister . . . Ride it Out. This windy incarnation of Earthquake —
The Big One (discussed later in this chapter) packs quite a wallop.
Based on the hit film, the curtain rises on the movie town of Wakita,
where Universal engineers have created a five-story funnel cloud
by injecting 2 million cubic feet of air per minute. (That’s enough to
fill four full-size blimps.) The sensory elements are pretty incredi-
ble. Power lines spark and fall, an oak tree splits, and the storm
rumbles at rock-concert level as cars, trucks, and a cow fly about
while the audience watches from only 20 feet away. In the finale,
the floor begins to buckle at your feet. The only downside is that
you tend to get way too much water whipped at your face (it is a
tornado, after all).
“You don’t really ride anything as much as walk through it, but it
was pretty intense,” Nicolas offered. It’s similar to the Backdraft
attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood, though that California
attraction is (sacrilege!) actually a bit better than this one. Twister
doesn’t have a minimum height, but it carries Universal’s PG-13
rating, meaning it may be a little too intense for younger children.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
264

Production Central
Production Central is directly behind and to the left of the Front Lot. Its
main thoroughfares are Nickelodeon Way, Plaza of the Stars, and 7th and
8th avenues. Here are some of the area’s highlights:
 Jimmy Neutron’s Nicktoon Blast. Launched in 2003, this ride is
based on the movie Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius. Here, you climb
aboard a Mark IV rocket and motion-simulator technology and
sophisticated computer graphics send you on a spinning, careening
adventure that includes a battle against Yokians — evil, egg-shaped
aliens. The attraction also features characters from several popular
cartoons, including Rugrats and Fairly Odd Parents. If you feel any
twinge of motion sickness, simply look at any stationary object
within the large theater. 
“It was cool, just like being part of the TV show. The Chicken Dance
was pretty funny, too,” Nicolas (age 8) and his younger sister, Hailey
(age 6), were impressed with this very kid-friendly ride. That having
been said, kids do need to be at least 40 inches tall to ride. There is
a small area near the front for those who would prefer to skip the
moving spaceships.
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 265
Hello Mummy!
Kongfrontation, long a fixture at Universal Studios Florida, closed in September 2002
to make room for the spring 2004 opening of Revenge of the Mummy in the New York
section of the park. Billed as a “psychological thrill ride,” the new $40-million indoor
roller coaster relies on speed, pyrotechnics, and robotics to induce screams as riders
hurtle through the elaborate Egyptian sets, passageways, and tombs in cars that move
forward and even in reverse. Even the preshow for the waiting victims — riders, I
mean riders — lends to the ominous atmosphere and includes several surprise inter-
active areas and a storyline that plays out as you get closer to boarding the ride. 
The five-minute journey aims to prey on one’s inner phobias via encounters with over-
head flames, pitch-black darkness, insects, and a skeletal warrior that hops aboard
your coaster. Does it work? Yes — and how. Even the most-manly man in my coaster
car was screaming, though you’d have a fat chance of getting him to admit it after-
wards. The best confession I got was when a friend admitted that he hasn’t freaked
out on a ride like that since the first time he rode the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror
(see Chapter 14) over ten years ago (and that was before the random sequencing). So
if you have any severe phobias or medical conditions, pay attention to the warnings
posted, and don’t even think about getting aboard. Coaster-lovers of all ages will likely
make this one tops on their list. You must be at least 48 inches tall to ride.

 Nickelodeon Studios. Tour the soundstages where Nick shows are
produced, view concept pilots, visit the kitchen where Gak and green
slime are made, and try new Sega video games at the Game Lab.
This 45-minute behind-the-scenes tour is a fun escape from the
hustle of the midway, and there’s plenty of audience participation.
One child volunteer always gets slimed.
The studio usually doesn’t open until 10 or 10:30 a.m. The Slime
Fountain is what the kids love to see, and it erupts every 30 minutes
or so (stuff tastes like applesauce from what I’m told — I couldn’t
stomach the idea of trying it). Occasionally Nickelodeon does shoot
here, so if your kids want to be on TV, call % 407-224-4233 to find
out how you can become a contestant or get tickets to a taping.
 Shrek 4-D. In spring 2003, Universal opened this 4-D fractured fairy-
tale based on the hit movie Shrek. A 15-minute show, it can be seen,
heard, felt, and smelled thanks to 3-D film, motion simulators,
OgreVision glasses, and other special effects, including water
spritzers. The attraction picks up where the movie leaves off —
enabling you to join Shrek and Princess Fiona on their honeymoon
(which, predictably, gets interrupted by the evil Lord Farquaad).
Fractured or not, you know this one will have a happy ending, and
it’s similar in style to Disney’s It’s Tough to Be a Bug (see Chapter 15)
and “Honey, I Shrunk the Audience” (see Chapter 14). But, as with all
of the Universal rides, it’s a bit edgier all around. The preshow is one
of the funniest in the park and is as good as the show itself. The
line can stretch for miles — and the show doesn’t accept EXPRESS
passes — but at least you’ll wait under cover from the sun. 
“Awesome! Except the spiders freaked me out,” 10-year-old Austin
giggled. Kids not into sensory effects may get freaked out as well.
This ride can also be rather bumpy, but the front row has station-
ary seats for those who need them.
San Francisco
San Francisco faces the waterfront, and its attractions line The
Embarcadero and Amity Avenue.
 Beetlejuice’s Rock ’n’ Roll Graveyard Revue. Dracula, Wolfman, the
Phantom of the Opera, Frankenstein and his bride, and Beetlejuice
show up to scare you silly. Their funky rock musical has pyrotech-
nic special effects and MTV-style choreography. It’s loud and lively
enough to aggravate some older adults and scare small children,
and it carries Universal’s PG-13 rating. Young teens seem to like it
the most.
 Earthquake — The Big One. Sparks fly shortly after you board a Bay
Area Rapid Transit (better known as BART) train ostensibly running
from San Francisco (the real one) to Oakland. The whopper — 8.3 on
the Richter scale! — hits as you pull into the Embarcadero Station,
and you’re left trapped as vast slabs of concrete collapse around you,
a propane truck bursts into flames, a runaway train comes hurtling
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
266

at you, and the station floods (65,000 gallons of water cascade down
the steps). Prior to the ride, you find out how Earthquake, the Oscar-
winning movie, was made and take a look at a $2.4-million set model.
You then shuffle off to a soundstage where seven adult volunteers
help re-create the big one for you.
 Jaws. As your boat heads into a 7-acre, 5-million-gallon lagoon, an
ominous dorsal fin appears on the horizon (and the blockbuster
film’s famous score starts to run through your brain). What follows
is a series of attacks by a 3-ton, 32-foot-long, mechanical great white
shark that tries to sink its urethane teeth into your hide — or at
least into your boat’s hide. A 30-foot wall of flame caused by burn-
ing fuel surrounds your ride, and you’ll truly feel the heat at this
$45-million attraction. 
The effects of this ride are definitely more startling after dark;
during the day, it’s too easy to see the shark coming. And though
the attraction doesn’t have any height limitations, you may want
to think twice before bringing along the 5-and-younger crowd.
Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone
Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone contains rides and attractions sure to
please the littlest members of your party. When you’re traveling with
young children, plan on spending plenty of time here. Highlights include:
 A Day in the Park with Barney. This musical is Universal’s sadistic
answer to Disney’s It’s a Small World; one of those attractions that
eats the brains and ignites the nerves of anyone but 2- to 6-year-olds
and their loving parents. Set in a parklike theater-in-the-round, this
25-minute musical stars the Purple One, Baby Bop, and BJ. It uses
song, dance, and interactive play to deliver an environmental mes-
sage. This show can be the highlight of your youngster’s day. The
playground next door has chimes to ring, tree houses to explore,
and more.
 E.T. Adventure. You soar with E.T., who is on a mission to save his
ailing planet, through the forest and into space aboard a star-bound
bicycle. You also meet some new characters Steven Spielberg created
for the ride, including Botanicus, Tickli Moot Moot, Horn Flowers,
and Tympani Tremblies. It’s a family-friendly charmer. A cool, wooded
forest serves to create one of the most pleasant waits for any ride
in central Florida, although you have to endure two lines before
you actually make it onto the ride.
 Woody Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster. This ride is the top
attraction in the KidZone, an 8-acre concession Universal Studios
made after being criticized for having too little for young visitors.
Sure, it’s a kiddie coaster, but the Nuthouse Coaster will thrill some
moms and dads, too. Although it’s only 30 feet at its peak, this ride
offers quick, banked turns while you sit in a miniature steam train.
It’s very much like The Barnstormer at Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm in
Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12).
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 267

The ride lasts only 55 seconds, and you can wait as long as 40 min-
utes, but your children probably won’t let you skip it if they see it.
It has a 36-inch height minimum, and kids have to be 48 inches or
taller to ride without an adult.
 More to Do in Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone. Fievel’s Playground
is a wet, western-themed playground with a house to climb and
a small water slide. Curious George Goes to Town has water- and
ball-shooting cannons, plus a huge water tower that empties
(after an alarm), drenching anyone who doesn’t run for cover. 
World Expo
The smallest zone in Universal Studios Florida packs a bunch of punch
in its two rides. World Expo is on Exposition Boulevard, between San
Francisco/Amity and KidZone. The top attractions here are:
 Back to the Future: The Ride. This ride has more warnings than a
centipede has legs. Topping the list, of course: If you have a prob-
lem with motion sickness, don’t get on. If you don’t have a problem
with motion sickness, but do have a problem with other people get-
ting motion sick on you, you may want to invest in one of the rain
ponchos sold at most Universal souvenir stands. (No sense ruining
your new Mickey — um, Barney — shirt, right?) Other warnings are
posted for would-be riders who are pregnant or become dizzy, and
for those who are claustrophobic or have neck, heart, or back prob-
lems. These warnings are all justified.
Back to the Future offers you a chance at time travel in a simulator
made to look like the movie’s famous DeLorean. You are herded
into your car after a video briefing from Dr. Emmett Brown (actor
Christopher Lloyd). Biff the Bully has stolen another DeLorean, and
you have to catch him. The fate of the universe is in your hands.
Along the way, you’ll dive into blazing volcanic tunnels, collide with
Ice Age glaciers, thunder through caves and canyons, and briefly get
swallowed by a dinosaur in an eye-crossing multi-sensory adventure.
You twist, you turn, you dip, you dive — all the while feeling like
you’re really flying. 
“Wow,” Ryan said, adding that he noticed that the taller people
were hitting their heads in the back row. If this describes you,
request one of the front seats that don’t have overhead cover.
By the way, riders must be 40 inches or taller to get aboard.
 Fear Factor Live. Taking center stage at World Expo is the all-new
Fear Factor Live. Based in the hit NBC reality TV show, contestants
(who are actual Universal Studios guests age 18 and older and who
meet certain height, weight, and health restrictions) face some of
their greatest fears in front of thousands of people. They’ll go head
to head with other competitors, each trying to outdo the other in
order to be proclaimed the winner. The wild stunts, similar to what
you’ve seen on the television show, will test both their physical
and emotional limits — not to mention their stomachs. Leave it to
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
268

Universal to be the first to transform a blockbuster reality-TV show
into the hottest new attraction around. 
 Men in Black Alien Attack. You and your mates have to blast the
bug-eyes, or the end of the world may be at hand. You buzz the
streets of New York in six-passenger cruisers, using your “zapper” to
splatter up to 120 bug-eyed targets. You have to contend with return
fire and distractions (noise, clouds of liquid nitrogen, and such), any
of which can send you spinning out of control. Your laser tag–style
gun fires infrared bullets. Earn a bonus by hitting Frank the Pug
(to the right, just past the alien shipwreck). The four-minute ride
relies on 360-degree spins and some scary looking insects rather than
speed for its thrill factor. Near the end, you’re swallowed by a giant
roach (it’s 30 ft. tall with 8-ft. fangs and 20-ft. claws) that explodes —
dousing you with bug guts (actually warm water) — as you blast your
way to safety and into the pest-control hall of fame. After you survive
unscathed (well, maybe a trifle wet), Will Smith rates you anywhere
from a galaxy defender to bug bait. (There are 38 possible scores.) 
Men in Black often has a much shorter line for single riders. If you’re
not alone but are willing to be split up, get in this line and you will
usually be able to hop right on a vehicle that has fewer than six
passengers. 
“I loved blasting those gigantic bugs and the spinning made it
even more fun.” Twelve-year-old Ryan clearly didn’t end up as
bug bait. This $70-million ride-through video game has a 42-inch
height minimum.
Grabbing a Bite to Eat
Universal Studios Florida has more than a dozen places to eat, with
offerings that range from lobster to corn dogs. Quality-wise, things
inside the park are on the same level as those found in the Disney parks
(see Chapters 11–15), meaning that they are generally over-priced for
the quality you receive. Here are our favorites by category:
 Best sit-down meal: Lombard’s Seafood Grille, across from
Earthquake, has a hearty fried clam basket, lobster, steak,
pasta, and burgers ($11–$30).
 Best counter service: Universal Studios’ Classic Monsters Café is
one of the newer eateries in the park and serves salads, pizza, pasta,
and rotisserie chicken ($6–$15). It’s off 7th Avenue near Shrek 4-D.
 Best place for hungry families: Similar to a mall food court, the
International Food and Film Festival offers a variety of food in one
location. With options ranging from stir-fry to fajitas, this is a place
where a family can split up and still eat under one roof. The food is
far from gourmet but a cut above regular fast food ($6–$11). It’s
located near the back of Animal Planet Live! near the lagoon and
the entrance to Back to the Future. 
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 269

 Best places for snacks: Grab a malt ($4) and enjoy the classic atmos-
phere of Mel’s Drive-In, located across from The Universal Horror
Make-up Show. The San Francisco Pastry Co., located across from
Earthquake, has a glass case full of sweet treats, including a large and
decadent chocolate brownie. Brody’s Ice Cream, in Amity near Jaws,
and Schwab’s Pharmacy, about halfway along Hollywood Boulevard,
both offer plenty of ice cream treats to cool you off on a hot day. 
See Chapter 10 for the best places to grab a bite at Universal’s CityWalk.
Shopping at Universal Studios Florida
If Disney can do it, Universal can, too. Most major attractions at Universal
have a theme store attached. Just as at Disney, the prices are high, when
you consider you’re just buying a T-shirt, mug, or whatever. 
More than 25 other shops in the park sell souvenirs ranging from 
I Love Lucy collectibles to Men in Black souvenirs. Be warned, however,
that, unlike WDW, these shops are even more specific to individual
attractions — if you see something you like, buy it. You probably
won’t see it in another store even throughout the park itself. Here’s a
sampling of the more unusual gifts available at some of the Universal
stores:
 Back to the Future — The Store. Real fans of the movie series find
plenty of intriguing stuff here. One of the more interesting is a minia-
ture version of the Back to the Future DeLorean.
 E.T.’s Toy Closet and Photo Spot. This is the place for plush, stuffed
animals, including a replica of the alien namesake.
 MIB Gear. Clothes, T-shirts, and everything else the well-dressed
alien should own. Oh, and the cool shades that are the staple of the
Men in Black uniform.
 Quint’s Surf Shack. This is the place to go if you plan on hanging
ten in the future. It’s got all of the latest surfing apparel.
 Sahara Traders. A wide range of Egyptian-themed items and
Revenge of the Mummy souvenirs near, you guessed it, the
Mummy ride.
 Silver Screen Collectibles. Fans of I Love Lucy will adore the small
variety of collector dolls. There’s also a Betty Boop line. And how
can you pass up a Bates Motel shower curtain? 
 Universal Studios Store. This store, near the entrance, sells just
about everything when it comes to Universal apparel. It’s also the
spot to pick up your packages if you’ve had them delivered from
another store.

 Taking home souvenirs
U
niversal’s second theme park opened in 1999 with a vibrantly 
colored, cleverly themed collection of edgy, fast, and fun rides.
Heart-pounding roller coasters thunder above (and, in one case, dives
below) its pedestrian walkways, water rides careen through the center
of the park, and uniquely themed restaurants are camouflaged to match
their surroundings, adding to your overall immersion in the various
“islands” in this adventure.
From the wobbly angles and day-glo colors of Seuss Island to the lush
foliage and distant rumblings of gigantic beasts in Jurassic Park, Universal
does an incredible job of differentiating between the various islands.
As if you’ve been transported through a portal, each island completely
envelops you in its theme, and within only steps, you’ve no idea any of
the other islands exist. Navigation is far easier than at its sister park
(Universal Studios Florida) where the studio’s sets often times blend
together, making it difficult to tell when you’ve left New York and entered
San Francisco. At Islands of Adventure, almost the entire park, save the
Port of Entry, surrounds the central sea. Between each island, a simple
walkway creates a bridge from one island to the next.
This billion dollar park is divided into six islands; beginning with the
Port of Entry, you find a marketplace filled with shops, bazaars, and
eateries all occupying a street designed to recall ancient far off lands
and exotic ports of call. The remaining islands include: Seuss Landing,
where you feel as if you’ve jumped into the pages of the good Doctor’s
whimsical classic tales; The Lost Continent, which combines mythical
and mystical enchantments; Jurassic Park, where you enter through a
massive stone gateway, are surrounded by towering dense foliage, and
can hear the rumblings of gigantic prehistoric beasts off in the distance;

Toon Lagoon, which takes you on an amusing lighthearted stroll through
the classic Sunday comic strips of the past; and Marvel Super Hero
Island, where super heroes and their arch nemeses jump off the pages of
comic books to entertain and impress with their super powers. Each of
the islands is listed in further detail throughout this chapter. 
Islands of Adventure boasts an incredible collection of thrill rides and
coasters, with a more modest selection of play areas and somewhat tamer
rides for younger adventurers. It’s unquestionably the best park in town
for tweens, teens, and adrenaline junkies. The trade-off is that the park
features only a few shows and stage productions.
Knowing Essential Park Information
Before you embark on your journey through the park’s rides and attrac-
tions, here are some mundane matters that you may need to know.
Buying tickets and making reservations
You can choose from several ticket options and tours: 
 A one-day ticket costs $60 (plus 6.5 percent sales tax) for adults,
$48 for children 3 to 9. 
 A two-day, two-park, bonus pass is $100 for adults and kids alike,
with kids younger than the age of 3 admitted free. These passes
enable you to move between Islands of Adventure and Universal
Studios Florida (see Chapter 18) throughout the day so you can go
back and forth whenever you like. Note: For a limited time, if you
buy your bonus pass online (www.universalorlando.com), you
get 2 more days for free, for a total of 4 consecutive days of admis-
sion. Bonus passes also give you free access at night to select
CityWalk clubs (see Chapter 25). 
 Annual Passes (the Preferred Annual Pass and the Power Pass)
allow entry to the park for an entire year (some blackout dates
apply to the Power Pass; there are no blackout dates with the
Preferred Annual Pass) The cost is $180 and $120 respectively.
For more details check out www.universalorlando.com.
 The FlexTicket multiday, multipark option is the most economical
way to see the various “other-than-Disney” parks. You pay one price
to visit any and all of the participating parks during a 14-day period.
A four-park pass to Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios Florida,
Wet ’n Wild, and SeaWorld is $185 for adults and $151 for children 3
to 9. A five-park pass, which adds Busch Gardens in Tampa, is $225
for adults and $190 for kids. You can order the FlexTicket by calling
% 407-363-8000 or online by going to www.universalorlando.com.
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 273

 Islands of Adventure offers five-hour, guided VIP tours for $100 per
person for just Islands of Adventure, $125 per person for a two-park,
six-hour tour that also includes Universal Studios Florida. Guided
tours include line-cutting privileges and preferred seating at several
attractions, and they start at 10 a.m. and noon daily. For more infor-
mation on the VIP tour, call % 407-363-8295. Note that the price of
the VIP tour includes neither the 6.5 percent sales tax nor admission
to the park!
The park prices are not the only place you’ll wish you’d left your wallet
behind. Expect to spend upwards of around $2.50 for a coke, $1.80 for a
cup of coffee, about $5 for a beer, $2.60 for popcorn, and $2.50 for bot-
tled water. However, you can save 10 percent on your purchases at any
gift shop or on a meal by showing your AAA (American Automobile
Association) card. This discount isn’t available at food or merchandise
carts. Likewise, tobacco, candy, film, collectibles, and sundry items
aren’t included in discounts.
For information about new travel packages and theme-park information,
call % 800-711-0080 or 800-224-4233; write to Guest Services at Universal
Studios Florida, 1000 Universal Studios Plaza, Orlando, FL 32819-7601; or
visit its Web site, www.universalorlndo.com. Once you’re at the park,
just head over to Guest Services.
Universal Orlando’s Islands of Adventure is about half a mile north of I-4’s
Kirkman Road/Highway 435 exit. You may find construction in the area,
so keep an eye out for the road signs directing you to Universal Orlando.
Islands of Adventure is open 365 days a year, generally from at least
9 a.m. to 6 or 7 p.m. Closing hours vary seasonally with peak season and
holiday hours extended later into the evening, with special activities
inside the park often extending the hours as well. For example, during
Halloween Horror Nights, which is celebrated at both parks, the park
closes around 5 p.m., reopens at around 7 p.m. (with a new admission fee),
and remains open until at least midnight.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATMs. You can find machines accepting cards from banks using the
Cirrus, STAR, and Plus systems outside and to the right of the park’s
entrance and in The Lost Continent near the bridge to Jurassic Park.
 Baby-changing and nursing facilities. Diaper-changing stations are
located in all the restrooms. You can find nursing facilities at the
family services located in the Guest Services building at the Port of
Entry, but they don’t sell any infant or toddler supplies like dia-
pers, formula, or pacifiers, so make sure you come prepared with
enough provisions.

Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 275

 Cameras and film. Buy film and disposable cameras at De Foto’s
Expedition Photography, inside the main entrance to the right.
Digital supplies are rather limited.
 Universal has its own version of Disney’s FASTPASS, called Universal
EXPRESS. The system operates much the same as Disney’s does.
You feed your admission ticket into the machine at the EXPRESS
Distribution Center for a given ride (they’re usually located close to
the entrance of rides that accept EXPRESS passes), and you get a
second pass (along with your park ticket) stamped with a designated
time window in which you can return to ride. At any time within
the window, you can head straight for the shorter EXPRESS line
(usually no more than 15 minutes) and off you go. You can only get
one EXPRESS pass at a time, but like at Disney, you can get a second
pass just two hours after the first one is issued — the time you can
obtain the next EXPRESS pass is printed right on the first pass.
If you’re not willing to chance that there will be an EXPRESS pass
left (and they do run out, sometimes as early as noon during peak
periods) you can purchase the Universal EXPRESS Plus Pass option.
It allows access to the Express line at each and every attraction
that accepts the Universal EXPRESS Pass without having to contin-
ually obtain separate passes or wait for any time limits to expire
before heading to a Universal EXPRESS line at the next attraction.
The price varies with the season, and I have seen prices as high as
$39 during peak periods. In addition, it is only good for one day at
one park, regardless of what type of park tickets you hold, and it
can only be used once at each of the attractions.
 Universal offers a separate line-beating option to visitors staying at
any of the three Universal resorts. All guests of the Portofino Bay,
Hard Rock, and Royal Pacific hotels have to do is show their room
keys to get at or near the front of the line for most of the rides and
even most of the restaurants.
 You can find first aid centers just inside and to the right of the main
entrance in the Port of Entry as well as in The Lost Continent, across
from Oasis Coolers.
 Rent lockers for $8 and $10 a day plus a $2 refundable deposit
across from Guest Services, near the main entrance. Lockers are a
smart place to keep valuables you might lose on the wilder rides,
and Islands of Adventure even provides lockers near the entrances
to The Hulk, Dueling Dragons, and the Jurassic Park River Adventure;
the first 45 minutes are free and every hour thereafter is $2 (with a
$14 max). 
 Lost children. If you lose a child, grab the nearest staff member,
and he or she will direct you to the “found children” area, usually
the Guest Services or Security area. Make children younger than 7
wear name-tags inside their clothing for easy identification.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
276

 Parking. If you park in the multilevel garages, be sure to write down
the level, character, row, and space number so you can find your car
later. Parking costs $9 for cars and trucks. Valet parking is available
for $16. If you arrive after 6 p.m., parking is free. Universal’s garages
are connected to its parks by walkways and a series of moving side-
walks; reaching the gates can take a while. 
 Car assistance. If you need assistance with your car, raise the hood
and tell any parking attendant your location, or use the call boxes
located throughout the garage to call for security. The park provides
battery jumps for free.
 Pet care. You can leave your small animals at the shelter in the park-
ing garages for $10 a day (no overnight stays), but you’ll have to
feed and walk them throughout the day. Ask the parking attendant
to direct you to the kennel.
 Strollers. Look to the left as you enter the park through the turnstiles.
Stroller rental costs $10 for a single, $16 for a double, tax included. 
 Wheelchairs. You can rent wheelchairs for $12 per day in the parking
garage concourse. Electric wheelchairs are $40 per day. Both require
a $50 deposit and a signed rental agreement. Prices include taxes.
Practical Advice for Island Adventurers
If you want to get the most out of your adventure, you would do well
to keep the following tips in mind when you’re exploring the Islands
of Adventure:
 Short visitors. Of the 14 major rides at Islands of Adventure, 13 of
them have minimum-height restrictions between 40 and 54 inches.
You can find a child-swap service at all major attractions, enabling
you or your partner to ride while the other watches over your tikes,
but sitting in a waiting room isn’t much fun for them. Take your
child’s height into consideration before visiting the park, or consider
splitting up for part of the day. Islands has actually a few great play
areas that will keep younger kids entertained while older kids and
parents ride some of the wilder rides.
In July 2000, Universal added two notable attractions to its lineup
as an answer to criticism that Islands of Adventure had too little for
young guests. The Flying Unicorn is a small roller coaster that trav-
els through a mythical forest. (It’s comparable to The Barnstormer
at Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm in Disney’s Magic Kingdom, Chapter 12,
and Woody Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster at Universal Studios
Florida, Chapter 18, though it still has plenty of zip.) Storm Force is
a spinning attraction in which guests help the X-Men’s Storm harness
the weather to fight her archenemy, Magneto. It’s a bit wilder and
definitely edgier in its theme than the Tea Cups at Magic Kingdom
(Chapter 12), but the idea’s the same. 
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 277

 Jittery or health-restricted visitors. See the preceding note about
short visitors and add the warning that height isn’t the only limit-
ing factor. If you’re pregnant, prone to dizziness or motion sickness,
or have heart, back, or other health problems, this may not be the
best choice of parks for you. Consider heading to a tamer park, like
Disney’s Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12), Disney’s Animal Kingdom
(see Chapter 15), Disney’s Epcot (see Chapter 13), and Disney–MGM
Studios (see Chapter 14), SeaWorld (see Chapter 20), or even
Universal Studios Florida (see Chapter 18).
 Cruising the Islands. If you hauled your stroller on your vacation,
bring it to the park. The walk from your car is a long one, through
the parking garage and the entertainment district’s CityWalk,
before you get to the attractions. Carrying a young child and all
their accompanying paraphernalia, even on moving sidewalks,
can make the long trek seem even longer.
 Beat the heat. Several rides have lengthy pathways outside that
offer no cover to protect you from the sizzling Florida sun. Bring
some bottled water with you for the long waits (a bottle that costs
$2.50 here is less than $1 in the outside world) or take a sip from
fountains placed in the waiting areas. Alcohol is more readily avail-
able at this park than at Disney, so remember that liquor, roller
coasters, and sweltering heat can make for a very messy mix.
Exploring the Top Attractions 
at Islands of Adventure
Islands of Adventure features more than 20 rides and attractions, as well
as numerous uniquely-themed restaurants and shops, all surrounding
its central sea. (It’s similar in layout of the World Showcase at Epcot,
Chapter 13.) 
See the “Islands of Adventure” map on page 275 to locate all the attrac-
tions in the sections that follow.
Port of Entry
Beyond the gigantic, crumbling-stone archway you’ll find the Port’s numer-
ous souvenir shops, bazaars, and eateries lining the exotic streetscape.
Save this area for last, spending only a few minutes now to take in your
surroundings, as the architecture and attention to detail is striking. I sug-
gest you begin your adventure just beyond the second stone archway
by heading to either Seuss Landing (to the right) or Marvel Super Hero
Island (to the left). Your direction will likely be determined by the age of
your children, or whether you’re willing to start out by riding one of the
most intense and thrilling rides in the entire park. 
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
278

Seuss Landing
Within these 10 fanciful acres you step onto the pages of Dr. Seuss’ clas-
sic tales, complete with Seussian signature color swirls and whimsical
architecture and a cast of classic characters. The main attractions in
Seuss Landing are aimed at the younger set, although anyone who loved
the good Doctor as a child will enjoy some nostalgic fun.
 Caro-Seuss-El. This not-so-ordinary carousel replaces the tradi-
tional wooden horses with seven whimsical Seussian characters
(a total of 54 mounts), including Cowfish, the elephant birds from
Horton Hatches an Egg, and Mulligatawnies. They move up and
down and in and out. Pull the reins to make their eyes blink or
heads bob.
This ride has a rocking-chariot platform and a wheelchair-loading
system that makes it a fun attraction for guests with disabilities.
 The Cat in the Hat. All aboard the couch! In this case, the couches
are six-passenger futons that steer you through 18 silly scenes,
retelling the tale of a day gone terribly south. Seuss fans will rec-
ognize the giant candy-striped hat looming over the entrance as
well as the chaotic journey itself. The ride’s highlight is a revolving
24-foot tunnel that alters your perceptions and leaves you feeling a
bit woozy.
 “It’s just not very fast and the Cat in the Hat is a little-kids’ story,”
was 12-year-old Ryan’s verdict. The Cat in the Hat is one of the 
signature “young” experiences of Islands of Adventure, and
because of this, you — as well as your older children — may 
find it a bit tame. Small children may be slightly frightened by 
pop-up characters, although most kids ages 4 to 7 will find it a
winner.
 If I Ran the Zoo. At this small interactive play area, kids can dodge
flying water snakes and tickle the toes of a Seussian creature. The
area is filled with 19 play stations that include slides, wheels to spin,
caves to explore, and other things geared to burning off some of the
excited energy of tinier tots. Just plan on them getting wet, as that’s
half the fun.
 One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. You move “up, up, up”
and “down, down, down” on this attraction, where you ride in a
funky flying fish whose controls enable you to ascend or descend
15 feet as you spin around on an arm attached to a hub (much
like Magic Kingdom’s Magic Carpets of Aladdin, see Chapter 12).
Watch out for squirt posts, which spray unsuspecting riders who
don’t follow along with the ride’s little rhyme (and sometimes even
the ones who do follow it).
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 279

Marvel Super Hero Island
Thrill-ride junkies love the twisting, turning, stomach-churning rides on
this island. The streets are filled with giant-sized murals of Marvel Super
Heroes, making you feel as if you’ve stepped onto the pages of a gigantic
comic book. The larger-than-life scenery was created using a special
effect that mimics Marvel’s style. The hard rockin’ music here is loud;
definitely a reflection of the island’s overall personality. 
 The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. This primo ride combines
moving vehicles, 3-D action, and an array of special effects themed
around the original web master. The script: While you’re on a ho-hum
tour of the Daily Bugle newspaper — yikes! — the boys in black hats
(Doc Oc, Hobgoblin, and the rest of the Sinister Syndicate) filch the
Statue of Liberty. You have to help Spidey get it back. Unlike the
many roller coasters and stationary motion simulators in Orlando,
this ride offers a unique experience. Passengers squeal as real and
computer-generated objects alternately fly toward their 12-person
cars, which plunge and spin through a comic-book universe. A sim-
ulated 400-foot drop feels an awful lot like the real thing.
Expectant mothers or those with heart, neck, or back problems
shouldn’t ride The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. For those
who can, know that lines here can get ridiculously long, so use
Universal EXPRESS, or, if you don’t mind splitting up your party,
use the single-rider line when it’s available.
“This was the coolest ride ever!” exclaimed Austin, age 10. Ryan
(age 12) echoed that sentiment, adding, “You gotta do this one
a couple times at least!” Dark scenes, the motion of the car, the 
in-your-face 3-D effects and the simulated motion make this ride
unsuitable for extremely young kids and even some preteens.
Most of the rest of you will probably want to give it another spin —
a number of Universal employees rate it the best in the park (and
my ride-addicted editor thinks it’s the best in town). Keep in mind
that you can close your eyes if a scene is too intense, as the motion
of the car, without the combined effects, isn’t overwhelming by itself.
There’s a 40-inch height minimum.
 Doctor Doom’s Fearfall. Look! Up in the sky! It’s a bird, it’s a
plane . . . uh, it’s you falling 200 feet if you’re courageous enough to
climb aboard. This towering metal skeleton provides screams that
you can hear far into the day and night. The plot: You’re touring a
lab when — are you sensing a theme here? — something goes hor-
ribly wrong as supervillain Doctor Doom tries to drain you of fear
in order to power his latest evil scheme. You’re fired to the top of
the ride (pulling 4Gs in the process), with feet dangling, and then
dropped in intervals, leaving your stomach at several levels.
If you’re an expectant mother or you experience heart, neck, or back
problems, you shouldn’t ride Doctor Doom’s Fearfall. Make sure all
items are secured well — or better yet, give them to someone not
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
280

riding for safe keeping. Plenty of riders have ended up watching their
sunglasses fly off into the wild blue yonder upon lift off. Minimum
height is 52 inches. Though it’s actually less nightmarish than the
Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (see Chapter 14), I recommend kids
be a minimum 10 years of age before even attempting this one.
 Incredible Hulk Coaster. Bruce Banner is working in his lab
when — yes, again — something goes wrong. This coaster rockets
from a dark tunnel into the sunlight, while accelerating from 0 to
40 mph in two seconds. Universal’s scriptwriters insist that it has
the same thrust as an F-16. Although it’s only two-thirds the speed
of Disney–MGM’s Rock ’n’ Rollercoaster, this ride is in broad day-
light, and you can see the asphalt! After you’re launched, you spin
upside down 128 feet from the ground, feel weightless, and careen
through the center of the park over the heads of other visitors.
If you’re a coaster lover, you’ll be pleased to know that this ride,
which lasts 2 minutes and 15 seconds, includes seven rollovers and
two deep drops. As a nice touch, the 32-passenger metal coaster
glows green at night. The ride is surprisingly smooth, making it
much more comfortable than coasters that are far less intense. 
Expectant mothers or those with heart, neck, or back problems
shouldn’t ride. I’ve seen people ignore the warnings, only to turn
the same shade as the coaster. This is also another one where you
should heed warnings to store all loose items in a locker before you
get on . . . or finding your car at the end of the day may become a
moot point when your car keys go flying.
Mixed reviews for this “monster” of a coaster from my young
reviewers. “No way. Uh-uh, you go upside down — you won’t even
get me on it,” were 12-year-old Ryan’s final words on the subject. 
But Nicolas (age 8) and Austin (age 10) both said it was “the
most amazing roller coaster ever — you think you’re going to hit
the pavement, but then you don’t — it’s fast and really smooth.”
From another coaster crazy — this one an adult — who rides
them all (and I mean all), he felt it was one of the best he had ever
ridden, mostly because it was so smooth. This is another ride that
I think is best for riders 10 to 12 years and older. Riders must be at
least 54 inches tall to climb aboard.
 Storm Force Accelatron. This ride is a 22nd-century version of
Magic Kingdom’s Mad Tea Party and its spinning teacups. While
aboard, you and the X-Men’s superheroine, Storm, try to defeat the
evil Magneto. To do that, you need to spin faster and faster to give
the mistress of weather a little boost in the energy department. In
addition to some upset stomachs, your motion creates a thunder-
storm of sound and light, which gives Storm all the power she
needs to blast Magneto. Some young kids (5 and under) may find
the characters, lights, and sounds a bit too intense.
This ride is closed during some off-peak periods.
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 281

Toon Lagoon
More than 150 life-size sculpted cartoon images — characters range
from Betty Boop and Flash Gordon to Bullwinkle and Cathy — let you
know you’ve entered an island dedicated to your favorites from the
Sunday funnies.
 Dudley Do-Right’s Ripsaw Falls. The heroic Dudley stars on this
adrenaline-pumping, splashy flume ride that drops 75 feet at 50 mph.
Your mission is to save the fair Nell from Snidely Whiplash. The boats
take you around a 400,000-gallon lagoon and plunge you 15 feet below
the water’s surface, but this is mainly hype — the waters is contained
on either side of you. That said, you will get very wet anyway. Though
it beats out Splash Mountain (see Chapter 12) in the adrenaline
department, the latter offers better effects and a nicer atmosphere. 
Expectant mothers or people with heart, neck, or back problems
shouldn’t ride this attraction. It has a 44-inch height minimum. Tall
folks should note that the boats on this ride offer legroom on par
with that in an airline’s coach section.
 Me Ship, The Olive. This three-story boat offers dozens of interac-
tive activities. Kids can toot whistles, clang bells, or play the organ.
Sweet Pea’s Playpen is a favorite of younger guests. Kids 6 and older
love Cargo Crane, where they can use water cannons to drench riders
on Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges (see the following bullet). 
 Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges. Here’s another water special —
a churning, turning, twisting, listing raft ride with the same kind
of vehicle as Kali River Rapids at Disney’s Animal Kingdom (see
Chapter 15), but this one’s a bit faster and bouncier (though not
nearly as scenic). You’ll get wet from mechanical devices and from
the water cannons fired by guests at Me Ship, The Olive (see the
preceding bullet). The 12-passenger rafts bump and dip their way
along a course lined with villains, including Bluto and Sea Hag.
“That water is freezing, but it really feels good when it’s hot, and I
loved bouncing up and down on the waves.” Nic’s right; the water
is c-c-cold, which is a blessing on hot summer days but less so in
January, and trust me — you can get completely soaked. Riders
must be at least 42 inches tall to ride.
 Along Kings Row and Comic Strip Lane you’ll find Beetle Bailey,
Dudley, and plenty of other classic comic characters out and about. 
Jurassic Park
All the basics from Steven Spielberg’s wildly successful films (you’ll hear
the score from the movies pretty much everywhere you go), and some
of the high-tech wizardry, are incorporated into this lushly landscaped
locale, which includes a replica of the visitor’s center from the movie
and one of the best themed attractions in the park.
 Camp Jurassic. This amazingly entertaining prehistoric play area,
designed along the same lines as The Boneyard in Disney’s Animal
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
282

Kingdom (see Chapter 15), has everything from lava pits with
dinosaur bones to amber mines to a tropical rain forest where the
bushes occasionally rustle and you can hear dinosaurs off in the
distance. Watch out for the spitters that often lurk in the dark caves.
The multilevel area offers plenty of places for kids to climb, crawl,
explore, and wear down their batteries eventually. 
While there’s only one way in and out of this attraction, keep a
close eye on young children because it’s easy to get lost inside
the caverns.
 Jurassic Park Discovery Center. Inside this air-conditioned spot,
you can relax for the moment while you and your kids discover
something new. The center has life-size dinosaur replicas, including
a massive skeleton, a handful of interactive games, including a
sequencer that lets you combine your DNA with a dinosaur’s, and the
Beasaur exhibit, where you can see and hear as the dinosaurs did.
You can also play the game show You Bet Jurassic (bet you wouldn’t
see an attraction name like this at Disney), watch a tiny Velociraptor
“hatch” in the lab, and turn your voice into a dinosaur screech. 
Austin (10), Nicolas (8), and Hailey (6) all give this one high marks,
but because there are a limited number of interactive stations, this
attraction can consume a lot of time on busy days.
 Jurassic Park River Adventure. Your adventure cruise begins
slowly but soon throws you into a world of jungle plants and stormy
skies, where you literally come face-to-face with five-story “breathing”
inhabitants of Jurassic Park. At one point, a Tyrannosaurus rex
decides you look like a tasty morsel; at another, spitters launch
venom your way. To escape, you take a breathtaking 85-foot plunge
in a flume that’s steep and quick enough to lift your fanny from the
seat. (When Spielberg rode it, he made them stop the ride and let him
out before the plunge.) Oh, yeah — you’ll get soaked. If you can only
stomach the thought of getting on one flume ride at Islands, make it
this one — both the atmosphere and comfort level far exceed that
of Dudley Do-Right’s Ripsaw Falls.
“That was amazing — the dinosaurs looked real and the waterfall
at the end was fun!” Austin could have gone back for more, though
people with height issues may not be as happy. Ryan on the other 
hand said “the drop at the end was definitely too long and way, way
too steep.” Riders must be at least 42 inches tall.
 Pteranodon Flyers. The line for this one is simply ridiculous! For
an 80 second ride, neat as it may be, you’ll often wait up to an hour,
sometimes more. This high-flying ride swings from side-to-side and,
unlike traditional gondolas in sky rides, on Pteranodon Flyers, your
feet dangle free from a two-seat skeletal flyer with little more than a
restraining belt between you and the ground. Now that I’ve scared
you, this is a kiddie ride — single passengers must be between 36
and 56 inches; adults can ride only when accompanying someone
that size. For what it’s worth, I wouldn’t put my young squirmers
on it even if the wait weren’t so long.
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 283

The Lost Continent
Universal has created a foreboding mood in this section of the park,
whose entrance is marked by menacing stone griffins and fire-lit torches.
This uniquely themed area combines various mythical and mystical 
elements, including ancient Greek gods, crumbling ruins, and medieval
magicians and a magical forest. 
 Dueling Dragons. This ride has a scream factor of 11 on a 
10-point scale. True coaster crazies love this intertwined set of 
leg-dangling racers that climb to 125 feet, invert five times, and,
on three occasions, come within only 12 inches of each other as
the two dragons battle it out; you prove your bravery by tagging
along. The Fire Dragon can reach speeds of up to 60 mph, while the
Ice Dragon makes it to only 55 mph. It, of course, comes with the
usual health warnings.
For the best ride, try to get one of the two outside seats in each
row. Also, pay attention because the lines for both coasters split
near the loading dock so that daredevils can claim the very first
row, which many hard-core thrill junkies claim offers the city’s 
ultimate adrenaline rush. And, yes, that line is even longer!
“That was so scary — but so, so cool.” Austin barely took time to
give his review as he headed back for another battle. After riding
it several times, he added, “The best seat is the front seat on Ice.”
You shouldn’t ride this ride if you’re an expectant mother or if you
have heart, neck, or back problems. (Why aren’t you surprised?)
Riders must be at least 54 inches tall.
 The Eighth Voyage of Sindbad. The mythical sailor Sindbad is the
star of a stunt demonstration that includes six water explosions
and 50 pyrotechnic effects, which includes a 10-foot circle of flames.
It doesn’t, however, come close to the quality of the Indiana Jones
stunt show at Disney–MGM Studios (see Chapter 14), and some of
the characters are far scarier for young kids.
 The Flying Unicorn. This small roller coaster is similar to Woody
Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster at Universal Studios Florida (see
Chapter 18) and The Barnstormer at Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm in Magic
Kingdom (see Chapter 12). That means a fast, corkscrew run sure
to earn squeals, but probably not at the risk of someone losing their
lunch. The ride travels through a mythical forest next to Dueling
Dragons. Younger kids love it, but riders must be at least 36 inches
tall. I’d have them watch for a few minutes before they commit to
getting on.
 The Mystic Fountain. This interactive smart fountain delights
younger guests. It can see, hear, and spit water, leading to plenty of
kibitzing with those who stand before the stone fountain, suitably
named Rocky. (A staff member viewing the action through cameras
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
284

is at the helm, which makes for a personable experience.) It’s a real
treat for 3- to 8-year-olds.
 Poseidon’s Fury. Clearly, Poseidon’s Fury is the park’s best show, but
that may be a backhanded compliment because it’s one of the park’s
only shows. It exposes you to fire and water in the same manner that
Earthquake does at Universal Studios Florida. You pass through a
42-foot vortex — where 17,500 gallons of water swirl around you,
barrel-style — and then get a front-row seat at a battle royale, where
Zeus and Poseidon hurl 25-foot fireballs at each other. However, some
of the special effects are not up to the usual Universal standards. If
the line is short, I recommend that you check it out, but if the lines
are long, as is often the case, it’s not worth waiting for. 
Children younger than 7 may find the flaming fireballs, explosive
sounds, and rushing water a little too intense. Also, if you wear
eye glasses, take them off before you walk through the water
vortex or they will fog up completely and you won’t see much of
anything. 
Dining at Islands of Adventure
After riding rides and visiting attractions, you’re probably hungry. You
can get a quick bite to eat at a number of stands in the park, as well as a
handful of full-service restaurants — any and all of which are well above
the standards at most other theme-park eateries. The park’s creators
have taken some extra care to tie in restaurant offerings with the theme
of the island they’re in. For example, the Green Eggs and Ham Cafe in
Seuss Landing may be one of the few places on Earth where you’re will-
ing to eat tinted huevos. (They’re sold in the form of an egg-and-ham
sandwich for $6.)
 Best sit-down restaurant. At Mythos Restaurant in The Lost
Continent, diners are transported to a mythical underwater world.
This upscale restaurant offers selections ranging from wood-fired
oven pizzas, burgers, and simple bowls of greens, to elaborate
entrees of fish, seafood, and steaks. You can dine here without a
park ticket, however there’s a time limit and you need to leave a
credit-card number at the gate. If you’re running late, the restaurant
can call the gate to let them know so you won’t be charged. This
restaurant is best suited for adults, although older kids may be
okay. Entrees range from $10 to $24. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to
park closing.
 Best atmosphere for adults. Also in The Lost Continent, The
Enchanted Oak Tavern (and Alchemy Bar) looks like a mam-
moth tree from the outside; the interior is brightened by a blue 
skylight with a celestial theme. The tables and chairs are thick
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 285

planks, and the servers are clad like wenches. Try the chicken/
rib combo with waffle fries for $13. You can also choose from
45 brands of beer.
 Best atmosphere for kids. The fun never stops under the big top at
Circus McGurkus Cafe Stoo-pendous in Seuss Landing, where ani-
mated trapeze artists swing from the ceiling. Kids’ meals, including
a souvenir cup, are $6 to $7. The adult menu features fried chicken,
lasagna, spaghetti, and pizza. Try the fried chicken platter for $8 or
the lasagna for $7.
 Best vegetarian fare. Fire-Eater’s Grill, located in The Lost
Continent, is a fast-food stand that offers a tasty veggie falafel
for $6. You can also get a tossed salad for about $4.
 Best diversity. Comic Strip Cafe, located in Toon Lagoon, is a four-
in-one, counter service–style eatery offering burgers, Chinese food,
Mexican food, and pizza and pasta ($6–$9).
You can also find several restaurants (see Chapter 10) and clubs
(see Chapter 25) just a short walk from Islands of Adventure at the
new entertainment complex, CityWalk. If you get your hand stamped,
you can leave the park and return after eating.
Shopping at Islands of Adventure
The park’s 20-something shops have plenty of theme merchandise.
You may want to check out Cats, Hats & Things and Dr. Seuss’ All the
Books You Can Read for special Seussian material. Jurassic Outfitters
offers an array of stuffed and plastic dinos, plus safari-style clothing.
If you’re a superhero fan, check out The Marvel Alterverse Store.
Remember that you may find theme- or character-specific merchandise
in only one store. Here’s a sample of some of the more unusual wares
available:
 Betty Boop Store. You name it, this store in Toon Lagoon has her
famous mug on it.
 Spider-Man Shop. This shop specializes in its namesake’s para-
phernalia, including red Spidey caps covered with black webs
and denim jackets with logos.
 Toon Extra. Where else can you buy a miniature stuffed Mr. Peanut
beanbag chair, an Olive Oyl and Popeye frame, or a stuffed Beetle
Bailey?
 Historic Families. Here’s your chance to get your own coat of arms
made in a shop that looks just like King Arthur’s armory. It’s a must
for the knight wannabe.

 Exploring Discovery Cove
 Deciding where to eat and shop
W
hile I have always included SeaWorld on my must-see list of parks,
not everyone gives it the chance it deserves. This modern, marine-
adventure park focuses more on discovery than on thrill rides, but it
offers its share of excitement with Journey to Atlantis, a steep flume-like
ride, and the thundering Kraken, a floorless roller coaster. SeaWorld’s
more than 200 acres of educational fun features stars such as Shamu and
his expanding family of performing killer whales, polar bears Klondike
and Snow, and a supporting cast of seals, sea lions, manatees, penguins,
dolphins, walruses, and more. You can also feed some nonperforming
critters and feel the crushed-velvet texture of a gentle ray in various
pools throughout the park — something Disney and Universal just
don’t offer.
SeaWorld’s sister park, Discovery Cove, opened in summer 2000. It lets
guests swim with a dolphin in an adventure that, at $229 to $259 per
person (plus 6.5 percent sales tax), goes off the price chart; you can
also just swim with the fishes for a lower, though still stiff, ticket price
of $129 to $159. The payoff is that you only have to share the park with
999 other people, not the tens of thousands you find at the other parks.
A day here offers a tranquil and relaxing experience where you can sit in
the sand or swim with the sea life — a refreshing way to spend the day
in Orlando. 
In this chapter, I tell you all you need to know to make the most out of
SeaWorld and Discovery Cove.

Gathering Important SeaWorld Information
Before I start wading through the park’s attractions and shows, here are
some helpful, though possibly mundane, matters that you may find help-
ful to know.
Buying tickets and making reservations
You have a couple different options when buying your tickets at SeaWorld.
A one-day ticket costs $60 for adults, $48 for kids 3 to 9 (plus 6.5 percent
sales tax). Buy your tickets online to avoid long lines and save 10 percent
off the regular admission price. SeaWorld sometimes offers online specials,
such as a second day free.
If you’re planning to see a number of non-Disney parks during your stay,
consider the FlexTicket. This pass enables you to pay one price to visit
any of the participating parks during a 14-day period. A four-park pass to
Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure, Wet ’n Wild, and SeaWorld
is $185 for adults and $151 for children 3 to 9. A five-park pass, which
adds Busch Gardens in Tampa, is $225 for adults and $190 for kids. You
can order the FlexTicket through SeaWorld by calling % 407-351-3600 or
heading to www.seaworld.com on the Web.
SeaWorld’s Adventure Express Tour ($89 for adults and $79 for kids 3–9
plus park admission fees) is a six-hour guided excursion that includes
front-of-the-line access to Kraken, Journey to Atlantis, and Wild Arctic;
reserved seating at two animal shows; lunch; and a chance to touch or
feed penguins, dolphins, sting rays, and sea lions. It’s the only way to
dodge park lines. SeaWorld doesn’t have an equivalent to FASTPASS or
Universal EXPRESS, although its lines aren’t nearly as long as the ones at
Disney and Universal parks. Advanced reservations are recommended
for this tour and can be made by calling % 800-406-2244.
Additionally, you have three one-hour tour options: Polar Expedition
Guided Tour (touch a penguin), Predators (touch a shark!), and Saving
a Species (see manatees and sea turtles). Each tour costs $16 for adults
and $12 for kids 3 to 9 (plus park admission fees) and you have to sign
up for them at the Information Center just inside the park’s entrance.
Call % 800-406-2244 or 407-351-3600 for information.
To gather park information before you leave home, write to SeaWorld
Guest Services at 7007 SeaWorld Dr., Orlando, FL 32801; call % 407-351-
3600; or visit www.seaworld.com. Once inside the park, head for the
Information Center, which is on your left as you enter the park.
If you’re arriving on I-4, just look for the signs pointing the way to the
SeaWorld exit. You also can reach it on International Drive. (It’s located
on the southern third of I-Drive.)
Chapter 20: SeaWorld & Discovery Cove 289

The park usually is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., 365 days a year, and later
during summer and holidays.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATMs. You can find an ATM machine that accepts cards from banks
using the Cirrus, STAR, and Plus systems at the front of the park,
near Atlantis Bayside Stadium, and across from the Sea Lion & Otter
Stadium near the Friends of the Wild gift shop.
 Baby-changing and nursing stations. Changing tables are in or near
most women’s restrooms and at the men’s restroom at the front
entrance near Shamu’s Emporium. You can buy diapers in machines
located near all changing areas and at Shamu’s Emporium. Likewise,
a special area for nursing mothers is located near the women’s rest-
room at Friends of the Wild gift shop, near the center of the park.
 Cameras and film. You can purchase film and disposable cameras
at stores throughout SeaWorld, although digital supplies are limited. 
 First aid center. Registered nurses staff centers behind Stingray
Lagoon and near Shamu’s Happy Harbor.
 Lockers. You can rent them for $8 a day plus a $2 refundable
deposit at Shamu’s Emporium, just inside the park entrance.
 Lost children. Lost kids are taken to the Information Center, where
a park-wide paging system helps reunite them with their families.
Children younger than 7 should wear name-tags inside their clothing.
 Parking. Parking costs $8 for cars, pickups, and vans. The parking
lots aren’t huge, so most people can walk to the park, but trams also
run most times. Remember to note the location of your car, too.
SeaWorld characters, such as Wally Walrus, mark sections, but for-
getting where you parked is still easy after a long day in the park.
 Pet care. Board your pet for the day at the kennel between the
parking lot and main gate. The cost is $6 a day (no overnight stays).
Proof of vaccination is required.
 Strollers. Rent dolphin-shaped strollers at the Information Center
near the entrance. They cost $10 for a single, $17 for a double.
 Wheelchairs. Regular wheelchairs are available at the Information
Center for $8; electric chairs are $32; no deposits are required.
SeaWorld and Busch Gardens in Tampa (see Chapter 23), both owned
by Anheuser-Busch, have a shuttle service that provides $10 round-trip
tickets to get you from Orlando to Tampa and back. The 11⁄2- to 2-hour
one-way shuttle runs daily and has five pick-up locations in Orlando,

schedule allows for about a seven-hour stay at Busch Gardens. The serv-
ice is free if you have a five-park FlexTicket.
Exploring the Top Attractions at SeaWorld
SeaWorld explores the mysteries of the deep in a theme-park format that
combines wildlife-conservation awareness and education with simple
laid-back fun. Up-close encounters with a montage of marine life are the
major draws here, but you can also find plenty of amusing shows and a
handful of thrill rides added into the mix. 
To get a good look at the park’s layout, see the “SeaWorld” map on
page 291.
Blue Horizons
Blue Horizons, SeaWorld’s newest and most spectacular show to date,
made its debut in the summer of 2005 and replaced the Key West Dolphin
Fest. This unique show combines the grace and power of SeaWorld’s
most famous inhabitants, its dolphins and false killer whales, with the
pageantry of a Broadway production. The show transports you into the
dreams of an imaginative young girl, whose dream is to fly like the birds
and swim like the dolphins. Bringing the story to life, aerialists twirl high
in the air, while dolphins, whales, and bungee jumpers perform acrobatics
in the water. Adding to the drama are brightly-colored birds, which fly
over the audience. The entire show is set to an original score performed
by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. This is by far the most unique show
that SeaWorld has created and one that certainly shouldn’t be missed. 
Clyde & Seamore Take Pirate Island
A lovable and amusing sea lion-and-otter duet, with a supporting cast
of walruses and harbor seals, stars in fish-breathed comedy that comes
with a swashbuckling series of stunts. The show, staged inside the aptly
named Sea Lion & Otter Stadium, is corny, but don’t hold that against the
animal actors who are predictably adorable. The show also serves as a
welcome change from all the high-tech rides and shows at the other
theme parks. Be sure to arrive early enough to catch the mime as he
pokes fun at the guests who arrive a bit late, much to the amusement of
the entire audience.
Clydesdale Hamlet
Twice a day except Fridays, eight of the tremendous Clydesdale horses
are hitched to the big red wagon for a parade through the park, beginning
and ending at their stables, where visitors also can watch the parade
tack going on and off. Daily petting sessions are scheduled, and they’re a
great time to get a snapshot of you with one of the horses. In late winter
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
292

and spring, you may get to see a mare and foal that aren’t part of the
Clydesdale team.
Journey to Atlantis
Taking a cue from Disney’s Imagineers, SeaWorld created a part-flume,
part-coaster ride that carries the customary surgeon-general’s warning
about heart problems, neck or back ailments, pregnancy, dizziness, and
claustrophobia. The story line involves a fisherman, Hermes (the Greek
god), and wicked Sirens in a fierce battle between good and evil, but
what really matters is the drop — a wild, 60-foot plunge, with a bunch
of luge-like twists and turns and a shorter drop thrown in for good meas-
ure. There’s no hidden lesson here, just a splashy thrill when you least
expect it. Oh, and it goes without saying that you will get totally soaked.
Key West at SeaWorld
Although not quite the way Hemingway saw Key West, this 5-acre, tree-
and flower-lined, Caribbean-style village has food, street vendors, and
entertainers. It has three animal habitats: Stingray Lagoon, where you get
a hands-on encounter with harmless southern diamond and cownose
rays, an absolute favorite for younger kids; Dolphin Cove, a habitat for
bottlenose dolphins where you can sometimes feed or pet them as they
pass by; and Turtle Point, home to endangered and threatened species.
Shortly after this area opened, the dolphins often teased visitors by
swimming just out of arm’s reach. But they soon discovered the advan-
tages to human interaction — namely smelt.
Speaking of smelt, it’s real easy to be melted by the dolphins’ begging,
and you can easily burn $20 buying trays of their favorite snack to feed
to your newfound aquatic friends. I once spent half a park admission
feeding them before coming to my senses, so set a limit to your spending
(and feeding) ahead of time.
Kraken
Launched in summer 2000, this coaster is SeaWorld’s deepest foray into
the world of thrill-ride battles. Kraken is named for a massive, mythologi-
cal, underwater beast that Poseidon kept caged. This 21st-century monster
has floorless and open-sided 32-passenger trains that plant you on a
pedestal high above the track. When the coaster breaks loose, you climb
151 feet, fall 144 feet, hit speeds of 65 mph, go underground three times
(spraying bystanders with water — or worse, if you’re weak of stomach),
experience a moment of weightlessness, and make seven loops over a
4,177-foot course. This ride may be the longest 3 minutes, 39 seconds of
your life; according to a coaster fanatic friend who lives for adrenaline,
this is the best coaster in Central Florida (take that, Disney and Universal!).
Kraken carries a 54-inch height minimum. This is not a coaster for begin-
ners or youngsters — even if they meet the height requirement.
Chapter 20: SeaWorld & Discovery Cove 293

Manatee Rescue
This exhibit is as close as most people get to endangered West Indian
manatees. There are as few as 3,200 of them currently remaining in the
wild. Underwater viewing stations, innovative cinema techniques, and
interactive displays combine for a tribute to these gentle marine mam-
mals. It’s a nicer and roomier (for the manatees) exhibit than the tight
quarters their cousins have at The Living Seas in Epcot (see Chapter 13).
Kids especially like the more natural outdoor viewing area near the
entrance to the exhibit.
Marine Mammal Keeper Experience
Expect to invest a sizable chunk of your day and budget in this nine-
hour program (it runs from 6:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m., so you’ll also need to
be an early riser). You get to work side by side with a trainer, preparing
meals and feeding the animals, learning basic training techniques, and
sharing lunch. It costs $399 (tax inclusive), which also includes 7 days
of consecutive admission to SeaWorld, lunch, a career book, and a T-shirt.
The program is limited to two people per day, so make the required reser-
vations very early. You must be 13 or older, at least 52 inches tall, able to
climb, and able to lift and carry 15 pounds of vittles. Call % 407-432-1178
for more information.
Odyssea
Inside the Nautilus Theater, a cast of acrobats, mimes, dancers, musi-
cians, and comics put on a undersea show called Odyssea that, at times,
is artistic and funny (and always entertaining). The sets and costumes
focus on a whimsical underwater world. It’s similar in style to the Cirque
du Soleil production at Downtown Disney (see Chapter 25), but on a much
smaller scale. It’s also a great spot to give your feet a break and to cool
off, making it a good stop in the afternoon.
Penguin Encounter
The Penguin Encounter transports you via a 120-foot-long moving sidewalk
through Antarctic Tuxedoville. The stars of the show — four different
species of penguins — are on the other side of a Plexiglas shield. You get
a quick look at them as they preen, socialize, and swim at bullet speed in
a 30-degree habitat. You can also see puffins and murres (shorebirds) in
a similar, but separate, area. 
Though you get a nice view of the penguins (and they are always a hit
with the kids), the viewing area surroundings leave a bit to be desired.
Pets Ahoy!
A veritable menagerie of cats, dogs, pot-bellied pigs, skunks, and a horse
are joined by birds and rats (nearly 100 animals in all) to perform comic
relief in a 25-minute show held several times a day inside the SeaWorld
Theater. Almost all of the performers were rescued from animal shelters. 
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
294

Stick around after the show and your kids can have an up-close
encounter with a couple of the featured animal stars.
Shamu Adventure Show
Everyone comes to SeaWorld to see Shamu, and believe me the show
never disappoints. The Shamu Adventure Show, held inside Shamu
Stadium, is a well-choreographed show, planned and carried out by very
good trainers and very smart Orcas. Performing stunts with and without
their trainers, the whales jump and dive into the depths of the gigantic
pool, impressing the audience every time. The fun builds until the video
monitor flashes an urgent “Weather Watch,” and one of the trainers utters
the warning, “Uh-oh! Hurricane Shamu is about to make landfall!” At this
point, many folks remember the splash-area warnings posted throughout
the grandstand (seats in the first 14 rows may get drenched). Those who
didn’t pay attention when they arrived get one last chance to flee to higher
and drier areas of the stadium. The Orcas then race around the edge of
the pool, creating huge waves of icy water that profoundly soak everyone
and everything within range. Veteran animal handler Jack Hanna makes a
cameo appearance on overhead monitors, compliments of ShamuVision.
Shamu: Close Up! is an adjoining exhibit that lets you get close to killer
whales and learn about breeding programs. Don’t miss the underwater
viewing area. You may get to see a mother with her big baby.
A nighttime version of this show, Shamu Rocks America, offers more of
a party atmosphere and less of an educational experience. The whales
perform to the beat of blaring rock music, and special effects are more
predominant against the nighttime sky. It adds up to a very entertaining
show for all ages.
Chapter 20: SeaWorld & Discovery Cove 295
Eating with the fish
In May 2002, SeaWorld opened a restaurant program called Dine with Shamu
(% 800-327-2420 or 407-351-3600 for information and reservations). This reservations-
only seafood buffet is served poolside with Shamu as a special guest. While eating,
guests can mingle and question SeaWorld trainers. The menu also includes chicken,
beef, and salads and a children’s buffet offering mac ’n’ cheese, chicken, hot dogs,
and other kiddie favorites. The cost is $34 for adults and $18 for kids 3 to 9, in addition
to park admission. Reserving a spot two to three weeks in advance is usually more
than enough unless you’re coming in one of the crunch periods (summer, holidays).
The park also opened Sharks Underwater Grill (% 407-363-2559 for reservations),
where diners can dig into Floridian and Caribbean treats while watching denizens
swim by in the Shark Encounter exhibit — almost the entire back wall of the restau-
rant serves as a gigantic viewing area. Menu prices are $16 to $30 for adults and $6
to $12 for kids 3 to 9 (pasta, hot dogs, chicken breast, steak, and popcorn shrimp), and
theme-park admission is required.

Shamu’s Happy Harbor
This 3-acre play area has a four-story net tower with a 35-foot crow’s-
nest lookout, water cannons, remote-controlled vehicles, a ship, and a
water maze. It’s one of the most extensive play areas at any park and a
great place for kids to unwind. Because of its size, smaller kids can easily
get lost and could easily escape to the other areas of the park if you’re
not paying close attention. 
Bring extra clothes for the tots (or for yourself) because the Harbor isn’t
designed to keep you dry.
Shark Encounter
This attraction was expanded to include 220 species of aquatic preda-
tors. Pools out front have small sharks and rays. (Feeding isn’t allowed.)
Eerie background music sets the mood for viewing big eels, beautiful
lionfish, hauntingly still barracudas, and the fat, bug-eyed pufferfish in
large indoor aquariums. 
This attraction isn’t for the claustrophobic: You walk through a Plexiglas
tube beneath hundreds of millions of gallons of water. Small children
may find the swimming sharks a little too much to handle.
Sharks Deep Dive gives snorkelers and divers a chance to have limited,
hands-off contact with the 58 sharks, including a nearly 9-foot sand tiger,
in the Shark Encounter area. Two at a time, guests don wetsuits for a close
up encounter inside an actual shark cage that rides a 125-foot track. Part of
the cage is above water, but participants can dive up to 8 feet underwater
for a close-up look at the inhabitants. The cost is $150 for certified divers,
$125 for snorkelers (minimum age 10). The price includes a souvenir
booklet, T-shirt, and snorkel gear, but does not include the required park
admission fee.
Wild Arctic
Wild Arctic combines a high-definition adventure film with flight-simulator
technology to envelop guests in the beauty, exhilaration, and danger of a
polar expedition. After a hazardous, simulated helicopter flight over the
frozen north, visitors emerge at a remote research base, home to star
residents and polar bear twins Klondike and Snow, seals, walruses, and
white beluga whales. A separate walk-through line is available for those
who want to skip the bumpy simulator ride.
More SeaWorld fun
Other SeaWorld attractions include Pacific Point Preserve, a 21⁄2-acre
natural setting that duplicates the rocky northern Pacific Coast home of
California sea lions and harbor seals (yes, there are smelt opportunities
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
296

here!), and Tropical Rain Forest, a bamboo and banyan-tree habitat
that’s home to cockatoos and other birds.
The Anheuser-Busch Hospitality Center next to the Clydesdale
Hamlet has the “Label Stable” gift shop and a deli and offers free sam-
ples of Anheuser-Busch beers. At the Budweiser Beer School, guests
age 21 and over can learn how Anheuser-Busch brews the world’s top-
selling beer. 
SeaWorld’s new 5-acre Waterfront area, which debuted in late spring
2003, added a 5-acre, seaport-themed village to the park’s landscape.
On High Street, look for a blend of shops and the Seafire Inn restaurant,
where lunch includes a cute musical revue celebrating family, food, and
fun called Rico and Roza’s Musical Feast. At Harbor Square, the funny
Groove Chefs orchestra has chefs making music with pots and pans.
The park has also added street performers, including a crusty old sea
captain, who tells fish tales and makes music with bottles and brandy
glasses. Other eateries include Voyager’s Wood Fired Pizza and The
Spice Mill. 
Dining and Shopping at SeaWorld
For details on SeaWorld’s Makahiki Luau, a full-scale dinner show featur-
ing South Seas food (mahimahi, chicken, and pork) and entertainment,
see Chapter 24. For the lowdown on Sharks Underwater Grill, see the
Terrors of the Deep review earlier in this chapter.
SeaWorld also has several counter-style eateries offering the usual 
burgers, fajitas, salads, and so on. Most fast-food meals cost about 
$7 or $8 per person, and this doesn’t include the cost of a drink, which
will set you back another $2.50 or so.
The Waterfront is home to a number of full-service dining options with
decent cuisine, including:
 The Seafire Inn. Choose from a number of burgers (about $8–$9)
stir fry, sandwiches, and salads, or try a jumbo baked potato served
with your choice of several toppings for $7.
 Voyager’s Wood Fired Pizzas. The pizza- and parmesan fries–combo
platter here offers good value at $8, with seafood, pasta, chicken,
sandwiches, and salads and a huge kid’s menu to choose from as well.
 The Spice Mill. This eatery specializes in the spices of famous 
seaport cities. Try the jambalaya or the jerk-grilled chicken sand-
wiches or an array of other more unique offerings. An entree will
set you back about $12.
Chapter 20: SeaWorld & Discovery Cove 297

SeaWorld doesn’t have nearly as many shops as the other major theme
parks, but the stores offer plenty of surprisingly cuddly sea creatures.
For example, you can buy a stuffed manatee at Manatee Cove. The Friends
of the Wild gift shop near Penguin Encounter is also nice, as is the shop
attached to Wild Arctic. Because of the Anheuser-Busch connection, the
gift shop outside the entrance to the park offers a staggering array of
Budweiser- and Busch-related items. There are a handful of unique 
boutiques featuring items from garden art to unique toys and T-shirts
at the Waterfront.
Checking Out Discovery Cove
SeaWorld’s second theme park opened in summer 2000. Its $100-million
construction cost may be one-tenth the sticker price of Islands of
Adventure, but Discovery Cove’s admission price is four times higher.
The options: $229 to $259 per person plus 6.5 percent sales tax if you
want to swim with a dolphin (minimum age 6), or $129 to $159 if you
can simply settle for the fishes. The prices vary seasonally, so double
check when you make your reservations (which are a requirement to
enter this park).
A perk of the higher price tag is that it includes a 7-day consecutive
pass to either SeaWorld or Busch Gardens (see Chapter 23). You can
upgrade this feature to a 14-day combination pass for both parks for an
additional $30. If you plan on visiting all three parks, that’s actually a
pretty good deal. 
Almost everyone who does the dolphin encounter finds it exciting — just
the kind of thing that makes for a most memorable vacation. If, however,
your kids are younger than age 6, or you decide to skip the dolphin swim,
it’s hard to imagine that you’ll get your $129 worth. The atmosphere here
isn’t tailored to toddlers and is, instead, meant to be a relaxing oasis, quiet
and serene. I can’t really recommend this park for those of you with very
young children in tow.
The park has more than two-dozen dolphins, and each works from two
to four hours a day. They’re pretty incredible animals, and, although
their size may be a bit intimidating to some, they’re very people-friendly.
Many of them are mature critters that have spent their lives in captivity,
around people. Most of them love getting their bellies, backs, and flukes
rubbed. They also have an impressive bag of tricks. Given the proper
hand signals, they can mimic the sound of a human passing gas, chatter
in dolphin talk, and do seemingly effortless 11⁄2 gainers in 12 feet of water.
They also take guests for piggyback rides.
The dolphin experience lasts 90 minutes, about 35 to 40 minutes of which
is actually spent in the lagoon. Trainers use the rest of the time to teach
visitors about these remarkable mammals.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
298

The rest of your day won’t be nearly as exciting, but it is wonderfully
relaxing. Discovery Cove doesn’t deliver thrill rides, water slides, or
acrobatic animal shows; that’s what SeaWorld, Disney, and Universal
are for. This is where you come to get away from all that!
Discovery Cove is an all-inclusive park, so in addition to the dolphin
experience, your fee tosses in
 Elbow room — there’s a limit of 1,000 guests per day. (To give you
an idea of how little that is, the normal daily attendance at Disney’s
Magic Kingdom is 41,000.) This ensures your experience will be more
relaxing and private, which is essentially what you’re paying for.
 Lunch (entrees include items such as fajitas, salmon, stir-fry, and
pesto chicken), a towel, sunscreen, snorkeling gear including a
flotation vest, a souvenir photo, and free parking are also part of
the deal.
 Activities that include:
• Swimming near (but on the other side of Plexiglas from) 
barracudas and black-tip sharks.
• Snorkeling around a huge pool containing a coral reef with
colorful tropical fish and another area with gentle rays.
• Touching and feeding 300 exotic birds in an aviary hidden
under a waterfall.
• Cooling off under foaming waterfalls.
• Soaking up the sun on the beaches.
• Enjoying the soothing waters of the park’s pools and rivers
(freshwater and saltwater).
 Seven days of unlimited admission to SeaWorld or Busch Gardens
in Tampa.
Reservations are required far in advance, but you have at least a chance
of getting in as a walk-up guest as the park reserves a small number of
tickets daily for folks whose earlier dolphin sessions were canceled due
to bad weather. Your best chance for last-minute tickets comes during
any extended period of good weather.
To get to Discovery Cove, follow the directions to SeaWorld given in
the “Gathering Important SeaWorld Information” section, earlier in this
chapter.

I
n Chapters 11 through 20, I covered the major theme parks in and
around Orlando. But you’re probably wondering if there’s anything
that’s more relaxed, a little — and I do mean little — cheaper, and still
offers a memorable experience.
The answer is yes.
In this chapter, I explore the city’s best alternatives to the mega parks.
To further help you out, I’ve divided them into two categories: those in
which you stay dry and those in which you get wet — the latter are very
popular options in the midst of Orlando’s summer heat and humidity
(for more about the weather, see Chapter 3).

Flying Tigers Warbird Restoration Museum
Kissimmee
A guided tour through this working restoration and museum facility allows
visitors to see, smell, and touch numerous historic warplanes, mainly
from the World War II era. The museum’s fleet — many of which are still
flightworthy — includes a B-17 Flying Fortress, a Kestrel Harrier, a P-38

Lightning, a Corsair, and three dozen others. The museum also has a
number of armament and memorabilia displays. It’s a great outing for avi-
ation buffs. Plan on spending about two hours.
See map p. 303. 231 N. Hoagland Blvd. (south of U.S. 192), Kissimmee. % 407-933-1942.
www.warbirdmuseum.com. Admission: $9 adults, $8 seniors 60 and older and chil-
dren 7–12, children younger than 7 enter free. Parking: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Gatorland
North of Kissimmee
It’s hard to miss the gigantic green jaws — a perfect vacation photo op, by
the way — marking this park’s entrance. Founded in 1949, with just a hand-
ful of alligators living in huts and pens, Gatorland, still privately owned
and operated, now houses thousands of alligators (including a rare blue
one) and crocodiles on 110-acre grounds that do dual duty as a wildlife
preserve and theme park. Gatorland has survived the arrival of Disney,
Universal, and SeaWorld in part because of its old-Florida charm and resist-
ance to becoming overly commercialized (though it hasn’t escaped entirely).
Breeding pens, nurseries, and rearing ponds are scattered throughout the
densely landscaped property, which also displays monkeys, snakes, birds,
Florida turtles, and a galapagos tortoise. Its 2,000-foot boardwalk winds
through a cypress swamp and breeding marsh with an observation tower
for those who prefer an overhead view. The park’s four shows include
Gator Wrestlin’, where, at the same time wrestlers are wrangling the rep-
tilians, they’re educating the audience about their opponents and how
they live; the Gator Jumparoo, which features the giant reptiles lunging 4 to
5 feet up out of the water to snatch a dead chicken right from a trainer’s
hand; Up Close Encounters, which showcases a variety of the park’s wildlife,
including some venomous snakes; and Jungle Crocs of the World, which fea-
tures even more of the park’s toothy reptiles. There’s an open-air restaurant
where you can try smoked gator ribs and nuggets, though more-familiar
favorites, such as burgers and hot dogs, are available as well, and a shop
where you can buy gator-leather goods and souvenirs. (Gatorland also oper-
ates a breeding farm for meat and hides.) Younger guests will appreciate
the park’s water play area, petting zoo, and train ride. The atmosphere
here is laid back. It’s always been a huge hit with my family, and it serves
up the best half-day experience in the area. 
Gatorland’s Trainer for a Day program lets up to five guests get up close
and personal with the gators for a day (or part of it, anyway). The $100,
two-hour experience puts you side by side with trainers and includes a
chance to wrangle some alligators (minimum age 12). Advanced reserva-
tions are required, and admission to the park is included.
See map p. 303. 14501 S. Orange Blossom Trail/U.S. 441 (between Osceola Parkway and
Hunter’s Creek Boulevard). % 800-393-5297 or 407-855-5496. www.gatorland.com.
Admission: $20 adults, $9.95 kids 3–12; advance online purchase price $17 adults,

Harry P. Leu Gardens
Near Winter Park
This serene, 50-acre botanical garden on the shores of Lake Rowena offers
a delightful break from the theme-park razzle-dazzle. Meandering paths
lead through camphors, oaks, and palms. The camellia collection is one of
the world’s largest, blooming October through March. The formal rose gar-
dens are the largest in Florida and contain 75 varieties. Italian fountains,
statues, and a gazebo enhance the gardens. Other highlights include
orchids, azaleas, desert plants, beds of colorful annuals and perennials, a
butterfly garden, and a 50-foot floral clock. 
Businessman Harry P. Leu, who donated his estate to the city in the 1960s,
created the gardens. There are $6 guided tours of his house, built in 1888,
on the hour and half-hour (advance reservations suggested). The interior
has Victorian, Chippendale, and Empire furnishings and pieces of art. 
See map p. 303. 1920 N. Forest Ave. (between Nebraska Street and Corrine Drive),
Orlando. % 407-246-2620. www.leugardens.org. Admission: $5 adults, $1 children
grades K–12. Admission is free Mon 9am–noon. Parking: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
except Christmas. Leu House is closed July. 
The Orange County Regional History Center
Downtown
Located within a beautifully restored and historic courthouse built back in
1927, the history center is filled with a multimedia experience that takes
visitors on a tour of the Florida and Orlando of long ago to the thriving
urban community it is today. The interactive and multisensory experience
makes for a unique walk through history. Among the five stories of exhibits
are a Florida back porch where the sights and sounds of central Florida’s
natural environment surround you; a Paleo and Seminole Indian settle-
ment; pioneer cabins; and Florida Crackers. There is also an old courtroom
where Ted Bundy is said to have scratched his name into the defendants’
table. For those who believe, it is said that ghosts have been known to
roam the hallways, causing supernatural disturbances that have induced
more than a few letters of resignation over the years. Guided tours are
available on Saturdays at 11 a.m. Allow two hours. 
See map p. 303. 65 E. Central Blvd. % 407-836-8595. www.thehistorycenter.org.
Admission: $7 Adults, $6.50 students and seniors, $3.50 children 3–12. Parking: Free
at the Orlando Public Library. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m. 
Orlando Museum of Art
Downtown
This local heavyweight handles some of the most prestigious traveling
exhibits in the nation. The museum, founded in 1924, hosts special exhibits
throughout the year, but even if you miss one, it’s worth a stop to see its
rotating permanent collection of 19th- and 20th-century American art, pre-
Columbian art dating from 1200 B.C. to A.D. 1500, and African art. Allow
two to three hours.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando

See map p. 303. 2416 N. Mills Ave. (in Loch Haven Park). % 407-896-4231. www.omart.
org. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors, $5 children 6–18. Parking: Free. Open: Tue–Fri
10 a.m.–4 p.m., Sat–Sun noon to 4 p.m.
Orlando Science Center
Downtown
This modern, four-story center — the largest of its kind in the Southeast —
has 10 halls in which visitors can explore everything from the swamps of
Florida to the arid plains of Mars. One of the big attractions is the Dr.
Phillips CineDome, a 310-seat theater that features films, planetarium
shows, and laser-light presentations. In KidsTown, small fries wander in a
mini version of the world around them. Science City, located nearby, has
a power plant and suspension bridge, and 123 Math Avenue uses puzzles
and other things to make math fun. This option is a great change of pace,
especially if you’re traveling with children. Allow three to four hours (more
if you have an inquiring mind). If you stomach gets the better of you,
there’s a very casual open cafe area that serves burgers and other famil-
iar favorites.
Strollers are available at no extra charge. 
See map p. 303. 777 E. Princeton St. (between Orange and Mills in Loch Haven Park),
Orlando. % 407-514-2000 or 888-672-4386. www.osc.org. Admission (includes
exhibits, CineDome film, and planetarium show): $15 adults, $14 students with valid
ID and seniors 55 and older, $9.95 children 3–11. After 4 p.m. Fri and Sat admission is
reduced $5 for all rates. Parking: $3.50 in a garage across the street. Open:
Mon–Thurs 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Fri–Sat 9 a.m.–9 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.
Chapter 21: Discovering Orlando’s Other Attractions 305
Go Orlando!
The newly introduced Go Orlando Card is a great way to see the “best of the rest” that
Orlando has to offer, with admission to attractions like Gatorland, Ripley’s, Watermania,
WonderWorks, Kennedy Space Center, and discounts at area restaurants and shops.
Here’s how it works: You purchase the all-inclusive Go Card instead of individual tick-
ets to each venue. You then have two weeks in which to use the card at any of the
participating venues. They are available in two-, three-, five-, or seven-day increments;
the card is activated with the first use and is good for up to 14 days after activated (For
example a two-day ticket can be used any two days during the two-week time frame). 
Depending on the number of attractions you plan to visit, the Go Card may very well save
you some bucks. For details go to www.goorlandocard.com. When you purchase
a Go Orlando Card, you’ll receive maps and a free guidebook with information on the
included attractions. The cost of a two-day card is $99 for adults, $79 for kids ages 3
to 12; a three-day card costs $149 for adults, $109 for kids; a five-day card is $199 for
adults, $149 for kids; and a seven-day card runs $259 for adults and $179 for kids. 

Ripley’s Believe It or Not! Odditorium
International Drive
Do you crave weird science? If you’re a fan of the truly bizarre, come here
to see lots of oddities. Among the hundreds of exhibits in its 16 galleries:
a shrunken head, a two-headed calf, a 1,069-pound man, a five-legged cow,
a three-quarter-scale model of a 1907 Rolls-Royce made of 1 million match-
sticks, a mosaic of the Mona Lisa created from toast, torture devices from
the Spanish Inquisition, and a Tibetan flute made of human bones — you’re
getting the idea right? You’ll also find exhibits on Houdini, films of people
swallowing coat hangers, and other human oddities. Visitors are greeted by
a hologram of Robert Ripley himself. There are 27 Odditoriums throughout
the world, and no two are alike. The tour makes for a fun rainy afternoon
or late-night activity. Allow two hours.
8201 International Drive (11⁄2 blocks south of Sand Lake Road). % 407-345-4501.
www.ripleys.com/orlando2.htm. Admission: $17 adults, $12 children 4–12.
Parking: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–1 a.m. 
WonderWorks
International Drive
On an uncharted island somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle, a tornado
was inadvertently created by scientists experimenting with some seriously
weird science. In the midst of the storm, the gigantic building where they
were working was swept up and carried off, dropping right in the middle
of Orlando — amazingly, the building is fully intact, but it is now upside
down. This attraction is educational and fun, just don’t come expecting
things to be as glitzy as they are in some of the major parks. Throughout
the three levels you’ll feel the tremble of an earthquake, experience the
rush of hurricane-force winds, create massive bubbles, lie on a bed of nails,
walk across the bridge of fire — a hair-raising, electrical experience — and
even ride the rails via a simulator on a create-your-own-coaster ride. You’ll
learn dozens of fun and interesting facts. (Where are a cricket’s ears? On
its knees.) And experience plenty of mind-boggling visual effects. More
than 100 exhibits are included, but if you’re not a good shot, steer clear of
the Laser Tag game: It costs $5 above regular admission and can make for
a frustrating few minutes — and while you’re at it, skip the arcade extras
as well.
The attraction also features a nightly combination of magic and comedy in
the dinner show called The Outta Control Magic Show. The 90-minute show
features magic and improvisational comedy, as well as unlimited pizza,
popcorn, soft drinks, and beer. It’s a fun time for the kids, and not too bad
for adults either. Call to reserve a spot for the show. 
Combination tickets are available for discounted admission to WonderWorks,
Laser Tag, and the dinner show and are a good buy. Discount coupons are
also available on the attraction’s Web site, so check it out before you arrive.
See map p. 303. 9067 International Drive, Orlando % 407-351-8800. www.Wonder
WorksOnline.com. Admission: regular admission $19 adults, $13 kids 4–11 and
seniors 55 and older; combination ticket offering admission to WonderWorks, Laser
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando

Tag, and Outta Control $38 adults, $27 kids 4–12 and seniors 55 and older. Outta
Control alone is $22 adults, $15 kids 4–11 and seniors. Parking: $2 an hour next door
at the Pointe Orlando parking garage. Open: Daily 9 a.m. to midnight. Dinner show
nightly at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. 
Getting Wet at Orlando’s Water Parks
For more aquatic fun, see Chapter 16 for information on Disney World’s
pair of water parks: Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach.
Water Mania
Kissimmee
This 36-acre water park offers a variety of aquatic thrill rides and attrac-
tions. You can boogie board or body surf in the wave pools, float lazily along
an 850-foot river, enjoy a white-water tube run on Riptide, and spiral down
the Twin Tornadoes water slide. If you dare, ride The Screamer, a 72-foot
freefall speed slide, or the Abyss, an enclosed tube slide that corkscrews
through 380 feet of darkness, exiting into a splash pool. There’s a rain
forest–themed water playground and a pirates’ lagoon for children; a minia-
ture golf course; and picnic area with arcade games, a beach, and volleyball.
Allow four to five hours. Tubes, towels, and lockers are all available for
rent for a small fee and a $1 deposit ($2.15 for a towel, $5–$6.40 for a tube,
$4.30–$6.40 for a locker; a child-size life vest can be rented at no charge).
This park offers fewer thrill rides than the city’s other water parks and,
therefore, attracts fewer teens and young adults, which may make it a little
more attractive to families with smaller children.
See map p. 303. 6073 W. Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy./U.S. 192, Kissimmee. % 800-527-
3092 or 407-396-2626. www.watermania-florida.com. Admission: $30 adults;
$27 kids 3–9. Parking: $6. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Mar–early Sept; Mon–Fri 11 a.m.–
5 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. mid- to late Sept. Call for hours during the month of Oct. 
Wet ’n Wild
International Drive
Unlike Water Mania (see the preceding entry), this 25-acre Universal-owned
water park is in the same league as Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach.
In terms of popularity, it ranks third in the country, right behind the two
Disney parks. It has several first-rate water rides, including The Flyer, a
six-story, four-passenger toboggan ride packing 450 feet of banked curves;
The Surge, which offers 580 feet of greased curves and is billed as the fastest
tube ride in the Southeast; Black Hole, where two-person rafts shoot through
500 feet of twisting, sometimes dark passages; and the new Disco H2O, which
takes riders back in time on a four-person raft through an enclosed and
rather wild flume ride. Riders eventually end up floating about in the Aqua
Club, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase Disco Duck. Laser lights
and disco balls flash all around as you move and groove to the sounds of
the ’70s. All three require that kids 36- to 48-inches tall have an adult with them. 
Chapter 21: Discovering Orlando’s Other Attractions 307

You can also ride Raging Rapids, a simulated white-water run with a water-
fall plunge; Blue Niagara with its 300 feet of loops and dips (48-inch height
minimum); Knee Ski, a cable-operated knee-boarding course only open in
warm weather (56-inch height minimum); and Mach 5, which consists of a
trio of twisting, turning flumes. The park also has a large kids’ area with
miniature versions of some of the grown-up rides. If you enjoy the water,
plan on spending a full day here. You can rent tubes ($4), towels ($2), and
lockers ($5); or a combination of all three ($9); each rental requires a $2
refundable deposit.
If you’re considering visiting several of the non-Disney theme parks, the
most economical way to see Wet ’n Wild, Universal Studios Florida,
Islands of Adventure, and SeaWorld is with a FlexTicket. It enables you to
pay one price to visit any of them during a 14-day period. The four-park
pass costs $185 for adults and $151 for children 3 to 9. A five-park pass,
which adds Busch Gardens, in Tampa (see Chapter 23), is $225 for adults
and $190 for kids. You can order the FlexTicket through Wet ’n Wild.
See map p. 303. 6200 International Drive (at Universal Boulevard), Orlando. % 800-992-
9453 or 407-351-9453. www.wetnwild.com. Admission: $34 adults, $28 kids 3–9.
Parking: $6. Open: Hours vary seasonally, but the park is open at least 10 a.m.–5 p.m.,
sometimes as late as 11 p.m., weather permitting.

Chapter 22
Shopping in Orlando
In This Chapter
 Getting acquainted with Orlando’s shopping districts
 Checking out the malls, the outlets, and more
 Exploring the antiques district
I
n this chapter, I provide you with a rundown of some of the better
spots outside the Disney district where you can shop to your heart’s
content, if you’ve anything left in your bank account after the theme
parks have wangled their share. Because Walt Disney World is so expert
at separating you from your money, you’ll find the lowdown on shopping
(and spending) at Disney in Chapter 17 . . . yes, it actually requires its
very own chapter.
Surveying the Scene
Orlando is a shopper’s paradise, offering everything from antiques to
souvenirs to upscale one-of-a-kind boutiques. Bargains, however, are
few and far between. If you’re the kind of person who prides yourself on
unearthing a good buy, you’ll be doing a lot of digging before you find
any noteworthy deals. Orlando hosts an array of indoor multilevel malls,
many of them with a fine collection of upscale department stores and
unique specialty stores. There are also a few factory outlets, but the 
bargains there are often not much better than the sale prices offered
at many department stores. The city proper has an antiques district
where its lots of fun to window shop, but unless you’re a serious collec-
tor, the prices tend to be prohibitive. Most of Central Florida’s tourist
areas (Orlando, Kissimmee, and the surrounding territory included) are
riddled with T-shirt shacks, jeans joints, and souvenir stands promising
bargains that don’t (or rarely) exist. 
The same is true of the theme parks. If you line up at the registers at
Disney, Universal, and the other parks, you pay more than what the 
merchandise is worth. But if you must have those mouse ears, check
out the Disney shopping options in Chapter 17 with the other major
theme parks’ merchandise mentioned in Chapters 18, 19, and 20.

You can actually get cheaper authentic theme park merchandise outside
of the parks than you can within them. Both Disney and Universal operate
outlet stores in some of the city’s most popular malls (though selections
are often very limited, so don’t expect to find any unique merchandise).
See “Checking Out the Big Names,” later in this chapter for more details
on these rare opportunities.
Here are three shopping heads-ups before you get started:
 Sales tax: In Orange County, which includes the International Drive
area and most of the parks, sales tax is 6.5 percent. Kissimmee and
the rest of Osceola County charge 7 percent sales tax. 
 Store hours: Most of the stores I mention in this chapter are open
seven days a week, from 9 or 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. (6 p.m. on Sun).
Small stores, including those in the antiques district, usually close
around 5 or 6 p.m. and often aren’t open on Sunday. Be sure to call
before you head out; the hours are subject to change.
 Money: Most stores accept major credit cards, traveler’s checks, and,
of course, cash (U.S. currency only). An ATM may not be handy in
some areas, and none of the stores listed in this chapter accept for-
eign currency or personal checks. So be prepared before heading out.
All the places listed in this chapter can be found on the “Orlando Area
Shopping” map on page 311.
Finally, know that because Orlando is geared toward travelers, many
retailers offer to ship packages home for a few dollars more. So, if you’re
pondering an extra-large or a fragile purchase you don’t want to drag
home on the plane, train, or in the car, ask. If a retailer doesn’t offer this
service, check with your hotel. Many either have a business center where
you can mail it yourself, or they can arrange a pick-up by United Parcel
Service, the slow-but-good-old U.S. Postal Service, or another carrier to
keep you from dragging a 6-foot stuffed Pluto into the Friendly Skies. 
Exploring Great Shopping Neighborhoods
Orlando doesn’t have a central shopping district or districts. Instead,
most shops are sprinkled throughout and around the tourist hot spots
and in retail areas where locals shop, such as malls and so on. The fol-
lowing is a list of some of the more frequented shopping zones:
 Celebration: Think Pleasantville à la Disney. Created by Disney, the
town of 25,000 is more of a charming diversion than a good place to
power shop. The downtown area has a dozen or so stores and bou-
tiques, a handful of art galleries, a grocer, and a parfumerie among
others. The storefronts are filled with enticing displays, while inside
they peddle interesting and, often, unique — though highly priced —
merchandise; but, the real attraction is the mid-20th-century, Main
Street atmosphere. Those nostalgic for yesteryear, or in search of

a quieter, more sophisticated afternoon out on the town, love it,
and . . . look, over there! Is that Ozzie and Harriet? From WDW, take
U.S. 192 east 5 miles, past Interstate 4. The entrance to Celebration
is on the right. Call % 407-566-2200 for more information.
 Kissimmee: Southeast of the Disney parks, Kissimmee straddles
U.S. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway — a sometimes tacky, 
too-often-under-construction stretch of highway lined with budget
motels, smaller attractions, and a branch of every fast-food restau-
rant in the known universe. Although Kissimmee has recently begun
to evolve and now includes more family-oriented attractions and
better hotels and eateries, the town’s shopping merit remains negli-
gible unless you’re looking for a cheap T-shirt, or seashells not sold
by the seashore, or the like. That said, cowboy lovers may appreci-
ate the area’s Western shops, a sign the city is still mindful of its
cowboy roots.
 International Drive area: This tourist magnet is east of, and extends
7 to 10 miles north of, the Disney parks between Highway 535 and
the Florida Turnpike. The southern end offers a little elbow room,
the midsection is somewhat upscale, but the northern part is a
tourist strip crowded with small-time attractions (including bungee
jumping for those who have a death wish), fast fooderies, and sou-
venir shacks. Its most redeeming shopping draws: Pointe Orlando
and the Orlando Premium Outlets. (See listing under “The Malls,”
later in this chapter.) 
Locally, International Drive is better known as I-Drive.
 Downtown Orlando: Orlando’s downtown is actually northeast of the
theme parks along I-4. The biggest draws here are the shops along
Antique Row. (See “Antiquing Downtown,” later in this chapter.)
 Winter Park: Just north of Downtown Orlando, Winter Park began
as a haven for the wealthy Yankees escaping the cold Northeast.
Today, Winter Park’s centerpiece is Park Avenue, a collection of
upscale shops, art galleries, and restaurants along a cobblestone,
tree-lined street. Ann Taylor, Talbot’s, Williams-Sonoma, and
Crabtree & Evelyn are among the dozens of specialty shops.
No matter which end of Park Avenue you start at, there are more
shops than most can survive, but you’re bound to find something
here you won’t find anywhere else. For more information on Winter
Park, call % 407-644-8281.
Checking Out the Big Names 
Orlando’s reputation wasn’t built on shopping. In fact, it isn’t even the
No. 1 shopping area in Florida, falling well short of Miami–Fort Lauderdale.
But Orlando has attracted some big names, including a very small Saks,
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
312

as well as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s. Some
of the better specialty stores include Tiffany & Co. and Charles David,
while some of the more unique retailers include Ron Jon’s Surf Shop and
Hilo Hattie. It also has a growing stable of discount centers.
Factory outlets
In the last decade, the tourist areas have bloomed with outlets where
shoppers can find plenty of name brands, but not always big bargains.
Although many of the stores claim savings of 50 to 75 percent, a dis-
count on a heavily marked-up or overpriced item doesn’t always mean
you’re actually getting a deal. And more often than not, only a few items
are as heavily marked down as the outlets maintain. What you will find
(at least in most cases anyway) is a decent selection of designer and
name-brand merchandise at slightly lower prices than you would nor-
mally pay at the malls. 
If you’re a smart outlet shopper, you know the suggested retail prices for
items before you hit the stores. Therefore, you’ll know just what is —
and what isn’t — a bargain.
Here’s a list of outlet stores and centers in and around Orlando:
 Belz Factory Outlet World: Belz (% 407-352-9611; www.belz.com)
is the granddaddy of all Orlando outlets. Located at 5401 W. Oak
Ridge Rd. (at the north end of International Drive), it has 170 stores
in two huge, enclosed malls and four annexes. The outlet offers more
than a dozen shoe stores (including Bass, Nike, and Timberland),
many housewares stores (such as Fitz & Floyd, Oneida, and Mikasa),
and more than 60 clothing shops (London Fog, Adidas, Tommy
Hilfiger, Danskin, Izod, Liz Claiborne, Guess Jeans, Kasper, and
Geoffrey Beene, for example). You’ll also find records, electronics,
sporting goods, health and beauty aids, jewelry, toys, gifts, acces-
sories, lingerie, hosiery, and so on.
The two main buildings, Mall 1 and Mall 2, each have discount 
outlets for Disney World merchandise (Character Premier and
Character Warehouse), as well a store for Universal Orlando. You
have to dig for some of the bargains, but if you don’t mind your
item saying 2005 instead of 2006, you can save 50 percent or more
on select items.
 Lake Buena Vista Factory Stores: The three dozen or so outlets
here include Big Dog, Casuals (Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger),
Gap, Old Navy, Nike, Eddie Bauer, Carters, Liz Claiborne, Fossil,
Osh Kosh, and Reebok. Savings are modest, but the plaza itself is
quiet and inviting. There’s also a food court and a salon. You can
find these stores at 15591 S. Apopka–Vineland Rd.; % 407-238-9301;
www.lbvfs.com.
Chapter 22: Shopping in Orlando 313

 Orlando Premium Outlets: This is my favorite outlet mall in Orlando,
and it’s also the only true upscale outlet in the city. The center’s
110 tenants include Coach, DKNY, Kenneth Cole, Nike, Hugo Boss,
Ralph Lauren, Nautica, Timberland, and Tommy Hilfiger. In contrast
to most of the outlet centers in the city, it’s character is more of an
open-air outdoor mall. Some of the best buys here are at Banana
Republic and a second location of Disney’s discount Character
Premier store. It’s at 8200 Vineland Ave. (just off the southern
third of I-Drive, next to Dolly’s Dixie Stampede); % 407-238-7787;
www.PremiumOutlets.com.
The Malls
The Orlando area is also home to several traditional shopping malls. As
in malls throughout the country, good buys are often elusive. Arguably, a
mall’s best bargain is the people-watching, which is free. Here’s a list of
Orlando’s malls:
 Altamonte Mall: Built in the early 1970s, this is the area’s second
largest mall, behind the Florida Mall (see later in this list). Altamonte
Mall’s major-league tenants include Macy’s, JCPenney, and Sears, as
well as 175 specialty shops. Major renovations have added a food
court; a new indoor, soft-play area for younger kids; rides for tod-
dlers; and a new 18-screen AMC movie theater with stadium seating.
You can find it at 451 E. Altamonte Dr. (about 15 miles north of down-
town Orlando). For information call % 407-830-4422 or surf over to
www.altamontemall.com.
 Festival Bay: One of the newest additions to the shopping scene,
Festival Bay’s tenants include a Ron Jon Surf Shop, Hilo Hattie, Bass
Pro Shops, and several other specialty stores. Restaurants include
a handful of fast-food eateries as well as Murray Bros. Caddy Shack,
Fuddruckers, and the brand new Dixie Crossroads, with a Cold Stone
Creamery to top off your meal. Some of the area’s more unique recre-
ational venues can be found here as well, including Vans (indoor)
Skatepark; The Putting Edge, a glow-in-the-dark mini golf park; and
a 20-screen Cinemark Theater. Plans are in the works for an indoor
Ron Jon Surf Park where surfers, beginners and experts alike, can
ride the waves and hang ten all day long. This one can be found at
5250 International Drive (the far north end of I-Drive across from
the Belz Outlets). For information call % 407-351-7718 or go to
www.belz.com. 
 Florida Mall: The exciting news at this popular shopping spot is the
arrival of Nordstrom and Lord & Taylor to combat the opening of
Mall at Millenia (see below). Other anchors include Macy’s, Dillard’s,
JCPenney, Sears, and Saks to go along with an Adam’s Mark Hotel
and more than 250 specialty stores (Abercrombie & Fitch, Harry &
David, Sharper Image, and Benetton, to name a few), restaurants
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
314

(the Salsa Taqueria and Tequila Bar, California Pizza Kitchen, and
Bucca Di Beppo are just three of the choices), and entertainment
venues. You can find the Florida Mall at 8001 S. Orange Blossom
Trail (at Sand Lake Road, 4 miles east of International Drive). For
details, call % 407-851-6255 or check out www.shopsimon.com.
 Mall at Millenia: This 1.3 million-square-foot upscale center made
quite a splash when it debuted in October 2002 with anchors that
include Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, and Neiman Marcus. In addition to
the heavyweight anchors, Millenia offers 200 specialty stores that
include Burberry, Chanel, Crate & Barrel, Godiva, Gucci, Lladro,
Swarovski, and Tiffany & Co. Restaurants include The Cheesecake
Factory, P.F. Chang’s China Bistro, Johnny Rockets, and Panera
Bread among others. The recently-opened Blue Martini is an upscale
bar featuring a tapas menu and 29 designer martinis and is a good
place to celebrity watch or just pretend to be famous. The mall
is 5 miles from downtown Orlando at 4200 Conroy Rd. (at I-4 near
Universal Orlando). For details, call % 407-363-3555 or visit www.
mallatmillenia.com.
 Orlando Fashion Square Mall: This city-side mall has marbled
walkways, indoor palm trees, and tenants that include Macy’s,
JCPenney, Sears, 165 specialty shops, and an extensive food court.
The mall is 5 miles from downtown Orlando at 3201 E. Colonial Dr.;
% 407-896-1132.
 Pointe Orlando: Although it’s set up like a mall, this complex’s two
levels of stores, restaurants, and a 21-screen IMAX theater aren’t
under one roof, making it a mall with an open top. Headliners among
the 60 shops include Bath & Body Works, Foot Locker, and Victoria’s
Secret. Plans are underway to renovate the complex to include even
more shops and restaurants and create a more-inviting streetscape.
Parking is $5 in the attached garage, but most restaurants, night-
clubs, and the movie theater will validate with a purchase. Pointe
Orlando (% 407-248-2838; www.pointeorlandofl.com) is located
at 9101 International Drive.
Antiquing Downtown
If you can think of nothing better than a relaxing afternoon of sifting
through yesterday’s treasures, check out Antique Row and Ivanhoe
Row on North Orange Avenue in downtown Orlando.
Flo’s Attic (% 407-895-1800; www.flosattic.com) and A.J. Lillun (% 407-
895-6111) sell traditional antiques. Fredlund Wildlife Gallery (% 407-898-
4544; www.fredlundwildlife.com) sells pricey, original works of art,
including sculpture. And The Fly Fisherman (% 407-898-1989; www.fly
fishermaninc.com) sells — no surprise here — fly-fishing gear. You can
sometimes watch people taking lessons in the park across the street.
Chapter 22: Shopping in Orlando 315

All the stores I mention in this section are spread over 3 miles along
Orange Avenue. The heaviest concentration is between Princeton Street
and New Hampshire Avenue, although a few are scattered between New
Hampshire and Virginia avenues. The more upscale shops extend a few
blocks beyond Virginia Avenue. To reach the area from the theme parks,
take I-4 east to Princeton Street (Exit 43). Turn right on Orange Avenue.
Parking is limited, so stop wherever you find a space.
As for hours of operation, most of the stores are open from 9 or 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday. (Storeowners usually run the stores,
so hours can vary; call before you head out. A small number of shops
are open Sunday, but it isn’t worth the trip from the resorts.)
If you decide to do your antiquing on a Saturday, you can also shop for
fresh produce, plants, baked goods, and crafts every Saturday from
8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at a downtown farmers’ market. It’s located at the
intersection of North Magnolia and East Central. Get more information
at www.downtownorlando.com.

316
Homegrown souvenirs
Given Orlando’s history as a major citrus producer, oranges, grapefruit, and other citrus
products rank high on the list of local products. Orange Blossom Indian River Citrus,
5151 S. Orange Blossom Trail, Orlando (%800-624-8835 or 407-855-2837; www.orange-
blossom.com), is one of the top sellers during the late-fall-to-late-spring season. It also
makes a great place to shop for anyone left in charge of your pets, house, or other such
duties while you’re off vacationing in the sunshine state.
And if you have a love affair with leather, alligator-skin leather goods are a specialty
of the gift shop at Gatorland, 14501 S. Orange Blossom Trail (% 407-855-5496; www.
gatorland.com). For more details on this classic Florida theme park, see Chapter 21.

Chapter 23
Going Beyond Orlando: 
Two Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Going on safari at Busch Gardens
 Lifting off at the Kennedy Space Center
E
ven with all Orlando has to offer (and if you’ve read chapters 12–20
you know there’s plenty), you may want to drive to the coast for a
day to enjoy a change of pace, some sugary sand beaches, and warm
waters. In addition to Florida’s spectacular beaches, two places are worth
going out of your way to visit: Busch Gardens in Tampa Bay and the
Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. The first is a combination
of SeaWorld, with its lush landscaping, relaxing atmosphere, and eco-
educational themes (see Chapter 20), Disney’s Animal Kingdom, with
its array of African wildlife; (see Chapter 15), and Universal’s Islands of
Adventure’s heart-pounding thrill rides. Kennedy Space Center is a unique
experience that you just can’t get in Orlando (unless Disney starts devel-
oping a space-shuttle program, which would be a stretch, even for them).
Trekking to Busch Gardens
When this Tampa theme park grew out of a brewery in the ’60s, the main
(and only) attractions were a bird show and free beer. (Some of you may
be wondering, who could ask for anything more?) Both are alive and well,
but Busch Gardens has grown into one of Florida’s top theme parks, filled
with coasters that can out-thrill even Universal Orlando, and wildlife,
eco-educational themes, and landscaping that all give the park a unique
and fascinating allure. 
Getting there
If you’re driving from Orlando, head west on I-4 to I-75. Go north on I-75
to Exit 265 (Fowler Avenue/University of South Florida). Bear left on the
exit ramp, and it will lead you directly onto Fowler Avenue. Proceed west
on Fowler Avenue to McKinley Avenue. (McKinley Avenue is the first light
past the main entrance to the University.) Turn left on McKinley. Proceed

south on McKinley to the parking lot and the main entrance to the park.
Parking costs $7 per day. The drive should take a little more than an
hour, depending on traffic.
SeaWorld (see Chapter 20) and Busch Gardens in Tampa, both owned
by Anheuser-Busch, have a shuttle service (% 800-221-1339) that offers
$10 round-trip tickets to get you from Orlando to Tampa and back. The
11⁄2- to 2-hour one-way shuttle runs daily and has five pick-up locations in
Orlando, including at Universal Orlando and on I-Drive (call for sched-
ules, reservations, and pick-up locations). The schedule allows about
seven hours at Busch Gardens. The service is free if you have a 5-park
FlexTicket. For more on the FlexTicket, see “Admission options,” which
follows. 
Most Orlando shuttle services will also take you to Busch Gardens.
See Chapter 8 for details on the city’s shuttle companies.
Visitor information
You can get information in advance of your visit by calling % 888-800-5447
or 813-987-5283 or heading online to the park’s excellent Web site, www.
buschgardens.com. Once inside the park, you can obtain information
from several visitor centers, or you can try the Expedition Africa Gift
Shop. Be sure to grab a guide map of the park when you enter.
Busch Garden is open daily, generally from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (though hours
can range from 9 a.m.–9 p.m. during peak season). The park’s hours change
seasonally, and seemingly on a whim, so be sure to confirm the hours for
the day you’re going by either calling or checking the Web site before
you depart. 
You can get information, save a few dollars, and avoid waiting in long
lines by buying your tickets to Busch Gardens at the privately owned
Tampa Bay Visitor Information Center, opposite the park at 3601 E.
Busch Blvd., at North Ednam Place (% 813-985-3601; www.hometown.
aol.com\tpabayinfoctr). Owner Jim Boggs worked for the park for
13 years and gives expert advice on how to get the most out of your visit.
Admission options
Busch Gardens has a number of admission schemes, though your
options are usually limited to two as a day visitor:
 One-day regular park admission costs $56 adults, $46 for kids 
3 to 9, children younger than 3 are admitted free. Prices do not
include the 7 percent sales tax.
 The FlexTicket is a multiday, multipark option that may work
for you if you plan on visiting Universal Orlando or SeaWorld
while in Orlando. The most economical way to see the various
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
318

“other-than-Disney” parks, you pay one price to visit any of the 
participating parks during a 14-day period. A five-park pass to
Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure, Wet ’n Wild,
SeaWorld, and Busch Gardens is $225 for adults and $190 for
kids. You can order the FlexTicket by calling % 888-800-5447
or by going to www.buschgardens.com. For more on the other
FlexTicket parks, see Chapters 18 through 21.
Busch Gardens occasionally runs other discount admissions specials and
offers a host of other multiday and annual-pass selections (fun cards and
the like). If you plan on spending more time in Tampa and want some
more details on these options, call % 888-800-5447 or 813-987-5283 or
check the Web at www.buschgardens.com.
Seeing the park
Busch Gardens is older than Walt Disney World and, over the years, has
managed to age quite well. This park has eight distinctive areas, each of
which has its own theme, animals, live entertainment, thrill rides, kiddie
attractions, dining, and shopping. A Skyride cable car soars over the park,
offering a bird’s-eye view of it all. Two things set Busch Gardens apart
from its nearest rival (Disney’s Animal Kingdom): its vast array of thrill
rides (some of best in the country) and the accessibility of its wildlife.
Chasing thrills
Busch Gardens has six — count ’em, SIX!! — roller coasters (and that
doesn’t include the flume and rapids rides) to keep your adrenaline
pumping and stomach jumping. New to the collection is SheiKra, and
she’s a doozie. The first of its kind in the Americas (and only the third in
the world of its kind, though, of course, this one’s higher and faster), this
dive coaster hurtles you 90 degrees straight down at speeds reaching
70 mph and 4Gs. If you manage to survive that, its on to a rolling loop,
and a second 90 degree drop plummeting you 138 feet through an under-
ground tunnel. Other unexpected thrills await you throughout the three
minute adventure. As you may expect, there is a height restriction of
54 inches to ride this one. 
The Gwazi is a wooden wonder named for a fabled African lion with a
tiger’s head. This $10-million ride slowly climbs to 90 feet, before turn-
ing, twisting, diving, and va-rrroommming to speeds of 50 mph — enough
to give you air time (also known as weightlessness). Fact is, these twin
coasters, the Lion and the Tiger, provide 2 minutes and 20 seconds of
thrills and chills, steep-banked curves, and bobsled maneuvers. At six
points on the ride, you’re certain you’re going to slam the other coaster
as you hit 3.5Gs. 
There’s a 48-inch minimum height, and the 15-inch seat is smaller than an
airline seat, so it’s a tight squeeze for thin folks and the next best thing
to misery for larger models.
Chapter 23: Going Beyond Orlando: Two Day Trips 319

Busch’s other four roller coasters are made of steel. Kumba is a 143-
foot-high number that covers 4,000 feet of track at 60 mph. It jerks you
with sudden turns and has a 54-inch height minimum. Montu musses
your hair at speeds exceeding 60 mph while the G-force keeps you 
plastered to your seat (another 54-inch minimum). The Python is a tad
tamer, running through a double-spiraling corkscrew and a 70-foot
plunge (48-inch minimum). The Scorpion offers a high-speed 60-foot
drop and 360-degree loop (42-inch minimum).
The park’s water rides are welcome relief from the summer heat.
Tanganyika Tidal Wave (48-inch height minimum) is a steep flume,
while Congo River Rapids (42-inch height minimum) is similar to
Kali River Rapids in Animal Kingdom (see Chapter 15).
Meeting animals and seeing shows
Busch Gardens has several thousand animals living in very naturalistic
environments that continue the park’s African theme. Most authentic
is the 80-acre Serengeti Plain, strongly reminiscent of the real Serengeti
of Tanzania and Kenya, upon which zebras, giraffes, and other animals
graze. Unlike the animals on the real Serengeti, however, the grazing 
animals have nothing to fear from lions, hyenas, crocodiles, and other
predators, which are confined to enclosures — as are hippos and ele-
phants. Busch’s critters have fewer places to hide and, therefore, are
much easier to see than those at Animal Kingdom (see Chapter 15). 
Twenty-six acres of the Serengeti Plain are devoted to free-roaming white
rhinos. Rhino Rally, a Land Rover tour through the plains, takes up to
16 passengers on a very bumpy, seven-minute journey where the white
rhinos, Asian elephants, cape buffaloes, alligators, antelopes, and other
animals roam. There are, of course, a few catches along the way to make
the ride a bit more exciting. If you can handle the bumps, it’s a pretty
good ride, and one of the few that’s appropriate for almost all ages.
Nairobi’s Myombe Reserve is home to gorillas; this area also has a baby-
animal nursery, petting zoo, turtle and reptile displays, and an elephant
exhibit. Congo features rare white Bengal tigers.
In addition to the animals, your kids will love Land of the Dragons, which
has slides, a tree house, and rides. Kids also like the sandy dig site at
King Tut’s Tomb and the friendly lorikeets of Lory Landing. Kids especially
love the 22-minute R.L. Stine’s Haunted Lighthouse film, a family-friendly
show that combines sensory effects and 3-D film.
And did I mention the free beer if you’re 21 or older? This is an
Anheuser-Busch park you know. You can sample their products 
at the Hospitality House.
Special tours and options
Although you get close to Busch Garden’s predators, hippos, and elephants
in their glass-walled enclosures with a regular admission, the only way
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
320

to mingle with the grazers is on a tour. Here are the best the park offers
(note that children must be at least age 5 to participate in any of them):
 For an extra $30 to $34 (depending on the season) over the admis-
sion price, you can go on the 30-minute, guided Serengeti Safari
tour, which feature an extra close look and a chance to feed giraffes,
gazelles, and more (from the back of a flatbed truck). If you’re eager
for a hands-on wildlife experience, the safari is worth the extra
money. You can make reservations for the first tour of the day at
the Expedition Africa Gift Shop or by calling % 813-984-4043, but
the midday and afternoon tours are first-come, first-served. Kids
must be older than 5 years old to participate. 
 The 5-hour Guided Adventure tour gives you the safari, front-of-
the-line access to shows and rides, plus lunch, for $90 above park
admission. The Elite Adventure Tours includes the above plus free
parking, free bottled water on the tour, merchandise discounts,
VIP seating at shows, and two meals ($180 per person plus park
admission). If you want to participate, reserve in advance by
calling % 813-984-4043 or online at www.buschgardens.com. 
Blasting Off to John F. Kennedy Space Center
Each time a space shuttle blasts into the heavens, someone you know
wishes he or she could be an astronaut. Heck — maybe it’s you. You can
live out your childhood fantasies at the Kennedy Space Center located
on the so-called “Space Coast” at Cape Canaveral. 
Getting there
Though there are shuttles from Orlando to Cape Canaveral, this area really
demands a car in order to be seen properly. The Center is an easy hour’s
drive from Orlando via the BeeLine Expressway (Highway 528, a toll road).
Take the S.R. 407 exit going to Kennedy Space Center and Titusville and
continue on S.R. 407 until it dead ends into S.R. 405. Turn right (east)
onto S.R. 405 and follow the signs for Kennedy Space Center. You will
travel approximately 9 miles on S.R. 405. The KSC Visitor Complex will
be on your right. Parking is free.
Visitor information
For information before you leave home, call % 321-449-4444 or check out
the Center’s Web site at www.kennedyspacecenter.com. For general infor-
mation about the Space Coast, contact the Florida Space Coast Office of
Tourism/Brevard County Tourist Development Council by calling % 800-
872-1969 or 321-868-1126; or by surfing the Web to www.space-coast.com.
The Visitor Complex is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and the Astronaut
Hall of Fame is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily (except Christmas and
select launch days). Always call to confirm these hours before you set
out for Cape Canaveral. 
Chapter 23: Going Beyond Orlando: Two Day Trips 321

Admission options
You have two main ticket options:
 Standard Admission includes admission to the Kennedy Space
Center, several IMAX films, and access to exhibits and shows. It
costs $30 adults and $20 kids 3 to 11. 
 A Maximum Admission pass includes admission to the Kennedy
Space Center, several IMAX films, access to exhibits and shows,
entrance to the Astronaut Hall of Fame, and a chance to ride in
an interactive space simulator. It costs $37 for adults and $27 for
kids 3 to 11. You can purchase this pass (and others) online at
www.kennedyspacecenter.com.
You can also purchase Hall of Fame admission only for $17 adult, $13
children. A 12-month pass runs $46 adult, $30 children. The ATX, or
Astronaut Training Experience (see below), costs $225. 
Touring the Center
Whether you’re a space buff or not, you’ll appreciate the sheer grandeur
of the facilities and technological achievements displayed at NASA’s pri-
mary space-launch facility. Highlights of the Center include trips down
memory lane and glances into the future of space exploration. You also
explore the history of manned flights, beginning with the wild ride of
the late Alan Shepard (1961) and Neil Armstrong’s 1969 moonwalk.
The Center also has dual 51⁄2-story, 3-D IMAX theaters that reverberate
with special effects. You’ll need at least a full day to see and do every-
thing here.
Begin your visit at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, which
has real NASA rockets and the actual Mercury Mission Control Room
from the 1960s. You’ll find several hands-on activities for kids, including
a chance to meet a real astronaut, as well as several dining venues and a
shop selling a variety of space memorabilia and souvenirs. Because this
privately operated complex has been undergoing an ambitious $130 mil-
lion renovation and expansion, check to see whether it has changed its
tours and exhibits before visiting.
Bus tours of the complex (included with your admission) run contin-
uously. Plan to take the tour early in your visit and be sure to hit the
restrooms before boarding the bus — there’s only one out on the tour.
You can get off at the LC-39 Observation Gantry, which has a 360-degree
view of shuttle launch pads; the International Space Station Center,
where scientists and engineers prepare additions to the space station
now in orbit; and the Apollo/Saturn V Center, which includes artifacts,
photos, interactive exhibits, and the 363-foot-tall Saturn V rocket.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
322

Don’t miss the Astronaut Memorial, a moving black-granite monument
that has the names of the U.S. astronauts who have died on missions or
while in training. The 60-ton structure rotates on a track that follows the
movement of the sun (on clear days, of course), causing the names to
stand out above a brilliant reflection of the sky.
The Astronaut Hall of Fame, a separate attraction at the Kennedy Space
Center Visitor Center, includes displays, exhibits, and tributes to the
heroes of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs. There’s also a
collection of spacecraft, including a Mercury 7 capsule, a Gemini training
capsule, and an Apollo 14 command module. And in Simulator Station,
guests can experience the pressure of four times the force of gravity,
ride a rover across Mars, and land a space shuttle.
On launch days, the Center is closed at least part of the day. Although
launch days aren’t good times to see the Center, they’re great occasions
to observe history in the making. Schedules for launch tickets entitling
you to admission to the Center for the shortened operating hours, plus
at least a two-hour excursion to NASA Parkway to see the liftoff, are avail-
able by calling % 321-449-4444. You must pick up tickets, available five
days prior to the launch, on site. 
Special tours and options
The Kennedy Space Center offers a number of special programs and tours
to visitors. Here are a few that will delight any wannabe-astronauts or
avid space buffs:
 The ultrapopular Lunch with an Astronaut program gives visitors
the chance to enjoy an out-of-this-world experience: lunch with an
actual astronaut. The opportunity is available at the Center every
day during lunch hours. Past participants have included John Glenn,
Jim Lovell, and Wally Schirra. Seating is limited, so be sure to reserve
well in advance by calling % 321-449-4400 or heading online to
www.kennedyspacecenter.com. The program costs $20 for adults
and $13 for kids 3 to 11 in addition to the cost of admission to the
Center.
 The Cape Canaveral Then and Now tour includes a visit to the
first launch sites, the Air Force Museum, and the Missile Museum.
The tour costs $22 adult and $16 kids 3 to 11. 
 On the 90-minute NASA Up Close tour, a space program expert
guides you through the intricacies of the space-shuttle program
and gives you an up-close look at the space shuttle launch pads.
The tour almost always sells out, so reserve in advance of your trip
by calling % 321-449-4400 or going online to www.kennedyspace
center.com. The tour costs $22 adults and $16 kids 3 to 11 in
addition to the cost of admission.

of you who still have the pizzazz for a nighttime adventure

in Orlando, and this part of the book shows you how.

Taking in the Dinner Shows
In This Chapter
 Seeing Orlando’s best dinner shows
 Getting tickets for everything else
I
f a day at the theme parks isn’t enough to satisfy your appetite for
entertainment, Orlando’s dinner theaters serve up a rather diverse
menu of amusements to keep you entertained as you dine. In this chap-
ter, I tell you about dinner shows where you can solve a “murder,” learn
to hula, or cheer on a knight at a medieval joust. 
Getting the Inside Scoop on Orlando
Dinner Theater
Orlando’s busy dinner-show scene is far different than those you find in
high-flying cultural centers such as Paris, New York, and London. Walt
Disney World and Orlando feature family-oriented fun and fanfare rather
than critically acclaimed dramatic performances. Most shows focus on
entertaining the city’s top VIPs: the kids. Expect action, adventure, and
corny humor, all generally performed in a very loud stadium setting
where the kids can scream to their hearts content. 
Did you ever notice that you never see dinner-shows listed in the restau-
rant section? Ever wonder why? It’s not the dinner you’re going for.
Eating adds its own ingredient of adventure to Orlando’s dinner-theater
experience. The fare is right off the rubber chicken circuit. The meals
usually consist of a choice of two or three generic entrees (often over-
cooked) and school-lunch caliber side dishes. This may very well
explain why some theaters serve free wine and beer after you’re been
seated — to dull your palate before dinner is served. 
The prices of the shows that I list in this section include your meal and
the aforementioned wine and beer (soda is available, too) but not tax or
tips, unless otherwise noted.

You can often find discount coupons to the dinner shows inside the
tourist magazines distributed in the tourist information centers, hotel
lobbies, gas stations, and sometimes on the listed Web sites. A good
place to look for discounted tickets for the dinner theaters is the
Orlando CVB Web site (www.orlandoinfo.com). 
For all dinner shows, advance reservations are strongly recommended. 
And when it comes to Walt Disney World dinner shows, always, always,
always, make an Advanced Dining Reservation, % 407-939-3463. (See
Chapter 10 for more about Advanced Dining Reservations.) Disney’s
shows fill up fast, often months in advance for weekend performances
and during peak vacation seasons and holidays. I’ve actually spent sev-
eral days trying to make reservations (for the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical
Review), calling the very minute the phone lines opened (usually around
7 a.m.) about 1 year in advance and it took four days to finally get a
reservation — and I didn’t get the day or the time I would have liked. 
Arabian Nights
Kissimmee
If you’re a horse fan, this show is a winner. It stars many of the most 
popular breeds, from chiseled Arabians to hard-driving quarter horses to
beefcake Belgians. They giddy-up through performances that include trick
riding, chariot races, a little slapstick comedy, and bareback daredevils.
The premise of the show is the elaborate wedding of the prince and
princess — and what wedding would be complete without an uninvited
guest? — and so begins the adventure. Locals rate it No. 1 among Orlando
dinner shows. On most nights, the performance opens with a ground
trainer working one-on-one with a black stallion. The dinner, served during
the two-hour show, includes salad, a choice of prime rib, grilled chicken,
chicken tenders, chopped steak, or vegetable lasagna, vegetables, garlic
mashed potatoes, rolls, and wedding cake for dessert. Unlimited beer,
wine, or soda pop comes with the meal. 
The Web site usually offers a discount on tickets purchased online.

Dolly Parton’s Dixie Stampede
Lake Buena Vista
What do you get when you combine 32 horses, a slew of talented riders and
singers, and Dolly’s family-friendly vision of the Civil War? A down-home
battle of the North and South featuring corny jokes and plenty of audience
interaction. You’ll try to resist, but it’ll win you over. Come early for enter-
tainment by Gary, the original Electric Cowboy. The all-inclusive price

includes unlimited soda, tea, beer, and wine during the meal, as well as a
four-course, Southern-style meal (rotisserie chicken and barbecued pork
or lasagna, corn on the cob, herb potato, and a turnover for dessert) — the
creamed vegetable soup is surprisingly outstanding. Be sure to take a
gander at the horse stables after the show.

Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue
Walt Disney World
This show at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground (see
Chapter 9 for more on this hotel) is Disney’s most popular, so make
Advanced Dining Reservations as early as possible. The reward: You feast
on a down-home, all-you-can-eat barbecue (fried chicken, smoked ribs,
salad, corn on the cob, baked beans, bread, salad, strawberry shortcake,
and your choice of coffee, tea, beer, wine, sangria, or soda) all served up
family style in tin buckets. While you stuff yourself silly in Pioneer Hall,
performers in 1890s garb lead you in a foot-stomping, hand-clapping high-
energy show that includes plenty of jokes that you haven’t heard since 
elementary school, but somehow seem just as funny now. The audience is
quickly caught up in all the hoopla, and even the most skeptical find them-
selves having plenty of fun. Although the songs and skits are a bit corny,
the talent is absolutely stellar.
If you catch one of the early shows, consider sticking around for the
Electrical Water Pageant at 9:45 p.m., viewed from the Fort Wilderness
Beach.
Audience participation is heavily encouraged, and the cast is more than
happy to help you single out your friends. 
Upon arriving at Fort Wilderness, you’ll need to park in the guest lot and
take the resort’s internal bus system to Pioneer Hall where the show is
held. Add at least an extra half-hour to your traveling time because of this.
Reservations can be made up to two years in advance. Your travel dates
will determine how far in advance to call — during holidays, spring break,
and summers you should make reservations as early as possible. The
entire bill must be paid when making the reservation, but as long as you
call at least 48 hours prior to the day of your reservation, you will be
refunded your entire payment if you find you have to cancel.

Makahiki Luau
SeaWorld
SeaWorld’s entry on the Orlando dinner circuit starts with the arrival of the
tribal chief via boat, with a ceremonial progression leading the audience
into a theater located in the Seafire Inn at the park’s Waterfront district
(see Chapter 20 for more on the theme park). Throughout the night, you
experience the ancient customs, rhythmic music and dance, authentic cos-
tumes, and family-style dining on Polynesian-influenced cuisine that
includes tropical fruit, mahimahi, sweet-and-sour pork, Hawaiian chicken,
island stir-fried vegetables, fried rice, dessert, and beverages, including
one free cocktail. My only complaint is that the ventilation in the theater
wasn’t adequate for all the smoke used during the show. At one point, sit-
ting at one of the front tables, I couldn’t see anything, not even my food.
See map p. 291. 7007 SeaWorld Dr. (inside The Waterfront at SeaWorld). % 800-327-

Medieval Times
Kissimmee
Orlando has one of eight Medieval Times shows in the United States and
Canada. Inside, guests gorge themselves on garlic bread, barbecued spare
ribs, herb-roasted chicken, vegetable soup, appetizers, herb-roasted pota-
toes, a pastry dessert, and beverages, including beer. But because this
show is set in the 11th century, you eat with your fingers from metal plates
while knights mounted on Andalusian horses run around the arena, joust-
ing and clanging to please the fair maidens. Arrive 30 minutes to allow time
to tour the Medieval Village, a re-created Middle Ages settlement ($3.50
per person). There are plenty of opportunities to part with your cash,
including photos and toys, so set your limits ahead of time or the evening
can wind up costing a bundle.

MurderWatch Mystery Theatre
Lake Buena Vista
Mystery lovers rejoice. The game’s afoot every Saturday night at this 
all-you-can-eat buffet, which offers beef, chicken, fish, and a separate chil-
dren’s buffet while diners try to solve a mystery. The proceedings take
place in Baskerville’s restaurant, which has 19th-century Edwardian décor
and houses a Sherlock Holmes museum. This somewhat sophisticated
offering is one of the city’s best.

Pirates Dinner Adventure
International Drive Area
The special-effects show at this theater includes a full-size ship in a
300,000-gallon lagoon, circus-style aerial acts, a lot of music, plenty of
swordfights by swashbuckling pirates, and a little drama. Dinner includes
an appetizer buffet with the preshow, followed by roast chicken and beef,
rice, vegetables, dessert, and coffee. After the show, you’re invited to the
Buccaneer Bash dance party where you can mingle with cast members.
This show gets somewhat mixed reviews; the more favorable come from
kids with an affinity for pirates and swordfights (of which there’s plenty).
The arena is smaller than some of the others in the area, which makes it a
slightly friendlier experience overall.

Sleuths Mystery Dinner Theater
International Drive Area
While catering more to an adult crowd (though they do offer two special
afternoon versions for kids), the mysteries solved here are absolutely
hilarious whodunits. In a smaller, more-intimate theater guests are seated
around small tables while enjoying the show. After some of the characters
serve hot and cold hors d’oeuvres to guests, the show begins. Dinner is
served between acts and includes a choice of Cornish game hen, herb
stuffing, baked potato, vegetables, and cranberry sauce; prime rib (for an
additional $3) with baked potato and vegetables; or four-cheese lasagna
(with or without meatballs), vegetables, and garlic bread, plus dessert and
unlimited beer, wine, and soft drinks. Guests are encouraged to discuss
the clues to solve the murder. The more the audience participates (which
often seems directly related to the amount of alcohol they consume), the
more amusing the show can be. Eleven unique mysteries keep guests
coming back for more. 
Discounts are often available online as well as in many of the tourist 
publications.

Spirit of Aloha Dinner Show
Walt Disney World
Although not quite as much in demand as the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical
Revue, Disney’s Polynesian Resort (see Chapter 9 for more on the hotel)
presents a delightful two-hour show, which comes across like a big neigh-
borhood party with an island flair. The luau features Tahitian, Samoan,
Hawaiian, and Polynesian singers, drummers, and dancers who entertain
you while you feast on a menu that includes tropical appetizers, Lanai-
roasted chicken, pork ribs, sliced pineapple, Polynesian wild rice,
Polynesian-style bread, South Seas vegetables, dessert, wine, beer, and
other beverages. Kids can eat mac ’n’ cheese, hot dogs, chicken nuggets,
or PB&J if they prefer. The show takes place five nights a week in an open-
air theater (dress for nighttime weather) with candlelit tables, red-flame
lanterns, and tapa cloth paintings on the walls.
Reservations should be made at least 60 to 90 days in advance (but can
be made up to two years in advance), especially during peak periods such
as summer and holidays. Payment must be made in full at the time of the
reservation, but you can cancel up to 48 hours prior to your scheduled
show for a full refund.

Getting Information and Tickets
For evening entertainment other than the dinner shows, dozens of rock,
rap, jazz, pop, country, blues, and folk stars are in town during any given
week in Orlando. You can find schedules in the Orlando Sentinel’s
Calendar section, published every Friday and available online at www.
orlandosentinel.com. The Orlando Weekly’s Calendar section (www.
orlandoweekly.com) is another good source of information for live-
music events, including club schedules. 
Ticketmaster is the key reservations player for most major events in
Orlando, including concerts, shows, and pro-sports events. If you know
of an event that’s happening while you’re in town, check first with your
hometown Ticketmaster outlets to see whether they sell tickets for
the event. (If you live as close as Miami or Atlanta, they probably do.)
Otherwise, call the Ticketmaster outlet in Orlando at % 877-803-7073
or 407-839-3900, or go to its Web site at www.ticketmaster.com.
You can also get additional event information and can often order tickets
from the Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau
(% 407-363-5872; www.orlandoinfo.com).

Hitting the Clubs and Bars
In This Chapter
 Rocking the night away at Walt Disney World
 Cruising the clubs at CityWalk
 Exploring hot spots inside Orlando’s hotels
 Finding a few more places to party
A
lthough Orlando has a reputation as a daylight destination, its
nighttime offerings continue to grow as fun-seekers aren’t ready
to call it quits after a day at the parks.
Clubs such as Mannequins and House of Blues at Pleasure Island and
Disney’s West Side rock well into the wee hours. Universal Orlando’s
CityWalk entertainment district features nightspots such as the groove
and CityJazz. 
Many of the clubs that I list in this chapter are open to anyone 18 or
older, but remember: The minimum drinking age in Florida is 21, and
the clubs will check your ID.
Enjoying the Pleasures of Pleasure Island
This 6-acre entertainment district is the home of several clubs, bars,
and restaurants. You can enter the complex for free if you just want to
take in the ambience but don’t plan to enter any of the clubs. Admission
to a single club (you can choose from all but the Comedy Club and the
Adventurers Club) is $11, including tax. A single-day pass that allows you
to hop from club to club, is $21, plus tax. (If you purchase the Magic Plus
Pack, you can choose admission to Pleasure Island’s clubs as part of the
package — see Chapter 11 for information on Disney’s admission passes.)
Self-parking is free. For information on Pleasure Island, call % 407-939-
2648 or check out Disney’s Web site at www.disneyworld.com.
The island is designed to look like an abandoned waterfront industrial
district with clubs in its lofts and warehouses. But the streets are deco-
rated with brightly colored lights and balloons, giving it a carnivalesque
feel. After the clubs open, loud music blasts, a few scantily clad dancers
gyrate on outdoor stages, and alcohol is served on the streets. Every

evening at Pleasure Island ends with a New Year’s Eve celebration at
midnight — noisemakers, confetti, lights, countdown, the works. I
wouldn’t suggest bringing along the kids too late into the evening, as
much of the partying is right in the streets — with crowds wandering
(sometimes not so steadily) about. 
Mannequins Dance Palace is Pleasure Island’s main event. It’s a high-
energy club with a big, rotating dance floor. Just watching the inebriated
trying to get on and off the spinning surface can be an evening’s worth of
entertainment. Being a local favorite makes the club hard to get into, so
arrive early, especially on weekends. Three levels of bars and mixing
space are adorned with elaborately dressed mannequins. The DJ plays
contemporary tunes loudly enough to wake the dead.
You must be 21 to enter, and the staff is very serious about that.
The Adventurers Club is a multistory building that, according to WDW
legend, was designed to be the library and archaeological trophy room for
Pleasure Island founder and explorer, Merriweather Adam Pleasure, who
was lost at sea in 1941. The club is decorated with early aviation photos,
hunting trophies, and a mounted yakoose — a half yak, half moose that
speaks, regardless of whether you’re drinking. Also on hand are Pleasure’s
zany band of globetrotting friends and servants, played by skilled actors
who interact with guests while staying in character. Improvisational
comedy and cabaret shows are performed in the library. You can easily
hang out here all night, sipping potent tropical drinks in the library or the
bar, where elephant-foot barstools rise and sink mysteriously. 
If you’re a fan of the BET Cable Network, you’ll probably love BET
Soundstage (% 407-934-7666), which offers traditional R&B and the
rhyme of hip-hop, with the occasional Latin-music night thrown in here
and there. You can dance on an expansive floor or kick back on an out-
door terrace. Cover charge for the Soundstage is included in the Pleasure
Island single-day ticket, except for major concerts.
A very talented troupe — the Who, What and Warehouse Players — is
the main event at the Comedy Warehouse. The group performs 45-minute
improvisational shows based on audience suggestions. It does five shows
a night. Remember that you’re in Disney, so the comedy here is pretty
much squeaky clean.
Patent leather and polyester rule at 8Trax, a 1970s-style disco where
50 TV screens air diverse shows and videos over the dance floor. A DJ
plays everything from “YMCA” to “The Hustle.” Some nights he may
even dig into the music of the ’80s for a few dance gems. 
What was once the Pleasure Island Jazz Club has been replaced
by Raglan Road, an Irish pub featuring traditional Irish music and 
storytelling.

If your taste in live music runs more to the Top-40 and rock veins, both
the Rock ’n’ Roll Beach Club and the outdoor West End Stage will sat-
isfy your needs.
Pleasure Island’s Motion, tries hard to be hip and trendy but still fea-
tures a mix of Top-40 tunes and alternative rock. It’s a hyperactive club
that appeals to the T-shirt and sneakers theme-park crowd. Moody blue
lighting makes you believe you’re dancing the night away in deep space,
but the effect’s more like . . . well, a cool dance floor.
Chapter 25: Hitting the Clubs and Bars

Exploring Downtown Disney’s West Side
Immediately adjacent to Pleasure Island, Disney’s West Side is a district
where you’ll find clubs, restaurants, and DisneyQuest (see Chapter 16).
Singer Gloria Estefan and her husband, Emilio, created Bongo’s Cuban
Café (% 407-828-0999; www.bongoscubancafe.com), an eatery/
nightspot where a Desi Arnaz look-alike may show up to croon a few
tunes. The upbeat salsa music makes this place noisy, so flee to the
patio or upstairs if you want privacy. All in all, this isn’t one of Florida’s
better Cuban restaurants, so you’re better off coming for the atmos-
phere rather than the food (which will run you about $10–$26). The Café
is open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. and doesn’t take reservations. You
can also find plenty of free self-parking.
Cirque du Soleil isn’t your ordinary circus. It doesn’t have any lions,
tigers, or bears. But you won’t feel cheated. This “Circus of the Sun” is
nonstop energy. At times, it seems as if all 64 performers are on stage
simultaneously, especially during the frenetic trampoline routine. Trapeze
artists, high-wire walkers, an airborne gymnast, a posing strongman,
mimes, and two clowns cement a show called La Nouba into a five-star
performance. But if you’re on a tight budget, this is gut-check time:
Can you blow one or two day’s entertainment budget on 90 minutes
of fun? If you can, it’ll be worth the splurge. The two ticket categories
are $87 for adults and $65 for kids 3 to 9 (plus tax) for center of the 
theater seats, and $75 and $56, respectively, to the right and left of the
stage. Don’t assume the cheaper seats are the worst — there’s barely a
bad seat to be had in this well-designed theater. Shows are at 6 and 9 p.m.
five nights a week, but times and nights vary, and sometimes a matinee
is scheduled, so call ahead (% 407-939-7600) or check the show’s Web
site (www.cirquedusoleil.com) for information and tickets. 
Plus-sized guests may find the seating a bit narrow, so request a folding
chair upon arrival.
The rafters in the House of Blues literally shake with rhythm and blues.
The House is decorated with folk art, buttons, and bottle caps, and the
patio has a view of the bay. If you like spicy food, offerings such as jam-
balaya and gumbo ($9–$25) are respectable. Sunday’s Gospel Brunch
($30 for adults and $15 for kids 3–12) has foot-stomping music served
with decent food (omelets, beef, jalapeño smashed potatoes, cheese
grits, and sausage among meats and other items). Brunch is the only
time you can make reservations. Guests dining before attending a show
that night are often eligible for early admission, which is handy during
the general-admission shows. Ask your server for details, call % 407-
934-2583, or go to www.hob.com. House of Blues is open daily from
11 a.m. to 2 a.m. and offers free self-parking.

Strolling Along Disney’s BoardWalk
Part of the same-named resort (see Chapter 9), the BoardWalk is home
to several clubs and restaurants and is a great place for strolling and
people-watching. Street performers sing, dance, juggle, and make a little
magic most evenings. It has something of a midway atmosphere reminis-
cent of Atlantic City’s heyday. Three standout options here include:
 Atlantic Dance features Top-40 and ’80s dance hits Tuesdays
through Thursdays and live bands on Friday and Saturday nights.
It’s open to everyone 21 and older from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., and admis-
sion is free.
 The rustic, saloon-style Jellyrolls offers dueling pianos. Strictly for
the over-21 set, it’s open daily from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. There’s a $5
cover. 
 If you need a game fix, ESPN Sports has 90 TV screens (there are
a few even inside the bathrooms!), a full-service bar, food, and a
small arcade, all without a cover charge. It’s the sports mecca in
town.
You can get information on all of the spots listed here by calling % 407-
939-3463 or going to www.disneyworld.com.
Dancing the Night Away at CityWalk
Universal’s answer to Pleasure Island is a two-level collection of clubs
and restaurants located between its two theme parks. CityWalk (% 407-
363-8000; www.universalorlando.com or www.citywalk.com) is open
from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily. Although no admission is charged, several
clubs have cover charges after 5 or 6 p.m., sometimes as late as 8 or
9 p.m. CityWalk also offers party passes. A pass to all clubs is $10 plus
tax; for $13 plus tax, you get a movie at Universal Cineplex (% 407-354-
5998). Universal also offers free club access to those who buy multiday
theme-park tickets (see Chapters 18 and 19). Daytime parking in the
Universal Orlando garages costs $8, but parking is free after 6 p.m.
Save your parking stub if attending a movie at the Universal Cineplex
before 6 p.m. The theater will allow you to apply the $8 parking fee
toward a concession-stand purchase any time that same day.
Bob Marley — A Tribute to Freedom (% 407-224-3663; www.bob
marley.com) has architecture said to replicate Marley’s home in
Kingston, Jamaica. Local and national reggae bands perform frequently.
Light Jamaican fare is served under umbrellas. The club is open daily from
4 p.m. to 2 a.m. There’s a cover of $5 after 8 p.m.; cover prices increase for
concerts on special nights. You must be 21 or older after 10 p.m.

CityWalk
Part VI: Living It Up After Dark: Orlando Nightlife 
340
CityJazz (% 407-224-2189) has a cover charge that includes the
Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame (with memorabilia from Louis Armstrong,
Ella Fitzgerald, and other greats) and the Thelonious Monk Institute
of Jazz, a performance venue that’s also the site of jazz workshops.
You can browse through 500 pieces of memorabilia marching through
Dixieland, swing, bebop, and modern jazz. Nationally acclaimed acts per-
form frequently. Thursday through Saturday, the club occasionally hosts
national and local comics via special Bonkers Comedy Club shows. On
the food side, look for tapas, sushi, and lamb chops. It’s open Sunday
through Thursday from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. and Friday and Saturday from
7 p.m. to 2 a.m. Cover charge is $5 (more for special events). You must
be 18 to enter.
CityWalk’s answer to Pleasure Island’s Mannequins is the groove
(% 407-363-8000); it’s not as crowded here, except on the occasional
all-ages teen night, when you’ll want to stay as far away from the place

as possible. The sound system is loud, and the dance floor is in a room
gleaming with chrome. Music-wise, the groove features hip-hop, jazz
fusion, techno, and alternative. A DJ plays tunes on nights when record-
ing artists aren’t booked. Each of the club’s three color-themed lounges
has a bar and a specialty drink to fit its ambience (the spacey Blue one
is the coolest, though the Red is kind of sexy in a bordello sort of way).
You must be at least 21 to enter (except for the special teen events), and it
will cost you a cover charge of $5. The club is open from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
sometimes later.
CityWalk’s Hard Rock Cafe is the largest in the world, and the adjoining
Hard Rock Live (% 407-351-5483; www.hardrock.com) is the first con-
cert hall bearing the name. The cafe also has a free exhibit area, where
you can browse through displays of rock memorabilia, including the
platform heels and leather jumpsuits of KISS. Concert charges vary by
act, and MTV often films concert specials here. The cafe is open daily
from 11 a.m. to midnight.
Flip-flops and flowered shirts equal Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville
(% 407-224-2155). Tunes are piped through the building during the day-
time, with a Jimmy sound-alike strumming on the back porch around dusk.
Inside, there’s nightly live entertainment, though nothing extraordinary.
Bar-wise, you have three options. The Volcano erupts (I’m not kidding)
killer margaritas; the Land Shark has fins swimming around the ceiling;
and the 12 Volt, is, well, a little electrifying. The menu screams “Key West!”
It includes cheeseburgers in paradise, mahimahi, and Key lime pie.
See Chapter 10 for more on the food front. Margaritaville is open from
11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., and there’s a $5 cover after 10 p.m.
The two-level Latin Quarter (% 407-224-3663) restaurant/club offers
you a chance to absorb the salsa-and-samba culture and cuisine of 21
Latin nations. It’s filled with the music of the Meringue and the Mambo,
with a little Latin rock thrown in for good measure. The sound system is
loud enough to blow you into the next county. The club’s open Monday
through Friday from 5 p.m. until 2 a.m., Saturday and Sunday from noon
until 2 a.m. There’s a $5 to $10 cover charged after 9 p.m., depending on
the evening’s entertainment.
An arcade has replaced the live-music stage at the Motown Café, which
is now known as Decades (% 407-224-3663), but you can still refuel on
steaks, ribs, and BBQ ($8–$18) surrounded by memorabilia recalling
famous people, movies, and music from the past 40 years. It’s open daily
for dinner at 4 p.m., Saturday and Sunday at 11:30 am for lunch. A DJ
plays on Friday and Saturday nights, when there’s a cover of $5.
Guessing the focus of a place that has a one-page food menu and a book-
let filled with drinks doesn’t take a genius. Just like the French Quarter’s
version, drinking is the highlight at Pat O’Brien’s (% 407-363-8000).
You can enjoy dueling pianos and a flame-throwing fountain while you
suck down the signature drink — the Hurricane. No one younger than
Chapter 25: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 341

21 is permitted after 9 p.m. Pat O’ Brien’s offers a limited menu of sand-
wiches, snacks, and treats like jambalaya and shrimp Creole, which sets
you back $8 to $10. Hours are 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., and a cover of $5 is charged
after 9 p.m.
Locating the Best Hotel Lounges
Some of Orlando’s best nightlife is located in its hotels. Even the locals
head to the resort areas for fun after dark. If you’re staying at one of the
places listed here, you can do an evening on the town without ever get-
ting behind the wheel. None of the following charges a cover.
Mizner’s at Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa has a pianist or band
that alternates evenings in a lounge with an elegant library look (% 407-
824-3000). Outer Rim in the Contemporary Resort (% 407-824-1000)
is trendy and close to the monorail. Kimono’s in the Walt Disney World
Swan transforms into a karaoke bar after 8:30 p.m. (% 407-934-4000).
The Laughing Kookaburra Good Time Bar in the Wyndham Palace,
Lake Buena Vista (% 407-827-2727), has dancing and live music or a DJ
most nights. The Top of the Palace Lounge, also at the Wyndham Palace
(% 407-827-2727), has a great view of Disney fireworks. Baskerville’s
in the Grosvenor Resort Hotel, Lake Buena Vista (% 407-827-6534), 
features the MurderWatch Mystery Theater on Saturday nights (see
Chapter 24). And Auggie’s Jammin’ Piano Bar offers dueling pianos at
9 p.m. nightly at the Gaylord Palms Resort (% 407-586-0000).
Exploring Orlando’s Other Hot Spots
Downtown Orlando is home to a number of clubs and bars, and offers a
vibrant nightlife. Here’s my list of favorites:
 Club at Firestone, 578 N. Orange Ave., (% 407-426-0005; www.club
atfirestone.com), is home to a revolving list of parties that take
place each day of the week. It continuously books some of the best
DJs in the dance music scene to spin, especially on Saturdays for
the popular “gay night” party. The cover ranges from free to $10,
depending on the event. It’s open daily from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.
 Locals perform at the 200-seat SAK Comedy Lab, 380 W. Amelia St.
(% 407-648-0001; www.sak.com), which offers several performances
weekly. Favorite acts include Duel of Fools, where two teams face off
in improvised scenes based on suggestions from the audience, and
Lab Rats, where students play in improv formats. Admission costs
$5 to $13. Shows usually are Tuesday and Wednesday at 9 p.m. and
Thursday through Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m. 
 The best spot in town for live music, The Social, 54 N. Orange Ave.
(% 407-246-1419; www.orlandosocial.com), offers an eclectic

mix that changes dramatically from night to night. You’re just as
likely to hear an urban groove as the next big punk band on the air-
waves. A $5 cover is charged for those 21 and older; national act
covers vary. It’s open daily from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
 Tabu, 46 N. Orange Ave. (% 407-648-8363; www.tabunightclub.
com), is one of the city’s hottest see-and-be-seen spots. The Art
Deco club boasts three dance floors and something of an attitude.
DJs spin hip-hop records and live bands provide additional music;
the club also hosts theme nights. A private lounge for VIPs means
you may see a famous face or two. Leave the denim at home,
though — the club’s upscale dress code is strictly enforced. Cover
is $5 to $10 on most nights. It’s open Tuesday through Sunday from
10 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
 Metropolis and Matrix, 9101 International Drive (% 407-370-3700;
www.metropolismatrix.com), are a pair of sophisticated clubs
located close to all the tourist action. The Matrix offers a futuristic

atmosphere with a multimillion-dollar light show, and large dance
floor with Techno, Eurotrance, Breakout, and Top-40 music. Just
next door, the Metropolis features a 13-foot video wall, TV screens
surrounding the room, and billiards tables. The Matrix is open
Wednesday to Sunday from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. The Metropolis is open
Thursday to Sunday from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Cover varies nightly.
“Stylish dress” required. Parking (next door at the garage) is $2 to
$5. You must be 18 to enter; on Saturday and Sunday nights, guys
must be 21. 
 A handful of Downtown hot spots are clustered in the Wall Street
district. Chillers, Big Belly Brewery, and Lattitudes (% 407-939-
4270), offer three very different experiences all in a single building.
The trio of clubs are all geared to the young adult crowd with an
atmosphere that’s very casual. Wall Street Plaza (www.wallst
plaza.net) is home to a wide variety of clubs including The Globe
(% 407-849-9904), a European patio cafe; Slingapours (% 407-849-
9904), a dance club with an indoor and outdoor patio for relaxing;
Waitiki (% 407-849-0471), a retro tiki lounge and restaurant, and
The Monkey Bar (% 407-849-0471), a hip martini lounge and cock-
tail bar. Hours and cover varies, so call ahead.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
A
h, tradition. The Part of Tens chapters are to For
Dummies books what noisemakers and silly hats are to
New Year’s — an integral part of the experience. In this part
of the book, I feed you plenty of useful and fun information
that I think is especially handy, such as budget attractions
that can stretch your dollars and fun ways to keep active
when you’re not at the theme parks.

I
t may shock you to learn that there are things to see and do in this
city beyond Mickey, Shamu, and Shrek. I discuss some of the city’s
smaller but still-popular attractions in Chapter 21, but here are some
hidden gems, where you can dodge the enormous crowds, save a few
dollars, and still have a great time while others are still waiting in line
or emptying their wallets at the big parks. 
Central Florida Zoo
The animal collection at the Central Florida Zoo includes a number of
endangered species including beautiful clouded leopards and cheetahs.
In addition to a lovable hippopotamus named Geraldine, you can also meet
black howler monkeys, siamangs, American crocodiles, a Gila monster,

non-Tiffany windows ranging from creations by Frank Lloyd Wright to
the works of 15th-century German masters. Also look for leaded lamps

Eatonville and the Zora Neale Hurston
National Museum of Fine Arts

African-American author. The best time to visit is in January during the
city’s annual festival honoring her and her work. A small gallery on the
site displays periodically changing exhibits of art and other work, and you
can grab a map for a walking tour of the community, established in 1887.

This bird sanctuary — one of the biggest rehabilitation centers in the
Southeast — has treated more than 8,000 raptors and released more
than 3,500 of them back into the wild since opening in 1979. It flies under
the radar of most tourists, making it a great place to get to know the
winged wonders (eagles, owls, hawks, and other raptors) that earn their
keep by entertaining those who do visit. It’s a wonderful place for nature
lovers and kids who love getting up close with the feathered residents.
The center is at 1101 Audubon Way, Maitland. (Take I-4 to Lee Road/Exit
46 and exit right; turn left at first light/Wymore Road, and turn right at

ant some exercise other than pounding theme-park pavement?
Walt Disney World and the surrounding areas offer plenty of
recreational jaunts to keep even the most active people busy. The major-
ity of these activities are most convenient for guests of Disney’s resorts
and official hotels, but many of the area’s other resorts offer comprehen-
sive facilities as well. The facilities I describe in this chapter are open to
the public, regardless of where you’re staying. For further information,

Resort’s 1.4-mile promenade circles a lake; Port Orleans has a 1.7-mile
riverfront trail; and Fort Wilderness’s tree-shaded 2.3-mile jogging path
has exercise stations about every quarter-mile. Pick up a jogging trail
map at any Disney property’s Guest Relations desk.
Surfing
The creative minds at Disney have added a way for you to find out how
to catch a wave and “hang ten” at the Typhoon Lagoon water park. (See
Chapter 16 for the park listing.) Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,
instructors from Carroll’s Cocoa Beach Surfing School (% 407-939-
7529) show up for an early-bird session in the namesake lagoon, which
has a wave machine capable of 8 footers. The two and one-half hour ses-
sion is held before the park opens to the general public. It’s limited to
14 people. Minimum age is 8. The $135 cost doesn’t include park admis-
sion, which you must pay if you want to hang around after the lesson.
Chapter 27: Top Ten Fitness Activities in Orlando 353

If you’re staying at WDW and don’t have a rental car, note that you can’t
use the Disney Transportation System to get to the park for the 7:30 a.m.
start time of the lessons; the buses don’t operate that early. 
Ron Jon Surf Park, the worlds first surf park, is scheduled to open in
2006 at Festival Bay (located at the northern-most end of International
Drive) where beginners can learn to surf, or the pros can simply ride the
waves, and its all indoors. Surf over to www.ronjons.com for the most
up to date information.  
Swimming
Orlando is home to an amazing number and variety of swimming pools.
Whiling away the heat of the afternoon at a pool is a great way to recharge
your batteries and cool off after a morning of pounding the pavement at
the parks. Keep in mind, however, that you won’t be the only one to think
that an afternoon retreat is a good idea — there are times the pools can
seem as crowded as the parks. 
Tennis
Twenty-six lighted tennis courts are scattered throughout the Disney
properties (including ten at Disney’s Wide World of Sports). Most are
free and available to resort guests on a first-come, first-served basis. Call
% 407-939-7529 to make reservations (they generally cost $8 per hour)
or for more information. The Racquet Club at the Contemporary Resort
has six clay courts (reservations required; $8 an hour), all lighted for
evening play, and offers lessons.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
354

which has lights for nighttime thrill-seekers. The complex is located
close to Orlando International Airport at 8615 Florida Rock Rd. Prices for

Internet cafe inside DisneyQuest (see
Chapter 16), and you can also send e-mail
Appendix: Quick Concierge 357

at Innoventions in Epcot (see Chapter 13),
though you have to pay the park admission

Universal Orlando’s resorts offer high-
speed Internet access.
Liquor Laws
Florida’s liquor laws are pretty straightfor-
ward. You must be 21 to buy or consume
alcohol. Alcohol is sold in supermarkets
and liquor stores daily from 9 a.m. to 
2 a.m. It’s served at bars and restaurants
from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Some places that
serve liquor allow you to enter if you’re
younger than 21, but most won’t let you sit
at the bar. 
Note: No liquor is served in Magic Kingdom
at Walt Disney World. Alcoholic drinks are
available, however, at the other Disney
parks and are quite evident at Universal
Orlando’s parks (even more so at its sea-
sonal celebrations).
Maps
AAA (see “AAA,” earlier in this appendix)
and other auto clubs generally provide
good maps (to members), as do many
Orlando rental-car agencies. The
Orlando/Orange County Convention and
Visitors Bureau, FLAUSA (Florida’s official
tourist bureau), and the Kissimmee/St. Cloud
Visitors Bureau all offer an array of area
maps (which can be sent via U.S. mail upon
request or picked up locally).

department store, convenience store,
attraction, fast-food eatery, or service 
station — and it’ll probably be clean.
(You may have to purchase something to
gain entrance, as many of these places
reserve their restrooms for patrons only.)
All the major theme parks have an abun-
dance of clean restrooms, many of which
also have baby-changing facilities (all are
clearly marked on the guide maps you get
upon entering the park). 
Safety
Don’t let the aura of Mickey Mouse allow
you to lower your guard. Orlando has a
crime rate that’s comparable to other
major U.S. cities. Stay alert and remain
aware of your immediate surroundings.
Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies 2006 
358

Keeping your valuables in a safe-deposit
box (inquire at your hotel’s front desk) is
a good idea, although, nowadays, many
hotels are equipped with in-room safes.
Keep a close eye on your valuables when
you’re in a public place, such as a restau-
rant, theater, or airport terminal. Renting a
locker is always preferable to leaving your
valuables in the trunk of your car, even in
the theme-park lots. Be cautious and avoid
carrying large amounts of cash, especially
if you’re carrying a backpack or fanny
pack, which thieves can easily access
while you’re standing in line for a ride or
show. If you’re renting a car, carefully read
the safety instructions that the rental com-
pany provides. Never stop in a dark or
unpopulated area. Remember that children
should never ride in the front seat of a car
equipped with air bags and those age 3
and younger must be in a child safety seat
while those ages 4 and 5 must either be in
a safety seat, booster seat, or a seatbelt.
Smoking
Restaurant space and hotel rooms for
smokers are evaporating in Orlando.
Disney doesn’t sell tobacco, and there are
precious few “you can smoke here” areas.
And don’t expect to light up over dinner.
Florida bans smoking in public workplaces,
including restaurants and bars that serve
food. Stand-alone bars that serve virtually
no food and designated smoking rooms in
hotels are exempt.
Taxes
Expect to add 11 or 12 percent to room
rates and 6.5 to 7 percent (the rate depends
on the county you happen to be in) on most
everything else — except groceries and
health supplies or medical services.
Taxis
Yellow Cab (% 407-699-9999) and Ace
Metro (% 407-855-0564) are among the
cab companies serving the area. Rates run
as high as $3.25 for the first mile, $1.75 per
mile thereafter.
Time Zone
Orlando is on eastern standard time from
late fall until midspring, and on eastern
daylight time (one hour later) the rest of
the year. That means that when both of
Mickey’s gloved hands are on 12 noon in
Orlando, it’s 7 a.m. in Honolulu, 8 a.m.
in Anchorage, 9 a.m. in Vancouver and
Los Angeles, 11 a.m. in Winnipeg and
New Orleans, and 5 p.m. in London.
Transit Info
Lynx (% 407-841-5969; www.golynx.com)
bus stops are marked with a paw print.
The buses serve Disney, Universal, and
International Drive ($1.25 for adults, 75¢ for
kids 8–18 with valid school ID, and seniors),
but they’re not particularly tourist-friendly.
The International Drive area has the I-Ride
Trolleys (% 407-248-9590; www.iride
trolley.com). The Main Line and Green
Line stops include most of I-Drive from
SeaWorld on the south end and Belz
Factory Outlet World on the north. Trolleys
run about every 20 minutes with 85 stops
along the Main Line and about every 30 min-
utes with 22 stops along the Green Line. It
runs from 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. (75¢ for adults,
25¢ for seniors, and kids younger than12 are
free with a paying adult; one-day and multi-
day passes are also available; exact change
is required) and is a good way to avoid 
I-Drive’s dreadfully heavy traffic. 
Weather
Call % 321-255-0212 to get forecasts from
the National Weather Service. When the
phone picks up, punch in 412 from a touch-
tone phone, and you’ll get the Orlando
forecast. Also check with The Weather
Channel if you have cable television or go
to the Web site, www.weather.com.

Where to Get More Information
If you want additional information on attractions, accommodations, or
just about anything else that’s in Orlando, the city has some excellent
sources for tourist information, discounts, maps, and more.
Orlando tourist information offices
The Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau can
answer your questions regarding area attractions, dining, and accommo-
dations, as well as send you maps and brochures. You should receive
the packet in about three weeks, and it includes the Magicard, which
is good for hundreds of dollars in discounts on accommodations, car
rentals, attractions, and more. The Official Visitors Center is located at
8723 International Drive, Suite 101, Orlando, FL 32819. For information,
call % 407-363-5872 (voice — you can talk to a real person!), 800-643-
9492, or 800-551-0181 (automated). Or log on to the Internet to www.
orlandoinfo.com.
Get your info straight from the Mouse’s mouth. Contact Walt Disney
World, Box 10000, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830-1000 (% 407-934-7639;
www.disneyworld.com), to order vacation brochures and get infor-
mation on all the theme parks, attractions, dining, accommodations,
and more.
For information on Universal Studios Florida (see Chapter 18), Islands
of Adventure (see Chapter 19), and CityWalk (see Chapter 25), contact

Universal Orlando, 1000 Universal Studios Plaza, Orlando, FL 32819
(% 407-363-8000; www.universalorlando.com). They will also send
you vacation brochures, including information on restaurants and
accommodations.
SeaWorld offers vacation brochures with information on the park, its
restaurants, its hotel partners, and on Discovery Cove, where you can
swim with dolphins. Write to 7007 SeaWorld Dr., Orlando, FL 32801,
or call % 407-351-3600. Online, surf over to www.seaworld.com.
For information on Discovery Cove, call % 877-434-7268 or head to
www.discoverycove.com.
Get in touch with the Kissimmee–St. Cloud Convention and Visitors
Bureau, 1925 E. Irlo Bronson Hwy./U.S. 192, Kissimmee, FL 34744
(% 800-327-9159 or 407-847-5000; www.floridakiss.com), for maps,
brochures, coupon books, and a guide to local accommodations and
attractions.
Newspapers and magazines
Check out the Sunday travel section in your hometown paper for the
latest bargains, ideas, and tips. After you land in O-Town, pick up a copy
of the Orlando Sentinel (www.orlandosentinel.com) to find out about
current events and deals. Go2Orlando, www.go2orlando.com, is the
Sentinel’s online section dedicated to visitors. The paper’s Calendar and
CityBeat sections are gold mines for current information on the area’s
accommodations, restaurants, nightclubs, and attractions, as is the
Orlando Weekly (www.orlandoweekly.com).
Other sources of information
 Deb’s Unofficial Walt Disney World Information Guide (The
All Ears Net) (http://wdwig.com, www.allearsnet.com) is
an excellent information source and arguably the best unofficial
Disney guide on the Internet. Though Disney doesn’t own it, it’s run
and written by true-blue fans of Mickey, so while it’s not entirely
objective (and you should take that into consideration when look-
ing at the tips it offers) the information is extremely detailed and
up to date. There are also sections aimed at travelers with special
needs that include good tips for touring the Disney parks if you’re
physically challenged, elderly, or with kids in tow.
 Visit www.icflorida.com for information about dining, clubs, per-
formances, theme parks, sports, and special events.
 Frommer’s Walt Disney World & Orlando with Kids (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.) has lots of tips and advice for those traveling with
children ages 2 to 16, while Frommer’s Irreverent Walt Disney
World (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) is a fun-filled guide aimed at singles
and couples.
