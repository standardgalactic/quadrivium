About the Author
Jan McCracken was born and raised in the Midwest, in a small, farming com-
munity in Illinois. Adopted by her grandparents, Jan grew up gardening with
her grandfather and canning and cooking with her grandmother. She spent
most of her early life in Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas.
In the early ’80s, Jan and her faithful friend, Mr. Bear, a fluffy husky-chow mix,
relocated to a cabin in the mountains above Santa Barbara, California. Given
her love of country living, the mountains, and cooking, Jan later opened a
country bed-and-breakfast in the Ozark Mountains of Branson, Missouri. It
was during her inn-keeping years in Branson that Jan wrote her first self-
published book, the Ozark Mountain Christmas Recipe Collection, First
Edition. With the grand success of her first book, her extensive recipe collec-
tion, and her love of cooking, Jan continued to write “little books of recipes”
that included the Garden Recipe Collection and the Fruit Sampler Collection.
Her personal favorite is a gift book collection of eighteen Little Books of Tea.
Jan began living the low-carb lifestyle about ten years ago and is an advocate
of preventive medicine through diet, exercise, and lifestyle. As a proponent
of healthy lifestyles, her love of research keeps her tuned into the pulse of
what’s happening in the low-carb genre as well as in nutrition and wellness.
Jan’s works in these areas include Low Carb Christmas Cookin’ and the Carb
Countin’ Holiday Cookbook with Sassy Stepper.
You can count on Jan’s recipes to always be easy and delicious, and her
motto is, “Fresh is always best.”
Jan has two grown children, Katie and Ray. Katie has blessed Gammy Mac
with twins, Sara Jane and John Edward, and Ray and Lori have blessed her
with Kaylie Elise. Jan’s ever-present smile is especially warm and proud when
she talks about her grandchildren.
Jan’s long-term goal for her books, speaking engagements, and teaching is to
help people understand that food truly is great medicine; it can prevent and
heal disease by making a positive impact on the health of people around the
world. As a health advocate for all ages, Jan has set up an international group
of Sassy Steppers to combat obesity and disease, stepping out with people all
over the world on the road to wellness.
In addition to her other endeavors, Jan continues her freelance writing career
and is currently at home in California. She feels very blessed to have been
given the opportunity to write Healthy Carb Cookbook For Dummies.
When you see Jan’s name in print you’ll usually see her personal slogan,
which comes from her heart:
Change Your Mind . . . Change Your Heart . . . Lose Weight for Life!


Dedication
To all of you with “low-carb” in your vocabulary who never want to diet again
and who want to pursue a healthy, low-carb, active lifestyle for life — yes, the
very life of you! I wrote this book for each of you!
Author’s Acknowledgments
Sincere, heartfelt thanks to the entire team at Wiley Publishing. They have
become like family to me. I have learned so much that I almost feel as if there
should be some sort of graduation ceremony for all authors that write For
Dummies books.
A very special thank you goes to my agent, Grace Freedson, for so graciously
getting me off on the right foot and for her ongoing guidance and warm 
support.
My heartfelt thanks to Stacy Kennedy, my acquisitions editor, who has been
a gem and a delight to work with since Day One. Big thanks to my project
editor, Mike Baker, for his patience, his ability to keep me and the project on
track, his willingness to go the extra mile, and his great sense of humor. Mike
gets stellar points! Sincere appreciation and marvel for what they do goes to
my copy editors, Trisha Strietelmeier and Tina Sims. Special thanks to Lesa
Grant, my marketing manager and a talented lady whose enthusiasm is conta-
gious. I got the luck of the draw with my recipe tester — very warm thanks to
Emily Nolan. Thanks to technical reviewer and nutritional analyst Patty
Santelli, who made sure all the net carb math was done precisely.
My dear friend Debra Hartman, who, long distance from Branson, has been so
supportive throughout this entire project. A very special thanks to Deb for
being such an ongoing source of encouragement and delight in my life! The
praise and glory of this book goes to the Lord, with thanks for His blessing
me with the authorship of this book. Without Him I could not have written a
word.

Healthy Carb Cookbook  For Dummies

Introduction
A
re you hankering for some new horizons for cooking low-carb? Well,
you’ve come to the right place. This book is fun, and I’ve developed and
de-carbed some pretty awesome recipes for you to incorporate into your daily
low-carb lifestyle whether you’re cooking for one, two, or an entire family. Low-
carb never tasted so good!
Regardless of the meal or food you have in mind, I think you’ll find a recipe
that hits the spot here. From breakfast to soup, salads, sides, and main
courses, I have you covered with these recipes, which are all about variety,
great flavors, and healthy meals that don’t take forever to prepare. But it only
gets better from there: I also include recipes for desserts (including some
sweet surprises), fresh wraps, and snacks. I give you slow cooker recipes so
that your low-carb meal is ready for you when you walk through the door,
and I provide ideas for dishes to cook in a hurry (on days when you haven’t
used your slow cooker!). And did I mention that there are veggies galore that
are great for your health and will please your tummy, too? I hope you enjoy
preparing these recipes as much as I have enjoyed putting together this book
just for you. A majority of the recipes contain less than 10 grams of net carbs
per serving.
About This Book
So what’s this book all about? It’s a mix of low-carb lessons that I’ve learned the
hard way along my low-carb road, plus a ton of recipes that will satisfy your
comfort-food cravings and your low-carb sweet tooth — a mix of comfort-food
cooking sprinkled with my California-cuisine influences and a heavy serving of
low-carb variety and healthy eating. The simple cook in me likes to get things
on the table in a very timely manner and you’ll see that influence in the recipes
in this book.
I grew up in a small Midwestern farming community on good, old-fashioned
comfort food, and that’s what I learned to cook — three squares a day and
plenty of desserts. Then, about 20 years ago, I moved to California, and my
entire eating lifestyle changed. Even though I’d grown up eating veggies fresh
from the garden and canning every year, the word fresh took on a whole new
meaning for me when I was introduced to California cooking. Grilling became

a year-round sport. Fruits and vegetables became even more prominent. And
fish — even though I’d caught and cooked my fair share of freshwater fish
in the Midwest, being able to walk down to the dock and buy seafood right
off the boats was a treat beyond measure. (And let’s not forget exercise: I
became a runner and ran the beach almost every day. I was one healthy
California girl.)
But I had a dream of opening a bed and breakfast, and Branson, Missouri, and
the Ozark Mountains beckoned me on a journey that became yet another culi-
nary experience. My breakfasts at the Inn at Fall Creek reflected an interesting
mix of my Midwest comfort-food cooking and the California cuisine that I had
learned to love. I looked at the interior design of my B&B as country — my
guests called it California County — and saw that the mix was clear both in
the décor and in the food. I tried for comfort food and folded in the healthy
with a splash of laughter and grand presentation.
I gained some weight while at the B&B — not from a lack of running around
24/7 but from eating late at night and irregular meals. It was then that my
best friend steered me to a low-carb diet. It wasn’t all about weight even back
then — it was about my health, which was deteriorating — and my friend was
concerned. I literally shrieked when she introduced me to the low-carb diet,
“What do you mean I can’t have white bread and sugar?” We laugh about it
to this day, and we both support each other on our continuing low-carb
lifestyle paths.
I continued the low-carb diet and dropped some major pounds. And I moved
back to California. I discovered that if I ate sugar I was out of whack for days.
So I decided that it wasn’t on my list of things to eat any more — not just for
a few weeks but for a lifetime. I’m not telling you that I won’t have a small
slice of birthday cake at my grandchildren’s birthday parties, but I am telling
you that sugar is off my grocery list for good. And so low-carb became a
lifestyle for me that worked and still does today.
It’s not just about the recipes. I have a sincere desire to help you be success-
ful with your low-carb healthy lifestyle. I’m a health advocate and a low-
carber of ten-plus years who has fallen off the low-carb wagon many times;
dusted myself off and sheepishly climbed back on; been through my share of
stalls, confusion, and boredom; and finally discovered the truth about con-
trolling my carb intake. For me, it means not only looking at my carbs but
looking at my calories and taking calories seriously too — as seriously as I
take my carbs. I’ve blended my carb and calorie intakes to find what works
for my body. The other biggie is moving my body more; I use a pedometer to
count my steps every day and try my best to meet my daily goals and keep
increasing my daily steps.

Healthy Carb Cookbook For Dummies 

I can think of no greater joy than sharing with you what I know works through
this book. My goal is to help you become more aware of carb and calorie
counts, find out more about nutrition, become motivated to move your body
more, and cook up a storm with mouthwatering low-carb recipes. Applying
the ideas in this book to your healthy low-carb lifestyle will help you lose
weight and keep off those pounds for the rest of your life and encourage you
on the road to health, longevity, and wellness.
Conventions Used in This Book
I present the recipes in this book in a conventional style, listing the ingredients,
the preparation time, the time it takes to cook the recipe, the amount of time
the dish needs to be refrigerated before serving, and the number of servings to
divide the finished product into. Some of these recipes are so good that you’re
going to want to eat the whole thing. (But remember, although the phrase low-
carb means that you can eat until you’re satisfied, you still have to keep track
of those carb counts.)
A nutritional analysis at the end of each recipe gives you the total carbohy-
drates, the amount of fiber, and the net carb counts per serving, along with
other important nutrition information to apply to your low-carb healthy
lifestyle.
I’ve tried to keep things simple in the ingredient lists for these recipes. So,
unless otherwise stated, you can assume the following:
 Butter is unsalted.
 Eggs are large.
 Salt is regular ol’ table salt.
 Pepper is freshly ground black pepper (believe me, the fabulous flavor
more than makes up for the extra ten seconds it takes to grind it yourself).
 Vegetables and fruits are washed under running water.
And here are some other recipe-related issues to keep in mind as you dive
into the fabulous low-carb foods in this book:
 If you’re looking for vegetarian recipes, look for this tiny little tomato —
T — in front of the recipe name in the Recipes at a Glance section
toward the front of this book, in the list of Recipes in This Chapter on
the first page of each chapter in Part II and Part III, and next to the
recipe name on the little recipe-card tab that begins each recipe.

Introduction

 Some of the sidebars I include (those little gray boxes) contain starter
ideas and variations of other recipes found in the chapter. In those
cases, I provide you with some basic ingredients and preparations and
let you take it from there. I promise that none of them are rocket sci-
ence, but they’re pretty tasty, so have a look-see. What I think you’ll find
is the amazing dietary variety and opportunity for improvisation that
healthy low-carb lifestyles can provide.
And now for a few non–recipe-related issues:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are
defined in the text.
 Boldfaced text is used to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or the
action parts of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses. When this book was printed, some
Web addresses may have needed to break across two lines of text. If that
occurs, just know that no extra hyphens have been added. So, when
using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in
this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
 Sidebars are shaded gray boxes that contain text that’s interesting to
know but not necessarily critical to your understanding of the chapter
or section topic.
In Chapter 4, I cover all the low-carb conventions I use in the recipes.
What You’re Not to Read
I give you extra added attractions to the subject at hand in the sidebars in
this book. It won’t ruin my day (or yours) if you don’t read them.
Foolish Assumptions
All authors have to make a few assumptions about their audiences, and this
low-carb lady is no different. If any of these descriptions hit the mark, you
have the right book in your hands:

Healthy Carb Cookbook For Dummies 

 You’re a low-carb fan with some basic knowledge of the low-carb world,
and you’re looking for a ton of fabulous recipes that fit your lifestyle.
 You’re considering lowering the carbohydrates that you consume on a
daily basis, you’ve heard a little about low-carb dietary plans, and you
want to know a little more about how they work and get an idea of all
the great foods you can eat and the easy recipes you can prepare.
 You’re looking for quick snacks and munchies that make the adjective
easy seem like an understatement.
 You have basic cooking skills — you know what “preheat the oven”
means, you can measure ingredients, and you can keep your fingers out
of the beaters on your mixer.
How This Book Is Organized
I start this book out by talking to you about diets in general, suggesting that
you throw away your diet yo-yo, and basically explaining what’s involved in
adopting a healthy low-carb active lifestyle — everything from grocery shop-
ping to table presentation. I cover topics ranging from fiber to phytochemicals
to pedometer walking. But I focus on the food and the recipes — bunches of
great low-carb recipes with variations.
This book is divided into five parts for basic organization, with chapters by
subject in each part for easy access for you. Here’s an overview of what you
find in each part.
Part I: Creating a Healthy
Lifestyle Counting Carbs
A lot of smart people are confused about counting and controlling carbs —
bad carbs, good carbs, and no carbs. In this part, I clear this matter up for
you, setting you on the straight and narrow of your choice of a great healthy
low-carb lifestyle. You’ll decide to throw your diet yo-yo in the ocean forever
and aim directly for a lifestyle of health, wellness, and longevity. Along the
way in this part, I accompany you to the grocery store with a prepared list of
basic low-carb staples. While cruising the aisles, you’ll become an expert at
label reading and looking for hidden sugars and carbs. I teach a couple of
short classes — one on net carb math and another on low-carb nutrition and
the glycemic index. But don’t worry: You don’t have to take any written tests.
I also show you how to become an amazing grazer, grazing your way to
5

weight loss along with moving more with the help a new friend, a pedometer,
to count your steps for you everyday. In between all of this serious stuff, I
expect you to at least grin a few times because I wrote this book so you can
have fun leafing through its pages.
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy
This part will whet your appetite, and I have a feeling that you just won’t
know which recipe to try first. I separate the recipes into chapters by cate-
gories, making it easy to choose an entree in one chapter, go to another chap-
ter for a side of veggies, and then hop over to the desserts chapter for a
perfect sweet ending to your low-carb meal.
Part III: Expanding Everyday 
Low-Carb Cooking
In this part, I give you some easy options for whipping up great low-carb
snacks and dips, rolling up recipes for fun and tasty low-carb wraps, getting
your low-carb meals on the table almost effortlessly with a slow cooker, and
preparing quick recipes with 5 carbs or less.
Part IV: Eating Low-Carb on 
the Town and on the Run
I know that you won’t cook all your own meals, so in this part I offer you
ideas on how to dine out and still stick to your low-carb lifestyle. I also pro-
vide suggestions on packing a low-carb lunch and include a special recipe to
tote with you. Finally, I give you ideas about cooking low-carb in hurry with
recipes for quick, tasty meals.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part starts with a chapter on strategies to simplify your carb-counting
cooking. Next, I list 10 foods that you can eat more of and lose weight at the
same time. Finally, I give you ten great Web sites to visit online for free low-
carb information, e-zines, and great nutritional information.

Icons Used in This Book
I want to give you a heads up about the icons that I use throughout the book,
or you may just miss something important. Here’s a list of all the icons I use:
You’ll see a lot of these as you flip through the pages of this book. I give you
tips galore on everything. The tips are little extras and embellishments to
help you on your low-carb lifestyle path.
Think of the remember icon as just a little help from your friends about some
things that are important to your low-carb lifestyle. I wouldn’t want you to
forget them.
The warning icon is meant to raise a red flag to you about something impor-
tant in your low-carb lifestyle or the recipe you’re about to prepare, so please
take heed when you see it.
Sometimes I lapse into the technical realm about nutrition and other techie
elements of your low-carb lifestyle. I use this icon to alert you where this
information is. If it’s not your thing, skip it.
When you see this icon, you’ll know that I’m suggesting ways to take the
information I provide and head off down your own culinary path. Try some of
these lip-smacking good suggestions marked with this icon.
Time in a bottle? Unfortunately not — you can’t buy it in a bottle. So I use this
icon throughout the book to flag some areas in your low-carb healthy cooking
where you can save some time.
This icon accompanies all recipes that have less than 5 grams of net carbs
per serving — and there are a bunch of them.
This icon helps you immediately find the recipes that have less than 10 grams
of net carbs per serving — and there are a bunch of these too.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
The recipes and other info in this book are all so good that you may just want
to close your eyes and start reading from wherever you happen to open the
book. And if you want dessert, go immediately to the dessert chapter and get
cookin’. For Dummies books usually tell you that you don’t have to remember
anything you read, and this book is no different — it’s designed so you can
easily find what you need if you forget something that you read earlier. I do
have one favor to ask of you: Remember when you cook something great
from this book, will you?
If you ask me (you didn’t, I know), I suggest reading all of Part I first and then
jumping to whatever recipe chapters interest you the most. Wherever you
start, please have some fun browsing through these pages while preparing
and eating some great low-carb food!

n this part, I help you take control of your low-carb
dietary choices as part of an overall healthy and active
lifestyle. You’ll be jumping off the diet merry-go-round for-
ever, aiming directly for a lifestyle of health, wellness, and
longevity. Knowledge is wonderful stuff, so I clear up con-
fusion about counting carbs, bad carbs, good carbs, no
carbs, and controlling carbs. I speak “low-carb nutrition,”
which may be somewhat of a foreign language to you, but
you’ll pick it up quickly and begin fitting all the pieces of
the wellness puzzle together in your lifestyle. I show you
how to do the calculations for net carb math. I explain the
glycemic index and the glycemic load of foods, and I tell
you how to become an amazing grazer so that you can
keep your blood sugars on an even keel.
I help you make some changes in your low-carb kitchen
and discuss good low-carb staples to keep on hand. I pro-
vide you with tons of tips on how to make the transition
to the low-carb lifestyle and how to stay on track after
you’re up to speed, like planning your meals in advance
by taking advantage of your carb awareness and cooking
skills. Finally, I encourage you to get moving, preferably by
walking. To help motivate you, I discuss the benefits of
using a pedometer — a dandy little device to keep track of
your daily steps.

maintain a healthy weight, and ensure top-notch overall health. And
there’s no better way to implement and maintain a low-carb plan than to cook
many of your meals at home. Doing so allows you to know exactly what’s in
the majority of the food you eat on a daily basis, which is a key piece of infor-
mation to have when you’re controlling or counting carbs.
In this chapter, I welcome you to the world of low-carb living. I introduce the
basics behind low-carb dietary plans. I present some advice for taking a low-
carb diet to the next level by incorporating it into a healthy, active low-carb
lifestyle, in which the recipes in this book can play a tremendous role in 
offering fabulous flavors and variety, variety, variety. Did I mention variety?
I help you take stock of your current eating habits to help identify areas for
improvement, and I provide a bit of perspective on making weight manage-
ment and healthy nutrition a life-long commitment.
Revealing the Low-Carb Revolution
The first two words in the title of this book are low and carb. So I guess it only
makes sense to start at the beginning. If you’re new to the world of low-carb
cooking, don’t worry. I take you on a quick tour of the low-carb basics before
you delve into all things cooking. In short, a carbohydrate is a nutrient found

in foods that your body can readily turn into energy (for a more complex defi-
nition of a carbohydrate, see Chapter 2). But carbs also have the ability to be
stored as fat if they’re not used for energy. Sounds pretty straightforward,
right? However, if ever there was a controversial subject, it has to be low-carb
dieting. But remember that things that aren’t worth talking about are rarely
controversial and certainly don’t make headlines.
Low-carb diet programs were originally promoted as high-protein diets. The 
initial low-carb diets claimed that you could eat as much fat as you wanted to
and still lose weight. Nutritional research showed that consuming all of that fat
wasn’t the healthiest approach in creating a long-term healthy lifestyle, even
though some fats are necessary and healthy (cruise over to Chapter 2 and read
about knowing your fats). As competitive diets surfaced and different low-carb
plans emerged, the ratio of protein, carbs, and fats that low-carb diets called
for changed, too. And that ratio is still at the root of the low-carb controversy
today. But despite the differences in the approach of various low-carb dietary
plans, all of them basically agree on the fundamental principle that too many
carbs in your diet will cause weight gain and prevent weight loss.
The number of carbs that work for you on a daily basis is up to you, the indi-
vidual. Some people can get away with simply controlling their carbs and
eating over 100 grams of carbs a day, and some folks need to count closely
because they gain weight if they even approach 50 for the day. The “accept-
able” carb range that all the different dietary plans out there call for varies
from the very restrictive, which limits the consumption of some food groups
such as fruit and grains, to a more balanced, less restrictive approach that
focuses on carb control. Here’s a snapshot of the low-carb spectrum:
 Most restrictive: Some plans limit you to only 5 percent of your daily
calorie intake from carbohydrates. This works out to be around 20 grams
of carbs a day.
 Moderate: These more moderate low-carb plans allow 40 percent of
your daily calorie intake to come from carbohydrates.
 Least restrictive: On a lesser restrictive low-carb plan, you’re not
required to count carbs, but instead you make choices about the type
of carbs you eat.
The good news, at least in terms of how useful you’ll find this book, is that
regardless of the low-carb dietary approach you currently subscribe to or are
considering, you can find tons of fabulous recipes here that will fit squarely
into your plans. With all the recipes I include that are super skinny on carbs,
you can inject even the most restrictive plans with a huge jolt of variety.

Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

A low-carb lifestyle shouldn’t eliminate attention paid to calorie counts. Calorie
intake versus calorie output is the real bottom line to weight loss and mainte-
nance. Combine the work of tracking your daily carb intake with balancing
calories, and you create a healthy low-carb lifestyle that you can live with for
life — a healthy and rewarding life. (Check out Chapter 2 for more on calories.)
Always check with your personal healthcare practitioner before beginning
any major change in your dietary lifestyle or starting a new exercise program.
Keeping your eye on the carb
Most low-carb dietary plans ask you to walk away from carbs that have little
nutritional value, make your blood-sugar levels spike, and pack on the pounds
(see Chapter 2 for more information on your blood-sugar levels). Even though
low-carb dietary plans definitely differ on the details, these are the basics.
Learning what’s really in foods and products is vital to make sure that you’re
not consuming a bunch of hidden sugars, hidden carbs, and excessive calories
(find out more about reading labels in Chapter 3). So put yourself on carb
patrol and avoid these foods for no one’s sake but your own:
 Candy
 Cookies, cakes, pies, and other baked goods (I’m not talking sugar-free
here — see more about artificial sweeteners in Chapter 2)
 Most pastas
 Processed snack foods such as chips, pretzels, and crackers
 Refined sugars
 Sodas and fruit juices that are loaded with sugar
 White flour and white breads
 White rice
Counting on friendly low-carb 
foods in the kitchen
Low-carb diets can get some unfavorable press, as can low-fat diets, low-
calorie diets, fad diets, and practically any other diet in the universe. But if
you make your decisions from the perspective of living an overall healthy
lifestyle, the word diet can be stricken from your vocabulary.

Chapter 1: Taking Control of Carbs In and Out of the Kitchen

A healthy low-carb lifestyle allows you to keep all of the nutritious carbs from
all five of the food groups. Each food group is important because no one group
can supply your body with all of the necessary nutrients. Variety is still the
spice of life. Here’s a bird’s-eye view of some of the more low-carb friendly
foods, along with some recipe suggestions if you’re itchin’ to get in the kitchen:
 Vegetables: The more colors the better. Leafy greens and lettuces — the
darker green, the better — are a great place to start (see Chapter 8 for
more information on greens and lettuces, plus great salad recipes), but
it’s only a start. Low-carb vegetable options are plentiful (see Chapter 12
for a bunch of great recipes and a handy vegetable buying guide).
 Fish and seafood: Many fish have close to 0 carbs, and the health bene-
fits in eating fish are huge (for recipes, turn to Chapter 9).
 Poultry: Chicken and turkey are very healthy sources of protein
(Chapter 10 has all kinds of great recipes).
 Lean meats: Read both words here — lean meats are the best when
you’re looking for protein sources (check out Chapter 11 for recipes).
 Some fruits: Yes, fruits that are relatively low in carbs do exist (check
out the shopping list in Chapter 3).
 Nuts: They’re full of good nutrients and are a great source of protein.
Nuts are great to graze on to keep your metabolism fires burning (see
Chapter 2), and they can help curb cravings (for more on nuts and other
great snack suggestions and recipes, see Chapter 14).
 Whole grains: Even though whole grains are mainly carbohydrates,
refined grains are the guys to watch out for. Whole grains, in modera-
tion, are a great source of fiber, with as much as seven times more fiber
than refined grains.
 Legumes: Soybeans are very high in protein, contain no cholesterol
(like all legumes), and are low in saturated fats and sodium, plus they’re
packed with dietary fiber and are rich in iron, calcium, zinc, potassium,
magnesium, and B vitamins. Pretty impressive for a little bean, eh? The
best-kept secret in the low-carb lifestyle is black soybeans, and they
taste great. (See Chapter 7 for information about black soybeans and a
recipe using black soybeans.)
 Yogurts that are low in sugar and carbs: If you look, you can find some
great ones, especially Greek yogurt.
 Cheeses of many varieties: Cheeses are a great source of protein, but
watch for the saturated fats. Keyword — balance. (Among many others,
there’s a great recipe for No-Pasta Lasagna in Chapter 12 with great
cheesy stuff in it.)

Leaning toward a Lifestyle Approach:
The Latest in Low-Carb Living
Low-carb dietary guidelines are a good thing. But I sometimes compare them
to a pattern for a dress. The basics of the dress pattern and the dietary guide-
lines are both just guidelines. After the basic dress is sewn or the basic guide-
lines are laid down, it’s necessary to perform alterations and embellishments
to fit each individual’s particular taste, style, and needs. In other words, one
dietary lifestyle does not fit all! Use these low-carb dietary plans as guides for
you to draw your own blueprint!
Empowering yourself to make a commitment to a healthy lifestyle is the only
answer to maintaining your weight with the awesome rewards of wellness
and longevity. Did you wake up one morning overweight? Did you pack on
those pounds overnight? I didn’t think so. So what’s your hurry now? It all
has to come off in two weeks?
Jump off that diet merry-go-round. Make a decision to lose weight for life! Be
willing to look at the big picture (soon to be a picture of less of you)! Make
the steps you’re taking to lose pounds take you along a road that you’ll con-
tinue traveling as you maintain and lose weight for life. You’ll never go on a
“diet” again. The word “diet” derives from the Greek diaita, of which the lit-
eral meaning is “way of life.” For you, this translates into a constant way of
living or lifestyle. Think of yourself as following a healthy, active low-carb
lifestyle — not a diet!
Considering the components
All low-carb lifestyles are not created equal, and only you know what really
works for you. You may be a real carb counter, or you may be a carb con-
troller. This book isn’t intended to tell you which healthy low-carb lifestyle
that you should choose — it’s a cookbook! You more than likely had already
chosen your low-carb lifestyle before you bought this book, and you can
adapt the recipes in this book to whatever low-carb lifestyle you choose. Roll
the dice so that you come up with the healthy and active low-carb lifestyle
that fits what you so deserve, including not only good food but also health
and longevity.
You may want to find a lifestyle combination of all the low-carb “diets” out
there that fits your specific needs. Find not just another diet that’s going to
keep you on the diet roller coaster, but a low-carb dietary plan that you can
adapt for life as a personal healthy low-carb lifestyle. This entails some trial
and error. I can’t tell you what will and won’t work for your body. But I can tell
you that a low-carb lifestyle will not only help you lose and maintain your
15
Chapter 1: Taking Control of Carbs In and Out of the Kitchen

weight but also provide other perks. You’ll have more energy, you’ll feel better,
chronic aches and pains may disappear, your health will likely improve, your
risk of chronic diseases can lessen, and you’ll look better. You’ll probably buy
a new mirror because you’ll like the way you look, and your self-esteem will be
higher than ever!
By living a healthy low-carb lifestyle, you can lose and maintain your weight
with a vast array of foods that line up with the caloric needs of your body
while eliminating refined carbs, unhealthy fats, white flour, and white sugar.
If you want to adopt a basic low-carb lifestyle, these general guidelines may
prove helpful:
 Choose carbs that are nutritious and not full of empty calories.
 Eat more foods high in fiber content, such as vegetables, whole grains,
and fruits.
 Eat more fish.
 Eat more nuts.
 Move more every day.
 Watch for added sugar in fruits and minimize caloric artificial sweeteners.
 Avoid processed foods and others containing partially hydrogenated oils
and trans fats (see Chapter 2 for more information on all fats).
 Be selective about the fats you eat, because all fats are not bad.
 Select foods based on your individual calorie needs according to your
body. Remember that calories do count and that balancing calories is
important in losing and maintaining weight.
You’re not supposed to cut carbs totally out of your healthy lifestyle. It’s not
about elimination; it’s about carb control and the types of carbs consumed.
Your body processes and breaks down foods differently than any other
processor on the planet. You have to find your own sweet spot of balance.
Every book tells you something a little different, and almost every person has
a different answer. It’s about the basic equipment — your body. So listen to it.
Drop those initial pounds and then begin enjoying your new healthy lifestyle
of choice — low-carb.
Valuing variety
You may hear people talk about all the foods that they can’t have on a low-
carb diet. But the list of foods you can have when you’re controlling your daily
carb intake is so long that it really dwarfs the list of foods you should shy
away from. So try switching gears in your head. Don’t think deprivation —
think choices, choices, choices. (Check out Chapter 3 for all the great items
you get to add to your low-carb shopping list.)
16
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

Some people say that eating the low-carb way is a juggling act. I say, “Great.
Look at all I have to juggle!” The possibilities and combinations are endless.
If you choose to be bored with this lifestyle, you have no one to blame but,
well, yourself. One of my objectives in this book is to demystify the belief that
low-carb is boring. I do this by bringing you choices, choices, choices with
great low-carb recipes and suggestions for low-carb snack foods. I guarantee
that if you prepare some of the low-carb recipes in this book for your guests,
they won’t have a clue that they’re low-carb because they are so good! Stop
thinking that something can’t be good for you unless it hurts or tastes bad. A
healthy lifestyle doesn’t hurt, the food can be great, and you don’t suffer from
pangs of hunger and deprivation. You’re in the driver’s seat, and you can
have a joyous and very healthy ride. So come on along!
Healthy nutritional eating doesn’t have to be ho-hum. Eating what’s good for
you and available to you on your low-carb eating plan is easy when it tastes
great (see the recipes later in this book, many with less than 5 grams of carbs).
The problem with falling off the wagon of any healthy lifestyle usually comes
down to boredom. But there’s no reason to be bored with the food in your low-
carb lifestyle. The boredom comes only when you prepare broccoli the same
way for the 98th time!
After you discover the grand flexibility of all the whole fresh foods that are
there for your enjoyment, you’ll stop mourning the absence of the foods you
can’t have and start thinking, “Wow! Look at all the awesome foods that I can
have — foods that will not only satisfy my appetite but also taste delicious
and have the added benefit of enhancing my health every day.”
Variety is truly the spice of the low-carb lifestyle. By adding new foods with
low carb counts, you’ll not only avoid boredom and stay with your low-carb
lifestyle, but I’ll bet you’ll smile more because of how you look and feel. Try
two new recipes a week to expand your low-carb cuisine horizon. You won’t
be sorry.
Becoming an active low-carb consumer:
Get the nutrition facts
Become nutrition minded — not food minded. I think you’ll be amazed at
how good nutritional foods can taste! Taking charge of your health and your
lifestyle is very empowering. These days, knowing what to eat and where to
get reliable information can be challenging. Take a little time to learn just a
little about nutrition. I’m not asking you to get a degree. Just commit to read-
ing one short nutrition article a week, whether it’s online, in a magazine, or in
a newspaper.
17
Chapter 1: Taking Control of Carbs In and Out of the Kitchen

Food satisfies hunger, but food is also about giving your body energy. The
right kind of energy is about nutrition. When you begin to get a glimmer of
the connection between nutrition and wellness, you’ll be even more excited
about the smart choice you’re making in controlling your carbs with your
healthy low-carb lifestyle. You’re on the road to losing weight for life! (See
more about low-carb nutrition in Chapter 2 and a discussion of reading those
Nutrition Facts panels in Chapter 3.)
Reducing your reliance on diet products
The diet industry is a billion-dollar industry, but for many people, the only
thing that gets skinnier are their wallets. Ante up for the pleasures of your
healthy low-carb lifestyle, not for diet hype full of empty promises. Put your
money where your mouth is (sorry, I just couldn’t resist). Spend your money
on foods that you really enjoy and learn how to cook different ways. For
example, try some ethnic dishes and get familiar with fresh herbs and spices.
Discover new and easy ways to prepare great food (see Chapter 20 for quick
and easy recipes). Treat yourself to a low-carb cooking class, which you can
find offered at lots of places these days!
Very simply, if manufacturers of diet products and packaged foods are selling
extreme promises, beware. What they’re really selling is hope — simple and
empty hope along with hidden ingredients and preservatives. There is no
magic bullet to weight control. Stop the extremes. Check out Chapter 3,
where I provide all kinds of shopping lists with all kinds of foods that are nat-
urally low in carbs, many of which are better alternatives to dietary products.
Assessing Your Situation: Developing
a Carb-Patrol Report
Food journaling has been proven to work, so I want you to try this exercise.
For one week, you’re going to eat as you normally do, whether you usually
pay little attention to what you put in your mouth or you’re a pretty active
carb counter already. During this week, write down everything you eat and
drink — and I mean everything. Don’t worry about writing down carb counts
or calorie counts (unless you usually do) or getting fancy and trying to con-
struct some sort of spreadsheet. Just get a little notebook and take it every-
where with you and scribble down everything you put in your mouth. After
a couple days, you’ll begin to think of it as a little game you’re having with
yourself. This is a very personal exercise, so you don’t have to share it with
anyone unless you want to.
18
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

At the end of the week, assess what you’ve eaten. A couple of things could
happen here. You could give yourself a big pat on the back or yell “Yikes!”
That’s why food journaling works — you just don’t realize what you really eat
in a day. Writing down all the foods that you eat every day will help you begin
to make small changes, setting you up for success in adopting a low-carb
lifestyle.
Losing Weight for Life
You’ve heard many times that life isn’t about the destination; it’s about the
journey. As you embark upon life’s journey, you encounter change and chal-
lenge, just as you do in your low-carb lifestyle. And much like life, if you stick
to the basics and throw out the extremes, things flow much more smoothly.
You also know that some goals in life are more quickly realized than others.
Some take more time and patience. So why does the world not apply these
theories to quick-loss fad diets? Because there is always a better mousetrap,
and most people are guilty of wanting a quick fix, especially when it comes to
weight loss. You have the power — it’s the power within you. You have the
desire to lose and maintain your weight for life, or you wouldn’t have this
book in your hand right now.
Reality check: There is no quick fix to losing weight and keeping it off.
Following a healthy, active low-carb lifestyle is your ticket to losing weight
for life. Slow and steady wins the race forever. The rewards can be huge! You
may be able to eliminate chronic disease and illness and enjoy wellness and
longevity. What better pot of gold at the end of the rainbow could you possi-
bly ask for? Health is wealth, and there isn’t enough money in the world to
buy health.
Focusing on today
Don’t always be living in the future (looking forward to “when I do this” or
“when this happens”) and certainly don’t dwell in the past, with all its would
haves, could haves, and should haves. Today is all you have, so make the most
of it. Appreciate today and live today. Expand your horizons today. Expand
your low-carb lifestyle and stretch yourself. Get excited about a new recipe or
treat yourself because you deserve it. You’ll love yourself even more tomor-
row because of what you do today.
And you’ll find that low-carb is your yellow-brick road to losing weight for life
and that it just gets easier to maintain your healthy low-carb lifestyle. Start
liking yourself and accepting yourself today.

Ditching your bathroom scales
Begin moving in a different direction now. I’m not telling you to never weigh
yourself, but I am suggesting that you not be a slave to your bathroom scale.
Shift your focus from dieting to leading a healthy low-carb lifestyle. Notice
that your clothes are suddenly looser? I recall a time not too long ago that I
had fallen off the proverbial low-carb wagon and climbed sheepishly back on.
I had an important meeting to attend and wanted so badly to get into a brand-
new pair of great dress pants in my closet. I hesitated as I slid one leg into the
chic, new pants and then began to zip them up. Wow — they were actually
a little loose around the waistband. Did I feel good about myself or what?
The scale, however, didn’t reflect any great weight loss. Expectation is killer
stuff, so don’t ruin your progress and your glory by stepping on the scale,
because with the low-carb lifestyle, you’ll find that you sometimes lose
inches before you lose pounds. It’ll all eventually mesh, and the pounds will
disappear with the inches as you continue your active, healthy low-carb
lifestyle. Just take it one step at a time.

o one diet or lifestyle works for everyone. You probably already
selected the low-carb lifestyle that works best for you before you
opened this book. You may count every carb that you put into your mouth;
you may take a more relaxed, yet still focused approach by carefully monitor-
ing the carbs that you choose to eat every day; or you may have found that
eliminating refined sugar, white flour products, and processed foods is ade-
quate to maintain your carb-conscious lifestyle. I say whatever works for you
is great.
Or maybe you’re just beginning to explore what this low-carb thing is all about.
If that’s the case, welcome to the low-carb world (and you may want to con-
sider Low-Carb Dieting For Dummies, written by Katherine B. Chauncey and
published by Wiley, as you try to find a dietary and lifestyle approach that
works for you).
But no matter where you fall on the low-carb spectrum, information is key.
And that’s where this chapter comes in. In this chapter, I present some of
the nuts and bolts of low-carb living. If you’re new to the lifestyle, you’ll find
this information very useful as a primer of sorts. But like any good low-carb
lifestyle, I’m flexible. So I’ve been sure to pack this chapter with enough tips
and information to pique your interest even if you’re an old pro at this stuff.

Research shows that rapid weight loss rarely lasts. Take heed — slow and
steady wins the race in weight loss. Keep those pounds off as you shed them.
Introducing the Carbohydrate
Carbohydrates are molecules made of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. They
are sometimes referred to as carbs or carbos. Carbs include:
 Starches
 Sugars
 Fiber
Carbohydrates are the body’s main source of energy and the first energy that
the body uses (though fiber is calorie free, and therefore doesn’t provide
energy). Carbohydrates are found mostly in plant foods such as vegetables,
fruits, and whole grains. Low-carb dietary approaches attempt to minimize
the consumption of foods containing starches and sugars, while encouraging
the consumption of carbohydrate foods that are high in fiber.
Usually carbohydrates are classified as complex or simple:
 Complex carbohydrates require digestion before the energy released can
be used by the body. Therefore, low-carb dietary plans usually stress that
the carbs you do consume should be of the complex variety because they
lead to steady energy levels as opposed to the peaks and valleys of energy
and sluggishness that usually occur when you eat simple carbohydrates.
 Simple carbohydrates, such as sugars, white flour, white rice, and foods
containing high amounts of starches, go directly into the bloodstream,
causing a spike in blood sugar levels. This spike gives the body a boost
of energy for a short period of time. The blood sugar levels then drop,
and a sense of depletion results. Therefore, low-carb dietary plans stress
the need to avoid simple carbohydrates as priority number 1.
Singing the sugar blues: Replacing
sugar with other sweeteners
Most low-carb dietary plans place refined sugars high on the list of dietary
components to avoid, the same area they occupy in any healthy lifestyle.
Here are some reasons to replace refined sugars for your sweet fix:
22
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

 Sugar is full of empty calories. Sugar provides no nutrients to your body.
 Sugar breaks down quickly in your bloodstream, dumping high levels of
insulin.
 Sugar is high on the list of the causes of weight gain, mood swings, and
even depression (sugar blues).
 Sugar wreaks some real havoc with your overall health and longevity by
suppressing your body’s immune response.
 Sugar, like all simple carbs, can create cravings, leaving your body want-
ing more. The more sugar you eat, the more you want.
Plus, most of the sweet stuff (sugar) is high in calories and can also have a
high fat count, especially baked goods. (See the “Meeting Your Metabolism:
Becoming Carb and Calorie Conscious” and “Knowing Thy Fats” sections
later in the chapter for more information on why healthy low-carb lifestyle
approaches stress the need to be aware of both calories and fats as well as
carbs.)
“The sweetening of America” has become a popular phrase, but one that isn’t
looked upon favorably. Sugar is one of the primary causes of a world of obese
people, with the numbers climbing every day. Sugar has no nutritional value
and is jam-packed with calories, calories, calories. Well, we do like it sweet,
so what now? Simple — find something that sweetens in place of sugar. There
are two types of sweeteners:
 Non-nutritive sweetener: These are referred to as sugar substitutes or
artificial sweeteners. The two terms are used interchangeably, so don’t
let it confuse you. Non-nutritive sweeteners supply neither energy nor
calories to the body. Most sugar substitutes simply pass through the
body and are excreted in urine.
 Nutritive sweeteners: These sweeteners do supply the body with energy
and calories. A couple examples of this category of sweeteners are corn
syrup and honey. Also included in this group are sugar alcohols and
polyols.
23
Chapter 2: Raising Your Total Carb Awareness
Sweet facts
The average sugar consumption in the United
States and around the world has skyrocketed.
In 1899, the average sugar consumption per
person in the United States was about 10
pounds of sugar per year. One hundred years
later, in 1999, the sugar consumption had
increased to an average of 170 pounds per
person per year. Interestingly enough, in 1899,
the incidence of heart disease, stroke, and dia-
betes was minimal. By 1999, those same dis-
eases were raging throughout the United States
and are reaching epidemic numbers today.

In the following sections, I help you sort out the sweetener thing in your low-
carb lifestyle.
Assessing artificial sweeteners
Sugar substitutes/artificial sweeteners are a very individual choice because
one may have an aftertaste for you and taste heavenly to another. One or a
combination of two may make drinks and foods taste sweeter to you, while
someone else finds the combination almost repulsive. I’m sure that you have
your very own favorite. The level of sweetness greatly varies with different
brands. Sometimes combining two different sweeteners creates a synergistic
effect, resulting in added sweetness from the combination. (See more about
the sugar substitute that I’ve chosen to use in the recipes in this book in
Chapter 4. And check out the “Sweet, sweeter, sweetest” sidebar in this chap-
ter for the history of some common sweeteners on the market today.)
Sugar substitutes make food taste sweet without the calories, but watch the
carb counts. By the teaspoon, they may have less than one gram of carbs, but
if you have a whole cupful, that’s a different story. A big marketing game is
played with the carb count of artificial sweeteners. Keep in mind that if a tea-
spoon of an artificial sweetener only contains a half of a carb and you need a
whole cup of that same sweetener in a recipe, those half carbs add up. Pay
attention to the calories as well because some sweeteners are being adver-
tised as no calorie but do indeed stack up calories in the same manner.
Be sure to always read labels to see what has been added to the foods that
you’re buying. You’ll see lots of food products on the market that are indeed
labeled sugar-free and low in net carbs. But when you read the labels, you
find that they are off the charts in calories, making them not good choices for
your low-carb healthy lifestyle (discover more about reading labels in
Chapter 3).
Sugar alcohols (Polyols)
Polyols and sugar alcohols are one and the same. Polyols are sugar-free sweet-
eners that are derived from plant products such as berries and fruits, various
corn syrups, from grain products like surplus corn. They’re used extensively
as sweeteners and bulking agents in a wide variety of foods including chew-
ing gums, candies, ice cream, baked goods, and fruit spreads. They’re also
used in toothpastes, mouthwashes, breath mints, and medicinal products
such as cough syrups and throat lozenges. The latest and greatest extensive
use for them is in low-carb sweets and treats such as low-carb protein bars,
cookies, candies, and ice cream — the list is a long one. Unlike sugar substi-
tutes/artificial sweeteners, they don’t come in little packets. They’re found
more readily in prepared low-carb sweet products than in your low-carb
pantry.
24
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

The name “sugar alcohol” is misleading to many because polyols are neither
sugar nor alcohol. It’s about their molecular construction. Part of the struc-
ture of sugar alcohols is similar to that of sugar, and some is similar to alco-
hol. Sugar alcohols contain no nutrients and no dietary fiber and are a low
digestible carbohydrate, which means that they have less of an impact on
blood glucose levels. Moderation is again the key. Because of the confusion
around the name “sugar alcohol,” these ingredients are referred to more and
more as polyols. The Food and Drug Administration will make the final deci-
sion whether sugar alcohols are actually renamed polyols.
Sugar alcohols are sometimes perceived as being calorie and carbohydrate free
but that’s not the case. Table sugar contains 4 calories per gram. The calorie
content of different sugar alcohols varies from 0.2 to 3.0 calories per gram, so
don’t be fooled. Be a savvy label reader. (In Chapter 3, I provide some tips on
reading nutrition labels, including sugar alcohol considerations.)
The sweetness varies among these sugar replacements. The most commonly
used polyols are
 Erythritol
 HSH (hydrogenated starch hydrolysates)
 Isomalt
 Lacitol

Sweet, sweeter, sweetest
What you use to satisfy your sweet tooth is your
choice, but here’s a brief look at the history of
sweetening the pot without refined table sugar
(please note that this is not an all-inclusive list).
All of these products are still available to you
today:
1879: Saccharin was discovered. It’s derived
from a natural substance in grapes and is 300
times sweeter than table sugar.
1931: Stevia is a plant from which two French
chemists produced a white crystalline sub-
stance that they named Stevioside. It’s 300 times
sweeter than table sugar. Stevia is currently
sold as a dietary supplement.
1965: Aspartame was discovered. It’s made of
amino acids and is 180 times sweeter than table
sugar. It was first approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981.
1967: Acesulfame potassium was discovered.
It’s 200 times sweeter than table sugar. It was
first approved by the FDA in 1988.
1978: Sucralose was discovered and then
tested for over 20 years. The FDA first approved
it in 1998. Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than
table sugar.

 Mannitol
 Sorbitol
 Xylitol
Broad controversy exists in the entire diet community of the universe, and the
subject of polyols is no different. Researchers can’t seem to agree whether
polyols are absorbed by your body or if they simply pass right on through.
Some folks in the “not absorbed” camp say that because they pass through
your body without absorption, it’s a good thing for your low-carb lifestyle and
doesn’t harm your body. Others jump up and down shouting that if polyols
merely pass through your body, because there’s no mechanism within your
body to process polyols, then they can’t possibly be good for you or your
health. Manufacturers add to the fires of the controversy by touting that even
if a portion of the polyol is absorbed into the bloodstream, it requires little or
no insulin, thus causing no spike in blood sugars. Here are a few points to con-
sider in making your dietary decisions:
 Looking at the upside of polyols: The sweet treats that can be made
with polyols are pretty incredible. You’ll find some tastier than others,
and some will be based on your personal preference, like anything else.
Polyols provide manufacturers with the bulk and texture of sugar for
their food products, as well as making the products very sweet to please
your low-carb sweet tooth. Some of the low-carb treats made with poly-
ols that are on the market can be downright decadent, making you beg
for more.
 Looking at the downside of polyols: Some polyols linger in your
intestines, inducing uncomfortable bloating, gas, and sometimes diar-
rhea. You may be extra sensitive to all or some polyols and experience a
sometimes-embarrassing laxative effect after eating them. Sometimes it
hits you almost immediately, and other times the bloating comes a little
later.
Factoring in fiber
Dietary fiber is essential in low-carb dietary plans. Dietary fiber is a complex
carbohydrate that the body doesn’t digest or absorb but moves through the
body. Fiber occupies a special position in the low-carb world because you get
to subtract it from your total carb counts when you track your carb intake
(see the “Understanding Net Carb Math 101” section for more information). In
fact, fiber is beneficial in weight management because it makes you feel full
for longer periods of time, squelching some of those cravings. Fiber is also
necessary stuff for regularity, especially with low-carb lifestyles.
High-fiber foods are beneficial for maintenance of your day-to-day health, but
most folks don’t get enough fiber in their diet. (The recommended daily
intake of fiber is 21 to 38 grams, depending on your gender and age.) Most
26
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

adults are lucky to get 10 to 15 grams. You find fiber in plant foods, such as
vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans, and fruits. There are two types
of fiber, soluble and insoluble, and you can read about them in the easy to
understand yet detailed chart in Figure 2-1, which outlines how fiber works in
your body better than a page full of words could.

Soluble fiber mixes with partially
digested food in the stomach.
After soluble fiber is ingested, it absorbs water and turns into a gel-like substance which entraps
food, sugars, cholesterol and fats in the stomach and carries them through
the digestive tract. Insoluble fiber passes through the system largely intact.

Chapter 2: Raising Your Total Carb Awareness

Understanding Net Carb Math 101
Though approaches may vary from plan to plan, a common thread runs
throughout the game of counting carbs: Certain carbohydrates have more
impact on the rise of blood glucose levels than others. For carb counters, you
see carbs referred to as high-impact and low-impact carbs. Low-impact carbs
simply mean that your body doesn’t metabolize them. (Check out the section
“Meeting Your Metabolism: Becoming Carb and Calorie Conscious,” later in
the chapter.) This is great news for the low-carb lifestyle! In a nutshell, when
you’re looking at a Nutrition Facts food label and you see the total carbohy-
drate count, you’re not finished yet — this is where knowing net carb math
101 is invaluable to you. This simple net carb formula is a useful tool in plan-
ning meals and snacks in your everyday low-carb lifestyle.
Because your body doesn’t digest dietary fiber and it’s not absorbed in the
body but rather “moves through” your body, you have the green light to sub-
tract the total grams of fiber from the total grams of carbs in a particular
serving of food, giving you your “net carbs” for that serving. If you’re a smart
low-carb cookie, you’ll take this to heart — all those fresh veggies and fruits
are full of fiber.
So the formula to determine net carbs in a given food is simply:
Total carbohydrates – Dietary fiber = Net carbs
A great example of net carb counts is a very healthy food — black soybeans.
The total carb count for a serving of 1⁄2 cup of black soybeans is 8 grams of
carbs. The dietary fiber count per 1⁄2 cup serving is 7 grams. When you sub-
tract the fiber count from the carb count, you get a whopping total of 1 gram
of net carbs for the entire 1⁄2 cup serving. This is healthy low-carb eating at its
best! (See a great chili recipe in Chapter 16 with black soybeans.)
But the low-carb diet world is constantly changing. These days, another for-
mula that some low-carbers use to mathematically eliminate additional carbs
from their bottom-line carb counts is called Net Impact Carbs or the Effective
Carb Count (ECC). The formula looks like this:
Total carbohydrates – Dietary fiber – Sugar alcohols (polyols) = Effective
Carb Count (ECC)
As you can see, the difference between the effective carb count and the net
carb count is a little thing called sugar alcohol. I’ll warn you that controversy
abounds over the use of this formula, and the heart of the controversy is
whether sugar alcohols actually affect your blood sugar levels (see the section
“Singing the sugar blues: Replacing sugar with other sweeteners,” earlier in this
28
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

chapter). You may sometimes hear or see Effective Carb Counts referred to as
“usable carb counts.”
There’s no legal definition of low carb, and carb counts vary greatly.
Weighing Your Carb Choices
All carbohydrates are not created equal. And carbs are not monsters. They
are just a force to be reckoned with in your healthy lifestyle. I don’t like the
connotation of “good” and “bad” when referring to carbs, so I’ll call them
“healthy” and “not so healthy” in this section if that’s okay with you. To make
it easy, healthy carbs, in general, are unprocessed foods and contain a good
amount of fiber. On the other side of the carb coin lie the not-so-healthy
carbs, which are usually refined or processed foods. Take responsibility for
being the judge and jury of the carbs in your food. Here are a few factors to
consider in making your daily judgment calls:
 How the carbs you choose affect your blood sugar (check out the
glycemic index and glycemic load info later in this chapter to see about
carbs and blood sugars)
 Your metabolism (mosey on down in this section to bone up on mighty
metabolism)
 The total calorie count (see the “Meeting Your Metabolism: Becoming
Carb and Calorie Conscious” section later in the chapter).
Substitute a couple high-calorie foods, such as high-fat meats and fast foods,
with natural foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and lean meat
every day, and you can reduce your carbs as well as your calories while you
increase your intake of nutrients that your body needs.
Healthy carbs
Healthy carbs are those that are as unprocessed as possible in their natural
and whole form. Include more healthy carbs in your low-carb lifestyle. Some
healthy carbs need to be consumed in moderation, and some choices in each
group are considered more low-carb acceptable than others (see Chapter 3
for the details). Here are some examples of healthy carbs:
 Plant-based foods (veggies are key)
 Certain fresh fruits
29
Chapter 2: Raising Your Total Carb Awareness

 Certain dairy products
 Lean meats
 Fish and seafood
 Poultry
 Nuts and seeds
 Whole grains (in moderation)
 Legumes (in moderation)
Because healthy carbs are slow to metabolize in your body, they help you
avoid spikes in your glycemic index (see more on the glycemic index in the
section “Surveying Blood-Sugar Levels and Their Role in a Low-Carb Lifestyle,”
later in this chapter).
Sharpen your carb consciousness and discover that fresh is best. The more
fresh foods that you can pack into your low-carb healthy lifestyle, the more of
a winner you become. I provide you with a shopping list of healthy low-carb
fresh foods in Chapter 3. (And you can also check out Chapter 23 for Web
sites that provide both lists and searchable databases for determining exact
carb counts in foods.)
Carbs that aren’t so healthy
Simple carbs are absorbed by your body so quickly that they immediately hit
your bloodstream with a rush, and an almost instantaneous gush of insulin fol-
lows. This gush floods the cells with the simple sugar of energy for your body.
This process takes you on what you might know as a sugar high, whether you
have ingested sugar or another simple carbohydrate. You experience a quick
surge of energy and then a crash that usually comes with a craving. Not a
healthy situation for you or your healthy low-carb lifestyle. (See the section
“Surveying Blood-Sugar Levels and Their Role in a Low-Carb Lifestyle,” later in
this chapter.) Some of these “not-so-healthy carbs” include but are not limited
to the following products:
 Refined sugars and products containing refined sugars, such as dough-
nuts, cookies, cakes, candies, and soda
 White flours and products containing white flours, such as breads, pizza,
pastas, and noodles
 White rice
 Highly processed foods of all kinds, even foods like luncheon meats,
some frozen meals, and meals in a box

Meeting Your Metabolism: Becoming
Carb and Calorie Conscious
Despite what the headlines and ads say, low-carb dieting isn’t a magic bullet
that instantly sheds pounds and inches, never to have them return. I’m here
to make the case that you should take your healthy low-carb active lifestyle
very personally. Don’t be afraid of blending low-carb lifestyle blueprints until
you find the one that fits your body perfectly. And don’t be afraid to become
both carb and calorie conscious.
Reinserting calories into the
metabolism discussion
Although many low-carb plans shy away from discussing the calories, calorie
considerations are a reality. Where? In the focus on metabolism. Metabolism
is very simply the rate at which your body burns calories. And although
minding your metabolism is rightly a key plank in many low-carb approaches,
somehow the calorie part drops out of the discussion. Well, I’m here to put it
back in so that you can see it’s okay to consider the calories.
A lot of low-carb diets pay little or no attention to calories — it’s all about
carbs. But if you can’t figure out why you haven’t lost many pounds, although
you’ve been on a low-carb diet for six months and you’re bored to tears with
the food, it’s high time you become carb and calorie enlightened. I know that
a lot of the low-carb books won’t even go here. But I will.
Be serious about controlling your carbs in your lifestyle, but don’t fluff off the
calories. You can see the importance of considering calories while trying to
reach and maintain a healthy weight by simply considering what a calorie is.
A calorie is simply a measure of energy that the food you eat produces when
it’s used by your body. Ah, but the key part in that definition of a calorie is
the phrase used by your body. It’s a fact that if you don’t burn up those calo-
ries (use up that energy), you store them in your body as fat. There’s no get-
ting around it.
It’s not rocket science, and it doesn’t take a roomful of diet gurus to explain
it. The math is actually very simple: If you take in 900 calories worth of
energy in the foods you eat and you use only 600 of those calories, those
other 300 calories have to go somewhere. So they pick a bunch of your
body’s cells to call home and set up camp. Camp calories have a more
common name: fat.
31
Chapter 2: Raising Your Total Carb Awareness

Carbs and calories go hand in hand for long-term success with your healthy
low-carb lifestyle, from the grocery store to the table to your tummy. Be
aware that some processed foods out there that have low-carb stamped all
over them have a calorie count that is sky high (see Chapter 3 for more on
low-carb foods that can keep you fat).
Speaking of calories — eating just 100 more calories a day adds up to 10 extra
pounds in one year. But the good news is that if you eat just 100 less calories
every day, you would lose an extra 10 pounds in one year.
Working on metabolism mechanics
Being smart about your healthy lifestyle means you watch your carbs and
your calories too and move your body more every day. You want to keep
those metabolic fires a burnin’ however you can and not give those fat cells
squatter’s rights to your body!
Everyone’s metabolic rate (the rate at which your body uses calories) burns
at a different level. No two bodies are alike. Metabolic rates can be affected
by age, by gender, by how healthy your body is, by what you eat (different
foods are metabolized at different rates), by how often you eat (or don’t eat),
by how much you move every day, and even sometimes by medications that
you take. And not only does everyone’s metabolic fire burn at a different
level, but the fires change daily. This is why the formula of ingesting 2,000
calories and burning 2,000 calories has its merit, but it’s not a watertight,
absolute formula. We’re all different, and it may take me a lot longer to burn
2,000 calories than it does you.
The metabolic key to losing and maintaining weight by using a healthy, 
low-carb lifestyle is kick-starting your metabolism in the morning, keeping it
humming along at a constant pace by snacking on low-carb friendly foods
throughout the day, and increasing that pace by moving your body more.
Stoking the fire with breakfast
Your metabolic rate also fluctuates throughout the day. When you go to bed
at night, your metabolism slows. (So forget about that magical losing-weight-
while-you-sleep stuff that you see on TV and in the magazines at the checkout
counter in the grocery store. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.)
Your metabolism is at its lowest point when you wake up in the morning.
That’s why breakfast is the most important meal — not only to feed your
hungry body but also to fuel your metabolic furnace fires so they start burn-
ing calories (energy) early in the day. (See Chapter 6 for more on the impor-
tance of breakfast.)
32
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

When your brain says, “I’m hungry,” what it’s really telling you is that you
need energy (calories). The minute you swallow some food, it ignites your
metabolic fire and starts burning that energy. If you skip breakfast, your
metabolic fires will keep on smoldering, as they do throughout the night.
Grazing on good carbs
After you have those metabolic fires kick-started, the key is to keep them
going. It’s just like throwing another log on the fire to keep it burning —
that’s what food does for your metabolic fire. Grazing is the art of not getting
hungry by using smart snacks and goodies to keep your metabolic fires burn-
ing. This results in your being more satisfied, all the while burning calories
and fat, which means that you are either losing weight or maintaining your
ideal weight. Let me tell you what grazing is not in your low-carb healthy
lifestyle: Grazing isn’t a license to stuff yourself and overeat.
Eat several small meals a day — every two or three hours — and graze those
cravings away before they pop up. Grazing has been a well-kept secret in the
diet genre for years, but its merit is being more and more recognized as yo-yo
diets fail and healthy lifestyles succeed. Chose smart low-carb snacks with
plenty of fiber and protein, and your blood sugar levels will remain on an
even keel. This prevents spikes in insulin levels, keeping your body more bal-
anced and providing you with more energy and alertness and a better atti-
tude. Be smarter than your hunger and get in front of it before that hunger
screams, “I’m starving, feed me.” When you become a grazer, you never feel
deprived, and grazing just becomes routine — it’s what you do when you’re
living low-carb for life. Feel full and lose weight!
I don’t care what kind of excuse you have, never skip a meal. It doesn’t have
to be a full-on sit-down meal, and eating on the run sometimes is unavoid-
able. But just eat, okay?
Eating smaller and more frequent meals and snacking on healthy low-carb
foods is a standard approach in many low-carb dietary plans. And it can
work: It keeps the fires of your metabolism burning at a higher rate, thus pre-
venting your body from storing the energy as fat.
The basic approach of many low-carb diets — eating as much as you want
while losing weight — can be very attractive. However, buyer beware. The
secret to eating more while losing weight is in what you’re eating. The reality
is that this is only true when you choose foods and snacks that are healthy
carbs with low carb counts, high fiber counts, and low calories (see the sec-
tion “Weighing Your Carb Choices,” earlier in this chapter, for more on
healthy and not-so-healthy carbs, and check out the low-carb shopping list I
provide in Chapter 3).
33
Chapter 2: Raising Your Total Carb Awareness

Moving and metabolism
Try taking a short walk at break time or lunch during your busy day. The
exercise of moving — yes, just moving your body does it — fuels your meta-
bolic fire. Fueling your fires doesn’t only burn calories; it gives you more
energy. Want to know a secret about your metabolism and your weight? I
don’t care what diet you’re on or what you eat (well, I really do, but . . .), if
you don’t combine your healthy low-carb lifestyle with moving more, the pos-
sibility of derailing your lifestyle increases greatly. Cutting through it all, if
you burn energy (calories) equal to what you take in, you can maintain your
weight. If you burn more energy (calories) than you take in, you lose weight,
add tone to your muscles and your body, have more energy, and even elimi-
nate stress.
Surveying Blood-Sugar Levels and 
Their Role in a Low-Carb Lifestyle
Once upon a time, you only heard about the glycemic index (GI) with refer-
ence to diabetes. But today, you can find entire diet plans that are structured
purely around the glycemic index! Things do change. The GI was developed
to provide a ranking of the potential of different types of carbohydrate-
containing foods to raise the blood sugar levels in the body on a scale of 0 to
100. Carbohydrates that raise the blood sugar the fastest have the highest
glycemic index.
Here’s how the whole blood-sugar thing works. Eating foods high in carbohy-
drates, such as white potatoes, causes a rapid rise in blood sugar levels. Your
body says, “Wait a minute. I need to regulate this — my blood sugar levels
are going up!” Your pancreas is put on notice and begins to dump excessive
amounts of insulin to level out your blood sugar. Insulin is a natural hormone
that the body manufactures and is responsible for getting the sugar out of
your blood by delivering it to most your body’s cells at a rapid rate. Your
cells absorb what’s now simple sugar, or energy. Now here’s the whammy: If
your cells don’t use this energy immediately, your body stores it as fat. How’s
that for the long way around to simply say weight gain and control is all
about energy in equaling energy out? If you don’t burn up the same amount of
energy that you take in, you get fat or fatter!
To add insult to injury, because the insulin has done its job in leveling out
your body’s sugar levels by delivering the simple sugar in the form of energy
to your cells, as your cells use the energy quickly, your blood sugar falls
rapidly, creating low blood sugar and mood swings. This results in a sudden
34
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

dip in energy and increased carbohydrate cravings. Your body is saying, “I
want more sugar (technically referred to as glucose), please.” These peaks
and valleys of your blood sugar spiking and crashing become a vicious cycle
that’s not only uncomfortable for your body but also very unhealthy.
Many diet plans suggest eating foods that are low on the glycemic index with
your low-carb lifestyle. These foods that are low in carbs and generally high
in fiber keep you off the blood-sugar roller coaster. Because fiber is absorbed
slowly, your blood sugar just merrily glides along fairly evenly without spik-
ing. These foods satisfy your hunger for longer periods of time, and your
cravings are better controlled. An added bonus to this whole schematic is
that it aids in the prevention of diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart dis-
ease, and obesity.
Glycemic index scores
The GI was developed for research purposes and doesn’t apply to portion
sizes in your everyday meals, and that’s where the confusion about the GI
comes from. But here’s a look at the standard glycemic index:
 Low: A rating of 0 to 54 turns to glucose more slowly.
 Medium: A rating of 55 to 69 turns to glucose at a moderate rate.
 High: A rating of 70 or higher turns to glucose very quickly.
Check out www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm for what I think to be the most
comprehensive and complete list of glycemic index and glycemic load foods
currently on the Web. This list can help you make good food choices for your
healthy low-carb lifestyle. Basically, if a food is low on the GI/GL scale (see
more about the GL in the next section, “Enter the glycemic load”), then it’s
generally low carb and doesn’t cause what’s known in the low-carb world as
an insulin spike. Therefore, your blood sugars stay on an even keel. This is
what the low-carb healthy lifestyle is really all about — keeping you off that
blood-sugar roller coaster!
In addition to foods being low on the GI, it’s important that they be low in
sugar and salt, be high in fiber, and contain good fats. Another way to con-
ceptualize this whole glycemic index thing is to check out the Glycemic Index
Food Pyramid (in Figure 2-2). The base of the pyramid contains foods that are
low on the glycemic index and are encouraged within low-carb lifestyles. The
next level up from the base contains foods still at home in low-carb lifestyles.
The top two levels contain high-glycemic foods. Foods at the top level of the
pyramid are avoided in low-carb dietary plans, and foods in the second level
from the top are eaten only in restricted moderation.

Enter the glycemic load
The drawback of the glycemic index of foods is that it’s not based on ordinary
portion sizes. Instead, it’s based on a standard portion containing 50 grams of
usable carbs.
Take two and enter stage left — the glycemic load (GL). Now we’re getting
somewhere! The GL is much more user friendly because it takes into account
the base of the glycemic index of carbohydrates in foods, and it’s also based
in standard portion measurements of foods. For glycemic load values for
basic food types, go to www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm. (See Chapter 23 for
more information about this Web site and more free low-carb information at
your fingertips.)
The glycemic load ratings look like this:
 Low: A rating of 0 to 10
 Medium: A rating of 11 to 19
 High: A rating of 20 and higher

Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

The following are foods high on the GL scale. Look familiar? Most of these
foods are featured in the “Carbs that aren’t so healthy” section, earlier in the
chapter.
 Most processed foods
 White rice
 White flour and white flour products, such as white bread and dinner rolls
 Foods containing high amounts of refined sugar
 Soft drinks and fruit juices with high sugar content
 Cakes, candies, cookies, and brownies
 High sugar/white flour desserts
Choose foods with low GL ratings for your low-carb lifestyle, and it’s a win-win
situation. You’re more likely to burn the calories from foods with a low GL as
energy during the course of your day. Nonstarchy veggies have glycemic loads
of almost zero because of their high fiber content, so they’re great low-carb
foods for you to nibble on.
Low GL carbs doesn’t mean that they’re free foods and you can just chow
down. Be sure to look at the calorie counts on the charts, too, so you’re not
misled and end up gaining rather than losing weight. For instance, brown rice
has a GI of 55 and a GL of 18, which puts brown rice in the medium range of
the GL rating. Don’t make this difficult, even though I’ve thrown some pretty
technical stuff at you. Just remember that the GL rating of the food is impor-
tant and get yourself a list of foods. As time passes, you’ll just know as you
settle into a low-carb lifestyle — you’ll know what works for you.
When your body tells you that it’s hungry, give it water first. If it still tells you
that it’s hungry, then feed it. Many times, people mistake being thirsty for
being hungry. So initially try answering your body’s request for replenish-
ment with that nutritive carb- and calorie-free substance, water.
Knowing Thy Fats
Don’t think you were going to get out of this chapter without a few words on
fats. Your body requires fat to promote its energy reserves, which provide
your body with more than double the energy of protein and carbs. Fats aid
your body in the absorption of essential fat-soluble vitamins, including vita-
mins A, D, E, and K. Fats are regulators of nutrients in and out of your cells
and supply insulation and protection of vital organs.
37
Chapter 2: Raising Your Total Carb Awareness

There are different types of fat that you should familiarize yourself with —
some are good guys and some are bad guys. Sometimes, when people hear
the words low-carb dietary plan, they instantly assume the plan must feature
a high-fat diet. Don’t get me wrong; some plans are clearly on the high-fat
side. But many others take a more balanced view of all things nutrition and
consider the amounts and types of fat involved. What’s important is for you
to know your fats and know which fats are good for you. Here’s a brief
overview of the good, the bad, and the very ugly:
 Saturated fats are the guys that give fats a bad rap. Some foods that are
high in saturated fats include fatty fresh and processed meats, lard,
high-fat dairy products, regular ice cream, the fat and skin of poultry,
coconut oil, palm oil, and shortening. Excessive ingestion of saturated
fats can raise your blood cholesterol, and that’s not a good thing.
 Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are considered healthy
fats for you. Foods that are high in monounsaturated and polyunsatu-
rated fats include olive oil, canola oil, flaxseeds, sesame seeds, most
nuts, sardines, salmon, and avocados. Healthy fats regulate fat metabo-
lism and aid in regulating insulin release. These fatty acids have little
effect on the level of cholesterol in the blood (see more on healthy
omega-3s in Chapter 9). Keep in mind to check the calorie count on
healthy fats, with moderation as the keyword.
 Trans fats are partially hydrogenated oils that raise your LDL (bad 
cholesterol) and lower your HDL (good cholesterol). This double
whammy should tell you to steer clear of trans fats. They’re found in
highly processed foods of all kinds, shapes, and sizes; the oil in mar-
garines; french fries; beef; lamb; and dairy products — just to name a
few. Please read your labels (see more about label reading in Chapter 3).
A diet high in saturated fat causes your body to make more cholesterol,
which is linked with the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers,
and heart disease.

whether you’ve been a low-carber for a while or you’re new to the low-carb
lifestyle. I put you through sort of a carb cleansing process for your kitchen!
Then I present a list of staples to fill your shelves, fridge, and freezer, and I
take you to the grocery store for a little low-carb outing. While at the grocery
store, there’s a brief lesson on reading labels and scoping out the low-carb
products that are on the shelves in the store. So stick with me; a lot of great
foods are coming up.
Shaping Up Your Low-Carb Kitchen
Congratulations! You’re going to clean out your kitchen and make a donation
to your favorite shelter or soup kitchen. If this were a new reality television
show, it might be called Low-Carb Kitchen Makeover!

Cutting carbs in the pantry
Face it — some items in your pantry have to go. They just don’t belong in
your healthy low-carb lifestyle. Pull out those high-carb and sugar-laden
items lurking on your shelves. Box them up, and you’re off to make your
donation. Doesn’t it feel great to help others while you make room for all the
staples you need to whip up great low-carb meals? Here are the food items to
look for to pack in your donation box or even boxes:
 Biscuit mixes
 Canned foods like baked beans, candied yams, and sugary pie fillings
 Cereals full of sugar and high in carbs
 Chocolate bars, chocolate syrups, and any other food covered in choco-
late or accompanied by it
 Cookies, candies, packaged cakes, and sweet treats
 Crackers high in carbs, sodium, and fat, such as saltines
 Gelatins that aren’t sugar-free
 Jams that aren’t sugar-free, unless they’re natural fruit spreads
 Mixes — cake, brownie, and muffin
 Oils high in saturated fats
 Packaged quick meals, such as macaroni and cheese
 Pasta
 Peanut butter, unless it’s the natural kind
 Potato chips, corn chips, cheese puffs, pretzels, and any other high-carb
snack items
 Puddings that aren’t sugar-free
 Syrups and toppings, such as pancake syrup and ice cream toppings,
laden with sugar
 Vegetable shortenings laden with trans fats
 White breads, including high-carb pita pockets, tortillas, dinner rolls,
biscuits, croutons, and prepackaged breadcrumbs
 White flours
 White rice
Please note that I don’t profess this to be an all-inclusive list but rather a
guide, because every kitchen has different foods stuffed away that are
labeled “temptation.” Also, you may have already done some partial carb
40
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

cleaning, and if you’ve already replaced some of the items I list here with carb-
acceptable food, then of course you get to keep it! And if you’re a parent of
young kids or there are other folks in your house not quite willing to make the
same changes, try isolating the remaining carb-laden foods in one cabinet. 
Cleaning out the fridge and freezer
The next stop in your cleaning frenzy is the fridge and freezer. If you think you
should just keep that frozen lasagna around for the day when a non-low-carb
friend drops by, forget about it! It needs to go now. Otherwise, on a chilly, rainy
night when you come home from work tired and hungry and don’t know what’s
for dinner, guess what? That lasagna is history.
If you’re going to donate your refrigerated and frozen stuff, you probably
need to tackle this one on a Saturday morning so you can deliver it still cold
or frozen. Here are the foods you should get rid of. They have high carb
counts, and therefore, they no longer belong in your fridge or freezer:
 Frozen quick meals high in carbs, sodium, fats, and calories, like frozen
lasagna and potpies
 Frozen cheesecakes and other sweet delights, such as pies
 Ice cream and other high-carb, high-sugar, frozen treats
 Jams that aren’t sugar free, unless they’re natural fruit spreads
 Juices high in sugar
 Marinades, sauces, and salad dressings high in sugar
 Milk (high in sugar and carb counts)
 Refrigerated biscuits, croissants, cinnamon rolls, Danishes, and other
similar sweet rolls
 Soft drinks that aren’t diet or made with Splenda
Creating a List of Low-Carb
Staples, Aisle by Aisle
Your priority is to stock your kitchen with healthy, low-carb foods. Even
though you have a good idea of what those foods are, you may not have a
clue where to start in making a low-carb shopping list for staples. The whole
idea is for you to have on hand what you need when you need it. Stocking up
prevents unplanned trips to the grocery store, which in turn helps you avoid
temptation and saves you time. Saving time is truly important in the rush of
41
Chapter 3: Organizing and Shopping for the Low-Carb Kitchen

everyday life. And if you can whip up low-carb, delicious meals quickly
because you’ve done just a smidgen of pre-planning and have shopped for
necessary ingredients, you’ll receive gold stars — in both preparing meals
and saving time.
Keep in mind that some of the staples I list in this section may not apply
to your household. And you don’t have to buy them all; you have to make
choices. This isn’t a “must have” list by any means. To set yourself up for 
success in stocking your low-carb kitchen, be aware that you’re realistically
going to take two or three trips to the grocery store to be well stocked. You
can’t do it all in one fell swoop. Also, check out Chapter 20, where I provide
additional tips and meal-planning advice to save you time and carbs.
Likewise, if you’re following a particular low-carb dietary plan, not all of these
staples may be on your personal list. The foods I cover in the following sec-
tions are generally low-carb friendly, and if they’re a bit on the higher side of
the ol’ carb count, I let you know.
But if you’re looking for exact carb counts, post a general carb gram counter
on your fridge. If you prefer one of those little gram-counter booklets, get cre-
ative: Attach it to a magnet and stick it on your fridge! Put it right next to one
of those magnetized shopping lists. You can pick these up at bookstores or in
grocery stores by the magazines at the checkout counters. Check your gram
counter while you make your list. For more information on nutritional analy-
sis and carb counts, check out www.nutrtiondata.com for an extensive
analysis and Chapter 23 for more on what this site has to offer you.
When you go to the grocery store, try not to go when you’re hungry. If your
stomach is growling, take along a zipper bag of your favorite nuts for a snack
while you shop, and have a small bottle of water with you.
Produce department
Remember not to buy too many of one fresh fruit or vegetable. Consider how
many days the item will store well — as you know, apples store much longer
than lettuce, for example.
Some fruits and veggies that are high in carb counts are also high in fiber,
which makes the net carb count fine for your lifestyle (see Chapter 2 on net
carbs).
Veggies
The first stop is the veggie section (see Chapter 12 for more information on
veggies). Veggies are both healthy and carb bargains whether they’re on sale
or regularly priced. They’re brimming with nutrients and disease fighters.
42
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

The vegetables in the following list contain less starch than others, and
they’re all packed with fiber:
 Alfalfa sprouts
 Artichokes
 Asparagus
 Avocados
 Bean sprouts
 Bell peppers of all colors
 Bok choy
 Broccoli and broccoflower
 Brussels sprouts
 Cabbage
 Carrots
 Cauliflower
 Celery
 Fresh salad greens and lettuces
 Garlic
 Green beans
 Herbs of all kinds, like fresh basil, dill, rosemary, thyme, chives, cilantro,
tarragon, and bay leaf
 Leeks
 Mushrooms of all kinds
 Okra
 Onions — red, yellow, and fresh green ones
 Parsley
 Pumpkin
 Radishes
 Rhubarb
 Scallions (green onions)
 Spinach
 String beans
 Squashes — zucchini, eggplant, and cucumbers
43
Chapter 3: Organizing and Shopping for the Low-Carb Kitchen

Other squashes are acceptable but have higher carb counts, so be sure to
check the nutritional counts. Yellow and winter squash are good choices.
 Tomatoes of all varieties
 Turnips
 Wax beans
Even though some low-carbers look at carrots as having higher carb counts,
the nutrient values are off the charts. Baby carrots are a great option for
snacking and cooking too. You don’t have to peel them or cut them up.
Remember that you can buy precut veggies for snacking and for cooking.
They’re a bit more expensive, but you have to be the judge on how valuable
your time is in cutting all that stuff up!
Fruits
The next stop in the produce department is the fruit section. Unlike the
advice I give concerning veggies in the preceding section, I advise you to skip
the precut fruit. You’ll find that some have added sugars and preservatives —
two things that you want to steer clear of with your low-carb lifestyle. Fruits
and low-carb living can be a controversial combination. It’s about choices
and balance, but fresh fruit should be a part of the rest of your life. Berries of
all kinds are the least controversial in the fruit department because the fiber
makes berries lower in carbs. Here are some other suggestions:
 Apples and pears (these are a little higher in natural sugar content and
aren’t for every day but are still on the list!)
 Apricots (another treat item)
 Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, and boysenberries
 Cranberries
 Grapes (in moderation)
 Kiwi fruit
 Mangoes (as a special treat — maybe a mango salsa)
 Melons — watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe (not for every day)
 Nectarines and peaches (also a little high on the natural sugar content)
 Pineapple (another moderation treat)
 Plums (the dark ones are the best)
 Sweet cherries
 Tangerines, oranges, grapefruit, and lemons
44
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

Nuts and seeds
In many grocery stores, you can also find nuts in the produce section. In spe-
cialty and health food stores, they’re usually in the bulk goods area. I encour-
age you to buy nuts from the produce section or at a specialty or health food
store — and avoid the nut offerings in the baking aisle. Why? You’re looking
for raw or minimally processed nuts. They’re healthier, the carb counts are
lower, and they don’t contain preservatives.
Many nuts and seeds are acceptable in low-carb lifestyles. Ideas include
almonds (raw, toasted, roasted, slivered), Brazil nuts, hazelnuts (you can
make flour out of them too!), pecans (plain, toasted, sliced), pistachios,
pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and walnuts. Some are higher in fats and
carb counts, such as cashews, macadamia nuts, peanuts, and pine nuts, but
you can enjoy them in moderation. Check out Chapter 14, where I provide
additional nutty tips, tricks, and recipes.
Canned and jarred goods
Let’s move right along to the canned goods section. In this section, I include a
few items that come in cans to embellish your fresh, low-carb cooking. I don’t
include canned veggies, because I encourage you to buy fresh or frozen ones.
But you may want to keep particular canned veggies like water chestnuts on
hand to include in some of your low-carb dishes if you really like them — it’s
one that I keep on hand to throw in my stir-fry dishes.
 Anchovies
 Applesauce with no added sugar
 Black soybeans
 Broth — chicken and beef
Check the sodium counts, because they vary greatly.
 Capers
 Crab
 Dill pickles
 Fruit spreads with no added sugar
 Fruits with no added sugar or the low-carb brands
 Green chiles
 Horseradish
 Jellies and jams, sugar-free
 Low-carb ketchup
45
Chapter 3: Organizing and Shopping for the Low-Carb Kitchen

Regular ketchup has a very high sugar content, so it’s best to pass it up.
 Maple syrup, sugar-free
 Mayonnaise, not salad dressing
 Mushrooms
 Mustard
Feel free to indulge in Dijon and specialty mustards; just check the sugar
content.
 Olives — black and green
 Peanut butter, all natural
 Pumpkin
 Roasted red peppers
 Salad dressings
Watch the sugar and fat counts as similar prepared salad dressings held
side by side may appear quite the same until you turn the bottle over
and read the label.
 Sardines
 Shrimp
 Soy sauce
 Tomatoes — whole and some sauces
It’s label-reading time because canned tomatoes vary dramatically in carb
and sugar counts. Find one that you like that has low counts in both and
then stick with that brand on your shopping list. (See Chapter 8 for more
info on and recipes with tomatoes.)
 Tuna, white meat chicken, and salmon
All three of these come in vacuum-sealed pouches in spring water. I find
that the quality is better in the pouch, but that’s certainly a personal
choice.
 Vinegars — balsamic, cider, and red wine
 Water chestnuts
 Worcestershire sauce
Many canned vegetables are high in sodium. To reduce the sodium and
create a better tasting dish, drain and rinse the canned veggies.

Grains and breads
No entire food group should be totally eliminated from a healthy low-carb
lifestyle. With grains and breads, you just have to tweak it to the low-carb
side a little with moderation — not elimination — in mind. Whole grains pro-
vide your body with fiber and vitamins. When you’re choosing a bread that
you can enjoy, make sure that it’s made from whole grain or choose a low-
carb bread. I’ve been fortunate to find a whole-grain crunchy soy bread that
has no flour added that’s just delicious. The low-carb whole-wheat tortillas
and pita pockets are also good. (Skip on over to Chapter 15 for some great
wrap recipes.) The following is a list of grains and breads that can be a part
of a healthy low-carb lifestyle in moderation:
 Bread — low-carb or one made with whole-grain wheat flour
 Crackers — whole-grain
 Oatmeal — steel cut or old-fashioned
 Pita pockets — low-carb whole-wheat
 Rice — brown or wild
 Tortillas — low-carb whole-wheat
Baking aisle
This is an aisle of temptation, so make your list, get your stuff, and get the
heck out of there.
 Almond flour
 Bouillon cubes
 Cocoa powder
 Coconut, shredded and unsweetened
 Coconut milk, unsweetened
 Extracts — assorted flavors
 Gelatins, sugar-free
 Nonstick cooking spray
 Oils — canola, olive, and walnut (see Chapter 8 for a walnut oil salad
dressing recipe)
 Puddings, sugar-free
 Sesame seeds
 Spices and dried herbs of all kinds
47
Chapter 3: Organizing and Shopping for the Low-Carb Kitchen

 Splenda or the sugar substitute of your choice
 Unsweetened baker’s chocolate
 Whole-wheat flour (stone ground and white)
 Whole-wheat pastry flour
You have my permission to spend some time in the dried herbs and spices
section. You can find wonderful items here that make all the difference in
the world in your low-carb cooking. If you aren’t familiar with cooking with
herbs and spices, it’s a tasty adventure to embark on. Because you’re cooking
lean meats, fish, poultry, and veggies in your low-carb lifestyle, and you’re
cutting down on fats and sweeteners, using spices can enhance the flavors
dramatically.
Spices should always enhance the natural flavor of the food and never over-
whelm it. A little often goes a long way, and it’s always better to err on the
light side, because you can always add more.
If spices seem expensive to you, watch for them on sale, because grocery
stores run significant specials from time to time. My dollar store has a huge
variety of spices, and they’re just dandy.
Dairy case
Dairy products provide your body with calcium to build strong bones and
nutrients that are necessary to help your body prevent osteoporosis. The key
to the dairy case is label reading. Yogurt, for instance, isn’t banned, but you
need to compare the calories, the sugar, and the carbs and make a low-carb
decision on which one to choose.
If you have a recipe that calls for milk, you can make your own version by
using a light or heavy cream and mixing it with an equal amount of water. The
carb counts are lower, there’s little if any sugar content, and it makes dishes
much creamier and tastier.
Here are some friendly dairy choices:
 Butter
 Cheeses of all kinds
Don’t forget shredded cheeses like mozzarella, cheddar, and Parmesan
and the crumbly ones like blue and feta.
 Cottage cheese
 Cream cheese
 Mascarpone cheese
48
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

 Eggs, egg whites, and egg substitutes (see Chapter 13 for great meringue
recipes)
 Half-and-half
 Heavy and light cream
 Hummus
 Milk
You may prefer soymilk, or you may use a low-carb milk product. Just be
sure to check the carb and sugar counts.
 Sour cream
 Tofu
 Yogurt, plain
Some great Greek yogurts are available that are very low in carbs. There
are also a lot of low-carb yogurts, but be sure to check the calorie counts
on them.
Meat counter and fish market
The choices you make at the meat counter and fish market are very impor-
tant to you and your low-carb lifestyle. Choosing lean meats and fresh fish
gets you off to a great start. For more detailed information on fish, chicken,
and meat, flip to Chapters 9, 10, and 11, respectively. Most fish have close to
zero carb counts depending on the preparation and provide your body with
some great nutrients. Lean meats provide you with lots of great protein. An
outstanding benefit of both fish and meat is that they can be ready and on
the table very quickly.
Deli counter
You know what you find at the deli counter — more temptation with all those
carb- and sugar-laden salads and side dishes. But what you need to limit your-
self to are fresh deli meats and maybe some cheeses sliced at the counter. Deli
meats from the counter contain fewer preservatives than the prepackaged
meats.
Frozen food section
I know you’ve shopped the produce section and the meat and fish counter for
fresh. But you need back-up so you don’t have to run to the store every day
(see Chapter 20 on planning ahead). Also, you may prefer frozen veggies over
49
Chapter 3: Organizing and Shopping for the Low-Carb Kitchen

fresh ones, which is fine, just as long as you eat those veggies! There are
other good low-carb choices awaiting you in the frozen food section, includ-
ing stir-fry veggie combinations, fruits, fish, shellfish, meats, low-carb accept-
able frozen dinners, and some frozen low-carb dessert treats. I suggest you
cruise the frozen-food section of several different stores. I don’t know about
where you live, but different grocery stores in my area don’t always have the
same products.
 Edamame: These frozen green soybeans are great in soups and stews.
Sometimes I just boil some, add a little salt, and have them as a snack.
They’re filling and very good for you.
 Frozen chicken fajitas and shrimp stir-fries: Some of these are perfectly
low-carb acceptable, so scope them out.
 Frozen dinners: Some of these entrees are especially prepared for the
low-carb lifestyle. Still, the cardinal rule exists that you don’t just read the
front of the box. Turn it over and read all of the nutritional information.
 Frozen desserts: Sugar-free freezer pops are one of my favorite treats,
and you’ll find low-carb ice creams in lots of flavors, ice cream bars, and
ice cream sandwiches. I send up a flag of caution to be sure and check
the calorie counts, not just the net carbs on these products (collect
more information on calories in Chapter 2). And watch those sugar 
alcohols too.
 Frozen meats and fish: Some folks prefer the convenience of having
frozen meats and fish on hand. I mention this just so you know that you
don’t have to buy fresh to be successful at low-carb living.
 Fruits: Choose only the kinds with no added sugar. The quality of frozen
fruits has come a long way. I buy frozen peaches for my smoothie treats
all the time and just pop them in the blender. Frozen blueberries and red
raspberries are other great choices.
 Veggies: They come in all kinds and are usually cut up and ready to be
cooked. I suggest you try stir-fry vegetables. The combination of frozen
stir-fried veggies has blossomed into a lot of choices. And many fit well
in your low-carb lifestyle.
Be careful when choosing frozen stir-fry veggies, because some of them
contain sauces that are loaded with sugars and preservatives. Choose
the plain kind.
Putting the Low-Carb Aisle on the Map
You’re cruising the grocery store with your fine list, and you have all your
fresh foods in your low-carb grocery cart — way to go! And there it is — the
low-carb aisle. You screech your cart to a halt, almost ramming into the little
boy running after his mother, and take a quick right turn into the low-carb
50
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

aisle. Have you ever seen so many products with “low-carb” tattooed on the
front of them? May I offer a few words of advice? Read the labels very carefully.
Most grocery stores have put the low-carb aisle on their map of the store (did
you know that most grocery stores actually have maps available?). All of the
low-carb products may not be on the designated low-carb aisle. You may find
some great low-carb cookies on the cookie aisle, and that would be a marketing
issue. If you’re craving cookies and following the low-carb lifestyle and you
wander off track to the cookie aisle, the manufacturer has made it an easy
choice for you! In some stores, you’ll find duplicates depending on shelf space.
For example, low-carb salad dressings are in the low-carb aisle and in the salad
dressing section, too. All of this depends on the grocery store, so become
familiar with the plans that the stores you shop most frequently have adopted.
Some of the new low-carb products you’ll discover are nothing short of fabu-
lous, and they make great additions to your low-carb lifestyle. They allow you
to enjoy a variation of the tastes and textures of sugar-laden and carbohydrate-
laden foods that are definitely off limits. What a blessing these fine products
are. Unfortunately, there always have to be a few that jump on the bandwagon
for reasons other than helping folks with their health goals.
Proceed through all the low-carb products with caution. Just because that
sweet temptation says low-carb doesn’t make it particularly user friendly
to your body and your low-carb lifestyle. All low-carb products aren’t
created equal. Don’t just look at the front of the packing that says, “Only
2 Net Carbs” — read the label and see what’s inside that wrapper. Yep, the
product may contain only 2 net grams of carbs with 375 calories — yikes!
Combine all those calories with sugar alcohols, and you may be setting your-
self up for a long-term sticking of your scales. Junk food in any form is still
junk food even if it says low-carb. This is not user friendly to your low-carb
lifestyle at all. And even if it’s relatively healthy, just because it says “low-
carb” doesn’t mean that you can eat the whole thing.
Sometimes people are so diligent, or seemingly so, about their carb counts
they just can’t figure out why they aren’t losing weight and/or why their
energy levels are so low. When you find yourself in this situation, I urge you
to look closely at what you’re putting in your mouth that’s labeled low-carb. If
your weight loss is stalling, try writing down everything that you eat every
day plus the carb counts (see more about patrolling your carbs with food jour-
naling in Chapter 1). Food manufacturers can put “Less than 1 gram” of car-
bohydrate on the Nutrition Facts panel, if the food contains 0.5 to 0.9 grams.
You may be amazed at how these less than’s add up. Fresh and natural foods
are the best for any healthy lifestyle, and low-carb is no exception.
Many of the low-carb products contain sugar alcohols, which some folks tol-
erate well and others don’t tolerate at all (see Chapter 2 for information on
sugar alcohols).
51
Chapter 3: Organizing and Shopping for the Low-Carb Kitchen

Some of the oldest and largest food companies are coming out with some
awesome low-carb foods, and the prices are becoming much more reason-
able (especially with the big name brands). But shop wisely for low-carb
products because sometimes they’re just not necessary and don’t taste as
good as the real thing does.
Reading the Nutrition Facts Panel
Food labels aren’t optional reading. They’re required reading within a healthy
low-carb lifestyle. If you can’t read the labels in the grocery store without your
glasses, then don’t leave home without them! The more you practice reading
food labels, the more information you discover — some of which the food
manufacturer may hope you don’t notice or take the time to read. Basically,
there are two label components you need to consider — the Nutrition Facts
panel and the ingredient list.
Crunching the numbers
Look for the Nutrition Facts panel on the side or on the back of most food
packaging (you can see an example of a Nutrition Facts panel in Figure 3-1).
Required information on all Nutrition Facts panel includes: total calories,
calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohy-
drates, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, and essential vitamins. Trans fats are
also set to make their required appearance soon.
Figure 3-1:
Investigate
these
numbers
closely.
52
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

Here are the basics on the Nutrition Facts panel jargon:
 Serving size: This is important because the serving size the manufac-
turer has defined may not reflect what you consider to be a standard
serving. You may assume that a serving of your favorite food is about
1⁄4 cup when it’s really only 1 tablespoon. The information presented on
the Nutrition Facts panel is for a single serving (check out the “Amount
Per Serving” tagline in Figure 3-1). So, if this serving size doesn’t fit with
the amount of food you’re about to eat, do the math.
For example, if you’re going to eat 1 cup of a given food and the serving
size is a 1⁄2 cup, you have to multiply the amount of carbs (and calories and
fat and everything else) listed in the Nutrition Facts for that 1⁄2 cup serving
by 2 to determine the number of carbs you’re actually going to eat.
 Servings per container: Get into the habit of checking out this line when
you check out the serving-size line. You may assume that tiny box or bag
naturally contains one serving, but it may contain many more, meaning
you once again have to do the math if you plan on eating the whole thing.
Or better yet, don’t eat the whole thing!
 Calories: Calories equal energy, so the calories listed on the Nutrition
Facts panel indicate the amount of energy provided to the body for each
serving of a given food. Don’t forget: This calorie/energy thing is a two-
way street. Energy coming in needs to be accounted for by energy going
out. You have to burn the amount of calories you take in to maintain
your desired weight.
 Calories from fat: This is the total amount of calories that are from fat.
 Percentage of recommended daily value column: The U.S. Department
of Agriculture has determined the amounts (in grams) of the nutrients
listed on the Nutrition Facts panel (fat, carbohydrate, fiber, and protein)
that make up what it considers to be a well-balanced diet. The percent-
ages listed here are the percent of each nutrient that a serving of the
food contains, based on a 2,000-calories-a-day diet. A quick reference is
a daily-value percentage of 5 percent is considered low, and 20 percent
or more is considered high.
 Total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol: These numbers are the amounts,
in grams, and percentages of the total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol
per serving. (See Chapter 2 for more on distinguishing between healthy
and unhealthy fats.)
 Sodium: Watch for high sodium counts. Small amounts of sodium are
necessary for proper body function. Too much sodium can increase
water retention and high blood pressure in some people. Especially
watch the sodium content on processed foods.
 Total carbohydrate: This one is important to your low-carb lifestyle,
because it shows the total grams of carbs in each serving. The total car-
bohydrates listed in grams equal the total grams of starches, fiber, and
53
Chapter 3: Organizing and Shopping for the Low-Carb Kitchen

sugars that a serving of the product contains. You probably already know
that this count isn’t the final number you work with when calculating
your carb counts. You can subtract the fiber count from the total carbo-
hydrate count to determine the number of net carbs. (See Chapter 2 for
more on carb calculations.)
 Dietary fiber: Fiber is a very important nutrient and one that most
people don’t get nearly enough of. Dietary fiber, itself, has no calories
and is also listed as part of the total carbohydrate. See the preceding
bullet for the formula that uses dietary fiber grams and total carbohy-
drate grams to determine the net carb count.
 Sugars: No daily value percentages are assigned to sugar, because there
are no recommended daily amounts of sugar you should eat each day.
The grams of sugar listed here include both naturally occurring sugars
and added sugars.
There’s a lot of controversy over the fact that current labeling rules
don’t require manufacturers to list added sugars separately, which
makes deciphering how much added sugars are in a food or beverage
sometimes not only challenging but very complicated. (Check out the
“Searching for sugars” section, later in the chapter, for tips on finding
these rascals in the ingredients list.)
 Protein: Some Nutrition Facts panels have a recommended daily value
percentage for protein, and some don’t. The percentage of daily value is
only required if a claim is made for protein in the product.
 Vitamins and minerals: The percentage of the recommended daily
amount of certain vitamins that you get from a serving of the food is also
listed. A healthy goal is to reach the 100-percent mark for each vitamin
and mineral every day. For example, if an orange juice label says that
one serving has 80 percent of your vitamin C needs for the day, then you
only need an additional 20 percent from other sources to fulfill your vita-
min C quota.
Keep this in mind: The Nutrition Facts panel is undergoing a major overhaul
and will be changing. Also, folks who are trying to lose weight or maintain
weight don’t normally consume 2,000 calories per day.
The Nutrition Facts panel includes the amount of sugar alcohols (polyols) per
serving within its total carbohydrates calculations. As I write this book, it’s
optional to list the grams of sugar alcohols used on a separate line, unless a
manufacturer uses the terms “no sugar added” or “sugar free” on the packag-
ing. Then the manufacturer is required to list the grams of sugar alcohols
used. If the product uses only one sugar alcohol, that sugar alcohol will be
named in the Nutrition Facts panel; if more than one is used, the general term
sugar alcohols is used. To clear up any confusion, you can always check the
ingredient list, which always contains the names of each sugar alcohol that a
product contains.

Searching for sugars
Nutrition labeling also includes ingredient lists. Here’s where you put on your
trench coat and become a hidden sugar detective when you’re reading labels.
I think you’re going to be very surprised to discover how many sugars masked
by different names are in so many food products. In the ingredient list, ingredi-
ents are listed by weight in a descending order from most to least. So the first
ingredient listed is the most abundant in the food, and the last is the least
abundant.
When manufacturers list sugar in the ingredient list, they’re referring to sucrose
only. The following are other names for “sugar” — hidden sugars — that manu-
facturers list so there doesn’t appear to be much added sugar at all. Taken indi-
vidually, there may not be. But add them up, and the amounts can be quite
amazing. The real names for these sneaky little sugars include:
 Beet sugar
 Brown sugar
 Corn sweetener
 Corn syrup
 Dextrose
 Fruit juice concentrate
 Galactose
 Glucose
 High-fructose corn syrup
 Honey
 Invert sugar
 Lactose
 Malt
 Maltodextrin
 Maltose
 Malt syrup
 Maple syrup
 Molasses
 Polydextrose
 Raw sugar
 Sucrose
 Turbinado sugar

any people seem to have an all-or-nothing attitude about losing weight.
They think they either need to lose weight quickly, getting to that thin
goal they have in their head, or it’s all over. But if you want to live a healthy
lifestyle, you need to be concerned about more than just reaching your ideal
weight by going on a diet for a 30-day sprint. If you want to keep that weight
off and be healthy for the rest of your life, you need to develop a lifestyle that
incorporates nutritious cooking and eating plans you can easily follow for the
rest of your life. You don’t have to sacrifice culinary pleasures in order to
adhere to sound nutritional principles in your healthy, low-carb lifestyle.
When you take a low-carb approach to dietary planning, you can still eat
great food, you should never go hungry, and you can even have dessert. (See
Chapter 13 for some great low-carb dessert recipes.) In this chapter, I help
you see that to be successful adopting and maintaining a low-carb lifestyle
requires an attitude adjustment. Your attitude toward food affects your body,
your mind, and your spirit. I discuss how cooking at home can help you con-
trol your carbs. And I offer some advice on how to deal with those slips and
misses that are a natural part of trying to change your entire lifestyle.
Making Your Low-Carb Lifestyle Work
Switching from your old habits and adopting a healthy and active low-carb
lifestyle is a challenge. It involves making some changes in your life. But don’t
try to make all these changes overnight, or you’ll set yourself up for failure. I
want you to win this one because, although the stakes are high, so are the
rewards.

The key to making your low-carb lifestyle work is flexibility. Establish which
low-carb lifestyle road you’re going down and set your goals. If you aren’t
reaching your goals in a reasonable amount of time, be prepared to change
horses in midstream and evaluate what’s going on with your body and make
some tweaks in your approach. Living a healthy low-carb lifestyle is about you,
and it begins with a choice of which low-carb lifestyle works for you. No one
can make this decision for you — it’s your choice. After making the choice, you
must make a commitment — to yourself — to stick to that lifestyle.
Believing in your low-carb lifestyle
You’re a believer in the benefits of a healthy lifestyle or you probably wouldn’t
be reading this book. If you don’t believe in something, you sure can’t imple-
ment it. If it’s distasteful to you and not adaptable to your lifestyle, you’re just
setting yourself up for big-time failure. Don’t be afraid to combine low-carb
lifestyle plans, getting rid of what doesn’t work for your body and adding what
really works. All the while, keep balanced nutrition in the forefront to keep
you going for the long haul. Life can be so fine — take charge of yours now!
Making a commitment
If achieving your weight goal and good health with your low-carb lifestyle is
important to you, then it’s worth working hard for. First and foremost, that
means making a commitment. This doesn’t mean that you won’t ever slip and
fall again — you’re human, remember? (Check out the section “Fighting Back
When You Backslide,” later in this chapter, for help in maintaining a healthy
perspective when you slip up.)
Commitment means that you set realistic long-term and short-term goals for
your low-carb lifestyle and do everything in your power to work toward them
everyday, one step at a time. Commitment means that when setbacks occur,
you’ll keep bouncing back because you’re not quitting. The commitment that
you make to yourself to lead a healthy lifestyle isn’t about a temporary fix;
it’s about quality of life, health, elimination of chronic disease in your body,
wellness, and longevity — it’s about your life. Don’t take your commitment
lightly and you’ll be thrilled with your results.
Doing it for yourself
Learning to love yourself is sometimes a difficult assignment. Step up to the
challenge by looking yourself in the mirror and saying “I love you” and mean-
ing it. Loving yourself is the best reason in the world to pursue a low-carb
58
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

lifestyle, which for you may mean the desire to look and feel better. Pursuing
a low-carb lifestyle works only when you’re doing it for yourself.
Don’t wait to enjoy the things that you want to do “until you lose weight” —
begin now by making a list of all of your “wanna do’s” and put yourself on a
reward plan. Set your expectations at realistic levels so that when you exceed
them you’re pleasantly surprised and you feel good about yourself. Reward
yourself with one of the things that’s on your “wanna do” list — do it now!
Seeking out support
Find a friend or coworker who is a low-carb lifestyle advocate and team up.
Two heads are often better than one when you have the same goal, and you
can support each other in your quest for success in low-carb living for life.
You can also celebrate improved health and wellness together by supporting
each other through the process.
There are lots of great low-carb forums online that are very supportive. If
you’re a computer buff, jump online and give a couple a try. The online sup-
port groups are like anything else in life: You may have to try several before
you find one that fits you. I know some moderators of several different groups,
and you’ll find the same people chatting about their low-carb lifestyle almost
every day. Lots of these people have lost tons of weight and are very warm
and willing to help newbies. (Surf some of the Web sites listed in Chapter 23
and find some forums online.)
You can sometimes be your own best support person. Leaving yourself
little notes on your computer, the bathroom mirror, and the fridge can help
encourage you to stick to your low-carb lifestyle. Post notes that affirm your
lifestyle, act like a stop sign (for example, “stop and have a drink of water
first”), and give you pats on the back for staying on track. You often need to
give yourself the kudos that you so deserve because others may not realize
your success. So go out and buy some cute new sticky notes and post them
all around the house.
Fine-tuning your food-weakness radar
No one is shoving unhealthy foods into your mouth. Taking responsibility
for what you eat is crucial to your success in living a low-carb lifestyle. Don’t
blame the restaurant, the hostess of the party, or your great-aunt Esther for
your overeating or choosing foods that don’t fit your low-carb lifestyle. Guess
who’s in charge here?
59
Chapter 4: Adopting a Healthy, Carb-Conscious Lifestyle with Ease

No one knows better than you the foods that you just can’t resist. Fine-tuning
your food radar and admitting your weaknesses to yourself catapults you
ahead of the game. Awareness is about 95 percent of the battle. Admitting to
yourself that certain foods are so tempting that they make your knees weak is
the first step to conquering these little devils when you see them face to face.
Being aware and making plans in advance to deal with these situations before
they occur can give you more control when they arise.
Situations like these seem to rear their head a lot around the holidays, which
can be a tough time of the year — if you let it be tough. Holidays are meant
to be joyful and a time to get together with friends and family, and for eons,
these celebrations have centered on food! Go to the parties and dinners. Just
plan ahead with these tips that you can apply to any party or dinner:
 Take one of your favorite low-carb snack dishes, entrees, sides, or big
salads — whatever is appropriate for the occasion.
 Eat a small meal before you go to the gala if you’re really concerned
about a test to your will power.
 Drink some water in the car on the way so you don’t arrive on an empty
stomach.
 Tuck some nuts in your pocket or purse in case there’s just not enough
variety on the table for you.
The upside of the holidays these days is that so many folks are watching their
carbs, and new, exciting low-carb dishes are often being prepared for parties.
I guarantee you won’t be the only one with a low-carb lifestyle at the party.
If you really need a sobering moment to step away from that platter of cook-
ies, step into the bathroom and take a look at the pretty dress or that great
pair of pants and how well they fit you. Think about how hard you’ve worked
to look that nice for the holidays or your big event. Want to slide down that
big hill and have to climb it all over again? I didn’t think so. (For related tips
on planning ahead when you go out to eat, see Chapter 18.)
Learning to say, “No, thank you”
When you’re offered certain foods at special gatherings, such as in a friend’s
home or at holiday parties, you may often hear a little voice that says, “Oh, I
can’t say no because I might hurt the hostess’s feelings.” When this happens
to you, ask yourself very quickly, “Is this about their feelings or my health?”
This isn’t a trick question, and you know the answer. You don’t need to offer
a long-winded explanation about your low-carb lifestyle. You just need to
simply and politely say, “No, thank you.”

Taking Small Steps toward Success
Although the big picture has merit, you’re probably better off to set small,
attainable, specific goals. This approach won’t be nearly as overwhelming for
you, and you’ll feel accomplishment along the way, spurring you on to your
next goal. Don’t forget to reward yourself each time you reach a goal. Oh, by
the way, food rewards aren’t an option.
If you have 90 pounds to lose, you may find that goal overwhelming. Or if
you’ve lost and gained back that same 35 pounds for over 15 years because
of yo-yo dieting, that can be disconcerting and downright depressing. Don’t
let your lifestyle or food decisions overwhelm you — remember that you’re
in charge! Making small changes is the key to finally hanging up your diet hat
and trading it in for a successful low-carb, healthy lifestyle for life! When you
begin stacking all of these small steps up, they become your stairway to a
success story of wellness. How cool is that? Here are a few small steps to
start you on the road to a low-carb lifestyle:
 Eat. Starving yourself isn’t part of a low-carb lifestyle. Eating too little
slows down your metabolism, which ends up working against your weight-
loss goals. Unless those metabolic fires are burning, you aren’t burning
any calories. Become an amazing grazer (see Chapter 2 for more informa-
tion on amazing grazing with your low-carb lifestyle).
 Try one or two new foods a week. There’s just no excuse for boredom
when you’re following your low-carb lifestyle. There’s so many great
foods out there and the list of “can have’s” is so much longer than the
list of “can’t have’s.” Your low-carb glass isn’t half empty — or half full.
It’s brimming over with options!
 Take your lunch to work. If you’ve planned ahead and have your lunch,
you won’t be tempted to grab something unhealthy and full of carbs
from the vending machine or snack bar. Toting your lunch gives you all
kinds of flexibility and control in your healthy lifestyle. It’s a good thing!
See Chapter 19 for some ideas for lunches to go.
 Never skip breakfast. Always eat something before you leave home in
the morning. See more on the importance of breakfast in Chapter 6.
 Become food-label savvy. Check portion sizes because they may not
measure up to your appetite. See more on label reading in Chapter 3.
 Be assertive. Let others know what you want on your plate, whether
you’re in a restaurant or at your mother-in-law’s house.
 Take your measurements. Body measurements are sometimes more accu-
rate than the scale and much more motivating because you often drop
inches before pounds. You’re more likely to stay motivated this way.
61
Chapter 4: Adopting a Healthy, Carb-Conscious Lifestyle with Ease

 Treat yourself. Reward yourself for accomplishments with a movie,
some new jeans (in a smaller size), a new shirt, or a new book on tape.
 Eat fresh, raw vegetables for snacks at work and at home. The texture
and the crunchiness of raw veggies seem to satisfy cravings. I wonder
how many pounds of baby carrots that I’ve eaten while sitting at the
computer writing this book?
 Plan your meals in advance. Doing so will take you far down your road
to success with your low-carb lifestyle (see more on meal planning in
Chapter 20).
 Drink more water. Try to get in the habit of reaching for a bottle of water
instead of a diet soda. You’ll be amazed how much weight falls off if you
do this. (See Chapter 5 for more about staying hydrated.)
 Learn to cook with herbs and spices. They add flavor when you cut
back on fat and eat lean, plus the calorie and carb counts are low. An
additional perk in herbs and spices is cutting out the boredom of the
same old thing day in and day out.
Read at least one nutrition article a week! Fill up as much as you can on good
nutritional data. You’ll find it quite fascinating, and like feeding your body,
you’ll be feeding your nutritional soul. Most sound nutritional data that you
digest will steer you not toward another fad diet but toward a life of good-
tasting, satisfying, happy eating. When you go on a diet, it is assumed that
you’ll some day go off that diet. But if you know more about nutrition and
how to prepare tasty, healthy, low-carb meals, you never have to go off that
type of eating — that’s your lifestyle for the rest of your life.
Cooking at Home to Control Carbs
The more satisfied you become with your low-carb lifestyle, the choosier
you’re going to get about what goes in your mouth — and rightly so. There’s
one surefire way to be absolutely certain what you’re ingesting: Prepare it
yourself at home (or have someone cook for you and you clean up). When
you’re at the helm in the kitchen, you don’t have to guess whether ingredients
are fresh and whether hidden sugars and carbs are lurking in your meals.
Healthy home-cooked meals don’t have to take hours to prepare. Heck, some-
times they can be whipped up in less than 30 minutes. See Chapter 20 for
some great recipes to prepare in a hurry.
62
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

Using the recipes in this book
Being the simple cook that I am, the level of difficulty of the recipes in this
book is minimal. If you spot a recipe with a longer list of ingredients, don’t let
that intimidate you. It doesn’t mean that the recipe is difficult, it just means
there’s more stuff in it. My goal in selecting recipes for this book was to bring
you the tastiest and most nutritious dishes with the lowest number of carbs
possible.
Some of the ingredients that I use in my everyday low-carb cooking may be
“different” to you, so I want to run through them here with you. These ingre-
dients are pretty basic — I don’t use a lot of specialty products that are
expensive or require a treasure hunt to locate. About the only “low-carb”
products that I use in my everyday lifestyle are low-carb whole-wheat tor-
tillas, and they’re a staple in my kitchen. (And I confess that I have a stash of
low-carb cookies that I treat myself to every so often with a cup of tea.) Most
large grocery stores have all of the products that you need for the recipes in
this book. I also do some of my shopping in a health-food store, and if you
have one of those whole foods stores near you, you’re one of the lucky ones.
The following list highlights some of ingredients I use in this book that you
may find a tad unfamiliar or wonder about:
 Dairy products: The recipes in this book make use of half-and-half and
whipping cream. Just be aware that you can’t use a ton of this stuff and
lose weight! I also opt for regular cottage cheese and sour cream. Yes, I
know that this is a major point of controversy in the low-carb world, so
if you prefer reduced-fat and low-fat varieties, it’s your grocery list! My
favorite yogurt is Greek yogurt — it’s really creamy and low in carbs, too.
I don’t care for the low-carb varieties myself, and I don’t call for them in
the recipes, but again it’s a personal preference. I prefer plain yogurt both
in my cooking and snacking. And please use real butter — margarine con-
tains those fats that you don’t want, like trans fats. Besides, butter lends
such great flavor to any dish that you’re preparing.
 Flours: The recipes in this book call for several different flours. I use the
specific type of flour for each recipe that ensures success while balanc-
ing overall carb considerations. So, if you substitute a different type of
flour, the results may vary. I keep whole-wheat pastry flour, white whole-
wheat flour, and stone-ground flour in my pantry at all times. Whole-
wheat pastry flour is like cooking with silk, but because it’s so soft and
fragile, you usually have to combine it with another of the flours I men-
tioned for some bulk.
 Fresh ingredients: More often than not, I choose fresh ingredients for
these recipes. Fresh veggies galore, a variety of greens, fresh mushrooms,
lots of baby carrots for snacking, and fresh fruits as well as fresh meats,
poultry, fish, and eggs.
63
Chapter 4: Adopting a Healthy, Carb-Conscious Lifestyle with Ease

 Sugar alcohols: I don’t cook with sugar alcohols, and I haven’t included
them as ingredients in this book, but if you’re accustomed to doing so,
please feel free to make substitutions in any of the recipes. After all, this
book is all about what works for you.
 Wines: There are several recipes in this book that call for white and red
wines, and I usually specify a dry wine. I use cheap (not just reasonably
priced — cheap) wines for my cooking. But watch out for the fruity
wines and flavored wines because they usually contain a ton of sugar.
Merlot is both low in sugar counts and calorie counts, and if you want
to sip just a tad while you’re cooking, I’d suggest a nice Merlot!
My sugar substitute/artificial sweetener of choice is sucrolose, which goes
by the brand name Splenda. I like it because of the taste, the texture, and the
fact that it stands up to high heat. In the recipes in this book, there are two
different types of Splenda:
 Splenda: Splenda comes in both packet and granular form. In recipe ingre-
dient lists, I refer to this product as Splenda sugar substitute. Splenda in
the packet is a concentrated sweetener, and one packet equals 2 tea-
spoons of sugar. Splenda in the granular form measures cup-for-cup like
sugar because a bulking agent, maltodextrin, has been added. Although
the granular form measures cup-for-cup with sugar, it’s not the option I
choose when baking — that’s the job for Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking.
Splenda doesn’t contain any calories, but it’s not carb-free. (There are
calories, however, in the Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking because of the
real sugar content.) The carb count on the Nutrition Facts panel states
“Less than one gram” per teaspoon of the granular stuff and, of course,
that’s accurate. The granular Splenda contains about half a gram of
carbs per teaspoon because of the bulking agent used. If you’re using a
cup of the stuff, you have to get your calculator out and add up all of
those little less than’s! A cup of granular Splenda contains about 24
grams of carbs. Splenda packets have less bulking agent, so you can
save a few carbs if you use the packets. (For more details, check out
www.splenda.com.)
 Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking: Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking is used
in some of the dessert recipes in this book and others. This Blend for
Baking does contain sugar, but a half-cup of it replaces a full cup of
sugar. This product makes your low-carb baking just like old-fashioned
baking. It doesn’t get much low-carb better. See Chapter 13 for more on
the carb and calorie counts of this product. 
The vast majority of the recipes in this book contain less than 5 or 10 net
grams of carbs per serving. Just flip through the chapters and look at all those
Less-Than-5 and Less-Than-10 icons that accompany the recipes. (As I remind
you in the Introduction, those icons refer to the net grams of carbohydrates
per serving.) Overall, I’ve tried to offer you fabulous foods with minimal carbs.
But I sometimes offer suggestions and even recipes that seem a little higher in
64
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

carbs than others, so be sure to look at the big nutritional picture. The trade
off for higher carb counts in some of my suggestions and recipes is an overall
healthy, balanced lifestyle — except for some of the desserts that are just a
plain ol’ treat (treats lower in carbs than their carb-laden cousins, that is)
because you deserve it once in a while. It is my sincere hope that you enjoy
these low-carb recipes from this very old-fashioned cook. Bon appetite!
Planning easy low-carb meals
The secret to becoming a great low-carb cook is planning. Plan your meals and
write them down. How far in advance you plan depends on what you’re com-
fortable with. I suggest in Chapter 20 that you shop two times a week and have
specific meals planned for a week at a time. This makes managing carbs easier
and in the end saves you a lot of time. Planning meals a week in advance may
take a little getting used to, but there are all kinds of advantages:
 You can look forward to your favorite foods.
 You can experiment with new recipes when you have time.
 You don’t waste time after work trying to figure out what’s for dinner,
become frustrated, and wind up at the closest high-carb drive-thru.
 Planning easy, quick, and healthy low-carb meals gives you an overall
sense of satisfaction and well-being. If it’s your decision to actively
pursue a low-carb lifestyle, you’ll be delighted how planning meals with
your carb intake in mind begins to show in your body weight, your over-
all health, and your attitude toward life.
 When you have leftovers, you can tote them for lunch the next day being
confident that your lunch is low-carb. You can even get in the habit of
cooking a little extra so you have lunch for a couple of days.
 Quick, easy, and planned meals give you more time for other things.
When you can get in and out of the kitchen quickly because you’re pre-
pared and serve a great, healthy meal to boot, you have time to relax or
work on a project that you’ve been trying to get to.
Planning means having ingredients on hand so that you make the most of
your time spent in the kitchen. (See Chapter 3 for advice on stocking your
low-carb kitchen.) Throughout this book, I provide you with tons of quick
low-carb recipes. In fact, I devote a whole chapter to cooking low-carb
quickly (see Chapter 20). But remember, some dishes are generally quicker
than others to whip up:
 Fresh fish cooks very quickly, and it’s full of nutrients and easy on the
carb counts. Look at the timesaving recipes for fish in Chapter 9.
 Another way to literally have meals ready when you walk through the
door is to invest in a slow cooker if you don’t already have one (see
Chapter 16 for low-carb slow cooker recipes).
65
Chapter 4: Adopting a Healthy, Carb-Conscious Lifestyle with Ease

 Wrap it up! You can throw whatever is in the fridge into a tad of olive oil
and call it a stir-fry. Wrap it in a low-carb tortilla and you’ve got dinner.
Or, scramble some eggs in the microwave, fold them in a low-carb tor-
tilla, and you’ve got breakfast on the run. Wraps are quick and easy and
offer so much versatility. (Take a walk over to Chapter 15 for some great
wrap recipes.)
 Think salads. The greens are already combined, washed, and ready to go
in a package in the produce department. Embellishments can make a
salad a meal that’s quick, easy, and low in carbs (see Chapter 8 for some
great salad recipes).
Dishing up tasty low-carb portions
Something that some low-carb diet plans sometimes totally skim over is por-
tion size (yes, I did use the “d” word). Size really does matter, especially in
controlling your portions and your carb counts. Be mindful of your portions:
 You can’t expect to eat platefuls of high-fat meats, foods dripping in fatty
oils, tons of calories, or lots of highly processed foods and maintain
your weight, your lifestyle, and your health.
 The amount of food you eat is closely related to blood sugar control.
Don’t let yourself get ravenously hungry. Always carry a snack of nuts or
some other form of protein with you. And strive to become an “amazing
grazer” to keep your blood sugar levels on an even keel.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Americans are eating about
150 to 200 calories more a day than they were 18 years ago, thanks to the
super-sized portions that are available everywhere. Guess what that packs
on in your body weight — 15 extra pounds a year.
Weight control goes hand in hand not only with carb control but also with por-
tion control. See more about easily determining portion sizes in Chapter 21.
A good hostess always leaves her dining guests just a tad hungry and wanting
more. Try to apply this guideline to your everyday eating habits. Research
proves that it takes 20 minutes for your stomach to signal the brain that
you’re full. So make it a habit to stop eating before you feel stuffed. And if
you’re behind the stove, don’t take it personally if your family or guests don’t
finish your fine meal.
66
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

Fighting Back When You Backslide
Sometimes no matter what you do, the scale stays the same. Don’t let that
make you crazy. Lighten up on yourself. Give yourself time to adjust to new
situations on a mental, emotional, and spiritual level. Your body needs time
to adjust to your healthy lifestyle and weight loss. Be patient.
You may have days when you get up and weigh three more pounds than you
did yesterday. Or maybe you crave sugar-free stuff, and before you know it,
you’ve eaten six sugar-free chocolate chip cookies and you’re still starving.
Well, guess what — eating this food can send you into a plateau or a stall, and
all of a sudden you think your scale is stuck. Well, it’s more than likely not
your scale — it’s the foods you’ve been eating!
Climb back on that horse that just threw you with more conviction than ever.
Go walk an extra 2,000 steps today with your pedometer, and you’ll feel better, I
guarantee it. (See Chapter 5 for more on pedometer walking.) The extra move-
ment will get your metabolic furnace burning more, and you’ll get beyond your

Chapter 4: Adopting a Healthy, Carb-Conscious Lifestyle with Ease
Setting your low-carb table for success
The little things in life are often what make it
worthwhile. The same is true in a healthy low-
carb lifestyle. Everyone is going in 500 direc-
tions at once these days, and you’re lucky to just
get a hot and healthy meal on the table after a
day at work. But, as a former bed and breakfast
innkeeper, I can tell you that presentation
adds so much to your table. Treat yourself to a
couple of no-iron tablecloths and some cloth
napkins — you can even find easy-care terry-
cloth ones. It’ll take you only about five extra
minutes (no more, I promise) to set the table.
I’m not trying to be your interior designer, but
the color of your tablecloths matters. Bright
colors like red, orange, and yellow actually stim-
ulate your appetite. That’s why you see so much
red in restaurants! Darker color tablecloths in
the gray, brown, and black family, on the other
hand, won’t make you any hungrier than you
already are. If you’re really out to impress, grab
that big candle from the hallway or the coffee
table, put it in the middle of the table, and fire it
up. Ah — low-carb ambience at its best. If
anyone says, “Hey, what are we celebrating?”
you, as the star of the low-carb lifestyle, can
answer, “We’re celebrating life — yep, life and
wellness.”
Your china may be lovely, but if you put out
fewer plates and bowls, you won’t be tempted
to fill them up and to overindulge. Keep it simple.
The same advice goes for setting out a lot of
entrée dishes and side dishes. Get in the habit of
having your table as only a place to eat. Fill your
plates in the kitchen and sit down at the table to
eat. If people want seconds, they’ll have to
make a trip to the kitchen!

stall more quickly and give your self-esteem a needed boost. Just don’t give up.
Remember, it’s all about you. When you get this, you get it all.
You didn’t gain all of this body fat and weight overnight, so don’t get frus-
trated and agitated and give up. Hang in there because you are on the right
road to wellness and longevity.
If and when you backslide a bit on the road to good health, take the direct
and positive approach. Negative talk about what you could have or should
have done will only make you feel badly about yourself and possibly make
you just throw up your hands and eat foods that you’ll really regret. Don’t
immediately recall only everything that you’re doing wrong. Instead, look at
everything that you’ve done right. You’ve done a lot of hard work and plan-
ning, and you don’t want to ruin all you’ve accomplished. Remember that you
can easily gain that 5 pounds back in just one weekend if you continue to
beat yourself up and fail to get back on track. 
Accept the fact that you’re an oh-so-human being and you’re just exactly
where you are right now. Take back control of your healthy low-carb lifestyle
and move forward. There ain’t no going back now! Examine what you think
happened to get you off track and what is going on in your life right now.
Maybe some extra steps with your pedometer will help to rev up your metab-
olism and eliminate some of the stress you may be feeling. Sit down and plan
your meals for the next few days to make sure they include your low-carb
favorites. Most of all, be kind to yourself. Focus on your successes — not
your failures!

Completing the Wellness-for-Life
Puzzle: Putting Your
Body in Motion
In This Chapter
 Moving your body more
 Experiencing the wondrous ways of walking
 Trading in your diet yo-yo for a pedometer
You can diet and lose weight — it’s a no-brainer. But do you want to go
through all that deprivation and frustration just to put the weight back
on? If you’re like many folks who’ve tried to diet their way to a more slender
self, you know the routine of yo-yo dieting and yo-yo weight gain. But losing
and maintaining weight isn’t just about dieting and eating healthy foods.
You’re reading this book, so I suspect you’re either currently on one of the
controlled-carb programs out there, or you’re considering the switch to a
low-carb lifestyle. Good for you.
A healthy low-carb lifestyle is made up of more than the dietary component. I
also want you to complete the whole puzzle by adopting an active lifestyle by
adding more movement to your day. True weight management is a balancing
act of energy (calories) in versus energy (calories) out.
Don’t throw your hands up in the air. I’m not talking about spending hours
in the gym — just moving more. It isn’t as difficult as it may sound, and the
results can be life changing. Don’t wait — start today by taking it one step at
a time. Make the switch to a healthy, active, low-carb lifestyle. And make this
lane change in your dietary lifestyle your last one.
In this chapter, I psyche you up and get you moving. Although I discuss differ-
ent types of moving, I concentrate on one method in particular — walking,
which I guess you could call my passion. It isn’t earth shattering, but that’s
the point. Almost everyone can walk, and if you strap on a pedometer to
count your steps (which I tell you all about in this chapter), you can easily

keep track of your progress. And though it may seem like one simple activity
at first, I provide suggestions that put variety center stage.
Check in with your doctor before you start any diet or exercise program.
Moving More — Now
The ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu, said, “A journey of a thousand
miles begins with a single step.” Now is the time to take the first steps that’ll
help you reach your goal of moving more while keeping an eye on the big pic-
ture of health and wellness. Anytime you take the first step into something
new, you’re expanding your awareness about things around you and about
yourself. The more you become aware of yourself and of what makes you
tick, the more successful you’ll be with a low-carb, healthy, active lifestyle.
Physical movement isn’t punishment. For some reason, the thinking prevails
that if you don’t work up a sweat and exercise until your body hurts, you’re
not doing your body any good. Or that you have to immerse yourself in an
unfriendly gym atmosphere that’s filled with buff people that just seem to get
more buff. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Check out just a few of the
fun possibilities that don’t even seem like exercise:
 Line dancing or ballroom dancing
 Washing your car on a sunny day
 Tossing a ball with your kids in the back yard
 Raking leaves or sweeping the sidewalk
 Planting a garden, a flower bed, or even flower boxes on the patio
 Weeding your flower beds or vegetable garden
Unlike me, some of you don’t cringe when the word exercise pops up. Check
out some other sporty ideas that can be a fun way to get moving:
 Swimming or doing water aerobics
 Cross-country skiing
 Bowling
 Bicycling
 Playing softball, baseball, basketball, football, or soccer
 Playing table tennis
 Golfing
 Ice-skating
70
Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 

 Roller-skating
 Playing tennis, handball, or racquetball
You don’t have to block off big chunks of time to move more. You can just
start moving more one step at a time — no rushing allowed! The more you
move, the more calories you’re burning every hour.
If you have trouble making big changes, start with small ones. Think of your
lifestyle change in terms of baby steps, and don’t take the next step until
you’re comfortable with where you are in your daily exercise plan. Just ask
any turtle, and he’ll tell you that slow and steady wins the race. Your healthy
lifestyle isn’t just about dropping a few pounds or getting into that new suit
and being able to button the jacket. The positive changes that you’re making
are about your life — a better, healthier, and more fulfilling life!
Walking Your Way to Wellness
Walking is a user-friendly movement. You can set your own pace, and it’s
almost injury-free at any age. You can just walk leisurely, or you can turn it
into an aerobic movement. And you can easily increase your daily walking.
Research has proven that the movement of walking at your normal pace is
extremely vital to your overall health. In fact, studies are proving that the
simple movement of walking may be better for your overall health than vigor-
ous sports involvement or strenuous workouts. (For complete details about a
walking program, check out Fitness Walking For Dummies, by Liz Neporent,
published by Wiley.)
Walking is easy
Sure you have those minor details — like all the health benefits — that make
walking so great, but there are many other reasons why walking fits nicely
into your low-carb lifestyle:
 You already know how to do it.
 You can do it whenever you want — early in the morning, on your lunch
hour, or late at night.
 You can do it anywhere — when you’re traveling, camping in the woods,
visiting a friend, and so on.
 You don’t have to plan ahead to take a five-minute walk.
 You don’t have to make an appointment or be on time to walk.
 There’s no membership fee required for walking.
71
Chapter 5: Completing the Wellness-for-Life Puzzle: Putting Your Body in Motion

 You don’t have to be focused to walk, which allows you to empty your
brain and results in a feeling of refreshment.
 You don’t have to go out and buy special clothes to walk; you can walk
in your business suit or shorts.
 Your hair doesn’t get hair messed up when you walk (unless it’s windy).
Although you can walk in any shoes, if you’re headed out for long or brisk
walk, good, supportive walking shoes are necessary. Keep your walking shoes
in your trunk — always. If you get to a doctor’s appointment and the recep-
tionist tells you that the doctor is running about 45 minutes behind, tell her
you’ll be back in a half-hour. Put those walking shoes on, and hit the pave-
ment instead of sitting in the waiting room. Besides, everyone’s sick at the
doctor’s office, so get out into the fresh air.
It benefits your body
Teaming up your low-carb, healthy lifestyle with simply moving more is a
winner. You’re doubling your health benefits. Here are a few health benefits
of moving a little more and taking a few more steps every day:
 Curbs your appetite
 Burns almost as many calories as running or jogging
 Reduces stress
 Improves your circulation
 Improves your attitude and acts as a mood leveler
 Increases your self-motivation
 Increases your energy
 Improves your muscle tone
 Lowers your blood pressure
 Reduces your risk of heart attack and cardiovascular disease
 Can reduce bad cholesterol levels
 Can improve good cholesterol levels
 Causes you to sleep better and rest more peacefully
 Increases your alertness
 Helps you maintain and/or lose weight
Walking tall with good posture improves your walking form. Make sure you
don’t let your shoulders roll forward when you’re walking.

Stepping It Up: Pedometer Walking
Yo-yo dieting and lack of exercise (movement) are primary reasons for weight
gain. You’ve already made the decision to change your life with a low-carb
lifestyle, and now it’s time to take the next step to wellness and longevity.
Trade in your diet yo-yo for a pedometer. A pedometer is a littler device
resembling a small pager that you clip on your waistband (see Figure 5-1).
The pedometer’s basic job is to count every step you take all day long. Inside
this little guy is a lever, and your hip movements trip its trigger every time
you take a step.
Add a pedometer to your belt first thing in the morning and follow a few simple
ideas for stacking up steps. Before you know it, you’ll be walking from 7,000 to
8,000 steps a day, and you may even reach the magic number of 10,000 steps a
day. “Where did that magic number of 10,000 come from?” you ask. It all started
in Japan with an interest in pedometers that began with a Japanese movement
called 10,000 Steps a Day. The program claims that if you take 10,000 steps a
day, your health will improve, and your waist will be slimmer as a result of this
simple change.

Chapter 5: Completing the Wellness-for-Life Puzzle: Putting Your Body in Motion
Weighing in: Seeing is believing
If you want a real wake-up call about your
weight and how many extra pounds you’re car-
rying around, do this little exercise:
1. Jump on the scale, and see what your
weight is today. Write down your weight
and your realistic ideal weight.
Make sure you’re projecting a healthy
weight for your height and body frame.
(Check out the body-mass index information
I include at the end of this chapter.) To illus-
trate my point, suppose that you weigh 166
pounds, and your ideal weight is 150 pounds.
2. Subtract your desired weight from what you
weigh today, and divide the answer by 8.
Subtract 150 from 166 to get 16. Divide that
number by 8, and you end up with 2.
3. Save enough gallon water bottles to equal
the number you got when you divided your
desired weight by 8 in Step 2.
Sticking with the example, you need two 
1-gallon bottles for this eye-opening 
experiment.
4. Fill each gallon container with water. Each
container should weigh about 8 pounds.
5. Set the containers in front of you on 
the countertop and declare a moment of
silence.
This visual experience enables you to actually
see the extra weight you’re carrying around. It
can be a real inspiration to keep your low-carb
lifestyle on track. Line the water bottles up on
the back porch as a daily and sobering
reminder. When you lose a couple pounds, be
sure to pour out that much water. You’ll feel so
rewarded! And think how great you’ll feel when
they’re both empty.

The pedometer and the 10,000 steps program have been widely accepted all
over the world, and pedometer walking organizations and clubs are springing
up everywhere. The 10,000 steps program is endorsed in the fight against
obesity, because it encourages people to move more and to follow a healthy
lifestyle. The program is both simple and inspiring. The most positive thing
about the program is that it’s doable for anyone and everyone no matter how
busy they are. The 10,000 steps program is like a “move more toolkit” provid-
ing you with all the tools you need to plan and track your daily steps, all the
while forming new healthy habits and making moving more of a permanent
part of your healthy lifestyle. The President’s Council on Physical Fitness and
Sports recommends walking 30 minutes at least five days a week or 10,000
steps every day.
Don’t try to accomplish 10,000 steps all in your first day of walking. Take the
first step and then the next and don’t beat yourself up if you don’t do as well
today as you did yesterday. After all, you’re working toward a great goal — a
major change in your lifestyle. You’re a work in progress!

Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 
A short walk through the pedometer’s history
As early as the 15th century, drawings indicate
that Leonardo da Vinci was the conceptual orig-
inator of the pedometer when he designed a
gear-driving device with a pendulum arm that
moved back and forth with every swing of 
the leg during walking. Centuries later, on a visit
to France, Thomas Jefferson purchased the
hippest version of the pedometer available at
the time. In 1965, pedometers hit the commer-
cial market in Japan under the name manpo-
kei, which means “10,000 steps meter” in
Japanese. The Japanese are the leaders in
pedometer use for counting steps, and it’s said
you can find two or three pedometers in each
household in Japan.

In shopping for a good, reliable pedometer, you need to spend only about $30
or less. There are all kinds on the market that not only count steps but also
count calories. Some even talk and play music. If you search on Google (www.
google.com) for “pedometers,” you’ll have more than enough to choose from.
I suggest the simpler the better — all you need is one that counts steps.
Taking your first step with a pedometer
Don’t make pedometer walking difficult, because it’s not. You simply clip it on
at your waist every morning and hit the reset button. It counts your steps all
day. You take it off at night and record the number of steps you took that day,
and you start over the next day. Pretty easy, right?
For the first week you wear your new little friend on your waist, don’t change
anything in your daily activity. Be sure to log your steps every night when
you take your pedometer off. You may be very surprised at how little you
actually move during your waking hours. Divide your total number of steps
for the week by seven, and you have what’s called your baseline steps or your
average daily steps. Don’t be surprised if it comes in between 2,000 and 3,000
steps, or even less — well short of the ultimate 10,000 step counts. And, it’s
okay if the number is 500! Most people don’t move much, I tell you. Figure 5-2
shows a simple log you can use to record your steps.
It takes 21 days to form a habit. So if you consistently move more and wear
your pedometer 21 days in a row, you form a new habit that comes as a nat-
ural part of your lifestyle and daily routine. If you miss a day in wearing your
pedometer during the 21-day period, you have to start all over. Some people
start a new 21-day period after they’ve been successful with the first one just
to keep focused on the new, healthy habit. At the end of the 21-day block, you
have more energy, are less stressed, feel better, and look better. And if you
play your cards right, you may even weigh less.

Stepping up to higher counts
Studies everywhere show that if you wear a pedometer and set daily goals,
you become more active than people that don’t wear one. Pedometers are
quirky little critters, because they seem to have an almost magical power of
motivation about them. When you wear one, it’s like entering a contest with
yourself. You clip your pedometer on every morning, and when you glance at
it at noon, you think, “I gotta do something to get my steps in — I’m lagging
today.” After work, when you stop at the grocery store, you park your car in
the back of the lot and make a couple extra trips around the perimeter of the
grocery store with your cart just to get your steps in for the day. I’m telling
you, this little device works like a charm!
After your first week, begin to set new goals for yourself based on your base-
line number of steps. Don’t set yourself up for failure. Set realistic and achiev-
able goals, and then reward yourself for reaching them. The average person
takes about a minute to walk 100 steps. So figure out your schedule, see if
you can work in a couple five or ten minute walks several times a day, and
begin scheming how you can increase your steps. At first, set your goal to
increase your steps by 200 each day. When you get comfortable with that,
challenge yourself and up the ante. Just one little step at a time can add up to
giant steps in your active lifestyle, making you happier and healthier.
Here are some easy ways to sneak more steps into your day:
 Clean the house.
 March in place while you watch the news.

Part I: Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Counting Carbs 
Drink up
If you take long walks, especially in warmer
weather, you’re likely to get thirsty. By the time
your body tells you that you’re thirsty, you’re on
your way to being dehydrated. So keep yourself
hydrated. There’s a reason for all the hype about
drinking six to eight glasses of water per day.
Water is a noncaloric and a basic essential
nutrient for the maintenance of your life and the
proper functionality of your body. About 60 to 75
percent of your body’s weight is water — the
most abundant nutrient in your body. Muscle
tissue is about 70 percent water while in 
comparison fat contains only about 10 to 15 per-
cent water. Every cell, organ, and tissue in your
body requires water to function. Your body can
go much longer without food than it can without
water. Water helps carry valuable nutrients to
the places your body needs them, it cleanses
your body of toxins and fats, and it hydrates you.
Ensure that you stay hydrated with your low-
carb lifestyle — drink up! Visit www.water
cure.com to find out all about the cures of
good ol’ water.

 Walk around the house while you chat on the phone.
 Walk the indoor perimeter of the mall with a friend.
 Take the stairs rather than the elevator or escalator.
 Park your car at the back of the lot to lengthen your walk to the building.
 Walk around the airport while you’re waiting to board.
 Walk your dog (or a neighbor’s dog).
 Make an appointment at work with a coworker for a walking meeting.
Don’t get discouraged if you don’t have time for a 30-minute stroll. And don’t
get caught up in negative self-talk. If you can take 10 minutes out of your morn-
ing schedule and 10 minutes in the afternoon to walk, you’ve already stacked
up 20 minutes for the day! Moving for 20 minutes does more than just enable
you to burn calories during that particular walking session. You also raise your
metabolic rate and continue to burn calories after you’re done walking. You’re
building muscle mass, improving the strength in your joints, increasing your
flexibility, promoting strong bones, and enhancing the health of your heart.
Maintaining muscle during weight loss is key to helping your body burn even
more calories. (See more on moving and your metabolism in Chapter 2.)
If you like to take long walks and you’re an avid reader, enjoy the outdoors,
and catch up on your reading: Try some books on tape while you’re stepping.
You’ll want to keep walking just to find out how your book ends!

Overcoming obesity
You can help this troubled, overweight world
even if you’re not obese. Make a commitment to
help others. If you’ve lost the weight you wanted
to lose, share with other people how you got
there. No one likes to feel alone, so here are
some ideas for giving your support to others:
 Form small support groups at work, at
church, with friends, or even among your
own family members. Set up a group of carb-
conscious, pedometer-stepping buddies.
 Give a friend or relative a pedometer as a
birthday gift. Make a list of people you love
and give them a pedometer for Christmas.
What better way to show someone how
much you really care than to say, “I want
you to live longer and be healthy because I
love you.”
 Join groups online that are doing pedom-
eter walking. You can find and give support
and friendship as well as join in some inter-
esting competition online. And you don’t
have to keep a notebook log of your daily
steps, it’s simple and easy to log your steps
every day online.

Using the buddy system
Recruit one of your low-carb lifestyle friends to go pedometer walking with
you. You can socialize while you’re walking and stacking up steps on your
pedometer. Maybe there’s someone at work you’d like to get to know better.
Invite him to take a walk with you during your 10-minute morning break.
Careful, it could be habit forming.
Including others in your healthy and active low-carb lifestyle efforts helps
make you accountable. Having someone to share your achievements with
makes them even more meaningful. And having someone to share the trou-
bling times with is uplifting and encouraging, and that person often gives you
the fight you need to keep going.

Weighing in with BMI
Calculating your body mass index, known as
BMI, is another tool for you to use on the path
towards a healthy low-carb lifestyle and all-
around wellness. Expert findings report that
BMI provides a better assessment of whether
you’re overweight than you can get from simply
taking a look at your scale because it’s deter-
mined using a gender-neutral ratio that
accounts for both height and weight. How do
you determine your BMI? Just plug your num-
bers into this equation:
BMI = (W/H2) × 705
Well, a bit of translation may be in order: Take
your weight (in pounds) divided by your height
(in inches, squared) and multiply that by 705. Or
you can take the even easier approach of visit-
ing www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi for a
handy calculator in which simply plug in a few
numbers, press a button, and get your results.
After you have your BMI number, you can deter-
mine where weight falls in the grand scheme of
things:
BMI
Weight Status
Below 18.5
Underweight
18.5–24.9
Normal weight for your
height and weight
25.0–29.9
Overweight
30.0–39.9
Obese
40 and above
Morbidly obese
Depending on where your numbers fall, you
could be at a higher risk for chronic diseases
such as type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure,
cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke,
and some types of cancer.
From these calculations you can make assess-
ments as to your current state of health and
consult with your doctor about a plan to start
lowering your risk rates immediately. You’re
already on the right track pursuing your healthy
low-carb active lifestyle. However, never take
your own calculations or what you read in any
book as gospel. Check with your doctor.

reakfast — it’s one of my favorite subjects, not
to mention meals. As a former innkeeper of a
country bed-and-breakfast in Branson, Missouri, I
can tell you that when folks are on vacation and
don’t have to dash off to work, their breakfast atti-
tude certainly changes. Everyone eats breakfast
when they stay at a B&B — even folks who profess
to never eat even a bowl of cereal or granola bar
before they start their busy days. Not only do
people eat breakfast at a B&B, but they even get up
early enough to chat with the innkeeper while she
prepares the food. It’s an amazing thing, I tell you.
So now you know that I cook a really mean breakfast that brings people to the
breakfast table. In this chapter, I share some of my favorite breakfast recipes
that fit your low-carb lifestyle.
Prioritizing Breakfast in 
Your Low-Carb Lifestyle
Why eat breakfast, you ask? Think about it. The last meal you ate was the previ-
ous night’s dinner. When you rise and grab your first cup of coffee of the day,
you likely haven’t had a morsel for at least 12 hours. Believe it or not, eating
breakfast helps you lose weight or maintain your current healthy weight! Grab
something to eat at least an hour after you’ve risen for the day. You’ll find that
you’ll function more effectively, your concentration will be better, and you
won’t be as irritable and short tempered as when you skip breakfast.

Plus, if you eat breakfast, research shows that you’re more likely to enjoy a
nutritionally balanced diet overall.
Increasing your energy and metabolic rate
Overnight, your body uses energy, even while you’re sleeping. Your body
needs to replace some of the stores of energy it used during the night in the
form of food in the morning. Whatever your lifestyle, whatever your age,
wherever you live, mornings usually begin with a bang. You’re out of the gate
full blast and don’t understand why you seem to slow down and occasionally
get a headache around 10 a.m. Breakfast is the energy you need to stand up
in the morning and make it to lunch.

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
Breakfast on the run!
The next time you find yourself rushing out the
door on an empty stomach, grab a coffee mug
and forget the coffee. Throw in 2 eggs with a
pinch of salt and pepper and give them a quick
whisk. Pop them in the microwave for 1 minute.
If they’re still a little runny, give them a quick stir
and pop back in the micro for another 10 sec-
onds, grab a fork, and run.
Or, for a quick breakfast burrito, grab a couple
of low-carb, whole-wheat tortillas and pop them
into the microwave for about 8 seconds. When
the eggs are done, add 3 tablespoons of fresh
tomato salsa and 2 tablespoons of mozzarella or
cheddar cheese. Spoon the mixture into your
warm tortillas, roll them up, and you’re on your
way. Put the breakfast tortillas in plastic wrap
and pop them into the micro to warm when you
get to work. It’s breakfast on the run!
You say you want a quick omelet? Here’s a quick
omelet recipe for the microwave. Melt 1⁄2 table-
spoon of butter in a small, shallow, microwave-
proof dish on High in the microwave for about
15 seconds — you just want to coat the dish
with butter. Place two eggs in the dish and
season to taste with salt and pepper. Beat
lightly with a fork. Pop the eggs in the
microwave and cook on High for about 1 minute.
Loosen eggs with a fork — they’ll be more
cooked around the edges. Return them to
microwave on High for another 30 seconds. The
eggs will look wet and not quite done. Let stand
for 1 minute and your micro-omelet will finish
cooking. Top with whatever toppings you have
in the fridge. 
If you want to add some extra flavor to your
micro-omelet, add any of the following ingredi-
ents: cheese cubes or grated cheeses, chopped
green and red peppers, chopped fresh toma-
toes, sliced mushrooms, a bit of chopped green
onion, leftover veggies from the night before, a
dash of curry powder or some tomato salsa.
Just about anything but the kitchen sink applies
here.

Expecting your body to shift into full gear without stopping to refuel is like
assuming your car will run on empty. Even if you try to catch up by eating a
balanced lunch, you never regain the energy you would’ve had if you’d taken
ten minutes to eat some breakfast.
A big reason to make breakfast part of your low-carb lifestyle is to kick-start
your metabolic rate. Your metabolism slows down at night like everything else,
and the boost of breakfast gets your body off and running again. When you
increase your metabolism, you burn fat, and you know what that means — you
maintain your desired body weight. (Check out Chapter 2 for the full story on
increasing your metabolism.)
Avoiding cravings and increased hunger
Eating breakfast has been the mantra for many years. It’s important not only
to your overall health but significantly important to your low-carb healthy
lifestyle. Eating breakfast will help you stave off cravings and hunger pangs.
Coupled with eating healthy snacks and grazing (see Chapter 2), eating break-
fast is a priority.
Eating a healthy breakfast is one way to evenly distribute your day’s calories
and nutrients and help maintain a steady blood-sugar level and energy level.
Irregular eating habits cause a wide fluctuation in blood sugar and insulin
levels that affect your energy level and give you hunger cues. Eating four or five
small meals a day or snacking on good carb snacks is a great way to keep your
blood sugar from spiking and sending you on a hunger roller coaster ride.
 Studies have actually linked low blood sugar levels to poor memory,
concentration, and learning ability.
 Ironically, people who skip breakfast in an effort to cut carbs and calories
often do more snacking later in the day and overeat at evening meals.
 Increased hunger isn’t caused by eating breakfast but by other eating
habits. Take a look at the foods you choose for breakfast. Sugary food,
even the kind with natural sugars, such as a fruit salad or toast and jam,
triggers an insulin response and raises brain levels of serotonin, leaving
you hungry and sleepy within two hours.
Laying the foundation for your day
Under the breakfast banner of life I want to stress you. Breakfast is a very per-
sonal meal that’s all about how your body works. You don’t have time not to
eat it. Breakfast is a huge part of any healthy lifestyle, especially your low-carb
lifestyle. Experiment and figure out what works for you time-wise, palate-wise,
and preparation-wise. And remember, variety is definitely the spice.

Chapter 6: Waking Up to Breakfast

Breakfast menus vary with country, locality, and even occupation — not to
mention with your healthy low-carb lifestyle of choice. Expand your horizons
with common sense. If something is low in carbs and ultrahigh in fats and
calories, how much of it do you think is wise for you to gobble down?
Consider this rule the common sense rule. You can apply it to any food or
any meal you want — not just breakfast.
And breakfast isn’t just for breakfast any more. Try the Crab Scramble in this
chapter for dinner. Also, see Chapter 15 for great egg crepes that are very ver-
satile, low in carbs, and good for you.
Egging You On
Breakfast on the run tends to conjure up thoughts of foods that aren’t con-
siderations when you elect a healthy low-carb lifestyle. But eggs are a great
alternative: Eggs aren’t the only food on the breakfast list but because of
their versatility, you can have a bunch of breakfast options if you get a bit
creative. If you’re not in a hurry and want some meat with your eggs, select a
lean sausage. There are some incredible combinations out there these days
with sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, various cheeses, basil, and garlic — all
options that can add real spice to your breakfast. But please stay away from
the fatty stuff. If you just have to have bacon, choose lean cuts, prepare it in
the microwave, and blot it with paper towels to remove the excess fat instead
of frying it in all that grease. (For more about good fats and bad fats see
Chapter 2.)
Two eggs, please, sunny side up! That’s just the beginning of the long list of
ways to have your eggs. Eggs can be fried, poached, scrambled, and hard
cooked. They come in wonderful disguises like omelets that can be filled with
such delights as sugar-free jellies and preserves, fruit, mixed veggies, spinach,
mushrooms, herbs, and more.
And then there are soufflés, meringues, and mousses made with eggs (see
Chapter 13 for low-carb meringue treats). You can also add spices to change
the entire egg picture. Think about curry, basil, rosemary, and any other
spice — dried or fresh — that shakes or minces. Whoever thought an egg
could look or taste so good!
Eggs have been referred to as nature’s near-perfect food. A 1-ounce egg has
only 75 calories; provides all essential amino acids (see Chapter 11 for more
on amino acids), as well as lecithin and potassium; and has only 1 gram of
carbohydrates. Eggs should become your new low-carb best friend. Protein is
great in the mornings because it truly helps you curb cravings. If you have a
boring image of eggs at this very moment, replace it with a new image that’s
going to help you to eat a breakfast that’ll fill you up, not out.

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

Because eggs are almost the perfect food with some pretty impressive nutri-
tional benefits, they are good for your general health and definitely fit in with
your low-carb lifestyle. You need to take good care of this precious cargo so
you can reap the most benefit from it. Here are some tips on buying and stor-
ing eggs, a couple warnings, and a bit of serving information.
 Check the sell-by date stamped on the egg carton, and use your eggs by
this date. The size of the air pocket in the egg increases with age. The
bigger the air pocket, the less fresh the egg is.
 Do a freshness test if you’re wondering whether to use eggs on hand.
Simply put the egg in a bowl of water. Stale or bad eggs float to the top,
and fresh eggs sink with the rounded end pointed up.
 When you break an egg and the white spreads out very thin, throw it
away even if it passes the smell test, because the egg is about to go bad
or is bad.
 Store your eggs with the big round end up and the pointy end down.
 Do not use cracked eggs because they may contain harmful bacteria.
 Serve egg dishes immediately after cooking or refrigerate them.
And here are a few more egg-cellent secrets:
 The secret to cooking eggs is to be gentle and apply low heat. If eggs
cook too fast or too long, they come out rubbery.
 The secret to prepping fabulous eggs? A balloon whisk is an awesome
kitchen gadget to have for the best beaten eggs and especially for egg
whites. For perfect egg whites, use this oversized whisk with a round-
bottomed bowl and you can keep all of your egg whites in motion, simul-
taneously allowing tiny bubbles to form and the volume to build. This
tool is a must for making successful egg dishes. See an example of a bal-
loon whisk in Figure 6-1.

Awesome omelets
Basically, there are two types of omelets. The French omelet can be served
plain or folded over almost anything your little heart desires, and the puffy
omelet is started on top of the stove and finished in the oven. Both are quick
and quite easy. And now for my omelet keys to success:
 Use only fresh ingredients in your omelets.
 Make sure the eggs are at room temperature (even if you have to pop
them in a little warm water to heat them up). The temperature of the egg
before you start building the omelet has a profound effect on how your
omelet turns out, and you want it light and fluffy.
 You can have your omelet soft or well done, but you never want to cook
your omelet over high heat or it will get very tough and even burn.
 The maximum load for a successful omelet is three eggs.
 Use 1 to 2 tablespoons of water for each egg (never use milk in an omelet),
plus enough butter or oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Coating the pan
keeps the outside of the omelet soft.
 If you make omelets regularly, do yourself a favor and buy an omelet pan.
The ideal size is a 7- or 8-inch pan with curved sides. The pan should be
light enough that you can lift it with one hand and shake it as the omelet
is cooking.

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
Hard-cooked heaven
“Hard-boiled” eggs can be a great part of a low-
carb breakfast, and they make a fabulous
snack. But eggs should never be boiled but
should be hard-cooked instead. If you boil eggs
too long, they get a greenish-gray look around
the yolk. Did I hear an “Ah-ha! That’s what
causes that to happen”? Here’s how to make
hard-cooked eggs:
1. Put the eggs in a single layer in cold water.
2. As soon as they come to a rolling boil,
remove the pan from the heat, cover tightly
with the pan lid, and let the eggs sit in the
pan for 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Immediately run cold water over them to
cool, which makes them easier to peel too.
For the best hard-cooked eggs, use eggs that
are a few days old. Really fresh eggs that are
hard-cooked are more difficult to peel.
You can simplify the job of removing the shell
from a hard-cooked egg if you begin by gently
tapping it all over, rotating the egg as you tap.
Then roll the egg between your hands to loosen
the shell from the egg. Starting at the large end
of the egg, begin peeling. To make it even easier
for the peeling to slip off, hold the egg under
cold running water while peeling or put them in
a bowl of cold water.

T Plain Ol’ Simple Omelet
This recipe for a very basic omelet can be a springboard for all kinds of omelet varia-
tions (see the suggestions after the recipe). Mastering omelet making is by no means
difficult. Using an omelet pan gives you a finished product that’s much more pleasing to
the eye than just using a skillet. (See Figure 6-2 for some visual tips on how to fold an
omelet.)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 2 minutes or less
Yield: 1 serving
87
Chapter 6: Waking Up to Breakfast
2 eggs
1 tablespoon water
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
Pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter
1 Break the eggs into a small bowl. Add the water, salt, and pepper. Beat until well
blended but not foamy.
2 Using a small skillet or omelet pan, heat the pan and add butter making sure that the
butter coats the pan evenly. You want the pan very hot but not hot enough to burn the
butter. When you add the butter, it should immediately melt and begin foaming to a sizzle.
3 As the butter loses its sizzle, pour the egg mixture into the omelet pan. Holding the
handle of the pan with one hand, gently shake the pan to coat the entire pan with the
egg mixture. The eggs will begin to cook immediately when they hit the hot omelet pan.
4 When the omelet begins to set, tilt the pan away from you and lift the edges with a
coated spatula because the edges will cook more quickly. This allows the runny mixture
to flow to the bottom of the pan so it can get cooked too.
5 Place the omelet pan back on the stove, allowing it to cook until it’s firm. The center will
be just a tad moist, as the omelet continues to cook in the pan when you remove it from
the heat. Tilt the omelet pan away from you, and gently fold one-third of the omelet
over onto itself.
6 You’re now holding the omelet pan up off the heat. Holding the pan firmly, you want to
strike the handle of the pan two or three times, making the far side of the omelet flip
back on itself over the first fold. Press the sides together to seal and, lifting the side of
the omelet with your spatula, slide it off onto a plate.
7 Serve immediately.
Variation: Instead of using salt and pepper in your omelet, try Tabasco sauce. It blends
very nicely with the eggs and makes the omelet much more flavorful.

Whether you’re using my Plain Ol’ Simple Omelet recipe in this chapter or
your own, consider these low-carb, easy variations:
 Simple Farmer’s Omelet: Add 1⁄4 cup finely grated cheese to the mixture
before cooking. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of finely chopped ham, turkey, or
chicken over the omelet before folding.
 Mexican Cheese Omelet: Add 1⁄4 cup Monterey Jack or pepper Jack
cheese, and add 2 tablespoons bottled salsa (check the sugar content
on the salsa, please). Add the cheese before folding your omelet and top
with the salsa when you serve it.
 Mushroom Omelet: Add 3⁄4 cup sautéed sliced mushrooms, and 1 table-
spoon minced chives. Cook the eggs about 1 minute before adding
mushrooms and chives. After adding, cook another 11⁄2 to 2 minutes and
then fold omelet and serve.
A general rule is the addition of 1 teaspoon of water for every egg that you
plop in an omelet. Water is used because it slows down the cooking of the
eggs and makes the texture of the finished omelet much lighter and fluffier.

T Puffy Omelet Squares with 
Tomato-Zucchini Sauce
Make this easy, basic puffy omelet with tomato-zucchini sauce, or try other sauces.
Don’t limit yourself to veggie sauces; be bold and try the omelet with some easy, fresh
fruit and a dollop of whipped cream. This recipe calls for stewed tomatoes. Look for the
ones with the lowest carb and sugar counts.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 40 to 45 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
89
Chapter 6: Waking Up to Breakfast
Nonstick cooking spray
6 eggs
1⁄2 teaspoon onion powder
1⁄2 teaspoon salt 
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper, divided
14-ounce can stewed tomatoes, cut fine 
1⁄2 cup quartered (lengthwise) and sliced
zucchini
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray an 8-x-8-x-2-inch baking dish with nonstick spray
and set aside. Separate the eggs, placing the whites and yolks in separate bowls.
2 Beat the egg yolks, onion powder, salt, and 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper for about 4 minutes or
until thick and lemon-colored. Set aside.
3 Beat the egg whites until soft peaks begin to form and the tips of the peaks begin to
gently fold over. Fold the whites into the egg yolks. (Dash over to Chapter 13 for a quick
lesson on beating egg whites and the appearance of peaks.)
4 Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared dish. Bake for 23 to 25 minutes or until a
knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Oven temperatures vary, so begin
watching it after about 20 minutes.
5 While the omelet is baking, make the sauce. Combine the undrained tomatoes, zucchini,
basil, and remaining pepper. Bring to boil, and reduce heat. Cover and simmer about
5 minutes or just until the zucchini is tender. Don’t overcook.
6 Simmer, uncovered, for 10 more minutes or until the sauce reaches the desired 
consistency.
7 To serve, cut the omelet into quarters and top with sauce.

Scrambling skillets
Scrambled eggs are the easiest of all skillet dishes to prepare. A basic egg
scramble begins with 2 eggs (more if you like) salted and peppered to your
liking. Beat the eggs just until the yolks and whites are blended. Add a table-
spoon of cream. Melt some butter in a pan and tilt the pan so the bottom is
well coated. Depending on how you like your eggs done, you can finish your
eggs by choosing from the following cooking methods:
 Creamy and Smooth Eggs: Cook the eggs over low heat and constantly
stir them with a wooden spoon. Your scramble is finished when the eggs
are moist but firm with no uncooked liquid floating about. Allow about
3 minutes cooking time for 3 to 4 eggs.
 Large, Creamy Egg Curds: Cook the eggs over low heat, occasionally
pulling the cooked portions of the eggs to the center of the skillet allow-
ing the uncooked portions of the scramble to run to the edges. Repeat
this process until all of the eggs are cooked in large, moist curds.
 Dry Scramble: Cook the eggs a couple of minutes past the moist but
firm stage. The eggs will look dry and crumbly.
 Fluffy Scramble: Beat the eggs vigorously until light and fluffy. After
cooking, you can pop them in the blender for more fluff if desired. Eggs
will be semi-dry (not moist) when done.

The skinny on egg substitutes
Egg substitutes are ideal for scrambled eggs,
quiche, frittatas, omelets, casseroles, sauces,
and other recipes that call for whole eggs.
Some folks today prefer to use egg substitutes
for several reasons. You don’t have to worry
about them going bad, and because egg substi-
tutes are made up mostly of egg whites, they
contain fewer calories and less cholesterol than
fresh eggs. Egg substitutes come in refrigerated
form as well as frozen. You’ll find the refriger-
ated egg substitutes in the milk section, usually
next to the cream and milk. You can find the
exact substitute measurements on each carton
of the particular brand that you purchase. You’ll
also find just egg whites that can be used for
meringues and other recipes that call for just
whites so you don’t waste the yolks or try to
figure out something to do with them. Please be
sure to read the labels on egg whites to double-
check whether that particular brand can be
used for meringue making. (See Chapter 13 for
great meringue recipes.)

T Sunday Brunch Scramble
Sunday afternoon is a perfect time to give this recipe a whirl. The little bit of curry
powder combined with the onions and sour cream give this scramble a special twist.
Curry powder is a blend of rich, warm, earthy, and pungent flavors with varied over-
tones, always giving any dish a mysteriously warm flavor. Maybe serve this with some
low-carb bagels or low-carb English muffins and just a dab of sugar-free jam or pre-
serves. Yum! This is a quick and easy, yet filling and very low-carb, Sunday brunch.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 to 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
91
Chapter 6: Waking Up to Breakfast
6 eggs
1⁄2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons butter
1⁄3 cup finely chopped green onions
1⁄2 teaspoon curry powder
1⁄2 cup coarsely grated cheddar cheese
1 Beat the eggs and sour cream together with a mixer until they’re light and fluffy.
2 Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the green onions and cook for
about 3 minutes. Add the curry powder, and stir for just a few seconds.
3 Add the egg mixture and stir gently until the eggs are cooked to desired consistency
(see the bulleted list earlier in this section). Top with cheese and serve immediately.

Here’s a little way to test the doneness of your scrambled eggs, omelets, and
frittatas: Cook them until eggs are thickened and no visible liquid egg remains.

Crab Scramble
An almost elegant scramble, this is a great weekend brunch treat, or it can serve it as a
quick main course for supper. If you take the brunch route, a portion on each plate with
some colorful fresh fruit and a sprig of mint makes a lovely presentation. It’s downright
low-carb beautiful! (See the color section of this book for a look at this dish.)

1 Heat the butter in a nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, turn the heat
to low and add the crabmeat and chives. Cook for 2 minutes over low heat. Season with
salt and pepper to taste.
2 Stir the cheese into the beaten eggs. Pour over the crabmeat in the frying pan. Cook for

Frittata this
A frittata is like a flat egg cake. It’s a bit thick and is cooked until it’s firm but
by no means dry. To make sure that you don’t burn the bottom of the frittata,
start it over low heat on top of the stove and then finish it under the broiler,
using an ovenproof skillet. My favorite old-fashioned iron skillets are the best
for frittatas. If you’re a good flipper, you can flip the frittata instead of pop-
ping it under the broiler. Good luck — I, for one, don’t do this very well.

Ham and Cheese Frittata
Frittatas, in my humble opinion, are even easier than omelets. Both add veggies, cheese,
or meat to eggs in some manner. With an omelet, the additional ingredients are used as
a filling and the finished omelet is folded over the ingredients. When making a frittata,
you just throw in whatever ingredients you can find in the fridge. All of the ingredients
are mixed together and poured into heated oil or butter. Most frittatas include a short
trip to the broiler, so it’s a good idea to start the frittata process in an ovenproof skillet.
Preparation time: 5 to 8 minutes
Cooking time: 8 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
93
Chapter 6: Waking Up to Breakfast
3 eggs
3 egg whites
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
11⁄4 cups broccoli florets
6 ounces smoked deli ham, diced in 1⁄2-inch
cubes
1⁄3 cup red bell pepper strips
Nonstick cooking spray
1 tablespoon butter
1⁄2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 Preheat the broiler. Beat the eggs, egg whites, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well
blended. Stir in the broccoli, ham, and bell peppers.
2 Coat a 10-inch ovenproof skillet with sloping sides with nonstick cooking spray. Melt the
butter over medium heat in the skillet. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and cover.
Cook for about 6 minutes or until the eggs are set around the edges. The center will
be wet.
3 Uncover the skillet and sprinkle the egg mixture with cheese. Transfer the skillet to the
broiler and broil 5 inches from the heat source. Watch closely, because you only need to
broil for about 2 minutes, or until the eggs in the center are set and the cheese is melted.
4 Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Cut the frittata into wedges.
Variation: You can use almost any veggie in the universe in a frittata. A few more basic
ideas are red and green peppers, zucchini, cauliflower, and spinach. You can also add
Canadian bacon, sausage, or ham and any kind of cheese.

Kickin’ quiche
For a quiche to be good, you don’t need the extra carbs of the crust. Quiches
are actually very easy and quick to make, and I think you’re are going to be
quite pleased how good they are the next day for a quick breakfast or a lunch
to tote.
T Crustless Mushroom Quiche
This is a favorite quiche from my bed and breakfast in Branson and is quite like a more
traditional quiche even without a crust (I never did make it with a crust at the B&B
either). This is a great quiche to ensure plenty of leftovers for breakfast on the run or a
great lunch (add a salad). But before you get to leftovers, enjoy this great mushroom
quiche!

Crustless Quiche Lorraine
Ah my sweet Quiche Lorraine! Here’s another recipe from my ol’ inn in Branson that you
make in the microwave. This crustless quiche recipe is a favorite of a lot of quiche
lovers. Like almost all quiches, this one is good hot or cold, and it’s a great portable and
healthy low-carb snack. Cut the quiche in wedges, wrap it individually in plastic wrap,
and you have an instant breakfast to go. If you serve this as a meal, complement your
quiche with a salad of fresh greens. Feel free to experiment with this great basic quiche
recipe, adding some of your favorite veggies to the mix for variety.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

Chapter 6: Waking Up to Breakfast
10 slices bacon
11⁄2 cups shredded 3-cheese blend of
mozzarella, Monterey Jack, and cheddar
4 eggs
11⁄2 cups half-and-half
3⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
1⁄8 teaspoon nutmeg
1 Cook the bacon in the microwave by placing 2 layers of paper towels in a shallow
microwave-safe dish. Place the bacon on the paper towels. Cover the bacon with a
single layer of paper towels. Cook bacon on high for 5 to 7 minutes until crisp. Let the
bacon cool and crumble bacon into small bits.
2 Sprinkle the bacon and the cheese in the bottom of a 9-inch glass pie plate or shallow
ceramic quiche plate.
3 In a small bowl, beat together the eggs, half and half, salt, pepper, and nutmeg until well
blended.
4 Pour the blended egg mixture over the bacon and cheese.
5 Bake in the microwave on high for 9 to 11 minutes. Stop the cooking after 3 minutes,
and stir and then stop again after 6 minutes and stir, cooking until the quiche is set.
6 Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
Variation: If you want to bake this in a conventional oven, simply preheat your oven to
375 degrees and bake the quiche for 40 to 45 minutes.
Variation: This is a basic quiche recipe, so feel free to add veggies, other herbs and spices,
and a variety of cheeses. In place of the bacon, you can substitute chopped sautéed onions,
smoked salmon, diced cooked sausage, asparagus spears, or something from the sea.

Quiche takes you to the land of versatility. You can eat quiche as an entrée,
for lunch, breakfast, or a low-carb snack. Somehow it got a bad rap years ago,
and quiche was declared a rather unmanly dish. You may remember hearing
that real men don’t eat quiche. This stereotyping has since disappeared, and
introducing quiche to your low-carb lifestyle will add lots of variety to your
menus, and will give you ways to use those leftovers — simply throw them in
a quiche — all while enjoying the healthful benefits of eating eggs.
Skipping the crusts in your quiche recipes is so easy and so user friendly to
your healthy low-carb lifestyle. You’ll find that you can easily adapt most tra-
ditional quiche recipes to the crustless variety. Here’s a little insight on low-
carb crustless quiche: The finished product isn’t always quite the same
texture as a classic quiche because you don’t use some of the binding ingre-
dients, like hash browns for instance. If your low-carb quiches turn out to be
a little fluffier and more like a scramble, it’s okay. Sometimes, I’ll cook my
crustless quiches in a smaller size dish so the quiche is thicker – depending
on whether you like it thick or thin. Experiment with a couple of these quiche
recipes and it will take you about two tries to make up your mind how you
like your low-carb quiche. So quiche on and do the low-carb quiche!
When you cook in the microwave, be mindful that the ingredients keep on
cookin’ after you remove them and set them on the counter.
Brunching with Low-Carb Treats
The flexibility of your low-carb lifestyle allows you so many wonderful food
options. The days of delectable and sweet breakfast treats aren’t gone; your
options are just a little different. The recipes here are ideal if you’re having
guests over for a weekend brunch, a great excuse to get together with your
low-carb friends. Your guests may be surprised to discover that these dishes
are low-carb. And even if you’re preparing brunch for only you and your
family, these recipes are ways to treat them and eat healthy, too.

T Jan’s Nostalgic Pancakes
I’ve been flippin’ pancakes for years but not the low-carb kind. I grew up on homemade
buttermilk pancakes! But I gotta tell you that these come close in a big low-carb way.
They’re delicious and taste a little like blintzes. The trick to making these pancakes is to
stay with them while they’re cooking. They cook very quickly, and you can stack them
up fast. Serve these with sugar-free syrup, if desired, or spread on some sugar-free jam
or preserves of your choice and roll them up like a blintz. You can also sprinkle with
Splenda and top with a dollop of whipped cream. Feel free to substitute fresh or frozen
berries to get the real blintz effect. Use this recipe as a basic one that you can apply
your sugar-free dreams to. Enjoy!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 3 to 4 minutes per pancake
Yield: 6 pancakes
97
Chapter 6: Waking Up to Breakfast
3 eggs
1 cup small-curd cottage cheese
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 packet Splenda sugar substitute
3 tablespoons white whole-wheat flour
1⁄4 teaspoon baking powder
3 teaspoons butter, divided (If you’re cooking
the pancakes individually, you need about 1⁄2
teaspoon per pancake; if you’re cooking all 6
at one time on a griddle, 2 teaspoons should
be adequate)
1 Combine the eggs, cottage cheese, salt, vanilla, cinnamon, and packet of Splenda and
mix well in the blender until smooth. Combine the flour and baking powder in a small
dish and add to the blender. Blend again until all ingredients are well blended. The
batter will be very thin.
2 Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. When it’s hot, lightly grease with
butter.
3 When the butter has melted, drop about 1⁄4 cup of the batter onto the skillet or griddle. If
necessary, spread the batter out with the back of a spoon. Let the pancake cook for about
1 minute, or until small craterlike bubbles begin to form on the top of the batter. Lift the
edge of the pancake with a spatula to see if the bottom side is golden. (You may have to
let it cook another 15 seconds.) Flip the pancake and brown lightly on the other side.
4 Remove the pancake from the skillet or griddle immediately and serve.
Variation: Add 1⁄2 cup finely chopped hazelnuts (or nuts of your choice) to the batter and
make nutty pancakes that are crunchy.

actually prepared this for guests and made extra for them to take for a breakfast on the
run on a frantic Monday. Serve these toasted sandwiches with a dollop of freshly whipped
cream and a sprig of mint, as well as fresh sliced strawberries on the plate, for an awe-
some low-carb presentation. (See the color section for another presentation idea.)

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
8 slices low-carb bread of your choice
1⁄4 cup sugar-free apricot preserves
4 slices Canadian bacon
8 slices medium cheddar cheese
3 eggs
1⁄2 cup Hood’s low-carb orange juice
1 teaspoon sugar-free maple syrup
2 tablespoons butter
Splenda sugar substitute (optional)
1 Spread four slices of bread with the preserves. Top each one with a slice of Canadian
bacon and two slices of cheese. Top with the remaining slices of bread, pressing down
very gently.
2 Combine the eggs, orange juice, and maple syrup in a shallow dish. (Choose a dish that
is flat on the bottom and that the whole sandwich can lay flat in to make your dipping
very quick and easy). Dip the sandwiches in the egg mixture, turning once with a flat
spatula and allowing them to stand in the mixture for about 30 seconds per side, or
until the mixture soaks in.
3 Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet (or use your griddle) over medium heat. Cook
the sandwiches for about 3 minutes on each side, monitoring the heat carefully. The
cheese should be melted, and the bread should be golden brown.
4 Sprinkle with powdered Splenda, if desired, and serve with additional preserves.

In This Chapter
 Serving up low-carb soup
 Exploring the wide world of soup
 Cooling off with soup
A
h, soup. Close your eyes and think about
how you feel on a rainy winter night when
you come inside and ladle up a big bowl of hot
soup. As you drink in the flavors, the feeling
spreads throughout your entire body, soothing
spots that ache, warming your tummy, and vibrat-
ing your very soul. For centuries soup has been
used to lift spirits, satisfy, and comfort. I guarantee
you’re about to make a pot of old-fashioned low-
carb comfort in this chapter!
Homemade soup is too often overlooked in the low carb-lifestyle. Many soups
are very low in carb counts, low in calorie counts, healthy, nourishing, and
preservative free — not to mention just darned good. When you become an
accomplished soup maker, you’re off to good living. Well, you’re already well
on your way to good living with a low-carb lifestyle, so it’s high time you get
with the soup program, too. Did I hear you mumble something about soup
being a lot of trouble? Not so. You’re going to find that spooning homemade
soups into your low-carb lifestyle is a pleasant experience — one that’ll defi-
nitely fill you up, not out. (Grab your slow cooker and take a gander at
Chapter 16 for additional soup, chili, and stew recipes.)
Making Your Soup Kettle Sing
If you don’t have a good stockpot, I suggest you buy one. Stockpots aren’t
expensive (well, they don’t have to be), and a stockpot will serve you well in

your soup-making adventures. Stockpots are available in different sizes, and
you don’t have to buy a huge one unless you plan on making big batches of
soups to freeze for lunches. However, when you’re making homemade soup
of any kind, you want to have a fairly good-sized soup kettle.
It’s great if you have the time and energy to make homemade stocks — more
power to you. But pre-made stocks and broths are totally acceptable in a
healthy low-carb lifestyle, and they make your soup preparations quicker
and easier. But here’s a tip: You can find some great quality stocks and broths
in cartons these days to use as a base for quick homemade soups. Try them
instead of taking the can route. Stocks and broth in cartons are usually lower
in sodium and often more natural than their canned counterparts. Before you
buy any pre-made stock or broth, check the label for sodium content and see
whether the stock has a ton of preservatives. If so, walk on by and find some
that have lower sodium counts and fewer preservatives. You may want to
look for the word organic when buying pre-made stocks and broths.
Technically speaking, stock and broth are a bit different (but they’re all the
same to this cook)! When making stock all that’s necessary is water and
bones (unless it’s veggie stock). Stock is usually rather bland in flavor, and
it’s usually an ingredient in soup. Broth is usually a bit richer than stock, and
broth can be garnished and eaten by itself. Broth is prepared by simmering
meat, fish, or veggies and then straining them out.

Black soybeans: A great low-carb secret
I discovered a great low-carb secret in the
health-food store one day — black soybeans.
These little puppies are just delicious, and I use
them in chili, dips, and all sorts of food cre-
ations. They’re so low in carbs, and the flavor is
great in anything (see the recipe for Caribbean
Style Black Soybean Soup in this chapter and
check out Chapter 15 for another recipe, Spicy
Black Soybean Wraps). The official count on a
1⁄2 cup of black soybeans is 8 grams of carbs and
7 grams of fiber — pretty awesome at only 1 net
gram of carbs. And soybeans are so good for
you. They’re high in protein and fiber, low in sat-
urated fat and cholesterol, lactose free, and a
great source of omega-3 fatty acids. (Go over to
Chapter 9 for more on omega-3s and their
importance to your health.) In addition to all
of the nutrients in soybeans, ongoing research
is proving that they reduce the risk of certain
chronic diseases, including coronary heart 
disease.
The only black soybeans I’ve found are from
Eden Foods. I usually have to buy them at a
health-food store but have found them in a gro-
cery store or two. Make a couple phone calls to
check their stock before you make a trip across
town. If you find other brands of black soybeans,
please e-mail me at jan@janmccracken.
com, and I’ll get it out to low-carbers in my free
newsletter and post it on my Web site.

Cream of Broccoflower Soup
Have you met the broccoflower? Some mad scientist has crossed the cauliflower with
broccoli and created an incredible veggie. Hence, the broccoflower. I see it in all of the
produce departments at the grocery stores, but come to think of it, broccoflowers
haven’t shown up at the farmer’s markets. Anyway, the stuff is bursting with great nutri-
ents like phytochemicals (see more on phytos in Chapter 12).
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
101
Chapter 7: Soothing Your Low-Carb Soul with Soup
11⁄2 cups chicken stock
2 cups coarsely chopped broccoflower
1⁄4 cup chopped green onions
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons whole-wheat pastry flour
1⁄2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon white pepper
1 cup light cream
1⁄2 cup chopped Italian parsley
1 Using a 3-quart, heavy saucepan, combine the chicken stock, broccoflower, and green
onion. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes, or just until the
broccoflower is tender.
2 Remove from heat, and let the soup cool slightly. Carefully place the soup in the food
processor and puree until very smooth.
3 Melt the butter in the saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the flour, marjoram, salt,
and white pepper, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Gradually whisk in
the light cream, whisking until the mixture is smooth.
4 Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to
thicken and is bubbly (about 3 to 4 minutes). Stir in the puree of soup and heat to serv-
ing temperature. Sprinkle the parsley on top of the soup at serving time.
Tip: Optional garnishes for this soup include a dollop of sour cream, chopped Italian pars-
ley, and green onions. You may use just one or a combination of all three.

Mozzarella Cheese Soup 
with Fresh Mushrooms
Hearty — that’s what this soup is. Not only does it warm the cockles of your heart, but
it’s true old-fashioned comfort food! Combining mushrooms with mozzarella cheese in
any recipe is always a sure bet, and this soup is no exception: Yep, another mouth-
watering option for your low-carb lifestyle. Enjoy your soup and the cozy comfort too.

2 Return the pureed vegetables to the stockpot and simmer them over low heat while you
prepare the mushrooms.
3 Sauté the mushrooms in the lemon juice just until tender (about 4 minutes). Add the

Stopping for Soup around the World
Soup recipes that have been handed down through the ages and are an every-
day menu item for folks living in a particular province or region may become
a new adventure for you. Slurping as you go, discovering different staple
soups from around the world is an adventure. In the world of soup, here are
some places you might be off to:
 Russia or Poland for borscht
 China for its famous bird’s nest soup
 West Africa for ground peanut soup
 Finland for bilberry soup
 Ireland for lamb soup
 Italy for minestrone 
 Scotland for broth
 France for onion soup
 Mexico for chickpea soup
 England for mutton broth
 East India for mulligatawny
 Finally, a stop in Philly for some pepper pot soup
So grab your compass and your map, and take a little trip with me. (If Russian
borscht is calling your name, see a great recipe in Chapter 16.) I include only
a small sampling of the big world of soup, so I encourage you to branch out
after you’ve made all the soup recipes in this book and begin your own inter-
national recipe library. Your tummy will thank your adventuresome spirit.

Cold Mexican Shrimp Soup
This incredibly awesome soup is served ice cold. It’s great any time but especially on a
hot summer day. You can serve it as an appetizer or a main course. A friend came to my
house and showed me how to make this authentic Mexican dish. For a great presenta-
tion, serve this soup in something clear and tall, like a round-bottomed beer goblet or
big red wine glass. Tuck a lemon wedge on the side, and you’ve got elegance.

Chapter 7: Soothing Your Low-Carb Soul with Soup
1 pound medium shrimp
2 medium avocados
1 large lemon
1 finely chopped medium yellow onion
2 large tomatoes, diced
1 large cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced
1⁄2 cup finely chopped cilantro
1⁄2 pound fresh crab, flaked 
32-ounce jar clamato juice, chilled
Salt and pepper to taste
Lemon wedges for garnish
Additional finely chopped fresh cilantro for
garnish (optional)
1 Peel and devein the shrimp and rinse well.
2 Bring about 2 quarts of water to a boil. Add the shrimp and cook for 1 minute. Drain the
shrimp in a colander and run cold water over them. Set aside to cool further.
3 Dice the avocados and squeeze the juice of an entire lemon over them to prevent them
from turning dark.
4 In a very large salad bowl, combine the shrimp, avocados, onion, tomatoes, cucumber,
cilantro, and crab.
5 Add the clamato juice, mixing all the ingredients well. Salt and pepper to taste.
6 Refrigerate the soup for at least 3 hours before serving to allow flavors to mingle. This
is better the longer it chills. If you can make it about 6 hours ahead of time, it’s even
more scrumptious!
7 Serve in tall, clear, round-bottomed glasses. Garnish with a lemon wedge tucked on the
side of the glass and lightly sprinkle the top of each serving with cilantro if desired.

California Fishermen’s Soup
California is a country, right? Okay, maybe not. But I want stop in San Francisco for
some great fishermen’s soup. Living in and near the fishing towns of California, I’ve
learned that fishermen who cook their catch tend to cook it a bit differently. It’s the
taste of the fish they’re after, not all the other stuff. This is a tomato-less fish soup, as
a tomato base can cover up the true flavor of the fish at times. Enjoy this simply fish
soup. (Swim over to Chapter 16 for a very different fish chowder slow cooker recipe.)

4 minutes.
2 Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the pan. Add the halibut, haddock, and
snapper to the oil-and-veggie mix. Cook the fish until it’s almost opaque, about 4 minutes.
3 Add the fish stock and the wine, stirring to combine the ingredients, and bring it to a
slow boil. Lower the heat and let simmer for about 5 minutes.
4 Add the scallops and the salt. Cover and cook for 2 minutes. Add the parsley, tarragon,
and chives. Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper.
5 Cook over medium-high heat until the soup returns to a boil. Remove from heat and

To get the most flavored vegetable soups, use the freshest ingredients you
can find. If you really want to spoil yourself, go to the farmer’s market early
on a Saturday or Sunday morning, buy your veggies, and go directly home
and prepare your soup. 
Chillin’ with Soup
Soup isn’t always about warming your tummy. You can serve cold soup as a
dessert, as a cooling first course of a summer brunch, or even as a snack
between meals. Most chilled fruit soups are purees that are sweetened and
diluted with wine, fruit juice, or ice water. Many fruits, in addition to the ones
I use here, can be used in soup such as strawberries, melons, peaches, pears,
sour cherries, and oranges, to mention just a few.
If you’re preparing cold soup to serve to guests and want it to be close to per-
fect, use a metal bowl when combining the ingredients and when chilling. The
soup chills more quickly and more thoroughly this way.
T Blender Blueberry Soup
This delicious cold blueberry soup is ready to serve in a few minutes. Try it as a dessert
or with brunch on a hot summer day. If it’s too thick for your liking, thin it with just a
little white wine. The carb counts put this soup on the “treat” list. To slim down the
counts further and still enjoy cold blueberry soup, skip the orange juice in this recipe
and use yogurt that’s as low in carb counts as possible.

In This Chapter
 Thinking outside the bowl: Creating better salads
 Treating your taste buds to tomatoes
 Layering on the leftovers for a heartier salad
 Dressing lightly
T
he low-carb lifestyle encourages eating gener-
ous daily amounts of leafy greens — the
greener the better. But if you’re like many low-
carbers, you may find yourself slipping into that
culinary black hole of salad boredom. You know
the drill — chop lettuce, add sliced tomatoes,
pour on bottled dressing, eat, and repeat. The rou-
tine gets so old that most people don’t even come
close to their low-carb daily allowance of greens
and veggies.
But I’m here to remind you that salads don’t have to be just salads. With the
endless alternatives for building easy, fast, and great salads, you can quickly
jump out of that rut and take advantage of the all the wonderful options
salads present, as an essential staple of the low-carb diet.
The green leafy stuff is essential to healthy low-carb eating because it fills
you up, not out. (The same can be said for other veggies as well, and I return
to the garden in Chapter 12.) Greens are often overlooked and underesti-
mated in the low-carb lifestyle. Yet most greens are so low in carbs and high
in fiber that they make the almost perfect low-carb food. You’ll be delightfully
and healthfully surprised as you begin to build more and more greens into
your eating plan. This leafy stuff is almost as good as a life insurance policy.

Building a Better Salad: Balancing
Tastes, Textures, and Colors
Combining colors, flavors, ingredients, and seasonings in creative salad ways
not only wakes up your taste buds, but it also provides you a beautiful rain-
bow of health benefits too good to pass up. Discovering lettuce in colors from
bright green to red with textures ranging from almost buttery soft to peppery
and crunchy is an easy assignment. I encourage you to use the freshest and
finest ingredients for success in building better salads. Welcoming enticing
newcomers to your familiar salad favorites is a great way to begin. (See the
list of greens in the “Checking out the greens guide” section for the inside
story of some greens that you may or may not be familiar with.)
Embracing the low-carb lifestyle with lots of the green stuff as a basic compo-
nent puts you in a great position on the yellow brick road to wellness, which is
exactly where you want to be — carb correct and healthy! Besides their carb-
counting appeal, greens offer the obvious nutritional benefits of vitamins, min-
erals, and fiber. Plus phytochemicals, the new star of the nutritional stage, are
everywhere in the green stuff. Experts have recently documented more than
25,000 phytos. After they’re inside our bodies, this little army of phytochemi-
cals unites as a team to fight diseases such as heart disease, certain cancers,
high blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes. (Check out Chapter 12 for more info
on veggies and phytos.) Leafy dark-green vegetables also supercharge your
diet with vitamins A and C, riboflavin, folic acid, iron, calcium, magnesium,
and potassium, along with a fine supply of antioxidants. Plus, an overlooked
biggie of salad greens is that they’re a source of much needed fiber in your
overall healthy diet. (See more on the importance of fiber in Chapter 3.)
The darker colored parts of vegetables and fruits are known to have a higher
concentration of phytochemicals and valuable nutrients. For instance, the
dark green leaves of lettuce are richer in nutrients than the lighter green or
whitish leaves. So pick the freshest and the darkest greens you can find!
Build meals around salads, or build salads around meals. You can choose
salads to prepare in advance or salads that are quick to fix. The secret is
making sure you have the necessary ingredients on hand so your salad is
ready when you are. Sneaking extra healthy veggies into your salads not only
adds variety and crunch to your salads, but it also results in more health ben-
efits for you.

plate with a dollop of mayonnaise on top. If you were lucky, you may have
gotten a half-ripened slice of tomato, too. However, a new leaf has been
turned over in low-carb salads.
The essence of low-carb salads begins with freshness and ends only with
your creativity and a bit of boldness. Low-carb salads are hot and cold, pick-
led and marinated, side dishes or the main fare, a solid buffet presentation or
a festive party snack. Low in carbs, high in health — are you sold? If so, here
are a few suggestions for fitting more leafy greens into your diet:
 Make a concerted effort to double your normal daily portion of the
green and leafy.
 Experiment with one new leafy green and veggie recipe every week. (See
the “Checking out the greens guide: Lettuce begin” section later in this
chapter for tips on introducing a variety of greens to your salad bowl.)
 Keep a variety of frozen vegetables in your freezer to add to your fresh
greens just in case you don’t have fresh veggies available or you’re in a
hurry.
 Build your spice cabinet, and experiment with different spices. You’ll be
amazed by what a little sprinkling can do for your salad building, and
your taste buds will applaud your creativity.
 Eat more salads as entrees. Doing so may even leave a little room both
carb count-wise and in your tummy for a special low-carb sweet treat. The
trade-offs can be very positive (see some yummy sweets in Chapter 13).
Perhaps the best way to build salads more quickly and easily is to take
advantage of all those different combinations of packaged fresh greens, veg-
gies, and even coleslaw. With the convenience of fresh, packaged salad
greens and ready-to-go veggies, building enticing low-carb salads is a snap.
These mixtures make it easy to try lots of different kinds of greens and mix
them with your favorite veggies without having to purchase entire bunches
or heads of the leafy green stuff. Here are a few points to consider:
 When purchasing bags of mixed, prewashed lettuce and greens, pay close
attention to the date stamped on the bag. Buy wise, and select the use by
date that’s as far ahead in the future as possible for added freshness.
 Although washing these packaged greens and veggies isn’t necessary, I
always give them a quick rinse and pop them in a plastic bag to make
them a bit crisper and more alive.
Eating any of the green leafy stuff is better than not eating any at all!

Checking out the greens guide
As you begin to paint some green into your diet, you’ll notice the many vari-
eties of lettuce and greens to choose from. Remember, variety is the spice of
the low-carb lifestyle, so mix it up! Here’s a little lettuce lesson to help you
make your decisions about which greens to buy (you can check out what
some of these fine little fellas look like in Figure 8-1):
 Arugula: Full of bittersweet flavor, this stuff has skinny, notched leaves.
Some folks like it by itself; I like to mix it with other greens.
 Belgian or French endive: Smooth and elongated, these endives have
compact heads of slender, crisp leaves and a slightly bitter flavor that
makes them taste best when mixed with other greens.
 Bibb lettuce: No, you don’t wear this lettuce around your neck! Bibb 
lettuce has little heads of very tender and silky feeling leaves. It’s very
mild — almost sweet. You can serve this one alone or with other lettuces.
 Boston lettuce: Boston lettuce is similar to Bibb lettuce in texture,
because it feels kind of buttery and is very tender. It’s perfect all alone
or mixed with other lettuce.
 Chinese cabbage: This cabbage consists of long, slender, tightly closed
heads of wide-ribbed tender leaves. The flavor is mild, and it can be
served alone or mixed.
 Curly endive: Leaves are curly and fringy. Endive has a very sharp,
bitter taste, so you can mix it with milder greens for a pleasing combo.
 Dandelion: No, dandelions aren’t weeds! They’re actually very good for
you. The leaves are jagged, a bit bitter and tangy in flavor, and rich in
calcium and vitamin A. Dandelions leaves can be eaten raw in salads, or
they can be steamed as a veggie dish. Dandelion is a French word, dent
de lion, which means “lion’s tooth.”
Be careful not to gather dandelions for consumption out of a yard that
has been sprayed with chemicals and pesticides.
 Escarole: No, not the snails! This is big lettuce with very wide and crisp,
flat leaves that curl on the edges. It’s a little on the bitter side, so I vote
to mix it with other types of lettuce.
 Frisée: Frisée is type of chicory, which is frequently used in mesclun
(see more about mesclun below). The attractive pale green leaves are
narrow and curly with a frizzy appearance and a slightly bitter taste.
 Iceberg: Good ol’ iceberg lettuce is 90 percent water and has very little
flavor — and almost no nutrients. Iceberg is a firmly packed head of
leaves similar looking to a head of cabbage. It isn’t a good choice for
114
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

because you might as well eat something that’s going to give you some
great nutrients while you’re munching.
 Mesclun: Mesclun is a somewhat expensive, mysterious mix that’s avail-
able by the pound in the produce department of the grocery store. You
can sometimes find it in a bag, pre-washed and ready to go. Mesclun is a
dandy little mix of very young, tiny salad greens. I cheat and buy just a
little for a special salad and mix it with other greens for added zest.
 Parsley: Not just another garnish, fresh parsley can add an unidentifi-
able bite to salads, so don’t overlook it.
 Radicchio: This little, usually expensive stuff is light red to rose-colored
with a slightly bitter flavor. Its texture is firm, and it brightens up the
dish when it’s mixed. A little goes a long way.
 Red and green leaf lettuce: Leaves are broad, tender, and loose, with
a mild and delicate flavor. This lettuce may be curly and green or red-
tipped and can be served alone or mixed with other greens.
 Romaine: This lettuce is the great stuff that Caesar makes his salads out
of. Very firm and crisp with a hint of nutty flavor, romaine is perfect
served alone or with other greens.
 Savoy cabbage: This crinkle-like leaf of green cabbage has a milder
flavor than red or green cabbage.
 Sorrel: This type of green has long, crisp, arrow-shaped leaves with a
sour and pungent flavor. It tastes best mixed with other lettuces.
 Spinach: Spinach salad is great by itself or as a welcome addition
blended with other greens. Be sure to trim away the tough stems
because they can be very bitter.
 Watercress: The stems are tough, so cut them off and throw them away.
Otherwise, watercress is very crispy with a little peppery flavor. I prefer
to mix it with other greens.
Use fresh, fresh greens that are as blemish-free as possible and that have
been carefully washed, dried, and stored properly in the refrigerator for
crispness.
A good guide when wondering how many salad greens to combine if you’re
not buying prepared salad mixes is to use three basic greens (and then add
everything but the kitchen sink).

T Marinated Fresh Garden Salad
You can add extra zest to this salad by briefly marinating the vegetables before adding
the greens. Your taste buds will ask, “What’s different about this salad?” These greens
have extra crunch that’s sure to please salad lovers. I think this salad is especially good
served with chicken as the main dish.

Lettuce begin painting 
salads with boldness
Salads are one of the mainstays of the low-carb lifestyle and are a palette to
paint whatever you desire. I say, paint with boldness. Try something new reg-
ularly, and break the mold of salad rut and routine. Remember the sky is the
limit when picking enhancements for salad building.
Edible flowers
Edible flowers can make a salad very special,
so experiment with tossing some around! Did
you know the more fragrant the flower, the more
flavorful the blossom is? You can find these
lovelies in the produce section of many grocery
stores. Edible flowers to look for are lavender,
nasturtiums, violets, rose petals, geraniums,
dianthus, and lobelia.

You can add just about anything — including leftovers:
 Top your salads with berries when in season (see the “Squeezing in
berries and fruits” section later in the chapter)
 Sprinkle nuts on top of your salad for texture and crunch.
 Add rings of red onion for flavor and color.
 Add meats, fish, or seafood to make your salad a real meal. (Check out
the Tomato and Beef Salad with Red Wine Vinaigrette recipe in the
“Dressing Up Low-Carb Salads” section later in the chapter.)
 Add cheeses of all different kinds. Cheeses in your low-carb salads help
fill you up, not out. And who says you can only have one kind of cheese
on a salad? Simply not true.
 Experiment with homemade salad dressings. They’re so easy to prepare,
and I guarantee if you just give them a try, you’ll take bottled dressings
off your grocery list (see easy and quick dressing recipes in the “Dressing
Up Low-Carb Salads” section later in this chapter).

Chapter 8: Building More Than Just a Salad
Salad Spinning 101
Do yourself a favor and acquire a “lettuce life-
saver” — a salad spinner. This simple kitchen
gadget makes drying greens quick and easy.
The salad spinner is a two-part device with a
large plastic bowl on the outside and a plastic
basket on the inside. When shopping for your
salad spinner, you choose between a few dif-
ferent styles — a crank, pull-cord, or push-
button machine style. All of them work equally
well; however, my personal preference is the
crank-style.
After thoroughly washing the greens, place
them in the inside basket, which is usually large
enough to hold a whole head of lettuce. Let the
spin begin! You’ll be amazed at the high speed
this little rascal spins. The water literally flies off
the greens, leaving them fresh, clean, and crisp.
The spinner is easy to clean and a must for the
low-carb salad enthusiast. Spinners aren’t
expensive, and lately I’ve even seen them at the
dollar stores. So spin on.

T Stir-Fried Lettuce
This is kind of a modern day form of the old-fashioned wilted lettuce, but I like it so
much more. I gardened with my grandfather as a child, and wilted lettuce was one of his
all-time favorites. We’d pick lettuce from the garden just before supper. Back then, it
was made with bacon drippings that we saved. And if you want to pick one lettuce
that’s your favorite, that’s dandy too. The trick to making this dish really special is to
be sure not to overcook the lettuces. You want the leaves to be wilted but not droopy.
You can serve this with anything your little heart desires, and I’m sure you’ll get rave
reviews. I like this served with anything from steak to lemon-chicken. The added touch
of warming your salad plates underscores the flavors of this dish. If you want to toast
the sesame seeds in this recipe, go for it by checking out the “Sesame seeds: Toast of
the town” sidebar in this chapter.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
120
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced fine
1-inch piece fresh gingerroot, peeled and
grated
6 cups mixed lettuces torn into pieces
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 Place 4 ovenproof salad bowls in the oven at 325 degrees to warm.
2 Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and gingerroot, and stir
for about 15 seconds.
3 Add the lettuce combination, quickly turning to mix with the hot oil. Continue cooking
and turning constantly until the lettuce is wilted. This will take no longer than 2 minutes
total, and it could be less if you use soft lettuces.
4 Divide the lettuce into the warm serving bowls. Toss with soy sauce and sprinkle with
sesame seeds.
Variation: Try this recipe using just spinach instead of a combination of lettuces if you
love spinach as much as I do.

Squeezing in berries and fruits
Adorn your low-carb salads with berries and fruits of the season. Not only do
berries and fruits add a bounty of color contrast against a plate of salad greens,
but they’re also at their juiciest and most flavorful when in season. Along with
the great flavor come great sources of Vitamin C and other nutrients — all part
of the big picture of your healthy low-carb lifestyle.
Salads with berries tossed on top pique interest in the dish and add zest to
the taste. Adding berries to salads has always been touted as a California
thing. If that’s the case, thank you California.
If your goal is to make the most perfect salad possible, begin by chilling the
salad bowl that you’re going to mix the ingredients in. Take it a step further
and chill the serving plates for about 20 minutes in advance of serving. These
steps will guarantee your salads to crackle when you eat them. If you don’t
have time for both steps, opt for chilling the serving plates!

Chapter 8: Building More Than Just a Salad
Sesame seeds: Toast of the town
Sesame seeds can be used as an addition to
any salad recipe. If you really want to add some
more flavor, try toasting the seeds if you have
time. It intensifies the flavor of this nutty little
seed and makes them almost buttery. Toasting
sesame seeds takes little time — you just need
to stay with them. Just take a heavy, dry skillet
and heat the seeds over medium heat stirring
constantly until the seeds are golden brown
(only about 3 to 5 minutes max). The little ras-
cals will get really fragrant while you’re toast-
ing them. Don’t leave them sit in the skillet or
they’ll continue to toast, and they may burn.
Turn them out of the skillet as soon as they’re
golden brown and smelling fine. If you want to
store them, place them in a tightly sealed jar at
room temperature.

Berry Peachy Greens 
and Turkey Salad
Adding berries and nuts to any of your favorite green salads makes them come alive
and become very palate pleasing. Be sure to watch for fresh berries on sale and in
season, and take advantage of enjoying them in this recipe and in all your salad adven-
tures. If fresh peaches are out of season, you can substitute thawed, frozen peaches.
This salad is included in one of the photos in the color section of the book.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
122
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
1 medium fresh peach
2 cups fresh strawberries
1 cup fresh blueberries
6 cups packaged mixed greens
2 cups cubed cooked turkey
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1⁄4 cup sugar-free peach preserves
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1⁄2 cup toasted pecan pieces
1 Wash the peach, strawberries, and blueberries in a colander under cold water. Slice the
peach very thin, and cut the strawberries in half.
2 In a large salad bowl, combine the salad greens, turkey, blueberries, strawberries, and
peach slices. Mix well.
3 To make the dressing, combine the olive oil, peach preserves, and vinegar in a small
bowl. Mix well using a small whisk.
4 Pour the dressing over the salad and toss just to coat. Sprinkle with pecans.

Tomato Power
Although tomatoes have had a reputation for being a little high in carb count,
the health benefits far outweigh the carbs. A small tomato has approximately
3.5 net grams of carbs. You no longer have to be tomato-deprived in your low-
carb lifestyle.
The luscious red color of the tomato is produced by an antioxidant called
lycopene. This powerful nutrient plays a role in delaying cancer cells from one
phase to the next, as well as protecting cell damage and assisting in the aging
process. This superman of an antioxidant has been proven to reduce the risk
of breast, prostate, colon, and other cancers. The citric acid in this red veggie
also aids your kidneys in flushing toxins out of your body. Tomatoes are also
rich in vitamin A, vitamin E, potassium, iron, and fiber. And just so you know,
green tomatoes don’t contain lycopene.
It turns out that tomatoes are healthier for you when they’re cooked. Tomatoes
contain a lot of water, and as they’re cooked, the water evaporates and they
become more concentrated. So if you have a half-cup of raw tomatoes versus a
half-cup of cooked tomatoes in the form of tomato sauce, the sauce is a much
more concentrated form of lycopene.

Simple and quick green salad combos
Taking advantage of all the market-fresh choices
at your fingertips is easy — and it doesn’t even
require a recipe. Use some of these ideas to get
started:
 Torn Boston lettuce leaves, radicchio, aru-
gula, walnuts, and crumbled goat cheese,
tossed with your choice of vinaigrette.
 Quick Greek Salad: torn mixed green
combo, minced fresh mint leaves, chopped
fresh Italian parsley, crumbled feta cheese,
and chopped pitted black olives. Simply
drizzle with olive oil and squeeze with fresh
lemon juice.
 Torn romaine lettuce, ribbon slices of turkey
breast, walnuts, red onion rings, chopped
fresh pear. Just add vinaigrette of your
choice.
 Torn spinach leaves, sliced fresh mush-
rooms, thinly sliced red onion rings, finely
chopped hard cooked egg, a couple thin
slices of fresh orange. Add vinaigrette of
your choice.

T Cherry Tomato and 
Mozzarella Salad
This is a simple salad that just can’t be beat, especially if you have cherry tomatoes
that not only look and taste like tomatoes but smell like tomatoes too. This salad can
be served with almost anything, and it’s great as a snack at your desk.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
124

4 cups red cherry tomatoes
8 ounces small fresh mozzarella cheese balls 
1⁄2 cup fresh basil leaves, loosely packed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄4 teaspoon sea salt
Pepper to taste (optional)
1 Rinse the cherry tomatoes. With a very sharp knife, cut the tomatoes in half and place
them in a medium-sized serving bowl.
2 Carefully drain the mozzarella cheese, and cut each mozzarella ball into quarters.
3 Rinse the basil leaves under cold water and tear in very small pieces.
4 Add the mozzarella cheese pieces and the basil to the tomatoes.
5 Drizzle with olive oil and lightly sprinkle with sea salt. Top with freshly ground black
pepper if desired.

Did you ever think that anything so delicious could be so good for you? You
can find hundreds of varieties of the tomato today, all relatives of the original
garden variety. Some that you’ll be familiar with are the beefsteak, the Italian
plum, and the sweet red cherry tomato. The tomato volunteers for the role of
enhancing salads and playing a tasty part in hearty soups and great sauces.
You can serve the tomato alone, sliced with salt and pepper, or you can
gently stuff it with a variety of goodies and serve it as a main course. Go
ahead — put fresh tomatoes in your low-carb salads, and use canned toma-
toes in your cooking.
Watch for added sugar in canned tomatoes. Tomatoes have some natural
sugars, but read the labels — you’ll find a vast difference in various brands.
You probably won’t find any without some added sugars, just choose the
ones with the lowest sugar possible.

T Calico Tomato Salad
This is a very old recipe from my gardening days, so I’ve had it in my recipe collection
for many years. It’s a beautiful salad and easy to prepare. Be sure to use very ripe, firm,
and red tomatoes for this salad, so the true homegrown tomato flavor comes out.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 8 servings

1⁄2 teaspoon dried basil
1⁄4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
1 Cut the tomatoes, zucchini, and yellow pepper in 1⁄2-inch pieces. Place them in a flat
serving bowl.
2 Combine the vinegar, oil, parsley, seasoned salt, basil, marjoram, and pepper in a jar with

If you plant a garden and have an abundance of tomatoes during the season,
try freezing them. When I had a huge garden in the Midwest, I picked ripe but
solid tomatoes (in other words, not mushy). Rinse them well and core them
like you would an apple. Then place them on waxed paper on a cookie sheet,
and put them in the freezer. After they’re frozen, place them in plastic bags
and put them back in the freezer. They aren’t good to eat sliced after they’re
frozen; however, they’re great in soups, chili, and sauces. The skins come
off during cooking, and you can take a slotted spoon and skim them off and
throw them away. But be sure not to peel them: Not only do they freeze
better with their skins on, but a lot of the nutrients are in the skin.
Use your nose when you buy tomatoes, whether at the grocery store or at a
farmer’s market. Stick your nose up to the stem end of the tomato, close your
eyes, and take a sniff. Does it smell like a tomato? If not, put it down and try
again. A tomato passes the good tomato test when it has great color, has taut
skin, and smells like a tomato.

Beefing Up Your Salad
Check your fridge. Almost any leftover from steamed veggies to grilled steak
can turn a little ol’ green salad into a meal. In addition to the veggies and the
meat or maybe fish, add some cubes or thin slices of cheese, sprinkle with
your favorite nuts for crunch, and top with your favorite homemade dressing.
Voilà — quick, easy, and filling. When you eat fresh and healthy, you’ll find
that staying in tune with your low-carb lifestyle is a snap. And look out for the
increased energy that you’ll have.
Tomato and Beef Salad 
with Red Wine Vinaigrette
Use this as a basic supper salad, but feel free to add more ingredients. Substitute your
favorite cheese or a combination of cheeses in place of the blue cheese. And if you
don’t have beef in the fridge but you do have turkey, use turkey. I think you get my drift
here. My purpose in giving you this recipe is for you to follow the steps as written if you
want to, but also to inspire your boldness in salad building. It’s an ongoing project.

Dressing Up Low-Carb Salads
Tossing is an art, and dressing is the medium you use to accomplish perfect
tossing. Always add the oil first, and toss just until the leaves are coated,
giving the greens a bit of armor and discouraging wilting. Simply adding
lemon juice or vinegar and a dash of salt and freshly ground black pepper
results in a close to perfect salad.
You can quickly and easily make dressings with some tasty combos in the food
processor or blender. Let’s hear it for homemade salad dressings! Don’t let the
word homemade intimidate you and make you think you’re going to be slaving
in the kitchen for hours. You’re going to love homemade salad dressings so
much that you’ll only have a store-bought dressing in your low-carb fridge
“just in case.” Bottled dressing will become your back-up, and homemade will
become an everyday staple. Trust me here. Your palate is going to direct you
on this one. When you think of vinaigrette, you may assume it’s a boring combi-
nation of oil and acid, but it’s so much more. The oil coats the greens to keep
them from wilting, and the vinegars, herbs, and spices make your mouth sing.
The basic recipe for successful vinaigrette is a base proportion of one part
vinegar to three parts oil, however — and this is a big however — adjust this
to your own personal taste. You may like a little more bite so add more vine-
gar. You can use different types of oils, infused and flavored vinegars, and
any herbs and spices to your liking. Here’s a jumping off place for you to get
started in creating your own special variations of basic vinaigrette. After you
get started with all the great oils, vinegars, and a dash of this and a pinch of
that, there won’t be any stopping you. Try these variations using the one-part
vinegar to three parts oil formula as your starting point.
 Garlic Vinaigrette: Just add 1 clove of garlic, finely minced.
 Dried Herb Combo Vinaigrette: Combine 1⁄2 cup of each of the following:
marjoram, savory, basil, parsley, and thyme. Keep in an airtight container.
Add 1 tablespoon of the mixed herbs to a new batch of vinaigrette. Let
the herbs mingle and breathe for about 30 minutes before serving, or pre-
pare several hours before and store in the fridge until serving time.
127
Chapter 8: Building More Than Just a Salad

 Toasted Sesame Seed Vinaigrette: Just add 1 teaspoon of toasted
sesame seeds, 1⁄2 clove minced garlic and 1 packet of Splenda sugar sub-
stitute. Try using rice vinegar in this combination. (See the “Sesame
seeds: Toast of the town” sidebar for a quick toasting lesson.)
 Lemon or Lime Vinaigrette: Just add two tablespoons freshly squeezed
lemon or lime. 
• Lemon Dill Vinaigrette: Just add 2 teaspoons dill, minced fine. Let
the flavors mingle for about 20 minutes before serving.
• Lemon Thyme Vinaigrette: Just add 1⁄2 teaspoon finely minced fresh
thyme. Let the flavors mingle for about 20 minutes before serving.
In making your vinaigrette whisk together all of the ingredients except the oil,
adding the oil last, slowly in a steady stream whisking as you go. If you’re
adding fresh herbs wait until just before dressing your salad before adding
them. Or throw the ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid, and shake well.
You’ll soon throw away the recipe and just build your own from scratch —
another accomplishment for you in low-carb living.
After you find a basic vinaigrette that you like, you can begin to experiment
with flavored oils (walnut or hazelnut, for example) and vinegars (like rasp-
berry or balsamic), adding fresh-squeezed lemon or lime juice and a variety
of herbs and spices. The magnifying effects of herbs and spices are probably
more appreciated in a fresh salad than any other dish because a salad is so
light and fresh itself. The great news about cooking with herbs and spices is
that for the most part, they’re all very low in both carbs and calories.
Be sure to check the labels on flavored vinegars for sugars, hidden or other-
wise (see Chapter 3 on label reading). This also goes for Dijon mustards that
are a great addition to vinaigrettes.

The French connection
This may come as a surprise to you but the
basic dressing of the French isn’t “French
dressing” as you know it — red and in a bottle!
The preferred salad dressing of the French is a
very simple combination of good oil, great wine
vinegar, freshly ground pepper, and salt.
Sometimes garlic is added, especially in the
South of France, and a little mustard may be
thrown in as well. When fresh herbs are in
season, it’s whatever you want to toss in like dill,
thyme, rosemary — your call.
The word vinegar comes from the French vin
aigre, meaning soured wine. Vinegars have an
average of about 6 percent acidity and keep for
a long time if they’re sealed. As a good bottle of
wine reacts to the air, so does vinegar. The shelf
life for vinegar to keep its bite is about 6 months.

T Greens with Walnut Dressing
Each time you make this salad, try a different mix of greens. I’ve added mesclun to this
recipe just for fun. But it’s only an option, and using another type of lettuce won’t take
away from the recipe. A sprinkling of edible flowers makes this salad a special occasion.
(See the “Edible flowers” sidebar in this chapter for more information.)
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 half-cup servings
129
Chapter 8: Building More Than Just a Salad
5 to 6 cups packaged mixed greens
1⁄2 cup mesclun (optional)
1 ripe pear, washed and chopped
1⁄2 cup walnut pieces
Walnut Dressing (see the following recipe)
Edible flowers of your choice, such as
nasturtiums (optional)
1 Put the greens, mesclun, if desired, chopped pear, and walnuts in a big bowl for tossing.
2 Pour the Walnut Dressing over the salad and gently toss. Serve on clear glass plates that
have been chilled in the freezer.
3 Garnish with edible flowers, if desired.
Walnut Dressing
2 tablespoons walnut oil
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, crushed
1⁄4 teaspoon dried summer savory
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
Combine the walnut oil, olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, savory, and salt in a jar with a
very tight-fitting lid (like an old peanut butter jar). Shake until well blended. Chill until
serving time.

You don’t want to be underdressed when you go to a gala, but the ultimate
embarrassment is to be overdressed for the occasion. The same goes for
salad dressings — overdressing is a soggy no-no. I can’t stress enough not to
overdress your salad. For 8 cups of loosely packed greens, 1⁄4–1⁄3 cup of dress-
ing is adequate. You should dress your salads at serving time, because the
same ingredients that perk up a salad — citrus juices and vinegars — also
make the salad go limp if not eaten promptly.

A
while back, you couldn’t enjoy fresh sea fare
unless you lived close to the sea. Well, my
low-carb friends, this is no longer the case thanks
to flash freezing of the freshest of fish from fresh
and salty waters all over the globe. You can now
reel in almost any type of seafood at your local
grocery store.
Where you live is the criteria for how fresh fish arrives at your fish counter.
Fish may be labeled fresh, but it may have been traveling for a while since it
left the boat dock. Let’s face it — when a fish is out of water, things change,
so I’m going to tell you what to look for and how to shop for fish in this chap-
ter. Then I turn my attention to simple and healthful methods to prepare all
kinds of fish and seafood. If fish isn’t a staple in your low-carb lifestyle, it
should be. Fish is easy to prepare, and it’s hard to mess it up. Fish gives you
a magic combination of being high on the good-nutrition scale and very low
on the carb-count scale.
You don’t have to dine at one of those expensive fish-market restaurants for
a great meal of fresh fish. I’m here to demystify the steps to take to make the
most of just about any fish you can think of. Fish is hooked into any healthy
lifestyle — and the low-carb approach is no exception.

Netting the Healthy Advantages
Many fish contain close to zero carbs, and the healthy advantages of adding
fish to your menu a couple times a week are just incredible. The message
here is eat more fish. Experts of all healthy lifestyles agree that incorporating
fish into your diet is healthy to the point that it can protect against sudden
cardiac death. Here are some of the healthy nutritional benefits of eating fish:
 Fish offer high-quality protein with fewer calories than a similar-sized
portion of meat.
 Fish are low in sodium and are good sources of potassium, vitamins, and
other minerals.
 Fish are generally low in cholesterol and saturated fats, which have been
associated with high blood pressure and heart disease. They also reduce
the risk factor of blood clots. (Shellfish, while low in saturated fat, are
high in cholesterol.)
Fish oils are healthy for you and essential. The oils in fish may be the best
source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Omega-3s lower your risk
of heart attack and stroke. They also prevent hardening of the arteries,
reduce arthritis pain, lower cholesterol, improve immune response and brain
function, and help to absorb calcium into the bones. Omega-3 fatty acid also
boosts the immune system’s ability to respond to developing breast cancer
tumors. You didn’t know that the little critter with fins and a tail has a life
insurance policy written on him, did you? Go fishing for omegas.
Oily, fatty fish like salmon are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Other
good sources of omega-3s are tuna, swordfish, mackerel, sardines, herring,
and halibut.
Calculating Carb Counts of Your Catch
Fish, whether they’re freshwater or saltwater, weigh in at zero carbs for the
most part. Some shellfish are an exception to the zero rule. It’s what you have
fish swimming in after you prepare it that usually drives up the carb count.
So, it’s “up periscope” for a closer look at some types of fish and carb counts. 
132
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

Lobster, prawns, and shrimp have about 1 gram of carbs per 100 grams of
seafood. And here are the approximate carb counts per 100 grams of fish and
seafood at the higher end:
 Abalone — 6 grams
 Calamari (squid) — 4 grams
 Clams — 2.5 grams
 Mussels and oysters — almost 4 grams
 Octopus — 2 grams
 Scallops — 2.5 grams
Imitation crab has very high carb counts — the real deal is always best!
Purchasing and Preparing 
the Catch of the Day
Fresh is what you want when it comes to fish! In this section, I help you out
with a little excursion to the fish counter, giving you advice on what to look
for so you can enjoy the freshest fish that’s available (short of catching it
yourself). And, if I had my way, I’d be catching my own — this girl loves to go
fishing!
133
Chapter 9: Living a Low-Carb Life by the Sea
The following fish and seafood have zero carb counts:
 Anchovies
 Bluefish
 Cod
 Crab
 Crayfish
 Halibut
 Mackerel
 Mahi mahi
 Salmon
 Scrod
 Snapper
 Trout
 Tuna

Reeling in quality
I’ve been lucky enough to have quite a few opportunities while living in
California to step aboard albacore tuna boats in the early morning hours as
they dock with their overnight catch. I’ve also had the pleasure of sitting and
watching shellfish being unloaded on the dock while I nibbled on fresh cala-
mari rings. I’ve even caught my own freshwater fish and cooked them that
night over a campfire. But not many people have the time (or the opportu-
nity) to walk down to the docks or out to a stream every time they want to
enjoy these kinds of palate-pleasing experiences. But, with a few tips and
tricks, you can come close to the quality — with much more convenience.
When you know what you’re looking for, you can easily recognize quality fish
and seafood. Whether you’re buying fresh fish off the boat, at your fish market,
at the grocery store, or from the frozen food aisle, following some simple guide-
lines will make goin’ fishin’ easy for you.
Buy your fresh fish from reputable fish counters in grocery stores and fish
markets.
When buying fresh whole fish, here are the ways to gauge quality:
 The scales are bright and should adhere closely to the skin of the fish.
 Gill color is important. If it’s red, oxygen is present, and the fish is
indeed very fresh. As the fish is out of the water longer, the color of the
gills begins to fade to a very light pink, then to gray, and eventually to a
greenish brown. Stay away from brown fish.
 A mild, fresh, sea-like smell is good, but fish should never smell “fishy.”
 Firm and elastic flesh is an excellent indication that fish is fresh. The
flesh shouldn’t be separating from the bones.
 Look the fish in the eye. Eyes should be bright and clear, almost trans-
parent and bulging a bit. Sunken fish eyes aren’t a good sign.
When buying cut fish steaks and fillets, look for precut signs of freshness sim-
ilar to buying whole fresh fish:
 No “fishy” odor, but a mild and fresh smell.
 No traces of browning or drying around the cut edges of the fish.
 Moist and firm flesh.
 If they’re in packaging, make sure it’s tightly wrapped packaging such as
shrink-wrap. The fish steaks or fillets should have no air space between
the wrapping materials, and there shouldn’t be any liquid in the package.
Proper handing of frozen fish is very important. When you’re talking frozen
fish, flash frozen is the way to go. Flash frozen refers to fish that are frozen at
134
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

sea immediately after the catch, which are sometimes even fresher than buying
fish off the boat at the dock. When buying your fish and seafood frozen, carry
this checklist in your head (or in your pocket):
 The packaging shouldn’t be damaged in any way and shouldn’t have any
holes.
 Look for any discoloration or freezer burn. If the slightest hint is pre-
sent, find another package.
 Make sure the package doesn’t have any ice crystals in it, whether it is
shrink-wrapped or a bag from the frozen section. This can be an indica-
tion that the product has been previously thawed and frozen again.
 Check for an expiration date stamped on the package. You should eat
the fish or seafood by this date.
Handling and storing fishies like a pro
When shopping for fish, always make your last stop the fish market or the
grocery store. Please don’t ever leave fish — fresh or frozen — in the car and
run other errands. When you get your fish home, if it’s fresh, wash it under
cold water and put it in the coldest spot in your refrigerator. If you want to
take really good care of your fish, ice it like the markets do. It’s best to eat
fresh fish within 24 hours of purchasing it.
135
Chapter 9: Living a Low-Carb Life by the Sea
Fishy talk
There are some interesting terms used when
talking about fish. Here’ are just a few so you
don’t get lost at sea at the fish counter. If you
already have a line on these terms, swim on by:
 Drawn fish: No, a drawn fish isn’t a fish
you’ve sketched out with your pencil. A
drawn fish is a whole fish with its entrails —
okay, guts — removed, but with its bones
and head left intact. Aren’t you glad I shared
this info with you?
 Dressed fish: All dressed up and no place
to go doesn’t apply here. A dressed fish is
one that has been scaled and has had the
entrails removed. It usually has the head,
tail, and fins removed. Smaller fish prepared
in this way are sometimes referred to as
pan-dressed.
 Fillets: This term gets tossed around all the
time. Fillets are the sides of a fish cut
lengthwise so they’re boneless and ready
to be cooked. Butterfly fillets are whole
fish that are split lengthwise down the front
of the fish so the backbone is easily
removed. The fish is then opened out flat,
butterfly-style.
 Steaks: Fish steaks are the crosscut sec-
tions of a large dressed fish. Steaks are
usually cut about 3⁄4-inch thick from the
thickest part of the fish.

Thoroughly wash and rinse knives, utensils, cutting boards, and containers
when handling fresh as well as cooked fish and seafood. It’s possible to cross-
contaminate. Cross-contamination can occur when cooked or ready-to-eat
foods pick up bacteria from other foods, hands, cutting boards, knives, or
other utensils. To avoid cross-contamination, keep raw fish and shellfish and
their juices away from other foods. Place your cooked fish on a clean plate —
never on the plate that was used to hold the raw fish or shellfish, unless
you’re a tidy cook and the plate’s already been washed and dried!
Determining when your fish is done
Whatever cooking method you choose for your fish, you can estimate approx-
imately 10 minutes of cooking time for each inch of fish. Here’s how to calcu-
late the size: Lay your whole fish, fillet, or steak flat on a counter or cutting
board (for a rundown on these terms and others, see the “Fishy talk “ sidebar
in this chapter). Find the thickest part and measure the thickness with a plas-
tic ruler that can be washed with warm, soapy water. If it’s less than an inch,
reduce the time a tad to prevent overcooking.
Fish is a delicate sort, and you cook fish to enhance its flavor, not to tender-
ize it like you do meat. Fish is supposed to be moist and almost translucent
when it’s done cooking. You can actually see the moisture of fish that’s
cooked to perfection.
When the recipe states that the fish should flake when testing for doneness,
that means you can insert a fork into the fish and easily break off flakes (see
Figure 9-1). Flakiness is a good sign. Overcooking fish can easily happen in
just a few extra minutes. When following recipes for fish, test for doneness
before the recipe tells you to. Why? Here are a couple reasons:
 All fish are not created equal. If you’re cooking fish fillets or steaks, they’re
most likely not the exact size the recipe calls for — there’s just a lot of
possible variations of the weight and size of fish fillets and steaks. 
 Like food from the microwave, fish continues to cook when you remove
it from the oven after poaching, steaming, or baking. I like my fish really
moist, so I remove it to a warm plate and let it rest for a few minutes for
this specific reason — it continues to cook and by the time I serve it the
doneness is perfect. Cooking fish to perfection isn’t difficult, and you’ll
learn the technique quickly.

Cooking Methods to Fit Your Fancy
As you become skilled at cooking fish, you’ll develop your own favorite ways
for preparing fish. The secret to cooking any fish is to make sure that it isn’t
overcooked and retains its natural moisture. The spices, herbs, or liquid you
use when cooking will help flavor the dish to perfection. In this section, I give
you some tried and true methods of fish cookery. I suggest that you set your
sails and be adventuresome and try several different methods to discover
your favorite. Ahoy!
Regardless of which preparation method you choose for your fish, you can
always add a little eye appeal by garnishing it with lemon halves and slices.
Check out Figure 9-2 for some suggestions on some snazzy lemon peelin’. 
Using parchment
En papillote is a French phrase that means in a paper case. Though it sounds
mighty impressive, this is an exceptionally easy cooking technique for fish,
and it makes an impressive presentation. Not only does the fish look pretty
when you serve it, but it’s also very moist because all the natural juices are
locked in the individual packages.
If you don’t have parchment paper in your pantry, next time you’re in the gro-
cery store, pick up a roll. As you experiment with different packet recipes for
fish and other foods, be aware that some will call for you to wet the parch-
ment, and then squeeze the water out so the paper is soft, pliable, and easy
to work with. The following recipe below doesn’t require that you wet the
parchment paper. You can use aluminum foil in place of parchment paper, but
it just isn’t quite the same for this one.

Oh, that
flaky fish.

Lemon-Thyme Halibut en Papillote
Simple combinations of herbs and spices combined with a touch of lemon or garlic can
make fish a mouthwatering and delightful addition to your low-carb lifestyle. Grab some
magical parchment paper, wrap this little fishy up, and move forward to new horizons
of cooking fish. Check out the finished product in the color section of the book.
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 18 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
138
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
1⁄2 cup olive oil
12 sprigs fresh thyme, divided
4 halibut fillets (approximately 8 ounces each)
4 lemons
8 tablespoons white wine
1 cup diced fresh tomato
1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Combine the olive oil and 8 sprigs of fresh thyme in a
small saucepan. Over medium-low heat, simmer the oil and the thyme for about 20 min-
utes. Remove the oil from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
2 While the oil heats and cools, check the fillets to make sure there are no bones. Cut 2 of
the 4 lemons in half. Cut the remaining 2 lemons in very thin slices and set aside.
3 Cut parchment paper in 8 10-inch circles. Brush one side of each circle of parchment
with some of the olive oil. Place the oiled circles oiled-side up, on a large baking sheet
with sides.
4 When the oil reaches room temperature, strain it to remove the thyme.
5 Place each fillet in the middle of 4 of the oiled circles of parchment. From the fresh
lemon halves, squeeze about 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice over each fillet.
6 Drizzle 2 tablespoons of wine over each fillet. Generously brush each fillet with the
thyme-flavored oil. Distribute the diced tomatoes evenly among the 4 fillets.
7 Place a couple fresh slices of lemon and a fresh thyme sprig on top of each fillet.
Carefully place a second oiled parchment circle on top of each fillet with the oil side
against the fillet.
8 Fold the edges of the parchment paper together, sealing well. Place the parchment pack-
ets on a large baking sheet with sides and bake for 15 to 18 minutes.
9 Serve the fillets in their parchment paper, because they make stunning presentations.
Be careful when opening each pouch, because steam will roll out along with the awe-
some aroma.
Variation: Other fillets that work well en papillote are cod, monkfish, grouper, and red
snapper.

In cooking in a packet, you’re wrapping the fish (and veggies if combing the
two) in a tight little package of parchment paper or foil. As the fish bakes, the
little paper packet fills with steam, cooking the fish and trapping all of the
savory flavors that you’ve wrapped up so carefully. So don’t open the packet
until you’re almost certain the fish inside is done. (For more packet cooking
information and recipes, steam on over to Chapter 20.)
Poaching
Poaching refers to a very simple method of cooking fish. You cook the fish in a
small amount of liquid just below the boiling point at a simmering temperature.
This cooking method makes the fish very moist and quite tasty. Poaching is not
boiling. The poaching liquid is brought to a slow simmer, cooking evenly and
gently. The simmer allows just a few bubbles to break the surface of the liquid.
The liquid you use when poaching is up to you and is the central flavoring
factor for the fish you’re cooking. I suggest you try several different kinds of
liquid until you discover the one that fits your fancy. You can use vegetable
stock, fish stock, clam juice, wine with herbs, and aromatic vegetables; all
are great choices for poaching fish of all kinds. Don’t be bashful: Add your
favorite herbs and spices, such as a bay leaf, a few sprigs of Italian parsley,
and a few peppercorns.

Chapter 9: Living a Low-Carb Life by the Sea

When you’re finished poaching your fish, don’t waste the poaching liquid. Drain
and strain it, and use it as a fantastic base for some very tasty sauces. Many
chefs have become famous for their sauces made from their poaching liquids!
Simple fish with simple preparation results in simply sumptuous outcomes.
When you poach fish, remove the skin before you begin the poaching process
or immediately after the poaching is complete. The skin becomes very rub-
bery on fish when it’s poached. If you’re poaching fillets, it’s much easier on
you and the fish to remove the skin before cooking; otherwise, you may tear
the flesh of the fish — the good stuff.
An old secret to poaching fish is to tie your fish in a piece of cheesecloth with
long ends so you can lift the fish out easily without breaking it apart.
You can poach fish by using either of the two traditional methods: on the top
of the stove or in the oven. You’ll develop your favorite style of poaching fish.
I suggest that you try both of the described methods here.
 Stovetop: Bring your poaching liquid to a boil and remove it from the
heat before adding the fish. Your poaching liquid should never be boiling
but should be kept at a simmer so you can attain perfect poaching. After
you’ve added your fish to the liquid, continue to cook at a simmer, cook-
ing for about 6 minutes per pound of fish.
 Oven: You can also poach in the oven. Just bring your poaching
liquid to a boil in a saucepan on the stove and pour the liquid over
the cheesecloth-wrapped fish in a baking pan. Cover the pan tightly
with aluminum foil and place it in a preheated oven at 375 degrees.
Poach for about 10 minutes per pound when oven-poaching.
Whichever poaching method you choose, you can tell when the fish is done
by doing the fork flake test (refer to Figure 9-1). Insert a fork into the piece of
fish, and when the fish flakes easily, it’s done. Don’t overcook your fish no
matter which way you choose to cook it.
Steaming
I’ve had the pleasure of traveling to China extensively, and the food I enjoyed
there was nothing short of awesome. One of the most delicious dishes I
enjoyed many times during my stay was the whole steamed fish. Not only
can a steamed fish be an entire meal, but it’s also high on the Richter scale
of healthfulness. You’ll appreciate this old Chinese method of cooking fish
because of the purity of flavor it develops.
Any fish likes to be steamed, so which kind of fish you steam is your choice
(I opt for trout in the recipe in this chapter). Steaming fish simply involve
cooking by steam that is usually generated from boiling water. The easiest
way to steam fish fillets or steaks is to use the oven.
140
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

Steamed Trout
This quick and delicious Chinese-style steamed trout provides a borderline elegant pre-
sentation. You can also use other types of fish with this technique. This recipe calls for
4 wooden chopsticks, but if you don’t have chopsticks, don’t worry. Simply cook the
fish by immersing it in the wine in a baking dish. This is more like poaching the fish
instead of steaming it, but the flavors are still simple and delicious.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
141
Chapter 9: Living a Low-Carb Life by the Sea
2 whole dressed freshwater trout (8 to 9
ounces each)
2 teaspoons fermented black soybeans (see
the note that follows)
1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon finely minced garlic
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 cup dry white wine
1⁄2 cup 2-inch carrot strips
2 green onions, cut in diagonal strips
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place your fish on a cutting board, and with a sharp
knife, score the fish in a crisscross pattern. Make the cuts about 1⁄4 inch deep and about
3⁄4 inch apart. Set aside.
2 Drain and rinse the black soybeans.
3 Combine the black soybeans, grated ginger, and minced garlic in a small bowl, mixing
well. Place 1 teaspoon of the mixture in each fish cavity.
4 Using a 13-x-9-inch baking dish, arrange 4 chopsticks across the bottom of the baking
dish. Place the fish on top of the chopsticks.
5 Dribble the soy sauce over the fish. Evenly distribute the remainder of the black soy-
bean mixture over the top of the fish.
6 Pour the wine in the bottom of the baking dish, under the fish.
7 Place the carrot and onion strips crisscross-style across the tops of the fish.
8 Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Testing fish
for doneness is done a little differently with a whole fish. Press the fish with your finger;
the area around the spot where you apply pressure will break into firm flakes. Also, the
fish will easily pull away from the bones.
Note: Fermented black soybeans can be purchased at Asian markets.

Firing Up the Barbie and Broiler
Outdoor grilling is a great way to prepare fish. Some types of fish take better
to grilling than others, however. Oily fish, such as salmon and trout, are very
good candidates for the barbie. You can grill whole fish, steaks, or fillets. If
you want to grill delicate fish or most freshwater fish, an easy fix is to grill the
fish in aluminum foil or use a grilling basket. Preparing fish this way prevents
it from sticking and falling through the cracks of the grill. It’s a fish out of
water, after all, and you don’t want to be chasing it all over the barbie!
To prevent fish from sticking to the grill, apply cooking oil to the surface of
the grill using an oiled paper towel or cooking spray before you light the grill.
Don’t be tempted to use cooking spray after it’s lit. Flames from the grill can
ignite the aerosol.
If you want to enhance the flavor of the grilled fish, place a shallow pan of
soaked wood chips on the lava rocks of your gas grill. Putting the chips
directly on the lava rocks may clog up your vents.
Whether it’s pouring rain outside or you just prefer broiling, you can easily
transform any “grill recipe” into a broiler-friendly feast. Simply use the stated
grilling time as a guide when you’re broiling. Remember the last thing you
want to do is overcook fish. Place the fish on a broiler pan and broil 4 to 6
inches from the heat, turning it only once. Baste with a sauce mixture if your
recipe says to. If not, just broil the plain ol’ fish and serve with a sauce or a
squeeze of lemon. For fillets or steaks that tend to dry quickly, like halibut,
keep them moist while broiling by brushing on some lemon or lime juice.
Check out the “Basting tasty fish” sidebar in this chapter for a number of
basting suggestions.
142
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
Basting tasty fish
You can baste fish with many different kinds of
liquid to seal in the natural moisture of fish while
it’s cooking. Most people think of butter or olive
oil when they think of basting fish, but all kinds
of options exist, and each imparts the fish with
a different enhancing flavor. Try some of these:

1⁄2 cup water and the juice of 1⁄2 fresh lemon,
cold
 Cold, dry, white wine
 Cold sour cream
 Cold heavy whipping cream
 Mixture of 1⁄2 cup white wine and 1⁄2 water,
hot

Grilled Salmon Steaks
This is the simplest preparation of salmon and possibly the very best — grilled with a
squeeze of fresh lemon and some melted butter. It’s an entrée fit for a king, yet so carb-
conscious and so full of those great omega 3s. I suggest that you don’t salt and pepper
the salmon before cooking; just have the shakers on the table in case someone would
like to season the cooked fish. If you’re cooking for just yourself, or yourself plus one,
this recipe is easily scaled down to fit your portion needs. The easy formula to cut this
recipe back is to figure 1 tablespoon of melted butter and a half of a lemon wedge per
salmon steak. To see the end result, check out the color section of the book. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 6 to 8 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
143
Chapter 9: Living a Low-Carb Life by the Sea
6 fresh salmon steaks (approximately 6
ounces each)
Olive oil for brushing
3 lemons, halved
6 tablespoons melted butter
1 Preheat your gas grill on high heat. Rinse salmon quickly under cold running water and
pat dry with a paper towel. Brush the fish with olive oil.
2 When the grill is hot, place the salmon on the grill. Don’t close the grill cover. Turn the
salmon only once, cooking about 3 minutes on each side (depending on the thickness of
your salmon steak).
3 Baste the salmon a few times with the olive oil while cooking. The salmon will be
opaque when done.
4 Remove the steaks from the grill. Drizzle each salmon steak with 1 tablespoon of melted
butter, and place 1⁄2 lemon on each plate. Serve immediately. If desired, serve more
melted butter on the side.
Variation: After initially brushing the salmon with olive oil, before placing the fish on the
grill, use a combination of sprigs of fresh dill, sage, rosemary, lovage, fennel, or other
herbs of your choice, and surround the fish with the fresh herbs, creating bundles. Tie the
herbs around the fresh salmon with kitchen twine you’ve soaked in water, and grill the bun-
dled salmon for a fantastic flavor. Let the flavor of the herbs and salmon take center stage:
Serve with just a bit of fresh squeezed lemon.

Mustard-Dilled Red Snapper
Red snapper is a very flavorful and lean fish. The color of this fish varies from shimmer-
ing pink to almost red. This recipe brings out just how delicate and delicious snapper
can be. All the snapper needs is a bit of enhancing with fresh dill, a little lemon juice,
and a touch of Dijon mustard, and you have an outstanding low-carb meal.

Nonstick cooking spray
1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon fresh minced dill
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
11⁄2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 1⁄2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
1 pound fresh red snapper fillets
4 lemon wedges
1 Preheat the broiler. Line the broiler pan with aluminum foil and spray the foil with non-
stick cooking spray. In a small bowl, mix the Parmesan cheese, dill, lemon juice, mus-
tard, mayonnaise, and pepper.
2 Place the fish fillets on the broiler pan and spread the mayonnaise mixture over the
tops and sides of the fillets, coating the fish evenly.
3 Place the fish 4 to 6 inches under broiler for about 6 minutes. The topping will begin to
brown, and the fish will begin to flake when tested with a fork. Watch that the topping
doesn’t get too brown.

Sole with Lemon and Garlic Sauce
This lemon and garlic sauce is fresh and lively. Use the leftover sauce to complement
veggies served on the side of this great dish for a how-low-can-you-go carb count meal.
Sole is a member of the huge flatfish family, which is a very confusing fish family.
Commercial fishermen in the United States reel in more than a dozen different species
of flatfish. Some are called flounder, some are called sole, and some are called both.
These fish are thin, flat fish with both of their eyes located on the side of their head that
faces up. Whatever these fish are called, they all share a delightful sweet and delicate
white flesh, so enjoy!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 5 to 10 minutes

Chapter 9: Living a Low-Carb Life by the Sea
1⁄2 teaspoon white pepper
3⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
3⁄4 teaspoon onion powder
1 pound fillets of sole
4 teaspoons melted butter
1 shallot, minced fine
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced fine
1 tablespoon finely minced fresh Italian
parsley
1 Preheat the broiler. Combine the white pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder and
sprinkle over the fillets.
2 Lay fish in an 8-x-12-inch baking pan.
3 Combine the butter, shallot, lemon juice, garlic, and parsley and spoon over the fish.
4 Broil the fish 4 to 6 inches from broiler for about 3 to 5 minutes. Fish will become opaque
quickly and will cook very quickly. Monitor the fish as it cooks because each of the fillets
has a mind of its own. One fillet may be done in 5 minutes, and it may take a total of about
10 minutes for all of the fillets to be done.
5 As each fillet gets done, remove it from the broiler pan, transfer to a warmed plate, and
cover with foil to keep warm until all fillets are done and ready to serve.
Tip: Always watch your cooking times and baby-sit fish when you’re cooking it. There’s
nothing worse than overdone, dry, and rubbery fish.

Swordfish Piccata
If you haven’t experienced swordfish, you’re in for a tasty low-carb surprise — you’ll be
amazed at the carb counts. The texture of swordfish appears to be meaty, but don’t let
that fool you into thinking it’s hardy and needs long cooking times. Treat it with a little
tender love and care to preserve its natural moisture.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 4 to 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
4 swordfish steaks (about 8 ounces and 
1⁄2-inch thick each)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons capers
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian
parsley
1 lemon, sliced very thin
1 Preheat the broiler. Rub both sides of the fish steaks with the olive oil. Grind fresh
pepper over both sides of the swordfish steaks and place them on the broiler pan.
2 Broil fish on each side for about 2 minutes, turning only once. Fish will turn almost
opaque.
3 Place fish on warmed plates for a nice touch. Sprinkle with fresh lemon juice, capers,
and fresh parsley. Garnish with lemon slices.
Variation: Try a simple olive oil and fresh lemon juice marinade for swordfish steaks. Use
1⁄4 cup fresh lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil. Combine with 2 minced
garlic cloves. Marinate the fish for about 20 minutes. Top each fillet with a slice of purple
onion and pop them under the broiler or on the grill. Sprinkle some fresh feta cheese on
top before serving.
Variation: Marinate chunks of swordfish in herbed vinaigrette for 15 to 20 minutes. Skewer
the marinated chunks and cook under the broiler or on the grill.

Blackened Catfish
The recipe for this blackening seasoning can be made hotter by adding more pepper. You
can make a large amount of seasoning and store it in a tightly covered jar. Just about any
fish takes to blackening. I’ve reeled in a catfish by his whiskers here for you to blacken
and enjoy. You can’t beat the flavor of this guy on a platter! I’ll never forget coming home
from work one day when we lived at the lake in Iowa. My daughter Katie had been on
the dock fishing and had caught a huge catfish that was so big she couldn’t get it off the
hook by herself. So there it was in the bathtub — Katie had cut her line, taken it in the
house, and plopped it in the tub to keep him fresh. Supper was great that night!

low bowl.
2 Preheat a heavy skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium high heat until it’s hot but not
smoking. Melt the butter and add the oil. The skillet should be hot before adding the fish.
3 Dredge both sides of each piece of fish in seasoning mixture.
4 Drop the fish into the skillet and cook for 2 minutes on each side. The fish will be firm
and opaque. Catfish is done when it just starts to flake.

Sailing Around with Shellfish
Holy mackerel, I almost forgot about the shellfish. Some shellfish are a bit
higher in carbs than all the fishes in the sea. Scallops, oysters, and clams are
on the higher end of the spectrum. But if you’re a shrimp and crab lover,
you’ll be delighted to know they hold down the low end when it comes to
carb counts (see the “Calculating Carb Counts of Your Catch” section earlier
in this chapter).
Just take a quick gander at the carb counts and make the shellfish with lower
carb counts part of your low-carb healthy lifestyle starting right now. Save
those with higher counts for special occasions because, despite the higher
carb counts, the health benefits are a positive trade-off, so you don’t have to
deny yourself these shellfish entirely. But don’t forget that how you prepare
any seafood also affects the carb count. Does it get any better? Eating fantas-
tic seafood can help you maintain your optimal weight and make you health-
ier at the same time.

Seafood stir by the seat of your pants
I sometimes make a delicious stir-fry with
shrimp, scallops, and calamari rings — all of
which are waiting for me in my freezer. I also
peek in the freezer and see what kinds of veg-
gies I have on hand. On any given day, they may
include broccoli; green string beans; maybe a
few wax beans; a combo of red, green; and
yellow peppers; edamame; skinny asparagus
spears; or a host of other great veggies. And I
always try to keep frozen garlic, parsley, and
basil on hand too. My skillet of choice is a very
old cast-iron skillet. I pour some olive oil in the
skillet and throw in some garlic, basil, and pars-
ley, giving it a quick stir. Then I add my frozen
veggies, stirring until everything is well mixed.
(A couple dashes of soy sauce enhance the fla-
vors even more.) I start with the veggies and
cook them a little bit to give them a head start
before I add the seafood because seafood
cooks very quickly. Cook this conglomeration
until the shrimp turns pink, the veggies are
crisp-tender, and the scallops and calamari are
cooked through. I actually make a skillet-full and
have it for a quick supper and put the rest in the
fridge. It’s great cold the next day for lunch, or
you can pop it in the microwave. And one of my
favorite ways to eat it is wrapped up in a low-
carb tortilla! Cook this once and eat it two or
three times!

Shrimp Scampi
Shrimp Scampi is a simple recipe, but it’s always a favorite. Seafood can make your
everyday low-carb lifestyle feel like fine dining a couple times a week. You may want to
throw a tablecloth, some cloth napkins, and maybe even a couple candles on the table
for this one. But then again, it’s ready in minutes, so it’s also a candidate when you’re in
a rush to get out the door. This is delightful served over a bed of steamed zucchini or
squash strips.

Shrimp and Scallop Combo
Here’s a great combo of shrimp and scallops that weighs in at around 9 grams of carbs
per serving. A combination of shrimp and scallops with a rich and creamy sauce, this
dish is sure to become a one of your low-carb favorites when you’re in the mood for

3 tablespoons butter, divided
8 large tiger shrimp, peeled, deveined, and
cut into thirds
1 pound fresh scallops
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian
parsley, divided
1 cup dry white wine
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons flour
11⁄4 cups light cream, heated

2 Remove the seafood from the pan and place it in a medium bowl. Set the seafood aside.
Strain the liquid into another bowl and set the liquid aside.
3 Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the saucepan over medium-low heat. When
the butter is hot, quickly stir in the flour and whisk until well blended. Cook for only
1 minute over reduced heat.
4 Slowly add the strained poaching liquid into the flour mixture, stirring constantly.
5 Add the cream and the rest of the parsley, mixing all ingredients well. Over very low
heat, cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Preheat the broiler while you finish cooking the sauce.
6 Stir in half of the Gruyère cheese and all of the nutmeg into the sauce. Cook over low
heat for 2 more minutes.
7 Place the seafood in the sauce and stir well. Remove from the heat.
8 Spoon the seafood mixture into individual ovenproof serving dishes. Sprinkle with the
remaining cheese. Broil in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes, just until the cheese is melted.
Watch carefully so the cheese doesn’t brown or burn.

he pause in the daily toil is known as the
dinner hour. Hour you say — who has time
for a whole hour for dinner? I understand. Your
healthy low-carb lifestyle advocates that you eat a
great dinner. You’re tired and hungry after a long
day, and the dinner temptations are more abundant than you can shake a
proverbial resolution at. Have no fear — it’s chicken to the rescue.
You think chicken is boring? Only if you want it to be. Don’t let your chicken
fall into ho-hum boredom. Preparing chicken that works with your low-carb
lifestyle can be a very tasty and satisfying adventure. Dressing chicken up
with spices, squeezes of fresh lemon and lime, sugar-free preserves, mari-

your low-carb life. You can create a family dish that’s cozy and wholesome, or
you can dress your chicken to the nines with all kinds of delicacies in an elab-
orate gourmet dish. Experimenting with a food that’s so low in carbs is great,
and what’s even better is that you can usually find chicken on sale.

The Skinny on Chicken
Chicken has quite an impressive résumé. For starters, chicken has almost zero
carbs. But the low-carb angle is just the beginning of the nutritional benefits.
Chicken provides a generous helping of protein (which provides energy), iron,
B vitamins, phosphorous, and calcium, and without the skin, chicken is skinny
on fat, calories, and cholesterol too!
In the scheme of simple economics, chicken gives your budget a break when
you compare it with other meats. And if you really want to save some dough,
buy whole fryers on sale and learn how to cut them up, which I conveniently
cover in the “Wholly Chicken” section later in the chapter if you don’t already
have it mastered.
If you’re looking for variety in your overall low-carb diet, chicken is a great
place to start. Chicken gets rave reviews in versatility: You can bake it, poach
it, grill it, broil it, roast it, and microwave it, just for starters (see the “Fixin’
Chicken: Let Me Count the Ways” section later in the chapter). Plus, a pot-
pourri of herbs and spices can change the looks of a chicken and enhance
the flavor in many different directions. All you need is a sense of culinary
adventure.
Practicing Safe Chicken
Be safe with chicken rather than sorry, and handle raw chicken accordingly.
Research shows that properly handling chicken prevents food-borne illness
from salmonella and other bacteria associated with undercooked or raw
chicken.
Practicing safe chicken begins at the grocery store or the meat market. Pay
attention to what you’re putting in your shopping cart. If chicken doesn’t look
fresh or looks like it has freezer burn, leave it alone. Be sure to check the sell-
by date on the package labels of the chicken before you purchase it. And don’t
go grocery shopping and leave chicken in the car while you make a few stops
and run a few errands. You’re asking for trouble — raw chicken needs to be
refrigerated immediately.
It’s a myth that keeping chicken moist when storing is best. In fact, it’s one
of the worst things you can do, because bacteria grow in moisture. You can
safely store chicken in the shrink-wrapped package that you purchase it in
for several days. Personally, I don’t keep chicken in the fridge more than two
days after buying it before using it or freezing it.

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

Handling with care
Obeying the rules of the chicken road is relatively simple. The following list
contains the basics for keeping you and yours safe when handling, cooking,
and serving chicken. I hope that I pop into your head if you start to take a
short cut next time you’re barbecuing chicken — I’ll be there smiling at you
saying, “I don’t think so.”
 Before preparing any chicken, always rinse it under cold water, and then
pat it dry with paper towels. If you’re roasting a whole chicken, patting
the inside cavity of the chicken with paper towels is also important.
 After handling raw chicken, wash your hands, sink, countertops, and any
utensils you’ve used in the process with hot, soapy water.
 Don’t let raw meat or its juices touch other food. So don’t lay your raw
corn on the cob next to your raw chicken. And don’t place raw chicken
directly on your countertop to avoid leaving lingering bacteria that
could contaminate other foods.
 Always marinate chicken in the refrigerator, not outside on the counter-
top or picnic table. Marinating chicken at room temperature isn’t safe.
It’s also wise to place the marinating chicken on the lower shelf of your
fridge just in case it leaks. If you’re marinating in plastic bags, then do
yourself a favor and place the marinating bags in a large glass dish.
You’ll prevent some sticky cleanups.
 Never use a platter you had the raw chicken on as a serving platter.
Either wash the platter in hot, sudsy water, and then use it, or get out
another serving dish. If you’re a grill master, avoid using the pans you
took the chicken to the grill in until they’re washed thoroughly.
 Wooden cutting boards and chicken are a no no. They harbor bacteria
and can cause you some very unpleasant problems. If you’ve used a
wooden cutting board, use a bleach solution to clean it. Best-case sce-
nario: Toss the wooden cutting board, and buy yourself a new plastic
one that cleans up in a jiffy. I use a dedicated cutting board for chicken.
If you purchase frozen chicken, the ideal way to thaw it is to place it in the
refrigerator and thaw it gradually. Never thaw chicken at room temperature. To
speed up the thaw if you’re in a hurry, you can run cold water over the chicken.
Don’t refreeze cooked chicken that has thawed or raw chicken that has been
previously frozen.

Chapter 10: Stickin’ with Chicken in Your Low-Carb Lifestyle

Turning up the heat
Always cook chicken thoroughly. Heat destroys bacteria. Do a chicken check,
and pierce the chicken with a fork. The juices of the chicken are clear when the
chicken is done. There isn’t even a hint of pink in the juice of done chicken.
And when testing a whole chicken for doneness, the leg should move freely
when twisted or lifted. But, no bones about it, the best way to tell if your
chicken is done is to take its temperature with your trusty meat thermometer.
Actually, bones do come into play:
 If you’re cooking chicken with bones, the internal temperature should
register at 180 degrees for it to be done. When taking the bird’s tempera-
ture for doneness, insert a meat thermometer at the thickest part of the
thigh taking care not to hit a bone.
 Boneless parts should be cooked to an internal temperature of
170 degrees.
Be sure to check for doneness, even when you’ve set the timer according to a
recipes stated cook time. All ovens and stoves aren’t created equal, and cook-
ing on medium may mean something entirely different to you than it does to
Mary Jane. The size of a whole chicken or even a chicken breast can vary a
lot as well. And, if you’re cooking both white meat and dark meat pieces in a
baking dish or on the barbie, be sure to test both the dark meat and the white
meat pieces with your thermometer, because the dark meat takes longer to
cook.
Wholly Chicken!
When working with any whole chicken, remove the giblets from the cavity of
the chicken. If you want to keep the giblets for later use, either refrigerate or
freeze them immediately. Remove any loose fat on the chicken and discard it.
After rinsing the chicken thoroughly, pat it dry with paper towels. If you’d like
to freshen the skin of the chicken if it’s a bit dry, rub it inside and out with
fresh lemon. Be sure to season the cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper.
Cutting up a whole chicken
Cutting up a chicken is a great technique to master and add to your kitchen
tricks. You’ll be pleasantly surprised at the dollars you’ll save in your food
budget by buying whole fryers rather than chicken parts. Cutting up a whole
chicken is a bit intimidating but is by no means difficult. The first step is to
understand that you’re in charge, not the chicken. Check out Figure 10-1,
which outlines the process in a few simple steps.
154
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

Making a substitution
If you prefer the white meat of chicken and don’t care at all for the dark meat
or you prefer dark to white meat and a recipe calls for a cut-up frying chicken,
just do a little substitution of parts. Keep in mind that the number of servings
in the recipe doesn’t change, but the nutritional information may change. If
Figure 10-1:
How to cut
up a whole
chicken.
155
Chapter 10: Stickin’ with Chicken in Your Low-Carb Lifestyle

the recipe calls for a 21⁄2- pound to 3-pound frying chicken, the following parts
can be substituted:
 8 to 10 chicken wings
 8 to 10 chicken thighs
 8 to 10 chicken drumsticks
 4 to 5 whole chicken legs
 4 to 5 chicken breast halves with ribs
When you have a recipe for cubed chicken, and you don’t have a clue how
much chicken it equates to before it’s cubed, this info should help you:
 If you have a 21⁄2- to 3- pound fryer, the yield is 21⁄2 to 3 cups of cubed
chicken.
 Two whole boneless chicken breasts yield about 2 cups of cubed chicken.
Finger Lickin’ Low-Carb Good:
New Flavors in Chicken
Chicken is so susceptible to absorbing flavors that the sky is the limit with
chicken dishes packed with flavor. You can rub chicken with delightful dry
or wet rubs, leave it resting in marinade, or infuse whole chickens or your
favorite pieces of chicken with yummy flavors under their skin. A chicken
doesn’t care if it has its skin on or not when you’re doctoring it up with
scrumptious flavors, so the choice is yours. In the following sections, I cover
a couple of ways to transform chicken from another plain ol’ chicken dinner
to tasty low-carb stuff. Have some fun with chicken and experiment!
Rubbing chicken the right way
Savory rubs are a quick, easy way to add complex flavors to grilled chicken.
You can use rubs on chicken with or without skin. But only use the rub on
the skin if you plan to eat the skin; if you remove the skin after the chicken is
cooked, you’re going to lose the flavor. Decisions, decisions! Here are a couple
of rubs to get you started in the right rub direction:
 Dry rubs: These rubs can include dried herbs and spices, such as curry
powder, garlic powder, onion powder, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and
chili powder, which can be applied directly onto the skin or meat of the
156
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

chicken. There’s also a tomato powder on the market that’s pretty awe-
some for getting a touch of tomato flavor in a rub if you like. You can
prepare your favorite spice combinations in advance so your chicken
doesn’t have to wait for his rub down. I put my dry-rub mix in a large
shaker and shake it over the bird, instead of rubbing it in with my hands
or fingers — but hey, it’s your barbeque! You make the call.
 Wet rubs: You can magically transform a dry rub into a wet rub that’s
full of herbs and spices by just adding a little liquid such as any vinegar,
citrus juice, or wine that you enjoy cooking with. Wet rubs can also
begin with wet ingredients, such as various mustards or fresh garlic.
Some wet rubs end up like a paste, and you can spread them on with a
knife if you like. If you come up with more of a marinade than a rub by
adding quite a bit of liquid, it’s no problem: Just grab your basting brush
and go to town.
Marrying the chicken and the marinade
A marinade is a seasoned liquid containing an acid such as vinegar, wine, or
lemon juice, usually some oil, and herbs or spices. When you marinate chicken,
meat, or fish, you’re actually soaking it in the liquid, and the goal is to have the
food absorb the flavors before cooking. Sometimes, a marinade is also used as
a tenderizer for tougher cuts of meats.
Always use a non-metal shallow bowl for marinades. You can also use a heavy-
duty plastic self-sealing bag. Check out Figure 10-2 for a breakdown of good and
bad marinating equipment.
The flavorful liquids of marinade can contain very few carbs. Marinades add
big flavor to chicken, along with moisture. Be sure to mix your marinades in a
Figure 10-2:
Choose
one of the
good guys.
157
Chapter 10: Stickin’ with Chicken in Your Low-Carb Lifestyle

glass dish or bowl, because they don’t do well in metal. Here are a few exam-
ples of marinade inspiration to get your creative juices flowing:
 Minced garlic, fresh rosemary, fresh chopped thyme, grated orange peel
and lemon peel, lemon juice, and freshly ground black pepper
 Yogurt and freshly chopped mint
 Curry powder with garlic and yogurt
 Five-spice powder, chicken stock, soy sauce, freshly grated ginger, and a
touch of orange juice
An easy and quick marinade is a good quality Italian dressing and maybe
even Italian dressing with garlic and cheese. Just be sure to check the carb
counts and look for hidden sugars (see Chapter 3).
There are a lot of premixed marinades on the market, but I caution you to
turn to the label and check not only the carb counts but also the calories.
Plus, look for hidden sugars and MSG. Some of the prepackaged marinades
are laden with sugar, and your low-carb self will suffer the consequences.
After you mix your favorite marinade, add the chicken pieces of your choice,
and roll them about so they’re well coated. Refrigerate the pieces of chicken in
the marinade for an hour before cooking unless a recipe directs you otherwise
(some recipes call for short marinating times). Then just remove the pieces
from the dish, and broil them or pop them on the grill. You can also marinate
chicken (and meats) in large resealable plastic bags (see Figure 10-3). In fact,
taking this approach is even easier because you cut down on your cleaning
time. 
If you’re going to use sauce for basting and also serve it on the side of your
chicken dish, do it wisely. While basting chicken, you risk the possibility of
contaminating the sauce with microorganisms from the uncooked chicken.
Don’t take any chances. Simply separate your sauce in two bowls from the
Figure 10-3:
Marinating
made easy.
158
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

beginning. If you’ve prepared the sauce from scratch, be a little stingy and
start small with the sauce in the basting bowl. If you have leftover marinade,
do yourself a favor and toss it because nasty bacteria can be lurking in it
from the raw chicken.
Grilled Ginger Chicken Strips
The fresh chopped ginger in this marinade gives these chicken strips a great flavor. You
can cook these strips on the grill outside, as I do here, but use a veggie grate or you
may lose them between the cracks. You can also use your electric indoor grill or a cast-
iron grill pan. They’re delicious when hot off the grill and also great for lunch the next
day. You may want to consider doubling or tripling this recipe so you’ll have leftovers.

4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
2 cloves garlic, minced fine
2 tablespoons peeled and chopped fresh
ginger
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1⁄4 cup fresh lemon juice 
1⁄2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (more if desired)
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1 Cut the chicken breasts in wide strips (see the tip in this section for easy chicken-breast
stripping). Preheat your barbecue grill to medium.
2 Combine the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, lemon juice, hot sauce, vinegar, olive oil, and
pepper in a jar with a tight fitting lid. Shake until well blended.
3 Place the chicken strips in a shallow dish, and pour part of the mixture over top (be
sure to save some for basting). Refrigerate for an hour.
4 Remove the chicken strips from the marinade, place them on the barbecue grill in a
veggie grate and cook for 6 to 8 minutes (depending on the size of the strips). Baste fre-
quently with the marinade while cooking, turning the chicken at least 3 times. Make sure
chicken strips are done by inserting a fork in one and checking that the juices run clear.

Want to thinly slice chicken into strips with a little control? Pop the chicken
in the freezer for about an hour or until it’s almost frozen. With a very sharp
knife, cut across the grain of the meat. This method is great if you want to
slice boneless chicken breast for stir-fry or other recipes.
Want pretty chickens? Well, glaze them. Set the chicken on the rack in the
roasting pan breast side up, and brush with a glaze. While the chicken is
roasting, brush with the glaze again. Your chicken will come out a shiny
golden brown. It’s the prettiest chicken you’ve ever seen.
Getting under a chicken’s skin
If you want to create an incredible low-carb chicken dish, getting under the
skin of a whole chicken, chicken breasts, or thighs is an easy way to infuse
chicken with subtle flavors. If you’re a garlic lover, you can get under the skin
of a chicken with as much garlic as you can handle for a garlic infusion. Fresh
herbs, such as rosemary, when placed under the chicken’s skin with some
butter, will also really wake up your taste buds, and the chicken just pulls in
the flavor. Follow these simple steps to flavor the chicken under the skin:
1. Rinse the chicken well with cold water, and pat it dry (inside and out).
Work on a counter top with a disposable or washable plastic cutting
board placed under the chicken.
2. Loosen the membrane on the breast, legs, and thighs of the chicken by
running your fingers carefully under the chicken’s skin to separate it
from the flesh. Be gentle so you don’t tear the skin off the bird — you’re
just lifting it up for access to add various ingredients.
3. Carefully place spoonfuls of delicious stuffing ingredients — cheese,
butter, herbs, or a combination of ingredients — under the skin. Placing
these spoonfuls will make your chicken look like it has a bad case of the
mumps because you’ll have little mounds sticking up.
4. Now you can rub the cheese, butter, or herbs with your hand to spread it
evenly. The idea here is to plop your mixture of choice under the skin and
then even it out, spreading the little mounds of ingredients as evenly
under the chicken’s skin as possible. This need not be perfectly smooth
as your goal is flavoring the chicken not a chef’s award for chicken of the
month.
5. The bird is headed for the roasting pan. When the chicken comes out of
the oven it will be a bit puffy looking from the stuffing and a beautiful
golden brown. I suggest that you serve on individual plates with compli-
mentary vegetables that are colorful and you have a beautiful and deli-
cious presentation. The result is a tender, moist chicken that’s packed
full of flavors. With each bite, you get a forkful of moist meat, fragrantly
spiced stuffing, and crispy skin.

Fat in the skin of the chicken doesn’t migrate into the meat of the chicken as
it cooks. If you like to cook chicken with the skin on to keep it moist, please
do. Your chicken will be more flavorful, moist, and tender. If you remove the
skin before you eat it, keep in mind that some of the seasoning as well as
some of the flavor disappears.
Cheese and Spinach–Stuffed Chicken
If you find that roasting a whole chicken is too time consuming or just too much fuss,
these fabulous stuffed breasts will likely prove more adaptable to your specific low-carb
lifestyle. This recipe allows you to enjoy the wonderful flavor infusion you get from
roasting a bird.

1⁄2 of a 10-ounce package of frozen spinach,
thawed and squeezed dry
2 tablespoons reduced-fat cream cheese,
softened
1⁄2 cup lowfat ricotta cheese
2 tablespoons minced scallion
1 egg white
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
Pinch of ground nutmeg
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
8 boned chicken breast halves (about
13⁄4 pounds)
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a medium bowl, combine the spinach, cream cheese,
ricotta cheese, scallion, egg white, lemon zest, pepper, nutmeg, and salt. Stir the mixture
until well blended.
2 Very carefully loosen the skin from the chicken with your fingers (see my tips in this
section on how to pull this off), being careful not to tear the skin completely away
from the meat of the bird. Spread 2 tablespoons of the mixture under the skin of each
breast half.
3 Place the chicken on a rack in a medium-sized baking pan. Bake the breasts for 40 min-
utes or until the chicken is done (a meat thermometer inserted into the chicken reads
180 degrees).
4 Remove the skin from the chicken before eating if you prefer.

Fixin’ Chicken: Let Me Count the Ways
In this section, I present the easiest and quickest ways for preparing chicken
so you can begin to fit the real versatility of chicken into your low-carb
lifestyle and not have to spend all day cooking. Get serious about cooking
chicken quickly. You’ll be glad you did. Here are some options for your next
chicken dinner:
 Oven-fried: This is a way to get a tasty and crispy crust on your chicken
without the fat from frying. You can also experiment with all kinds of
spices and herbs that work well for oven-fried chicken. There’s no need
to miss out on old-fashioned chicken when you can have something
more flavorful and carb conscious. You can have your low-carb oven-
fried chicken and your low-carb gravy too. For an oven-fried idea, check
out the Southern Fried Chicken recipe in the section in this chapter.
 Grilled: Grilling and chicken are close enough to a perfect combination.
The delicate flavor of chicken is enhanced when you cook it on the grill.
When you use marinades when grilling chicken, not only is additional
flavor infused into the chicken but the marinade also tenderizes the
chicken. Grilling doesn’t have to mean taking a trip outside, you can use
your handy dandy inside tabletop grill too. Try the Grilled Ginger
Chicken Strips recipe earlier in this chapter.
 Roasted: If you roast your chicken (and turkey too for that matter) try
turning them over — yep, roast them breast side down. Think about it:
When the breast is up and the bird is resting on its back, all of those
juices are flowing downward during the cooking process. Reverse the
process for more moistness and less escape of juices.
And here’s another tip: Begin roasting your chicken at a higher heat for
just a short period of time. This will make the skin crispy and seal the
juices in. I usually roast my bird for about 15 minutes at 450 degrees and
then reduce the oven heat to 375 degrees until it’s done. As always, the
times and temperatures vary according to the recipe that you’re prepar-
ing and the size of the bird you’re cooking. For a tasty roasted chicken
dish, try the Roast Chicken and Gravy recipe in this chapter.
Don’t rush your chicken off to the table when it has finished roasting. It
has had hot time in the oven, so let the poor bird rest for 10 to 15 minutes
before serving her up so the juices will settle in. Your roasted chicken
eating experience will be much tastier, and the meat will be moister. If you
let it rest breast-side down, gravity will do its job, and the juices will give
you more flavorful and moist white meat.
When you want a very fast and tasty meal, just poach your chicken breasts in
the microwave and top them with a low-carb sauce or something as simple as
162

lemon-pepper-herb spice. You’ll be surprised how chicken soaks up flavors in
a hurry. Just add a quick green side salad, and you have a better-than-average
low-carb meal in minutes.
Turning Back the Clock 
with Comfort Food
At one time, chicken was reserved for Sunday dinner. Oh, how times have
changed. One thing has not changed over the years, though, and that’s our
desire and need to be comforted by some of the food we eat. After living the
low-carb lifestyle for ten years now, there are times I just want to roll in
mashed potatoes. Well, at least have a bite of them. These food desires aren’t
out of the ordinary, which is why not depriving yourself of certain textures
and types of food — like comfort food — is so important in developing your
healthy low-carb lifestyle.
The recipes in this section may not be mashed potatoes, but there are some
awesome recipes that fill that comfort-food void and don’t take a ton of time
to prepare. The old-fashioned Midwest cook in me has worked hard to bring
you what I hope will be some good ol’ comfort food low-carb recipes. Not
only do you have a lot of variety with food in your healthy low-carb lifestyle,
but you also can discover ways to your old-fashioned favorites that are low in
carb counts.
A kitchen gadget that may just delight you is a vertical stainless-steel roaster.
If you stop by the grocery store and pay way too much for a freshly roasted
chicken, invest in one of these gadgets and make your own just like you’d
find in the deli. To use this great kitchen tool, simply slip the prepared
chicken over it with the neck end of the chicken up. Here’s the magic of the
gadget — as the steel heats up, the chicken actually cooks from within, and
the skin browns evenly on all sides. When you cook the bird in this manner,
all the fat drips into the roasting pan.
You can’t have fried chicken without breadcrumbs, and making your own
low-carb breads crumbs to use in my Southern Fried Chicken recipe is a
snap. Check out Figure 10-4 for a step-by-step how-to to having your low-carb
crumbs in a jiffy. Just use your favorite choice of low-carb bread and let it get
stale. I have a small pan in my oven that I pop bread in that’s past freshness,
and when I’m ready for breadcrumbs, it’s all dried out the natural way. If you
want to season the little darlings, just add dried herbs and spices like rose-
mary, thyme, parsley, basil, and so on.

1⁄2 cup plain low-carb breadcrumbs
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon celery salt
1⁄4 teaspoon celery seed
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
2 frying chickens (about 2 pounds each),

celery seed, and pepper in a large, self-sealing plastic bag. Shake to mix.
2 Place the chicken pieces side by side in a large glass baking dish with the legs and
thighs on the outside since dark meat takes longer to cook. Make sure you pack the
pieces in tightly, right up against one another.
3 Brush the chicken pieces with the melted butter to moisten and make a base for the
seasoned crumbs to stick to. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the chicken pieces.
4 Bake uncovered for about 50 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes or until crisp and a meat
thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 180 degrees.

T Cheese and Spinach Dumplings
Dumplings are comfort food that you may think have disappeared from your low-carb
lifestyle. But deprivation isn’t part of this lifestyle, so you have to find new ways to sat-
isfy your cravings without the carbs. I think these dumplings are bound to tickle your
taste buds. You can serve them with the chicken recipes in this chapter. Yes, chicken
and dumplings. Or add a salad on the side and you have a very quick and hearty meal.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 3 to 5 minutes
Yield: 16 1-dumpling servings
165
Chapter 10: Stickin’ with Chicken in Your Low-Carb Lifestyle
1 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed
1 cup lowfat ricotta cheese
1 egg
4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic salt with parsley flakes
2 teaspoons crushed dried rosemary
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon melted butter
6 tablespoons white whole-wheat flour (be
sure to use this type of flour to make this
recipe work)
1⁄4 cup flour for rolling the dumplings
1⁄2 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese
1 Squeeze thawed spinach in paper towels until almost all of the moisture is removed.
Measure the 1 cup of spinach after squeezing moisture out. Set aside.
2 In a medium saucepan, bring about 2 quarts of salted water to a boil.
3 In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and egg, mixing well. Add the spinach,
grated Parmesan cheese, garlic salt, rosemary, pepper, and melted butter combining
ingredients until well blended. Add the flour last and blend into the mixture evenly.
4 Place the 1⁄4 cup flour in a little mound on waxed paper.
5 Roll enough of the mixture in the palms of your hands until round and the size of a golf
ball. Roll each dumpling ball in the flour mound on the waxed paper and, if necessary,
sprinkle flour on top to hurry the process a little. Set each dumpling aside on the waxed
paper until all have been rolled and floured.
6 Drop the dumplings into the boiling water one at a time. Cook the dumplings for about
3 minutes (set your timer). As the dumplings begin to cook through, you’ll see them
rolling through the water.
7 Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon into a microwave-safe baking dish. (I place
my dumplings close together in a round serving bowl for presentation purposes.)
Sprinkle the freshly shredded Parmesan cheese over the top of the dumplings and
microwave on high for one minute until cheese is melted. Serve at once.
Variation: Cook the dumplings in chicken broth to give them a richer flavor.

Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄3 cup shredded carrots
1⁄4 cup chopped mushrooms
1⁄4 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup light cream
1 cup water
1 teaspoon chicken-flavored bouillon granules
1⁄2 cup yellow cornmeal
3 eggs, separated
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups cooked and chopped chicken breast
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian
parsley
1⁄2 cup shredded mild cheddar cheese
1 Coat a large, heavy skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Heat the skillet over medium
high heat. Add the carrots, mushrooms, and onion, and sauté until the mushrooms are
just tender, about 3 to 5 minutes depending on the mushrooms you choose. Set aside.
2 Preheat the oven at 350 degrees. Combine the cream, water, and bouillon in a large
saucepan and cook over medium heat until it begins to boil. Stir in the cornmeal, reduce
the heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove from heat.
3 Beat the egg yolks with a hand mixer until they’re light and lemon colored. Stir the
baking powder, salt, and pepper into the egg yolks.
4 In a large bowl, combine the sautéed vegetables, cornmeal mixture, egg yolk mixture,
chicken, and parsley, stirring until well blended.
5 In a clean bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until they’re stiff, and fold them
into the chicken mixture. Spoon the mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish that has been
sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.
6 Bake for 40 minutes, uncovered. Sprinkle with cheese and bake for about 4 more min-
utes or until the cheese melts.

Roast Chicken and Gravy
Yep, I said gravy. Are you hungry yet? Well, I told you I’m an old-fashioned cook gone
low-carb. This Roast Chicken and Gravy will remind you of old times gone by. Served
with old-fashioned sides of veggies (see the recipes in the Chapter 12), this meal will
delight you — and your guests.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: About 2 hours
Yield: 6 servings
167
Chapter 10: Stickin’ with Chicken in Your Low-Carb Lifestyle
1 roasting chicken, 3 to 4 pounds
1 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons melted butter
3 cups chicken stock, divided
3 tablespoons whole-wheat pastry flour
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Season the chicken both inside and out with salt and
pepper. Brush the entire chicken with butter.
2 Place the chicken on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, breast side up. Pour 1 cup chicken
broth in the bottom of the roasting pan. Roast, uncovered for about 30 minutes.
3 Baste the chicken with pan drippings and broth in the roasting pan. Reduce the oven
temperature to 350 degrees, and roast for an additional hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes,
depending on your oven and the size of your chicken. Continue to baste the chicken
every 20 minutes or so with the drippings and broth in the roasting pan. Test the chicken
for doneness with your meat thermometer, which should read 180 degrees with the ther-
mometer placed in the fleshiest part of the thigh of the chicken.
4 When done, place the chicken on a serving platter, and let it rest while you make the
gravy. Keep the bird nice and warm by making a loose tent of heavy aluminum foil and
placing it over the chicken to hold in the heat.
5 Skim the fat from the roasting pan. Add 1⁄2 cup chicken broth to the drippings and stir
over a hot burner to loosen the browned bits in the roasting pan. This only takes about
1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a heavy skillet.
6 Blend the flour into 1⁄4 cup chicken broth in a small container using a fork to stir and blend
well. Make sure there are no lumps. Slowly pour the mixture into the skillet with drippings,
and place the skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk.
7 Gradually add the remaining 11⁄4 cups of chicken broth, continuing to cook and stirring
constantly until the mixture comes to a boil and begins to thicken. This will take only
about 3 to 4 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.

Introducing a Little Uptown Flair
Dress rehearsal is over, and now you’re going to cook chicken like they do
uptown. This little ditty (or section) shows you how you can easily turn
chicken into an elegant presentation. This dish has been known to make just
another day an occasion.
Orange Chicken Veronique
Veronique? Not to worry — it just means to garnish with grapes. This easy chicken dish
is also elegant (see what it looks like in the color section of the book). So when you’re
expecting guests, this recipe is a surefire hit. 
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 to 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
1 tablespoon light olive oil or vegetable oil
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1⁄2 cup orange juice (preferably low-carb)
1⁄2 cup dry white wine
2 packets Splenda sugar substitute
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon white pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon dried marjoram leaves
1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1
tablespoon water
1⁄2 cup halved seedless green grapes
1⁄2 cup halved seedless red grapes
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
6 very thin orange slices for garnish (optional)
1 Place a 12-inch nonstick skillet on medium high heat and add the oil. Add the chicken,
and brown on both sides, cooking for about 5 to 6 minutes only. Remove the chicken
from the skillet. Drain the excess oil from the skillet, and wipe the skillet with a paper
towel. Place the chicken back in the skillet.
2 Add the orange juice, white wine, Splenda, salt, pepper, and marjoram leaves to the skil-
let. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 12 to 15 minutes. Be sure the juices
from the chicken are running clear, not pink. Remove the chicken from the skillet, and
place on a warmed serving platter. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.
3 Dissolve the cornstarch in the tablespoon of water. (I like to do this by using a small jar
and combining the cornstarch with the water and shaking it up instead of trying to stir
the lumps out.) Stir the thickening mixture into the orange and wine mixture in the skil-
let, stirring constantly. Add the grapes and orange peel.
4 Cook for only 2 to 3 minutes until the sauce is slightly thickened and translucent. Spoon
over chicken and serve immediately. Garnish with orange slices, if desired.

Chicken and Zucchini in Dijon Sauce
Talk about quick, easy, and yummy. This is a great low-carb staple that you can add to
your list of go-to recipes, while the Dijon sauce gives it a bit of an out-of-the-ordinary
flair. The best part: It works well with whatever veggies you have on hand. I call for low-
fat yogurt to serve as the base of the sauce here. You can use low-carb yogurt if you
choose. Just check the carb and calorie counts on any yogurt you select. Don’t be
fooled; read those labels (see Chapter 3).
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
169
Chapter 10: Stickin’ with Chicken in Your Low-Carb Lifestyle
1⁄2 cup plain lowfat yogurt
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed dried tarragon
Nonstick cooking spray
1 medium carrot, cut in very thin strips
1 garlic clove, minced fine
2 medium zucchinis cut into thin strips
1 tablespoon olive oil
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts,
cut into bite-size pieces
1 In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mustard, and tarragon. Set aside.
2 Spray a large heavy skillet (or wok) with nonstick cooking spray. Heat the skillet over
medium heat. Stir-fry the carrot and garlic for one minute.
3 Add the zucchini, and stir-fry for about 3 minutes or until the veggies are crisp-tender.
Remove the contents from the skillet and set aside.
4 Add the olive oil to the skillet, and stir-fry the chicken for 5 to 7 minutes until the pieces
are no longer pink.
5 Return the veggies to the skillet, and add the yogurt mixture. Toss to coat all the ingre-
dients with the sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute or until all the ingredients
are thoroughly heated.
Variation: Don’t limit yourself to this great basic recipe for a very quick and tasty meal. If
you have broccoli in the refrigerator, go ahead and add it. If you have sugar snap peas, be
my guest. Some other tasty veggies that make a lovely presentation with the cream sauce
are red, yellow, and green bell pepper strips (you can buy them precut in the frozen sec-
tion), fresh mushrooms, chopped broccoli florets, and asparagus spears. Just keep in mind
that your choices of veggies will vary the carb count somewhat.
Tip: Sometimes I take a recipe like this and just keep adding a variety of veggies that I love
and/or have on hand in the freezer. Double the sauce portion of the recipe and you have a
great lunch to take to work the next day or to nosh at home.

n this chapter, I get right to the heart of the
matter — great recipes for beef, pork, and
lamb. Along the way, I provide you with pointers
on selecting lean cuts of meat and using the best
cooking techniques to make sure your meal comes
out just right, regardless of the cut of meat you’re
preparing. So, grab your wallet — it’s off to the
butcher with you!
Bringing Lean Meats to the Table
Some low-carb diets — notice I referenced “diets” and not “lifestyle” — call
for lots of meat and as much fat as you care to gobble up. In my opinion, this
approach is one of the myths of the low-carb diet, because diets high in satu-
rated fats can contribute to heart disease.
What’s the real beef about meat and the low-carb lifestyle? Healthy lifestyles
are all about moderation, not deprivation. And the fact is that meat is a
source of a number of essential nutrients. So, in this section, I discuss the
essential nutrients found in meat, provide some insight on watching fats and
calories, and give you some suggestions on choosing lean cuts of meat.
The essentials: Protein
Feeling full and satisfied is important to the success of the healthy low-carb
lifestyle that you’ve chosen, and protein fills the bill. Protein fills you up very

quickly and helps stave off hunger. It’s a star in producing a slower and stead-
ier increase in blood glucose levels (go to Chapter 2 for an extensive discus-
sion on glycemic index and glycemic load).
Protein is an essential nutrient that your body needs. Protein helps fight dis-
ease and is essential to your metabolism. Your internal organs, skin, nerves,
muscles, tendons, bones, brain, hair, and nails are largely made up of fibrous
proteins. And guess what? You need protein to replace the tissue in your
body that continuously breaks down.
The great thing about meat is that it’s a complete protein food, meaning it sup-
plies each of the amino acids (think of these as protein building blocks) that
your body can’t make on its own. Other foods are incomplete sources of pro-
tein. When you eat these foods, you need to combine them in ways that
ensure you’re getting all the amino acids you need. So including some lean
meat in your low-carb lifestyle is about eating complete protein foods — foods
that are protein-efficient, supplying not just some of the essential amino acids
but all of them. 
I’m not telling you to eat meat three times a day, so please don’t think that
this is an eat-a-lot-of-meat section. I’m simply providing you with the upside
of the nutrition and protein-efficiency lean meats can provide. If you don’t get
protein from eating meats, then you simply need to substitute other protein-
rich foods such as eggs, dried beans, and soy foods in combinations that
ensure you’re getting all the amino acids you need. 
Everything in moderation: Fats
As you approach your favorite meat counter, keep in mind that consuming
some fat is an essential component to any diet:
 Fats not only add to the flavor of your food, but they also give you a full
feeling and a quick energy source. 
 Fats provide your body with protective cushions for vital organs and
supply the fatty acids for many chemical processes that regulate the
passage of nutrients in and out of cells. 
 Fats also transport and aid in your body’s absorption of fat-soluble vita-
mins A, D, E, and K. 
But, as you can read in Chapter 2, you need to think about consuming more
healthy unsaturated fats and less artery-clogging saturated and trans fats. 
When it comes to making choices about which meats to choose, go for lean
cuts of meat. If you opt for a healthy low-carb lifestyle, your focus is about
the right balance for your body and what works for you. I’ll simply state that
172
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

moderation and balance are always the keys to anything in life. Just as I don’t
feel the all-the-meat-you-can-eat approach to low-carb dieting represents a
healthy nutritional balance, I don’t think deprivation is necessarily the
answer either. 
Lean cuts of meat are another very tasty, healthy alternative for your low-
carb lifestyle. They’re rich in B vitamins, zinc, and iron, and they add variety
to your low-carb lifestyle. Just don’t forget about the importance of fish,
seafood, and poultry as well. (See Chapter 9 for more about fish, Chapter 10
for all your poultry needs, and either chapter for bunches of great recipes.)
Calories still count. Whether you consume excess calories from carbohy-
drates, fat, or protein, the body converts the excess calories to fat storage
in your body.
Cutting up
When you’re scoping out which cuts of meats to buy, look for meat that doesn’t
have big chunks of fat and heavy marbling. Marbling is the intermingling of fat
within the meat. Beef is the most popular meat among Americans, with pork
coming in second, followed by lamb. Table 11-1 lists the three most popular
meats and provides you with some suggestions for cuts that are the least fatty.
Table 11-1
Least Fatty Cuts for Three Popular Meats

Pork
Lamb
Tenderloin
Pork loin
Loin chops

Tenderloin
Whole leg
Top loin

Because you’re selecting less fatty meats, keep in mind that the cooking time
speeds up and leaner cuts of meats tend to dry out more quickly in the cook-
ing process. You only need to experiment preparing lean meats a couple
times to master it.

Steaking Out a Low-Carb Favorite
Beef is perceived as being high in saturated fats, but if you choose lean cuts
and trim them of all visible fat, you can remove almost all of the saturated fat.
Just trim it off with a very sharp knife before cooking (see Figure 11-1).

Sampling a Wide Range of 
Recipes and Techniques
Meats are a valuable part of a healthy low-carb lifestyle. In choosing lean cuts
of meat, you may want to complement the meat with more herbs and spices,
because the lack of fat takes away some of the flavor of the finished dish.
Because you’re going to trim excess fat, less cooking time is required. Keep
your meat thermometer handy so your meats aren’t undercooked. But by the
same token, you don’t want them overcooked, because they’ll be dry and
stringy. Most recipes tell you the minimum degree of doneness to test for.
Do yourself a favor, and invest in a meat thermometer if you don’t have one. To
test for doneness of beef and lamb, insert the thermometer in the thickest part
of the meat, being sure not to hit the bone. Current guidelines from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture advise to cook meat to at least 145 degrees to kill all
bacteria. Here are the basics of temperatures for doneness from the USDA:
 Medium rare: 145 degrees
 Medium: 160 degrees
 Well done: 170 degrees
Cook your pork and ground meat to a reading of at least 160 degrees to
assure that it’s done. For more information on preparing and storing meats
and other foods safely, go the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety
and Inspection Service Website at www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets.

There are no hard and fast rules for cooking meat, because each cut lends
itself to a variety of preparations. In following your healthy low-carb lifestyle,
roasting, broiling, and grilling are the preferred ways to prepare meat. But
don’t forget about using your slow cooker (see Chapter 16) and stir-frying.
You can tenderize and add flavor to any meat by marinating it in a store-
bought Italian dressing or homemade vinaigrette. If you have the time,
London broil, tri-tip, and round steak are especially good when marinated
overnight (see the “Marinating meats” sidebar for more information).

Slow cooking
A slow cooker is a great way to cook a roast and have dinner ready when
you come through the door after a long day. You can use less expensive and
slightly tougher cuts of meat for cooking in the slow cooker. Because of the
long cooking time and the way the slow cooker works, the meat tenderizes as
it cooks (see Chapter 16 for more info on low-carb slow cooking and some
fabulous recipes).
Roasting
Oven roasting is a traditional way of preparing meat — usually roasts or large
pieces of meat. Slow oven roasting is done over a longer period of time and at
a lower oven temperature, with the result being tender and juicy meat. If the
roast has the bone in it, it cooks faster, because the bone actually acts as a
heat conductor. Some cooks choose roasts with bone because they believe
the end result is better flavor than boneless roast.
Rolled and boned roasts should be set on a rack for roasting. Don’t cover the
roast, and don’t add water, because the meat will steam rather than roast.
After you remove your roast from the oven, let it rest for about 15 minutes
(set it on the countertop in the pan) unless the recipe specifically states oth-
erwise. The meat actually continues to cook, and its juices settle into the
meat, making it easier to carve and juicier.
177
Chapter 11: Visiting the Meat Counter
Marinating meats
Marinating is covered extensively in Chapter 10.
But there are some specifics to marinating
meats that I’d like to give you to tuck in your
chef hat. So fire up the grill!
 Marinades make a world of difference to
less tender cuts of meat such as London
broil, flank steaks, and sirloin tips.
Vinaigrettes, lemon juice, and wine, which
are all acidic ingredients, tend to increase
the juiciness of meats as well as tenderize.
 Always place meats that you’re marinating
in the refrigerator. A minimum of 4 hours is
usually a good rule of thumb for marinating,
and overnight is great. This is personal pref-
erence and if you want to marinate your
meat for an hour and throw it on the grill
then, hey, it’s your choice. I personally like
for the meat to really soak up those mari-
nade flavors so I plan ahead and go for the
longer marinade time.

Apricot-Glazed Pork Roast
This entrée will make you smile. The combination of the apricot preserves with the
Dijon mustard and the fresh rosemary fills the kitchen with a fabulous aroma while it’s
cooking. Plus, I think you’ll enjoy the distinctive flavor of the glaze. The juices should
run when you slice the roast, because the glaze holds them all inside. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: About 1 hour
Yield: 6 servings
178
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
1⁄2 cup sugar-free apricot preserves
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
Salt and pepper to taste
3-pound lean pork roast
1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line a shallow baking pan with foil to aid in clean up.
2 Microwave the sugar-free apricot preserves for about 45 seconds to 1 minute on high to
melt (depending on the microwave, you may have to heat for another 30 seconds).
3 In a small bowl, combine the melted preserves, mustard, rosemary, salt, and pepper.
Divide the glaze in half in two separate bowls. Brush half of the glaze on the roast. Set
the other half of the glaze aside.
4 Place the pork roast in the pan, and roast it in the oven for 1 hour or until the meat ther-
mometer registers between 150 and 155 degrees as it will continue to cook after you
remove it from the oven. Remove the meat from the oven, and cover with foil to keep it
warm. Let it stand for 15 minutes.
5 Slice the roast, and drizzle with the pan juices. Serve with the remaining glaze.

Broiling
Broiling is a great method for quickly cooking smaller cuts and more tender
cuts like chops and steaks. Spray the broiler rack on the broiler pan with non-
stick cooking spray to prevent the meat from sticking to the rack. Be sure to
preheat the broiler before starting to cook your meat. When you broil, it’s
important to only turn the meat one time to maintain the juices. If there’s a
band of thin fat around the pork chops or steaks after trimming, score the fat
at one-inch intervals so the chops won’t curl up on you.

Herb-Rubbed Pork Chops 
with Tomato-Arugula Salsa
If you prefer to cook these pork chops on the grill, be my guest. Whether they’re grilled
or broiled, be sure not to overcook them so the chops don’t become dry. Use your meat
thermometer for perfect doneness. See the color section for a serving suggestion.

Parmesan-Garlic Lamb 
Chops with Zucchini Relish
I use store-bought Parmesan-Garlic Italian dressing a lot for marinating and basting
meats — it’s almost magical. If you can’t find Parmesan-Garlic Italian dressing, your
favorite bottled Italian will work fine — just watch the carbs in all store-bought dress-
ings. It tenderizes and flavors all at the same time. If you’re an avid fan of garlic, add
fresh garlic to these chops for an even more intense flavor.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
1 red onion, peeled and sliced thin
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 zucchini, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
8 4-ounce lamb chops
3 tablespoons Parmesan-Garlic Italian
dressing (store-bought)
1 Preheat the broiler. To prepare the Zucchini Relish, cook the onion in the olive oil in a
small skillet over medium-high heat for 4 to 5 minutes until translucent.
2 Add the zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh rosemary, and salt. Cook for 5 minutes until
the zucchini is tender. Set the Zucchini Relish aside and keep warm.
3 Arrange the pork chops in a broiler pan, and baste them on both sides with the Italian
dressing. Broil for about 4 minutes per side for medium rare chops and about 5 minutes
per side for medium to medium-well chops, turning once.
4 Serve immediately with the Zucchini Relish on the side or on top of the chops.

If you use the broiler in your oven for broiling meat, place a slice of bread in
the drip pan. It soaks up the fat drippings and helps prevent a fire from flar-
ing in the oven.

Making pockets in meats, especially pork chops, is a yummy variation and
isn’t as difficult as it looks. When you’re at the meat counter, make sure to
select chops that are about 11⁄4 inches thick. With a sharp knife, cut from the
outside of the chop towards the bone. Cut almost to the bone, and you have
your pocket ready for stuffing.
Grilling
Grilling, in my estimation, is the best. And it isn’t just for summer any more —
it’s become a year round sport, even if you have to scrape the snow off the
barbie. Each individual has his or her specific ways of grilling, but here are a
couple of my tips for striving for perfection when grilling steaks and chops:
 Let the meat reach almost room temperature before grilling. It cooks
better.
 Don’t salt the meat before grilling; salt it after you’ve cooked it instead.
Salt pulls the juices out of the meat.
 If you use tongs instead of a fork for turning, you preserve more of the
meat juices.
 Make sure excess fat is trimmed to avoid flare-ups while grilling and to
keep the meat from curling during cooking.
 Be sure to test for just the right doneness to the individual’s liking (see
the “Sampling a Wide Range of Recipes and Techniques” text earlier in
the chapter).
Brush the grill with some olive oil before cooking your meat to prevent it
from sticking to the grill.
Stir-frying
Stir-frying is a very healthy low-carb way of cooking up a whole meal. You
can begin with thin pieces of meat and add your favorite vegetables. If you’re
especially hungry, grab a whole-wheat low-carb tortilla, and fill it with your
stir-fry mixture.

Beef and Asparagus Stir-Fry
This easy and quick recipe is sure to please. Use frozen asparagus if the fresh stuff isn’t
available — some of the frozen asparagus these days is actually a better grade than the
fresh. And make sure you don’t overcook the asparagus. You want it crisp-tender.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Refrigeration time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 6 to 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
182
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
10 ounces boneless beef tenderloin
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger root
2 garlic cloves, chopped fine
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon dark sesame oil
Zest from 1 orange
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons olive oil
24 fresh asparagus spears (a little over 
1 pound) cut diagonally into 2-inch pieces
1⁄4 cup thinly sliced scallions
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (see the
note that follows)
1 Cut the beef tenderloin into thin strips and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the
sherry, ginger root, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, and orange zest, mixing well.
2 Place the strips of tenderloin in a large plastic zipper bag. Pour the marinade over the
meat, and seal the bag. Refrigerate for 1 hour, turning 2 or 3 times to make sure all the
pieces are marinating.
3 Strain the marinade into a measuring cup, and add enough water to make 1⁄3 cup liquid.
Add the cornstarch, stirring to dissolve.
4 Use a wok if you have one, but if you don’t, a large, heavy skillet will do just fine. Add
the olive oil and the beef to the skillet, stir-frying for about 1 minute. Remove the beef
from the skillet with a slotted spoon, and set aside.
5 Reduce the heat, and add the asparagus pieces, stir-frying for only 2 to 3 minutes.
Return the reserved marinade and beef to the skillet, and cook on high, stirring con-
stantly for 2 minutes or until the sauce thickens and the beef is cooked through.
6 Sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds, and serve immediately.
Note: Toasting sesame seeds provides tremendous flavor, and it’s really simple to do. Just
heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Add the sesame seeds, and cook them for a few min-
utes, shaking the skillet occasionally. When the aroma becomes pronounced and the seeds
start to darken, remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the seeds to another container.

If you want to be able to very easily cut your meat thin for stir-frying, slice it
when it’s still slightly frozen. If your meat is fresh, pop it in the freezer for a
bit. Freezing the meat gives it more body and makes it easier to hold onto.
Make sure that the oil in your skillet or wok for your stir-fry is hot before you
add the meat. Stir-frying about 10 ounces of meat at one time is about the
load limit. If you’re going to make a bigger batch of stir-fry, then do it in two
stirrings. Another trick to stir-frying is to have all your ingredients ready
when you begin, because you don’t have a moment to go digging in the fridge
or the spice rack.
Cutting boards are an important part of meat preparation. Whatever type of
cutting board you choose, make sure to wash it with hot, soapy water imme-
diately after using it. Research has shown that using a light bleach solution
on your cutting boards from time to time is a good idea. If your cutting board
is dishwasher safe, by all means pop it in the dishwasher, but clean it before.
Making Ground Beef More Than a Burger
You can dress ground beef up so much that you may not even recognize it!
It’s very versatile for your low-carb lifestyle and I could write a whole cook-
book just on ground beef and its many guises. The basics are ground sirloin,
ground chuck, ground round, and just plain ol’ ground beef. The prices differ
from leanest to fattest with ground sirloin being the leanest and the most
expensive and ground beef having the highest fat content and being the least
expensive.
Ground beef shouldn’t be kept in the fridge for more than a couple of days.
If you’re not going to use it in that amount of time then pop it in the freezer.
Don’t refreeze ground beef after you’ve thawed it out. And don’t add season-
ings to your ground beef before freezing it as the flavors of the seasonings
can be affected by freezing.
Be sure to drain any excess fat from ground beef after browning. You can use
a wire mesh strainer to accomplish this or a metal colander. Don’t put the fat
drippings down your garbage disposal though — yikes!
When you’re making regular meatloaf, make several individual meat loaves
rather than one big one. They take less time to cook. You can bake them in
a shallow baking dish or even in muffin tins sprayed with nonstick cooking
spray. Keep in mind that individual meatloaves aren’t recommended for the
Roma Meat Loaf recipe.

Roma Meat Loaf
This is an old recipe I used to make when my kids were little. I’d prepare it the night
before and then pop it in the oven when I got home from work. Serve with some steamed
veggies and a side salad. You’ll be simply delighted when you slice this like a jellyroll and
the cheese oozes. It’s so yummy! You need low-carb breadcrumbs for this recipe, so check
out Chapter 10 for the scoop on how to make your own.
Preparation time: 20 minutes

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
2 pounds ground beef
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1⁄4 cup low-carb breadcrumbs
1⁄4 cup finely chopped yellow onion
1⁄4 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce (the lowest
carb count you can find)
1⁄2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 can (4 ounces) mushrooms
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 packet Splenda sugar substitute
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, eggs, bread-
crumbs, onion, oregano, salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Use 2 tablespoons of the tomato
sauce to further moisten the mixture.
2 Tear off a good-sized piece of waxed paper, and place it on the countertop. Place the
meat mixture in the middle of the waxed paper. Flatten the meat mixture into a 9-x-12-
inch rectangle (no, it doesn’t have to be perfect). Sprinkle with cheese and mushrooms.
3 Using the 12-inch side, roll as you would a jellyroll, and place it in a 9-x-5-inch baking
pan. Bake for 1 hour.
4 To prepare the sauce: Combine the can of tomato sauce (minus the 2 tablespoons),
garlic salt, Splenda, oregano, and parsley in a small saucepan.
5 Cook the ingredients over medium-low heat for 15 minutes before removing the meat
loaf from the oven.
6 Remove the meat loaf from the oven and drain. Pour the sauce over the meat and bake
for an additional 15 minutes.
7 Slice immediately before serving, and the cheese will deliciously ooze from the center
of the meatloaf.

Cheese-Stuffed Ground Round Patties
These stuffed patties are like an entrée with a surprise tucked inside. I’m a sucker for
melted and oozing cheese, and if you are too, then you’re going to love this recipe. You
may want to put a bib on and have the hose handy as these are delicious but a bit
messy in the eating department. The combination of the hot, oozing stuffed patty with
the crisp lettuce wakes up your taste buds. Just don’t wear your favorite shirt when you
eat these! If these cheese combinations aren’t your favorites, just change them. Check

bar in this chapter for an explanation of these disease-fighting substances
found in veggies and fruits). Every color in a veggie or fruit is associated with
a different phytochemical. The more colors in your daily veggie rainbow, the
more powerful the punch.

Focusing on antioxidants and photochemicals
One of the goals of your low-carb lifestyle is to
burn fat more quickly and more efficiently,
resulting in weight loss and weight mainte-
nance (see Chapter 2 for the details). Burning
fat in your body is referred to as your metabolic
burn. When you burn something, it causes oxi-
dation, a chemical process that in turn pro-
duces highly reactive compounds called free
radicals.
Free radical production is a normal part of life
as simple as breathing in oxygen. Your body’s
natural defense systems normally neutralize the
free radicals that develop. Unfortunately, it isn’t
quite this simple. Pollutants in the air of all kinds,
UV radiation, and other environmental assaults
and even excessive use of alcohol can be over-
powering factors decreasing the ability of your
body to neutralize these free radicals. As a
result, the free radicals run rampant, causing
damage to your body’s cell function and struc-
ture. This is serious damage that not only can
contribute to the aging process but leads
to serious illnesses such as heart disease
and cancer. The good news? Vegetables (and
fruits) can play a large role in combating these 
problems. Plant food is somewhat magical in
that it has the amazing ability to produce an
army of phytochemicals and antioxidants that
charge forth and neutralize the free radicals in
your body, keeping your body healthier and
helping to oust chronic disease.
Antioxidants are chemical substances that con-
vert the free radical to a harmless molecule.
There are thousands of antioxidants in fresh
vegetables, as well as phytochemicals.
Phytochemicals are plant chemicals that are
neither vitamins nor minerals, yet they are
health enhancers. The study of phytochemicals
is relatively new and one of the hot topics in the
health field. 
So, the simple solution to a very complex
process that’s taking place in your body 24/7 is
to eat plenty of fresh, multicolored vegetables
in a wide variety. And a relatively simple expla-
nation as to why people are much more vulner-
able to disease today is because these vital
defenses found only in a rich plant food diet
have been eliminated from our diets. And so,
veggies to the rescue!

T Oven-Roasted Vegetable Medley
You can substitute or switch around any of the vegetables in this recipe. I offer this
recipe as a method of preparing vegetables. When you’re deciding on your choices of
veggies, make the dish look like a rainbow medley. Not only do the colors make the dish
more attractive (check out this dish in the color section of the book), but the health
benefits are much greater as well. Experiment with some of your favorite herbs and
spices with this recipe. I added rosemary as an option, but I sprinkle rosemary into
just about anything I can. Serve this dish with a side of one of your new favorite veggie
sauces (see the “Veggies on the Side” section later in the chapter to discover these
delectable sauces). Happy and colorful roasting!

1 pound asparagus
1 medium summer squash
1 medium zucchini
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1 medium red bell pepper
1 medium red onion
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon dried rosemary (optional)
1 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Cut the asparagus, squash, zucchini, yellow bell
pepper, red bell pepper, and red onion into fairly uniform, bite-sized pieces.
2 Using a large roasting pan, toss the vegetables with the olive oil, salt, pepper, and rose-
mary, if desired, mixing and coating evenly.
3 Spread the veggies in the roasting pan in a single layer and roast for 30 minutes. Stir a
couple times during the roasting. Vegetables should brown lightly and be crisp-tender
(not limp).

Aim for a minimum of five to seven servings of veggies per day, some of which
should be raw snacks. When you eat veggies raw, the nutrient quotient stays
way up there because they’re fresh and raw — you haven’t cooked out any of
the nutrition. The fresher the better.
Disease fighting antioxidants and phytochemicals are found in all vegetables
and fruits. But the real stars of the vegetable world are the crucifers. The name
crucifer comes from the cross-shaped flowers these vegetables produce.
Crucifer vegetables include cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and dark, leafy
greens such as spinach. Although cabbage and broccoli are the best-known cru-
cifers, other members in the family include kale, collard greens, mustard greens,
rutabaga, kohlrabi, and turnips. (Check out Chapter 8 for more on greens.)

Add slivered or sliced almonds to asparagus and broccoli dishes for texture
and crunch. If you’re a walnut lover, add 1⁄2 cup walnut halves to a veggie
combo.
Introducing Variety: A Veggie
Buying Handbook
Preparation of tasty veggies takes little time and effort for spectacular results
(see the “Cooking Them Just Right” section later in the chapter), all it takes is
a little imagination and getting to know your veggies. If you’re not familiar
with certain veggies and find yourself cooking the same old vegetables the
same old way, step up to a new choice. I first introduce low-carb vegetables
in Chapter 3 with the other components of a low-carb shopping list. Here I
make trying new vegetables a bit easier by providing a few hints on how to
choose the pick of the crop. Some may be old friends of yours, and some may
be new to your neighborhood. So pick out some new veggie friends. 
 Artichokes: Select firm, compact artichokes that have no brown blem-
ishes. They should be fleshy with good green color and tightly closed
leaf scales. Cut them 1 inch from the top and cut the stem close to the
base. Remove the lower outer leaves that tend to be tough. Cut the
thorny tip from each leaf with kitchen scissors. Your artichokes are now
ready for a great new recipe experience.
 Asparagus: The greener the asparagus, the better. Stalks should be firm
with compact tips, and they shouldn’t be woody or flat or have blem-
ishes. When preparing asparagus, either break off the woody end of the
stalk or cut it at an angle.
 Avocados: You want your avocados to be plump and slightly firm yet
yield to gentle pressure. Most avocados are hard and not ripened when
they’re picked. Ripen them at room temperature in a paper bag on the
counter. Don’t pick bruised or shriveled avocados, because it’s an indi-
cation that they’re overripe.
 Bell peppers: Brightly colored with a shiny sheen means peppers are at
their peak. Red, green, orange, and yellow varieties of peppers should be
thick-fleshed and crisp. Avoid peppers that are wrinkled, shriveled, and
dull. Red, yellow, and orange peppers are sweeter than green peppers.
 Beets: Meet beets, the first cousins to spinach (yes, really). Look for
young beets with fresh green tops. Not only can you cook the beet root,
but you can also cook the tops, which are loaded with healthy nutrients.
 Broccoli: Pick broccoli with bright green stems and leaves and tightly
closed dark green florets. Try to avoid stems that are too thick, florets
that have begun to yellow, or leaves that are wilted.
190
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

 Cabbage: When I say cabbage, I’m talking about a whole family here. In
this cruciferous family, there are red heads and green heads, which should
be solid and firm. Brussels sprouts are in the cabbage family, too, and
their small heads should be tight and solid.
 Carrots: You want carrots that are well-shaped and smooth with bright
orange color. Don’t select carrots that have cracks or are flabby and
wilted. Small to medium carrots are more likely to be more tender and
sweeter. Don’t be fooled by carrots that are packaged in orange cello
bags, because they can be deceptive and look fresher and more orange
than they actually are.
 Cauliflower: Avoid bruises or brown spots on cauliflower. Pick compact
heads with white florets and green, crispy leaves. Store cauliflower in
the fridge wrapped in plastic wrap and wash just before cooking.
 Eggplant: Try to select firm eggplants that are small rather than large
because the smaller ones tend to be more tender. Check that the stems
and the little cape-like bracts are intact and green. If the bracts are
loose, the eggplant is likely older and may have begun to spoil, so pick
another one.
 Green beans: Buy young, crisp, bright green beans that snap. To prepare,
break off the ends and remove strings if necessary.
 Green onions (scallions): Choose green onions/scallions with small bulb
bottoms and fresh green tops. Avoid any with wilting leaves.
 Leeks: Try to choose leeks that are young, firm, and straight and have
bright green leaves. If the root end is enlarged, they may be tough and
not as sweet. Avoid leeks with yellow leaves.
 Mushrooms: Although mushrooms are technically in the fungi family, I
include them in this chapter because, while you’re in the produce sec-
tion buying veggies, you’ll buy mushrooms, too, not even considering
what family they belong to! Select mushrooms that are firm, plump, and
unblemished. Check out different mushrooms — from button to shiitake,
cremini to brown — for a different look, texture and taste. Don’t wash
before refrigerating because they’ll keep longer that way.
 Onions: Carefully select onions that are clean with dry and papery skins.
Make sure they feel firm and solid with no soft spots. Avoid onions that
are beginning to sprout.
 Parsnips: Look for smooth, firm, well-shaped parsnips. Stay away from
parsnips that are shriveled and soft or too large. Parsnips have good
nutritive value and are very tasty.
 Spinach: Look for crisp and very dark green leaves — the greener the
better. Purchased in its natural state, spinach is usually very sandy and
needs a lot of preparation in cleaning and removing the sand. I opt for
prewashed myself.
191
Chapter 12: Serving Up Veggies Galore

 Turnips: Shop for crisp, solid turnips. The turnip actually contains 92
percent water and no starch or sugar, but it has a pungent essential oil.
Turnips are very nutritious and can be very tasty when prepared using a
good recipe.
 Water chestnuts: These little wonders, usually bought in a can, aren’t
vegetables but are actually fruits of a water plant. I won’t hold this
against them, though. They add such wonderful crunch to veggie dishes
that we can invite them into the family in this chapter. Be sure to rinse
canned water chestnuts in cold water before using because doing so
makes them crisper and removes any of the tinny flavor resulting from
being canned.
 Zucchini: Buy small and medium, dark green zucchini. When you pick
them up, they should be heavy for their size and free from blemishes,
with thin, tender skin. Zucchini is a member of the summer squash
family that also includes yellow squash.
T No-Pasta Lasagna
Are you wondering what the heck lasagna is doing in the veggies chapter? Well, this
dish is made with eggplant. And this stuff is so good that you won’t even know the
pasta isn’t there! You have to try it to believe it. I call for 2 cups of tomato juice in this
recipe. Simply use the product with the lowest carb counts you can find.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 2 to 3 hours
Yield: 6 servings
192
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
1⁄2 cup Merlot
14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes
2 cups tomato juice
1 medium green pepper, chopped
1⁄2 medium yellow onion, chopped fine
5 black olives, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon pepper
21⁄2 cups cottage cheese
1⁄2 cup grated mozzarella cheese
2 eggs
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
1⁄2 cup green onion
2 to 3 medium zucchini
1 large eggplant
Sea salt to taste
1⁄4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (add
more if desired)
1 Combine the Merlot, diced tomatoes, tomato juice, green pepper, onion, olives, oregano,
basil, and pepper in a large saucepan. Let it simmer for 1 to 2 hours.
2 While the sauce is cooking and making the kitchen smell wonderful, make the cheese
filling. In a medium bowl, combine the cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese, eggs, parsley,
and green onion. Blend thoroughly with a large wooden spoon.

3 Peel the zucchini and the eggplant, and slice them lengthwise in thin strips to resemble
lasagna noodles. You may want to blot the strips with paper towels to remove any excess
moisture. Salt lightly to taste with sea salt (not iodized salt).
4 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees about 10 minutes before the sauce is done and you’re
ready to assemble the lasagna. Put a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a clear oven-
proof dish or a ceramic lasagna dish. Then, using the eggplant and the zucchini in place
of pasta, make a layer of the zucchini and eggplant, alternating them in the same layer.
Next, add a layer of cheese filling and then a layer of sauce. You know the rest of the
routine — repeat.
5 Sprinkle with the fresh Parmesan cheese and bake for 1 hour.

Cooking Them Just Right
Water is public enemy number one when it comes to retaining all the natural
nutrients in vegetables. So don’t plop your veggies in a pan of water and boil
the heck out of them until they’re pale in the face and look like they’re about
to faint. Cooked veggies are the most appetizing when they retain their origi-
nal bright color. That’s why the techniques I cover in this section — steaming
and blanching and stir-frying are the best ways to prepare veggies. My favorite
is steaming when I’m preparing them as an entrée or a side dish. If I’m prepar-
ing veggies to include in another dish, such as stuffed green peppers, then
blanching is what I like to do. Stir-frying veggies at my house is almost a daily
occurrence for one meal — it’s so quick and easy, and those fresh veggies are
so bright and colorful when they’re stir-fried. 
Likewise, when preparing vegetables for cooking, don’t soak them in water
because important vitamins and minerals dissolve in the soaking process.
Wash veggies quickly, and drain and cook them immediately.
If you frequent farmer’s markets to buy your vegetables, you may find that
these vegetables need a bit less cooking time than the ones you buy in the
grocery stores. The reason for this difference is because the store-bought
produce is older and has traveled a farther distance to get to you. Because
farmer’s market produce comes almost directly from the fields, you’ll find it
to be a tad more tender than the produce that’s been on a truck for several
days to get from the field to the produce department in your grocery store.
If you want your veggies to cook evenly, and you’re not cooking them whole,
cut them in uniform sizes.
193
Chapter 12: Serving Up Veggies Galore

Steaming and blanching
The most recommended way to cook vegetables is to steam them in a
steamer basket or in a microwave in a small amount of water until they’re
crisp-tender. Crisp-tender means cooking them just long enough to be a bit
soft but to maintain their crunch. Cooking veggies until they’re crisp-tender
helps to maintain their important nutrients, texture, and bright colors.
A steamer basket is just what the doctor ordered for steaming veggies, and
you can use it in about any size pan. This inexpensive little lifesaver is merely
an expandable fanlike device. The microwave works fine too for steaming,
and you can find plastic steamers for microwave use. You’ll find both types
of steamers in kitchen specialty stores, discount stores, and even the dollar
store from time to time. If you’re really into veggie steaming, there are some
great electric steamers with built-in timers.
T Bell Peppers Stuffed with Spinach
I love stuffed peppers, but most recipes include white rice. My colorful and tasty solu-
tion is to use spinach for the stuffing. This recipe calls for green, red, and yellow bell
peppers. I like to mix them up because they make a beautiful presentation, but you use
whichever color or colors you prefer. This recipe calls for low-carb breadcrumbs, so
check out Chapter 10 for tips on making your own. 
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 40 to 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
194
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
1 medium green bell pepper
1 medium red bell pepper
1 medium yellow bell pepper
8 cups water
10-ounce package of frozen spinach
1⁄2 cup finely chopped yellow onion
1⁄3 cup low-carb whole-wheat breadcrumbs
1 teaspoon dried basil
1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 Cut the peppers in half lengthwise and remove all the seeds.
2 Using a large stockpot, bring 8 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Add the peppers.
You’re blanching the peppers (just a quick plunge into boiling water), and you don’t
want them to lose their vibrant color, so about 3 or 4 minutes is sufficient.
3 After blanching the peppers, rinse them with cold water to stop them from cooking fur-
ther, and drain. Place the peppers side by side in a 10-inch square baking dish and set
aside.

4 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Following the directions on the package of spinach,
cook it, and then drain and press it against a colander with the back of a wooden spoon
to remove excess moisture.
5 In a small mixing bowl, combine the spinach, onion, breadcrumbs, basil, oregano, salt,
pepper, and garlic powder.
6 Stuff each pepper half with 1⁄6 of the mixture and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the dish
from the oven and sprinkle the tops of the peppers with the mozzarella cheese. Return
the dish to the oven, and continue baking for another 5 to 10 minutes or until the pep-
pers are hot through the center and the cheese is melted.

Sometimes, you just need to blanch veggies. Blanching is a cooking method in
which you plunge veggies into boiling water to firm the flesh and to heighten
and set color and flavor. You usually blanch when you’re going to continue
cooking the vegetables by baking or grilling them, such as when you’re
preparing stuffed bell peppers (see the recipe for Bell Peppers Stuffed with
Spinach in this chapter). Blanching is a very quick process — the veggies are
in and out!
As soon as your veggies are cooked to crisp-tender, put them in a colander to
drain and place them in a hot serving bowl. Don’t put cooked veggies back
into a hot pan to keep them warm, because they’ll continue to cook from the
heat retained in the pan and will wilt, lose their color, and lose their flavor.
Stir-frying veggies
Stir-frying is a great cooking method for vegetables. Stir-frying is quickly cook-
ing food in a hot skillet or wok over medium-high heat, stirring constantly,
using a small amount of oil. This quick cooking seals in moisture and allows
the food to retain much of its flavor, nutrients, color, and texture. You can stir
up a meal in minutes that’s totally low-carb.
To ensure even and quick cooking, prepare your vegetables in small, uniform
shapes. But different types of stir-fry-friendly veggies require different cook-
ing times. So just start your stir-fry with the slowest-cooking veggies, and add
your other choices as you go. Here’s a breakdown of some common stir-fry
195
Chapter 12: Serving Up Veggies Galore

ingredients, in order of longest cooking time (add these first) to shortest
(add these last):
 Cauliflower and carrots
 Broccoli, asparagus, and snow peas
 Red, yellow and green bell peppers
 Pea pods and edamame
 Long green string beans, wax beans
 Mushrooms and summer squash
 Coarsely shredded cabbage
 Water chestnuts
Finally, after all your veggies are in the skillet or wok, you can add fresh
herbs, soy sauces of various varieties, hoisin sauce, chili sauce, peanut
sauce, and oyster sauce.
Use a spatula or a long-handled spoon to gently lift and turn the veggies with
a folding motion so the food cooks evenly. The trick to stir-frying is to keep
the food moving at all times.
If you can’t serve your stir-fried veggies immediately, don’t cover them,
because the retention of heat creates a moist steam that softens the crisp tex-
ture of the veggies you just achieved by stir-frying. Not only does the crisp tex-
ture disappear, but the color also fades, and the veggies become limp and very
unattractive.
A great addition to any stir-fry is a bit of fresh gingerroot. Remember that a
little goes a long way. You can add gingerroot by grating it with a paring knife.
Gingerroot keeps forever in the freezer. You don’t have to defrost it to add it
to your stir-fry. You can peel it while it’s frozen and just scrape some off, grat-
ing the ginger into your stir-fry mix.
Vegetables for stir-frying are readily available in the frozen food section of
your grocery store. They are already precut and just begging for you to stir
fry ’em!

Bean bundles
If you want to impress guests with a simple side
dish, try this: Take 30 fresh green beans and cut
off each end squarely. Divide the beans into 6
groups (5 in each group), and tie each group
into a “bundle” of beans by using a fresh chive.
For extra pizzazz and a splash of color, place a
slice of red bell pepper under the tie of the
chive. Steam the bundles until they’re crisp-
tender. Squeeze fresh lemon over the bean
bundle as you’re serving your guests.
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon grated fresh gingerroot
1 tablespoon sugar-free maple syrup
Nonstick cooking spray
1 cup diagonally sliced green onions
6-ounce package frozen Chinese pea pods
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup fresh bean sprouts, rinsed well
1 cup bite-size sweet red bell pepper strips
1 Make the sauce first by combining the soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and maple syrup in a
small bowl. Set aside.
2 Spray a large, heavy skillet or wok with nonstick cooking spray. Heat the skillet over
medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add the green onions, stir-frying for 1 minute.
Add the cabbage and the Chinese pea pods, stir-frying for 2 minutes. Add the bean
sprouts and the red pepper, stir-frying for 1 more minute. All veggies should be crisp-
tender.
3 Pour the sauce over all the ingredients, toss to coat in the skillet, and heat thoroughly.

Veggies on the Side
There’s no need to invest hours in the kitchen, work from a recipe, and dirty
a couple hundred pots and pans when you want to whip up a quick carb-
friendly side dish. In this section, I share my favorite seasoning and sauce
secrets that will get a side on your table quickly with little fuss and muss.
Simply steam, blanch, or sauté your favorite veggie (see the “Steaming and
blanching” section earlier in the chapter), and then check out the following
suggestions. Plus, I throw in a few easy — and fabulous — recipes that are
great when you’re in the mood for something just a bit more involved.
Adding zip with seasonings and sauces
Most veggies perk right up when you quickly season them with simple ingre-
dients like fresh herbs, lemon juice, freshly ground pepper, or some nice sea
salt. Many veggies also take kindly to garlic butter. In the following list, I pre-
sent some all-time veggie favorites and some seasonings and sauces that
complement them nicely:
 Asparagus: Nutmeg, lemon peel, lemon pepper, basil, hollandaise sauce,
freshly grated Parmesan cheese, various vinaigrette dressings, herb but-
ters, lemon juice
 Broccoli: Oregano, marjoram, hollandaise sauces, garlic, herb butters,
freshly grated Parmesan cheese, vinaigrette dressings
 Brussels sprouts: Cheese sauces, mustard and mustard sauces, dill,
chestnuts, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, herb butters
 Carrots: Freshly grated ginger root, mint, nutmeg, tarragon, cinnamon,
chives, Italian parsley, dill, chervil, orange zest, lemon, herb sauces
 Cauliflower: Curry powder, cheese sauces, mustard sauces, freshly
grated Parmesan cheese, nutmeg, rosemary, basil, caraway seed, dill
weed, tarragon
 Summer squash: Oregano, marjoram, dill weed, nutmeg, ginger, allspice,
rosemary, lemon pepper, parsley, freshly grated Parmesan cheese
 Turnips: Thyme, yogurt, mace, nutmeg, white sauce variations, cheese
sauces, orange zest.

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

There are a ton of low-carb sauces that you can make quickly and have on
hand for quick and delicious cooked-veggie platters as an entrée or a side
dish. Veggies platters aren’t just for appetizers any more! If you get into
grilling veggies, these sauces are also great dips for the grilled veggies, or you
can make it easy and just pour the sauce all over them:
 Lemon-herb butter: Combine 1⁄2 cup soft butter, 1 tablespoon lemon
zest, 1⁄2 teaspoon dried basil, 1 teaspoon snipped fresh Italian parsley,
and 1⁄2 teaspoon snipped fresh chives.
 Quick and easy cheese sauce: Melt 1⁄2 pound cheddar cheese in a double
boiler; gradually stir in 1⁄2 cup light cream; add a dash of cayenne pepper.
 Chive-parsley sauce: Melt 1⁄4 cup butter and stir in 1 tablespoon minced
fresh chives and 1 tablespoon minced fresh Italian parsley.
 Mustard-horseradish dressing: Mix 1⁄4 cup mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons
Dijon mustard, and 2 teaspoons prepared horseradish.
 Dill sauce: Melt 1⁄2 cup butter and stir in 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill.
Give your veggies on the side a hint of meaty flavor when you serve them with
chops or roast by adding half of a chicken or beef bouillon cube to the cooking
water. You don’t need to salt them. Be sure not to overcook your veggies —
cook them till just tender-crisp.

Making mushrooms sing with Marsala
Here’s a quick suggestion that tastes great as a
side with that juicy steak you just cooked on the
grill. Using a large skillet, sauté 1 cup fresh sliced
mushrooms of your choice in 2 tablespoons
butter, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and 1 clove minced
fresh garlic. Add 2 tablespoons Marsala wine
and simmer for 10 minutes.

T Brussels Sprouts and 
Mushrooms with Rosemary
This great combination of Brussels sprouts and fresh mushrooms with the aroma and
flavor of fresh rosemary makes a delightful side dish that’s sure to please. I’m a big fan
of rosemary, and if you haven’t tried it in your cooking, you just have to. Not only does
rosemary wake up your taste buds, but it also makes the entire kitchen smell great. This
dish is high on the healthy side and very low on the carb side. Take a look at the end
result in the color section of the book.

2 cups small, fresh Brussels sprouts
3 tablespoons butter
1 crushed clove of garlic
2 teaspoons fresh rosemary
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 cup halved fresh mushrooms
5 fresh sprigs rosemary for garnish (optional)
1 In a medium saucepan, boil the Brussels sprouts in about an inch of water. Cook for
about 6 minutes — just until crisp-tender. Drain.
2 Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, rosemary, pepper,
and lemon peel.
3 Add the mushrooms and cook over medium heat just until the mushrooms are softened
(about 3 minutes). Stir in the Brussels sprouts and continue cooking only until thor-
oughly heated, about 2 to 3 minutes.
4 Garnish each serving with a sprig of fresh rosemary, if desired.
Tip! Store mushrooms in a brown paper bag in the refrigerator rather than in a plastic bag
or plastic container.
Variation: Add crisp, crumbled bacon or chopped toasted almonds.
Variation: Top the cooked Brussels sprouts and mushrooms with homemade tomato sauce
(see Chapter 17 for a great recipe) and grated cheese of your choice. Bake for 15 minutes
at 350 degrees.

T Creamy Whole Cauliflower
Our good friend the cauliflower is the star low-carb veggie that gets a bit of a presenta-

wows guests and families alike.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
201
Chapter 12: Serving Up Veggies Galore
1 small cauliflower head
2⁄3 cup lowfat sour cream
1⁄4 cup cream cheese, room temperature
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3 scallions, chopped fine
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Trim the outside green leaves from the cauliflower and wash well. Fill a large stockpot
with enough water to cover the cauliflower. Add salt to the water and bring to a boil.
2 When the water is boiling, put the cauliflower in and reduce to simmer. Simmer for
about 15 minutes or until crisp-tender (you don’t want soggy cauliflower).
3 Drain the cauliflower and place it in a warmed serving bowl (something pretty and col-
orful is nice). Keep the cauliflower warm by covering the bowl with foil.
4 Place the softened cream cheese and sour cream in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over
low heat. Stirring constantly, heat until the cream cheese is melted, about 3 or 4 min-
utes. Add the lemon juice, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste.
5 Spoon the sauce over the cauliflower and serve immediately.
Tip: Don’t overcook vegetables. Cook them the very shortest time possible and only until
crisp-tender. Watch them carefully, because it usually takes just a matter of minutes. They’ll
taste better, look better, and be better for you. The fresher the vegetables are, the better
they are for you.
Variation: Introduce a bit more flavor by adding some Dijon mustard in your sauce.

T
he word dessert doesn’t have to instantly intro-
duce thoughts of deprivation and sacrifice in
your low-carb healthy lifestyle! There are very cre-
ative and healthful ways to satisfy your sweet
tooth without experiencing the dreaded guilt that
comes with that last bite of a carb-laden dessert.
In this chapter, I provide you with tips on selecting
and preparing low-carb desserts. I introduce you
to one of my personal low-carb favorites, the
meringue, I take some of the guilt out of old-
fashioned favorites like cobbler and bread pud-
ding, and I help you indulge in your desire for the 
good stuff — chocolate.
Fitting desserts into your low-carb lifestyle can take some creativity. But in this
chapter, I take a lot of the guesswork out of the process. Now, I know all about
the infamous time factor in today’s lives. But if you can make mouthwatering
and delightful low-carb desserts at home — and many rather quickly — does
that get your attention? I thought so.
Satisfying Your Sweet Tooth
The secret to low-carb dessert success is replacing most of the refined sugars
in your sweet creations. With that slight of hand, desserts can be light on the
carbs but still sinfully sweet and delicious. You can have your low-carb cake

and eat it too! But keep one little thing in mind — variety, balance, and mod-
eration are the keys to success in all healthy lifestyles. 
 Choose your sweets wisely: Just because a dessert is lower in carbs
doesn’t mean eating a ton of the stuff is a healthy choice. Remember:
Calories count too. Also, beware of sugar alcohols because they can
cause weight loss to stall for some folks and also create bloaty and
uncomfortable tummies for others (see Chapter 2).
 Eat sweets as dessert after your meal: After a healthy, low-carb meal,
you’re no longer experiencing pangs of hunger, and you’ve consumed
tons of good-for-you nutrients. Therefore, the urge to throw caution and
moderation to the wind isn’t as strong. Try to avoid eating sweets as a
snack. I know this isn’t going to always happen when you’re having a
craving for something sweet. Just be selective when you give into those
cravings. (And check out Chapter 14 where I present all kinds of other
low-carb snacking options.)
 Drink tea or coffee with your sweets: I’ve found that drinking a cup of
hot tea or coffee when I want something sweet helps me not want so
much of the sweet food.
There are a gazillion low-carb sweet products, including prepackaged brown-
ies and cheesecakes, cookies, muffin mixes, candy bars, and ice cream out
there. Always read the labels on these sweets (see Chapter 3 for a label-
reading lesson). Sometimes these products are very high in calories and are
loaded with sugar alcohols and nasty additives. Just because it says low-carb
doesn’t make it friendly to a healthy lifestyle.
Sugar is more than sweet
Sugar can be a huge contributor to obesity, chronic diseases, everyday
weight gain, and a bunch of other maladies. Sugar is high in calories, and it
has absolutely no nutritional benefits. Those are the facts. But it’s also a fact
that most folks, including yours truly, enjoy the sweet stuff. But sugar also
does so much more than just sweeten and enhance the flavor in cooking.
Especially in baking, sugar performs a number of what I consider important
“mechanical” or “technical” functions:
 Under heat, sugar caramelizes, which makes your food a pretty golden
brown and makes it smell wonderful while it’s cooking and baking.
 Sugar makes your cookies and cakes tender, moist, light, and airy.
 Sugar produces structure in baked goodies by interacting with proteins
and starches during the baking process.
 Sugar provides nourishment to yeast and therefore speeds up the growth
of the yeast.
206
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

 Sugar acts as a preservative in jams and jellies.
 Sugar not only enhances the flavor of ice cream but also adds to the
smoothness and texture of ice cream.
 Sugar provides you with a mouth-feel that’s difficult to duplicate. Mouth-
feel is about the texture of food. With your low-carb lifestyle, you may
miss that certain crispness that you used to get from a potato chip or a
pickle, the chewiness of soft candies, or the fresh soft feel of cakes and
crunchiness of cookies. The texture or mouth-feel of the foods that are
baked with sugar is one that you may certainly miss — it’s what makes
certain foods (especially sweets) so appealing and satisfying.
White sugar isn’t included in a healthy low-carb lifestyle. As an old-fashioned
Midwest cook, I’m the first to admit that baking without sugar is especially
challenging. I have certainly had my share of flops of sweet treats made with
artificial sweeteners that ended up in the trashcan! But sweet help is here!
Choosing a sweetener that fits your needs
Artificial sweeteners have come a long way, and I’m sure that you have your
favorite. In the recipes in this book, I call for Splenda (either in packets or in
granular form) or Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking. They work well for me in
my cooking and baking, and they agree with my low-carb life. Just for the
record, I’m a Splenda advocate, but in no way do I profit from your purchase of
Splenda. It just works for me, and sharing what has worked for me in my low-
carb lifestyle over the past ten-plus years is what a lot of this book is about.
Splenda works well for baking and cooking fruits and desserts because it has
the capacity to stand up to high temperatures — it doesn’t break down. The
recipes in this dessert chapter call for Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking because
it works so well. Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking contains sugar. But 1⁄2 cup of
Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking replaces a full cup of sugar. So don’t be mis-
taken that Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking doesn’t contain any carbs. Check
out the comparison:

Chapter 13: Dazzling Low-Carb Desserts

You can use any artificial sweetener as a substitute for any of the artificial
sweetener ingredients the recipes in this chapter call for. I believe that artifi-
cial sweeteners are a personal choice in your low-carb lifestyle (get the scoop
on artificial sweeteners in Chapter 2). But keep in mind that different artificial
sweeteners react differently — especially in baking — so if you substitute
suggested ingredients in the recipes in this chapter, the outcome may not be
the same. I personally prefer not to cook with polyols and sugar alcohols. But
I’m not here to try to convince you to do it my way. As the old saying goes, “If
it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” If it’s working for you, keep cookin’!
Some artificial sweeteners don’t hold up well in cooking and baking when
heated and may actually be dangerous to your health. Aspartame is one of
these artificial sweeteners. I encourage you to do your homework and research
to make sure you’re using safe sweeteners. And, yes, there’s a huge contro-
versy over artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols/polyols (see Chapter 2 for
more on this controversy).
Picking the Finest Fruit Desserts
Have a look in Mother Nature’s recipe box, and you’ll find sweet treats sweet-
ened with natural sugar. Mother Nature is clever in her packing methods of
fruits, which contain no preservatives and are brimming with nutrients and
vitamins. As a special added benefit, she bulks fresh fruits with fiber that fills
you up and not out. The fiber factor is important to your low-carb healthy
lifestyle not only for the health benefits but also for its help in lowering the
net carb counts (see Chapter 2 for more on net carbs). Clever lady, Mother
Nature! 
While some fruits are higher in carb counts, such as pineapple and bananas,
opt for a seed fruit like blackberries and raspberries, and the fiber count goes
way up. When you subtract the fiber count from the carb count for these
sweet berries, the net carb counts are very reasonable in your low-carb
lifestyle. (See Chapter 3 for more on fruits that work in a low-carb diet.)
If you use canned fruits, you can reduce the carb counts even more if you
drain the fruit and rinse it.
Choosing light desserts to end meals if you’re already full makes so much
sense. There are a lot of wonderful fresh fruit recipes that can satisfy your
sweet tooth after a great meal. One way to dress up fresh fruits and create
scrumptious desserts is with low-carb sauces made from yogurts, sour
cream, mascarpone, and cream cheese (see Chapter 14 for some specific sug-
gestions). So get into fruit design and create some beautiful and healthy fruit
plates for desserts.

T Fruit Kabobs with 
Pineapple Dip
This fruit dessert is simple and refreshing, and the pineapple dip makes it shine. Feel
free to include other fruits on your bamboo skewers; just remember that carb counts
will vary. Did you ever think that something so pretty could be so good for your low-
carb lifestyle? This dessert is a great dish to take to a summer barbecue. The pineapple
dip here calls for plain yogurt. As always, look for the lowest sugar and carb counts you
can find. And heads up: You need bamboo skewers for this one. Check out the dessert
spread in the color section of the book to get a glimpse of these kabobs.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 12 to 14 minutes
Cooling time: About 1 hour
Yield: 6 servings
209
Chapter 13: Dazzling Low-Carb Desserts
1⁄4 cup low-sugar apple juice
1 cup fresh pineapple, chopped
1⁄4 cup plain yogurt
1 cup small fresh strawberries
1 cup fresh blackberries
1 cup cubed cantaloupe
2 kiwis, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch thick slices
2 nectarines, with peel, cut into 1⁄4-inch thick
slices
1 To make the pineapple dip, combine the apple juice and pineapple in a small saucepan,
and bring to a quick boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let
simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the pineapple mixture from the
heat and let it stand until cool (about 1⁄2 hour).
2 Place the cooled pineapple mixture in your blender, adding the yogurt. Blend the
pineapple mixture and yogurt until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until serving time.
3 Place pieces of fruit — strawberry, blackberry, cantaloupe, kiwi, and nectarine — 
alternating the fruits on the bamboo skewers and filling the kabobs. 
4 Serve the fruit kabobs with the pineapple dip.
Tip: You can find frozen pineapple chunks very reasonably priced in the frozen section of
your grocery store. That way you don’t have to attack a whole pineapple for this recipe.
The produce section has fresh pineapple already cut up and sold in little clear boxes, but
it’s very pricey.

Blueberry Cobbler
If you love berry pies and cobblers, you may think you can’t enjoy them with your low-
carb lifestyle. Well, not with this old-fashioned Midwest cook at the low-carb helm! I’ve
developed this incredible low-carb version of an old blueberry cobbler recipe I made
years ago. It’s sure to please your cravings for cobbler. If you want to substitute
peaches or a mixture of raspberries and blueberries, go for it — it’s your cobbler!

Nonstick cooking spray
4 cups frozen blueberries, unsweetened
1⁄4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
2 tablespoons whole-wheat pastry flour
1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
4 tablespoons cold butter, cut into 6 pieces
2 tablespoons half-and-half
11⁄2 teaspoons whole-wheat pastry flour
11⁄2 teaspoons Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Coat an 8-x-8-inch square baking dish with nonstick
cooking spray. In a large bowl, mix the blueberries, 1⁄4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend for
Baking, and 2 tablespoons pastry flour. Place the mixture in prepared baking dish.
2 In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup pastry flour, baking powder, salt, and 1⁄4 cup Splenda
Sugar Blend for Baking. Stir to combine dry ingredients.
3 Cut the butter into the dry ingredients using a pastry blender (3 to 4 minutes) or a few
quick pulses in your food processor until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
4 Add the half-and-half, and stir until the ingredients are moistened. Mold the mixture into
a ball with your hands (flour your hands a little if dough is a bit sticky).
5 Tear off a piece of wax paper about 18 inches long, so you have room to work, and sprin-
kle 11⁄2 teaspoons of pastry flour on it, spreading it out evenly with your hand. Place the
dough on top of the floured wax paper.
6 Place another piece of wax paper on top, and roll the dough out to the size of the 8-x-8-
inch baking dish. It doesn’t matter if the edges of the dough aren’t even. You simply
want it to cover most of the fruit that’s waiting in the dish for the crowning glory of the
dough topping. Use your baking dish as a guide by placing it over the top of the dough
when it’s rolled out in a creative semi-square.

7 Pick up the piece of wax paper with the dough on it, and turn it over on top of the blue-
berries in the baking dish. Peel off the wax paper.
8 Combine 11⁄2 teaspoons Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking and 1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon. Spray
the top of the dough lightly with cooking spray and sprinkle the mixture evenly over the
top of the dough (the cooking spray will help the cinnamon mixture to stick to the
dough). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. The topping will be semi-golden brown, but watch
it, because you don’t want to overbake it.
Variation: Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or low-carb vanilla ice cream.
Variation: Instead of using the entire dough rolled out for the topping of the cobbler, use
cookie cutters and cut out shapes if you’re celebrating something — Christmas tree shapes
or hearts for example. Cut out 9 shapes, so each individual serving has a cutout.
Tip: If you haven’t used whole-wheat pastry flour, it’s so smooth it’s almost like silk, so you
sometimes have to work with it a little differently. You need to be the judge of how mixtures
feel. Sometimes you have to add just a tad more pastry flour, because it’s such a soft flour.
You’ll get the hang of it after a couple times baking with it and will love it. It’s healthy, and
it brings great light and airy results to your low-carb cooking and baking. You can combine
whole-wheat pastry flour with white whole-wheat flour when you need a more substantial
flour (not as soft a flour).

For a quick dessert, slice up some fruit, such as apples, peaches, and nec-

it in the microwave to warm. Add a small scoop of low-carb vanilla ice cream
and enjoy the decadence as the ice cream melts into the warm fruit.

Red, red wine and nectarines
Nectarines are a winner for a spirited treat.
Allow one large, ripe nectarine for each person.
Leave the skins on the nectarines and, right
before dinner, slice them in a shallow bowl of
red, red wine that’s been chilling all day (use the
wine of your choice; a light red table wine
works, as does Merlot). By dessert time, you
have a chilled, spirited treat. Serve in something
tall, clear, and stemmed for an elegant presen-
tation. Add a sprinkling of fresh red raspberries
on the top and maybe a dollop of whipped
cream.

Dancing the Meringue in the Kitchen
You can do so much with meringue, and I guarantee it’ll bring sweet sunshine
to your low-carb lifestyle. The beauty of meringue is that it’s mostly egg
whites and no-calorie, no-carb air! You can make all kinds of cookies, cakes,
ice cream cakes, pies, piecrusts, and simple shells. The list of fillings begins
with fresh fruits, fruit purees, and fruit sauces and continues with all kinds of
puddings and low-carb ice creams, to mention a few. You can make puddings
from scratch, or you can use sugar-free pudding mixes. You can buy a bag of
frozen mixed fruits and make a quick sauce. In a snap, you’ve created a deli-
cious and beautiful dessert. If you’re having guests, meringue shells with
mouthwatering, luscious fillings are sure to be a showstopper.
Whipping together a few ingredients
Regardless of what final form your marvelous meringue takes, all meringues
start with the same basic ingredients and a few simple steps. Meringue is
simply beaten egg whites that are stiffened with sugar or sugar substitute,
cream of tartar and/or salt to stabilize the egg whites, and some flavoring,
which is usually vanilla (of course, you can get creative with your flavoring).
It’s best to separate the whites of eggs from the yolks when the eggs are cold.
But the secret to increased volume and finer texture of your whipped egg
whites is to start whipping them at room temperature. So separate and wait.
The volume of your whites can be increased 6 to 8 times if you leave them at
room temperature for no longer than 30 minutes before you begin beating.
Here’s the basic two-step approach and some explanation that should pro-
vide you with a firm foundation for your meringue mixing and serve you well
as you tackle any meringue recipe. See Figure 13-1 for how meringue peaks
should look.
1. Beat/whip your eggs until they form soft peaks and then add cream of
tartar.
Soft peaks refers to egg whites that are beginning to foam and are cloudy
looking. Don’t begin on high speed when you’re beating your whites.
Start at medium-low to medium speed, making them foamy. If you start
out with your mixer in high gear, large bubbles are likely to form, which
isn’t what you want. You’re after lots of tiny air bubbles for great texture.
Cream of tartar is added at the stage when the whites begin to foam.
Cream of tartar is a mild acid salt. It plays a huge role in successful
meringues because the acidic nature of cream of tartar acts as a stabi-
lizer in the whites. When you stop the mixer and lift the beaters, the soft
peaks should be a little droopy.
212
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 

2. Add sugar substitute and beat/whip your eggs to stiff peaks.
When beating your egg whites for meringues, it’s best to wait until soft
peaks begin to form before adding the sweetener. Crank your mixer up
on high, and as the foamy whites become moist and shiny, it’s time to
add your sweetener. So as not to deflate the whites, add the sweetener
at the side of the bowl instead of pouring it in the middle. To get the
whites to the stiff peak stage, keep your mixer on high and beat until the
whites are glossy. Stop your mixer when the tips of the peaks stand up
straight when you lift the beaters. This is a critical stage to your success
in meringue building. A matter of less than one minute can turn your
wonderful stiff peaks dull and dry, and then they’re useless.
Now you can build your meringue castles and shape them any way you want.
One of my favorites that’s so easy is meringue shells — like the one on the
front of the book. (That’s why we put it there — because it’s my favorite!)
Meringue shells are versatile and can make an elegant presentation. In the
“Mastering meringue shells” section, I show you how to build meringue shells
step by step. But I also give you some recipes that include meringue piecrust
and cookie options.
Here are some tips to help you get the hang of making marvelous meringue:
 Make sure your egg whites are at room temperature. You get more fluff
this way because the volume of the egg white increases when warm.
 When you’re beating the egg whites, use a squeaky clean and dry bowl
that’s preferably stainless steel, glass, or copper — never plastic. Egg
whites just don’t cooperate in a plastic bowl because, even though plas-
tic appears to be clean, it still can retain some grease that you can’t see.
Also make sure the eggbeaters and the spatula are free of grease. To be
sure your utensils are squeaky clean, wipe them with fresh lemon juice,
rinse in warm water, and dry them thoroughly.
 Make sure your hands are very clean and free of oil or butter when you
crack your eggs. I’m not kidding here — grease interferes with beating
the whites in the bowl, and greasy hands do the same thing!
 If you drop a speck of the yolk into the egg white when separating the
two, take the speck of yolk out with a broken eggshell. Again, this is
about not getting any grease or fat in the egg white. If there’s a tiny
Figure 13-1:
Reaching
the peaks.
213
Chapter 13: Dazzling Low-Carb Desserts

speck of egg yolk in the whites, they won’t whip up to a high volume.
That’s why you use a broken eggshell — so you don’t mess up the
whites with a utensil that could have some residue on it.
 Get a weather report before making meringues — I’m serious! If it’s rain-
ing outside or if the humidity is really high, getting volume with your egg
whites is tough. No, I can’t explain it — it just is. Trust me.
T Raspberry Ribbon Pie 
with Meringue Crust
I’ve had this recipe in my recipe box since I was in my 20s, so you know it’s a very old
favorite. Back then, it was full of sugar and high in carb counts. But I’ve successfully
brought this favorite back to low-carb life. This pie isn’t only delicious and very differ-
ent, but it’s also very pretty.

Nonstick cooking spray
4 egg whites
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar
21⁄2 tablespoons Splenda Sugar Blend for
Baking
1 4-serving package sugar-free raspberry
gelatin
2 tablespoons Splenda Sugar Blend for
Baking
11⁄4 cups boiling water
10-ounce package frozen red raspberries,
unsweetened 
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons Splenda Sugar Blend for
Baking
1 teaspoon vanilla
Dash of salt
1 cup heavy cream, whipped
1 Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Spray a 9-inch glass pie plate with nonstick cooking
spray. Set aside.
2 Bring the egg whites to room temperature for no longer than 30 minutes and beat them
until they’re foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue beating until the whites begin
to form soft peaks.
3 Gradually add 21⁄2 tablespoons Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking until the whites form stiff
glossy peaks.
4 Spread the meringue with the back of a large tablespoon evenly in the bottom of the
pie plate, and swirl it up the sides. Smooth it out. Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes at
275 degrees. Turn the oven up to 300 degrees, and bake an additional 20 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool.

5 Dissolve the gelatin and 2 tablespoons Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking in 11⁄4 cups boil-
ing water. Add the frozen raspberries and lemon juice, stirring until the berries are
thawed. Chill until partially set.
6 Blend the cream cheese, 2 tablespoons Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking, vanilla, and salt,
using a mixer. Fold in a small amount (about 1⁄8 cup) of whipped cream, and then gently
fold in the remaining whipped cream.
7 Spread half of the white cream cheese mixture over the bottom of the cooled meringue
pie shell. Cover with half of the red gelatin mixture. Repeat layers. Chill until set.
Variation: Add 1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla and 1⁄2 cup chopped pecans to the meringue. Bake the
meringue crust at 300 degrees for 1 hour. Cool and fill with a whipped cream filling such as
the Chocolate-Strawberry Whipping Cream Filling in this section or one of your own favorites
out of your recipe box.
Tip: For perfect whipped cream, chill your bowl and your beaters for about 15 minutes
before whipping the cream. Beat whipping cream on low to medium speed just until soft
peaks form. If you whip it too much, you’ll have butter.

The easiest way to make anything meringue these days is to use the egg
white product found in your dairy case. These liquid egg whites aren’t expen-
sive, and they let you avoid trying to figure out what to do with all those
yolks. You can measure the whites by the cup or tablespoon, and the guide is
right on the carton. Even though you’re using the egg whites in a carton, be
sure to bring them to room temperature before you start beating them with
your mixer. It makes all the difference in the world in the way they whip up.
Don’t even think about trying to make meringue on a rainy or foggy day.
You’ll end up with a sticky mess. The humidity in the air makes meringue lose
its crispness.

Meringue trivia
A bit of meringue trivia: A Swiss pastry chef in
the early 18th century created the very first
meringues. “Chef Meringue” was also known as
Gasparni. As the story goes, Gasparni lived in a
small town known as Mehryngen, and he named
his elegant new dessert after his hometown.

T Chocolate Cinnamon-Walnut 
Meringue Cookies
These low-carb cookies are great to tuck in your lunch bag. They’re also great served
with your favorite low-carb ice cream. Make this treat extra-special by serving your ice
cream in an old-fashioned sundae glass on a dessert plate with a couple cookies on the
side. You can find these sundae glasses at the dollar store.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 14 cookies (1 per serving)

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
1⁄4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
4 teaspoons cocoa powder
2 egg whites, room temperature
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1⁄3 cup chopped walnut pieces
1 Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set
aside.
2 Sift together the Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking, cinnamon, and cocoa on a sheet of
wax paper. Set aside.
3 In a small bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the salt and cream of tartar, and
beat into stiff, shiny peaks. Gently fold in the cocoa mixture. Fold the nuts in last.
4 Drop generous teaspoons of the batter onto the baking sheets. You may want to use the
old two-spoon method, using one spoon to dip the mixture out of the bowl and then the
second spoon to push the meringue mixture onto the baking sheet. Give the cookies
room, spacing them about 1-inch apart on the baking sheet.
5 Bake about 20 minutes or until set. Remove the cookies from the oven and transfer to a
wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight metal container at room temperature.
Tip: Meringue cookies don’t freeze well — the meringue becomes tough. Guess you’ll just
have to eat them!

Mastering meringue shells
Did that beautiful meringue shell filled with sweet yummy-looking fruit on the
cover of the book get your attention? Did it make your mouth water for some-
thing sweet? You too can make great low-carb meringue sweet treats. I’ve
dedicated quite a bit of time and energy in this section to help you master the
basics of meringue making, and then you’ll dream up all kinds of scrumptious
fillings for them. Meringue shells are my favorite low-carb sweet. They’re
unique and like eating sweet crunchy air.
You need to make sure to have parchment paper on hand when making
meringue shells. You can make the shells either by placing mounds on the
baking sheet or by using a pastry bag. It just depends on how fancy you want
to be. I make mine in mounds like this:
1. Line your baking sheet with the parchment paper.
This stuff is magical because the meringues don’t stick to it, and you just
peel it off.
2. Place equal mounds of meringue on the parchment paper. You can do
this with a tablespoon, or if you’re a precise person, you can actually
measure each meringue (about 1⁄2 cup).
If you want to be really precise, draw 3- to 31⁄-inch circles on the parch-
ment paper for uniformity. If you’d rather wing it, be my guest.
3. Hollow out the center of the mound of each meringue with the back of
a tablespoon.
This hole is where you’re going to put your filling when the meringues
are baked. It’s kind of like a little meringue bowl.
If you prefer the fancy way of doing things to recreate that look found on the
cover of this book, use a pastry bag instead. If so, follow these steps:
1. Use a size 6 star tip on your pastry bag, and fill it with meringue.
2. Begin piping the meringue until you have six coiled circles (see
Figure 13-2).
This should take up a space of about 3 to 31⁄2 inches.
3. Add one more piping around the outer edge of your meringue circle.

T Basic Meringue Shells 
with Berry Filling
This recipe is the beautiful meringue shell on the cover of this book, and it’s just as deli-
cious as it looks! I’m giving you a very simple and basic meringue recipe here that you
can use for shells and for tortes with fillings. You can even make meringue ice cream
sandwiches (find out how later in the recipe). After you master basic meringue, you’ll
have so many scrumptious low-carb options you just won’t know where to start.
Remember: The basic meringues have only 8 grams of net carbs each; it’s what you put in
the middle that make the carb counts go up. Because this basic meringue recipe has a
hint of vanilla flavoring coupled with a bit of sweetness, your sweet tooth cravings will
be oh so satisfied. Let the meringue madness begin!
Preparation time: 15 to 20 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Drying time: 1 hour 
Yield: 6 servings
218
Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
2 egg whites
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar
Pinch of salt
1⁄4 teaspoon vanilla
1⁄4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
Berry Filling (see the following recipe)
6 sprigs fresh mint (optional)
1 Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2 Bring the egg whites to room temperature. Beat the whites until foamy in a squeaky-
clean aluminum or glass bowl (not plastic) with very clean beaters. Add the cream of
tartar, salt, and vanilla, and continue beating until the whites begin to form soft peaks.
3 Gradually add the Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking as you continue to beat until the
whites form stiff peaks. Whites should remain glossy.
4 Spoon the meringue into 6 equal mounds on the baking sheet (see the text earlier in this
section for tips and tricks).
5 Shape the mounds of meringue into nest-like cups. You can do this easily with the back
of a small tablespoon, working from the center out and then smoothing around the edge
of the meringue cup.
6 Bake for 35 minutes, and don’t open the oven door. You can take a peek to see if they’re
done and turn off the oven, close the door again and let the meringue dry for 1 hour in
the oven. Then transfer them to a cooling rack to air dry until you’re ready to fill the
cups when you’re ready to serve. While the meringue is baking and drying, you can pre-
pare the Berry Filling and chill it.
7 When ready to serve, spoon the Berry Filling into the meringue shells. Garnish with
fresh mint, if desired.

Chapter 13: Dazzling Low-Carb Desserts
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon blackberry fresh fruit spread (no
sugar added, preferably organic)
1 tablespoon Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
1⁄2 pint fresh blueberries
1⁄2 pint fresh raspberries
2 cups strawberries, hulled and halved
1 Combine the lemon juice, blackberry fresh fruit spread, and Splenda Sugar Blend for
Baking in a small bowl, and mix with a teaspoon.
2 Combine the blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries in a bowl. Pour the blackberry
liquid over the berries, and stir the berries all together. Let the berries stand until juices
form, probably about 2 hours in the fridge. Stir occasionally.
Variation: Fill the meringue shells with sugar-free vanilla pudding mix. Spoon 1⁄4 cup pud-
ding into each meringue, and top with fresh blackberries.
Variation: Make plain, chocolate, or flavored basic meringue. Spread meringue in 3-inch flat
rounds and bake. When dry, spread with your favorite low-carb ice cream (like chocolate
chip). Pop another meringue on top, wrap it in wax paper, and freeze it in a self-sealing plas-
tic bag. It’s a very crunchy sweet treat.
Tip: Trying to get your parchment to lie down on your baking sheet? After you whip your
egg whites, plop a few small dabs of them on the baking sheet. Put your parchment paper
on top, and smooth it down.

If your meringues get stubborn when it’s time for them to come off the parch-
ment paper, try using a very thin pancake turner to help coax them off with-
out breaking them.

Storing meringues is a bit tricky but you can do it. If you’re planning to use
them for guests or a party make them no earlier than two days in advance.
To store, make sure that they’re completely cool and store in an airtight con-
tainer separated by waxed paper at room temperature for up to two days.
Puffin’ Pastries Gone Low-Carb
What a treat — a specialty French pastry gone low-carb. I call them puffies,
but the real name for this French delight is choux pastry. Puffies can be the
beginnings of low-carb cream puffs, chocolate éclairs, and profiteroles. The
variations are endless and left only to your sweet low-carb imagination.
You’ll be delightfully surprised at how quick these little puffies come together.
You can even freeze them and pop them out when your sweet tooth is hollering
at you. Puffies have a very low carb count, so the carb count of the finished
puffy only depends on what you decide to fill or stuff it with.
Use these tips to master the recipe for Puffies in this chapter:
 Heat the butter and the liquid in a small, heavy saucepan, heating slowly.
You want the butter to be melted before the boiling point is reached.
 You can simply drop the puffies on a cookie sheet and bake them, or you
can get fancy and pop them in a pastry bag and pipe out the dough.
 Place the puffies in a very hot oven first so they puff up, and then reduce
the heat so they don’t get too brown while they’re drying.
 The secret to not having your puffies collapse on you is to make sure
they’re cooked and dry all the way through.
 If you’re making round puffs, make a little hole or a slit in them as soon
as you remove them from the oven to allow the steam to escape. If
you’re making éclairs, make the éclair slit in them.
 If you want more room inside your puffies for filling, or if they’re not
quite dry in the middle, hollow them out while they’re still warm from
the oven. Split them with a knife, and gently remove any soft dough from
the inside. Fill them when they’re cooled and pop their tops on. Serve
with a sauce and maybe a dollop of whipped cream.

T Puffies
This is a quick and easy recipe for cream puffs that can be filled with everything from
whipped cream fillings to tuna salad to fruits and berries to ice cream to sugar-free 
puddings — the list is endless. (Check out my suggestions in this chapter, and the
dessert spread in the color section of the book.) And so your low-carb puff imagination
begins. If you can resist, puffies freeze well.

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
Nonstick cooking spray
3 tablespoons butter
1⁄3 cup water
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole-wheat pastry
flour
1 large egg
1 large egg white
1 Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Spray a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.
2 In a heavy pan, combine the butter, water, and salt. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat
to low.
3 Add all the flour at once, and stir until the globby mix begins to pull away from the
sides of the pan and form a ball (film will begin to form in the bottom of the saucepan).
4 Remove the pan from the heat and let cool for about 3 minutes. Add the whole egg and
then the one egg white, one at a time, beating vigorously after each addition. The mix-
ture will become smooth and shiny.
5 While the pastry is still warm, use a tablespoon to spoon the dough onto the prepared
baking sheet, making 8 mounds.
6 Turn the oven up to 450 degrees, and place the baking pan in the lower third of the
oven. Bake for 15 minutes, and the dough will be well puffed and lightly browned.
7 Quickly turn the oven back to 300 degrees, and bake 15 minutes longer until golden.
8 Carefully cut a small slit in the side of each puffy, and allow the steam to escape. Turn
off the oven, and leave the puffs in the oven to dry for 5 minutes. Remove and place on
the racks to cool. Slice the puffs in half, and if there’s damp dough inside, hollow it out
with a spoon.
9 Fill with your filling of choice and pop the top back on to complete your puffy.

Don’t get bored with your puffies. Try the following variations:
 For chocolate puffies, add 1 tablespoon of baking cocoa and 1 teaspoon
Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking to basic dough mixture. Fill with vanilla
ice cream. Top with low-carb chocolate topping and low-carb caramel
topping. Place four pecan halves for feet, and you have a low-carb
chocolate turtle cream puff!
 Fill a puffy with chilled sugar-free white chocolate pudding. For a quick
low-carb topping, combine 2 tablespoons Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
and 1⁄8 teaspoon cornstarch. Add 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa and
blend together. Stir in 1 tablespoon hot coffee. Drizzle over your filled
puffy.
 Low-carb ice cream makes a quick and tasty puffy filling. Choose from
mint chocolate chip, butter pecan, chocolate, strawberry, vanilla bean,
chocolate chip, or your personal favorite.
 Prepare a small package of instant sugar-free vanilla, chocolate, or pista-
chio pudding mix. Prepare as the label directs, but use only 11⁄4 cups milk.
Whip 1 cup of heavy cream, and fold it into the pudding. If you’re using
vanilla pudding, you can add all kinds of extracts such as peppermint,
almond, orange, or one of your favorites.
Dabbling in Chocolate Decadence
I can’t dedicate an entire chapter to low-carb desserts without offering a few
chocolate recipes. Well, I guess I could, but I’m sure I’d be leaving out a lot of
chocoholics out there. I once read that the original chocolate cake was called
“devil’s food” — fitting, isn’t it?
When you’re making a low-carb chocolate treat and you need to flour the
pan, use baking cocoa instead of flour.
The Chocolate Bread Pudding recipe in this section is made in a ramekin. If
you’re unfamiliar with these baking dishes, check out Figure 13-3.

T Chocolate Fruit Pizza
This was a high-carb, high-sugar treat I made for my guests at my bed-and-breakfast in
Branson, Missouri, and they raved about it. I’ve since made the recipe chocolaty low-
carb and covered it with healthy fresh fruits. The crust is a pat and bake crust, so it’s
super quick and easy. The combination of the chocolate and the light filling with the
fruit and glaze is sure to make your low-carb heart smile (for a preview, check out the
color section of the book). If you skip the glaze, you knock off a bunch of carbs. And if
this carb count looks a tad high to you, look at a normal recipe for this dessert: The
carb counts are up at around 70 or 80 per slice! I’ve specified fruits for the recipe but
you can ignore me and use your favorites, just be sure to watch the carb counts.
Preparation time: 25 minutes

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
Nonstick cooking spray
1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
1⁄4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
2 tablespoons baking cocoa
1⁄2 cup butter, softened to room temperature
1⁄4 cup sour cream
1⁄4 cup plain yogurt
2 teaspoons Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
1⁄4 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3⁄4 cup pineapple juice
1 teaspoon Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1⁄2 cup sliced kiwi
1 cup sliced strawberries
1 cup blueberries
1⁄2 cup red raspberries
1 cup blackberries
1 nectarine, cut in thin slices for garnish
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray a 9-x-11⁄4-inch quiche dish lightly with nonstick
cooking spray (you can also use a glass pie plate; just don’t use metal).
2 Combine the flour, 1⁄4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking, and cocoa. Add the softened
butter, and mix until a soft dough forms (I use my hands to mix).

3 Press the dough firmly and evenly against the bottom of your quiche dish. Bring it up
just slightly along the sides of your dish because it will shrink when you’re baking it.
4 Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until set. Don’t over bake! Let it cool completely before
preparing the toppings for the pizza.
5 Combine the sour cream, yogurt, 2 teaspoons Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking, and
vanilla well. Spread the mixture over the cooled chocolate crust, and refrigerate.
6 In a small saucepan, combine the lemon juice, pineapple juice, 1 teaspoon Splenda
Sugar Blend for Baking, and cornstarch. Stirring constantly, cook until the mixture is
bubbly and begins to thicken. Continue cooking, still stirring constantly for 2 more min-
utes. Let the mixture cool until completely cool.
7 Arrange the fruit on top of the pizza, saving the nectarine slices until last for garnishing.
Spoon the cooled glaze over the fruit. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and chill until
serving time.
Variation: Skip the glaze if you’re really in a hurry as the chocolate pizza still tastes
yummy and it’s quick, quick without the glaze. The glaze is tasty too, but its purpose is
more to hold the fruit in place and prevent it from drying out and turning brown.
Variation: You can also use individual tart pans for a special party and really impress your
low-carb guests. Just be sure to watch the pat and bake crust, because it bakes very quickly
in the tart pans. Set your timer and check them often!
Variation: This recipe makes a great chocolate crust for any type of pudding, chiffon, or
ice cream pie. So get creative. Try filling this pat-and-bake chocolate crust with sugar-free
pistachio pudding. Top it with freshly whipped cream and chocolate curls.

T Chocolate Bread Pudding
Talk about to die for — this stuff is the ultimate in chocolate decadence. The recipe tells
you to make it in 1 cup ramekins, but you can easily make it in 1⁄2 cup ramekins and make
12 rather than 6. If you don’t have ramekins, use ovenproof custard dishes. You can
serve this bread pudding hot from the oven, lukewarm, or right from the fridge. It’s a
great decadent treat, but this isn’t an everyday low-carb snack. I guarantee it’s like no
bread pudding you’ve ever tasted!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

Part II: Low-Carb Cooking Made Easy 
Nonstick cooking spray
6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips
4 tablespoons Splenda Sugar Blend for
Baking
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
21⁄2 cups cubed soft, fresh, low-carb bread
(about 4 slices of bread) 
1 cup heavy cream
1⁄2 cup water 
1 egg, at room temperature
Splenda for garnish (optional)
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and place the rack in the middle of the oven.
2 Spray the ramekins (or custard dishes) with nonstick cooking spray, and place them
on a baking sheet, spaced evenly. Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave. Start off
at 45 seconds on HIGH and then stir them. If necessary, pop them back in for another
15 seconds. The chocolate doesn’t have to be super runny, just melted.
3 Combine the Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking, cinnamon, salt, and bread cubes in a
medium bowl.
4 In a large measuring cup, combine the heavy cream with the water. Whisk the egg into
the heavy cream mixture and add the melted chocolate, stirring until well blended.
5 Pour the chocolate mixture over bread mixture. Using a large spoon, stir vigorously
until well blended.
6 Use a 1⁄2-cup measuring cup to pour the mixture into each ramekin. They’ll be slightly
more than half full and won’t raise much during baking.
7 Bake for 15 minutes or until the tops of the pudding are just barely firm to the touch.
Sprinkle the tops with a light dusting of Splenda, if desired.
Tip: The success of this awesome bread pudding depends on the freshness of the bread you
use. I use very fresh low-carb white bread with no more than 9 grams of carbs per slice. If
you’re serving to guests, create an elegant presentation by placing a couple fresh red raspber-
ries and a fresh mint sprig on the side of the dessert dish with a dusting of Splenda on top.

T Dirt Cake
Did you ever think that Dirt Cake would go low-carb? It seems that all your favorites are
getting smarter and following a low-carb healthy lifestyle — even Dirt Cake! This recipe
is great fun if you’re going to a garden party, a barbecue, or a shower — it makes a great
centerpiece as well as a tasty dessert. I call for it to be assembled in a new plastic flow-
erpot and decorated with silk flowers, but you can also use a large, clear glass bowl like
a salad or trifle bowl. You can use a regular terra cotta–looking new flowerpot or a clear
plastic one. This is a very thoughtful treat to take to a friend that’s convalescing from an
illness at home. If you’re going to a barbecue, you can freeze your dirt cake and let it
thaw out when you get there. For even more fun, serve with a new, small garden spade.

4 Prepare the pudding with the low-carb milk. Fold in the whipped cream.
5 Fold the whipped cream mixture into the cream cheese mixture.
6 Beginning at the bottom of the flowerpot (or bowl) layer your ingredients beginning
with crushed cookies then the cream cheese/pudding mix, alternating layers. Be sure
you end with the crushed cookies as the top layer, so your sunflower will blossom in
the “dirt.”
7 Refrigerate until ready to serve, or freeze if you’re taking it to a gathering. When you’re
ready to serve, wrap the stem of a silk flower in aluminum foil, and stick the flower in
the middle of the cake.
Variation: You can also prepare this dessert layered in a cake pan. I’ve even seen this
dessert served in a child’s plastic sand bucket served with a plastic shovel.

Outsmarting Cravings with 
Low-Carb Snacks and Dips
In This Chapter
 Snacking your way to a healthy lifestyle
 Putting nuts and veggies on the top of your snack list
 Dreaming up delicious low-carb dips
S
core another point for the low-carb lifestyle.
Taking a low-carb approach to life not only
means you can snack but that you’re actually
encouraged to snack. If you’re a veteran of the diet
wars and are familiar with their many taboos
against snacking, this news is likely as shocking as
it is exciting.
Not just any snack will do, however. And that’s where this chapter comes in.
In it, I stress that the question isn’t to snack or not to snack but how and
when to snack. Snacking unwisely with your low-carb lifestyle can be a disas-
ter, while snacking wisely can actually help you burn calories, helping you
lose or maintain your weight.
Snacking Smart
One of the low-carb lifestyle mantras is don’t get too hungry — eat some-
thing. One of the secrets of low-carb success is to keep your gylcemic index
(GI) level even and prevent spikes in blood sugar levels. Spikes in your blood
sugar level compare to sugar highs when you get that surge of energy — but
then those sugar levels dip, and so does your energy. The GI is a system that
rates and measures how quickly food raises your blood sugar level. Snacking
keeps those blood sugar peaks and valleys evened out, which evens out your
flow of energy, making you more alert and energized. (To find out more about
the glycemic index, see Chapter 2.)

While snacking is keeping your GI level even, it’s doing double duty and feed-
ing your metabolic fire to keep it burning those calories and fat. Woo hoo!
Just as you throw another log on the fire to keep that campfire burning, you
need to feed your internal furnace, known as your metabolism, to stoke your
metabolic burn. Your furnace (or metabolism) turns your food into fuel for
your body while it’s burning up calories and fat. 
Give your metabolism a little boost and some encouragement to keep its
burn going. Eat a healthy snack when you have a snack attack, or eat one
before the craving hits. Regular snacking is a desirable and rewarding part of
the low-carb lifestyle.
Snacking more is better
Bodies are quirky rascals and sometimes they have a mind of their own!
Research has proven that eating less to lose weight confuses your body.
Your body says, “Hey, when are you going to feed me again?” It then decides
that it had better store some sugar and fat just in case you don’t feed it for
a while. So opting for starvation diets or cutting way back on food intake
simply doesn’t work. When you get your body accustomed to eating healthy
low-carb meals and snacking smartly in between, your body begins to relax,
and your more apt burn those calories and fat up right away. Because you’ve
become consistent in smart snacking, your body knows that more food is on
the way. The weird thing is that you can eat more smart snacks along with
your smart carb meals and lose more weight. (Check out Chapter 2 for more
information on eating more frequently to lose weight.) The big jackpot comes
when you fold in some exercise like walking (see Chapter 5), and your chances
of maintaining your healthy weight go way up in your favor.
Snacking better is great
Eating healthy snacks helps you to maintain your weight instead of causing
you to stall your weight loss or, worse yet, pack on pounds. Choosing smart
snacks is thinking about fiber and protein foods that are a good double-edged
sword. Fiber and protein fill you up, giving you a satisfied feeling, and the
fiber gives you tons of nutrients and doesn’t budge the scales upward. (Find
out more about fiber and protein in Chapter 2.)
I’m an advocate of snacks of fresh veggies and fruits, cheeses, and nuts, with
the keyword being fresh. This doesn’t mean that there aren’t some prepared
foods out there that are low-carb snack acceptable. One of my favorite store-
bought snacks is sugar-free freezer pops. Prepackaged nuts are another good
snack idea. Yes, I know what you want me talk about — all of the cookies and
232
Part III: Expanding Everyday Low-Carb Cooking 

candies and bars that are labeled low-carb with low, low carb counts plas-
tered on the front of the package. Am I going to tell you that I never eat a 
low-carb chocolate chip cookie or a low-carb bar? Nope, not this lady — you
may come to one of my book signings, and I’ll be busted! I just want to cau-
tion you that a lot of the prepacked low-carb snack material that’s out there
isn’t healthy for you and has been known to create some major weight stalls.
They’re no different than the every day All-American super snacks of potato
chips, cheese curls, cookies, candy, kettle corn, and soda. The United States
is an obese nation because of some of these foods. So if you load up on the
low-carb prepared snacks, you’re just trading one bad habit for another. Be
good to your body and eat with smart low-carb thinking in mind, which trans-
lates into moderation.
A secret to snacking is to eat your snack slowly and pace yourself — don’t
gobble. Eating slowly helps satisfy your hunger or your craving much better,
and taking your time gives you an opportunity to enjoy a little break from the
simple everyday stresses of life. Stop, have a snack, take a deep breath, and
maybe even go for a 5-minute walk.
Managing snacking is key
In low-carb snack management, the key is to try to plan your snacks for the
entire day either the night before or at least before you head out the door to
go to work, run errands, or whatever it is you’re off to do. Part of the success
of the low-carb lifestyle is to be just a tiny bit ahead of the game. Think of
yourself as the manager of your healthy lifestyle, and your job is to outwit
your appetite. This way of thinking becomes somewhat of a game, and you do
like to win, don’t you?
I usually carry some raw almonds with me wherever I go. Baby carrots are
another frequent companion of mine. Don’t let your appetite or cravings pop
up and catch you off guard with nothing healthy in the fridge, the cupboard,
the car, your workplace, or even your purse. It’ll help you stay away from
those nasty vending machines and drive-thrus. Always have something low-
carb healthy available to pop in your mouth to make your tummy happy. A
happy tummy becomes a healthy weight-controlled body. (Find out more
about planning foods and meals in Chapter 20.)
Just how easy — and tasty — can it be to assemble low-carb snacks? I want
you to get a feeling for the vastness of the great food combinations just wait-
ing to be discovered. If you play your cards right, you’ll never get bored with
food in your low-carb life. Just keep on smart snacking! Check out the follow-
ing list to get started snacking now.

Chapter 14: Outsmarting Cravings with Low-Carb Snacks and Dips

 1⁄4 cup cottage cheese and 3 or 4 almonds
 1⁄4 cup of your choice of fresh or frozen strawberries, blueberries, rasp-
berries, or green grapes
 1⁄2 cup plain yogurt, 1⁄2 packet Splenda, and 1 teaspoon toasted almonds
 1⁄2 cup blackberries and 1 stick string cheese
 A cup of bouillon
 4 slices very thin deli turkey breast and half an apple (cut in slices)
 4 slices very thin deli turkey or ham spread with cream cheese and
sprinkled with fresh chives, rolled up
 Up to 10 green or black olives
 Stalk of celery filled with natural peanut butter, cream cheese, or home-
made nut butter
 An ounce of hard cheese wrapped in an ounce of hard salami
 Low-carb tortillas with all kinds of easy fillings, such as mayonnaise, half
an avocado (chopped fine), and salt and pepper to taste (see the sugges-
tion in the Ricotta Dip for Fruits recipe later in the chapter)
 Hard-cooked eggs with salt and pepper
If you want to make a special snack that’s a bit out of the ordinary, try toast
cups. Trim the crusts from sliced, low-carb whole-wheat bread, brush the
bread with butter, press into muffin tins, and toast until golden at 350
degrees. Fill with tuna salad, chicken salad, or another favorite of your low-
carb recipes.
Surviving the Munchies 
with Low-Carb Treats
The keys to successful healthy snacking with your low-carb lifestyle are to
not get ravenous and to always have something healthy with you to munch
on at all times. Your pre-planning will pay off in the long term.
One way to improve your odds of healthy snacking is to use lots of resealable
plastic bags. For example, when you come home from shopping with your big
bag of nuts, you can measure them out in individual bags to take with you,
thus reducing the temptation to eat more than you need by dipping into the
big bag. You can do the same thing with your fresh veggies. When I come in
with a big bag of baby carrots, I throw them in a colander, give them a quick
234
Part III: Expanding Everyday Low-Carb Cooking 

swish (even though the package tells me they’re prewashed), and put them in
individual snack bags. If I’m out the door on errands or a shopping spree, I
don’t have to stop and fill a bag with fresh snacks — I just grab one and go.
Going nuts
Well, nuts! Yes, nuts are a great answer to low-carb snacking. For starters,
they’re portable: They’re easy to tote, they’re not messy, and you can eat
them literally anywhere. When you get that little twinge of hunger, eat a few
nuts. You’ll be amazed when your hunger magically disappears. Here’s a bit
of nutty health news to urge you to make nuts part of your snacking routine:
 Recent studies have shown that consuming 1 to 2 ounces of nuts a day
can actually help you lose weight and even help you to keep it off.
Although some nuts are higher in carbs than others, no nut is a bad low-
carb choice. It appears that nuts may very well keep that metabolic burn
going, so burn, baby, burn.
 Even though nuts are high in fat, they contain 90 percent heart-healthy
fats — unsaturated fats that don’t have an impact on raising your cho-
lesterol. These little rascals can help reduce your risk of heart attack
while you soothe your cravings.
 Nuts are also a great source of fiber and protein. Both fiber and protein
are great components for high nutrient low-carb foods and snacks. They
fill you up and not out.
Even better, nuts are versatile. In addition to eating them as a snack, you can
use them in place of croutons on your salad and even use them to give extra
crunch to your favorite veggie recipes.
But what about the carbs, you ask? Consider the following breakdown for 1⁄4
cup of each kind of nuts. I subtracted the fiber counts for you, so these are
net carb counts. (Find more on net carbs in Chapter 2.) I only caution you to
be aware of calorie counts in nuts such as cashews because the calorie
counts run pretty high. I’m not saying don’t eat cashews. Just be aware that
calories count too in an overall healthy low-carb lifestyle. Here are the net
carb counts for 1⁄4 cup nuts (check out Figure 14-1 to see what these guys look
like):
 Almonds: 2.8 net grams
 Brazil nuts: 2.6 net grams
 Cashews: 2.8 net grams
 Hazelnuts: 2.4 net grams
235
Chapter 14: Outsmarting Cravings with Low-Carb Snacks and Dips

 Macadamia nuts: 1.8 net grams
 Peanuts: 3.6 net grams
 Pecans: 1.2 net grams
 Pistachios: 6.2 net grams
 Walnuts: 2.2 net grams
Here’s an idea for a quick treat: Roast some raw almonds. Lightly coat a shal-
low, nonstick baking pan with some light olive oil and toss them. Sprinkle
them with an herb or spice of your choice, like a little curry powder, chili
powder, or even some dried basil to liven things up. Bake at 350 degrees for 
9 to12 minutes until slightly darkened. Watch ’em so they don’t burn. Enjoy
them warm!

T Spiced Pecans
These are sure to please and are guaranteed to wake up your taste buds in addition to
satisfying that annoying hunger pang. These are best served warm. You can store them
in an airtight container for a day or so but no longer than that.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 8 1⁄4-cup servings
1⁄2 stick butter
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon finely minced garlic
1⁄2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
2 cups large whole pecans
Salt (optional)
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Melt the butter and combine it with the
Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and hot pepper sauce in a small bowl. In a medium bowl,
pour the butter mixture over the nuts and toss until coated.
2 Place nuts on a jellyroll pan and toast for about 20 minutes or until browned. Shake the
pan occasionally to be sure the nuts are toasting evenly.
3 Drain on paper towels before serving. Do a taste test and add salt, if desired. Store in an
airtight container at room temperature.

Why not water?
Have you ever thought of water as a snack? Did
you know that by the time your brain tells you
that you’re thirsty, your body is already begin-
ning to be dehydrated? I’m talking about lack of
hydration — not lost-in-the-desert dehydrated.
Keeping your body well hydrated and your low-
carb lifestyle in tow is even more achievable if
you drink plenty of water.
If you have a craving mid-morning, grab that
water bottle and gulp down some of the clear,
revitalizing stuff, and then have your low-carb
snack. Drinking water will soon become a habit
for you, and you’ll be amazed what it does to the
scales. Guess you’d better “just add water” to
the snack list.

T Nutty Popcorn
Popcorn is a bit of a strange bird. Some folks can eat it and not gain an ounce, and some
people (like me) gain a pound just looking at the stuff. So pay attention for bloating and
watch the scale after you eat this stuff even though this recipe has a measly 5 net grams
of carbs. Whatever your personal experience, it sure is acceptable for a special treat.
The popcorn in this recipe is especially satisfying and especially crunchy with the addi-
tion of nuts. I’m sure that after just reading the recipe, you’re going to think of all kinds
of variations of this basic low-carb munchie. You can save dollars if you air-pop your
own popcorn. It’s so easy, and it isn’t even messy, so give it a whirl. The upside is the
freshest of fresh popcorn without preservatives. This fun treat is featured in the color
section of the book.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 9 servings (1 cup each)
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon curry powder
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
8 cups popped popcorn
1 cup pecan pieces
1 In a small skillet, melt the butter until it bubbles, being careful not to let it brown or
burn. Add the curry powder and salt and stir.
2 With popcorn in a large bowl, add the nuts and drizzle the butter mixture over the pop-
corn and pecan pieces. Toss until well coated.
Variation: For seasoned popcorn of a different flavor, try substituting the curry powder 
and the nuts with 2 teaspoons of freshly chopped chives, 2 teaspoons of fresh dill weed, 
2 teaspoons of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, and 1 teaspoon of celery salt.

T Maple-Cinnamon Almond Snack
This snack is quick to fix and is pleasing to your sweet tooth. When you have a sweet
craving, grab a few of these tasty nuts for a special treat that’s almost like a low-carb
candy. Indulge in this snack, because the carb counts are on your side. A word of warn-
ing, though: Don’t eat all the nuts in one sitting just because this recipe is labeled low-
carb and sugar free. If you want to have a stash of these almonds, simply double the
recipe.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Baking time: 12 minutes
Yield: 4 1⁄4-cup servings
1 cup raw almonds
3 tablespoons sugar-free
maple syrup
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the almonds, syrup, and cinnamon until the
almonds are well coated.
3 Line a shallow pan with parchment paper. Bake the almonds in the pan for 10 to 12 min-
utes, stirring a couple times. The glaze will dry on the nuts during baking.
4 Let the almonds cool and break apart, if necessary. (If there’s high humidity, they may
be a bit sticky, but if it’s very dry day, they’ll be almost perfect.) Store in an airtight con-
tainer at room temperature if they make it that far!

Vegging out
It’s the most incredible thing I’ve ever experienced: When you eat more green
stuff, you crave more green stuff. I know that sounds bizarre, and if you’ve
never experienced it, you’re probably shaking your head in disbelief. But it’s
true. If you get in the habit of snacking on broccoli and green leafy stuff, your
cravings will shift to actually wanting some fresh veggies for a snack. Try it,
and you’ll be amazed. This shift in cravings won’t happen overnight, but stick
with it, and you’ll be longing for veggies in no time. I double dare you to try it.

Celery Stick Tuna Delight
The results here are delightful to look at and munch into. The combination of ingredi-
ents is so colorful that you’ll want to party on with your low-carb lifestyle and enjoy the
low carb count in this festive treat. If you want to tote this snack along with you, just
carry the celery in a resealable plastic bag and the tuna combo in a little plastic con-
tainer, and put everything together when you’re ready to munch. This recipe calls for
shredded cabbage, carrots, and zucchini. Make sure you shred them very fine. I have a
little 21⁄2 cup mini food processor that I use to shred them into shape.
Preparation time: 12 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
3-ounce package cream cheese, room
temperature
1 tablespoon plain yogurt
1⁄2 teaspoon dried basil
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic salt with parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
3-ounce pouch albacore tuna
1⁄2 cup finely shredded red cabbage
1⁄2 cup finely shredded carrot 
1⁄4 cup finely shredded zucchini, unpeeled
12 celery sticks (4 inches long)
1 In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, yogurt, basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper,
mixing until well blended.
2 In a second small bowl, toss the tuna, cabbage, carrot, and zucchini until well combined.
3 Stir the cream cheese mixture into the tuna mixture.
4 Heap the tuna mixture into and onto the celery sticks — there’s a bunch of filling here.
You can serve immediately or refrigerate the prepared sticks for about a half hour so
the mixture chills and is even crunchier with the crispy celery combination. If you
prefer, store the tuna mixture separately and heap it into the celery when you’re ready
to serve and snack.

T Veggie Wedgie Crisps
This snack is great hot, but I love it cold as well. You can take wedgies along as leftovers
for a snack at work. Or you can prepare everything in advance and keep them in the
fridge until you crave a snack at home. Just pop them in the oven. Veggie Wedgie Crisps
are like a mini snack pizza (only better)!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 18 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 cup small fresh broccoli florets
1 package (3 ounces) cream cheese, room
temperature
1⁄2 teaspoon dried basil leaves
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder with parsley flakes
2 8-inch low-carb whole-wheat tortillas
1⁄2 cup fresh chopped mushrooms
1⁄2 cup thin strips red, yellow, and green bell
pepper 
1⁄2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Trim off the bottoms of broccoli florets. Cut the florets into quarters and place them in
a mini food processor. Chop the broccoli until it reaches a very fine consistency — like
broccoli sand! You should have about 1⁄2 cup of broccoli at this point.
3 In a small bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, basil, and garlic powder, mixing
well with a fork. Spread the mixture evenly on both tortillas. Place the tortillas on a
heavy cookie sheet.
4 Sprinkle the broccoli on top of the cream cheese mixture, spreading it evenly. Add the
mushrooms and strips of pepper on top of the tortillas. Bake for 10 minutes.
5 Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees and remove the cookie sheet from the oven.
Divide the cheese evenly, sprinkling on both tortillas.
6 Return the tortillas to the oven for another 5 minutes. The cheese should be oozing and
melted. Cut the tortilla into wedges and serve immediately.
Variation: Add fresh sliced Roma tomatoes on top after removing the tortillas from the
oven, drizzle them with a little olive oil, and sprinkle on some freshly chopped basil. Talk
about waking up your taste buds!

Skinny Dipping
The possible combinations of low-carb dips are limited only by your wildest
culinary notions. You can take a base of yogurt, cottage cheese, sour cream,
or cream cheese and mix it with a variety of soft cheeses, herbs, and spices
in dips that could fill an entire cookbook. You can choose fruit dips, veggie
dips, hot dips, or cold dips — dips for parties or dips for snacking. Dips are
for more than potato chips! Dippin’ fresh fruits and veggies is so much better.
Quick slim dippin’
You don’t need a recipe with a list of 12 ingredients and a lengthy preparation
time for the end result to taste really good. Slim ingredients can make mighty
tasty stuff. Try some of the following quick combinations, and feel free to
experiment using these base ingredients:
 Yogurt
• With grated horseradish and fresh chopped Italian parsley
• With finely chopped cucumber and a little dill
• With a little fresh orange juice, some lemon zest, and a packet of
Splenda sugar substitute (this dip can also be made with sour
cream rather than yogurt)
 Sour cream
• With dill weed and chopped garlic
• With fresh, crisp bacon crumbles
• With apricot sugar-free preserves
 Cottage cheese
• With leftover sauces, seasoned to taste
• With a spot of Dijon mustard and some minced fresh chives
 Cream cheese
• With a splash of whipped cream to thin just a tad and some
chopped pecans
• With finely chopped fresh green onions chopped fine
My favorite accompaniments for these concoctions are — you guessed it,
veggies. Celery, carrot sticks, zucchini sticks, cucumbers, blanched aspara-
gus, cauliflower, radishes, snow peas, yellow squash, Brussels sprouts, broc-
coli, and broccoflower all work great.

T Three-Cheese Roasted Garlic Dip
This dip is just awesome with fresh veggies. Feel free to substitute any of your favorite
cheeses for one or all of the ones I list here. No matter what you substitute, you 
just can’t go wrong with this recipe. See the color section of the book for a serving 
suggestion.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Refrigeration time: 4 hours
Yield: 20 servings
2 medium heads of garlic
31⁄2 ounces goat cheese
2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese,
room temperature
2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut off the tops of the garlic heads, exposing the tops
of the cloves. Place the garlic in a small baking pan and bake for 45 minutes, or until
garlic is very tender.
2 Remove the garlic from the pan and cool completely. Squeeze the garlic into a small
bowl and then mash with a fork.
3 Combine the goat cheese and cream cheese in a medium mixing bowl and beat until
smooth. (You can also use a food processor for this step.) Stir in the blue cheese, garlic,
and thyme.
4 Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to let the flavors mingle.
5 Serve the cheese dip with crispy fresh vegetables. This dip is especially nice served
with red and yellow bell pepper strips, cucumber slices, zucchini, and broccoli.

I love to make this for a quick sweet snack when a craving hits me and just
won’t give up. If you close your eyes, you’ll think you’re eating cheesecake!
Take 1⁄2 of an 8-ounce package of cream cheese. Add 1 packet of Splenda and a
couple drops of pure vanilla extract. Take a fork and stir it all up (it’ll be hard
at first). If you want to really jazz it up, add a tad of sugar-free preserves. It’s a
great quick sweet-tooth fix.

T Broccolomole Dip
Spell check had a really tough time as I was writing this one, but you’re going to love
this recipe regardless of its crazy name. This dip is a sister in looks to guacamole, but
its color is a little brighter green. Broccoli is the ultimate veggie and has a rave rating in
the low-carb lifestyle. So whip up this skinny recipe and dip in with fresh veggies, or
treat yourself to some low-carb tortilla chips. This dip is featured in the color section of
the book.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Refrigeration time: 3 to 4 hours
Yield: 8 servings
2 cups precut fresh broccoli
1⁄4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon minced onion
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
3 tablespoon lemon juice
1⁄4 teaspoon chili powder (more to taste)
1 Cook the fresh broccoli to crisp-tender in your steamer basket. Run cold water over it
and place the broccoli in the refrigerator to chill for about 30 minutes.
2 Combine the broccoli, sour cream, onion, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and chili powder in
your food processor and blend until smooth.
3 Refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
4 Serve with fresh, crisp veggies.

Here’s another quick dip: Combine and beat until smooth 12 ounces cottage
cheese, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 3⁄4 teaspoon
garlic salt, and a dash of freshly ground black pepper. Dip in with any of your
favorite veggies.
For a very cool presentation, serve your homemade dips in a hollow green or
red pepper or in a couple red cabbage leaves. If you’re having guests, you can
make individual dishes out of large red cabbage leaves, serving raw vegeta-
bles in one and dip in the other. Experiment and come up with your own cre-
ative serving dish.

Fruity choices
Fruits have been controversial in some low-carb lifestyles. Living low-carb for
life is all about balance and not depriving yourself of foods that are proven to
be good for you, such as fruit. However, some fruits are loaded with carbs, so
you can be selective in choosing fruits that work for you. You can choose
what fruits to eat according to what fits the healthy low-carb lifestyle that
works for you. If you’re eating fruit every day and the scale starts creeping
up, then cut back to every other day or maybe three times a week. If you’re
highly sugar sensitive, then the natural sugar will have a bit of an effect on
you, and it could come about in weight gain. I encourage you, however, for
the ultimate healthy low-carb lifestyle to eat fruit! Here are some raw fruits
that are lower in carbs than others and are thus lower on the glycemic index
(refer to Chapter 2 for an explanation of how the GI fits into your low-carb
lifestyle).
 Apples
 Apricots
 Blackberries
 Blueberries
 Cantaloupe
 Cherries
 Figs
 Grapes
 Honeydew
 Nectarines
 Oranges
 Peaches
 Pears
 Plums
 Raspberries
 Rhubarb
 Strawberries
 Tangerines

T Ricotta Dip for Fruits
This dip is so delicious that it may be difficult to keep yourself from sitting by the bowl
and eating the whole thing, but please restrain yourself. Be a dainty dipper and eat just
the right amount. Make sure that it’s well chilled before you serve it (if you can keep
your fingers out of it). You can even prepare it the night before and take it with you to
work to snack on during the day. Expect some rave reviews on this recipe if you serve it
to guests — but you may not want to share! Heartier fruits like apples, pears, nectarines,
and pineapple work well with this.
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Refrigeration time: 1 hour
Yield: 13⁄4 cups (14 servings of 2 tablespoons each)
15 ounces ricotta cheese
2 packets Splenda sugar substitute
1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract
11⁄2 teaspoons grated orange peel
3⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 Combine the ricotta, Splenda, vanilla extract, orange peel, and cinnamon in your food
processor and puree until very smooth.
2 Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover tightly, and refrigerate until serving or snacking
time.
Variation: You can also spread this dip on a low-carb tortilla. Sprinkle some red raspber-
ries or strawberries in the middle of the tortilla, roll it up, and you have a great snack. Use
any fruit you want to enhance this low-carb tortilla snack.

T
hey’re everywhere! You’ll find very few restau-
rants and fast food establishments where you
can’t get a wrap, and a lot of these restaurants
offer specific, low-carb wraps as alternatives to
sandwiches that are packed with carbs. Call them
trendy if you want, but I think wraps are brilliant — not to mention delicious.
You can build an entire low-carb meal that’s satisfying and easy to prepare
around tasty, nutritional wraps. And did I mention versatility? Wraps cater to
no specific mealtime — you can enjoy them for breakfast, lunch, dinner, as a
snack, or on the run.
Wrapping Your Taste Buds Around a
Low-Carb Favorite
If you can roll it up, it’s a wrap! Depending on what you’re wrapping, you have
myriad choices for the “wrapper.” Low-carb tortillas are probably the most
popular, most accessible, and quickest option for a wrapper. Makers of tor-
tillas have jumped on the low-carb bandwagon and created some delicious
low-carb tortillas, many with 3 grams of carbs or less. Tortillas are a great
staple to have on hand if you’re in a hurry or want a quick, healthy snack.
Tortillas are always best warm. Just pop them in the microwave on high for
about 10 seconds. They’ll be warm and ready to roll!

But tortillas aren’t the only medium for making wraps, so now it’s time to
think outside the box. You’ll forever be “en-wraptured” by all your low-carb
wrapper options:
 Egg crepes: These wrappers are light as a feather, and they complement
any filling you wish to use. Wrap them up with veggies or use them as
dessert wraps (see the “Raising the Wrap Bar with Egg Crepes” section
later in the chapter).
 Leafy green or red lettuce: Because leaf lettuce is pliable, yet fresh and
crisp, it makes a great wrap. If you aren’t accustomed to using different
lettuces as wrappers, leaf is a great place to start.
 Romaine lettuce: This lettuce takes on its own robust flavor, so be sure
to use it with something that tends to be a bit spicy so the romaine
doesn’t overwhelm the filling. Also, make sure that you cut off the rigid
spine at the bottom of the romaine. You’ll find that romaine is a less
bendable lettuce, but get over it because its flavor with fillings is worth
this wrap being a bit messy.
 Iceberg lettuce: It isn’t the most nutritious lettuce, but the carb counts
are great. If you have a hot ground meat filling you want to corral in a
wrap, the cool crispness of iceberg is a sure fit. (Check out the Cheese-
Stuffed Ground Round Patties recipe in Chapter 11.)
 Boston lettuce: With its round shape, this lettuce is perfect for wraps.
 Radicchio: Some people absolutely adore this stuff, and some turn up
their noses and run the other way due its slightly bitter flavor. (You can
read more about radicchio and other greens in Chapter 8.) Radicchio
complements grilled fillings nicely.
 Napa cabbage: This type of cabbage has very broad leaves but is a little
on the thin side. Napa can make a great wrap, but use two leaves to pre-
vent your wrap from breaking apart.
 Red and green cabbage: The wide, round leaves make red and green
cabbage perfect for rolling up fillings. Both cabbages have distinctive fla-
vors all their own, so the choice is yours. The red cabbage can make a
great presentation for guests.
 Cheese: You can use any kind of sliceable cheese as a wrapper — and a
great wrapper at that. The trick with cheeses is to have them almost
room temperature to make the slices more pliable and easier to handle
so they don’t crack on you.
 Sliced ham, turkey, chicken, prosciutto, and salami: These sliced
meats make great wraps that give you endless combinations for wrap-
ping it up. If you use thinly-sliced deli meat, go with two or three slices
to make sure your filling stays in place and makes it to your mouth. See
the Sushi Under (Low-Carb) Wraps recipe in this section for one example.

Sushi Under (Low-Carb) Wraps
These clever little wraps are soooo tasty — and portable! They’re perfect when you’re
having a craving or it’s still 45 minutes until lunchtime. You can substitute all kinds of
ingredients in these simple sushi wraps (check out my suggestions at the end of the
recipe), and it’s quick. You’ll get accustomed to healthy low-carb snacks in no time
when they’re this yummy and easy.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 slices deli ham
4 tablespoons whipped cream
cheese
1 small cucumber, quartered
lengthwise and seeded
1 Remove any excess moisture from the ham with a paper towel. Carefully spread each
ham slice with 1 tablespoon cream cheese right up to the edges.
2 Remove any excess moisture from the cucumber slices with a paper towel. Place a
cucumber slice at the edge of a ham slice, and roll it up tightly. Gently press the edge of
the ham to seal. Repeat the process with each of the remaining ham and cucumber slices.
3 Wrap each roll in plastic wrap, and place them in the fridge until it’s time to munch.
Then cut the roll in slices resembling sushi.
Variation: In place of the ham, you can use slices of turkey breast or chicken breast. You
can also try rolling up slices of your favorite cheeses with fillings. Try adding fresh chives,
any herb or spice that you love, or even a tad of sugar-free apricot jam to the sour cream.
The veggies you choose can be crispy red peppers, a couple pieces of blanched asparagus
(it’s great cold), or leftover long green beans with some chopped red pepper. And the
spread can change from cream cheese to homemade mayonnaise (see recipes later) or
bottled or homemade dressings!

If you’re taking the lettuce route for your wraps, rinse and spin it ahead of
time and pop it in a zipper-type plastic bag to make sure that the lettuce is
very crisp. No one likes limp lettuce. I’ve done this forever, and it seems that
the little bit of moisture that’s left on the lettuce after spinning and zipping
makes it extra crispy as it sits in the fridge.
If you’re taking the tortilla route, and the wrap is going to sit for several
hours (say you’re taking them for lunch), the trick to keeping your low-carb
tortilla from getting soggy is to put a layer of lettuce on top of the tortilla and
then add your fillings.

Filling in the Wraps
Making top-notch wraps depends on more than just the wrapper. What’s
inside is left only to your imagination, what’s in your pantry, or what you
have left over in the fridge. Here are some tips to keep in mind as you fanta-
size about your fillings:
 Opt for variety in texture: Using ingredients with different textures
tends to wake up your taste buds and leave you more satisfied.
 Balance things out: You don’t want your wrap to taste like dry card-
board, so balance things out by adding some moist stuff in with that left-
over turkey.
 Develop theme wraps: In other words, pursue a main flavor and
enhance from there. Like most things in life, you need a base to build
from, and wrap building is no exception.
Time to get your brain thinking about all the foods you can wrap up. It’s a
quick four-part process:
1. Just start with one or more main ingredient from this list:
• Chopped, hard-cooked eggs
• Albacore tuna in a pouch
• Salmon in a sealed bag
• Canned shrimp
• Smoked ham
• Turkey strips
• Chicken strips
• Deli roast beef
• Veggies galore
• Salad mixes
• Fruits
2. Add a dressing or dressing combo:
• Plain yogurt
• Mayonnaise
• Cream cheese
• Sour cream
250
Part III: Expanding Everyday Low-Carb Cooking 

• Italian or ranch dressing
• Dijon mustard
• Horseradish
• Peanut butter
• Yogurt and sour cream combo
• Caesar dressing
• Sweetened cream cheese (use a sugar substitute of your choice)
3. Select some crunchy stir-ins and sprinkle-ons:
• Alfalfa sprouts
• Sliced bell peppers
• Chopped cucumber
• Chopped green onions
• Crumbled and shredded cheeses
• Crispy bacon
• Water chestnuts
• Pears and apples
• Herbs and spices
• Nuts
• Whipped cream
4. Grab a low-carb, whole-wheat tortilla and wrap it up.
Voilà — you’re a wrap star!
Be a copycat. When you’re out and about in restaurants — whether they’re of
the sit-down or fast-food variety — check out what’s on the menu (besides
what you’re ordering). You can learn a lot and possibly discover some awe-
some wrap ideas. Lots of eateries have low-carb wraps on the menu. Just
because the presentations are gorgeous doesn’t mean the preparation is diffi-
cult. And if low-carb wraps aren’t on the menu, then use your carb smarts
and copycat a low-carb version. You can do it!
Wraps are so quick and easy that they work well as appetizers if you have
surprise guests. Just roll them up and cut them in bite-sized pieces. Use a
combination of fillings, and you can put together an awesome appetizer tray
in no time.

T Peanut Butter and 
Cream Cheese Wraps
Is your sweet tooth talking to you? Here’s a delightfully refreshing little treat that’ll
make you smile. If you don’t indulge too often, it’s a great sweet fix that’s really easy on
the carb counts. If you prefer, please leave out the sugar substitute: These wraps are
perfectly delightful without it. Cut diagonally in bite-size pieces to savor it and make the
treat last longer.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 wraps
1 packet Splenda sugar substitute
1⁄4 cup cream cheese, softened
1⁄2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1⁄2 cup natural crunchy peanut butter
4 low-carb whole-wheat tortilla wraps
1 cup thinly sliced fresh strawberries
1 In a small bowl or cup, mix the Splenda with the cream cheese and vanilla until well
blended.
2 Add the peanut butter and swirl together (this doesn’t have to be mixed well — just
swirly).
3 Spread one-fourth of the mixture evenly on 4 low-carb whole-wheat tortillas. Sprinkle
with 1⁄4 cup strawberries each.
4 Roll the tortillas burrito-style (see the “Shaping Up Your Tortillas” section, later in this
chapter).
Variation: This cream cheese, Splenda, and vanilla mixture (without the peanut butter)
can be used for many treat wraps. You can add a little sugar-free jam or preserves to give it
a special hidden flavor or just add a dash of your favorite sugar-free syrup (in place of the
vanilla). If you want a maple flavor, use sugar-free maple syrup. I’ve been known to mix
plain cream cheese with vanilla and Splenda and indulge in a couple teaspoons to ward
off a sweet attack. If you close your eyes, you think you’re eating cheesecake.

If you stuff your wrap so much that you can’t roll it, how are you going to get
it to your mouth? If you’re on the go, you better pack an extra shirt. Don’t be
stingy on your wrap stuffings — just insightful. The more wraps you create,
the better stuffer you’ll become — especially after you’ve sent a few tops to
the dry cleaners. You may have a second wrap, you know, because they’re
low-carb healthy after all.

Tossing salad into the wrap mix
Salad wraps are great, the variety is unending, and they’re quick and easy.
Next time you’re at the grocery store, pick up a combo bag of prewashed let-
tuces (see Chapter 8), a bag of shredded cabbage or brocco-cabbage, Italian
dressing, and some feta cheese. Put the lettuce, cabbage, and cheese in a
bowl and toss with the Italian dressing. Warm your low-carb whole-wheat tor-
tilla and fill it with your salad combo. You’ve just made a healthy, low-carb
meal in a matter of minutes.
You can choose a different kind of mix every time you pick up a new bag of
prewashed greens — Caesar salad, spinach, mesclun mix, baby greens, and
the list goes on. Spend a little time in that section of the produce department,
and you’ll be amazed at the ingredients that jump out at you.
Cheeses in salad wraps are like the icing on the cake. You can enjoy so many
flavors of cheeses all at once. Experiment with a delightful Italian blend of
shredded cheeses that includes combos of mozzarella, Romano, provolone,
Parmesan, and Asiago cheeses. Wake up your taste buds.
Securing wraps in style
Want to roll up your wraps so they don’t come undone? A creative way to do
so, especially if you’re entertaining company, is to wrap the green part of a
green onion around the wrap a couple times, tying the binding in knots. Place
your wraps on a platter, add some colored kale for garnish, and you have a
very special presentation.
Wraps to go are the best. Make sure to roll them tightly and secure them in
plastic wrap so that they hold their shape and they’re ready to go into the
microwave at the office or wherever you’re headed. Be sure to remove them
from the plastic wrap before heating in the microwave. To ensure safe travel
for your wrap, you may want to add an overcoat of aluminum foil to hold it all
together.
Pay attention when you’re heating or reheating wraps in your microwave.
Plastic wrap is great stuff to hold a wrap securely while storing in the fridge
or toting in your lunch box. But before popping your wrap in the microwave,
undress it and get rid of that plastic wrap. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
warns not to let plastic wrap touch any food during microwaving. It seems
there are some little rascals called adipates that make the plastic wrap stick
to bowls. Controversy over one particular adipate found in the plastic has
been bubbling for decades. So better to be safe than sorry: Don’t let plastic
wrap touch foods during microwaving.

Shaping Up Your Tortillas
There are a few little tricks to tuck away for when you shape your wraps. I
know the image of a rolled tortilla is the most common, but you may have
some fillings that you don’t want oozing out the ends. Get a sample tortilla
and have a wrap-folding practice session with the following methods:
 Roll-up wrap: This method is the most common. Put your filling down
the middle of the tortilla and spread it from top to bottom to form a long
line. Don’t take it all the way to the edge. Start at one side of the tortilla
and fold the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in a little to secure the fill-
ing. After tucking, gently pull the filling toward you with the tortilla and
begin rolling. It’s a wrap — time to eat!
 Half-moon wrap: Spread your filling in a half-moon shape over half of
the tortilla. Don’t spread the filling all the way to the edges, or you’ll
experience oozing. Then just fold the empty side over the filled side —
like a quesadilla. This type of wrap is a bit tricky to pick up sometimes,
so you may want to keep it on your plate and eat it with a fork.
 Burrito wrap: Put your filling down the middle of the tortilla. Spread it
out so it’s like a thick line but not touching either side of the tortilla.
Take the bottom third of the tortilla, and fold it up over the filling. Take
the left side of the tortilla and fold it to the middle; then do the same
with the right side. The top of the wrap is open. See Figure 15-1.

That’s a
wrap — a
leakproof
wrap.

Cheesy Hot Steak Wraps
The original cheese-steak sandwich is believed to have its roots in 1930s Philadelphia.
That sandwich recipe just doesn’t fit in the low-carb genre, but because I love it, I made
a few adjustments. Now it’s carb friendly and even easier to eat because it’s a wrap.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 8 minutes
Yield: 4 wraps
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄2 clove garlic, minced fine
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 cup chopped yellow onion
2 cups green pepper slices
1⁄2 pound deli roast beef, cut in thin slices
1⁄4 cup Italian salad dressing
4 low-carb whole-wheat tortillas
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 Place the olive oil in a heavy skillet. Over medium heat, add the garlic, salt, and pepper,
stirring to mingle the spices with the olive oil. Add the onions and peppers. Cook until
the peppers are crisp-tender. This should take no longer than 5 minutes.
2 Add the roast beef and salad dressing to the skillet, mixing well, and cook until the roast
beef is heated through, about 3 minutes.
3 Spoon one-fourth of the beef mixture evenly down the middle of each tortilla. Sprinkle
each tortilla with 1⁄4 cup cheese and roll them up. Make sure to work rather quickly,
because the heat from the beef mixture makes the cheese melt inside your wrap.

T Spicy Black Soybean Wraps
Black soybeans are one of the greatest foods you’ll discover in your low-carb life. For a
1⁄2 cup of black soybeans, the net carb count is a whopping 1 gram. Plus they’re very
nutritious and full of fiber. Here’s a great spicy wrap that you can easily adjust to your
liking.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 wraps
1 In a large, heavy skillet combine the beans, onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, tomato
paste, chiles, and tomato juice. Stirring constantly, bring the ingredients to a simmer.
2 Cover and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes. Check often and make sure there’s
enough liquid so the mixture doesn’t burn. If in doubt, add a couple teaspoons of water
to keep from sticking. During the last few minutes of cooking, uncover and let all the
juices evaporate.
3 Remove the skillet from the heat and mash the beans to a chunky texture with a fork.
4 Heat the tortillas in the microwave on high for about 10 seconds per tortilla. I heat them
individually.
5 Spoon 2 heaping tablespoons of filling onto each tortilla and top with the lettuce, toma-
toes, and cheese. Roll ’em up and serve.

Raising the Wrap Bar with Crepes
Egg crepes for wraps — are you shaking your head? Well, stop. After you get
the hang of whipping up these easy and light creations, you’ll be wrapping
them around everything. They take only minutes to make, and you can enjoy
egg crepe wraps either hot or cold. Expand your wrap horizon and treat your
taste buds to variety.
15-ounce can Eden black
soybeans, rinsed and drained
1 small yellow onion,
chopped fine
1 clove garlic, minced
1⁄4 to 1⁄2 teaspoon crushed red
pepper flakes
2 teaspoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons chopped mild
green chiles
2 tablespoons tomato juice
6 low-carb whole-wheat
tortillas
3 cups finely shredded lettuce
4 ripe Roma tomatoes, diced
1 cup shredded cheddar
cheese

Kick-start your low-carb day with egg crepes filled with Canadian bacon and a
variety of cheeses with sprinkles of green onion. Egg crepes are so versatile
that you can even spread them with sugar-free preserves and a dollop of
whipped cream for a sweet treat. The carb count is low on low-carb tortillas,
but it drops to almost zero for egg crepe wraps — try that one on for size.
If you research crepe batters, you’ll find all kinds of variations. The reason
I’ve created this basic egg crepe recipe for you is because the tasty crepes
are so low in carb counts that they allow you to spend your carb budget with
your choice of fillings — breakfast, lunch, dinner, great snacks, and sinfully
delicious desserts, all wrapped up in this low-carb crepe.
Kicking out egg crepes
Crepes can be tricky to get the hang of at first, but with just a little practice,
you’ll have tons of new low-carb wraps at your fingertips. And when you’re
living the low-carb lifestyle, variety is definitely the spice. Don’t let crepe
batter scare you. It’s just a bunch of eggs. Uncharted courses are always a tad
intimidating, but jump right in and you’ll be creating all kinds of great low-
carb crepe variations — and smiling as you go.
A few things to keep in mind when making the basic low-carb egg crepe
recipe I include in this chapter:
 Make sure that your crepe pan is hot before adding the batter. Since
the pan is hot, the crepe will begin to cook instantly even though the
pan is off the stove for a few seconds to start things off.
 Perfect your swirling motion. To make a crepe, you pour your batter in
the middle of your crepe pan, take the pan off the heat source, and swirl
the crepe batter to cover the bottom of the pan. See Figure 15-2.
 Work on your spatula skills. While the crepe is back on the burner, set-
ting up and cooking, take a nonstick spatula and carefully begin working
around the outside of the crepe, lifting the edges all the way around. The
crepe will set up from the outside in, so you want to simply lift the edge
a bit, until you meet sticky resistance. At that point, move the spatula
around the crepe and repeat. Eventually, you’ll be able to gently free the
entire crepe. You’ll be working quickly as the total time to cook an egg
crepe is one minute or less.
 Stack away! When you’re done cooking both sides of the crepe (the
second side will only take 10 to 15 seconds), slide the crepe off the pan
onto a plate. Continue making as many crepes as you wish and stack
them one on top of each other. Since the egg crepes have no flour in
them, you don’t have to worry about them sticking together as many
other crepe variations tend to do.

T Basic Egg Crepes with Veggies
I present veggies with this basic egg crepe recipe, but get creative and enjoy another
layer of low-carb food. Remember that each of these egg crepes has only 1 gram of net
carbs. Your choice of fillings is what determines how much the carb counts increase
from there. Here, I’ve whipped up a sweet-and-spicy sauce with a few veggies as one
idea of a tasty filling with respectable carb counts. Use this basic recipe to strike out in
all directions of wrapping it up with egg crepes. The sky is pretty well the limit with egg
crepes because they’re so low-carb user friendly. I think you’ll be delighted with this
new addition to your low-carb lifestyle.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 crepe wraps
12 fresh asparagus spears
2 medium carrots
2 green onions
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon soy sauce
3 tablespoons sugar-free orange marmalade
5 eggs
1 tablespoon heavy cream
1⁄8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Cut the asparagus spears into 3-inch pieces. Cut the carrots into thin strips and then
into 3-inch pieces. Cut the green onions into 2-inch pieces.
2 Using a vegetable steamer, steam the asparagus, carrots, and green onions for 5 to 
7 minutes. Don’t overcook; you want the veggies to be crisp-tender.
3 In a small bowl, stir together the ginger, soy sauce, and marmalade and set aside.
4 Beat the eggs, heavy cream, cream of tartar, and salt together until blended, but you
don’t want them to froth.
5 Spray your crepe pan with nonstick cooking spray. Heat the crepe pan until hot.
6 Measure 1⁄4 cup of the egg mixture and pour it into the center of the pan. Lift the pan and
swirl the egg mixture for even distribution.
7 Place the crepe pan back on stove and cook over medium heat — you don’t want the
crepes to cook too quickly or to burn.
8 Cook until the egg mixture starts to set around the edges and on the bottom. As it’s set-
ting, lift gently the crepe around the edges using your nonstick spatula. This helps form
the crepe and enhance even cooking. You’ll have to cook the crepe on the first side for
only 45 seconds to 1 minute.

9 Flip the crepe over to the other side and let it sit over the heat for just 10 to 15 seconds.
Slide it out of the crepe pan and onto a plate and do it all over again for the next crepe.
10 Be sure to spray your crepe pan each time with nonstick cooking spray. You’ll have egg
crepes in one minute or less per crepe!
11 When all your crepes are cooked, spread about 2 teaspoons of the sweet-and-spicy
sauce down the center of each egg crepe. Place a combination of the veggies on the
crepe and fold it burrito style with one end open (see the section, “Shaping Up Your
Tortillas,” earlier in the chapter). Serve with the remaining sauce on the side.
Tip: You may get 5 crepes out of this recipe, so don’t be surprised. It all depends on the size
of the eggs that you’re using. If you get an extra crepe, save it and fill it with some leftovers
for lunch the next day or make it a dessert crepe.

If you want sweet egg crepes, simply add some sugar substitute to the basic
egg crepe batter I outline in this chapter. You can make a ton of delicious
desserts and sweet treats with egg crepes. Here’s one idea: Spread the sweet
crepes with sugar-free apricot jam and roll them up. Place them under the
broiler long enough to just heat them through and brown ever so lightly. Heat
about 1⁄4 cup brandy in a small pan and pour over the crepes. Carefully ignite,
and when you’re sure all flames are out, serve immediately with a dollop of
freshly whipped cream.

Taking crepe making seriously
Get serious about making egg crepes. They’re a real treat to your low-carb
healthy lifestyle. You can find quality crepe pans at your local cookware store
or on the Internet (see Figure 15-3). A crepe pan makes things easier because
of its perfect shape and size. Also, the design of the crepe pan allows the heat
to be distributed more evenly while cooking your crepe. As you know, any
specialty item or gadget in your kitchen makes your job easier and more fun.

s-l-o-w m-o-t-i-o-n — or at least slower motion. Slow food is comfort food
(which can be right at home in a low carb-lifestyle). You’re going to get very
spoiled when you use your slow cooker on a regular basis. It can provide you
with a meal that’s ready when you walk through the door, and it gives you a
ton of flexibility. Coming home after a long day to the wonderful smells of
crockery cooking is like having a gremlin in the kitchen. I’m so hooked that I
even use my slow cooker on the weekends when I’m off for a day of shopping.
Just a little self-discipline and pre-planning when it comes to preparing meals
in your slow cooker can make your low-carb lifestyle even more enjoyable in
multiple ways — from enjoying tasty meals to having more time for other
activities. Try using the slow cooker. I think you’ll like it. And in this chapter, 
I make it easy to get started.
Don’t forget that slow cooking isn’t just for the daytime. If you’re off to Aunt
Martha’s for a family gathering the next day, you can let something cook all
night and just take the slow cooker with you. Some slow cooker carriers are
made especially for such occasions.

A Quick and Simple Guide 
to Low-Carb Slow Cooking
Because slow cooking is so kind to meats and vegetables, your choices of
what to cook are almost unlimited. Many of the great foods you can enjoy
with your low-carb lifestyle take on a new dimension with slow cooking.
You can prepare a great entrée in your slow cooker, whip up a quick salad,
and you have a meal in minutes because your little silent chef has been cook-
ing all day. Or, you can add the veggies in with your meat and cook them alto-
gether. Another option that you may laugh at but will understand when you
become a low-carb slow-cooking fan is to consider being the proud owner of
two slow cookers — a small one and a large one. That way, you can simmer
soup while you cook an entrée, or you can cook a meat dish in one slow
cooker and cook a vegetable in another. Options are always nice.
Profiling slow cookers
The slow cooker’s resumé indicates a profile with many fine qualities:
 A slow cooker works very well completely unsupervised, and it’s safe to
leave home alone.
 Not only is it a silent chef, but it also makes your house smell cozy and
homey.
 Years of testing indicate that a slow cooker has a great track record in
proven reliability.
 Slow cookers don’t mind waiting for you to get accustomed to using
them. They know that after you get in the groove of slow cooking, you’re
hooked.
 Unlike stove cooking, slow cookers don’t overcook meats and veggies.
But you have to steer the timing. If you leave it cooking for 20 hours, and
your food is all shriveled up, don’t blame the slow cooker! This is where
a slow cooker with a timer shines. (See the next section, “Sizing up the
crockery cooker crew,” for more about hardware options.)
 A slow cooker can magically make less tender cuts of meat melt in your
mouth. Fact is, slow cookers prefer less tender cuts so they can excel in
their jobs.
 Slow cookers don’t ask much — just that you leave the lid on.
 Slow cookers prefer not to be interrupted with a lot of stirring.
 A slow cooker is very efficient — when you’re cooking on low, you’re
using less energy than most light bulbs.

Sizing up the crockery cooker crew
You can find a slew of slow cookers on the market, and whether you choose
one because you like the color or the little flowers on the crock, or because
chrome goes with your kitchen (all fine criteria that I too have used), I want
you to know one thing: Size matters in a choosing a slow cooker.
Slow cookers come in a number of sizes, and the one that works best for
you depends on whether you’re cooking for one, two, or an entire family. If
you’ve ever tried to shove a 5-pound roast into a small slow cooker, then you
can relate. For optimum results, don’t fill your slow cooker more than three-
quarters full. If you’re cramming your slow cooker to the top, it may be time
to look into buying a larger one.
The world of slow cookers is changing all the time, with vast improvements
over the old models. You may want to develop a “slow cooker wish list” to
have handy for those special occasions when no one knows what to buy you
for a gift. Here’s a little list of shapes, sizes, and bells and whistles that are
available and that you may want to check out depending on what you want
your slow cooker to do (no, it won’t clean the house):
 Size: Slow-cooker capacities start as small as 16 ounces. More standard
sizes are 3.5 quart, 5.3 quart, 6 quart, 6.5 quart, and 7 quart. A middle-of-
the-road size that you may want to start out with is a 5.3-quart capacity,
which will cook a meal for four. I recommend a 6.5-quart oval cooker for
large family meals. This setup allows you to cook large cuts of meats and
add veggies too, or cook a large casserole.
 Shape: Shape is important. Ovals let you cook larger cuts of meat. Some
cook 2 chickens at one time! In my estimation, ovals are the way to go.
 Heat settings: Older models and some of the less expensive ones still
have just high and low settings. Newer and more expensive models have
a third setting of warm or medium. Three settings definitely put you in
cooker control.
 Bells and whistles: The options available nowadays are just incredible.
Some have retractable cords. Some have an auto-cook feature that can
start the cooking off with a bang on high and then automatically and
gradually shift down to low. Then it goes to warm to keep the food per-
fect until serving time. I recommend the ones that automatically shift
into warm mode after the cooking time is complete. That way, if you run
late getting home, your meal won’t be overcooked — just on hold.
 Construction: The crocks and the lids in the newer models are dish-
washer safe. Easy cleanup is very nice.
265
Chapter 16: Coming Home to Slow-Cooked Comfort Foods

If you have an older model and don’t want to buy a new slow cooker, there’s a
little specialty gadget out there called a programmable module. You plug your
slow cooker into the module and plug the module into the wall outlet. You
then use your handy-dandy little module to program your cooking time and
temperature. It will even shift the heat down to warm mode for you. These
are available online.
Wondering what size cooker to use for a new recipe? If you have a 31⁄2-quart or
4-quart slow cooker, the total ingredients shouldn’t exceed 2 to 21⁄2 quarts. If
they do, you need to step up a notch in cookers.
Any recipe that fits in a 4-quart slow cooker can easily be doubled to cook in a
larger cooker. Think about this fact when you purchase your new slow cooker,
because it may mean that you can slow cook dinner and tomorrow’s lunch.
Turning to cooking times and temperatures
Most slow cookers have heating coils that encircle the crockery insert, which
is what allows the food to cook evenly. This is by far the most efficient and
dependable method of slow cookery, and in this chapter, I assume that it’s
the type of slow cooker you’re using. (Check out Figure 16-1 for a breakdown
of slow cooker components.)
The settings and temperatures vary on slow cookers, but a pretty good rule
of thumb is that the low setting is about 200 degrees, and the high setting is
about 300 degrees. If you want to hurry your cooking up a bit, keep in mind
that 2 to 21⁄2 hours on low is equal to about an hour on high. If you come home
and your food isn’t done to your liking, and it has been cooking on low all
day, just crank it up to high to finish.
Keeping the lid on your slow cooker is the secret to its success. It takes this
little wonder a matter of 15 to 20 minutes to recover when you’re nosy and
remove the lid. The lids are clear so you can look through them, so keep your
mitts off, okay? If condensation is built up on the lid, just give it a spin on the
cooker, and you’ll have a quick, clear view of what’s cooking.
Testing the waters and surveying food safety
Want to take your slow cooker’s temperature and see just how fast it’s cook-
ing and at what temperature? The bottom line on the performance of your
slow cooker comes down to food safety. As cookers age, they may not be able
to achieve and maintain high enough temperatures, and it may be time to
invest in a new one. This is a great Saturday project when you’re hanging
around the house all day. Let the test begin:
1. Fill your slow cooker with 2 quarts of water (yes, please measure it).
2. Cover and heat the water on the low setting for 8 hours.
266
Part III: Expanding Everyday Low-Carb Cooking 

Don’t take the lid off during the test.
3. After 8 hours, lift the lid and pop a thermometer in the water immedi-
ately (the water temperature drops quickly with the lid off).
The temperature of the water should be in the 185-degree range after
heating on low for 8 hours. If the temperature is considerably higher
than 185 degrees, your slow cooker has revved up cooking coils, and
you may want to reduce the cooking time of your dishes to prevent over-
cooking.
If the temperature is lower than 185 degrees, then your food isn’t likely
reaching a safe temperature quickly enough in your slow cooker, and
therefore the food may not be safe. It’s time for a new slow cooker.
Following are a couple don’ts to remember for keeping food safe in your slow
cooker:
 Don’t store cooked food in the slow cooker in the fridge (I know, it’s the
easiest thing to do). Don’t give bacteria any chance to grow in your food.
It’s always safer to store food in the fridge in a container other than what
it was cooked in. Take the extra 3 minutes to start soaking the cooker
and transfer the leftovers to a plastic storage container.
 Don’t reheat food in a slow cooker. If you have leftovers, reheat them in
the usual manner — either on top of the stove or in the microwave —
but please don’t put the food through slow cooking a second time.

Taking in a few tips on technique
There are always tricks to any trade, and slow cooking is no different. Here
are a few little inside tips for you to make the most out of your slow cooking
experiences:
 Bright green veggies, like broccoli, tend to lose their color as well as
some of their nutrients and flavor if cooped up in a slow cooker all day.
The solution is to cook your favorite bright green veggies in the
microwave until crisp-tender and add them to your crockery meal right
before serving.
 Surprise — meats cook more quickly than vegetables in a slow cooker 
(a little role reversal here). Therefore, cut your veggies somewhat evenly
for even cooking and place them in the bottom of the crock with the
meat on top of the veggies.
 In crockery cooking, using whole-leaf herbs and spices is better than
using ground ones, because you’ll end up with better flavor in the dishes
you’re preparing. Extended cooking at low temperatures can sometimes
cause some spices to become bitter. (Pepper appears to head the list, so
use freshly ground pepper when possible.) Experiment, because the
flavor of some herbs and spices tends to disappear in slow cooking.
You’ll get the hang of what suits your taste buds very quickly.
 Don’t add such ingredients as sour cream, milk, or whipping cream at
the beginning of cooking anything in your slow cooker and let it cook all
day. Any dairy products should be added at the last minute and stirred
into whatever you’re preparing. Curdling cuisine isn’t what you’re after.
268
Part III: Expanding Everyday Low-Carb Cooking 

 Don’t dump a package of frozen vegetables or frozen meat into your
crock. Doing really slows your cooking time down. Also, because some
ingredients are frozen and some are not, it makes for inconsistent 
cooking, and consistent slow cooking is what this is all about. Be sure
the food is defrosted thoroughly before leaving it home alone in your
slow cooker all day.
Cleanup can be a snap:
 An easy way to clean your slow cooker after using it is to simply fill it
with hot, soapy water and let it stand. Be careful when trying to clean a
hot slow cooker. If you add cold water, it may cause your crock to crack.
Don’t use harsh abrasives to clean your slow cooker. One of those net
sponge pads works really well.
 If you want an easy cleanup after using your slow cooker, simply spray it
with nonstick cooking spray before using it.
 Some of the newer models can be popped into the dishwasher, but I still
recommend that you do a little precleaning of your crock.
Hearty Low-Carb Meals
Slow Cookers For Dummies, by Tom Lacalamita and Glenna Vance (published
by Wiley), is a great place to start if you want to practice converting regular
slow-cooking recipes into low-carb culinary fare. The recipe need not say
“low-carb” for it to fit the low-carb lifestyle (with a little tweaking that is).
Check those carb counts and your carb smarts for those perfect low-carb
dishes. If you get stumped, just e-mail me at jan@janmccracken.com, and 
I’ll be glad to help you out. Adjusting a recipe so that it’s low-carb isn’t as dif-
ficult as you may think. Refer to Table 16-1, earlier in this chapter, for a con-
version chart for converting your favorite recipes to slow cooking and just go
for it.

One of my favorite slow-cooking meals
I buy whatever roast is on sale, and when I say
on sale, I mean really on sale. Sometimes you
can score a whole roast for $5. Take a large,
yellow onion and slice it from top to bottom (not
in rings), and place it in the bottom of the slow
cooker. Peel a few carrots, cut them in half, then
cut them lengthwise, and lay the carrots on top
of the onions. Pour about a 1⁄2 inch of water over
the onions and carrots. If you like mushrooms
and celery with your roast, add them too.
Remove the roast from the packaging and make
about six slits on each side of it. Slice fresh
garlic cloves in half and insert the pieces of
garlic deep into the slits. Salt and pepper the
roast well on both sides. Put the roast on top of
the onions and carrots. Slow cook the roast
(depending on the size) for about 9 hours on low
or about 6 hours on high. My grandmother used
this technique to cook roast for Sunday dinner.
However, that was before the day of slow cook-
ers, so she did it in the old Dutch oven. But you
can’t leave Dutch ovens home alone!
21⁄2 pounds pork loin ribs
1⁄4 cup barbecue sauce
1⁄4 cup finely chopped onion
2 tablespoons lime juice
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon grated lime peel
1 teaspoon grated orange
peel
1⁄4 cup orange juice
1 Place the ribs in a 4-quart slow cooker. You may have to cut the ribs to get them to fit
into the slow cooker, depending on how they’re packaged.
2 In a small bowl, combine the barbecue sauce, onion, lime juice, salt, lime peel, orange
peel, and orange juice, and pour over the ribs. Cover and cook on low for 8 to 9 hours.
3 Spoon the sauce over the ribs before serving.
Tip: Make the sauce the night before. The next morning, all you have to do is put your
meat in the slow cooker and pour in the sauce, and you’re out the door.

Key West Ribs
If you watch for sales, you can get incredible meaty, country-style pork loin ribs (which
are also called picnic ribs or simply country-style ribs in some areas) at a great price —
as low as 99 cents a pound. In addition to being easy on the budget, this particular
recipe is low in carbs and a real treat. You can save those dollars for a rib-eye steak on
the grill another day.

Herb-Roasted Lemon Chicken
Instead of paying $6 to $8 for a lemon-roasted chicken at the deli on your way home
from work, with just a tad of preplanning, you can have it waiting for you when you walk
through the door. You can cook two chickens for the price of one in your slow cooker,
and your house will smell yummy. Not to mention the fact that you’ll save a half hour or
more by not making the stop at the deli. I suggest you plan this meal for a Monday night
dinner. Make sure that chicken and the ingredients for any side dishes that you want are
on your weekend grocery list. Mondays are hectic for everyone, so wouldn’t it be nice
to come home to this comforting entrée waiting for you?
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Cooking time: 7 to 10 hours
Yield: 4 servings
1 fryer, about 4 pounds
Nonstick cooking spray
3 lemons
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian
parsley
1⁄4 teaspoon leaf thyme
1 Remove the giblets from the chicken and reserve them for another use. Rinse the
chicken and pat dry. Remove any excess fat from the chicken.
2 Coat the crock with nonstick cooking spray for easy cleanup.
3 Wash the lemons. Using a very sharp knife, make tiny slits in 2 of the lemons. This will
allow the flavors of the lemon to escape while cooking. Cut all 3 of the lemons in half.
4 Rub the skin of the chicken with the olive oil and sprinkle the salt and pepper on the
outside of the bird.
5 Put 4 of the lemon halves in the cavity of the chicken. Place the chicken in the slow
cooker with the breast side down. Squeeze the juice of the remaining lemon halves over
the chicken. Then sprinkle on the parsley and thyme.
6 Cover and cook on low for 7 to 10 hours. Test for doneness by inserting a meat ther-
mometer into the thickest part of the thigh without touching the bone. The thermom-
eter should register 170 degrees.
Tip: The liquid from cooking this delightful dish can be used as a very lemony gravy. Better
yet, it makes a great sauce for asparagus, broccoli, and green beans. Yum.

Corned Beef with Vegetables
With a name like McCracken, I had to include corned beef somewhere in my book. Slow
cooking is kind to corned beef because it makes the meat so tender and juicy. You can
have this meal waiting for you when you get home and then have leftovers for lunch the
next day or for snacks. (See the sidebar “Reuben wraps,” later in the chapter, for a great
lunch and snack idea). Watch for frequent sales on corned beef. This meal is kind to
your budget with no sacrifice to taste, and it’s a great fit with your low-carb lifestyle.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 8 to 9 hours
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
1 corned beef brisket, about 4 pounds
3 carrots, cut in 3-inch pieces and halved
2 stalks celery, cut in 2-inch pieces
2 medium yellow onions, quartered
3⁄4 cup dry white wine
1 cup canned beef broth
1 bay leaf
3 whole cloves
1 Wash the brisket under cold running water and pat dry.
2 Add the carrots, celery, onions, wine, broth, bay leaf, and cloves to the slow cooker.
Place the brisket on top of the vegetables. If necessary, cut your brisket in half so that it
fits well in the slow cooker.
3 Cover and cook on low for 8 to 9 hours, until very tender.
4 Serve the meat and vegetables with broth ladled over the top.
Per serving (based on 10 servings): Calories 362 (From Fat 233); Fat 26g (Saturated 9g); Cholesterol 133mg;
Sodium 1,666mg; Carbohydrate 5g; Dietary Fiber 1g (Net Carbohydrate 4g); Protein 26g.
When cooking chicken in the slow cooker, you may want to remove the skin
before you start cooking. The skin tends to curl up and isn’t very pretty. My
solution is to work with boneless and skinless chicken. The exception to this
chicken rule is when you’re cooking a whole chicken; then you want to leave
the skin on to hold in the juices.
If you have a recipe that says to cook an hour on high and then reduce to low,
set your timer to remind you so that you don’t walk out the door and leave
the cooker on high all day. You’ll be much happier when you come through
the door if your creation has cooked all day on low.

Casserole of Chicken, Artichokes, 
and Mushrooms
This is a low-carb casserole at its finest. Serve this hearty casserole with a crisp side
salad and get ready for rave reviews and requests for a repeat performance. Artichoke
hearts are very low in carbs, but be sure to check the labels and do a little comparing
when shopping to be sure you get the best quality, as well as the lowest carb counts.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 8 to 81⁄2 hours
Yield: 6 servings
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Pepper
1⁄4 cup chicken broth
1⁄4 cup white wine
1 teaspoon fresh tarragon
2 tablespoons butter
1⁄2 pound fresh mushrooms, washed and sliced
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon cool water
1 can (15 ounces) artichoke hearts, drained
1⁄2 cup slivered almonds
1⁄2 cup shredded Asiago cheese
1 Wash the chicken breasts and pat dry. Rub the chicken breasts with olive oil and season
them with the salt and pepper to taste.
2 Pour the chicken broth and wine into the slow cooker. Place the chicken breasts in the
liquid. Sprinkle the tarragon over the chicken breasts.
3 Cover and cook on low for 8 to 81⁄2 hours, or until the chicken is done — when tested
with a meat thermometer, it should register at 180 degrees.
4 In a skillet, melt the butter and quickly sauté the mushrooms, being careful not to over-
cook. This will only take about 4 minutes.
5 Turn the slow cooker on high and bring the sauce to a simmer. Meanwhile, combine the
cornstarch and water in a small cup, mixing well. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the
simmering sauce and cook until slightly thickened (about 4 minutes).
6 Stir in the sautéed mushrooms and drained artichoke hearts and heat thoroughly.
Sprinkle with the slivered almonds and cheese and serve immediately.

Slowing Soups and Stews to a Simmer
Slow cookers and soups are a marriage made in heaven. You’ll find that cook-
ing times vary for soups and stews — some are suited for all-day cooking,
and some aren’t. When a soup or stew recipe calls for stock or broth (refer to
Chapter 7 for soup recipes), don’t feel compelled to use homemade. You’re
trying to save yourself some time here. If you have frozen stock on hand,
that’s great. If not, break out a can or carton of the stuff and slow cook away.
Using prepared stock or broth is okay for your low-carb lifestyle.

Russian Borscht
This is a great Sunday treat to have cooking all day while you’re doing things around
the house or watching football. Borscht is a rich Eastern European soup that contains
beets or cabbage. Other ingredients may include potatoes, beans, meat, or sausage. You
may know of the cold version of borscht, but hot versions are also common. According
to old cooking folklore, a wooden spoon will stand upright when stuck into the pot of
borscht if it’s done correctly. I think you’ll enjoy this recipe on a lazy weekend day.
Preparation time: 10 to15 minutes
Cooking time: 8 to 9 hours
Yield: 12 servings
4 cups thinly sliced green
cabbage
1 pound fresh beets,
shredded
5 carrots, peeled and sliced
thin
1 parsnip, peeled and sliced
thin
1 cup finely chopped yellow
onion
4 cloves garlic, minced fine
1 pound beef chuck, cut into

tomatoes, undrained
3 cans (15 ounces each) beef
broth
1⁄4 cup lemon juice
1 packet Splenda sugar
substitute
1 teaspoon pepper
12 heaping tablespoons sour
cream
1 Using a large slow cooker, layer, in order, the cabbage, beets, carrots, parsnip, onion,
garlic, beef, tomatoes, beef broth, lemon juice, Splenda, and pepper.
2 Cover and cook on low for 8 to 9 hours. Vegetables should be crisp-tender.
3 Make sure the seasonings are to your liking. Add more lemon juice or Splenda as your
palate desires.

Kettle of Fish Stew
This is a hearty and delightful meal to come home to — and the flavors, oh my, the fla-
vors. The combination of the fresh veggies, the herbs and spices, and the fresh fish are
a great beginning. Add slow cooking to the ingredient combo, and it’s gonna make your
mouth sing. To top it off, this is a beautiful dish. Try it out, and I’m sure you’ll want to
serve it to guests. Your slow cooker will make it look like you’ve been slaving in the
kitchen all day with this one — not!
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 6 to 8 hours
Yield: 4 servings
11⁄2 pounds flounder or halibut,
cut in 1-inch pieces
1 can (16 ounces) whole
Roma tomatoes, mashed
1⁄2 cup dry white wine
1 bottle (8 ounces) clam juice
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 cup finely chopped yellow
onion
1⁄2 cup chopped celery
1⁄2 cup peeled and finely
chopped carrots
1⁄4 cup chopped Italian parsley
1⁄4 teaspoon dried rosemary
3 tablespoons melted butter
3 tablespoons flour
1⁄3 cup light cream
1⁄2 cup freshly grated
Parmesan cheese (optional)
1 Combine the fish, tomatoes, wine, clam juice, salt, onion, celery, carrots, parsley, and
rosemary in your slow cooker.
2 Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours.
3 Combine the melted butter, flour, and cream, whisking until well combined. Stir into the
fish mixture.
4 Continue cooking until the mixture is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
5 Serve in wide soup bowls for the ultimate presentation and sprinkle with freshly grated
Parmesan cheese, if desired.
Tip: For a thicker stew, leave the cover off your cooker for the last hour of cooking.
Variation: If you want to finish this up on the stove, just remove about 1 cup of the broth
from the slow cooker with a ladle. Then, in a small saucepan, melt the butter and flour
together on the stove. Add the cream and the cup of broth. Cook 2 minutes, until it begins
to thicken. Then stir the whole mixture back into the stew and let it simmer and thicken for
about 20 to 40 minutes.

Reuben wraps
Leftover corned beef brisket makes tasty wraps
for snacks or lunch to tote. Keep low-carb
whole-wheat tortillas on hand for occasions
such as this. Simply take a couple low-carb
whole-wheat tortillas and spread some bottled
creamy Russian dressing (be sure to check 
the carb counts and the sugar content when
purchasing) on each one. Layer the tortillas with
thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and
sauerkraut. Roll them up and pop them in the
microwave separately for about 15 to 20 sec-
onds, or until the cheese just begins to melt.
Microwave temperatures vary, so don’t over-
cook — you don’t want crispy brisket roll-ups.
T Black Bean and Veggie Chili
This slow cookin’ meal is perfect for a cold and rainy day. It’s great to make a big batch,
so you have plenty left over for lunches or snacks. This chili freezes really well, and you
can freeze it in individual containers ready to grab to pack in your lunch bag.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 7 to 8 hours
Yield: 6 servings
1 Combine the zucchini, garlic, celery, onion, chili powder, cocoa powder, Splenda, Roma
tomatoes, puréed tomatoes, vegetable stock, beans, cumin, oregano, basil, sea salt, and
pepper in the slow cooker.

 Enjoying entrees with very few carbs
 Selecting the lowest of low-carb sides
 Snacking and grazing in the zero-to-five category

A
ll of the recipes that I include in this chapter
are less than 5 net grams of carbs (the net
part means that the fiber counts have been sub-
tracted for you; see more on net carbs in Chap-
ter 2). Though many of the recipes I include
throughout this book contain less then 5 net
grams of carbs, I thought I’d include a bonus chap-
ter of sorts to shoehorn just a few more dishes in
that are super skinny on the carbs. And just
because the carb counts are in the basement, that doesn’t mean that the
quality and taste of the dishes are down there with the carb counts! So if the
recipe has zero to five carbs, you can eat a ton, right? No — you can eat until
you’re satisfied and smile a lot while you’re savoring every bite, knowing how
low the carb counts are that you’re consuming. You can prepare sumptuous
meals that I bet you never dreamed were so low in carb counts. Remember
that moderation in all things in life is still the key. You’re striving for balance
in your low-carb lifestyle, and it’s achievable and awaiting you. So let’s get
cookin’!

menus with the myriad of whole fresh foods that miraculously fall into the
zero- to five-gram category, and you’ll never be bored with your low-carb
lifestyle. In so doing, you can also make room for special treats, still staying
within your daily carb intakes. It’s a magical combination.
Most fish, poultry, and meats hover around the almost zero carb count, so
they’re always candidates for a low-carb building block. And talk about
choices! Consider poultry, which includes all types of fowl, such as duck,
goose, quail, pheasant, chicken, turkey, and Cornish hens. Remember that
some meats and fish are all-around healthier for you than others, so be sure
to check those calorie counts and the saturated fat contents too (see Chap-
ter 2 for more on fats and calories) and factor that into your plans (see
Chapters 9, 10, and 11, for all your fish, fowl, and meat needs, respectively).

Salmon Steaks in Wine Marinade
Hold on to your hat! This awesome recipe has less than 1 gram of carbs per serving.
These salmon steaks are awesome on the grill, or you can cook them in the broiler or in
the toaster oven on broil . . . ah, choices! (Check out additional low-carb fish recipes in
Chapter 9.) And you don’t have to break the bank when you buy white wine for this
recipe — the inexpensive stuff works just fine.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons light olive oil
1⁄4 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Dash of hot pepper sauce (optional)
Salt and pepper
4 salmon steaks (about 3⁄4-inch thick)
1 To prepare the marinade, combine the oil, wine, ginger, soy sauce, lemon juice, and hot
sauce, if desired, in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
2 Place the salmon steaks in the marinade (in a flat dish) and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
3 Cook the salmon on the grill or under the broiler for about 12 minutes, turning twice
and basting occasionally. To test for doneness, do the flaky fish test — insert a fork and
if it flakes, it’s done. You don’t want to overcook salmon. Serve with fresh lemon.

Chicken on the Barbie
This is pretty unbelievable — chicken quarters dripping in delicious sauce with a carb
count so low! It doesn’t get much better. So crank up the barbie and pick a salad in
Chapter 8 to serve with this great chicken dish. Get ready for rave reviews and, if you’re
dining with fellow low-carbers, get out your recipe cards because they’ll want to write
this one down.
Preparation time: 10 minutes

Chapter 17: Even More Delightful Dishes with 5 Net Grams of Carbs or Less
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon tomato paste 
(or use homemade tomato
sauce; see the recipe in the
following section)
2 garlic cloves, minced fine
1⁄4 cup heated chicken stock
3 drops Worcestershire
sauce (more if desired)
Juice of 1 lime
1 whole fryer chicken, 
3 pounds, quartered
Salt and pepper
1 Preheat the grill to medium (you can use your indoor tabletop grill too if you want
to). Combine the olive oil, soy sauce, tomato paste, garlic cloves, chicken stock,
Worcestershire sauce, and lime juice in a small bowl. Place the chicken quarters in a
ceramic baking dish and baste with the marinade. Salt and pepper to taste.
2 Place the chicken quarters on the barbie and cook on medium for about 8 minutes.
Turn the chicken over, baste with marinade, and cook an additional 8 minutes.
3 Baste the chicken again with marinade and turn again to finish cooking. Depending on
the size of the bird, cooking will take 20 to 35 minutes. Insert the meat thermometer
into the thickest part of the chicken quarter to check doneness. The thermometer
should register an internal temperature of 180 degrees.

Just because meat, poultry, and fish are minuscule on the carb front, don’t
think you’re totally in the clear. The culprits so many times are in the sauces
and marinades that you slather on the meat. Always check for those hidden
sugars and hidden carbs, especially in store-bought sauces and marinades.
(Meander over to Chapter 10 for more on marinades.)

Spinach and Flounder Pinwheels
These are so good, not to mention quick — it’s a microwave recipe. The combination of
the white flounder against the green of the spinach makes an enticing presentation. For
a change, serve on a bed of fresh baby greens and drizzle your favorite dressing over all.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 5 to 7 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 cup frozen spinach, thawed
with the water squeezed out
1⁄2 cup soft low-carb
breadcrumbs
1 jar (2 ounces) sliced
pimientos, drained (optional)
2 tablespoons grated onion
1 tablespoon finely chopped
pecans
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1⁄2 teaspoon dried whole
marjoram
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
4 flounder fillets, 4 ounces
each
1⁄4 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
12 fresh spinach leaves
(optional)
4 lemon wedges
1 Combine the spinach, breadcrumbs, pimientos (if desired), onion, pecans, lemon juice,
marjoram, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl, mixing well.
2 Spoon 3 tablespoons of the spinach mixture in the center of each fillet and spread it out
evenly over each fillet. Roll up like a jelly roll (begin at the skinny end!). Secure the roll-
up with a wooden toothpick.
3 Place the rolls, seam side down, in an 11-x-7-x-2-inch microwave-safe baking dish.
4 Combine the wine and the lemon rind and pour over the rolls. Cover the dish with
heavy-duty plastic wrap and vent on one corner.
5 Microwave on high for 5 to 7 minutes, or until fish easily flakes when tested with a fork.
Do not overcook.
6 Let stand for 1 minute. Remove from the dish and be sure to remove the wooden picks
before eating these pinwheels. If serving as appetizers, arrange them on a platter. If
serving as a main course, transfer to individual plates.
7 Use fresh spinach for garnish, if desired, and serve with lemon wedges.
Tip: When using frozen spinach, if you want to make sure all the moisture is out, thaw it
quickly in the microwave. Then wrap it in a couple layers of paper towels and just squeeze
it over the sink. This technique isn’t fancy, but it works very well.

Turkey Cheese Pockets
These turkey cheese pockets are great served with a simple fresh spinach salad that’s
sprinkled with chopped hard-boiled egg, a couple cherry tomatoes, and a basic vinai-
grette dressing. You can pop these pockets in the microwave for a snack or lunch the
next day, and I’ve been known to eat them cold. If you need a little help from your
friends on making pockets in meats, jump on over to Chapter 11 for a quick pocket-
making lesson and then come back and make this recipe.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 to 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 boneless turkey breast pieces
(approximately 8 ounces each)
Salt and pepper
4 thick slices deli-style mozzarella cheese
4 fresh sage leaves
8 strips bacon
4 teaspoons olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 Preheat the gas grill or inside grill to medium heat. With a sharp knife, moving across
the width of the turkey breasts, cut a pocket in each breast. Season inside the pocket
carefully with salt and pepper to taste.
2 Place a piece of cheese into each pocket and tuck a sage leaf in with the cheese.
3 Taking each piece of bacon in turn, hold down the end of the bacon strip and stretch it
out, using the back of a large knife or a rolling pin. You want the bacon stretched out to
the point that you can wrap it around the turkey breast pieces. Wrap 2 pieces of bacon
around each turkey breast piece, covering and securing the pocket. Secure the bacon
strips to the turkey with wooden toothpicks. The bacon strips help keep the cheese fill-
ing intact when cooking.
4 In a small bowl, whisk the oil and lemon juice together.
5 Grill the turkey pockets for about 10 minutes on each side. Baste frequently with the
lemon and oil mixture. Test the turkey breasts for doneness with a meat thermometer.
The thermometer should register 180 degrees when inserted into the thickest part of
the breast piece.

Serving Up Zero to Five in the Sauce
and on the Side
Side dishes are important to all of your low-carb meals. Great sides can be
very low in carbs and high in the flavor department. Sides can include salads,
veggies, a combination of the two, and even fruit sides. (See Chapter 8 for
some great side salad recipes.) Veggies are a mainstay of a healthy low-carb
lifestyle (for more veggie info and recipes, check out Chapter 12). Low-carb
veggie sides can be quick and easy when you steam, roast, microwave, or
cook them on top of the stove. What sets them apart from bland and boring
is jazzing them up a little bit with a splash of citrus, some freshly chopped
herbs, some crunchy nuts, caraway seeds, or sprinkles of shredded cheese —
the list really is endless. And all this jazz adds very few carbs to these
healthy sides. Your challenge is to see how many different recipes you can
come up with in the zero-to-five net carb count category.

Cauliflower and Broccoli 
with Cheese and Bacon
Dietary fiber has never tasted so good as in this recipe! Talk about a low-carber’s dream
dish! And it’s squarely in the yum category too.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 8 to 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound fresh broccoli
1 pound fresh cauliflower
2 strips thick-cut bacon
1 tablespoon sour cream
2 tablespoons grated cheddar cheese
1 Trim the broccoli and cauliflower into florets. Place them in a steamer and steam over
boiling water for about 4 minutes until crisp-tender. Don’t overcook.
2 Microwave the bacon on paper towels until crispy. Drain on fresh paper towels. Cut the
bacon into thin strips or crumble.
3 In a large serving dish, combine the cauliflower, broccoli, and bacon. Top with the sour
cream and grated cheddar cheese.

Homemade Tomato Sauce
This is a great homemade tomato sauce that comes in under the banner of 10 grams of
carbs or less. And because you’re making it from scratch, you don’t have to worry
about the added sugars and those sneaky additives. If you can buy the tomatoes at a
farmer’s market so they taste as good as they smell, your sauce will be even better (see
Chapter 8 for more tomato info). You can use tomato sauce in a variety of different
recipes, and using the homemade stuff is sure to spoil your taste buds. You can serve
this terrific sauce over a medley of veggies of your choice, such as zucchini and fresh
green beans, meatballs, or maybe spinach dumplings (go to Chapter 10 for recipe), just
to give you a few ideas.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 2 hours and 20 minutes
Yield: Approximately 6 cups (serving size is 1⁄4 cup)
4 slices thick-cut bacon,
diced large
1 medium yellow onion,
chopped fine
1 medium carrot, peeled and
diced
1⁄2 celery stalk, diced
1 teaspoon basil
1⁄2 teaspoon oregano
1 packet Splenda sugar
substitute
1 tablespoon finely chopped
fresh Italian parsley
12 large ripe tomatoes,
peeled, cut in half, and
seeded
1 chile pepper, seeded and
sliced
1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
1 cup chicken broth
Salt and pepper
1 Heat a large deep and heavy-bottomed saucepan until hot. Add the bacon and cook for
about 4 minutes.
2 Add the onion, carrot, celery, basil, oregano, and Splenda to the saucepan. Mix and
cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the vegetables begin to brown.
3 Add the parsley, tomatoes, pepper, tomato paste, and chicken broth and season with
salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 2 hours over low heat, stirring frequently.
4 Serve, or cover and refrigerate.
Tip: Freeze the tomato sauce in serving-size plastic containers that meet your needs to
ensure you always have great, homemade tomato sauce at your fingertips.

To peel a tomato easily and efficiently, spear it in the stem end with a fork,
and plunge it into boiling water for 30 seconds or until the skin splits.
Immediately dip the tomato into very cold water. Then use a sharp paring
knife and simply pull the skin off the tomato. To save more nutrients and fla-
vors when you cook whole tomatoes, cook them with the skins on. They float
to the top, and you can just skim them off with a slotted spoon as they sepa-
rate from the tomato. (Chapter 12 has more info and tomato recipes.)
An old-fashioned secret when making anything with tomatoes is to add some
sugar, because it brings out the flavor of the tomato in an undetectable fash-
ion. So with your low-carb lifestyle, instead add a packet of Splenda sugar
substitute to your chili, tomato sauces, and other tomato dishes.
Fighting the Snack Attack 
In a low-carb lifestyle, you don’t want to let yourself get voraciously hungry
(see Chapter 5 for more on why this is true). I have a habit of carrying a little
bag of raw almonds with me in my purse no matter where I go. If my energy
takes a dip, I know I need a little protein, and I have a few almonds available
to give me an energy boost.
Research has shown that women who eat a few ounces of nuts a day as a
snack lose twice as much weight and gain more trim muscle than those
women who don’t include nuts in their everyday diets. As for all the guys out
there, I don’t have the research to back it up, but I can’t see why it wouldn’t
be the same for you. Losing weight is all about burning fat, and nuts contain
hormones that produce a metabolism booster. So get nuts!

Part III: Expanding Everyday Low-Carb Cooking 
The low-carb lowdown on cheese
Cheeses are a bountiful low-carb staple. Most
cheeses have few carbs — if not zero carbs. 
All of your everyday cheeses, such as goat
cheese, cream cheese, Swiss, cheddar, moz-
zarella, Parmesan, provolone, and even cottage
cheese, are dandy. And they make up just the
tip of the proverbial cheese iceberg. Because
cheese is full of protein and calcium, it makes a
great snack when you feel that starvation pang.
Venture out and try some new combinations.
Just a few words of caution in your low-carb
cheese world, when it comes to specialty
cheeses. Watch for specialty cheeses that may
have some additional ingredients that make the
carb counts spike. For instance, I keep lusting
after a soft goat cheese log at a local specialty
store that has cranberries in it. Not only are
there cranberries marbled through the beauti-
ful cheese, but there are added sugars as well.
Sometimes it takes a little willpower to succeed
in the low-carb lifestyle. Also, take a peek at the
calorie counts because some specialty cheeses
have higher calorie counts, so you may want to
use them sparingly.

Eggplant Sandwiches Extraordinaire
If you’re an eggplant lover, this sandwich will be a dream come true. Not only can you
serve it as a main-course sandwich, but it’s also a great snack treat, cut in bite-size
pieces for grazing. The net carb count for the entire sandwich is 2 grams, so enjoy!
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 18 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
2 eggplants, 1 pound each
1⁄2 tablespoon kosher salt
Nonstick cooking spray
4 slices prosciutto, halved
8 large fresh basil leaves
1⁄3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 Cut the eggplants into sixteen 1⁄4-inch slices out of the middle or the largest part of the
eggplant. Reserve the remainder for use in a stir-fry. Salt and set aside for 30 minutes.
2 Spray a heavy skillet with the nonstick spray. Over high heat, place the eggplant slices
in the hot skillet and cook for about 10 minutes, turning once. The eggplant will become
soft.
3 Remove the eggplant slices from the heat onto a platter or large plate.
4 Now build your eggplant sandwiches. Layer 8 slices of the eggplant with a piece of pro-
sciutto, a fresh basil leaf, and 2 teaspoons mozzarella cheese. Top with a second egg-
plant slice, sandwich-style.
5 Heat the skillet again over medium-high heat and spray with the nonstick spray. Return
the sandwiches to the skillet and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, or until the
cheese begins to melt.
6 Remove the sandwiches and let them rest for about 2 minutes. Cut in half and serve.
Tip: Never use iodized salt when salting eggplant, because the iodine content can actually
give the eggplant a bitter after-taste. Be sure to use sea salt or coarse kosher salt instead.

T Stuffed Mushrooms
Stuffed Mushrooms make a satisfying snack or a great appetizer for a low-carb party.
The recipe makes about 20 servings, so at only 2 net grams of carbs per stuffed mush-
room, you can eat more than one. This recipe calls for low-carb breadcrumbs, and
you’ll need to make your own out of your favorite low-carb bread. I make them ahead of
time and store them in a tightly sealed container in the fridge. (Hop over to Chapter 10
for a quick breadcrumb-making lesson.)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 20 servings
1 package (10 ounces) frozen
chopped spinach, thawed
and squeezed dry
Nonstick cooking spray
11⁄2 pounds large fresh
mushrooms with stems
(about 20)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1⁄4 cup finely chopped yellow
onion
2 cloves garlic, minced fine
1⁄4 cup freshly grated
Parmesan cheese
1⁄4 cup dry, fine low-carb
breadcrumbs
1⁄4 cup finely chopped pimiento
1⁄2 teaspoon dried crushed
oregano
1⁄2 teaspoon dried crushed
basil
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
Pepper
1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Thaw the frozen spinach. Place it in a paper towel and
squeeze out all the excess liquid.
2 Spray a 10-x-15-x-1-inch baking dish with the nonstick cooking spray and set aside.
3 Wash the mushrooms in a colander, removing the stems. Rub the mushroom tops with
the olive oil and set aside. Finely chop the mushroom stems to make 2 cups of stems.
4 In a heavy 10-inch skillet, melt the butter and cook the chopped mushroom stems,
onion, and garlic over medium-high heat. Cook only until the onion is tender and clear;
don’t allow the onion to brown.
5 Add the drained spinach and cook over low heat until the moisture has evaporated
(about 3 minutes, depending on how well you’ve squeezed the spinach). Stir in the
Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs, chopped pimiento, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper to
taste. Stir the spinach mixture until well blended.
6 Spoon the spinach mixture into the oiled mushroom tops. Place them in the baking
dish. Bake for 30 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender (not soggy).
Tip: Using freshly grated hard cheeses can make a dish sing. Use a regular grater or one of
those fancy cheese devices that require you to insert different blades and turn the handle
(like the ones in the restaurant).

Chinese Chicken Wings
These wings are a special treat. One-and-a-half pounds makes 8 servings, so the size of
the wings will depend on how many are in a serving. Although honey isn’t on the low-
carb list, I’ve left it in this recipe because it makes the sauce so sweet and the wings
taste great. However, if you want to substitute sugar-free maple syrup, please do so.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Refrigeration time: 4 hours
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
11⁄2 pounds chicken wings
1 tablespoon light olive oil
1⁄4 cup soy sauce
1⁄3 cup pineapple juice
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon finely minced fresh gingerroot
2 tablespoons water
1 Using a 9-x-13-inch baking pan, place the wings side by side, forming only one layer.
2 In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, soy sauce, pineapple juice, honey, garlic, ginger-
root, and water and pour over the chicken wings. Toss to coat the wings evenly. (If you
prefer to use a large zipper-type plastic bag to coat the wings, please do so.) Cover
tightly and refrigerate for about 4 hours.
3 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Drain the marinade from the wings. Bake the wings for
about 30 minutes, or until browned.
4 Serve with warm, wet towels so you can eat the wings with your fingers. Yum.

T Lemon Cloud
This sweet offering is so elegant, light, and airy. And the carb count is so low that you
can even sprinkle a few red raspberries for garnish and still be under your 5 grams of
carbs. What a treat! This recipe is kind of a faux soufflé. By that, I mean that you build it
like you do a soufflé, and it acts like a soufflé when cooking, but it doesn’t hold up like
one. Don’t be disappointed when it deflates on you very quickly. It’s okay because the
flavor and taste are what you’re after in this recipe — like airy, sweet, and lemony eggs!
You bake this lemony cloud in a soufflé dish. 
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 eggs, separated
1⁄2 teaspoon pure vanilla
extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1⁄4 teaspoon lemon zest
6 packets Splenda sugar
substitute
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg
yolks on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the vanilla, lemon extract, lemon zest, and 
3 packets of the Splenda. Turn the mixer up to high and beat for 2 minutes.
2 In a medium bowl (not plastic), beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar on high
until soft peaks begin to form. Add the remaining 3 packets of Splenda and beat until
the egg whites are stiff.
3 Taking the egg white mixture one-third at a time, fold gently into the yolk mixture until
the two mixtures are just blended.
4 Spray a 11⁄2-quart soufflé dish with the cooking spray and pour the mixture into the dish.
Place the soufflé dish in a shallow pan. Pour hot water into the pan until it’s 1 inch high.
Put the lemon cloud in the oven immediately after you put it in the soufflé pan to keep
the air in the lemon mixture for baking.
5 Bake for 30 minutes and don’t open the oven door while the lemon cloud is baking (it’ll
cause it to fall before you take it out of the oven). Serve immediately. Red raspberries
are an optional garnish.
Variation: Prepare your favorite low-carb chocolate sauce or buy some low-carb syrup 
or sauce. Warm the sauce or syrup in the microwave and pour it over the lemon cloud.
Spritz each serving with some whipped cream. This total package won’t come in under the
5-grams carb count, but you now have a low-carb splurge treat.

tize low-carb living and make smart choices. You have no reason to stop
making these smart choices when you dine out. After all, you don’t leave
your low-carb lifestyle at home when you go to a restaurant. This is your way
of life, so it follows you everywhere!
In this chapter, I give you a bunch of great tips and tricks for ordering with
confidence, navigating menus, and choosing standard restaurant dishes that
work in your low-carb lifestyle. Then I take it one step further, with an eye
toward maximizing your options, by covering the low-carb options at a vari-
ety of ethnic restaurants.
If you have a vote in where you’re dining, choose a restaurant that you know
provides a delicious and satisfying meal that fits your low-carb lifestyle. This
doesn’t mean you have to eat at the same restaurant all the time, though. Be
adventuresome and try new places, but do try to stay away from home-style
buffets. And if you’re dining with friends and they ask where you’d like to go,
speak up. Vocalize what works for you instead of saying, “Oh, anywhere is
fine.”

The Art of Placing Your Low-Carb Order
Don’t set yourself up to get up from what should be a pleasant dining experi-
ence feeling guilty. It just isn’t necessary. You’re always in the driver’s seat of
what goes in your mouth, no matter where you are. When you’re at a restau-
rant, be very specific when you place your order: Ask the server for details
on the dishes you’re considering (How’s it prepared? What’s in that sauce?
Are the veggies fresh or canned?), and ask for exactly what you want. Just
because something isn’t on the menu doesn’t mean it isn’t available.
When it comes to ordering, the key is to ask. The following may be some
common requests you find yourself making:
 May I substitute mixed veggies or cottage cheese for the french fries?
 Is fresh fruit in season but not shown on the menu as an option?
 Because I get two sides dishes, can I have two orders of veggies?
 Instead of having the fresh catch of the day drowned in that fancy
schmancy sauce, can I simply have it grilled with a squeeze of lemon?
Good restaurants enjoy making their guests happy and meeting their cuisine
desires because they want to build repeat customers in the process of pleas-
ing you. So make the restaurant folks happy by asking for what you want.
Taking precautionary dining measures
For goodness’ sake, don’t starve yourself before you go out. You set yourself
up for a big fall and risk disappointing yourself as soon as the bread basket
arrives. Going into a fine restaurant with the delicious smells and beckoning
menu is a very scary low-carb move on an empty stomach.
Before you leave the house or work, grab a handful of nuts and munch on
them on the way to the restaurant to take the hunger edge off. Drink some
water to wash down the nuts, and you’re set.
When you arrive at the restaurant and are seated, if you’re really hungry,
order a hot cup of tea. And how about that bread basket? If you’re dining with
someone who wants bread, ask if he’d mind putting his bread on his bread
plate and sending the basket away from the table. It’s the old out-of-sight, 
out-of-mind trick at work. If you’re dining with a table full of friends, make
sure the bread is out of your immediate reach. Across the table is a good
place for it.

Scanning the menu: Keyword traps 
and treats
In restaurant lingo, there are some trap words and phrases that describe
dishes that are off the charts in carbs and promise to upset your low-carb
apple cart. As you look at the menu, look for the words that may be the
enemy in disguise. Avoid ordering anything with these words in the 
description:
293
Chapter 18: Taking the Low-Carb Road to Restaurants
 All you can eat
 Batter-fried
 Breaded
 Covered in sauce
 Crispy
 Decadent desserts
 Deep-fried
 Dipped in batter
 Extra-large
 Glazed
 Jumbo
 Loaded
 Pan-fried
 Smothered
 Tempura
But don’t let that list get ya’ down. There are still so many delightful dishes
you can indulge in when eating out. Here are some words you can eat by:
 Baked
 Braised
 Broasted
 Charbroiled
 Fresh
 Grilled
 Herb stuffed
 Poached
 Roasted
 Steamed
 Stir-fried
Always check out any sauces to be sure that they’re not loaded with hidden
sugars or high carb counts. Sometimes it will be hit and miss because, even if
you ask, you’re not going to get a great answer about ingredients. When in
doubt, ask for your sauces on the side, and that way you can use it as a dip-
ping sauce instead of saturating your entree with the sauce.

Indulging in guilt-free, low-carb cuisine
Here’s a good rule of thumb: Food that’s prepared simply, such as grilled
fresh fish, is usually a healthy entree.
Look at these mouthwatering, low-carb entrees that you can indulge in with
no guilt whatsoever:
 Grilled or broiled fish of any kind
 Lobster with drawn butter on the side
 Fresh crab legs with drawn butter on the side
 Steamers and mussels
 Prime rib specials
 Steak
 Broiled, grilled, or baked chicken or turkey
 Grilled pork chops
 Grilled lamb chops
 Shrimp cocktail
Go easy on the cocktail sauce that comes with your shrimp, because it can be
loaded with sugar. You don’t have to submerge your shrimp in the sauce to
enjoy it.
And don’t forget the cheeseburger. Yes, that’s right. Go ahead and order a big,
thick cheeseburger — just make a few modifications. Ask your server to give
you some iceberg lettuce on the side, and skip the bun. When your burger
arrives, wrap it in the lettuce (see Chapter 11 for a great stuffed burger to
make at home). Or you can order a burger with Swiss cheese and a double
order of mushrooms on top of the burger. Skipping the bun and eating it
open-faced with mushrooms tumbling down and Swiss cheese oozing out is
sure to be a treat. It’s politically correct to eat that big, fat burger low-carb
style with a fork and knife.
When you order a burger, ask the server to leave off the special sauce and
substitute condiments on the side. Ketchup can be loaded with sugar, so just
go easy. Mustard, mayo, and dill pickles are fine, however. Ask for extra let-
tuce and tomatoes too because they give you more to wrap your mouth
around.
Salads are always great restaurant choices as well. Add these to your order-
ing options:
294
Part IV: Eating Low-Carb on the Town and on the Run 

 Caesar salads of all kinds (minus the croutons): Add chicken, shrimp,
salmon, or steak to make this salad a full meal.
 Marinated vegetable salads: Make sure to ask what the veggies have
been marinated in so you don’t get stuck with a sugar-laden marinade.
 Chef salads and salad bars: Skip the bacon bits and the croutons,
please. And just because you order the salad bar, you don’t have rights
to the potato salad and all those other starchy carb salads at the bar.
However, if you find a really fresh salad bar that serves soup as well,
you’ve just found a diamond in the rough because it can be a great low-
carb place for lunch too.
Reviewing some restaurant survival tips
With a few survival tips, you’ll be armed and ready to dine anywhere in the
world at any meal. Not only can you eat healthy when eating out, but you can
most definitely enjoy it as well. Deprivation is not on the menu — healthy
choices on your part are what are on your menu. Smile at the waiter, order,
and bon appétit!
 Order first: After you carefully inspect the menu options and grill the
server, place your order. Don’t wait to hear the choices of the folks
you’re dining with. Your food decisions are personal and shouldn’t
depend on what anyone else at the table is ordering. It’s your lifestyle,
remember?
 Stick with water: Diet sodas are full of caffeine and may increase your
appetite, as well as trigger carb cravings Order water with a slice of
lemon or, better yet, order sparkling water in a wine glass. I do it all the
time. It makes the meal feel even more special, and if your dining mates
are drinking wine, you have a wine glass to lift too. Here’s a toast to you
for respecting your low-carb lifestyle while dining out!
 Ask for the to-go container early: If the portions are huge, you don’t
have to eat everything on your plate. Maybe you ordered your favorite
salad, and it’s enough for three. Before you douse it with salad dressing,
ask for a to-go container and put half of the salad in the container. Ask
for some salad dressing to go if you especially like the one served with
the salad. You have tomorrow’s lunch already figured out.
 Ask for dressings and sauces to be served on the side always: Some
restaurants tend to drown the salad and use more sauce than necessary.
Don’t let it spoil your meal when you can simply avoid it by ordering
your dressings and sauces on the side to begin with. By doing so, you’re
where you’re supposed to be — in the low-carb driver’s seat! (See the
suggestion in the earlier section “Scanning the menu: Keyword traps and
treats” for more about sauces on the side.)
295
Chapter 18: Taking the Low-Carb Road to Restaurants

 Start with a cup of soup: Order a cup of soup and eat it slowly. This low-
carb choice will begin to fill you up. According to some research, eating
soup at the beginning of the meal slows your rate of eating. The soup
begins to fill your stomach, which signals the brain and curtails your
appetite. As a result, you eat less later.
 Consider constructing your own meal: Where is there a rule that says
you have to order an entree? Order a carb-friendly appetizer with a side
salad or order two of your favorite appetizers.
 When you’re done, get rid of your plate: Ask the waiter to take your
plate as soon as you finish eating, especially if any food is left on it. You
can’t continue to pick at your food after you feel full if it’s gone.
Cruising the Low-Carb World 
of Ethnic Dining
Ethnic restaurants aren’t off the low-carb map by any means. In fact, some of
them are great choices. Come with me on a little trip around the world and
explore some low-carb suggestions specific to various ethnic cuisines.
Chinese
Chinese restaurants always have plenty of tasty stir-fried veggies on their
menus. Try different dishes like Chinese cabbage or different combinations of
meat, chicken, and seafood with veggies. Sit-down Chinese restaurants usu-
ally make each dish to order, so if you want certain vegetables with shrimp,
for instance, and this dish isn’t on the menu, ask if the chef can stir it up for
you. More than likely, the restaurant is glad to comply with your wishes. Of
course, stay away from the white rice and the sweet-and-sour dishes. If it
tastes sweet in a Chinese restaurant, you better believe it is loaded with
sugar. And drink plenty of tea — tea somehow always tastes better in a
Chinese restaurant.
Greek
When I say Greek food, do you immediately think of gyros, baklava, and high
carbs? Interestingly enough, Greek food is mostly cooked with olive oil, and
the food is grilled. On the Greek restaurant menu, you’ll probably find grilled
shish kabobs of lamb and veggies or fish and veggies. Other entrees offered
may be grilled seafood or grilled vegetables and possibly a baked fish dish.
Greek salads are always tasty, too, and feel free to eat my share of olives.

Italian
I know you immediately think of pasta when you think of Italian food.
However, some good Italian restaurants have dishes to die for that fit into
your low-carb lifestyle. Try a delicious vegetable antipasto and a side salad.
You can actually make a meal out of that combination. I’ve had some awe-
some specialty salads in Italian restaurants, so check them out.
If the restaurant offers a Marsala entree, it’s probably low-carb safe because
it’s broth-based and cooked with Marsala wine. Also very Italian are veal pic-
cata and chicken piccata, which are made with white wine and capers. You
may run into some great red fish stew, cioppino, which has many different
kinds of seafood and fish in it. Cioppino is an entire meal in itself. Also, be
sure to ask about the specials when you’re eating Italian because restaurants
sometimes have fresh fish prepared in a very palate-pleasing manner.
Japanese
The best Japanese restaurants with the freshest ingredients are the ones
where you can watch them cook the meal. These restaurants have lots of
fresh ingredients available, as well as fresh seafood and meats. You can pick
and choose what you want from the menu, and they usually cater to special
requests, so don’t be shy. I’ve found that a lot of these types of restaurants
have early-bird specials in the evening, so watch for them so you can have a
tasty low-carb meal that’s easy on the pocketbook as well. If you’ve never had
this dining experience, it’s a treat, so try it at least once.
Nouvelle
Nouvelle cuisine is a style of French cooking that became popular in the
1970s. If you want to eat French food, go with nouvelle because the menu
tends to include garden-fresh ingredients, which fit well with your low-carb
lifestyle. The philosophy of Nouvelle cuisine includes veggies cooked crispy
fresh and fruit-based sauces rather than heavy sauces loaded with cream and
flour. If you’re feeling Frenchly adventuresome, you can opt for a menu item
called prix-fixe, which is very simply a bunch of courses in very small serv-
ings, which can be a real treat if you haven’t tried it. Although the French are
known for their sauces, some of them are lighter fare and wine-based, so ask
questions about sauces. If you must indulge in something a little heavier, ask
your server to please serve it on the side and maybe serve only half a por-
tion. On the menu, you also may find some delightful soufflés and ratatouille,
a vegetable dish cooked in olive oil, which are great options. If you’re lucky, a
poached fresh catch of the day may be available.
297
Chapter 18: Taking the Low-Carb Road to Restaurants

Mexican
A taco salad is a great choice for your low-carb lifestyle. I’m talking about the
one that comes in a big taco bowl with meat and tomatoes on top. But the
secret to this dish is to not eat the bowl. You can add fresh salsa and gua-
camole to your taco salad, too. These salads are usually huge, so make a
decision before you dive into your salad to get a to-go container. Guess what?
You have lunch for the next day. Another great choice is tasty Mexican fajitas
without the wraps that are usually served on the side. Just ask your waitper-
son to skip the wraps, and you are so low-carb.
Weighing the Dessert Decision
Don’t let your dinner friends urge you into eating a big dessert because “you
deserve it.” What you really deserve is to continue the healthy low-carb
lifestyle that’s working so well for you.
In my dining out experiences, I’ve been guilty of indulging in sumptuously
sweet endings on occasions. And there have been times I’ve paid for it by
feeling fuzzy, sluggish, and downright awful for three or four days afterwards.
After those indulgences, I’ve always been furious with myself, because one
serving of dessert can make the scales go up as much as 3 pounds overnight.
By making the decision to partake, I betray myself, and I set my healthy low-
carb lifestyle back. Is a piece of chocolate cake really worth it?
Only you can be the judge on this one. It’s your body and your health. Just be
careful with desserts. Order some juicy strawberries topped with real whipped
cream and a cup of hot, spiced tea or a frothy cappuccino (ask them to hold
the sugar in the cappuccino). If you really must splurge, order a dessert for
everyone at the table to share, and have just one or two bites. You’ll be glad
you didn’t eat the whole thing.

Brown-Bagging It, Low-Carb Style

 Packing your lunch and lovin’ it
 Creating a tasty low-carb lunch
 Looking at the prepackaged frozen possibilities
A
fter a tasty, nutritious low-carb breakfast (see Chapter 6 for recipes 
that fit the bill) and a mid-morning low-carb snack (see Chapter 14),
lunchtime comes rolling around. At this point in the day, most folks choose
one of three options: They skip the midday meal, head to a restaurant, or
turn to their lunch bag or refrigerator.
Right out of the gate, I’m here to rule out the first option. Any healthy eating
lifestyle encourages you not to skip meals, and your low-carb lifestyle is no
different. Skipping meals tends to make you ravenous and brings the possibil-
ity of overeating at your next real meal. In addition, food provides your body
with fuel, and skipping meals can leave you feeling sluggish. Eating lunch can
determine how you feel by mid-afternoon, as well as maintain afternoon alert-
ness and boost your energy levels.
As for the remaining lunch options — eating out and eating in — either can
be enjoyable as well as low-carb healthy. From my experience, the trusty
brown bag (or some snazzier version of a lunch carrier) is an easy option,
and it’s the most conducive to maintaining your low-carb lifestyle. In this
chapter, I tell you why packing your lunch is a stellar option, and I provide
you with all sorts of tips, tricks, and suggestions (including a recipe) for con-
trolling carbs when the clock strikes noon.

Bagging the Benefits 
of Taking Your Lunch
In my years in the corporate world, I ate out all the time. But then I finally got
smart and started taking my lunch to work with me. It took a little getting used
to, but once I did it, I almost dreaded going out. I’d prepare as much as I could
the night before in plastic sandwich bags and small plastic containers to cut
down on time in the mornings, and like everything else in life, after I got the
program down, it was just part of my routine.
With healthier eating being a priority, more and more people are packing
their lunches. If you want to eat exactly what you like and what gives you
energy, and you want to know for sure what’s in your lunch, then brown-
bagging is a great option. Planning your lunch puts you in total control of
your midday carb counts. And, controlling what you put in your mouth is
what your healthy low-carb lifestyle is all about at the end of the day, the
beginning of the day, and the middle of the day!
Don’t get me wrong. You may like to go out with co-workers or friends occa-
sionally for lunch. That’s great so long as you watch for hidden carbs in
seemingly carb-friendly lunch entrees (see Chapter 18 for some dining out
hints).
The benefits of packing your lunch far outweigh the downside of taking the
time to do it. With a low-carb lifestyle, packing your lunch at least a few days
a week falls into that “try it, I think you’ll like it” category. Anything new
sometimes seems intimidating, and the thought of adding one more thing to
your already overloaded schedule may make you tremble. But look at some
benefits of toting your lunch and see what you think after your read them.
 Introducing flexibility: One of the great benefits I enjoyed about brown-
bagging was the flexibility it allowed me. If I was buried in work at
my desk, I could eat right there and then take a walk afterward. Brown-
bagging also allows you to run errands at lunch. You can eat your lunch
at work and still have time to run an important errand in the middle of
the day. I always felt like I was getting ahead in the busy game of life
rather than wasting an hour standing in line or waiting for my food and
then rushing through my meal to get back to work on time.
 Enjoying variety: Variety is the spice — ah, yes! And who better knows
the spice of your low-carb life better than you. Breaking up your work
week and taking your lunch even a few days a week will add variety to
your days. And if you can work in even a 10-minute walk, you’ll enjoy
variety and possibly relieve some stress at the same.

Part IV: Eating Low-Carb on the Town and on the Run 

 Escaping: On the days I didn’t have errands to run during my lunch
hour, I’d go to a nearby park, take my shoes off, and enjoy lunch in my
own little world. Often I’d take a book and do a little reading, and other
times I’d make grocery lists or to-do lists. (I even turned off my cell
phone sometimes.) I’d always be refreshed after lunch in the park.
 Saving time: At first you may think, “I don’t have time to pack a lunch.”
I’m here to encourage you to just try it for a couple weeks and see how
much time you’ll actually save. You rush around all day at work because
you never have enough hours in the day. But if your lunch is packed and
waiting for you when lunchtime rolls around, I’ll bet that after it takes
you 10 minutes to eat, you’ll be sitting there for the first few days think-
ing, what do I do now? I got so that I dreaded the days that I had to go to
a restaurant and fight the crowds at lunch. I got back to my desk more
stressed than when I left for an hour that was supposed to be a break.
Well, give yourself a break —pack your lunch!
 Saving money: By packing a lunch each day, you probably save at least
$4 per day, which is more than $1,000 a year. Bet you can think of some-
thing to do with that extra grand.
When toting my lunch, I prefer to do it in style. If you don’t already own one
of those cute little insulated bags, then it’s time for a treat. I have one that’s
black with a leopard insert, and it’s cuter than a button. I think I paid $5 for it
at a discount store. You just pop the gel packs that come with the bag in the
freezer, and they keep your food very cold until lunchtime.
If you take hot soups in your lunch, then a thermos with a wide-mouth top is
another must-have. Pouring soups in and out is much easier if you have the
wide mouth as opposed to that skinny little opening in some insulated
vacuum containers. If you have a microwave available at work, you don’t
need a thermos. Just pack frozen soup in your little lunch bag without any
frozen bags, and by lunchtime, the soup has started to thaw and just needs a
few minutes in the microwave.
Be sure to keep cold foods cold (below 40 degrees) and hot foods hot (above
140 degrees). Bacteria thrive best in the range of 40 to 140 degrees. Don’t
take a chance on eating food that could be hazardous to your health.
If you have a low-carb friend at work, eating lunch with her once a week may
be fun. Take turns — one week you bring the low-carb lunch, and the next
week your friend brings it. You can either go to the park or eat together in the
office lunchroom. You’ll add a little variety to your lunch routine, and you
and your friend can share your low-carb lifestyle tricks and tips.

Chapter 19: Brown-Bagging It, Low-Carb Style

Packing Delightful Low-Carb Lunches
Think about your lunch entree as much as you do your dinner entree. All of
your meals as part of your low-carb lifestyle are important, but lunch is sup-
posed to give you a boost and a jump-start for the rest of the day. You can
pack so much low-carb delicious variety into your lunch bag. And there’s a
huge element of satisfaction when you know what you’re having when
lunchtime rolls around. And if you pack some of your favorite low-carb foods
in your lunch bag, you’ll probably find yourself really looking forward to
lunch instead of dreading going out and fighting the crowds in a restaurant. I
always throw in a small resealable bag of crunchy veggies that can pinch-hit
as snacks if I get hungry mid-morning or in the middle of the afternoon.
When shopping for lunch ingredients, steer clear of processed meats and
lunch meats, because they’re full of preservatives, hidden carbs, hidden
sugars, and sodium. Go straight to the deli counter instead.
Sensational salads
If you’ve been with me for most of this book, you’ve long forgotten that
boring iceberg lettuce. Instead, you’re keeping your favorite prewashed leafy
greens and crunchy salad veggies on hand. Make plenty of your favorite
homemade vinaigrette dressing (see Chapter 8 for recipes) to keep around
also.
Find a plastic container that fits your tummy. In other words, take enough to
fill you up at lunch. Fill it with leafy greens. If you had chicken for dinner the
night before, add some chunks of chicken. Tuna is good on top of a salad too.
Don’t forget about fresh fruits, cheeses, and nuts for crunch. If you don’t
want to combine all the ingredients in the morning, just pack your leafy
greens in the plastic container and put the other ingredients in individual
self-sealing plastic bags. Keep a supply of paper plates at work, combine all
the ingredients at lunchtime, and top with your favorite dressing.
Put your salad dressing in a small, self-sealing bag, and place it in the con-
tainer with your salad mixings. If the bag should leak, the dressing doesn’t
end up all over the inside of your lunch tote.
302

Waldorf Salad to Go
This salad makes the best lunch ever, and it’s light but filling enough to keep you going
all afternoon. Because it contains mayonnaise, keep it cold on the way to work in your
insulated lunch bag with two of the little “ice” packets that come with the bag — frozen
of course. One freezer bag on the top and one on the bottom of the plastic container are
quite adequate. Refrigerate it until lunchtime. Enjoy this great lunch treat to go.
Preparation time: 15 minutes

Wonderful wraps
Wraps make a great low-carb lunch and are quick to prepare. The combina-
tions of wraps are endless (see Chapter 15 for lots of wrap recipes and ideas).
You can, for instance, wrap up the Waldorf Salad I discuss in the preceding
section. There are very few of your favorite ingredients you can’t wrap up!

You can prepare your wraps in advance and place them in tightly sealed plas-
tic wrap or take the ingredients in your lunch tote and roll them at work.
Consider these wrap ideas for your lunch:
 Hummus is low in carbs and is delicious in a low-carb tortilla with fresh
bell peppers, cucumbers, and tomatoes.
 Drizzle some Italian dressing on a low-carb tortilla, add a slice of deli
turkey, and pile on fresh salad greens. Drizzle a little more dressing on
top of the greens, roll it, and you’re set.
 Wrap black soybeans, red onions, a bit of cilantro, a touch of olive oil,
and shredded cheddar cheese in a low-carb tortilla or even a lettuce leaf.
 Combine a dab of your favorite mustard (Dijon or some other delicacy)
with a dab of mayo and mix well. Spread the mustard-mayo combo 
on a whole-wheat, low-carb tortilla. Top with a slice of deli turkey (or
chicken). Chop half a piece of provolone cheese, and sprinkle it in the
middle of the tortilla on top of the meat. Add some chopped tomatoes
and finely chopped Italian parsley and roll it up.
 Try your favorite marinated vegetable salad in a low-carb tortilla (turn
to Chapter 12 for a recipe idea).
Instead of a tortilla as a base for your wrap, use 2 or 3 pieces of deli ham,
turkey, or chicken for a change in venue. Something as simple as deli ham
with a slice of cheese rolled up can be very satisfying. I also like a slice of deli
turkey spread with cream cheese and rolled tightly.
Luscious leftovers
You’re cooking up a storm these days, and some awesome quick and nutri-
tious low-carb meals are coming out of your kitchen: homemade soups (see
Chapter 7), meats (see Chapter 11), fish entrees (see Chapter 9), and some
great veggie dishes (see Chapter 12). Obviously, all this cooking means more
and more leftovers frequenting your fridge — which is when low-carb cook-
ing really gets fun. You cook once and eat the meal twice, saving time and
money in the process. What a great combination!
Maybe you had a great plate of steamed veggies for dinner. Those veggies are
perfect for lunch the next day served cold with your favorite low-carb dip or
some ranch salad dressing. You can use hummus for a veggie dip too.
Another great leftover for lunch is quiche. I happen to like cold quiche, but if
you prefer it warm, just pop it in the microwave at work (see Chapter 6 for
304
Part IV: Eating Low-Carb on the Town and on the Run 

great quiche recipes). Coming in a close second to quiche in the race for the
lunchbox are frittatas. So if you’re making frittatas for Sunday morning break-
fast, think about making a couple extra for Monday’s lunch. You’ll get to the
point that you look forward to having leftovers from a great-tasting low-carb
meal at home so that you can take them for lunch the next day.
Because soup is hot, you eat it more slowly, and it gives your brain time to
talk to your stomach and say, “Hey, I’m full now.” Soup is great at lunchtime
(see Chapter 7 for some recipes). Here are a few souper tips (sorry, I couldn’t
resist):
 Liven up your soups with shredded cheese. Just pack a small amount of
shredded cheese in a self-sealing plastic bag and sprinkle the cheese on
top of your heated-up soup.
 If you use a vacuum bottle to tote your soup, preheat the bottle with
boiling water for about 5 minutes before placing the hot soup in the
thermos, and your soup will stay hotter longer.
Little lunch packables
Don’t forget to include some delightful side items in your lunchbox, like low-
carb yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, string cheese, or nuts. If you like fruit
in your yogurt, pack frozen blueberries in a self-sealing plastic bag. By
lunchtime, they’re thawed and ready to stir into your yogurt. Add a packet of
Splenda sugar substitute and sprinkle in some crunchy pecans, and you have
a real treat for lunch.
Vacuum-sealed packets of salmon and tuna in water are great lunch pack-
ables that can be rolled in a low-carb tortilla, stirred with a little mayo and
hard-boiled egg, or eaten plain with tomato slices.

Fresh fruit kabobs
Prepare seasonal fresh fruit, such as strawber-
ries, melon, and kiwi, with cubes of various
cheeses like Swiss, medium cheddar, or moz-
zarella. Alternate the fruit and cheese on
wooden skewers. You can tightly wrap these
prepared kabobs in plastic wrap and include
them in your lunchbox. These kabobs are espe-
cially good in the summer because they’re so
refreshing. You can also make a very quick dip
for these kabobs with cream cheese, a packet
of Splenda, and enough light cream to blend
with the mixer to make the mixture dippable.

Delicious desserts
No, I haven’t forgotten dessert in your lunchbox. I’m a dessert lover after all.
Here are few ways to end your lunch on a sweet yet light note:
 Fruit: You can cut melon into chunks and tote them in plastic containers
or self-sealing plastic bags. Other fruit options are tangerines, nectarines,
dark plums, grapes, kiwi, apples, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries,
or pears or peaches every now and then (pears aren’t the lowest-carb
fruit around). There are also new low-carb canned fruits packed in their
own juices that are great. You can find them at most grocery stores. Just
watch the sugar content and the calorie counts.
 Sugar-free gelatins and puddings: You can make sugar-free gelatin or
pudding at home, put it in a small plastic container with a lid, and pop
it in your lunch bag. I suggest you make the gelatin and pudding, even
though you can find them in the grocery store already made and pack-
aged. They’re rather pricey, and you can make a whole batch for what
you’d pay for one small prepackaged container.
 Meringue cookies: Throw a few in a little container and indulge with a
hot cup of tea. Speaking of meringues, you can pack a meringue shell in
a plastic container and some fresh fruit in another plastic container and
then dump the fruit in the meringue shell after you have your lunch.
Your co-workers will be jealous of your dessert. Try doing some low-
carb baking on the weekends, and you’ll have sweet treats to tote with
you all week. (Chapter 13 has several meringue recipes that you’re
gonna love.) Ah — the decadence of packing a low-carb lunch.
Peeking in the Frozen Food Case
I encourage you to make your own lunches at home, but realistically, I also
know that doing so isn’t always possible. And some new dinners popping up
in your grocer’s frozen food case boast low-carb counts and taste just dandy.
Shop the frozen food section at the grocery store with care. I offer you a word
of caution not to read only the front of the food package that offers you the
net carb count. Instead, read the entire Nutrition Facts label on the back of
the package (flip to Chapter 3 to become a label-reading expert). Check for
hidden sugars, sodium, as well as the calorie counts. Sometimes the calorie
counts are off the charts, and what good does that do you?
If you take a frozen dinner to work with you, make sure that a freezer is avail-
able for storage of your entree until you pop it in the microwave at lunch.
Letting the frozen dinner thaw before you cook it isn’t a good idea.

Yikes! You just came flying through the door
from a long day, it’s 6:30 p.m., and you don’t
have a clue what’s for dinner. Sound a bit familiar?
How would you like to change this picture? There
seems to be a strange myth associated with low-
carb healthy living and cooking. The myth is that
you have to spend hours in the kitchen to serve up nutritious meals. Take it
from an old-fashioned, Midwestern cook — nothing is farther from the truth.
By shifting a couple gears, your low-carb kitchen can turn out all kinds of
delicious meals quickly. You can also become more creative in your cooking,
which is great news for your low-carb lifestyle because it brings variety to
your table.
Recognizing the Power of a Plan
If you’re flying through the door at 6:30 p.m. without a clue of what you’re
going to prepare for dinner, that can spell trouble. But take it one step fur-
ther: If the refrigerator is running on empty, you’re really up a creek. I know
that planning sounds like something you just don’t have time to do, but it can

really pay off by actually saving you time in the end. Imagine walking in the
door at 6:30 p.m. with the fridge and cupboards full of low-carb staples, and
you have already planned a menu for the evening. What a concept, huh? The
time that you’ll save simply by not stopping at the grocery store on your way
home is huge — and you don’t have to stand in those aggravating after-work
checkout lines. When you have a plan, you’re not roaming the kitchen waiting
for an idea for dinner to jump out of the cupboard at you. You’re armed and
ready, reducing stress and complementing your low-carb lifestyle with a great
preplanned healthy meal. Feel the power of preplanning! In Chapter 3, I help
you stock your kitchen with all the low-carb staples you need to make it
through the day. Check it out. Go ahead. I’ll wait right here.
Having no dinner plan and no healthy, wholesome foods to work with is one
of the easiest ways to get into trouble with your low-carb lifestyle. Think
about it. What do you do? You either rummage through the cupboards and
come up with some old snack foods that make you feel miserable after you
eat them, or you jump in your car and are so tired and hungry that you turn
into the first drive-thru fast food restaurant you see.
I graciously give you the key to creating quick, healthy, low-carb meals in one
word — planning. Planning ahead makes creating menu options that fit your
low-carb lifestyle a pleasure rather than a chore.
Planning ahead isn’t that difficult — trust me. You do it all the time or at least
most of the time: If you have to be at work at 8 a.m., you plan ahead to give
yourself time to shower and dress, grab some coffee and breakfast, and drive
to work so you arrive on time. Lunchtime rolls around, and you may plan to
dine out with a friend or co-worker, or you may have thought ahead and
brought your lunch to work (see Chapter 19 for ideas for brown-bagging it).
Heck, you may have even planned to run some errands or work out right
after work before you head home.
But this is where the picture gets murky for many folks. What do you do
about dinner? Surprisingly, research shows that more than 70 percent of
Americans don’t decide what they’re going to eat for their evening meal until
well after 4 p.m. But doesn’t it make sense that you’d plan what you’re going
to have for your evening meal? After all, you owe it to yourself as a reward for
surviving the long day.
Plan ahead and keep some smart snacks on hand so you can nibble on some-
thing healthy and low-carb while you’re cooking a quick dinner. Nuts are
always good, and I like to crunch on celery with a little dilled cream cheese
while I cook. If you love dill pickles, roll up a crunchy pickle spear in a slice of
deli turkey. Sometimes foods with crunchy textures ward off hunger pangs
better than other choices.

Part IV: Eating Low-Carb on the Town and on the Run 

The freezer is your friend
Keeping your freezer stocked with frozen veggies, meats, and even frozen
herbs really helps you in your quest for healthy, low-carb meals in minutes. If
you run out of the fresh stuff in the fridge, you need back-ups in the freezer.
Be sure to add items to your grocery list as you take them from your freezer.
Keep in mind that homemade soups and stews freeze well, so make a big
batch on the weekend and stick it in your freezer. Then simply pop the frozen
item in the fridge to thaw as you’re running out the door to work. When you
get home that night, you have homemade soup in minutes.
You can also opt for freezing individual servings in those semi-disposable
freezer containers. Use containers of the same size so you can stack them
nicely in the freezer, thus maximizing space. These containers are inexpen-
sive, and I find them at the dollar store in packages of four for a dollar. They
come in all shapes and sizes, and I use them over and over. Freezing individ-
ual servings adds another option for grabbing something from the freezer to
take to work for lunch.
A list is your lifesaver
Buy one of those to-do or list-type notepads with a magnet on the back and
stick it in the middle of your fridge. Tie a pen or pencil to another magnet.
(This method should be incorporated after you stock your low-carb kitchen
with basics; see Chapter 3 for details.)
When you find a recipe that’s appealing to you and you don’t have the ingre-
dient, write it on the list. When you’re close to running out of something in
the pantry, the fridge, or the freezer, write it on the list. Some people even go
so far as categorizing their lists according to produce, frozen foods, fresh veg-
etables, meats — you get the picture. That method may sound like overkill,
but it can actually save you time in the grocery store, and you like to save
time, don’t ya?
Scheduling a Week of Low-Carb Meals
The country club even has chili night on Wednesday, so why not adopt a sim-
ilar schedule for your house? Look at your week and your household’s
favorite meals. I suggest you create a two-week schedule with ten different
meal varieties, and then you can begin to mix and match as the weeks
progress.
309
Chapter 20: Cooking Dinner in a Low-Carb Heartbeat

Your new meal schedule for a week may look something like the following.
You can accomplish this full week of meals by going to the grocery store no
more than twice a week. Do your main shopping over the weekend and then
stop by the store once during the week for some fresh produce. That’s it! And
because you’re becoming a master planner and list maker, these trips to the
grocery store should be no sweat.
 Monday: Slow Cooker Night. Mondays are hectic, but you may have
time on Sunday nights to prepare something to pop in the slow cooker
as you dash out the door on Monday morning. Your slow cooker offers
variety in very low-carb meals. See Chapter 16 for slow cooker recipes.
 Tuesday: Stir-Fry Night. Stir-frying is without a doubt one of the quick-
est ways to a complete nutritious meal. If you had chicken in the slow
cooker on Monday night, you may have leftovers to toss in your stir-fry.
Look for varieties of frozen veggies, especially the packaged kinds, for
stir-frying. Grocery stores are beginning to package fresh produce the
same way. See Chapters 11 and 12 for some stir-fry recipes.
 Wednesday: Packet Cooking Night. Packet cooking is a quick and easy
way to prepare nutritious meals, and there’s very little clean-up. You can
cook anything from fish to chicken to a combination of meats and veg-
gies. (See the “Packet Cooking” section later in the chapter.)
 Thursday: Grilling Night. You can grill steak, pork chops, lamb, 
chicken — the choice is yours. And to jazz up your grilling night, just
plan ahead and place the meat in a marinade on Wednesday night before
you go to bed. Also, do yourself a favor and invest in a grilling basket for
veggies, so you can prepare your whole meal on the grill.
 Friday: Soup and Salad Night. Have a variety of greens on hand, some
fresh veggies, and even some deli meats and cheeses for your big salad
night. Buy prewashed, ready-to-eat greens, and just dump them in a big
salad bowl with your other low-carb ingredients of choice and some
homemade vinaigrette (see Chapter 8 for recipes). For soup, have home-
made soup in the freezer that you made in advance (see the section
“The freezer is your friend,” earlier in the chapter), or whip up a quick
batch (check out Chapter 7).
Variety is the spice of life, and this menu plan is just the beginning. When you
get into the swing of scheduling your meals, all kinds of other quick ideas will
come to you. Here are two more to consider working in:
 Breakfast Night: Breakfast isn’t just a morning meal anymore. Check out
some quick breakfast recipes in Chapter 6 and have breakfast for dinner
once in a while.
 Skillet Supper Night: Be sure to include skillet suppers in your sched-
ules (see the “Skillet Suppers” section later in the chapter). Skillet sup-
pers are hearty meals, and you cook the whole meal in one skillet. If you
want to add a salad, you’re good to go quickly with little cleanup.

Rosemary Steak
The rub for this recipe is an incredible combination of flavors and spices that results in
one of the best steaks ever if you’re looking for a little variety rather than just another
steak. If you haven’t cooked with fresh rosemary, do yourself a culinary favor — I guar-
antee you’re in for a treat!
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Refrigeration time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 8 to 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 boneless New York strip steaks, 6 ounces
each
2 cloves garlic, minced fine
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons finely minced fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon pepper
4 fresh sprigs of rosemary for garnish
(optional)
1 With a sharp knife, score both sides of the steaks very shallowly in a diamond pattern.
2 In a small bowl, combine the garlic, olive oil, rosemary, lemon zest, sea salt, and pepper,
mixing well. Rub the mixture on the steaks. Refrigerate for at least 25 minutes.
3 Grill the steaks on a gas grill on medium-high heat for about 4 minutes on each side, or
until desired doneness (4 minutes per side will give you medium-rare steaks).
4 Slice the steaks diagonally in 1⁄2-inch slices. Garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs, if
desired.

Chicken and Veggie Stir-Fry
This recipe is quick, quick, quick — with a hearty flavor and fresh taste. It’ll work great
on one of your stir-fry nights. The great thing is that you dump it all in one skillet and
have a meal in literally minutes. Stir-fry and skillet meals are great for your low-carb
lifestyle because they get you in and out of the kitchen quickly and provide a wonderful
home-cooked healthy meal. Depending on how many you’re serving, you might even be
lucky enough to have some leftovers for lunch the next day. To make this dish even
easier to prepare, pick up fresh mushrooms that are already sliced and peppers that are
already cut up (in the frozen section). To thaw your frozen stir-fry veggies in this recipe,
just put them in the fridge in the morning. They’ll be good to go by dinnertime.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: About 20 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
1 pound skinless boneless chicken breast
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium yellow onion, sliced
1 can (14 ounces) bean sprouts, drained
1 can (8 ounces) sliced water chestnuts,
drained
4 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup mixed frozen bell peppers (not
necessary to thaw)
1 package (16 ounces) frozen stir-fry veggies,
thawed
1 cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon freshly grated gingerroot
1⁄4 cup soy sauce
1 Cut the chicken into thin strips. Using a large skillet or wok, cook the chicken over
medium heat, stirring often until juices run clear in chicken, about 7 minutes.
2 Add the garlic and onion to the chicken in the skillet and cook for 3 minutes.
3 Add the bean sprouts, water chestnuts, mushrooms, peppers, and stir-fry veggies. Cook
the mixture for 3 to 4 minutes or just until crisp-tender.
4 Combine the broth, gingerroot, and soy sauce. Stir the broth mixture into the skillet
mixture. Bring to a boil and continue cooking for 1 minute.
5 Serve immediately.

Salmon Fillets with 
Tarragon Cream Sauce
This recipe is a culinary delight, and it’s a great way to take in some of those important
omega-3s (discover the importance of omega-3s in Chapter 9). Serve this with some
steamed veggies on the side, and you have a meal that guests will think you spent hours
in the kitchen preparing. Ah, the secrets of quick cooking pay such great dividends.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 12 to 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 scallions (white part only)
1 Roma tomato
2 tablespoons butter
4 fresh salmon fillets (about 4 ounces each)
Salt and pepper
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2⁄3 cup light cream
1⁄4 cup dry sherry
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh tarragon
1 Finely chop the scallions. Remove the seeds from the tomato and finely chop. Set both
aside.
2 Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Season the fillets with salt
and pepper to taste.
3 Place the fillets in the skillet and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, turning only once. Transfer the
fish to a platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.
4 Add the scallions to the skillet and cook over low heat for 3 minutes. Stir occasionally
and don’t allow them to brown.
5 Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the cornstarch. Return to low heat and
slowly stir in the cream and sherry. Stirring constantly, let the mixture simmer until it
thickens — about 3 or 4 minutes.
6 Add the tarragon and the chopped tomatoes to the cream sauce in the skillet, stirring to
combine well. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the sauce over the fillets.
Serve immediately.

Packet Cooking
You’re going to love this style of low-carb cooking! Wrapped in parchment
paper or foil, the contents steam while the juices of the meat, fish, or poultry
mingle with the herbs you’ve chosen. And the vegetables present a flavorful
and nutritious burst when you serve the packet. Packet cooking is kind of like
a mini pressure cooker minus the pressure, and it’s fast. Foods are cooked at
high temperatures, usually 425 to 450 degrees. Less fat is needed because
you’re using high temperatures, and food cooks in its own juices, keeping it
moist and upping the concentration of the natural flavors of the food.
You can cook anything in a packet — well not a cake — but fish, poultry,
meats of all kinds, veggies, and even fruits for desserts. This packet cooking
is good stuff, I tell you!
If that isn’t enough to get you into low-carb packet cooking made easy, here
are a few more reasons for you to jump in:
 You can cook an entire meal in handy individual servings. You can
cook your veggies and meat together in individual packets. Cut those
veggies a bit smaller than usual so they’ll be done at the same time the
meat is.
 Packet cooking makes make-ahead meals a snap. Just prepare the
packets the night before, and when you walk through the door, simply
preheat the oven while you’re changing into something more comfort-
able. Pop the packets in the oven, and dinner is served!
 You can cook the packets in the oven or on the grill. If it’s a hot
summer night, you can stay inside in the air conditioning while your
packet meal cooks on the grill and doesn’t heat up the entire house.
 The individual servings are great if your family can’t all sit down to
dinner at the same time. When a hungry member of the family comes
through the door, just pop a packet in the oven, and he’ll have a hearty
and healthy fresh meal in minutes.
Parchment paper and aluminum foil both work, and I love the presentation of
parchment paper for those times when a dramatic touch is nice, when time is
of the essence and convenience is a must. My vote, however, is solidly behind
heavy-duty aluminum foil. Foil packets offer the following advantages:
 They easily withstand the high temperatures of packet cooking whether
it’s in the oven or on the grill.
 They produce more liquid, because they’re more airtight than the parch-
ment packets.
314
Part IV: Eating Low-Carb on the Town and on the Run 

 They make crimping and sealing the packet a breeze.
 They allow you to prepare food in advance, which you can’t do with
parchment.
If you’re wondering how to fold these little packets, see Figure 20-1. These
particular instructions are geared for foil, and they’re just one of many differ-
ent ways to fold your packet (see Chapter 9 for some instructions on using
parchment paper for cooking fish in a packet).
The key to successful packet cooking is making sure the seal is very tight
throughout the cooking.
With packet cooking, you can cook many foods in individual servings in 10 to
20 minutes, and the cleanup consists of tossing the foil or the parchment.
Cooking individual servings also reduces the cooking time, which means you
get out of the kitchen faster. Isn’t this time-saving stuff fun?

up, and I’ll

Quick cooking hints
Here are some tips to help speed up your cook-
ing and reduce your overall time in the kitchen:
 Use your microwave for melting butter and
thawing foods quickly.
 Keep two sets of measuring cups on hand
so you don’t have to wipe one out or wash
it when measuring consecutive ingredients.
 Clean up as you go along so you get out of
the kitchen faster. Doing so also makes the
cooking time seem shorter.
 Use your freezer to cut down on prep time.
Freeze shredded cheeses, and they will
keep for a long time and are easily accessi-
ble. Chop fresh red, green, and yellow bell
peppers in 1⁄2 cup quantities and freeze them
in self-sealing plastic bags and freeze. Do
the same with onions in 1⁄4 cup quantities
and fresh basil and Italian parsley in smaller
quantities. These are great time-savers 
for stir-fries, soups, casseroles, and skillet
suppers.

Steamed Fish and Veggies
Fish and veggies are a great combination in packet cooking because they both cook so
quickly. You’re going to be amazed at the flavors that packet cooking captures and the
way the process accentuates the herbs and spices. This one is sure to spoil you and
spur you on to more packet cooking that’s so low-carb user friendly.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 18 minutes
Yield: 1 serving (can easily be doubled)
1 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spray a 12-x-15-inch piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil
with the cooking spray. Place the fish in the middle of the foil.
2 Place the zucchini and squash on top of the fish fillet. Sprinkle with the lemon juice,
parsley, lemon pepper, and dill.
3 Fold the foil over and fold the edges in twice, making a pouch for the fish fillet. Place on
a baking sheet.
4 Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until the veggies are crisp-tender and the fish easily flakes
with a fork.

Skillet Suppers
I’ve been cooking for a long time, and I still rely on my cast-iron skillets and
Dutch oven. In fact, I can’t cook without them! My Grandad McCracken
bought them for me a hundred years ago for a wedding gift. I’m still using the
same ones! (See Figure 20-2 for a picture of a cast-iron skillet.) I’ll admit that
new, heavy-bottomed skillets are available that do almost as good a job hold-
ing heat as the cast iron. (But cast iron definitely has its merits, and it’s like
anything else you’re accustomed to — cast iron is just comfortable for me.)
So don’t shy away from these great recipes just because you may not cook in
cast iron. Use whatever cookware puts you in your own cooking comfort
zone. Just get cookin’!
Cooking with cast iron has a bit of a reputation of being difficult to deal 
with — especially getting it ready to use for the first time. But I just found out
that there’s a company out there that now makes preseasoned, ready-to-use
cast iron cookware. (If you’re interested in finding out more about cast iron,
you can check out Cast-Iron Cooking For Dummies, written by Tracy Barr and
published by Wiley.)
Skillet suppers may seem kind of old-fashioned, but they fit very well into
your low-carb healthy lifestyle and your desire for quick meals. Skillet sup-
pers also conjure up a feeling that you’re eating comfort food, which is
always welcome to low-carbers. If you have a pretty skillet, you can take it
directly to the table and serve from it. Dinner is ready in a matter of minutes
with very little cleanup.

It’s all in the skillet! Fresh ingredients cook up quickly, and the skillet doubles as a serv-
ing platter — it goes straight from stovetop to the table, so it’s no-muss, no-fuss cook-
ing. Your rewards are a great meal and low-maintenance cleanup. This is low-carb
comfort food at its freshest and finest. And the end result is pretty too.
Preparation time: 12 minutes

Chapter 20: Cooking Dinner in a Low-Carb Heartbeat
2 tablespoons butter, divided
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 4
ounces each
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
2 medium tart apples, peeled and sliced
1⁄2 cup apple juice
1⁄4 cup light cream

on both sides, about 8 minutes per side over medium heat. Sprinkle with the salt and
pepper and remove from the skillet. Cover to keep warm.
2 In the same skillet, cook the apples in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter just until
tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from the skillet and cover to keep warm.
3 Add the apple juice to the skillet, stirring constantly for about 4 minutes, until the juice
is reduced by half. Combine the cream and 1⁄4 cup water to make a milk mixture, and add
it to the apple juice in the skillet.
4 Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for 10 minutes, or until the juices
from the chicken run clear.
5 In a small bowl, combine the 1 tablespoon water and the cornstarch so there are no
lumps and stir the mixture into the juices in the skillet. Bring to a boil, cooking and stir-
ring for about 2 minutes, or until the mixture begins to thicken.

Turkey Brats and Cabbage
This great skillet supper provides a bit of a crunch at the end of the day. You’re going to
need a nice large skillet for cooking this one, and I recommend using a Dutch oven if
you have one. Be sure to start your onions cooking first so you can keep the crunch in
your cabbage.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Small head green cabbage (about 11⁄2 pounds)
1 medium yellow onion
1 package (20 ounces) turkey bratwurst
Nonstick cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil
3⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 Cut the cabbage in quarters through the core and remove the core. Cut the cabbage in
1⁄4-inch slices. Set aside.
2 Cut the onion in half and then in 1⁄2-inch slices. Set aside.
3 Cut the bratwursts into 1-inch pieces
4 Coat a large, heavy skillet (or Dutch oven) with the cooking spray. Cook the bratwurst
pieces over medium-high heat for about 8 minutes, or until they’re browned on all
sides. Drain (depending on how lean your brats are) and remove the bratwurst pieces
from the skillet. Set aside and keep warm.
5 Using the same skillet, add the olive oil and the onion slices. Stirring often, cook for
about 5 minutes. Then add the cabbage and continue cooking the onions and cabbage
for another 6 minutes. Sprinkle with the garlic powder, pepper, and soy sauce, cooking
and stirring for an additional 4 minutes.
6 Return the bratwurst pieces to the skillet and cook an additional 2 minutes. Cover and
reduce the heat to low. Simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender
and the bratwurst pieces are cooked through.
Variation: Feel free to substitute the brats with a specialty sausage. I buy a chicken
sausage with spinach, fontina, and roasted garlic that’s nothing short of divine. And the
great news is that these sausages have 1 gram of carbs each. Be adventuresome and shop
around a bit — you may be delightfully surprised at what you find.

Chapter 20: Cooking Dinner in a Low-Carb Heartbeat
30-Minute Chicken
Here you have “quickie chicky.” By cooking the chicken on high heat and sealing it in
aluminum foil, the chicken cooks quickly, and the juices are sealed in, making the end
result tantalizingly moist. With the veggies, this entree needs no other sides, making it a
very quick low-carb meal.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 medium yellow onion, sliced thin
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend
1⁄2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 medium zucchinis, sliced
1 can (141⁄2 ounces) diced tomatoes,
undrained
3⁄4 teaspoon dried basil
1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cloves garlic, minced fine
4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan
cheese
1 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Coat a 9-x-13-x-2-inch baking dish with the cooking
spray.
2 Place the chicken in the baking dish and top with the onion slices. Sprinkle with the
pepper and seasoning blend.
3 Layer the mushrooms over the chicken and layer the zucchini on top of the 
mushrooms.
4 In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes with the basil, oregano, and garlic. Pour the
tomato mixture over the chicken and vegetables. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.
5 Bake for 30 minutes, making sure the chicken juices run clear at the end of the baking
time. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Part IV: Eating Low-Carb on the Town and on the Run 
Quick low-carb quesadillas
I suggest you always have whole-wheat, low-
carb tortillas on hand (they keep for quite a
while in the refrigerator), as well as shredded
cheeses in the freezer. With those two ingredi-
ents available, you can whip up some low-carb
quesadillas in a hurry. Just preheat the broiler
and place the low-carb tortillas on a baking
sheet. Top with shredded cheddar cheese 
and, if you like, a little chopped onion, diced
tomato, drained green chiles, or whatever carb-
conscious ingredients you have on hand. Place
the tortillas under the broiler. Watch them care-
fully and, when the cheese begins to melt, fold
the tortillas in half and broil them until crisp (this
happens very quickly). Cut into wedges and
serve with a nice salsa.
Always practice safe leftover-handling procedures by transferring
cooked food to shallow containers, covering tightly, and refrigerat-
ing promptly. The bacterial content of unrefrigerated food can
double in 20 minutes. Be sure to eat leftovers within a couple days.

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
F
irst, I show you ways to simplify your low-carb cook-
ing. My suggestions include things like buying certain
prepared foods and using your grill and slow cooker. You
find a chapter with a list of foods that are packed full of so
much of the right stuff — including cruciferous veggies,
nuts, blackberries, and black soybeans — that you’ll be
able to eat more of them and still lose weight. I know
you’re thirsty for even more information than I’ve packed
between the front and the back covers of this book, so I
include a list of Web sites offering lots of free stuff — free
low-carb information and free online low-carb magazines
and low-carb e-zines — and other helpful material, such as
online pedometer support and information and nutritional
Web sites that you can spend hours navigating. They all
offer support on your yellow brick road to a healthy low-
carb lifestyle.

Chapter 21
Ten Easy Ways to Simplify 
Your Low-Carb Cooking
In This Chapter
 Planning ahead and staying prepared
 Letting someone else do the work
 Using quick and easy cooking techniques
T
ricks to simplify your low-carb cooking include everything from stocking
up on low-carb staples to investing in handy kitchen gadgets. This chap-
ter includes several ideas to make your time in the kitchen a little easier and
get you out of there a little faster, without sacrificing great low-carb meals.
Keep an Ongoing Shopping List
Buy one of those list pads with a magnet on the back, stick it on your fridge,
and keep a running list of low-carb staples and ingredients you run out of.
Keeping a list on the fridge saves you a ton of time when you go grocery
shopping. You don’t have to rack your brains in the produce section trying to
remember what you used up three days ago. Nothing is worse than having
your heart set on trying a new recipe and finding out midway through making
it that you’re short some ingredients because you didn’t make a list.
Plan Meals in Advance
Do yourself a big favor, and don’t wait until 4:30 p.m. to figure out what you’re
going to make for dinner tonight. Planning your meals in advance is a biggie if
you want to be successful in your low-carb healthy lifestyle. After you get
accustomed to planning your meals, you’ll find that doing so not only simpli-
fies your low-carb cooking life but keeps your weight in check. Planning
ahead helps keep you from eating whatever is available, which could easily
be foods loaded with carbs. (See Chapter 20 for more on planning meals.)

Stock Your Kitchen with 
Low-Carb Basics
Make sure you have a well-stocked low-carb pantry. I don’t expect you to ini-
tially spend a couple hundred dollars stocking your pantry. As you continue
on your low-carb path, I think you’ll find it natural to pick up an extra pack-
age of frozen veggies just in case you don’t have fresh ones on hand the next
time you stir up a meal. (See Chapter 3 for stocking your low-carb pantry.)
Buy Food Already Prepared for You
The grocery store offers a ton of real timesavers these days. No longer do
you have to spend time chopping veggies, because they come pre-chopped in
the frozen food section and in the fresh produce section. Tasty lettuce and
greens combinations are already washed and pre-packaged — just add dress-
ing. The deli is another good stop for things including freshly sliced cheeses
and fresh-cut deli meats like turkey, chicken, and ham, which aren’t usually
full of preservatives. The deli folks have all the nutrition available, but you
usually have to ask for it.
When you’re working late, you may want to pick up one of those broasted
whole lemon chickens, which are tasty and quite acceptable in your low-carb
lifestyle. Just watch out for all of those prepared salads in that ready-to-eat
case — stay away from them, please. Also be wary of precut fruits, because
they’re often overpriced.
Prepare Your Veggies in Steamer Baskets
If you don’t have a stainless steel steamer basket, I strongly suggest you buy
this kitchen gadget. Steamer baskets are cheap, and you can adapt them to
various-sized pots that are already in your cupboard. Steamed veggies main-
tain almost all of their nutritional value. (Slide over to Chapter 12 for some
great veggie recipes.) After you eat crisp-tender veggies from a steamer
basket, you’ll never want to see boiled and waterlogged veggies again —
much less eat them. You can also use your steamer for fish and shellfish.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Have Parchment Paper on Hand
Parchment paper is wonderful stuff. If you’re not familiar with its many
advantages, give it a whirl. You can use it to line cookie sheets and baking
dishes or to wrap food in (see Chapter 9 for a great halibut recipe cooked in a
parchment packet). Parchment paper is coated on both sides, usually with
silicon, and comes on a roll like wax paper. You just tear off what you need.
You’ll find it at the grocery store with the aluminum foil and wax paper.
Parchment paper may look delicate to you, but don’t let looks fool you: It
withstands high heat, and whatever you cook on it won’t stick to the paper!
(And check out Chapter 20 for some great packet recipes that use foil.)
Consider a Slow Cooker
If you don’t own a slow cooker, I encourage you to make this low-carb invest-
ment. Preparing healthy, delicious meals is a major goal of your low-carb
healthy lifestyle, and a slow cooker helps you accomplish just that. If you
don’t have experience with one of these little timesaving gadgets, you don’t
need long to get the hang of it. It’ll be one of your many new low-carb best
friends (besides me, of course). See Chapter 16 for some great low-carb slow
cookin’ recipes.
Get Out the Grill
I can’t cook without my outdoor gas grill, and I love my tabletop inside grill.
Both grills make low-carb cooking so easy and quick, and they cut fat
because it just drips away. Outdoor grilling makes everything taste better,
and there isn’t much that you can’t throw on the grill — steaks, chops,
chicken, fish, shellfish, veggies, and even some fruits for desserts. (For some
pretty awesome grilling suggestions, scoot on over to Chapters 11, 17, and
20.) I bet you already have an outdoor grill, but you may want to consider
investing in an inside tabletop grill too. These grills are fairly inexpensive,
and you don’t have to buy one of the fancy schmancy brand-name ones.
Grillin’ is great and very compatible with your low-carb lifestyle.

Chapter 21: Ten Easy Ways to Simplify Your Low-Carb Cooking

Organize Your Low-Carb Recipes
In addition to keeping Healthy Carb Cookbook For Dummies handy in your
kitchen, I know you have other sources for low-carb recipes. Because variety
is one of the major keys to success in your low-carb healthy lifestyle, con-
sider organizing not only your lifestyle but your recipes too. If you can, desig-
nate a shelf just for low-carb books. If you have loose recipes printed on
81⁄2-x-11-inch paper, three-hole punch them and put them in a binder. This
organization doesn’t have to be fancy. Grab some binder dividers and orga-
nize your recipes by category. If you cut recipes out of a magazine, tape them
on a piece of 81⁄2-x-11-inch paper so your recipe pages are uniform. If you want
to be fancy, color-code your sections with different colored paper. You may
want to start two notebooks — one for recipes you’ve tried and are definitely
keepers and another one for new recipes you want to try. You’ll no longer
look all over the place for that recipe when it’s time to get cookin’!
Eyeball Portion Control
Measuring food amounts has never been something that I’ve been interested
in doing — in the literal sense of getting out a measuring cup. But you and I
both know that if you don’t measure somehow, it’s easy to super-size your
portions, which isn’t going to get you where you want to be with your low-
carb lifestyle. With just a little practice, you can eyeball portion sizes in com-
parison to things such as the palm of your hand, baseballs, tennis balls, and
other familiar items. Here’s a list to get you well on your way to making por-
tion decisions:
 2 ounces cheese = a pair of dominoes
 1 teaspoon butter = tip of your thumb, or 1 dice
 3 ounces fish, meat, or poultry = the size of a computer mouse
 1 tablespoon oil = tip of your thumb to the first joint
 1⁄2 cup veggies or fruit = half of a tennis ball
 1 cup of veggies or greens = your fist
 1 medium piece of fruit = a baseball
 1 tablespoon salad dressing = half of a golf ball

E
at more and weigh less. No, I’m not kidding. You really can eat more and
lose weight, but not without making trade-offs and choices. When you’re
walking the line of a low-carb life, you know that controlling your carbs is just
part of the equation. Watching those calories is important, too, and don’t
forget being on the lookout for bad fats. So, with a little tweak here and there,
you can eat more food and take in fewer carbs and calories, lowering your
bad fat intake. And with a smidgen of movement every day — voilà! You’re a
happier (and slimmer) camper!
In this chapter, I look at some foods that are squarely on the low-carb cham-
pions list — plus they can help you burn calories. How, you ask? Well, they
have low carb counts and high fiber counts — a one-two punch that puts
them low on the glycemic index. And, as you know if you’ve read Chapter 2,
foods low on the glycemic index satisfy your hunger longer, control cravings
a little better, and keep you out of the peaks and valleys of blood sugar
spikes. Eating good carbs more often and not letting yourself get really
hungry are secrets to this amazing healthy lifestyle (see Chapter 2 on good
grazing habits). Many of the foods listed in this chapter can be between-real-
meal snacks as well as part of great low-carb meals. Happy grazing!
Broccoli
I hope you like broccoli because it sure likes you and your low-carb, healthy
lifestyle. Broccoli is considered a “super food” because it’s full of nutrients
and packed with fiber. Just 1⁄2 cup broccoli contains almost a whole day’s
worth of vitamin C. The green veggie also fires your metabolic furnace, help-
ing your body burn calories (fat).

Eat raw broccoli for snacks — either on its own or with a bit of dip to spice
things up. (Just don’t go too heavy on the dip, or you’ll cancel out all the
good stuff you’re getting.) And steamed broccoli isn’t the only way to prepare
this great veggie. Flip through your favorite cookbooks or jump online to
explore your options with new broccoli recipes.
Bell Peppers
You can dress bell peppers up and take them anywhere! They can be a snack,
an appetizer, an entree (Chapter 12 has a great recipe for stuffed peppers), an
ingredient in a wrap, or a side dish, and they’re packed with vitamin C and a
high concentration of key antioxidants. You can’t lose with the bright rain-
bow of red, yellow, orange, and green bell peppers. (The red and yellow vari-
eties are especially sweet.) Cut peppers into crispy strips and carry them
with you for quick and refreshing snacks with some of your favorite low-carb
dip (dip away in Chapter 14). Just seeing this rainbow of colors will brighten
up your mood!
Dark, Leafy Greens
Thinking green gets you far on the yellow brick road of a low-carb, healthy
lifestyle. You’ll be knocking on the door of wellness before Dorothy can even
click her ruby red slippers together. The antioxidants in the dark, leafy
greens are off the charts and help prevent chronic disease.
When it comes to leafy greens, your choices are vast and varied, from
spinach to lettuces and salad greens with a bunch more green bunches in
between. There’s more to your leafy green low-carb life than just another
boring salad or side dish. You can spice things up with sauces, herbs, and
spices and take the green stuff from ho-hum to yum-yum! For example, head
to Chapter 8 for a Stir-Fried Lettuce recipe. (For more on the benefits of green
leafy stuff, flip to Chapter 8).
Cabbage, Cauliflower, and 
Other Cruciferous Veggies
In addition to broccoli, cruciferous vegetables include cabbages, cauliflower,
turnips, and radishes. Whether you eat a variety of these veggies raw, cooked
with an entree, or as a main meal, you’ve got a win/win situation. Their pro-
tective health benefits are impressive, and they have the low-carb counts and
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

high fiber counts that are so important to your low-carb lifestyle. So graze as
often as you wish with these guys. (Veg out on veggies in Chapter 12 for lots
of great info plus recipes to tease your palate!)
Nuts and Seeds
Almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds . . . the list goes on and
on. You’ve probably heard that eating a few nuts a day will help you lose
more weight. The keyword here is few — that means not a whole bag. Nuts
and seeds are good sources of vitamin E and essential fatty acids. Their pro-
tein and fat contents make them satisfying craving controllers and between-
meal snacks. Get in the habit of carrying a little snack-sized bag around with
you for the times when you get that pesky growl in your tummy. For more
nutty info, see Chapter 14.
Sliced Turkey Breast
Keep slices of turkey breast in your fridge for snacks. You’ll find it very satis-
fying for grazing and very kind to your carb counts. If you’re in a hurry for
some sustenance, plain slices are great on their own. If you have a bit more
time, you can roll it around a cold piece of asparagus to get protein and a veg-
etable in one handy nibble. Or spread a little cream cheese on a slice of
turkey, sprinkle some fresh chives across the top, and then roll it up for
another tasty snack.
Fish
Fish, for the most part, is perfect for your low-carb lifestyle. Make the choice
to broil, grill, poach, or bake your fish, and you’re home free. Some oily
fishes, such as salmon, herring, and sardines, provide healthy omega-3 fatty
acids. Omega-3s aid in cholesterol reduction and the prevention of cardiovas-
cular disease and high blood pressure. Visit your fresh fish counter often.
Remember: Eat more fish — lose more weight.
When it comes to fish, the only thing you really have to watch out for is the
preparation. Obviously, battered and deep-fried are no-nos.

Chapter 22: Ten Foods to Eat More Of

Blackberries
Blackberries are highly recommended for almost any low-carb lifestyle. Why
are such little fruits so important? Well, they’re low on the glycemic index
and don’t make your insulin spike. Add to that the fact that 1⁄2 cup of blackber-
ries contains lots of vitamin C and a little over 3 grams of fiber that knocks
the net carb count down to about 6 grams. So go ahead and stir a few fresh
blackberries into some Greek yogurt (which has low carb counts) for a real
low-carb treat.
Tea
If you’re feeling hungry or raving for a craving of some sort, try a cup of hot
tea. It should take away your craving. And even better than the quick craving
fix, that little cup of tea is loaded with antioxidant properties (even more if
it’s green tea). Tea also speaks a discouraging word to blood clots and helps
reduce fat levels in the blood. Relax for a few minutes and make any time
teatime.
Black Soybeans
Black soybeans are one of the best-kept secrets in the universe. These little 
rascals not only taste great and work wonderfully in recipes that call for some
kind of beans, but they’re also good for you and your healthy low-carb lifestyle.
I use them in chili, soups, stews, and some bean salads, and they make great
black bean dip. One cup of these little jewels contains 16 grams of carbs and
14 grams of fiber for a net carb count of only 2 grams! (See Chapter 15 for a
great recipe using black soybeans.)

Ten Carb-Counting Web Sites
In This Chapter
 Discovering free low-carb info on the Web
 Glimpsing at the glycemic index and glycemic loads
 Moving more with pedometer stepping
 Digesting online nutritional data
I
n this chapter, I list ten of my favorite informational Web sites that I know
to be reliable. In living a low-carb, healthy, and active lifestyle, knowledge
is golden. Learning as much as you can about nutrition, carb control, and
caloric intake and output will make you not only a happier person but a
healthier person, too. These Web sites give you the opportunity to build your
bank of good carb knowledge. I bet you’ll discover some things you didn’t
know about nutrition and the low-carb world. Most importantly, have fun
with this!
In navigating the Internet for information, please keep in mind that just as
you’re in charge of your low-carb lifestyle and what goes in your body, you’re
also in charge of what goes in your head. It’s okay to be skeptical, because
some folks posting information online are less than ethical and less than
knowledgeable. At the other end of the spectrum, absolutely incredible and
credible information is literally at your fingertips to help you and support
you with your low-carb healthy lifestyle. So get online and be smart!
CarbSmart
CarbSmart (www.carbsmart.com) is a retailer of over 1,300 products for
people living the low-carb lifestyle. CarbSmart serves both the United States
and Canada and is dedicated to helping everyone currently following or con-
sidering a low-carb lifestyle. Not only is CarbSmart the shopping source for

products supporting low-carb lifestyles, but it also offers a free online maga-
zine. CarbSmart Magazine contains over 400 articles of interest to the new or
experienced low-carber. I’ve known the owner of CarbSmart, Andrew DiMino,
personally every since I started writing low-carb cookbooks. Andrew is a
jewel, and you’re sure to be treated well at CarbSmart. No matter which low-
carb lifestyle you follow, check out this site for great information and prod-
ucts and be sure to sign up for the free online magazine.
Fabulous Foods
Fabulous Foods (www.fabulousfoods.com) is an enormous general food and
cooking Web site that offers a large array of low-carb articles and recipes
(many with full color photos), as well as a free biweekly low-carb e-zine. If
you’re looking for an active message board community, you’ll find that at
Fabulous Foods, too; trading tips and recipes with other low-carbers is fun,
as is offering each other support in your low-carb lifestyle. Editor Cheri
Sicard, who coincidentally co-wrote U.S. Citizenship For Dummies (published
by Wiley), told me that low-carbers make up the site’s largest niche audience.
She started the low-carb e-zine about six years ago when she began a low-
carb diet and couldn’t find enough interesting recipes. “In those days, low-
carb products and information were scarce, outside of the Atkins books,”
Cheri said. “I started to post the recipes on the site that I was using to lose
weight. We never expected it to take off the way it did.”
The enthusiastic low-carb audience inspires the folks at Fabulous Foods to
continually add new low-carb recipes and content to the site, so check back
often or sign up for the free low-carb e-zine and get great low-carb content
delivered to your e-mail inbox. I’ve been getting Cheri’s newsletter for several
years now, and I’m always excited to see what’s new!
Low Carb Luxury
Low Carb Luxury (www.lowcarbluxury.com) doesn’t manufacture or sell
low-carb products; rather, it’s the consumer voice of the low-carb, sugar-free,
and specialty food industry. The company emphasizes the science, health,
well-being, longevity, and strength of those living the low-carb, healthy
lifestyle. This Web site has tons of useful free information, with a great guide
for low-carb beginners. Even if you’ve been low-carbing for a while, you’ll
probably find some new nugget of information here. Be sure to sign up for the
free online magazine while you’re browsing the site. Low Carb Luxury is
exceptionally well designed and easy to navigate.

to you, I’ll reveal that Sassy Stepper is my creation, and this is my Web site. In
my ten-plus years as a low-carber, I’ve learned the hard way that what you eat
isn’t the whole picture to a successful low-carb lifestyle. You gotta move
more, and pedometer stepping works for me. I think most of us take life way
too seriously, especially when it comes to weight. So I created Sassy to try to
lighten things up a bit and, with grins and giggles, get low-carbers all over the
world to become Sassy Steppers and have fun losing weight, moving more,
and being healthier than ever. So come join Sassy Stepper and me online and
let’s have some fun and share some grins as well as some serious business
about moving more with a pedometer in our healthy and active low-carb
lifestyle. (For more about pedometer walking, see Chapter 5.)
Mendosa.com’s Glycemic Index and
Glycemic Load Values
At www.mendosa.com, you find a directory of articles, columns, and informa-
tive links compiled by Rick Mendosa, a freelance journalist specializing in dia-
betes. There’s great free information on this site with tons of links to other
informational sites — it’s a wealth of good information relating to your low-
carb lifestyle as well as encouragement for you to keep up the good work!
The big low-carb payoff on Rick’s page is the information available at
www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm. This portion of the Web site has what I
think to be the most comprehensive and most complete glycemic index and
glycemic load lists currently on the Web. Don’t miss it. This list will help you
make good food choices for your low-carb, healthy lifestyle. For more infor-
mation on the glycemic index and glycemic load, see Chapter 2.
USDA National Nutrient Database
The Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) (www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp)
and its predecessor organizations in the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) have been compiling and developing food composition databases for
over a century. The major focus of NDL is to maintain the USDA National
Nutrient Database, a repository of information for 100 nutrients and over
7,300 foods.

such a bad thing. . . .
Food and Nutrition Information Center
The Food and Nutrition Information Center (FNIC) (www.nal.usda.gov/fnic)
is a leader in online global nutrition information. This site gives you calorie
counts and levels of calcium, folate, saturated fats, and other nutrients for
some 10,000 brand-name foods. One of my favorite parts of the FNIC site is the
Consumer’s Corner that offers recipes and information about food and nutri-
tion topics in the news. 
Carbs Information
This Web site (www.carbs-information.com) is a gem, and I discovered it
quite by accident and am delighted to be able to share it with you. You can
find answers to hundreds of questions about carbs and diet nutrition and all
kinds of useful links. For starters, the site answers questions and provides
information about carbohydrates, dietary fiber, glycemic issues, low-carb
diets and how they stack up, low-carb products, and net carbs. The site is
easy to navigate, and I think it’ll be helpful in answering some question that
may pop up for you on the low-carb lifestyle road. Enjoy poking around and
seeing what you come up with — I did!
