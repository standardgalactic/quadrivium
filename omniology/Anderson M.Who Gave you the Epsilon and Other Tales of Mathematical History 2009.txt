Introduction
For over one hundred years, the Mathematical Association of America has been publishing high- 
quality articles on the history of mathematics, some written by distinguished historians and math­
ematicians such as J. L. Coolidge, B. L. van der Waerden, Hermann Weyl and G. H. Hardy. Many 
well-known historians of the present day also contribute to the MAA’s journals, such as Ivor Grattan- 
Guinness, Judith Grabiner, Israel Kleiner and Karen Parshall.
Some years ago, we decided that it would be useful to reprint a selection of these papers and to 
set them in the context of modern historical research, so that current mathematicians can continue 
to enjoy them and so that newer articles can be easily compared with older ones. The result was our 
MAA volume Sherlock Holmes in Babylon, which took the story from earliest times up to the time 
of Euler in the eighteenth century. The current volume is a sequel to our earlier one, and continues 
with topics from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We hope that you will enjoy this second 
collection.
A careful reading of some of the older papers shows that although modern research has introduced 
some new information or has fostered some new interpretations, in large measure they are neither 
dated or obsolete. Nevertheless, we have sometimes decided to include two or more papers on a 
single topic, written years apart, to show the progress in the history of mathematics.
We wish to thank Don Albers, Director of Publications at the MAA, and Gerald Alexanderson, 
former chair of the publications committee of the MAA, for their support for the history of math­
ematics at the MAA in general, and for this project in particular. We also want to thank Beverly 
Ruedi for her technical expertise in preparing this volume for publication.

Foreword
In this chapter, we look at some critical ideas in the history of analysis in the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries and also consider some of the people involved in their creation.
Certainly, the most important idea in the rigorous study of calculus is the idea of a limit. Although 
Newton and Leibniz both understood this idea heuristically and used it in their discussions of 
fluxions and differentials, respectively, it was not until the nineteenth century that our modern 
treatment in terms of epsilons and deltas was created, mostly by Augustin-Louis Cauchy. Judy 
Grabiner explores this creation in her article, showing how Cauchy took the ideas of approximation 
worked out by d’Alembert, Lagrange, and others in the eighteenth century and turned them into the 
foundations of the rigorous definitions of the central concepts of calculus, including limit, continuity, 
and convergence.
Today, functions are the basic objects studied in calculus, although they were not so for Newton 
and Leibniz. Israel Kleiner surveys the history of this concept, showing how some of the vague ideas 
of the creators of calculus were turned into precise definitions by Euler and others. He continues by 
discussing how the notion of function developed under the influence of the development of Fourier 
series and then was further affected by the invention of various pathological functions in the second 
half of the nineteenth century. Kleiner concludes with a treatment of the various extensions of the 
notion of function in the twentieth century, including L2 functions and distributions.
The set of L2 functions was one of the first examples of a Hilbert space. Lynn Steen discusses the 
history of this concept, concentrating on the notion of the spectrum of a linear operator. Beginning 
with the development of the principal axis theorem in two and three dimensions in connection with 
quadratic forms, Steen follows the thread of “diagonalization” through such concepts as infinite 
systems of linear equations and the theory of integral equations into the work of Hilbert himself. 
He then continues with the work of numerous mathematicians in the twentieth century, showing 
in particular how spectral theory became central to the development of quantum mechanics in the 
1920s.
Three articles in this chapter deal with potential theory, whose mathematical foundations begin 
with George Green’s essay on electricity and magnetism of 1828. Ivor Grattan-Guinness looks at 
the circumstances surrounding the writing of Green’s essay, discussing his motivation, his sources, 
and the influence the essay had. Thomas Archibald looks at the history of one particular result 
from this essay, now called Green’s second identity, and traces its importance in Riemann’s and 
later Thomson’s conceptions of multiple-connectivity, in Helmholtz’s work in fluid dynamics, and 
in Tait’s reworking of the results through the use of quaternions. Finally, Katz looks at the history of 
the various results that were unified in the twentieth century into what is now called the generalized 
3

Analysis
Stokes’s theorem. These include the three theorems that are studied in any multi-variable calculus 
course: Green’s theorem, the divergence theorem, and the original Stokes’s theorem.
Each of the other articles in this chapter each deal specifically with the work of a particular 
mathematician who contributed greatly to analysis in the nineteenth and twentieth century. Karen 
Rappaport gives us details on the life and work of Sonya Kovalevsky, from studying calculus from 
the wallpaper in her nursery to her important work in partial differential equations and the motion of 
rigid bodies. S. L. Zabell looks at some relatively unknown work by Alan Turing on the central limit 
theorem, accomplished before his crucial work on the decision problem convinced him to work on 
problems in logic and led ultimately to his accomplishments at Bletchley Park during the Second 
World War. Shawnee McMurran and James Tattersall look at the mathematical work of Dame Mary 
Cartwright, particularly her collaborative work with James Littlewood dealing with the solution of 
the van der Pol differential equation.
Finally, Nkechi Agwu, Luell Smith, and Aissatou Barry present the biography of David Blackwell, 
the first prominent African-American mathematician, best known for his work in statistics. The 
authors show how he overcame the prejudices of his time not only to achieve a Ph.D. in mathematics 
but also to become a full professor of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley and later 
Chair of the department.

Who Gave You the Epsilon? Cauchy and the 
Origins of Rigorous Calculus
JUDITH V. GRABINER
American Mathematical Monthly 90 (1983), 185-194
Student: The car has a speed of 50 miles an hour. 
What does that mean?
Teacher: Given any £ > (0, there exists a 6 such 
that if \t2 - tl | <6, then | S2-S1— 501 < £.
Student: How in the world did anybody ever 
think of such an answer?
Perhaps this exchange will remind us that the rigorous 
basis for the calculus is not at all intuitive—in fact, 
quite the contrary. The calculus is a subject dealing 
with speeds and distances, with tangents and areas— 
not inequalities. When Newton and Leibniz invented 
the calculus in the late seventeenth century, they did 
not use delta-epsilon proofs. It took a hundred and 
fifty years to develop them. This means that it was 
probably very hard, and it is no wonder that a modern 
student finds the rigorous basis of the calculus diffi­
cult. How, then, did the calculus get a rigorous basis 
in terms of the algebra of inequalities?
Delta-epsilon proofs are first found in the works 
of Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1867). This is not 
always recognized, since Cauchy gave a purely ver­
bal definition of limit, which at first glance does not 
resemble modern definitions ([6], p. 19):
When the successively attributed values of the 
same variable indefinitely approach a fixed 
value, so that finally they differ from it by as 
little as desired, the last is called the limit of all 
the others.
Cauchy also gave a purely verbal definition of the 
derivative of f(x) as the limit, when it exists, of the 
quotient of differences (f(x + h) - f (x))/h when h 
goes to zero, a statement much like those that had 
already been made by Newton, Leibniz, d’Alembert, 
Maclaurin, and Euler. But what is significant is that 
Cauchy translated such verbal statements into the pre­
cise language of inequalities when he needed them in 
his proofs. For instance, for the derivative Cauchy 
([8], p. 44) makes the following statement:
Let 6, £ be two very small numbers; the first is 
chosen so that for all numerical [i.e., absolute] 
values of h less than 6, and for any value of x 
(*)
included [in the interval of definition], the ra­
tio (f (x + h) - f (x))/h will always be greater 
than f' (x) - £ and less than f' (x) + £.
This one example will be enough to indicate how 
Cauchy did the calculus, because the question to be 
answered in the present paper is not, “how is a rig­
orous delta-epsilon proof constructed?” As Cauchy’s 
intellectual heirs we all know this. The central ques­
tion is, how and why was Cauchy able to put the 
calculus on a rigorous basis, when his predecessors 
were not?
The answers to this historical question cannot be 
found by reflecting on the logical relations between 
the concepts, but by looking in detail at the past and 
seeing how the existing state of affairs in fact de­
veloped from that past. Thus we will examine the 
mathematical situation in the seventeenth and eigh­
teenth centuries — the background against which we 
can appreciate Cauchy’s innovation. We will describe 
the powerful techniques of the calculus of this ear­
lier period and the relatively unimpressive views put 
forth to justify them. We will then discuss how a 
sense of urgency about rigorizing analysis gradually 
developed in the eighteenth century. Most important, 
we will explain the development of the mathemati­
cal techniques necessary for the new rigor from the 
5

Analysis
work of men like Euler, d’Alembert, Poisson, and es­
pecially Lagrange. Finally, we will show how these 
mathematical results, though often developed for pur­
poses far removed from establishing foundations for 
the calculus, were used by Cauchy in constructing his 
new rigorous analysis.
The practice of analysis: from 
Newton to Euler
In the late seventeenth century, Newton and Leib­
niz, almost simultaneously, independently invented 
the calculus. This invention involved three things. 
First, they invented the general concepts of differen­
tial quotient and integral (these are Leibniz’s terms; 
Newton called the concepts “fluxion” and “fluent”). 
Second, they devised a notation for these concepts 
which made the calculus an algorithm: the methods 
not only worked, but were easy to use. Their nota­
tions had great heuristic power, and we still use Leib­
niz’s dy/dx and J ydx, and Newton’s X, today Third, 
both men realized that the basic processes of finding 
tangents and areas, that is, differentiating and inte­
grating, are mutually inverse—what we now call the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Once the calculus had been invented, mathemati­
cians possessed an extremely powerful set of methods 
for solving problems in geometry, in physics, and in 
pure analysis. But what was the nature of the basic 
concepts? For Leibniz, the differential quotient was 
a ratio of infinitesimal differences, and the integral 
was a sum of infinitesimals. For Newton, the deriva­
tive, or fluxion, was described as a rate of change; the 
integral, or fluent, was its inverse. In fact, through­
out the eighteenth century, the integral was gener­
ally thought of as the inverse of the differential. One 
might imagine asking Leibniz exactly what an in­
finitesimal was, or Newton what a rate of change 
might be. Newton’s answer, the best of the eighteenth 
century, is instructive. Consider a ratio of finite quan­
tities (in modern notation, (f(x + h) - f (x))/h as 
h goes to zero). The ratio eventually becomes what 
Newton called an “ultimate ratio”. Ultimate ratios are 
([26], p. 39)
limits to which the ratios of quantities decreasing 
without limit do always converge, and to which 
they approach nearer than by any given differ­
ence, but never go beyond, nor ever reach until 
the quantities vanish.
Except for “reaching” the limit when the quantities 
vanish, we can translate Newton’s words into our al­
gebraic language. Newton himself, however, did not 
do this, nor did most of his followers in the eigh­
teenth century. Moreover, “never go beyond” does 
not allow a variable to oscillate about its limit. Thus, 
though Newton’s is an intuitively pleasing picture, as 
it stands it was not and could not be used for proofs 
about limits. The definition sounds good, but it was 
not understood or applied in algebraic terms.
But most eighteenth-century mathematicians 
would object, “Why worry about foundations?” In 
the eighteenth century, the calculus, intuitively under­
stood and algorithmically executed, was applied to a 
wide range of problems. For instance, the partial dif­
ferential equation for vibrating strings was solved; the 
equations of motion for the solar system were solved; 
the Laplace transform and the calculus of variations 
and the gamma function were invented and applied; 
all of mechanics was worked out in the language of the 
calculus. These were great achievements on the part 
of eighteenth-century mathematicians. Who would be 
greatly concerned about foundations when such im­
portant problems could be successfully treated by the 
calculus? Results were what counted.
This point will be better appreciated by looking 
at an example which illustrates both the “uncritical” 
approach to concepts of the eighteenth century and 
the immense power of eighteenth-century techniques, 
from the work of the great master of such techniques: 
Leonhard Euler. The problem is to find the sum of the 
series
1 + 1 + 1 + ■" + '1 + ■" •

It clearly has a finite sum since it is bounded above 
by the series
111 
1
2 
3 + F4 + •" +(k - 1) • k + •" ’
whose sum was known to be 2; Johann Bernoulli had 
found this sum by treating
111
1 + T~2 + 2“3 + 3“4 + •"
as the difference between the series 1 I 1 I 1 I • • • 
123
and the series 2 + 3 + 1 + • • •, and observing that 
this difference telescopes ([2], IV, 8; cited in [28], 
p. 321).
Euler’s summation of 1/k2 makes use of a 
lemma from the theory of equations: given a poly­
nomial equation whose constant term is 1, the coeffi­
cient of the linear term is the sum of the reciprocals

of the roots with the signs changed. This result was 
both discovered and demonstrated by considering the 
equation (x - a)(x - b)=0, having roots a and b. 
Multiplying and then dividing out ab, we obtain
- (a + b) x+1 = 0;
the result is now obvious, as is the extension to equa­
tions of higher degree.
Euler’s solution then considers the equation 
sin x =0. Expanding this as

Finally, substituting x2 = u produces

But Euler thought that power series could be manip­
ulated just like polynomials. Thus, we now have a 
polynomial equation in -, whose constant term is 1. 
Applying the lemma to it, the coefficient of the linear 
term with the sign changed is 1/3! = 1/6. The roots 
of the equation in - are the roots ofsinx =0withthe 
substitution u = x2, namely n2,4n2, 9n2,... . Thus 
the lemma implies
1 = n12 + 4n2 + 9n2+•
Multiplying by n2 yields the sum of the original series

Though it is easy to criticize eighteenth-century 
arguments like this for their lack of rigor, it is also 
unfair. Foundations, precise specifications of the con­
ditions under which such manipulations with infini­
ties or infinitesimals were admissible, were not very 
important to men like Euler, because without such 
specifications they made important new discoveries, 
whose results in cases like this could readily be veri­
fied. When the foundations of the calculus were dis­
cussed in the eighteenth century, they were treated 
as secondary. Discussions of foundations appeared 
in the introductions to books, in popularizations, and 
in philosophical writings, and were not—as they are 
now and have been since Cauchy’s time—the subject 
of articles in research-oriented journals.
Thus, where we once had one question to answer, 
we now have two. The first remains, where do 
Cauchy’s rigorous techniques come from? Second, 
one must now ask, why rigorize the calculus in the first 
place? If few mathematicians were very interested 
in foundations in the eighteenth century ([16], Chap­
ter 6), then when, and why, were attitudes changed?
Of course, to establish rigor, it is necessary— 
though not sufficient—to think rigor is significant. 
But more important, to establish rigor, itis necessary 
(though also not sufficient) to have a set of techniques 
in existence which are suitable for that purpose. In 
particular, if the calculus is to be made rigorous by 
being reduced to the algebra of inequalities, one must 
have both the algebra of inequalities, and facts about 
the concepts of the calculus that can be expressed in 
terms of the algebra of inequalities.
In the early nineteenth century, three conditions 
held for the first time: Rigor was considered impor­
tant; there was a well-developed algebra of inequal­
ities; and, certain properties were known about the 
basic concepts of analysis—limits, convergence, 
continuity, derivatives, integrals—properties which 
could be expressed in the language of inequalities 
if desired. Cauchy, followed by Riemann and 
Weierstrass, gave the calculus a rigorous basis, using 
the already-existing algebra of inequalities, and built 
a logically-connected structure of theorems about the 
concepts of the calculus. Itis our task to explain how 
these three conditions—the developed algebra of 
inequalities, the importance of rigor, the appropriate 
properties of the concepts of the calculus—came 
to be.
The algebra of inequalities
Today, the algebra of inequalities is studied in calculus 
courses because of its use as a basis for the calculus, 
but why should it have been studied in the eighteenth 
century when this application was unknown? In the 
eighteenth century, inequalities were important in the 
study ofa major class of results: approximations.
For example, consider the equation (x + 1)'" = a, 
for ^ not an integer. Usually a cannot be found ex­
actly, but it can be approximated by an infinite series. 
In general, given some number n of terms of such 
an approximating series, eighteenth-century mathe­
maticians sought to compute an upper bound on the 
error in the approximation—that is, the difference be­
tween the sum of the series and the nth partial sum.

8
Analysis
This computation was a problem in the algebra of 
inequalities. Jean d’Alembert [10] solved it for the 
important case of the binomial series; given the num­
ber of terms of the series n, and assuming implicitly 
that the series converges to its sum, he could find 
the bounds on the error—that is, on the remainder 
of the series after the nth term—by bounding the 
series above and below with convergent geometric 
progressions. Similarly, Joseph-Louis Lagrange [24] 
invented a new approximation method using contin­
ued fractions and, by extremely intricate inequality 
calculations, gave necessary and sufficient conditions 
for a given iteration of the approximation to be closer 
to the result than the previous iteration. Lagrange also 
derived the Lagrange remainder of the Taylor series 
[23], using an inequality which bounded the remain­
der above and below by the maximum and minimum 
values of the nth derivative and then applying the 
intermediate-value theorem for continuous functions. 
Thus, through such eighteenth-century work ([16], 
pp. 56-68; [14], Chapters 2-4), there was by the end 
of the eighteenth century a developed algebra of in­
equalities, and people used to working with it. Given 
an n, these people are used to finding an error—that 
is, an epsilon.
Changing attitudes toward rigor
Mathematicians were much more interested in find­
ing rigorous foundations for the calculus in 1800 than 
they had been a hundred years before. There are many 
reasons for this: no one enough by itself, but appar­
ently sufficient when acting together. Of course one 
might think that eighteenth-century mathematicians 
were always making errors because of the lack of an 
explicitly-formulated rigorous foundation. But this 
did not occur. They were usually right, and for two 
reasons. One is that if one deals with real variables, 
functions of one variable, series which are power se­
ries, and functions arising from physical problems, 
errors will not occur too often. A second reason is that 
mathematicians like Euler and Laplace had a deep in­
sight into the basic properties of the concepts of the 
calculus, and were able to choose fruitful methods 
and evade pitfalls. The only “error” they committed 
was to use methods that shocked mathematicians of 
later ages who had grown up with the rigor of the 
nineteenth century.
What then were the reasons for the deepened in­
terest in rigor? One set of reasons was philosophi­
cal. In 1734, the British philosopher Bishop Berkeley 
([1], Section 35) had attacked the calculus on the 
ground that it was not rigorous. In The Analyst, or 
a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician, 
he said that mathematicians had no business attack­
ing the unreasonableness of religion, given the way 
they themselves reasoned. He ridiculed fluxions— 
“velocities of evanescent increments”—calling the 
evanescent increments “ghosts of departed quanti­
ties”. Even more to the point, he correctly criticized 
a number of specific arguments from the writings of 
his mathematical contemporaries. For instance, he at­
tacked the process of finding the fluxion (our deriva­
tive) by reviewing the steps of the process: if we 
consider y = x2 , taking the ratio of the differences 
((x + h)2 - x2 )/h, then simplifying to 2x + h, then 
letting h vanish, we obtain 2x.Butish zero? If it 
is, we cannot meaningfully divide by it; if it is not 
zero, we have no right to throw it away. As Berkeley 
put it ([1], Section 15), the quantity we have called 
h “might have signified either an increment or noth­
ing. But then, which of these soever you make it sig­
nify, you must argue consistently with such its signifi­
cation”.
Since an adequate response to Berkeley’s objec­
tions would have involved recognizing that an equa­
tion involving limits is a shorthand expression for 
a sequence of inequalities—a subtle and difficult 
idea—no eighteenth-century analyst gave a fully ad­
equate answer to Berkeley. However, many tried. 
Maclaurin, d’Alembert, Lagrange, Lazare Carnot, 
and possibly Euler, all knew about Berkeley’s work, 
and all wrote something about foundations. So Berke­
ley did call attention to the question. However, except 
for Maclaurin, no leading mathematician spent much 
time on the question because of Berkeley’s work, and 
even Maclaurin’s influence lay in other fields.
Another factor contributing to the new interest in 
rigor was that there was a limit to the number of 
results that could be reached by eighteenth-century 
methods. Near the end of the century, some leading 
mathematicians had begun to feel that this limit was at 
hand. D’Alembert and Lagrange indicate this in their 
correspondence, with Lagrange calling higher mathe­
matics “decadent” ([2], Vol. 13, p. 229). The philoso­
pher Diderot went so far as to claim that the mathe­
maticians of the eighteenth century had “erected the 
pillars of Hercules” beyond which it was impossi­
ble to go ([11], pp. 180-181). Thus, there was a 
perceived need to consolidate the gains of the past 
century.
Another factor was Lagrange, who became in­
creasingly interested in foundations, and, through 
his activities, interested other mathematicians. In

the eighteenth century, scientific academies offered 
prizes for solving major outstanding problems. In 
1784, Lagrange and his colleagues posed the prob­
lem of the foundations of the calculus as the Berlin 
Academy’s prize problem. Nobody solved it to La­
grange’s satisfaction, but two of the entries in the 
competition were later expanded into full-length 
books, the first on the Continent, on foundations: Si­
mon L’Huilier’s Exposition Elementaire des Principes 
des Calculs Superieurs, Berlin, 1787, and Lazare 
Carnot’s Reflexions sur la Metaphysique du Calcul In­
finitesimal , Paris, 1797. Thus Lagrange clearly helped 
revive interest in the problem.
Lagrange’s interest stemmed in part from his re­
spect for the power and generality of algebra; he 
wanted to gain for the calculus the certainty he be­
lieved algebra to possess. But there was another factor 
increasing interest in foundations, not only for La­
grange, but for many other mathematicians by the 
end of the eighteenth century: the need to teach. 
Teaching forces one’s attention to basic questions. 
Yet before the mid-eighteenth century, mathemati­
cians had often made their living by being attached 
to royal courts. But royal courts declined; the number 
of mathematicians increased; and mathematics be­
gan to look useful. First in military schools and later 
on at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, another line 
of work became available: teaching mathematics to 
students of science and engineering. The Ecole Poly­
technique was founded by the French revolutionary 
government to train scientists, who, the government 
believed, might prove useful to a modern state. And 
it was as a lecturer in analysis at the Ecole Polytech­
nique that Lagrange wrote his two major works on 
the calculus which treated foundations; similarly, it 
was 40 years earlier, teaching the calculus at the Mil­
itary Academy at Turin, that Lagrange had first set 
out to work on the problem of foundations. Because 
teaching forces one to ask basic questions about the 
nature of the most important concepts, the change in 
the economic circumstances of mathematicians—the 
need to teach—provided a catalyst for the crystal­
lization of the foundations of the calculus out of the 
historical and mathematical background. In fact, even 
well into the nineteenth century, much of foundations 
was born in the teaching situation: Weierstrass’s foun­
dations come from his lectures at Berlin; Dedekind 
first thought of the problem of continuity while teach­
ing at Zurich; Dini and Landau turned to foundations 
while teaching analysis; and, most important for our 
present purposes, so did Cauchy. Cauchy’s founda­
tions of analysis appear in the books based on his 
lectures at the Ecole Polytechnique; his book of 1821 
was the first example of the great French tradition of 
Cours d’Analyse.
The concepts of the calculus
Arising from algebra, the algebra of inequalities was 
now there for the calculus to be reduced to; the de­
sire to make the calculus rigorous had arisen through 
consolidation, through philosophy, through teaching, 
through Lagrange. Now let us turn to the mathemat­
ical substance of eighteenth-century analysis, to see 
what was known about the concepts of the calculus 
before Cauchy, and what he had to work out for him­
self, in order to define, and prove theorems about, 
limit, convergence, continuity, derivatives, and inte­
grals.
First, consider the concept of limit. As we have 
already pointed out, since Newton the limit had been 
thought of as a bound which could be approached 
closer and closer, though not surpassed. By 1800, 
with the work of L’Huilier and Lacroix on alternat­
ing series, the restriction that the limit be one-sided 
had been abandoned. Cauchy systematically trans­
lated this refined limit-concept into the algebra of 
inequalities, and used it in proofs once it had been 
so translated; thus he gave reality to the oft-repeated 
eighteenth-century statement that the calculus could 
be based on limits.
For example, consider the concept of convergence. 
Maclaurin had said already that the sum of a series 
was the limit of the partial sums. For Cauchy, this 
meant something precise. It meant that, given an £, 
one could find n such that, for more than n terms, the 
sum of the infinite series is within £ of the nth partial 
sum. That is the reverse of the error-estimating pro­
cedure that d’Alembert had used. From his definition 
of a series having a sum, Cauchy could prove that 
a geometric progression with radius less in absolute 
value than 1 converged to its usual sum. As we have 
said, d’Alembert had shown that the binomial series 
for, say, (1 + x)p/q could be bounded above and be­
low by convergent geometric progressions. Cauchy 
assumed that if a series of positive terms is bounded 
above, term-by-term, by a convergent geometric pro­
gression, then it converges; he then used such com­
parisons to prove a number of tests for convergence: 
the root test, the ratio test, the logarithm test. The 
treatment is quite elegant ([6], (2), Vol. 3, pp. 114­
138). Taking a technique used a few times by men 
like d’Alembert and Lagrange on an ad hoc basis in 
approximations, and using the definition of the sum 

10
Analysis
ofa series based on the limit concept, Cauchy created 
the first rigorous theory of convergence.
Let us now turn to the concept of continuity. 
Cauchy ([6], p. 43) gave essentially the modern defi­
nition of continuous function, saying that the function 
f(x) is continuous on a given interval if for each x 
in that interval “the numerical [i.e., absolute] value 
of the difference f(x + a) - f (x) decreases indef­
initely with a”. He used this definition in proving 
the intermediate-value theorem for continuous func­
tions ([6], pp. 378-380; English translation in [16], 
pp. 167-168). The proof proceeds by examining a 
function f (x) on an interval, say [b, c], where f (b) 
is negative, f (c) positive, and dividing the interval 
[b, c] into m parts of width h =(c - b)/m. Cauchy 
considered the sign of the function at the points
f(b),f(b+h),...,f(b+(m-1)h),f(c);
unless one of the values off is 0, there are two values 
of x differing by h such that f is negative at one, 
positive at the other. Repeating this process for new 
intervals of width
(c - b)/m, (c - b)/m2 ,..., 
gives an increasing sequence of values of x: 
b, b1 ,b2 ,... for which f is negative, and a decreas­
ing sequence of values of x: c, c1 ,c2,... for which 
f is positive, and such that the difference between 
bk and ck goes to 0. Cauchy asserted that these two 
sequences must have a common limit a. He then ar­
gued that since f(x) is continuous, the sequence of 
negative values f(bk) and of positive values f(ck) 
both converge toward the common limit f (a), which 
must therefore be 0.
Cauchy’s proof involves an already existing tech­
nique, which Lagrange had applied in approximating 
real roots of polynomial equations. If a polynomial 
was negative for one value of the variable, positive 
for another, there was a root in between, and the 
difference between those two values of the variable 
bounded the error made in taking either as an approx­
imation to the root ([20], p. 87; [21]). Thus again we 
have the algebra of inequalities providing a technique 
which Cauchy transformed from a tool of approxima­
tion to a tool of rigor.
It is worth remarking at this point that Cauchy, in 
his treatment both of convergence and of continuity, 
implicitly assumed various forms of the completeness 
property for the real numbers. For instance, he treated 
as obvious that a series of positive terms, bounded 
above by a convergent geometric progression, con­
verges: also, his proof of the intermediate-value the­
orem assumes that a bounded monotone sequence has 
a limit.
While Cauchy was the first systematically to ex­
ploit inequality proof techniques to prove theorems 
in analysis, he did not identify all the implicit as­
sumptions about the real numbers that such inequality 
techniques involve. Similarly, as the reader may have 
already noticed, Cauchy’s definition of continuous 
function does not distinguish between what we now 
call point-wise and uniform continuity; also, in treat­
ing series of functions, Cauchy did not distinguish 
between point-wise and uniform convergence. The 
verbal formulations like “for all” that are involved in 
choosing deltas did not distinguish between “for any 
epsilon and for all x” and “for any x, given any ep­
silon” (Grattan-Guinness [18] puts it well: “Uniform 
convergence was tucked away in the word “always,” 
with no reference to the variable at all.”). Nor was it 
at all clear in the 1820s how much depended on this 
distinction, since proofs about continuity and con­
vergence were in themselves so novel. We shall see 
the same confusion between uniform and point-wise 
convergence as we turn now to Cauchy’s theory of the 
derivative.
Again we begin with an approximation. Lagrange 
gave the following inequality about the derivative:
(**) 
f (x + h )= f (x) + hf'(x) + hV,
where V goes to 0 with h. He interpreted this to mean 
that, given any D, one can find h sufficiently small so 
that V is between -D and +D ([21], p. 87; [23], 
p. 77). Clearly this is equivalent to statement (*) 
above, Cauchy’s delta-epsilon characterization of the 
derivative. But how did Lagrange obtain this result? 
The answer is surprising; for Lagrange, formula (**) 
was a consequence of Taylor’s theorem. Lagrange be­
lieved that any function (that is, any analytic expres­
sion, whether finite or infinite, involving the variable) 
had a unique power-series expansion (except possibly 
at a finite number of isolated points). This is because 
he believed that there was an “algebra of infinite se­
ries”, an algebra exemplified by work of Euler such as 
the example we gave above. And Lagrange said that 
the way to make the calculus rigorous was to reduce it 
to algebra. Although there is no “algebra” of infinite 
series that gives power-series expansions without any 
consideration of convergence and limits, this assump­
tion led Lagrange to define f' (x) without reference 
to limits, as the coefficient of the linear term in h in 
the Taylor series expansion for f(x + h). Following 

GRABINER: Who Gave You the Epsilon? Cauchy and the Origins of Rigorous Calculus
11
Euler, Lagrange then said that, for any power series 
in h, one could take h sufficiently small so that any 
given term of the series exceeded the sum of all the 
rest of the terms following it; this approximation, said 
Lagrange, is assumed in applications of the calculus 
to geometry and mechanics ([23], p. 29; [21], p. 101; 
[12]). Applying this approximation to the linear term 
in the Taylor series produces (**), which I call the La­
grange property of the derivative. (Like Cauchy’s (*), 
the inequality-translation Lagrange gives for (**) as­
sumes that, given any D, one finds h sufficiently small 
so |^| < D with no mention whatever of x.)
Not only did Lagrange state property (**) and the 
associated inequalities, he used them as a basis for a 
number of proofs about derivatives: for instance, to 
prove that a function with positive derivative on an 
interval is increasing there, to prove the mean-value 
theorem for derivatives, and to obtain the Lagrange 
remainder for the Taylor series. (Details may be found 
in the works cited in [16] and [17].) Lagrange also 
applied his results to characterize the properties of 
maxima and minima, and orders of contact between 
curves.
With a few modifications, Lagrange’s proofs are 
valid—provided that property (**) can be justified. 
Cauchy borrowed and simplified what are in effect 
Lagrange’s inequality proofs about derivatives, with 
a few improvements, basing them on his own (*). But 
Cauchy made these proofs legitimate because Cauchy 
defined the derivative precisely to satisfy the rele­
vant inequalities. Once again, the key properties come 
from an approximation. For Lagrange, the derivative 
was exactly—no epsilons needed—the coefficient of 
the linear term in the Taylor series; formula (**), and 
the corresponding inequality that f(x + h) - f(x) 
lies between h(f'(x) ± D), were approximations. 
Cauchy ([16], Chapter 5 [17]) brought Lagrange’s 
inequality properties and proofs together with a defi­
nition of derivative devised to make those techniques 
rigorously founded.
The last of the concepts we shall consider, the in­
tegral, followed an analogous development. In the 
eighteenth century, the integral was usually thought 
of as the inverse of the differential. But sometimes the 
inverse could not be computed exactly, so men like 
Euler remarked that the integral could be approxi­
mated as closely as one liked by a sum. Of course, 
the geometric picture ofan area being approximated 
by rectangles, or the Leibnizian definition of the in­
tegral as a sum, suggests this immediately. But what 
is important for our purposes is that much work was 
done on approximating the values of definite integrals 
in the eighteenth century, including considerations of 
how small the subintervals used in the sums should be 
when the function oscillates to a greater or lesser ex­
tent. For instance, Euler [23] treated sums of the form
n
f(xk)(xk+1 - xk)
k=0
as approximations to the integral xxn f (x)dx.
In 1820, S.-D. Poisson, who was interested in com­
plex integration and therefore more concerned than 
most people about the existence and behavior of inte­
grals, asked the following question. If the integral F is 
defined as the anti-derivative of f, and if & - a = nh, 
can it be proved that F (b) - F (a)= ab f (x)dx is 
the limit of the sum
S = hf (a) + hf (a + h) + • • • + hf (a + (n — 1) h)
as h gets small? (S is an approximating sum of 
the eighteenth-century sort.) Poisson called this re­
sult “the fundamental proposition of the theory of 
definite integrals.” He proved it by using another 
inequality-result: the Taylor series with remainder. 
First, he wrote F (&) - F(a) as the telescoping sum
(***) F(a + h) - F(a)+F(a +2h) - F(a + h) 
+ •••+ F(&) - F(a +(n - 1)h).
Then, for each of the terms of the form
F(a + kh) - F(a +(k - 1)h),
Taylor’s series with remainder gives, since by defini­
tion F' = f,
F(a+ kh) - F(a+(k - 1)h) 
= hf(a+(k- 1)h)+ Rkh1+w,
where w>0,forsomeRk . Thus the telescoping sum 
(2) becomes
hf (a) + hf (a + h) + • • • + hf (a + (n — 1) h) 
+(R1 + ••• + Rn)h1+w .
So F(&) — F(a) and the sum S differ by (R1 + ••• 
+ Rn )h1+w . Letting R be the maximum value for 
the Rk ,
(R i + ••• + Rn) h 1 +w < n • R (h 1 +w)
= R • nh • hw = R(b — a) hw.
Therefore, if h is taken sufficiently small, F(&) — 
F(a) differs from S by less than any given quantity 
[27].
Poisson’s was the first attempt to prove the 
equivalence of the antiderivative and limit-of-sums 

12
Analysis
conceptions of the integral. However, besides the im­
plicit assumptions of the existence of antiderivatives 
and bounded first derivatives for f on the given inter­
val, the proof assumes that the subintervals on which 
the sum is taken are all equal. Should the result not 
hold for unequal divisions also? Poisson thought so, 
and justified it by saying ([27], pp. 329-330),
if the integral is represented by the area of a 
curve, this area will be the same, if we divide the 
difference . . . into an infinite number of equal 
parts, or an infinite number of unequal parts fol­
lowing any law.
This, however, is an assertion, not a proof. And 
Cauchy saw that a proof was needed.
Cauchy ([6], (2) Vol. 3, p. iii) did not like for­
malistic arguments in supposedly rigorous subjects, 
saying that most algebraic formulas hold “only un­
der certain conditions, and for certain values of the 
quantities they contain.” In particular, one could not 
assume that what worked for finite expressions au­
tomatically worked for infinite ones. Thus, Cauchy 
showed that the sum of the series 1 + 1 + 9 + • • • 
was n2 /6 by actually calculating the difference be­
tween the nth partial sum and n2 / 6 and showing that 
it was arbitrarily small ([6], (2) Vol. 3, pp. 456-457).
Similarly, just because there was an operation 
called taking a derivative did not mean that the in­
verse of that operation always produced a result. The 
existence of the definite integral had to be proved. And 
how does one prove existence in the 1820s? One con­
structs the mathematical object in question by using 
an eighteenth-century approximation that converges 
to it. Cauchy defined the integral as the limit of Euler- 
style sums £ f (xk)(xk+1 - xk) for xk+1 - xk suf­
ficiently small. Assuming explicitly that f(x) was 
continuous on the given interval (and implicitly that 
it was uniformly continuous), Cauchy was able to 
show that all sums of that form approach a fixed 
value, called by definition the integral of the function 
on that interval. This is an extremely hard proof ([5], 
pp. 122-125; [16], pp. 171-175 in English transla­
tion). Finally, borrowing from Lagrange the mean­
value theorem for integrals, Cauchy proved the Fun­
damental Theorem of Calculus ([5], pp. 151-152).
Conclusion
Here are all the pieces of the puzzle we origi­
nally set out to solve. Algebraic approximations pro­
duced the algebra of inequalities; eighteenth-century 
approximations in the calculus produced the useful 
proEpBeSrCtOiePsubolfisthhineg c:oneBcoeopk tCsololfecatnioanly(sEiBsS:COdh’oAstl)em- bpreirntt’sed 
error-bounds for series, Lagrange’s inequalities about 
derivatives, Euler’s approximations to integrals. 
There was a new interest in foundations. All that was 
needed was a sufficiently great genius to build the 
new foundation.
Two men came close. In 1816, Carl Friedrich 
Gauss gave a rigorous treatment of the convergence 
of the hypergeometric series, using the technique of 
comparing a series with convergent geometric pro­
gressions; however, Gauss did not give a general 
foundation for all of analysis. Bernhard Bolzano, 
whose work was little known until the 1860s, echo­
ing Lagrange’s call to reduce the calculus to algebra, 
gave in 1817 a definition of continuous function like 
Cauchy’s and then proved—by a different technique 
from Cauchy’s—the intermediate-value theorem [3]. 
But it was Cauchy who gave rigorous definitions and 
proofs for all the basic concepts; it was he who re­
alized the far-reaching power of the inequality-based 
limit concept; and it was he who gave us—except 
for a few implicit assumptions about uniformity and 
about completeness—the modern rigorous approach 
to calculus.
Mathematicians are used to taking the rigorous 
foundations of the calculus as a completed whole. 
What I have tried to do as a historian is to reveal 
what went into making up that great achievement. 
This needs to be done, because completed wholes by 
their nature do not reveal the separate strands that go 
into weaving them—especially when the strands have 
been considerably transformed. In Cauchy’s work, 
though, one trace indeed was left of the origin of 
rigorous calculus in approximations—the letter ep­
silon. The £ corresponds to the initial letter in the 
word ‘erreur’ (or “error”), and Cauchy in fact used £ 
for “error” in some of his work on probability [9]. Itis 
both amusing and historically appropriate that the £, 
once used to designate the ‘error’ in approximations, 
has become transformed into the characteristic sym­
bol of precision and rigor in the calculus. As Cauchy 
transformed the algebra of inequalities from a tool of 
approximation to a tool of rigor, so he transformed 
the calculus from a powerful method of generating 
results to the rigorous subject we know today.

Evolution of the Function Concept: A Brief Survey
ISRAEL KLEINER
College Mathematics Journal 20 (1989), 282-300
Introduction
The evolution of the concept of function goes back 
4000 years; 3700 of these consist of anticipations. 
The idea evolved for close to 300 years in intimate 
connection with problems in calculus and analysis. 
(A one-sentence definition of analysis as the study of 
properties of various classes of functions would not 
be far off the mark.) In fact, the concept of function 
is one of the distinguishing features of ‘modern’ as 
against ‘classical’ mathematics. W. L. Schaaf ([24], 
p. 500) goes a step further:
The keynote of Western culture is the function 
concept, a notion not even remotely hinted at by 
any earlier culture. And the function concept is 
anything but an extension or elaboration of pre­
vious number concepts—it is rather a complete 
emancipation from such notions.
The evolution of the function concept can be seen 
as a tug-of-war between two elements, two mental im­
ages: the geometric (expressed in the form of a curve) 
and the algebraic (expressed as a formula—first finite 
and later allowing infinitely many terms, the so-called 
analytic expression). (See [7], p. 256.) Subsequently, 
a third element enters, namely, the logical definition 
of function as a correspondence (with a mental im­
age of an input-output machine). In the wake of this 
development, the geometric conception of function is 
gradually abandoned. A new tug-of-war soon ensues 
(and is, in one form or another, still with us today) 
between this novel logical (abstract, synthetic, postu- 
lational) conception of function and the old algebraic 
(concrete, analytic, constructive) conception.
In this article, we will elaborate these points and 
try to give the reader a sense of the excitement and 
the challenge that some of the best mathematicians 
of all time confronted in trying to come to grips with 
the basic conception of function that we now accept 
as commonplace.
Precalculus developments
The notion of function in explicit form did not emerge 
until the beginning of the eighteenth century, although 
implicit manifestations of the concept date back to 
about 2000 B.C. The main reasons that the function 
concept did not emerge earlier were:
• lack of algebraic prerequisites—the coming to 
terms with the continuum of real numbers, and 
the development of symbolic notation;
• lack of motivation. Why define an abstract notion 
of function unless one had many examples from 
which to abstract?
In the course of about two hundred years (c. 1450­
1650), there occurred a number of developments that 
were fundamental to the rise of the function concept:
• extension of the concept of number to embrace 
real and (to some extent) even complex numbers 
(Bombelli, Stifel, et al.);
• the creation of a symbolic algebra (Viete, 
Descartes, et al.);
• the study of motion as a central problem of science 
(Kepler, Galileo, et al.);
• the wedding of algebra and geometry (Fermat, 
Descartes, et al.).
The seventeenth century witnessed the emergence 
of modern mathematized science and the invention of 
analytic geometry. Both of these developments sug­
gested a dynamic, continuous view of the functional 
relationship as against the static, discrete view held 
by the ancients.

KLEINER: Evolution of the Function Concept: A Brief Survey
15
In the blending of algebra and geometry, the key 
elements were the introduction of variables and the 
expression of the relationship between variables by 
means of equations. The latter provided a large num­
ber of examples of curves (potential functions) for 
study and set the final stage for the introduction of 
the function concept. What was lacking was the iden­
tification of the independent and dependent variables 
in an equation ([2], p. 348):
Variables are not functions. The concept of func­
tion implies a unidirectional relation between an 
independent and a dependent variable. But in the 
case of variables as they occur in mathematical 
or physical problems, there need not be such a 
division of roles. And as long as no special in­
dependent role is given to one of the variables 
involved, the variables are not functions but sim­
ply variables
See [6], [15], [27] for details.
The calculus developed by Newton and Leibniz 
had not the form that students see today. In partic­
ular, it was not a calculus of functions. The princi­
pal objects of study in seventeenth-century calculus 
were (geometric) curves. (For example, the cycloid 
was introduced geometrically and studied extensively 
well before it was given as an equation.) In fact, 
seventeenth-century analysis originated as a collec­
tion of methods for solving problems about curves, 
such as finding tangents to curves, areas under curves, 
lengths of curves, and velocities of points moving 
along curves. Since the problems that gave rise to the 
calculus were geometric and kinematic in nature, and 
since Newton and Leibniz were preoccupied with ex­
ploiting the marvelous tool that they had created, time 
and reflection would be required before the calculus 
could be recast in algebraic form.
The variables associated with a curve were geomet­
ric—abscissas, ordinates, subtangents, subnormals, 
and the radii of curvature ofa curve. In 1692, Leibniz 
introduced the word function (see [25], p. 272) to 
designate a geometric object associated with a curve. 
For example, Leibniz asserted that “a tangent is a 
function of a curve” ([12], p. 85).
Newton’s method of fluxions applies to fluents, not 
functions. Newton calls his variables fluents—the im­
age (as in Leibniz) is geometric, of a point flowing 
along a curve. Newton’s major contribution to the 
development of the function concept was his use of 
power series. These were important for the subse­
quent development of that concept.
As increased emphasis came to be placed on the 
formulas and equations relating the functions associ­
ated with a curve, attention was focused on the role of 
the symbols appearing in the formulas and equations 
and thus on the relations holding among these sym­
bols, independent of the original curve. The corre­
spondence (1694-1698) between Leibniz and Johann 
Bernoulli traces how the lack of a general term to 
represent quantities dependent on other quantities 
in such formulas and equations brought about the 
use of the term function as it appears in Bernoulli’s 
definition of 1718 (see [3], p. 9 and [27], p. 57 for 
details):
One calls here Function of a variable a quan­
tity composed in any manner whatever of this 
variable and of constants ([23], p. 72).
This was the first formal definition of function, 
although Bernoulli did not explain what “composed 
in any manner whatever” meant. See [3], [6], [12], 
[27] for details of this section.
Euler’s Introductio in Analysin 
Infinitorum
In the first half of the eighteenth century, we witness 
a gradual separation of seventeenth-century analysis 
from its geometric origin and background. This pro­
cess of degeometrization of analysis ([2], p. 345) saw 
the replacement of the concept of variable, applied 
to geometric objects, with the concept of function 
as an algebraic formula. This trend was embodied in 
Euler’s classic Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum of 
1748, intended as a survey of the concepts and meth­
ods of analysis and analytic geometry needed for a 
study of the calculus.
Euler’s Introductio was the first work in which the 
concept of function plays an explicit and central role. 
In the preface, Euler claims that mathematical analy­
sis is the general science of variables and their func­
tions. He begins by defining a function as an analytic 
expression (that is, a formula):
A function of a variable quantity is an analyt­
ical expression composed in any manner from 
that variable quantity and numbers or constant 
quantities ([23], p. 72).
Euler does not define the term analytic expres­
sion, but tries to give it meaning by explaining 
that admissible analytic expressions involve the four 
algebraic operations, roots, exponentials, logarithms, 

16
Analysis
trigonometric functions, derivatives, and integrals. He 
classifies functions as being algebraic or transcen­
dental; single-valued or multi-valued; and implicit or 
explicit. The Introductio contains one of the earliest 
treatments of trigonometric functions as numerical 
ratios (see [13]), as well as the earliest algorithmic 
treatment of logarithms as exponents. The entire ap­
proach is algebraic. Not a single picture or drawing 
appears (in Volume 1).
Expansions of functions in power series play a cen­
tral role in this treatise. In fact, Euler claims that any 
function can be expanded in a power series: “If any­
one doubts this, this doubt will be removed by the 
expansion of every function” ([3], p. 10). This remark 
was certainly in keeping with the spirit of mathemat­
ics in the eighteenth century. Hawkins ([10], p. 3) 
summarizes Euler’s contribution to the emergence of 
function as an important concept:
Although the notion of function did not originate 
with Euler, it was he who first gave it prominence 
by treating the calculus as a formal theory of 
functions.
As we shall see, Euler’s view of functions was soon 
to evolve. (See [2], [3], [6], [27] for details of the 
above.)
The vibrating-string controversy
Of crucial importance for the subsequent evolution of 
the concept of the function was the vibrating-string 
problem:
An elastic string having fixed ends (0 and f, say) 
is deformed into some initial shape and then released 
to vibrate. The problem is to determine the function 
that describes the shape of the string at time t.
The controversy centered around the meaning of 
function. In fact, Grattan-Guinness ([9], p. 2) suggests 
that in the controversy over various solutions of this 
problem,
the whole of eighteenth-century analysis was 
brought under inspection: the theory of func­
tions, the role of algebra, the real line continuum 
and the convergence of series ......
To understand the debates that surrounded the 
vibrating-string problem, we must first mention an 
article of faith of eighteenth-century mathematics:
If two analytic expressions agree on an interval, 
they agree everywhere.
This was not an unnatural assumption, given the type 
of functions (analytic expressions) considered at that 
time. On this view, the whole course of a curve given 
by an analytic expression is determined by any small 
part of the curve. This implicitly assumes that the in­
dependent variable in an analytic expression ranges 
over the whole domain of real numbers, without re­
striction.
In view of this, it is baffling (to us) that as early as 
1744, Euler wrote to Goldbach stating that
n
x
2
tt
= E
n=1
sin nx 
n
(see [27], p. 67). Here, indeed, is an example of two 
analytic expressions that agree on the interval (0, 2n), 
but nowhere else.

KLEINER: Evolution of the Function Concept: A Brief Survey
17
In 1747, d’ Alembert solved the vibrating-string 
problem by showing that the motion of the string is 
governed by the partial differential equation
y= = a2^-y (a is a constant), 
dt2 
dx 2
the so-called wave equation. Using the boundary con­
ditions y (0,t) = 0 and y (t,t) = 0, and the initial 
conditions 
y(x, 0) = f (x) and
dy 
dt t=0
=0,
he solved this partial differential equation to obtain
y(x, t) = - [$(x + at) + 0(x — at)]
as the most general solution of the vibrating-string 
problem, 0 being an arbitrary function. It follows 
readily that
y (x, 0) = f (x) = $(x) on (0, t), 
$ (x + 21) = $ (x), 
and 0 (—x) = —$ (x).
Thus, 0 is determined on (0, t) by the initial shape of 
the string, and is continued (by the article of faith) as 
an odd periodic function of period 2L
D’Alembert believed that the function $(x) (and 
hence f (x)) must be an analytic expression—that is, 
it must be given by a formula. (To d’Alembert, these 
were the only permissible functions.) Moreover, since 
this analytic expression satisfies the wave equation, it 
must be twice differentiable.
In 1748, Euler wrote a paper on the same problem 
in which he agreed completely with d’Alembert con­
cerning the solution but differed from him on its inter­
pretation. Euler contended that d’Alembert’s solution 
was not the most general, as the latter had claimed. 
Having himself solved the problem mathematically, 
Euler claimed his experiments showed that the so­
lution y (x, t) = 1 [$(x + at) + ^(x — at)] gives the 
shapes of the string for different values of t, even 
when the initial shape is not given by a (single) for­
mula. From physical considerations, Euler argued that 
the initial shape of the string can be given
(a) by several analytic expressions in different subin- 
tervalsof (0, t) (say, circulararcsofdifferentradii 
in different parts of (0, t)
or, more generally,
(b) by a curve drawn free-hand.
But according to the article of faith prevalent at the
timeEB,SnCeO itPhubelrioshfitnhge :seeBtwoook tCyolpleesctoifonin(iEtBiaSClOshhosatp)e -s cporiunltded 
be given by a single analytic expression, since such an 
expression determines the shape of the entire curve 
by its behavior on any interval, no matter how small. 
Thus, d’Alembert’s solution could not be the most 
general.
D’Alembert, who was much less interested in the 
vibrations of the string than in the mathematics of the 
problem, claimed that Euler’s argument was “against 
all rules of analysis.”
Langer ([16], p. 17) explains the differing views 
of Euler and d’Alembert concerning the vibrating­
string problem in terms of their general approach to 
mathematics:
Euler’s temperament was an imaginative one. 
He looked for guidance in large measure to 
practical considerations and physical intuition, 
and combined with a phenomenal ingenuity, an 
almost naive faith in the infallibility of math­
ematical formulas and the results of manipula­
tions upon them. D’Alembert was a more criti­
cal mind, much less susceptible to conviction by 
formalisms. A personality of impeccable scien­
tific integrity, he was never inclined to minimize 
shortcomings that he recognized, be they in his 
own work or in that of others.
Daniel Bernoulli entered the picture in 1753 by 
giving yet another solution of the vibrating-string 
problem. Bernoulli, who was essentially a physicist, 
based his argument on the physics of the problem and 
the known facts about musical vibrations (discovered 
earlier by Rameau et al.). It was generally recognized 
at the time that musical sounds (and, in particular, 
vibrations of a musical string) are composed of fun­
damental frequencies and their harmonic overtones. 
This physical evidence, and some loose mathemati­
cal reasoning, convinced Bernoulli that the solution 
to the vibrating-string problem must be given by
y(x, t)
oo\ ' n n nnx
b , bn sin —— cos nnat
I
This, of course, meant that an arbitrary function f(x) 
can be represented on (0, t) by a series of sines,
y(x, 0) = f(x) =
o
n . nnx
bns bn si^—.
(Bernoulli was only interested in solving a physical 
problem, and did not give a definition of function. By 
an arbitrary function he meant an arbitrary shape of 
the vibrating string.)
Both Euler and d’Alembert (as well as other math- 
onem11/a2t4ic/2i0a1n4s 2o:2f6 tPhMatvitaimANeT)ELfOoPEunVAdLLBEYerCnOLoLuEGllEi’s solution

Analysis
absurd. Relying on the eighteenth-century article of 
faith, they argued that since f (x) and the sine se­
ries 522=1 bn sin (nnx/t) agree on (0, £), they must 
agree everywhere. But then one arrived at the man­
ifestly absurd conclusion that an arbitrary function 
f(x) is odd and periodic. (Since Bernoulli’s initial 
shape of the string was given by an analytic ex­
pression, Euler rejected Bernoulli’s solution as being 
the most general solution.) Bernoulli retorted ([22], 
p. 78) that d’Alembert’s and Euler’s solutions consti­
tute “beautiful mathematics but what has itto do with 
vibrating strings?”
The debate lasted for several more years (it was 
joined later by Lagrange) and then died down without 
being resolved. Ravetz ([22], p. 81) characterized the 
essence of the debate as one between d’Alembert’s 
mathematical world, Bernoulli’s physical world, and 
Euler’s no-man’s land between the two. The debate 
did, however, have important consequences for the 
evolution of the function concept. Its major effect 
was to extend that concept to include:
(a) Functions defined piecewise by analytic expres­
sions in different intervals. Thus,
x x x x x > 0 
f(x) =
-xx<0
was now, for the first time, considered to be a 
bona fide function.
(b) Functions drawn freehand and possibly not given 
by any combination of analytic expressions.
As Lutzen [17] put it:
D’Alembert let the concept of function limit the 
possible initial values, while Euler let the variety 
of initial values extend the concept of function. 
We thus see that this extension of the concept of 
function was forced upon Euler by the physical 
problem in question.
To see how Euler’s own view of functions evolved 
over a period of several years, compare the definition 
of function he gave in his 1748 Introductio with the 
following definition given in 1755, in which the term 
analytic expression does not appear ([23], pp. 72-73):
If, however, some quantities depend on others 
in such a way that if the latter are changed the 
former undergo changes themselves then the for­
mer quantities are called functions of the latter 
quantities. This is a very comprehensive notion 
and comprises in itself all the modes through 
which one quantity can be determined by
others. If, therefore, x denotes a variable quan­
tity then all the quantities which depend on x in 
any manner whatever or are determined by it are 
called its functions.....
Euler’s view of functions was reinforced later in 
that century by work in partial differential equations 
([22], p. 86]):
The work of Monge in the 1770s, giving a ge­
ometric interpretation to the integration of par­
tial differential equations, seemed to provide a 
conclusive proof of the fact that functions more 
general than those expressed by an equation were 
legitimate mathematical objects.....
(See [3], [4], [9], [16], [18], [19], [22], [27] for details 
on this section.)
Fourier and Fourier series
Fourier’s work on heat conduction (submitted to the 
Paris Academy of Sciences in 1807, but published 
only in 1822 in his classic Analytic Theory of Heat) 
was a revolutionary step in the evolution of the func­
tion concept. Fourier’s main result of 1822 was the 
following.
Theorem. Any function f (x) defined over (—t, I) is 
representable over this interval by a series of sines 
and cosines,
2
f (x) = y + 
[on cos -p + bn sin —y] ,
n=1
where the coefficients on and bn are given by
on
1 x n nnt ,
1 
(t )ca>—dt
and
bn
sin npd,.
Fourier’s announcement of this result met with in­
credulity. It upset several tenets of eighteenth-century 
mathematics. The result was known to Euler and La­
grange (among others), but only for certain functions. 
Fourier, of course, claimed that it is true for all func­
tions, where the term function was given the most 
general contemporary interpretation ([23], p. 73):
In general, the function f(x) represents a suc­
cession of values or ordinates each of which is 
arbitrary. An infinity of values being given to 
the abscissa x, there are an equal number of or­
dinates f (x). All have actual numerical values, 

KLEINER: Evolution of the Function Concept: A Brief Survey
19
either positive or negative or null. We do not 
suppose these ordinates to be subject to a com­
mon law; they succeed each other in any manner 
whatever, and each of them is given as if it were 
a single quantity.
Fourier’s proof of his theorem was loose even by 
the standards of the early nineteenth century. In 
fact, it was formalism in the spirit of the eighteenth 
century—“a play upon symbols in accordance with 
accepted rules but without much or any regard for 
content or significance” ([16], p. 33). To convince the 
reluctant mathematical community of the reasonable­
ness of his claim, Fourier needed to show that:
(a) The coefficients of the Fourier series can be cal­
culated for any f (x).
(b) Any function f (x) can be represented by its 
Fourier series in (—£, £).
He showed this by:
(a') Interpreting the coefficients an and bn in the 
Fourier series expansion of f(x) as areas (which 
made sense for arbitrary functions f (x), not nec­
essarily given by analytic expressions).
(b') Calculating the an and bn (for small values of n) 
for a great variety of functions f (x), and noting 
the close agreement in (-£, £) (but not outside 
that interval) between the initial segments of the 
resulting Fourier series and the functional values 
of f(x).
Fourier accomplished all this using mathematical 
reasoning that would be clearly unacceptable to us 
today. However,
It was, no doubt, partially because of his very 
disregard for rigor that he was able to take con­
ceptual steps which were inherently impossible 
to men of more critical genius ([16], p. 33).
Fourier’s work raised the analytic (algebraic) ex­
pression of a function to at least an equal footing 
with its geometric representation (as a curve). His 
work had a fundamental and far-reaching impact on 
subsequent developments in mathematics. (For ex­
ample, it forced mathematicians to re-examine the 
notion of integral, and was the starting point of the 
researches that led Cantor to his creation of the the­
ory of sets.) As for its impact on the evolution of the 
function concept, Fourier’s work:
• did away with the article of faith held by 
eighteenth-century mathematicians. (Thus, it was 
now clear that two functions given by different an­
alytic expressions can agree on an interval without 
necessarily agreeing outside the interval.)
• showed that Euler’s concept of discontinuous was 
flawed. (Some of Euler’s discontinuous functions 
were shown to be representable by a Fourier 
series—an analytic expression—and were thus 
continuous in Euler’s sense.)
• gave renewed emphasis to analytic expressions.
As we shall see, all this forced a re-evaluation of the 
function concept. (See [3], [6], [7], [9], [16], [19] for 
details.)
As we have noted, the period 1720-1820 was char­
acterized by a development and exploitation of the 
tools of the calculus bequeathed by the seventeenth 
century. These tools were employed in the solution 
of important ‘practical’ problems (e.g., the vibrating­
string problem, the heat-conduction problem). These 
problems, in turn, clamored for attention to important 
‘theoretical’ concepts (e.g., function, continuity, con­
vergence). A new subject—analysis—began to take 
form, in which the concept of function was central. 
But both the subject and the concept were still in 
their formative stages. It was a period of formalism 
in analysis—formal manipulations dictated the rules 
of the game, with little concern for rigor. The concept 
of function was ina state of flux—an analytic expres­
sion (an ‘arbitrary’ formula), then a curve (drawn 
freehand), and then again an analytic expression (but 
this time a specific formula, namely a Fourier series). 
Both the subject of analysis (certainly its basic no­
tions) and the concept of function were ripe for a 
re-evaluation and a reformulation. This is the next 
stage in our development.
Dirichlet’s concept of function
Dirichlet was one of the early exponents of the criti­
cal spirit in mathematics ushered in by the nineteenth 
century (others were Gauss, Abel, Cauchy). He un­
dertook a careful analysis of Fourier’s work to make it 
mathematically respectable. The task was not simple:
To make sense out of what he [Fourier] did took 
a century of effort by men of “more critical 
genius”, and the end is not yet in sight ([4], 
p. 263).
Fourier’s result that any function can be represented 
by its Fourier series was, of course, incorrect. In a 

20
Analysis
fundamental paper of 1829, Dirichlet gave sufficient 
conditions for such representability:
Theorem. If a function f has only finitely many 
discontinuities and finitely many maxima and min­
ima in (— Li), then f may be represented by its 
Fourier series on (— Li). (The Fourier series con­
verges pointwise to f where f is continuous, and to 
[f (x+) + f (x-)]/2 at each point x where f is dis­
continuous.)
For a mathematically rigorous proof of this theo­
rem, one needed
(a) clear notions of continuity, convergence, and the 
definite integral, and
(b) clear understanding of the function concept.
Cauchy contributed to the former, and Dirichlet to the 
latter. We first turn very briefly to Cauchy’s contribu­
tions.
Cauchy was one of the first mathematicians to 
usher in a new spirit of rigor in analysis (see the 
article by Judith Grabiner earlier in this volume). In 
his famed Cours d’Analyse of 1821 and subsequent 
works, he rigorously defined the concepts of conti­
nuity, differentiability, and integrability of a function 
in terms of limits. (Bolzano had done much of this 
earlier, but his work went unnoticed for fifty years.)
In dealing with continuity, Cauchy addresses him­
self to Euler’s conceptions of continuous and discon­
tinuous. He shows that the function
f(x) =
-x,
x > 0
x<0
(which Euler considered discontinuous) can also be 
written as f (x) = \[x2, and
r_?_ d 
'0 x 2 +12 dt,
which means that f(x) is also continuous in Eu­
ler’s sense. This paradoxical situation, Cauchy claims, 
cannot happen when his definition of continuity is 
used.
Cauchy’s conception of function is not very differ­
ent from that of his predecessors:
When the variable quantities are linked together 
in such a way that, when the value of one of them 
is given, we can infer the values of all the others, 
we ordinarily conceive that these various quanti­
ties are expressed by means of one of them which 
then takes the name of independent variable; and 
the remaining quantities, expressed by means of 
the independent variable, are those which one 
calls the functions of this variable ([3], p. 104).
Although Cauchy gives a rather general definition 
of a function, his subsequent comments suggest that 
he had in mind something more limited (see [10], 
p. 10). He classifies functions as simple and mixed. 
The simple functions are
a + x, a - x, ax, a/x, xa, ax, log x, sin x, 
cos x, arcsin x, arccos x,
and the mixed functions are composites of the ‘sim­
ple’ ones—say, log(sin x). See [3], [6], [8], [9], [12], 
[14] for Cauchy’s contribution.
Now let us consider Dirichlet’s definition of func­
tion [19]:
y is a function of a variable x, defined on the 
interval a<x<b, if to every value of the vari­
able x in this interval there corresponds a definite 
value of the variable y. Also, it is irrelevant in 
what way this correspondence is established.
The novelty in Dirichlet’s conception of function 
as an arbitrary correspondence lies not so much in the 
definition as in its application. Mathematicians from 
Euler through Fourier to Cauchy had paid lip service 
to the arbitrary nature of functions; but in practice 
they thought of functions as analytic expressions or 
curves. Dirichlet was the first to take seriously the no­
tion of function as an arbitrary correspondence (but 
see [3], p. 201). This is made abundantly clear in his 
1829 paper on Fourier series, at the end of which he 
gives an example of a function (the Dirichlet func­
tion),
c, 
x is rational
d, 
x is irrational, 
that does not satisfy the hypothesis of his theorem on 
the representability of a function by a Fourier series 
(see [10], p. 15). The Dirichlet function:
• was the first explicit example of a function that was 
not given by an analytic expression (or by several 
such), nor was it a curve drawn freehand;
• was the first example of a function that is discon­
tinuous (in our, not Euler’s sense) everywhere;
• illustrated the concept of function as an arbitrary 
pairing.
Another important point is that Dirichlet, in his 
definition of function, was among the first to restrict 
D(x) =

21
explicitly the domain of the function to an interval; 
in the past, the independent variable was allowed to 
range over all real numbers. (See [3], [5], [9], [10], 
[15], [17], [27] for details about Dirichlet’s work.)
Pathological functions
With his new example D(x), Dirichlet ‘let the ge­
nie escape from the bottle’. A flood of ‘pathological 
functions’, and classes of functions, followed in the 
succeeding half century. Certain functions were intro­
duced to test the domain of applicability of various 
results (e.g., the Dirichlet function was introduced in 
connection with the representability ofa function in a 
Fourier series). Certain classes of functions were in­
troduced in order to extend various concepts or results 
(e.g., functions of bounded variation were introduced 
to test the domain of applicability of the Riemann 
integral).
The character of analysis began to change. Since 
the seventeenth century, the processes of analysis 
were assumed to be applicable to all functions, but 
it now turned out that they are restricted to partic­
ular classes of functions. In fact, the investigation 
of various classes of functions—such as continuous 
functions, semi-continuous functions, differentiable 
functions, functions with non-integrable derivatives, 
integrable functions, monotonic functions, continu­
ous functions that are not piecewise monotonic— 
became a principal concern of analysis. (One example 
is Dini’s study of continuous non-differentiable func­
tions, for which he defined the so-called Dini deriva­
tives.) Whereas mathematicians had formerly looked 
for order and regularity in analysis, they now took 
delight in discovering exceptions and irregularities. 
The towering personalities connected with these de­
velopments were Riemann and Weierstrass, although 
many others made important contributions (e.g., du 
Bois Reymond and Darboux).
The first major step in these developments was 
taken by Riemann in his Habilitationsschrift of 1854, 
which dealt with the representation of functions in 
Fourier series. As we recall, the coefficients of a 
Fourier series are given by integrals. Cauchy had de­
veloped his integral only for continuous functions, but 
his ideas could be extended to functions with finitely 
many discontinuities. Riemann extended Cauchy’s 
concept of integral and thus enlarged the class of 
functions representable by Fourier series. This exten­
sion (known today as the Riemann integral) applies 
to functions of bounded variation, a much broader 
class of functions than Cauchy’s continuous func­
tions. Thus, a function can have infinitely many dis­
continuities (which can be dense in any interval) and 
still be Riemann integrable.
Riemann gave the following example (published in 
1867) in his Habilitationsschrift:
f (x ) = i + <x’ + <2x’ + <3x2 +..., 
where for any real number a the function (a) is de­
fined as 0 if a = 11 + k (k an integer), and a minus the 
nearest integer when a = 2 + k (k an integer). This 
function is discontinuous for all x = m/2n, where m 
is an integer relatively prime to 2n (see [6], p. 325). In 
contrast to Dirichlet’s function D(x), this one is given 
by an analytic expression and is Riemann-integrable.
Riemann’s work may be said to mark the begin­
ning of a theory of the mathematically discontinuous 
(although there are isolated examples in Fourier’s and 
Dirichlet’s works). It planted the discontinuous firmly 
upon the mathematical scene. The importance of this 
development can be inferred from the following state­
ment of Hawkins ([10], p. 3):
The history of integration theory after Cauchy 
is essentially a history of attempts to extend the 
integral concept to as many discontinuous func­
tions as possible; such attempts could become 
meaningful only after existence of highly dis­
continuous functions was recognized and taken 
seriously.
In 1872, Weierstrass startled the mathematical 
community with his famous example of a continu­
ous nowhere-differentiable function
oo
f(x)
bn cos (annx), 
n= 1
where a is an odd integer, b a real number in (0, 1), 
and ab > 1 + 3n/2 (see [12], p. 387). (Bolzano had 
given such an example in 1834, but it went unnoticed.) 
This example was contrary to all geometric intuition. 
In fact, up to about 1870, most books on the calculus 
‘proved’ that a continuous function is differentiable 
except possibly at a finite number of points! (See [10], 
p. 43.) Even Cauchy believed that.
Weierstrass’s example began the disengagement of 
the continuous from the differentiable in analysis. 
Weierstrass’s work (and others’ in this period) neces­
sitated a re-examination of the foundations of analysis 
and led to the so-called arithmetization of analysis, 
in which process Weierstrass was a prime mover. As 
Birkhoff notes ([3], p. 71):

22
Analysis
Weierstrass demonstrated the need for higher 
standards of rigor by constructing counter­
examples to plausible and widely held notions.
Counter-examples play an important role in 
mathematics. They illuminate relationships, clarify 
concepts, and often lead to the creation of new math­
ematics. (An interesting case study of the role of 
counter-examples in mathematics can be found in 
the book Proofs and Refutations by I. Lakatos.) The 
impact of the developments we have been describ­
ing was, as we already noted, to change the character 
of analysis. A new subject was born—the theory of 
functions of a real variable. Hawkins ([10], p. 119) 
gives a vivid description of the state of affairs:
The nascent theory of functions of a real variable 
grew out of the development of a more crit­
ical attitude, supported by numerous counter­
examples, towards the reasoning of earlier 
mathematicians. Thus, for example, continuous 
non-differentiable functions, discontinuous se­
ries of continuous functions, and continuous 
functions that are not piecewise monotonic were 
discovered. The existence of exceptions came 
to be accepted and more or less expected. And 
the examples of non-integrable derivatives, rec­
tifiable curves for which the classical integral 
formula is inapplicable, non-integrable func­
tions that are the limit of integrable functions, 
Harnack-integrable derivatives for which the 
Fundamental Theorem II is false, and counterex­
amples to the classical form of Fubini’s Theo­
rem appear to have been received in this frame 
of mind. The idea, as Schoenflies put it in his re­
port . . . was to proceed, as in human pathology, 
to discover as many exceptional phenomena as 
possible in order to determine the laws according 
to which they could be classified.
It should be pointed out, however, that not every­
one was pleased with these developments (at least in 
analysis), as the following quotations from Hermite 
(in 1893) and Poincare (in 1899), respectively, attest 
([15], p. 973):
I turn away with fright and horror from this 
lamentable evil of functions which do not have 
derivatives. [Hermite]
Logic sometimes makes monsters. For half a 
century we have seen a mass of bizarre functions 
which appear to be forced to resemble as little 
as possible honest functions which serve some 
purpose. More of continuity, or less of conti­
nuity, more derivatives, and so forth. Indeed, 
from the point of view of logic, these strange 
functions are the most general; on the other 
hand those which one meets without searching 
for them, and which follow simple laws appear 
as a particular case which does not amount to 
more than a small corner.
In former times when one invented a new func­
tion it was for a practical purpose; today one 
invents them purposely to show up defects in 
the reasoning of our fathers and one will deduce 
from them only that.
If logic were the sole guide of the teacher, 
it would be necessary to begin with the most 
general functions, that is to say with the most 
bizarre. It is the beginner that would have to 
be set grappling with this teratologic museum. 
[Poincare]
The effect of the events we have been describing on 
the function concept can be summarized as follows. 
Stimulated by Dirichlet’s conception of function and 
his example D(x), the notion of function as an ar­
bitrary correspondence is given free rein and gains 
general acceptance; the geometric view of function 
is given little consideration. (Riemann’s and Weier- 
strass’s functions could certainly not be ‘drawn’, nor 
could most of the other examples given during this 
period.) After Dirichlet’s work, the term function ac­
quired a clear meaning independent of the term ana­
lytic expression. During the next half century, math­
ematicians introduced a large number of examples 
of functions in the spirit of Dirichlet’s broad defini­
tion, and the time was ripe for an effort to determine 
which functions were actually describable by means 
of analytic expressions, a vague term in use during 
the previous two centuries. (See [3], [10], [14], [15] 
for details of this period.)
Baire’s classification scheme
The question whether every function in Dirichlet’s 
sense is representable analytically was first posed by 
Dini in 1878 (see [5], p. 31). Baire had undertaken to 
give an answer in his doctoral thesis of 1898. The very 
notion of analytic representability had to be clarified, 
since it was used in the past in an informal way. Dini 
himself used it vaguely, asking
if every function can be expressed analytically, 
for all values of the variable in the interval, by a 

KLEINER: Evolution of the Function Concept: A Brief Survey
23
finite or infinite series of operations (“operations 
du calcul”) on the variable ([5], p. 32).
The starting point for Baire’s scheme was the 
Weierstrass Approximation Theorem (published in 
1885):
Every continuous function f (x) on an interval 
[a, b] is a uniform limit of polynomials on [a, b].
Baire called the class of continuous functions class 0. 
Then he defined the functions of class 1 to be those 
that are not in class 0, but which are (point-wise) lim­
its of functions of class 0. In general, the functions of 
class m are those functions which are not in any of the 
preceding classes, but are representable as limits of 
sequences of functions of class m - 1. This process is 
continued, by transfinite induction, to all ordinals less 
than the first uncountable ordinal Q. (Since the Baire 
functions thus constructed are closed under limits, 
nothing new results if this process is repeated.) This 
classification into Baire classes a (a < Q) is called 
the Baire classification, and the functions which con­
stitute the union of the Baire classes are called Baire 
functions.
Baire called a function analytically representable 
if it belonged to one of the Baire classes. Thus, a func­
tion is analytically representable (in Baire’s sense) if 
it can be built up from a variable and constants byafi- 
nite or denumerable set of additions, multiplications, 
and passages to pointwise limits.
The collection of analytically representable func­
tions (Baire functions) is very encompassing. For 
example, discontinuous functions representable by 
Fourier series belong to class 1. Thus, functions rep­
resentable by Fourier series constitute only a part of 
the totality of analytically representable functions. 
(Recall Fourier’s claim that every function can be 
represented by a Fourier series!) As another example, 
Baire showed that the pathological Dirichlet function 
D(x) is of class 2, since
D(x)= 
cd,,
x is rational
x is irrational
= (c — d) lim lim (cos n!nx)2m + d. 
n —>^> m —>^>
Moreover, any function obtained from a variable and 
constants by an application of the four algebraic op­
erations and the operations of analysis (such as differ­
entiation, integration, expansion in series, use of tran­
scendental functions)—the kind of function known in 
the past as an analytic expression—was shown to be 
analytically representable.
Lebesgue pursued these studies and showed (in 
1905) that each of the Baire classes is non-empty, 
and that the Baire classes do not exhaust all functions. 
Thus, Lebesgue established that there are functions 
which are not analytically representable (in Baire’s 
sense). This he did by actually exhibiting a function 
outside the Baire classification, “using a profound 
but extremely complex method” [19]. According to 
Luzin [19], “the impact of Lebesgue’s discovery was 
just as stunning as that of Fourier in his time.” (See 
[5], [19], [20], [21] for details.)
Not all functions in the sense of Dirichlet’s con­
ception of function as an arbitrary correspondence 
are analytically representable (in the sense of Baire), 
although it is (apparently) very difficult to produce a 
specific function that is not. Do such non-analytically 
representable functions really exist? This is part of 
our story in the next section.
Debates about the nature of 
mathematical objects
Function theory was characterized by some at the turn 
of the twentieth century as the branch of mathematics 
which deals with counter-examples. This view was 
not universally applauded, as the earlier quotations 
from Hermite and Poincare indicate. In particular, 
Dirichlet’s general conception of function began to be 
questioned. Objections were raised against the phrase 
in his definition that “it is irrelevant in what way this 
correspondence is established.” Subsequently, the ar­
guments for and against this point linked up with the 
arguments for and against the axiom of choice (ex­
plicitly formulated by Zermelo in 1904) and broad­
ened into a debate over whether mathematicians are 
free to create their objects at will.
There was a famous exchange of letters in 1905 
among Baire, Borel, Hadamard, and Lebesgue con­
cerning the current logical state of mathematics (see 
[5], [20], [21] for details). Much of the debate was 
about function theory—the critical question being 
whether a definition of a mathematical object (say 
a number or a function), however given, legitimizes 
the existence of that object; in particular, whether Zer- 
melo’s axiom of choice is a legitimate mathematical 
tool for the definition or construction of functions. 
In this context, Dirichlet’s conception of function 
was found to be too broad by some (e.g., Lebesgue) 
and devoid of meaning by others (e.g., Baire and 
Borel), but was acceptable to yet others (e.g., 
Hadamard). Baire, Borel, and Lebesgue supported the 

24
Analysis
requirement of a definite ‘law’ of correspondence 
in the definition of a function. The ‘law’, moreover, 
must be reasonably explicit—that is, understood by 
and communicable to anyone who wants to study the 
function.
To illustrate the point, Borel compares the number 
n (whose successive digits can be unambiguously 
determined, and which he therefore regards as well 
defined) with the number obtained by carrying out 
the following ‘thought experiment’. Suppose we lined 
up infinitely many people and asked each of them to 
name a digit at random. Borel claims that, unlike n, 
this number is not well defined since its digits are not 
related by any law. This being so, two mathematicians 
discussing this number will never be certain that they 
are talking about the same number. Put briefly, Borel’s 
position is that without a definite law of formation of 
the digits of an infinite decimal, one cannot be certain 
of its identity.
Hadamard had no difficulty in accepting as legiti­
mate the number resulting from Borel’s thought ex­
periment. By way of illustration, he alluded to the 
kinetic theory of gases, where one speaks of the veloc­
ities of molecules in a given volume of gas although 
no one knows them precisely. Hadamard felt that “the 
requirement of a law that determines a function . . . 
strongly resembles the requirement of an analytic ex­
pression for that function, and that this is a throwback 
to the eighteenth century” [19].
The issues described here were part of broad de­
bates about various ways of doing analysis—syn­
thetic versus analytic, or idealist versus empiricist. 
These debates, in turn, foreshadowed subsequent 
‘battles’ between proponents and opponents of the 
various philosophies of mathematics (e.g., formalism 
and intuitionism) dealing with the nature and mean­
ing of mathematics. And, of course, the issue has 
not been resolved. (See [4], [5], [19], [20], [21] for 
details.)
The period 1830-1910 witnessed an immense 
growth in mathematics, both in scope and in depth. 
New mathematical fields were formed (complex anal­
ysis, algebraic number theory, non-Euclidean geom­
etry, abstract algebra, mathematical logic), and older 
ones were deepened (real analysis, probability, ana­
lytic number theory, calculus of variations). Mathe­
maticians felt free to create their systems (almost) at 
will, without finding it necessary to seek motivation 
from or applications to concrete (physical) settings. 
At the same time there was, throughout the nineteenth 
century, a reassessment of gains achieved, accompa­
nied by a concern for the foundations of (various 
branches of) mathematics. These trends are reflected 
in the evolution of the notion of function. The concept 
unfolds from its modest beginnings as a formula or 
a geometric curve (eighteenth and early nineteenth 
centuries) to an arbitrary correspondence (Dirich­
let). This latter idea is exploited throughout the nine­
teenth century by way of the construction of various 
‘pathological’ functions. Toward the end of the cen­
tury, there is a re-evaluation of past accomplishments 
(Baire classification, controversy relating to use of the 
axiom of choice), much of it in the broader context of 
debates about the nature and meaning of mathemat­
ics.
Recent developments
Here we briefly touch on three more recent develop­
ments relating to the function concept.
(A) L2 functions. The set
L2 = {f (x):f2 (x) is Lebesgue-integrable}
forms a Hilbert space—a fundamental object in func­
tional analysis. Two functions in L2 are considered 
to be the same if they agree everywhere except pos­
sibly on a set of Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, in L2 
Function Theory, one can always work with represen­
tatives in an equivalence class rather than with indi­
vidual functions. These notions, as Davis and Hersh 
observed ([4], p. 269),
involve a further evolution of the concept of 
function. For an element in L2 is not a function, 
either in Euler’s sense of an analytic expression, 
or in Dirichlet’s sense of a rule or mapping as­
sociating one set of numbers with another. It 
is function-like in the sense that it can be sub­
jected to certain operations normally applied to 
functions (adding, multiplying, integrating). But 
since it is regarded as unchanged if its values are 
altered on an arbitrary set of measure zero, it is 
certainly not just a rule assigning values at each 
point in its domain.
(B) Generalized functions (Distributions). The con­
cept of a distribution or generalized function is a very 
significant and fundamental extension of the concept 
of function. The theory of distributions arose in the 
1930s and 1940s. It was created to give mathematical 
meaning to the differentiation of non-differentiable 
functions—a process which the physicists had em­
ployed (unrigorously) for some time. Thus, Heaviside

(in 1893) differentiated the function
11 ’
f(x) = 1/2,
|o >
x>0
x=0
x<0
to obtain the impulse function
3 (x) =
x=0
x=0.
(In 1930, Dirac introduced 3(x) as a convenient no­
tation in the mathematical formulation of quantum 
theory.)
In formal terms, a distribution is a continuous lin­
ear functional ona space D of infinitely differentiable 
functions (called test functions) that vanish outside 
some interval [a, b]. To any continuous (or locally in­
tegrable) function F, there corresponds a distribution 
$ F : D ^ C given by
Z
oo
F (t)x(t)dt.
-rc>
However, not every distribution comes from such 
a function. The distribution 6 : D ^ C given by 
3(x) = x(0) corresponds to the Dirac 3-function 
mentioned above, and does not arise from any func­
tion F in the way described above. (See [4], [18], 
[26].)
A basic property of distributions is that each dis­
tribution has a derivative that is again a distribution. 
In fact ([26], p. 338),
the enduring merit of distribution theory has 
been that the basic operations of analy­
sis, differentiation and convolution, and the 
Fourier/Laplace transforms and their inversion, 
which demanded so much care in the classical 
framework, could now be carried out without 
qualms by obeying purely algebraic rules.
(C) Category theory. The notion of a function as 
a mapping between arbitrary sets gradually became 
dominant in the mathematics of the twentieth century. 
Algebra had a major impact on this development, in 
which the concept of a function was placed in the 
general framework of the concept of a mapping from 
one set into another. Thus, linear transformations of 
vector spaces (principally, Rn and Cn) were dealt 
with throughout much of the nineteenth century. Ho­
momorphisms of groups and automorphisms of fields 
were introduced in the latter part of that century. As 
early as 1887, Dedekind gave a fairly ‘modern’ defi­
nition of the term mapping ([23], p. 75):
By a mapping of a system S a law is understood, 
in accordance with which to each determinate 
element s of S there is associated a determinate 
object, which is called the image of s and is de­
noted by <p (s); we say too, that <p (s) corresponds 
to the element s, that p (s) is caused or generated 
by the mapping p out of s, that s is transformed 
by the mapping p into p (s).
Analysis, too, played a major role in this exten­
sion of the domain and range of definition of a func­
tion to arbitrary sets. (Recall that Dirichlet’s defini­
tion of function was as an arbitrary correspondence 
between (real) numbers.) Thus, Euler and others in 
the eighteenth century treated (informally) functions 
of several variables. In 1887, considered the year of 
birth of functional analysis, Volterra defined the no­
tion of a ‘functional’ which he called a “function of 
functions”. (A functional is a function whose domain 
is a set of functions and whose range is the real or 
complex numbers.) In the first two decades of the 
twentieth century, the notions of metric space, topo­
logical space, Hilbert space, and Banach space were 
introduced; functions (operators, linear operators) be­
tween such spaces play a prominent role. (See [15] 
for details.)
In 1939, Bourbaki gave the following definition of 
a function ([3], p. 7):
Let E and F be two sets, which may or may 
not be distinct. A relation between a variable 
element x of E and a variable element y ofF is 
called a functional relation in y if, for all x & E, 
there exists a unique y & F which is in the given 
relation with x.
We give the name of function to the operation 
which in this way associates with every element 
x & E the element y & F which is in the given 
relation with x; y is said to be the value of the 
function at the element x, and the function is 
said to be determined by the given functional 
relation. Two equivalent functional relations de­
termine the same function.
Bourbaki then also gave the definition of a function 
as a certain subset of the Cartesian product E x F. 
This is, of course, the definition of function as a set 
of ordered pairs.
All of these ‘modern’ general definitions of func­
tion were given in terms of sets, and hence their logic 
must receive the same scrutiny as that of set theory.
In category theory, which arose in the late 1940s to 
give formal expression to certain aspects of homology 

26
Analysis
theory, the concept of function assumes a fundamen­
tal role. It can be described as an ‘association’ from 
an ‘object’ A to another ‘object’ B. The objects A 
and B need not have any elements (that is, they need 
not be sets in the usual sense). In fact, the objects A 
and B can be entirely dispensed with. A category can 
then be defined as consisting of functions (or ‘maps’), 
which are taken as undefined (primitive) concepts sat­
isfying certain relations or axioms. In fact, in 1966 
Lawvere outlined how category theory can replace 
set theory as a foundation for mathematics. (See [11] 
for details.)
In the recent developments outlined in this section, 
we have seen the function concept modified (L2 func­
tions), generalized (distributions), and finally ‘gener­
alized out of existence’ (category theory). Have we 
come full circle?

Sofya Kovalevsky was a noted writer whose works 
include both fiction and non-fiction. She was also a 
political activist and a public advocate of feminism. In 
addition, she was a brilliant mathematician who made 
significant contributions despite the enormous edu­
cational and political obstacles that she had to over­
come. Somehow her many achievements have been 
forgotten. In those few instances where her work has 
not been lost it has been denigrated by such studies 
as Felix Klein’s history of nineteenth-century math­
ematics. Klein dismisses Kovalevsky’s work in the 
following manner ([3], p. 294): “Her works are done 
in the style of Weierstrass and so one doesn’t know 
how much of her own ideas are in them.” He finds 
something wrong with all her research and credits 
her with only one positive accomplishment, drawing 
Weierstrass out of his shell through their correspon­
dence. It is time to set this record straight and to let the 
facts speak for themselves. (Although Kovalevskaya, 
the feminine version of the name Kovalevsky, is used 
in much of the current literature, the author will refer 
to Kovalevsky in this paper, as that was the name un­
der which Sofya Kovalevsky worked and published. 
However, in the references the author has used the 
version of the name that appeared in the work cited.)
Sofya Krukovsky, known affectionately as Sonya, 
was born in Moscow in 1850. Her father, a Russian 
army officer, retired in 1858 and moved the family— 
Sofya, her older sister, Anyuta, and her younger 
brother, Fedya—to Palibino, an estate near the Lithua­
nian border. After settling at Palibino, the house­
hold discovered that they had not brought a sufficient 
amount of wallpaper with them. Rather than travel a 
great distance to obtain new wallpaper, they decided 
to use old newspapers on the wall. Since only the 
nursery required the paper, this was deemed an ade­
quate solution. However, while searching the attic for 
newspaper, they discovered paper of a better quality.
On it were the lecture notes from a calculus course 
taken by General Krukovsky. This is how the nurs­
ery walls came to be covered with the calculus notes 
that, in her later years, Sofya claimed to have stud­
ied. Sofya often repeated this anecdote and enjoyed 
reporting how her calculus teacher exclaimed ([17], 
p. 216): “You have understood them as though you 
knew them in advance.”
Kovalevsky claimed that her interest in mathemat­
ics was aroused by her Uncle Peter, who would discuss 
numerous abstractions and mathematical concepts 
with her. When the family tutor, Joseph Malevich, 
read of this in Sofya’s autobiographical work, Mem­
ories of Childhood, he was incensed. He wrote a 
long essay in a Russian newspaper explaining why he 
should receive credit for Kovalevsky’s mathematical 
development. In response to this criticism Kovalevsky 
wrote the following tribute in An Autobiographical 
Sketch ([17], p. 216): “It is to Joseph Malevich that 
I am indebted for my first systematic study of math­
ematics. It happened so long ago that I no longer 
remember his lessons at all..... It was arithmetic that
Malevich taught best ...Ihavetoconfess that arith­
metic held little interest for me.”
Kovalevsky studied mathematics against her fa­
ther’s wishes. When she was thirteen, she smuggled 
an algebra text into her room and studied it. When 
she was fourteen she taught herself trigonometry in 
order to study a physics book written by her neigh­
bor Professor Tyrtov—trigonometry was necessary 
for the optics section, and the young Sofya taught 
herself without tutor or text. By constructing a chord 
on a circle, she was able to explain the sine func­
tion and to develop the other trigonometric formulas. 
When Professor Tyrtov saw her work, he was struck 
by its similarity to the actual mathematical develop­
ment. Calling her a new Pascal, Tyrtov pleaded with 
the General to permit Sofya to study mathematics.

Analysis
After a year of exhortation, General Krukovsky re­
lented and allowed Sofya to go to Petersburg to study 
calculus and other subjects.
After completing her studies in 1867, Sofya wanted 
to continue her education, but the Russian univer­
sity system was closed to women. The only op­
tion for study was to go to Switzerland, but Gen­
eral Krukovsky would not allow his daughters to go 
abroad.
Sofya’s older sister, Anyuta, felt imprisoned at Pal- 
ibino and sought a way out. She found it through 
the radical politics of the times. This was a period 
of political ferment in Russia. The nihilists, femi­
nists, and radicalists were all active, and their ideas 
were brought to Palibino by the local priest’s son on 
his vacation from school in Petersburg. While they 
scandalized the neighborhood, these ideas had great 
influence on Anyuta, who in turn influenced Sofya. 
Anyuta joined a radical group that advocated higher 
education for women and promoted the concept of 
the “fictitious husband” to enable women to obtain 
more freedom. A married woman did not need her 
father’s signature for a passport, and so a fictitious 
husband would enable Anyuta to travel abroad for 
her education. Anyuta and her friend Zhanna found a 
26-year-old university student, Vladimir Kovalevsky, 
who agreed to marry one of them. Unfortunately 
for Anyuta, she brought Sofya to one of their meet­
ings. Vladimir became infatuated with Sofya and in­
sisted on marrying her. After several secret meetings 
and much intrigue, General Krukovsky consented, 
and Vladimir and Sofya were married in Septem­
ber 1868.
Following their marriage, the Kovalevskys left for 
Petersburg to study, and to search for a husband for 
Anyuta. With little effort Sofya had won the freedom 
to pursue her education, the freedom and indepen­
dence that Anyuta had been fighting so hard for. So­
fya’s feelings of guilt about this can be seen in her 
letters to Anyuta, who was still confined at Palibino. 
She wrote ([16], p. 232; cited in [17], p. 11): “At times 
a strange anguish comes over me and I feel ashamed 
that everything is coming to me so easily and without 
any struggle.”
In Petersburg, Sofya received permission from the 
instructors to attend classes unofficially. She wrote 
([16], p. 225) to her sister: “ ... Lectures begin to­
morrow and so my real life begins at 9 A.M.....
[Vladimir] and friends will solemnly escort me by 
way of the backstairs so that there is hope of 
hiding from the administration and from curious 
stares.” It was at Petersburg that Sofya decided to 
concentrate on mathematics. In a letter to Anyuta she 
said ([22], p. 25): “I have become convinced that 
one cannot learn everything and one life is barely 
sufficient to accomplish what I can in my chosen 
field.”
The Kovalevskys and Anyuta, who was still un­
married but chaperoned by the young couple, left for 
Europe in 1869. Sofya intended to study mathemat­
ics, and Vladimir geology. Anyuta planned to pursue 
her revolutionary activities. Sofya and Vladimir set­
tled in Heidelberg, but Sofya was not permitted to 
matriculate at the university. She appealed to both the 
faculty and the administration. A special committee 
was formed, and it was decided that each individ­
ual professor could choose whether to permit Sofya 
Kovalevsky to attend his lectures unofficially.
Kovalevsky was now able to attend lectures, and 
her outstanding mathematical ability became the talk 
of Heidelberg. As a firm believer in education for 
women, she used her reputation to assist other Rus­
sian women in their efforts to attend the university. 
One of these women was her friend Yulya Lermontov, 
who later became the first female chemist in Russia. 
For many years Bunsen had described Sofya as “a 
dangerous woman” because, according to him, Sofya 
had tricked him into permitting Yulya to use the pre­
viously all-male chemistry labs. In 1874, Karl Weier- 
strass asked Sofya for confirmation of the story be­
cause “he [Bunsen] writes fiction even if he doesn’t 
publish it.” (See [27], p. 51.)
Sofya, Vladimir, and Yulya lived and studied to­
gether in Heidelberg until the fall of 1869. When 
Anyuta arrived for a visit, she was quite surprised to 
find Sofya still living with her fictitious husband and 
proceeded to evict Vladimir from the apartment. A 
short time later, Vladimir left Heidelberg to study at 
Jena.
As her mathematics progressed, Kovalevsky felt 
the need to study with Karl Weierstrass, the most 
noted mathematician of the time, at the University of 
Berlin. She traveled to Berlin for the start of the fall 
semester of 1870, only to find the university closed 
to women. Sofya wrote ([17], p. 218): “The capital 
of Prussia proved to be backward. Despite all my 
pleadings and efforts I had no success in obtaining 
permission to attend the University of Berlin.”
Determined to study mathematics, Kovalevsky per­
sonally presented herself to Weierstrass as an aspir­
ing student. On the basis of recommendations from 
Koenigsberger at Heidelberg, Weierstrass was will­
ing to see her. He assigned her a set of problems on 
hyperelliptic functions that he had just given to his 

RAPPAPORT: S. Kovalevsky: A Mathematical Lesson
29
class. Weierstrass was so impressed with the ability 
she demonstrated in her solutions that he personally 
requested the university to allow her to attend his 
classes unofficially. However, the university was in­
transigent in its decision.
Not wanting to waste this mathematical talent, 
Weierstrass offered to tutor Kovalevsky privately. The 
lessons, begun in the fall of 1870, lasted for four years. 
The working relationship lasted a lifetime. When 
Weierstrass made his offer, he had no idea that Ko­
valevsky would become the closest of his disciples 
and remain so until her death.
The lessons began with twice-weekly meetings, 
Sundays at Weierstrass’s home and weekdays at Ko­
valevsky’s. The mathematics lessons are partially 
documented in a series of forty-one letters from 
Weierstrass to Kovalevsky, spanning the period of 
March 1871 to August 1874. They show that the em­
phasis was on Weierstrass’s favorite topic: Abelian 
functions. Kovalevsky’s responses are unavailable, 
because Weierstrass had burned them on hearing of 
her death. However, some idea of the importance of 
this correspondence to Kovalevsky can be found in 
her writings ([17], p. 218): “These studies had the 
deepest possible influence on my entire career in 
mathematics. They determined finally and irrevoca­
bly the direction I was to follow in my later scientific 
work: all my work has been done precisely in the spirit 
of Weierstrass.”
These letters also show the development of a close 
personal relationship between Kovalevsky and Weier- 
strass. They give a glimpse of the growing affection 
that Weierstrass felt for his pupil. Weierstrass was 
unaware of Kovalevsky’s marriage arrangement and 
did not understand Vladimir’s appearances. It was 
not until two years later (October 1872) that Weier- 
strass learned the truth. The series of letters at this 
time indicate that the topic of a relationship between 
Kovalevsky and Weierstrass was raised and the truth 
about her marital status was made known. Both were 
upset at the scene, and Weierstrass made several at­
tempts to reassure his pupil that he would thereafter 
only discuss science. For a short period the corre­
spondence remained strictly mathematical, but it did 
not stay that way. Weierstrass was not able to mask 
his concern and affection for Kovalevsky.
In October of 1872, Weierstrass had suggested sev­
eral possible topics for Kovalevsky’s dissertation. By 
1874, she had completed three original works, any 
one of which Weierstrass felt would be acceptable. 
Now he needed to find a university that would award 
Kovalevsky a degree. In July 1874, the University 
of Gottingen awarded Sofya Kovalevsky a Ph.D., in 
absentia, summa cum laude, without either orals or 
defense. Needless to say, this was an unprecedented 
event.
The three papers presented for the degree were:
1. On the Theory of Partial Differential Equations
2. On the Reduction of a Certain Class of Abelian 
Integrals of the Third Rank to Elliptic Integrals
3. Supplementary Remarks and Observations on 
Laplace’s Research on the Form of Saturn’s Rings
The first of the papers, on partial differential equa­
tions, was published in Crelle’s journal in 1875. This 
was considered a great honor, especially for a novice 
mathematician, since Crelle’s journal was considered 
the most serious mathematical publication in Ger­
many.
In the first paper, Kovalevsky had generalized a 
problem that had been posed by Cauchy. Cauchy had 
examined an existence theorem for partial differential 
equations, and Kovalevsky generalized Cauchy’s re­
sults to systems of order r containing time derivatives 
of order r. The mathematician H. Poincare said that 
([23], p. 234) “Kovalevsky significantly simplified the 
proof and gave the theorem its definitive form.” Today, 
this theorem on the existence and uniqueness of solu­
tions of partial differential equations is often, but not 
always, known as the Cauchy-Kovalevsky Theorem. 
While studying the partial differential equation prob­
lem, Kovalevsky examined the heat equation. Some of 
her results were helpful to Weierstrass and he wrote: 
“So you see, dear Sonya, that your observation (which 
seemed so simple to you) on the distinctive prop­
erty of partial differential equations . . . was for me 
the starting point for interesting and very elucidating 
researches.” ([23], p. 235)
Shortly after Sofya received her degree from 
Gottingen, her friend Yulya was awarded a degree 
in chemistry from Gottingen. Vladimir had received 
his degree in paleontology two years earlier.
Although she had earned her Ph.D. and had writ­
ten a highly acclaimed paper, Sofya Kovalevsky was 
unable to get a job. Even the efforts of her men­
tor, Weierstrass, were fruitless. So, in 1875, together 
with Vladimir, Anyuta, and Anyuta’s husband, So­
fya returned to the family home in Russia. Weier- 
strass ([27], p. 52) encouraged her to relax at home 
and “enjoy the pleasures of big city life. I know you 
won’t give up your scientific work.” However, Ko­
valevsky did not actively pursue her work that winter. 
She felt guilty and wrote ([17], p. 220): “I worked 

30
Analysis
far less zealously than I had done in Germany and, 
indeed, the situation was far less propitious for schol­
arly work... The only thing that still gave me schol­
arly support was the exchange of letters and ideas 
with my beloved teacher Weierstrass.” As important 
as this exchange may have been, the correspondence 
with Weierstrass stopped in 1875: It was resumed for 
a short time in 1878 but did not become regular until 
1880. Weierstrass was very hurt by this neglect. How­
ever, it must be acknowledged that Kovalevsky was 
never a good correspondent, even while in Germany, 
so that it is not surprising to find this lapse in writing 
after her return to Russia.
In Russia, Kovalevsky again tried to find a job. The 
only position in mathematics available to a woman 
was teaching arithmetic in the lower grades ofa girls’ 
school, and since Sofya admitted ([26], p. 147; cited 
in [24], p. 287) that she was “unfortunately weak in 
the multiplication table”, she could not seriously con­
sider such a position. Therefore, Kovalevsky turned to 
other intellectual pursuits. She wrote fiction, theater 
reviews, and popular-science reports for a newspa­
per. She was instrumental in the organization of the 
Bestuzhev School for Women, but because of what 
were considered her radical views she was not per­
mitted to teach there.
During this period in Russia, General Krukovsky 
died and left Sofya a small inheritance. Vladimir in­
vested this money in business enterprises that even­
tually went bankrupt.
By 1878, Sofya had become bored with her activ­
ities and wanted to return to mathematics. She wrote 
to Weierstrass for advice. Weierstrass was excited by 
this letter, the first he had received from his pupil in 
three years. However, Kovalevsky’s return to mathe­
matics was delayed by the birth of a daughter, Sofya 
Vladimirovna, in October 1878.
On their return to Russia the Kovalevskys had as­
sumed the obligations of a real marriage. This was 
done partly as an obligation to Sofya’s parents and 
partly because of their new politics. It was their feel­
ing to end lying relationships of all kinds, and so the 
marriage was finally consummated.
Kovalevsky’s return to mathematics was encour­
aged by a scientific conference held in Petersburg in 
1880. The Russian mathematician Chebyshev invited 
Kovalevsky to present a paper at this conference. She 
found her unpublished dissertation on Abelian Inte­
grals, translated it from German to Russian in one 
night, and presented it to the conference. Although it 
had lain untouched for six years, it was well received 
by the mathematicians.
Following her presentation, the Swedish mathe­
matician Gosta Mittag-Leffler, who had met Ko­
valevsky earlier while she was a student in Ger­
many, offered to find her a position in his country. 
Kovalevsky was very appreciative of this offer and 
wrote, in 1881, to Mittag-Leffler ([19], p. 51): “[If 
I can teach] I may in this way open the universities 
to women, which have hitherto only been open by 
special favor, a favor which can be denied at any mo­
ment.”
Kovalevsky’s desire for a position was spurred not 
only by her feminism but also by her need to do 
mathematics. She wished ([19], p. 52) “at the same 
time, to be able to live for my work, surrounded by 
those who are occupied with the same questions.”
While waiting for word from Sweden, Kovalevsky 
looked in Berlin for research work. While Vladimir 
was on a business trip, Sofya secretly visited Weier- 
strass. When she decided that she would return to 
Berlin to pursue research, Vladimir was quite angry 
with the decision and their marriage ended. For the 
next two years, Kovalevsky lived a student’s life in 
Berlin, and the care of her daughter was shared by 
Sofya’s friend Yulya and her brother-in-law Alexan­
der.
While Sofya Kovalevsky was busy conducting her 
research on the refraction of light in crystals, Vladimir 
Kovalevsky again managed to get himself into fi­
nancial difficulties. There was a stock scandal and 
Vladimir, faced with ruin, committed suicide in the 
spring of 1883. Sofya took solace in her mathematics 
and hoped to find a badly needed job in Stockholm.
Mittag-Leffler had recently been appointed the 
head of the mathematics department at the newly 
founded University of Stockholm and was able to 
offer Sofya a position there. However, the job had 
conditions. In order to prove her competence, Ko­
valevsky was to teach for a probationary year, with no 
pay and no official university affiliation. Kovalevsky 
agreed to this because she had no other options.
In the fall of 1883, Sofya Kovalevsky arrived in 
Stockholm to become a lecturer at the University 
of Stockholm. Her reception was mixed. Although 
hailed by many, others agreed with A. Strindberg 
([22], p. 50), who wrote in the local paper, “A fe­
male professor is a pernicious and unpleasant phe­
nomenon—even, one might say, a monstrosity.”
In the spring of 1884, Kovalevsky lectured in Ger­
man on partial differential equations. These lectures 
were well received, and Mittag-Leffler was able to 
obtain the funds for her appointment as a Profes­
sor of Higher Analysis in July 1884. Word of the

31
appointment was sent to Sofya in Moscow, where she 
was spending the summer with her daughter. How­
ever, Sofya did not bring her daughter to Stockholm 
in the fall because she was still unsure of her position. 
She was publicly criticized for her child-care arrange­
ments but chose to ignore this. She didn’t bring her 
daughter to Sweden until 1885, when the child was 
eight years old.
In addition to joining the Stockholm faculty in 
1884, Kovalevsky became an editor for Acta Math- 
ematica and published her first paper on crystals. In 
1885, she received a second appointment to the Chair 
of Mechanics. She also published a second paper on 
the propagation of light in crystals but was embar­
rassed when Volterra found a serious error in her 
work: she had used a multi-valued function as if it 
were a single-valued one. Since this research was 
performed after a three-year hiatus in her mathemat­
ical career, Kovalevsky felt that her teacher, Weier- 
strass, should have caught the error prior to publica­
tion. Weierstrass, quite distraught, blamed illness and 
overwork. (It might be added that Weierstrass was 70 
years old at the time.)
While in Stockholm, Sofya lived for a time in 
Mittag-Leffler’s home, where she met and developed 
a friendship with his sister, Anna Leffler. Anna Lef­
fler, a well-known advocate of women’s rights and a 
writer, encouraged Sofya’s literary leanings. In 1887 
they collaborated on a play entitled The Struggle for 
Happiness. It was based on an idea that had occurred 
to Sofya while she sat at the bedside of her dying 
sister.
After Anyuta died in the fall of 1887, Sofya felt 
lonely and despondent. The sisters had been close, 
and Sofya felt the loss deeply. However, at this time 
two events occurred that helped to assuage her grief. 
Both the announcement of a new competition for the 
Prix Bordin and the arrival in Stockholm of a Rus­
sian lawyer named Maxim Kovalevsky were to have 
profound effects on the life of Sofya Kovalevsky.
Early in 1888 the French Academy of Science an­
nounced a new competition for the Prix Bordin. Pa­
pers on the theory of the rotation of a solid body 
would be considered for the prize competition at the 
end of the summer. Gosta Mittag-Leffler encouraged 
Sofya to work on a paper for the competition.
While Sofya was engaged in her research on the 
paper, Maxim Kovalevsky arrived to give a series of 
lectures at Stockholm University. He had been dis­
missed from Moscow University for criticizing Rus­
sian constitutional law. Aside from politics, Sofya 
and Maxim had many interests in common, and their 
attraction resulted in a scandalous affair. Eventually 
Maxim proposed marriage, on the condition that So­
fya give up her research. Even if she had wished to 
give up her mathematics, Sofya was too far into her 
work for the prize competition to stop. In order to free 
Sofya to do her work, Mittag-Leffler invited Maxim to 
his summer home in Uppsala. This was a wise move, 
for, as Sofya stated ([10], p. 124), “If burly Maxim 
had stayed longer, I do not know how I should have 
got on with my work.”
With Maxim gone, Sofya was able to finish her 
work and the paper was submitted on time. Of the fif­
teen papers, which were submitted anonymously, one 
was considered so outstanding that the award was in­
creased from 3000 francs to 5000 francs. The Prix 
Bordin was awarded to Sofya Kovalevsky in Decem­
ber of 1888. Sofya attended the awards ceremony 
with Maxim. Special recognition was given to her 
work. In his congratulatory speech, the President of 
the Academy of Sciences said ([22], p. 61): “Our co­
members have found that her work bears witness not 
only to profound and broad knowledge, but to a mind 
of great inventiveness.”
Prior to Sofya Kovalevsky’s work the only solu­
tions to the motion of a rigid body about a fixed 
point had been developed for the two cases where 
the body is symmetric. In the first case, developed 
by Euler, there are no external forces, and the cen­
ter of mass is fixed within the body. This is the case 
that describes the motion of the earth. In the second 
case, derived by Lagrange, the fixed point and the 
center of gravity both lie on the axis of symmetry 
of the body. This case describes the motion of the 
top. Sofya Kovalevsky developed the first of the solv­
able special cases for an unsymmetrical top. In this 
case the center of mass is no longer on an axis in the 
body. She solved the problem by constructing coor­
dinates explicitly as ultra-elliptic functions of time. 
Kovalevsky continued this work in two more papers 
on a rigid body motion. These both received awards 
from the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1889. Her 
later works on the subject have been lost.
Kovalevsky’s professorship in Sweden was due to 
expire in 1889. Desirous of returning to her native 
country, she inquired about a position in Russia. Her 
request was flatly denied. Russian mathematicians 
were indignant at this slight of Kovalevsky and de­
cided to honor her. It was suggested that an honorary 
membership in the Russian Academy of Sciences 
would provide that recognition. However, in order 
to do that, the charter had to be amended to allow for 
female membership. In November 1889, Chebyshev 

32
Analysis
sent the following telegram to Kovalevsky ([16], 
p. 135; cited in [25]): “Our Academy of Sciences 
has just now elected you a corresponding member, 
having just permitted this innovation for which there 
has been no precedent until now. I am very happy to 
see this fulfillment of one of my most impassioned 
and justified desires.”
Kovalevsky sought positions throughout Europe 
but was again unsuccessful. She therefore had to ac­
cept the renewal of the professorship in Stockholm.
While working in Stockholm, Kovalevsky regu­
larly commuted to France, where she visited Maxim 
at his villa. During these visits Maxim encouraged her 
literary interests. She wrote Memories of Childhood 
in Russian. It was translated into Swedish and pub­
lished in 1889. In order not to shock Swedish society 
with its personal revelations, it was released as a novel 
entitled The Raevsky Sisters. The original was pub­
lished in Russian in 1890. Kovalevsky’s novel ANi- 
hilist Girl was written in Swedish in 1890. A Russian 
version had been started, but Sofya’s sudden death 
left it unfinished. Maxim edited the two versions and 
was responsible for the posthumous publication of 
the novel. This book was highly praised by critics in 
Russia and Scandinavia.
It was Kovalevsky’s frequent trips to France to visit 
Maxim that eventually caused her death. On returning 
to Stockholm from a visit, early in 1891, she fell 
ill. The illness was misdiagnosed, and by the time 
it was finally found to be pneumonia it was out of 
control. On February 10, 1891, Sofya Kovalevsky 
died. Although there was widespread mourning and 
eulogies were given around the world, the Russian 
Minister of the Interior, I. N. Durnovo, was concerned 
that too much attention was being paid to “a woman 
who was, in the last analysis, a Nihilist.” ([16], p. 532; 
cited in [25])
The mathematical world was more generous in its 
praise. Mittag-Leffler gave the official eulogy for the 
University of Stockholm. Speaking of her as a teacher 
he said ([20], p. 171): “We know with what inspiring 
zeal she explained [her] ideas . . . and how willingly 
she gave the riches of her knowledge.” In his eulogy, 
Kronecker, of the University of Berlin, spoke [18] of 
Kovalevsky as “one of the rarest investigators.” Karl 
Weierstrass, who felt her loss most deeply, having 
burned all of her letters, said [21] “ ‘People die, ideas 
endure’: it would be enough for the eminent figure of 
Sofya to pass into posterity on the lone virtue of her 
mathematical and literary work.”
In her short lifetime, Sofya Kovalevsky left a no­
table collection of political, literary, and mathema- 
ticakwo rfeiHirngconerObuCoOnsctCoonmPletehdoSnsppreinOefd 
many obstacles, certainly warrant her a place in our 
intellectual and mathematical history.
During her mathematical career Sofya Kovalevsky 
published ten papers in mathematics and mathemati­
cal physics. Three of these papers, [4], [6], [9] were 
written during her student days under Weierstrass 
(1870-1874). The articles on the refraction of light 
[5], [7], [8] were written years later in Berlin (1881­
1883) after her return to her mathematical researches. 
The remaining research on rigid body motion and 
Bruns’s Theorem [11-14] was completed during her 
tenure at the University of Stockholm (1883-1891). 
The only complete collection of Kovalevsky’s works 
is published in Russian [15]. Portions of her work in 
partial differential equations and rigid body motion 
appear in English, and since these are Kovalevsky’s 
most important works they will be discussed in some 
detail.
The proof of the first general existence theorem 
in partial differential equations was presented by 
Cauchy in 1842, in his publications on integrating 
differential equations with initial conditions. Here he 
showed the existence of analytic solutions for ordi­
nary differential equations and certain linear partial 
differential equations.
The Cauchy problem for the ordinary differential 
equation du/dt = f(t, u), with the initial conditions 
u = u0 and t = t0 states:
If f (t, u) is an analytic function in a neighbor­
hood of the point (t, u) there exists a unique 
solution of du/dt = f (t, u) with the given ini­
tial conditions.
For systems of first-order partial differential equa­
tions of the form

with initial conditions when t =0, that is,
ui(0,x1,...,xn)=wi(x1,...,xn)
for i =1,...,m, the Cauchy problem is to find a 
solution u(x, t) that satisfies the initial conditions 
([1], p. 318).
To solve this problem Cauchy assumed that Fi and 
wi were analytic. He obtained a locally convergent 
power series solution by using his “method of ma­
jorants.” The original function Fi is replaced by a 
simple analytic function whose power series expan­

the solution to the original with t =0.
In her thesis Kovalevsky generalized Cauchy’s re­
sults to systems of an order r containing time deriva­
tives, drui/dV', of order r. It is this generalization 
that is known as the Cauchy-Kovalevsky theorem.
Kovalevsky used majorants of the form
The work for which Kovalevsky was best known 
in her time was her research on the motion ofa rigid 
body about a fixed point. The equations of motion of 
a rigid body moving about a fixed point were derived 
by Euler in 1750. They are as follows:

t = t0 for the ui and their first ni - 1 derivatives 
with respect to t, Kovalevsky proved the following. If 
all the functions Fi are analytic in a neighborhood of 
the point
(t’ x1 ’...’xn ; ...’wj’k0 ’k1 ’...’kn)
(k)
and all the functions wj are analytic in a neighbor­
hood of the point (x1 ’...’ xn), then Cauchy’s problem 
has an analytic solution in a certain neighborhood of 
the point (t’ x1 ’...’xn), and itis the unique solution 
in the class of analytic functions. Note ([23], p. 233)

The simplest form of this theorem states that any 
equation of the form
du/dt = f (t’ X’ U’ du/dx),
where f is analytic in its arguments for values near 
(t0’X0’Uo’du0/dx0), possesses one and only one 
solution u(t’ x) which is analytic near (t0’x0).
The Cauchy-Kovalevsky Theorem has significant 
limitations. It is restricted to analytic functions, and 
convergence may fail in a region of interest. Also the 
computation of the coefficients of the series may be 
too tedious to be practical. However, itis important in 
that it shows that within a class of analytic solutions 
of analytic equations the number of arbitrary func­
tions needed for a general solution is the same as the 
order of the equation and these arbitrary functions in­
volve one less independent variable than the number

Here A’ B’ C are the principal axes of the ellipsoid 
of the body relative to the fixed point; M is the mass; 
g is the acceleration due to gravity; Y’ y' ’ y" are the 
direction cosines of the angles which the three axes 
make at each moment; their direction is the same as 
the force of the rigid body; p’ q’ r are the compo­
nents ofthe angular velocity along the principal axes; 
x0’y0’z0 are the coordinates of the center of gravity 
of the body considered in a system of coordinates of 
which the origin is the fixed point and whose direc­
tion coincides with that of the principal axes of the 
ellipsoid of inertia.
The problem to be solved was the integration of 
this system of equations so that the position of the 
moving body at any time could be obtained. Before 
1888, the integration had been completed for only 
two cases. The first was for the condition x0 = y0 = 
z0 =0. This case, studied by Euler and Poisson, is the 
one where the center of gravity of the moving body 
coincides with the fixed point. This is the motion of 
a force-free symmetric body. There are no external 
forces acting on the body and the motion is about a 
fixed point within the body, the center of mass. If the 
fixed point is the center of gravity, then gravity does 
not influence the motion. The axes of rotation are 
thus fixed in the body. An example of this force-free 
motion is the free rotation of the earth. In the case of 
the earth’s free rotation, the axis of rotation does not 
coincide with the axis of symmetry. Itis very slightly 
tilted, although it passes through the center of mass of 
the earth. What then happens is that the instantaneous 
axis precesses slowly about the axis of symmetry.
In the second case, studied by Lagrange, A = 
B’ x0 = y0 =0. Here the fixed point and the center 
onofwity liewhea WLOPx isALWWhen-tlGsaxis is the

axis of symmetry, the motion is that of the spinning 
top. “A top is defined to be a material body which is 
symmetrical about an axis and terminates in a sharp 
point... at one of the axes” ([28], p. 164). This top 
spins about a fixed point that is not the center of grav­
ity, but the center of gravity and the fixed point both 
lie on the axis of symmetry of the top. The weight 
of the top gives rise to a moment of force as it spins 
about the fixed point on the plane.
In both of these cases the rigid body was sym­
metrical. Sofya Kovalevsky developed the first of the 
soluble special cases for the heavy or unsymmetrical 
top. In this case, the center of mass no longer lies 
on the axis of the body. Instead, it is in the equato­
rial plane (the plane perpendicular to the axis) and 
passes through the fixed point. In addition, two of the 
principal moments of inertia are equal and double the 
third. The center of gravity is in the plane of the equal 
moments of inertia.
Euler’s equations containing six unknown func­
tions has the following first integrals:
Ap2 + Bq2 + Cr2
- 2 Mg (x 0 y + y 0 y' + z 0 y" ) = C1
ApY + BqY1 + CrY" = C2
y 2 + y' 2 + Y 2 = C3 = 1.
It is sufficient to find one more integral to obtain 
a complete solution in quadratures. This occurs be­
cause the time variable appears only in the form dt 
and can be eliminated, leaving only five equations.
Kovalevsky [12] derived the fourth integral for 
the case A = B =2C, z0 =0, and showed that the 
only conditions necessary for a given series to be 
a solution to Euler’s system are that the constants 
A, B, C, x, y, z satisfy one of four conditions:
1. A=B=C,
2. x0 = y0 = z0 = 0 (Euler’s case),
3. A = B, x0 = y0 = 0 (Lagrange’s case),
4. A = B =2C, z0 = 0 (Kovalevsky’s case [13]).
Kovalevsky obtained a solution for her case by ro­
tating the coordinate axes in the xy-plane and choos­
ing a unit of length so that y0 =0 and C =1. With 
c0 = Mgx0 the Euler equations become:

The three algebraic integrals are:

2 (PY + qY') + rY" = 21
Y 2+ Y' 2+ Y" 2 = 1,
where l and l1 are constants of integration.
Kovalevsky then derived a fourth integral:
[ (P + qi)2 + c0 (Y + iY1)
x [(p - qi)2 + C0 (y - Y'i) = k2, 
where k is an arbitrary constant. Defining x1 = P + 
qi, x2 = p - qi, she made several transformations of 
the variables. After some algebraic manipulations she 
obtained the equations:

where R1 (S) is a fifth-degree polynomial whose ze­
ros are unique and s1 and s2 are polynomials in x1 
and x2 . This system results in hyperelliptic integrals 
which Kovalevsky solved by using theta functions.
For this highly praised research Kovalevsky was 
awarded the Bordin Prize in 1888 and a prize from 
the Swedish Academy in 1889. Historians, however, 
have found this work “not of sufficient interest for 
the theory of a top to find a place here.” ([2], p. 369) 
Today the value of her work is seen not in the results 
or the originality of the method but in the interest it 
stimulated in the problem of the rotation of a rigid 
body. Several researchers have continued the work 
of finding new cases of special solutions. This in­
cludes Chaplygin’s development of the integral for a 
symmetrical top turning about a fixed point, with mo­
ments of inertia A = B =4C and the Hesse-Schiff 
equations of motion for a top. There is also a body of 
work by others (for example Bobylev, Steklov, Gory­
achev, and V. Kovalevsky).
The remaining works by Sofya Kovalevsky are of 
lesser importance and will be only briefly reviewed.
In the paper on Abelian integrals, Kovalevsky 
showed how a certain type of Abelian integral could 
be expressed as an elliptic integral.
The paper on Saturn’s rings is concerned with 
the stability of motion of liquid ring-shaped bodies. 
Laplace found the form of the ring to be a skewed 
cross-section of an ellipse. Kovalevsky, using a se­
ries expansion, proved that the rings were egg-shaped

subsequent proof that Saturn’s rings consist of dis­
crete particles and not a continuous liquid made this 
work inapplicable.
In the articles on the refraction of light in crystals, 
Kovalevsky applied a method developed by Weier- 
strass to differentiate Lame’s partial differential equa­
tions. However, Volterra discovered a basic error in 
her work. She had (as had Lame) treated a multi­
valued function as though it were single-valued, and 
the solution could not be applied to the equations 
in her form. However, the paper did demonstrate the 
previously unpublished theory of Weierstrass.
Kovalevsky’s last article derived a simpler proof of 
Bruns’s Theorem based on a property of the potential 
function of a homogeneous body.

Highlights in the History of Spectral Theory
L. A. STEEN
American Mathematical Monthly 80 (1973), 359-381
Not least because such different objects as atoms, 
operators and algebras all possess spectra, the evolu­
tion of spectral theory is one of the most informative 
chapters in the history of contemporary mathematics. 
The central thrust of the modern spectral theorem is 
that certain linear operators on infinite dimensional 
spaces can be represented in a “diagonal” form. At the 
beginning of the twentieth century neither this spec­
tral theorem nor the word “spectrum” itself had en­
tered the mathematician’s repertoire. Thus, although 
it has deep roots in the past, the mathematical the­
ory of spectra is a distinctly twentieth-century pheno­
menon.
Today every student of mathematics encounters the 
spectral theorem not later than his first course in func­
tional analysis and often as early as his first course 
in linear algebra. Usually he studies one specimen of 
the spectral theorem, plucked out of historical context 
and imbedded in the logical context of his particular 
course. Although this scheme is pedagogically effi­
cient and logically aesthetic, it does often obscure 
the fact that the spectral theorem was (and perhaps 
still is) an evolving species. Its evolution is an out­
standing example of the counterpoint between pure 
and applied mathematics, for while the motive force 
in its evolution was the attempt to provide adequate 
mathematical theories for various physical phenom­
ena, the forms through which it evolved are precisely 
those which have marked the development of modern 
abstract analysis.
So we offer here an austere outline of the evolution 
of the spectral theorem as a microcosmic example 
of the history of twentieth-century mathematics. To 
understand the significance of contemporary achieve­
ments and to recognize their continuity with the past, 
we begin with the principal historical roots of our 
subject.
1 
Principal axes theorem
The only theorem available at the turn of the twentieth 
century which we can with hindsight recognize as a 
direct forerunner of the modern spectral theorem is 
the principal axes theorem of analytical geometry. It 
should not be surprising that the simplest form of this 
theorem is contained in the writings of the founders 
of analytical geometry, Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) 
and Rene Descartes (1596-1650). For the Euclidean 
plane R2 , this theorem says that a quadratic form 
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 can be transformed by a rotation 
of the plane into the normal form ax2 + fry2, where 
the principal axes of the normal form coincide with 
the new coordinate axes. The essential content of this 
theorem—that the algebraic reduction to normal form 
corresponds to the geometric rotation onto princi­
pal axes—is contained in Descartes’ La Geometrie 
[1637], and was known at about the same time by 
Fermat but not published until after his death [1679]. 
The term “principal axes” was introduced by Leon­
hard Euler (1707-1783) in his investigation of the 
mechanics of rotating bodies [1765]; Euler also dis­
cussed (in [1748]) the reduction of quadratic forms 
in two and three dimensions.
The general form of the principal axes theorem as­
serts that any symmetric quadratic form (Ax, x)=
aij xi xj on Rn can be rewritten by means of an 
orthogonal transformation T : Rn ^ Rn in the nor­
mal form 52 \x2. (A is symmetric if aij = a.ji, and 
T is orthogonal if it leaves invariant the Euclidean 
metric on Rn .) The generalization from R3 to Rn of 
the algebraic part of this theorem (that a quadratic 
form can be written as a sum of squares) was dis­
cussed by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) in 
a paper [1759] on the maxima and minima of func­
tions of several variables. In [1827] Carl Gustav Jacob

Jacobi (1804-1851) investigated the principal axes 
of various quadratic surfaces, and about the same 
time Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1867) showed in 
[1829] and [1830] that the coefficients Xi of the nor­
mal form of a symmetric quadratic form must be 
real.
But it was not until the second half of the nine­
teenth century that the general form of the princi­
pal axes theorem was achieved when James Joseph 
Sylvester (1814-1897) and Arthur Cayley (1821­
1895) used the notation of matrices to systematize 
the algebraic description of n-dimensional space. In 
[1852] Sylvester showed explicitly that the coeffi­
cients Xi in the normal form of (Ax, x) are the roots 
of the characteristic polynomial det(XI - A)=0; 
in [1858] Cayley inaugurated the calculus of matri­
ces, in which the reduction to normal form corre­
sponded to a diagonalization process on the matrix 
A. Specifically, the principal axes theorem says in the 
language of matrices that each symmetric real matrix 
A is orthogonally equivalent to a diagonal matrix D; 
in other words, for some orthogonal matrix T ,the 
matrix D = T-1AT is in diagonal form. The diago­
nal entries of D are the eigenvalues of A—that is, the 
roots of the polynomial equation det(XI - A)=0.
Although the new concepts of matrix theory had an 
immediate and profound influence on British math­
ematics, their impact on the continent was relatively 
minor. Especially in Germany bilinear forms contin­
ued well into the twentieth century to be the princi­
pal tool of analytical geometry, and in [1878] Georg 
Frobenius (1849-1917) published a systematic ac­
count of matrix algebra entirely in the language of 
bilinear forms. So by the end of the nineteenth cen­
tury we can discern two versions of the principal axes 
theorem: the reduction to normal form of a symmet­
ric bilinear form, and the diagonalization of a real 
symmetric matrix.
2 
Infinite systems of linear 
equations
The central fact of modern spectral theory is that cer­
tain linear operators on infinite-dimensional spaces 
can also be presented in “diagonal” form. Thus the 
second historical taproot of spectral theory is the 
evolution of infinite-dimensional theory from finite­
dimensional cases. This evolution occurred first in 
algebra—in the solution of systems of linear equa- 
tions—and only much later in geometry. Finite 
systems of linear equations were solved most of­
ten throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth cen­
turies by the method of elimination, as expounded, 
for instance, in [1770] and [1779] by Euler and Eti­
enne Bezout (1730-1783). In [1750] Gabriel Cramer 
(1704-1752) introduced for 3 x 3 systems the rule 
which now bears his name, although he did not, of 
course, use the concept or notation of determinants.
Infinite systems of equations were used throughout 
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to obtain for­
mal solutions to differential equations by the method 
of undetermined coefficients: if a formal power se­
ries with unknown coefficients is substituted for the 
unknown in a given differential equation, the task of 
solving the differential equation is reduced to that 
of determining the infinitely many unknown coef­
ficients. (Of course, few at that time worried very 
much about the convergence of the power series thus 
obtained.) If all went well, the infinite system of equa­
tions in the unknown coefficients would exhibit a re­
cursive pattern which made it possible to solve the 
infinite system by finite-dimensional tools. But for 
this reason precisely, these recursive techniques con­
tributed little to the development of a general theory 
of infinite-dimensional systems.
Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) launched the first sig­
nificant general attack on the problem of infinite sys­
tems of equations when he attempted to show [1822] 
that every function can be expressed as an infinite lin­
ear combination of trigonometric terms. The problem 
of determining the unknown coefficients in these lin­
ear combinations led him directly to the general prob­
lem of solving an infinite system of linear equations. 
Fourier’s approach (called the principe des reduites 
by Frederic Riesz [1913a]) wasto solve the first n x n 
system by ordinary means and let n ^ <x.
Although Fourier’s assertion about the expansion 
of “arbitrary” functions into trigonometric series 
stimulated intense work on the theory of integra­
tion, his method of solving infinite systems of lin­
ear equations was virtually ignored. More than fifty 
years passed before Theodor Kotteritzsch of Sax­
ony reopened the investigation with a paper [1870] 
in which he attempted to extend Cramer’s rule 
to infinite systems. Seven years later the Ameri­
can astronomer George William Hill (1838-1914) 
published in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a mono­
graph [1877b] in which he successfully applied to 
the infinite-dimensional case the theory of determi­
nants which had at that time only been established 
for finite-dimensional systems. Hill’s work was first 

38
Analysis
disseminated in Europe in [1886a] when G. Mittag- 
Leffler reprinted it in Acta Mathematica in the year 
following the appearance in France of a paper [1885a] 
by Paul Appell (1855-1930) in which he applied 
the principe des reduites to determine the coeffi­
cients of the power series expansion of elliptic func­
tions.
At this point Henri Poincare (1854-1912) entered 
the discussion with two papers ([1885b], [1886b]) in 
which he provided a rigorous definition for an infinite 
determinant in order to clarify the works of Hill and 
Appell. The work begun in Paris by Poincare was con­
tinued in Stockholm by Helge von Koch (1870-1924) 
who developed between 1890 and 1910 an extensive 
theory of infinite determinants. Von Koch’s first major 
papers on this subject appeared in [1891] and [1892]; 
his own survey of the field in [1910d] provides fur­
ther references. The more recent survey [1968] by 
Michael Bernkopf includes a complete discussion of 
these fundamental papers.

Integral equations
The theory of infinite matrices and determinants 
might have led directly to an elementary spectral the­
orem if someone had generalized the diagonalization 
form of the principal axes theorem. But the road to 
spectral theory was not that straight: the first spectral 
theorem was achieved only after infinite determinants 
were applied to integral equations, thereby extend­
ing the theory from the countably to the uncountably 
infinite. The formal study of integral equations is 
usually traced back to [1823] and [1826] when the 
young Norwegian genius Niels Henrik Abel (1802­
1829) used an integral equation to solve a generalized 
tautochrone problem concerning the shape of a wire 
along which a frictionless bead slides under the in­
fluence of gravity. Somewhat later Joseph Liouville 
(1809-1882) introduced (in [1837]) the method of it­
eration to solve a specific type of integral equation; in 
[1877a] Carl Neumann (1832-1925) extended Liou- 
ville’s iterative method to a more general setting while 
investigating a boundary value problem for harmonic 
functions.
Neumann’s work precipitated considerable re­
search in integral equations, especially by Poincare in 
France and in Rome by Vito Volterra (1860-1940). 
But it was not until 1900 that the theory of integral 
equations became especially relevant to the history 
of spectral theory, for in that year the Swedish math­
ematician Ivar Fredholm (1866-1927), then a docent 
at the University of Stockholm, applied to integral 
equations the theory of infinite matrices and deter­
minants as developed by his colleague von Koch. By 
mimicking von Koch’s technique for expanding infi­
nite determinants, Fredholm developed in [1900] his 
now famous “alternative” theorem concerning the so­
lutions ^ of the integral equation
$(x) + y K(x, y) $(y) dy = $ (x), 
0 < x < 1.

Just as Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1784) nearly two 
centuries earlier had represented the vibrating string 
as the limit of n oscillating particles [1732], so Fred­
holm considered the integral equation (1) to be the 
limiting case of the corresponding linear system
n
$(xi) + 
K(xi,yj)$(yj) = $(xi), 
1 < i < n.
j=1

Fredholm defined a “determinant” DK for the in­
tegral equation (1) which is the continuous analog 
of the classical determinant of the n x n system (2) 
and showed—in exact analogy to the classical theory 
for (2)—that the integral equation (1) has a unique 
solution which can be expressed as the quotient of 
two “determinants” whenever DK =0; or alterna­
tively, if DK =0, then the transposed homogeneous 
equation
^(x) + / k(y,x)^(y) dy = 0
has non-trivial solutions and (1) is solvable if and 
only if ^ is orthogonal to each of these solutions. 
Fredholm’s major paper on this subject appeared in 
[1903a]; a summary of this work together with later 
developments is the substance of his survey article 
[1910e].

David Hilbert
Although there is very little in the papers of ei­
ther von Koch or Fredholm that could be construed 
as a logical ancestor of the modern spectral theo­
rem, we have discussed these developments for two 
particular reasons—one mathematical, the other his­
torical. The twentieth-century evolution of infinite­
dimensional spectral theory from the much simpler 
finite-dimensional theory is foreshadowed by the 
nineteenth-century development of linear equation 
and determinant theory, from the finite to the infinite 
(von Koch) to the continuous (Fredholm). But there is 
even a more direct connection, for when Fredholm’s

ideas were introduced (by Fredholm’s colleague Eric 
Holmgren) in David Hilbert’s 1900-01 seminar at 
Gottingen, Hilbert, in the words of Hermann Weyl 
[1944], “caught fire at once”. For the next ten years 
Hilbert (1862-1943) focused his impressive mathe­
matical talent exclusively on integral equations, and 
through a series of six papers published in Gottingen 
Nachrichten from 1904 to 1910 (collected and pub­
lished as one volume in [1912a]) he outlined the basic 
definitions and theorems of spectral theory (which he 
named) and Hilbert space theory (which he did not 
name, or even define directly).
Hilbert worked primarily with the integral equation
0(x)- a/ k(x,y)0(y) dy=0(x)
(3)
together with the analogous finite- or infinite­
dimensional matrix equation
E
0 (Xi) - A
K(xi,yj) 0(yj) = 0(xi) •
(4)
In the process of constructing the machinery nec­
essary to solve these equations, Hilbert defined the 
spectrum of the quadratic form K, distinguished the 
point spectrum from the continuous spectrum, and de­
fined the concept of complete continuity which served 
to separate those forms that had pure point spectra 
from those with more complicated spectra. But most 
important from the viewpoint of this essay, he formu­
lated and proved the spectral theorem—not only for 
completely continuous forms, but for bounded forms 
as well.
Hilbert’s papers on integral equations contain an 
astonishing quantity of what we now recognize as 
modern analysis in classical language. Because he 
was primarily concerned with solving integral equa­
tions, Hilbert never applied his results specifically to 
matrices or operators; furthermore, because of the 
position of the parameter A in equation (3), all of 
Hilbert’s eigenvalues and spectral points are recip­
rocals of those in use today. And while his theo­
rems had a most modern thrust, his basic method of 
proof was that of Bernoulli and Fredholm—a labori­
ous passage to the limit from the corresponding finite 
case.
Beginning in 1905 with his doctoral dissertation 
under Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt (1876-1959) gener­
alized and simplified Hilbert’s work by introducing 
the suggestive language of Euclidean geometry. In 
[1907a], [1907b] and [1908a] Schmidt presented a 
definitive theory of “Hilbert’s space”—what we now 
call f2, the space of square-summable sequences— 
replete with the language of norms, linearity, sub­
spaces and orthogonal projections. (It was Schmidt 
who generalized to t2 the iterative algorithm for or­
thonormalization first introduced in [1883] by Jorgen 
Pederson Gram of Copenhagen.) Schmidt’s concep­
tual simplifications were immediately incorporated 
by Ernst Hellinger (1883-1950) and Hermann Weyl 
(1885-1955) in their 1907 and 1908 dissertations un­
der Hilbert. In [1909a] Hellinger reformulated the 
theory of quadratic forms in the new language of 
Hilbert and Schmidt, and in the same year Weyl 
published an extensive study of bounded forms and 
their spectra [1909d]. So by the end of the first 
decade of the twentieth century we can perceive in 
the writings of Hilbert and his pupils the major part 
of spectral theory for bounded linear transforma­
tion on t2.

Hilbert-Schmidt spectral 
theory
Recall, as did Hilbert at the beginning of his first 
paper on integral equations [1904a], the principal 
axes theorem for finite-dimensional spaces. Let A 1 < 
A2 <••• < An be the n (real) eigenvalues of the 
symmetric n x n matrix K, listed according to mul­
tiplicity. Let 0 1, • • •, 0n be an orthonormal collec­
tion of corresponding eigenvectors, so K0i = Ai0i, 
for 1 < i < n. Then the action of K is represented, 
with respect to the basis, by the diagonal matrix L 
with entries Ai on the main diagonal. The matrix T 
whose rows are the vectors 0 1, • • •, 0n is an orthogo­
nal transformation which maps the new basis vectors 
0 1, • • • ,0n back to the original (canonical) basis vec­
tors. Thus L = T-1KT is the diagonalization of K 
by the orthogonal transformation T. The matrix L can 
be written as in=1 AiPi , where Pi is the projection 
(i.e., the transformation which projects Rn onto the 
one-dimensional subspace spanned by 0i).
Hilbert’s first step in extending this theorem was 
to generalize the concept of eigenvalue to the case 
of an infinite symmetric form K. His new concept 
was the spectrum of K, denoted by a(K), which is 
the set of A for which the transformation AI - K is 
not invertible. (Actually, Hilbert used I - AK while 
Schmidt used AI - K.) The subset of a (K) con­
sisting of those A for which the equation K0 = A0 
has non-trivial solutions is called the point spectrum 
of K; this is the strict analog of the set of eigen­
values. The complement of the point spectrum in 
a(K) is called the continuous spectrum. Much of 

40
Analysis
Hilbert’s fourth paper [1906a] is devoted to a study of 
the relationships between a transformation K and its 
spectrum a (K).
One of the simplest relationships Hilbert discov­
ered was that the spectrum of K is a bounded set 
whenever K is a bounded transformation—that is, 
whenever the set
S = HKx! : ||x||< 1}
is bounded, where the notation || ||, due to Schmidt, 
is the t2 norm. In fact, whenever K is symmet­
ric, the least upper bound of S, called the bound 
(or norm) of K and denoted by \\K||, is the same 
as the least upper bound of {|A| : A e a(K)}; this 
fact is now called the spectral radius theorem. The 
bounded linear transformations on t2 are important 
from another point of view, also due to Hilbert: they 
are precisely the continuous linear transformations, 
in the sense that they preserve strong convergence 
(i.e., \\Kxn - Kx\\ ^ 0 whenever ||xn - x|| ^ 0).
Hilbert extended the principal axes theorem to 
symmetric bounded linear transformations; the spec­
tra of these transformations are bounded subsets of 
the real axis. Those A in the point spectrum p(K) 
ofK are like eigenvalues, since there exists an or­
thonormal collection of corresponding eigenvectors 
oA satisfying KoA = Aoa . If PA denotes the pro­
jection onto the subspace generated by oA, we can 
form the diagonal transformation L = APA where 
A ranges over the point spectrum p(K). The trans­
formation L reflects accurately the action ofK on 
the subspace generated by the eigenvectors oA, but 
since this subspace will in general be strictly smaller 
than f2 —since we have omitted the continuous spec- 
trum—we cannot say that L andK represent the same 
transformation.
To express the contribution of the continuous spec­
trum, Hilbert set up an integral patterned after one de­
fined in [1894] by the Dutch mathematician Thomas- 
Jean Stieltjes (1856-1894). In his study of continued 
fractions, Stieltjes was led (via the problem of mo­
ments) to the integral ab f (x)dg(x) as the limit of 
the sum
f(&.))[g(xi) - g(xi-i)]
(for continuous f and increasing g). By rewriting the 
sum £ AiPAi as
Ai EAAi - EAi - J ,
where EAi = ij=1 PAj , Hilbert constructed for the 
continuous spectrum s(K) the Stieltjes-type integral
AdEA
s(K)
as the limit of sums of the form Ai EAi - EAi-1 . 
Then Hilbert’s spectral theorem was that every sym­
metric bounded linear transformation on t2 can be 
represented (by means of an orthogonal transforma­
tion) in the “diagonal” form
p APa + js(K}AdEA, 
(5)
where the summation is over the point spectrum, and 
the integral is over the continuous spectrum.
Hilbert completed his spectral theory by identify­
ing a large class of transformations whose continuous 
spectra were empty. He called these transformations 
completely continuous, and Schmidt characterized 
them by the property of mapping weakly convergent 
sequences to strongly convergent sequences. In other 
words, the linear transformation K is completely con­
tinuous if
\\Kxn — Kx^ ^ 0
whenever (y, xn) ^ (y, x) for all y. The completely 
continuous transformations are the nearest infinite­
dimensional analogs to the finite-dimensional trans­
formations, since their spectra consist entirely of 
eigenvalues with zero as the only possible accumula­
tion point; furthermore, every completely continuous 
symmetric linear transformation K can be expressed 
(by an orthogonal transformation) in the diagonal 
form APa (since s (K) = 0).
Although Hilbert originally used infinite matri­
ces merely as convenient approximations to integral 
equations, he concluded his theoretical investigation 
by establishing a major link between these two the­
ories, namely that of a complete orthogonal system. 
Such a system {on }, either of vectors in the sequence 
space 2 or of continuous functions on the interval 
[0, 1], is characterized by the orthogonality relation 
(on.om) =0 if n = m, together with the fact that 
every vector (or continuous function) ^ can be rep­
resented by the Fourier-type series ^ 
Xi "n°n.
The matrix equation (4) can then be derived (by math­
ematics, rather than by analogy) from the integral 
equation (3) by replacing each continuous function 
^, ^ by its Fourier expansion with respect to the com­
plete orthogonal system {on }. This application of a 
complete orthogonal system enabled Hilbert to derive 

STEEN: Highlights in the History of Spectral Theory
41
Fredholm’s alternative theorem for the integral equa­
tion (1) directly from the corresponding theorem for 
the infinite linear system (2).
To keep the record straight, we should emphasize 
again that Hilbert introduced spectral theory in the 
language of quadratic forms, whereas we have re­
ported his work primarily in the language of linear 
transformations on the infinite-dimensional space t2. 
Barely fifty years had elapsed since Cayley in England 
and Hermann Grassman (1809-1877) in Germany 
had begun, in [1843] and [1844], the systematic study 
of Euclidean n-dimensional space for n> 3. Hilbert 
and Schmidt were the first to explore the totally un­
known depths of an infinite-dimensional space and 
it was not until other such spaces were studied that 
the broad outlines of a theory of linear transforma­
tions became clear. The early twentieth-century de­
velopment of infinite-dimensional (function) spaces 
is recorded in [1966].
6 
The Lebesgue integral
At about the same time as Hilbert was creating 
his spectral theory for spaces of square summable 
sequences, Henri Lebesgue (1875-1941) was de­
veloping the new integral which now bears his 
name ([1901], [1904c]). In three brief papers in 
1907 Friedrich Riesz (1880-1956) and Ernst Fischer 
(1875-1959) joined together the works of Hilbert 
and Lebesgue by showing that Hilbert’s space f2 
is isomorphic to the space L2 of functions whose 
square is Lebesgue integrable. In a subsequent paper 
[1910c] (in which he introduced the more general Lp 
spaces), Riesz derived a spectral theory for L2 entirely 
analogous to that developed for f2 by Hilbert and 
Schmidt.
In the year preceding the appearance of his paper on 
Lp spaces, Riesz proved in [1909b] his now famous 
representation theorem in which he solved a problem 
first studied in [1903b] by Jacques Hadamard (1865­
1963). What Riesz showed was that every continuous 
linear functional on C([a,b]) is a Stieltjes integral 
fdg with respect to some function g of bounded 
variation. Lebesgue then showed in [1910f], in direct 
response to Riesz’s paper, that every Stieltjes integral 
can be interpreted as a Lebesgue integral under a 
proper interpretation of the heuristic formula 
f f (x) dg(x) 
y f (x)g'(x) dx.
This led Johann Radon (1887-1956) to develop (in 
[1913b]) integration with respect to a measure (i.e., a 
countably additive set function), thus encompassing 
the integrals of both Lebesgue and Stieltjes and pro­
viding the foundation for all modern theories of the 
abstract integral.
We can see from this digression that the evolu­
tion of the modern integral was closely connected to 
Hilbert’s creation of spectral theory. Although neither 
theory depended logically on the other, the histori­
cal dependence of each on the other is quite clear: 
Hilbert used Stieltjes’ integral to obtain the spectral 
theorem for £2, while Riesz, following Hilbert, used 
and thereby immortalized Lebesgue’s integral by de­
veloping the spectral theory ofL2 .
The second decade of spectral theory was rather 
uneventful. In Gottingen, Hilbert had turned his atten­
tion to the axiomatization of physics, a task which he 
had proposed to the International Congress of Mathe­
maticians in 1900 as the sixth of his famous 23 prob­
lems for twentieth-century mathematics. “Physics,” 
he said, “is much too hard for physicists” ([1970]). 
In the United States Eliakim Hastings Moore (1862­
1932) at the University of Chicago developed a sys­
tem of “general analysis” ([1908b], [1912b]), which 
was designed to include as special cases the work 
of Hilbert, Fredholm, and Riesz. But Moore’s results 
were constrained by the fact that European investi­
gators were not then accustomed to receiving new 
mathematical ideas from America. So while Moore’s 
research had a profound effect on the development 
of mathematics in the United States, it did not influ­
ence significantly the direction of research on spectral 
theory.
Many European efforts from 1910 to 1925 were de­
voted to exposition and recapitulation. Riesz [1913a], 
Fredholm [1910c], and von Koch [1910d] published 
surveys of the theory of infinitely many variables and 
integral equations, each of which contained various 
forms of Hilbert’s spectral theory. Hilbert’s collected 
papers on integral equations were themselves pub­
lished in book form in [1912a]. But certainly the most 
impressive survey work of this period was the massive 
Enzyklopadie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften 
which contains in volume II.3.2 a comprehensive dis­
cussion of integral equations and spectral theory by 
Hellinger and Otto Toeplitz (1881-1940); this survey 
paper was also published separately [1928a].
7 
Quantum mechanics
In Gottingen in 1925-26 Werner Heisenberg (1901­
1976) and Erwin Schrodinger (1887-1961) created 
the theory of quantum mechanics. In Heisenberg’s 

42
Analysis
theory the physical fact that certain atomic ob­
servations cannot be made simultaneously was in­
terpreted mathematically to mean that the opera­
tions which represented these observations were not 
commutative. Since the algebra of matrices is non- 
commutative, Heisenberg together with Max Born 
and Pascual Jordan ([1925a], [1926a]) represented 
each physical quantity by an appropriate (finite or infi­
nite) matrix, called a transformation; the set of possi­
ble values of the physical quantity was the spectrum of 
the transformation. (So the spectrum of the transfor­
mation which represented the energy of an atom was 
precisely the spectrum of the atom.) Schrodinger, in 
contrast, advanced a less unorthodox theory based on 
his partial differential wave equation. Following some 
initial surprise that Schrodinger’s “wave mechanics” 
and Heisenberg’s “matrix mechanics”—two theories 
with substantially different hypotheses—should yield 
the same results, Schrodinger unified the two ap­
proaches by showing, in effect, that the eigenvalues 
(or more generally, the spectrum) of the differential 
operator in Schrodinger’s wave equation determine 
the corresponding Heisenberg matrix. Similar results 
were obtained simultaneously ([1925b], [1926b]) by 
the British physicist Paul A. M. Dirac (1902-1984). 
Thus interest in spectral theory once again became 
quite intense.
Hilbert himself was astonished that the spectra of 
his quadratic forms should come to be interpreted as 
atomic spectra. “I developed my theory of infinitely 
many variables from purely mathematical interests, 
and even called it ‘spectral analysis’ without any pre­
sentiment that it would later find an application to 
the actual spectrum of physics” [1970]. It quickly 
became clear, however, that Hilbert’s spectral the­
ory was the proper mathematical basis for the new 
mechanics. Finite and infinite matrices were inter­
preted as transformations on a Hilbert space (still 
thought of primarily as t2 or L2) and physical quan­
tities were represented by these transformations. The 
mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics be­
came that of spectral analysis and the renewed activity 
precipitated the publication by Aurel Wintner (1903­
1958) of the first book [1929b] devoted to spectral 
theory.
Hilbert’s original spectral theorem applied to 
real quadratic forms (or infinite matrices) that 
were bounded and symmetric. This theorem was 
quickly and easily extended (by Schmidt and oth­
ers) to bounded complex matrices A = (aij) for 
which aij = aji; such matrices are called Hermi­
tian after the French mathematician Charles Hermite 
(1822-1901) who introduced them (in [1855]) and 
proved their eigenvalues real. Both symmetric and 
Hermitian forms may be characterized in terms 
of their respective inner product by the relation 
(Ax, y)=(x, Ay) for all x, y. Like symmetric matri­
ces, Hermitian transformations have real spectra and, 
more generally, play the role of the real number line 
in the algebra of transformations.
Almost miraculously, it was precisely the Hermi­
tian transformations which qualified in the new me­
chanics to represent a physical quantity. One reason 
for this is that physical quantities are measured by 
real numbers, so it is natural to represent them by 
those transformations which behave like real num­
bers. Perhaps a more compelling justification is that 
the hypothesis that the transformations of mathemati­
cal physics are Hermitian implies certain fundamental 
laws (or assumptions) of physics: if A is Hermitian, 
the wave equation o = Ao implies the conservation 
of energy, a fundamental law of classical mechanics, 
and the solutions of Schrodinger’s equation = = iAO 
will have constant norm, which is a fundamental as­
sumption of quantum mechanics.
Although every observable was represented in the 
new mechanics by a Hermitian transformation, it was 
not necessarily true that every such transformation 
represented an observable. Dirac [1930b] added the 
crucial hypothesis that a Hermitian transformation 
represents an observable if and only if its eigenvectors 
form a complete (orthogonal) system: his hypothesis 
was designed to insure that any vector (represent­
ing a quantum-mechanical state) could be expressed 
as a (possibly infinite) linear combination of eigen­
vectors of any given observable. The identification 
of transformations with this property is part of the 
Hilbert-Schmidt spectral theory, but this theory pro­
vided only a partial answer: those Hermitian trans­
formations which are completely continuous have a 
complete set of eigenvalues.
This theorem did not provide a satisfactory 
elucidation of Dirac’s hypotheses since the trans­
formations of quantum mechanics are usually not 
completely continuous. Most of the important trans­
formations in physics involve differentiation of, say, 
functions in L2 . The theorem on integration by parts 
shows that differentiation is formally symmetric, for 
in this case (Af, g) = (f, Ag) means f f 'g = f fg'. 
But since the derivative of a function has practically 
no relation to the magnitude of the function, dif­
ferentiation is neither continuous nor bounded, nor 
even defined everywhere. In fact, if a symmetric or 
Hermitian transformation (like differentiation) were 

STEEN: Highlights in the History of Spectral Theory
43
defined everywhere, it would have to be bounded. 
This rather surprising result—which says, in effect, 
that a candidate for the spectral theorem which fails 
to be bounded must fail to be everywhere defined— 
was demonstrated as early as [1910b] by Hellinger 
and Toeplitz.
Thus many of the transformations of quantum me­
chanics, although Hermitian, failed nevertheless to 
satisfy the second of Hilbert’s hypotheses—namely, 
that they be bounded. Like differentiation, they were 
unbounded and defined only on a dense subset of L2. 
Paul Dirac attempted to overcome the exceptional be­
havior of differentiation by introducing his 5-function 
to provide derivatives where none existed and thereby 
to enlarge the set of functions to which the differen­
tiation transformation could be applied. Dirac’s ap­
proach was highly successful in explaining the new 
quantum mechanics and led eventually to Laurent 
Schwartz’s theory of distributions, precisely because 
it lacked an adequate mathematical foundation. But 
in 1926 Dirac’s approach represented more an alter­
native to spectral theory than an extension of it, and 
it did not really help to extend Hilbert’s theory to 
unbounded transformations.
8 
John von Neumann
After Hilbert, the only major study of unbounded 
transformations was that published in [1923] by 
Torsten Carleman (1892-1949) in Sweden. In this 
monograph Carleman showed that many of the results 
of Fredholm and Hilbert still hold under a weaker 
type of boundedness hypothesis. But from the view­
point of spectral theory, the major breakthrough came 
in 1927-29 when the 25-year-old Hungarian John 
von Neumann (1903-1957) revolutionized the study 
of spectral theory by introducing the abstract con­
cept of a linear operator on Hilbert space. In [1927] 
von Neumann expressed the transformation theory 
of quantum mechanics in terms of operators on a 
Hilbert space, and explicitly recognized the need to 
extend from the bounded to the unbounded case the 
spectral theory of Hermitian operators. In [1929a] he 
carried out that extension.
Before von Neumann, the name “Hilbert space” 
had been applied principally to the space 2 of square- 
summable sequences (often called “Hilbert’s space”) 
or to the space L2 of Lebesgue square-integrable 
functions which Riesz had proved isomorphic to 
2. The essential properties of these spaces, widely 
recognized, were those of a vector space with an 
inner product which was complete and separable 
(i.e., which had a countable dense subset). Von Neu­
mann’s first step in his theory of linear operators was 
to define an (abstract) Hilbert space axiomatically 
as any separable complete inner product space. He 
then defined a general linear operator on the abstract 
Hilbert space H as a linear transformation defined on 
some subset of H. This subset, called the domain DT 
of the operator T , is usually assumed to be a linear 
subspace of H which, like the domain of the dif­
ferentiation operator, is dense in H . Von Neumann’s 
linear operators thus comprehend both the matrices 
and quadratic forms of Hilbert’s theory, and the trans­
formations of quantum mechanics.
A linear operator is continuous if and only if it is 
bounded, and a bounded linear operator with a dense 
domain can be uniquely extended to a bounded linear 
operator on the whole space H . Every linear operator 
T with a dense domain has a unique adjoint operator 
T* defined by the relation
(Tx,y ) = ( x,T *y) 
(6)
for all x e DT; the domain of T* is the set of y e H 
for which (6) holds for all x. An operator T is called 
self-adjoint if T = T*, and symmetric if T* is an 
extension ofT, or equivalently, if (Tx,y) = (x, Ty) 
whenever x, y e DT . (In von Neumann’s papers, the 
self-adjoint operators were called hypermaximal.)
Every self-adjoint operator is clearly symmetric, 
and every symmetric operator which is everywhere 
defined must be self-adjoint. Thus for bounded lin­
ear operators (which either are everywhere defined 
or may be extended to become so) the concept of 
symmetric and self-adjoint coincide. The Hellinger- 
Toeplitz theorem, cited in Section 7 above, can be 
extended to von Neumann’s operators and shows that 
any symmetric operator which is everywhere defined 
must be bounded. (This result is closely related to a 
more general theorem due to Stefan Banach (1892­
1945), now commonly known as the closed graph the­
orem [1932b].) Thus in von Neumann’s theory there 
are precisely three types of symmetric operators:
I bounded, self-adjoint and everywhere defined;
II unbounded, self-adjoint and densely but not every­
where defined;
III unbounded, not self-adjoint, and densely but not 
everywhere defined.
Hilbert’s original theory applied to operators of 
type I, while von Neumann’s spectral theorem encom­
passed those of type II as well since it applies to all 
self-adjoint operators. This theory, though initiated 

44
Analysis
by von Neumann, was developed by Riesz [1930c] 
and more extensively, by Marshall H. Stone (1903­
1989) at Yale University who expounded it in great 
detail in [1932a]. The combined (but largely indepen­
dent) efforts of von Neumann and Stone for the five- 
year period 1927-1932 provided for spectral theory 
the largest collection of new methods since Hilbert’s 
five-year effort of 1901-1906.
9 Von Neumann-Stone spectral 
theory
Hilbert’s general spectral theorem says that every 
bounded symmetric linear transformation T can be 
written in the form
XPX + /s( ^dE*.
By rewriting the first sum as a Stieltjes-type integral 
and combining it with the second integral, we may 
express Hilbert’s spectral theorem in the concise form
T = 
* dE*, 
(7)
where the integral is over the entire (bounded) spec­
trum of T. The operators E* are projections with the 
following properties:
(i) if X < p., the range of EX is contained in the 
range of E.;
(ii) if £ > 0, EX+£ ^ EX as £ ^ 0;
(iii) EX ^ 0 as X ^ -<x>;
(iv) EX ^ I as X ^ to .
Stone called such a family of operators a resolution 
of the identity; in more intuitive language, properties 
(i)-(iv) require that the function X ^ EX be increas­
ing, continuous from the right, with 0 and I as left 
and right limiting values.
The von Neumann-Stone extension of the spectral 
theorem for self-adjoint operators from the bounded 
to the unbounded case corresponds to the extension of 
(7) from bounded to unbounded spectra a (T). Specif­
ically, it says that to each self- adjoint operator T there 
corresponds a unique resolution of the identity {EX} 
such that (7) holds.
Despite the power of this theorem, many differ­
ential operators are not covered by it since they are 
rarely self-adjoint. For instance, to make the opera­
tor D = d/dt symmetric on a dense subset A of the 
Hilbert space L2(0, 1), we should select for A the 
subset consisting of those continuously differentiable 
functions f which satisfy f(0) = f(1) = 0 (in order 
to insure that the relation (Df, g)=(f, Dg) would 
follow by integration by parts). But the domain A 
is too small to permit D to be self-adjoint, for ev­
ery continuously differentiable L2 function is in the 
domain of D*. To make D self-adjoint we would 
have to enlarge its domain appropriately—thereby 
risking a loss of symmetry. Each symmetric operator 
of type III suffers from the same disease: its domain is 
smaller than that of its adjoint. Moreover the cure— 
namely, extension of the domain—is often fatal since 
with a larger domain the operator may fail to be 
symmetric.
To apply his spectral theorem to symmetric opera­
tors von Neumann had to know which types of sym­
metric operators admit self-adjoint extensions. He 
[1929a] and Wintner [1929b] identified a large class 
of such operators, namely, those operators T, called 
semibounded, for which there is a positive constant 
M satisfying either (Tx,x) < M ||x|| for all x e DT, 
or —M||x|| < (Tx,x) for all x e DT. The best state­
ment of this result is due to Stone [1932a] and Kurt O. 
Friedrichs [1934]: every semibounded symmetric op­
erator may be extended to a semibounded self-adjoint 
operator with the same bound.
Whereas the central focus of the von Neumann- 
Stone spectral theory (and of Hilbert’s also) is on 
operators with real spectra, the spectral theorem does 
apply, at least in two cases, to operators with more 
general spectra. The simplest case concerns isomet­
ric operators which leave the inner product on H in­
variant; from this definition it follows easily that the 
spectrum of an isometric operator is a subset of the 
unit circle. An isometric operator that maps H onto H 
is called unitary and is characterized by the fact that 
its adjoint is its inverse (i.e., TT* = T*T = I). Uni­
tary operators were first studied in [1909c] by Isaac 
Schur, following their introduction by Leon Autonne 
in [1902]. In [1929a] von Neumann employed the 
Cayley transform
C : T ^ (T — ii)(T + ii)-1
to map symmetric operators T into isometric opera­
tors C(T); he showed that T is self-adjoint if and only 
ifC(T) is unitary. Thus the spectral theory for unitary 
operators follows from that for self-adjoint operators 
by use of a spectral integral on the unit circle instead 
of on the real line.

Now every bounded linear operator T can be writ­
ten in the “Cartesian” form T = A + iB, where A 
and B are bounded and self-adjoint; in fact,
A =1( T + T *), B = 1 (T - T *) .
Thus it would appear likely that the spectral theo­
rem could be extended to all bounded linear opera­
tors by using this decomposition. However, the details 
of that extension require that AB = BA (or equiv­
alently, that TT* = T*T). So the desired extension 
works only for those operators which commute with 
their adjoints: such operators are called normal, after 
Toeplitz [1918a]. Toeplitz extended Hilbert’s spectral 
theorem to completely continuous normal quadratic 
forms by showing that such a form was unitarily 
equivalent to a diagonal form. More generally, the 
spectral resolution
T = j 
XdEx
extends to bounded normal operators, where the inte­
gration is over the spectrum of T which is a compact 
subset of the complex plane contained in the disc of 
radius \\T||. Von Neumann [1930a] and Stone [1932a] 
extended both the definition and spectral theory of 
normal operators to the unbounded case as well.
We have come a long way from the principal axes 
theorem, and the spectral theorems of von Neumann 
and Stone reflect far more analysis than geometry. 
The geometric content of the spectral theorem for 
finite-dimensional space is that the entire space can 
be expressed as the direct sum of subspaces on each 
of which the given transformation acts like simple 
multiplication. But this theorem fails in the infinite­
dimensional cases as soon as the continuous spectrum 
appears. In a paper written in 1938 but not published 
until [1949a], von Neumann effectively resuscitated 
the geometrical spectral theorem by defining a di­
rect integral of Hilbert spaces (in strict analogy with 
the direct sum). He then showed that the action of a 
self-adjoint operator on any Hilbert space could be 
represented as the accumulated effect of simple mul­
tiplications on certain subspaces whose direct integral 
was (unitarily equivalent to) the original space.
10 Gelfand-Naimark theorem
The collection of all operators on a Hilbert space 
forms a ring; such rings, with various topologies, were 
extensively investigated by von Neumann and Fran­
cis J. Murray in [1936a], [1937a] and [1940a]. During 
the same period 1936-1940 S. W P. Steen published 
in England a series of five papers ([1936b], [1937b], 
[1938a], [1939], (1940b]) devoted to an axiomatic 
theory of operators. But the papers that offered the 
most significant insight into the spectral theorem were 
[1941a], [1941b] and [1943] published in the U.S.S.R. 
by Israel M. Gelfand, Mark A. Naimark and Georgii 
E. Silov. Gelfand and his colleagues created a the­
ory of normed rings which not only subsumed much 
of the work of von Neumann, Murray and Steen on 
rings of operators, but also provided a beautiful gen­
eral setting for the study of Fourier transforms and 
harmonic analysis. Related studies were carried out 
in the United States by Stone ([1940c], [1941c]) and 
Shizuo Kakutani [1941d].
Normed rings were first introduced in [1936c] by 
the Japanese mathematician Mitio Nagumo under 
the name of “linear metric rings”. In [1946] Charles 
E. Rickart christened Gelfand’s normed rings “Ba­
nach algebras” to avoid misunderstanding due to 
the algebraic meaning of “ring”; as a consequence 
Russian mathematicians now use the former name, 
while Americans use the latter. But regardless of its 
name, the properties of a Banach algebra are those 
of a complete normed algebra (over the complex 
field C) satisfying the multiplicative triangle inequal­
ity ||x||||y|| < ||xy||. We shall assume that each Ba­
nach algebra contains an identity element e, where 
|| e|| = 1. The set of all bounded linear operators on a 
Hilbert space is a Banach algebra, as is the set of all 
continuous complex-valued functions on a compact 
topological space X, with the sup norm
||/1| = sup {If (x) | : x & X} .
The part of Banach algebra theory germane to spec­
tral theory is the relation between these two examples.
Gelfand’s theory of commutative Banach algebras 
depends on three fundamental concepts: homomor­
phisms, maximal ideals and spectra. A homomor­
phism of a commutative Banach algebra B is a non­
zero multiplicative linear functional; its kernel is a 
maximal ideal since itis contained in no larger proper 
ideal. Moreover, every maximal ideal I is the kernel 
of some homomorphism, for in this case the factor 
algebra B/I is the field C of complex numbers (ac­
cording to a result announced by Stanislaw Mazur 
[1938b] and proved by Gelfand [1941a]) so the com­
posite map B ^ B/I ^ C is a homomorphism of 
B whose kernel is I. The set MB of homomorphisms 

46
Analysis
(or equivalently, of maximal ideals) of B is given the 
weakest topology relative to which all of the functions 
x : h ^ h (x) are continuous, for all x e B. Then the 
topological space MB is compact and Hausdorff, and 
each element x of B is represented in C(MB ) (the 
Banach algebra of continuous complex valued func­
tions on MB) by its “Gelfand transform” x.
In strict analogy with the spectral theory of opera­
tors on a Hilbert space, Gelfand defines the spectrum 
a (x) of an element x e B to be the set of complex 
numbers A for which the element x — Xe has no in­
verse. The set a(x) is compact, non-empty and con­
tained in the disc of radius ||x||. Furthermore, a(x) 
happens to be precisely equal to the range of the 
Gelfand transform x: a(x) = {h(x) | h e MB }. For 
this reason the space MB of maximal ideals is often 
called the spectrum of the Banach algebra B. IfB is 
the algebra generated by a single element x (such as 
a particular operator on H), then the spectrum of the 
algebra B is mapped homeomorphically by x onto 
the spectrum ofx.
In [1943] Gelfand and Naimark showed that the 
commutative Banach algebra C(MB ) is character­
ized by the presence of an involution—namely, the 
operation of complex conjugation * : f ^ f. Specifi­
cally, they showed that any commutative Banach alge­
bra with an involution (called a B* -algebra) is isomet­
rically isomorphic to the algebra C(MB ) for some 
Banach algebra B. In particular, the commutative B*- 
algebra B(T) generated by a given bounded normal 
operator T is isomorphic to the algebra C(a(T )) of 
all continuous functions on a(T ), the spectrum of 
B(T); T is assumed normal in order that the pres­
ence of the involution * : T ^ T* should not destroy 
the commutativity of the algebra B(T).
The impact of the Gelfand-Naimark theorem on 
spectral theory is this: the spectral theorem for a 
bounded normal operator T can be inferred via the 
isomorphism between B(T) and C(a(T)) from a cor­
responding theorem concerning continuous complex­
valued functions on a(T). The required theorem is 
just that every continuous function on a(T) (in par­
ticular, the identity function f(X) = X) can be ap­
proximated uniformly by measurable step functions 
of the form 52 f (Xi)xai, where xai is the charac­
teristic function of the measurable set Ai. The trans­
lation of this theorem to the algebra B(T) (in the 
special case f (X) = X) is the spectral resolution of 
the bounded normal operator T : T = XdEX .In 
words instead of symbols, the approximation theorem 
says that a continuous function can be approximated 
by linear combinations of characteristic functions, 
while the spectral theorem says that bounded normal 
operators can be approximated by linear combina­
tions of projections. Thus Gelfand’s theory of Banach 
algebras revealed that the spectral theorem is in some 
fundamental sense equivalent to a most rudimentary 
fact in the theory of functions.
Gelfand’s theory actually yields a spectral theo­
rem far stronger than those which we have so far 
discussed. By translating the approximation theorem 
for an arbitrary continuous function f we obtain a 
spectral resolution of the form f(T) = f(X) dEX . 
This formula was originally introduced by von Neu­
mann and Stone as the basis of their “operational 
calculus”. A related general spectral theorem, also 
due to von Neumann [1930a], can be inferred from 
the Gelfand-Naimark isomorphism: any commuta­
tive family of bounded normal operators admits a 
simultaneous diagonalization—that is, a single reso­
lution of the identity which simultaneously represents 
all operators in the family by means of the integral
f(X) dEX for various functions f.
11 Unfinished business
This concludes our saga of the spectral theorem. 
Our historical vision has been deliberately narrow, 
focused throughout on the evolution of just one theo­
rem, and only rarely have we glanced at the many 
fascinating applications and extensions of the ba­
sic theory. For example, spectral theory for spaces 
without inner products can be traced back to Riesz 
[1918b] and T. H. Hildebrandt [1931], while the rudi­
ments of spectral theory for differential operators are 
contained in the work [1908c] of George Birkhoff; in 
[1928b] and [1930d] Norbert Wiener developed a the­
ory of spectral analysis for functions in an attempt to 
analyze mathematically the spectrum of white light, 
while twenty years later Arne Beurling [1949b] inau­
gurated the complementary study of spectral synthe­
sis; and in [1942] Edgar R. Lorch, continuing work 
begun in [1913a] byF. Riesz, investigated spectral sets 
in the plane by means of contour integrals. Had we 
stopped to investigate each such offshoot our evolu­
tionary tree (Figure 1) would have looked like a forest. 
Indeed, it took Nelson Dunford and Jacob Schwartz 
nearly 3000 pages to survey spectral theory ([1958a], 
[1963], [1971]). So any who are inspired to examine 
the fruits of spectral theory are invited to read this 
treatise or any of its many less ambitious companions 
([1951], [1953], [1958b], [1962]). Our mission to de­
scribe the roots and main trunk of spectral theory is 
accomplished.

Alan Turing and the Central Limit Theorem
S. L. ZABELL
American Mathematical Monthly 102 (1995), 483-494
Because the English mathematician Alan Mathison 
Turing (1912-1954) is remembered today primarily 
for his work in mathematical logic (Turing machines 
and the “Entscheidungsproblem”), machine compu­
tation, and artificial intelligence (the “Turing test”), 
his name is not usually thought of in connection 
with either probability or statistics. One of the ba­
sic tools in both of these subjects is the use of the 
normal or Gaussian distribution as an approximation, 
one basic result being the Lindeberg-Feller central 
limit theorem taught in first-year graduate courses in 
mathematical probability. No-one associates Turing 
with the central limit theorem, but in 1934 Turing, 
while still an undergraduate, rediscovered a version 
of Lindeberg’s 1922 theorem and much of the Feller­
Levy converse to it (then unpublished). This paper 
discusses Turing’s connection with the central limit 
theorem and its surprising aftermath: his use of sta­
tistical methods during World War II to break key 
German military codes.
1 
Introduction
Turing went up to Cambridge as an undergraduate in 
the Fall Term of 1931, having gained a scholarship 
to King’s College. (Ironically, King’s was his second 
choice; he had failed to gain a scholarship to Trinity.) 
Two years later, during the course of his studies, Tur­
ing attended a series of lectures on the Methodology 
of Science, given in the autumn of 1933 by the dis­
tinguished astrophysicist Sir Arthur Stanley Edding­
ton. One topic Eddington discussed was the tendency 
of experimental measurements subject to errors of 
observation to often have an approximately normal 
or Gaussian distribution. But Eddington’s heuristic 
sketch left Turing dissatisfied, and Turing set out to 
derive a rigorous mathematical proof of what is to­
day termed the central limit theorem for independent 
(but not necessarily identically distributed) random 
variables.
Turing succeeded in his objective within the short 
span of several months (no later than the end of Febru­
ary 1934). Only then did he find out that the prob­
lem had already been solved, twelve years earlier in 
1922, by the Finnish mathematician Jarl Waldemar 
Lindeberg (1876-1932). Despite this, Turing was en­
couraged to submit his work, suitably amended, as 
a Fellowship Dissertation. (Turing was still an un­
dergraduate at the time; students seeking to become a 
Fellow at a Cambridge college had to submit evidence 
of original work, but did not need to have a Ph.D. or 
its equivalent.) This revision, entitled “On the Gaus­
sian Error Function,” was completed and submitted 
in November 1934. On the strength of this paper Tur­
ing was elected a Fellow of King’s four months later 
(March 16, 1935) at the age of 22; his nomination 
was supported by the group theorist Philip Hall and 
the economists John Maynard Keynes and Alfred Ce­
cil Pigou. Later that year the paper was awarded the 
prestigious Smith’s prize by the University (see [26]).
Turing never published his paper. Its major result 
had been anticipated, although, as will be seen, it con­
tains other results that were both interesting and novel 
at the time. But in the interim Turing’s mathematical 
interests had taken a very different turn. During the 
spring of 1935, awaiting the outcome of his appli­
cation for a Fellowship at King’s, Turing attended a 
course of lectures by the topologist M. H. A. Newman 
on the Foundations of Mathematics. During the Inter­
national Congress of Mathematicians in 1928, David 
Hilbert had posed three questions: is mathematics 
complete (that is, can every statement in the language 
of number theory be either proved or disproved?), is 
it consistent, and is it decidable? (This last is the 
Entscheidungsproblem, or the “decision problem”; 
does there exist an algorithm for deciding whether or

nota specific mathematical assertion does or does not 
have a proof.) Kurt Godel had shown in 1931 that the 
answer to the first question is no (the so-called “first 
incompleteness theorem”); and that if number theory 
is consistent, then a proof of this fact does not exist 
using the methods of the first-order predicate calcu­
lus (the “second incompleteness theorem”). Newman 
had proved the Godel theorems in his course, but he 
pointed out that the third of Hilbert’s questions, the 
Entscheidungsproblem, remained open.
This challenge attracted Turing, and in short order 
he had arrived at a solution (in the negative), using 
the novel device of Turing machines. The drafting 
of the resulting paper (Turing, 1937) dominated Tur­
ing’s life for a year from the spring of 1935 ([26], 
p. 109); and thus Turing turned from mathematical 
probability, never to return.
A copy of Turing’s Fellowship Dissertation sur­
vives, however, in the archives of the King’s College 
Library, and its existence raises an obvious question. 
Just how far did a mathematician of the calibre of 
Turing get in this attack on the central limit theorem, 
one year before he began his pioneering research into 
the foundations of mathematical logic? The answer 
to that question is the focus of this paper.
2 
The central limit theorem
The earliest version of the central limit theorem 
(CLT) is due to Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754). 
If X1 ,X2,X3,... is an infinite sequence of 1s and 
0s recording whether a success (Xn = 1) or failure 
(Xn =0) has occurred at each stage in a sequence of 
repeated trials, then the sum Sn := X 1 + X2 + • • • 
+ Xn gives the total number of successes after n 
trials. If the trials are independent, and the prob­
ability of a success at each trial is the same, say 
P [Xn =1]=p, P [Xn =0]=1- p, then the prob­
ability of seeing exactly k successes in n trials has a 
binomial distribution:
P[Sn = k] = niPk (1 - P)n-k. 
k!(n - k)!
If n is large (for example, 10, 000), then as de 
Moivre noted, the direct computation of binomial 
probabilities “is not possible without labor nearly im­
mense, not to say impossible”; and for this reason he 
turned to approximate methods (see [9]): using Stir­
ling’s approximation (including correction terms) to 
estimate the individual terms in the binomial distri­
bution and then summing, de Moivre discovered the 
remarkable fact that
lim p a < Sn - np < b
n'^ 
npnp(1 - p)
1xx 2
2 x
dx,
or $(b) — $(a), where $(x) is the cumulative distri­
bution function of the standard normal (or Gaussian) 
distribution:
$( x):=
1
2
dt.
2
During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries this 
result was extended far beyond the simple coin­
tossing set-up considered by de Moivre, impor­
tant contributions being made by Laplace, Poisson, 
Chebyshev, Markov, Liapunov, von Mises, Lindeberg, 
Levy, Bernstein, and Feller; see [1], [34], [29], and 
[36] for further historical information. Such investi­
gations revealed that if X1 ,X2 ,X3 , ... is any se­
quence of independent random variables having the 
same distribution, then the sum Sn satisfies the CLT 
provided suitable centering and scaling constants are 
used: the centering constant np in the binomial case 
is replaced by the sum of the expectations E [Xn ]; 
the scaling constant np(1 — p) is replaced by the 
square root of the sum of the variances Var[Xn] (pro­
vided these are finite).
Indeed, it is not even necessary for the random 
variables Xn contributing to the sum Sn to have the 
same distribution, provided that no one term dom­
inates the sum. Of course this has to be made pre­
cise. The best result is due to Lindeberg. Suppose 
E[Xn] =0, 0 < Var[Xn] < <x>, sn := Var[Sn], and
n
A n (£ )
2; Xk | 
sn
> £
(The notation E [X ; Y > £] means that the expec­
tation of X is restricted to outcomes w such that 
Y(w) > £.) The Lindeberg condition is the require­
ment that
An (£) ^ 0, forall £> 0; 
(2.1)
and the Lindeberg central limit theorem [33] states 
that if the sequence of random variables X1,X2 ,... 
satisfies the Lindeberg condition (2.1), then for all 
a<b,
lim P a < — <b
n ^^ 
sn
= $( b) — $( a).
(2.2)

54
Analysis
Despite its technical appearance, the Lindeberg 
condition turns out to be a natural sufficient condi­
tion for the CLT. There are two reasons for this. First, 
the Lindeberg condition has a simple consequence: if 
a'k := Var[Xk ], then
2
Pn 
max
Z2 
s n
^ 0.
(2.3)
Thus, if the sequence X1 ,X2 ,X3 , ... satisfies the 
Lindeberg condition, the variance of an individual 
term Xk in the sum Sn is asymptotically negligible. 
Second, for such sequences the Lindeberg condition 
is necessary as well as sufficient for the CLT to hold, a 
beautiful fact discovered (independently) by William 
Feller and Paul Levy in 1935. In short: (2.1) o (2.2) 
+ (2.3).
If, in contrast, the Feller-Levy condition (2.3) fails, 
then it turns out that convergence to the normal distri­
bution can occur in a fashion markedly different from 
that of the CLT. If (2.3) does not hold, then there exist a 
number P>0 and two sequences of positive integers 
{mk } and {nk }, where {nk } is strictly increasing, 
such that
1 < mk < nk for all k
and
Var Xmk 
s snk
2 
am k
s 2mk ^ p2 > 0.
(2.4)
Feller [13] showed that if normal convergence oc­
curs (that is, condition (2.2) holds), but condition 
(2.4) also obtains, then
1 Xm ^ N(0, 1); 
P Snk
that is, there exists a subsequence Xmk whose con­
tributions to the sums Sn are non-negligible (rela­
tive to Sn ) and which, properly scaled, converges to 
the standard normal distribution. (The symbol ^ de­
notes convergence in distribution; N(p, a2), the nor­
mal distribution, has expectation p and variance a2.) 
Note. For the purposes of brevity, this summary 
of the contributions of Feller and Levy simplifies a 
much more complex story; see [29] for a more de­
tailed account. (Or better, consult the original papers 
themselves!)
3 Turing’s fellowship 
dissertation
Turing’s fellowship dissertation was written twelve 
years after Lindeberg’s work had appeared, and
shortly before the work of Feller and Levy. There 
are several aspects of the paper that demonstrate Tur­
ing’s insight into the basic problems surrounding the 
CLT. One of these is his decision, contrary to a then 
common textbook approach (see, e.g., [4], pp. 87­
90), but crucial if the best result is to be obtained 
(and the approach also adopted by Lindeberg), to 
work at the level of distribution functions (i.e., the 
function FX (t) := P [X < t]) rather than densities 
(the derivatives of the distribution functions). In Ap­
pendix B Turing notes:
I have attempted to obtain some results [using 
densities] ... but without success. The reason is 
clear. In order that the shape frequency func­
tions un (x) of fn (x) should tend to the shape 
frequency function 0(x) of the Gaussian error, 
much heavier restrictions on the functions gn(x) 
are required than is needed if we only require 
that Un ^ $. It became clear to me... that it 
would be better to work in terms of distribution 
function throughout.
This was an important insight. Although versions of 
the central limit theorem do exist for densities, these 
ordinarily require stronger assumptions than just the 
Lindeberg condition (2.1); see, e.g., [14], pp. 516­
517, and [35], Chapter 7. Let us now turn to the body 
of Turing’s paper, and consider it, section by section.
Basic structure of the paper
The first seven sections of the paper (pp. 1-6) summa­
rize notation and the basic properties of distribution 
functions. Section 1 summarizes the problem; Sec­
tion 2 defines the distribution function F (abbreviated 
DF) of an “error” £; Section 3 summarizes the basic 
properties of the expectation and mean square devia­
tion (MSD) ofa sum of independent errors; rigorous 
proofs in terms of the distribution function are given 
in an appendix at the end of the paper (Appendix C). 
Section 4 discusses the distribution function ofa sum 
of independent errors, the sum distribution function 
(SDF), in terms of the distribution functions of each 
term in the sum, and derives the formula for F ® G, 
the convolution of two distribution functions. Section 
5 then introduces the concept of the shape function 
(SF): the standardization ofa distribution function F 
to have zero expectation and unit MSD; thus, ifF has 
expectation p and MSD a2 (a>0), then the shape 
function ofF is U(x):= F(a(x - p)). (Turing uses 
the symbols a and k2 to denote p and a2 ; several

ZABELL: Alan Turing and the Central Limit Theorem
55
other minor changes in notation of this sort are made 
below.)
In Section 6 Turing then states the basic problem 
to be considered: given a sequence of errors ek, hav­
ing distribution functions Gk, shape functions Vk , 
means ^k, mean square deviations ak, sum distribu­
tion functions Fn , and shape functions Un for each 
Fn , under what conditions do the shape functions 
Un (x) converge uniformly to $(x), the “SF of the 
Gaussian Error”? Turing then assumes for simplicity 
that ^k =0 and ak < to .In Section 7 (“Fundamen­
tal Property of the Gaussian Error”), he notes that 
the only properties of $ that are used in deriving 
sufficient conditions for normal convergence are that 
it is an SF, and the “self-reproductive property” of 
$: that is, if X 1 ~ N(0, a2) and X2 ~ N(0, a2) are 
independent, then X 1 + X2 ~ N(0, a2 + a2). (The 
notation X ~ N(^,a2) means that the random vari­
able X has the distribution N(p,a2).)
The quasi-necessary conditions
It is at this point that Turing comes to the heart of the 
matter. In Section 8 (“The Quasi-Necessary Condi­
tions”) Turing notes
The conditions we shall impose fall into two 
groups. Those ofone group (the quasi-necessary 
conditions) involve the MSDs only. They are not 
actually necessary, but if they are not fulfilled Un 
can only tend to $ by a kind of accident.
The two conditions that Turing refers to as the “quasi­
necessary” conditions are:
oo
ak = to and
k=1
2
y ■ 0 0
sn
(3.1)
It is easy to see that Turing’s condition (3.1) is 
equivalent to condition (2.3). (That (2.3) implies (3.1) 
is immediate. To see (3.1) implies (2.3): given e>0, 
choose M > 1 so that an/sn < e for n > M, and 
N > M so that an / s2N < e for 1 < k < M; if n > 
N, then ak2/s2n < e for 1 < k < n.)
In his Theorems 4 and 5, Turing explores the con­
sequences of the failure of either part of condition 
(3.1). Turing’s proof of Theorem 4 requires his
Theorem 3. If X and Y are independent, and both 
X and X + Y are Gaussian, then Y is Gaussian.
This is a special case ofa celebrated theorem proven 
shortly thereafter by Harald Cramer (1936): if X and 
Y are independent, and X + Y is Gaussian, then both 
X and Y must be Gaussian. Levy had earlier conjec­
tured Cramer’s theorem to be true (in 1928 and again 
in 1935), but had been unable to prove it. Cramer’s 
proof of this result in 1936 in turn enabled Levy 
to arrive at necessary and sufficient conditions for 
the CLT of a very general type (using centering and 
scaling constants other than the mean and standard 
deviation), and this in turn led Levy to write his fa­
mous monograph, Theoriedel’Additiondes Variables 
Aleatoires [31]; see [29], pp. 80-81, 90.
Cramer’s theorem is a hard fact; his original proof 
appealed to Hadamard’s theorem in the theory of en­
tire functions. The special case of the theorem needed 
by Turing is much simpler; it is an immediate conse­
quence of the characterization theorem for character­
istic functions. To see this, let o\ (t) := E[exp(itX)] 
denote the characteristic function of a random vari­
able X ; and suppose that X and Y are indepen­
dent, X ~ N(0, a2), and X + Y ~ N(0, a2+ t2). 
Then
exp - a + T 12 
= 0x+y (t)
= ^x (t) ^y (t) = exp - y12 ^y (t), 
and hence oY (t) = exp(-(t2/2)12); thus Y ~ 
N(0,t2),becausethe characteristic function of a ran­
dom variable uniquely determines the distribution of 
that variable. Turing’s proof, which uses distribution 
functions, is not much longer.
It is an immediate consequence of Cramer’s theo­
rem that if Sn/sn ^ N(0, 1), but limn ,o Sn < to, 
then all the summands Xj must in fact be Gaus­
sian. But Turing did not have this fact at his dis­
posal, only his much weaker Theorem 3. His Theo­
rem 4 (phrased in the language of random variables) 
thus makes the much more limited claim that if (a) 
52 an < to, (b) Sn converges to a Gaussian distri­
bution, and (c) X0 is a random variable at once in­
dependent of the original sequence X1 ,X2 , 000 and 
having a distribution other than Gaussian, then the se­
quence Sn = X0 + Sn cannot converge to the Gaus­
sian distribution. In other words: if an2 < to, then 
“the convergence . . . to the Gaussian is so delicate 
that a single extra term in the sequence . . . upsets 
it”.
Turing’s Theorem 5 in turn explores the con­
sequences of the failure of (3.1) in the case that 
an an = to but pn := an / sn does not tend to zero as 
n ^ to . The statement of the theorem is somewhat

56
Analysis
technical in nature, but Turing’s later summary of it 
captures the essential phenomenon involved:
If Fn [the distribution function of Sn ] tends 
to Gaussian and on /sn does not tend to zero 
[but 52 on2 <x] we can find a subsequence of 
Gn [the distribution function of Xn ] tending to 
Gaussian.
Thus Turing had by some two years anticipated 
Feller’s discovery of the subsequence phenomenon. 
(In Turing’s typescript, symbols such as Fn are en­
tered by hand; in the above quotation the space for Fn 
has by accident been left blank, but the paragraph im­
mediately preceding this one in the typescript makes 
it clear that Fn is intended.)
The sufficient conditions
Turing states in his preface that he had been “in­
formed that an almost identical proof had been given 
by Lindeberg.” This comment refers to the method of 
proof Turing uses, not the result obtained. Turing’s 
method is to smooth the distribution functions Fn (x) 
of the sum by forming the convolution Fn * $(x/p), 
expand the result in a Taylor series to third order, and 
then let the variance p2 of the convolution term tend 
to zero. This is similar to the method employed by 
Lindeberg. (There is an important difference, how­
ever: Turing does not use Lindeberg’s “swapping” 
argument. For an attractive modern presentation of 
the Lindeberg method, see [2], pp. 167-170; for a 
discussion of the method, see Pollard’s comments in 
[29], pp. 94-95.)
Turing does not, however, succeed in arriving at 
the Lindeberg condition (2.1) as a sufficient condi­
tion for convergence to the normal distribution; the 
most general sufficient condition he gives is com­
plex in appearance (although it necessarily implies 
the Lindeberg condition). Turing concedes that his 
“form of the sufficiency conditions is too clumsy for 
direct application,” but notes that it can be used to 
“derive various criteria from it, of different degrees of 
directness and of comprehensiveness”. One of these 
holds if the summands Xk all have the same shape 
(that is, the shape functions Vk (x) := p[Xk/ok < x] 
coincide); and thus includes the special case of identi­
cally distributed summands having a second moment. 
(This was no small feat, since even this special case of 
the more general Lindeberg result had eluded proof 
until the publication of Lindeberg’s paper.)
One formulation of this criterion, equivalent to 
the one actually stated by Turing, is: there exists a
function J : R+ ^ R+ such that limt ,-x_ J(t) = 0, 
and
E
Xk 
ok -t
2
; Xk 
ok
> t < J (t),
for all k > 1, t > 0. 
(3.2)
In turn one simple sufficient condition for this 
given by Turing is that there exists a function ^ such 
that ^(x) > 0 for all x, limx.,±-x_ $(x) = <x> and
sup E 
k
Xkk_
\ xk
2 
0
Xk 
ok
< <x>.
(3.3)
(Note that unfortunately one important special case 
not covered by either of these conditions is that the 
Xk are uniformly bounded: |Xk | <C,forsomeC 
and all k > 1.)
In assessing this portion of Turing’s paper, it is 
important to keep two points in mind. First, Turing 
states in his preface that “since reading Lindeberg’s 
paper I have for obvious reasons made no alterations 
to that part of the paper which is similar to his.” The 
manuscript is thus necessarily incomplete; it presum­
ably would have been further polished and refined 
had Turing continued to work on it; the technical suf­
ficient conditions given represent how far Turing had 
gotten on the problem prior to seeing Lindeberg’s 
work. Second, in 1934 the Lindeberg condition was 
only known to be sufficient, not necessary; thus even 
in discussing his results in other sections of the paper 
(where he felt free to refer to the Lindeberg result), it 
may not have seemed important to Turing to contrast 
his own particular technical sufficient conditions with 
those of Lindeberg; the similarity in method must 
have seemed far more important.
One counter-example
Turing concludes by giving a simple example ofa se­
quence X1 ,X2, ...that satisfies the quasi-necessary 
conditions (3.1), but not the CLT. For n > 1, let
P [Xn = ±n] = nnn; P [xn =0] =1 _ nn.
Then E[Xn] = 0, Var[Xn] = E[Xn2] = 1, s2n =
Var[Sn] = n ^ ^, and pn = 1 /n ^ 0; thus (3.1) is 
satisfied. Turing then shows that if Sn/sn converges, 
the limit distribution must have a discontinuity at 
zero, and therefore cannot be Gaussian.
It is interesting that Turing should happen to choose 
this particular example; although he does not note it,

ZABELL: Alan Turing and the Central Limit Theorem

the sequence {Sn /sn : n>1} has the property that 
Var[Sn/sn] = 1, but limn .. Sn (w)/sn = 0 for al­
most all sample paths w. This is an easy consequence

it follows that P [Xn = 0 infinitely often] = 0; thus 
P[supn Sn I < x ] = 1 and P[limn o Sn/sn = 
0] = 1.
The existence of such sequences has an interest­
ing consequence for the CLT. Let {Yn : n > 1} be 
a sequence of independent random variables, jointly 
independent of the sequence {Xn : n > 1} and such 
that P[Yn = ± 1] = 1. Let Tn := Y. + Y2 + ••• + 
Yn; then a trite calculation shows that Sn + Tn satis­
fies the Feller condition (2.3), but not the Lindeberg 
condition (2.1). Let tn := Var[Tn]; then Tn/tn ^ 
N(0, 1) and Var[Sn + Tn] = s2n + t2n, hence
Sn + Tn

Thus the sequence Sn + Tn does converge to a 
Gaussian distribution! This does not, however, con­
tradict the Feller converse to the Lindeberg CLT; 
that result states that Sn + Tn , rescaled to have unit 
variance, cannot converge to the standard Gaussian 
N (0, 1).
4 Discussion
Turing’s Fellowship Dissertation tells us something 
about Turing, something about the state of mathe­
matical probability at Cambridge in the 1930s, and 
something about the general state of mathematical 
probability during that decade.
I. J. Good ([19], p. 34) has remarked that when Tur­
ing “attacked a problem he started from first princi­
ples, and he was hardly influenced by received opin­
ion. This attitude gave depth and originality to his 
thinking, and also it helped him to choose important 
problems.” This observation is nicely illustrated by 
Turing’s work on the CLT. His dissertation is, viewed 
in context, a very impressive piece of work. Com­
ing to the subject as an undergraduate, his knowledge 
of mathematical probability was apparently limited to 
some of the older textbooks such as “Czuber, Morgan 
Crofton, and others” (Preface, p. ii).
Despite this, Turing immediately realized the im­
portance of working at the level of distribution func­
tions rather than densities; developed a method of at­
tack similar to Lindeberg’s; obtained useful sufficient 
conditions for convergence to the normal distribu­
tion; identified the conditions necessary for true cen­
tral limit behavior to occur; understood the relevance 
of a Cramer-type factorization theorem in the deriva­
tion of such necessary conditions; and discovered the 
Feller subsequence phenomenon. If one realizes that 
the defects of the paper, such as they are, must largely 
reflect the fact that Turing had ceased to work on the 
main body of it after being apprised of Lindeberg’s 
work, it is clear that Turing had penetrated almost 
immediately to the heart of a problem whose solu­
tion had long eluded many mathematicians far better 
versed in the subject than he. (It is interesting to note 
that Lindeberg was also a relative outsider to prob­
ability theory, and only began to work in the field a 
few years before 1922.)
The episode also illustrates the surprisingly back­
ward state of mathematical probability in Cambridge 
at the time. Turing wrote to his mother in April 1934: 
“I am sending some research I did last year to Czuber 
in Vienna [the author of several excellent German 
textbooks on mathematical probability], not having 
found anyone in Cambridge who is interested in it. 
I am afraid however that he may be dead, as he was 
writing books in 1891” ([26], p. 88). (Czuber had in 
fact died nearly a decade before, in 1925.)
This disinterest is particularly surprising in the 
case of G. H. Hardy, who was responsible for a 
number of important results in probabilistic num­
ber theory. But anyone who has studied the Hardy- 
Ramanujan proof of the distribution of prime divisors 
of an integer (1917), and compared it to Turan’s ([27], 
p. 71-74), will realize at once that the even most rudi­
mentary ideas of modern probability must have been 
foreign to Hardy; see also [10], [11]. Indeed, Paul 
Erdos believes that “had Hardy known the even least 
little bit of probability, with his amazing talent he 
would certainly have been able to prove the law of 
the iterated logarithm” [8]. Perhaps this reflected in 
part the limited English literature on the subject. In 
1927, when Harald Cramer visited England and men­
tioned to Hardy (his friend and former teacher) that 
he had become interested in probability theory, Hardy 

58
Analysis
replied that “there was no mathematically satisfactory 
book in English on this subject, and encouraged me 
to write one” ([7], p. 516).
Finally, Turing’s thesis illustrates the transitional 
nature of work in mathematical probability dur­
ing the decade of the 1930s, before the impact of 
Kolmogorov’s pioneering book Grundbegriffe der 
Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung [28] had been felt. In 
his paper Turing had thought it necessary to state and 
prove some of the most basic properties of distri­
bution functions and their convolutions (in Sections 
3 and 4, and Appendix C of the dissertation). His 
comment that his Appendix C “is only given for the 
sake of logical completeness and it is of little conse­
quence whether it is original or not” illustrates that 
such results, although “known”, did not enjoy general 
currency at the time. (It is all too easy to overlook to­
day the important milestone in the literature of the 
subject marked by the publication in 1946 of Harald 
Cramer’s important textbook Mathematical Methods 
of Statistics [6].)
It is also interesting to note Turing’s approach to 
the problem in terms of convolutions of distribution 
functions rather than sums of independent random 
variables. Feller had similarly avoided the use of the 
language of random variables in his 1935 paper, for­
mulating the problem instead in terms of convolu­
tions. The reason, as Le Cam ([29], p. 87) notes, 
was that “Feller did not think that such concepts [as 
random variable] belonged in a mathematical frame­
work. This was a common attitude in the mathemati­
cal community.”
Current mathematical attitudes towards probabil­
ity have changed so markedly from the distrust and 
scepticism of earlier times that today the sheer magni­
tude of the shift is often unappreciated. Joseph Doob, 
whose own work dates back to this period, notes that 
“even as late as the 1930s it was not quite obvious 
to some probabilists, and it was certainly a matter of 
doubt to most nonprobabilists, that probability could 
be treated as a rigorous mathematical discipline. In 
fact it is clear from their publications that many prob- 
abilists were uneasy in their research until their prob­
lems were rephrased in what was then nonprobabilis- 
tic language” ([29], p. 93-94).
5 Epilogue: Bletchley Park
After his Fellowship dissertation Turing “always 
looked out for any statistical aspects of [a] problem 
under consideration” [3]. This trait of Turing is par­
ticularly striking in the case of his cryptanalytic work 
during the second world war.
Turing left England for Princeton in 1936, to work 
with the logician Alonzo Church; he returned in 1938, 
after his Fellowship at King’s College had been re­
newed. Recruited almost immediately by GC and 
CS (the Government Code and Cipher School), on 
September 4th, 1939 (one day after the outbreak of 
war) Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the British 
cryptanalytic unit charged with breaking German 
codes, soon rising to a position of considerable im­
portance. (Turing’s work at Bletchley was the subject 
of a 1987 London play, “Breaking the Code”, written 
by Hugh Whitemore and starring Derek Jacobi, of “I, 
Claudius” fame.)
The staff at Bletchley Park included many gifted 
people, distinguished in a number of different fields; 
among these were the mathematicians M. H. A. New­
man, J. H. C. Whitehead, Philip Hall, Peter Hilton, 
Shaun Wylie, David Rees, and Gordon Welchman; 
the international chessmasters C. H. O’D. Alexander, 
P. S. Milner-Barry, and Harry Golombek; and others 
such as Donald Mitchie (today an important figure in 
artificial intelligence), Roy Jenkins (the later Chan­
cellor of the Exchequer), and Peter Benenson (the 
founder of Amnesty International). Turing’s chief sta­
tistical assistant in the later half of 1942 was another 
mathematician, I. J. Good, fresh from studies under 
Hardy and Besicovitch at Cambridge. (Good arrived 
at Bletchley on May 27, 1942, the day the Bismarck 
was sunk.) In recent years Good has written several 
papers ([18], [19], [21], [22]) discussing Turing’s ad 
hoc development of Bayesian statistical methods at 
Bletchley to assist in the decrypting of German mes­
sages. (More general accounts of the work at Bletch­
ley include [32], [38] and [25]; see also the bibliog­
raphy in [21].)
The specific details of Turing’s statistical contribu­
tions are too complex to go into here. (Indeed, much 
of this information was until recently still classified 
and, perhaps for this reason, Good’s initial papers on 
the subject do not even describe the specific crypt- 
analytic techniques developed by Turing; they give 
instead only a general idea of the type of statistical 
methods used. But in his most recent paper on this 
subject [22], Jack Good does provide a detailed pic­
ture of the various cryptanalytic techniques that Tur­
ing developed at Bletchley Park.) Three of Turing’s 
most important statistical contributions were:
1. his discovery, independently of Wald, of some 
form of sequential analysis;
2. his anticipation of empirical Bayes methods (later 
further developed in the 1950s by Good and inde­
pendently by Herbert Robbins); and

ZABELL: Alan Turing and the Central Limit Theorem
59
3. his use of logarithms of the Bayes factor (termed by 
Good the “weight of evidence”) in the evaluation 
and execution of decryption.
(For many references to the concept of weight of 
evidence, see, for example, [23] and the two indices 
of [20].) The units for the logarithms, base 10, were 
termed bans and decibans [18]:
One reason for the name ban was that tens of 
thousand of sheets of paper were printed in the 
town of Banbury on which weights of evidence 
were entered in decibans for carrying out an 
important process called Banburismus.....
“Tens of thousands of sheets of paper  ”Thissen- 
tence makes it clear that Turing’s contributions in this 
area were not mere idle academic speculation, but an 
integral part of the process of decryption employed 
at Bletchley.
One episode is particularly revealing as to the im­
portance with which the Prime Minister, Winston 
Churchill, viewed the cryptanalytic work at Bletchley. 
On October 21, 1941, frustrated by bureaucratic iner­
tia, Turing, Welchman, Alexander, and Milner-Barry 
wrote a letter directly to Churchill (headed “Secret 
and Confidential; Prime Minister only”) complaining 
that inadequate personnel had been assigned to them; 
immediately upon its receipt Churchill sent a memo to 
his principal staff officer directing him to “make sure 
they have all they want on extreme priority and report 
to me that this had been done” ([26], pp. 219-221).
Much of I. J. Good’s own work in statistics dur­
ing the decades immediately after the end of the war 
was a natural outgrowth of his cryptanalytic work 
during it; this includes both his 1950 book, Proba­
bility and the Weighing of Evidence, and his papers 
on the sampling of species (e.g., [15]) and the esti­
mation of probabilities in large sparse contingency 
tables (much of it summarized in [16]). Some of this 
work was stimulated either directly (see, e.g., [17], 
p. 936) or indirectly (the influence being somewhat 
remote, however, in the case of contingency tables) 
by Turing’s ideas:
Turing did not publish these war-time statis­
tical ideas because, after the war, he was too 
busy working on the ground floor of computer 
science and artificial intelligence. I was im­
pressed by the importance of his statistical ideas, 
for other applications, and developed and pub­
lished some of them in various places (see [21], 
p. 211).

Honor to Green
Among the centenaries of mathematicians and scien­
tists celebrated in 1993, perhaps the most remark­
able was the bicentenary of the birth of a pro­
fessional miller and part-time mathematician, one 
George Green (1793-1841) of Sneinton, then near 
Nottingham. Among other achievements, he was the 
creator of theorems and functions now named after 
him which make him a principal contributor to poten­
tial theory and to its applications in mechanics and 
mathematical physics.
During the week corresponding to that of his birth 
(which occurred on 14 July) various events took 
place. A three-day conference was held at the Univer­
sity of Nottingham, mainly on the use of his work in 
modern mathematics and physics. It included a visit 
to the mill at Sneinton which had been restored and 
opened as a science center in 1985. The next day a 
stained glass window was dedicated at the Gonville 
and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was resident 
from 1833 to 1837 as an extremely mature student, 
and (only) for the winter of 1839-1840 as a Fellow. 
Finally, on Friday 16 July a meeting was held at the 
Royal Society of London on his life and work and the 
modern importance of the latter. It was followed by a 
quite exceptional event: the unveiling of a plaque in 
his memory in the floor of the nave of Westminster 
Abbey, close to the tomb of Isaac Newton and to the 
plaques for his first publicist Lord Kelvin, Michael 
Faraday and Clerk Maxwell.
These events had been preceded by the publication 
in May of an excellent biography of Green [5]—a 
daunting task to write, as his life is so obscure (for 
example, no surviving likeness or portrait has ever 
been found, and his manuscripts seem to have been 
destroyed). It is clear, though, that in virtual isolation 
at Sneinton he taught himself Continental mathemat­
ics, and produced first-class research work. It was 
published in 1828 (his 35th year) as a 72-page Es­
say on the Mathematical Analysis of Electricity and 
Magnetism [11], put out at his own expense with the 
help of a subscription list. Largely ignored during the 
author’s lifetime, it has since been reprinted no less 
than seven times and translated into German. How 
and why was it created?
2 
Three strands in
eighteenth-century mechanics
One of the most profound influences exercised by 
this fugitive work is that it raised both the status of 
potential theory in mathematics and the quality of the 
theorems that could be stated in it. Prior to this time 
three strands of thought in potential theory (as we 
now understand it) were active, though not necessarily 
with close links between them ([26], Vol. 1).
The most significant strand was the attraction of 
spheroids to an external point. Isaac Newton had 
found various special properties in the Principia, in 
his synthetic style: they were extended from the 1770s 
onwards by P. S. Laplace and A. M. Legendre using 
analytical methods, especially the Legendre functions 
and surface and zonal harmonics.
Another line came from Alexis Clairaut on the 
Continent from the 1730s (with some contributions 
from Colin MacLaurin in Britain soon afterwards), 
where properties of equipotential surfaces were stud­
ied; this work laid stress on the exact differential of a 
function of several variables, and assisted in the birth 
61

62
Analysis
soon afterwards of the full partial differential calcu­
lus. With d’Alembert, some aspects of Euler’s work, 
and especially J. L. Lagrange, variational mechanics 
was developed, in which force and velocity poten­
tials were often used in the formation of differential 
equations.
A third strand grew out of Daniel Bernoulli’s Hy- 
drodynamica (1738), where considerations of ‘ascen- 
sis actualis et potentialis’ led to conservation of en­
ergy as a basis for (much) mechanics; his notions 
were to end up in the next century as kinetic and po­
tential energy, respectively, although with substantial 
changes in conception in which potential theory was 
to play a role.
In addition, an isolated contribution came from 
Lagrange in 1762. While pondering ways of solving 
the equations for the propagation of sound in three 
dimensions, he formed volume integrals of the solu­
tion in each coordinate direction, integrated them by 
parts to create surface integrals, and then added up 
the resulting equations to obtain a simpler differential 
equation to integrate. A clever but ad hoc manoeu­
vre, it had little influence even upon its distinguished 
innovator; but it was closer to the way ahead pursued 
in the early nineteenth century than the strands just 
mentioned.

Poisson and the appearance 
of divergence theorems
Enter Simeon-Denis Poisson (1781-1840), the lead­
ing supporting actor in this drama, student and then 
professor and graduation examiner at the Ecole Poly­
technique, devout follower of Laplace and Lagrange 
in mathematical methods and physical modeling. 
Poisson inaugurated mathematical electrostatics (I 
shall use the word ‘electricity’ of the time) in two pa­
pers ([16], [18]) published by the Paris Academy of 
Sciences, in which he analyzed arrangements studied 
experimentally by C. A. Coulomb 30 years previ­
ously; equilibrium on a charged spheroid, and be­
tween two spheres. The principal mathematical ex­
ercise was to modify Legendre functions and related 
potential theory to fit the assumptions made about the 
phenomena ([10], pp. 496-513).
In a short paper written soon after these two [17], 
Poisson rectified an important oversight of his masters 
when he pointed out that the differential equation 
governing the potential V to a body A relative to an 
interior point M was not Laplace’s equation
AV = 0 (with ‘A’ as the Laplacian operator), (1) 
but
A V = — 4 np, 
(2)
where p was the density of material at M .He might 
have got this insight from his recent work on electric­
ity; another strong candidate is a paper of that year on 
the attraction of spheroids by Carl Friedrich Gauss, 
which contained a result which in vectors reads
d ds.r = 0 or — 4n, 
(3)
S
where r = BM and B is an arbitrary point in A, 
according as M is outside or inside the surface S of 
A. Neither man dealt with the case where M is on S, 
when — 2n obtains in (2) ([10], pp. 418-424).
Twelve years later Poisson came to the Academy 
of Sciences with another pair of papers, this time an­
alyzing magnetism ([21], [22]). Taking a magnetic 
body A to be composed of discrete ‘magnetic ele­
ments’ D, he set to zero certain surface integrals over 
D expressing internal equilibrium, and wrote down 
volume integrals to state the components of attraction 
of A to an external point M relative to his imposed 
rectangular coordinate system (x, y, z). The second 
part of the first paper dealt with a ‘simplification of 
the preceding formulae’; integrating these integrals 
by parts with respect to (say) z led him to convert the 
volume integral to an integral over the surface S of 
A. I write his finding in the form
Hz(x,y,z)dxdydz
A
= 
H(xS,yS,zS)cosndS, 
(4)
S
where H was the function expressing the components 
of magnetic attraction, and n was the angle between 
the z-axis and the normal at the point (xS,yS ,zS) 
of S . Adding this formula to its brothers for the x- 
and y-directions gave him the first general divergence 
theorem in mathematics; imitating the notation of (4), 
it can be written
[Fx + Gy + Hz](x,y, z) dx dydz
= 
[F cosl + Gcosm + H cos n]
x (xs,ys,zs) dS. 
(5)
He modified it for the case when M was inside A by 
the manner of his proof of (2), and found a new term 
involving a factor — 4n/3.

GRATTAN-GUINNESS: Why did George Green Write his Essay of 1828 on Electricity and Magnetism
63
Poisson knew that his result was not restricted to 
convex bodies (a sum of integrals of the form (4) is 
required as the z-axis goes in and out of A), nor to 
magnetism. But he saw it simply as a convenience; 
triple integrals are replaced by double integrals ([10], 
pp. 948-953). This point will be crucial for Green, as 
we shall see in the next section.
In a third paper, published by the Academy in the 
Memoires [23], Poisson analyzed the process of mag­
netization in moving bodies. A most complicated 
analysis used Legendre functions, once again; but 
an important detail was his recollection of his equa­
tion (2) for interior points, and first presentation of 
the version with - 2np for surface points.
Surface integrals were enjoying a springtime in 
French mathematics at this time. For example, Adrien 
Marie Ampere had been studying electromagnetism 
and electrodynamics (his word) since 1820; his anal­
ysis made adroit use of both surface and line inte­
grals, the latter arising naturally in connection with 
the attraction caused by current-bearing wires ([10], 
pp. 941-961). One of his most remarkable results, 
published in 1826, was to show that Poisson’s ba­
sic formulae for magnetism could be restated in his 
own preferred conception, which saw magnetism as 
a special case of electricity and so replaced Poisson’s 
‘magnetic elements’ with a tiny electrical solenoid 
(his word again).
Another source was Joseph Fourier’s pioneering 
work on heat diffusion, created in the mid-1800s, fully 
published only in the early 1820s, especially in his 
book Theorie Analytique de la Chaleur (1822), and 
then receiving much attention from the new genera­
tion of French mathematicians. In particular, around 
1826 Jean Duhamel and Russian visitor Mikhail Os- 
trogradsky independently sought to justify mathemat­
ically Fourier’s use of trigonometric series solutions 
([10], pp. 1168-1176). Let f and g be two different 
special solutions for diffusion in a body A and con­
sider I := A fgdV. Integrating by parts through 
A led to a divergence theorem like Poisson’s (4); and 
applying Fourier’s external surface condition showed 
that in fact I =0. Hence f and g were orthogonal 
over A, like the sine and cosine functions. We can 
see that this does not provide the justification sought; 
more to the point is the use again of surface integrals 
and a divergence theorem.
Although these integrals were making an ap­
pearance, their presence in mathematics was still 
slight. Good evidence is provided by Augustin Louis 
Cauchy (1789-1857), former pupil of the Ecole Poly­
technique (when Poisson was professor) and now 
professor there himself, inaugurating his revision of 
the calculus and mathematical analysis by his famous 
new approach with the theory of limits at the centre, 
emphasis laid upon continuity of functions. (Pois­
son and others there protested vigorously.) Above all, 
the derivative and integral were defined separately, 
so that the fundamental theorem of calculus became 
a proper theorem for the first time ([10], pp. 707­
804, including Cauchy’s concurrent inauguration of 
complex-variable analysis). However, he never fur­
nished a definition of either the line or the surface 
integral, although the required forms of definition 
would not have been hard to devise; they were too 
marginal to be worth such attention.
Then Green started thinking.

Green and the place of 
surface integrals
Possible sources for Green’s essay will be appraised in 
the next section; here its main contents are described. 
Pages are cited from the printing in the edition of his 
works [12].
After various preliminaries, the essay contains two 
roughly equal parts on electricity and on magnetism, 
in that order. These latter analyses draw heavily on 
various largely known integral expressions to state ex­
ternal and internal potentials (the latter maybe learned 
from Poisson’s (2)), and Legendre functions to ex­
press the potentials in analytical form. He extended 
various results due to Poisson, and considered some 
variant situations, such as when the spheres are con­
nected by a wire [27].
The chief novelties were presented in the ‘gen­
eral preliminary results’ stated in the opening. First 
was the explicit specification of ‘the potential func­
tion’, as he called it, and now named after him ([11], 
pp. 9-10):
It only remains therefore to find a function V' 
which satisfies the partial differential equation, 
becomes equal to [a given function] V' when 
[the point] p is upon the surface A, vanishes 
when p is at an infinite distance from A, and 
is besides such that none of its differential co­
efficients shall be infinite when the point p is 
exterior to A.
(Note the inadequate specification of V' (<x), and 
that the prime does not denote differentiation.) This 
formulation anticipated in certain ways the ‘Dirich­
let principle’, which was to assume such status in

potential theory when its author began lecturing on 
the subject from 1839 in Berlin: a decade earlier he 
also was in Paris, but working on Fourier’s heat the­
ory, Cauchy’s analysis, and number theory.
Secondly was Green’s type of divergence theorem, 
expressed entirely within the rectangular coordinate 
system (x, y, z) rather than with surface differen­
tials of Poisson’s (4): for two ‘continuous functions’ 
U(x,y,z) and V (x, y, z),
d dxdydzUSV + j daU (dV/dw)
/ dxdydzV5U + J daV(dU/dw) (6) 
([11], p. 23). I follow his use of 5 for the Laplacian 
operator (an unusual symbol, perhaps required by the 
limitations of his printer’s font box), da for the el­
ement of the surface, all integrals stated with only 
one sign (unlike Poisson’s use of multiple integral 
signs), and round brackets to indicate partial ‘differ­
ential coefficients’ (Euler’s practice, and name also, 
both of which Green followed). He modified his re­
sult for ‘singularities’ in U (or V) at points G by 
adding in terms of the form -4nU(xG,yG, zG) to 
the appropriate side of the equation ([11], p. 27), like 
Poisson’s own modification; he may also have known 
of Poisson’s equation (2) from its reappearance in 
[23]. I wonder at the import of the continuity imposed 
upon U and V, and the reference to ‘singularities’; 
had he also been reading Cauchy on reforming the 
calculus?
Green had taken up a current research interest in 
mathematical physics in using volume and surface 
integrals to analyze electricity and magnetism; and 
with his insights he surpassed all contemporaries. 
This theorem (6), while similar in mathematical form 
to Poisson’s (5), was understood at a far deeper level 
as physics (and also surpassed Gauss’s (3) in general­
ity). Whereas Poisson saw only simplification in his 
integral, Green recognized that
the importance of his own theorem lay in relating 
properties inside bodies to properties on their 
surfaces and vice versa.
He must have realized that theorems of this kind 
served for multiple integral calculus like the fun­
damental theorem of the calculus itself, hence the 
importance of integration by parts.
These insights doubtless led Green further to the 
novelty of his function V' in which conditions in 
a body and on its surface were imposed. Such func­
tions were found for various cases with the help of his 
theorem; one of them followed it in its symmetrical 
form ([11], pp. 37-39), and launched what have be­
come known as ‘reciprocity relations’.
One may guess therefore, with some confidence, 
that
Poisson’s first two papers on magnetism were 
the source of inspiration for Green’s research, 
especially the divergence theorem (5).
Up to then Green had doubtless been learning math­
ematical skills and theories, but he had not found 
a deep problem: Poisson (unintentionally) provided 
this, in the form of an unexceptionable but somewhat 
limited use of Legendre functions to analyze the dis­
tribution of magnetism, and especially in a ‘simpli­
fication’ which held much deeper consequences than 
its author had realized.
5 
Sources and influences
While it is possible to guess at Green’s original moti­
vation, his training in mathematics remains unknown. 
Among local figures, headmaster John Toplis (1774­
1857) would have been a crucial figure in forming the 
interests of his former pupil at Nottingham Grammar 
School: a deplorer ofthe state of British mathematics 
in the Philosophical Magazine in 1804, a translator 
of Lacroix there a year later, and of Book One of 
Laplace’s Mecanique Celeste in a book published in 
Nottingham in 1814. However, in 1819 he returned 
to his college (Queens’, Cambridge), and was not 
to be one of the subscribers. The only other likely 
supporter is Sir Edward Bromhead (1789-1855: so 
Green’s senior by a mere four years), member with 
Charles Babbage and John Herschel of the Analyt­
ical Society at Cambridge in the mid-1810s, and a 
subscriber to the essay; but his letter of April 1828 
acknowledging receipt of his presentation copy ([5], 
p. 67) shows that he had not been aware of its contents 
before it arrived.
Green’s access to literature is also little under­
stood. In his essay he cited as mathematical sources 
Laplace’s Mecanique Celeste, Book 3 (1799) for 
Legendre functions, Fourier’s Theorie Analytique de 
la Chaleur, and of course, Poisson’s three papers on 
magnetism and the two on electricity; Boit’s Traite 
de Physique (1816) was used for information on 
Coulomb’s experiments. A passing reference ([11], 
p. 103) to Lagrange’s follower L. F. A. Arbogast shows 
his familiarity with some of the current French oper­
ator techniques. A sentence in his introduction com­
paring Fourier with Cauchy and Poisson on methods

65
of solving differential equations in hydrodynamics 
([11], p. 8) suggests that he had read the paper [8] on 
precisely this matter, which had been published in a 
Paris journal ([10], pp. 683-686).
How did Green gain access to these works? While 
British texts would have been available in the local 
library, access there to foreign literature is much less 
certain, even presuming that he had funds available 
to buy it. The point is particularly perplexing for 
journals—in particular, the Paris Memoires with its 
Poisson papers. How did Green know that those pa­
pers were published there in the first place? Although 
presentations to the Academy were reported in Paris 
journals and sometimes abroad, the news did not cir­
culate very much, and Poisson had not given any 
warning in earlier papers that research in magnetism 
was in progress. The best chance was that some sum­
mary version was translated into a foreign language 
such as English—and indeed this did happen to sum­
maries of these two papers, in the Quarterly Journal 
of Science ([19], [20]).
Each summary paper began with a virtually ver­
batim repeat of parts of the opening preamble of the 
parent paper, and then summarized some later re­
sults and features. The accounts concentrated mostly 
on physical and experimental aspects; mathematical 
procedures were only mentioned (and three formu­
lae quoted in the second summary), although not in 
a manner to reveal any major novelties. In particu­
lar, the divergence theorem (5) was described only in 
general terms, and with reference to simplication: ‘by 
means of certain transformations, the triple integrals 
which they contain are reduced to double integrals, 
and the equations become much more simple’ ([19], 
p. 327). No reader of the time could have guessed 
that surface integrals were involved; but Green might 
have been alerted to watch out for the full versions of 
the papers.
Regarding timetable, the volume of the Paris 
Academy Memoires containing these papers appeared 
right at the end of 1826 ([1], p. 473). Allowing for 
the usual delay for ships to deliver copies across the 
channel, one can guess that the spring of 1827 was in 
hand before Green read at least Poisson’s first paper 
and had his inspiration. Since his essay was to appear 
in April 1828, this would have given him a maxi­
mum of around a year to carry out the research—not 
an excessive time, even for a part-time mathemati­
cian. His motivation was high, most of the required 
skills and familiarity with the literature were already 
available—and above all his ideas were fruitful, so 
that the fruit would grow freely and quickly.

Options for publication
However, in contrast to this splendid piece of research 
and development, Green’s sales and marketing were 
hopeless. He cannot be blamed for his scientific iso­
lation in Nottingham, but he was somewhat naive 
in resorting to the traditions of publication by pub­
lic subscription. For the increase in scientific activ­
ity in Britain in recent years, together with advances 
in printing technology, had raised the chances and 
opportunities for publication, especially for an au­
thor like him with financial means available to assist 
with the costs of production. He could have tried 
Deighton’s of Cambridge, who were then publishing 
quite a lot in mathematics [9] and in fact stocked the 
essay when it came out; or maybe Taylor (now Taylor 
and Francis), regular producers of scientific books. He 
could have written a paper summarizing his findings 
for their Philosophical Magazine, which was widely 
distributed in the scientific world: although it did not 
publish mathematics frequently, there were papers 
from time to time, and indeed there had been an ex­
change in there in 1826 on another aspect of potential 
theory (namely, properties of equipotential surfaces) 
between Poisson and the Scottish-born mathemati­
cian James Ivory ([10], pp. 1190-1195). In fact, ifhe 
had felt it proper so to act he could have sought advice 
from Ivory, the mathematician most conversant with 
potential theory in Britain at that time. He might also 
have treated his manuscript as a long paper instead 
of a short book, and tried to submit it to the Royal 
Society, or the Cambridge Philosophical Society, or 
the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
I have no doubt that Green never considered any of 
these possibilities. His essay went to his 52 supporting 
subscribers, most of whom could not have read a 
page of it ([13], pp. 45-48); and so it vanished from 
sight. Very rarely has it appeared even in booksellers’ 
catalogues.
7 
On Green’s second period
Green’s later career was somewhat less unorthodox 
than previously, in as much as he was resident at 
Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (Bromhead’s 
alma mater) from 1833 to 1837 and for some months 
of 1839-1840 as a Fellow. He had a small overlap 
in residence with someone capable of understand­
ing his work, indeed the first mathematician to cite 
the essay; but this was the eccentric Robert Mur­
phy (1806-1843), who spoilt a promising career by 
financial incompetence. [On Green’s and Murphy’s 

66
Analysis
work see [6]; the reference to Green’s book is in [15]. 
The nature of Murphy’s misdemeanors has not been 
clear; my information comes from a letter [7] of per­
haps 1835 to Babbage written by Augustus De Mor­
gan, who was Professor in London University, where 
Murphy was then trying to make a living (British Li­
brary, Additional Mss. 37189, no. 241). Compare [5], 
pp. 112-113.]
Green published eight papers (and a supplement 
to one of them), mostly in the Transactions of the 
Cambridge Philosophical Society with Bromhead as 
communicator. However, his lack of marketing skills 
were again to the fore: he cited his essay only twice 
([12], pp. 120, 192), and on neither occasion did he 
even give the reader the publication details, never 
mind a comment to explain its importance.
The other papers fall into two partly related groups, 
both showing strong French influence in both con­
tent and methodology ([3], Ch. 13). One group deals 
with elastic bodies, which could be construed to be 
physically bending objects, or else the elastic ether 
(and perhaps with luck, both at once). The task was 
to study the propagation of longitude and transverse 
vibrations; Green also tackled the difficult question 
of behavior at the interface between different sub­
stances. He sought generality by making no stipu­
lations about the constituted properties of the sub­
stances. The principal influence seems to have been 
the non-molecular studies of elasticity made from 
1827 onwards by Cauchy, which had been partly 
inspired by Fresnel’s work in waval optics ([28], 
Ch. 5).
The other group examined the potentials of flu­
ids, which again might cover sound and water, but 
also the supposed electric and magnetic fluids. Green 
made this analogy quite explicit in the title of the first 
of these papers, when referring to the ‘laws of the 
equilibrium of fluids analogous to the electric fluid’ 
([12], p. 117).
For methods Green used both his function and the­
orem, and some of the special results from his essay. 
He played a little more with operator methods, and 
produced some solutions in terms of elliptic integrals 
(although he seemed to be unaware of the recently 
introduced elliptic functions). A paper on the mo­
tion of waves and canals took a step towards the ap­
proximating asymptotic solution method now known 
as ‘WKB’ ([24], pp. 309-314), although he limited 
himself to working within the linearizing models of 
his time. He worked with potentials to the inverse 
nth power; and on one occasion he required of his 
potential function that it be invariant under infinitely 
small rotations, a step that Sophus Lie was to bring 
(independently) to great generality and prominence 
60 years later.
Somewhat separate from Green’s other papers was 
one dealing with the motion of the ‘simple’ pendu­
lum. This was a favorite topic at this time, a typical 
example of small-effect science; for the pendulum 
was required to work to a great degree of accuracy 
for the purposes of geodesy. Laplace and Poisson, and 
also F. W. Bessel and G. B. Airy, had been among its 
many earlier students [29].
8 
Recognition
Green’s marketing skills increased at least to the ex­
tent that he sent some of these papers to Carl Jacobi 
([5], p. 104; the copies are in private possession), and 
presumably while at Cambridge he gave copies of his 
essay to William Hopkins, who passed either two or 
three copies on to the young William Thomson (1824­
1907) in 1845. [One of these copies of Green’s essay 
is now kept at Nottingham ([5], p. 105).] Then, as is 
famously known, the essay found its first enthusiastic 
reader, four years after the death of its author in 1841. 
Thomson introduced the name ‘Green’s theorem’, and 
soon came to his ‘method of images’ as a result of 
reading the analysis in the essay of the effect on the 
electrical charge in a body at an interior/exterior point 
of a source at a given exterior/interior point ([11], 
pp. 50-54). He soon arranged for the essay to be 
reprinted in Crelle’s journal, although it did not appear 
until 1850-1854. [The circumstances of this reprint­
ing of the essay are strange. Firstly, Thomson asked 
Crelle and not his friend Joseph Liouville, who also 
edited a journal (still often known after Liouville) and 
was actively interested in potential theory. Secondly, 
while Crelle had agreed enthusiastically to the sug­
gestion by 1846 ([13], pp. 41-43), he did not reprint 
it for several years, and then in three parts over five 
years.] Later he and P. G. Tait called the Dirichlet prin­
ciple ‘Green’s problem’ ([25], arts. 499-518). The 
name ‘Green’s function’ for functions satisfying con­
ditions like Green’s own is due to Bernhard Riemann 
and Carl Neumann ([4], art. 18).
Today, Green’s function and his theorem are ex­
tolled because of the roles which they continue to 
play in modern physics and in engineering; but it 
would be a misunderstanding of history to think that 
their importance is due to these applications. On the 
contrary, their rise occurred during the period of clas­
sical physics, when there appeared a mountainous 
production of books and papers on potential theory

and its use in mathematical physics [2]; all the appli­
cations mentioned above were involved, and in due 
course new ones such as thermodynamics and mete­
orology, and also mathematical economics. All major 
applied mathematicians took part, along with many 
minor ones, and some pure mathematicians also (in 
particular Karl Weierstrass, who sabotaged standard 
methods of manipulation in 1870 with his famous 
counter-example to the Dirichlet principle using the 
inverse tangent function).
Not only Green’s insights and results were used 
by his successors; his own work, especially the es­
say, were made available four times in the last thirty 
years of the nineteenth century to an extent surpass­
ing all other literature of his own time. The edition 
of his works by N. Ferrers appeared in London in 
1871, and was reprinted in facsimile in 1903 in (of 
all places) Paris. The essay itself was also reprinted 
in facsimile, in 1890 in Berlin, in a series of clas­
sic reprints of science; five years later it appeared 
in an annotated German translation by A. van Oet- 
tingen and A. Wangerin, in Wilhelm-Ostwald’s fa­
mous booklet series of editions of major scientific 
works. Green’s successors in the classical phase not 
only absorbed his contributions into their own her­
itage; they wanted to read the words of the master 
himself.
Their modern successors have maintained the tra­
dition; for Ferrers’s edition appeared again in 1970, 
and the Essay itself in 1993, in the university of his 
home town Nottingham, as part of their bicentennial 
celebrations of their remarkable citizen.

Connectivity and Smoke-Rings: 
Green’s Second Identity in its First Fifty Years
THOMAS ARCHIBALD
Mathematics Magazine 62 (1989), 219-232
Introduction
James Clerk Maxwell, in his review of Thomson and 
Tait’s Treatise on Natural Philosophy, noted an im­
portant innovation in the authors’ approach to math­
ematics ([8], Vol. 2, p. 777):
The first thing which we observe in the arrange­
ment of the work is the prominence given to 
kinematics, . . . and the large space devoted un­
der this heading to what has been hitherto con­
sidered part of pure geometry. The theory of 
curvature of lines and surfaces, for example, has 
long been recognized as an important branch of 
geometry, but in treatises on motion it was re­
garded as lying as much outside of the subject 
as the four rules of arithmetic or the binomial 
theorem.
The guiding idea however...is that geometry 
itself is part of the science of motion, and that 
it treats, not of the relations between figures al­
ready existing in space, but of the process by 
which these figures are generated by the motion 
of a point or a line.
This “guiding idea,” which treats geometric entities 
as physical objects in some sense, had been influen­
tial with mathematicians for many years. Countless 
mathematical problems have their origin in the inves­
tigation of the natural world. However, it also happens 
that the solutions of some problems may be facilitated 
by attributing physical properties to the mathematical 
objects under study. In addition, mathematical con­
structs usually thought of as “purely geometric” may 
be created by considering such mathematico-physical 
entities.
It is my purpose in this article to illustrate some 
aspects of the cross-fertilization of mathematics and 
physics by examining the development of Green’s 
second identity (known to physicists as Green’s theo­
rem) and its generalizations over a fifty-year period, 
from 1828 to 1878. During this period, despite an 
increased emphasis on logical rigor in some circles, 
many mathematicians continued to accept physical 
proofs of analytic theorems as valid. Such proofs used 
hypothetical physical properties such as incompress­
ibility to characterize the regions in space; this trend 
was found most strongly in nineteenth-century British 
mathematics, though it was not unknown elsewhere.

Analysis
The integration on the left is performed over a re­
gion bounded by a closed surface S. The integral on 
the right is then a surface integral over S, and n is 
an outward normal to S. Finally, ^ and ^ are con­
tinuously differentiable real-valued functions (scalar 
fields) on R3 . This theorem first appeared in a pa­
per by George Green published in 1828, along with 
a number of other lemmas which Green employed 
in his study of electrostatics and magnetism. Green’s 
results remained virtually unknown, however, until 
William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) obtained two 
copies of Green’s pamphlet in 1845. Green’s results 
subsequently became widely known, and were cen­
tral to the mathematical theory of potential, one of 
the most important tools of mathematical physics in 
the following decades.
Potential theory had originated as a body of results 
which arose in connection with the efforts of French 
mathematical physicists (notably Poisson, Laplace, 
and Biot), to extend the methods of Newton. Laplace 
attempted to explain many natural phenomena as the 
result of forces proportional to the inverse square 
of the distance between the interacting objects. To 
achieve this, it was necessary to determine the in­
tegrals of vector forces. Laplace showed that such 
forces could be treated as what we now term the gra­
dient of a scalar function, and hence was able to sim­
plify the calculations greatly. Such a function, the 
gradient of which is a force, is known as a potential 
for that force. (We will also see velocity potentials in 
the course of this article, which are functions the gra­
dient of which gives a velocity.) Like that of Laplace, 
Green’s work was a contribution both to mathemati­
cal physics and to potential theory, since it expresses 
relationships between potentials and their integrals as 
well as applying the results to physical problems [4].
At its beginning, the idea of potential was a math­
ematical convenience. However, by the 1850s it had 
acquired physical interpretations. In particular, if a 
vector function has a potential, the integral of that po­
tential along a curve depends only on the endpoints of 
the integration, and integrals around closed paths are 
zero. This expresses the fact that the vector function 
is an exact differential. Physically, this implies that 
the force described by the function is conservative, 
so that potential functions are closely associated with 
potential energy.
Green’s 1828 essay
Green’s paper, which was published privately in 
Nottingham in 1828, was called An Essay on the 
Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theo­
ries of Electricity and Magnetism [1]. George Green 
(1793-1841), a miller’s son, had been given access 
to the library of a local aristocrat interested in sci­
ence. This opportunity, and Green’s ability, permitted 
him to master basic works by Laplace, Lagrange, and 
Poisson. Inspired by Laplace’s work on gravitation 
and Poisson’s on electrostatics and magnetism, Green 
set forth to investigate electrostatics using similar hy­
potheses but new methods.
Of particular interest to us are Green’s general 
mathematical theorems, presented at the beginning 
of the paper, which he later applied to particular elec­
trical and magnetic calculations. Green’s second iden­
tity is the key theorem in this section. It is the essential 
tool in solving the Laplace equation and the Poisson 
equation by the method which Green introduced. A 
detailed discussion of this method, today known as 
the method of Green’s functions, would take us too 
far afield.
In modern notation, the identity Green proved was
#7™2 Vd3 x+77'
= JU V V2 Ud3 x +

//■ V^

Here U andV are any two functions which are contin­
uously differentiable in the region of differentiation, 
and n is now the inward normal from the surface a. 
Green used the symbol 6 to express what we have 
denoted by V2 . Green’s proof of this identity rests on 
applying integration by parts to the expression
/•/•/• (dVdu dVdu dVduy

Assuming u, V are sufficiently differentiable, we can 
integrate by parts in each variable. For example, let
u = —— dx and v = —— dx.

Green then argued that, if a is a surface element and 
n an inward normal, we have
dydz V (x 1)^—1 — V (x o) —'

Hence the partial integral becomes
[[ dydz( d dVdUd\ = ff dJhx vdU

—/// Vd2.
Consequently, the result of integration with respect to 
all three variables gives
dxdydz (VV) • (VU)
=—# d^—<VV2U 
(3)
This is often known as Green’s first identity. By sym­
metry, we may interchange U and V in (3) to obtain 
the second identity:
/hu— 7/VV V2U
= — // daudV — f V V ’ U
Many present-day niceties in the proof of this identity 
were not considered by Green. A full proof involves 
dealing properly with the relationship between the 
infinitesimals and the finite, and we must use the 
equivalence of multiple and iterated integrals, which 
Green did not distinguish. The advances in rigorous 
analysis due to Cauchy may well have been unknown 
to Green at this time, since he mentions his limited 
access to the latest work. Instead his arguments rely 
on the geometry of infinitesimals. In this, his work 
resembles that of most of his contemporaries, even in 
France.
Green’s work went almost entirely unnoticed for 
many years. None of the private subscribers who pur­
chased the pamphlet appears to have been capable 
of appreciating its worth, and his results and meth­
ods remained little known [2]. Green’s work might 
have been forgotten had it not been mentioned by the 
Irish electrician Robert Murphy. Murphy referred to 
Green as the originator of the term potential, though 
Murphy’s own definition of potential was erroneous, 
indicating that he had not actually seen Green’s work 
(see [13], pp. 1-2 and 126 for more about Murphy).
Green himself did not revive interest in his earlier 
work. His efforts in the interim were devoted to fur­
ther research, and to an education at Cambridge. His 
other papers met a happier immediate reception; sev­
eral were published in the Transactions of the Cam­
bridge Philosophical Society, where they attracted 
the interest of the British scientific community. Green 
thus made a name for himself before his death in 1841, 
though his reputation was considerably enhanced by 
the rediscovery of the 1828 Essay.
William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin
Thomson rediscovers Green
It was William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) who 
first drew the attention of the international scientific 
world to Green’s results. Sometime in 1842 Thomson 
had read a reference by Murphy to Green’s paper; 
his interest was piqued for several reasons. Thomson 
was himself then engaged in research on the theory 
of attraction, and published papers on the subject in 
1842 and 1843. Murphy had referred to Green’s use 
of the term potential, a notion which, as Thomson 
states, was also employed by Gauss with great success 
in his 1839 paper on inverse-square forces. Thomson 
doubtless wondered how Green, whose name he knew 
well, had employed the notion of potential, and was 
curious about the exact nature of his results.
Thomson was unable to see a copy of Green’s work 
until January 25, 1845, shortly before he was about to 
embark on a trip to France following the completion 
of his studies at Cambridge. By chance, Thomson’s 
tutor, Hopkins, had two copies which he had appar­
ently never examined, and sent them with Thomson.

Thomson was very impressed with the generality of 
Green’s results, and was soon endeavoring to apply 
them in his own research. On his arrival in France, 
Thomson showed the paper to Liouville, Sturm, and 
Chasles, among others. Soon the Paris mathematical 
community was well aware of Green’s work: for ex­
ample, Liouville gave Green and Gauss equal credit 
for the introduction of the term potential in an 1847 
paper ([7] p. 174). Thomson sent the other copy of 
Green’s paper to Germany with Cayley, who deliv­
ered it to August Crelle, editor of the Journal fur die 
Reine und Angewandte Mathematik. Crelle published 
a translation of Green’s paper in three installments 
between 1850 and 1854, hence it became well known 
to interested researchers in Germany. Thus, 25 years 
after Green’s original publication, his methods began 
to find their way into the scientific literature and text­
books of Europe ([12], pp. 113-119). One of the first 
to make use of Green’s work was Bernhard Riemann 
(1826-1866), who was then writing his doctoral dis­
sertation at Gottingen.
Riemann and multiply-connected 
regions
Riemann’s principal interest in Green’s work was in 
the method of Green’s functions, which Green had 
used to solve boundary-value problems involving 
functions satisfying Laplace’s equation
V2 <p = 0.
Here <p is to be interpreted as the potential function 
of the electrostatic force due to a charge density on 
a conductor. Riemann, however, noticed that Green’s 
methods could be useful in the study of functions of 
a complex variable, since the real and complex parts 
of such functions must satisfy Laplace’s equation. 
Employing this insight, Riemann developed methods 
that enabled him to specify a complex function by 
its boundary values and discontinuities. In so doing, 
Riemann presented the idea of multiply-connected re­
gions of the plane: a region is simply connected if a 
cross-cut divides it in two, and has connectivity equal 
to the number of cuts taken to separate it. (See Fig. 1.) 
This notion was published in Riemann’s dissertation 
(1851) and found wider circulation with the appear­
ance of his paper on abelian integrals (1857) [9]. It 
was here that it was seen by Hermann von Helmholtz, 
who was attempting to employ Green’s ideas in a dif­
ferent way.
Helmholtz and vortices
Hermann von Helmholtz’s 1858 paper On Integrals 
of Hydrodynamic Equations which yield Vortex Mo­
tion was also deeply influenced by Green’s work [3]. 
Helmholtz (1821-1894) had become interested in the 
solution of boundary-value problems in fluid mechan­
ics in connection with his investigation of the physi­
ology of the ear. (He was at that time a professor of 
anatomy in Bonn ([6], pp. 307-312).) Furthermore, 
Helmholtz saw a parallel between certain problems 
in hydrodynamics and problems in electromagnetic 
theory, a long-standing interest of his. Attempts to 
provide a detailed theoretical treatment of the analogy 
between electromagnetic theory and fluid dynamics 
may have been sparked by the superficial resemblance 
between electrical and hydrodynamical phenomena. 
The electric current was widely viewed in the mid­
nineteenth century as the flow of one or two “electric 
fluids” along a conductor. The motion of this fluid 
produces a magnetic effect. Andre-Marie Ampere 
demonstrated in the 1820s that magnetism may be 
explained as the result of hypothetical microscopic 
electric currents in a body, and hence the existence of 
the electromagnetic phenomenon should mean that 
a current gives rise to other currents. If the original 
current flows in a straight line, the currents respon­
sible for magnetic effects must be helical, forming 
microscopic vortices.

73
The researches of Helmholtz and others in this 
area aimed to make this rather vague picture precise. 
In the 1858 paper, Helmholtz examined the follow­
ing question: suppose we are given a closed con­
tainer filled with a frictionless incompressible fluid. 
How does action on the boundary of the container 
affect the motion inside? Helmholtz apparently saw 
the value of Green’s theorems in such an investiga­
tion soon after reading Green’s paper, but was kept 
from working out his ideas because of other academic 
obligations. However, Helmholtz had also recently 
read Riemann’s paper of 1857, which made it clear 
to him that Green’s theorem could only be used when 
the regions involved were simply connected. This is 
because functions with potentials—what we would 
now term conservative vector fields—may in fact be 
multiple-valued in multiply-connected regions.
Let us discuss how Helmholtz used Green’s theo­
rem. He began with Euler’s equation of fluid dynam­
ics, which we may write in vector notation as
F = - Vp + (d+v V v,
(4)
V • v = 0. 
(5)
Here p is the density of the fluid, p the pressure, v the 
velocity. Helmholtz supposed that
F = VV, 
where V is a force potential
and
v = Vp, where p is a velocity potential.
From (5) we have that p satisfies Laplace’s equa­
tion, since V • v = V2 p = 0. Helmholtz then noted 
that this implies
V x v = V x (Vp) = 0.
Bernhard Riemann
If the walls of the container are rigid, this means 
that the component of velocity perpendicular to the 
boundary is zero. Hence, if n is an outward normal, 
dp/dn is equal to zero everywhere. But by Green’s 
first identity,
jjj (VU •VV) dx3
=# V^ds - HLv V 2 Udx 3.
If U = V = p we have
Iff,(Vp )2 dx 3 = // pdnds=0 •
remembering that V2 p =0. Thus Vp =0, i.e., no 
motion is induced in the fluid. Hence, any motion 
of a fluid in a closed vessel (with simply-connected 
interior) which has a velocity potential must depend 
exclusively on a motion of the boundary. Helmholtz 
went on to show that a motion of the boundary 
uniquely determines such a motion in the fluid. A 
further important conclusion stated that vortices can 
only be produced by a motion which has no velocity 
potential. More important still, if vortices do exist 
initially, they are stable under the action of conser­
vative forces. Either they must be closed tubes, or 
else they extend from the boundary to the bound­
ary.
When vortices do exist one can consider the por­
tion of fluid without vortices as a multiply-connected 
region, the vortices being the “holes.” Thus to solve 
boundary value problems in such a region, one would 
ideally have an extension of Green’s theorem to deal 
with such cases. Helmholtz stressed the desirability 
of such a generalization, and noted that Riemann’s 
notion of connectivity could readily be extended to 
three dimensions for this purpose.
In Helmholtz’s work the geometric entities imme­
diately become physical. For one thing, they are three 
dimensional. Also the points of space become as­
sociated with the molecules of a fluid, and holes in 
the space correspond to vortices. In this instance, 
the geometric entities may be given clear physi­
cal interpretation, and physical questions (the so­
lution of specific boundary-value problems, for ex­
ample) dictate the mathematical problems which are 
important.

Analysis
Hermann von Helmholtz
Helmholtz’s research was received with greater 
sympathy by British mathematical physicists, espe­
cially Thomson, than by his German colleagues. This 
occurred in part because of the shared interests of 
Helmholtz and Thomson in hydrodynamic models for 
electromagnetic theory, an interest that arose because 
of their attitude toward the then-prevailing thought 
on electromagnetic theory in Germany. This theory, 
based on work by Gauss’s collaborator Wilhelm We­
ber, explained electrical phenomena on the basis of 
a velocity-dependent force law. Both Helmholtz and 
Thomson felt that such a force could not satisfy the 
energy conservation principle. Helmholtz apparently 
felt as well that his mathematical skills were dimly 
regarded by his German contemporaries, because he 
had not been formally trained as a mathematician. 
Thus it was among British mathematical physicists 
that Helmholtz’s papers were read with greatest inter­
est and understanding.
Tait, Thomson, smoke-rings 
and atoms
Helmholtz’s approach found an enthusiastic admirer 
in Peter Guthrie Tait (1837-1901), a Cambridge- 
educated Scot who was teaching in Belfast in 1858. 
Tait was attempting at that time to master William 
Rowan Hamilton’s method of quaternions, and to 
demonstrate the physical usefulness of the method 
by obtaining significant applications. In this respect 
Helmholtz’s work interested him, and he made an 
English translation for his own use ([12], p. 511).
A parenthetic note about quaternions: Nowadays, 
this set of objects is most likely to show up in algebra 
courses or proofs in algebraic number theory which 
can make use of its properties as a non-commutative 
division ring. This is quite remote from their original 
intended use in geometry and analysis. Hamilton in­
vented quaternions in 1843, and introduced with them 
the idea of operators. Particularly important was the 
del or nabla operator, our V. For Hamilton and Tait, 
a quaternion described a quotient of what we would 
term vectors; such a quotient consists of a 4-tuple 
which describes the stretch and the three rotations 
which bring an arbitrary pair of vectors into coinci­
dence ([11], pp. 37-38). Later on we shall see how 
Tait used this approach to obtain what he called “phys­
ical proofs” of analytic statements.
Tait moved to Edinburgh in 1860, where he be­
gan a collaboration with William Thomson, then at 
Glasgow. In 1866 and 1867 their collaboration was 
at its peak, as they prepared their Treatise on Natural 
Philosophy (which was to become the standard intro­
ductory physics text in Britain for decades). Early in 
1867, Tait showed Thomson an experimental demon­
stration of the stability properties of vortices by means 
of smoke-rings, as well as Helmholtz’s mathematical 
treatment of the problem. Thomson described this 
event to Helmholtz in a letter:
Just now, however, vortex motions have dis­
placed everything else, since a few days ago 
Tait showed me in Edinburgh a magnificent way 
of producing them. Take one side (or a lid) off 
a box (any old packing box will serve) and cut 
a large hole in the opposite side. Stop the open 
side AB loosely with a piece of cloth, and strike 
the middle of the cloth with your hand. If you 
leave anything smoking in the box, you will see 
a magnificent ring shot out by every blow.
Thomson then went on to describe what he found 
particularly interesting about the phenomenon and 
the theory.
The absolute permanence of the rotation, and the 
unchangeable relation you have proved between 
it and the portion of the fluid once acquiring such 
motion in a perfect fluid, shows that if there is a 
perfect fluid all through space, constituting the 
substance of all matter, a vortex-ring would be as 
permanent as the solid hard atoms assumed by 
Lucretius and his followers (and predecessors) 
to account for the permanent properties of bod­
ies... thus if two vortex rings were once created 
in a perfect fluid, passing through one another 
like links of a chain, they could never come into 
collision, or break one another, they would form 
an indestructible atom ([12], pp. 514-515).

Figure 2. William Thomson’s Knots
Thomson embarked on the mathematical theory of 
these apparently indestructible vortex atoms at once, 
and his results were read before the Royal Society 
of Edinburgh a little over three weeks later. His pa­
per On Vortex Motion, much augmented, appeared 
in 1878 [14]. Here he encountered and solved the 
problem posed by Helmholtz of extending Green’s 
theorem to multiply-connected regions. For in order 
to investigate the properties of vortex atoms, it was 
necessary to solve boundary value problems where 
complicated vortices (such as those pictured) formed 
part of the boundary. (See Fig. 2.)
In this paper, Thomson wrote the original version 
of Green’s theorem thus:
jjj Vv •Vv' dV
v~v da - JJJ vV2 v' dV 
v'-^p da - J’J’J’ v'V2 v dV.
Here v and v' must be single-valued. Thomson then 
investigated what happens if v' is multi-valued—that 
is to say, ifwe consider R to be a multiply-connected 
region, and then considered how to set the problem up 
in general. A multiply-connected space can be made 
simply connected by making cuts, or by inserting 
what Thomson calls “stopping barriers.” The integral 
around an (almost) closed path from one side of the 
barrier to the other has a constant value ki, which is 
the same for all such paths; such constants ki exist 
for all stopping barriers and the integral in question 
becomes
jjj Vv V dV 
dv' 
dv'
= JJ vdnda + S kdl dnd^
vV2 v dV
ff dv , sr, ft dv , , 
= JJ vnd^+ + ?kdj dnd"
v'V2 vdV
Here da' represents a surface element of the barrier 
surface.
Thus armed, Thomson was able to examine fluid 
motion in multiply-connected regions, concluding 
that the normal component of velocity of a fluid at 
every point of the boundary determines the motion in­
side a multiply-connected region (provided we know 
the circulation of the fluid in each region). He then 
considered how best to define the order of connec­
tivity, noting that for some of the surfaces shown the 
stopping barriers must be self-intersecting and diffi­
cult to distinguish. He therefore proposed a definition 
using what he called “irreconcilable paths”—which 
we would now call homotopy classes of closed paths 
with base point. He selected a point on the surface, 
and noted that the connectivity of the surface is de­
termined if we see how many mutually irreconcil­
able paths can be drawn on its surface. For a simply- 
connected region, for example, all closed paths on the 
surface are homotopic. Although this affords an un­
ambiguous definition of connectivity, it is not easily 

76
Analysis
possible using this method to get the generalization 
of Green’s theorem. For that the stopping barriers are 
required.
Thomson’s interest in vortex atoms thus led him 
directly to a generalization of Green’s theorem, and 
to the question of the proper definition of connectivity. 
His proof technique is in essence the same as that of 
Green, augmented by the stopping barriers, and it is 
this method that is usually taught today in courses on 
vector calculus.
Tait’s quaternion version of 
Green’s theorem
By the late 1860s, Tait’s interest in quaternions had 
turned into a crusade. To the British Association in 
1871, he said:
comparing a Cartesian investigation . . . with the 
equivalent quaternion one . . . one can hardly 
help making the remark that they contrast even 
more strongly than the decimal notation with the 
binary scale or with the old Greek arithmetic, or 
than the well-ordered subdivision of the metri­
cal system with the preposterous non-systems of 
Great Britain.
In the same address, Tait pointed out that from the 
quaternion point of view:
Green’s celebrated theorem is at once seen to be 
merely the well-known equation of continuity 
expressed for a heterogeneous fluid, whose den­
sity at every point is proportional to one electric 
potential, and its displacement or velocity pro­
portional to and in the direction of the electric 
force due to another potential [5].
Let us see exactly what he means. In his 1870 paper 
On Green’s and Other Allied Theorems, Tait supposed 
a spatial region R to be uniformly filled with points 
([10], pp. 136-150). If points inside and outside the 
regions are displaced by a vector then we may have 
a net decrease or increase of the volume—that is, of 
the number of points—in the region R. This can be 
calculated in two ways:
2. We can estimate the excess of those that pass in­
wards through the surface over those that pass out­
wards:
a a • nda 
(7)
(in Tait’s notation S • aUv dx).
The expressions (6) and (7) must be equal, yield­
ing what we now call the divergence theorem from 
the equation of continuity. If we consider that the 
density—for example, of electric fluid—is given by a 
potential P1 , and the displacement is proportional to 
a force a with potential P, then we have:
V(PP1) = PVP1 + P1VP
and
V1 2(PP1) = PV2P1 + P1V2P + 2(VP • VP1).
1. We can find the total increase in density throughout 
R
fl] div a dV 
(6)
(in Tait’s notation S -Vad)).
(8) 
But by the divergence theorem
V2(PP1)dV = 
div (VPP1) dV
= H (VPP1) • nda
JJ RR
= [[ (PVP1 + P1 VP) • n da.
JJdR
Hence, from (8),
(P (PVP1+ P1 VP) • nda
RJdR
= jjj (P V2 P1+ P1 V2 P) dV
+2 
VP •VP1 dV.
But the left side here, by the divergence theorem, is
jjj (P V2 P1 - P1V2 P) dV.
Combining these two yields Green’s theorem in the 
form
(V (VP •VP1) dV
= - /// P1 V  PdV + //.RPd.‘d'
2
= - HI PV P1 dV + II PdP- da.

Notice that the argument depends on treating geomet­
ric points as mobile physical entities, with continuity 
properties like those of a fluid.

We find Tait’s views nicely summarized in his 
1892 review of Poincare’s Thermodynamique ([5], 
p. 273):
Some forty years ago, in a certain mathemati­
cal circle at Cambridge, men were wont to de­
plore the necessity of introducing words at all in 
a physico-mathematical textbook: the unattain­
able, though closely approachable Ideal being 
regarded as a world devoid of aught but formu­
lae! But one learns something in forty years, 
and accordingly the surviving members of that 
circle now take a very different view of the mat­
ter. They have been taught alike by experience 
and by example to regard mathematics, so far 
at least as physical enquiries are concerned, as 
a mere auxiliary to thought ...this is one of the 
great truths which were enforced by Faraday’s 
splendid career.
Conclusion
Our excursion from Green to Tait has taken us from 
electrostatics and potential theory, via complex anal­
ysis and fluid dynamics, to homotopy classes of maps 
and vector analysis. While I have only touched on a 
few of the interesting problems associated with these 
developments, I hope that I have shown that physical 
thinking is important, not only in posing mathemat­
ical problems, but also in solving them. In partic­
ular, physical thinking may lead to the creation of 
certain mathematical notions, such as connectivity, 
which are of interest in their own right—for exam­
ple in the classification of the knots described by 
Thomson. Tait undertook this classification problem 
around 1870, achieving the first basic results of knot 
theory.

The History of Stokes’s Theorem
VICTOR J. KATZ
Mathematics Magazine 52 (1979), 146-156
Most current American textbooks in advanced calcu­
lus devote several sections to the theorems of Green, 
Gauss, and Stokes. Unfortunately, the theorems re­
ferred to were not original to these men. It is the 
purpose of this paper to present a detailed history of 
these results from their origins to their generalization 
and unification into what is today called the general­
ized Stokes’ theorem.
Origins of the theorems
The three theorems in question each relate a k- 
dimensional integral to a (k - 1)-dimensional inte­
gral; since the proof of each depends on the fun­
damental theorem of calculus, it is clear that their 
origins can be traced back to the late seventeenth 
century. Toward the end of the eighteenth century, 
both Lagrange and Laplace actually used the funda­
mental theorem and iteration to reduce k-dimensional 
integrals to those of one dimension less. However, the 
theorems as we know them today did not appear ex­
plicitly until the nineteenth century.
The first of these theorems to be stated and proved 
in essentially its present form was the one known to­
day as Gauss’s theorem or the divergence theorem. 
In three special cases it occurs in an 1813 paper of 
Gauss [8]. Gauss considers a surface (superficies) in 
space bounding a solid body (corpus). He denotes 
by PQ the exterior normal vector to the surface at a 
point P in an infinitesimal element of surface ds and 
by QX, QY, QZ the angles this vector makes with 
the positive x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, respectively. 
Gauss then denotes by dS an infinitesimal element of 
the yz-plane and erects a cylinder above it, this cylin­
der intersecting the surface in an even number of in­
finitesimal surface elements ds1 ,ds2 ,...,ds2n .For 
each j, dS = ±dsj cos QXj , where the positive sign 
is used when the angle is acute, the negative when the 
angle is obtuse. Since if the cylinder enters the surface 
where QX is obtuse, it will exit where QX is acute 
(see Fig. 1), Gauss obtains dS = -ds1 cos QX1 = 
ds2 cos QX2 = • • • and concludes by summation that 
“The integral ds cos QX extended to the entire sur­
face of the body is 0.”
He notes further that if T, U, V are rational func­
tions of only y, z, only x, z, and only x, y, respec­
tively, then
(T cos QX + UcosQY +V cos QZ)ds =0.
Gauss then approximates the volume of the body 
by taking cylinders of length x and cross-sectional 
area dS and concludes in a similar way his next 
theorem:
The entire volume of the body is expressed by the 
integral ds x(cos QX) extended to the entire 
surface.
We will see below how these results are special cases 
of the divergence theorem.
In 1833 and 1839 Gauss published other special 
cases of this theorem, but by that time the general the­
orem had already been stated and proved by Michael 
Ostrogradsky. This Russian mathematician, who was 
in Paris in the late 1820s, presented a paper [15] 
to the Paris Academy of Sciences on February 13, 
1826, entitled Proof of a Theorem in Integral Cal­
culus. In this paper Ostrogradsky introduces a sur­
face with element of surface area £ bounding a solid 
with element of volume w. He denotes by a, ft, y 
the same angles which Gauss called QX, QY, QZ, 
and by p, q, r three differentiable functions of 
x, y, z. He states the divergence theorem in the

where a, b, c are constants and where the left-hand 
integral is taken over a solid, the right-hand integral 
over the boundary surface.
We note that Gauss’s results are all special cases of 
Ostrogradsky’s theorem. In each case a = b = c =1; 
Gauss’s first result has p =1,q = r =0; his second 
has

and his third has p =x, q = r =0. We also will 
see that Gauss’s proof is a special case of that of 
Ostrogradsky.
Ostrogradsky proves his result by first consider­
ing dpu. He integrates this over a ‘narrow cylinder’ 
going through the solid in the x-direction with cross­
sectional area u, using the fundamental theorem of 
calculus to express this integral as
/ ■ 
=/<p 1 - p 0)u,
where p0 and p1 are the values of p on the pieces 
of surface where the cylinder intersects the solid.
Since u = £ 1 cos a 1 on one section of surface and 
u = —£0 cos a0 on the other (a 1 and a0 being the 
appropriate angles made by the normal, £1 and £0 
being the respective surface elements), we get
f dp , 
,
dxu = 
p 1 £ 1 cos a 1+ 
p0£0 cos a0
= pcos a£,
where the left integral is over the cylinder and the 
right one is over the two pieces of surface (see Fig. 2). 
Adding up the integrals over all such cylinders gives 
one-third of the final result, the other two-thirds being 
done similarly. We note that this proof can easily be 
modified to suit modern standards, and is in fact used 
today, e.g., in Taylor and Mann [24].
Though the above proof applies to arbitrary dif­
ferentiable functions p, q, r, we will note for future 
reference that Ostrogradsky uses the result only in 
the special case where

p = vdX - udX,

r = v^T

with u and v also being differentiable functions of 
three variables.
Ostrogradsky presented this theorem again in a 
paper in Paris on August 6, 1827, and finally in

St. Petersburg on November 5, 1828. The latter pre­
sentation was the only one published by Ostrogradsky, 
appearing in 1831 in [16]. The two earlier presenta­
tions have survived only in manuscript form, though 
they have been published in Russian translation.
In the meantime, the theorem and related ones ap­
peared in publications of three other mathematicians. 
Simeon Denis Poisson, in a paper presented in Paris 
on April 14, 1828 (published in 1829), stated and 
proved an identical result [19]. According to Yushke- 
vich in [28], Poisson had refereed Ostrogradsky’s 
1827 paper and therefore presumably learned of the 
result. Poisson neither claimed it as original nor cited 
Ostrogradsky, but it must be realized that references 
were not made then with the frequency that they are 
today.
Another French mathematician, Frederic Sarrus, 
published a similar result in 1828 in [21], but his 
notation and ideas are not nearly so clear as those of 
Ostrogradsky and Poisson. Finally, George Green, an 
English mathematician, in a private publication of the 
same year [9], stated and proved the following:
Laplacian, and d/dw means the normal derivative; 
the first integrals on each side are taken over the 
solid and the second over the boundary surface. Green 
proved his theorem using the same basic ideas as did 
Ostrogradsky. In addition, if we use again the special 
case where

p = vdx - udx,

where u, v are functions of three variables in a solid 
body ‘of any form whatever,’ A is the symbol for the
we can conclude by a short calculation that the two 
theorems are equivalent. Nevertheless, Green did not 
so conclude; he was interested in the theorem in the 
form in which he gave it. It would thus be difficult to 
attribute the divergence theorem to him.
All of the mathematicians who stated and proved 
versions of this theorem were interested in it for spe­
cific physical reasons. Gauss was interested in the the­
ory of magnetic attraction, Ostrogradsky in the theory 
of heat, Green in electricity and magnetism, Poisson 
in elastic bodies, and Sarrus in floating bodies. In 
nearly all cases, the theorems involved occurred in 
the middle of long papers and were only thought 
of as tools toward some physical end. In fact, for 
both Green and Ostrogradsky the functions u and v 
mentioned above were often solutions of Laplace­
type equations and were used in boundary value prob­
lems.

The theorem generally known as Green’s theorem 
is a two-dimensional result which was also not consid­
ered by Green. Of course, one can derive this theorem 
from Green’s version by reducing it to two dimensions 
and making a brief calculation. But there is no evi­
dence that Green himself ever did this.
On the other hand, since Green’s theorem is crucial 
in the elementary theory of complex variables, it is 
not surprising that it first occurs, without proof, in 
an 1846 note of Augustin Cauchy [5], in which he 
proceeds to use it to prove ‘Cauchy’s theorem’ on the 
integral of a complex function around a closed curve. 
Cauchy presents the result in the form:
dx dy 
f f pp 
dq
p^+q + qds) = *JJ dy— - dX)dxdy, 
where p and q are functions of x and y, and where the 
sign of the second integral depends on the orientation 
of the curve which bounds the region over which 
the integral is taken. Cauchy promised a proof in 
his private journal Exercises d’analyse et de physique 
mathematique, but he apparently never published one.
Five years later, Bernhard Riemann presented the 
same theorem in his inaugural dissertation [20], this 
time with proof and in several related versions; again 
he uses the theorem in connection with the theory of 
complex variables. Riemann’s proof is quite similar to 
the proof commonly in use today; essentially he uses 
the fundamental theorem to integrate dq/dx along 
lines parallel to the x-axis, getting values of q where 
the lines cross the boundary of the region; then he 
integrates with respect to y to get
■^ddx dy = — I qdy = — I q-yds. 
dx 
I 
I ds
The other half of the formula is proved similarly.
The final theorem of our triad, Stokes’s theorem, 
first appeared in print in 1854. George Stokes had for 
several years been setting the Smith’s Prize Exam at 
Cambridge, and in the February 1854 examination, 
question #8 is the following [22] (see Fig. 3):
If X, Y, Z be functions of the rectangular co­
ordinates x, y, z, dS an element of any limited 
surface, l, m, n the cosines of the inclinations of 
the normal at dS to the axes, ds an element of 
the boundary line, shew that

. . . the single integral being taken all around the 
perimeter of the surface.

It does not seem to be known if any of the students 
proved the theorem. However, the theorem had al­
ready appeared in a letter of William Thomson (Lord 
Kelvin) to Stokes on July 2, 1850, and the left-hand 
expression of the theorem had appeared in two earlier 
works of Stokes. The first published proof of the the­
orem seems to have been in a monograph of Hermann 
Hankel in 1861 [10]. Hankel gives no credit for the 
theorem, only a reference to Riemann with regard to 
Green’s theorem, which theorem he calls well known 
and makes use of in his own proof of Stokes’ result.
In his proof Hankel considers the integral 
Xdx+ Ydy+ Z dz over a curve bounding a sur­
face given explicitly by z = z(x, y). Then
dz = dzdx + dzdy, 
dx dy
and so the given integral becomes

By Green’s theorem, this integral in turn becomes

An explicit evaluation of the derivatives then leads to 
the result:

Since a normal vector to the surface is given by 
(—dz/dx, —dz/dy, 1) and since the components of 
the unit normal vector are the cosines of the angles 
which that vector makes with the coordinate axes, it 
follows that dz/dx = — 1 /n, dz/dy = —m/n, and 
dS = dx dy/n. Hence by substitution, Hankel ob­
tains the desired result.
Of course, this proof requires the surface to be 
given explicitly as z = z(x, y). A somewhat different 
proof, without that requirement, is sketched in Thom­
son and Tait’s Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867) 
[25] without reference. In 1871 Clerk Maxwell wrote 
to Stokes asking about the history of the theorem [12]. 
Evidently Stokes answered him, since in Maxwell’s 
1873 Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism there 
appears the theorem with the reference to the Smith’s 
Prize Exam [13]. Maxwell also states and proves the 
divergence theorem.
Vector forms of the theorem
All three theorems first appeared, as we have seen, in 
their coordinate forms. But since the theory of quater­
nions was being developed in the mid-nineteenth cen­
tury by Hamilton and later by Tait, it was to be ex­
pected that the theorems would be translated into their 
quaternion forms. First we must note that Hamilton’s 
product of two quaternions
p = x0 + x1i + x2j + x3k and 
q = y0 +y1i +y2j +y3k
may be written as
pq = (x0y0 - x1y1 - x2y2 -x3y3)
+ (x2y3 -y2x3)i + (x3y1 - y3x1)j
+(x1y2 - x2 y1)k.
Again we denote the scalar part by SVa and the 
vector part by VVa.
Tait, then, in an 1870 paper [23] was able to state 
the divergence theorem in the form 
ff/s ^- =// S ■ aUv ds,
where dZ is the element of volume, ds an element of 
surface, and Uv a unit normal vector to the surface. 
Furthermore, Stokes’s theorem took the form
S ■ VVaUvdZ,
where dp is an element of length of the curve bound­
ing the surface.
Maxwell, in his treatise of three years later, re­
peated Tait’s formulas, but also came one step closer 
to our current terminology. He proposed to call SVa 
the convergence of a and VVa the curl of a .Of 
course, Maxwell’s convergence is the negative of 
what we call the divergence. Furthermore, we note 
that when two quaternions p and q are pure vectors, 
Hamilton’s S • pq is precisely the negative of the in­
ner product p • q. (This particular idea was first de­
veloped by Gibbs and Heaviside about twenty years 
later.)

KATZ: The History of Stokes’s Theorem

Putting these notions together, we get the modern 
vector form of the divergence theorem
(di (diva) dV = dd a • n dA,
where a is a vector field Xi + Yj + Zk, dV is an 
element of volume, dA is an element of surface area 
of the surface S bounding the solid M, and n is the 
unit outward normal to this surface. Stokes’s theorem 
then takes the form
(d (curl a) • n dA = ((a • t) ds,
where ds is the element of length of the boundary 
curve r of the surface S and t is the unit tangent 
vector to r. Obviously, a similar result can be given 
for Green’s theorem.
Generalization and unification
The generalization and unification of our three the­
orems took place in several stages. First of all, Os- 
trogradsky himself in an 1836 paper in Crelle [17] 
generalized his own theorem to the following:
dfdPdQ dR \
J \dx + dy + dZ +-----d dxdydz...
d P&L । cL^ i l-Ll- i A
_ p [rxz + Qdy + R— + ••■)
SS J( dL\2 + /W)2 + ( dL \2 + ••• 
\/ \ dx J \ dy ' \dz/ '
Here Ostrogradsky lets L(x,y,z,...) be “a function 
of as many quantities as one wants,” V be the set of 
values x,y,z,... with L(x,y,z,...) > 0, and S be 
the set of values with L(x,y,z,...)=0. In modern 
terminology, if there are n values, S would be an 
(n - 1)-dimensional hypersurface bounding the n- 
dimensional volume V .
Ostrogradsky’s proof here is similar to his first one. 
He integrates dP/dx with respect to x and after a 
short manipulation gets
/
——dx dy dz ... = [ —, dx dy dz . .. 
9^
with, of course, a similar expression for every other 
term. Then, putting
dS =
p dy2 dz2 • • ■ + dx2 dz2 • • ■ + dx2 dy2 • • ■ + • ■ ■ ,
he shows that
dy dz . . . dx dz . . .

and concludes the result by summation.
To understand how Ostrogradsky gets his expres­
sion for dS, we note that for a parametrized surface 
in three-space, 
dS = A du dv

is the unit outward normal n to S, and if we let a 
denote the vector function (P,Q,R,...), then Ostro- 
gradsky’s result becomes
(diva) dV = j a ■ n dS,
a direct generalization of the original divergence the­
orem.
The first mathematician to include all three theo­
rems under one general result was Vito Volterra in 
1889 in [27]. Before quoting the theorem, we need to 
understand his terminology. An r-dimensional hyper­
space in n-dimensional space is given parametrically 
by the n functions
xi =(u1 ,u2 ,u3 ,...,ur ),i=1,...,n.
Volterra considers the n by r matrix J = (dxi /du,j) 
and denotes by Ai1 i2...ir the determinant of the r by

r submatrix of J consisting of the rows numbered 
i1 ,i2 ,...,ir . Letting

he calls Adu1 du2 ...dur an “element of hyper­
space” and
at 1 i2 ...ir -(Aii i2 ...ir/A)
a direction cosine of the hyperspace. (The a’s are, 
of course, functions of the u’s.) For the case where 
r =2and n =3we have already calculated A above 
in our discussion of Ostrogradsky’s theorem. Since 
the determinants d(xi,xj)/d(u 1 ,u2) are precisely 
the components of the normal vector to the sur­
face, the aij are then the components of the unit 
normal vector, hence are the cosines of the angles 
which that vector makes with the appropriate coordi­
nate axes.
We now quote Volterra’s theorem, translated from 
the Italian:
Let Li1 i2 ...ir be functions of points in a hyper­
space Sn defined and continuous in all their first 
derivatives and such that any transposition of 
indices changes only the sign. Let the forms
S- 
___ \ ' S s \-~ 1 dLi 1 i2 ...is — 1 is + 1 ...ir + 1
Mi 1 i 2 ...ir + 1 
Z^( - 1)

We denote by Sr the boundary of a hyperspace 
Sr+1 ofr + 1 dimensions open and immersed in 
Sn; by ai1i2 ...ir + 1 the direction cosines of Sr+1 
and by pi 1 i2 ...ir those of Sr. The extension of 
the theorem of Stokes consists of the following 
formula:
E
r+1
Mi1 i2 ...ir+1ai1i2 ...ir+1 dSr+1
Sr i Li1i2...ir pi1i2...ir dSr.
Let us check the case where r =1andn =3to see 
how this result generalizes Stokes’s theorem. In that 
case we have three functions L1 ,L2,L3 of points in 
three-dimensional space. The M functions are then 
given as follows:

Since r =1, Sr is a curve given by three functions 
x1 (u), x2 (u), and x3 (u). So
A= // dx 1 V+ A dx 2 V+ A dx 3 V

and ds = Adu. Then
pi = dx/du for i = 1,2,3, 
and = ■dx_.s

The a12, a31 and a23 are the appropriate cosines as 
mentioned above. Hence the theorem will read:

the result being exactly Stokes’s theorem. A similar 
calculation will show that the case r =2,n =3will 
give the divergence theorem, the case r =1,n =2 
will give Green’s theorem, and the case r = n - 1 is 
precisely Ostrogradsky’s own generalization.
We note further that if we replace aij 
by (d(xi,xj)/d(u,v))/A, dS2 by Adudv, and 
(d(xi,xj)/d(u,v))dudv by dxidxj, and if we set 
x1 = x, x2 = y, x3 = z, we get another familiar 
form of Stokes’s theorem:

Although Volterra used his theorem in several papers 
in his study of differential equations, he did not give 
a proof of the result; he only said that it “is obtained 
without difficulty.”
If one studies Volterra’s work, it becomes clear that 
it would be quite useful to simplify the notation. This 
was done by several mathematicians around the turn 
of the century. Henri Poincare, in his 1899 work Les 
Methodes Nouvelles de la Mecanique Celeste [18], 
states the same generalization as Volterra, but in a 

KATZ: The History of Stokes’s Theorem
85
much briefer form:
jlA Adu =J 
± ddxAdxkd^.
Here the left-hand integral is taken over the (r - 1)- 
dimensional boundary of an r-dimensional variety 
in n-space, while the right-hand integral is over the 
entire variety. Hence A is a function of n variables and 
du is a product of r — 1 of the dxi s, the sum being 
taken over all such distinct products. Poincare’s form 
of the theorem is more compact than that of Volterra, 
in part because the direction cosines are absorbed 
into the expressions du. (See [1] for more details.) 
Poincare, like Volterra, in this and other works of the 
same period, was chiefly interested in integrability 
conditions of what we now call differential forms; 
i.e., in when a form u is an exact differential.
The mathematician chiefly responsible for clari­
fying the idea of a differential form was Elie Car­
tan. In his fundamental paper of 1899 [2] he first 
defines an ‘expression differentielle’ as a symbolic 
expression given by a finite number of sums and 
products of the n differentials dx1 ,dx2 ,...,dxn 
and certain coefficient functions of the variables 
x1 ,x2 ,...,xn. A differential expression of the first 
degree, A 1 dx 1 + A2 dx2 + • • • + Andxn, he calls an 
‘expression de Pfaff.’
Cartan states certain rules of calculation with these 
expressions. In particular, his rule for ‘evaluating’ a 
differential expression requires that the value of 
Adxm 1 dxm2
• • • dxmn
be the product of A with the determinant | dxmj /dai |, 
where the xs are functions of the parameters ai. 
The standard rules for determinants then require that 
if any dxi is repeated, the value is 0 and that any 
permutation of the dxi s requires a sign change if 
the permutation is odd. For instance, Cartan con­
cludes that Adx1 dx2 dx3 = —Adx2 dx1 dx3, or just 
that dx1 dx2 = —dx2 dx1 .
Cartan further discusses changes of variable; if 
x1 ,x2 ,...,xn are functions ofy1 ,y2,...,yn, then
dxi = Tx'dy 1 + Tx-dy 2 +-----+ dx±d^yn^
dy 1 
dy 2 
dyn
i =1, 2,. . . ,n.
Then, for instance, in the case n =2, we get
dx 1 dx2 = (x1x 1 ,x2) dy 1 dy2. 
d (y 1 ,y 2)
One might note, on the other hand, that if one assumes 
a change of variable formula of this type, then one is 
forced to the general rule dxi dxj = —dxj dxi .
Finally, Cartan defines the “derived expression” of 
a first-degree differential expression u = A1 dx1 + 
A2 dx2 + ••• + An dxn to be the second-degree ex­
pression u' = dA 1 dx 1 + dA2 dx2 + • • • + dAndxn, 
where, of course,
dAi _ 
dAi j
= z^ dxjdxj.
For the case n =3 one can calculate by using the 
above rules that if u = A1 dx + A2 dy + A3 dz, then
u = (dA3 — d-A-1 dydz + ( A — A) dzdx 
y dy dz J ydz dx J
+ (Z~ — dA1} dxdy.
\ dx dy J
Comparing this with the example we gave in dis­
cussing Volterra’s work, it is clear that Volterra’s 
M23, M31, and M12 are precisely the coefficients of 
Cartan’s u'.
Cartan in [2] did not discuss the relationship of his 
differential expressions to Stokes’s theorem; never­
theless, by the early years ofthe twentieth century the 
generalized Stokes’s theorem in essentially the form 
given by Poincare was known and used by many au­
thors, although proofs seem not to have been pub­
lished.
By 1922, Cartan had extended his work on differen­
tial expressions in [3]. It is here that he first uses the 
current terminology of “exterior differential form” 
and “exterior derivative”. He works out specifically 
the derivative of a 1-form (as we did above) and notes 
that for n = 3 Stokes’s theorem states that Cc u = 
ffs u', where C is the boundary curve of the surface 
S . (This is, of course, exactly Volterra’s result in the 
same special case.) Then, defining the exterior deriva­
tive of any differential form u = Adxi dxj ...dxl 
to be u' 5! dA dxidxj .. .dxl (with dA as above), 
he works out the derivative of a 2-form Q in the spe­
cial case n = 3, and shows that for a parallelepiped 
P with boundary S, JJS Q = fff p Q'. One can easily 
calculate that this is the divergence theorem, and we 
must assume that Cartan realized its truth in more 
general cases. He was, however, not yet ready to state 
the most general result.
The “d” notation for exterior derivative was used 
in 1902 by Theodore DeDonder in [6], but not again 
until Erich Kahler reintroduced it in his 1934 book

86
Analysis
Einfuhrung in die Theorie der Systeme von Differen- 
tialgleichungen [11]. His notation is slightly different 
from ours, but in a form closer to ours it was adopted 
by Cartan for a course he gave in Paris in 1936-1937 
(published as Les Systemes Differentiels Exterieurs et 
leurs Applications Geometriques [4] in 1945). Here, 
after discussing the definitions of the differential form 
w and its derivative dw, Cartan notes that all of our 
three theorems (which he attributes to Ostrogradsky, 
Cauchy-Green, and Stokes, respectively) are special 
cases of C w = A dw , where C is the boundary of 
A. To be more specific, Green’s theorem is the spe­
cial case where w is a 1-form in 2-space; Stokes’s 
theorem is the special case where w is a 1-form in 3- 
space; and the divergence theorem is the special case 
where w is a 2-form in 3-space. Finally, Cartan states 
that for any (p + 1)-dimensional domain A with p- 
dimensional boundary C one could demonstrate the 
general Stokes’s formula:
C w = A dw.
(For examples of the use of these theorems, see any 
advanced calculus text, e.g., [1] or [24]. For more in­
formation on differential forms, one can consult [7].)
Appearance in texts
A final interesting point about these theorems is their 
appearance in textbooks. By the 1890s all three the­
orems were appearing in the analysis texts of many 
different authors. The third of our theorems was al­
ways attributed to Stokes. The French and Russian 
authors tended to attribute the first theorem to Ostro- 
gradsky, while others generally attributed it to Green 
or Gauss; this is still the case today. Similarly, Rie­
mann is generally credited with the second theorem 
by the French, while Green is named by most oth­
ers. Before Cartan’s 1945 book, about the only au­
thor to attribute that result to Cauchy was H. Vogt 
in [26].
The generalized Stokes’s theorem, first published, 
as we have seen, in 1945, has only been appearing in 
textbooks in the past twenty years, the first occurrence 
probably being in the 1959 volume of Nickerson, 
Spencer, and Steenrod [14].

The Mathematical Collaboration of 
M. L. Cartwright and J. E. Littlewood
SHAWNEE L. MCMURRAN AND JAMES J. TATTERSALL

Balthasar van der Pol’s experiments on electrical cir­
cuits during the 1920s and 1930s opened an interest­
ing chapter in the history of dynamics. The need for 
advancements in radio technology made van der Pol’s 
work pertinent and his research stimulated mathemat­
ical interest in non-linear oscillators. In particular, 
van der Pol’s work caught the attention of Cambridge 
mathematicians M. L. Cartwright and J. E. Little­
wood. Topology and Poincare’s transformation theory 
provided a key to analyzing behavior of non-linear 
oscillators and dissipative systems. Resulting math­
ematical techniques have played a significant role in 
the development of the modern theory of dynamical 
systems and chaos. In addition, non-linear oscillator 
theory has led to the development of radio, radar, and 
laser technology.
The collaboration between Cartwright and Little­
wood began just before World War II and lasted ap­
proximately ten years. They published four joint pa­
pers, and individually published several other papers 
based on joint work. Their collaboration produced 
some of the earliest rigorous work in the field of 
large parameter theory. They were among the first 
mathematicians to recognize that topological and an­
alytical methods could be combined to efficiently 
obtain results for various problems in differential 
equations, and their results helped inspire the con­
struction of Smale’s horseshoe diffeomorphism ([28], 
pp. 63-80). Their names can be included with those 
mathematicians, including Levinson, Lefschetz, Mi­
norsky, Liapounov, Kryloff, Bogolieuboff, Denjoy, 
Birkhoff, and Poincare, whose work provided an 
impetus to the development of modern dynamical 
theory.
Cartwright knew G. H. Hardy at Oxford before she 
met Littlewood. Cartwright joined a special group 
when she began to attend Hardy’s Friday class at 
New College in January 1928. The participants in­
cluded Gertrude Stanley, John Evelyn, E. H. Linfoot, 
L. S. Bosanquet, Frederick Brand, and Tirukkanna- 
puram Vijayarhagavan. Nearly all completed their D. 
Phils by the summer of 1928. The universal feeling 
among the participants was that they were studying 
under a very great man who had not yet been rec­
ognized fully. Cartwright appreciated Hardy’s style 
and philosophy of mathematics. She recalled that 
he took immense trouble with his students whether 
they were good, bad, or indifferent. Once, when she 
had produced an obviously fallacious result, Hardy 
([10], p. 23) remarked, “Let’s see, there’s always hope 
when you get a sharp contradiction.” Hardy became 
Cartwright’s initial thesis advisor and she finished 
with E. C. Titchmarsh when Hardy went on leave to 
Princeton.
Cartwright first met Littlewood in June 1930 when 
he went to Oxford to examine her for her Doctor of 
Philosophy degree. The following October she went 
to Girton College, Cambridge on a three-year re­
search fellowship. She attended a series of courses 
by Littlewood on the theory of functions and his sem­
inar that took place in his rooms in Trinity at 5:00 
P.M. preceded by a nice tea.
In 1931 Hardy assumed the Sadleirian Chair of 
Mathematics at Cambridge. Cartwright asked Hardy 
if he would be offering a seminar similar to the Fri­
day evening sessions she had enjoyed at Oxford. He 
replied that he would probably come to some arrange­
ment with Littlewood. Soon after, the Lecture List 
announced a Hardy-Littlewood class. Cartwright [16] 
recalled that while Littlewood was speaking at the first 
Hardy-Littlewood class, Hardy came in late, helped 
himself liberally to tea and began to ask questions. It

seemed as if he were trying to pin Littlewood on de­
tails, whereas Littlewood was trying to illustrate the 
main point while taking the details for granted. Little­
wood told Hardy that he was not prepared to be heck­
led and Cartwright does not recall them ever being 
present together at any subsequent class. Thenceforth, 
Hardy and Littlewood alternated classes. Littlewood 
usually did the speaking on his turns and Hardy of­
ten invited others to speak during the classes. Even­
tually, Littlewood ceased to participate, though the 
class continued to be held in his rooms. The class be­
came known as “the Hardy-Littlewood Conversation 
Class at which Littlewood was never present.” Lit­
tlewood intermittently held his own unlisted lecture 
class, which Hardy recommended to several of his 
students.
During her first years at Cambridge, Cartwright 
occasionally wrote or spoke with Littlewood on topics 
pertaining to his courses. She recalls his manner as 
somewhat unconventional; he was always more ready 
to talk out of doors. She was occasionally able to catch 
him on the telephone after her late tea and before his 
early dinner. He never discussed problems with her 
at a blackboard, but he would draw imaginary figures 
on a wall as they walked and talked. Once they began 
to collaborate, nearly all of their collaboration was 
done by letter with occasional short discussions of 
particular points. He never came to her rooms and she 
does not remember going to his. Most of the letters 
Littlewood sent Cartwright would have something on 
the back, often galley proofs.
Cartwright suspects that Littlewood may have had 
some unspoken rules for their collaboration compa­
rable to those he had with Hardy. Harold Bohr ([1], 
p. xxviii) noted that the following four “axioms of col­
laboration” formed a basis for the Hardy-Littlewood 
relationship.
1. When one wrote to the other, it was completely 
indifferent whether what they wrote was right or 
wrong.
2. When one received a letter from the other, he was 
under no obligation whatsoever to read it, let alone 
answer it.
3. Although it did not really matter if they both si­
multaneously thought about the same detail, still, 
it was preferable that they should not do so.
4. It was quite indifferent if one of them had not 
contributed the least bit to the contents of a paper 
under their common name.
Bohr was of the opinion that, “seldom, or never, 
was such an important and harmonious collaboration 
founded on such negative axioms.”
Cartwright gives Hardy credit for the formulation 
of these rules. She contends that such a precise for­
mulation was typical of him. When she questioned 
Littlewood about these axioms, he replied that the 
agreement between Hardy and himself was unwrit­
ten. He never personally informed Cartwright about 
the rules, but she surmises that his policy regarding 
their collaboration was similar. Cartwright was once 
told that when preparing some material to send to 
her, Littlewood “withdrew part of what he had writ­
ten as being contrary to the rules of collaboration” 
[16]. She suspects that Littlewood may have broken 
the first rule by criticizing some of her mistakes.
According to Cartwright [15], one memorable 
episode between herself and Littlewood concerned 
an interesting problem that he had presented in his 
theory of functions class. In particular, Does the func­
tion f (z) =ia™=1 anzn, analytic for z < 1, which 
takes no value more than p times in |z| < 1, satisfy
|f (re9)| < A(p)(1 - r)-2p
for 0 <r <1, where A(p) is a constant depend­
ing only on p and a1 ,a2 , ... ,ap ? Littlewood
Cartwright the impression that this was an exciting 
problem and he would be interested in any significant 
progress she could make toward its solution.
Meanwhile, in one of Edward Collingwood’s 
classes, Cartwright had learned of Ahlfors’ Distor­
tion Theorem. In her bath one night she thought she 
saw how to apply it to Littlewood’s problem. When 
she later settled down to examine the problem more 
carefully, she fell into the “usual trap.” The proof 
for the case p =1was known and she tried to prove 
the case for p>1 using a modification of that proof 
rather than her original idea. She sent this attempt 
to Littlewood. In reply she received a note with the 
snake in Figure 1. In his note Littlewood explained 
the common error she had made in her proof.
Figure 1.

J. E. Littlewood
Returning to her original idea, Cartwright sent a 
new proof to Littlewood using Ahlfors’ work. Some 
time later, while punting with the Vice-Mistress of 
Girton on the River Cam near Trinity College, Cart­
wright spotted Littlewood on a nearby bank. As she 
had received no reply regarding her revised proof, she 
asked him if he had read her manuscript. He replied, 
“Have I got to read all that?” She convinced him that 
he should, and he was impressed with her work.
The polished version of her proof was published [3] 
and Littlewood referred to the paper in his Lectures 
on the Theory of Functions. Cartwright believes that 
her work on this problem prompted Littlewood and 
Hardy to write a joint letter to Girton resulting in a 
Faculty Assistant Lectureship and the renewal of her 
research fellowship for a fourth year.
In January 1938, the Radio Research Board of the 
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is­
sued a memorandum requesting the “really expert 
guidance” of pure mathematicians with “certain types 
of non-linear differential equations involved in the 
technique of radio engineering” [27]. A copy was 
sent to the London Mathematical Society. Radio en­
gineers wanted an analysis of the solutions to some 
very objectionable looking differential equations oc­
curring in connection with radar.

The problems that concerned the radio engineers 
arose from the use of vacuum tubes (thermionic 
valves) used to control the flow of electricity in the cir­
cuitry of transmitters and receivers. Transistors have 
replaced most vacuum tubes in transmitters; however, 
vacuum tubes are still sometimes used when very high 
voltages are present. When encased in ceramic they 
are very radiation hard and are used in missiles. The 
type of problem arising from vacuum tubes had great 
influence on the mathematics of control theory and 
airplane construction.
The existing techniques available for the explicit 
analytical solutions of linear differential equations 
with constant coefficients were the mainstays of early 
radio engineers. Linear differential equations were 
used to approximate physical systems and behavior 
of systems was inferred from the solutions. Accord­
ing to the memorandum, the need had “arisen for a 
more complete understanding of the actual behavior 
of certain assemblages of electrical apparatus, includ­
ing thermionic valves.” Non-linear differential equa­
tions were required to obtain a closer approximation 
of the actual physical system.
Radio engineers hoped mathematicians could pro­
vide them with a theory for non-linear differen­
tial equations that had the same relative simplic­
ity as that for linear differential equations. At the 
time, this request could not be considered completely 
naive. Although interest in celestial mechanics in­
spired considerable research on non-linear conser­
vative oscillators before 1920, analogous techniques 
were unavailable for the dissipative systems arising 
in radio research. Physicists and engineers encounter­
ing these systems in their experimental work had done 
most of the available research. Except for the work of 
Liapounov and Poincare, there had been little sys­
tematic study of non-linear differential equations by 
mathematicians.
Although engineers could compute numerical so­
lutions to their systems, these solutions were of lit­
tle value when one wanted to know how solutions 
varied with the parameters. During the early twen­
tieth century numerical solutions were less easy to 
obtain. Moreover, a large number of numerical solu­
tions are necessary to determine how solutions vary 
with the parameters of the physical system. The engi­
neers hoped that an analytical approach might provide 
a more efficient way to analyze their systems.
Unfortunately, mathematical analyses of even the 
simplest equations representing the physical sys­
tems were quite complicated and had few practi­
cal applications. The memo acknowledged that it 
was worthwhile to determine if this were the case 
in order to prevent the “waste of time and energy 
spent in pursuit of a will-o’-the-wisp.” In the end, 
complications and variations in the valves them­
selves convinced radio engineers that experimen­
tal methods were more effective than mathematical 
analysis.
Cartwright [13] says, “Although I myself have 
helped to develop the general theory and settle cer­
tain theoretical problems, I do not think that I have 
ever produced a result useful for any specific prac­
tical problem when it was needed.” Though the en­
gineers were unable to apply many of the theories 
developed by mathematicians such as Cartwright and 
Littlewood, new problems were arising for automatic 
control mechanisms involving systems of equations 
sufficiently similar to those of the radio work for some 
theory still to be applicable. Resulting mathematical 
techniques allowed for a headway in the analysis of 
dissipative systems where progress had previously 
been rather slow. Such analysis provided part of the 
foundation to the development of modern dynamical 
theory.
One of the basic building blocks of early twentieth­
century circuitry was the triode oscillator illustrated 
in Figure 2. The objective of the Radio Research 
Board was to determine which parameter values of 
the circuit would lead to periodic or almost periodic 
solutions. It was also essential to determine how the 
frequency of these oscillations varied with the param­
eters of the circuit.
The problems appeared interesting to Cartwright. 
Using the references provided, she began her inves­
tigation working back to the research by Appleton 
and van der Pol in the 1920s. An important paper by 
van der Pol [29] contained eighty-seven references 
and was an excellent starting point for her research. 
The emphasis of van der Pol’s article was on phe­
nomena that linear equations could not explain. He 
referred to several biological and physical research 
papers such as Volterra’s work on interacting species, 
E. W Brown’s work on the pendulum, and Poincare’s 
work on celestial mechanics. Cartwright [14] was sur­
prised that van der Pol did not refer to Birkhoff ’s 
work, Bendixson’s work, or Poincare’s paper “Sur les 
courbes definies par les equations differentielles.” She 
says that the well-known ideas of Poincare on curves 
and Bendixson on limit cycles have since become fun­
damental concepts when dealing with several types of 
non-linear equations. In addition, she and Littlewood 
used techniques inspired by Birkhoff’s applications 
of transformation theory to dynamical systems. Her

opinion of van der Pol was that, like many authors, 
herself included, he did not read all the works to which 
he referred.
It is interesting that Cartwright would concern her­
self with these applied problems, since dynamics was 
a subject that had not appealed to her at Oxford. Nev­
ertheless, Cartwright intuitively recognized the topo­
logical undertones of the problems. She says [11], 
“The mathematical problems which have interested 
me most are apt to turn into topological problems or 
problems of topological dynamics.”
Although she initially knew very little of the dy­
namical side, Cartwright found the work of the radio 
engineers to be much more interesting and suggestive 
than that of mechanical engineers. Radio engineers 
wanted their systems to oscillate in an orderly way. 
Similar equations were studied in astronomy and ce­
lestial mechanics, but the cycles there are measured 
in days and years. The speed of radio oscillations, 
whose cycles are measured in fractions of a second, 
enables experiments to suggest the behavior of stable 
solutions quickly and efficiently.
While exploring the literature, Cartwright found 
several intriguing problems, which she brought to Lit­
tlewood’s attention. At the time, Cartwright was in the 
habit of showing Littlewood anything that she thought 
would interest him. Littlewood dismissed several sim­
ple problems, but he found some of van der Pol’s 
conjectures worth investigating.
Cartwright presented Littlewood with the material 
she had collected because she thought that he might 
help her understand the dynamics of the situation. He 
solved or suggested methods of solutions for most of 
the problems straightaway, but he found certain prob­
lems more interesting. Littlewood often thought in 
dynamical terms, perhaps because of his earlier work 
in ballistics during the First World War. She says [13] 
that he often referred to solutions as “trajectories”, 
as if they were the paths of missiles fired from anti­
aircraft guns. He certainly seemed to understand the 
dynamical aspects of the radio work. Van der Pol, re­
calling a discussion with Littlewood, told Cartwright 
[16] in “tones of delighted surprise” that all of Little­
wood’s methods corresponded to physical concepts. 
Cartwright and Littlewood corresponded with Cole­
brook, Appleton, and van der Pol in order to gain a 
better understanding of the situation.
The first problem attacked by Cartwright and Lit­
tlewood was that of the amplitude of the stable peri­
odic solution of van der Pol’s equation without forcing 
term:
x — k (1 — x 2) x + x = 0. 
(1)
Van der Pol had obtained graphical solutions for the 
cases k=0.1, 1, and 10 (see Figure 3). Van der Pol’s 
graphs appear to show convergence to a periodic so­
lution with amplitude 2 in all three cases. Littlewood 
showed that the amplitude was not 2 if k was small and 
positive. Fork small and positive, equation (1) has one 
periodic solution of amplitude 2 + O(k). Cartwright 
and Littlewood [8] succeeded in showing that when 
k is large all solutions of equation (1), except the 
trivial solution x =0, converge to a periodic solution 
whose amplitude tends to 2 as k ^ ^. The method 
they used was elementary, but difficult.
Cartwright and Littlewood next attacked the prob­
lem of whether van der Pol’s equation with a forced 
oscillation,
x — k(1 — x2)x + x = bkXcos Xt, (2)

could have two stable periodic solutions with different 
periods when k was large. Van der Pol had suggested 
the phenomenon after he and van der Mark found ex­
perimentally that increasing and decreasing the rel­
ative frequency A of the driving force produced two 
subharmonics of different orders for the same values 
of the parameters (if a differential equation with a 
forcing function of period P has a periodic solution 
with period nP, where n is a positive integer, then 
that oscillation is called a subharmonic of order n).
Cartwright and Littlewood focussed a great deal 
of their attention on van der Pol’s equation. They 
found the equation interesting and suggestive since 
it seemed to be the simplest type of equation likely 
to have two stable periodic oscillations with periods 
prime to one another. They agreed that tackling a 
really difficult problem first in its simplest form is 
best.
Most of the early research of Cartwright and Little­
wood concentrated on equations with two or more sta­
ble periodic solutions. Both considered this problem 
to be the most analytically interesting problem inves­
tigated during their collaboration [14]. Their topolog­
ical interpretation of this problem led to their paper 
[26] on fixed-point theorems. They left what Little­
wood considered the “duller stuff” until later. How­
ever, when they explored this material they found 
that it was more difficult than they had anticipated. 
In Littlewood’s words to Cartwright [11], “All de­
tails have a nasty way of ramifying into difficulties.” 
Their results were published in a paper [25] dealing 
with second-order equations with positive damping, 
which was much corrected by Littlewood.
Although Cartwright and Littlewood produced 
some interesting and innovative mathematics, their 
collaboration was not always harmonious [2]. 
Cartwright became irritated with Littlewood’s in­
cessant changes, even though her own technique 
was to “polish, polish, polish” before publishing. 
Cartwright’s sense of history was very good and her 
historical perspective adds an excellent dimension 
to their papers. When they separated, they agreed 
that Littlewood would finish the hardest problem and 
Cartwright would complete the other bits and pieces. 
Her results appear in a series of papers ([4], [5], [6], 
[7], [8]) published in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
A significant portion of the joint work of 
Cartwright and Littlewood was published under her

name alone. This was the case even if the paper was 
really based on a Littlewood manuscript to which 
Cartwright had added a bit or filled in the gaps. Lit­
tlewood would not let her put his name to any paper 
not actually written by him. She had to say it was 
based on joint work with him. There was one ex­
ception, the paper on fixed-point theorems. Most of 
the problems they attacked came from the literature 
of engineering. Their paper on fixed-point theorems 
was an exception as it developed from their treatment 
of van der Pol’s equation.
From 1931 Littlewood suffered from, and was 
treated for, recurring bouts of mental depression. 
Cartwright says that his mind was so full of ideas that 
he found it difficult to rest. She recalls that he seemed 
exhausted whenever he had completed a collabora­
tive paper and he occasionally complained about their 
joint papers. Cartwright appreciated the special effort

made by Littlewood to have their first paper published 
in order to support her candidacy for the Royal So­
ciety. This joint paper [24] was published in 1945 
and was intended as a preliminary survey of their re­
sults regarding van der Pol’s equation with forcing 
term and k large. The full proofs of the results pre­
sented in the paper were not published until twelve 
years later. By that time Littlewood had been cured 
of his depression. Cartwright recalls that in 1958, al­
though he was reluctant, she persuaded Littlewood to 
go to London to accept the prestigious Copley Medal 
that the Royal Society had awarded him. She trea­
sures a note from him beginning, “All right, you win” 
[16]. Littlewood probably could not have been con­
vinced to make such a social appearance before his 
cure.
Cartwright insisted that the two papers published 
in 1957, those that gave the full proofs of the results 
announced in their paper of 1945, be published under 
his name alone. She may have felt that her contri­
butions had not been significant. However, as Little­
wood was leaving for a trip to America, he left some 
final details of the proof corrections to her. In each 
manuscript, he affirms that the work was based on 
joint efforts.
Cartwright and Littlewood’s analysis of the van der 
Pol equation showed that the existence of two stable 
sets of subharmonics of different orders led to com­
plex topological structures. At the boundary between 
the domains of attraction of the two sets there ex­
ists an intricate fine structure of highly non-stable 
trajectories. They concluded that the boundary was 
most likely an indecomposable continuum that, ac­
cording to Littlewood, is the “dirtiest” thing one can 
say about a set of points. Except for its instability, this 
structure closely resembles that of strange attractors. 
The homeomorphism of the plane defined by follow­
ing the trajectories through one period maps the set 
onto itself. Cartwright and Littlewood found this phe­
nomenon to be of great interest since it indicated that 
the non-stable periodic solutions and subharmonics of 
the equation corresponded to fixed points of the set 
under the homeomorphism or an iterate of it. They 
surmised that existence of these fixed points could be 
deduced from a suitable fixed-point theorem. This led 
them to investigate fixed point theorems for continua 
invariant under a diffeomorphism of the plane.
The fixed-point theorems needed by Cartwright 
and Littlewood could not be obtained by the meth­
ods of existing algebraic fixed-point theory because 
of the complexity of the continua involved. Fixed- 
point theorems for plane continua that are acyclic 
but otherwise unrestricted were required. However, 
they were able to use some of Birkhoff ’s results for 
analytic transformations of the plane into itself with 
complicated invariant curves. Even reasonable reg­
ularity arguments would not allow them to rule out 
singular invariant curves. Birkhoff had shown the ex­
istence ofan analytic transformation of the plane into 
itself with complicated invariant curve K. Cartwright 
and Littlewood used such a transformation to show 
existence of stable periodic subharmonic motions, un­
stable motions, and recurrent motions each associated 
with some subset of K . They were among the earli­
est mathematicians to associate such transformations 
with a simple differential equation.
At the time of Cartwright and Littlewood’s inves­
tigations, Lefschetz, Levinson, Minorsky, and others 
in the United States also began to explore some of 
the problems raised by the study of electrical circuits, 
in particular the boundedness of solutions to the non­
linear differential equations associated with the cir­
cuits. Like the English pair, government requests also 
prompted the Americans. However, whereas the focus 
of Cartwright and Littlewood was on certain special 
problems, the Americans were striving for a general 
and more easily handled mathematical theory. The 
American emphasis was on amplitude and period. 
The work of Cartwright and Littlewood emphasized 
frequencies and parameters. Cartwright [14] specu­
lates that perhaps this difference occurred because 
engineers became more interested in non-linearities 
that were not necessarily either small or large.
Meanwhile, Kryloff, Bogoliuboff, and Mitropol- 
sky of the Kiev school were employing averaging 
methods to analyze equations such as van der Pol’s. 
Until the end of the nineteenth century, techniques of 
averaging were used mainly in celestial mechanics. 
Van der Pol promoted the application of averaging 
techniques to equations arising in electronic circuit 
theory. However, rigorous proofs of validity of the 
method were not available until Fatou provided the 
first proof of asymptotic validity in 1928. Although 
they used some foreign research results, Cartwright 
and Littlewood might have made better use of the 
work of both the Americans and the Russians if not 
for the isolation due to the war.
In America, Levinson had obtained results for a 
piecewise linear equation that were similar to the 1945 
results of Cartwright and Littlewood. Cartwright [14] 
says that a monograph [21] of Levinson’s, which com­
bined the work of Kryloff, Bogolieuboff, Denjoy, and 
Birkhoff, considerably influenced the work of her­
self and Littlewood. Levinson’s ideas provided the

Analysis
foundations ofa general topological approach to non- 
autonomous periodic second-order differential equa­
tions and stimulated the interest of Cartwright and 
Littlewood in the mappings suggested by their re­
search on the forced van der Pol’s equation.
In 1947 Cartwright wrote to Lefschetz at Princeton 
trying to get a copy of Minorsky’s report on non-linear 
vibrations. Minorsky was preparing the report for the 
Office of Naval Research and Lefschetz was listed 
as head of the project. She included some results of 
herself and Littlewood in her correspondence. She 
received the first part of the report and was surprised 
that it had been classified as “Restricted” and not to be 
divulged to unauthorized persons. She also received a 
letter from Lefschetz expressing great interest in her 
research with Littlewood.
Lefschetz and Mina Rees invited Cartwright to the 
United States from January to June 1949 to lecture 
on non-linear differential equations. She spent three 
weeks at Stanford with Minorsky, one week at UCLA 
with John Curtis, and the rest at Princeton. Cartwright 
[6] gave a series of lectures at Princeton that provides 
a detailed overview of her joint work with Littlewood. 
While at Princeton, she was officially a consultant 
under the Office of Naval Research, not a professor, 
at the time, Princeton did not have women professors. 
Cartwright got on well with all those she met, but 
Bochner was not on speaking terms with Lefschetz 
so she never saw him. She also learned that American 
academicians tended to be a bit casual. John Tukey 
told her to feel free to put her feet on the table in 
the seminar room. Wearing a skirt, not trousers, she 
refrained. Cartwright also learned that if Lefschetz 
stopped asking questions of a visiting lecturer for 
five minutes, he was asleep.
Cartwright suspects that Littlewood might not have 
read much of the literature from which their prob­
lems were extracted. She recalled that Littlewood had 
once advised her not to pay too much attention to the 
existing literature on a problem. He surmised [16], 
“If previous writers had failed to solve it, it was 
probably because they had tried a wrong method.” 
Consequently, Cartwright and Littlewood approached 
their problems using methods that were quite diffe­
rent from those of the radio engineers. Their innova­
tive approach led Cartwright and Littlewood to the 
conclusion that using both topological and analytical 
methods was indispensable in the study of differential 
equations. According to Cartwright [12],
We should widen our conception of topological 
methods to include all those now claimed as such
by topologists and combine them with analytical 
methods to obtain results more quickly; we need 
a clarification of existing topological results in 
terms of differential equations .....
Cartwright [17] also stressed that the topological in­
terpretation of a problem can give one valuable in­
sight into the qualitative behavior of solutions, even 
when one is unfamiliar with or does not plan to use 
topological methods in their analysis.
Cartwright [7] found it remarkable that the experi­
mental results of van der Pol and van der Mark guided 
her and Littlewood to so many unsolved problems in 
topology. Several papers ([22], [23], [25], [8]) that 
came from the collaboration of Cartwright and Lit­
tlewood are among the earliest fully rigorous works in 
large parameter theory (i.e., relaxation oscillations). 
Work such as theirs clearly provided an impetus to 
the development of the modern theory of dynami­
cal systems. The subject has expanded significantly 
since their work was completed. Modern techniques 
have enabled contemporary mathematicians to carry 
through a more thorough analysis of the asymptotic 
behavior exhibited by solutions to the forced van der 
Pol equation (see, for example, [20], [18], 19]). Non­
linear oscillation theory has led to the development 
of radio, radar, and laser technology, and investiga­
tions into the van der Pol equation have played a vital 
role in both the theory of relaxation oscillations and 
bifurcation theory.

Dr. David Blackwell is an African-American educa­
tional pioneer and eminent scholar in the fields of 
mathematics and statistics, whose contributions to 
our society extend beyond these fields. This paper 
highlights his significant contributions and the per­
sonal, educational, and professional experiences that 
groomed and nurtured him for leadership as a civic 
scientist. We hope this account of Dr. Blackwell’s 
life will enhance the literature on African-American 
achievers, and motivate students majoring in, or con­
sidering careers in mathematics and statistics, partic­
ularly those from under-represented groups.
The education of David Blackwell
Early childhood
It is April 24, 1919, an era of heightened segregation 
and racial discrimination in the United States. Wel­
come to Centralia, Illinois, a small town community 
on the Mason-Dixon line, with a population of about 
12,000 people, and very few African-American fam­
ilies [13]. Witness the birth of David Harold Black­
well. He was to be the eldest of four children born 
to Grover Blackwell, a hostler for Illinois Central 
Railroad, and Mabel Johnson Blackwell, a full-time 
homemaker. His two younger brothers, J. W. and 
Joseph, and his younger sister Elizabeth would follow 
soon after.
During his early childhood, David had a grandfa­
ther and an uncle living in Ohio who were influential 
to his cognitive development. His grandfather, whom 
he had never met, was a school teacher and later a 
storekeeper. He endowed David with a large library 
of books. From this library, David read and enjoyed 
many books, including his first algebra book. His 
uncle had been home-schooled by his grandfather, 
because of worries about the effects of racism on his 
son at school. He impressed David with his ability 
to add three columns of numbers expeditiously, in a 
one-step process.
David attended Centralia public schools for the first 
ten years of his schooling, from 1925 to 1935. His par­
ents enrolled him in integrated schools in his southern 
Illinois locality, which also had racially segregated 
schools: whites-only schools and blacks-only schools. 
However, being at an integrated school, David was 
unaware of, or unaffected by, issues of racial discrim­
ination. He attributes this to the fact that his parents 
shielded their children as much as possible from the 
effects of racism, and to the fact that he experienced 
few encounters where race was an issue.
High school education
In high school, David developed a strong interest in 
games such as checkers and in geometry, but was 
not particularly interested in algebra and trigonome­
try. He pondered over questions of whether the player 
with the first move in these games had a higher prob­
ability of winning. He states this about geometry ([3], 
p. 20):
Until a year after I finished calculus, it was the 
only course I had that made me see that mathe­
matics is really beautiful and full of ideas. I still 
remember the concept of a helping line. You 
have a proposition that looks quite mysterious. 
Someone draws a line and suddenly it becomes 
obvious. That’s beautiful stuff. I remember the 
proposition that the exterior angle of a triangle 
is the sum of the remote angles. When you draw 
that helping line it is completely clear.

Dr. David Harold Blackwell (1919- ) 
“Find something that you like. 
It is more important than how 
much money you make.” [1]
Fortunately for David, he had teachers who 
nurtured his mathematical interests. His geometry 
teacher got him to love mathematics by helping him 
to see the beauty of the subject. A teacher named Mr. 
Huck formed a mathematics club where he would 
challenge students with problems from the School 
Science and Mathematics journal. Whenever a stu­
dent came up with a good possible solution Mr. Huck 
would send the solution to the journal under the stu­
dent’s name. David’s solutions got published once in 
the journal and he was identified three times there as 
having correct solutions to problems, which gave him 
great joy. This was something that further motivated 
his interest in mathematics. Consequently, long be­
fore he was admitted to college, David had decided to 
major in mathematics. He states ([3], p. 21), “I really 
fell in love with mathematics... It became clear that 
it was not simply a few things that I liked. The whole 
subject was just beautiful.”
Undergraduate education
David graduated from high school in 1935, at the 
age of 16. He promptly enrolled at the University 
of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, a campus with no 
black faculty at that time. His intention was to earn a 
Bachelor’s degree and become an elementary school 
teacher. This decision was motivated by the scarcity 
of jobs at that time and the fact that a good friend of 
his father, with a strong influence on the school board 
in a southern Illinois town, had promised to get him 
hired upon graduation. However, because his decision 
to become an elementary school teacher was based 
primarily on the need for employment after gradua­
tion rather than a keen interest, he kept postponing his 
education courses. After a time, they were no longer 
necessary, due to a change in his career decision.
David’s career goal to become an elementary 
school teacher changed in his combination ju- 
nior/senior year when he took a course in elemen­
tary analysis. This course really sparked his interest 
in advanced level mathematics. It motivated him to 
consider a career that would require graduate level 
education in mathematics. He now set his sights on 
teaching at the college or high school level. He be­
gan to pursue activities that would facilitate his career 
goals and groom him for leadership, such as serving 
as president for the mathematics club at this univer­
sity. His parents, who were not college educated folks, 
left it to him to make the hard core decisions about 
his college education and career. However, they sup­
ported him in every way they could and encouraged 
him to work hard to achieve his goals.
At the end of his freshman year, David learned that 
his father was borrowing money to finance his college 
education. A young man with strength of character, 
he decided to spare his father this financial ordeal by 
taking responsibility for supporting his college ed­
ucation by working as a dishwasher, a waiter, and 
a cleaner for equipment in the college entomology 
lab. In spite of having to work his way through col­
lege, David facilitated his college education by tak­
ing summer classes and passing proficiency exams, 
which allowed him to skip courses. Thus, in 1938, he 
graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in mathematics 
within three years of admission to college.
Graduate education
David continued on for graduate study from 1938 to 
1941, at Champaign-Urbana, working to pay for his 
education as usual. In his last two years of gradu­
ate study, while he was a doctoral student, he was 
awarded fellowships from the university. David has 
mixed feelings about the motivations of the univer­
sity officials in offering him these fellowships. He 
says this about the issue ([3], p. 21):
One of my fellow graduate students told me that 
I was going to get a fellowship. I said, “How do 

100
Analysis
you know?” He said, “You’re good enough to be 
supported, either with a fellowship or a teach­
ing assistantship, and they’re certainly not going 
to put you in the classroom.” That was funny to 
me because fellowships were the highest awards; 
they gave one the same amount of money and 
one didn’t have to work for it. I have no doubt, 
looking back on it now, that race did enter 
into it.
In 1939, David earned a master’s degree in mathe­
matics, proceeding on for doctoral studies with some 
trepidation. He was confident that he could handle 
the mathematics course work and read research pa­
pers. However, he was unsure about whether he would 
be successful in writing a thesis. Being a determined 
young man, he took on this challenge, bearing in mind 
that he had the option of high school teaching in the 
event that he was not successful in completing the 
doctoral program.
David’s thesis advisor was Joseph Doob. He was 
a probability and statistics professor at Champaign- 
Urbana, renowned for his contributions to martingale 
theory. David states [1], “Joseph Doob had the most 
important mathematical influence on me. I studied his 
work carefully and learnt a lot from it. I admired him 
and tried to emulate him.” This statement captures the 
significance of documenting the contributions and 
biographies of pioneers, innovators, and leaders in 
any field of study.
Ironically, David had never met Doob prior to ap­
proaching him to become his thesis advisor. His de­
cision to appeal to Doob was based on the recom­
mendation of a peer mentor, Don Kibbey, a teaching 
assistant in whom he placed a great deal of confi­
dence; Doob was Don Kibbey’s dissertation advisor 
at that time. He was also the dissertation advisor to 
Paul Halmos, a mathematician who contributed im­
mensely to the development of measure theory and 
who was a significant peer mentor to David in this 
area while they were both students of Doob.
In 1941, at the age of 22, within five years of grad­
uation from high school, David earned a doctorate 
in mathematics. He is the seventh African-American 
to earn a Ph.D. in this field. His dissertation is ti­
tled, “Some Properties of Markoff ’s Chains”. It led 
to his first set of publications: “Idempotent Markoff 
chains”, “The existence of anormal chains”, and “Fi­
nite non-homogeneous chains” ([4], [5], [6]). David 
credits the main idea in his thesis to his advisor Joseph 
Doob. In doing so, he shows how important a thesis 
advisor is in helping students to identify appropriate 
research questions.
Post-doctoral education
Upon completion of his doctoral program, David was 
awarded a Rosenwald Post-doctoral Fellowship for 
a year at the Institute of Advanced Study (IAS) at 
Princeton University. His exposure at the IAS was 
the beginning of a stellar career as a renowned math­
ematician, statistician, and educator.
His acceptance at the IAS was not devoid of the 
hurdles of racism. At that time, it was customary for 
Princeton to appoint IAS members as visiting fellows. 
However, when the administrators at Princeton, par­
ticularly the president, realized that David was a black 
man they profusely objected to his acceptance at the 
IAS. Princeton had never admitted a black student nor 
hired a black faculty member, and the administrators 
wanted to maintain the status quo. Upon the insistence 
and threats of the IAS director, the administrators of 
Princeton later withdrew their objections to David’s 
acceptance at the IAS. At the time David accepted the 
Rosenwald Fellowship, he was unaware of the racial 
controversy that took place between the IAS direc­
tor and the president of Princeton. He discovered the 
exact details several years later during the prime of 
his professional career. Thus, he was shielded from 
the marring effects of racism on his acceptance of 
the Rosenwald Fellowship and his stay at the 
IAS.
At the IAS, there were two mathematicians in 
particular who influenced David’s post-doctoral ed­
ucation, Samuel Wilks and John von Neumann, a 
renowned Hungarian-American mathematician cred­
ited with initiating the development of game theory. 
David developed a keen interest in statistics by audit­
ing Samuel Wilks’s course. Wilks was a mathemati­
cian renowned for his work in developing the field of 
mathematical statistics. He was a founding member 
of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, an interna­
tional professional and scholarly society devoted to 
the development, dissemination, and application of 
statistics and probability. (Much later, in 1955, David 
would serve as president of this organization.)
Another important mathematician who took an in­
terest in David was John von Neumann. He encour­
aged David to meet with him to discuss his thesis. 
David avoided this meeting for several months be­
cause he did not think that the great John von Neu­
mann was genuinely interested, or had the time to 

AGWU, SMITH AND BARRY: Dr. David Harold Blackwell, African-American Pioneer
101
listen to him discuss his thesis. This turned out to be 
a flawed assumption, for von Neumann was indeed 
interested in mentoring students. When David and 
von Neumann finally met to discuss his thesis, von 
Neumann spent about 10 minutes listening to David’s 
explanation about his thesis and asking him related 
questions. Afterwards, he took the liberty to explain 
to David other simpler techniques that he could have 
used for his thesis problem. The time David spent 
with von Neumann discussing his thesis, seeing first­
hand that he was willing to mentor students, certainly 
impressed young David. Throughout his professional 
career, even at the height of success, we see him men­
toring students and other young professionals.
Professional career: scholar, 
teacher, and administrator
We only have to examine the humble beginnings of 
David’s professional career to understand some of the 
negative consequences of racism, and other forms 
of discrimination, on society. David was a young 
African-American pioneer with genius, integrity, and 
strength of character, whose work was of interest 
to world-class mathematicians of this period. Yet 
when he completed his post-doctoral education, the 
only universities he applied to for a faculty position 
were Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
(HBCUs), because he could envision himself 
nowhere else. He states [10]:
It never occurred to me to think about teaching in 
a major university since it wasn’t in my horizon 
at all—I just assumed that I would get a job 
teaching in one of the black colleges. There were 
105 black colleges at that time, and I wrote 105 
letters of application ...I eventually got three 
offers, but accepted the first one I got. From 
Southern University.
From 1942 to 1943, David was an instructor at 
Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 
1943, he accepted an instructor position for a year, at 
another HBCU, Clark College, in Atlanta, Georgia. 
In 1944, at the end of his term at Clark College, 
David still envisioned himself as a faculty member at 
an HBCU. He accepted a tenure-track position as an 
assistant professor at Howard University, Washington 
D.C., the premier HBCU at that time, where he was 
one of the Mathematics Department’s four faculty 
members. At Howard he was a generalist, teaching all 
mathematics courses right up to the master’s degree 
level, which was the highest degree program in the 
department.
David stayed at Howard for ten years, from 1944 to 
1954, rising through the ranks from Assistant Profes­
sor to Associate Professor in 1946, and finally to the 
position of Professor and Chairman of the Mathemat­
ics Department in 1947. In spite of the heavy teach­
ing loads of at least 12 hours per week, and heavy 
administrative duties at these HBCUs, he had over 20 
publications by the time he left Howard. He had also 
earned a strong reputation as an excellent teacher and 
innovative scholar in probability, statistics, and game 
theory.
Interestingly, although David enjoyed his work as 
a mathematics faculty member at Howard, it was not 
Howard but the larger mathematics community and 
professional networking that was the springboard for 
his professional success. He says [10], “I was teach­
ing at Howard and the mathematics environment was 
not really very stimulating, so I had to look around 
beyond the university for whatever was going on 
in Washington that was interesting mathematically.” 
However, Howard should be given some credit. The 
administrators understood the importance of profes­
sional meetings and supported David financially and 
otherwise to allow him to attend them. This illustrates 
how important it is for students and young profession­
als to attend professional meetings and participate in 
professional organizations.
David credits Abe Girshick for initiating his pro­
fessional success in statistics. He attended a meeting 
sponsored by the Washington Chapter of the Amer­
ican Statistical Association. There he listened to an 
interesting lecture by Girshick on sequential analysis. 
The lecture involved a discussion of Wald’s equation, 
a concept David found to be unbelievable. Thus, after 
the meeting, David constructed a counter-example 
to this equation, which he mailed to Girshick. His 
counter-example turned out to be wrong. However, 
it resulted in an invitation from Girshick to David to 
meet with him in his office to discuss it. This meet­
ing was the beginning of a wonderful relationship for 
both men and several years of collaboration, which 
culminated years later in a classic mathematics book, 
Theory of Games and Statistical Decisions [9]. It also 
resulted in several publications by David, including 
his favorites: “On an equation of Wald” [7] (a proof 
with much weaker constraints of the equation he 
found to be unbelievable) and “Bayes and minimax 
solutions of sequential decision problems” [8].

Analysis
According to David, Abe Girshick was his most 
influential mentor in the field of statistics. He took 
time off to work in collaboration with Girshick at the 
RAND Corporation and Stanford University, Califor­
nia, while he was still a faculty member at Howard. 
The RAND Corporation began as Project RAND, 
started by the Air Force in 1946 to conduct long-range 
studies in intercontinental warfare by means other 
than ground armies. David worked as a mathemati­
cian at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, Cali­
fornia, from 1948 to 1950 during the summer periods, 
and as a Visiting Professor at Stanford, from 1950 to 
1951. These were the most significant times for him. 
His work during this period resulted in breakthroughs 
that set the stage for world recognition.
David’s work in game theory blossomed at the 
RAND Corporation while he was collaborating with 
Abe Girshick and other colleagues. World War II had 
promoted an interest in the theory of games depict­
ing duels. The theory of duels deals with two-person, 
zero-sum games.
Imagine two persons initially standing 2n paces 
apart, each with a gun loaded with a single bullet. 
They are advancing towards each other. At every step 
forward each person has to decide whether to shoot 
or hold fire without any prior knowledge of what the 
other person’s decision will be. A strategy certainly 
involves how many of the possible n steps have been 
taken already, knowledge of one’s own shooting abil­
ity, and some guess about one’s opponent. Firing too 
soon means the shooter might miss; firing too late 
might mean the shooter may have been shot. To sim­
plify the theory, we assume that the game always ends 
with one person having been shot.
David explored different variations on the basic 
theory of duels. For instance, if the intention is to kill 
one’s opponent, then the optimal number of steps be­
fore firing may be different than it would be if all one 
wants is to stay alive. It also might make a difference 
if both guns have silencers, so one might not know 
that the opponent has fired and missed. His work in 
the theory of duelling led to significant developments 
in game theory and earned him a reputation as a pi­
oneer in this area. He developed a game-theoretic 
proof of the Kuratowski Reduction Theorem, which 
was ground-breaking in that it connected the fields of 
topology and game theory, an achievement that gives 
him great pleasure.
David did not explore beyond two-person, zero­
sum games. He attributes his reluctance to do so to 
the extreme complexity of other types of games and 
to the fact that the best mathematical response for 
certain games may have a negative social, psycho­
logical, or economical response. This had to do with 
the sure thing principle, which was formulated by 
Jimmie Savage, one of David’s mentors at the RAND 
Corporation. One way of stating it is this: Suppose 
you have to choose between two alternatives, A and 
B, and you think that the outcome depends on some 
unknown situation X or Y . If knowing that X was 
the case would lead you to choose A over B and if 
knowing that Y was the case would still lead you 
to choose A over B , then, even if you do not know 
whether X or Y was the case, you should still choose 
A over B . It was thought that the arms race arising 
from the Cold War showed the sure thing principle at 
work.
Suppose that the U.S. and the Soviet Union both op­
erate on the sure thing principle. They have to choose 
between arming (alternative A) or disarming (alter­
native B) without knowing whether the other nation 
is going to arm (situation X) or disarm (situation Y ). 
The sure thing principle indicates that the best mathe­
matical strategy is for both nations to continue arming 
themselves in order to stay ahead or at par with the 
opposing nation. This leads to the depletion of valu­
able resources that each nation could have spent on 
other important areas of development. This is like the 
well-known prisoner’s dilemma, because both nations 
are actually losing when they use the sure thing prin­
ciple. The winning strategy would be for both nations 
to disarm, a situation that is unlikely to happen due to 
mistrust between the two nations who both fear that 
the other will double-cross them if they cooperate. 
David says [1], “I started working on this particular 
game where the sure thing principle led to behavior 
that was not best. So, I stopped working on it.” Here 
we see David as a moral scientist.
David’s work with the RAND Corporation led him 
to an avid study of the works of Thomas Bayes. By 
a stroke of fate, an economist at the RAND Corpo­
ration asked David’s mathematical opinion on how to 
apportion the Air Force research budget over a pe­
riod of five years between immediate developmental 
and long-range research. The appropriate proportion 
is dependent on the probability of a major war within 
the budget period. If this probability is high, then the 
budget emphasis will be on immediate developmen­
tal research, and if it is low, the emphasis will shift to 
long-range research.
David gave a mathematically correct but unhelp­
ful answer. He indicated that, in this situation, we are 
dealing with a unique event and not a sequence of 
repeated events, so the probability of occurrence of 

AGWU, SMITH AND BARRY: Dr. David Harold Blackwell, African-American Pioneer
103
a major war within the five-year period is either 0 or 
1, and is unknown until the five-year period has 
elapsed. The economist remarked, in a manner that 
intrigued David, that this was a common answer of 
statisticians. It caused him to ponder the problem, and 
to discuss it with Jimmie Savage on his visit to the 
RAND Corporation several weeks later. His discus­
sion with Savage left David with a completely new 
approach to statistical inference—the Bayesian ap­
proach.
The Bayesian approach to statistical inference con­
siders probability as the right way to deal with all 
degrees of uncertainty, and not just the extremes of 
impossibility and certainty, where the probability is 0 
or 1. As a basic example, consider this: Even though 
we cannot observe the same five-year period repeat­
edly and deduce the probability of a war, we still may 
be able to make inferences about this probability and 
base decisions on our estimates of it. In more so­
phisticated applications, statisticians develop utility 
functions based on underlying probability distribu­
tions; decision-makers attempt to maximize utility.
Since David developed an appreciation for the 
Bayesian approach, all his statistical works have in­
corporated it. Thus, he credits Jimmie Savage as the 
second most influential person in terms of his statis­
tical thinking.
The years at Berkeley
In 1954, David accepted a visiting position for one 
year at the University of California, Berkeley. In the 
following year, he accepted a position as a full Pro­
fessor at this university, and remained there until his 
retirement in 1988. It is noteworthy to point out that 
in 1942, much to David’s surprise at the time, he was 
interviewed for a faculty position at Berkeley. How­
ever, he was not surprised or disappointed when he 
was not offered the position. The reason given by the 
university for not hiring him was that they had de­
cided to appoint a woman, due to the war and the 
draft. Nevertheless, destiny prevailed. David finally 
ended up at Berkeley 12 years later, during the period 
of civil rights gains. African-Americans were now be­
ginning to enjoy more career opportunities and better 
employment practices.
Shortly after David’s arrival at Berkeley, the Math­
ematics Department there was divided to make its 
Statistics Laboratory, headed by Jerzy Neyman, into 
a separate department of its own. For four years, from 
1957 to 1961, David was the chair of the Department 
of Statistics, succeeding Neyman, the person who had 
interviewed him in 1942 for a possible faculty posi­
tion at Berkeley. Neyman turned out to be a good 
friend. He had a personal influence on David through 
his warmth, generosity, and integrity.
David enjoyed his stint as chair of the department, 
but he admits that he did not miss the responsibilities 
of that position. He sees the primary goal of admin­
istrative leadership as creating an environment where 
the workers are happy. He states ([3], p. 30), “When I 
was department chairman, I soon discovered that my 
job was not to do what was right but to make peo­
ple happy.” The success of his leadership at Berkeley 
shows that it was a winning strategy to build coali­
tions in which people enjoy working together.
David also provided leadership at Berkeley in other 
administrative capacities. He was the Assistant Dean 
of the College of Letters and Science from 1964 to 
1968 at a time of serious strife at the university. He 
was also the Director of the University of California 
Study Center for the United Kingdom and Ireland, 
from 1973 to 1975.
While at Berkeley, David continued his scholarly 
work on the mathematics of competition and cooper­
ation. Interestingly, although he accomplished many 
innovations while still a faculty member at Howard, he 
did not gain world recognition until he was a faculty 
member at Berkeley. Also interesting is the fact that 
his scholarship was not motivated by doing research 
for its own sake, but by attempting to understand the 
problems that intrigued him.
A caring teacher
Surprisingly, even at Berkeley while David was at the 
peak of his research productivity, he taught probabil­
ity and statistics courses at all levels, from elementary 
to graduate courses. He states ([3], p. 26), “There is 
beauty in mathematics at all levels of sophistication 
and all levels of abstraction.” This statement high­
lights a very important quality that characterizes tal­
ented teachers: they are able to convey the beauty of 
their subject regardless of the level of mastery of the 
students.
David is very modest about his ability as a teacher. 
He sees himself as a good teacher for certain students, 
but not necessarily for all of them; he recognizes that 
there are some styles of teaching where he may not 
excel. He states [1], “People have different learning 
styles, abstract, concrete, visual, hearing, spatial, and 
so on. So it is necessary for teachers to reflect these 
learning styles in their teaching if they would like 
their students to appreciate the beauty of what they 

104
Analysis
are teaching.” Many students evidently found David 
caring and approachable, since he served as the dis­
sertation advisor to at least 53 students at Berkeley, a 
very high number.
David is a dynamic scholar and teacher who feels 
most comfortable when he is around students or those 
willing to learn and share. He is ever willing to jump 
to the blackboard to illustrate examples. From his con­
versations with colleagues and with others to whom 
he has granted interviews, his excitement with math­
ematics surfaces when he begins to ponder its beauty, 
how he fell in love with geometry, or how much plea­
sure it gave him to be challenged by a difficult proof 
of a theorem.
World recognition: the leader and 
civic scientist
David’s world recognition as an eminent scholar, ed­
ucator, and leader in our society is illustrated through 
his numerous awards, honors, and positions of leader­
ship in professional organizations. His honorary Doc­
tor of Science degrees alone illustrate his widespread 
recognition. He has received 12 honorary Doctor of 
Science degrees: from the University of Illinois in 
1966; Michigan State University in 1969; Southern 
Illinois University in 1971; Carnegie-Mellon Univer­
sity in 1980; the National University of Lesotho in 
1987; Amherst College and Harvard University in 
1988; Howard University, Yale University, and the 
University of Warwick in 1990; Syracuse University 
in 1991; and the University of Southern California in 
1992.
Equally amazing are his extensive leadership roles 
and honors in the profession, which speak to his dy­
namism as a civic scientist, a role in which David 
emerged full-fledged after he left Howard University. 
In 1954, he gave the invited address in probability at 
the International Congress of Mathematicians in Am­
sterdam. This address is credited with spurring Berke­
ley to offer him a visiting professorship. From 1959 
to 1960, he was a visiting lecturer for the Mathemat­
ical Association of America in a program to enhance 
undergraduate mathematics education. In 1965, he 
was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 
1968, he was elected to the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences. By this time, David had published 
at least 60 books and papers.
From 1968 to 1971, David served as the vice pres­
ident of the American Mathematical Society. From 
1972 to 1973, he was chairman of the Faculty Re­
search Lecture Committee. In 1973, he was presi­
dent of the International Association for Statistics in 
the Physical Sciences. In 1974, he was the W. W. 
Rouse Ball Lecturer at the University of Cambridge 
in the United Kingdom. From 1975 to 1978, he was 
president of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical 
Statistics and Probability. From 1975 to 1977, he was 
vice president of the International Statistical Insti­
tute. In 1976, he was elected Honorary Fellow of the 
Royal Statistical Society. In 1977, he gave the Wald 
Lecture for the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. In 
1978, he was vice president of the American Statis­
tical Association. Additionally, David has given the 
Rietz Lecture for the Institute of Mathematical Statis­
tics and he has served on the Board of Directors of 
the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science.
In fact, the Wald and Rietz Lectures of the Institute 
of Mathematical Statistics were instrumental in estab­
lishing his reputation as an effective and charismatic 
lecturer. Noteworthy is the fact that David was among 
a select few chosen to be filmed by the American 
Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Associ­
ation of America, lecturing on mathematical topics 
accessible to undergraduate students.
The year 1979 was a wonderful one for David. He 
was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize by 
TIMS/ORSA, which today has become INFORMS, 
the Institute for Operations Research and Manage­
ment Sciences. This was a significant honor, given 
that John von Neumann was one of his earliest pro­
fessional mentors. The purpose of this prize is to 
recognize a scholar (or more than one, in cases of 
joint work) who has made fundamental contributions 
to theory in operations research and management sci­
ences. Although recent work is not overlooked, the 
award is usually given for work that has stood the 
test of time. The criteria for the prize are broad, and 
include significance, innovation, depth, and scientific 
excellence. In addition to a cash award and medallion, 
the citation reads [12]:
The John von Neumann Theory Prize for 1979 
is awarded to David Blackwell for his outstand­
ing work in developing the theory of Markovian 
decision processes, and, more generally, for his 
many contributions in probability theory, math­
ematical statistics, and game theory that have 
strengthened the methodology of operations re­
search and management sciences. In the area of 
Markovian decision processes Blackwell, in a 
remarkable series of papers published between 

AGWU, SMITH AND BARRY: Dr. David Harold Blackwell, African-American Pioneer
105
1961 and 1966, put the theory of dynamic pro­
gramming on a rigorous mathematical footing. 
He introduced new techniques of analysis and 
established conditions for the existence of op­
timal and stationary optimal policies. Particu­
larly noteworthy are his studies of the effect 
of varying the discount rate and his introduc­
tion of the important concepts of positive and 
negative dynamic programs. Virtually all of the 
subsequent developments in this field are based 
on these fundamental papers. In other areas, 
Blackwell’s early work with Arrow and Girshick 
helped lay the foundations for sequential analy­
sis, and his subsequent book with Girshick sys­
tematized the whole field of decision theory, to 
the great benefit of a generation of mathemati­
cal statisticians. The famous Rao-Blackwell the­
orem on statistical estimation led to a practical 
method for improving estimates, now known as 
“Rao-Blackwellization”. An elegant and impor­
tant form of the renewal theorem is due to Black­
well, as is a beautiful characterization of the in­
formation content of an experiment. In game 
theory, he initiated the study of duels (with Gir- 
shick) and later made several deep contributions 
to our understanding of sequential games and 
the role of information therein.
David, the trailblazer, did not relax after receiv­
ing the John von Neumann Theory Prize. He con­
tinued scaling the frontiers of twentieth-century de­
velopments in mathematics and statistics as a leader. 
In 1986, he was awarded the R. A. Fisher Award 
from the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Soci­
eties. Upon his retirement in 1988, David received the 
Berkeley Citation. This is one of the highest honors 
given to a faculty member at Berkeley, for exemplary 
service to the university and outstanding achievement 
in one’s field. David received this citation for his 
work in game theory, Bayesian inference, and infor­
mation theory, for authoring the classic book, Theory 
of Games and Statistical Decisions [9], and for induc­
tion into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 
and the National Academy of Sciences. By the time of 
his retirement, he had well over 90 books and papers 
published on dynamic programming, game theory, 
measure theory, probability theory, set theory, and 
mathematical statistics.
A tribute to David’s immense contributions is the 
long list of lecture series and publications in his honor. 
The book, Statistics, Probability and Game Theory, 
Papers in Honor of David Blackwell [11], is a com­
pilation of 26 papers edited by T. S. Ferguson, L. 
S. Shapley, and J. B. MacQueen. These papers treat 
topics related to his significant contributions in prob­
ability, statistics, gambling, game theory, Markov de­
cision processes, set theory, and logic. The editors say 
this about the man honored by the volume: “It is the 
mark of an outstanding scientist to be influential in a 
variety of fields.”
Another honor in this category is the Mathemat­
ical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) conference 
and prize in honor of David Blackwell and Richard 
A. Tapia, distinguished mathematical scientists who 
have inspired more than a generation of African- 
American and Hispanic-American students and pro­
fessionals in the mathematical sciences. The prize is 
awarded every second year to a mathematical scien­
tist who has contributed significantly to his or her 
field of expertise, and who has served as a role model 
for mathematical scientists and students from under­
represented minority groups or contributed in signif­
icant ways to the addressing of the problem of the 
under-representation of minorities in mathematics.
Yet another honor in this category is the David 
Blackwell Lecture of the National Association of 
Mathematicians (NAM). This lecture is given annu­
ally at the MathFest, the popular summer meeting of 
the MAA. Its goal is to highlight the contributions 
of minorities in the mathematical community and to 
stimulate their professional growth.
Family life and personal tidbits
On December 27, 1944, David married a wonderful 
woman by the name of Ann Madison. He says [1], 
“The best thing I ever did in life was to get married to 
my wife”. Thus, itis poignantly clear that Ann played 
a very supportive role in her husband’s successes, and 
in ensuring the stability and enhancement of their 
family.
David and Ann have eight children, three sons and 
five daughters, Ann, Julia, David, Ruth, Grover, Vera, 
Hugo, and Sara. Notably, none of their children have 
exhibited any interest in mathematics, nor in a related 
field, an issue that is viewed positively by David. In 
response to a question about his children, he says 
this [1]: “No, they have no particular mathematical 
interests at all. And I’m rather glad of that. This may 
sound immodest, but they probably wouldn’t be as 
good at it as I am. People would inevitably make 
comparisons.”
On David’s off time, when he’s not in a classroom 
filled with students, or writing fascinating papers on 

106
Analysis
mathematical or statistical topics, or engaging in other 
professional commitments, you can find him with his 
wife on their 40-acre property in Northern Califor­
nia, listening to music and enjoying themselves. He 
might say his dream is to sit beneath a tree and sip a 
martini, but in reality he is more active, and finds him­
self planting trees or doing yard work. Many of his 
good friends are professional colleagues with whom 
he works and collaborates to advance the fields of 
mathematics and statistics.
There was a time when David’s family home did 
not have telephone service. One of his children had 
made quite an expensive long distance telephone call, 
so David and his wife decided to have the telephone 
disconnected for a month. During that period, he real­
ized the advantage of not having a telephone—peace 
and tranquility. One month led to three months, but 
eventually, the advantages of the telephone won over 
its cons.
David enjoys playing on the computer. However, 
these are not trivial games that he plays. He says [10], 
“I have a little computer at home, and it is a lot of 
fun just to play with. In fact I’d say that I play with 
this computer here in my office at least as much as 
I do serious work with it.” He admits to attempting 
to use his computer to set up a program to take the 
square root of a positive definite matrix, to minimize 
functions with five variables, and to look at curves. 
Perhaps this kind of play is at odds with the image of 
the mathematician who sits down to prove a theorem, 
but many of us enjoy this kind of fun.
An example to remember
We learn a great deal from examples. If we know that 
someone has gone through a situation similar to ours, 
it helps us to analyze our situation in a more confi­
dent manner and to make better decisions. If we want 
students to make well-informed decisions concern­
ing their educational and professional lives, we must 
provide them with examples of pioneers, innovators, 
and leaders, both in all fields of study and in all parts 
of our nation’s history. The information about that 
successful person motivates students, and gives them 
the courage to tread similar paths. In the words of 
a student at Borough of Manhattan Community Col­
lege (BMCC), City University of New York (CUNY), 
who was acquainted with Dr. David Harold Blackwell 
only through reading about him for a research project 
in an Introduction to Statistics class [2]:
David Blackwell’s life has influenced me with 
the struggles that he has had to endure. He started 
out just wanting to teach elementary school, but 
his love of mathematics and his natural talent 
for mathematics has taken him so much further. 
This is an inspiration to me for I too love what I 
do and wish to go further. He has shown me to 
persevere in the face of adversity. I am happy to 
have learned so much about this truly incredible 
man.
In addition, it is important to appreciate the contri­
butions and accomplishments of persons from under­
represented groups in any field of study, in order to 
promote justice, equity, and diversity. This is an av­
enue for teaching cultural sensitivity and cooperation 
with people of different cultures, and a way to moti­
vate students from these groups to similar or greater 
heights of success.
Dr. David Harold Blackwell is one of the world’s 
most accomplished thinkers in the fields of math­
ematics and statistics. Of great significance is that 
he is one of the African-American masters in these 
fields. He is a dynamic educator with a reputation 
as “one of the finest lecturers in the field” [10]. He 
is a civic scientist and leader whose life history will 
certainly motivate others to follow his example. His 
example can also motivate us to develop the neces­
sary mentoring programs and practices to open the 
doors of opportunity for all students, especially for 
students from under-represented groups, in the fields 
of mathematics and statistics.
By examining the conditions under which this 
mathematician rose to success, we can learn a lot 
about leadership, humility, strength of character, and 
passion for one’s field. We can learn that mentor­
ing, professional development, and active participa­
tion in professional meetings and organizations are 
vital opportunities. Providing them helps us to nurture 
students and encourage them to consider careers in 
mathematics and scientific fields and to groom young 
professionals in these disciplines. We can also learn 
about the social and psychological consequences of 
any form of discrimination on society.
Dr. David Harold Blackwell was not overly con­
cerned about financial status when he decided to ma­
jor in a career in mathematics. He had cultivated an 
appreciation for the subject and had a passion for ex­
amining and understanding issues that intrigued him. 
This passion led him to make ground-breaking inno­
vations in the fields of mathematics and statistics. Our 

AGWU, SMITH AND BARRY: Dr. David Harold Blackwell, African-American Pioneer
107
society has benefited from the vast contributions of 
this most renowned African-American thinker. Un­
believable for a man that thought his story in life was 
to be an elementary teacher.

Afterword
For more details on the work of Cauchy, the best book is Judith Grabiner’s own work, The Origins 
of Cauchy’s Rigorous Calculus [8]. A slightly more recent work on nineteenth-century analysis in 
general is Umberto Bottazzini, The Higher Calculus: A History of Real and Complex Analysis from 
Euler to Weierstrass [1].
It is interesting to compare Cauchy’s work with the contemporary work of Bolzano. Bolzano’s 
important paper on the intermediate value theorem is available in [17], while [18] is the complete 
collection of his mathematical works. For more discussion of the work of Bolzano, see I. Grattan- 
Guinness [9]. Grattan-Guinness claims that Cauchy took the central ideas of his definitions of 
continuity and convergence from Bolzano. But H. Freudenthal and H. Sinaceur disagree [7], [19]. In 
particular, the latter article claims that Bolzano and Cauchy represented two different mathematical 
traditions.
It is also interesting that Cauchy’s definition of convergence had been essentially given by Jose 
Anastacio da Cunha (1744-1787), a Portuguese scholar, in a comprehensive textbook written in 
Portuguese in 1782. Unfortunately, even though the book was translated into French in 1811, it 
apparently was little noticed. For more on da Cunha, see the articles A. J. Franco de Oliveira [6], 
Joao Filipe Queiro [16], and A. P. Youschkevitch [21].
Near the beginning of his article on functions, Kleiner notes that there was a long “prehistory” of 
functions, but does not discuss this at all. One source that does look at the notion of “function” in 
Greek times is Olaf Pedersen, A Survey of the Almagest [15]. There are more detailed discussions 
of some of Kleiner’s ideas in Ivor Grattan-Guinness, From the Calculus to Set Theory [10]. And 
William Dunham’s The Calculus Gallery [6] explores some of the ideas of Weierstrass, Baire, and 
Lebesgue, especially giving examples of some of the “pathological functions.”
Besides the two detailed articles by Michael Bernkopf mentioned in Steen’s bibliography, other 
works that give more details on various aspects of his story include Thomas Hawkins, Lebesgue’s 
Theory of Integration: Its Origins and Development [11] and Leo Corry, David Hilbert and the 
Axiomatization of Physics (1898-1918) [4]. Another article dealing with Hilbert’s work in physics 
is by A. S. Wightman [20]. Finally, there is a very comprehensive five-volume study of the history 
of quantum mechanics in the 1920s: J. Mehra and H. Rechenberg, The Historical Development of 
Quantum Mechanics [14].
D. M. Cannell has written a biography of George Green: George Green. Mathematician and 
Physicist 1793-1841. The Background to His Life and Work [2]. This work contains a comprehensive 
bibliography.
Two works on Kovalevsky are Roger L. Cooke, The Mathematics of Sofya Kovalevskaya [3] and 
Ann Hibner Koblitz, A Convergence of Lives. Sofia Kovalevskaia: Scientist, Writer, Revolutionary
109

110
Analysis
[12] . The second book deals in considerable detail with Kovalevskaya’s life, while the first empha­
sizes her mathematical work.
More information on the work of Cartwright and Littlewood is found in another article by 
McMurran and Tattersall [13].

Geometry,
Topology and 
l Foundations >


Foreword
One of the most important aspects of geometry in the nineteenth century was the development of 
non-Euclidean geometry, and this chapter begins with two brief studies of aspects of its development. 
In the first, George Bruce Halsted reviews volume VII of Gauss’s Werke and concludes from a study 
of many of Gauss’s letters first published in that volume that Gauss’s ideas on the subject had 
no influence on the independent discoveries of Janos Bolyai and Nikolai Lobachevsky, or on the 
earlier publication by Ferdinand Karl Schweikart (1780-1859). In the second article, Florence P. 
Lewis gives us a whirlwind tour through the history of the parallel postulate, from Proclus to 
Bolyai and Lobachevsky. She then proposes how this history, and its effect in how mathematicians 
understood the nature of a postulate, could affect the teaching of geometry in schools. In particular, 
she emphasizes that one reason for the study of geometry is its role in “training the mind.”
Another major aspect of nineteenth-century geometry was the development of projective geome­
try. That development began in the seventeenth-century work of Girard Desargues and Blaise Pascal, 
but, as Julian Lowell Coolidge notes, it then “dragged along” for about a century. In his article, 
Coolidge takes up the story in the nineteenth century, summarizing the work of such mathematicians 
as Jean-Victor Poncelet, Michal Chasles, Jacob Steiner, and Johann Karl Christian von Staudt. But 
then Coolidge remarks that by the end of the nineteenth century, the field of synthetic projective 
geometry was “pretty much worked out.” Dan Pedoe discusses two particular aspects of projective 
geometry: the development of homogeneous coordinates by August Ferdinand Mobius and others, 
and the recognition of the importance of the principle of duality, by Poncelet and Joseph Gergonne. 
In particular, he deals with the controversy between the two men relating to this development.
Although topology had its origins in certain specific problems that came up in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries, such as the Konigsberg bridges problem and Euler’s polyhedron formula, the 
subject only began to have a systematic development late in the nineteenth century. Three papers 
in this chapter deal with specific aspects of topology. First, Julian Fleron recalls that the study of 
point-set topology on the real line began with two questions, the conditions under which a function 
could be integrated (under some reasonable definition of integration), and the uniqueness of the 
expression of a function in terms of its Fourier series. These questions led to the study of the 
point sets at which a discontinuity of the function would still allow it to be integrated or to have a 
unique Fourier series. As Fleron shows, the Cantor set was essentially discovered by the English 
mathematician Henry Smith in 1875, a few years before Cantor himself found it, with the first 
discovery linked to integrability and the second linked to Fourier series.
Connectedness in topology is the subject of R. L. Wilder’s article. Wilder traces the changes in 
the definition and understanding of this concept from the work of Bolzano in the mid-nineteenth 
century to that of N. J. Lennes and F. Riesz early in the twentieth century. Similarly, Peter Hilton 
113

114
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
gives a history of the notions of homology and homotopy, beginning with the work of Poincare and 
continuing through the remarkable contributions made at Gottingen in the 1920s and in Moscow in 
1935.
This chapter concludes with several papers dealing with the foundations of mathematics. First, 
H. C. Kennedy traces the development of the modern meaning of an axiom, concentrating on the 
work of Pasch and Peano. Then Joseph Dauben discusses Charles Sanders Peirce’s ideas on infinite 
sets, ideas that were related to those of Cantor and Dedekind in Europe. Although the latter work 
grew out of questions in analysis, Peirce’s work was more closely related to philosophy. Interestingly, 
Peirce attempted to make mathematical sense out of the notion ofan infinitesimal, an idea that was 
not to come to fruition until the work of Abraham Robinson many years later.
Ivor Grattan-Guinness discusses the developments in logic in the 1920s and 1930s. He shows 
that, although logicism was the most fully developed philosophy of mathematics in 1918, having 
its roots in Whitehead and Russell’s monumental Principia Mathematica of 1910-1913, two other 
philosophies, intuitionism and formalism, both grew to prominence over the next twenty years.
Finally, David Fowler looks at Dedekind’s theorem that \/2 x == = 5/6- Dedekind himself in­
vented the notion of “cuts”, and then claimed to be able to prove this result. But there were other 
notions of the real numbers available at the time, and Fowler considers how Dedekind’s result could 
be proved under other assumptions on the nature of the set of real numbers.

Gauss and the Non-Euclidean Geometry
GEORGE BRUCE HALSTED
American Mathematical Monthly 7 (1900), 247-252
A Review of Gauss’s Werke,
Vol. VII
We are so accustomed to the German professor who 
does, we hardly expect the German professor who 
does not. Such, however, was Schering of Gottingen, 
who so long held possession of the papers left by 
Gauss.
Schering had planned and promised to publish a 
supplementary volume, but never did, and only left 
behind him at his death certain preparatory attempts 
thereto, consisting chiefly of excerpts copied from 
the manuscripts and letters left by Gauss. Meantime 
these papers for all these years were kept secret and 
even the learned denied all access to them.
Schering dead, his work has been quickly and ably 
done, and here we have a stately quarto [1] of matter 
supplemental to the first three volumes, and to the 
fourth volume with the exception of the geodetic part.
Of chief interest for us is the geometric portion 
(pp. 159-452), edited by just the right man, Professor 
Stackel of Kiel.
One of the very greatest discoveries in mathematics 
since ever the world began is, beyond peradventure, 
the non-Euclidean geometry. By whom was this given 
to the world in print? By a Hungarian, John Bolyai, 
who made the discovery in 1823, and by a Russian, 
Lobachevski, who had made the discovery by 1826. 
Were either of these men prompted, helped, or in­
cited by Gauss, or by any suggestion emanating from 
Gauss? No, quite the contrary.
Our warrant for saying this with final and over­
whelming authority is this very seventh volume of 
Gauss’s works, just now at last put in evidence, pub­
lished to the world.
The geometric part opens (p. 159), with Gauss’s let­
ter of 1799 to Bolyai Farkas the father of John (Bolyai 
Janos), which I gave years ago in my Bolyai as demon­
strative evidence that in 1799 Gauss was still trying 
to prove Euclid’s the only non-contradictory system 
of geometry, and also the system of objective space. 
The first is false; the second can never be proven.
But both these friends kept right on working away 
at this impossibility, and the more hot-headed of the 
two, Farkas, finally thought he had succeeded with it, 
and in 1804 sent to Gauss his Gottingen Theory of 
Parallels. Gauss’s judgment on this is the next thing 
given (pp. 160-162). He shows the weak spot. “Could 
you prove, that dkc = ckf = fkg, etc., then were the 
thing perfect. However, this theorem is indeed true, 
only difficult, with already presupposing the theory of 
parallels, to prove rigorously.” Thus in 1804 instead 
of having or giving any light, Gauss throws his friend 
into despair by intimating that the link missing in his 
labored attempt is true enough but difficult to prove 
without petitio principii.
Of course we now know it is impossible to prove. 
Anything is impossible to prove which is the equiv­
alent of the parallel postulate. Yet both the friends 
continue their strivings after this impossibility.
In this very letter Gauss says: “I have indeed yet 
ever the hope, that those rocks sometime, and indeed 
before my end, will allow a through passage.”
Farkas in 1808, December 27, writes to Gauss:
Oft thought I, gladly would I, as Jacob for Rachel 
serve, in order to know the parallels founded, 
even if by another.
Now just as I thought it out on Christmas 
night, while the Catholics were celebrating the 
birth of the Saviour in the neighboring church, 
yesterday wrote it down, I send it to you en­
closed herewith. Tomorrow must I journey out 
to my land, have no time to revise, neglect I it 
now, maybe a year is lost, or indeed find I the 
fault, and send it not, as has already happened 
115

116
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
with hundreds, which I as I found them took for 
genuine. Yet it did not come to writing those 
down, probably because they were too long, too 
difficult, too artificial, but the present I wrote off 
at once. As soon as you can, write me your real 
judgment.
This letter Gauss never answered, and never wrote 
again until 1832, a quarter of a century later, when 
the non-Euclidean geometry had been published by 
both Lobachevski and Bolyai Janos.
This settles now forever all question of Gauss hav­
ing been of the slightest or remotest help or aid to 
young Janos, who in 1823 announced to his father 
Farkas in a letter still extant, which I saw at the Re­
formed College in Maros-Vasarhely, where Farkas 
was professor of mathematics, his discovery of the 
non-Euclidean geometry as something undreamed of 
in the world before.
This immortal letter, a charming and glorious out­
pouring of pure young genius, speaks as follows:
Temesvar, 3 Nov. 1823.
My dear and good father. I have so much to write 
of my new creations, that it is at the moment im­
possible for me to enter into great detail, so I 
write you only on a quarter of a sheet. I await 
your answer to my letter of two sheets; and per­
haps I would not have written you before receiv­
ing it, if I had not wished to address to you the 
letter I am writing to the Baroness, which letter 
I pray you to send her.
First of all I reply to you in regard to the 
binomial.....
Now to something else, so far as space per­
mits. I intend to write, as soon as I have put 
it into order, and when possible to publish, a 
work on parallels. At this moment it is not yet 
finished, but the way I have hit upon promises 
me with certainty the attainment of the goal, if 
it in general is attainable. It is not yet attained, 
but I have discovered such magnificent things 
that I am myself astonished at them. It would be 
damage eternal if they were lost. When you see 
them, my father, you yourself will acknowledge 
it. NowI cannot say more of them, only so much: 
that from nothing I have created a wholly new 
world. All that I have hitherto sent you compares 
to this only as a house of cards to a castle.
P. S. I dare to judge absolutely and with con­
viction of these works of my spirit before you, 
my father; I do not fear from you any false in­
terpretation (that certainly I would not merit), 
which signifies that, in certain regards, I con­
sider you as a second self.
In his autobiography Janos says:
First in the year 1823 did I completely penetrate 
through the problem according to its essential 
nature, though also afterward further comple­
tions came thereto. I communicated in the year 
1825 to my former teacher, Herrn Johann Wal­
ter von Eckwehr (later imperial-royal general), 
a written paper, which is still in his hands. On 
the prompting ofmy father I translated my paper 
into Latin, in which it appeared as Appendix to 
the Tentamen in 1832.
So much for Bolyai.
The equally complete freedom of Lobachevski 
from the slightest idea that Gauss had ever medi­
tated anything different from the rest of the world on 
the parallels I showed in [2].
Passing on to the next section (pp. 163-164), in the 
new volume of Gauss, we find it important as showing 
that in 1805 Gauss was still a baby on this subject. It 
is an erroneous pseudo-proof of the impossibility of 
what in 1733 Saccheri had called “hypothesis anguli 
obtusi.” To be sure, Saccheri himself thought he had 
proven this hypothesis inadmissable, so that Gauss 
blundered in good company; but his pupil Riemann 
in 1854 showed that this hypothesis gives a beautiful 
non-Euclidean geometry, anew universal space, now 
justly called the space of Riemann.
Passing on, we find that in 1808, Schumacher 
writes:
Gauss has led back the theory of parallels to this, 
that if the accepted theory were not true, there 
must be a constant a priori line given in length, 
which is absurd. Yet he himself considers this 
work still not conclusive.
Again, with the date April 27, 1813, we read:
In the theory of parallels we are even now not far­
ther than Euclid was. This is the partie honteuse 
(shameful part) of mathematics, which soon or 
late must receive a wholly different form.
Thus in 1813 there is still no light.
In April 1816, Wachter on a visit to Gottingen 
had a conversation with Gauss whose subject was 
what he calls the anti-Euclidean geometry. On De­
cember 12, 1816, he writes to Gauss a letter which 
shows that this anti-Euclidean geometry, as he under­
stands it, far from being the non-Euclidean geometry 

HALSTED: Gauss and the Non-Euclidean Geometry
117
of Lobachevski and Bolyai Janos, was a monstrous 
conglomerate blunder.
The letter as here given by Stackel (pp. 175-176), 
is as follows:
. . . Consequently the anti-Euclidean or your ge­
ometry would be true. However the constant in 
it remains undetermined: why may perhaps be 
made comprehensible by the following ...The 
result of the foregoing may consequently be so 
expressed:
The Euclidean geometry is false; but never­
theless the true geometry must begin with the 
same eleventh Euclidean axiom or with the as­
sumption of lines and surfaces which have the 
property presumed in that axiom. Only instead 
of the straight line and plane are to be put the 
great circle of that sphere described with infinite 
radius together with its surface. From this comes 
indeed the one inconvenience, that the parts of 
this surface are merely symmetric, not, as with 
the plane, congruent; or that the radius out on 
the one side is infinite, on the other imaginary. 
Only it is clear how that inconvenience is again 
overbalanced by many other advantages which 
the construction on a spherical surface offers: 
so that probably also then even, if the Euclidean 
geometry were true, the necessity no longer in­
deed exists, to consider the plane as an infinite 
spherical surface, though still the fruitfulness of 
this view might recommend it.
Only, as I thought through all this, as I had al­
ready fully settled myself about the result, in part 
since I believed I had recognized the ground (la 
metaphysique) of that indeterminateness neces­
sarily inherent in geometry—also even the com­
plete indecision in this matter, then, if that proof 
against the Euclidean geometry, as I could not 
expect, were not to be considered as stringent 
—; in part, while yet not to consider as lost 
all the many previous researches in plane ge­
ometry: but to be used with few modifications, 
and if still also the theorems of solid geometry 
and mechanics might have approximate valid­
ity, at least to a quite wide limit, which per­
haps yet could be more nearly determined; I 
found this evening—just while busied with an 
attempt to find an entrance to your transcenden­
tal trigonometry, and while I could not find in the 
plane sufficing, determinate functions thereto, 
going on to space constructions, to my no 
small delight the following demonstration for the 
Euclidean parallel-theory ...Justinthe idea to 
conclude I remark still, that the above proof for 
the Euclidean parallel theory is fallacious . . . 
Consequently has here also the hope vanished, 
to come to a fully decided result, and I must con­
tent myself again with the above cited. Withal I 
believe I have made upon that way at least a step 
toward your transcendental trigonometry, since 
I, with aid of the spherical trigonometry, can 
give the ratios of all constants, at least by con­
struction of the right-angled triangle. I yet lack 
the actual reckoning of the base of an isosceles 
triangle from the side, to which I will seek to go 
from the equilateral triangle.
If Gauss’s transcendental trigonometry were as sad 
a hodgepodge as the anti-Euclidean geometry here 
explained by Wachter, itis fortunate that nothing was 
ever given about it but its name. Requiescat in pace.
Yet Gauss writes, April 28, 1817:
Wachter has printed a little piece on the foun­
dations of geometry. Though Wachter has pene­
trated farther into the essence of the matter than 
his predecessors, yet is his proof not more valid 
than all others.
We come now to an immortal epoch, that of the 
discovery of the real non-Euclidean geometry by 
Schweikart, and his publication ofit under the name 
of Astralgeometry.
On the twenty-fifth of January, 1819, Gerling 
writes to Gauss:
Apropos of parallel-theory I must tell you some­
thing, and execute a commission. I learned last 
year, that my colleague Schweikart (prof. juris, 
now Prorector) formerly occupied himself much 
with mathematics and particularly also had writ­
ten on parallels. So I asked him to lend me his 
book. While he promised me this, he said to me, 
that now indeed he perceived how errors were 
present in his book (1808) (he had, for exam­
ple, used quadrilaterals with equal angles as a 
primary idea), however that he had not ceased 
to occupy himself with the matter, and was now 
about convinced, that without some datum the 
Euclidean postulate could not be proved, also 
that it was not improbable to him, that our ge­
ometry is only a chapter of a more general ge­
ometry.
Then I told him how you some years ago had 
openly said, that since Euclid’s time we had not 
in this really progressed; yes, that you had often

118
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
told me, how you through manifold occupation 
with this matter had not attained to the proof of 
the absurdity of such a supposition. Then when 
he sent me the book asked for, the enclosed pa­
per accompanied it, and shortly after (end of 
December) he asked me orally, when convenient 
to enclose to you this paper of his, and to ask 
you in his name to let him know when conve­
nient your judgement on these ideas of his. The 
book itself has, apart from all else, the advan­
tage that it contains a copious bibliography of 
the subject; which he also, as he tells me, has 
not ceased still further to add to.
Now comes (pp. 180-181) the precious enclosure, 
dated Marburg, December, 1818, which, though so 
brief, may fairly be considered the first published 
[not printed] treatise on non-Euclidean geometry. It 
is a pleasure to give this here in English for the first 
time.
The Non-Euclidean Geometry of 1818 
by Schweikart
There is a two-fold geometry—a geometry in the 
narrower sense — the Euclidean; and an astral 
science of magnitude.
The triangles of the latter have the peculiarity, 
that the sum of the three angles is not equal to 
two right angles.
This presumed, it can be most rigorously 
proven:
1. That the sum of the three angles in the triangle 
is less than two right angles;
2. that this sum becomes ever smaller, the more 
content the triangle encloses;
3. that the altitude of an isosceles right-angled 
triangle indeed ever increases, the more one 
lengthens the side, that it however cannot sur­
pass a certain line, which I call the constant.
Squares have consequently the following
form:
Is this constant for us half the earth’s axis (as 
a consequence of which each line drawn in the 
universe from one fixed star to another, which are 
ninety degrees apart from one another, would be 
a tangent of the earth-sphere), so is it in relation 
to the spaces occurring in daily life infinitely 
great.
The Euclidean geometry holds good only un­
der the presupposition, that the constant is in­
finitely great. Only then is it true, that the three 
angles of every triangle are equal to two right an­
gles; also this can be easily proven if one takes 
as given the proposition, that the constant is in­
finitely great.
Such is the brief declaration of independence of 
this hero. Nor was Schweikart’s courage and inde­
pendence without farther issue. Under his direct in­
fluence his own nephew Taurinus developed the real 
non-Euclidean trigonometry and published itin 1825 
with successful application to a number of problems.
Moreover this teaching of Schweikart’s made con­
verts in high places. In the letter of Bessell to Gauss 
of February 10, 1829 (p. 201) he says:
Through that which Lambert said, and what 
Schweikart disclosed orally, it has become clear 
to me, that our geometry is incomplete, and 
should receive a correction, which is hypotheti­
cal and, if the sum of the angles of the plane tri­
angle is equal to a hundred and eighty degrees, 
vanishes.
That were the true geometry, the Euclidean 
the practical, at least for figures on the earth.
The complete originality and independence of 
Schweikart and of Lobachevski is recognized as 
a matter of course in the correspondence between 
Gauss and Gerling, who writes (p. 238):
The Russian steppes seem therefore indeed a 
proper soil for these speculations, for Schweikart 
(now in Konigsberg) invented his ‘Astral­
Geometry’ while he was in Charkow.
This fixes the date of the first conscious creation and 
naming of the non-Euclidean geometry as between 
1812 and 1816.
Gauss adopts and uses for himself this first name, 
Astralgeometry (p. 226 (1832); p. 232 (1841)).
At length the true prince comes. On February 14, 
1832, Gauss receives the profound treatise of the 
young Bolyai Janos, the most marvellous two dozen 
pages in the history of thought. Under the first im­
pression Gauss writes privately to his pupil and friend 

HALSTED: Gauss and the Non-Euclidean Geometry
119
Gerling of the ideas and results as “mit grosser ele- 
ganz entwickelt.” He even says “I hold this young 
geometer von Bolyai to be a genius of the first mag­
nitude.”
Now was Gauss’s chance to connect himself honor­
ably with the non-Euclidean geometry, already inde­
pendently discovered by Schweikart, by Lobachevski, 
by Bolyai Janos.
Of two utterly worthless theories of parallels 
Gauss had already given extended notices in the 
Gottingische gelehrte Anzeigen (pp. 170-174, 183­
185).
To this marvel of Janos, Gauss vouchsafed never 
one printed word.
As Stackel gently remarks, this certainly con­
tributed thereto, that the worth of this mathematical 
gem was first recognized when John had long since 
finished his earthly career.
The 15th of December, 1902, will be the centenary 
of the birth of Bolyai Janos. Should not the learned 
world endeavor to arouse the Magyars to honor Hun­
gary by honoring then this truest genius her son?

History of the Parallel Postulate
FLORENCE P. LEWIS
American Mathematical Monthly 27 (1920), 16-23
Like the famous problems of construction, Euclid’s 
postulate concerning parallels is a thought that links 
the ages. Its history is a long story with a dramatic 
climax and far-reaching influence on modern mathe­
matical and general scientific thought. I wish to recall 
briefly the salient features of the story, and to state 
what seem to me its suggestions in regard to the teach­
ing of elementary geometry.
Euclid’s fifth postulate (called also the eleventh or 
twelfth axiom) states: “Ifa straight line falling on two 
straight lines makes the interior angles on the same 
side less than two right angles, the two straight lines 
if produced indefinitely meet on that side on which 
are the angles less than two right angles” [2]. The 
earliest commentators found fault with this statement 
as being not self-evident. Concerning the meaning of 
axiom, Aristotle says: “That which it is necessary for 
anyone to hold who is to learn anything at all is an 
axiom”; and “It is ignorance alone that could lead 
anyone to try to prove the axiom.” Without going 
into the difficult question of the precise distinction 
to the Greek mind between axiom and postulate, we 
may take it that the character of being indisputable 
pertained to each. Postulates stating that a straight 
line joining any two points can be drawn, that a circle 
can be drawn with given center and radius, or that 
all right angles are equal, were accepted, while the 
postulate of parallels was scrutinized and admitted at 
best with reluctance.
Proclus, writing in the fifth century A.D., gives 
some of the reasons for this attitude, and we may 
surmise others. The postulate makes a positive state­
ment about a region beyond the reach of possible 
observation or geometrical intuition. Proclus insinu­
ates that those who “suppose they have ground for 
instantaneous belief” are “yielding to mere plausi­
ble imaginings”; the conclusion is “plausible but not 
necessary” (see [1] and [2]). The converse is proved 
in Proposition 27, Book I of Euclid’s Elements, and 
there seems to be no reason why this proposition 
should be more or less self-evident than its converse. 
The fact that the two lines continually approach each 
other (even the meaning of this phrase requires fur­
ther elucidation) was not a convincing argument to 
the Greek geometer who was acquainted with the re­
lation of the hyperbola to its asymptote. The form 
of statement of the postulate is long and awkward 
compared with that of the others, and its obvious­
ness thereby lessened. There is evidence that Eu­
clid himself endeavored to prove the statement before 
putting it down as a postulate; for in some manuscripts 
it appears not with the others but only just before 
Proposition 29, where it is indispensable to the proof. 
If the order is significant, it indicates that the au­
thor did not at first intend to include this among 
the postulates, and that he finally did so only when 
he found that he could neither prove it nor proceed 
without it.
Most of the early geometers appear to have at­
tacked the problem. Proclus quotes and criticizes sev­
eral proofs, and gives one of his own. He instances one 
writer who even attempted to prove the falsity of the 
statement, the argument being similar to those used 
in Zeno’s paradoxes. The common opinion, however, 
seems to have been that the postulate stated a truth, 
but that it ought to be proved. Euclid had proved two 
sides of a triangle greater than the third, which is far 
more obvious than this. If the statement was true it 
should be proved in order to convince the doubters; 
if false, it should be removed. In no case should it be 
retained among the fundamental presuppositions. Sir 
Henry Savile (1621) and the Italian Saccheri (1733) 
refer to it as a blot or blemish on a work that is other­
wise perfect, and this expresses the common attitude 
of mathematicians until the first quarter of the nine­
teenth century.

LEWIS: History of the Parallel Postulate
121
Early attempts at proof usually took the form of 
a change in the definition of parallels, or the substi­
tution, conscious or unconscious, of a new assump­
tion. Neither of these methods resulted in satisfaction 
to any but their inventors; for the definitions usually 
concealed an assumption, and the new postulates were 
no more obvious than the old. Posidonius, quoted by 
Proclus, defines parallels as lines everywhere equidis­
tant. This begs the question; surely such parallels do 
not meet, but may there not be in the same plane 
other lines, not equidistant, which also do not meet? 
The definition involves also the assumption, that the 
locus of points in a plane at a given distance from a 
straight line is a straight line, and this was not self- 
evident. (It should be noted that even the meaning 
of the criterion suggests several questions of logic. 
If two lines are so placed that perpendiculars to one 
of them from points on the other are equal, will the 
same statement hold when the roles of the two lines 
are reversed? Will a perpendicular to one of two non­
intersecting lines necessarily be perpendicular to the 
other? Of course the answers to these questions are 
closely bound up with the very postulate under dis­
cussion [note by original editor]).
Ptolemy says that two lines on one side of a 
transversal are no more parallel than their extensions 
on the other side; hence if the two angles on one side 
are together less than two right angles, so also are 
the two angles on the other side, which is impossible 
since the sum of the four angles is four right angles. 
This is another way of saying that through a point but 
one parallel to a given line can be drawn, which is 
exactly Euclid’s postulate. Proclus himself assumes 
(with some concealment) that if a line cuts one of two 
parallels it cuts the other, which is again postulate 5.
Even as late as the close of the eighteenth century 
we find this argument advanced by one Thibault, and 
attributed also to Playfair. Let a line segment with 
one end A at a vertex of a triangle be rotated through 
the exterior angle. Translate it along the side until 
A comes to the next vertex and repeat the process. 
We finally arrive at the original position and must 
therefore have rotated through 360°. Hence the sum 
of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°; and, since 
Legendre had satisfactorily proved that this proposi­
tion entails Euclid’s postulate of parallels, the latter 
is at last demonstrated. The fact that the same pro­
cess could equally well be carried out with a spherical 
triangle, in which the angle-sum is not 180°, might 
have given him pause. The assumption that transla­
tion and rotation are independent operations is in fact 
equivalent to Euclid’s postulate. Heath [2] gives a 
long and instructive list of these substitutes. In the 
course of centuries the minds of those interested be­
came clear on one point: they did not wish merely to 
know whether it was possible to substitute some other 
assumption for Euclid’s, though this question has its 
interest; they wished to know primarily whether ex­
actly his form of the postulate was logically deducible 
from his other postulates and established theorems. 
To change the postulate was merely to re-state the 
problem.
After certain Arabs and Persians had had their say 
in their day, the curtain rises on the Italian Renais­
sance of the sixteenth century, where the problem 
was attacked with great vigor. French and British as­
sailants were not lacking. The first modern work de­
voted entirely to the subject was published by Cataldi 
in 1603. When the eighteenth century took up the un­
finished business of proving the parallel postulate, we 
find most of the giants of those days attacking the en­
emy of geometers with an even keener sense that with­
out victory there could be no peace. Yet d’Alembert 
toward the close of the century could still refer to the 
state of the theory of parallels as “the scandal of el­
ementary geometry.” KlUgel in 1763 examined thirty 
demonstrations of the postulate. He was perhaps the 
first to express doubt of its demonstrability. Lagrange, 
according to De Morgan, in about 1800, when in the 
act of presenting to the French Academy a prepared 
memoir on parallels, interrupted his reading with the 
exclamation, “Il faut que j’y songe encore,” [I must 
dream about it again.] and withdrew his manuscript.
While the results of these investigations were on the 
whole negative, certain positive and valuable results 
were nevertheless obtained. The relation between the 
parallel postulate and the angle sum of a triangle 
was clearly brought out. Legendre proved that ifin a 
single triangle the angle sum is two right angles, the 
postulate holds. Other equivalents are of interest. John 
Wallis and Laplace wished to assume: There exists a 
figure of arbitrary size similar to any given figure. 
Gauss could proceed rigorously provided he could 
prove the existence of a rectilinear triangle whose 
area is greater than any previously assigned area. W. 
Bolyai could have succeeded with the assumption that 
a circle can be passed through any three points not in 
a straight line. It must be borne in mind, moreover, 
that few mathematical questions have served so well 
as whetstones on which to sharpen the critical powers 
of mankind.
The work of the Italian priest Saccheri deserves no­
tice because his method is that which finally brought 
the discussion to a close. Though published in 1733 

122
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
his results did not become well known until after 
1880, and therefore had little influence on other in­
vestigations. Legendre’s Reflexions, published a hun­
dred years later, covered much of the same ground 
without advancing quite so far. The title of Saccheri’s 
work is Euclides ab omni Naevo Vindicatus [Euclid 
Vindicated of every Flaw]. His plan was to prove the 
postulate by assuming its contradictory and showing 
that an inconsistency followed. He succeeded in prov­
ing that, according as in one triangle the angle sum is 
greater than, equal to, or less than two right angles, 
the same holds in every triangle, and that accordingly 
Euclid’s postulate or one of its contradictories will 
hold. He makes three hypotheses which were recog­
nized later to correspond to the elliptic, Euclidean and 
hyperbolic geometries. But at the end of his work, in 
order to exhibit a contradiction when Euclid’s postu­
late is denied, he is forced to make use of a somewhat 
vague and unacceptable assumption about “the nature 
of a straight line.”
Gauss’s activity in connection with the parallel pos­
tulate is of especial interest because of its psychologic 
aspect. It is difficult for us to picture a mathemati­
cian hesitating to publish a discovery for fear of the 
outcry that its publication might produce—perhaps 
not many would be displeased to awaken an echo; 
yet this is believed by some to have been the atti­
tude of Gauss. Though he was keenly interested and 
thought deeply on the subject of parallels, he pub­
lished nothing; he feared, ashe said, “the clamor of the 
Baotians.” When forced to write a letter on the sub­
ject, he begs his correspondent to keep silence as to 
the information imparted. In 1831 he writes in a letter: 
“In the last few weeks I have begun to put down a few 
ofmy Meditations [on parallels] which are already to 
some extent forty years old. These I had never put in 
writing, so that I have been compelled three or four 
times to go over the whole matter afresh in my head. 
Also I wished that it should not perish with me.”
It is only when we call to mind the unrivalled 
place of honor held by Euclidean geometry among 
branches of human knowledge—a respect no doubt 
enhanced by the prominence given it in Kant’s Cri­
tique of Pure Reason—that we realize the uncom­
fortable position of one who even appeared to at­
tack its validity. Gauss’s meditations were leading 
him through tedious and painstaking labors to the 
conclusion that Euclid’s fifth postulate was not de­
ducible from his other postulates. The minds of those 
not conversant with the intricacies of the problem 
might easily rush to the conclusion that Euclid’s 
geometry was therefore untrue, and feel the whole 
structure of human learning crashing about their 
ears.
Between 1820 and 1830, the conclusion toward 
which Gauss tended was finally made sure by the 
invention of the hyperbolic non-Euclidean geome­
try by Lobachevsky and Johann Bolyai, working si­
multaneously and independently. The question—is 
Euclid’s fifth postulate logically deducible from his 
other postulates?—is answered by showing that the 
denial of this postulate while all the others are retained 
leads to a geometry as consistent as Euclid’s own. The 
method, we recall, was that used by Saccheri, whose 
intellectual conservatism alone prevented his reach­
ing the same result. The famous postulate is only 
one of three mutually exclusive hypotheses which 
are logically on the same footing. Thus was Euclid 
“vindicated” in an unexpected manner. Knowingly or 
not, the wise Greek had stated the case correctly, and 
only his followers had been at fault in their efforts for 
improvement. To quote Heath [2]: “We cannot but ad­
mire the genius of the man who concluded that such 
an hypothesis, which he found necessary to the valid­
ity of his whole system, was really indemonstrable.”
Thus in some sense the problem of the parallel 
postulate was laid to rest, but its spirit marches on. 
If the fifth postulate could without logical error be 
replaced by its contradictory, could the other postu­
lates be similarly treated? What is the nature of a 
postulate or axiom? What requirements should a sat­
isfactory system of axioms fulfill? Are we sure that 
accepted proofs will bear as keen scrutiny as that to 
which proofs of the postulate have been subjected? 
The facing of these questions has brought us to the 
modern critical study ofthe foundations of geometry. 
It has been realized that if geometry is to continue to 
enjoy its reputation for logical perfection, it should at 
least try to deserve it. The edge of criticism, sharp­
ened on the parallel postulate, is turned against the 
whole structure. Out of this movement has grown the 
critical examination of the foundations of algebra, of 
projective geometry, of mechanics, of logic itself; and 
the end is not in sight.
One obvious result of this critical study is that geo­
metrical axioms are not necessary truths, but merely 
presuppositions: they are the hypotheses on which the 
whole body of theorems rests. It is essential that a sys­
tem of axioms should be consistent with each other, 
and desirable that they be non-redundant, and com­
plete. No one has found Euclid’s system inconsistent, 
and redundancy would be a crime against elegance 
rather than against logic. But on the score of com­
pleteness Euclid is far from giving satisfaction. He

not infrequently states conclusions which could be 
arrived at only by looking at a figure, i.e., by space 
intuition; but we are all familiar with cases where 
space intuition misleads (for example, in the falla­
cious proof that all triangles are isosceles), and if 
we accept it as a guide how can we be sure that our 
intuitions will always agree? In constructing an equi­
lateral triangle Euclid says, “From point C where the 
two circles meet, draw • • •.” Perhaps they do meet— 
but not on the basis of anything previously stated. In 
dropping a perpendicular from a point to a line he says 
a certain circle will meet the line twice. Why should 
it not cut thrice or not at all? In another proof he says 
that a certain line will lie within a certain angle. I see 
that it does, but I do not see it proved. We are told in 
the midst of a proof to bisect an angle of a triangle and 
produce the bisector to meet the opposite side. How 
do we know it will meet? Because it is not a parallel. 
And probably it is not parallel because it is inside the 
triangle. How do we know it is inside; or, being in­
side, that it must get outside? When have these terms 
been defined? You may answer: It is not necessary 
to define them because everyone with common sense 
knows inside from outside without being told. “Who 
is so dull as not to perceive • • • ?” says Simson, one 
of Euclid’s apologists. This may be granted. But it 
must be pointed out that common sense knows that 
two straight lines cannot enclose space, yet this is 
given prominence as a axiom; or that a straight line 
is the shortest distance between two points, yet this is 
proved as a proposition. To state in words what dis­
tinguishes the inside from the outside of a polygon 
is not easy. The word between is likewise difficult of 
definition. But the modern geometer imbued with the 
critical spin feels it necessary to define such terms, 
and what is more, he finds a way of doing it.
Hilbert’s Grundlagen der Geometrie [3], published 
in 1899, is a classic product of this movement. It 
presupposes no space concepts at all, but only such 
general logical terms as “corresponds to”, “associated 
with”, “determined by”. Contrary to tradition, it does 
not begin by defining terms. The first sentence is: “I 
think of three systems of things which I call points, 
lines and planes.” Note the unadorned simplicity of 
the concept things. The axioms serve as definitions. 
They state, in non-spatial terms, relations between 
these “things”; that is to say, the points, lines and 
planes are such things as have such and such relations. 
“That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” 
Twenty-one axioms are found necessary, as against 
Euclid’s meager five. The whole work could be read 
and comprehended by a being with no space intuitions 
whatever. We could substitute the names of colors or 
sounds for points, lines and planes, and get on equally 
well. The ideal of making a thing “so plain that a blind 
man could see it” is literally realized. And the age- 
old ideal of a body of proved propositions, close-knit 
together by unassailable logic, is immeasurably nearer 
realization.
Although to the best of my knowledge no one has 
yet had the hardihood to invite a child of fourteen to 
consider “three systems of things”, the modern criti­
cal movement is not without bearing on problems of 
teaching. I wish, with proper humility, to put forward 
a few ideas on this subject.
If it is true that our traditional formal geometry, 
taken directly or indirectly from Euclid, is not the log­
ically perfect thing we had imagined, and if its modern 
perfected descendant is so abstract that not even the 
most rationalistic of us would venture to force it on be­
ginners, why not acknowledge these facts and bravely 
face anew the question of how we can best make the 
study of elementary geometry serve its proclaimed 
purpose of training the mind? I would suggest two 
lines along which progress might be made.
First, by sacrificing the ideal of non-redundancy 
in our underlying assumptions we could save time 
and stimulate interest by arriving more quickly at 
propositions whose truth is not immediately evident 
and which could be presented as subjects for inves­
tigation. Must we, because Euclid did it, prove that 
the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal? A 
child that has cut the triangle out of paper and folded 
it over knows as much as any proof can teach him. If 
to treat the proposition in this way is repugnant to the 
teacher’s logical conscience, let him privately label 
it “axiom” or “postulate”, and proceed, even though 
this proposition could have been proved. The place 
to begin producing arguments is the place where the 
truth of the proposition is even momentarily in doubt. 
One statement which presents itself with a question 
mark and is found after investigation to be true or to 
be false is worth ten obviously true statements proved 
with all the paraphernalia of hypothesis, conclusion, 
step one and step two, with references. The only ap­
parent reason for proving in the traditional way the 
theorems on the isosceles triangle and congruent tri­
angles is in order to familiarize the student with the 
above-mentioned paraphernalia. This brings me to 
my second suggestion.
Formal geometry has been looked upon as a com­
plete and perfect thing to which the learner can with 
profit play the sedulous ape. Yet I sometimes think 
that by emphasizing too early the traditional form 

124
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
of presentation of geometrical argument, and paying 
too little attention to the psychology of the learner, we 
may have corrupted some very good minds. “I wish to 
prove . . . ,” says the student; meaning, I wish to prove 
something stated and accepted as true in advance of 
argument. Should we not prefer to have our students 
say, “I wish to examine ..., to understand, to find 
out whether . . . , to discover a relation between . . . , 
to invent a means of doing ...”? What better slogan 
could prejudice desire than “I wish to prove”? The 
conscienceless way in which college debaters collect 
and enumerate arguments regardless of the issues in­
volved is another aspect of the same evil. A student 
said not long ago, “The study of mathematics would 
be good fun if we did not have to learn proofs.” It had 
never been brought home to her that mathematical 
reasoning is not a thing to be acquired, like a knowl­
edge of Latin verbs, but a thing to be participated in 
like any other form of exercise. Another said, “I can­
not apply my geometry because all we did in school 
was to learn the proofs and pass the examinations.”
In the midst of a proof the student hesitates and 
says, “I am sure this is the next step, but I cannot 
recall the reason for it.” The step and its reason would 
occur simultaneously to a mind that had faced the 
proposition as a problem and thought it through. I 
should like to see in every text an occasional page of 
exercises to prove or disprove. And if formal proofs 
must be printed in full, by all means let some of the 
proofs be wrong.
When the student has thus halted with one foot in 
the air in this progress from step to step down the 
printed page, on what does the ability to proceed de­
pend? On the ability to quote something: to quote, 
usually, a single statement—compact, authoritative, 
triumphantly produced. Surely it is bad training that 
leads the mind to expect to find support for its sur­
mises in a form so simple; and the temptation to sub­
stitute ability to quote in place of the labor of finding 
out the truth may be a real danger. What wonder if 
the mind so trained quotes Washington’s Farewell Ad­
dress or the Monroe Doctrine and feels that its work 
is done?
I do not mean that formal proof should never be 
given. It has its place as an exercise in literary com­
position; for it deals with the form in which thought 
is expressed. We should, however, take every possi­
ble precaution to see that the thought is first there to 
be expressed, lest the form be mistaken for the sub­
stance. Just how this is to be brought about I am not 
prepared to discuss, although I suspect that drawing 
and measurement in the early stages of study, prob­
lems of construction and investigation, and the total 
absence of complete proofs from the printed page, 
would help. I wish merely to state my belief that only 
in so far as we succeed in these aims shall we succeed 
in making geometry really train the mind.
It can be done, said the butcher, I think;
It must be done, I am sure.
One point further. Perhaps we are a little too modest 
about the importance of having our students retain 
something of the subject matter of the courses we 
teach. Evidently it is here that memory, based on 
understanding, should rightly be used. I sometimes 
think we might in some way collectively take out 
insurance against a student’s arriving at the junior 
year in college in the belief that two triangles are 
similar whenever they have a side in common.

The Rise and Fall of Projective Geometry
J. L. COOLIDGE
American Mathematical Monthly 41 (1934), 217-228
1 
The early period
The subject of projective geometry occupied an im­
portant position on the mathematical stage during 
a large portion of the nineteenth century. In recent 
years it has moved considerably towards the wings. 
Why did it appear? Why was it prominent? Why is 
it now moving aside? These are pertinent questions 
which perhaps it is worth our while to consider.
First of all, what is projective geometry anyway? 
It is sometimes defined as that branch of geometrical 
science which deals with those properties of figures 
which are unaltered by radial projection from plane 
to plane or space to space, no matter what the num­
ber of dimensions involved. This definition is at once 
too large and too restrictive. The fact that the pro­
jective plane has the connectivity 1 or that, looked 
upon as an assemblage of points, it has the power of 
the continuum—this fact is invariant under projec­
tion, but is not usually looked upon as a projective 
property. On the other hand, the properties of a figure 
which are conserved by projection are invariant under 
the wider group of linear transformations. The proper 
use of the adjective projective would seem to be to de­
scribe those properties of figures which are invariant 
under the general linear transformation but not under 
all transformations of a wider group. The subject is 
vast. We can at present deal only with the most sig­
nificant steps in its development.
At the outset we must make an important distinc­
tion. Projective properties were discovered and used 
long before any one grasped the idea of the projective 
group. The earliest and most fundamental projective 
invariant is the cross ratio of four collinear points. 
We do not know who first discovered this. By a very 
curious coincidence we have a statement of the cor­
responding theorem in spherical geometry which is 
earlier than any we have of the plane theorem. This 
occurs in Menelaus’ Spherica. The modern texts of 
Menelaus are based on various Hebrew manuscripts 
which differ widely one from another. Thus, Halley’s 
reconstruction does not give this particular theorem at 
all. The most recent and complete study of Menelaus 
is by Bjornbo, from which it seems safe to assume that 
Menelaus was cognizant of the theorem in spherical 
geometry. But who discovered the simpler theorem in 
the plane? We find it in the second volume of Pappus 
who wrote long after Menelaus’ time, but this portion 
of Pappus deals with Euclid’s lost book of porisms, 
which suggests that the invariance of the cross ratio 
was known to Euclid. Chasles has elaborated an inge­
nious reconstruction of Euclid’s work carrying to their 
logical conclusions the thirty-eight porisms given by 
Pappus. The reconstruction of this book has been in 
fact quite a favorite sport with geometers, and there 
has been not a little speculation as to what a porism is 
anyway. I am personally somewhat skeptical as to the 
ultimate importance of such conjectures. One certain 
thing is that Pappus, and probably Euclid who wrote 
six hundred years earlier, knew that the cross ratio is 
invariant.
After this first advance, the subject of projec­
tive geometry rested for the substantial period of 
twelve centuries. The first writer to return thereto was 
Johannes Werner who wrote in 1522. His rare work 
has excited a good deal of curiosity among people 
who have never seen it. He starts out by determining 
a parabola as a section of a cone as the Greeks did, 
but keeps his cone by him, instead of discarding it. 
He treats the hyperbola in the same way. He reaches a 
few interesting properties of these two curves in this 
fashion, but really finds nothing which is not much 
more simply found in the work of Apollonius. There 
is no sign that he had heard of a cross ratio.
125

126
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
For that we must wait another century and turn 
to the work of a much better known writer, Girard 
Desargues. When I say that Desargues was better 
known, I mean he is better known today. His work 
was little esteemed by his contemporaries and imme­
diate followers, with the very important exception of 
Pascal. This is not surprising. His style and nomen­
clature are weird beyond imagination. Fortunately, his 
editor Poudra has given the explanation of seventy- 
one strange, frequently botanical, terms which this 
writer affects. Who today could guess that a palm 
meant a straight line? When there are points thereon 
(a straight line with no points would be more novel), 
it becomes a trunk. A tree is a line with three pairs of 
points of an involution. The stump is the point which 
is the mate of the infinite point. The stump is engaged 
when the involution is elliptic.
The figure which Desargues finds most significant 
is three pairs of an involution, which he gives by 
equations of the form
OA x OA' = OB x OB' = OC x OC
The harmonic set is called an involution of four 
points. Menelaus’ theorem, which is attributed to 
Ptolemy, comes next and thereby it is proved that an 
involution is projected into an involution. Next come 
cones and cylinders, the latter being called cones with 
an infinite vertex.
The polar theory then appears, derived presumably 
from the special case of the circle. Desargues treats a 
diameter as the polar of an infinite point. He carries 
the whole polar theory much further than did Apollo­
nius, giving the quadrangle construction, the proper­
ties of a self-conjugate triangle, and the polar theory 
with regard to a surface. Moreover, he derives two 
very famous theorems which bear his name. The first 
says that the intersections of a line with the pairs of 
the opposite sides of a complete quadrangle and with 
any conic circumscribed to that quadrangle, are pairs 
of an involution. The essentially new element here is 
including the intersections with the conic. The quad­
rangle property was known to Pappus. The second 
theorem is that which tells us that if corresponding 
pairs of vertices of two triangles be collinear with the 
fixed point, the intersections of corresponding pairs 
of sides lie on a line.
The most famous pupil of Desargues was Blaise 
Pascal who also used the method of projection. There 
remains very little of what he actually wrote, and 
there is a tendency at present to reduce the previous 
somewhat exaggerated estimates of the importance 
of his work. There is, however, no doubt that he dis­
covered the hexagramma mysticum. There seems no 
doubt also that Pascal and Desargues were both aware 
of the invariance of the cross ratio.
Another writer of this period who had a positive 
passion for conic sections was La Hire. His first ven­
ture was in 1673 when he wrote a little book on plano- 
conics. He defined each conic separately by sums or 
differences of distances and wrote a text which would 
not be a bad introduction to put into the hands of a 
student today, except for the omission of the focus­
directrix property which was known to Pappus. His 
great work on conics, however, was a splendid fo­
lio which saw the light in 1685. It contains over three 
hundred theorems of a projective sort, as well as an ap­
pendix showing that all three hundred and sixty-four 
theorems of Apollonius can be proved by La Hire’s 
method of projection. The book is an attempt to col­
late all known material connected with conic sections 
and very nearly succeeds. There is ample evidence 
that he knew some of Desargues’ work, though, cu­
riously enough, he makes no mention of the great 
theorems which bear that writer’s name. I have the 
impression that he added little to our knowledge of 
projective geometry as such, and that his main object 
was to prove the superiority of his method over the 
ancient method of Apollonius or the modern ones of 
Descartes.
The subject of projective geometry dragged along 
for about a century after La Hire’s time. A few the­
orems were discovered by Newton, MacLaurin, and 
Braickenridge. The next writer deserving attention 
is Carnot. He, like La Hire, was possessed of the 
desire of overcoming the apparent increase in gen­
erality given by the algebraic methods of Descartes. 
His basic idea, which was much esteemed by sub­
sequent writers—I suppose for its obscurity—seems 
to have been this. We establish geometrical relations 
in the simplest case where all quantities involved are 
positive, but no further restrictions imposed. It is then 
assumed that these relations are identities which are 
unaltered when the figure is replaced by what is called 
a correlative, that is to say, the figure obtained from 
the first by continuous deformation. If one is willing 
to accept such an axiom, of course it is very conve­
nient. Carnot also wrote about the theory of transver­
sals, giving generalizations of theorems of Menelaus 
and Ceva.
There is just one other writer who deserves to be 
in this group—Brianchon. He is especially skillful in 
handling the theory of polar reciprocation, deducing 
from Pascal’s theorem the hexagon theorem which 
bears his name.

COOLIDGE: The Rise and Fall of Projective Geometry
127
2 The great period
A characteristic feature of the work of Brianchon 
and his predecessors was that they saw isolated the­
orems and ingenious methods for solving particular 
problems. The only general conception was that of 
beating Descartes. They spoke of the geometry of 
the ruler and sought the solution of geometrical ques­
tions which had but one answer, without going deeply 
into the question of what plane figures were unaltered 
by projection. The great advance marked by putting 
the question in this latter way was due to Jean-Victor 
Poncelet whose classic Treate de Proprietes Projec- 
tives des Figures was commenced in 1813 under the

The fundamental task, according to Poncelet, is 
to study the graphic properties of figures which he 
defines as those that do not involve distances or an­
gles. These latter he regards as contingent whereas 
the graphic ones are unaltered by a central projec­
tion. In looking for such invariants, he develops the 
theory of harmonic separation at great length, though, 
curiously enough, the invariance of the general cross 
ratio escapes him.
In his second chapter Poncelet makes a bold attack 
on the problem of imaginary points in pure geometry 
with a courage and thoroughness far ahead of any­
thing shown by his predecessors. The need for this 
first appears in connection with conic sections. If we 
connect the center of a central conic with the pole of 
a given line, we have the diameter conjugate to the 
line, which passes midway between the intersections 
of conic and line in case these intersections exist.
Suppose that we have an ellipse with a set of par­
allel chords. The conjugate diameter will bisect these 
chords and meet the ellipse in two points A and B . 
There is just one hyperbola having double contact 
with the ellipses at A and B whose asymptotes are 
conjugate diameters of the ellipse. The diameter in 
question bisects not only parallel chords of the el­
lipse but parallel chords of the hyperbola. Each curve 
is called a supplementary of the other, the chords of 
one being called ideal chords of the other. In this way 
Poncelet avoids using imaginary points which he de­
fines lamely enough as something which, originally 
real, becomes impossible or inconstructible when we 
pass from the first figure to a correlative in the sense 
of Carnot. He gives a long discussion of supplemen- 
taries and ideal chords and closes with a discussion of 
the line at infinity. He makes quite casually the fun­
damental remark that two coplanar circles should not 
be looked upon as completely independent figures, 
but as having two immovable, infinite points in com­
mon. This is one of the basic principles of modern 
geometry here announced for the first time.
Later Poncelet allows imaginary projections throw­
ing real chords into ideal ones. This is essentially 
Carnot’s correlative idea. Poncelet calls it the prin­
ciple of continuity. His statement is essentially this. 
If a theorem be true for an infinite number of real 
cases in a figure about which we make no particular 
restriction as to reality, it is true in the complex case 
also. This amounts analytically to saying that if we 
have an algebraic identity
f (a 1 ,a 2 ,...,an) = 0
which holds for all real values of the variables, it holds 
equally when the variables are complex, but whereas 
such an algebraic statement is precise, the geometric 
one is dangerously vague and may lead to error. An­
other weakness of Poncelet’s theory of ideal chords is 
that it is not easily carried over to curves of higher or­
der, a difficulty we shall return to later. But when all is 
said and done, the supplementaries and ideal chords 
give us something really tangible when dealing with 
imaginary elements, a great advance over the work of 
all previous and many subsequent writers.
In the second section Poncelet gives the general 
projective theory of conics and straight lines, Desar­
gues’ involution, harmonic separation, and so on. He 
notes the analogy between projection from plane to 
plane and the transformation of a plane into itself by 
means of a central similitude. This he generalizes into 
a transformation by homology, where corresponding 
points are collinear with a fixed point and correspond­
ing lines are concurrent on a fixed line. This again he 
generalizes to three dimensions as he generalizes the 
idea of harmonic separation.
The last important topic taken up by Poncelet is 
polar reciprocation. Special applications are made 
to the study of algebraic curves. He gives in an 
appendix a long account of a rather sordid contro­
versy between himself and Gergonne on this sub­
ject [see the following article by Pedoe in this vol­
ume]. Poncelet used his methods as a very convenient 
tool and discovered useful theorems thereby. Ger- 
gonne saw that the conic or quadric of reciprocation 
was of altogether subordinate importance. What was 
involved was a very deep geometric principle, but he 
never bothered to deduce many particular results.
I have paid special attention to Poncelet because he 
saw far deeper into the essential questions than any 
of his predecessors. He placed the subject in its right 

128
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
aspect, and one would expect that numerous followers 
would follow along his path to splendid results. Such 
was the case, but, curiously enough, only one of the 
followers of major importance was a countryman of 
his, Michel Chasles. This enterprising and ingenious 
writer enriched geometrical science by several fruitful 
ideas. On the other hand, he was decidedly uncritical 
as a historian of mathematics both of his own work 
and of that of others. In his much vaunted study of 
the history of geometrical methods, he makes the 
interesting admission that he has neglected German 
writers because he did not know their language.
The greatest contribution that Chasles made to pro­
jective geometry, and it was certainly very great, was 
in developing the theory of cross ratio of points, lines, 
or planes. He discovered the theorem which subse­
quently played a vital role in the work of Steiner, that 
four points ofa conic determine at any fifth point four 
lines with fixed cross ratio. Another fundamental idea 
was homography or the general linear transformation 
of the plane. Central projection and the homology of 
Poncelet are special cases of this.
If Chasles neglected the work of the German ge­
ometers, the reverse was not the case, for, contem­
porary with him, there sprang up across the Rhine a 
school of German geometers who closely watched the 
work of their French neighbors. The first of these in 
the synthetic field was Jacob Steiner whose Systema- 
tische Entwickelung der Abhangigkeit geometrischer 
Gestalten von einander appeared in Berlin in 1832. 
This is based on three fundamental principles.
(a) Points, lines, and planes are the essential data of 
geometry. Other figures must be constructed from 
these in definite fashion.
(b) The principle of duality, which appears at the 
outset and is carried through consistently, much 
of the work being in double column.
(c) A fundamental concept is that of projective fun­
damental forms, that is, ranges of points, pencils 
of lines, and pencils of planes.
Right here is a slip which is hard to account for. I 
cannot see that Steiner ever really gives a good defini­
tion of what he means by projective. A pencil of lines 
and the range they cut on a transversal are called pro­
jective, and they are said to remain so when the one or 
the other is moved about without disturbing distances 
or angles. This is clumsy and unsatisfactory. Essen­
tially, what he means by projectivity is a one-to-one 
relation where corresponding cross ratios and senses 
of description are the same. He shows that such a 
relation between two fundamental one-dimensional 
forms is determined when the fate of three elements 
is known. The proof is unsatisfactory as there is no 
proper way to handle questions of limits and conti­
nuity. There are no less than eighty pages, mostly in 
double column, devoted to questions of this sort.
The next form of figure to receive his attention is 
the cone, that is to say, the cone with circular sec­
tions. Construction of a conic by means of projective 
pencils comes in naturally here. There is one logical 
slip; at least I cannot see any proof that every conic 
so constructed can be cut from a circular cone. Ex­
cept for this defect, we have here the best possible 
approach to the study of the conics from the point 
of view of bringing out their projectively invariant 
properties. No wonder that all the simplest projective 
properties appear immediately in excellent form. The 
same methods are applied to the study of the regulus, 
that is to say, rulings of a surface of the second order. 
It is rather curious that he does not at once proceed 
to a study of the cubic space curve which is reached 
by the intersections of corresponding planes of three 
pencils.
The most characteristic feature of Steiner’s work 
is given by the adjective in its title, systematische. 
He has a consistent and uniform method for treating 
a variety of figures. He handles it beautifully. He is 
usually considered the greatest of the German school 
of projective geometers. It is my own feeling that in 
originality and power he falls far below his distin­
guished successor, Johann Karl Christian von Staudt. 
This deep thinker perceived two essential weaknesses 
in the synthetic geometry of his predecessors.
(a) The basis of projective relations was the cross 
ratio. This is projectively invariant but, as previ­
ously given, was based on distances and angles 
which are not in themselves unalterable.
(b) What are imaginary points anyway? What can be 
said about them, except that they are imaginary?
Let us give an outline of his method for developing 
geometry so as to meet these difficulties. In his first 
book Geometrie der Lage, published in 1847, he starts 
with points, lines, and planes as fundamental objects. 
Desargues’ two-triangle theorem appears early, lead­
ing to the configurations of a complete quadrilateral 
and quadrangle. It never occurred to him that we re­
ally need a proof that the diagonals of a complete 
quadrilateral are not concurrent. Next we have har­
monic separation and the fundamental definition that 
two one-dimensional forms are projective when their 

COOLIDGE: The Rise and Fall of Projective Geometry
129
members are in one-to-one correspondence and a har­
monic set corresponds to a harmonic set. Here at last 
we have projectivity defined with no relation to dis­
tance. The fact that von Staudt was not able to carry 
the thing through rigorously does not detract from 
the originality of the idea. The failure was right here. 
Sooner or later we have to prove that a projective 
transformation of a one-dimensional form into itself 
that leaves three elements in place, leaves all elements 
in place. Von Staudt could not do this as he had no 
axiom of continuity. Subsequent writers have filled 
the void and shown how cross ratios can be defined 
by successive harmonic constructions, exactly in the 
way that distances are defined by successively laying 
down a fixed length or aliquot part thereof.
Von Staudt defines a collineation of the plane as a 
transformation of point to point and line to line and 
shows that this is projective in that it carries harmonic 
elements into harmonic elements. He goes further, 
however, and defines a correlation, let us say in the 
plane, as a correspondence of point to line and points 
on a line to lines on a point. Poncelet reached such a 
transformation by polar reciprocation with respect to 
a conic. Von Staudt exactly reversed the process. Sup­
pose that we have a correlation which is involutory. It 
is easy to show that such things exist. Then if there be 
any point lying on the corresponding line, it is easy 
to show that there is a whole curve of points each of 
which lies on its line and this is defined as a conic. 
This definition is clearly self-dual and leads at once 
to the classic theorems of Pascal, Brianchon, Desar­
gues, and Steiner. The method has the advantage that 
it is immediately applicable in three or more dimen­
sions. He did not make the mistake of supposing that 
if we have an involutory correlation in three dimen­
sions, the points lying in the corresponding planes 
necessarily generate a quadric surface. He was famil­
iar enough with the null-system usually ascribed to 
Mobius.
Von Staudt was acutely conscious that the treat­
ment of imaginary elements in pure geometry was 
extremely unsatisfactory. Poncelet’s system of ideal 
chords and supplementaries was the only contribu­
tion to the subject that had any real substance. He set 
to work to remedy this defect in truly heroic fashion. 
Suppose that on a straight line we have an elliptic in­
volution. A point and its mate in the involution trace 
the straight line in the same sense. “Very well,” says 
von Staudt, “we will define an elliptic point involu­
tion and a sense of description as an imaginary point. 
The same involution with the contrary sense shall be 
defined as the conjugate imaginary point. We can de­
fine an imaginary plane as an elliptic involution in a 
pencil of planes with a sense of description. Reverse 
the sense and we get the conjugate plane. An imag­
inary line is defined as the system of points in two 
planes which are not both real.”
These definitions of von Staudt are certainly revo­
lutionary. It was a bold step to define as an imaginary 
point something that is made up of an infinite number 
of real points. Von Staudt could not foresee the anal­
ogy to Dedekind’s definition of an irrational number 
as a split in the real number system. What he did do 
was to show by the most careful reasoning that the 
new elements thus introduced obeyed just the laws of 
the old ones. Two of his points determine one of his 
lines which lies completely in any one of his planes 
through the two points, etc. It is true that his work 
has the weakness that sense of description is an in­
tuitive concept which he is not able to define and 
about which he has no definite mathematical axioms. 
This difficulty can be overcome by methods subse­
quently invented. His treatment, which is found in 
his subsequent Beitrage zur Geometrie der Lage, is a 
marvellous piece of careful geometry.
But von Staudt did not rest even here. Chasles had 
based his projective geometry on the idea of the cross 
ratio which is defined in terms of distances. Von 
Staudt perceived that this was a blemish which he 
undertook to correct. Four collinear points, four lines 
or planes of a pencil are called a throw. The value of 
this is defined as unchanged by a double interchange 
in the pairs of elements, and two throws connected 
by a train of projective transformations are defined as 
an equivalent. He proceeds to develop an algebra of 
throws. If we wish to add two throws, we transform 
them projectively into two others with three common 
elements and find the sum by two successive har­
monic constructions. In the same way the product of 
two throws is to be found by elimination between two 
with three common elements. There follows a very 
careful demonstration that in this algebra the usual 
commutative, associative, and distributive laws are 
obeyed. If a harmonic set be defined as a throw hav­
ing the value of -1, we can show that any real throw 
of points is equal to the cross ratio in the usual sense.
But von Staudt does not stop with real throws. He 
considers complex ones as well. He fixes his attention 
on an imaginary line of the second sort which has no 
real points. Let us take four complex points of ABCD 
on such a line and connect them with their conjugates 
ABC'D' by four real skew lines. Three of these 
will determine a ruled quadric surface including the 
given complex line and its conjugate. The necessary 

130
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
and sufficient condition that the throw of the original 
four points should be real is that the four lines should 
be generators of one quadric. A set of points on such 
an imaginary line with the property that the cross 
ratio of any four is real, was defined as a chain. Such 
a set of points can be projectively transformed into 
the real points of a real line. This theory was further 
developed by Luroth and later by our own Veblen and 
Young.
3 The gradual decline
The work of von Staudt marks the close of the great 
period in the history of synthetic geometry. A def­
inite geometrical method had been elaborated. The 
work of subsequent geometers consisted principally 
in applying to it such problems as lent themselves 
readily to treatment. For fifty years the devotees of 
this branch of science were many and enthusiastic. 
Progress consisted, however, chiefly in extending the 
methods already discovered to new problems rather 
than in finding new methods.
An exception to this rule must be made to cover 
the case of geometrical transformations. Poncelet had 
a clear grasp of the idea of central projection and 
the cognate idea of homology. Chasles constructed 
the general projective transformation. Steiner devel­
oped something essentially different in the form of 
a quadratic transformation by means of a skew pro­
jection. Here a point-to-point transformation is es­
tablished between two planes by means of projecting 
lines that do not go through a fixed point but do in­
tersect two skew lines. A straight line in one of the 
planes will correspond to a conic in the other that 
passes through three fixed points. Another type of 
quadratic transformation is the projective generaliza­
tion of circular inversion, where corresponding points 
are collinear with a fixed point and conjugate with re­
gard to a fixed conic. A better form was developed 
by Seydewitz, where a point in the plane is carried 
to the single point conjugate to it with regard to a 
pencil of conics. Many other forms of one-to-one 
geometric transformations were discovered. A com­
plete account will be found in the four volumes of 
Sturm. There are, however, many pitfalls in the path 
of one who would handle geometrical transforma­
tions by means of pure geometry alone, especially 
when he becomes involved in the complicated singu­
larities of higher curves and surfaces. It is safer to 
treat the whole question algebraically as a part of the 
great subject of Cremona transformations.
It was inevitable that students of synthetic geome­
try should be forced sooner or later to face the ques­
tion of applying their favorite methods to the study of 
general algebraic curves and algebraic surfaces, and 
that forces upon us the question of whether synthetic 
methods really lend themselves well to the study of 
such curves or surfaces. And at this point I am forced 
to confess that it seems to me the answer must be 
frankly negative, though able geometers have striven 
to prove the contrary.
One of these was Cremona, whose long memoir 
Introduzione alla teoria geometrica della curve pi- 
ane was written in 1862. When we examine this work 
in detail we are forced to acknowledge its defects. 
The author speaks freely of real and complex points 
without ever saying just what he means by the latter. 
It is true that we can, if we wish, lay down a system 
of axioms for the projective geometry of the complex 
plane, but Cremona never bothered to do anything of 
the sort. In his time real points were supposed to be 
given us by nature and no man had a right to speak 
of complex points, which nature certainly did not 
provide, without saying what he meant thereby. Cre­
mona’s various proofs involve a good deal of credulity 
on the part of the reader. For instance, he has assumed 
without a shadow of proof that the number of intersec­
tions of two plane curves is a function of their orders 
alone and independent of whether they be reducible 
or irreducible. There is a similar optimism about the 
number of parameters on which a curve of order n 
depends. The whole work is shot through with doubt­
ful assumptions. What the writer really does is to use 
a few essential theorems about the general equation 
of degree n and then ungratefully discard it.
The two great difficulties have now been 
mentioned—a sound theory of complex points and 
something definite to replace the theory of the gen­
eral equation. Von Staudt, as mentioned above, con­
quered the first difficulty once and for all in most 
brilliant fashion, but his method was so cumbersome 
that in practice nobody could be expected to use it. 
The only way to avoid the second obstacle was by 
means of mathematical induction. The most ambi­
tious attempt to use this process was made in 1886 
by Kotter in his Theorie der algebraischen ebenen 
Curven (Berlin 1887). His favorite implement is the 
general involution.
We may lead up to this as follows. Suppose that 
we have a projective transformation of one of our 
fundamental forms, let us say the straight line, into 
itself, whereby the points ABC. . . correspond to 
B'A'C'.... There will be a pair of self-corresponding 

COOLIDGE: The Rise and Fall of Projective Geometry
131
points, either a real pair or a conjugate imaginary pair 
in the von Staudt sense. Now let all of these points 
remain fixed, except C' which traces the whole line. 
These pairs of self-corresponding points will trace 
that involution which is determined by the pairs AA' 
and BB' and the pairs of this are projectively re­
lated to the range traced by C'. Suppose now that we 
know what we mean by a projective relation between 
a range of points and the groups of an involution of 
order n - 1. Suppose that we have such an involution 
with the group
A1A2,...,An-1,
B1B2,...,Bn-1, 
C1C2,...,Cn-1
projectively related to the points B'A'C', that ev­
erything remain fixed except C' which traces the 
line. The groups of n, real or imaginary, self­
corresponding points will trace the involution of order 
n determined by the two groups
A A1 A 2 , ..., An -1, BB 1 B 2 ,..., Bn -1, ....
In this way we get the general involution. Its establish­
ment involves some delicate considerations of conti­
nuity and analysis situs as well as the von Staudt 
theory. When all is ready, Kotter establishes a pro­
jective relation between a pencil of curves of order r 
and one of order n - r, and thus generates a curve of 
order n.
This is the general idea of Kotter’s ambitious at­
tempt. It is a remarkable piece of geometry, also a 
very difficult one, so that I personally marvel at the 
thought that I once read it through. I do not wonder 
that the Berlin Academy awarded it a prize in 1886 or 
that few have had the temerity to read the thing since. 
It seems to me that there is really a better approach 
which consists in generalizing von Staudt’s concep­
tion of a polar. Suppose that we know a good deal 
about a thing which we call a curve of order n - 1, 
as well as a pencil and a two-parameter net of such 
curves, and that we know what we mean by the first 
polar of a point with regard to such a curve. It may be 
defined, with Guccia, as the locus of points of contact 
of tangents from a point P to curves of order n - 1, 
linearly dependent on a given curve, and n - 1 arbi­
trary lines through P. Suppose further that we have 
a two-parameter set of curves of order n - 1 which 
correspond to the points of the plane in such a way 
that the first polar of P with regard to the curve cor­
responding to Q is identical with the first polar of Q 
with regard to the curve corresponding to P . Then, 
the locus of points which lie on the curves which cor­
respond to them is a curve of order n, and the curve of 
order n - 1 corresponding to a given point is its first 
polar with regard to the new curve. I think that this is 
a better approach than Kotter’s. I once carried it out a 
short distance in an article in the Circolo Matematico 
di Palermo, Rendiconti (vol. XI, 1915) in ignorance of 
the fact that the same idea had been previously devel­
oped by Thieme (Die Definition der geometrischen 
Gebilde, Zeitschriftfur Mathematik und Physik, vol. 
24, 1879). And yet I now doubt whether it would be 
worth while to follow such a lead, for the algebraic 
approach is so much easier and more satisfactory. It 
is for this reason that the latest advances in projective 
geometry, before it finally flickered out, layina closer 
examination of the fundamental postulates.
We have seen that von Staudt’s great work had cer­
tain intuitive elements such as the sense of description 
ona line, continuity, separation, etc. It never occurred 
to either him or any contemporary that the diagonals 
of a complete quadrilateral might be concurrent. All 
of these points were cleaned up by a number of writers 
who dealt with the postulates of projective geometry. 
At the risk of creating offense by citing one at the 
expense of others, I would mention the two-volume 
work of Veblen and Young. Here have we not only a 
rigorous postulational basis for projective geometry, 
but the obvious step is taken of extending it to n di­
mensions. There is a discussion of nets of rationality 
which are essentially the same thing as generaliza­
tions of the von Staudt chain, of finding projective 
geometries and other strange systems obtained by 
varying the axioms. It is not too much to say that this 
is the last great work dealing with this field.
It is hard to escape the sad conclusion that the 
field of synthetic projective geometry is pretty much 
worked out. This gloomy foreboding can only be put 
forth with all possible caution. There have been so 
many times when the geometrical field, even the most 
elementary field, has appeared to be completely ex­
hausted and then surprisingly new and attractive re­
sults have appeared. Elementary geometry, involving 
nothing more complicated than a little trigonome­
try, made far more progress in the nineteenth cen­
tury than in the sixteen centuries preceding, but 
the analogy is not perfect. Most of the theorems 
about the straight line, circle, and sphere which we 
can demonstrate at all, find their easiest proofs by 
the most elementary means. Such is not the case 
with projective geometry. An algebraic handling is 
almost always the easiest and generally the most 
adaptable.

132
Until and unless some totally new principle is dis­
covered, the subject of synthetic projective geome­
try is no longer a very fruitful field for original re­
search. On the other hand, it would be a disaster to 
the whole geometric fabric if a time ever came when 
synthetic methods were completely abandoned. Not 
only have they a permanent beauty which no one 
who has ever studied them can forget, but they af­
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
ford an invaluable insight into the inner significance 
of geometrical science and an invaluable training for 
any geometer. If Plato wrote over the gate of the 
Academy, “Let none ignorant of geometry presume 
to enter here,” surely we may write today in the same 
spirit, “Let none ignorant of the fundamentals of syn­
thetic projective geometry presume to the title of 
geometer.”

Homogeneous coordinates
It is agreed, even by those who disparage them (see 
[6], p. 712) that barycentric coordinates, first intro­
duced by August Ferdinand Mobius [4] in 1827, 
were the first homogeneous coordinates systemati­
cally used in geometry. The Mobius idea, in plane 
geometry for example, is to attach masses p, q and r, 
respectively, to three non-collinear points A, B and 
C in the plane under consideration, and then to con­
sider the centroid P = pA + qB + rC of the three 
masses. The point P necessarily lies in the plane, and 
varies as the ratios p : q : r vary. As Mobius points 
out:
And conversely, given any point P in the plane, 
the ratios p : q : r are always and uniquely de­
terminable.
It will be noted that Mobius was using position 
vectors for his points in 1827, and reading of the text 
shows that he developed all the techniques of homo­
geneous coordinates known nowadays, changing the 
simplex of reference, if necessary, and so on. For a 
more accessible account, see Section 4.2 of [5]. No­
body has suggested that there is a better system of 
coordinates for projective geometry.
But new ideas are not always easily accepted. All 
the same, it is strange nowadays to read some of 
Cauchy’s criticisms (XI of [4]). He says:
only by deeper study can one decide whether 
the advantages of this method outweigh its dif­
ficulties . . . One should be quite sure that he is 
making a considerable advance in science before 
introducing so many new terms and requiring 
readers to follow studies which confront them 
with so much strangeness.
It should be said at this point that the Mobius work 
is beautifully lucid and unpedantic. As Mobius’ edi­
tor, Richard Baltzer, points out, Cauchy’s next remark 
shows that Cauchy, like most reviewers, had not read 
Mobius very carefully. Cauchy says:
One must suppose that the author of the barycen­
tric calculus was unaware of the general theory 
of reciprocity which Gergonne has established 
between the properties of systems of points and 
systems of lines.
In fact Mobius, in Chapters IV and V of the third 
section of his book, gives a very clear statement, with 
applications, of the principle of reciprocity and the 
perhaps more general principle of duality, and these 
discoveries were made independently of Poncelet and 
Gergonne.
Gauss, writing to Schumacher rather later, in 1843, 
also confessed that he found the new ideas of Mobius 
difficult, and commits himself to a rather heavy philo­
sophical statement about new ideas in general. This 
can also be read in the introduction to the Mobius 
work (XII, [4]). But the editor Baltzer, although an 
advocate for Mobius, makes a statement which I 
have been unable to verify. He says that although 
the Mobius coordinates are of special significance 
historically, they were soon overtaken by homoge­
neous coordinates and the introduction of homoge­
neous equations (IX, [4]). While the Mobius work 
was being printed, says Baltzer, Plucker, using ideas 
of Gergonne, with some points of contact with Lame 
and Bobillier, was writing his Entwicklungen [8] in 
which the homogeneous coordinates of a point with 
respect to three lines and four planes occur more and 
more.
133

134
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
It is true that Mobius never writes down an equation 
for his lines or his conics. Everything is treated para­
metrically, as we say nowadays. I have read Plucker 
carefully, in an attempt to confirm Baltzer’s assertion, 
and I find that although Plucker conceives the idea 
of the homogeneous coordinates [u, v, w] of a line 
uX + vY + w =0at a very early stage in his two- 
volume work, there is a very definite psychological 
block with regard to the homogeneous coordinates 
of a point. These are mentioned for the first time in 
Section 416 of the second volume, where he says of 
the equation Ux+ Vy+ Wz=0:
This new form of the equation of a straight line, 
which is homogeneous in the three variables y, x, 
and z , seems to me to be preferable in regard to 
elegance and symmetry in all those situations 
where no elimination is involved.
It is significant that Plucker rules out the use of 
homogeneous coordinates in elimination, and in fact 
he devotes nearly 200 pages to the conic considered 
as a line-locus in his second volume, and only about 
140 pages to the conic considered as a point-locus in 
his first volume, and there is no systematic use of ho­
mogeneous point-coordinates in these two volumes.
What Baltzer may refer to is Plucker’s very inge­
nious use of what we call abridged notation nowa­
days. The simple, but seminal, idea behind this is 
that if U =0 and V =0 are the equations of two 
curves, then U + kV =0, for all values of k,isa 
curve which passes through the intersections of the 
two given curves. When the curves are lines, Plucker 
uses, in essence, the trilinear coordinates of a point in 
proving his many theorems about triangles. Trilinear 
coordinates are the distances of a point from the sides 
of a given triangle in two dimensions, and the sides 
of a given tetrahedron in three dimensions, and they 
are a form of homogeneous coordinates.
But there is no doubt that Plucker had an enormous 
influence on the development of analytical geometry, 
and there is little that one can add to his extensive 
treatment of circles, for example. He even uses in­
version. Mobius avoids circles, and as we know, they 
are not too easy to deal with in homogeneous coordi­
nates. Laguerre had not yet arrived on the scene, and 
the analytic treatment of the circular points at infinity 
is very helpful in this connection. But Mobius, be­
sides solving many delightful problems in a masterly 
way, is the only author I have ever encountered who 
considers the different types of conic which can be 
drawn through five given points in a plane. His ap­
proach is a mixture of notions of convexity and the 
use of theorems already derived by his methods, and 
he says:
Given five points chosen arbitrarily in a plane, 
the chance that the unique conic which can be 
drawn through these points is a hyperbola rather 
than an ellipse is -^~ : 1.
This is, of course, a pre-Cantorian statement, but 
it embodies a definite theorem. Does it come under 
the heading of elementary or advanced problems? 
Treated algebraically, the theorem gives information 
about the range of a certain polynomial in 10 vari­
ables.

The principle of duality
In projective geometry we have a remarkable method 
which produces another, usually distinct theorem, 
called a dual theorem, from any given theorem, by 
a simple transliteration of the terms involved in the 
statement of the given theorem. The “dictionary” for 
the transliteration depends on the space we are work­
ing in. We shall restrict ourselves in this note to 
the plane, in which case, to obtain a dual theorem, 
we interchange point and line, lying on and passing 
through, collinear and concurrent, and intersection 
and join. The Desargues theorem on perspective tri­
angles dualizes to the converse theorem, which can be 
proved from the direct theorem, so that we say the De­
sargues theorem is a self-dual theorem, and the Pap­
pus theorem dualizes to a theorem which looks dif­
ferent from the given theorem, but can also be proved 
by the use of the Pappus theorem, so that we say the 
Pappus theorem is also self-dual. These facts are of 
fundamental importance in the foundations of geom­
etry, and enable us to assert that the so-called prin­
ciple of duality is, in fact, a theorem of duality. Karl 
Menger ([3], pp. 201, 211) writes both fundamental 
theorems in self-dual forms, so that the transliteration 
given above does not essentially change the statement 
of the theorem.
The richness of the applications of duality is enor­
mously increased by the fact that the dual ofa conic, 
considered as a set of points, is a conic considered as 
a set of tangents (see Section 78.1 in [5]). Thus the 
Pascal and Brianchon theorems are dual theorems for 
a conic.
The statements in the first paragraph above make 
no mention of coordinates. If we use homogeneous 
coordinates (x, y, z) for points in a projective plane, 
the equation of a line is uX + vY + wZ =0, and we 
can introduce the homogeneous coordinates [u, v, w]

of a line. The condition that the point (x, y, z) should 
be incident with the line [u, v, w] is
ux + vy + wz =0,
and the symmetry of this relation between point­
coordinates (x, y, z) and line- (or tangential-) coor­
dinates [u, v, w] is the basis for the theorem of dual­
ity, since in any relation involving points, lines and 
incidences we can replace (x, y, z) by [x, y, z], and 
[u, v, w] by (u, v, w), and the incidence relations are 
undisturbed.
We note that the line [x, y, z] is the polar line of the 
point (x, y, z) with respect to the conic
X2 +Y2 +Z2 =0, 
(1)
and so the theorem of duality can be interpreted as a 
theorem of reciprocal polars. We also note that any 
polarity of a plane involves a conic as the locus of 
points which lie on their corresponding polars. For the 
polar p ofapointP is given by the equation p = AP, 
where A is a symmetric matrix, and P lies on p if 
and only if P T AP =0. The conic, as in (1), may not 
contain real points but this in no way invalidates its 
use as a deus ex machina. It is interesting to find that 
George Salmon ([10], p. 126) says:
The principle of duality may be established in­
dependently of the method of reciprocal polars 
by showing . . . that all the equations we employ 
admit of a two-fold interpretation.
Salmon then introduces tangential coordinates for 
planes (he is working in three dimensions) as we 
introduced them for lines above. But this is mak­
ing unconscious use of the god in the machine, the 
quadric surface
X2 + Y 2 + Z2 + T2 =0. 
(2)
Veblen and Young ([11], p. 29) say:
The principle of duality was first stated explicitly 
by Gergonne (1826), but was led up to by the 
writings of Poncelet and others during the first 
quarter of the 19th century.
Controversy as to priority clouded a large part of 
Poncelet’s life. In a supplement to the second edi­
tion (1866) of the second volume of his great Traite 
des Proprietes Projectives des Figures [9], first pub­
lished in 1822, Poncelet devotes 132 large pages in 
small print to diatribes against the many geome­
ters who seemed not to be on his side in this con­
troversy. He attacks Gergonne, of course, but also 
PlUcker and Mobius, each of whom claimed indepen­
dent discovery of the principle of reciprocal polars; 
but Poncelet reserves very special blasts for Chasles, 
remarking acidly that Cremona had called Chasles 
the Archimedes, and that de Jonquieres had named 
him the La Fontaine of modern geometry! Poncelet 
also has sideswipes at Cayley, remarks with surprise 
that Sylvester writes good French, and even brings in 
Salmon, referring to the professor of divinity as un 
journaliste philosophe, with a reference to a footnote 
on p. 241 of the 1862 edition of Salmon’s Analyti­
cal Geometry of Three Dimensions, which I have not 
been able to locate.
Amidst all this smoke there is little fire. However, 
Poncelet does accuse Gergonne (II of [9], p. 375) of 
stating that the number of tangents or tangent planes 
common to two curves or three surfaces is equal to 
the product of the degrees of their equations, which 
is certainly incorrect. In fact, Poncelet asserts that 
the principle of duality, as enunciated and used by 
Gergonne and his supporters, cannot deal with met­
rical theorems either. It should be stated at this point 
that the method of reciprocal polars, called point re­
ciprocation, when applied to circles, using a circle 
as fundamental conic, produces theorems about con­
ics and their foci or, conversely, produces theorems 
about circles from given theorems about conics and 
their foci ([2]; see also [7]). The principle of duality 
can hardly transform theorems in this way.
Positive statements about the Poncelet-Gergonne 
rivalry are rare, but before we discuss one made by 
Coxeter, an acid comment made by PlUcker is worth 
noting (F. N. VI, vol. II [8]). PlUcker is commenting 
on the alleged superiority of the Gergonne principle 
of duality:
Above all, every thought which does not imme­
diately arise from the nature of the case, but is 
taken over from a metaphysical abstraction, eas­
ily exercises a dictatorial rule over us, which 
always carries its own punishment, imposing 
bonds on unrestricted modes of thought.
Coxeter, in an exercise ([1], p.75), asserts that Ger- 
gonne must be regarded as the victor in his historic 
contest with Poncelet. Coxeter first shows that the De­
sargues configuration is self-polar (p.74), points in the 
configuration mapping onto lines in the configuration 
in a certain polarity, and then considers the Pappus 
configuration. It turns out that this is self-polar if and 
only if three lines in the configuration are concurrent, 
which would involve a specialization of the Pappus 
configuration. Coxeter then says:

136
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
Since the general Pappus configuration is self­
dual without being self-polar, the old contro­
versy between Poncelet and Gergonne is settled 
in the latter’s favour.
I feel that this is a judgement against which history 
must appeal, that the criteria used are not valid, and 
seem to depend, in the final analysis, on a semantic 
misunderstanding. Ifwe call the principle of recipro­
cal polars (P), and the principle of duality (G), then 
application of (P) to any theorem in the projective 
plane, using the fundamental conic (1), the ground 
field being that of the complex numbers, produces a 
theorem identical with that obtained by applying (G), 
and no more specialized, as far as the figure goes, than 
that obtained by applying (G). For any specialization 
of the dual figure, obtained by applying (P), which 
involves the lines pi and the points Pi , implies a spe­
cialization of the initial figure involving the points pi 
and the lines Pi .
On the other hand, the application of (P) produces 
theorems which cannot be produced by (G), as we 
have already remarked. It is possible that (G) may op­
erate outside the regions of projective geometry over 
the complex numbers, as a general property of the 
space (unepropriete genemle de I’etendue), to quote 
the Gergonne phrase which disturbed Plucker, where 
(P) may have no validity, there being no conics, for 
instance, and further discussions on this ancient but 
fascinating controversy are surely to be welcomed.

A note on the history of the Cantor Set 
and Cantor function
JULIAN F. FLERON
Mathematics Magazine 67 (1994), 136-140
A search through the primary and secondary liter­
ature on Cantor yields little about the history of the 
Cantor set and Cantor function. In this note, we would 
like to give some of that history, a sketch of the ideas 
under consideration at the time of their discovery, 
and a hypothesis regarding how Cantor came upon 
them. In particular, Cantor was not the first to dis­
cover “Cantor sets”. Moreover, although the original 
discovery of Cantor sets had a decidedly geometric 
flavor, Cantor’s discovery of the Cantor set and Can­
tor function was neither motivated by geometry nor 
did it involve geometry, even though this is how these 
objects are often introduced (see for example [24]). 
In fact, Cantor may have come upon them through a 
purely arithmetic program.
The systematic study of point set topology on the 
real line arose during the period 1870-1885 as math­
ematicians investigated two problems:
1. conditions under which a function could be inte­
grated,
2. uniqueness of trigonometric series.
It was within the framework of these investigations 
that the two apparently independent discoveries of the 
Cantor set were made; each discovery was linked to 
one of these problems.
Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) spent consider­
able time on the first question, and suggested condi­
tions he thought might provide an answer. Although 
we will not discuss the two forms his conditions took 
([16], pp. 17-18), we note that one of these conditions 
is important as it eventually led to the development 
of measure-theoretic integration (see [16], p. 28). 
An important step in this direction was the work of 
Hermann Hankel (1839-1873) during the early 
1870s. Hankel showed, within the framework of Rie­
mann, that the integrability of a function depends on 
the nature of certain sets of points related to the func­
tion. In particular, “a function, he [Hankel] thought, 
would be Riemann-integrable if and only if it were 
point-wise discontinuous ([16], p. 30),” meaning, in 
modern terminology, that for every a > 0 the set of 
points x at which the function oscillated by more than 
a in every neighborhood ofx was nowhere dense. Ba­
sic to Hankel’s reasoning was his belief that sets of the 
form {1/2n } were prototypes for all nowhere dense 
subsets of the real line. Working under this assump­
tion Hankel claimed that all nowhere dense subsets 
of the real line could be enclosed in intervals of arbi­
trarily small total length (i.e., had zero outer content) 
([16], p. 30). As we shall see, this is not the case (see 
also [20]).
Although Hankel’s investigation into the nature of 
certain point sets would become extremely important,
as was the case with Dirichlet and Lipschitz, 
it was the inadequacy of his understanding of 
the possibilities of infinite sets—in particular, 
nowhere dense sets—that led him astray. It was 
not until it was discovered that nowhere dense 
sets can have positive outer content that the 
importance of negligible sets in the measure- 
theoretic sense was recognized
([16], p. 32). The discovery of such sets, nowhere 
dense sets with positive outer content, was made by 
H. J. S. Smith (1826-1883), Savilian Professor of 
Geometry at Oxford, in a paper [22] of 1875. Af­
ter an exposition of the integration of discontinuous 
functions, Smith presented a method for constructing 
nowhere dense sets that were much more “substan­
tial” than the set {1/2n }. Specifically, he observed 
the following:
137

138
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
Let m any given integral number greater than 
2. Divide the interval from 0 to 1 into m equal 
parts; and exempt the last segment from any sub­
sequent division. Divide each of the remaining 
m - 1 segments into m equal parts; and exempt 
the last segments from any subsequent subdivi­
sion. If this operation be continued ad infinitum, 
we shall obtain an infinite number of points of di­
vision P upon the line from 0 to 1. These points 
lie in loose order . . . ([22], p. 147).
In modern terminology Smith’s ‘loose order’ is 
what we refer to as nowhere dense. Implicit in Smith’s 
further discussion is the assumption that the exempted 
intervals are open, so the resulting set is closed. To­
day this set would be known as a general Cantor set, 
and this seems to be the first published record of such 
a set.
Later in the same paper, Smith shows that by divid­
ing the intervals remaining before the nth step into 
mn equal parts and exempting the last segment from 
each subdivision we obtain a nowhere dense set of 
positive outer content. Smith was well aware of the 
importance of this discovery, as he states, “the result 
obtained in the last example deserves attention, be­
cause it is opposed to a theory of discontinuous func­
tions, which has received the sanction of an eminent 
geometer, Dr. Hermann Hankel” ([22], p. 149). He 
continues by explaining the difficulties in the con­
temporary theories of integration that his examples 
illuminate.
It is interesting to note that an editor’s remark at 
the conclusion of Smith’s paper states “this paper, 
though it was not read, was offered to the society 
and accepted in the usual manner.” [Emphasis added. 
It is possible that “not read” simply meant that the 
paper was not presented at a meeting of the London 
Mathematical Society. However, in weighing the sig­
nificance of this note, one must consider that in Vols. 
3-10 of the Proceedings of the London Mathematical 
Society (1871-1879), and perhaps even further, no 
other paper was similarly noted.] In fact, this paper 
went largely unnoticed among mathematicians on the 
European continent and unfortunately Smith’s cru­
cial discoveries lay unknown. It took the rediscovery, 
almost a decade later, of similar ideas by Cantor to 
illuminate the difficulties of contemporary theories 
of integration and to begin the evolution of measure- 
theoretic integration.
Georg Cantor (1845-1918) came to the study of 
point-set topology after completing a thesis on num­
ber theory in Berlin in 1867. He began working with 
Eduard Heine (1821-1881) at the University of Halle 
on the question of the uniqueness of trigonometric 
series. This question can be posed as follows:
If for all x except those in some set P we have
1
2 a 0 +
oo E 
n=1
(an cos(nx) + bn sin(nx)) = 0,
must all the coefficients an and bn be zero?
Heine answered the question in the affirmative 
“when the convergence was uniform in general with 
respect to the set P, which is thus taken to be finite” 
([16], p. 23), meaning, by definition, that the conver­
gence was uniform on any subinterval that did not 
contain any points of the finite set P .
Cantor proceeded much further with this problem. 
In papers [1] and [2] of 1870-1871, he removed the 
assumption that the convergence was “uniform in 
general” and began to consider the case when P was 
an infinite set. In doing so he began to look at what we 
now consider the fundamental point-set topology of 
the real line. In a paper [3] of 1872, Cantor introduced 
the notion of a limit point of a set that he defined as 
we do today, calling the limit points of a set P the 
derived set, which he denoted by P'. Then P" was 
the derived set of P', and so on. Cantor showed that 
if the set P was such that P (n) = 0 for some integer 
n and the trigonometric series
1
2 a 0 +
oE
n=1
(an cos(nx) + bn sin(nx)) = 0,
except possibly on P, then all of the coefficients had to 
be zero. Cantor’s work on this problem was “decisive” 
([18], p. 49), and doubly important as his derived sets 
would play an important role in much of his upcoming 
work.
In the years 1879-1884 Cantor wrote a series of 
papers entitled UJber unendliche, lineare Punktman- 
nichfaltigkeiten [5-10], that contained the first sys­
tematic treatment of the point-set topology of the real 
line. [In addition, these papers contained many other 
topics that had far-reaching implications (see [13], 
[14]), including Cantor’s investigation of higher-order 
derived sets that marked the “beginnings of Cantor’s 
theory of transfinite numbers” ([16], p. 72).] It is the 
introduction of three terms in this series that concerns 
us most here. In the first installment of this series Can­
tor defines what it meant for a set to be everywhere 
dense (literally, “Uberall dicht”), a term whose usage 
is still current. He gives a few examples, including the 
set of numbers of the form 22n+1/2m, where n andm 

FLERON: A note on the history of the Cantor Set and Cantor function
139
are integers, and continues by noting the relationship 
between everywhere dense sets and their derived sets. 
Namely, P C (a, ft) is everywhere dense in (a, ft) if 
[and only if] P' = (a, ft) ([5],pp. 2-3). In the fifth in­
stallment of this series Cantor discusses the partition 
of a set into two components that he terms reducible 
and perfect ([9], p. 575). His definition of a perfect 
set is also still current: a setP is perfect provided that 
P = P'.
After introducing the term perfect in the fifth in­
stallment, Cantor states that perfect sets need not be 
everywhere dense ([9], p. 575). In the footnote to this 
statement Cantor introduces the set that has become 
known as the Cantor (ternary) set: the set of real 
numbers of the form
x = ci +... + c +..., 
3 + 
+3v + 
,
where cv is 0 or 2 for each integer v. Cantor notes that 
this is an infinite perfect set with the property that it 
is not everywhere dense in any interval, regardless of 
how small the interval is taken to be. We are given no 
indication of how Cantor came upon this set.
During the time Cantor was working on the ‘Punkt- 
mannichfaltigkeiten’ papers, others were working on 
extensions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 
to discontinuous functions. Cantor addressed this is­
sue in a letter [11] dated November 1883, in which 
he defines the Cantor set, just as it was defined in the 
paper [9] of 1883 (which had actually been written in 
October 1882). However, in the letter he goes on to de­
fine the Cantor function, the first known appearance 
of this function. It is first defined on the complement 
of the Cantor set to be the function whose values are
1 fci + 
+ c»-  +S

for any number between
a = T + ■" 
'3 and
b = 1 + ... + 3— + 3^,
where each cv is 0 or 2. Cantor then concludes this 
section of the letter by noting that this function can be 
extended naturally to a continuous increasing func­
tion on [0, 1]. That serves as a counter-example to 
Harnack’s extension of the Fundamental Theorem of 
Calculus to discontinuous functions, which was in 
vogue at the time (see, for example, [16], p. 60). We 
are given no indication of how Cantor came upon this 
function.
There are two other topics that interested Cantor 
that we would like to mention, because they are in­
dicative of Cantor’s facility with arithmetic construc­
tions and it is possibly within this setting that Cantor 
came upon the Cantor set and Cantor function. First, 
Cantor spent some time in the mid-1870s considering 
the possible existence of a bijective correspondence 
between a line and a plane, a question most of his 
contemporaries had dismissed as absurd. In 1877, in 
a letter to Richard Dedekind (1831-1916), Cantor 
explained that he had found such a correspondence. 
This ‘correspondence’ can be expressed as follows.
Let (x1, x2 ) be a point in the unit square, and 
let 0.x1,1 x1,2 x1,3 ... and 0.x2,1 x2,2 x2,3 ... 
be decimal expressions of x1 and x2 , respec­
tively. Map the point (x1,x2) to the point 
on the real line whose decimal expansion is 
0.x1,1x2,1x1,2x2,2   (See for example [13], 
p. 187.)
Dedekind pointed out that there was a problem with 
this approach. The decimal expansions of rationals 
are not unique, so to avoid duplication we must not 
allow expansions of some type, say expansions that 
contain infinite strings of zeros. However, by disal­
lowing expansions with infinite strings of zeros, the ir­
rational number 0.11010201010201010102 ... could 
never be obtained under Cantor’s correspondence.
This reasoning does however give us an injection 
of [0, 1] x [0, 1] into [0, 1]. It is trivial to find an in­
jection of [0, 1] into [0, 1] x [0, 1]. These two facts, 
together with the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem (if 
there are injections of the set A into the set B and 
B into A, respectively, then there is a bijective corre­
spondence between A andB (see, e.g., [21]), allow us 
to conclude that there is a bijective correspondence 
between [0, 1] and [0, 1] x [0, 1]. However, set the­
ory was in its infancy during the period in question 
and it would be 20 years before E. Schroeder and Fe­
lix Bernstein independently proved the theorem that 
bears their names ([14], pp. 172-173) and occasion­
ally Cantor’s name as well (e.g. [17], [23]). So this 
was not an option for Cantor.
Instead, Cantor needed to explicitly exhibit a bi­
jection. To do this he modified his previous approach 
to use continued fractions [4]. Denote the continued 
fraction
1
1
1
a 3 + . . .
where

140
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
Since a continued fraction is infinite if and only if 
it represents an irrational number, in which case the 
representation is unique (see e.g. [15]), Cantor could 
set up the correspondence
([a1,1 , a1,2 ,...], [a2,1 , a2,2 ,...],... [an,1 , an,2 ,...])
^ [a 1,1, a2,1, .. . an, 1, a 1,2 ,a2,2,. .. an,2,. ..]
between n-tuples of irrationals in (0,1)n = (0,1) x 
(0,1) x • • • x (0,1) and irrationals in (0,1). This 
avoids the difficulties of the previous approach and 
gives a bijective correspondence between ([0, 1]\Q)n 
and [0, 1]\Q. Cantor then took great lengths to prove 
there was a bijective correspondence between [0, 1] 
and [0, 1]\Q. Repeated application of this fact com­
bined with the previous correspondence gives a bi­
jective correspondence between [0, 1]n and [0, 1].
Secondly, it is known that Cantor studied binary 
expansions. In fact:
Cantor recognized that the power of the linear 
continuum, denoted by o, could be represented 
as well by [the power of] the set of all represen­
tations:
X-f W+ 
+f (v) +
x 2 
' ••• 
■ 
+ ■" ,
where f (v)=0or 1 [for each integer v] (see 
[13], p.209).
There is, so it seems, no substantive evidence about 
how Cantor came upon the Cantor set and Cantor 
function. However, given Cantor’s route into point-set 
topology, his arithmetic introduction of the Cantor set 
and Cantor function, and his facility with arithmetic 
methods, as we have just illustrated, it is feasible that 
it is within the arithmetic framework of binary and 
ternary expansions that Cantor came upon the Cantor 
set and Cantor function.

Evolution of the Topological Concept 
of “Connected”
R. L. WILDER
American Mathematical Monthly 85 (1978), 720-726
Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to trace the evolution of 
one of the most basic concepts in topology, viz., that 
of connected (not to be confused with simply con­
nected). Like many other mathematical concepts of a 
fundamental nature (e.g., continuous function), it had 
only an intuitive meaning (such as connected figure 
in geometry) until the increasingly subtle demands 
of analysis and topology forced formulation of a sat­
isfactory definition. The latter was not achieved, as 
one might expect, until a number of definitions had 
been proposed—each sufficient within its mathemati­
cal context, but quite insufficient as the configurations 
studied became more general and abstract.
We try to clear up, incidentally, the existing confu­
sion regarding the actual authorship of the definition 
ultimately adopted. Not surprisingly, we uncover a 
“multiple.” For several years, European topologists 
considered F. Hausdorff to be the prime originator of 
the definition, apparently because their knowledge of 
set theory and fundamental topological notions was 
usually derived from his classic Grundzuge derMen- 
genlehre [5], published in 1914. However, by the time 
of publication of his 1944 Mengenlehre [6], which 
was a third edition of the Grundzuge, Hausdorff had 
discovered Lennes’s earlier version of the same def­
inition (see below), and called attention thereto in a 
note at the end of his book.
Thereafter the definition was commonly called the 
“Lennes-Hausdorff definition” of connected. Many 
modern textbooks on topology seem to have adopted 
the term “Hausdorff-Lennes Separation Condition”, 
or “Hausdorff-Lennes condition” for the type of sepa­
ration involved in the definition. Possibly this received 
stimulus from the use of the term by S. Lefschetz in 
his American Mathematical Society Colloquium vol­
ume entitled Algebraic Topology [10]. On page 15, 
Lefschetz speaks of the “so-called Hausdorff-Lennes 
separation condition.”
In his classic work on topology [9], Kuratowski 
states in a footnote (p. 127) that the definition of con­
nected “originates from” C. Jordan’s Cours d’Analyse 
of 1893, and also cites Lennes’s work. A justification 
for Kuratowski’s statement is offered below.
W Sierpinski, in the 1952 English edition of his 
work on general topology [19], attributes the defi­
nition to Hausdorff. However, in his Foundations of 
Point Set Theory ([13], p. 378), R. L. Moore attributes 
the definition to Lennes. In my own book, Topology 
of Manifolds [20], I cited Schoenflies, Lennes, and 
Hausdorff, the Schoenflies definition being the same, 
although independently arrived at, as the definition of 
Jordan which was cited by Kuratowski.
Without further citing of literature, it seems fair to 
conclude that little attention was paid to United States 
journals during the early part of the present century, 
since Lennes’ definition was published in both the 
Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society and 
the American Journal of Mathematics in 1906 and 
1911, respectively. Perhaps, too, the same should be 
said about the Hungarian journals, for nowhere in 
the topological literature cited above is the name of 
F. Riesz mentioned in connection with the definition 
of connected, although the same definition as that 
given by Lennes was published by him in 1906 (in 
Hungarian) and in 1907 (in German).
The evolution
Unquestionably the roots of the concept of con­
nected lie in the notion of the continuous, but more

specifically the linear continuum, which goes back as 
far as the Greeks, who struggled to clarify the notion 
in the light of Zeno’s paradoxes. The history of this, so 
far as itis known, is already adequately covered in the 
literature. Similar remarks hold for the contributions 
of the medieval mathematicians and philosophers, es­
pecially of the scholastic tradition, whose influence 
on both Bolzano and Cantor have been widely com­
mented upon.
Bolzano’s contribution
Although the theory of proportion given by Eudoxus 
(and reproduced in Euclid’s Elements) has been cred­
ited by some as the equivalent of Dedekind’s defi­
nition of the real continuum, it seems not to have 
figured in the analysis of the early part of the nine­
teenth century. During the latter period, there arose a 
growing stress for a proper basis for establishing the 
location theorem of algebra, using only arithmetic (as 
opposed to geometric) means. This theorem asserts 
that if a real polynomial f (x) is negative for x = a 
and positive for x = b, then it is zero at some value 
between a and b. This led Bernard Bolzano to offer 
a proof of the theorem in 1817 [1]. A casual reading 
of Bolzano’s works convinces one that he had a re­
markable intuitive knowledge of the structure of the 
real continuum as it is understood today. Along with 
this, he evidently conceived of the notion of a general 
continuum. Consider the following definition (given 
in his Paradoxien [2], p. 129):
. . . a continuum is present when, and only when, 
we have an aggregate of simple entities (in­
stances or points or substances) so arranged that 
each individual member of the aggregate has, at 
each individual and sufficiently small distance 
from itself, at least one other member of the 
aggregate for a neighbor. When this does not 
obtain, when so much as a single point of the 
aggregate is not so thickly surrounded by neigh­
bors as to have at least one at each individual 
and sufficiently small distance from it, then we 
call such a point isolated, and say for this reason 
that our aggregate does not form a continuum.
Curiously, the motivation for this definition, ac­
cording to Bolzano’s own testimony, lay in the para­
doxes that plagued the philosophical and mathemat­
ical conceptions of time, space, and “substance.” 
Bolzano reasoned that, by establishing a suitable char­
acterization of the abstract structural pattern com­
mon to all these concepts, the paradoxes could be 
explained. The analogy with the Greek dilemma and 
the efforts to resolve it is striking.
Now the Paradoxien was written toward the end of 
Bolzano’s life and published posthumously in 1851, 
while the proof of the location theorem, cited above, 
was published some 34 years previously. But the mo­
tivation for the latter was strictly mathematical in 
that it was to free analysis of its notorious reliance 
on the geometric aspects of continuity. There can be 
little doubt, however, that Bolzano’s development of 
his intuition of the continuous in the latter work was 
contributory to his philosophical conception of time, 
space, and substance as continua. And it seems to 
represent the first attempt at a mathematical formu­
lation of the topological notion of connected. Since, 
as was to be the case for over a half-century there­
after, the definition of connected was tied to that of 
continuum, it would perhaps be more proper to term 
it the mathematical progenitor of the notion of con­
tinuum. However, the time for consideration of point 
sets having no compactness properties had not ar­
rived in mathematics, and there is little doubt that the 
intuitive notion which Bolzano (and after him Can­
tor) was trying to make precise was equivalent, in its 
context, to that which led later to the “unrestricted” 
notion of topological connectedness.
Cantor’s contribution
Cantor, who was familiar with Bolzano’s work, saw 
clearly that the property used by Bolzano was insuf­
ficient to make precise the intuitive notion of con­
tinuum. In a paper often called the Grundlagen ([3], 
Section 10), he pointed out, for example, that sets con­
sisting of several separated continua satisfy Bolzano’s 
condition. Moreover, he recognized intuitively that 
the compactness properties now associated in topol­
ogy with the notion of continuum had not been re­
quired in Bolzano’s definition, and pointed out that the 
complement of an isolated point set in n-dimensional 
coordinate space En, n > 2, is a continuum accord­
ing to Bolzano. (It is curious that Cantor did not point 
out that the set of rational points in E 1 , the real line, 
is also a continuum by Bolzano’s definition.) He also 
rejected enlisting the concepts of time or space as aids 
in exploring the mathematical notion of continuum, 
deeming the relationship quite the reverse.
According to Cantor, a continuum in En must pos­
sess two basic properties, namely, the property of be­
ing perfect and that of being connected. In modern 
terms, a point set in En is perfect if it is closed and 
dense-in-itself—i.e., each of its points is a limit point 

144
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
of it. (Cantor’s precise definition utilized the notion 
of derivative of a point set, a point set P being per­
fect if it coincides with its first derivative P'.) In 
this connection he pointed out the insufficiency of 
requiring a point set to be only perfect in order that it 
be a continuum by giving his classical example of a 
totally disconnected perfect set—the Cantor ternary 
set, now often called simply the Cantor set. (See [3], 
p. 590.) He then defined connected as follows:
A point set T is connected if for every two of 
its points t and t', and arbitrary given positive 
number £, there always exists a finite number of 
points t1 ,t2,...,tn ofT such that the distances 
tt 1,1112,..., ini' are all smaller than £.
Then any perfect and connected subset of En is a 
continuum, according to Cantor, who pointed out in 
a footnote ([3] p. 590) that no special dimension was 
implied in the definition; a line, surface, solid, etc., 
are all continua. Incidentally, for bounded subsets of 
En , this is equivalent to the modern definition of a 
continuum.
The most important aspect of Cantor’s definition 
of continuum is his separation of the two concepts 
perfect and connected, thus identifying for the first 
time the latter as an independent property. At the 
time, however, topology was virtually non-existent as 
a field of study, and it could not be expected that 
sets having the sole property of connectedness would 
receive any attention. And as already implied above, 
Cantor’s definition of connected was quite adequate 
for the study of continua.
C. Jordan’s contribution
The next noteworthy step in the evolution of the 
concept of connected is found in C. Jordan’s Cours 
d’Analyse [7]. Apparently Jordan was not familiar 
with Cantor’s definition of ten years earlier, since he 
makes no mention of it. Following a discussion of 
closed sets (but using the word perfect (parfait) in­
stead of closed), establishing the notion of distance 
(ecart) between them, and defining sets as separated 
when the distance between them is greater than zero, 
he gives a definition of what he calls un seul tenant— 
in modern terms component — of a bounded closed 
set, to wit: a bounded and closed set of points has 
a single component if it cannot be decomposed into 
several closed separated sets.
One sees easily that the distinctive character 
of such a set is the following: For arbitrary 
£, one can intercalate, between any two of its 
points p,p', a chain of intermediate points of the 
set such that the distance between consecutive 
points is less than £.
It is this statement that Jordan italicized, not the pre­
ceding definition.
This coincides, of course, with Cantor’s definition 
of connected and is proved a necessary and sufficient 
condition for a bounded and closed set to consist of 
a single component ([18], p. 26). It is then simple 
to prove ([7], p. 27) that a subset of the real line 
which forms a single component and contains two 
numbers, a and b, must contain every number between 
a and b. This corollary of Bolzano’s theorem seems 
to have been the chief motive for Jordan’s definition 
of component.
Schoenflies’ contribution
In 1904, A. Schoenflies published the first of his fun­
damental researches into the topological aspects of 
point set theory [18]. He was aware of Cantor’s defini­
tion of connected, which he cited ([18], pp. 208-209), 
but went onto comment that even though the concept 
of distance formed a primitive geometric notion for 
the axiomatic basis of his work, it was preferable to 
give a purely set-theoretic definition of connected, 
whereupon he gives the following:
A perfect set is called connected ifit is not de­
composable into [at least two non-empty] sub­
sets, each of which is perfect.
This is, for bounded sets, the equivalent of Jordan’s 
definition of un seul tenant which, according to the ac­
companying remarks, became known to Schoenflies 
only after he had announced his own version. Stating 
that Jordan introduced the definition only to derive 
Cantor’s formulation of the concept (with which he 
operated thereafter), Schoenflies observes that “con­
nectedness is an important and fundamental property 
for Analysis Situs as a whole.” This statement rep­
resents an important step forward in the evolution 
of the connectedness concept. Whereas Cantor only 
separated the notion from the other properties of a 
continuum, Schoenflies now elevated it to the posi­
tion of a fundamental property of topology, and went 
on to prove its invariance and to study the property 
especially in the context of plane topology.
Despite Schoenflies’ recognition of the fundamen­
tal character of connectedness, his view was still lim­
ited, in that he expressed the opinion that, while the 
definition was formulated for perfect sets, it could 
equally well be stated for (merely) closed sets; but

WILDER: Evolution of the Topological Concept of “Connected”
145
“since for closed sets which are not perfect, connect­
edness cannot come into question, it is sufficient to 
limit the definition to perfect sets” ([8], p. 173)! Thus, 
while making an important step forward, Schoenflies 
made another step backward.
The work of W. H. and G. C. Young
Although chronologically the work of W. H. and 
G. C. Young virtually coincides with that of Lennes 
and Riesz, to be discussed below, it is interpolated 
here as a kind of capstone to the work already de­
scribed, as well as being of intrinsic interest for its 
adumbration of later work in the theory of connect­
edness.
The classic book [22] ofW. H. and G. C. Young, in­
tended as the “first attempt at a systematic exposition” 
of Cantor’s ideas on the theory of sets, introduces a 
definition of connected in terms of regions. In mod­
ern terms, a region was a connected open set with 
or without an arbitrary set of its boundary points; 
the Youngs defined it as generated by successively 
overlapping triangles:
A set of points such that describing a region in 
any manner round each point and each limiting 
point of the set as internal point, these regions 
always generate a single region, is said to be 
a connected set provided it contains more than 
one point. Hence if a set is connected the set got 
by closing it is connected, and vice versa ([22], 
p. 34).
From this definition, the Youngs prove: A connected 
set cannot be divided into closed components (= sub­
sets) without common points. Conversely a set which 
cannot be divided into closed components without 
common points is, if closed, a connected set. We re­
call that this proposition was used by Jordan and oth­
ers to define connected in the case where the set in 
question is closed.
The Lennes and Riesz definitions
It is remarkable that throughout the period discussed 
above—from the time of Bolzano to 1905, over half 
a century—the notion of connected was confined to 
closed sets; and this in spite of the fact that Cantor 
divorced the notion from closure in his definition of 
continuum. On the other hand, it is not surprising, 
since attention was devoted exclusively either to the 
real continuum or to the subsets of Euclidean space 
(usually the plane), and the only non-closed sets of 
importance were of a special character, such as the 
set of rationals or open segments on the real line, and 
the circular or triangular regions of the plane.
Of course, Jordan, and following him Schoenflies, 
had proposed definitions of connected which virtually 
begged for generalization to non-closed sets. And 
this step was finally taken in 1905-06 by both N. J. 
Lennes and F. Riesz. Lennes gave his definition at 
a meeting of the American Mathematical Society in 
December 1905, and it was published in the abstract 
of his talk the following year in the Bulletin of that 
Society [11]. Riesz’s definition was presented to the 
Hungarian Academy of Sciences on January 22, 1906, 
and published later the same year [15]. Here was 
clearly a “multiple”—a case of independent invention 
by more than one investigator.
Lennes’s definition reads [11]:
A set of points is connected if in every pair 
of complementary subsets at least one subset 
contains a limit point of points in the other set.
This is stated in such a fashion that it is meaningful 
in any space in which limit point is defined (although 
undoubtedly the author’s thinking, like that of most 
topologists of the time, was of Euclidean spaces).
Riesz’s definition has several remarkable features. 
In the first place, it is given in the context of an essay 
[16] devoted to the relations between the “physical 
continuum” and the “mathematical continuum”. In 
defining the physical continuum, Riesz uses the re­
lation unterscheidbar between space points, not the 
topological notion of limit point. The definition pro­
ceeds as follows:
Das physikalische Kontinuum heisst zusam- 
menhangend, wenn es nicht in zwei Teilmen- 
gen zerlegt werden kann, dass jedes Element der 
einen Teilmenge unterscheidbar sei von jedem 
Elemente der anderen Teilmenge. The physical 
continuum is called connected if it cannot be 
split into two subsets so that each element in 
one subset is distinguishable from each element 
in the other subset.
Notice the striking resemblance to the Jordan- 
Schoenflies definition, although Riesz makes no ref­
erence to the latter. However, there is conclusive 
evidence in previous papers of Riesz’s that he was 
familiar with Jordan’s Cours d’Analyse and hence, 
probably, with Jordan’s definition.
In the second place, the definition of connected for 
topological spaces (he does not use the latter term) 
is given initially for what he calls a “mathematical 
continuum”, which, in modern terms, is an abstract 
topological space defined by four axioms adumbrative 

146
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
of such later systems as were given by Hausdorff and 
Kuratowski. The definition reads as follows:
Das mathematische Kontinuum heisse zusam- 
menhangende wenn es nicht in zwei offene Teil- 
mengen zerlegt werden kann, die Komplemen- 
tarmengen fur einander sein. The mathematical 
continuum is called connected if it cannot be 
split into two open subsets, which are comple­
ments of each other.
For subsets of such a space he then distinguishes two 
degrees of connectedness: a set is called connected 
if it cannot be decomposed into two subsets whose 
closures are disjoint; itis called absolutely connected 
if for every decomposition ofit into two [non-empty] 
subsets, there exists at least one element which 
belongs to one subset and is a limit point of the 
other. It is the second of these, of course—i.e., 
absolutely connected—that is the modern definition 
of connected.
Actually, the “multiple” which occurred when 
these two definitions were given was joined by a third, 
viz., F. Hausdorff ’s definition. Apparently when giv­
ing his definition in his book [5] of 1914, Hausdorff 
was unaware of either Lennes’ or Riesz’ definitions. 
On the other hand, Hausdorff did proceed, in this 
book, to study some of the properties of connected 
sets as topological concepts in their own right.
However, the first paper devoted to the study of 
connected sets was not published until 1921; we refer 
here to the classic paper “Sur les ensembles con- 
nexes” of B. Knaster and C. Kuratowski [8]. This 
paper was significant in the evolution of the concept 
of connectedness because:
1. it established the fact that connected spaces lack­
ing compactness properties have a variety of inter­
esting topological properties;
2. it gave impetus to a host of studies, both in topol­
ogy and in the logical foundations of set theory;
3. it gave the ultimate emphasis to Schoenflies’ state­
ment, quoted above, concerning the fundamental 
character of connectedness.
Concluding remarks
From an evolutionary point of view, the development 
of the concept of connectedness proves to be a reveal­
ing case study. Its roots, as in the case of many other 
mathematical concepts, are embedded in the contem­
plation of physical time, space, and “substance”. At 
the hands of Cantor it finally split off from philosoph­
ical and physical considerations to become a part of 
mathematical theory. But it was not easily divorced 
from the concept of continuum within which it was 
first formulated—a consequence of its mathematical 
environment, which consisted chiefly of the study of 
curves and surfaces, examples of what Cantor called 
continua in the mathematical sense. This was a case 
of the operation of “environmental stress”, in that 
the mathematical environment worked to confine the 
notion within a restricted area.
It failed to find its proper place in mathematical 
theory until Schoenflies pointed out its invariance 
under topological transformations, as well as its in­
dependent status as a topological property. But al­
though Schoenflies, who discovered essentially the 
same definition that Jordan had given over a decade 
earlier, made an important step forward, topology 
had still not grown much beyond the study of con­
figurations whose compactness properties made the 
Jordan-Schoenflies definition quite adequate. Indeed, 
so much so, that when the Youngs wrote their clas­
sic The Theory of Sets of Points during the decade 
between Jordan and Schoenflies, they seem to have 
deliberately phrased their definition of region (allow­
ing a region to include boundary points freely) so 
that the Cantor definition would be preserved (see the 
remark above concerning the Young definition).
Lennes’s generalization of these definitions was ap­
parently a result of his consideration of non-closed 
sets. In the paper [12] giving in detail the results an­
nounced in the 1906 abstract [11], he first defined con­
nectedness for open sets (in Euclidean space) by using 
broken lines, an open set U being connected if every 
pair of points a, b in U are joined by a broken line ly­
ing wholly in U ([12], p. 293). He observed that by the 
Cantor definition of connected, the union of the inte­
rior and exterior of a planar circle forms a connected 
set; moreover, that “if from the ordinary continuum 
in space of any dimensions any set whatever which 
is nowhere dense is removed, the residue would form 
a connected set” ([12], p. 303). He thereupon gave 
the form of the definition now generally accepted, 
remarking that it “applies in cases where the former 
does not.” (In other words, it renders sets connected 
which our intuition tells us should be connected and 
rules out those that, like the complement of the circle 
in the plane, should not be termed connected.)
One of the remarkable features of Riesz’s defini­
tion, aswe have already noticed, is that it was given in 
the context of an abstract topological space. This as­
pect of Riesz’s work seems also to have been generally 
unnoticed for some time, despite the fact that Frechet

147
called attention ([4], Note B) to Riesz’s abstract space 
axioms as they were later presented at the Interna­
tional Congress in Rome, 1908 [17]. In any event, his 
definition, although agreeing with Lennes’s, achieves 
thereby its most general character, freed from all met­
ric considerations.
Although the lack of diffusion from one coun­
try to another, which characterized earlier periods in 
mathematics, had begun to subside, the period during 
which the topological concept of connectedness was 
developed still shows considerable lack of diffusion. 
Lennes’s and Riesz’s work, both published in rep­
utable journals during the first decade of the century, 
was generally unknown until the journal Fundamenta 
Mathematicae commenced publication in 1920. The 
occurrence of a three-member multiple during the 
first quarter of the present century is quite noteworthy.
One further comment: One of the noteworthy fea­
tures of the Knaster and Kuratowski article [8] was 
its presentation of paradoxical examples of connected 
sets having no compactness properties. I have pointed 
out elsewhere [21] the contribution that paradox 
can make to the development of mathematical con­
cepts. The examples given by Knaster and Kuratowski 
proved a great stimulation to the study of connected­
ness. There ensued a sizable literature devoted to the 
concept, and in recent years this has engendered in­
teresting questions in the foundations of set theory.

A Brief, Subjective Histor y of Homology 
and Homotopy Theory in this Century
PETER HILTON
Mathematics Magazine 61 (1988), 282-291
I have recently been recalling that about twenty-five 
years ago, when I first came to settle in this coun­
try, I was invited to participate in the celebration of 
the opening of the Mathematics Building, Van Vleck 
Hall, at the University of Wisconsin. On that occasion 
I learned a new American word, namely “banquet”, 
which has a totally different meaning in the United 
States from the meaning that it has in Britain. But 
more importantly, I must recall the immense respect 
I felt for some of the after-dinner speakers who were 
able to make the recounting of an event last much 
longer than the event itself. So I’m very conscious of 
the fact that in attempting to recount to you the his­
tory of algebraic topology in this century, I must not 
make the recounting of this history last longer than 
the history. In fact, I must telescope it very dramati­
cally, one might almost say, abruptly. So I apologize 
in advance that much of the treatment will be neces­
sarily very superficial. I would like to start off with 
the first epoch which is up to 1926. And here the in­
spiration for homology theory comes from the work 
of Poincare.
Poincare, during a period earlier than the one I’m 
thinking of, had already invented or discovered, ac­
cording to your philosophy, the fundamental group. 
But he published a series of papers in which he was 
studying what we would call algebraic varieties, the 
configuration of points in higher-dimensional Eu­
clidean space given by polynomial equalities and in­
equalities; and he was looking again at what we might 
call vector fields and generalizations of vector fields 
on such varieties. He was led through this study to 
look at what we would now call the homology of 
these varieties. In particular, he saw the significance 
for the solution of such vector field problems of what 
were then called the Betti numbers, which determine 
essentially the number of holes the configuration had. 
As a simple example, let us take the torus (Fig. 1), 
which is of course an algebraic variety and has two 
very conspicuous one-dimensional holes. These are 
cycles which do not bound anything in the torus. For­
mally, the torus is itself a two-dimensional hole and 
any given point constitutes a zero-dimensional hole. 
Problems about the solutions of differential equations 
on the torus are different from problems relating, for 
example, to the sphere, because the sphere has a dif­
ferent one-dimensional Betti number from that of the 
torus.
Poincare also realized that there was a further sub­
tlety, that is to say, there was a phenomenon which 
today is described as the phenomenon of the torsion 
coefficients. Essentially, what one means by torsion 
coefficients can be demonstrated by the real projec­
tive plane, which I can represent by a circular disk, 
with diametrically opposite points identified on the 
boundary of the disk (Fig. 2). It is not realizable in 
three-dimensional space, let alone two, so I make no 
apology for having to represent it this way on the 
blackboard. Now ifwe look at the path from P back 
to P , that is a cycle. That cycle does not in itself 
bound anything. But if you repeat the cycle, then

cycles or holes, z1 and z2 .

dimensional cycle z1 = PQP, such that z1 does not 
bound the disk, but 2z1 does.
twice the cycle bounds the disk. This exemplifies the 
phenomenon of the existence of cycles which do not 
themselves bound, but multiples of them bound.
I want to stress at this point that we are dealing with 
numbers. These Betti numbers are numbers and in 
each dimension there are Betti numbers. The torsion 
coefficients are also numbers.
Other names that one should associate with this 
period of the great pioneers are J. W. Alexander (one 
usually associates the name of Alexander with knots 
but he did many other things that I will refer to), and 
Veblen (he wrote one of the great books, Analysis 
Situs, which was the early name for topology—the 
essential difference between the words analysis situs 
and topology is a choice between the Latin and Greek 
cultures; they essentially mean the same thing). The 
word topology, Veblen felt, had been pre-empted, be­
cause the word topology exists outside mathematics. 
Also, one should mention here the name of Brouwer, 
and I am most happy to do so because I understand 
Karel de Bouvere spoke here on Brouwer. In par­
ticular, with Brouwer one associates the idea of the 
degree of a map, which I shall be referring to later. I 
should also say that van Kampen and Lefschetz did 
pioneering work. These will come back into the story, 
even though I list them in this very early period. To go 
into any detail on the contribution of any one of them 
would certainly occupy the entire lecture. So what I 
really want to do is proceed to what I regard as one 
of the golden years, 1927.
In regard to Lefschetz, however, I would like to 
make a remark of a personal nature, because it seems 
to me that, of all of the mathematicians, it is to 
Lefschetz one should give the credit for introduc­
ing systematically the notion of a polyhedron in a 
generalized sense. When I began a very enjoyable 
collaboration with Jean Pedersen, I discovered rather 
early on that we were separated by the misfortune of
Figure 3. The cube and the octahedron, equivalent to 
the topologist but not to the geometer
a common language, in which we used precisely the 
same terms but with different meaning. In particular, 
this word ‘polyhedron’ was almost responsible for 
the breaking up of a beautiful friendship. What does 
‘polyhedron’ mean and what does it mean to clas­
sify polyhedra? To the topologist today, this is such 
a standard term, meaning the underlying topological 
space of a much more general type of combinatorial 
structure than that which is admitted by the geome­
ter, the combinatorial geometer; and the classifica­
tion of polyhedra, according to the topologist, is by 
homeomorphism generally, possibly by combinato­
rial equivalence, but again in a sense different from 
that used by the geometer (see Fig. 3). I think we can 
say that our trouble stems from Lefschetz. It’s a very 
key notion, this idea of homeomorphisms between 
polyhedra; it raised many questions, more questions 
than it answered, as any good mathematical notion 
will.
So now, with this very brief introduction to that 
early period, I want to discuss those years 1926-27. 
The reason I pick out these years is because these 
are the years when Alexandroff and Hopf were in 
Gottingen. Both of them were there as guests, a splen­
did example of the efficacy of having mathemati­
cal guests! Alexandroff was from the Soviet Union 
and Hopf, at that time, was from Berlin. They were 
both of them very much impressed with the work 
of Lefschetz; and, in particular, they were discussing 
the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. They recognized 
that this was in some way, which they began to put 
their fingers on, a generalization of the Euler-Poincare 
characteristic. In connection with these Betti numbers 
which Poincare had established, the so-called Euler 
characteristic was a topological invariant. The Lef- 
schetz fixed-point theorem, expressed in admittedly 
somewhat clumsy notation, they saw to be closely 
related. Indeed, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, 
applied to the identity map from a space into itself, 
seemed to give the Euler-Poincare characteristic.
But, very significantly, there was also Emmy 
Noether in Gottingen; she would not have been there

150
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
but for Hilbert’s insistence. He felt that Gottingen 
was a place for mathematicians and not for sexism— 
which, in those days, was a very special point of view. 
Emmy Noether recognized that what Alexandroff 
and Hopf were talking about, and what Lefschetz 
had talked about, should not be thought of as num­
bers but should be thought of as Abelian groups. 
So really one should credit Emmy Noether, not with 
the discovery of these topological invariants, but 
with understanding their mathematical place. Thus 
Emmy Noether recognized the homology groups, and 
that the Betti numbers and torsion coefficients were 
merely numerical invariants of isomorphism classes 
of finitely-generated Abelian groups. If you take a 
finitely-generated Abelian group A, then it can be 
written as the direct sum of a free Abelian group F 
and a family of cyclic groups A/hi, where h 1| h 21 • • •. 
Moreover, the rank of the free Abelian part F and 
these numbers hi are invariants of the group A.IfA 
is the homology group in dimension d, say, then its 
rank is the dth Betti number, and the hi are the torsion 
coefficients. Now you see that this is an enormous im­
provement over just a consideration of the numbers, 
because this immediately gives you the opportunity 
of adopting a far more dynamic approach to the whole 
question of homology; for then it is not simply that 
with a polyhedron you associate Betti numbers and 
torsion coefficients, but with the polyhedron you as­
sociate homology groups. But, with Emmy Noether’s 
improvement, there is very much more.
There is the natural question: how do you transform 
one polyhedron to another? How do you map one 
polyhedron into another? In the first place you have 
the idea of a simplicial map of the polyhedron and that 
induces a homomorphism of homology groups. I said, 
you remember, that the rank ofF is an invariant—but 
F itself is not. A homomorphism from one Abelian 
group to another does not send the free part into the 
free part, nor does it preserve the nice little pieces, 
the Z/hi . Things can get very much mixed up. The 
free part can go into the finite part. So you can only 
begin to understand the transformation of homology 
from this group-theoretical point of view.
This was an enormous advance both conceptually 
and dynamically, in terms of the real understanding 
of what you have. It also posed the very obvious 
question: simplicial maps induce homomorphisms 
of homology groups. What can one say in general 
about merely continuous functions of the underlying 
polyhedra? Now I have not undertaken to talk about 
the complete history of the Hauptvermutung, which 
would again occupy a lot of time. So I must leave 
on one side such questions about the different com­
binatorial structures on the polyhedron, but what this 
throws into prominence immediately is the question: 
can you approximate to any continuous map of the un­
derlying topological spaces by a nice combinatorial 
transformation of the polyhedra? The answer is yes; 
that is the simplicial approximation theorem, which 
dates from about this time.
And so the picture begins to emerge of what ho­
mology is all about, and we agree first to look at 
this restricted class of spaces, the polyhedra and the 
simplicial maps between them, as a combinatorial 
structure. Here you can say you can do some for­
getting, so that the polyhedra can be just thought of 
as topological spaces—we can forget their combi­
natorial structure—and the simplicial maps are then 
simply continuous functions.
From the polyhedra and the simplicial maps you 
can construct, first, what are called chain complexes 
and chain maps. That means you look at the chains 
on the space. They are the linear combinations of 
the simplexes, the generalized triangles into which 
you have subdivided your space to make it a polyhe­
dron. And finally you take the homology groups of 
the chain complex and get the homology groups of 
the space. You define first chain complexes and the 
chain maps, then homology groups and homomor­
phisms. For the polyhedron, you pick any polyhedral 
structure on the space, and you prove that the result­
ing homology groups only depend on the underlying 
space. That is the essential statement of the topologi­
cal invariance of the homology groups. You go back 
from an arbitrary continuous function to a simplicial 
map by an approximation. You have choices of ap­
proximations but, whatever approximation you use, 
the homomorphism induced on homology groups is 
the same. This diagram here (Fig. 4), where I have 
jumped many, many decades, shows essentially what 
these people were moving towards as they were elu­
cidating the ideas of homology. Central to these ideas 
is the fact that the homology groups are really homo­
topy invariants—that is homotopic continuous maps 
induce the same homology homomorphism. A nice 
example is furnished by maps f of the n-sphere Sn 
to itself. Now Hn Sn is cyclic infinite, so the induced 
homology homomorphism in dimension n is really 
just an integer, called the degree off. The Brouwer- 
Hopf Theorem asserts that the degree is the unique 
invariant of the homotopy class of f .
I should also mention here the first person in this 
account who, as far as I know, is still alive: Vietoris, an 
Austrian mathematician, living in Innsbruck. Vietoris

with continuous maps, simplicial maps and chain maps.
is one of the two who should be credited with see­
ing that you could define homology groups with­
out the space having to be the underlying space of 
a polyhedron. With just the notion of a topological 
space, intrinsically defined, Vietoris defined homol­
ogy groups (it even appears that Vietoris, indepen­
dently of Emmy Noether, recognized the importance 
of the group concept). So there are homology groups 
of arbitrary spaces. He did it by means of cover­
ings of the space by open sets.
The other person we credit here is a Czech math­
ematician, Cech. They did it independently, as far as 
I can see, but they did it differently. They both did 
it by considering coverings of a space by open sets; 
the open sets in Cech’s definition behaved like the 
vertices of a simplicial complex. According to Cech, 
then, a finite number of open sets span a simplex if 
and only if they have a non-empty intersection. Thus 
he saw these open sets as the vertices of a complex, 
so, from the present-day point of view, what Cech did 
was to study the nerve of a covering, which is an ab­
stract simplicial complex which has a chain complex 
and homology groups attached.
Vietoris did something different. He took the open 
sets and said that a collection of points of the space 
constitute (in some sense) a simplex, if they all lie 
in one of the sets of the covering. These two points 
of view we now see as being, in a very real sense, 
dual to each other. The first person who made the 
duality of the Vietoris-Cech definitions precise was 
Hugh Dowker, a very fine Canadian mathematician, 
who, I regret to say, died recently.
Also I should mention, in this connection, Mayer, 
who is known, and always will be known—as Heine 
is known as part of Heine-Borel—as part of Mayer- 
Vietoris. There is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in ho­
mology. Hopf also credits Mayer, independently of 
Emmy Noether, with recognizing that groups were 
involved in the definition of homology, in a paper he 
published in 1929. ButifI go on a bit from that time, I 
should mention that in 1932 there appeared a book by 
Alexandroff, which was very influential and in 1935 
there was the great book of Alexandroff and Hopf. 
There was a Volume I but there was never a Volume 
II. (The reason Volume II never appeared was the 
advent of cohomology.) This was an extremely influ­
ential book and was a sort of bible for the study of 
algebraic topology. It was a very beautifully written 
work. The original was, of course, in German, but 
even if you do not understand German, it was easier 
to understand than most mathematical books written 
in English. The purpose of the treatment was to make 
the subject crystal clear. The pictures were beautiful.
Many things happened in 1935, which was very 
much a golden year. There was an international meet­
ing in Moscow, in the summer. Hopf sent to Moscow 
his young student, Stiefel, who had begun a study 
of the existence of solutions of differential equations 
from the homological point of view and had come up 
with a certain idea which we now call characteristic 
classes. In Moscow at the meeting Stiefel read his 
paper, and in the audience was Hassler Whitney. 
(There is another living mathematician!) Hassler 
Whitney came up to Stiefel after and said: “This is

The coboundary of BC is ABC + DBC.
remarkable, it is almost exactly what I have been 
doing”—in his study of (what we would now call) 
fiber spaces. Alexandroff, too, said that these fiber 
spaces are what they (the Russian school) had been 
doing. There they were called twisted products. So 
there was an extraordinary confluence of ideas re­
vealed at this Moscow meeting. We now talk of the 
Stiefel-Whitney classes. These are thought ofas char­
acteristic cohomology classes on a real differentiable 
manifold. They are completely understood now, but 
were then in their infancy.
Also, this was the year when cohomology emerged 
and it emerged with the understanding that in coho­
mology you have a ring structure. Now cohomology 
was very slow to emerge for the simple reason that 
Emmy Noether’s point of view was simply not under­
stood by topologists. Despite the obvious advantages 
of the algebraic viewpoint, topologists continued to 
think exclusively geometrically. And I put the empha­
sis on the word ‘exclusively’. That is what was wrong. 
And it is a remarkable fact about Hopf, the greatest 
of them all, that he could never feel comfortable with 
the idea of cohomology.
The reason goes back to the idea of chains to which 
I have already (inadequately) referred. A chain is a 
linear combination of simplexes. For example, if you 
have some sort of triangulation, then you think of a 
chain as involving, in the one-dimensional case, the 
edges with certain multiplicities. Hopf always thought 
of it as some sort of path that was traced out on the 
polyhedron. And the current attitude towards homol­
ogy and cohomology was this: if I, for example, look 
at a particular edge, this oriented edge, the two ver­
tices of the edge, one with coefficient +1 and one with 
coefficient -1, that is, with this edge I will associate 
its boundary. The other thing I can do is associate, 
with this edge, all the triangles of which it is a side, 
that is, its coboundary (Fig. 5). So in one case you 
lower the dimension and in the other case you raise 
it. The lowering of the dimension is homology, the 
raising of the dimension is cohomology.
That was the current point of view and, indeed, 
under Alexandroff ’s influence, for many, many years 
the Russians continued to talk about lower and upper 
homology. But the point of view is flawed because, 
in the sense of linear algebra, cohomology is dual 
to homology—that is to say, if we think of 1-chains 
as linear combinations of edges, we should think of 
1-cochains as functions of those edges. So we should 
distinguish between an edge and the function that 
takes on the value 1 on the edge. It is exactly the dif­
ference between a basis element of a vector space and 
the associated basis element of its dual. So cochains 
have to be thought of as functions on the simplexes. 
And although Hopf recognized that point of view he 
could not adopt it, because to him homology was all 
about geometry. The idea that you were looking at 
functions which take values in an arbitrary Abelian 
group and which are defined on the edges or triangles 
of a polyhedron was a point of view that was totally 
uncongenial to him.
Cohomology was a very long time emerging be­
cause it was incorrectly regarded. There was also the 
feeling that it should be possible to introduce a mul­
tiplicative structure into cohomology which is not 
present in homology. Many attempts were made to 
do this. Alexander, whom I have mentioned, was one 
of the pioneers here and the attempt was finally suc­
cessful in 1935. Of course, it enriches enormously 
the structure and adds to the discrimination that you 
get through homology theory, because you could very 
well have two topological spaces such that the Abelian 
group structure in cohomology is the same but in fact 
they have different multiplicative structures. If you 
take the torus, and on the other hand the following 
configuration (Fig. 6), then the homology of the latter 
has the same additive structure as that of the torus, 
but it is distinguished from the torus by the multi­
plicative structure of its cohomology. The two one­
dimensional cocycles on the torus multiply together 
to give the torus, but in the other configuration they 
multiply together to give zero. So this was the great 
refinement of cohomology theory.
It’s interesting in this connection that Hopf, for 
whom I have enormous respect, didn’t feel comfort­
able with this. Hopf had earlier seen, in the case of 
manifolds, that if you have a mapping f of mani­
folds, an m-dimensional manifold M mapped to an n- 
dimensional manifold N , then you have intersection

rings of the manifolds. An intersection ring means 
that you take two cycles and look at their intersection 
in general position on the manifold.
Hopf proceeded from there to define something 
that he called the Umkehrshomomorphismus, the 
backward homomorphism. The backward homomor­
phism was something that was induced by f which 
would go from the homology ofN in dimension n - p 
to the homology of M in dimension m - p for arbi­
trary p. He defined it very carefully and he gave it 
this name, the Umkehrshomomorphismus. What is 
it? Well, under the duality present in a manifold, the 
(n - p)th homology of N is essentially the same as 
the pth cohomology of N, as N is n-dimensional, and 
the (m - p)th homology of M is the same as the pth 
cohomology of M . So this homomorphism is simply 
the induced map in cohomology theory. Hopf defined 
this backward homomorphism and drew attention to 
the strange way that it changed the dimension in ho­
mology and went in the wrong direction. Of course 
it goes in the wrong direction because cohomology 
is contravariant, being based on dual vector spaces. 
You have a linear map from one vector space to an­
other and the dual map maps the dual vectors back in 
the other direction. Hopf, with his wonderful, won­
derful insight, got the right idea but stopped short of 
clarifying it in that way.
But having made the only criticism one could pos­
sibly make of Hopf ’s mathematics, let us move on 
to one of his tremendous contributions, also in 1935. 
In December of 1935 there was a meeting in Geneva 
and at this meeting E3lie Cartan drew attention to the 
remarkable property of the classical Lie groups. He 
pointed out that all the classical Lie groups had the 
property that their Betti numbers—he was still talking 
about Betti numbers—were just like those of products 
of odd-dimensional spheres. So if you took any one 
of the classical Lie groups,—that is, the series of 
orthogonal groups, the unitary groups, and the sym- 
plectic groups—each one of those groups behaved, in 
a way, like a Cartesian product of odd-dimensional 
spheres. And this had simply been a matter of, you 
might say, empirical observation; that is to say, Car­
tan knew them all and their Betti numbers, and he 
just looked at them all and it was true for them all. 
But there was no explanation. He challenged people 
to produce an explanation. These facts, by the way, 
go back to Brouwer, Pontrjagin, and Ehresmann. And 
then he asked the next natural question, you take the 
five exceptional Lie groups, is it also true for them?
Why do the classical Lie groups always look like 
products of odd-dimensional spheres? Hopf thought 
about this and he came up with the answer. In his 
answer he pointed out that you needed very little of 
the structure of the classical Lie groups. Essentially 
all you needed is to say that you have a topologi­
cal space, together with a continuous multiplication 
on that space which has a two-sided identity. So we 
assume, of course, a compact space so that our ho­
mology will be finitely generated, and a multiplication 
with a two-sided identity. That is all!
This has always struck me as being a piece of in­
credible genius, because at the time that Hopf was 
working, there were known exactly two examples of 
this phenomenon which were not Lie groups. One was 
the seven-dimensional sphere—and it is surely some­
what unexciting to be told that the seven-dimensional 
sphere behaves like a product of odd-dimensional 
spheres! And the other is the real projective seven­
dimensional space. It is almost equally unexciting 
because the real projective seven-dimensional space 
is an orientable manifold of which the seven-sphere 

154
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
is a two-sheeted covering. Obviously from the point 
of view of Betti numbers it behaves exactly like the 
seven-dimensional sphere. So there was no interest­
ing example—but Hopf gave this as the explanation, 
and this was the birth of the whole theory of Hopf al­
gebras which is now a tremendous industry. Today we 
have infinitely many examples of the so-called Hopf 
manifolds which are not even topological groups. So 
as you see, much happened in 1935.
It is now time to talk of the homotopy groups. There 
is a beautiful trade-off between the homology groups 
and the homotopy groups. The homology groups are 
terribly difficult to define, but once you have defined 
them they are very easy to calculate. The homotopy 
groups are terribly easy to define but essentially im­
possible to calculate. The homotopy groups general­
ize the fundamental group. For the fundamental group 
you look at just the homotopy classes of maps of a 
circle into your space and, for the higher homotopy 
groups, you map spheres.
Actually, Hurewicz should not be credited with 
the actual invention of the homotopy groups. Really 
the credit for the invention should go to Cech. At 
a meeting in Vienna in 1931, Cech gave a paper in 
which he described certain groups from the homotopy 
point of view. He had no applications of these groups. 
Moreover, he had only one theorem, that they were 
commutative. And he was persuaded by people, and 
we know that Alexandroff played a role here, that they 
could not be interesting, because it was thought that 
any information that could be obtained from Abelian 
groups must come from the homology.
Hurewicz redefined the homotopy groups and im­
mediately gave important applications in a series of 
four notes which were intended as preliminary pub­
lications. In that series of four papers he showed the 
significance of what we now call obstruction the­
ory. Essentially, as Steenrod was later to remark and 
codify, the basic problem you are facing in topology 
can so often be represented in the following way. You 
have a configuration X and you have a configuration 
Y , you have a subspace ofX called L, and a mapping 
g from L into Y . The question is—can that continu­
ous function g be extended to X? It’s amazing how 
many questions inside and outside topology can be 
reduced to that. What Hurewicz showed was that this 
type of question could be answered in terms of cer­
tain obstructions which are cohomology classes of X 
modulo L, with coefficients in the homotopy groups 
of Y . (In fact you usually cannot answer the ques­
tion because you cannot calculate the obstructions!) 
The whole of obstruction theory was made absolutely 
systematic by Eilenberg. Hurewicz showed the sig­
nificance of the homotopy groups and there is one 
great theorem that provides the link between homo­
topy and homology called the Hurewicz Isomorphism. 
Hurewicz pointed out that there was always a homo­
morphism going from the nth homotopy group to the 
nth homology group. If the space is such that the first 
n — 1 homotopy groups vanish (n > 2), then this is an 
isomorphism. Thus the first place where the Hurewicz 
homomorphism is interesting it is an isomorphism. 
This generalizes the classical result already known 
essentially to Poincare, the case n = 1 where the first 
homology group is the fundamental group Abelian- 
ized. For the higher dimensions the homotopy groups 
are already Abelian, so you don’t have to Abelianize 
them.
And that is the best that can be said of Alexan- 
droff ’s point of view; that is, the first place where the 
homotopy groups come into play they are just homol­
ogy groups. After that, their divergence is very sig­
nificant, so you can say that homology and homotopy 
are proceeding together essentially as complementary 
concepts.
And if I could just make one remark about what 
I regard as my own small contribution to this evolu­
tion, it would be my work with Eckmann. We showed 
that, though the homology and homotopy groups are 
essentially different, the method of construction of 
cohomology groups and of homotopy groups can be 
regarded as dual manifestations of exactly the same 
process. That is to say, the actual structure of co­
homology theory can be mirrored by the structure of 
homotopy theory. Of course the results we get provide 
a vital link between the two theories.
One name I have not mentioned is Henry White­
head. So let me say that what Henry Whitehead did 
involved a very beautiful idea. To go back to the be­
ginning of homology, a topological space admitting 
homology was originally endowed with a combina­
torial structure. Vietoris and Cech freed it of this 
combinatorial structure by defining homology on an 
arbitrary topological space. Homotopy theory was 
originally defined for an arbitrary topological space, 
and what Henry Whitehead did was to impose a com­
binatorial structure on the space and show how this 
combinatorial structure on the space could, in fact, 
lead you to insights into its homotopy groups. These 
results first appeared in papers he wrote before the 
war and he then rewrote them afterwards. Whitehead 
said about his pre-war work that he shared with Karl 
Marx the property of being frequently quoted and 
never read. And after the war he tried to deal with

this by recasting a lot of his work in algebraic lan­
guage. I was his first student after the Second World 
War; so I came under his influence in that period 
and that probably accounts a great deal for my early 
taste.
Question-and-answer session
Question: When I studied algebraic topology I never 
realized that Emmy Noether had anything to do with 
it. Is this commonly known?
Answer: No. Hopf was very clear about this, about 
her tremendous contribution, this wonderful insight 
that she had. He said that he would never have real­
ized that, in doing homology, they were talking about 
Abelian groups until she pointed this out. He saw the 
significance of the algebraic viewpoint in homology, 
but his difficulty was with cohomology. Hopf said 
that there was this wonderful atmosphere in Gottingen 
when they all got together and talked. Emmy Noether 
listened and then she came back and said, “Well, what 
you’re really talking about is Abelian groups.” They 
had these Betti numbers and they told her that the 
Betti numbers were for manifolds, but she said that 
they were talking about Abelian groups. And then she 
said that once you’re talking about groups you must 
be talking about homomorphisms, but in the earlier 
proofs of invariance, you don’t find any use of that 
fact.
There is a good book by Andrew Wallace on ho­
mology theory. He gives, in a tiny little lemma tucked 
away, the fact that a map between spaces induces a ho­
momorphism of their homology groups and that the 
composite of two maps induces the composite of the 
homomorphisms. Well, that’s what topological invari­
ance is all about, and the lemma makes it plain that 
you’re transferring one theory into another, you’re 
going from topology to algebra. That explains what 
you are doing in homology, and that is the point that 
Emmy Noether really clarified. Let me just tell one 
little story since this is Polya country. I was present in 
Zurich on the occasion of Polya’s eightieth birthday 
and was invited to his birthday party. He and Hopf 
were discussing Emmy Noether and one of the two of 
them insisted that Emmy Noether was very ugly and 
the other hotly denied it.
Question: Why did some topologists fail to adopt the 
algebraic methods? Did they just feel that it would 
not yield worthwhile results?
Answer: It was the feeling that all of topology came 
from geometry and to some extent from analysis. 
Poincare was, in the broad sense, an analyst. I think 
the idea of algebra as a tool in the hands of a geometer 
was a peculiar and strange idea. Now it seems much 
more natural but, in those days, it was very strange. 
In 1935, such a great mathematician as E3lie Cartan 
was still just thinking in terms of Betti numbers. So 
this point of view was so foreign to them, this was 
what really held them up.
Consider, for example, this business with cohomol­
ogy and the contortions that many mathematicians 
went into with the ‘upper boundary’, with things al­
ways going wrong! They could see that though you 
got a map of chains from, say, a simplicial map, it 
didn’t commute with the upper boundary, and Hopf 
had the idea that you had to think of a map going back 
the other way in some way. How? They just did not 
think in algebraic terms of cochains as functions on 
chains. As a further example, although it was clear to 
Alexandroff and to Hopf that it was natural, in con­
nection with the Lefsehetz fixed-point theorem, to 
think in terms of homology with rational coefficients, 
they thought that homology with rational coefficients 
was just a means of getting rid of the torsion. They 
didn’t think of it as a way of getting a vector space 
structure which is the way we would think of it now. 
Take rational coefficients, you get a nice rational vec­
tor space. So we can just talk about the dimension 
of the vector space. They just did not have these 
ideas.
And I should say, too, that Henry Whitehead, in a 
paper before the war, introduced the key idea of an 
exact sequence in homotopy, but the way be wrote it 
out was extraordinarily obscure to us. Instead of just 
writing that, in the sequence, the kernel of a homo­
morphism is the same as the image of the preceding 
homomorphism, he has complicated statements be­
cause he distinguishes between the homotopy of maps 
into X and the homotopy of maps into a subspace A. 
In each case he wrote down what exactness meant, 
and so had two inclusions, one going one way, one 
going the other.
All of these algebraic ideas were a very long 
time in the making because the people doing ho­
mology and homotopy theory were not algebraists 
and the algebraists didn’t take any interest. The only 
pure algebraist who took any interest was Emmy 
Noether.
Question: Now it’s very common that you use the 
techniques of one branch of mathematics to solve 
problems in another. Was algebraic topology the first 
place where this happened?

156
Answer: Yes, in a systematic way, unless you would 
say that it was already being done in analytic number 
theory. There you are using methods of classical anal­
ysis in order to get results in number theory. There is 
a sense there though that you are not doing anything 
but the analysis. In topology, it’s a sort of wedding of 
the two methods simultaneously—it’s not the aban­
donment of one for the other but it’s the establishing 
of links between the two, and in a sense it’s gone so 
much further now because from topology one is led 
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
into the construction of new algebraic structures— 
and you can get algebraic results from the topology 
as well. By the use of covering spaces you can get 
theorems from combinatorial group theory that are 
terribly hard without the topological methods. So we 
have a two-way application. Cohomology theory has 
now spread over the whole of mathematics through 
differential equations, differential operators and so 
forth. And in algebraic geometry, of course, homol­
ogy theory has become a basic tool.

The Origins of Modern Axiomatics 
Pasch to Peano
H. C. KENNEDY
American Mathematical Monthly 79 (1972), 133-136
The modern attitude toward the undefined terms of 
an axiomatic mathematical system is that popular­
ized by Hilbert’s remark: “One must be able to say 
at all times—instead of points, straight lines, and 
planes—tables, chairs, and beer mugs” ([20], 
p. 57). This view was not widely accepted before the 
twentieth century, and even in 1959 the well-known 
James and James Mathematics Dictionary gave “A 
self-evident and generally accepted principle” as first 
meaning of the term “axiom”, although this may only 
be meant as a reflection of the view universally ac­
cepted before the developments in geometry in the 
nineteenth century. The change in attitude appears 
to be due to internal pressures within mathematics 
(what R. L. Wilder ([22], p. 170) has called “hered­
itary stress”). These include the flowering of projec­
tive geometry and, especially, the discovery of the 
non-Euclidean geometries, i.e., of the possibility of a 
geometry based on axioms, one of which is the nega­
tion of one of Euclid’s axioms. The transition from 
viewing an axiom as “a self-evident and generally 
accepted principle” to the modern view took place in 
the second half of the nineteenth century and can be 
found in the very brief period from 1882 to 1889, from 
Pasch’s Vorlesungen uber neuere Geometrie [13] to 
Peano’s I Principii di Geometria, Logicamente Es- 
posti [15].
Already in 1882, Pasch showed a shift in inter­
est from the theorems to the axioms from which the 
theorems are derived, when he insisted that every­
thing necessary to deduce the theorems must be found 
among the axioms ([13], p. 5). Pasch was concerned 
that his axiom set be complete, i.e., that it furnish a ba­
sis for rigorous proofs of the theorems. (“The father of 
rigor in geometry is Pasch”, wrote Hans Freudenthal 
([5], p. 619).) There is also a strong hint of the modern 
attitude, as expressed in Hilbert’s remark about “ta­
bles, chairs, beer mugs” in his statement:
In fact, provided the geometry is to be truly de­
ductive, the process of inference must be entirely 
independent of the meaning of the geometrical 
terms, just as it must be independent of the fig­
ures ([13], p. 98).
Hilbert’s remark was made to a few friends in the 
waiting room ofa railway station in 1891 but was not 
published until 1935 ([10], p. 403). The exposition of 
the axioms in his famous Grundlagen der Geometrie 
[7] begins:
Let us consider three distinct systems of things.
The things composing the first system, we will 
call points, and designate them by the letters 
A,B,C,...” ([8], p. 3).
The viewpoint is quite clear—but he was not the 
first to publish this view. Pasch has already been men­
tioned, and Hans Freudenthal, in a study of geomet­
rical trends at the turn of the century, says: “Hilbert 
had in this view too at least one forerunner, namely 
G. Fano, . . . ” ([4], p. 14). He refers to Fano’s state­
ment:
As basis for our study we assume an arbitrary 
collection of entities of an arbitrary nature; en­
tities which, for brevity, we shall call points, 
and this quite independently of their nature ([3], 
p. 108).
Somewhat surprisingly Freudenthal overlooks 
Peano’s monograph of 1889, even though itis cited in 
Fano’s article, perhaps because Fano says that Peano’s 
work was based on that of Pasch. Peano’s work was 
indeed based on his reading of Pasch, but there are 
157

158
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
important innovations, and one of them is the explicit 
statement of the modern attitude toward the undefined 
terms of an axiomatic mathematical system. The first 
line of his exposition is: “The sign 1 is read point,” 
and in his commentary he says: “We thus have a 
category of entities, called points. These entities are 
not defined. Also, given three points, we consider a 
relation among them, indicated by c e ab, and this 
relation is likewise undefined. The reader may under­
stand by the sign 1 any category whatever of entities, 
and by c e ab any relation whatever among three en­
tities of that category,...” ([15]; [18], p. 77). We find 
in this statement explicit acceptance of the axiomatic 
view. (It should be noted that Peano’s view was purely 
methodical. As we have indicated elsewhere ([12], 
p. 264), he was not a member of what came to be 
called the ‘formalist’ school.)
E. W. Beth has noted ([2], p. 82):
Since the publication of D. Hilbert’s Grundlagen 
der Geometrie (1899), it has become customary 
to require every set of axioms to be (1) complete, 
(2) independent, and (3) consistent.
Again, it was Hilbert who popularized this custom, 
but that these properties of an axiom set are desirable 
was already accepted by Peano and others. The prop­
erty of consistency is indeed a sine qua non, but as the 
consistency of Euclid’s axioms was never doubted, it 
was only with the advent of non-Euclidean geometry 
that attention was focused on this property, and it was 
not until 1868 that a consistency proof was found by 
E. Beltrami [1]. The property of independence can 
be reduced to that of consistency; we often say that 
Beltrami proved the independence of Euclid’s par­
allel postulate, but this reflects a later view, that of 
Peano who developed this technique into a general 
method.
Peano’s acceptance of the goal of an independent 
set of axioms is indicated in his I Principii di Geome- 
tria:
This ordering of the propositions clearly shows 
the value of the axioms, and we are morally 
certain of their independence ([15]; [18], p. 57).
In a similar remark about his axioms for the natu­
ral numbers, published earlier that year, Peano later 
wrote:
I had moral proof of the independence of the 
primitive propositions from which I started, in 
their substantial coincidence with the definitions 
of Dedekind ([17]; [19], p. 243).
It was only in 1891, however, after he had separated 
the ‘famous five’ from the postulates dealing with the 
symbol =, that he showed their absolute independence 
([16]; [19], p. 87).
Hermann Weyl wrote of Hilbert ([20], p. 264):
It is one thing to build up geometry on sure 
foundations, another to inquire into the logical 
structure of the edifice thus erected. If I am not 
mistaken, Hilbert is the first who moves freely 
on this higher ‘metageometric’ level: system­
atically he studies the mutual independence of 
his axioms and settles the question of inde­
pendence from certain limited groups of ax­
ioms for some of the most fundamental geo­
metric theorems. His method is the construc­
tion of models: the model is shown to dis­
agree with one and to satisfy all other axioms; 
hence the one cannot be a consequence of the 
others.
This method was, as we have seen, already used sys­
tematically by Peano, although one would not learn 
this from reading Hilbert. In the Grundlagen der 
Geometrie there is no mention of Peano. The only 
Italian mentioned is G. Veronese, and the reference 
is to a German translation of his work. Nor does 
Hilbert mention Peano even in his presentation of 
postulates for the real numbers [9]. Indeed (without 
naming him) he labels Peano’s development of the 
real numbers the “genetic method”, while reserving 
the label “axiomatic method” for his own presenta­
tion!
A word more may be said about the originality of 
Peano’s work. In contrast with Hilbert, Peano always 
tried to place his work in the historical evolution of 
mathematics, to see it as a continuation and devel­
opment of the work of others. Furthermore, he was 
scrupulously honest (although sometimes mistaken) 
in assigning priority of discovery. Thus in I prin- 
cipii di Geometria he praises Pasch’s book and indi­
cates precisely to what extent his treatment coincides 
with that of Pasch, and where it differs. On the other 
hand, Peano’s discovery of the postulates for the nat­
ural numbers was entirely independent of the work of 
Dedekind, contrary to what is often supposed. Jean 
van Heijenoort says ([6], p. 83):

KENNEDY: The Origins of Modern Axiomatics: Pasch to Peano
159
Peano acknowledges that his axioms come from 
Dedekind,
referring the reader to the statement of Peano:
The preceding primitive propositions are due to 
Dedekind ([16]; [19], p. 86).
Hao Wang says ([21], p. 145):
It is rather well known, through Peano’s own 
acknowledgement ...that Peano borrowed his 
axioms from Dedekind . . . ,
and he gives a reference to Jourdain ([11], p. 273), 
which in turn refers to the same passage of Peano 
just quoted. Since Peano had already written in Arith- 
metices Principia:
Also quite useful to me was a recent work: 
R. Dedekind, Was sind und was sollen die 
Zahlen, Braunschweig, 1888 ([14]; [18], p. 22), 
the conclusion of these authors would seem justified. 
In fact, Peano was only acknowledging Dedekind’s 
priority of publication.
The exact story was given in 1898 when Peano 
wrote:
The composition of my work of 1889 was still 
independent of the publication of Dedekind 
just mentioned; before it was printed I had 
moral proof of the independence of the prim­
itive propositions from which I started, in their 
substantial coincidence with the definitions of 
Dedekind. Later I succeeded in proving their in­
dependence ([17]; [19], p. 243).
We see from this that the reference to Dedekind’s 
work was added to the preface of Arithmetices Prin- 
cipia just before the pamphlet went to press, and we 
have an explanation of how Dedekind’s work was 
“useful”.
Ironically, the very modesty of Peano and his desire 
to see his work as in the mainstream of the evolution 
of mathematics have contributed to the lack of recog­
nition of his originality. As for clarity, while giving 
much credit to Peano, Constance Reid ([20], p. 60) 
says of Hilbert that in the Grundlagen der Geometrie 
he
attempted to present the modern point of view 
with even greater clarity than either Pasch or 
Peano.
What could be clearer than: “The reader may under­
stand by the sign 1 any category whatever of enti­
ties”? Let the reader compare for himself the clarity 
of Dedekind’s presentation of the foundations of arith­
metic with that of Peano. There can be no doubt that 
the famous five axioms for the natural numbers are 
rightly called Peano’s Postulates.

Charles Sanders Peirce
American mathematics, like American science gen­
erally in the nineteenth century, remained underde­
veloped, depended heavily upon European models, 
and made few independent and recognized contri­
butions of its own. Though presidents like Jefferson 
might take a pedagogical interest in mathematics and 
its teaching, and while Garfield, in fact, discovered 
an interesting variation on the many proofs of the 
Pythagorean theorem, American mathematics gener­
ally remained without support, either institutional or 
financial, until late in the century (see [28] and [37]).
Despite the lack of incentives to pursue a math­
ematical career in America, there were nevertheless 
some who made important contributions to mathe­
matics in the United States. One of the most interest­
ing of these, Charles Sanders Peirce, made fundamen­
tal discoveries, largely independent of his European 
counterparts, in set theory and mathematical logic. 
This paper explores the nature and significance of 
Peirce’s contributions.
Though his study of continuity led him to produce 
results paralleling in some ways the contributions of 
Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in Germany, 
Peirce’s work was dramatically different in its ori­
gins, inspiration, and ultimate mathematical charac­
ter. In order to understand the fate of Peirce and his 
mathematical studies of continuity and infinity, it is 
necessary first to say something about the status of 
American science in general, and of American math­
ematics in particular, in the nineteenth century. Fol­
lowing a brief sketch of the major developments of set 
theory, largely in the hands of Cantor and Dedekind, 
we shall then turn to consider Peirce, his mathematics, 
and finally the reasons why his genius and multitudi­
nous insights did not exert more influence upon his 
contemporaries than they did.
Mathematics in America in the 
nineteenth century
Alexis de Tocqueville, in assessing the status of sci­
ence in America in the early nineteenth century, re­
marked that Americans found it easier to borrow their 
science from Europe than to pursue it earnestly them­
selves. “I am convinced”, he wrote [41], “that if the 
Americans had been alone in the world ...theywould 
not have been slow to discover that progress can­
not long be made in the application of the sciences 
without cultivating the theory of them.” Mathemat­
ics, as the handmaiden in particular to astronomy and 
physics, was as essential, but just as neglected, as 
the other basic sciences in America until well past 
mid-century. In large measure de Tocqueville found 
the unusual combination of democracy and economic 
opportunities responsible for America’s indifference 
to basic science. By this he meant that the egalitar­
ian ideal encouraged the idea that anyone, with hard 
work, could transform the nation’s national resources 
into personal fortune. Thus if anything was sought in 
science, it was only the immediate means by which 
nature might be exploited. Europe had its monarchies 
and aristocracies to encourage pure science, but de 
Tocqueville was certain that it could flourish equally 
as well in the United States, if only constituted author­
ities here would give it encouragement and support.
Thus while utility was highly praised for reasons 
that were religious, political and entrepreneurial, lit­
tle interest was paid to abstract study which seemed 
to offer no evidence of immediate usefulness [38].

Mathematics was no exception. In fact, most of Amer­
ica’s mathematicians until the end of the century were 
individuals of means, and the case of Josiah Willard 
Gibbs is illustrative. Gibbs taught at Yale Univer­
sity for many years without pay. In a country where 
“success” was more often than not associated with 
financial prosperity, it is no wonder that scientists 
in America played virtually no role in government 
or public affairs, unlike their European counterparts. 
Even as late as 1902, the mathematician C. J. Keyser 
of Columbia University, could write [21] that:
I know personally of six young men, five of 
whom have relinquished the pursuit of science 
and the (sixth) of whom told me only yester­
day that he seriously contemplated doing so, all 
of them, for the reason that, as they allege, the 
university career furnishes either not at all, or 
too tardily, a financial competence and conse­
quent relief from practical condemnation to celi­
bacy.
As for the American government, it consistently 
refused to support any national organization for sci­
ence until after the Civil War, and it was only through 
the bequest of an Englishman that the Smithsonian 
Institution was finally established (for the Smithso­
nian, see [10] and [20]; for American science and the 
Civil War, see [39], [16] and [40]). Often, in fact, 
Americans were better known abroad than at home. 
Nothing reflects so poorly upon the state of Ameri­
can science even towards the end of the century than 
a story J. J. Thomson [40] once told:
When a great university was founded in 1887, 
the newly elected President came over to Europe 
to find professors. He came to Cambridge and 
asked me if I could tell him of anyone who would 
make a good professor of molecular physics. I 
said, “You need not come to Europe for that; 
the best man you could get is an American, 
Willard Gibbs.” “Oh”, he said, “you mean Wol­
cott Gibbs”, mentioning a prominent chemist. 
“No, I don’t”, I said, “I mean Willard Gibbs”, 
and told him something of Gibbs’ work. He sat 
thinking for a minute or two and then said, “I’d 
like you to give me another name. Willard Gibbs 
can’t be a man of much personal magnetism or 
I should have heard of him”.
Mathematicians in America could blame their lack 
of status on apathy and indifference. One mathe­
matician assessing mathematical productivity in the 
United States echoed de Tocqueville’s words when he 
noted that “educational and scientific activity shall 
come to be generally understood, and especially in 
proportion aswe learn to value the things of mind, not 
merely for their utility, but for their spiritual worth” 
([21], p. 346; see also [27] for American indiffer­
ence towards mathematics). The assessment was C. 
J. Keyser’s, and in part he blamed the low level of 
productivity by American mathematicians before the 
turn of the century upon their isolation, saying that “in 
general there was no suspicion that, on the other side 
of the Atlantic, mathematics was a vast and growing 
science” ([21], p. 347).
Throughout the nineteenth century, mathematics, 
like the sciences generally, became more complex, 
more technical, more specialized. More formal train­
ing was required, more professionalization, and at 
first Americans clearly followed the pattern de Toc­
queville had described in 1835. If Americans wanted 
to learn the newest techniques, to study the latest the­
ories, they went to Europe, many to Germany, and to 
such centers for mathematics as Berlin and Gottingen. 
In rare instances, Europeans came to America. Per­
haps no one was more influential for the future of 
American mathematics in this capacity than was J. J. 
Sylvester, whose arrival in America accompanied an­
other significant development ([27], p. 463, and [28], 
pp. 30-32). As a counterpart to the growing special­
ization of European science, advanced training at the 
graduate level was regarded increasingly as imper­
ative. Consequently, following the examples of the 
great European schools like the Ecole Polytechnique 
and the University of Berlin, America’s first graduate 
school was founded in Baltimore.
In 1876 Johns Hopkins University opened, and one 
of its first great attractions was the English math­
ematician J. J. Sylvester. Both he and Johns Hop­
kins exerted a tremendous influence upon American 
mathematics, in part through the American Journal of 
Mathematics, edited by Sylvester and begun at Johns 
Hopkins in 1878. It was perhaps symptomatic that not 
only was the journal originally edited by an English­
man, but that to a great extent the journal’s articles 
were written by foreigners. Since Johns Hopkins was 
primarily a graduate school, it served to encourage 
graduate studies at other U.S. universities. Two sim­
ilar institutions were founded by the end of the cen­
tury: Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, 
in 1889; and the University of Chicago in 1892, which 
was extremely influential in the Midwest.
But the single strongest factor in organizing and 
promoting mathematical research in America was the 
American Mathematical Society (see [21], pp. 350­
352 and [28], pp. 30-32). Its precursor, The New York

163
Mathematical Club, had been founded in 1888, and 
at first was little more than a small group meeting 
at Columbia University. But soon the Mathematical 
Club became the New York Mathematical Society, 
publishing a monthly bulletin. In 1894 this organi­
zation was again transformed, becoming the Ameri­
can Mathematical Society with membership then at 
nearly four hundred. Bi-monthly meetings were held, 
summer meetings were scheduled around the coun­
try, and soon sections scattered from coast to coast 
were established. The first was the Chicago section, 
chaired by E. H. Moore, on April 24, 1897; five years 
later, in 1902, the San Francisco Section was chaired 
by Irving Stringham; and shortly thereafter, in 1906, 
the Southwestern Section was established in St. Louis 
by E. R. Hedrick.
In terms of its societies, journals, and publishing 
mathematicians, mathematics in America had come 
a long way from its status early in the century, when 
arithmetic was still taught in the first year at Harvard 
College, and only became an entrance requirement in 
1816. By the end of the nineteenth century, in many 
respects if not completely, the words of the French 
mathematician Laisant were in large measure true. 
As he surveyed the progress Americans had made in 
mathematics, he concluded [22] that:
Mathematics in all its forms and in all its parts is 
taught in numerous universities, treated in a mul­
titude of publications, and cultivated by scholars 
who are in no respect inferior to their fellow 
mathematicians of Europe. It is no longer an 
object of import from the old world, but it has 
become an essential article of national produc­
tion, and this production increases each day both 
in importance and in quantity.
Before turning to assess the character and signif­
icance of the contribution made by C. S. Peirce to 
American mathematics, in particular to various as­
pects of set theory, it is necessary to survey briefly 
the state of that art in Europe at the time. Above all, 
until about 1895 at least, the development of transfi- 
nite set theory was almost exclusively the work of the 
German mathematician Georg Cantor.
Georg Cantor (1845-1918)
Georg Cantor, creator of transfinite set theory, pub­
lished a theorem in 1872 which brought him to the 
attention of the mathematical world, and which also 
marked the beginning of his work in set theory. His 
theorem established the uniqueness of functional rep­
resentations by trigonometric series over domains 
from which certain infinite sets of points could be 
excepted [2]. The only restriction limited the set of 
exceptional points to first species sets P , ones for 
which the nth derived set Pn was empty for some 
finite value of n.
But in order to provide a satisfactory foundation 
for his proof, Cantor discovered that he was obliged 
to introduce a rigorous construction of the real num­
bers. He did so in terms of equivalence classes of 
infinite sequences of rational numbers subject to the 
Cauchy criterion for convergence, and was also led to 
formulate his Axiom of Continuity, which postulated 
the equivalence of the arithmetic and geometric con­
tinuums. In the same year, 1872, Richard Dedekind 
(1831-1916) published his construction of the real 
numbers in terms of his famous “cuts”, and he did 
not fail to acknowledge the similar work Cantor had 
done in his paper on trigonometric series [12].
Cantor’s unexpected results seem to have spurred 
his interest in the properties of continuous domains 
in general, and late in 1873 he discovered that the 
set of all real numbers was non-denumerable ([3]; 
see also the correspondence [9]). In 1879 he finally 
managed to publish a startling proof showing that any 
continuous space of n dimensions could be mapped 
(though not continuously) in a one-to-one fashion 
onto the real line. Cantor was so unprepared for this 
discovery that it prompted one of his most oft-quoted 
remarks: “I see it, but I don’t believe it” ([9], p. 34).
Cantor’s first systematic presentation of his transfi- 
nite numbers was published in 1883. His Grundlagen 
einer allgemeinen Mannichfaltigkeitslehre [4] was as 
much philosophy as it was mathematics, a combi­
nation that was also to be characteristic of much of 
C. S. Peirce’s research. In the Grundlagen Cantor in­
troduced his transfinite ordinal numbers. He began 
by identifying two principles of generation. The first 
produced new ordinals by the successive addition of 
units, hence
1, 2, 3,... ,n,n+1,.....
The second principle was called upon to introduce 
a new number representing the totality of all ordi­
nals generated by the first principle, when such a 
sequence continued without coming to an end. For 
example, though it was not permissible to think of 
a last of all natural integers, one could posit a least 
number coming after all the natural numbers. This 
number Cantor defined as w, and it represented the 
totality of all the positive integers in their natural or­
der. It was then possible to apply the first principle 
of generation to produce higher transfinite ordinals: 
w +1,w+2,...,w+ n,..... When this sequence 

164
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
continued without end, Cantor again called upon his 
second principle of generation to produce the least 
number following all those of the form w + n, namely 
the ordinal number 2w, and so on. Later Cantor would 
define the second number class of such transfinite or­
dinals as the class Z (K0), the totality of all order 
types a of well-ordered sets of cardinality K0. The 
power of this second number class Z (K0) Cantor de­
noted by the second transfinite cardinal number K1 
[7].
Cantor, of course, was not the only mathematician 
interested in the properties of infinite sets. In 1888, 
Richard Dedekind published a small pamphlet, Was 
sind und was sollen die Zahlen [13], in which he in­
troduced, among other things, the distinction between 
finite and infinite collections that has since become 
a classic: a system S is said to be infinite when it is 
similar to a proper part of itself; in the contrary case 
S is said to be a finite system. This definition is of 
particular interest for it seems that Peirce had been 
led to an equivalent distinction, even earlier, and for 
very different reasons.
In 1891 Cantor published his famous method of 
diagonalization, whereby it was possible to generate 
an unending sequence of sets of greater and greater 
cardinality [6]. In 1874 Cantor had shown only that 
the set of real numbers was non-denumerable. The 
result of 1891 was considerably more powerful, and 
impressively general, for he was able to show that for 
any exponent K, the power 2^ > K. If K0 be taken 
as the cardinality of the denumerable set of natural 
numbers, then 2^0 was a set of greater cardinality 
representing the set of all real numbers. Moreover, 
Cantor could show that there were sets of cardinality 
even greater than the real numbers — for example the 
set of all single-valued functions on the interval (0, 1).
Between 1895 and 1897 Cantor’s most ambitious 
and influential work appeared in the Mathematische 
Annalen: his “Beitrage zur Begrundung einer trans- 
finiten Mengenlehre” ([7] and [8]). In Part I (1895) 
he presented his general theory of the order types of 
simply-ordered sets like the rationals taken in their 
natural order (type n), and the reals (type 6); in Part 
II (1897) he defined his transfinite cardinal numbers 
in terms of well-ordered sets, and explored in detail 
basic arithmetic properties of his transfinite numbers. 
He also took the opportunity to condemn the doctrine 
of infinitesimals in the recently published work of 
the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Veronese. Cantor 
had always been an ardent opponent of infinitesimals, 
and at one point called them the “infinitary cholera 
bacillus of mathematics” (see a letter of Cantor’s cited 
in [25]). Early in his career Cantor rejected the idea 
of infinitesimals, and when Mittag-Leffier asked if 
there might not be other kinds of numbers between 
the rational and real numbers, Cantor responded with 
an emphatic “no” (see [26], p. 234, and [5]). In 1887 
Cantor published a proof of their logical impossi­
bility, based not surprisingly upon the Archimedean 
character of what he called linear numbers, and some 
years later Peano published a similar proof against in­
finitesimals in his own journal, the Rivista di Matem- 
atica [30]. To have admitted infinitesimals, it might be 
added, would have complicated greatly Cantor’s con­
tinuum hypothesis, which asserted that the cardinality 
of the set of all real numbers, 2 ^ 0, was equal to that of 
his second number class, in other words, 2^0 = K 1. 
To allow infinitesimals in addition to the rationals and 
irrationals would have made this conjecture concern­
ing the power of the continuum considerably more 
complicated.
By the end of the century, the status of Cantor’s 
work was brought dramatically into question by dis­
covery of the paradoxes of set theory. While Burali- 
Forti was the first to publish his paradox of the largest 
ordinal number, Cantor had discovered the paradoxes 
of both a largest ordinal and cardinal number even 
earlier, probably as early as 1895. Cantor sketched a 
proof for Dedekind in 1899, in which he concluded 
that it was a direct consequence of the paradoxical 
nature of the unending sequence of all cardinals that 
the continuum must be a set whose cardinality was 
one of Cantor’s transfinite alephs ([43], pp. 443-450; 
also see [19]).
But in 1897 Burali-Forti drew a very different con­
clusion from his study of the collection of all ordinal 
numbers. Such a collection, he argued, must have an 
ordinal number 5 greater than any ordinal in the col­
lection. But if the set contained all ordinal numbers, 
then it must contain 5, and Burali-Forti was forced to 
the contradictory conclusion that 5>5.Fromthishe 
did not draw comfort, as did Cantor, in alleging that 
this was the key to solving much deeper problems of 
set theory. Instead, Burali-Forti concluded that math­
ematicians could only agree to abandon any hope of 
strict comparability between transfinite numbers [1]. 
In 1902 Bertrand Russell constructed a strictly logi­
cal paradox and shocked Frege by showing that there 
were certain antinomies inherently part of logic, and 
consequently of mathematics as a form of structured 
reason (see Frege’s reaction in [18], Vol. II, 443­
450).

DAUBEN: C. S. Peirce’s Philosophy of Infinite Sets
165
In considering the paradoxes of set theory, in par­
ticular those of the greatest ordinal and cardinal num­
bers, Peirce agreed with Bertrand Russell that these 
were, properly speaking, questions of logic. The basic 
business of mathematics, for Peirce, was the forma­
tion of hypotheses ([31], pp. 41, 73, 769, 785, 875, 
916). In terms of set theory, this meant the determi­
nation of what grades of multitude between infinite 
collections were mathematically possible. And, as we 
shall see, Peirce drew from the paradox of the largest 
cardinal number a principle which he felt might help 
to resolve the question of the true nature of continuity.
Charles Sanders Peirce
(1839-1914)
C. S. Peirce, the son of Benjamin Peirce, was born in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, on September 10, 1839 
(for studies of Peirce’s life and works, see [17], [29], 
[42]). Benjamin Peirce, a professor of mathematics 
and natural philosophy at Harvard University, was 
careful to direct his son’s schooling, and saw that 
young Charles had as rigorous a scientific education 
as he and the private schools of Boston could provide. 
When Peirce graduated from Harvard with an Sc. B. 
in chemistry, in 1863, he did so summa cum laude. 
But Peirce was not to go on immediately to devote 
himself to the study of pure science. His interests ran 
more to the study of method and logic, and in hopes of 
gaining more experience in the nature and method of 
scientific investigation, he joined the U.S. Coast Sur­
vey. For more than thirty years Peirce remained with 
the Survey, and in addition to working on the nautical 
almanac, he conducted numerous pendulum experi­
ments, was a special assistant in gravity research, and 
devoted a good deal of time to the observation of solar 
eclipses.
As for teaching, Johns Hopkins University made 
it possible for Peirce to lecture in logic from 1879 to 
1884, and some of his earliest work of relevance to 
set-theoretic problems dates from this period. In fact, 
in 1881, Peirce published a paper in the American 
Journal of Mathematics, “On the Logic of Number” 
[33], in which (he was later always proud to em­
phasize) he had characterized the difference between 
finite and infinite sets well before Dedekind had done 
so in 1888. Peirce asserted that Dedekind’s Was sind 
und was sollen die Zahlen was doubtless influenced 
by his own paper, because Peirce had sent Dedekind 
a copy (see [31], pp. 883 and 1117, and [32], Vol. 
3, 564). But the most interesting feature of Peirce’s 
entire approach to mathematics was not the way in 
which it was like the research then being conducted 
in Europe, but in the ways it was unlike the approaches 
taken by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind to the 
problems of continuity and infinity.
Cantor, as we have seen, was motivated to study 
the continuum of real numbers as a result of his early 
study of the representation theorem for trigonomet­
ric series. Similarly, Dedekind’s characterization of 
the continuum and his introduction of the now fa­
mous “Dedekind cut” to define the real numbers was 
also inspired by analysis. In trying to teach the ba­
sic elements of the differential calculus, particularly 
theorems involving limits, Dedekind realized that ge­
ometric intuition, though a guide, was not rigorously 
satisfactory. And so he turned to produce a purely 
arithmetic study of continuity and the irrational num­
bers (see Dedekind’s discussion in [12], pp. 1-3).
Peirce, on the contrary, took an entirely different 
approach. His inspiration was not analysis, and his 
interests were not in probing the foundations of math­
ematics in order to provide a certain, unshakable be­
ginning from which function theory could proceed 
without difficulty. Instead, Peirce was led to study the 
mathematics of infinity, infinitesimals, and continu­
ity as a result of his interests in logic and philoso­
phy. In this difference lies the key to understanding 
why Peirce differed so markedly from Cantor and 
Dedekind in his approach to the problems of continu­
ity and the infinite.
Peirce’s first publication describing the difference 
between finite and infinite classes appeared in 1881, 
while he was lecturing in logic at Johns Hopkins. 
His paper ([32], Vol. 3, 256) began with a definition 
(though insufficient) of continuity:
A continuous system is one in which every quan­
tity greater than another is also greater than some 
intermediate quantity greater than that other.
But since the rationals would be continuous under 
this definition, Peirce’s description is inadequate, al­
though it does represent a necessary feature of any 
continuum. Peirce, however, was only beginning his 
study of continuity at the time; the most interest­
ing feature of his paper appeared towards the end, 
where he offered a distinction between finite and in­
finite collections. He announced that a set was finite 
if no one-to-one correspondence could be found be­
tween the set and any proper subset. Peirce’s favorite 

166
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
example (([31], p. 772; [32], Vol. 3, 288) was a syllo­
gism which appeared in numerous equivalent forms 
throughout his mathematical and logical writings:
Every Hottentot kills a Hottentot,
No Hottentot is killed by more than one Hotten­
tot,
Hence, every Hottentot is killed by a Hottentot.
The syllogism is true only if the set of Hottentots 
is finite. The form of the syllogism, Peirce noted, 
was due to De Morgan, who called it the syllogism 
of transposed quantity [15]. Thus Peirce’s interest in 
the infinite was inspired by studies in logic and the 
consequences one might draw from the syllogism of 
transposed quantity. In keeping with his interests, and 
in pushing his study of quantity, both finite and infi­
nite, as far as he could, Peirce decided that a perfectly 
logical definition of continuity was needed, and in 
1897, when he published “The Logic of Relatives” 
[33] in The Monist, he wrote that:
A perfectly satisfactory logical account of the 
conception of continuity is required. This in­
volves the definition of a certain kind of infinity, 
and in order to make that quite clear, it is requi­
site to begin by developing the logical doctrine 
of infinite multitude. This doctrine still remains, 
after the works of Cantor, Dedekind, and others, 
in an inchoate condition. For example, such a 
question remains unanswered as the following: 
is it, oris it not, logically possible for two collec­
tions to be so multitudinous that neither can be 
put into a one-to-one correspondence with a part 
or the whole of the other? To resolve this prob­
lem demands, not a mere application of logic, 
but a further development of the conception of 
logical possibility.
But what did Peirce mean by the need to define 
a certain kind of infinity before the concept of con­
tinuity could be accounted for logically? What was 
“inchoate” about the work of Cantor and Dedekind? 
Why was the comparability of cardinals, in Peirce’s 
view, impossible to establish without developing fur­
ther the concept of logical possibility? What, in fact, 
did Peirce mean by logical possibility? The answers 
to all these questions hinge on Peirce’s view of the 
infinite, and upon a very important discovery, one he 
apparently made independently of Georg Cantor, and 
one for which Peirce was always, and justifiably so, 
very proud.
Peirce proved (though exactly when he did so for 
the first time is unclear), that the power of the set of all 
subsets ofa given set is always greater than the power 
of the original set itself. In other words, for any ex­
ponent K, 2^ > K, a result, as Peirce put it, of “prime 
importance” (see [31], pp. 51, 777, 785; also [32], 
Vol. 4, 200-212). Beginning from the smallest infi­
nite set, the set of all integers, he concluded that it was 
always possible to produce increasingly larger sets of 
greater and greater power. Peirce designated the col­
lection of all integers “denumerable”. The set of all 
real numbers comprised what he called the “first ab- 
numeral” or the “primipostnumeral” multitude. The 
set of all subsets of the real numbers produced the 
“second abnumeral”, or the “secundo-postnumeral” 
multitude, and so on. Since one could always form 
from such sets the set of all subsets, Peirce noted that 
there could be no maximal multitude. But Peirce also 
commented that as for the second abnumeral, math­
ematics could offer no example of such a multitude, 
and added that in fact mathematics had no occasion to 
consider multitudes as great as this (which suggests 
that Peirce was unaware of, or did not fully appreci­
ate Cantor’s paper [6]), a comment that is somewhat 
puzzling, as we shall see, particularly in light of his 
construction of infinitesimals and his assertion that 
continua were greater in power than any postnumeral 
multitude.
In a letter to his friend E. H. Moore, Peirce com­
mented ([31], p. 925) upon the significance of his 
discovery that there was no maximum multitude:
Here we have a hint about continuity ...The 
continuum is a General. It is a General of re­
lation. Every General is a continuum vaguely 
defined.
By a “General” Peirce seems to have meant that which 
was neither discrete nor definite, “General” as op­
posed to particular or to something completely spec­
ified. But what did Peirce see in all this to help solve 
the mystery of continuity?
Peirce argued that if a continuum did not contain all 
the points that it possibly could, then there would be 
gaps or discontinuities present ([31], pp. 880-881). 
Thus it was a problem of the utmost importance to de­
termine what the maximum possible multitude was in 
order to determine the power of continua. But Peirce 
had already shown that there could be no such greatest 
possible multitude, that the process of forming power 
sets was unending, and that consequently it was a 
process that remained potential, indefinite. Similarly, 
if the continuum were to contain the maximum possi­
ble multitude of points, it had to be correspondingly 
potential, indefinite.

DAUBEN: C. S. Peirce’s Philosophy of Infinite Sets
167
Since Peirce regarded the essence of multitudes to 
be their definiteness, thus making it possible to deter­
mine their powers or cardinalities, it was reasonable 
for him to assert that since the collection of all ab- 
numerals was unending, potentially infinite, thus en­
tirely indefinite, it could not properly be called a set. 
Or, in Peirce’s terminology, it could not be called a 
multitude. Likewise, the elements constituting a con­
tinuum could not be regarded as comprising a set or 
multitude of objects. Thus the complete determina­
tion of continua was impossible, for Peirce regarded 
the concept as intrinsically potential, essentially gen­
eral ([31], pp. 62 and 981).
Consequently, Peirce was led to reject Cantor’s 
view that the geometric continuum was somehow 
made up of a multitude of points. Peirce realized that 
there were two features of such continua that had to be 
considered: one involved quantity, the other involved 
order. Cantor had published his analysis of what he 
called the simply-ordered type 3 of the continuum of 
real numbers in 1895 [7]. Peirce, however, disagreed 
on two counts. The collection of points comprising 
any continuum must be infinitely larger than any Can­
tor contemplated because, Peirce claimed, the real 
numbers R as defined by Cantor were grossly insuffi­
cient to account for the geometric continuum ([31], p. 
122). This was so, he argued, because of his discov­
ery that the set of abnumerals was unending. Since 
the line must contain all points possible, and since 
the set R corresponded to the multitude represented 
by 2^0, it could not possibly, as a completed mul­
titude, account for the nature of continuity. As for 
the question of the order of elements constituting a 
continuum, Peirce suggested that something like the 
proper idea was approximated if between every pair 
of rational numbers one inserted a sequence of irra­
tional numbers. Between any two irrationals of this 
sequence one could pack yet another such sequence, 
and so on, without end. Thus Peirce thought it was 
possible that between any two points of the contin­
uum, however close, one could always pack sets of 
points of higher and higher multitude. The continuum 
would eventually be “cemented together”, and not by 
virtue of discrete points ([31], p. 98).
Peirce illustrated his case by imagining a series 
of photographs ([31], p. 59). No matter how close 
the intervals, no motion will appear in any of them. 
But our perception of motion in time shows that time 
must be more than a succession of instants. More 
than single, isolated point “instants” must be present 
to our consciousness. What is this something more? 
Peirce claimed that
1. in a sensible time there exists room for any multi­
tude of distinct instants.
2. The instants are so close together they merge and 
cannot be distinct.
And this view of time and its continuity greatly influ­
enced Peirce’s view of the continuum and the logical 
status of continuity. Just as parts of time merged to 
lose their identity, so too the points ofa line. If conti­
nuity consisted of nothing but a special type of serial 
order, he argued that two continuous lines thought to 
intersect might actually “slip through” each other, this 
presumably being possible wherever spaces between 
one object and its “next” in the serial ordering on each 
line might occur. This certainly suggests that Peirce 
had a very different way of thinking about continuity 
and serial order than did Cantor.
Peirce, as he put it himself, took the very word con­
tinuity to mean that the instants of time or the points 
of a line were everywhere “welded together” ([31], 
pp. 61-62). As evidence of this, he seems to have 
been content to argue that its justification was noth­
ing more than common sense. Peirce concluded that 
the instants of time did not constitute a multitude (or 
set, whose elements had to be distinct and definite). 
In fact, the collection of instants in any continuum of 
time had to be more than any multitude.
To illustrate his idea of continuity, Peirce outlined 
a procedure which he called interpolation on the unit 
interval, and which involved decimal representations 
given with only the digits 0 and 1. At step (I) there 
was only one interpolation, at step (II) there were 2, 
at step (III) there were four, at step (IV) there were 8, 
and at step (N) there would be 2N . Schematically:
0.000... 
1.000...
(I) 
.100. . .
(II) 
.010... 
.110. . .
(III) 
.001... 
.011... 
.101... 
.111.. .
Here Peirce found, as he put it, a “premonition of 
continuity”. In carrying out this procedure, a non- 
denumerably infinite number of interpolations would 
be made. Somehow this process was to help Peirce 
explain how the continuum was able, in his words, 
to “stick together” ([31], p. 88). No finite collection 
could ever “stick together” in any order, nor could any 
denumerably infinite collection if considered in any 
well-ordered form. The difficulty in describing the 
continuity of the real line, Peirce believed, reduced 
to the fact that numbers per se could never account 
for continuity ([31], 3:93-94 and [32], 3:568). Num­
bers expressed nothing but the order, he believed, of 
discrete objects. Nothing discrete could possibly be 
multitudinous enough to account for the continuum.

168
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
For example, Peirce noted that in supposing the 
countable collection of the set of rational points to 
be completely present on the line, one was in ef­
fect supposing also the collection of irrational points, 
in the sense that the irrationals could be consid­
ered as interpolated between the rationals ([31], 3:94, 
3:.880-881). Hence the denumerable set of rationals 
carried with it the existence of a non-denumerable 
collection of points—namely, the first abnumeral 
multitude of irrational numbers. In exactly the same 
way, said Peirce, the system of irrational points on a 
line led to a secundo-postnumeral collection of points 
interpolated between the irrationals. This secundo­
postnumeral collection for Peirce involved his in­
finitesimals, and it is possible to understand the role 
they played more clearly by returning for a moment 
to his diagram of decimal interpolations.
In a letter to M. F. C. S. Schiller of 1906, Peirce 
explained that by a Leibnizian infinitesimal of the 
first order he meant an assumed quantity smaller than 
any finite positive quantity ([31], 3.989). It was the 
first quantity after the sequence 0.1, 0.01, 0.001,.....
Peirce believed it was impossible to prove that there 
was no such quantity. In fact, he believed his in­
finitesimals were given an imprimatur of sorts by na­
ture, since he took their existence to be necessary for 
physics ([31], pp. 898 and 957). To support this claim 
of the physical reality of infinitesimals, Peirce re­
ferred to the experience of memory. The perception of 
the flow of time must extend, he said, beyond a single 
instant. Yet Peirce could not see how such phenom­
ena could be satisfactorily explained unless time were 
believed to be strictly infinitesimal. Moreover, there 
were reasons from physics which also established the 
necessary existence of infinitesimal magnitudes.
In a letter written in 1908 to P. E. B. Jourdain ([31], 
pp. 123-124, [32], Vol. 3, p. 570), Peirce struck up 
a theme which Cantor had sketched, but never devel­
oped, in a short article of 1885. Cantor had conjec­
tured that in order to explain satisfactorily the phe­
nomena of nature, one had to suppose two sorts of 
monads, material and aetherial. He conjectured that 
the power of the set of all material monads was denu­
merable, of cardinality K0, while the set of aetherial 
monads was equipotent with the second cardinal, K 1.
Peirce applied this idea in order to explain how mat­
ter could act on the brain to produce thought. Peirce 
posited two fluids, one vortex of matter-monads, and 
an infinitely subtler vortex of soul-monads, where the 
diameters of the soul-monads were to be taken as in­
finitesimals of infinite order, which Peirce felt was 
quite appropriate for the character of soul-monads.
This theory was given the name of the “introvortical 
theory” ([32], Vol. 3, 896). It all helped to convince 
Peirce that with physical counterparts for his logical 
infinitesimals, there was pragmatic justification for 
arguing their validity.
Peirce’s most important reason for insisting that 
his infinitesimals were acceptable involved their self­
consistency. Logically, being non-contradictory, there 
was no reason not to admit them into mathemat­
ics. Though Peirce did not undertake a careful arith­
metic investigation of the properties of his infinites­
imals, nor did he undertake any investigation of 
non-archimedean systems in general, he was a proto­
proponent of non-standard analysis in believing that 
there was perhaps more to understanding the nature of 
continuity than the rationals and irrationals together 
could manage to explain.
To make Peirce’s point as clear as possible, it may 
be helpful, in closing, to sketch his reasons for ar­
guing that the rationals and irrationals together were 
insufficient to account for the nature of continuity. 
While Cantor and Dedekind regarded the irrational 
numbers as completing the rationals, and thus con­
ferring completeness on the real numbers, Peirce saw 
the relation between rationals and irrationals some­
what differently. He concluded that there was a kind 
of “nextness” in the reals which actually constituted 
a breach of continuity ([31], pp. 125, 121-122). Sup­
pose, he argued, that we do have a clear idea of a 
sequence of real numbers. If we have a clear idea of 
their order, it can be assumed that any set of objects 
sufficiently multitudinous can be similarly ordered. 
Assume each of these objects to be replaced with a 
sequence of points, similar in order to the real num­
bers on the open interval (0, 1). But there is no reason 
to stop here, and Peirce went onto replace each point 
of such series by yet other series, and so on, without 
end. In his own words ([31], p. 126):
The result is, that we have altogether eliminated 
points. We have a series of series of series, ad in­
finitum. Every part, however closely designated, 
is still a series and divisible into further series. 
There are no points in such a line. There is no 
exact boundary between any parts.
It would be easier to interpret the significance 
Peirce attached to his infinitesimals for mathematics 
had he ever commented explicitly upon Cantor’s and 
Dedekind’s axioms of continuity, which hypothesized 
the equivalence of the standard Archimedean arith­
metic continuum and the geometric continuum. But 

DAUBEN: C. S. Peirce’s Philosophy of Infinite Sets
169
all we have is Peirce’s allegation that the real num­
bers were insufficient to account for the continuity of 
space and time. As for analysis, however, it never had 
need to consider multitudes greater in magnitude than 
that of the first abnumeral, which meant that the set of 
real numbers was enough for the interests of analysis 
and presumably for all of mathematics ([31], p. 85).
Peirce wanted to explore the logical boundaries of 
the possible in terms of the infinitely large and the 
infinitely small, and found no logical contradictions 
or constraints in either conception. Since his interests 
were primarily philosophical, it is perhaps easier to 
understand why he never submitted his ideas to a 
more searching mathematical analysis than he did.
Ultimately Peirce’s infinitesimals remained vague 
rather than rigorously defined mathematical entities. 
He never suggested how they might be useful in anal­
ysis. But then Peirce’s interests had never been in­
clined towards analysis. From the very beginning he 
had been inspired by the purely logical implications of 
the syllogism of transposed quantity, and the logic of 
relations. Thus, unlike Cantor, he was not concerned 
to develop the arithmetic properties of his ideas, since 
their existence as numbers was not for him of great 
consequence. He was interested in illuminating a deep 
philosophical problem of long standing, namely that 
of the continuum, and he felt that conceptually he had 
found an approach to the subject that was the most 
satisfying of all.
Finally, how can we now draw all of these ideas 
together in order to interpret Peirce’s claim that “the 
continuum is a General”, meaning that it could not 
be defined as a set in Cantor’s sense ofa collection of 
distinct elements, and Peirce’s statement that “Infinity 
is nothing but a peculiar twist given to generality”? 
(See Peirce’s letter to William James, [32], Vol. 8, 
268.) Peirce took generality to involve the potential 
infinite, in that anything not general, anything spe­
cific, was completed in some sense or other. He also 
took infinity to be a potentiality, something never 
completed, and thus it too reposed upon generality. 
Reasoning about such matters, he noted with perhaps 
too little emphasis, was always exceedingly puzzling.
Almost all metaphysicians, and even mathemati­
cians, he added, had fallen into pitfalls concerning 
the infinite where the “ground was spongy” ([31], p. 
79). Trouble inevitably stemmed from quantifiers like 
“all and every”, but if one were always certain to de­
termine how objects in question were to be selected, 
he believed that erroneous reasoning could easily be 
avoided. The trouble with the collection of all ab- 
numerable multitudes was simply that it could never 
be considered as completed. It was self-generating, 
without end. Such collections were so great that they 
were no longer discrete, and not being complete, no 
definite determination of their magnitude could be 
given. They were potential and as such, general. In 
the same way the line was general, indeterminate, 
since between any of its points, Peirce imagined that 
more could be packed representing supermultitudi- 
nous collections. To quote Peirce directly ([31], p. 
95):
Such supermultitudinous collections stick to­
gether by logical necessity. Its constituent in­
dividuals are no longer distinct, or independent. 
They are not subjects but phases expressive of 
the properties of the continuum.
Peirce offered a graphic illustration. Suppose a col­
lection of blades were to cut the line. So long as they 
did not comprise a supermultitudinous collection, the 
line would be cut up into bits, each of which was 
still a line. Peirce therefore urged mathematicians to 
discard all analytical theories about lines, and rec­
ommended that they begin from his view, a synthetic 
point of view ([31], p. 96). By a simple mental exper­
iment, he believed he had shown that the line refused 
to be cut up into points. But even if mathematicians 
refused to accept his arguments, Peirce insisted that 
only one thing mattered: his idea of continuity and of 
infinitesimals involved no contradiction. In closing, 
he warned ([31], pp. 87-89):
I am careful not to call supermultitudinous col­
lections multitudes. Multitudes imply an inde­
pendence of the individuals of one another which 
is not found in supermultitudinous sets. Here the 
elements are cemented together, they become in­
distinct.
Here Peirce had reached the potentiality, the general­
ity that he had earlier said was essential if one were 
to understand properly the structure of continuity. For 
Peirce, the essence of continuity depended upon the 
supermultitudinousness of the elements of the line, 
and their “intrinsic arrangement which is inseparable 
from the particular grade of multitude in which those 
phenomena of cohesion are found” ([31], pp. 98-99).
It is now possible to see what Peirce meant when 
he wrote to Paul Carus, editor of The Monist, to say 
that at last he had seen where Cantor had gone wrong 
([31], p. 792). Continuity could not come from any 
collection of points because points were discrete, de­
termined, and if anything, points represented discon­
tinuities when removed from the line. In summarizing 

170
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
his view for Judge Francis Russell in 1909, Peirce in­
terpreted the essence of continuity in terms of the 
potential and completely general nature of the ideas 
involved. “As to a straight line not having any def­
inition proper, it is demonstrable that it cannot be, 
properly speaking, defined” ([31], p. 981).
If we may take “properly speaking” to mean “math­
ematically speaking”, then there was not much Peirce 
could hope to offer in such a view to his mathemati­
cal colleagues. But it is also true that he did not feel 
mathematics needed to go so far, apparently, in the 
analysis of the continuum as he had gone. Peirce was 
interested in pushing the logical consequences of his 
ideas to their ultimate conclusions for the sake of phi­
losophy, but analysis, he seemed to say, could stop at 
something less.
For Peirce, such ideas justified themselves as a mat­
ter of instinct, of common sense ([31], p. 56). He 
had always held that his intuitive understanding of 
the continuum, or the continuity of space and time, 
were the ultimate guides in his analysis of continu­
ity. Nothing could have been further from the aims 
of Weierstrassian analysis, which sought to reject all 
such intuitions and aimed to base mathematics upon 
more certain foundations of arithmetic. Weierstrass 
had constructed examples of everywhere continuous, 
nowhere differentiable functions to show the inade­
quacy of intuition. But Peirce was not convinced, and 
once even commented that Weierstrassian mathemat­
ics, in showing a distrust of intuition, betrayed an 
ignorance of fundamental principles of logic ([31], 
p. 968). Peirce followed his intuitions as far as they 
would carry him, and it may have been this feature of 
his thinking, as much as his interest in philosophical 
and metaphysical arguments, that prevented his being 
more readily accepted by those of his contemporaries 
even aware of his work.
Conclusion
Peirce once said that it was the business of science 
and mathematics to guess. For mathematics this re­
duced to the fabrication of hypotheses to be tested 
for logical self-consistency ([31], p. 893). If no con­
tradictions could be deduced, then the hypothesis, or 
the mathematical theory in question, stood as accept­
able. This was the basis upon which Peirce argued 
most persuasively for the respectability of his ideas 
concerning infinitesimals and continuity. Kepler, to 
Peirce’s mind, was the greatest guesser the history 
of science had ever seen. But in terms of American 
mathematics at the turn of the century, Peirce may 
easily have been an equally impressive guesser, pro­
ducing the mathematical hypothesis of infinitesimals.
Kepler lacked sufficient mathematical techniques 
and a theory of gravitation to establish a convincing 
explanation of his laws, deficiencies Isaac Newton 
would later remedy. In much the same way, Peirce 
lacked sufficient techniques to produce a rigorous the­
ory of non-Archimedean systems. But his hypotheses 
were eventually vindicated, in the twentieth century, 
by mathematicians like Schmieden, Laugwitz, Robin­
son, and Luxemburg (see [36], [23], [35], [24]). Per­
haps until the middle of this century, only a mathe­
matician as interested in philosophy as was Peirce, 
and as isolated from the prevailing assumptions of 
established mathematics of the nineteenth century, 
could have pursued the problem of continuity in the 
way he did. Out of touch with much of European 
mathematics, Peirce considered infinitesimals with an 
unprejudiced eye to affirm not only their existence, 
but to argue as well that the arithmetic continuum 
of real numbers was only a very incomplete picture 
of the actual richness of any continuum. Working in 
obscurity, penury, and isolation, he nevertheless saw, 
if only a glimmer, what later generations might be 
more willing to accept. In light of current research in 
non-standard analysis, it is now possible to consider, 
more rigorously than did Peirce, alternatives to the 
traditional nineteenth-century view of the standard 
Archimedean continuum.

Introduction
Logic is a disparate topic, occurring in almost any 
field of human activity without appearing to have 
much character of its own. Traditionally it was as­
sociated largely with methods of reasoning and re­
garded as encapsulated in the principles of syllogistic 
logic. It was the concern mostly of philosophers and 
developed in the context of rather general questions. 
During the second half of the nineteenth century there 
was especial concern with connections with psychol­
ogy. For example, some authors maintained that psy­
chology is a descriptive theory concerned with how 
we think, while logic is a normative discipline about 
how we ought to think (see [74] for the case of Mill).
Mathematics began to play a significant role in 
logic with Boole’s work around 1850 on Boolean 
algebra. From the technical point of view his work 
increased the scope of reasoning; and his contempo­
rary De Morgan and successors Peirce and Schroder 
moved still further beyond the confines of syllogistic 
logic when they developed a theory of relations in 
their algebraic logic. Otherwise, however, the gener­
ality of concern remained; for example, Boole saw 
his own logic as concerned with the workings of the 
mind.
A different tradition was instituted around 1880 
with the mathematical logic of Frege and Peano, and 
its development by Russell and Whitehead. Not only 
is the logic itself rather different in form; the moti­
vations lie in specific questions in the foundations of 
mathematics, in contrast to the general concerns indi­
cated above for other logicians. There were two prin­
cipal motivations: the foundations of arithmetic; and 
the formal language required to express mathemati­
cal analysis in the style of Weierstrass, with especial 
concern for the set theory of Cantor. In Russell and 
Whitehead both problems are treated, because they 
followed the principle (though not the methods) of 
Cantor in seeking a foundation for arithmetic in set 
theory.
All these developments belong to the pre-history of 
my topic, andI shall not dwell on them here (see [11], 
[12], [31], [34], [20], and [7]), while better known but 
less reliable sources include [49], [3] and [83]; [90] 
contains English translations, with commentaries, of 
many major papers up through 1918. I must indicate 
now, however, that there was already in that period 
something of an overthrow of the old tradition by the 
new one. This paper, for example, is almost entirely 
concerned with the consequences and further advance 
of mathematical logic. I shall conclude this introduc­
tory section by indicating the topics to be discussed 
and also those which I have avoided or set aside.
Section 2 concerns the development of logicism, 
which had been expounded in Whitehead and Rus­
sell’s Principia Mathematica of 1910-1913 [96]. Dis­
cussion is confined to Wittgenstein, Ramsey, and 
Quine, who made substantial revisions in, or use of, 
logicism. Section 3 charts the progress of Hilbert’s 
formalism in the 1920s, including the blow dealt to it 
by Godel’s incompletability theorem of 1931. Section 
4 surveys the interest taken in recursion and com­
putability by Church, Kleene, and Turing, especially 
as an extension of the proof method used by Godel in 
the proof of his 1931 theorem. Section 5 deals with 
the intuitionism of Brouwer, including some remarks 
on his polemics with Hilbert. Section 6 covers cer­
tain extensions to the traditional conception of math­
ematical logic that were proposed and/or rejected by

Hilbert, Skolem, and Zermelo. Infinitary and second- 
order logics were the principal candidates for atten­
tion. Section 7 selects some of the topics studied by 
Polish logicians, concentrating on the comments on 
logicism by Chwistek, Lesniewski’s logical systems, 
Tarski’s contributions to semantics and related topics, 
and Lukasiewicz’s advocacy of many-valued logics. 
Finally, in Section 8 I compare the situation around 
1939 with that in 1918.
Even this range of topics far from exhausts the 
developments in logic between the two world wars. 
For reasons of both space and prudence I have omit­
ted topics such as inductive logic, phenomenological 
logic, and the role played by logic in the development 
of quantum mechanics. I have also touched only very 
lightly on related topics in mathematics which bore 
also on logic in various ways: abstract algebra, model 
theory, and especially axiomatic set theory and trans- 
finite arithmetic, although in some sections I com­
ment on the views held on the relationship between 
logic, mathematics, and set theory. Throughout I have 
had to elide many of the fine distinctions that in fact 
played some role in the developments, and also omit 
many of the historical details. For this I crave the 
indulgence of specialists.
Note that the general history of inter-war logic has 
not been written. Dumitriu [22] and Guillaume [35] 
provide brief notices of various aspects, while Hermes 
[39] surveys the period 1890-1965 at similar speed. 
Mangione [61] is much more substantial. Some as­
pects of developments in the 1930s are summarized 
passim in Mostowski [66]. Van Heijenoort [90] also 
contains English translations, with commentaries, of 
major papers up to 1931. Church [16] contains histor­
ical notes, and [15] provides a detailed bibliography 
of symbolic logic up to that time; a more extensive 
bibliography up to recent times is in preparation by J. 
M. B. Moss.

Logicism and its critics
The philosophical position expounded in Whitehead 
and Russell’s three-volume Principia Mathematica 
of 1910-13 was that pure mathematics is derivable 
solely from logical principles and by logical pro­
cesses of reasoning. By ‘logic’ they understood a 
form of mathematical logic comprising calculi of 
propositions and predicates (or propositional func­
tions), including multi-order quantification over indi­
viduals and predicates, and certain rules of inference. 
This logic was intended to embrace set theory. By 
‘pure’ they intended to emphasize the logical form 
p ^ q for mathematical propositions. By ‘mathemat­
ics’ they seem to have intended to cover the whole 
subject, though the details were confined to finite 
and transfinite arithmetic, the foundations of real- 
variable analysis, and various other topics prelimi­
nary to a fourth volume on geometry that Whitehead 
never completed. To avoid the paradoxes of set theory 
the logical system included a theory of types. Unfor­
tunately, in order to express the required mathematics 
they had to introduce the axiom of reducibility, which 
asserted that to any predicate of an object a there 
exists a logically equivalent predicate which presup­
poses only objects of the type of a. The “logical” 
status of this axiom was, to say the least, not obvious.
I shall confine myself in this section to later 
considerations of the broad principles of logicism, 
rather than the various technical improvements that 
were rendered. Russell’s conception of logic was all­
embracing in that, to use later terminology, it included 
indiscriminately both logical and metalogical topics. 
Thus it was, strictly speaking, impossible for Russell 
to talk about his logic. Among other drawbacks, this 
situation threatens logicism with circularity; for one 
might assert that pure mathematics is derivable solely 
from logic, but also specify logic so as to ensure that 
pure mathematics is encompassed.
This problem was tackled by some of Russell’s fol­
lowers, who tried to define, or characterize, logic in 
a manner independent of logicism (see [32]). For ex­
ample, Wittgenstein announced in the preface to his 
Tractatus that his purpose was “to seta limit . . . to the 
expression of thoughts” ([97], p. 3). In his work he 
outlined the idea of treating complex propositions as 
truth-functions of elementary propositions, the truth­
functionality to be expressed by truth tables ([97], 
Prop. 4.31). Logical propositions are characterized as 
tautologies (6.1), that is, propositions whose truth­
value is true under all truth-values of their compo­
nent propositions (4.46). Mathematics “is a logical 
method” (6.2), and so presumably also has tautolo- 
gous status.
In his introduction to Tractatus, Russell seized on 
Wittgenstein’s remark about setting a limit to the 
expression of thoughts, and admitted the possibility 
“that there may be another language dealing with the 
structure of the first language, and having itself a new 
structure, and that to this hierarchy of languages there 
may be no limit” ([97], p. xxii). Itis curious that when 
beginning to prepare the second edition of Principia 
Mathematica a year later, Russell did not start from 
this important remark, which was made at the time 
when the recognition of metalogic as independent of 

174
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
logic was far from widely known. (Frege’s distinc­
tion of object- and meta-language is the most explicit 
case of the period.) In his new material he used other 
suggestions of Wittgenstein, especially the idea of 
truth-functionality. It made his system much more 
extensional (that is, based on regarding collections 
as composed of their members rather than as defined 
by (intensional) properties), although the extent to 
which extensionality is taken does not seem to be 
clear.
This move towards extensionality was followed 
with enthusiasm by Ramsey, who had read the proofs 
of Russell’s new material. In his own work, especially 
[71], Ramsey defined universal and existential quan­
tification as infinite conjunctions and disjunctions of 
propositions, respectively; for example,
Definition: (3x) o.r = oa V ob V • • • .
He took all predicates as extensional, and in these 
terms re-structured the type theory of Principia 
Mathematica without having to use the axiom of 
reducibility.
Ramsey also distinguished the paradoxes into 
mathematical ones, concerned with sets and numbers, 
and semantic ones, which deal with notions such as 
definability; and he divided type theory correspond­
ingly into simple and ramified parts. Since his time it 
has become customary to regard semantic paradoxes 
as irrelevant to logicism.
Logicism also attracted the attention of the Vienna 
Circle of philosophers, especially Carnap, who wrote 
one of the first books [9] in German on logicism. 
In his Der Logische Aufbau der Welt [8], which out­
lined much of the philosophical programme of the 
Circle, he made considerable use of Russell’s logical 
techniques, including the Russell/Wittgenstein view 
of extensionality. Interestingly, in his preface to the 
English edition of the book, he admitted that his use 
of extensionality “is unclear in some points” ([10], 
p. ix).
Another Vienna Circle member took up Principia 
Mathematica; for Godel’s incompletability theorem 
of 1931 showed that the Russellian logicist pro­
gramme cannot be executed (see the next section). 
Thereafter the question of the relationship between 
mathematics, logic, and set theory was obviously 
wide open. Quine’s work has been particularly influ­
ential in this area; he devised various logical systems 
of the scope of Principia Mathematica without es­
pousing logicism. Two of his early systems were the 
so-called New Foundations [67], in which type the­
ory is replaced by a stratification of formulae; and 
Mathematical Logic [69], where the paradoxes were 
avoided by following von Neumann’s idea of denying 
that certain objects can be members of sets. In these 
and other systems some status was assigned to set 
theory which is autonomous of logic. No definitive 
view of the distinction between logic and set theory 
has been laid down (see [70]); but Russell’s logicist 
standpoint, that set theory is part of logic, was aban­
doned.
Russell himself wrote little on logicism after the 
second edition of Principia Mathematica. Whitehead 
sketched a revised logico-arithmetical system in [95], 
based on the notion of instantiation of objects; despite 
many readings, I have not been able to see how far it 
can be developed. During the inter-war period logi- 
cism fell quite substantially in reputation; although 
it influenced logicians both as an early example of a 
comprehensive mathematico-logical system and as a 
source of techniques, the philosophical position itself 
won few followers.
I conclude this section with an event of our period 
which was unknown at the time but which is of es­
pecial historical interest. The first logicist was Frege, 
although he did not include “all” mathematics in his 
viewpoint. His work was not widely known during 
the inter-war years, although Scholz hoped to publish 
his manuscripts. In one of these texts from 1925 [23], 
Frege abandoned logicism entirely, on the grounds 
that logic alone could not provide objects for which 
properties such as equality or set-membership can 
be appraised. The rejection of a life-long position is 
a rare achievement in mankind. It reveals a special 
kind of greatness.
3 
Formalism and its fate
Hilbert strongly advocated the use of axiomatics in 
mathematics in his early years. These were the 1890s, 
when such a view was far from widespread among 
mathematicians (see [11]). In the 1900s he applied 
the approach to the foundations of logic and arith­
metic; but he was very unclear on the distinction be­
tween a formal system and its interpretation, so that 
his early papers make peculiar reading. Perhaps for 
these reasons he seems to have set the work aside; but 
he resumed his interests during the First World War 
(see [42]), and he developed his ideas much further in 
the 1920s to espouse formalism, in which a mathemat­
ical theory is axiomatized and treated as a string of 
symbols for the purpose of studying, in metamathe­
matics, properties such as consistency, completeness, 
and the existence (or not) of decision procedures (that 

GRATTAN-GUINNESS: On the Development of Logics between the two World Wars
175
is, procedures to show that any well-formed formula 
of a formal system is provable or not).
Here is a simple example of his approach, taken 
from [43]. He gave an axiomatization of arithmetic, 
roughly like the Peano axioms without the induction 
axiom, together with the modus ponens rule of infer­
ence. He proved as a lemma that a provable formula 
need not contain the conditional connective ^ more 
than twice. He then showed that the system was con­
sistent, by showing that an equation a = ft and its 
negation a = ft are not provable.
During the 1920s Hilbert and others, especially 
his assistants Ackermann and Bernays, obtained re­
sults on consistency and completeness, and he and 
Ackermann published a textbook [46] on mathemat­
ical logic outlining their principal interests. Among 
specific results, von Neumann [92] showed in 1927 
that a certain part of first-order arithmetic was con­
sistent; Godel [27] proved in 1930 the completeness 
of the first-order predicate calculus. In the same year 
Herbrand studied various properties equivalent to the 
provability of a formula in such a system (see [[37]), 
and stated (with a defective proof) a “fundamental 
theorem” with the aid of which he could appraise (in 
[37] and also [38]) the consistency of, and decision 
procedures for, various logical and arithmetical sys­
tems. He also proved the deduction theorem for the 
first-order predicate calculus ([37], p. 108), which 
states that if a formula B is provable from A in the 
calculus, then (A ^ B) is also provable. This theo­
rem has become one of the most widely used results 
in metamathematics.
Metamathematics can itself be studied in meta­
metamathematics, and so a hierarchy of theories is 
erected. Although Hilbert confined his detailed stud­
ies to (first-level) metamathematics, his hope may 
have been that each tier in the hierarchy would be­
come successively simpler in content and assump­
tion, so that at some suitably high tier uncontroversial 
assumptions (0 =1, say) would guarantee its con­
sistency, and thereby transmit the guarantee down 
through the lower levels. By this means he could es­
tablish the consistency of mathematical theories, and 
thus show them to be cleansed of paradoxes.
Unfortunately, Godel’s incompletability theorem 
[28] showed that this conception of the relationship 
between tiers was incorrect. Godel defined an ax­
iomatic system P for first-order arithmetic, using a 
logical system like that of Principia Mathematica and 
the Peano axioms for arithmetic, and proved that P 
was incompletable in that it contains a proposition A 
for which neither A nor not-A is provable. As a corol­
lary he then showed that a proof of the consistency of 
P could not be expressed within P, but would require 
a formally richer system.
Although Godel stated that the corollary “do[es] 
not contradict Hilbert’s formalist standpoint”, on the 
grounds that there may be finitary proofs of consis­
tency not expressible within P ([28], p. 615), such a 
possibility is very unlikely, and it was soon recognized 
that Hilbert’s hopes for a consistency proof for math­
ematical theories along the lines described above, and 
belief that truth is equivalent to deducibility, must be 
abandoned. The incompletability theorem itself also 
seems to have affected logicism, for P could be con­
verted to a system like Principia Mathematica, which 
was thus also shown to be incompletable.
While Godel’s theorem rebuffed Hilbert’s hopes, 
it did not detract from interest in metamathematics; 
indeed, it led to interest in non-finitary consistency 
proofs. Of particular note was Gentzen’s proof of 
the consistency of first-order arithmetic in [26], in 
which he made use of transfinite induction. Gentzen 
made other important contributions to metamathe­
matics in his dissertation [25]. He proved a “principal 
theorem”, which has some similarity to Herbrand’s 
“fundamental theorem” mentioned above and was 
also of value in producing consistency proofs and 
seeking for decision procedures. He also recast the 
predicate calculus in a manner which is now called 
natural deduction and stands closer to heuristic rea­
soning than to traditional axiomatizations of the cal­
culus. The contributions of Gentzen and Herbrand 
exercised a marked influence on the development of 
post-Godelian metamathematics. Indeed, metamath­
ematics became one of the chief interests of logicians 
in the inter-war period.
4 Recursion and computability: 
American logic
In order to prove his incompletability theorem Godel 
had to design both his formal system P and his meta- 
mathematical concepts so that his meta-statement of 
the incompletability of P could be expressed in its 
own formal language. Since P was a formulation 
of first-order arithmetic, the metamathematics had to 
be expressible in arithmetical terms. This led Godel 
to his process of the “arithmetization of metamath­
ematics”, in which he developed a theory of what 
are now called primitive recursive functions. (The 
process of arithmetization requires the distinction be­
tween a formal system and its interpretation to be 

176
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
made very carefully. Professor J. Barkley Rosser, who 
contributed to the early studies of Godel’s theorem, 
has told me in reminiscence that not until this theo­
rem was published did logicians realize how carefully 
they had to make the distinction.)
Recursion had already been noted in the 1920s, 
especially in the metamathematical studies discussed 
in the previous section; Skolem [81] is also a notable 
contribution. But Godel’s treatment was the most sys­
tematic hitherto, and his theorem suggested that there 
may be similar limits to recursion. These researches 
were actively pursued in the 1930s. Many of the prin­
cipal papers are reprinted in [21], and a detailed 
account of the results is provided by Kleene ([51], 
part 3).
We take as initial functions the successor function 
(^(x) = x + 1), the constant function (0(x) = K), 
and the identification function (^({xi}) = xr). A 
primitive recursive function is defined as obtainable 
from a finite number of uses of the initial functions 
and of schemata given by
$(x) = S ({x (x)})
and 0(0) = k, 
0(y + 1) = $ (y, $(y)).
I have stated the definition for a function of one vari­
able; generalizations to functions of several variables 
are obvious.
Examples of recursive functions that cannot be ob­
tained by the process of primitive recursion had been 
known since the late 1920s, and extended definitions 
were proposed. One, due to Kleene [50], defined a 
function as general recursive if it were obtained from 
the processes of primitive recursion and also an eval­
uation procedure of the form (for functions of one 
variable)
^(x) = the smallest value of y such that ^(x,y) = 0.
^ is a given function, and at least one value of y is 
assumed to exist. The function is not reducible to the 
others because no upper bound is set on the value 
allowed for y.
Church proposed as a thesis that general recursion 
be taken as the definition of the effective calculability 
of a number-theoretic function, and proved theorems 
of a generalized Godelian type on the lack of a deci­
sion procedure for first-order arithmetic (see [14]). In 
the same year Turing proposed as a thesis that com­
putability be defined as the operations that can be 
executed by a Turing machine, which is the concep­
tion of a computer reduced to essentials (see [89]).
It was shown that general recursion was equiv­
alent to computability for number-theoretic func­
tions. Thus an interesting connection between logic 
and computing was established, and has continued 
in various forms ever since. Both of these notions 
were shown to be equivalent to a concept called A- 
definability, introduced by Church as part of his pro­
posal (initiated in [13]) for a logic without variables. 
This proposal led to the early development of combi­
natory logic (see [19]).
All the work described in this and the last sec­
tion was basically inspired by Hilbert’s programme 
for metamathematics, and in their treatise [47] he 
and Bernays gave a detailed account of the develop­
ments. Naturally many of the results were obtained 
by Hilbert and his colleagues; but Americans also 
played a prominent role, especially Church, Kleene, 
Post, Rosser, and Godel (resident in America from 
1933).
Since that time America has been a leading country 
for logic, and saw the founding in 1936 of the Asso­
ciation for Symbolic Logic. This organization is still 
the only international organization for the subject, and 
its Journal of Symbolic Logic, also founded in 1936, 
was the first journal devoted exclusively to logic and 
related topics. By 1939 the Association had achieved 
a membership of around 200, which was also around 
the number of pages published in each volume of the 
Journal. It was founded soon after the establishment 
in America of the Philosophy of Science Association 
in 1934, together with the journal Philosophy of Sci­
ence. The Association was then strongly influenced 
by Vienna Circle emigres resident in America, and 
so showed some interest in logic and its applications, 
after the spirit of Carnap’s employment of techniques 
from Principia Mathematica that I noted in Sec­
tion 2.
A similar recognition of institutional change may 
be noted in the Jahrbuch uber die Fortschritte der 
Mathematik, the leading journal between the two 
world wars for mathematical reviews. It had estab­
lished a section for set theory before 1918, containing 
both the abstract and the point-set branches, and also 
a rather vague section called Philosophy where logic 
was usually covered. But in Volume 61, for 1935 
and published in 1936, point-set theory was placed 
within Real functions or Topology, Philosophy was 
abandoned, and a new section entitled Foundations 
of mathematics: Abstract set theory was established. 
With Volume 65, for 1939 and published in 1943, 
this section had become Foundations of mathemati­
cal logic with the sub-sections Philosophical, Logic, 

GRATTAN-GUINNESS: On the Development of Logics between the two World Wars
177
and Foundational arithmetic and algebra; and ab­
stract and point set theory had been reunited again 
as a section under Analysis. Other minor changes 
occurred until the final Volume 68 for 1942, pub­
lished in 1944; but the sub-section for logic was re­
tained. The Zentralblatt fur Mathematik allowed for 
Foundational questions, logic from its inception in 
1931, and Mathematical Reviews included Founda­
tions (initially Foundations of analysis) when it began 
to appear in 1940.
5 
The emergence of intuitionism
The intuitionistic philosophy of mathematics is asso­
ciated primarily with Brouwer’s rejection of the law 
of excluded middle as a valid logical principle. He 
introduced his ideas in the 1900s, and first largely ap­
plied them to Cantorian set theory; but around 1918 
he began to develop them in more detail as a general 
viewpoint for both logic and mathematics.
Brouwer advocated that mathematical proofs be re­
stricted to constructive processes. Thus there was a di­
rect clash with Hilbert’s formalism; for while Hilbert 
assumed the law of excluded middle as part of his 
means of proving the consistency of mathematical 
theories, Brouwer felt that
the (contentual) justification of formalistic 
mathematics by means of the proof of its consis­
tency contains a vicious circle, since this justifi­
cation rests upon . . .the (contentual) correctness 
of the principle of excluded middle ([6], p. 491).
He came to reject Cantor’s theory of the actual in­
finite; but Hilbert supported Cantor, and used meta- 
mathematical techniques to try to prove Cantor’s con­
tinuum hypothesis. Brouwer also tried to replace the 
classical formulations of mathematical analysis with 
intuitionistic forms (see, for example, [5]).
However, Brouwer did not help his cause by the 
notoriously obscure formulation of his basic notions 
(for helpful explanations, see [90], pp. 446-457) and 
dogmatic assertions, such as mathematics being inde­
pendent of both language and logic. The discussion 
between him and Hilbert was largely unprofitable, 
partly for these reasons and partly for a clash of per­
sonalities.
These clashes came to a head at the Interna­
tional Congress of Mathematicians, held at Bologna 
in 1928. Brouwer, a Germanophile although born 
Dutch, shared the sentiments of some Germans that 
their country should not participate. However, Hilbert 
led the German delegation; and in the following year 
he removed Brouwer from the editorial board of 
Mathematische Annalen (see [72], pp. 184-188). The 
whole issue undoubtedly involved ideological consid­
erations; but some aspects of the early work of Hilbert 
and Brouwer suggest that, concerning Brouwer him­
self, there may have been purely personal elements. 
Hilbert’s early papers of 1904 on metamathematics 
are scarcely intelligible, for want ofa careful distinc­
tion between symbols and their referents. Brouwer’s 
thesis of 1907, by contrast, makes the distinction 
very clearly (see [4], pp. 61, 70, 101), although he 
does not develop a theory of “mathematics of the 
second order”. Hilbert will probably not have read 
this Dutch thesis; but in later papers Brouwer re­
ported communicating these ideas in conversation 
with Hilbert in 1909 (see, for example, [4], p. 410). 
When Hilbert started again on metamathematics in 
1917, the distinction is clearly made. Brouwer, an ex­
pert at nurturing grudges, could well have felt (with 
or without justice) that his ideas were being used 
without acknowledgement, and sought some kind of 
personal revenge at an opportune moment. Their per­
sonal relations had become further complicated by 
other personal factors (for example, Weyl’s switch 
from formalism to a type of intuitionism).
Formalism attracted much the greater support in 
the inter-war period, although several logicians wrote 
on various aspects of intuitionistic logic and mathe­
matics, and Weyl was an early convert to a form of 
intuitionism (see especially [93]). Heyting was the 
most prominent follower of intuitionism, publishing 
[40] the first textbook presenting a form of intuition- 
istic logic.
Although intuitionism owes its origins chiefly to 
Brouwer, it also suffered between the wars from his 
perplexing presentations and polemic style. But it 
has been one of the most interesting and far-reaching 
criticisms of the foundations of mathematics, and has 
continued to claim the attention of logicians to this 
day.
6 
Beyond first-order and 
finitary logics
The accounts in Sections 2-5 have been of specific 
topics and developments. In this section I wish to 
draw attention to an undercurrent in inter-war logic, 
a matter which was not quite a topic in the usual 
sense but an issue which arose and fell at various 
times, especially in the 1920s: the extension of logic 
beyond its first-order scope and finitary expression. 
To discuss the issue fully, I would have to go rather 
deeply into the development of model theory and 

178
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
axiomatic set theory, which would both imbalance 
and unduly extend this paper; I refer to [29] and [65] 
for fuller accounts.
I mentioned in Section 2 that Ramsey urged the ex­
tensional interpretation of quantification in terms of 
infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. Whether wit­
tingly or not, he was following the traditional interpre­
tations of quantifications in algebraic logic. Schroder, 
in his theory of relatives, wrote quantifiers as i aij 
and j aij, for example, where aij is (in effect) a
relation between variables i and j (see [30]) and 
and are intended to convey the idea of infinite 
conjunctions and disjunctions of propositions.
During the First World War Lowenheim wrote a pa­
per [57] on the first-order predicate calculus follow­
ing Schroderian principles. He used infinitely long 
expressions in logic following the Schroderian inter­
pretation of quantification, and noted the conversion 
of formulae into normal forms (where the quanti­
fiers are all collected together, in certain orders, at 
the front of the formula). He also proved a form of 
the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem, which states essen­
tially that every satisfiable formula of the calculus is 
satisfiable in a finite or denumerable domain.
Lowenheim’s paper stimulated various studies in 
the 1920s. Skolem dealt in more detail with normal 
forms in [79]. The reduction of formulae to normal 
forms became a very useful technique in both mathe­
matical logic and metamathematics, as developed by 
Hilbert and others in the ways described in Section 3. 
One feature was the fact that to a given normal form 
there is a dual form. Here again influence from alge­
braic logic is evident; for duality was often used by 
Schroder, whereas it is largely absent from the pred­
icate calculi of Frege and Russell (see [30], p. 121). 
Skolem produced his own proof of the Lowenheim- 
Skolem theorem, using only denumerably long ex­
pressions rather than the non-denumerably infinite 
lengths employed by Lowenheim. Later he gave a 
new, but rather weaker, proof of the theorem, using 
only finitely long expressions, and also pointed out 
as a consequence what is now known as the Skolem 
paradox: that Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory 
can be satisfied in a denumerable model even though 
the theory allows for non-denumerably infinite sets 
(see [80]).
Skolem’s new proof, unlike his old one, avoided 
using the axiom of choice. This axiom had emerged 
in the 1900s in the context of Cantorian set theory 
and mathematical analysis, and its non-constructive 
character and occasional avoidability led to a lively 
controversy over its forms and necessity (see [77], 
[31], and [64]). By the end of the First World War the 
controversy had largely died down, although Skolem 
noted the continuing reservations over the axioms— 
reservations which he did not share—at the end of 
[80]. Another mathematician who had no qualms was 
Hilbert, who now put it to a new use; the interpretation 
of quantification.
In [44] Hilbert introduced what he called the trans- 
finite axiom, which asserts that if an operator t on the 
predicate A(x) selects the value c of x for which 
A(c) is provable, then A(y) is provable for all values 
of y. He advocated the use of this axiom to define 
universal quantification in a finitary form, in contrast 
to the infinitary interpretation as infinite conjunctions 
of propositions; existential quantification could also 
be defined by applying t to not-A(x). Later he re­
stated his transfinite axiom in terms of the axiom of 
choice in a way which in effect interprets the exis­
tential quantification (3x) A(x) in terms of using a 
transfinite choice function to select a (or the) value of 
x which satisfies A (see [45]).
At this time Hilbert also urged the extension of 
logic from first-order to second-order predicate calcu­
lus (he used the terminology restricted and extended 
functional calculus), where quantification is allowed 
over predicates A as well as individuals x, for the 
purpose of expressing arithmetical notions in logical 
form (see, for example, [46], Ch. 4). In this respect 
(though not in philosophy, of course) he was moving 
towards the logicists’ practice, for they had defined 
arithmetic notions in their systems and freely allowed 
second-order quantification. Indeed, they had admit­
ted quantification to arbitrarily high orders; in Prin- 
cipia Mathematica type theory in effect separated out 
the various levels of quantification.
Thus Hilbert’s position was to be in favor of 
second-order logic but opposed to infinitary logic. 
Skolem, reluctant to rely on the concepts and tech­
niques of set theory, was opposed to both these forms 
of logic; but in the 1930s Zermelo advocated them 
both. He supported second-order logic as indispens­
able for the formalization of axiomatic set theory; 
and he used infinitary logic in a sketched theory of 
infinitely long proofs (the fullest account is in [99]), 
from which he hoped to be able to show that all 
true formulae are “provable” in his extended sense 
of proof.
Zermelo’s view seems to clash with Godel’s in­
completability theorem, which was published after 
he began to develop his ideas. The two men spoke 
in September 1931 at the annual meeting of the 
Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung on their very 

GRATTAN-GUINNESS: On the Development of Logics between the two World Wars
179
different viewpoints, and they corresponded soon af­
terwards (in letters published in [33]). In their letters 
they basically re-stated their positions; in particular, 
Godel continued to wish to use only finitary proofs.
Zermelo’s ideas were too vague for practical de­
velopment, and infinitary logics gained little interest 
until well after the Second World War. Second-order 
logic maintained some supporters, especially Hilbert, 
although the relationship with first-order logic was 
not widely discussed. The considerable differences 
between the two logics are often not realized even 
today.
7 
The rise of Polish logic
At the end of Section 4 I noted the emergence 
of America in the mid-1930s as an important cen­
ter for logic. The other—indeed, the first—major 
national development between the wars was the rise 
to prominence of Polish logicians in the 1920s. 
The principal figures were Adjukiewicz, Chwis- 
tek, Kotarbinski, Lesniewski, Lukasiewicz, Stupecki, 
Sobocinski, Tarski, and Wajsberg, although there are 
many other significant names that one could adjoin.
The rise of Poland to prominence—a position 
which it has retained to this day—is one of the 
most remarkable features of the history of twentieth­
century logic; and its early development is still more 
interesting because of the simultaneous emergence 
of a school of Polish mathematicians (see [53]). Ba­
nach, Kuratowski, Lindenbaum, Mazurkiewicz, and 
Sierpins ski were perhaps the most prominent math­
ematicians; and since many of them were strongly 
interested in algebra and set theory, their work over­
lapped in part with that of the logicians. Indeed, until 
1928 Lukasiewicz and Lessniewski were members of 
the editorial board of the Polish journal Fundamenta 
Mathematicae, launched in 1920 and devoted to set 
theory and related topics, and some logical papers 
appeared there. Otherwise the logicians published in 
various Polish academy and society journals, and also 
sometimes abroad.
In this section I can indicate only some principal 
interests; a more detailed account is provided in [48]. 
A selection of English translations of Tarski’s works 
will be found in [84], and of other authors in [62]. 
At the time many of their works were published in 
French or German (or occasionally English), though 
some appeared only in Polish.
Naturally, in the early 1920s Principia Mathemat- 
ica was a major interest. Chwistek’s contributions 
were rather similar to those of Ramsey, which I noted 
in Section 2; indeed, he anticipated Ramsey to some 
extent (see [32]). In a two-part paper [17]—rejected 
by Fundamenta Mathematicae (see [32]) but pub­
lished by the Polish Mathematical Society—he di­
vided Russell’s type theory into simple and branched 
(that is, ramified) parts, although he was less clear 
than Ramsey on the distinction between kinds of para­
dox. He also tried to re-construct type theory while 
avoiding the axiom of reducibility, although his new 
system is harder to comprehend than is Ramsey’s; 
for example, the extent of his commitment to ex- 
tensionality is less clear. His work is of some note 
as an early attempt to bridge the gap between the 
prevailing philosophies of mathematics; for while he 
constructed a system of scope comparable with that 
of Principia Mathematica, he also tried to specify his 
formal system in formalist style.
Russell also influenced Lessniewski, although here 
it was Russell’s paradox (of the set of all sets which 
do not belong to themselves) which was the prime 
source of inspiration (see [82]). Lessniewski came 
eventually to construct three logical systems (see [58] 
and [75]). Ontology is a modernized version of tra­
ditional logic; in its structural aspects it includes a 
theory of classes and relations. Mereology is a study 
of the part-whole relationship between objects. Both 
these systems took as their logical basis protothetic, a 
propositional calculus assuming only equivalence as 
a primitive connective but also using quantification 
over propositions.
This equivalential calculus was one of Tarski’s 
early contributions to logic; in fact, it was the sub­
ject of his doctoral dissertation 1923. But his main 
work lay in the growing interest in metalogic, es­
pecially concerning semantical questions. Here he 
showed some influence from Lessniewski, who in the 
early 1920s laid emphasis on semantic categories (see 
[55]) and on the role of definitions in formal theories 
and their formulation as equivalences. Tarski’s most 
celebrated work in this area is his treatise [87] on 
the semantic definition of truth as the property of a 
sentence in a language. He also broadened Hilbert’s 
conception of metamathematics into a study of “the 
methodology of the deductive sciences” (see [86]), 
where the notion of logical consequence and Her­
brand’s deduction theorem (for which Tarski claimed 
priority) played major roles. In his text-book [88] he 
laid great emphasis on the theory of deduction.
Tarski also worked with his teacher Lukasiewicz 
on many-valued logics. This topic received little at­
tention between the wars (see the historical outline 
and bibliography in [73]); in fact, the Poles were the 

180
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
logicians most active in it, with Lukasiewicz as the 
chief protagonist. After early work on the propo­
sitional calculus, especially as presented in Prin- 
cipia Mathematica, he extended the method of truth­
tables to three-valued logic, and in a joint paper [60] 
with Tarski he explored many-valued logical systems. 
Lukasiewicz also introduced the Polish system of no­
tation for logic, in which certain conventions are em­
ployed to avoid the use of brackets or dots in formulae.
As in America, this burgeoning interest led to or­
ganizational consequences in the mid-1930s. The pe­
riodical Studia Philosophica was launched in 1936 to 
cover both logic and philosophy; it contained Tarski’s 
German translation of his treatise [87] on truth in 
its first volume. In 1939 Collectanea Logica was 
planned, with a first volume on proof, as a forum 
for publishing Polish logic; but the print-shop was 
destroyed in the bombing of Warsaw, and only off­
prints of some papers that had already been posted to 
foreign logicians and philosophers have survived.

Conclusions and comparisons
In this final section I compare the situation around 
1918 with that in 1939. I do so from seven points 
of view, the first three illustrating contrasts, the next 
three similarities.
(a) Philosophies of mathematics
In 1918 logicism was the most fully developed philos­
ophy of mathematics (and Principia Mathematica the 
best-known logical system), and it held the dominant 
position. But during the next decade intuitionism and 
especially formalism grew to prominence. The dis­
putes between the three schools gave the impression 
that they were both mutually inconsistent and also 
exhaustive of possible views. But during the 1930s 
this impression dissolved, as each school faced great 
difficulties or was revealed as inadequate in some 
ways.
A good impression of the three major philosophies 
of mathematics just prior to Godel’s 1931 theorem 
may be obtained from the papers by Carnap on logi- 
cism, Heyting on intuitionism, and von Neumann on 
formalism which were delivered to a Vienna Cir­
cle symposium on the foundations of mathematics 
in 1930. They were published in the Vienna Circle’s 
journal Erkenntnis (1931), 91-121; English transla­
tions are contained in [1], pp. 31-54.
From that time until today there was no domi­
nant philosophy of mathematics, or logical system. 
In particular, logicism, having been center stage in 
1918, was very much in the wings from the 1930s 
on. Hilbert was arguably the most influential figure 
during the inter-war years.
(b) The status of metalogic
In 1918 metalogic was little recognized as indepen­
dent of (object-level) logic. But the rise of metamath­
ematics with Hilbert, the work on model theory by 
Skolem and others, and the study of problems in se­
mantics (especially by the Poles) brought metalogic to 
the forefront of concern by the middle 1920s, where 
it has remained ever since.
(c) 
A logical revolution?
In 1918 logic was still an occasional interest, pur­
sued by a few figures mostly working in isolation. 
Much of the writing in logic of that time was still 
discursive stuff written by philosophers for philoso­
phers, with little symbolic content (although, in the 
work of the phenomenologist Husserl, much penetrat­
ing philosophical thought). But during the 1920s the 
subject was largely taken over by mathematicians, or 
at least by people with substantial mathematical train­
ing, and most major papers appeared in mathematical 
journals.
Thus, can we speak of a revolution in logic? The 
word revolution is used so often by historians of sci­
ence that I am disinclined to add myself to their 
voices; but we can certainly point to a substantial 
change of emphasis during this change of tradition. 
Among theories of scientific revolution, I am gen­
erally attracted to Kuhn’s theory of normal science; 
but in this case the theory does not seem to func­
tion well. There was not really a normal logic in the 
period before Frege, since various traditions were ac­
tive and only the Boolean algebra made substantial 
use of mathematics. Nor was there a new paradigm 
afterwards, since the controversies between logicism, 
formalism, and intuitionism, already nascent in the 
birth of the latter two doctrines in the 1900s, pre­
vented any of the three becoming a new ‘normal’ 
logic. Perhaps we can point to a change of paradigm in 
the much weaker, more general, sense ofa conversion 
from general considerations, often involving psychol­
ogy, to relatively specific concerns using mathemati­
cal techniques.
(d) Professional standing
There were signs of professionalisation, especially 
in America and Poland: the Association for Sym­
bolic Logic and its journal, Studia Philosophica, and 
so on. In addition, quite a number of text-books 
were published, espousing one or another of the new 

GRATTAN-GUINNESS: On the Development of Logics between the two World Wars
181
developments in logic, and I believe that logic was 
being taught at university level rather more widely in 
some countries. However, I would not wish to exag­
gerate the extent of professionalisation; even today, 
logic nestles under the wings of larger subjects. For 
example, there seems to have been little science pol­
icy applied to logic between the wars—though this 
was to change during the Second World War, when 
logic was applied to crypto-analysis and some logi­
cians became code-breakers.
(e) 
Non-classical logics
These logics did not progress very far between the 
wars; intuitionistic logic aroused the most attention. 
The interest in many-valued logics was rather slight 
(see [76]); even their bearing on quantum mechanics 
was apparently not given prominence until Birkhoff 
and von Neumann [2]. Modal logics seem also to have 
been rather unpopular (see [98]), although they have 
their origins in [56].
(f) 
Interest in the history of logic
Through the inter-war period interest in the history of 
logic, both ancient and relatively modern, maintained 
a steady low level. Of the major figures discussed 
above, Lukasiewicz showed the deepest historical 
concern and inspired among some of his compatri­
ots an interest that has continued to this day. Church’s 
bibliography [15] of symbolic logic, which graced 
the early pages of the Journal of Symbolic Logic, is 
an important historical aid. Editions of the works of 
Hilbert and Peirce (and also of Cantor and Dedekind) 
were prepared during the early 1930s.
(g) Mathematicians and logic
I mentioned in (e) that mathematicians largely took 
over logic in the 1920s. The main areas of contact 
between mathematics and logic were, of course, in 
the relationship between arithmetic, set theory, and 
predicate calculi. In addition, abstract algebra fur­
nished appropriate structures for aspects of model 
theory; and then there was lattice theory, which sprang 
to prominence in the 1930s after lying dormant in 
Schroder’s algebraic logic among other places (see 
[63]), and which furnished Birkhoff and von Neu­
mann with the quantum logic that I mentioned in (e).
One could certainly add other topics to this list; 
but nevertheless the main impression is that contacts 
between logic and mathematics—especially “work­
ing” mathematics—were rather scattered between the 
wars (and, indeed, both before and after that period). 
While mathematicians emphasize the need for rigor­
ous proofs and exact definitions, and take a general 
interest in problems of axiomatization and proof, they 
are often reluctant to study these “logical” questions 
explicitly; even the most exact mathematics rarely 
meets logicians’ standards (see [18]). A good exam­
ple is provided by the French, who always produce a 
remarkable number of great mathematicians but who 
show little interest in logic. Herbrand, by far the great­
est French logician between the wars, had difficulty 
in obtaining a panel to judge his doctoral thesis [37], 
and he published it in Poland.
The mathematician’s attitude to logic is best under­
stood by considering the position of set theory. It be­
came clear between the wars that the attempt of logi- 
cism to embrace set theory within logic was forlorn, 
although the line of division between the two fields 
was not clearly or definitively drawn. Now mathe­
maticians were interested in set theory much more 
than in logic; and even then they tended to draw on 
the set-topological aspects of the subject, as a source 
of definitions, techniques, and theorems, rather than 
the axiomatic set theory of Zermelo and others, where 
most of the contacts with logic were made. This sit­
uation is well exemplified by mathematical analysis, 
where set topology continued to play a significant 
role but axiomatic set theory and logic were largely 
absent—indeed, logic was much less prominent than 
it had been in the 1890s and 1900s, when Peano 
brought the new mathematical logic into analysis (at 
the time Peano’s group made Italy the leading country 
for mathematical logic, but Italian interest between 
the wars was at a low level) and Whitehead and Rus­
sell were working out the details of their logicist pro­
gramme. Ziehen made a perceptive judgement and 
prediction at the beginning of our period [100], with 
which most inter-war mathematicians and logicians 
could agree:
Set theory is no part of logic but its favored- 
daughter discipline, from whose inspirations it 
has many more results to await.

Dedekind’s Theorem: a/2 x == = 6&

Dedekind’s theorem
When the young Richard Dedekind, newly arrived at 
the Zurich Polytechnik (now the ETH), had to give 
for the first time the introductory calculus course, 
it had repercussions that were eventually to spread 
far beyond his class of students. He tells us in the 
introduction to his Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen 
[3] how his search for a satisfactory foundation for 
the calculus led him, on November 24, 1858, to his 
construction of the real numbers. (It was a Wednes­
day.) His immediate objective was to make precise 
and therefore, he argued, arithmetical the previously 
vague geometrical appeals to what we now call com­
pleteness, and every modern treatment develops lov­
ingly and in detail this crucial property of the real 
numbers. But in the body of his essay, which is still 
the most lucid available account of his construction, 
he points to an equally fundamental achievement. Af­
ter having described how to define addition, he goes 
on to say ([3], p. 22):
Just as addition is defined, so can the other oper­
ations of the so-called elementary arithmetic be 
defined, viz., the formation of differences, prod­
ucts, quotients, powers, roots, logarithms, and in 
this way we arrive at real proofs of theorems (as, 
e.g. V2 x 3= = V6), which to the best of my 
knowledge have never been established before.
He then elaborates this opinion in letters to Lipschitz 
of 1876 [3], and repeats and emphasizes it at the 
end of the introduction to his later Was sind und was 
sollen die Zahlen? (What Are Numbers and What 
Should They Be? is a better translation of this than 
the pusillanimous The Nature and Meaning of Num­
bers of [31]; and Dedekind throughout used the word 
Stetigkeit, continuity, to denote our completeness.)
This contribution is often slighted or even com­
pletely overlooked in descriptions of the reals, so my 
objective here is to celebrate his achievement by il­
lustrating some of the problems that lie in the way of 
some alternative interpretations of what I shall call 
Dedekind’s theorem, V2 x == v'6, and then dis­
cuss briefly the wider historical issue of the evolving 
idea of the real numbers since antiquity.
The illustrations will be of two sharply contrasted 
types. The first group will be arithmetical, in the spirit 
of Dedekind’s approach. For simplicity, consider the 
non-negative numbers. Take a half-infinite line, with 
left end-point labelled 0 and another distinguished 
point labelled 1, and somehow describe a labelling 
system for the points of the line. Abstracting from 
this, the set of real numbers will then be the set of all 
possible labels, so the labels will determine what we 
then conceive as the points of the line, and the prop­
erties of these labels will determine the geometrical 
properties of the line. Throughout, we suppose that 
we have available the integers and their arithmetic 
and order, but nothing more; and we want to try to 
extend this arithmetic and order structure to the set 
of all labels. Dedekind’s insight was to use cuts in the 
rational numbers as labels, and to see that the fea­
tures of arithmetic, order, and completeness are easy 
to define on these cuts.
Dedekind’s cogent objections to referring other 
than like this to the “points” of the line, or, in his 
terms, to “extensive magnitudes”, are that it is “not 
scientific” ([3], p. 1), since these points or magni­
tudes are “nowhere carefully defined” (p. 9; also see 
pp. 36-8); he calls his labels “numbers” and describes 
his procedure as “arithmetical”. My underlying his­
torical point in this first group of examples is to em­
phasize that carefully defined arithmetic—addition, 
185

Geometry, Topology and Foundations
multiplication, etc.—for models of the number line 
was far from obvious before Dedekind, and it would 
have been difficult to satisfy his requirement that “I 
demand that arithmetic should be developed out of 
itself” (p. 10). Behind these examples is also my dis­
sent from an opinion that is almost universally held 
but is rarely articulated, and it is another indication of 
Dedekind’s insight and lucidity that he brings it into 
the open:
According to my view, the notion of the ratio 
between two magnitudes of the same kind can 
be clearly defined only after the introduction of 
irrational numbers (p. 10 footnote; the transla­
tion has ‘two numbers’, but ‘two magnitudes’ is 
clearly meant by the German original).
The first examples (in Sections 2, 3, and 5) show that 
there is no difficulty in defining the idea of the ratio 
of, for example, the diagonal and side of a square, 
and describing the order structure on these kinds of 
ratios; the problems arise precisely in trying to do, 
and prove results about, their arithmetic. And the fi­
nal example (in Section 6) will abandon Dedekind’s 
programme and will formulate his theorem in a geo­
metrical model, Euclidean style, bypassing the need 
to talk about ratios.
The article [2] is highly recommended for details 
of Dedekind’s intellectual and personal life.
2 
The continued fraction 
representation
We use the so-called Euclidean algorithm (or anthy- 
phairesis) to generate a labelling system. Let X0 be 
any point on the half-infinite line, and write x0 for 
any line congruent to 0X0, x1 for 01. Now express
x0 = n0 x1 + x2 with x2 <x1 ,
x1 = n1 x2 + x3 with x3 <x2 , etc.,
where if at any stage there is no remainder, the pro­
cess terminates. (In some circumstances, it is more 
illuminating to conceive of the terminating case as 
finishing with an additional infinite term.) Thus far, 
this represents a process of decomposing 0X0 and 01 
into subintervals, and we can use the ni to label the 
point X0; let us write X0 =[n0,n1 ,n2 , ...]. Purely 
geometrical arguments show us that if /n denotes 
the side of the square equal to n times the square on 
01, then
72 =[1,2], 73 =[1,1,2], and /6 = [2, 2,4], 
where the bar denotes an indefinitely repeating period. 
(Details of three different kinds of such proofs are 
given in [6], Chapter 3.)
We now reverse this way of looking at things, and 
define the set of all real numbers to be the set of 
all such terminating or non-terminating sequences 
of integers [n0 ,n 1, n2, ... ], with ni G Z, ni > 1 if 
i > 1 and, if the sequence terminates with an nK for 
which K > 1, then nK > 2. Relaxing the description 
of the process to
x0 = n0x 1 + x2 with x2 < x 1, etc.
eliminates this last condition on terminating expan­
sions but introduces an innocent ambiguity,
[n0,n1,n2,... nK]=[n0,n1,n2,...nK-1,1] 
where K > 0, and if K > 1 then nK > 2.
The order structure is easily described: lexicographic 
in the even-indexed terms, and reverse lexicographic 
in the odd-indexed terms, when terminating expan­
sions have been put in standard notation (nK > 2) 
with an infinite term adjoined. The final ingredient for 
the statement of Dedekind’s theorem is a description 
of multiplication, but here a classic account of contin­
ued fractions describes how the situation is generally 
perceived ([8], p. 20):
For continued fractions there are no practi­
cally applicable rules for arithmetical opera­
tions; even the problem of finding the continued 
fraction for a sum from the continued fractions 
representing the addends is exceedingly compli­
cated, and unworkable in computational prac­
tice.
In fact, there is a simple algorithm for arithmetic, an 
elaboration of the procedure for evaluating the con- 
vergents, discovered in the 1970s by R. W. Gosper 
but never published conventionally by him! It is de­
scribed in [6], pp. 114-116 and 354-360, where it is 
illustrated for the evaluation of
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,... ] x [1, 2,1, 2,1, 2,1,... ]
= [2,2,4,2,4,...].
But I cannot see how to go on to construct a direct 
proof of Dedekind’s theorem using it.
I have argued (see [6]) that anthyphairesis may have 
been one of the early Greek ways of defining ratio, 
but anybody who knows anything about continued 
fractions would suspect that this approach to the real 

FOWLER: Dedekind’s Theorem: /2 x /3 = /6
187
numbers and Dedekind’s theorem might be unfruitful. 
Let us now try a much more promising and more 
familiar approach.
3 
The decimal representation
Again, write x0 for any line congruent to 0X0 , x1 for 
01, and
x0 = n0x1 + x2 with x2 <x1 
10x2 = n1x1 + x3 with x3 <x1 
10x3 = n2 x1 + x4 with x4 <x1
Clearly 0 < ni < 9 if i > 1; and we have constructed 
a decimal expansion of x, traditionally written x = 
no .ni n2n3 • • • .
There is again no difficulty in describing the order 
structure, and sono difficulty in using decimal expan­
sions to describe the ordered set of real numbers. But 
once again we have problems with arithmetic. Un­
der pressure from calculations like 9 + 9 and 3 x 3, 
expressed decimally, we are led to consider decimal 
expansions ending in strings of nines and allow iden­
tities like 0.999 ... = 1.000 ...... (These do not arise
from the algorithm as described above, but can occur 
if we modify it to
x0 = n0x1 + x2 with x2 < x1 , etc.,
and we now must decide whether to allow ni =10or 
not.) This opens Pandora’s box, letting out the con­
fusion of non-unique representations and indefinitely 
long carry, but it is difficult to conceive of any kind 
of decimal manipulation without these complicating 
features in some form or another.
Many mathematicians have a touching and naive 
belief that arithmetical operations on decimals pose 
no problems; or they pretend to believe this, as in 
some circumstances the most scrupulously honest 
among us may sometimes pretend to believe in Fa­
ther Christmas (see, e.g., [1], pp. 26, 47); or per­
haps they have never considered the question to be 
problematic.
Of course arithmetic with terminating decimal ex­
pansions is straightforward, since itis only arithmetic 
in Z, represented decimally and slightly modified to 
accommodate the notation of the decimal point. But 
an example first shown to me by Christopher Zeeman 
shows how we again encounter problems long before 
we reach Dedekind’s theorem. Let those who believe 
that an algorithm for decimal multiplication exists use 
it to evaluate the first non-zero digit of the expansion 
of the product of non-terminating periodic numbers
1.222...x0.818181......
Is the answer 9, or 1, or 9 or 1? (For more discussion 
and another surprising example of Zeeman’s, see 
[5].) The analogous problem with Gosper’s algorithm 
for continued fraction arithmetic also concerns 
terminating expansions: in evaluating expressions 
like v'2 x V2, the output from the algorithm will 
be of the form [2,n1] or [1, 1,n2], where n1 and n2 
increase indefinitely as the algorithm struggles to 
evaluate them and move on to the next term. In fact, 
n1 and n2 here are infinite.
There is some evidence that mathematicians of the 
early nineteenth century and before, and especially 
those who were moving towards the developing £ - 6 
arithmetized analysis, were aware of the fundamen­
tal and messy problems with decimal arithmetic. For 
example, Cauchy’s celebrated Cours d’Analyse has a 
long appended Note 1 (“Sur la theorie des quantites 
positives et negatives”) in which he defines arithmeti­
cal operations on ‘numbers’ (also called ‘quantities’) 
in rather vague terms of manipulations of rational ap­
proximations; whilst in its Note 3 (“Sur la resolution 
numerique des equations”), he describes a proof of 
the intermediate value theorem in terms of what is, in 
effect, a decimal algorithm, though expressed there 
to any base. But, vague though his account often is, 
Cauchy does not fudge the issue by describing arith­
metic in terms of terminating decimal expansions, 
and then pretend that he has described arithmetic in 
general.
Many Babylonian clay tablets containing arith­
metical tables and problems of some sophistication 
expressed throughout to base 60, and which date 
from around 2000 B.C. onwards, have been found 
and edited. Division appears to have been handled 
by reciprocation followed by multiplication; but most 
of the reciprocal tables only contain entries for those 
numbers whose reciprocals terminate (i.e., numbers 
whose only factors are 2, 3 and 5). So Babylo­
nian mathematicians also seem to have had a proper 
caution about the problem of arithmetic with non­
terminating radix fractions.
4 
The unit fraction 
representation
Egyptian mathematics tends to be viewed with 
amazement by mathematicians of today because of 
its practice of expressing rational numbers as sums of 

188
Geometry, Topology and Foundations
different unit fractions:
= n 0 + — + — + 
n1 
n2
1
, 
nK
p 
q
with 1 < n 1 < n2 < • • • <nK.
I do not think that I need to belabor the opinion that 
this makes a very unpromising base on which to at­
tempt to state, let alone prove, Dedekind’s theorem. 
What does need belaboring is that this same practice 
is found throughout Greek texts; see [6], Chapter 7 
for details, and for a discussion of the evidence that 
leads me to argue that we have no good grounds for ar­
guing that early Greek mathematics and commercial 
practice had anything corresponding to our common 
fractions p/q and their arithmetic! Unit fraction ex­
pressions are then found in Greek, Arabic, and Italian 
texts up to the sixteenth century; for example, astro­
nomical texts continue to use the Egypto-Greek unit 
fractions side-by-side with the Babylonian sexagesi­
mal numbers.
We can, incidentally, generate a class of unit frac­
tion expansions using another variant of the subtrac­
tion algorithm. Write
1
+----------------
n1n2n3
x0 = n0 x1 + x2
with x2 < x1,
x1 = n1 x2 + x3
with x3 < x2,
x2 = n2 x3 + x4
with x4 < x3 , etc
We then get
x0 
1 
1
x 1 
n 0 n 1 
n 1 n 2
Or, by overshooting from the second step onwards,
x1 = n1 x2 - x3 with x3 <x2 , etc.,
we can eliminate all the negative signs. While there 
is absolutely no evidence that anyone in antiquity 
used any such algorithm, similar kinds of expressions 
do appear in Arabic mathematics from the twelfth 
century onwards. They were described by Fibonacci 
in his Liber Abaci of 1202, and then persisted up to 
the sixteenth century, known as the practica Italiano. 
They correspond to ascending continued fractions, 
and sometimes have more general numerators:
m1 
m2 
m3
n 0 +-------- 1----------- 1-------------- + • • •
n1 
n1 n2 
n1 n2 n3
= n0 +
m2
m1 +
+ m 3 +-----
n 3
n 2
n 1
though occasionally there is an additional complica­
tion of numerators that build up in a similar way to the 
m1m2 
m1m2m3
n1n2 
n1n2n3
denominators, and so do not correspond as closely to 
continued fractions. In their notation,
m3m2m1
------------(a variant of practica Italiano)
n3n2n1
m1 
= — + 
n1
and all such expressions are usually written back­
wards like this, presumably a vestige of their Arabic 
origins.
Lagrange, in [10], gave a unified treatment of the 
three subtraction algorithms I have described so far, 
and others, expressed in terms of approximations. 
He noted the connection of the first with continued 
fractions and ended with an oblique reference to as­
cending continued fractions, which he attributed to 
Lambert. Ascending continued fractions appear spo­
radically thereafter, but they are much more simply 
handled in terms of series.
5 
The Eudoxian representation
I start with the celebrated Elements V, Definition 5, 
attributed to Eudoxus:
[Four] magnitudes are said to be in the same 
ratio, the first to the second and the third to the 
fourth, when, if any equi-multiples whatever be 
taken of the first and third, and any whatever of 
the second and fourth, the former equi-multiples 
alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike fall short 
of, the latter equi-multiples respectively taken in 
corresponding order.
and a passage from Heath’s note on this that has 
spawned or reinforced endless confusion:
Max Simon remarks (Euclid und die sechs 
planimetrischen Bucher, p. 110), after Zeuthen, 
that Euclid’s definition of equal ratios is word for 
word the same as Weierstrass’ definition of equal 
numbers. So far from agreeing in the usual view 
that the Greeks saw in the irrational no number, 
Simon thinks it is clear from Book V that they 
possessed a notion of number in all its gener­
ality as clearly defined as, nay almost identical 
with, Weierstrass’ conception of it. Certain it is 
that there is an exact correspondence, almost co­
incidence, between Euclid’s definition of equal 
ratios and the modern theory of irrationals due 
to Dedekind ([4], Vol. ii, p. 124).
The first two sentences of this second quotation 
represent what is, for me, an ugly disease of much 

FOWLER: Dedekind’s Theorem: /2 x /3 = /6
189
scholarship: the repetition of incorrect, misleading, or 
meaningless stereotyped verbal formulae backed up 
by a liturgical parade of names. As far as I am aware, 
Weierstrass’ description of number looks nothing like 
Elements V, Def. 5; and, far from finding “numbers 
in all generality” in the Elements, the consensus of 
serious investigations of the Elements uncovers little 
or no trace there of proto-real numbers; indeed, almost 
the only numbers found there are the positive integers, 
of which the unit has an ambiguous status.
As remarked in the previous section, I go even fur­
ther and argue, in [6], Chapter 7, that we find nowhere 
in early Greek mathematics (i.e., up to and including 
Archimedes) any convincing evidence for an under­
standing of the rational numbers, such as we derive 
from manipulations of common fractions p/q. So, as 
concerns the final sentence, while we can now eas­
ily translate V, Def. 5 into Dedekind’s definition of a 
cut, the mathematical contexts of the two definitions 
are even more strikingly different than the correspon­
dence between their formulations.
Elements V is about proportionality, the equiva­
lence relation of equality between ratios. If, as here, 
we are only given this equivalence relation, we can 
now play the formal trick of taking the equivalence 
classes it defines, and refer to them as ratios; but this 
is a late nineteenth-century device, at the earliest. 
However, behind Book V of the Elements, especially 
when set in the context of Eudoxus’ interest in cycli­
cal calendars (for more details of this and what fol­
lows below, see the discussion in [6], pp. 121-130), 
we may be able to detect another procedure that we 
could try to use to describe the set of reals. This will 
involve leaving the subtraction algorithms of the pre­
vious examples and passing to addition.
Each point x of the positive line will gen­
erate a characteristic pattern in the way the 
points x, 2x, 3x,... interlace with the integer points 
1, 2, 3,  
We can describe this, for example by
specifying how many points of {x, 2x, 3x,...} lie in 
[0, 1), how many in [1, 2), etc. The labels this gener­
ates for the rational points of the line were described, 
in the 1870s, by Christoffel and H. J. S. Smith, and 
their descriptions can be extended to generate the la­
bels for /n.
Abstracting from this, we may describe the set 
of reals to be all possible patterns that arise in this 
way. First, we need to characterize these patterns; 
then, define the order structure on them; finally, de­
fine arithmetic with them. The first problem is solved 
by an ingenious algorithm of Zeeman, closely related 
to the idea of rotation numbers; see [11] and [12].
Figure 1. Pythagoras’ theorem
The order structure is described in Elements V, Def­
inition 7. But I have no idea if any direct defini­
tion of their arithmetic is known or accessible. So, 
once again, and at yet another place, the attempt to 
formulate and prove Dedekind’s theorem is unsuc­
cessful.
6 A geometrical description
I finish this cycle of formulations of Dedekind’s the­
orem with a purely geometrical version, based on a 
naive model of Euclidean geometry in which figures 
are manipulated by congruence transformations and 
equality is interpreted in terms of scissors-and-paste 
operations. This goes against Dedekind’s approach, 
but it corresponds to what is found in much, though 
not all, of Euclid’s Elements. For example, the so- 
called Pythagoras’ theorem is a statement about de­
composing and reassembling squares, and Fig. 1 gives 
a proof which, though not found in the Elements, may 
have been excised from between Propositions 8 and 
9 of Book II.
We again make a geometrical definition of /n as 
the side ofa square equal to n concatenated copies of 
the unit square; this can be constructed, for example, 
by making repeated use of Pythagoras’ theorem, as in 
Fig. 2. We now define multiplication geometrically: if 
n and m denote natural numbers, a and b lines, and A 
and B regions in the plane, then na or nA will denote 
n concatenated copies of a or A; a.b will denote 
the rectangle with adjacent sides a and b; a.B will

theorem.

denote the rectangular prism with base B and height 
a; and A.B is not defined. Again this corresponds to 
what we find in the Elements. With these definitions, 
our original version of Dedekind’s theorem is not 
well-posed—a rectangle cannot be compared with a 
line—but we can immediately adjust its formulation 
to V2-V3 = V6 ■ 1.
A proof will now consist of an argument about a 
figure involving these two rectangles. Many different 
figures are possible; Fig. 2 illustrates one straightfor­
ward construction, using nothing more than has been 
described above; and the equality of the rectangles 
a/2a/3 and . 1 therein will be equivalent to the 
collinearity of0,Pand Q. (This is the easy converse 
of Elements I, 43, which shows that, in Fig. 3, the 
shaded parallelograms are equal.) Curiously, a proof 
now requires arguments based on similarity—that the 
construction of P, starting from the line 01, is the 
same as the construction of Q, starting from 0Pa/2, 
and hence the triangles 0PV3 and 0Q/6 are simi- 
lar—and so seems to depend on the Euclidean nature 
of the geometry. I remark, in passing, that Euclid’s 
version of the parallel postulate is not actually ex­
pressed in terms of parallels, but is closer to express­
ing the possibility of constructing similar triangles of 
any given size.
I know ofno explicit reference to any formulation 
of Dedekind’s theorem in early Greek mathematics; 
whether or not it is there implicitly is a delicate his­
torical matter.
7 Mathematics and the real
numbers
Mathematical thinking today is built on our intuitions 
of the real numbers, but I have tried here to illustrate 
how it may sometimes distort the past when we inter­
pret their mathematics in these terms. Here are some 
related opinions about other related past mathemati­
cal developments:
(a) Early Greek mathematics, up to the time of 
Archimedes, does not seem to be arithmetized. How­
ever it is interpreted arithmetically thereafter, for ex­
ample in the metrical geometry of Heron and the as­
tronomy of Ptolemy, and many modern descriptions 
are now set against some assumed background of a 
developing idea of rational and real numbers, For ex­
ample, the lurid stories of the discovery and effect of 
incommensurability, which is so damaging to a naive 
arithmetical mathematics based on the rationals, are 
found in later commentators but are surprisingly ab­
sent from our earlier evidence; they may, I think, be 
part of a later overlay. (There is a discussion of the 
historical evidence concerning the discovery of in­
commensurability in [6], 294-308.)
(b) Babylonian mathematics and astronomy is 
highly arithmetized, but it does not have the deductive 
structure we now associate with Greek and our math­
ematics. One possibly fruitful line of interpretation, 
which I have not seen explored anywhere, might be 
to develop the distinction proposed, by Knuth [9], be­
tween mathematical and algorithmic thinking, and see 
ifit applies to this Babylonian material, especially the 
later Babylonian astronomy of the Seleucid period. In 
the grandest sweep of history, is it possible that the 
paradigm of deductive mathematics, which has dom­
inated our view since the fourth century BC, may 
have run its course, and may now be giving way to an 
older algorithmic style, which is now flourishing in a 
changed environment of automatic computation, the 
appeal of experimental mathematics, economic and 
political pressures, shifts in the school curriculum, 
and the increasing specialization and inaccessibility 
of much of mathematics today?
(c) Western mathematics since the seventeenth cen­
tury has owed a lot of its power to the way it has 
been successfully and comprehensively arithmeti­
cal, though it managed to ignore the basic prob­
lems with a precise description of its underlying 
arithmetic until the nineteenth century. (This simple 
picture must be filled in with details of the excur­
sions into infinitesimal and infinite numbers and non­
standard analysis, which fit well with the approach 
to arithmetical models of the line I described in Sec­
tion 1, and the mathematico-algorithmic hybrid of 
constructive mathematics.) I believe that the dramatic 
and explosive growth of symbolism in the seven­
teenth century—for there is no symbolism before 
about 1600, apart from numerals and a few things 
that are better described as abbreviations—may be 
connected with a new fluency in arithmetized think­
ing, which itself may owe a lot to the populariza­
tion of decimal fractions at the end of the fifteenth 
century. Stevin, for example, was a thorough-going 
arithmetizer: he published, in 1585, the first popu­
larization of decimal fractions in the West (both in 
Dutch, De Thiende, and French, La Disme); in 1594, 

FOWLER: Dedekind’s Theorem: /2 x /3 = /6
191
he described an algorithm for finding the decimal 
expansion of the root of any polynomial, the same 
algorithm we find later in Cauchy’s proof of the inter­
mediate value theorem to which I referred above; and 
he argued vigorously for an arithmetical understand­
ing of the Elements, including its notorious Book X. 
But this is another story, part of which is described 
in [7].

Afterword
Halsted’s review is of Volume VII of Gauss’s Werke, but in Volume VIII, the editors published 
Gauss’s manuscript material on non-Euclidean geometry. These show that Gauss anticipated much 
of the work of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, as well as of Schweikart. The existence of these materials 
does not, however, challenge Halsted’s conclusion that Gauss had no influence on the work of any 
of these men. Roberto Bonola’s Non-Euclidean Geometry [2] is still a good source for details on 
Gauss’s work; the English edition also contains Halsted’s translations of the fundamental articles on 
non-Euclidean geometry by Bolyai and Lobachevsky.
More recent works on the history of non-Euclidean geometry include Jeremy Gray’s Ideas of 
Space: Euclidean, non-Euclidean and Relativistic [10] and Janos Bolyai, Non-euclidean Geometry 
and the Nature of Space [11] and B. A. Rosenfeld’s A History of Non-Euclidean Geometry [17]. The 
latter work, in particular, deals in great detail with the work of “certain Arabs and Persians” that 
Lewis skips over. In fact, it is now clear that some of the Islamic work on the parallel postulate was 
read in Europe in the seventeenth century and affected the European developments on the subject. 
Jeremy Gray has also written a historically-based textbook in geometry, Worlds out of Nothing: A 
Course in the History of Geometry in the 19th Century [12], that covers in detail not only non- 
Euclidean geometry but also projective geometry and many other topics. Julian Lowell Coolidge 
himself expanded on his article on projective geometry in A History of Geometrical Methods [4], 
first published in 1940.
A general history of point-set topology is Jerome Manheim’s The Genesis of Point-Set Topology 
[15], which also contains a history of set theory in its relationship with topology. As to algebraic 
topology, the most detailed history is Jean Dieudonne’s A History of Algebraic and Differential 
Topology, 1900-1960 [8], in which the author attempts to use modern terminology to represent older 
ideas and concentrates heavily on the algebraic side of the story. For the prehistory of homotopy 
theory, see R. Van den Eynde’s article [18]; this article is one of forty in I. M. James’s History of 
Topology [13], a work that covers most of the major topics in the field.
An article closely related to Hilton’s is by Solomon Lefschetz [14], originally published in 1970 
and reprinted in James’s volume. Another history of the homology concept is by Maja Bollinger [1]. 
Auguste Dick’s biography, Emmy Noether, 1882-1935 [7] contains details of Noether’s influence 
on the development of algebraic topology in Gottingen. It also reproduces Pavel Sergeiivich Alek­
sandrov’s address in her memory that describes some of the atmosphere there in the 1930s. Hassler 
Whitney has written on the international topology conference in Moscow in 1935 [19], and Hilton 
mentions that, in 1988, Leopold Vietoris was still alive. In fact, Vietoris lived until 2002, dying at 
the age of 110!

W. S. Contro [5] covers some of the same ground as H. C. Kennedy, as he considers both Pasch’s 
and Peano’s approaches to axiomatization. Joseph Brent has written an excellent biography of 
Charles Sanders Peirce: Charles Sanders Peirce: A Life [3], which includes information on his 
logical work, and Peirce also appears in the masterful volume of Karen Parshall and David Rowe: 
The Emergence of the American Mathematical Research Community, 1876-1900: J. J. Sylvester, 
Felix Klein, and E. H. Moore [16]. Parshall and Rowe in particular deal with Peirce’s tenure at Johns 
Hopkins University, where he lectured on logic for several years.
For more information on logic, a good source, with many bibliographic references, is Part 5 of Ivor 
Grattan-Guinness’s Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical

Algebra and
Number Theory


Foreword
Algebra in 1800 meant the solving of equations. By 1900, the term was beginning to encompass the 
study of various mathematical structures—sets of elements with well-defined operations, satisfying 
certain specified axioms—and by the 1930s, under the influence of Emmy Noether, this change was 
complete. This chapter explores some aspects of this change in the notion of algebra over that time 
period.
The nineteenth century also saw a change in number theory, not so much in the subject matter 
but in the methods of proof. From the inception of number theory, one proved results about positive 
integers by using positive integers. But in the nineteenth century, mathematicians generalized their 
results by beginning to look at other “numbers”, beginning with the Gaussian integers. Then, in a 
more striking change, they began to consider proofs about numbers using techniques from real and 
complex analysis. Several articles in this chapter explore these changes.
The first two articles in this chapter discuss aspects of the history of quaternions, the first algebraic 
system to be studied that did not satisfy the commutative law. B. L. van der Waerden tells the story 
of Hamilton’s discovery of the quaternions, beginning with his search for a law of multiplication for 
triples (or vectors in three-dimensional space) that would generalize the law of multiplication for 
complex numbers, thought of as pairs or as vectors in two-dimensional space. Simon Altmann then 
continues the story, showing how over many years Hamilton attempted to interpret his quaternions 
in terms of rotations in space. Ultimately, Hamilton failed in this attempt, and the reasons were 
only elucidated by Olinde Rodrigues, a French banker whose contributions to mathematics are little 
known.
The first algebraic concept to be fully abstracted was that of a group. Two articles are devoted to 
the beginnings of that abstract theory. In the first, Josephine Burns considers the work of Augustin 
Cauchy in developing some of the basic concepts of the theory of groups, although always in 
the context of permutation groups. Cauchy not only wrote out all the elements (in the form of 
permutations) of a number of important groups, but also proved one of the first theorems on the way 
to the Sylow theorems, that if m is the order of a group and p any prime that divides m, then the 
group contains an element of order p.
Israel Kleiner surveys the history of group theory, tracing its roots to four areas: the solving 
of equations, especially the fundamental work of Lagrange; number theory, beginning with Carl 
Friederich Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae; geometry, with the ideas of Felix Klein; and finally, 
analysis, including especially the work of Sophus Lie. Kleiner then continues with the work of 
Cauchy, Galois and others in studying permutation groups in detail, the work of Kronecker in 
developing what is now called the fundamental theorem of Abelian groups, and the work of Klein and 
Lie in investigating the theory of transformations. Kleiner finally looks at the eventual emergence 
197

Algebra and Number Theory
of abstraction in group theory, beginning in the 1880s, although with some of this abstraction 
accomplished “prematurely” by Arthur Cayley.
One particular aspect of finite group theory that has been important of late is the theory of 
finite simple groups. In an article published in 1976, Gallian takes us through the work on their 
classification up to that time. Interestingly, at the time he wrote, new sporadic groups had recently 
been discovered, and it was not clear whether such groups would continue to appear. As we know 
now, the sporadic groups discovered by the mid-1970s were the last ones, and the classification of 
finite simple groups was complete by the early 1980s.
Another field of algebra that was studied in detail in the nineteenth century was linear algebra, al­
though it was not axiomatized until the twentieth century. But Desmond Fearnley-Sander argues that 
the true creator of this subject was Hermann Grassmann, in his two versions of the Ausdehnungslehre 
(1844 and 1862). We see how Grassmann not only developed the theory of finite-dimensional vector 
spaces and proved most of the important theorems, but also developed what we now call the exterior 
algebra of a vector space, a concept that was applied at the end of the nineteenth century to develop 
the theory of differential forms. Fearnley-Sander also shows how Grassmann was successful in one 
of his basic aims: providing an easy-to-use symbolic language for geometry.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae discussed the 
basics of number theory, not only giving a proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity, but also 
introducing various new concepts that provided early examples of groups and matrices. Gauss’s 
study of higher reciprocity laws soon led to his study of the Gaussian integers, complex numbers of 
the form a + bi where a and b are ordinary integers. Attempts to generalize the properties of these 
integers to integers in other number fields led Ernst Kummer to the realization that some of the most 
important of these properties, such as unique factorization, fail to hold. The search to recover this 
property is discussed by Israel Kleiner, as he summarizes the work of Gauss and Kummer and also 
considers in detail Richard Dedekind’s invention of the theory of ideals. Reinhard Laubenbacher and 
David Pengelley consider Gotthold Eisenstein’s geometric proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity, 
a result proved by Gauss in the Disquisitiones and several times later.
The next three articles deal with aspects of the theory of numbers, especially the change in the 
nature of proof. First, Charles Small surveys the history of Waring’s problem, which asks whether for 
each exponent k>1,there is an integer g(k) such that every positive integer can be expressed as the 
sum of at most g(k) kth powers. Waring himself claimed that g(2) = 4, g(3) = 9, and g(4) = 19. 
Next, Larry Goldstein surveys the history of the prime number theorem, that the number n (x) of 
prime numbers not exceeding x can be approximated by the function x/ ln(x). It was Legendre who 
first conjectured a result of this sort, and it was Gauss who collected extensive numerical data to 
come up with his own similar conjecture. Later on, Riemann showed that the prime number theorem 
was closely related to what became known as the Riemann hypothesis, that all the non-trivial zeros 
of the Riemann zeta function have real part equal to 1 .As it turned out, however, the truth of 
the Riemann hypothesis was not necessary for a proof of the prime number theorem, which was 
accomplished by Hadamard and de la Vallee Poussin in 1896. Their proofs, and other work related 
to the prime number theorem, are discussed in detail in the article by Paul Bateman and Harold 
Diamond.
One of the major successes of twentieth-century number theory was the proof of Fermat’s last 
theorem, the famous conjecture that xn + yn = zn has no non-trivial integer solutions for n> 2. 
Fernando Gouvea surveys Andrew Wiles’s initial announced proof of this result, a proof announced

Interspersed among the historical articles in this chapter are four primarily biographical articles. 
First, we have the paper by Karen Parshall and Eugene Seneta on J. J. Sylvester, concentrating mostly 
on his efforts to build an international reputation for himself. Then, we have Tony Rothman’s article 
on Evariste Galois, in which the author debunks many of the myths surrounding the last few years 
of Galois’s life and gives his own hypothesis about the fatal duel. Next is an article by G. H. Hardy 
on Ramanujan, discussing the close relationship between the two and his opinions on the Indian 
mathematician’s brilliance. The chapter also includes Clark Kimberling’s biographical sketch of 
Emmy Noether, containing long quotations from several people—notably Pavel Alexandroff—who 
wrote memorials to her after her death.

Hamilton’s Discovery of Quaternions
B. L. VAN DER WAERDEN
Mathematics Magazine 49 (1976), 227-234
Introduction
The ordinary complex numbers a + ib (or, as they 
were formerly written, a + ^/—1) are added and 
multiplied according to definite rules. The rule for 
multiplication reads as follows:
First multiply according to the rules of high 
school algebra:
(a + ib)(c + id)=ac + adi + bci + bdi2
and then replace i2 by -1:
(a + ib)(c + id) = (ac -bd)+(ad + bc)i.
Complex numbers can also be defined as couples 
(a, b). The product of two couples (a, b) and (c, d) 
is defined as the couple (ac -bd, ad + bc). The cou­
ple (1, 0) is called 1, the couple (0, 1) is called i. Then 
we also have the result
i2 = (0, 1)(0, 1) = (-1, 0) = -1.
By means of this definition the imaginary unit i = 
—11 loses all of its mystery: i is simply the couple 
(0, 1).
The quaternions a + bi + cj + dk which William 
Rowan Hamilton discovered on the 16th of October 
1843, are multiplied according to fixed rules, in anal­
ogy to the complex numbers; that is to say:
i2 = j2 = k2 = -1,
ij = k, jk = i, ki = j, 
ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j.
They can also be defined as quadruples (a, b, c, d). 
Quaternions form a division algebra; that is, they 
cannot only be added, subtracted, and multiplied, but 
also divided (excluding division by zero). All rules of 
calculation of high school school algebra hold; only 
the commutative law AB = BA does not hold since 
ij is not the same as ji.
How did Hamilton arrive at these multiplication 
rules? What was his problem and how did he find 
the solution? We are accurately informed about these 
matters in documents and papers which appear in the 
third volume of Hamilton’s collected Mathematical 
Papers [3]:
1. Through an entry in Hamilton’s Note Book dated 
16 October 1843 ([3], pp. 103-105);
2. Through a letter to John Graves of the 17th of 
October 1843 ([3], pp. 106-110);
3. Through a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal 
Irish Academy 2 (1844), 424-434, presented on 
the 13th of November 1843 ([3], pp. 111-116);
4. Through the detailed Preface to Hamilton’s Lec­
tures on Quaternions, dated June 1853 ([3], 
pp. 117-155, in particular, pp. 142-144);
5. Through a letter to his son Archibald which Hamil­
ton wrote shortly before his death, that is shortly 
before the 2nd of September 1865 ([3], pp. xv- 
xvi).
We can follow exactly each of Hamilton’s steps of 
thought through all of these documents. This is a rare 
occurrence in which we can observe what flashed 
across the mind of a mathematician as he posed the 
problem, as he approached the solution step by step, 
and then through a lightning stroke so modified the 
problem that it became solvable.

quadratic equations. They were called “impossible 
solutions” or numeri surdi: absurd numbers. The neg­
ative numbers too were called “impossible.” Cardan 
used numbers A + V—B in the solution of equa­
tions of the third degree in the casus irreducibilis in 
which all three roots are real. Bombelli showed that 
it was possible to calculate with expressions such as 
A + V—B without contradiction, but he did not like 
them: he called them “sophistical” and apparently 
without value. The expression “imaginary number” 
stems from Descartes.
Euler had no scruples about operating altogether 
freely with complex numbers. He proposed formulas 
such as
cos a = 1(eia + ').
The geometric representation of complex numbers as 
vectors or as points in a plane stems from Argand 
(1813), Warren (1828) and Gauss (1832).
The first named, Argand, defined the complex num­
bers as directed segments in the plane. He took the 
basis vectors 1 and i as mutually perpendicular unit 
vectors. Addition is the usual vector addition, with 
which Newton made us familiar (the parallelogram 
law of velocities or of forces). The length ofa vector 
was denoted at that time by the term modulus, the 
angle of the vector with the positive x-axis as the 
argument of the complex number. Multiplication of 
complex numbers, according to Argand, then takes 
place so that the moduli are multiplied and the argu­
ments are added. Independently of Argand, Warren 
and Gauss also represented complex numbers geo­
metrically and interpreted their addition and multi­
plication geometrically.
“Papa, can you multiply triples?”
Hamilton knew and used the geometric representa­
tion of complex numbers. In his published papers, 
however, he emphasized the definition of complex 
numbers as the couple (a, b) which followed definite 
rules for addition and multiplication. Related to that, 
Hamilton posed this problem to himself:
To find how number-triplets (a, b, c) are to be 
multiplied in analogy to couples (a, b).
For a long time Hamilton had hoped to discover the 
multiplication rule for triplets, as he himself stated. 
But in October 1843 this hope became much stronger 
and more serious. He put it this way in a letter to his 
son Archibald ([3], p. xv):
the desire to discover the law of multiplication 
of triplets regained with me a certain strength 
and earnestness.....
In analogy to the complex numbers a + ib, Hamil­
ton wrote his triplets as a + bi + cj . He represented 
his unit vectors 1,i,j as mutually perpendicular “di­
rected segments” of unit length in space. Later Hamil­
ton himself used the word vector, which I also shall 
use in the following. Hamilton then sought to rep­
resent products such as (a + bi + cj)(x + yi + zj) 
again as vectors in the same space. He required, first, 
that it be possible to multiply out term by term; and 
second, that the length of the product of the vectors 
be equal to the product of the lengths. This latter rule 
was called the law of the moduli by Hamilton.
Today we know that the two requirements of Hamil­
ton can be fulfilled only in spaces of dimensions 1, 
2, 4 and 8; this was proved by Hurwitz [5]. Therefore 
Hamilton’s attempt in three dimensions had to fail. 
His profound idea was to continue to 4 dimensions, 
since all of his attempts in 3 dimensions failed to 
reach the goal.
In the previously mentioned letter to his son, 
Hamilton wrote about his first attempt:
Every morning in the early part of the above­
cited month [October 1843], on my coming 
down to breakfast, your brother William Edwin 
and yourself used to ask me, “Well, Papa, can 
you multiply triplets?” Whereto I was always 
obliged to reply, with a sad shake of the head, 
“No, I can only add and subtract them.”
From the other documents we learn more precisely 
about Hamilton’s first attempts. To fulfill the law of 
the moduli, at least for the complex numbers a + 
ib, Hamilton set ii = —1, as for ordinary complex 
numbers, and similarly so that the law would also hold 
for the numbers a + cj, jj = —1. But what was ij 
and what was ji? At first Hamilton assumed ij = ji 
and calculated as follows:
(a +ib+jc)(x + iy +jz) 
=(ax — by — cz) + i(ay + bx) 
+ j (az + cx)+ij (bz + cy).
Now, he asked, what is one to do with ij ? Will it have 
the form a + pi + 77 ?
First attempt: The square of ij had to be 1, since 
i2 = —1 and j 2 = —1. Therefore, wrote Hamilton, 
in this attempt one would have to choose ij =1or 
ij = —1. But in neither of these two cases will the 
law of the moduli be fulfilled, as calculation shows.

202
Algebra and Number Theory
Second attempt: Hamilton considered the simplest 
case
(a + ib + jc)2
= a2 - b2 - c2 + 2iab + 2jac + 2ijbc.
Then he calculated the sum of the squares of the 
coefficients of 1,i, and j on the right-hand side and 
found
(a2 - b2 - c2)2 + (2ab)2 + (2ac)2 
= (a2+ b2+ c2)2 .
Therefore, he said, the product rule is fulfilled if 
we set ij =0. And further: if we pass a plane through 
the points 0, 1 and a + ib + jc, then the construction 
of the product according to Argand and Warren will 
hold in this plane: the vector (a + bi + cf)2 lies in 
the same plane and the angle which this vector makes 
with the vector 1 is twice as large as the angle between 
the vectors a + bi + cj and 1. Hamilton verified this 
by computing the tangents of the two angles.
Third attempt: Hamilton reports that the assump­
tion ij =0, which he made in the second attempt, 
subsequently did not appear to be quite right to him. 
He writes in the letter to Graves ([3], p. 107):
Behold me therefore tempted for a moment to 
fancy that ij =0. But this seemed odd and un­
comfortable, and I perceived that the same sup­
pression of the term which was de trop might 
be attained by assuming what seemed to me less 
harsh, namely that ji = -ij. I made therefore 
ij = k, ji = -k, reserving to myself to inquire 
whether k was 0 or not.
Hamilton was entirely right in giving up the assump­
tion ij = 0 and taking instead ij = -ji. For example, 
ifij =0, then the modulus of the product ij would be 
zero, which would contradict the law of the moduli.
Fourth attempt: Somewhat more generally, Hamil­
ton multiplied a + ib + jc and x + ib + jc. In this 
case the two segments which are to be multiplied also 
lie in one plane, that is, in the plane spanned by the 
points 0, 1, and ib + jc. The result of the multiplica­
tion was
ax - b2 - c2 + i(a + x)b + j(a + x)c + k(bc - bc).
Hamilton concluded from this calculation ([3], 
p. 107) that:
the coefficient of k still vanishes; and ax - b2 - 
c2, (a + x)b, (a + x)c are easily found to be the 
correct coordinates of the product-point, in the 
sense that the rotation from the unit line to the 
radius vector of a, b, c being added in its own 
plane to the rotation from the same unit-line to 
the radius vector of the other factor-point x, b, c 
conducts to the radius vector of the lately men­
tioned product-point; and that this latter radius 
vector is in length the product of the two former. 
Confirmation of ij = -ji; but no information 
yet of the value of k .
The leap into the fourth 
dimension
After this encouraging result Hamilton ventured to 
attack the general case: “Try boldly then the general 
product of two triplets, ...”([3],p. 107.) He calcu­
lated
(a +ib+jc)(x +iy+jz)
=(ax - by - cz) + i(ay + bx) + j(az + cx) 
+ k(bz - cy).
In an exploratory attempt he set k =0and asked: Is 
the law of the moduli satisfied? In other words, does 
the identity
(a2+b2+c2)(x2+y2+z2)
=(ax - by - cz)2 +(ay + bx)2 +(az + cx)2
hold?
No, the first member exceeds the second by 
(bz - cy)2 . But this is just the square of the 
coefficient of k, in the development of the prod­
uct (a + ib + ic)(x + iy + jz), if we grant that 
ij = k, ji = -k, as before.
And now comes the insight which gave the entire 
problem a new direction. In the letter to Graves ([3], 
p. 108), Hamilton emphasized the insight:
And here there dawned on me the notion that we 
must admit, in some sense, a fourth dimension of 
space for the purpose of calculating with triplets.
This fourth dimension appeared as a “paradox” to 
Hamilton himself and he hastened to transfer the para­
dox to algebra ([3], p. 108):
. . . or transferring the paradox to algebra, [we] 
must admit a third distinct imaginary symbol k, 
not to be confounded with either i orj, but equal 
to the product of the first as multiplier, and the 
second as multiplicand; and therefore [I] was led

VAN DER WAERDEN: Hamilton’s Discovery of Quaternions
203
to introduce quaternions such as
a + ib + jc+ kd, or (a, b, c, d).
Hamilton was not the first to think about a multi­
dimensional geometry. In a footnote to the letter to 
Graves he wrote:
The writer has this moment been informed (in a 
letter from a friend) that in the Cambridge Math­
ematical Journal for May last [1843] a paper on 
Analytical Geometry of n dimensions has been 
published by Mr. Cayley, but regrets he does 
not yet know how far Mr. Cayley’s views and his 
own may resemble or differ from each other.
“This moment” can in this connection only mean the 
same day in which he wrote the letter to Graves. In 
the Note Book of the 16th of October 1843 there is 
no mention of the paper by Cayley. Hamilton there­
fore appears to have arrived at the concept of a 4­
dimensional space independently of Cayley.
After Hamilton had introduced ij = -ji = k as 
a fourth independent basis vector, he continued the 
calculation ([3], p. 108]):
I saw that we had probably ik = -j, because 
ik = iij, and i2 = -1; and that in like manner 
we might expect to find kj = ijj = -i.
From the use of the word “probably” it can be 
seen how cautiously Hamilton continued. He scarcely 
trusted himself to apply the associative law i(ij) = 
(ii)j because he was not yet certain if the associative 
law held for quaternions. Likewise, Hamilton could 
have used the associative law to determine ki:
ki = -(ji)i = -j(ii) = (-j)(-1) = j.
Instead he applied a conclusion by analogy. He wrote 
([3], p. 108):
... from which I thought it likely that ki = 
j, jk = i, because it seemed likely that if ji = 
-ij, we should have also kj = -jk, ik = -ki.
Finally k2 had to be determined. Hamilton again 
proceeded cautiously:
And since the order of multiplication of these 
imaginaries is not indifferent, we cannot infer 
that k2 , or ijij, is = +1, because i2 x j2 = 
(-1)(-1) = +1. It is more likely that k2 = 
ijij = -iijj = -1.
This last assumption k2 = -1, asserts Hamilton, 
is also necessary if we wish to fulfill the law of 
the moduli. He carried this out and concluded ([3], 
p. 108):
My assumptions were now completed, namely, 
i2 = j2 = k2 = -1 
ij = -ji = k 
jk = -kj = i 
ki = -ik = j.
And now Hamilton tested if the law of the moduli 
was actually satisfied.
But I considered it essential to try whether 
these equations were consistent with the law of 
moduli ... without which consistence being ver­
ified, I should have regarded the whole specula­
tion as a failure.
He therefore multiplied two arbitrary quaternions ac­
cording to the rules just formulated
(a, b, c, d)(a', b', c, d') = (a", b", c", d!'), 
calculated (a", b", c", d") and formed the sum of the 
squares
(a" )2 + (b" )2 + (c" )2 + (d" )2 
and found to his great joy that this sum of squares 
actually was equal to the product
(a 2 + b 2 + c 2 + d 2)( a' 2+ b' 2+ c 2+ d 2).
In Hamilton’s letter to his son we learn even more 
about the external circumstances which befell him at 
this flash of insight. Immediately after the previously 
cited words, “No, I can only add and subtract them.” 
Hamilton continued ([3], pp. xx-xxvi):
But on the 16th day of the same month [October 
1843]—which happened to be a Monday and 
a Council day of the Royal Irish Academy—I 
was walking in to attend and preside, and your 
mother was walking with me, along the Royal 
Canal, to which she had perhaps been driven; 
and although she talked with me now and then, 
yet an under-current of thought was going on in 
my mind, which gave at last a result, whereof 
it is not too much to say that I felt at once the 
importance. An electric circuit seemed to close; 
and a spark flashed forth, the herald (as I fore­
saw immediately) of many long years to come of 
definitely directed thought and work, by myself 
if spared, and at all events on the part of others, 
if I should ever be allowed to live long enough 
distinctly to communicate the discovery. I pulled

204
Algebra and Number Theory
out on the spot a pocket-book, which still exists, 
and made an entry there and then. Nor could 
I resist the impulse—unphilosophical as it may 
have been—to cut with a knife on a stone of 
Brougham Bridge, as we passed it, the funda­
mental formula with the symbols i, j, k;
i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = -1,
which contains the solution of the Problem, but 
of course as an inscription, has long since moul­
dered away.
The entry in the pocket book is reproduced on the 
title page of [3]: it contains the formulas
i2 = j2 = k2 = -1
ij = k, jk = i, ki = j 
ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j.
I assume as likely that before his walk Hamilton 
had already written on a piece of paper the result of 
the somewhat tiresome calculation which showed that 
the sum of squares
(ax - by - cz)2 +(ay + bx)2 +(az + cx)2
still lacked (bz - cy)2 compared with the product 
(a2 + b2 + c2)(x2 + y2 + z2). What then happened 
immediately before and during that remarkable walk 
along the Royal Canal, he described again on the same 
day in his Note Book, as follows:
I believe that I now remember the order of my 
thought. The equation ij =0was recommended 
by the circumstances that
(ax - y2 - z2)2 +(a + x)2 (y2 + z2) 
=(a2+y2+z2)(x2+y2+z2).
I therefore tried whether it might not turn out to 
be true that
(a2+b2+c2)(x2+y2+z2)
=(ax - by - cz)2 +(ay + bx)2 +(az + cx)2,
but found that this equation required, in order 
to make it true, the addition of (bz - cy)2 to 
the second member. This forced on me the non­
neglect of ij , and suggested that it might be 
equal to k, a new imaginary.
By underscoring the italicized words forced and 
suggested, Hamilton emphasized that he was con­
cerned with two entirely different facts. The first was 
a compelling logical conclusion, which came imme­
diately out of the calculation: it was not possible to 
set equal to zero, since then the law of the moduli 
would not hold. The second fact was an insight which 
came over him in a flash at the canal (“an electric 
circuit seemed to close, and a spark flashed forth”); 
that is, that ij could be taken to be a new imaginary 
unit.
After the insight was once there, everything else 
was very simple. The calculations ik = iij = -j 
and kj = ijj = -i could be made easily enough by 
Hamilton in his head. The assumptions ki = -ik = j 
and jk = -kj = i were immediate. And k2 could be 
easily calculated too: k2 = ijij = -iijj = -1.
And so during his walk Hamilton also discovered 
the rules of calculation which he entered into the 
pocket book. The pocket book also contains the for­
mulas for the coefficients of the product
(a + bi + cj + dk)(a + pi + Yj + Sk),
that is,
aa - bp - cY - dS
ap + ba + cS - dY 
aY - bS + ca + dp 
aS + bY - cp + da
as well as the sketch for the verification of the 
fact that in the sum of the squares of these co­
efficients all mixed terms (such as adaS) cancel 
and only (a2 + b2 + c2 + d2)(a2 + p2 + Y2 + S2 ) 
remains. In the Note Book of the same day, every­
thing was again completely restated.
Octonions
The letter to Graves in which Hamilton announced 
the discovery of quaternions was written on the 17th 
of October 1843, one day after the discovery. The 
seeds, which Hamilton sowed, fell upon fertile soil, 
since in December 1843 the recipient John T. Graves 
already found a linear algebra with 8 unit elements 
1,i,j,k,l,m,n,o, the algebra of octaves or octo­
nions. Graves defined their multiplication as follows 
([3], p. 648):
i2 = j2 = k2 = l2 = m2 = n2 = o2 = -1
i = jk = lm = on = -kj = -ml = -no 
j = ki = ln = mo = -ik = -nl = -om 
k = ij = lo = nm = -ji = -ol = -mn 
l = mi = nj = ok = -im = -jn = -ko
m = il = oj = kn = -li = -jo = -nk
n = jl = io = mk = -lj = -oi = -km
4o/ = ni = jm = kl = -in = -mj = -lk.

In this system the law of the moduli also holds:

(1)
Hamilton answered on the 8th of July 1844 ([3], 
p. 650). He noted to Graves that the associative law 
A • BC = AB • C clearly held for quaternions but 
not for octaves.
Octaves were re-discovered by Cayley in 1845; be­
cause of this they are also known as Cayley numbers. 
Graves also made an attempt with 16 unit elements 
but it was unsuccessful. It could not succeed since 
we know today that identities of the form (1) are only 
possible for sums of 1, 2, 4 and 8 squares. I should 
like to close with a brief comment about the history 
of these identities.
Product formulas for 
the sums of squares
It is likely that the law of the moduli for complex 
numbers was already known to Euler:
a2 +b2 c2 + d2 =(ac - bd)2 +(ad + bc)2 .
A similar formula for the sum of 4 squares
2 
22 
2 
2 
2
(a1 + ••• + a4)(b1 + ••• +b4)=(c1 + ••• +c4)
was discovered by Euler; the formula is stated in a let­
ter from Euler to Goldbach on May 4th 1748 [4]. The 
formula (1) for 8 squares, which Graves and Cayley 
proved by means of octonions, was previously found 
by Degen (1818) [6]. Degen erroneously thought that 
he could generalize the theorem to 2n squares.
The problem, which started with Hamilton, reads: 
can two triplets (a, b, c) and (x, y, z) be so multiplied 
that the law of the moduli holds? In other words: is it 
possible so to define (u, v, w) as bilinear functions of 
(a, b, c) and (x, y, z) that the identity
(a2 + b2 + c2)(x2 + y2 + z2) = (u2 + v2 + w2)
(2) 
results?
The first to show the impossibility for this identity 
was Legendre. In his great work Theorie des Nom- 
bres he remarked on page 198 that the numbers 3 
and 21 can easily be represented rationally as sums of 
three squares: 3=1+ 1+ 1, 21 = 16 + 4 + 1, but 
the product 3 x 21 = 63 cannot be so represented, 
since 63 is an integer of the form 8n + 7. It follows 
from this that an identity of the form (2) is impossi­
ble, to the extent that it is assumed that (u, v, w) are 
bilinear forms in (a, b, c) and (x, y, z) with rational 
coefficients. If Hamilton had known of this remark 
by Legendre he would probably have quickly given 
up the search to multiply triplets. Fortunately he did 
not read Legendre: he was self-taught.
The question for which values of n a formula of 
the kind
(a2 + • • • + a„) (b2 + • • • + bn) 
= c21 + • • • + c2n
is possible, was finally decided by Hurwitz in 1898. 
With the help of matrix multiplication he proved (in 
[5]) that n =1, 2, 4 and 8 are the only possibilities. 
For further historical accounts the reader may refer to

Hamilton, Rodrigues, and the Quaternion Scandal
SIMON L. ALTMANN
Mathematics Magazine 62 (1989), 291-308
Some of the best minds of the nineteenth century— 
and this was the century that saw the birth of mod­
ern mathematical physics—hailed the discovery of 
quaternions as just about the best thing since the in­
vention of sliced bread. Thus James Clerk Maxwell, 
the discoverer of electromagnetic theory, wrote ([31], 
p. 226):
The invention of the calculus of quaternions is a 
step towards the knowledge of quantities related 
to space which can only be compared, for its 
importance, with the invention of triple coordi­
nates by Descartes. The ideas of this calculus, as 
distinguished from its operations and symbols, 
are fitted to be of the greatest use in all parts of 
science.
Not everybody, alas, was of the same mind, and 
some of the things said were pretty nasty (Lord 
Kelvin, letter to Hayward, 1892; see [38], Vol. II, 
p. 1070):
Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really 
good work had been done; and, though beauti­
fully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to 
those who have touched them in any way, in­
cluding Clerk Maxwell.
Such robust language as Lord Kelvin’s may now 
be largely forgotten, but the fact remains that the man 
in the street is strangely averse to using quaternions. 
Side by side with matrices and vectors, now the lingua 
franca of all physical scientists, quaternions appear to 
exude an air of nineteenth-century decay, as a rather 
unsuccessful species in the struggle-for-life of math­
ematical ideas. Mathematicians, admittedly, still keep 
a warm place in their hearts for the remarkable alge­
braic properties of quaternions, but such enthusiasm 
means little to the harder-headed physical scientist.
This article will attempt to highlight certain prob­
lems of interpretation as regards quaternions which 
may seriously have affected their progress, and which 
might explain their present parlous status. For claims 
were made for quaternions which quaternions could 
not possibly fulfil, and this made it difficult to grasp 
what quaternions are excellent at, which is handling 
rotations and double groups. It is essentially the re­
lation between quaternions and rotations that will be 
explored in this paper, and the reader interested in 
double groups will find this question fully discussed 
in my recent book [1].
The men involved: Hamilton and 
Rodrigues
It is not possible to understand the quaternions’ 
strange passage from glory to decay unless we look 
a little into the history of the subject, and the his­
tory of quaternions, more perhaps than that of any 
other nineteenth-century mathematical subject, is 
dominated by the extraordinary contrast of two per­
sonalities, the inventor of quaternions, Sir William 
Rowan Hamilton, Astronomer Royal of Ireland, and 
Olinde Rodrigues, one-time director of the Caisse 
Hypothecate (a bank dedicated to lending money on 
mortgages) at the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin in Paris 
([4], p. 107).
Hamilton was a very great man indeed; his life is 
documented in minute detail in the three volumes of 
Graves [15]; and a whole issue in his honour was pub­
lished in 1943, the centenary of quaternions, in the 
Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Vol. A50 
and, in 1944 in Scripta Mathematica, Vol. 10. There 
are also two excellent new biographies ([23], [33]) 
and numerous individual articles (see, e.g. [26]). Of 
Hamilton, we know the very minute of his birth,

precisely midnight, between 3 and 4 August, 1805, 
in Dublin. Of Olinde Rodrigues, despite the excel­
lent one-and-only published article on him by Jeremy 
Gray [16], we know next to nothing. He is given a 
mere one-page entry in the Michaud Biographie Uni- 
verselle [32] as an “economist and French reformer”. 
So little is he known, indeed, that Cartan ([6], p. 57) 
invented a non-existent collaborator of Rodrigues by 
the surname of Olinde, a mistake repeated by Temple 
([37], p. 68). Booth [4] calls him Rodrigue throughout 
his book, and Wilson ([41], p. 100) spells his name 
as Rodriques.
Nothing that Rodrigues did on the rotation 
group—and he did more than any man before him, 
or than anyone would do for several decades after­
wards—brought him undivided credit; and for much 
of his work he received no credit at all. This Invis­
ible Man of the rotation group was probably born 
in Bordeaux on 16 October 1794, the son of a Jew­
ish banker, and he was named Benjamin Olinde, al­
though he never used his first name in later life. The 
family is often said to have been of Spanish origin, 
but the spelling of the family name rather suggests 
Portuguese descent (as indeed asserted by the En- 
ciclopedia Universal Illustrada Espasa-Calpe). He 
studied mathematics at the 1'.cole Normale, the 1'.cole 
Polytechnique not being accessible to him owing to 
his Jewish extraction. He took his doctorate at the 
new University of Paris in 1816 with a thesis which 
contains the famous Rodrigues formula for Legendre 
polynomials, for which he is mainly known [14].
The next 24 years or so until, out of the blue, he 
wrote the paper on rotations which we shall discuss 
later, are largely a blank as far as Rodrigues’s mathe­
matics is concerned. But he did lots of other things. 
The little that we know about Rodrigues relates to him 
mainly as a paranymph of Saint-Simon, the charis­
matic Utopian Socialist, whom he met in May 1823, 
two months after Saint-Simon’s attempted suicide. 
So, we read ([40], p. 30) that the banker Rodrigues 
helped the poor victim in his illness and destitution, 
and supported him financially until his death in 1825. 
That Rodrigues must have been very well off we can 
surmise from Weill’s reference to him as belonging 
to high banking circles, on a par with the wealthy 
Laffittes ([40], p. 238). After Saint-Simon died, with 
Rodrigues by his bedside, the latter shared the head­
ship of the movement with Prosper 1nfantin, an old 
friend and disciple of Saint-Simon. Thus he became 
Pere Olinde for the acolytes. But the union did not last 
very long: in 1832 Rodrigues repudiated 1nfantin’s 
extreme views of sexual freedom and he proclaimed 
himself the apostle of Saint-Simonism. In August of 
that year he was charged with taking part in illegal 
meetings and outraging public morality, and was fined 
fifty francs [4]. Neither of the two early historians of 
Saint-Simonism, Booth and Weill, even mention that 
Rodrigues was a mathematician: the single reference 
to this is that in 1813 he was 1nfantin’s tutor in math­
ematics at the 1cole Polytechnique. Indeed, all that 
we know about him in the year 1840 when he pub­
lished his fundamental paper on the rotation group is 
that he was “speculating at the Bourse” ([4], p. 216).
Besides his extensive writings on social and polit­
ical matters, Rodrigues published several pamphlets 
on the theory of banking and was influential in the 
development of the French railways. He died in Paris 
almost forgotten, however [32]. 1ven the date of his 
death is uncertain: 26 December 1850, according 
to the Biographie Universelle [32], or 17 Decem­
ber 1851, according to Larousse [27]. Se'bastien 
Charle'ty ([9], pp. 26, 294), although hardly touching 
upon Rodrigues in his authoritative history of Saint- 
Simonism, gives 1851 as the year of Rodrigues’s 
death, a date which most modern references seem 
to favour.
Hamilton survived Rodrigues by fourteen years 
and had the pleasure, three months before his death 
in 1865, to see his name ranked as that of the greatest 
living scientist in the roll of the newly created For­
eign Associates of the American National Academy 
of Sciences. And quite rightly so: his achievements 
had been immense by any standards. In comparison 
with Rodrigues, alas, he had been born with no more 
than a silver-plated spoon in his mouth: and the plat­
ing was tarnishing. When he was three the family had 
to park various children with relatives and William 
was sent to his uncle, the Rev. James Hamilton, who 
ran the diocesan school at Trim. That was an intel­
lectually explosive association of child prodigy and 
eccentric pedant: at three William was scribbling in 
Hebrew and at seven he was said by an expert at Trin­
ity College, Dublin, to have surpassed the standard 
in this language of many Fellowship candidates. At 
ten, he had mastered ten oriental languages, Chaldee, 
Syriac, and Sanscrit amongst them plus, of course, 
Latin and Greek and various 1uropean languages. 
This is, at least, the received wisdom on Hamilton and 
it may contain an element of legend: it is pretty clear, 
e.g., that his knowledge of German was not all that 
strong in later life and the veracity of the reports on 
these linguistic feats is disputed by O’Donnell [33]. 
Mathematics—if one does not count mental arith­
metic, at which he was prodigious—came late but 

208
Algebra and Number Theory
with a bang when, at seventeen, reading on his own 
Laplace’s Mecanique Celeste, he found a mistake in it 
which he communicated to the President of the Irish 
Academy. His mathematical career was already set in 
1823 when, still seventeen, he read a seminal paper 
on caustics before the Royal Irish Academy.
From then on Hamilton’s career was meteoric: As­
tronomer Royal of Ireland at 22, when he still had to 
take two quarterly examinations as an undergraduate, 
knight at 30. Like Oersted, the Copenhagen pharma­
cist who had stirred the world in 1820 with his dis­
covery of the electromagnetic interaction, Hamilton 
was a Kantian and a follower of the Naturphilosophie 
movement then popular in Central Europe. For Hamil­
ton “The design of physical science is . . . to learn the 
language and to interpret the oracles of the universe” 
(Lecture on Astronomy, 1831, see [15], Vol. I, p. 501). 
He discusses in 1835, prophetically (because of the 
later application of quaternions in relativity theory), 
“Algebra as the Science of Pure Time”. He writes 
copiously both in prose and in stilted verse, engages 
in a life-long friendship with Wordsworth, and goes 
to Highgate in the spring of 1832 to meet Coleridge, 
whom he visits and with whom he corresponds regu­
larly in the next few years, the poet praising him for 
his understanding “that Science . . . needs a Baptism, 
a regeneration in Philosophy” or Theosophy ([15], 
Vol. I, p. 546).
The discovery of quaternions
Hamilton had been interested in complex numbers 
since the early 1830s and he was the first to show, in 
1833, that they form an algebra of couples (See [22], 
Vol. III.) I shall review briefly his ideas so as to lead 
the way to quaternions, but, here and hereafter, I shall 
use my own notation in order to avoid ambiguities. 
First, we define imaginary units, 1 and i with the 
well-known multiplication rules in Table 1. Then the 
elements of the algebra are the complex numbers A = 
a1+Ai, with a and A real.
Of course, to say that they form an algebra merely 
means that the formal rules of arithmetical operations 
are valid for the objects so defined. Thus, given A and 
a similarly defined B, their product is
AB = ab - AB + i(aB + bA). 
(1)

Table 1. Multiplication Table of the Quaternion Units
We can now write the complex numbers A and B as 
couples (or ordered pairs)
A = [ a, A J, B = [ b,B J, 
(2)
and their product is also a couple:
AB = [ab — AB, aB + bA]. 
(3)
Hamilton also recognized that the real number a can 
be written as the complex couple
a = [a, 0]. 
(4)
For the next ten years Hamilton’s mind was oc­
cupied, if not obsessed, with two problems. On the 
one hand, Hamilton tried to extend the concept of the 
complex number as a couple in order to define a triple, 
with one real and two imaginary units. This however, 
not even he could do. On the other hand, the concept 
of a vector was beginning to form in his mind. It must 
be remembered that in the 1830s not even the word 
vector existed, although people were playing about, 
in describing forces and such other quantities, with 
concepts that we would recognize today as at least 
vector-like. It is pretty clear that during this gestation 
period, as a result of which Hamilton would eventu­
ally invent the notion of vector, he had built up in his 
mind a picture of the addition and of some form of 
multiplication of vectors, but there was an operation 
which baffled him in the extreme: coming down the 
stairs for breakfast, Hamilton often could hear his el­
der son asking: “Father, have you now learned how to 
divide vectors?”. Out of this preoccupation Hamilton 
was to invent the most beautiful algebra of the cen­
tury, but he was also to feed the fever that eventually 
led him to corrupt his own invention.
We must now come to Monday, 16 October 1843, 
one of the best documented days in the history of 
mathematics and which, by one of those ironies of 
fate, happened to be the 49th birthday of Olinde 
Rodrigues, whose work, however ignored, was to give 
a new meaning to Hamilton’s creation. Hamilton’s 
letter to his youngest son, of 5 August 1865 ([15], 
Vol. II, p. 434), is almost too well known, but bears 
brief repetition. The morning of that day Hamilton, 
accompanied by Lady Hamilton, was walking along 
the Royal Canal in Dublin towards the Royal Irish 
Academy, where Hamilton was to preside at a meet­
ing. Ashe was walking past Broome Bridge (referred 
to as Brougham Bridge by Hamilton and called by this 
name ever since), Hamilton, in a real flash of inspi­
ration, realized that three, rather than two, imaginary

209
units were needed, with the following properties:
i2 =j2 =k2 =-1, ij=k, ji=-k, (5) 
and cyclic permutation. As everyone knows, and de 
Valera was to do almost one century later on his prison 
wall, Hamilton carved these formulae on the stone of 
the bridge: poor Lady Hamilton had to wait. Armed 
now with four units, Hamilton called the number
A = a1+Axi + Ayj + Azk, 
(6)
where the coefficients here are all real, a quaternion. 
Thus were quaternions born and baptized: it was en­
tered on the Council Books of the Academy for that 
day that Mr. W. R. Hamilton was given leave to read 
a paper on quaternions at the First General Meeting 
of the Session, 13 November 1843.
One of the various falsehoods which have tobe dis­
pelled about quaternions is the origin of their name, 
since entirely unsupported sources are often quoted, 
in particular Milton, Paradise Lost, Vol. 181 ([28], 
p. 70) and the Vulgate, Acts 12:4 ([37], p. 46). Of 
course, we know that Milton was a favourite poet of 
Hamilton at 24 ([15], Vol. I, p. 321), and to suggest 
that he was not aware of Acts and the apprehension 
of Peter by a quaternion of soldiers would be absurd. 
(These references appear in fact in Dr. Johnson’s Dic­
tionary, which was familiar to every schoolboy of the 
time.) But no one with the slightest acquaintance with 
Hamilton’s thought would accept the obvious when 
the recondite will do. In his Elements of Quater­
nions ([21], p. 114) we find our first clue: “As to 
the mere word, quaternion, it signifies primarily (as 
is well known), like its Latin original, Quaternio or 
the Greek noun TtrpaxTu^, a Set of Four”. The key 
word here is tetractys, and there is evidence for this 
coming from Hamilton’s closest, perhaps his only real 
pupil, P. G. Tait, who, writing in the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica (see article on Quaternions in the XIth 
edition) says: “Sir W. R. Hamilton was probably in­
fluenced by the recollection of its Greek equivalent 
the Pythagorean Tetractys ..., the mystic source of 
all things . . . ”. That Tait very much believed in this 
is supported by the unattributed epigraph in Greek 
in the title page of his own treatise on quaternions 
[36]: these are verses 47 and 48 of Carmen Aureum 
(Golden Song), a Hellenistic Pythagorean poem much 
in vogue in the Augustan era, the full text of which ap­
pears in Diehl ([11], p. 45). Of course, the concept of 
the tetractys of embodying, as we shall see, multiple 
layers of meaning in a single word, must have at­
tracted Hamilton: for Pythagoras, having discovered 
that the intervals of Greek music are given by the ra­
tios 2: 1, 3:2and 4:3made it appear that kosmos, 
that is, order and beauty, flow from the first four dig­
its, 1, 2, 3, 4, the sum of which gives the perfect num­
ber 10, and is symbolized by the sacred symbol, the 
tetractys:
0
00 
000 
0000
(A famous depiction of the tetractys can be seen in 
the School of Athens, the fresco by Raphael at the 
Vatican where, anachronistically, the sacred symbol 
is given in Latin numerals in the figure held in front of 
Pythagoras.) The Pythagoreans used to take an oath 
by the tetractys, as recorded by Sextus Empiricus (see 
([24], p. 233):
The Pythagoreans are accustomed sometimes to 
say “All things are like number” and sometimes 
to swear this most potent oath: “Nay, by him that 
gave to us the tetractys, which contains the fount 
and root of ever-flowing nature.”
That the tetractys exercised the imagination of Hamil­
ton, there is no doubt: besides the cryptic footnote in 
the Elements, already quoted, we find Augustus De 
Morgan (with whom Hamilton entertained a very co­
pious correspondence) acknowledging on27 Decem­
ber 1851 a sonnet from Hamilton (apparently lost) on 
the tetractys. It is tempting to speculate that Hamil­
ton might have been introduced to the tetractys by 
Coleridge, who called it “the adorable tetractys, or 
tetrad” (see [2], p. 252), and who referred to it many 
times.
In praise of Hamilton: the algebra 
of quaternions
In comparison with the binary form (2) ofa complex 
number, the quaternion (6) can also be written as a 
couple of a real number a and a vector A of com­
ponents Ax ,Ay ,Az (as already said, we use modern 
rather than historical notation):
A = [a, A], A =(Ax,Ay,Az). 
(7)
Just as for the complex numbers, in order to multiply 
two such objects we need the multiplication table 
of the quaternion units, which follows at once from 
equation (5); it is given in Table 2.

Table 2. Multiplication table of the quaternion units
Consider now a second quaternion B; write both A 
and B as in equation (6) and, on using the table, their 
product follows at once in the same manner as that in 
(3):
AB = [ab - A • B,aB + bA + A x B]. 
(8)
Although Hamilton did not give names or symbols 
for these operations, it is here that the scalar and vec­
tor products of two vectors appear for the first time 
in history. We can now go back to Table 2 and reflect 
a little about why Hamilton made the product ij non- 
commutative. Not only was this the first time that a 
non-commutative product appeared in mathematics, 
but this was a true stroke of genius. Remember that 
Hamilton wanted to divide vectors: he never really 
achieved this (neither was it worth trying) but the 
point is that, because of this, he was after a division 
algebra, i.e., one in which the quotient of an element 
of the algebra by any other non-null element always 
exists. Now, a necessary condition fora division alge­
bra is this: the product of two elements of the algebra 
must vanish if and only if one of the factors is the 
null element. Table 2 is designed so that this happens, 
as can easily be verified from the resulting multipli­
cation rule, given by (8). A counterexample will be 
instructive. Suppose we take ij and ji as equal in Table 
2, and, similarly, for the other products. Then, under 
the new multiplication rules, it is very easy to verify 
that the product of the two non-null elements
A=i+j, B=-i+j, 
(9)
vanishes.
Hamilton’s everlasting monument (see [30]) is his 
construction of objects which, except for commuta­
tivity, obey the same algebra as that of the real and 
complex numbers and which therefore, like them, 
form a division algebra: and Hamilton was aware of 
this—although he could not foresee that his brain­
child was going to receive at the hands of Frobenius 
in 1878 the supreme accolade of being proved to be 
the only possible algebra, in addition to the real and 
complex numbers, with this property.
The trouble starts
Now back to 16 October 1843. That same evening 
Hamilton wrote a long and detailed draft of a letter 
to his friend John Graves, first published by A. J. Mc­
Connell ([29] and included in [22], Vol. III). Next 
day a final letter was written and sent, later published 
in the Philosophical Magazine [17]. The November 
report to the Irish Academy was published almost at 
the same time [18]. We can thus follow almost hour 
by hour Hamilton’s first thoughts on quaternions. Al­
though in the morning of the glorious day he had 
been led to the discovery through the algebra of the 
quaternions, by the evening (and in this he acknowl­
edges the influence of Warren [39]), he had been able 
to recognize a relation between quaternions and what 
we now call rotations. And in this, sadly, we cannot 
but see the germ of the canker that eventually con­
sumed the quaternion body. Three separate themes, 
ever present in Hamilton’s mind, contributed to this 
infirmity.
As regards the first theme: as in (4), Hamilton iden­
tified a real number with a real quaternion:
a = [a, 0]. 
(10)
Nothing wrong here, but it invited Hamilton to go 
on and identify a pure quaternion (a quaternion with 
a null scalar part) with a vector, a word which he 
invented for this purpose in 1846 ([19], p. 54):
A = [0, A]. 
(11)
As the inventor of the vector he was entitled to call 
this object anything he wanted, but the problem is 
that by this time people were already thinking about 
forces and such like objects very much as we think 
of vectors today and that the identification of Hamil­
ton’s ‘vectors’ with what they had in mind created 
a great deal of confusion. The apparently innocent 
convention (11) entails in fact two serious problems. 
That something here was a serious worry must have 
been evident for decades, as Klein ([25], p. 186), one 
of the leading nineteenth-century geometers, implied 
himself. Yet, the first explicit statement to the effect 
that something is wrong here which I have been able 
to find is as recent as 1958 by Marcel Riesz ([34], 
p. 21):
Hamilton and his school professed that the 
quaternions make the study of vectors in three- 
space unnecessary since every vector can be 
considered as the vectorial part ...ofaquater- 
nion . . . this interpretation is grossly incorrect 
since the vectorial part of a quaternion behaves 

ALTMANN: Hamilton, Rodrigues, and the Quaternion Scandal
211
with respect to coordinate transformations like a 
bivector or axial vector and not like an ordinary 
or polar vector.
However damning this statement is, it is only half the 
story, since the pure quaternion (11) is not anything 
like a vector at all: we shall see that it is a binary rota­
tion, that is, a rotation by n. The left-hand side of (11) 
should be written as A and carefully distinguished 
from the vector A. The fact that neither Hamilton, 
nor his successors to the present day, introduced any 
notational distinction between these two objects is the 
source of extraordinary confusion, as we shall soon 
witness ourselves.
Hamilton’s second theme was closely connected to 
his first and has already been mentioned: he wanted 
to find a definition of the quotient of two vectors and 
however grateful we must be for this obsession, which 
has given us the last possible division algebra, we 
shall soon see that it led Hamilton to an interpretation 
of quaternions and of their operations which is not 
right.
Hamilton’s capacious mind could not be at rest un­
til he understood not just the formalities of his work 
but also what went on behind the scenes, and he had 
to understand the physical or geometrical meaning 
of equating the square of the imaginary or quaternion 
unit, i2, with -1. This was his third everlasting theme, 
for which he took a cue from Argand, who had ob­
served in 1806 that the imaginary unit i rotates what 
we would now call a vector in the Argand plane by 
n/2, which made it possible to visualize the relation 
in question. From that point of view, in fact, i2 should 
be a rotation by n which, duly enough, multiplies each 
vector of the plane by the factor -1. For this reason, 
Hamilton always identified the quaternion units with 
quadrantal rotations, as he called the rotations by 
n/2 (see [20], p. 64, art. 71). Clifford ([10], p. 351) 
associates himself with this interpretation which he 
presents with beautiful clarity. The sad truth is that, 
however appealing this argument is, to identify the 
quaternion units with rotations by n/2 is not only not 
right, but it is entirely unacceptable in the study of 
the rotation group: we shall see, in fact, that they are 
nothing else except binary rotations.
Quaternions and rotations: 
the first steps
Already during the first day of his creation Hamilton 
knew what he had to do in order to define rotations.
Since rotations must leave the lengths of vectors in­
variant, and since for Hamilton a vector was a partic­
ular case of a quaternion, the first thing he had to do 
is to define the norm or length |A| of a quaternion. 
He defined for this purpose the conjugate quaternion
I a, A] * = [ a, - A]. 
(12)
The norm is now defined as follows:
AA * = [ a, A][ a, - A] = [ a 2+ A2,0] 
= a2 + A2 = |A|2. 
(13)
A quaternion of unit norm is called a normalized 
quaternion and, although Hamilton also considered 
more general quaternions, these will be the only 
quaternions which we shall need for the purposes 
of this article. It was easy for Hamilton to prove that 
the product of two normalized quaternions is a nor­
malized quaternion. (See, e.g. [1], p. 208.) We are 
now ready to accompany Hamilton in performing an 
extraordinary piece of legerdemain.
An optical illusion: the rectangular 
rotation
A rotation is an operation which transforms a unit, 
that is, a normalized position vector r (a vector with 
its tail at the origin), into another unit position vec­
tor r'. If we go along with Hamilton and identify the 
vector r with the pure quaternion R equal to "0, r], 
the latter is clearly normalized. In order to achieve a 
rotation and keep the normalization requirement of 
R, all that we need is to act on [0, r] with a normal­
ized quaternion. (See the italicized statement in the 
previous paragraph.) Let us, therefore, choose for this 
purpose the quaternion
A = [cos a, sin a nJ, 
| n | = 1, 
(14)
which is clearly normalized. (Here n is a unit posi­
tion vector.) This is not the end of the story, however, 
because we must require that the product AR be not 
only normalized, but also a pure quaternion R' of 
the form "0, r'] which Hamilton would then iden­
tify with the rotated position vector r'. This is what 
Hamilton envisioned on the same evening of Cre­
ation Day, and he also realized that for this idea to 
work it was the necessary that the vector n, which 
he called the axis of the quaternion, be normal to the 
vector r. (This is why this is called the rectangular 
transformation.) To verify that this works is child’s 
play on using the quaternion multiplication rule (8).

212
Algebra and Number Theory
Figure 1. The rectangular transformation. The vector r' is defined in equation (15).
Given that r • n = 0, then
AR = [cos a, sin an][0, r]
= [0, cos ar + sin a(n x r)J
= [0, r' J = R'. 
(15)
If we briefly avert our gaze while Hamilton rewrites 
this equation as
Ar = r', 
(16)
then the job is done—that is, the quaternion A trans­
forms the unit position vector r into another unit po­
sition vector r' and, therefore, has rotated r into r'. 
What is more: it is clear from Figure 1 that the angle 
of rotation is a. Thus Hamilton identified quaternion 
(14) with a rotation around the axis n of the quater­
nion by the angle a of rotation of the quaternion.
All this is so wonderfully convincing that it is dif­
ficult to believe that there is anything wrong here. 
Moreover, Hamilton immediately obtained confirma­
tion that one of his themes was coming out all right, 
for it was clear to him that the quaternion units in 
this picture are quadrantal rotations, as it is immedi­
ate from (14): on comparing this equation with, say, 
the quaternion unit k, given by [0, kJ, one can see 
at once that the rotation angle to be associated with 
k must be n/2. His other theme was also coming 
out well here, since from (16) the quaternion A can 
be considered as the quotient of the vector r' by the 
vector r. This picture of quaternions was thus so near 
Hamilton’s heart that in his Lectures on Quaternions 
([20], p. 122), and ever after, the primary definition 
of a quaternion which he used was
The quotient of two vectors, or the operator 
which changes one vector into another, 
as later adopted by the Oxford English Dictionary, 
and this definition became the core of the quaternion 
dogma, thus causing endless damage. We shall see, in 
fact, that a quaternion can never operate on a vector, 
as (16) implies, and that this equation must always be 
understood as the quaternion product in (15).
The comical transformation
(this heading contains a misprint)
The conical transformation was the means by which 
nature began to make its protest against Hamilton. 
Even accepting that a pure quaternion is a vector, 
we must ensure, in order to have a rotation, that the 
transform ofa normalized pure quaternion is another 
normalized pure quaternion. Thus, a general rotation 
cannot be written as AR, because this product is not 
a pure quaternion unless, as we have seen, the axis 
of A is normal to r. Hamilton and his colleagues, 
therefore, searched for a quaternion transformation 
of a pure quaternion R under a normalized quater­
nion A which would always produce a normalized 
pure quaternion R'. The result of this search was the 
following transformation:
ARA * = R'. 
(17)
It is, in fact, quite easy by means of (8) to verify that 
the left-hand side of this equation is normalized and 
pure. With a little bit of geometry (see [1], p. 214), 
and assuming that A is given by (14), it can be proved 
that r, n, and r' are related as shown in Figure 2, i.e., 
that the vector r is rotated around n by the angle 2a.
There are two problems here: first, the form of (17) 
has nothing at all to do with that of (15), so that it 
is no longer possible to say that the quaternion oper­
ates on a vector transforming it into another vector,

ALTMANN: Hamilton, Rodrigues, and the Quaternion Scandal
213
Figure 2. The conical transformation
or even less that it is the quotient of two vectors. The 
second problem is this: which is the angle of rota­
tion to be associated with a quaternion (14), a, as 
in the rectangular transformation, or 2a, as it turns 
out in the case of a general rotation? It is, perhaps, 
significant that Hamilton obtained (17) (writing the 
conjugate quaternion as the reciprocal, as it is valid 
for a normalized quaternion) but did not publish it for 
some time. Cayley [7] was the first to go into print, 
although in his collected papers ([8], Vol. I, p. 586, 
note 20) he concedes priority to Hamilton. Cayley 
notices that the components of r' are
precisely those given for such transformations 
by M. Olinde Rodrigues . . . It would be an in­
teresting question to account, a priori for the 
appearance of these coefficients here.
Let us see what Hamilton has to say about this ([20], 
p. 271, my italics):
The SYMBOL OF OPERATION q()q-1, where 
q may be called (as before) the operator quater­
nion, while the symbol (suppose r) of the 
operand quaternion is conceived to occupy the 
place marked by the parentheses ...‘can be re­
garded as’ a conical transformation of the 
operand round the axis of the operator, through 
double the angle thereof.
It is clear that Hamilton, rather than accepting the 
result of the more general transformation (17) to rec­
ognize that the angle of rotation of the quaternion 
(14) is 2a, gives greater weight to the transforma­
tion (16) and keeps talking of the angle a in (14) as 
the angle of rotation. Naturally, whereas (16) had the 
shape that he expected, the form of (17), as Cayley 
stated, could not be explained. It is, perhaps, because 
of this that, although Figure 2 is nothing else than 
the most general rotation ofa vector, Hamilton refers 
to it with the ad hoc name of conical rotation, as if 
it were a particular case of the transformation of a 
vector. It had, instead, been Rodrigues who had rec­
ognized, three years before Hamilton’s invention of 
quaternions, that the angle a in (14) is not the rota­
tion angle but only half of it. But his paper, which 
had puzzled Cayley, was almost certainly never read 
by Hamilton and it was never again quoted by any 
of the major quaternionists. As for Cayley’s question, 
it was probably never answered until 1986. (See [1], 
p. 214.)
The Rodrigues programme
Hamilton constructed quaternions as an algebra, 
whence the elements of the algebra were given a dual 
role as operators (rotations) and operands (vectors). 
This was very lucidly explained by Clifford [10], but 
it must be clearly appreciated that, as we have al­
ready asserted, the status of vectors in this scheme is 
highly dubious, of which more later. Be that as it may, 
in Hamilton’s approach rotations become subservient 
to the algebra, which opens the door to a variety of 
misinterpretations.
Historically, however, a treatment of rotations and 
quaternions had been going on for some years before 
1843, quite independently of Hamilton and taking a 
diametrically opposed view to his. This treatment was 
entirely geometric, and because it tried to do a simple 
job in a simple way it was clear and precise and it 
was entirely successful; but it was largely ignored by 
everyone.
Let us consider rotations of a unit sphere with fixed 
center about various axes. The first problem which

214
Algebra and Number Theory
Figure 3. The product of the rotations R(al) and 
R(3m) is the rotation R(yn).
arises is whether, if we apply one rotation after an­
other, the net result is a rotation of the sphere around 
some unique axis by some unique angle. Euler [12] 
proved algebraically that this is so, but he did not 
provide either a geometric or a constructive solution 
(i.e., a solution in which the axis and angle of the 
resultant rotation are determined geometrically or al­
gebraically).
It was the paper by Rodrigues in 1840 [35] which 
solved all these aspects of the problem. In its §8he 
describes most clearly, without a figure, a geomet­
ric construction which, given the angles and axes of 
two successive rotations, determines the orientation 
of the resultant axis of rotation and the geometrical 
value of the angle of rotation. This construction is 
usually called in the literature the Euler construction, 
although Euler had nothing to do with it. Not only was 
this construction ignored by the quaternionists, but it 
is not even mentioned in modern books on the rota­
tion group. Although Hamilton himself rediscovered, 
geometrically ([20], p. 328), the results of the Ro­
drigues construction, this is not a theorem to which 
either he or his commentators paid much attention 
(see [1], pp. 19-20).
Let us represent a rotation around the axis p by the 
angle ^ with the symbol R(^p). Then, if we use the 
Rodrigues construction for the following product of 
rotations,
R(al)R(3m) = R(yn), 
(18)
it turns out that the axes l, m, and n form a spheri­
cal triangle with the angles shown in Figure 3. (Re­
member that in the left-hand side of (18) the rotation 
around m is applied first and it is followed by that 
around l: this is the usual convention for reading op­
erators.)
What is very remarkable about this very simple 
triangle is that the angles of the rotations appear in 
it as half-angles, and this is the first time that half­
angles occur in the study of rotations. Their impor­
tance is absolutely crucial, as we shall see, and yet 
they were ignored by Euler and were never considered 
by Hamilton or his followers: it took more than forty 
years before their significance was appreciated. One 
would shirk nowadays at the solution of the spherical 
triangle in Figure 3 (see [1], p. 157), but mathemati­
cal training in France on surveying and such was very 
good and Rodrigues was able to obtain quite easily 
expressions for the angle and axis of the resultant 
rotation—that is, the one on the right-hand side of 
(18)—in terms of those of the factors which appear 
on its left. The following are Rodrigues’s formulae ex­
actly as he gave them, except that I have introduced 
vector notation, which was non-existent in his time:
y

(20)
These formulae immediately suggest that a rotation 
R(a1) can be represented by a couple of a scalar 
and a vector (although this notation was not used by 
Rodrigues):
R (a l) = |cos a, sin a l| , 
(21)
so that the product (18) is written as follows
cos a, sin a 1 
2 ,
cos —, sin3- m 
2, 2

(22)
with the parameters on the right-hand side of this 
equation being given by (19) and (20). It can imme­
diately be seen that the multiplication rule for the 
couples so defined is identical with the multiplica­
tion (8) of Hamilton’s quaternions! Rodrigues’s cou­
ples are, therefore, quaternions, but the difference in 
parametrization between (21) and (14) is profound. 
We see at once that the conical transformation, which 
gives the angle of rotation as twice the angle which 
appears in the quaternion was right, and that Hamilton 
committed a serious error of judgement in basing his 
parametrization on the special case ofthe rectangular 
transformation.
Simple as the distinction is, the consequences are 
dramatic, and never more so than when we consider 

ALTMANN: Hamilton, Rodrigues, and the Quaternion Scandal
215
pure quaternions. From (21), it is clear that for a 
quaternion to be pure the angle of rotation must be 
n—that is, a pure quaternion is nothing other than a 
binary rotation:
[0, rj = R (n r). 
(23)
Thus, it is entirely wrong ever to identify a pure 
quaternion with a vector, as Hamilton had done in 
(11). This simple fact will exorcise all the demons 
so far lurking into our story. Before we do this, we 
must mention that the (four) rotation parameters in 
(21) are called the Euler-Rodrigues parameters in 
the literature. The reasons for this are entirely disrep­
utable (see [1], p. 20), since Euler never came near 
them: in particular, he never used half-angles which, 
as demonstrated by Rodrigues, are an essential fea­
ture of the parametrization of rotations.
The resolution of the paradoxes
Although quaternions are always rotations and never 
vectors, they allow us to mark points in space very 
much as a position vector does. Consider the unit 
sphere centered and fixed at the origin. A rotation of 
it determines a single point of the sphere which is 
called the pole of the rotation. This is the point of the 
sphere which is left invariant by the rotation and such 
that from outside it the rotation is seen as positive 
(counter-clockwise). If we want to mark a point in 
space by means of rotation poles, it is sensible to 
use always binary rotations for this purpose, since, as 
it follows from (23), these are the nearest things to 
vectors that we can get within the quaternion algebra. 
(It should be stressed that this is purely a matter of 
convenience: the pole of any arbitrary rotation is just 
as good to denote a point of the unit sphere and thus 
to masquerade as a vector.) Let us now look again at 
(15) with the quaternion A in it given by
AR = R', A = [cos a, sin a nJ. 
(24)
If we compare the left-hand side of this line with (18) 
and (21), it says this: the product of a rotation by 2a 
around the axis n, times a binary rotation around the 
axis r, is a binary rotation around the axis r':
R (2 a n) R (n r) = R (n r'). 
(25)
The angle of rotation, which we already know, and the 
orientation of the axis r' can, of course, be obtained 
from the quaternion multiplication rules (as given, 
e.g., in (19) and (20)) but it will be instructive to 
obtain an independent geometrical verification, since 
this will show up the paradox involved in Hamilton’s
Figure 4. Product of a rotation by 2a around the axis n 
normal to the plane of the drawing, with a binary rotation 
about the axis r.
interpretation of the rectangular transformation. We 
do this in Figure 4.
In order to multiply rotations we transform the unit 
sphere, whose intersection with the plane of the draw­
ing is shown in Figure 4. The rotation axis n is per­
pendicular to and above the plane of the drawing. The 
rotation axis r is in the plane of the drawing and thus, 
as it must be in the rectangular transformation, is nor­
mal to n. A point above the plane of the drawing is 
represented with a cross and those below with a cir­
cle. In order to multiply the two rotations on the left 
of (25) we start with the point 1 above the plane of 
the drawing. The first rotation to act on it (remember 
to read the left-hand side of (25) from right to left) 
is a rotation by n around r which takes it into the 
point 2 below the plane of the drawing. The rotation 
around n by 2a takes 2 to 3. Thus, the two combined 
operations take the point 1 above the drawing to the 
point 3 below the drawing, which is the effect ofa bi­
nary rotation around the axis r'. Notice that the angle 
between the axes r and r' is a and that this angle is 
not the angle of rotation.
We can now see how Hamilton’s optical illusion 
was performed. Ifin (24) we identify the quaternions 
R and R' with their corresponding vectors r and r', 
Figure 4 now reads as the rotation of r into r' by 
a. Incidentally, the correct reading of Figure 4 as 
stating that a rotation axis by 2a and a perpendicular 
binary axis determine another perpendicular binary 
axis at an angle a to the first one is so fundamental in 
crystallography that the whole of this science would 
collapse like a pack of cards ifit were not true.

What about the conical transformation? I cannot 
go into all the details of the theory, but a sketch will 
suffice. We must accept the following result (see [1], 
p. 215). If we take a pole of a binary rotation r and we 
rotate this pole about an axis n by an angle a, the new 
pole thus obtained, r', is the pole of another binary 
rotation given in the following form:
R (a n) R (n r) R (—a n) = R (n r'). 
(26)
Because the corresponding quaternions must multi­
ply in the same manner, we get immediately (17), 
since the inverse and conjugate quaternions are iden­
tical in our case. We must remember, though, to use 
the Rodrigues parametrization of the quaternion, as 
in (21), and not Hamilton’s (14):
ARA * = R', 
A = [cos a, sin a nJ . 
(27)
In this case it is heuristically possible to substitute r 
and r' for the quaternions R and R', with the poles of 
the binary rotations masquerading successfully as po­
sition vectors. This substitution, however, must never 
be done anywhere else. In particular, one must never 
attempt to operate with a quaternion on a vector, as 
is shown by the disastrous results of the crude inter­
pretation of the rectangular transformation.
We must now discuss again the significance of the 
quaternion units. Because they are pure quaternions 
they must now be identified with binary rotations (ro­
tations by n). This, for Hamilton, must have been ab­
surd: the relation i2 equal to —1 must still be satisfied. 
But the product of two rotations by n about the same 
axis is a rotation by 2n. This is clearly the identity 
operation, i.e., one which does not change any vec­
tor, whereas we are now saying that it is equal to —1, 
i.e., that it changes the sign of all vectors in space.
I believe that this is the reason Hamilton was forced 
to accept his parametrization, since this agreed with 
his picture of quaternion units as quadrantal rotations. 
Rodrigues, practical man as bankers must be, knew 
better than to worry about this strange result of his 
geometry—he did not carry, like Hamilton, all the 
world’s problems on his shoulders. Nature and his­
tory, alas, were playing games with Hamilton. How 
was he to know that Cartan was going to discover in 
1913 [5] objects (spinors) which are indeed multiplied 
by — 1 under a rotation by 2n, exactly as Rodrigues’s 
parametrization requires? Moreover, when the topol­
ogy of the rotation group became understood in the 
1920s through the work of Hermann Weyl, it became 
natural to accept that the square of a binary rotation 
multiplies the identity by —1, and thus behaves like 
the quaternion units. Though this should have shown 
the enormous importance of quaternions in the rota­
tion group, they were by that time somewhat discred­
ited, so that other much less effective parametrizations 
of the rotation group were in universal use.
It must be stressed that the Rodrigues approach to 
rotations, by emphasizing their multiplication rules 
and by regarding them entirely as operators, fully re­
veals the group properties of the set of all orthogonal 
rotations, the full orthogonal group SO(3), as it is 
now called. The set of all normalized quaternions (in 
the Rodrigues parametrization) is a group homomor­
phic to SO(3), and it is its covering group. Although 
I cannot go into the mathematical significance of this 
statement, its practical importance in quantum me­
chanics, e.g., can be easily understood: it permits the 
study of the transformation properties of the wave 
functions of the electron spin. It is for this purpose 
that quaternions are superb, because their use in deal­
ing with rotations makes the work not only simpler 
but also more precise than with any other method.
The decline
Hamilton was still under forty when he discovered 
quaternions, but he had more than twenty years of 
very productive research past him and was already 
showing the signs of having passed his prime. Fi­
nancial and even sentimental worries are often men­
tioned, as well as overwork and an increasing con­
sumption of alcohol [33]. I am inclined to believe 
that a major factor was that Hamilton himself was in 
some way aware of the internal contradictions of his 
doctrine and that he could not rest until he could peel 
off all layers of reality one by one to reach to the core. 
This was always beyond his power, since he was not 
prepared to renounce the, for him, essential picture of 
the quaternion units as quadrantal rotations. Be it as 
it may, his writing became more and more obscure: 
even his supporters found his books unreadable. And 
he himself became more isolated and eccentric.
E. T. Bell ([3], Ch. 19) labelled the last twenty 
years of Hamilton The Irish Tragedy. Lanczos [26] 
compares them with Einstein’s fruitless search for 
a unified field theory in his own last two decades. 
The truth is probably somewhere between these two 
views. For Hamilton suffered the weight of his own 
greatness: it was not enough for him to have an alge­
bra, it was not enough to have a geometry, he had to 
“interpret the oracles of the Universe” and the oracles 
trailed in front of him false clues that no one was to 
unravel for another three-score years after his death.

ALTMANN: Hamilton, Rodrigues, and the Quaternion Scandal
217
If only he had known about spinors! The result, how­
ever, was that Hamilton, and to a much greater degree 
his followers, became dogmatic and intolerant (see 
[25], p. 182) and that a great deal of sterile discussion 
ensued.
The last years of Hamilton, despite his immense 
fame, were not without worries: Continentals were 
spreading rumours that the great Gauss had actually 
discovered quaternions but had never bothered to pub­
lish. (They were right, as shown by Gauss’s notes from 
1819, published in 1900; see [13], Vol. VIII, pp. 357­
362.) In letters to De Morgan of January 1852 ([15], 
Vol. II, p. 490; Vol. III, p. 330), Hamilton attacks 
these allegations. Curiously enough, of Rodrigues, 
who in 1840 not only had invented quaternions bar 
their name, but also published his formulae, there was 
never a word. Who would pay attention to a Socialist 
banker in matters mathematical?
After Hamilton’s death his work began to give fruits 
but not in the direction which he had expected. His 
ideas of vectors and of their scalar and vector products 
were much too important so that people began to try 
and graft anew skin onto them in order to make these 
concepts usable. Grassmann in Germany and Heavi­
side in Britain moved some way in this direction, but 
one must admit that they were not much more trans­
parent than Hamilton himself. It was left to Willard 
Gibbs of Yale to produce not only the first coherent 
picture of vectors and of their operations but also a 
good and successful working notation. This hardened 
the response of Hamilton’s followers, who adopted a 
truly Byzantine posture, intent on stopping the flood 
of rebellion from across the Atlantic. Thus P. G. Tait 
([36], p. vi):
Even Prof. Willard Gibbs must be ranked as one 
of the retarders of quaternion progress, in virtue 
of his pamphlet on Vector Analysis, a sort of 
hermaphrodite monster, compounded of the no­
tations of Hamilton and of Grassmann.
The kiss of life for quaternions, alas, much too late, 
came with the foundation in 1895 of an International 
Association for Promoting the Study of Quaternions 
and Allied Systems of Mathematics: an acknowledge­
ment that quaternions were a corpse in need of resus­
citation. Alexander Macfarlane, who taught at Texas, 
became the leading force of the Association, which 
actually published a Bulletin from 1900 to 1923. The 
influence of this group extended as far as Japan, where 
Kimura in 1907 became one of the major influences 
of the Association. Nothing that they did, however, 
succeeded in preventing the rise of vectors and the 
consequent decline of quaternions.
A number of applications of quaternions went on 
appearing from time to time (see [1], p. 18]). Ironi­
cally, however, by the time in the late twenties when 
quantum mechanics made the study of the rotation 
group crucial, thus giving the quaternions their real 
raison d’etre, they had been submerged for much too 
long in the murky waters of their battle against vec­
tors to be able to come to the surface again. They are 
much too useful in this context, though, for their time 
not to return.
There is a moral to this story: Rodrigues’s applied 
mathematics yields a more accurate picture of the 
quaternions than that afforded by the pure mathemat­
ics of their inventor: it is probably a myth that pure 
mathematics is either born or can stand entirely on 
its own, although the aesthetic appeal of pure mathe­
matics makes us often think otherwise.
Epilogue
After this article was communicated, a book was 
announced which contains new information about 
Rodrigues. This is the Dictionnaire du Judaisme 
Bordelais aux XVIIIe et XIXe Siecles, by Jean Cavi- 
gnac (Archives Departementales de La Gironde, Bor­
deaux, 1987). This book contains a family tree of Ro­
drigues, which shows that his great-grandfather, Isaac 
Rodrigues-Henriques, was born in Spain, around 
1689-1691 and died in Bordeaux in 1767. He was 
indeed a banker but, contrary to previous belief, 
Olinde’s father was an accountant. Surprisingly, the 
so-far universally accepted date of birth of Rodrigues 
is not right (so that the extraordinary coincidence 
with the day of the discovery of quaternions becomes 
a second-order effect). The correct date is 6 October 
1795, and this is now unimpeachable, since his birth 
certificate is fully transcribed in a paper on Rodrigues 
by Paul Courteault (Un Bordelais Saint-Simonien) 
which I, like most people so far, had missed, since it 
was published in an obscure journal (Revue Philo- 
matique de Bordeaux, Octobre-Decembre 1925, 
pp. 151-166). In accordance to this certificate, the 
date of birth was 14 vendemiare in the year IV of 
the Republic, at 1 p.m. Courteault (and Cavignac), 
instead, both agree with Michaud’s date of death, 
26.12.1850. Courteault also gives evidence that, al­
though Olinde tried to enter the Ecole Normale, he 
did not succeed in so doing, being prevented by his 
religion, so that how he learnt his advanced mathe­
matics remains an unsolved mystery. Even worse, it

appears that Rodrigues did not even attend the local 
secondary school (Lycee) at Bordeaux, so that we 
do not yet know anything at all about his formative 
years. It is of some value, however, that some of the 
traditional wisdom about this period, as repeated, I 
am afraid, in my paper, is now known to be worthless.

Building an International Reputation:
The Case of J. J. Sylvester (1814-1897)
KAREN HUNGER PARSHALL AND EUGENE SENETA
American Mathematical Monthly 104 (1997), 210-222
James Joseph Sylvester—prolific, gifted, flamboyant, 
egocentric, cantankerous. At the time of his death 
in London on 15 March 1897, Sylvester’s reputation 
internationally as one of the nineteenth century’s prin­
cipal mathematical figures had long been secure. He 
had worked hard to assure this. Obviously, he had 
done much seminal work in building the theory of in­
variants, and this had contributed to his renown. Yet, 
Sylvester had felt compelled to establish ties directly 
with mathematicians at home—but more importantly 
abroad—in order to make his name known. Was this 
just a matter of egocentrism, or did other factors con­
tribute to his international focus? What did it take to 
become an internationally recognized British mathe­
matician in the latter half of the nineteenth century, 
when first France and then Germany very much set 
the mathematical standard? Why was this even im­
portant? As the centenary of Sylvester’s death brings 
historians and mathematicians together in England 
to celebrate his life and research, we examine some 
of the reasons why Sylvester valued the international 
mathematical arena so highly and how he used it to 
his advantage during the course of his career.
It is well known that Sylvester, as a Jew, was, like 
all non-Anglicans, debarred by the Test Acts from 
taking the Cambridge degree he had earned as Sec­
ond Wrangler in 1837 and from holding a Cambridge 
fellowship or professorship. His first position, the pro­
fessorship of natural philosophy at non-sectarian Uni­
versity College London, was too far from his real in­
terests and expertise to satisfy him, so he gave itup in 
1841 after only three years for the uncertain fortunes 
of a professorship of mathematics in exile far from 
home (and, he quickly came to think, far from civiliza­
tion!) at the University of Virginia. He lasted there for 
four-and-a-half months before resigning over a matter

of principle and fleeing northward to New York City 
and his brother’s home. From there, he tried in vain 
for some eighteen months to secure a new position in 
the United States—at Columbia College, at Harvard 
with Benjamin Peirce, in the Washington, D.C. area, 
and even at the University of South Carolina—before 
returning to England to resume what he termed the 
“fruitless and hopeless struggle with an adverce [sic] 
tide of affairs” [39]. By the close of 1844, though, he 
proudly reported having “recovered [his] footing in 
the world’s slippery path” [39] thanks to his assump­
tion of the post of actuary and secretary at the Equity 
and Law Life Assurance Company in London.
During the decade from 1845 to 1855, he prepared 
for and passed the Bar; he met his mathematical alter 
ego, Arthur Cayley; and he produced his ground­
breaking series of papers in what would come to 
be known as invariant theory. The next fifteen years 
found him in his first sustained academic post, the 
professorship of mathematics at the Royal Military 
Academy in Woolwich, where he taught drudgerous 
mathematics to mostly uncaring students and fought 
with the military authorities over teaching loads des­
tined, he was convinced, to bring the “extinction of 
my scientific existence” [40]. Sylvester’s career tra­
jectory clearly diverged from those guided within the 
ivy-covered walls of the colleges of Cambridge and 
Oxford.
As an establishment-outsider, who, unlike Augus­
tus De Morgan, did not even hold a position at 
the leading anti-establishment institution, how was 
Sylvester to secure the reputation that his healthy- 
sized ego demanded and that his manifest mathemat­
ical talents warranted? Surely, the British Association 
for the Advancement of Science or the Royal Society, 
to which he had been elected in 1839, represented

avenues toward the establishment of national recog­
nition, and Sylvester presented his work-like ac­
counts of his research on Sturm’s theorem for lo­
cating the roots of an algebraic equation ([1], I: 
59-60 and 429-586)—before both of these orga­
nizations throughout his career. In Sylvester’s Pla- 
tonistic view, however, mathematics was a universal 
endeavor that transcended national boundaries (see 
[24] for an analysis). Moreover, as Sylvester well re­
alized, the Continent—and particularly France and 
Germany—dominated mathematical research at mid­
century, while England tended to assume a more iso­
lationist posture. It was thus important to make one’s 
work known abroad. This would help assure that 
credit was given where due, that results published 
in British journals were not ignored or overlooked 
outside England, and that British mathematicians ef­
fectively contributed to building the eternal edifice of 
mathematics. As Marin Mersenne had shown in the 
seventeenth century, establishing an international net­
work of correspondents could be remarkably helpful 
in achieving these goals.
Sylvester actively sought to forge his own inter­
national mathematical connections beginning around 

222
Algebra and Number Theory
1850. Initially, at least, he seemed to have the greatest 
number of ties with France, a country which had dom­
inated mathematics and the sciences during the first 
half of the nineteenth century [14], a country with 
whose language Sylvester felt at ease, a country with 
an influential scientific society and mathematicians of 
the highest repute. In France, Sylvester enjoyed per­
haps his most lasting and most intimate mathematical 
association with Charles Hermite.
Eight years Sylvester’s junior, Hermite had come 
upon the mathematical scene in the 1840s with work 
on elliptic and hyperelliptic functions that had earned 
Jacobi’s admiration. In 1848, the year after taking his 
baccalaureat and licence, he was named repetiteur 
and admissions examiner at the Ecole Polytechnique, 
where he himself had pursued his studies. Rather 
quickly, he established a reputation as one of the ris­
ing stars in French mathematics with his work on 
quadratic forms and, beginning in 1854, on the the­
ory of invariants. His election to the Paris Academie 
des Sciences in 1856 gives a clear indication of his 
stature in the French scientific community. Since Her­
mite’s research interests fundamentally overlapped 
those of Sylvester, it is little wonder that the En­
glishman sought out the kindred French mathemati­
cal spirit. In particular, Sylvester wanted to make sure 
that Hermite knew of and gave the proper credit to 
his research.
Charles Hermite, aged 25, by Charles Wittman, 
from Oeuvres de Charles Hermite
After finishing his law studies in 1850 and fol­
lowing the establishment of his close personal 
friendship and mathematical exchange with Arthur 
Cayley, Sylvester finally began to come into his own 
as a researcher. Between 1850 and 1854, he published 
much of his work on determinants as well as some 
of his seminal papers on the emergent theory of in­
variants. The year 1852, in particular, witnessed the 
publication of his first major contribution to invariant 
theory, his paper, “On the Principle of the Calculus 
of Forms” ([1], I: 284-327 and 328-363). Sylvester 
earnestly desired that this work not escape the imme­
diate notice of the French mathematical community, 
and, to this end, he wrote several letters in 1852 to 
his correspondent, Irenee-Jules Bienayme (compare 
[20]), asking him to distribute offprints to certain key 
individuals in addition to the Societe Philomatique de 
Paris, to which Sylvester had been elected as a corre­
sponding member early that year, and to the Institut 
de France.
According to Bienayme’s handwritten tally [2] in 
response to Sylvester’s first request on 7 February 
1852 [31], Michel Chasles, Charles Hermite, Olry 
Terquem, Eugene Catalan, Joseph Serret, and Joseph 
Bertrand were to receive copies of the first installment 
of Sylvester’s latest pronouncement on the calculus 
of forms ([1], I: 284-327) as well as an 1851 paper, 
“On the General Theory of Associated Forms” ([1], 
I: 198-202), while Cauchy and the Institut de France 
were to get these together with a paper on the theory 
of determinants ([1], I: 241-250). Bienayme dutifully 
delivered these and received additional requests from 
Sylvester on 4 June [32] and again on 27 August [33] 
to deliver more papers to these and selected others. 
Sylvester’s letter of4 June revealed at least one addi­
tional motivation for this general distribution of his 
work. There, he asked Bienayme to pass copies of 
the second installment of his paper on the calculus 
of forms to Hermite and to the Societe Philomatique 
as before, but this time he also wanted a copy to go 
to the editor of the Journal des Mathematiques Pures 
et Appliquees, Joseph Liouville. As he explained to 
Bienayme,
I wish M. Liouville to have a copy because I 
am told that M. Eisenstein of Berlin has sent to 
Liouville’s Journal the same kind of matter as is 
in my Section VI [32].
This was the demonstration of the sufficiency of 
two particular differential operators that Cayley and 
Sylvester employed for detecting invariants ([1], I: 
351-360), and Sylvester clearly wanted Liouville 
to know that he and Cayley—and not Eisenstein— 
had discovered the properties of these operators first. 
Eisenstein did not end up publishing the contested 
proof [11].

As Sylvester’s delivery list to Bienayme also in­
dicates, the Englishman’s association with Michel 
Chasles dates from at least the early 1850s. Chasles, 
who had established his reputation as both a ge­
ometer and an historian of mathematics as early as 
1837 with the publication of his Apercu Historique 
sur l’Origine et le Developpement des Methodes en 
Geometrie, had been named to the chair of higher 
geometry at the Sorbonne in 1846 and had become 
a full member of the Paris Academie des Sciences in 
1851. He was thus another influential member of the 
French mathematical community and a worthy con­
tact for Sylvester to establish, even though his brand 
of geometric research was never Sylvester’s forte. In 
1852, as Sylvester was busy with the early invariant- 
theoretic work that he was anxious for Bienayme to 
deliver to Chasles, Chasles had just published a new 
book, his Traite de Geometrie Superieure [81], and 
asked Sylvester to serve as the messenger for two 
copies to British colleagues [7]. In his letter of 26 
August, Chasles also provided Sylvester with an indi­
cation that he was starting to make a name for himself 
in France. Chasles reported that ([7], our translation) 
I saw M. Terquem yesterday; he spoke to me 
with pleasure and enthusiasm of the beautiful 
theorem that you sent him, and knowing that I 
was going to write you, he asked me to give you 
his compliments and to tell you that he was going 
to publish your communication without delay in 
his journal.
Olry Terquem was the editor of the Nouvelles Annales 
de Mathematiques, and the submission in question 
was Sylvester’s first publication in a foreign journal, 
his determinant-theoretic proof of the fact that if A 
is an n x n symmetric matrix, then the roots of the 
characteristic equation of Ap for p an integer are the 
roots of the characteristic equation ofA, each raised 
to the pth power ([1], I: 364-366). Sylvester quickly 
followed this with two more notes to Terquem’s jour­
nal ([1], I: 413 and 424-428). Having successfully 
taken the step of bringing his work directly before 
the Continental audience by publishing in a foreign 
journal, Sylvester continued throughout his career 
to submit his work to periodicals both at home and 
abroad.

Algebra and Number Theory
Besides Hermite, Bienayme, and Chasles, 
Sylvester also established ties in the 1850s in France 
with Jean-Victor Poncelet, Jean-Marie-Constant 
Duhamel, Joseph Serret, and Joseph Bertrand. Rela­
tive to Germany, however, his contacts were initially 
fewer and his relations never as close. One excep­
tion to this was Carl Borchardt, who had spent the 
year from 1846 to 1847 studying in Paris and forg­
ing his own links with Chasles, Hermite, and Liou- 
ville. Borchardt had earned his doctorate under Ja­
cobi at the University of Konigsberg in 1843 and 
had made a splash in 1846 with his first mathemat­
ical publication, a work right up Sylvester’s math­
ematical alley. Borchardt had given a determinant- 
theoretic argument showing that the Sturm functions 
that arise from the equation determining the secular 
disturbances of the planets can be represented as the 
sum of squares [4]. In subsequent work, he consid­
ered related algebraic questions involving symmetric 
functions and elimination theory, that also actively 
engaged Sylvester. Given their common interests, it 
is little wonder that Sylvester and Borchardt began 
to correspond. It is also little wonder that, in 1852, 
Sylvester wanted to apprise Borchardt of his latest 
researches.
On 20 February, just two weeks after he had en­
trusted Bienayme with the bundle of offprints for 
distribution in Paris, Sylvester wrote Borchardt en­
closing a copy of one of the same papers, the first 
installment of his paper “On the Principle of the Cal­
culus of Forms.” Burdened by his ongoing prepara­
tion of Jacobi’s collected works and by his teaching 
duties as Privatdozent at the University of Berlin, 
Borchardt only responded to Sylvester’s letter on 6 
April [3]. There, he apologized for the delay in his 
response and for not having had a chance to read and 
study Sylvester’s latest achievement. More interest­
ingly, he also returned to a topic that had apparently 
been under discussion in earlier letters between the 
two men: the integrity of Otto Hesse.
Because the early 1850s were abundantly produc­
tive years for Sylvester mathematically, it was then 
that he actively sought to build and solidify his in­
creasingly deserved reputation. Always touchy about 
matters of priority, but perhaps most touchy during 
these early years, Sylvester came to feel that Hesse 
[18] had stolen a result he had published in the Philo- 
sophicalMagazine in 1841 ([1], I: 75-85). Sylvester, 
furious, felt that Hesse had consciously failed to credit 
his work and lambasted him in print in ([1], I: 184­
197 on p. 189). In his letter, however, Borchardt of­
fered a very different read on the situation. In his 
measured and more objective view, Borchardt offered 
that
[i]f Mr. Hesse had known of your memoir... he 
would not have committed plagiarism, and I 
know him too well to believe him capable of 
it. This changes nothing relative to your prior­
ity but much relative to the moral judgment on 
Mr. Hesse. In mathematics it often happens that, 
owing to an insufficient knowledge of the liter­
ature, results are published as new which have 
already been obtained earlier by others. Such 
oversights must certainly be corrected, but if in 
every such case of this kind one claimed plagia­
rism, one would not be justified ([3], our trans­
lation).
This dispassionate assessment of the situation as 
well as Sylvester’s heated reaction to what he deemed 
to be Hesse’s initial slight reflect a key aspect of 
reputation-building, the paramount importance of pri­
ority. Without it, someone else’s reputation may grow 
incrementally at the expense of one’s own hard work 
and effort. In Sylvester’s case, this became even more 
of an issue when publications serving primarily dif­
ferent national constituencies were involved. If Hesse 
read the Philosophical Magazine, a periodical that 
published, by and large, mathematical work of lesser 
quality than its German counterparts, then he had 
overlooked Sylvester’s paper. If he—and by exten­
sion his countrymen—did not read the Philosophical 
Magazine, then all the worse for those British math­
ematicians trying conscientiously to make their work 
known to the broader community of mathematicians 
through that means. At least in this case, the prior­
ity dispute was ultimately little more than a tempest 
in a teapot; just two years later, at a crucial junc­
ture in Sylvester’s career, Hesse served as one of the 
Englishman’s hand-picked references.
By 1854, Sylvester had been in his job as actu­
ary and secretary at Equity Law and Life for some 
nine years. He had also been doing some of his best 
mathematical research and, understandably, wanted a 
position more consonant with his interests and train­
ing. When the professorship of mathematics at the 
Royal Military Academy in Woolwich came open, 
then, he quite naturally took the opportunity to apply. 
When he lost out on the appointment to a mathe­
matically inferior candidate and felt that the mili­
tary authorities had misrepresented some of the facts 
surrounding the election, he wrote to another long­
time acquaintance, the former Lord Chancellor, Lord 
Brougham, expressing his frustration. Not without

225
a certain amount of pride, Sylvester let Brougham 
know that
Letters were written or sent in in support of 
my application and couched in the strongest 
language in which a recommendation could be 
clothed from
Sir William Hamilton, Dublin
Professor Graves, D[itt]o
Professor Kelland, Edinburgh 
Professor Challis, Cambridge 
The Bishop of Natal
General Poncelet, Paris
M. Chasles, Paris
Rev[eren]d Geo Salmon, Dublin
Duhamel, Paris
Serret, Hermite, Bertrand of the Examiners at 
the Polytechnique
and many others.
Letters were also written but too late to be sent 
in by
the great Lejeune Dirichlet, Berlin
Professors Peters & Hesse, Konigsberg 
Professor Joachimsthal, Halle
Professor Thomson, Glasgow
and also from distinguished pupils testifying to 
my teaching powers [34].
As is evident from this roster, Sylvester made im­
portant use of the international network he had estab­
lished, in his attempt to break into the English aca­
demic world. This first try proved unsuccessful, but, 
when the victorious candidate died unexpectedly af­
ter only a few months on the job, Sylvester reapplied 
and won the appointment (see [28] on the changing 
London mathematical scene). His distinguished list 
of referees may not have helped him get the post, but 
it apparently did not hurt. Sylvester had finally broken 
back into academe after a dozen years away.
The late 1850s and early 1860s found Sylvester 
hard at work on his ongoing researches in invariant 
theory and in new, but not unrelated, work in combina­
torics. In a series of seven lectures delivered at King’s 
College, London between 6 June and 11 July 1859 
(but published only in 1897), he brought together a 
large number of known and new combinatorial results 
in an early effort to systematize a theory of parti­
tions ([1], II: 119-175). Prior to delivering the last of 
these lectures, Sylvester wrote to his friend, Pafnuty 
Chebyshev, thanking him for the elucidating remarks 
on some of Euler’s work on partitions that enabled 
him to include a discussion of it in his presentation 
[38]. Sylvester and Chebyshev had known each other 
at least since the fall of 1852, when Chebyshev was on 
a foreign tour to study the scientific and technologi­
cal advances in evidence in Paris, London, and Berlin. 
After seeing Bienayme and others in Paris, he went on 
to visit Sylvester in London, and the two remained in 
touch sporadically for many years thereafter. In fact, 
like Sylvester, Chebyshev also maintained his contact 
with Hermite. As the Russian mathematician would 
later recollect,
[w]e were once sitting in Paris, the three of us: 
Hermite, Sylvester, and I. Hermite—the leading 
mathematician of France, Sylvester—the lead­
ing mathematician of England, and I ([15], our 
translation).
Sylvester’s growing international network also 
extended to Italy by the early 1860s to include 
Enrico Betti, fellow determinant-theorist Francesco 
Brioschi, and physicist and later Minister of Educa­
tion, Carlo Matteucci, among others. In the winter 
of 1862, in fact, Sylvester followed one of his many 
trips to Paris with an extended scientific tour of the 
newly unified Italy and described at least part of his 
itinerary in a letter to Cayley [36]. Here, Sylvester 
entered into a different role relative to his interna­
tional network; his interest—as well as that of other 
foreign mathematicians—in the post-unification Ital­
ian scene helped to legitimize the research efforts of 
the Italians in the latter half of the nineteenth century 
([5] and [22]). Sylvester’s presence helped the Italians 
establish their reputations; by the early 1860s, his rep­
utation, at least in their eyes, was already secure. This 
was apparently true elsewhere as well.
Late in 1863, Sylvester received what must have 
been the most significant symbol of his international 
stature as a mathematician, his election as foreign 
correspondent to the Paris Academie des Sciences. 
It was his contact, Joseph Bertrand, whom Sylvester 
chose to communicate one of his first “official” works 
to the assembled savants, and that communication 
related to his (the first) proof of Newton’s rule for 
isolating pairs of complex roots of polynomial equa­
tions ([1], II: 361-362). As Sylvester explained to 
Bertrand,
I have proved, not without some difficulty, 
Newton’s rule to the fifth degree inclusive. 
Messers De Morgan and Cayley have expressed 
to me their firm conviction that Newton himself 
never had a proof of this rule, which remains to 
this day the marvel and the disgrace of Algebra 
([30], our translation).
Interestingly, Sylvester announced the result in 
print first in France, but only after having read the 

226
Algebra and Number Theory
paper before the Royal Society; he later published 
the full exposition of it in the Philosophical Trans­
actions ([1], II: 376-479). In so doing, he was, in a 
sense, maximizing the publicity for the new result; 
he gave it to the most important scientific bodies in 
both his native England and in France. Moreover, af­
ter the founding of the London Mathematical Society 
in 1865, he took yet another opportunity to highlight 
his work on the rule by lecturing at one of the Soci­
ety’s early meetings on the proof he had subsequently 
discovered of the general case ([1], II: 498-513).
This mathematical triumph was followed in the late 
1860s through the mid-1870s by a troubled period 
which found Sylvester first casting about for mathe­
matical direction, next in premature retirement from 
his post at the Military Academy, and then adrift and 
unemployed in London. All of this changed in 1876, 
when he accepted the first professorship of mathe­
matics at The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, 
Maryland. He had made a bold transatlantic move as 
a young man of twenty-eight; in 1876, at the age of 
sixty-one, he did it again. The second time around the 
outcome was much more positive.
Sylvester’s arrival on American shores marked the 
beginning of a quarter-century-long process of es­
tablishing mathematics at the research level in the 
United States [27]. By 1877, Sylvester had regained 
his research footing and had reengaged in his ear­
lier invariant-theoretic researches. In particular, he 
sought to vindicate the British approach to invariant 
theory that he and Cayley had developed by providing 
a British-style proof of Gordan’s finiteness theorem 
of 1868 (on the history of this problem, see [9], [10] 
and [26]). Despite Cayley’s supposed proof in 1856 
that the number of irreducible covariants of a binary 
quintic form is infinite [6], Paul Gordan showed that 
this number is, in fact, finite for any given binary 
form [13]. Beginning in the late 1870s, Sylvester 
worked on and off to supply a British proof of Gor­
dan’s theorem. Writing to William Spottiswoode on 
19 November 1876, he made his nationalistic and per­
sonal motivations crystal clear in announcing what he 
thought was a proof of Gordan’s theorem. “The pi­
ratical Germans Clebsch and Gordan who have so 
unscrupulously done their best to rob us English of 
all the credit belonging to the discoveries made in the 
New Algebra will now suffer it is to be hoped the due 
Nemesis of their misdeeds,” Sylvester declared.
Nothing in Clebsch and Gordan is really new 
but their Cumbrous method of limiting (not de­
termining) the Invariants to any given form... I 
see a splendid vista of investigations open to 
me on this subject destined I believe to reduce 
to annihilation all that the school of Clebsch 
and Gordan, by aid of methods borrowed by 
the Germans without acknowledgement from 
Cayley and myself, have attempted on the sub­
ject ([42]; Sylvester’s emphasis).
In Sylvester’s view, this was a priority issue of the 
greatest magnitude. Virtually his entire scientific rep­
utation rested on his work in invariant theory, and the 
Germans had not only failed to give it its due, but 
also isolated and patched a major hole in the entire 
British approach. May the better theory win; this bat­
tle would be fought in the international mathematical 
arena.
In 1877, Sylvester was convinced that he had not 
only won the battle but had in some sense won the 
invariant-theoretic war against the Germans. In May 
of that year, Hermite communicated the following 
announcement to the Paris Academy ([17], p. 975, 
our translation):
Baltimore—Since my last communication, 
please inform the Academy that I have re­
solved the problem of finding the complete set of 
Groundforms for arbitrary forms in n variables.
This stunning announcement was rather quickly fol­
lowed by a retraction, but Sylvester persisted in the 
struggle for the result. In the fall of 1878, he met his 
adversary head on when he claimed again to have the 
theorem in its full generality. Once again, though, his 
claim was false.
Sylvester continued on and off to try to find a 
British-style proof of Gordan’s theorem, and, while 
he never succeeded, he also never seemed to ques­
tion the personal and nationalistic motivations be­
hind such a quest, accepting fully the reality of the 
increasingly international arena [29] in which math­
ematicians competed. When David Hilbert gave the 
first inklings in 1888 and 1889 ([19], II: 176-198) of 
the new invariant-theoretic methods he would bring 
forth in their fuller glory in 1890 ([19], II: 199­
257), Sylvester knew he had lost a major skirmish 
and conceded defeat gracefully in a letter to Felix 
Klein. Hilbert “has rendered a very good service to 
Algebra, in obtaining so simple a proof of Gordan’s 
theorem,” Sylvester told Klein, “and I should like to 
be able to congratulate him on his brilliant invention. 
What a relief from the previous methods of proof!” 
[41]. International competition was important, but it 
was also important that credit be given where due.

227
It is not hard to imagine, however, that Sylvester got 
some satisfaction from the fact that, in a real sense, 
Gordan had been bested as well!
As a professor at The Johns Hopkins University, 
Sylvester did not seek to shield his students from 
the realities of international competition like his own 
with the German invariant-theoretic school. Rather, 
he worked to instill in them his strong sense of the 
importance of international, as opposed to merely na­
tional, exposure. From his own personal experience, 
he knew how important the foreign imprimatur was to 
the establishment of real reputation. In 1881, for ex­
ample, when Sylvester and his Hopkins students were 
hard at work on what would become their ground­
breaking paper on partition theory ([1], IV: 1-81), 
one of the students, Fabian Franklin, devised a won­
derfully simple, graphical proof of Euler’s pentago­
nal number theorem [12]. Sylvester was so pleased 
by and excited about this result that he had Franklin 
write itup for communication through Hermite to the 
Paris Academy. On 29 April 1881, Hermite wrote to 
Sylvester offering his own praise for Franklin’s proof 
and giving an indication of the attention that it was 
getting in France. “It certainly will not be unpleas­
ant for you to hear that I was not the only person to 
be very interested in Mr. Franklin’s very original and 
ingenious proof,” he wrote.
Mr. Halphen, one of our most eminent young 
mathematicians,... found Franklin’s method so 
remarkable that he lectured on it in one of the re­
cent sessions of the SocietePhilomatique. Please 
tell Mr. Franklin that his talent is appreciated, 
as it deserves to be, by the mathematicians of 
the old world ([16], our translation).
Writing to Cayley perhaps on the very day he re­
ceived Hermite’s letter, Sylvester could not contain 
his pleasure over this reaction to his student’s work. 
“Hermite,” he gushed, “is overflowing with admira­
tion at the beauty of the method” [37].
Following the success of his student, Franklin, and 
in the wake of the concerted combinatorial research 
in which he had engaged all of his students [23], 
Sylvester began to feel the strain of leading Amer­
ica’s first research-level program in mathematics. In 
1883, after seven-and-a-half years in Baltimore, he 
resigned from his Hopkins professorship to assume 
the Savilian Chair of Geometry at Oxford; the repeal 
of the Universities Test Act in 1871 allowed Sylvester, 
as a non-Anglican, to hold the Oxford chair. At the 
age of sixty-nine, he returned home, his efforts at 
reputation-building having finally yielded what for 
him was the ultimate prize—the recognition of the 
Oxbridge academic establishment.
Sylvester’s career can hardly be considered typical 
of mathematicians in Victorian Britain. For one thing, 
the fact that he was Jewish initially closed many of the 
usual avenues of a mathematical career to him. Twice 
this led him to leave Britain in the hopes of greener 
pastures in the United States, to broaden his focus to 
an international arena, albeit the wrong one at least 
in the 1840s. Moreover, it forced him to look beyond 
the English academic scene for ways to establish his 
reputation in his chosen field. If he could not have 
the validation of a prestigious position at an English 
university, he could at least measure his self-worth 
in terms of an international renown—hard won and 
carefully cultivated—that the majority of the math­
ematical practitioners within the English academic 
system would never enjoy.
Another aspect of Sylvester that made him atypical 
of Victorian mathematicians was his ego. It was unde­
niably large. He wanted to be known for his research; 
he wanted his work appreciated; he was often the first 
person to pronounce his latest theorem “remarkable” 
or “beautiful.” Yet, Sylvester was much more com­
plicated than this simplistic analysis would suggest. 
He loved mathematics and believed it to be eternal 
and transcendent. He wanted to make enduring con­
tributions to it. As he explained to Lord Brougham 
in the aftermath of one of his altercations with the 
authorities at Woolwich, “I trust ...toleavealasting 
mark on ‘The Algebra of the Future’ ” [35]. This, too, 
motivated him to make connections with mathemati­
cians internationally as well as nationally. They were 
all striving toward the same goal, the construction of 
what Camille Jordan called the “temple of Algebra” 
[21] or, more generally, the temple of mathematics. 
And, even if they competed like Sylvester and Gor­
dan, they labored in common cause.
Both of these atypical aspects of Sylvester as Vic­
torian mathematician led, in his case, to the forma­
tion, maintenance, and utilization ofan international 
network. Beginning at mid-century, national math­
ematical research communities—defined in terms 
of specialized professional associations, specialized 
journals, venues for the training of future researchers, 
and the overall emphasis on the production of original 
research—were under formation in Europe and some­
what later in the United States [25]. Sylvester, also 
beginning at mid-century, seemed to have a strong 
sense of the value ofa further step in the professional 
development of mathematics, the internationalization 
of the field.

The Foundation Period in the History 
of Group Theory
JOSEPHINE E. BURNS
American Mathematical Monthly 20 (1913), 141-148.
Introduction
The earliest group notions
Henri Poincare has pointed out that the fundamental 
conception of a group is evident in Euclid’s work; 
in fact, that the foundation of Euclid’s demonstra­
tions is the group idea. Poincare establishes this as­
sertion by showing that such operations as succes­
sive superposition and rotation about a fixed axis 
presuppose the displacements of a group. However 
much the fundamental group notions were uncon­
sciously used in the work of early mathematicians, 
it was not until the latter part of the eighteenth 
century that these notions began to take life and 
develop.
The foundation period
The period of foundation of group theory as a dis­
tinct science extends from Lagrange (1770) to Cauchy 
(1844-1846), a period of seventy-five years. We find 
Lagrange considering the number of values a rational 
function can assume when the variables are permuted 
in every possible way. With this beginning the de­
velopment may be traced down through the contribu­
tions of Vandermonde, Ruffini, Abbati, Abel, Galois, 
Bertrand and Hermite, to Cauchy’s period of active 
production (1844-1846). At the beginning of this pe­
riod group theory was a discovery useful in the the­
ory of equations; at the end it existed as a distinct 
science, not yet, to be sure, entirely free but so nearly 
so that this may be called the close of the foundation 
period.
Lagrange, Ruffini, Galois
Lagrange
The contributions of Lagrange are included in his 
memoir [7], published at Berlin in 1770-1771. In this 
paper Lagrange first applies what he calls the “cal- 
cul des combinaisons” to the solution of algebraic 
equations. This is practically the theory of substitu­
tions, and he uses it to show wherein the efforts of 
his predecessors Cardan, Ferrari, Descartes, Tschirn- 
haus, Euler and Bezout fail in the case of equations 
of degree higher than the fourth. He studies the num­
ber of values a rational function can assume when its 
variables are permuted in every possible way. The the­
orem that the order of the subgroup divides the order 
of the group is implied but not explicitly proved. The 
theorem that the order ofa group of degree n divides 
n! is however explicitly stated. Lagrange does not use 
at all the notation or the terminology of group theory 
but confines himself entirely to direct applications to 
the theory of equations. He mentions the symmetric 
group of degree 4, and the four-group and the cyclic 
group of order 4 as subgroups of this group. This em­
bodies practically all of the work of Lagrange in the 
theory of substitution groups.
Ruffini
The first man to follow Lagrange and to make any 
signal progress was Paolo Ruffini, an Italian, who 
published in 1799 [9] a number of important theo­
rems in the theory of substitutions. Burkhardt [1] says 
that several fundamental concepts are implied, if not 
explicitly stated. Ruffini’s “permutation” corresponds

to the later accepted term of group and to Cauchy’s 
“system of conjugate substitutions.” These permuta­
tions he classifies as “simple” and “complex.” The 
first are of two sorts, of one cycle or of more than one 
cycle. The second he divides into three classes which 
correspond to the modern notions of (1) intransitive, 
(2) transitive imprimitive, and (3) transitive primitive. 
He enunciates the following theorems:
1. If a substitution of n letters leaves the value of a 
rational function invariant, the result of applying 
the substitution any number of times is that the 
function is left invariant.
2. The order of a substitution is the least common 
multiple of the orders of the cycles.
3. There is not necessarily a subgroup correspond­
ing to every arbitrary divisor of the order of the 
group. (This theorem he established by showing 
that there is no eight-valued, four-valued or three­
valued function on five letters.)
4. A group of degree five that contains no cycle of 
degree five cannot have its order divisible by five.
Abbati, Abel
From Ruffini to Galois, only two or three contribu­
tions of merit were made. Abbati gave the first com­
plete proof that the order of the subgroup divides the 
order of the group. This he did by putting the substi­
tutions of the group in rectangular array. Abbati also 
proved that there is no three or four-valued function 
on n letters when n is greater than five. Cauchy pub­
lished in 1815 a relatively unimportant memoir [3]. 
Abel, by using the theory of substitutions to prove 
that it is impossible to solve algebraically equations 
of degree higher than the fourth, called attention to 
this useful instrument.
Galois
Up to the time of Cauchy, Galois had done the most 
for group theory. His work was written in 1831 and 
1832, but not made public until 1846. To Galois is 
due the credit for the conception of the invariant sub­
group, for the notion of the simple group and the 
extension of the idea of primitivity. Galois first used 
the term group in its present technical sense. Several 
important theorems are due to him. Among these are 
the following:
1. The lowest possible composite order of a simple 
group is 60. [5]
2. The substitutions common to two groups form a 
group. [6]
3. If the order of a group is divisible by p, a prime, 
there is at least one substitution of order p.
4. The substitutions of a group that omit a given 
letter form a group.
Cauchy, the founder of group 
theory
Terminology
Cauchy’s work on groups is found in his Exercises 
[4], published in 1844, and in the series of articles 
published in the Paris Comptes Rendus in 1845-1846 
[2]. Cauchy defines permutation and substitution in 
the same way, but uses the latter term almost entirely. 
He uses several devices to denote a substitution, the 
most common being (x, y, z, u, v, w) where each let­
ter is replaced by the one which follows it and the last 
by the first. He defines this as a cyclic substitution.
In the article written in 1815 [7] he defines the de­
gree of a substitution as the first power of the substitu­
tion that reduces to identity, but later he also defines 
order in this way and uses the word “order” rather 
than “degree” in his subsequent work. He uses both 
the term unity and identical substitution. A trans­
position is defined and the terms similar, regular, 
inverse and permutable substitutions are found with 
their present day significance. A group he calls a “sys­
tem of conjugate substitutions,” which may be transi­
tive or intransitive. A transitive imprimitive group is 
“transitive complex.” The order of a system of conju­
gate substitutions is the number of substitutions that 
it contains. The term “divisor indicatif” is also found 
for the order of a group. Cauchy frequently transfers 
his definition of order to the theory of equations and 
speaks of the number of equal values a rational func­
tion can assume when the variables are permuted in 
every possible way. The number of distinct values of 
such a function is the index. In the early article the 
order of operation is from left to right, but in all his 
later work he reverses the order and operates from 
right to left.
The Memoir of 1815
In the paper published in 1815 the one theorem which 
is of special interest is that the number of distinct 

232
Algebra and Number Theory
values of a non-symmetric function of degree n can­
not be less than the largest prime that divides n, with­
out becoming equal to 2. This theorem is proved. He 
states the special cases, that if the degree of a func­
tion is a prime number greater than 2, the number 
of distinct values cannot be less than the degree; and 
that if the degree is 6 the number of distinct values 
cannot be less than 6. He makes special reference to 
the functions belonging to
1. the intransitive group of degree 6 and order 36;
2. the transitive imprimitive group of degree 6 and 
order 72;
3. the intransitive group of degree 6 and order 48;
4. the symmetric group of degree 5 considered as 
an intransitive group of degree 6.
The functions are as follows:
1. a1a2a3 + 2a4a5a6,
2. a1a2a3 + a4a5a6,
3. a1a2a3a4 + a5a6,
4. a1a2a3a4a5 + a6.
The Memoir of 1844
There is much more of importance in his 1844 Ex­
ercises [4]. The first theorem proved is that every 
substitution similar to a given substitution P is the 
product of three factors, the extremes of which are the 
inverse of each other and the middle term of which 
is P . Conversely, every product of three factors, the 
first and last of which are the inverse of each other, is 
similar to the middle term P .
An important formula developed is for the number 
of substitutions similar to a given substitution. If w 
is the number required, n the total number of letters 
and P the given substitution, composed of f cycles 
of order a, g cycles of order b, h cycles of order c, 
etc., and r the number of letters fixed in P, then
n!
(f!)(g!)(h!) • • • (r!)afbgch • • •
Among other theorems that he proves in this article 
are the following:
2. If P is a substitution of order i, the substitutions 
among the powers of P that are of order i are 
the powers of P whose indices are prime to i. 
These substitutions are likewise similar to P , and 
hence the number of substitutions similar to P 
among the powers of P are in number equal to 
the number of numbers less than i and prime to 
it.
3. LetP be any substitution, regular or irregular; let 
i be its order andp be any prime factor ofi. Then 
a value for i can always be found such that P  is 
a substitution of order p.
i
4. A substitution and its inverse are always similar.
5. The powers of a cycle constitute the totality of 
substitutions that transform the given cycle into 
itself.
6. The order of a system of conjugate substitutions 
is divisible by the order of each substitution.
7. Two permutable substitutions, with no common 
power but the identity, together generate a sys­
tem of conjugate substitutions whose order is 
the product of the orders of the two substitu­
tions.
8. If 1 ,Pi,p2, ••• ,pa -1 and 1,Q i,Q 2, ••• ,Qb-1 
are two groups, one of order a and the other of or­
der b, which are permutable and have no common 
terms but the identity, then the group generated 
by these groups is of order ab.
9. The converse of (8).
10. If P and Q are two substitutions, one of or­
der a and the other of order b, and if the 
two series Q,PQ,P Q, ••• ,Pa-1Q and 
Q, QP, QP , • • • , QPa-1 are made up of the 
same terms in the same or different order, then 
the cyclic group generated by P is permutable 
with the cyclic group generated by Q.

1. IfP is a substitution of order i, h any number and 
9 the highest common factor of h and i, then Ph
is of order i/9.
A most important element in establishing Cauchy’s 
claim as the founder of group theory is the proof 
which he gives of the fundamental theorem that if 
m is the order of a group and p is any prime which 
divides m, there is at least one substitution of order 
p. Galois had stated the theorem but had not proved 
it. Its importance is due to the fact that it is the first 
step toward Sylow’s theorem which appeared nearly 
thirty years later.
In this memoir there are a number of specific 
groups mentioned, although no enumeration of 

BURNS: The Foundation Period in the History of Group Theory
233
groups of special degrees is attempted. The substitu­
tions of several groups are written out. Among them 
are
1. the octic,
2. the four-group,
3. the holomorph of the cyclic group of order five,
4. the intransitive group of degree 6 and order 9,
5. the intransitive group of degree 6 and order 16.
In addition to these groups, the substitutions of which 
are given, several other groups are mentioned, among 
them
1. the holomorph of order 42,
2. the group of degree 7 and order 21,
3. the holomorph of the cyclic group of order 9.
There is also mentioned a group of degree 9 and 
order 27, generated by the two substitutions
P = x 0 x 3 x 6 • x i x 4 x 7 • x 2 x 5 x 8 and
Q = x 1 x 2 x 4 x 8 x 5 • x 3 x 6 .
This is obviously impossible but a little study of his 
method reveals that he should have used
Q = x 1 x 3 x 4 x 8 x 7 x 5 • x 3 x 6,
and that in order to get the order of the group he has 
incorrectly applied the theorems he was announcing 
and illustrating. The order of the group should be 18. 
The two theorems, which he was illustrating may be 
stated as follows:
1. If P is a substitution on n letters, P = 
x0 x 1 x2 • • • xn - 1 and if r is any number prime 
to n and if Q is a substitution derived from P by 
replacing each letter by another whose subscript 
is r times its own, then for any values ofh and k,
Qk Ph = Phr Qk.
2. If in the above theorem we take v to be any divisor 
ofn, distinct from unity, and let R be any substi­
tution that replaces any letter xl by the letter with 
the subscript l + v, then QkRh generates a group 
of order vi, where i is the smallest value ofk that 
satisfies the congruence rk = i (mod n).
Since in the present instance r is 2, i must be 6. The 
order of the group is then vi = 3 • 6=18, whereas 
Cauchy seems to take i =9and derives the order of 
the group vi = 3 • 9 = 27.
The Memoirs of 1845-1846
Some of the material in the memoirs [2] published 
in the Comptes Rendus had already appeared in [4], 
but is treated more extensively here. There is much, 
however, in the later articles that is not touched in [4]. 
It is in the later memoirs that he first defines what 
he means by a system of conjugate substitutions. The 
definition is as follows:
I shall call derived substitutions all that can arise 
from the given substitutions by multiplying them 
one or more times by each other or by them­
selves; and the given substitutions together with 
all the derived substitutions form what I shall 
call a system of conjugate substitutions.
Then follow the general theorems:
1. Ifi is the order of a substitution P and a,b,c,... 
are the prime factors of i, then the substitution 
P and its powers form a group generated by the 
substitutions
Pi/a Pi/b Pi/c ...........
2. If P, Q, R, S, ••• are the substitutions that leave 
a given function Q invariant, they form a group 
whose order is the number of equal values of Q 
when the variables are permuted in every possible 
way.
3. The order of a transitive group of degree n is n 
times the order of the subgroup that leaves one 
letter fixed.
4. IfQ is a transitive function on n letters, and ifm 
is the index of the corresponding transitive group 
under the symmetric group of degree n, then m 
will likewise be the index of the subgroup that 
leaves one letter fixed under the symmetric group 
of degree n - 1.
Intransitive groups
The general subject which Cauchy treats next is that 
of intransitive groups. He implicitly divides intransi­
tive groups into two classes. The first class includes 
those in which the systems are independent, that is, 
in our terminology, those in which the systems of 
transitivity are united by direct product. The sec­
ond class includes those in which the systems are 
dependent, that is, those in which the systems are 
united by some sort of isomorphism. The concept 
of isomorphism is however only implied. He states 

234
Algebra and Number Theory
first that an intransitive group is formed by the com­
bination in some way of transitive constituents. He 
then develops some interesting formulas for the or­
der of intransitive groups. If the systems are inde­
pendent, then the order M is the direct product of 
A, B,C, •• • the orders of the transitive constituents 
and the index will be ABC_, where n is the to­
tal number of letters. This same formula holds also 
when the systems are not independent if A, B, C, • •• 
are defined in a special way. These definitions are as 
follows:
• let A be the order of the first transitive constituent;
• let B be the number of substitutions involving let­
ters in the second system without involving any of 
the first;
• let C be the number of substitutions involving let­
ters in the third system, without involving any of 
the first or second, and so on.
With these definitions ofA,B,C,D,...the order of 
the intransitive group is M = ABC • ••.
Imprimitive groups
Cauchy next turns to imprimitive groups. Here he 
confines himself almost entirely to the consideration 
of those imprimitive groups which are simply tran­
sitive and which have for the subgroup that leaves 
one letter fixed the direct product of the transitive 
constituents. In regard to this particular type of im- 
primitive groups, he gives several theorems which are 
of interest, even though he does not touch upon the 
broader and more general principles.
If in a simply transitive group the subgroup that 
leaves one letter fixed is an intransitive group formed 
by the direct product of its transitive constituents, the 
group is imprimitive. He considers the special cases 
a>n/2,a <n/2,a= n/2 in which a is the number 
of letters in the largest transitive constituent and n is 
the degree of the group. The only theorems which he 
enunciates that apply to imprimitive groups in general 
are:
1. The number of letters in the systems of imprimi- 
tivity must be a divisor of the degree.
2. If A is the number of substitutions that permute 
the variables within the systems and K is the 
number of ways the k systems can be permuted, 
then the order of the group is KAk .
Symmetric groups
Cauchy then considers briefly symmetric groups. One 
theorem which he states with its corollaries is as 
follows:
• If a transitive group of degree n has a symmetric 
subgroup of degree a, where a>n/2, then the 
group is symmetric on n letters.
• For n > 2, a transitive group of degree n is sym­
metric if it contains a symmetric subgroup of de­
gree n - 1.
• If n > 3, a transitive group of degree n is sym­
metric if it contains a symmetric subgroup of de­
gree n - 2. The special case n =4 is excepted; 
for the octic group, belonging to the function 
Q = xy + zu, is symmetric on two letters, yet not 
symmetric on all four.
• If n > 4, a transitive group of degree n is symmet­
ric if it contains a symmetric subgroup of degree 
n - 3. The case n =6is excluded. A group re­
quiring this exception is the imprimitive group of 
degree 6 and order 72 which contains the symmet­
ric group of order 6.
• If n > 5, a transitive group of degree n is sym­
metric if it contains a symmetric subgroup of de­
gree n - 4.Ifn =6or n =8, this does not hold. 
Cauchy gives as examples of the case n =6the 
imprimitive groups of degree 6 and orders 72 and 
48.
Some implied theorems
One of the most important and interesting parts of 
Cauchy’s work on group theory is that in which he 
develops some complicated formulas from which we 
may easily deduce the theorem that the average num­
ber of letters in the substitutions ofa transitive group 
is n - 1. Cauchy himself does not enunciate the the­
orem, although he brings the proof to the point where 
only the final statement is necessary to complete it. 
The formula for the case where the group is simply 
transitive is as follows:
M = 2Hn—2 + 3Hn—3 + • • • + (n - 2) H2 + n,
where M is the order of the group, n its degree and 
Hn —r the number of substitutions involving n - r 
letters.
Further development of these formulas leads to the 
two conclusions:

BURNS: The Foundation Period in the History of Group Theory
235
1. If G is l-fold transitive of degree n, the number of 
substitutions involving n - l +1 letters is equal 
to or greater than
n(n — 1) • • • (n — l + 2) 
(n — l) l! 
;
2. If G is simply transitive, of degree n, the number 
of substitutions involving n letters is equal to or 
greater than n — 1.
We find here the assertion that if in an l-fold transi­
tive group l + 1 letters are left fixed, all are left fixed. 
That this is false is demonstrated by considering the 
imprimitive group of degree 6 and order 72. It is sim­
ply transitive and hence l =1;butl +1=2letters 
may be left fixed without all being so.
The theorem that the order of the holomorph of 
a cyclic group is the product of the orders of the 
cyclic group and its group of isomorphisms is found 
implicitly in Cauchy. He gives two theorems relative 
to this point.
1. Let P = x0x1x2 •••xn-1 be a substitution of or­
der n.Letr be a primitive root of the modulus 
n, and I be the smallest of the indices of unity 
belonging to the base r. Then let Q be the substi­
tution that replaces xi by xrij. The order of Q will 
be I and the order of the group will be nI . This 
I is nothing else than the order of the group of 
isomorphisms of the cyclic group. If n is a power 
of a prime p, then I = n(1 — 1/p). When n is a 
prime then I = n — 1.
2. With the same hypothesis as in (1), Pa and Qb, 
where a and b are divisors of n and I respectively, 
generate a group of order nI/ab.
Enumeration of orders
Cauchy was the first to attempt an enumeration of the 
possible orders of groups. This he did with a fair de­
gree of accuracy up to and including the sixth degree. 
The enumeration including degree 5 is correct and 
complete, but several errors occur in the enumeration 
of those of degree 6. For instance, 150 is given as 
the index of a group of degree 6 under the symmetric 
group, although 6! is not a multiple of 150.
Cauchy goes back to his original distinction be­
tween imprimitive groups with heads which are di­
rect products and those with heads formed by isomor­
phisms. He gives as the possible orders of groups of 
degree 6 with heads the direct products of the transi­
tive constituents 72, 48, 24, 18, 16, and 8. The last two 
numbers are clearly impossible for there is no transi­
tive group of degree 6 and order 8 or 16. The orders 
of the groups possible when the head is formed with 
isomorphisms are given as 6, 12, 4, while there is no 
imprimitive group of degree 6 and order 4. According 
to his classification there should also be included in 
this last enumeration 24 and 18. A complete omis­
sion occurs in the list of imprimitive groups since 
the groups of order 36 with two systems of imprimi- 
tivity are not mentioned. Otherwise the enumeration 
through degree 6 is correct and complete.
Errors of Cauchy
The errors in Cauchy’s work on group theory may 
he divided into two classes. The first and smaller 
class includes a number of serious errors in logic. The 
second class includes a large number of minor errors, 
some typographical, others arising through careless 
statement. All of the serious errors found have been 
noted in this paper with the exception of one to which 
attention has already been called (see [8]). He states 
an erroneous theorem on imprimitive groups in the 
following form.
If G1 is a subgroup composed of all the substi­
tutions that omit a given letter in a simply tran­
sitive group, then G is imprimitive unless all 
the transitive constituents of G1 are of the same 
degree.
Conclusion
In conclusion we may say that the foundation period 
in the history of group theory includes the time from 
Lagrange to Cauchy inclusive; that at the beginning of 
this period group theory was a means to an end and 
not an end in itself. Lagrange and Ruffini thought 
of substitution groups only in so far as they led to 
practical results in the theory of equations. Galois, 
while broadening and deepening the application to the 
theory of equations, may be considered as taking the 
initial step toward abstract group theory. In Cauchy, 
while a group is still spoken of as the substitutions 
that leave a given function invariant, and the order of a 
group is still thought of as the number of equal values 
which the function can assume when the variables are 
permuted in every possible way, nevertheless quite as 
often a group is a system of conjugate substitutions 
and its relation to any function is entirely ignored.
In Cauchy’s work it is to be noted that use is made 
of all the concepts originated by the earlier writers in 
substitution theory except those of Galois, a number 

236
Algebra and Number Theory
of which would have proved powerful instruments in 
his hands, notably the idea of the invariant subgroup 
of which he makes no explicit use.
Because of the important theorems Cauchy proved, 
because of the break which he made in separating the 
theory of substitutions from the theory of equations, 
and because of the importance that he attached to the 
theory itself, he deserves the credit as the founder of 
group theory.

The Evolution of Group Theory: 
A Brief Survey
ISRAEL KLEINER
Mathematics Magazine 59 (1986), 195-215
This article gives a brief sketch of the evolution of 
group theory. It derives from a firm conviction that 
the history of mathematics can be a useful and impor­
tant integrating component in the teaching of mathe­
matics. This is not the place to elaborate on the role 
of history in teaching, other than perhaps to give one 
relevant quotation (C. H. Edwards [11]):
Although the study of the history of mathemat­
ics has an intrinsic appeal of its own, its chief 
raison d’etre is surely the illumination of mathe­
matics itself. For example the gradual unfolding 
of the integral concept from the volume compu­
tations of Archimedes to the intuitive integrals of 
Newton and Leibniz and finally to the definitions 
of Cauchy, Riemann and Lebesgue—cannot fail 
to promote a more mature appreciation of mod­
ern theories of integration.
The presentation in one article of the evolution of 
so vast a subject as group theory necessitated severe 
selectivity and brevity. It also required omission of 
the broader contexts in which group theory evolved, 
such as wider currents in abstract algebra, and in 
mathematics as a whole. (We will note some of these 
interconnections shortly.) We trust that enough of the 
essence and main lines of development in the evolu­
tion of group theory have been retained to provide a 
useful beginning from which the reader can branch 
out in various directions. For this the list of references 
will prove useful.
The reader will find in this article an outline of 
the origins of the main concepts, results, and theo­
ries discussed in a beginning course on group the­
ory. These include, for example, the concepts of 
(abstract) group, normal subgroup, quotient group, 
simple group, free group, isomorphism, homomor­
phism, automorphism, composition series, direct 
product; the theorems of J. L. Lagrange, A.-L. 
Cauchy, A. Cayley, C. Jordan-O. Holder; the theo­
ries of permutation groups and of abelian groups. At 
the same time we have tried to balance the technical 
aspects with background information and interpreta­
tion.
Our survey of the evolution of group theory will 
be given in several stages, as follows:
1. Sources of group theory.
2. Development of “specialized” theories of groups.
3. Emergence of abstraction in group theory.
4. Consolidation of the abstract group concept; dawn 
of abstract group theory.
5. Divergence of developments in group theory.
Before dealing with each stage in turn, we wish to 
mention the context within mathematics as a whole, 
and within algebra in particular, in which group the­
ory developed. Although our story concerning the 
evolution of group theory begins in 1770 and extends 
to the twentieth century, the major developments oc­
curred in the nineteenth century. Some of the general 
mathematical features of that century which had a 
bearing on the evolution of group theory are:
(a) an increased concern for rigor;
(b) the emergence of abstraction;
(c) the rebirth of the axiomatic method;
(d) the view of mathematics as a human activity, pos­
sible without reference to, or motivation from, 
physical situations.

Algebra and Number Theory
Each of these items deserves extensive elaboration, 
but this would go beyond the objectives (and size) of 
this paper.
Up to about the end of the eighteenth century, al­
gebra consisted (in large part) of the study of solu­
tions of polynomial equations. In the twentieth cen­
tury, algebra became a study of abstract, axiomatic 
systems. The transition from the so-called classi­
cal algebra of polynomial equations to the so-called 
modern algebra of axiomatic systems occurred in the 
nineteenth century. In addition to group theory, there 
emerged the structures of commutative rings, fields, 
non-commutative rings, and vector spaces. These de­
veloped alongside, and sometimes in conjunction 
with, group theory. Thus Galois theory involved both 
groups and fields; algebraic number theory contained 
elements of group theory in addition to commuta­
tive ring theory and field theory; group representation 
theory was a mix of group theory, non-commutative 
algebra, and linear algebra.
1 Sources of group theory
There are four major sources in the evolution of group 
theory. They are (with the names of the originators 
and dates of origin):
(a) Classical algebra (J. L. Lagrange, 1770)
(b) Number theory (C. F. Gauss, 1801)
(c) Geometry (F. Klein, 1874)
(d) Analysis (S. Lie, 1874; H. Poincare and F Klein, 
1876)
We deal with each in turn.
(a) Classical algebra (J. L. Lagrange, 1770) The ma­
jor problems in algebra at the time (1770) that La­
grange wrote his fundamental memoir Reflexions sur 
la Resolution Algebrique des liquations concerned 
polynomial equations. There were theoretical ques­
tions dealing with the existence and nature of the 
roots (e.g., Does every equation have a root? How 
many roots are there? Are they real, complex, posi­
tive, negative?), and practical questions dealing with 
methods for finding the roots. In the latter instance 
there were exact methods and approximate methods. 
In what follows we mention exact methods.
The Babylonians knew how to solve quadratic 
equations (essentially by the method of completing 
the square) around 1600 B.C. Algebraic methods for 
solving the cubic and the quartic were given around 
1540. One of the major problems for the next two 
centuries was the algebraic solution of the quintic. 
This is the task Lagrange set for himself in his paper 
of 1770.
In his paper Lagrange first analyzes the various 
known methods (devised by F Viete, R. Descartes, 
L. Euler, and E. Bezout) for solving cubic and quar­
tic equations. He shows that the common feature 
of these methods is the reduction of such equa­
tions to auxiliary equations—the so-called resolvent 
equations. The latter are one degree lower than the 
original equations. Next Lagrange attempts a simi­
lar analysis of polynomial equations of arbitrary de­
gree n. With each such equation he associates a re­
solvent equation as follows: let f (x) be the origi­
nal equation, with roots x1 ,x2 ,...,xn .Pickara- 
tional function R(x1 ,x2 ,...,xn) of the roots and 
coefficients of f (x). (Lagrange describes methods 
for doing so.) Consider the different values which 
R(x1 ,x2,...,xn) assumes under all the n! permuta­
tions of the roots x1 ,x2 ,...,xn off(x). If these are 
denoted by y1 ,y2 ,...,yk then the resolvent equation 
is given by
g (x ) = ( x - y 1) • (x - y 2) ••• (x - yk).
(Lagrange shows that k divides n!—the source of 
what we call Lagrange’s theorem in group theory.) For 
example, iff(x) is a quartic with roots x1 ,x2,x3,x4, 
then R(x1 ,x2,x3,x4) may be taken to be x1x2 + 
x3x4, and this function assumes three distinct values 
under the 24 permutations ofx1 ,x2 ,x3 ,x4. Thus the 
resolvent equation of a quartic is a cubic. However, 
in carrying over this analysis to the quintic, he finds 
that the resolvent equation is of degree six!
Although Lagrange did not succeed in resolving 
the problem of the algebraic solvability of the quin­
tic, his work was a milestone. It was the first time 
that an association was made between the solutions 
of a polynomial equation and the permutations of its 
roots. In fact, the study of the permutations of the 
roots ofan equation was a cornerstone of Lagrange’s 
general theory of algebraic equations. This, he spec­
ulated, formed “the true principles for the solution 
of equations.” (He was, of course, vindicated in this 
by E. Galois.) Although Lagrange speaks of permu­
tations without considering a calculus of permuta­
tions (e.g., there is no consideration of their compo­
sition or closure), it can be said that the germ of the 
group concept (as a group of permutations) is present 
in his work. For details see [12], [16], [19], [25], 
[33].
(b) Number Theory. (C. F. Gauss, 1801) In the Dis- 
quisitiones Arithmeticae of 1801 Gauss summarized 

KLEINER: The Evolution of Group Theory: A Brief Survey
239
and unified much of the number theory that pre­
ceded him. The work also suggested new directions 
which kept mathematicians occupied for the entire 
century. As for its impact on group theory, the Dis- 
quisitiones may be said to have initiated the theory of 
finite abelian groups. In fact, Gauss established many 
of the significant properties of these groups with­
out using any of the terminology of group theory. 
The groups appear in four different guises: the addi­
tive group of integers modulo m, the multiplicative 
group of integers relatively prime to m (modulo m), 
the group of equivalence classes of binary quadratic 
forms, and the group of nth roots of unity. And though 
these examples appear in number-theoretic contexts, 
it is as abelian groups that Gauss treats them, us­
ing what are clear prototypes of modern algebraic 
proofs.
For example, considering the non-zero integers 
modulo p (p a prime), Gauss shows that they are 
all powers of a single element; i.e., that the group Z* 
of such integers is cyclic. Moreover, he determines 
the number of generators of this group (he shows that 
it is equal to 0(p - 1), where 0 is Euler’s 0-function). 
Given any element of Z* he defines the order of the 
element (without using the terminology) and shows 
that the order of an element is a divisor of p - 1. 
He then uses this result to prove P. Fermat’s little 
theorem—namely, that ap-1 = 1 (mod p) if p does 
not divide a, thus employing group-theoretic ideas to 
prove number-theoretic results. Next he shows that if 
t is a positive integer which divides p - 1, then there 
exists an element in Z* whose order is t—essentially 
the converse of Lagrange’s theorem for cyclic groups.
Concerning the nth roots of 1 (which he consid­
ers in connection with the cyclotomic equation), he 
shows that they too form a cyclic group. In connec­
tion with this group he raises and answers many of 
the same questions he raised and answered in the case 
of Zp.
The problem of representing integers by binary 
quadratic forms goes back to Fermat in the early sev­
enteenth century. (Recall his theorem that every prime 
of the form 4n +1 can be represented as a sum of 
two squares x2 + y2 .) Gauss devotes a large part of 
the Disquisitiones to an exhaustive study of binary 
quadratic forms and the representation of integers by 
such forms. (A binary quadratic form is an expression 
of the form ax2 + bxy + cy2 , with a, b, c integers.) 
He defines a composition on such forms, and remarks 
that ifK and K1 are two such forms one may denote 
their composition by K + K1 . He then shows that 
this composition is associative and commutative, that 
there exists an identity, and that each form has an 
inverse, thus verifying all the properties ofan abelian 
group.
Despite these remarkable insights one should not 
infer that Gauss had the concept of an abstract group, 
or even of a finite abelian group. Although the ar­
guments in the Disquisitiones are quite general, each 
of the various types of groups he considers is dealt 
with separately—there is no unifying group-theoretic 
method which he applies to all cases. For details see 
[5], [9], [25], [30], [33].
(c) Geometry (F. Klein, 1872). We are referring here 
to Klein’s famous and influential (but see [18]) lec­
ture entitled A Comparative Review of Recent Re­
searches in Geometry, which he delivered in 1872 
on the occasion of his admission to the faculty of 
the University of Erlangen. The aim of this so-called 
Erlanger Program was the classification of geome­
try as the study of invariants under various groups 
of transformations. Here there appear groups such 
as the projective group, the group of rigid motions, 
the group of similarities, the hyperbolic group, the 
elliptic groups, as well as the geometries associated 
with them. (The affine group was not mentioned by 
Klein.) Now for some background leading to Klein’s 
Erlanger Program.
The nineteenth century witnessed an explosive 
growth in geometry, both in scope and in depth. 
New geometries emerged: projective geometry, non- 
Euclidean geometries, differential geometry, alge­
braic geometry, n-dimensional geometry, and Grass­
mann’s geometry of extension. Various geometric 
methods competed for supremacy: the synthetic ver­
sus the analytic, the metric versus the projective. At 
mid-century, a major problem had arisen—namely, 
the classification of the relations and inner connec­
tions among the different geometries and geometric 
methods.
This gave rise to the study of geometric relations, 
focusing on the study of properties of figures invari­
ant under transformations. Soon the focus shifted to 
a study of the transformations themselves. Thus the 
study of the geometric relations of figures became the 
study of the associated transformations. Various types 
of transformations (e.g., collineations, circular trans­
formations, inversive transformations, affinities) be­
came the objects of specialized studies. Subsequently, 
the logical connections among transformations were 
investigated, and this led to the problem of classify­
ing transformations and eventually to Klein’s group­
theoretic synthesis of geometry.

240
Algebra and Number Theory
Klein’s use of groups in geometry was the final 
stage in bringing order to geometry. An intermediate 
stage was the founding of the first major theory of 
classification in geometry, beginning in the 1850s, the 
Cayley-Sylvester Invariant Theory. Here the objective 
was to study invariants of forms under transforma­
tions of their variables. This theory of classification, 
the precursor of Klein’s Erlanger Program, can be said 
to be implicitly group-theoretic. Klein’s use of groups 
in geometry was, of course, explicit. (For a thorough 
analysis of implicit group-theoretic thinking in geom­
etry leading to Klein’s Erlanger Program, see [33].) In 
the next section (2(c)) we will note the significance 
of Klein’s Erlanger Program (and his other works) 
for the evolution of group theory. Since the Program 
originated a hundred years after Lagrange’s work and 
eighty years after Gauss’ work, its importance for 
group theory can best be appreciated after a discus­
sion of the evolution of group theory beginning with 
the works of Lagrange and Gauss and ending with the 
period around 1870.
Felix Klein (1849-1925)
(d) Analysis (S. Lie, 1874; H. Poincare and F Klein, 
1876) In 1874 Lie introduced his general theory 
of (continuous) transformation groups—essentially 
what we call Lie groups today. Such a group is repre­
sented by the transformations
xi = fi (x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,Xn,a 1, a 2 , ... ,On ) ,
i =1, 2,...,n,
where the fi are analytic functions in the xi and ai 
(the ai are parameters, with both xi and ai real or 
complex). For example, the transformations given by
ax + b
x = ------- -, where a,b,c,d are real numbers
cx + d
and ad - bc =0,
define a continuous transformation group.
Sophus Lie (1842-1899
Lie thought of himself as the successor of N. H. 
Abel and Galois, doing for differential equations 
what they had done for algebraic equations. His work 
was inspired by the observation that almost all the 
differential equations which had been integrated by 
the older methods remain invariant under continuous 
groups that can be easily constructed. He was then led 
to consider, in general, differential equations that re­
main invariant under a given continuous group and to 
investigate the possible simplifications in these equa­
tions which result from the known properties of the 
given group (cf. Galois theory). Although Lie did not 
succeed in the actual formulation of a “Galois theory 
of differential equations”, his work was fundamental 
in the subsequent formulation of such a theory by 
E. Picard (1883/1887) and E. Vessiot (1892).

241
Poincare and Klein began their work on automor­
phic functions and the groups associated with them 
around 1876. Automorphic functions (which are gen­
eralizations of the circular, hyperbolic, elliptic, and 
other functions of elementary analysis) are functions 
of a complex variable z, analytic in some domain D, 
which are invariant under the group of transforma­
tions
az + b 
z =---- —;
cz + d
(a, b, c, d real or complex and ad - bc =0)
or under some subgroup of this group. Moreover, the 
group in question must be discontinuous (i.e., any 
compact domain contains only finitely many trans­
forms of any point). Examples of such groups are the 
modular group (in which a, b, c, d are integers and 
ad - bc =1), which is associated with the elliptic 
modular functions, and Fuchsian groups (in which 
a, b, c, d are real and ad - bc =1) associated with 
the Fuchsian automorphic functions. As in the case 
of Klein’s Erlanger Program, we will explore the con­
sequences of these works for group theory in section 
2(c).
Henri Poincare (1854-1912)
2 Development of “specialized” 
theories of groups
In Section 1 we outlined four major sources in the 
evolution of group theory. The first source—classical 
algebra—led to the theory of permutation groups; 
the second source—number theory—led to the the­
ory of abelian groups; the third and fourth sources — 
geometry and analysis—led to the theory of transfor­
mation groups. We will now outline some develop­
ments within these specialized theories.
(a) Permutation groups As noted earlier, Lagrange’s 
work of 1770 initiated the study of permutations in 
connection with the study of the solution of equa­
tions. It was probably the first clear instance of im­
plicit group-theoretic thinking in mathematics. It led 
directly to the works of P. Ruffini, Abel, and Galois 
during the first third of the nineteenth century, and to 
the concept of a permutation group.
Ruffini and Abel proved the unsolvability of the 
quintic by building upon the ideas of Lagrange con­
cerning resolvents. Lagrange showed that a necessary 
condition for the solvability of the general polynomial 
equation of degree n is the existence of a resolvent 
of degree less than n. Ruffini and Abel showed that 
such resolvents do not exist for n>4. In the process 
they developed a considerable amount of permutation 
theory. (See [1], [9], [19], [23], [24], [25], [30], [33] 
for details.) It was Galois, however, who made the 
fundamental conceptual advances, and who is consid­
ered by many as the founder of (permutation) group 
theory.
Galois’s aim went well beyond finding a method for 
the solvability of equations. He was concerned with 
gaining insight into general principles, dissatisfied as 
he was with the methods of his predecessors: “From 
the beginning of this century,” he wrote, “compu­
tational procedures have become so complicated that 
any progress by those means has become impossible” 
([19], p. 92).
Galois recognized the separation between Galois 
theory (i.e., the correspondence between fields and 
groups) and its application to the solution of equa­
tions, for he wrote that he was presenting “the gen­
eral principles and just one application” of the theory 
([19], p. 42). “Many of the early commentators on 
Galois theory failed to recognize this distinction, and 
this led to an emphasis on applications at the expense 
of the theory” (Kiernan, [19]).
Galois was the first to use the term group in a tech­
nical sense—to him it signified a collection of permu­
tations closed under multiplication: “if one has in the

242
Algebra and Number Theory
Evariste Galois (1811-1832)
same group the substitutions S and T one is certain 
to have the substitution ST” ([33], p. 111). He recog­
nized that the most important properties of an alge­
braic equation were reflected in certain properties of 
a group uniquely associated with the equation—“the 
group of the equation.” To describe these properties 
he invented the fundamental notion of normal sub­
group and used it to great effect. While the issue of 
resolvent equations preoccupied Lagrange, Ruffini, 
and Abel, Galois’s basic idea was to bypass them, 
for the construction of a resolvent required great skill 
and was not based on a clear methodology. Galois 
noted instead that the existence of a resolvent was 
equivalent to the existence of a normal subgroup of 
prime index in the group of the equation. This insight 
shifted consideration from the resolvent equation to 
the group of the equation and its subgroups. Galois 
defines the group of an equation as follows ([19], 
p. 80):
Let an equation be given, whose m roots are 
a,b,c,... There will always be a group of per­
mutations of the letters a,b,c,... which has the 
following property:
1. that every function of the roots, invariant 
under the substitutions of that group, is ra­
tionally known [i.e., is a rational function 
of the coefficients and any adjoined quan­
tities].
2. 
conversely, that every function of the roots,
which can be expressed rationally, is invari­
ant under these substitutions.
The definition says essentially that the group of 
the equation consists of those permutations of the 
roots of the equation which leave invariant all rela­
tions among the roots over the field of coefficients of 
the equation—basically the definition we would give 
today. Of course the definition does not guarantee the 
existence of such a group, and so Galois proceeds 
to demonstrate it. Galois next investigates how the 
group changes when new elements are adjoined to 
the ground field F . His treatment is amazingly close 
to the standard treatment of this matter in a modern 
algebra text.
Galois’s work was slow in being understood and 
assimilated. In fact, while it was done around 1830, 
it was published posthumously in 1846, by J. Liou- 
ville. Beyond his technical accomplishments, Galois 
(Wussing, [33])
challenged the development of mathematics in 
two ways. He discovered, but left unproved, the­
orems which called for proofs based on new, so­
phisticated concepts and calculations. Also, the 
task of filling the gaps in his work necessitated 
a fundamental clarification of his methods and 
their group theoretical essence.
For details see [12], [19], [23], [25], [29], [31], [33].
The other major contributor to permutation theory 
in the first half of the nineteenth century was Cauchy. 
In several major papers in 1815 and 1844 Cauchy 
inaugurated the theory of permutation groups as an 
autonomous subject. (Before Cauchy, permutations 
were not an object of independent study but rather 
a useful device for the investigation of solutions of 
polynomial equations.) Although Cauchy was well 
aware of the work of Lagrange and Ruffini (Galois’s 
work was not yet published at the time), Wussing sug­
gests that Cauchy “was definitely not inspired directly 
by the contemporary group-theoretic formulation of 
the solution of algebraic equations” [33].
In these works Cauchy gives the first systematic de­
velopment of the subject of permutation groups. In the 
1815 papers Cauchy uses no special name for sets of 
permutations closed under multiplication. However, 

KLEINER: The Evolution of Group Theory: A Brief Survey
243
he recognizes their importance and gives a name to 
the number of elements in such a closed set, calling 
it “diviseur indicatif”. In the 1844 paper he defines 
the concept of a group of permutations generated by 
certain elements ([22], p. 65):
Given one or more substitutions involving some 
or all of the elements x,y,z,... I call the prod­
ucts of these substitutions, by themselves or by 
any other, in any order, derived substitutions. 
The given substitutions, together with the de­
rived ones, form what I call a system of conjugate 
substitutions.
In these works, which were very influential, 
Cauchy makes several lasting additions to the termi­
nology, notation, and results of permutation theory. 
For example, he introduces the permutation notation
x
x
yz 
zy
in use today, as well as the cyclic notation for permuta­
tions; defines the product of permutations, the degree 
of a permutation, cyclic permutation, transposition; 
recognizes the identity permutation as a permutation; 
discusses what we would call today the direct product 
of two groups; and deals with the alternating groups 
extensively. Here is a sample of some of the results 
he proves.
(i) Every even permutation is a product of 3-cycles.
(ii) If p (prime) is a divisor of the order of a group, 
then there exists a subgroup of order p. (This is 
known today as Cauchy’s theorem, though it was 
stated without proof by Galois.)
(iii) He determined all subgroups of S3 ,S4 ,S5 ,S6 
(making an error in S6).
(iv) All permutations which commute with a given 
one form a group (the centralizer ofan element).
It should be noted that all these results were given 
and proved in the context of permutation groups. For 
details see [6], [8], [23], [24], [25], [33].
The crowning achievement of these two lines of 
development—a symphony on the grand themes of 
Galois and Cauchy—was Jordan’s important and in­
fluential Traite des Substitutions et des liquations 
Algebriques of 1870. Although the author states in 
the preface that
the aim of the work is to develop Galois’s method 
and to make it a proper field of study, by show­
ing with what facility it can solve all principal 
problems of the theory of equations,
itis in fact group theory per se—not as an offshoot of 
the theory of solvability of equations—which forms 
the central object of study.
Camille Jordan (1838-1922)
The striving for a mathematical synthesis based 
on key ideas is a striking characteristic of Jordan’s 
work, as well as that ofa number of other mathemati­
cians of the period (e.g., F. Klein). The concept of 
a (permutation) group seemed to Jordan to provide 
such a key idea. His approach enabled him to give a 
unified presentation of results due to Galois, Cauchy, 
and others. His application of the group concept to 
the theory of equations, algebraic geometry, transcen­
dental functions, and theoretical mechanics was also 
part of the unifying and synthesizing theme. “In his 
book Jordan wandered through all of algebraic geom­
etry, number theory, and function theory in search of 
interesting permutation groups” (Klein, [20]). In fact, 
the aim was a survey of all of mathematics by areas 
in which the theory of permutation groups had been 
applied or seemed likely to be applicable. “The work 
represents... a review of the whole of contemporary 

244
Algebra and Number Theory
mathematics from the standpoint of the occurrence 
of group-theoretic thinking in permutation-theoretic 
form” (Wussing, [33]).
The Traite embodied the substance of most of Jor­
dan’s publications on groups up to that time (he wrote 
over 30 articles on groups during the period 1860­
1880) and directed attention to a large number of dif­
ficult problems, introducing many fundamental con­
cepts. For example, Jordan makes explicit the notions 
of isomorphism and homomorphism for (substitu­
tion) groups, introduces the term solvable group for 
the first time in a technical sense, introduces the con­
cept of a composition series, and proves part of the 
Jordan-Holder theorem, namely, that the indices in 
two composition series are the same (the concept of 
a quotient group was not explicitly recognized at this 
time); and he undertakes a very thorough study of 
transitivity and primitivity for permutation groups, 
obtaining results most of which have not since been 
superseded. Jordan also gives a proof that An is sim­
ple for n> 4.
An important part of the treatise is devoted to a 
study of the linear group and some of its subgroups. 
In modern terms these constitute the so-called clas­
sical groups—namely, the general linear group, the 
unimodular group, the orthogonal group, and the 
symplectic group. Jordan considers these groups only 
over finite fields, and proves their simplicity in cer­
tain cases. It should be noted, however, that he con­
siders these groups as permutation groups rather than 
groups of matrices or linear transformations (see [29], 
[33]).
Jordan’s Traite is a landmark in the evolution 
of group theory. His permutation-theoretic point of 
view, however, was soon to be overtaken by the con­
ception ofa group as a group of transformations (see 
(c) below):
The Traite marks a pause in the evolution and 
application of the permutation-theoretic group 
concept. It was an expression of Jordan’s deep 
desire to effect a conceptual synthesis of the 
mathematics of his time. That he tried to achieve 
such a synthesis by relying on the concept of a 
permutation group, which the very next phase of

been unduly restricted, makes for both the glory 
and the limitations of the Traite... (Wussing,

(b) Abelian groups As noted earlier, the main source 
for abelian group theory was number theory, be­
ginning with Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. 
In contrast to permutation theory, group-theoretic 
modes of thought in number theory remained im­
plicit until about the last third of the nineteenth cen­
tury. Until that time no explicit use of the term group 
was made, and there was no link to the contemporary, 
flourishing theory of permutation groups. We now 
give a sample of some implicit group-theoretic work 
in number theory, especially in algebraic number 
theory.
Algebraic number theory arose in connection with 
Fermat’s conjecture concerning the equation xn + 
yn = zn , Gauss’s theory of binary quadratic forms, 
and higher reciprocity laws. Algebraic number fields 
and their arithmetical properties were the main ob­
jects of study. In 1846 G. L. Dirichlet studied the 
units in an algebraic number field and established 
that (in our terminology) the group of these units is 
a direct product of a finite cyclic group and a free 
abelian group of finite rank. At about the same time 
E. Kummer introduced his ideal numbers, defined an 
equivalence relation on them, and derived, for cyclo­
tomic fields, certain special properties of the number 
of equivalence classes (the so-called class number of 
a cyclotomic field; in our terminology, the order of the 
ideal class group of the cyclotomic field). Dirichlet 
had earlier made similar studies of quadratic fields.
In 1869 E. Schering, a former student of Gauss, in­
vestigated the structure of Gauss’s (group of) equiv­
alence classes of binary quadratic forms. He found 
certain fundamental classes from which all classes of 
forms could be obtained by composition. In group­
theoretic terms, Schering found a basis for the abelian 
group of equivalence classes of binary quadratic 
forms. L. Kronecker generalized Kummer’s work on 
cyclotomic fields to arbitrary algebraic number fields. 
In a paper in 1870 on algebraic number theory, enti­
tled “Auseinandersetzung einiger Eigenschaften der 
Klassenzahl idealer complexer Zahlen”, he began by 
taking a very abstract point of view: he considered 
a finite set of arbitrary “elements”, and defined an 
abstract operation on them which satisfied certain 
laws—laws which we may take nowadays as axioms 
for a finite abelian group:
Let O', O", O'",... be finitely many elements 
such that with any two of them we can asso­
ciate a third by means of a definite procedure. 
Thus, if f denotes the procedure and O', O" are 
two (possibly equal) elements, then there exists

KLEINER: The Evolution of Group Theory: A Brief Survey
245
a O'" equal to f (O', 0"). Furthermore,
f (o',o" ) = f (o",o'),
f (O,f (o'',o''' )) = f (f (o',o'') ,e'")
and if 0" is different from O'" then f (O', 0") 
is different from f(O',0"'). Once this is as­
sumed we can replace the operation f (O', 0") 
by multiplication 0' • 0" provided that instead 
of equality we employ equivalence. Thus using 
the usual equivalence symbol ~ we define the 
equivalence 0' • 0" ~ O'" by means of the equa­
tion f (O', 0") = O'".
Kronecker aimed at working out the laws of com­
bination of “magnitudes”, in the process giving an 
implicit definition ofa finite abelian group. From the 
above abstract considerations Kronecker deduces the 
following consequences:
(i) If0 is any “element” of the set under discussion, 
then 0k =1for some positive integer k.Ifk is 
the smallest such, then 0 is said to “belong to k”. 
If0 belongs to k and 0m =1, then k divides m.
(ii) If an element 0 belongs to k, then every divisor 
of k has an element belonging to it.
(iii) If 0 and 0' belong to k and k' respectively, and k 
and k' are relatively prime, then 00' belongs to 
kk'.
(iv) There exists a “fundamental system” of elements 
01,02,03,...such that the expression
0 hh1 0 h2 0 h3 ••• 
(hi = 1, 2, 3 ,...,n)
represents each element of the given set of el­
ements just once. The numbers n1,n2,n3,... 
to which, respectively, 01 ,02 ,03,...belong, are 
such that each is divisible by its successor; the 
product n 1 n2 n3 • • • is equal to the totality of 
elements of the set.
The above can, of course, be interpreted as well- 
known results on finite abelian groups; in particular 
(iv) can be taken as the basis theorem for such groups. 
Once Kronecker establishes this general framework, 
he applies it to the special cases of equivalence classes 
of binary quadratic forms and to ideal classes. He 
notes that when applying (iv) to the former, one ob­
tains Schering’s result.
Although Kronecker did not relate his implicit def­
inition of a finite abelian group to the (by that time) 
well-established concept of a permutation group, of 
which he was well aware, he clearly recognized the 
advantages of the abstract point of view which he 
adopted:
The very simple principles ... are applied not 
only in the context indicated but also frequently 
elsewhere—even in the elementary parts of 
number theory. This shows, and it is otherwise 
easy to see, that these principles belong to a more 
general and more abstract realm of ideas. It is 
therefore proper to free their development from 
all inessential restrictions, thus making it un­
necessary to repeat the same argument when ap­
plying it in different cases . .. Also, when stated 
with all admissible generality, the presentation 
gains in simplicity and, since only the truly es­
sential features are thrown into relief, in trans­
parency.
The above lines of development were capped in 
1879 by an important paper of G. Frobenius and 
L. Stickelberger entitled “On groups of commut­
ing elements.” Although Frobenius and Stickelberger 
built on Kronecker’s work, they used the concept of an 
abelian group explicitly and, moreover, made the im­
portant advance of recognizing that the abstract group 
concept embraces congruences and Gauss’s compo­
sition of forms as well as the substitution groups of 
Galois. (They also mention, in footnotes, groups of in­
finite order, namely groups of units of number fields 
and the group of all roots of unity.) One of their 
main results is a proof of the basis theorem for finite 
abelian groups, including a proof of the uniqueness 
of decomposition. It is interesting to compare their 
explicit, modern, formulation of the theorem to that 
of Kronecker ((iv) above) ([33], p. 235):
A group that is not irreducible [indecomposable] 
can be decomposed into purely irreducible fac­
tors. As a rule, such a decomposition can be 
accomplished in many ways. However, regard­
less of the way in which it is carried out, the 
number of irreducible factors is always the same 
and the factors in the two decompositions can be 
so paired off that the corresponding factors have 
the same order.
They go on to identify the “irreducible factors” as 
cyclic groups of prime power orders. They then apply

246
Algebra and Number Theory
Georg Frobenius (1849-1917)
their results to groups of integers modulo m, binary 
quadratic forms, and ideal classes in algebraic num­
ber fields. The paper by Frobenius and Stickelberger 
is (Fuchs, [30])
a remarkable piece of work, building up an in­
dependent theory of finite abelian groups on its 
own foundation in a way close to modern views.
For details on this section (b), see [5], [9], [24[, [30], 
[33].
(c) Transformation groups As in number theory, 
so in geometry and analysis, group-theoretic ideas 
remained implicit until the last third of the nineteenth 
century. Moreover, Klein’s (and Lie’s) explicit use of 
groups in geometry influenced conceptually rather 
than technically the evolution of group theory, for it 
signified a genuine shift in the development of that 
theory from a preoccupation with permutation groups 
to the study of groups of transformations. (That is not 
to imply, of course, that permutation groups were no 
longer studied.) This transition was also notable in 
that it pointed to a turn from finite groups to infinite 
groups.
Klein noted the connection of his work with per­
mutation groups but also realized the departure he 
was making. He stated that what Galois theory and 
his own program have in common is the investigation 
of “groups of changes”, but added ([33], p. 191) that 
to be sure, the objects the changes apply to are 
different: there [Galois theory] one deals with a 
finite number of discrete elements, whereas here 
one deals with an infinite number of elements of 
a continuous manifold.
To continue the analogy, Klein notes that just as there 
is a theory of permutation groups, “we insist on a 
theory of transformations, a study of groups generated 
by transformations of a given type” ([33], p. 191).
Klein shunned the abstract point of view in group 
theory, and even his technical definition of a (trans­
formation) group is deficient ([33], p. 185):
Now let there be given a sequence of trans­
formations A,B,C, . . . If this sequence has 
the property that the composite of any two of 
its transformations yields a transformation that 
again belongs to the sequence, then the latter 
will be called a group of transformations.
His work, however, broadened considerably the con­
ception of a group and its applicability in other fields 
of mathematics. Klein did much to promote the view 
that group-theoretic ideas are fundamental in mathe­
matics ([33], p. 228):
Group theory appears as a distinct discipline 
throughout the whole of modern mathematics.
It permeates the most varied areas as an order­
ing and classifying principle.
There was another context in which groups were 
associated with geometry, namely, motion-geometry; 
i.e., the use of motions or transformations of geomet­
ric objects as group elements. Already in 1856 W. R. 
Hamilton considered (implicitly) groups of the regu­
lar solids. Jordan, in 1868, dealt with the classification 
of all subgroups of the group of motions of Euclidean 
3-space. And Klein in his Lectures on the Icosahe­
dron of 1884 “solved” the quintic equation by means 
of the symmetry group of the icosahedron. He thus 
discovered a deep connection between the groups of 
rotations of the regular solids, polynomial equations, 
and complex function theory. (In these Lectures there 
also appears the “Klein 4-group”.)
Already in the late 1860s Klein and Lie had under­
taken, jointly,
to investigate geometric or analytic objects that 
are transformed into themselves by groups of 
changes. (This is Klein’s retrospective descrip­
tion, in 1894, of their program.)

KLEINER: The Evolution of Group Theory: A Brief Survey
247
While Klein concentrated on discrete groups, Lie 
studied continuous transformation groups. Lie re­
alized that the theory of continuous transformation 
groups was a very powerful tool in geometry and 
differential equations and he set himself the task of 
“determining all groups of ... [continuous] transfor­
mations” ([33], p. 214). He achieved his objective by 
the early 1880s with the classification of these groups 
(see [33] for details). A classification of discontinu­
ous transformation groups was obtained by Poincare 
and Klein a few years earlier.
Beyond the technical accomplishments in the ar­
eas of discontinuous and continuous transformation 
groups (extensive theories developed in both areas 
and both are still nowadays active fields of research), 
what is important for us in the founding of these the­
ories is that
(i) they provided a major extension of the scope 
of the concept of a group—from permutation 
groups and abelian groups to transformation 
groups;
(ii) they provided important examples of infinite 
groups—previously the only objects of study 
were finite groups;
(iii) they greatly extended the range of applications 
of the group concept to include number theory, 
the theory of algebraic equations, geometry, the 
theory of differential equations (both ordinary 
and partial), and function theory (automorphic 
functions, complex functions).
All this occurred prior to the emergence of the 
abstract group concept. In fact, these developments 
were instrumental in the emergence of the concept of 
an abstract group, which we describe next. For further 
details on this section (c), see [5], [7], [9], [17], [18], 
[20], [24], [29], [33].
3 Emergence of abstraction in 
group theory
The abstract point of view in group theory emerged 
slowly. It took over one hundred years from the time 
of Lagrange’s implicit group-theoretic work of 1770 
for the abstract group concept to evolve. E. T. Bell 
discerns several stages in this process of evolution 
towards abstraction and axiomatization [2]:
The entire development required about a cen­
tury. Its progress is typical of the evolution of any 
major mathematical discipline of the recent pe­
riod; first, the discovery of isolated phenomena, 
then the recognition of certain features common 
to all, next the search for further instances, their 
detailed calculation and classification; then the 
emergence of general principles making further 
calculations, unless needed for some definite ap­
plication, superfluous; and last, the formulation 
of postulates crystallizing in abstract form the 
structure of the system investigated.
Although somewhat oversimplified (as all such 
generalizations tend to be), this is nevertheless a use­
ful framework. Indeed, in the case of group theory, 
first came the “isolated phenomena”—e.g., permuta­
tions, binary quadratic forms, roots of unity; then the 
recognition of “common features”—the concept ofa 
finite group, encompassing both permutation groups 
and finite abelian groups (cf. the paper of Frobe­
nius and Stickelberger cited in section 2(b)); next 
the search for “other instances”—in our case trans­
formation groups (see section 2(c)); and finally the 
formulation of “postulates”—in this case the postu­
lates of a group, encompassing both the finite and 
infinite cases. We now consider when and how the 
intermediate and final stages of abstraction occurred.
In 1854 Cayley, in a paper entitled “On the theory 
of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation 
0" = 1,” gave the first abstract definition of a finite 
group. (In 1858 R. Dedekind, in lectures on Galois 
theory at Gottingen, gave another.) Here is Cayley’s 
definition:
A set of symbols 1, a, p, ... all of them differ­
ent, and such that the product of any two of them 
(no matter in what order), or the product of any 
one of them into itself, belongs to the set, is said 
to be a group.
Cayley goes on to say that
These symbols are not in general convertible 
[commutative], but are associative,
and
it follows that if the entire group is multiplied 
by any one of the symbols, either as further or 
nearer factor [i.e., on the left or on the right], the 
effect is simply to reproduce the group.
Cayley then presents several examples of groups, 
such as the quaternions (under addition), invert­
ible matrices (under multiplication), permutations,

248
Algebra and Number Theory
Arthur Cayley (1821-1895)
Gauss’s quadratic forms, and groups arising in el­
liptic function theory. Next he shows that every ab­
stract group is (in our terminology) isomorphic to a 
permutation group, a result now known as Cayley’s 
theorem. He seems to have been well aware of the 
concept of isomorphic groups, although he does not 
define it explicitly. He introduces, however, the mul­
tiplication table of a (finite) group and asserts that 
an abstract group is determined by its multiplication 
table. He then goes on to determine all the groups of 
orders four and six, showing there are two of each by 
displaying multiplication tables. Moreover, he notes 
that the cyclic group of order n “is in every respect 
analogous to the system of the roots of the ordinary 
equation xn - 1=0,” and that there exists only one 
group of a given prime order.
Cayley’s orientation towards an abstract view of 
groups—a remarkable accomplishment at this time 
of the evolution of group theory—was due, at least 
in part, to his contact with the abstract work of G. 
Boole. The concern with the abstract foundations of 
mathematics was characteristic of the circles around 
Boole, Cayley, and Sylvester already in the 1840s. 
Cayley’s achievement was, however, only a personal 
triumph. His abstract definition of a group attracted no 
attention at the time, even though Cayley was already 
well known. The mathematical community was ap­
parently not ready for such abstraction: permutation 
groups were the only groups under serious investi­
gation, and more generally, the formal approach to 
mathematics was still in its infancy. As M. Kline put 
it in his inimitable way [21]:
Premature abstraction falls on deaf ears, whether 
they belong to mathematicians or to students.
For details see [22], [23], [24], [25], [29], [33].
It was only a quarter of a century later that the 
abstract group concept began to take hold. And it 
was Cayley again who in four short papers on group 
theory written in 1878 returned to the abstract point 
of view he adopted in 1854. Here he stated the gen­
eral problem of finding all groups of a given order 
and showed that any (finite) group is isomorphic to 
a group of permutations. But, as he remarked ([22], 
p. 141), this
does not in any wise show that the best or easiest 
mode of treating the general problem is thus to 
regard it as a problem of substitutions; and it 
seems clear that the better course is to consider 
the general problem in itself, and to deduce from 
it the theory of groups of substitutions.
These papers of Cayley, unlike those of 1854, inspired 
a number of fundamental group-theoretic works.
Another mathematician who advanced the abstract 
point of view in group theory (and more generally 
in algebra) was H. Weber. It is of interest to see his 
“modern” definition of an abstract (finite) group given 
in a paper of 1882 on quadratic forms ([23], p. 113):
A system G of h arbitrary elements B 1, B2, ... , 
Bh is called a group of degree h if it satisfies the 
following conditions:
I. By some rule which is designated as composi­
tion or multiplication, from any two elements 
of the same system one derives anew element 
of the same system. In symbols BrBs = Bt.
II. It is always true that (Br Bs )Bt = Br (Bs Bt )= 
BrBsBt.
III. From BBr = BBs or from BrB = BsB it follows 
that Br = Bs .
Weber’s and other definitions of abstract groups 
given at the time applied to finite groups only. They 
thus encompassed the two theories of permutation 
groups and (finite) abelian groups, which derived 
from the two sources of classical algebra (polynomial

Heinrich Weber (1842-1913)
equations) and number theory, respectively. Infinite 
groups, which derived from the theories of (discon­
tinuous and continuous) transformation groups, were 
not subsumed under those definitions. It was W. von 
Dyck who, in an important and influential paper in 
1882 entitled “Group-theoretic studies,” consciously 
included and combined, for the first time, all of the 
major historical roots of abstract group theory—the 
algebraic, number-theoretic, geometric, and analytic. 
In von Dyck’s own words:
The aim of the following investigations is to 
continue the study of the properties of a group 
in its abstract formulation. In particular, this will 
pose the question of the extent to which these 
properties have an invariant character present in 
all the different realizations of the group, and the 
question of what leads to the exact determination 
of their essential group-theoretic content.
Von Dyck’s definition of an abstract group, which 
included both the finite and infinite cases, was given in 
terms of generators (he calls them “operations”) and 
defining relations (the definition is somewhat long— 
see [7], pp. 5, 6). He stresses that “in this way all . . . 
isomorphic groups are included in a single group,” 
and that “the essence of a group is no longer expressed 
by a particular presentation form of its operations but 
rather by their mutual relations.” He then goes on to 
construct the free group on n generators, and shows 
(essentially, without using the terminology) that every 
finitely generated group is a quotient group of a free 
group of finite rank. What is important from the point 
of view of postulates for group theory is that von Dyck 
was the first to require explicitly the existence of an 
inverse in his definition of a group:
We require for our considerations that a group 
which contains the operation Tk must also con­
tain its inverse Tk-1 .
In a second paper (in 1883) von Dyck applied his 
abstract development of group theory to permutation 
groups, finite rotation groups (symmetries of poly- 
hedra), number-theoretic groups, and transformation 
groups.
Although various postulates for groups appeared in 
the mathematical literature for the next twenty years, 
the abstract point of view in group theory was not 
universally applauded. In particular, Klein, one of the 
major contributors to the development of group the­
ory, thought that the “abstract formulation is excellent 
for the working out of proofs but it does not help one 
find new ideas and methods,” adding ([33], p. 228) 
that
in general, the disadvantage of the [abstract] 
method is that it fails to encourage thought.
Despite Klein’s reservations, the mathematical 
community was at this time (early 1880s) receptive 
to the abstract formulations (cf. the response to Cay­
ley’s definition of 1854). The major reasons for this 
receptivity were:
(i) There were now several major “concrete” the­
ories of groups—permutation groups, abelian 
groups, discontinuous transformation groups 
(the finite and infinite cases), and continuous 
transformation groups, and this warranted ab­
stracting their essential features.
(ii) Groups came to play a central role in diverse 
fields of mathematics, such as different parts of 
algebra, geometry, number theory and several 
areas of analysis, and the abstract view of groups 
was thought to clarify what was essential for 
such applications and to offer opportunities for 
further applications.
(iii) The formal approach, aided by the penetration 
into mathematics of set theory and mathemat­
ical logic, became prevalent in other fields of 

250
Algebra and Number Theory
mathematics—for example, various areas of ge­
ometry and analysis.
In the next section we will follow, very briefly, 
the evolution of that abstract point of view in group 
theory.
4 Consolidation of the abstract 
group concept; dawn of 
abstract group theory
The abstract group concept spread rapidly during the 
1880s and 1890s, although there still appeared a great 
many papers in the areas of permutation and trans­
formation groups. The abstract viewpoint was mani­
fested in two ways:
(a) concepts and results introduced and proved in the 
setting of “concrete” groups were now reformu­
lated and reproved in an abstract setting;
(b) studies originating in, and based on, an abstract 
setting began to appear.
An interesting example of the former case is a 
reproving by Frobenius, in an abstract setting, of Sy- 
low’s theorem, which was proved by Sylow in 1872 
for permutation groups. This was done in 1887, in 
a paper entitled “Neuer Beweis Sylowschen Satzes”. 
Although Frobenius admits that the fact that every 
finite group can be represented by a group of permu­
tations proves that Sylow’s theorem must hold for all 
finite groups, he nevertheless wishes to establish the 
theorem abstractly:
Since the symmetric group, which is introduced 
in all these proofs, is totally alien to the context 
of Sylow’s theorem I have tried to find a new 
derivation of it . . .
(For a case study of the evolution of abstraction in 
group theory in connection with Sylow’s theorem see 
[28] and [32].)
Holder was an important contributor to abstract 
group theory, and was responsible for introducing a 
number of group-theoretic concepts abstractly. For 
example, in 1889 he introduced the abstract notion of 
a quotient group (the “quotient group” was first seen 
as the Galois group of the “auxiliary equation”, later 
as a homomorphic image and only in Holder’s time 
as a group of cosets), and “completed” the proof of 
the Jordan-Holder theorem, namely, that the quotient 
groups ina composition series are invariant up to iso­
morphism (see section 2(a) for Jordan’s contribution). 
In 1893, in a paper on groups of order p3 ,pq2 , pqr, 
and p4 , he introduced abstractly the concept of an 
automorphism of a group. Holder was also the first 
to study simple groups abstractly. (Previously they 
were considered in concrete cases—as permutation 
groups, transformation groups, and so on.) As he says 
([29], p. 338):
It would be of the greatest interest ifa survey of 
all simple groups with a finite number of opera­
tions could be known.
(By “operations” Holder meant elements.) He then 
goes on to determine the simple groups of order up 
to 200.
Other typical examples of studies in an abstract set­
ting are the papers by Dedekind and G. A. Miller in 
1897/1898 on Hamiltonian groups—i.e., non-abelian 
groups in which all subgroups are normal. They (in­
dependently) characterize such groups abstractly, and 
introduce in the process the notions of the commu­
tator of two elements and the commutator subgroup 
(Jordan had previously introduced the notion of com­
mutator of two permutations).
The theory of group characters and the represen­
tation theory for finite groups (created at the end 
of the nineteenth century by Frobenius and Burn- 
side/Frobenius/Molien, respectively) also belong to 
the area of abstract group theory, as they were used 
to prove important results about abstract groups. See 
[17] for details.
Although the abstract group concept was well 
established by the end of the nineteenth century, 
(Wussing, [33])
this was not accompanied by a general accep­
tance of the associated method of presentation 
in papers, textbooks, monographs, and lectures. 
Group-theoretic monographs based on the ab­
stract group concept did not appear until the be­
ginning of the twentieth century. Their appear­
ance marked the birth of abstract group theory.
The earliest monograph devoted entirely to abstract 
group theory was the book by J. A. de Seguier of 1904 
entitled Elements of the Theory of Abstract Groups 
[27]. At the very beginning of the book there is a set- 
theoretic introduction based on the work of Cantor. 
B. Chandler and W. Magnus [7] remark that
De Seguier may have been the first algebraist to 
take note of Cantor’s discovery of uncountable 
cardinalities.

Next is the introduction of the concept of a semi­
group with two-sided cancellation law and a proof 
that a finite semigroup is a group. There is also 
a proof, by means of counterexamples, of the in­
dependence of the group postulates. De Seguier’s 
book also includes a discussion of isomorphisms, 
homomorphisms, automorphisms, decomposition of 
groups into direct products, the Jordan-Holder theo­
rem, the first isomorphism theorem, abelian groups 
including the basis theorem, Hamiltonian groups, and 
finally, the theory of p-groups. All this is done in 
the abstract, with “concrete” groups relegated to an 
appendix.
The style of de Seguier is in sharp con­
trast to that of Dyck. There are no intuitive 
considerations ...and there is a tendency to be 
as abstract and as general as possible ...” 
(Chandler and Magnus, [7]).
De Seguier’s book was devoted largely to finite 
groups. The first abstract monograph on group theory 
which dealt with groups in general, relegating finite 
groups to special chapters, was O. Schmidt’s Abstract 
Theory of Groups of 1916 [26]. Schmidt, founder 
of the Russian school of group theory, devotes the 
first four chapters of his book to group properties 
common to finite and infinite groups. Discussion of 
finite groups is postponed to chapter 5, there being 
ten chapters in all. See [7], [10], [33].
5 Divergence of developments 
in group theory
Group theory evolved from several different sources, 
giving rise to various concrete theories. These theo­
ries developed independently, some for over one hun­
dred years (beginning in 1770) before they converged 
(early 1880s) within the abstract group concept. Ab­
stract group theory emerged and was consolidated in 
the next thirty to forty years. At the end of that pe­
riod (around 1920) one can discern the divergence of 
group theory into several distinct theories. Here is the 
barest indication of some of these advances and new 
directions in group theory, beginning in the 1920s 
(with contributors and approximate dates):
(a) Finite group theory. The major problem here, al­
ready formulated by Cayley (1870s) and studied 
by Jordan and Holder, was to find all finite groups 
of a given order. The problem proved too diffi­
cult and mathematicians turned to special cases 
(suggested especially by Galois theory): to find 
all simple or all solvable groups (cf. the Feit- 
Thompson theorem of 1963, and the classifica­
tion of all finite simple groups in 1981). See [14], 
[15], [30].
(b) Extensions of certain results from finite group 
theory to infinite groups with finiteness condi­
tions; e.g., O. J. Schmidt’s proof, in 1928, of the 
Remak-Krull-Schmidt theorem. See [5].
(c) Group presentations (Combinatorial Group The­
ory), begun by von Dyck in 1882, and continued 
in the twentieth century by M. Dehn, H. Tietze, 
J. Nielsen, E. Artin, O. Schreier, et al. For a full 
account, see [7].
(d) Infinite abelian group theory (H. Priifer, R. Baer, 
H. Ulm et al.—1920s to 1930s). See [30].
(e) Schreier’s theory of group extensions (1926), 
leading later to the cohomology of groups.
(f) Algebraic groups (A. Borel, C. Chevalley et al.— 
1940s).
(g) Topological groups, including the extension of 
group representation theory to continuous groups 
(Schreier, E. Cartan, L. Pontrjagin, I. Gelfand, 
J. von Neumann et al.—1920s and 1930s).

The Search for Finite Simple Groups
JOSEPH A. GALLIAN
Mathematics Magazine 49 (1976), 163-179
At present, simple group theory is the most active and 
glamorous area of research in the theory of groups 
and it seems certain that this will remain the case 
for many years to come. Roughly speaking, the cen­
tral problem is to find some reasonable description 
of all finite simple groups. A number of expository 
papers [36], [42], [45], [47], [49], [79] and books 
[21], [46], [67] detailing progress on this problem 
have been written for professional group theorists, 
but very little has appeared which is accessible to 
undergraduates. (Only Goldschmidt’s proof of the 
Brauer-Suzuki-Wall theorem [44] comes to mind.) 
This paper is intended as a historical account of the 
search for simple groups for readers who are not ex­
perts in the subject. It is the hope of the author that the 
paper may profitably be read by one who is conver­
sant with the contents of Herstein’s algebra book [55]. 
A complete discussion of all important contributions 
to simple group theory is beyond the scope of this 
paper.
What are simple groups and why are they impor­
tant? Evariste Galois (1811-1832) called a group sim­
ple if its only normal subgroups were the identity sub­
group and the group itself. The abelian simple groups 
are the group of order 1 and the cyclic groups of prime 
order, while the non-abelian simple groups generally 
have very complicated structures. These groups are 
important because they play a role in group theory 
somewhat analogous to that which the primes play 
in number theory or the elements do in chemistry; 
that is, they serve as the “building blocks” for all 
groups.
These building blocks are called the composition 
factors of the group and may be determined in the 
following way. Given a finite group G, choose a max­
imal normal subgroup G1 ofG = G0. Then the factor 
group G0 /G1 is simple, and we next choose a maxi­
mal normal subgroup G2 of G1 . Then G1 /G2 is also 
simple, and we continue in this fashion until we arrive 
at Gn = {e}. The simple groups
G0/G1, G1/G2,...,Gn-1/Gn
are the composition factors of G and by the Jordan­
Holder theorem these groups are independent of the 
choices of the normal subgroups made in the process 
described.
In a certain sense, a group can be reconstructed 
from its composition factors and many of the prop­
erties of a group are determined by the nature of 
its composition factors. This, and the fact that many 
questions about finite groups can be reduced (by in­
duction) to questions about simple groups, make clear 
the importance of determining all non-abelian finite 
simple groups.
The narrative which follows is divided into 16 sec­
tions which appear in more or less chronological order 
according to theme. Within a particular section, how­
ever, we usually include a number of results which 
are related to the theme without regard to time. Thus, 
for example, the section on the odd order problem ap­
pears early in the paper but includes results ranging 
from 1895 to 1963. In this way we hope to emphasize 
two points:
1. the problems of one generation very often have 
deep roots in the work of previous generations;
2. there is frequently a large temporal gap between 
certain results and their subsequent improve­
ments.
Throughout the remainder of this paper we use the 
term simple group to mean a finite non-abelian simple 
group.

1 
The alternating groups and 
the classical linear groups
Although Galois had formulated the definition of a 
simple group and had observed that the alternating 
group (of even permutations) on 5 symbols was sim­
ple, the first major results in the theory were due to 
Camille Jordan (1838-1922). In 1870, Jordan pub­
lished Traite des Substitutions, the first book ever 
written on group theory [58].
In this book he established the existence of five 
infinite families of finite simple groups. One of 
these families, which we denote by An , consists of 
the alternating permutation groups on n> 4 sym­
bols. Jordan formed the other four families by us­
ing matrices with entries from finite fields. One 
of these may be described as follows. For m>1, 
the special linear group SL(m, pn ) is the multi­
plicative group of m x m matrices of determinant 
1 with entries from the field with pn elements and 
the projective special linear group PSL(m,pn) is 
the factor group SL(m, pn)/Z (SL(m, pn )), where 
Z (SL(m,pn)), the center of SL(m, pn), is the sub­
group of SL(m, pn) consisting of all scalar matrices 
with determinant 1. Jordan proved that P SL(m, p) is 
simple when (m, p) is not (2, 2) or (2, 3). The other 
three families have been given the names orthog­
onal, unitary and symplectic groups and, following 
Hermann Weyl, mathematicians refer to these four 
families collectively as the classical simple groups.
The last three types mentioned above are most eas­
ily defined as certain groups of invertible linear trans­
formations of a finite-dimensional vector space V 
over a finite field modulo the center of the group and in 
each case the group is obtained by considering those 
transformations T which leave a non-degenerate form 
f of V invariant (i.e., f is a certain function from 
V x V into the field and f(Tx,Ty) = f(x, y) for 
all x, y in V ). A symmetric bilinear form (i.e., a dot 
product) gives an orthogonal group; hermitian, a uni­
tary group; and skew symmetric bilinear, a symplectic 
group. The precise definitions of these groups are not 
needed here but the reader can find them in [2] and 
[6]. Jordan introduced these three families as groups 
of matrices instead of groups of linear transforma­
tions and proved they are simple when the field has 
prime order (except for a few trivial cases).
2 Range problem 1-660
A different approach was taken by Otto Holder 
(1859-1937) when in 1892 he initiated what we will 
call the range problem; namely, the complete determi­
nation of all simple groups whose orders are in a given 
range. Here both the existence and the uniqueness 
questions must be considered; that is, it must be de­
termined which integers in the range are the orders of 
simple groups and, for each such integer, all possible 
simple groups of that order must also be determined 
(up to isomorphism). Holder [56] proved that the only 
two simple groups whose orders lie between 1 and 200 
are A5 of order 60 and P SL(2, 7) of order 168.
F. N. Cole (1861-1927), the first American-born 
mathematician to publish in group theory, followed 
Holder’s lead in 1892 [23] when he examined the in­
tegers between 201 and 500 for simple groups. He 
was not totally successful for he was unable to prove 
that A6 was the unique simple group of order 360; 
nor was he able to show that 432 was not the order of 
a simple group. He overcame these difficulties [24] 
a year later, however, when he completed the deter­
mination of all the simple groups with orders in the 
range 1 to 660. In addition to the ones in this range 
already found by Jordan, Cole discovered one more, 
P SL(2, 8), having order 504. This provided the first 
example of a simple group not known to Jordan and 
the first proof of the simplicity of one of the groups 
P SL(m, q) with q not prime.
The methods of Holder and Cole are of interest. 
The three Sylow theorems rule out 596 of the first 
660 integers as possible orders of simple groups. (In 
fact, they rule out 9431 of the first 10,000 [74].) IfG 
is assumed to be simple and H is a proper subgroup of 
G, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmet­
ric group on the cosets of H in G (compare with the 
proof of Theorem 2.92 in [55]). Thus G with order |G| 
is represented as a group of permutations on |G|/|H| 
symbols and it follows that (|G|/|H|)! is a multiple 
of |G|. This last fact is called the index theorem and 
it further reduces the list of integers to be examined 
to 47. Finally, a combination of the Sylow theorems, 
the index theorem, and other elementary techniques 
such as counting elements reduces to 33 the list of 
those integers from 1 to 660 which require ad hoc ar­
guments. Since the theory of permutation groups was 
much further developed than the theory of abstract 
groups at that time, these remaining 33 integers were 
handled with permutation group techniques. An ex­
ample of a permutation-type argument will be given 
later.
It is noteworthy that while the proofs of the non­
simplicity of a group of order 144 or 180 occupied 
more than 10 pages of Holder’s paper, the author has 
had undergraduates [59] who have done this in less

Their proofs for the cases 144 and 180 require only

PSL(m, pn)
Cole’s discovery of the simplicity of P SL(2, 8) had 
far-reaching consequences because that same year E. 
H. Moore (1862-1932), the first mathematics depart­
ment chairman of the University of Chicago, used 
it for the starting point of his investigations which 
resulted [66] in a proof that the family of groups 
P SL(2, pn ) are all simple except when pn =2or 3. 
William Burnside (1852-1927) also obtained this re­
sult [13] shortly after Moore. Moore’s paper, in turn, 
led his first Ph.D. student, Leonard E. Dickson (1874­
1954), to the complete generalization of Jordan’s orig­
inal result when in 1897 he proved [29] that the family 
of groups PSL(m,pn) (m>1) consisted of simple 
groups except when pn =2or 3. Dickson called this 
family a triply infinite system since each of p, n, and 
m may take on infinitely many values. Moore’s pa­
per also contains many interesting results on finite 
fields, the most important of which is that for each 
prime power pn there exists a unique field of order pn 
(Galois had proved such fields exist in 1830 [41]). 
In the opinion of E. T. Bell ([4], p. 10) these results 
on finite fields clearly mark the beginning of abstract 
algebra in America.
4 Range problem to 1092
In 1895 Burnside ((14], [15]) obtained several power­
ful arithmetic tests for simple groups. By far the most 
important of these is the fact that a simple group of 
even order must be divisible by one of 12, 16 or 56. In 
proving this result, he showed that an even order sim­
ple group cannot have a cyclic Sylow 2-subgroup. 
This theorem appears to be the first non-simplicity 
criterion which is based on the structure of the Sy- 
low 2-subgroups. In the past two decades much of 
the research in simple group theory has dealt with 
the problem of classifying all simple groups whose 
Sylow 2-subgroups have a specified structure. (All 
the Sylow 2-subgroups of a group are isomorphic.) 
For example, John Walter [77], in a long (110 pages!) 
and difficult proof, obtained a broad generalization 
of Burnside’s result when he determined all simple 
groups with abelian Sylow 2-subgroups. Similarly, 
all simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are di­
hedral (that is, are groups of symmetries of some 
regular n-sided polygon) have been determined by 
Daniel Gorenstein and Walter [48]. The proof of this 
important result appears in three papers and runs to 
160 pages! Commenting on this proof in Mathemati­
cal Reviews (32 #7634), John Thompson wrote:
The techniques of these papers cover the spec­
trum of finite group theory more thoroughly than 
any single paper known to the reviewer.
By 1893 the range problem had been completed as 
far as 660. Since 1092 was the next integer known to 
be the order of a simple group, Burnside [15] decided 

GALLIAN: The Search for Finite Simple Groups
257
to examine the integers between these two. The arith­
metical tests of his previous paper disposed of all but 
17 of the 432 integers in this range and the Sylow the­
orems ruled out six more. The remaining 11 integers 
were considered individually although his proof for 
the hardest integer in the range, 720, was erroneous 
and he inadvertently omitted 1008. The efficiency of 
Burnside’s non-simplicity tests is further evidenced 
by the fact that they dispose of all odd integers up 
to 2025 and all but 14 of the odd integers less than 
9000. As a rule, even integers are much harder to 
eliminate than odd integers, but Burnside’s “12, 16, 
56 theorem” alone rules out 3691 of the first 5000 
even integers [74].
5 Permutation representations 
and character theory
In obtaining their results Burnside, Cole, and Holder 
utilized permutation representations of groups. Cer­
tain permutation groups—transitive, doubly transi­
tive, and primitive—play an especially important role 
in simple group theory. (A permutation group on a 
set S is called transitive on S if, for each pair a, b of 
letters of S, there is an element in G which sends a 
to b; G is called doubly transitive on S if, for each 
pair of distinct letters of S, (a, a') and (b, b'), there is 
an element in G which sends a to b and a' to b'; see 
[78], p. 15, for the definition of a primitive group.) 
The reasons for the importance of these groups are 
that the representation of a group as permutations of 
the cosets of a subgroup is transitive and that many 
of the known simple groups can be represented as a 
doubly transitive (and therefore primitive) permuta­
tion group. Thus, a common technique when dealing 
with a simple group G is to represent it as a tran­
sitive, doubly transitive or primitive group and then 
utilize the theory of these groups to obtain important 
information about G.
Much effort was devoted in the late 1800s and early 
1900s to classifying the transitive and primitive per­
mutation groups of low degree. These results often 
prove useful in simple group theory. To illustrate, let 
us consider Siceloff’s proof [71] that there is no sim­
ple group of order 1188 = 22 • 33 • 11. If G were a 
simple group of order 1188, Sylow’s theorem implies 
that G has 12 subgroups of order 11 which are con­
jugate inG. If for each element g in G we define T to 
be the mapping which sends the Sylow 11-subgroup 
S to the Sylow 11-subgroup g-1Sg, we see that G 
may be viewed as a transitive permutation group on 
the set of Sylow 11-subgroups of G (see, for exam­
ple, the proof of 2.92 in [55]). Then letting H denote 
a subgroup of G which consists of all permutations 
which have some Sylow 11-subgroup fixed, it follows 
that |H| =32 • 11 (see [78], p. 51) and H is a permu­
tation group on the other 11 Sylow 11-subgroups. By 
Sylow’s theorem H has an element of order 11 and 
so this element is an 11-cycle. Thus H is a transitive 
permutation group of degree 11 and order 99. But 
Cole [25] has shown no such group exists.
A homomorphism from a group into a group of 
matrices with entries from some field is called a rep­
resentation of the group. IfT is a representation ofG, 
the character of this representation is the function X 
from G to the field defined by X(g) = trace(T (g)) 
for all g in G. There exist numerous arithmetical re­
lations on the characters ofa group G which are inti­
mately related to the structure of G. Thus a knowledge 
of the characters of a group reveals much information 
about the group itself. The theory of group charac­
ters has profoundly influenced the search for simple 
groups. This theory was developed by Georg Frobe­
nius (1849-1917) in a series of papers beginning in 
1896. (The historical background to Frobenius’s cre­
ation of group characters is detailed in [51] and [52].) 
Around the turn of the century Issai Schur (1875­
1941) and especially Burnside simplified the theory 
and found many important applications of it. In recent 
times, character theory has been further developed 
and refined by Brauer, Suzuki, and Feit.
6 Odd order problem
During the period 1895-1901 much attention was 
focused, particularly by Burnside, on the possibility 
of the existence of a simple group of odd order. In 
his 1895 paper [15], Burnside had shown that there 
is no simple group of odd order less than 2025. He 
later extended this to 9000 [16] and then to 40,000 
[18]. Numerous arithmetical theorems obtained by 
Burnside in this period reduced the list of possible 
odd orders less than 40,000 to 7; these were then 
eliminated by elementary considerations.
In 1901 Burnside [17] used character theory 
to prove that a non-solvable transitive permutation 
group of prime degree is doubly transitive. Since a 
simple group which has a subgroup of prime index 
can be represented as a transitive permutation group 
on the cosets of this subgroup it must be doubly tran­
sitive. But the order of a doubly transitive group of 
degree n is divisible by n(n - 1) ([78], p. 20) so 
Burnside’s result shows there is no odd order simple 
group which has a subgroup of prime index. Burnside 

258
Algebra and Number Theory
[18] also proved in 1901 that if a simple group has 
odd order n and p is the smallest prime divisor of n 
then n is divisible either by p4 or by both p3 and a 
prime factor of p2 + p +1.
Burnside’s efforts convinced him that there were no 
simple groups of odd order and that the eventual proof 
of this would involve the use of character theory. In 
fact, he wrote ([20], p. 503):
The contrast that these results shew between 
groups of odd and of even order suggests in­
evitably that simple groups of odd order do not 
exist.
He further wrote [17]:
The results obtained in this paper, partial as they 
necessarily are, appear to me to indicate that 
an answer to the interesting question as to the 
existence or non-existence of simple groups of 
odd order may be arrived at by further study of 
the theory of group characters.
The next important step in this direction, however, 
did not come for more than 50 years. In 1957, Michio 
Suzuki [72] used character theory to prove that a sim­
ple group in which the centralizer of any non-identity 
element is abelian must have even order. (The cen­
tralizer of an element x in a group G is the subgroup 
C(x) = {g e G| gx = xg}.) Three years later, in a 
major work [37], Walter Feit, Marshall Hall, Jr., and 
John Thompson obtained a broad generalization of 
Suzuki’s result by showing that “abelian” could be 
replaced by the much weaker condition “nilpotent”. 
(A group is nilpotent if all of its Sylow subgroups 
are normal.) Their proof was similar to Suzuki’s 
and character theory played an important role 
in it.
Burnside’s prophecy was at last fulfilled in 1963 
when Feit and Thompson expanded on the ideas of 
the two papers mentioned above and proved [38] that 
groups of odd order are solvable. (A finite group is 
solvable if all of its composition factors have prime 
order; thus, solvable groups are not simple.) The dif­
ficulty of this proof and the significance of both the 
theorem and the methods employed cannot be exag­
gerated. Concerning one portion of the proof, Suzuki 
wrote in Mathematical Reviews (29 #3538) “. . . [This 
50 page portion] represents one of the highest points 
ever achieved in the theory of finite groups.”
The proof of the “Odd Order Theorem” occupies an 
entire 255-page issue of the Pacific Journal of Math­
ematics. It proceeds by assuming that there is a group 
G of minimal odd order which is not solvable. Then 
every proper subgroup of G is solvable and therefore 
Philip Hall’s extensive work on solvable groups could 
be brought to bear on the subgroups. Ultimately, they 
were able to derive a contradiction. For their achieve­
ment, Feit and Thompson were awarded the Frank 
Nelson Cole Prize in Algebra by the American Math­
ematical Society in 1965. (The Cole Prize is named 
after the same Cole who had determined the simple 
groups with orders between 201 and 660, and was 
established in his honor in recognition of his many 
years of service to the Society.)

Dickson’s simple groups
In the period from 1897 to 1905 Dickson made many 
fundamental contributions to the theory of simple 
groups. In a series of papers appearing from 1897 to 
1899 he extended Jordan’s results on the simplicity 
of the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic groups over 
fields of prime order to arbitrary finite fields. Much of 
this work emanated from his Ph.D. dissertation, the 
first one ever done in mathematics at the University 
of Chicago.
Whether there exist two non-isomorphic simple 
groups of the same order had been a long-standing 
problem by 1899. But Dickson’s proof in 1897 that 
P SL(3, 4) is simple provided a possible answer to 
this question since it and the simple group A8 both 
have order 20,160. It was quickly suspected that these 
two were not isomorphic since A8 contains elements 
of orders 6 and 15 while no such elements were known 
tobeinPSL(3, 4). At Moore’s suggestion, Ida Schot- 
tenfels investigated these two groups and proved [70] 
they were not isomorphic. Shortly thereafter, Dick­
son showed [30] that there are infinitely many such 
examples. Since these examples were given by Dick­
son no others have been found and there is no known 
triple of non-isomorphic simple groups of equal or­
der. After 20,160 the next known integer for which 
there is a pair of non-isomorphic simple groups of 
equal order is 4,585,351,680, and it wasn’t until the 
mid-l960s that 20,160 was shown to be the smallest 
possible integer for which this can happen.
In his classic book Linear Groups Dickson listed 
all the isomorphisms between the simple groups he 
knew. For example, A5, P SL(2, 4), and P SL(2, 5) 
are defined differently but are isomorphic. The ques­
tion of whether Dickson’s list of isomorphisms con­
tained all which were possible among the simple 
groups known to him was not answered until 50 years 
later when Jean Dieudonne proved [35] that Dickson’s 

GALLIAN: The Search for Finite Simple Groups
259
list was complete. Dickson also listed all the coinci­
dences in the orders of the simple groups known to 
him but whether this list was complete was not de­
termined until 1955 when Emil Artin (1898-1962) 
proved with an elegant number-theoretical study [1] 
that it was.
Without going into detail we mention that the clas­
sical linear groups over the field of complex num­
bers are Lie groups (because, roughly, they possess 
a smooth geometric structure) and Wilhelm Killing 
(1847-1923) and Elie Cartan (1869-1951) proved 
(1888-1894) that besides the simple Lie groups cor­
responding to the classical groups there are only five 
additional simple ones called exceptional Lie groups. 
In two papers in 1901 and 1905 Dickson discovered 
a new infinite family of finite simple groups by defin­
ing analogs over finite fields of one of these excep­
tional Lie groups ([31], [32]). It is remarkable that 
no additional new finite simple groups were found 
until Claude Chevalley and others, 50 years later, 
were able to show (among other results) that the re­
maining four exceptional Lie groups also had finite 
analogs.
8 
The Mathieu groups
In 1861 E. Mathieu discovered a family of five transi­
tive permutation groups. This remarkable family has 
become very important in both the theory of simple 
groups and coding theory as well as in permutation 
group theory. In 1895, while determining all transi­
tive permutation groups on 10 or 11 symbols, Cole 
observed [25] that the smallest Mathieu group (order 
7920) is simple and by 1900 G. A. Miller (1863­
1951) had shown ([63], [64]) that the other four are 
also simple. Three of these groups have order less 
than 1,000,000 and this brought to 53 the number 
of such simple groups known in 1900. This number 
would not be enlarged until 1960.
Among all the simple groups known by 1905 the 
Mathieu groups had the peculiar distinction of being 
the only ones which were not part of an infinite family 
of simple groups (such as An or P SL(m, pn )). To 
this date they (and 21 or so other simple groups) still 
have not been shown to be members of any infinite 
family of simple groups in a natural way.
9 
Range problem to 6232
The determination of all simple groups of order up 
to 2000 was completed in 1900 when G. Ling and 
Miller proved [60] that there is no simple group whose 
order is between 1093 and 2000. It is interesting to 
note that although there are 908 integers in this range 
only 28 required any special treatment. For example, 
Burnside’s result on odd order simple groups and his 
“even, but not divisible by 12, 16 or 56” theorem 
eliminated all but 118 possibilities. Then the Sylow 
theorems, the index theorem, and several results of 
Frobenius on groups with orders of the form pa qb 
reduced the possibilities to 28.
In 1902 Frobenius determined [40] all transi­
tive permutation groups of degree p +1 and order 
p p22 - 1) /2 where p is prime. Since any simple 
group of order p p2 - 1 /2 can be represented as a 
transitive permutation group on the p + 1 conjugate 
Sylow p-subgroups, it follows from Frobenius’s theo­
rem that J3SL(2,p) is the only simple group of order 
p p2 - 1 /2. This appears to be the first arithmeti­
cal characterization of an infinite family of simple 
groups. Fifty-six years later this uniqueness theorem 
was generalized in answer to a question of Artin. 
Artin had observed that the simple groups P SL(2, p) 
(p>3)andPSL(2, 2n), where 2n + 1 is prime, have 
orders which are divisible by a prime whose cube ex­
ceeds the order of the group. He conjectured that 
these were the only such simple groups and Brauer 
and Reynolds [11] used modular character theory (the 
character values lie in a field of prime characteristic) 
to prove this conjecture.
Twelve years after Ling and Miller completed the 
range problem up to 2000, L. P. Siceloff, at the sug­
gestion of Cole, proved [71] that the only integers 
between 2001 and 3640 which are orders of simple 
groups are 2448, 2520, and 3420. All of these were on 
Dickson’s list in 1901. Since 2448 and 3420 have the 
form p p2 - 1 /2 the uniqueness question concern­
ing these integers had been answered affirmatively 
by Frobenius ten years earlier and it was Miller who 
ten years afterward showed [65] that A7 is the unique 
simple group of order 2520. Thus by 1922 all simple 
groups of order up to 3640 had been determined.
Again there was a twelve-year hiatus before the 
exhaustive enumeration of integers in a certain range 
was continued. In 1924, Cole returned to the problem 
again and showed [26] that the only integers between 
3641 and 6232 which are orders of simple groups 
were the four on Dickson’s 1901 list. Unfortunately 
Cole’s paper was so lacking in detail that its value was 
diminished. The uniqueness question for P SL(2, 23) 
(order 6072) had previously been settled affirmatively 
by Frobenius, and Cole did the same for P SL(2, 16) 
(order 4080). Eighteen years after Cole’s paper Brauer 
[7] showed, with the use of character theory, that the 

260
Algebra and Number Theory
remaining two integers also corresponded to unique 
simple groups. So by 1942 all simple groups of order 
as far as 6232 had been determined.
10 Burnside’s paqb theorem
In 1904, Burnside used character theory to prove 
[19] that every group of order paqb, where p and 
q are primes, is solvable. This theorem represented 
the final generalization of a large number of special 
cases which had been established by Sylow, Frobe­
nius, Burnside, Jordan, and Cole; it has become the 
classic example of the power of character theory. With 
character theory a simple proof was possible 70 years 
ago, but a character-free proof of Burnside’s theorem, 
although long sought, has appeared only in the past 
few years. Thompson had indicated in his fundamen­
tal paper [75] on minimal simple groups (see section 
14) that a character-free proof of the Burnside theo­
rem could be extracted from that paper and the “odd 
order paper” [38]. David Goldschmidt [43], in 1970, 
gave a short character-free proof of the theorem when 
p and q are odd and Helmut Bender [5] two years later 
proved the general result without character theory. By 
combining the arguments of Bender in the odd order 
case and of Hiroshi Matsuyama [61] in the even order 
case it is now possible to obtain a short and attractive 
character-free proof of the pa qb theorem.
Despite the early outstanding achievements with 
character theory by Burnside and Frobenius, others 
seemed to ignore it as a tool in simple group theory 
until Brauer brought it to the forefront in the 1940s 
and 1950s. This is partly explained by the fact that 
interest in simple groups began to wane around 1905.
11 The Chevalley groups
In 1948 Dieudonne [34] classified all the known sim­
ple groups according to their method of construction. 
This classification scheme modernized the one Dick­
son had devised in 1901. Whereas Dickson obtained 
his results by means of complicated matrix calcu­
lations which often obscured the underlying ideas, 
Dieudonne utilized the geometric properties of linear 
transformations and vector space theory to simplify 
and clarify Dickson’s work. Although Dieudonne's 
approach to the classical linear groups is much more 
elegant than Dickson’s, his methods still required that 
each family of simple groups be treated individually 
and he found no new simple groups. Thus, simple 
group theory was revitalized in 1955 when Cheval- 
ley, in his celebrated paper [22], introduced a new 
approach which provided a uniform method for in­
vestigating three kinds of the classical linear groups 
and Dickson’s simple groups of Lie type as well. In 
addition to encompassing most of the then-known 
simple groups, his method also yielded several new 
infinite families of finite simple groups.
This was accomplished in the following way. With 
every pair (L, K) where L is a Lie algebra over the 
complex numbers (i.e., an algebra whose associa­
tive law is replaced by the Jacobi identity and also 
satisfies the condition x2 =0 for all x) and K is a 
field, a new Lie algebra LK is constructed. Chevalley 
was able to associate with every such pair a certain 
subgroup of the automorphism group of LK which 
is simple. With the appropriate choice of L and K 
these simple groups are those investigated by Jor­
dan, Dickson, and Dieudonne. With other choices of 
L and K Chevalley obtained his new simple groups 
(the smallest of these has order 22436527213 • 17). 
These groups were the first new simple groups found 
in more than 50 years. That they were indeed new 
was established by comparing their orders with the 
orders of the simple groups which had been known. 
The formulas for the orders of the Chevalley groups 
over finite fields were derived by using topological 
properties of the Lie group of the same type. Artin 
[1] developed a new classification scheme for the 
known simple groups which included the Chevalley 
groups. He used fewer classes than did Dickson and 
Dieudonne and his method considerably improved 
theirs (see also [2]).
12 Groups of Lie type
During the period 1958-1959 Chevalley’s methods 
were extended and modified by Robert Steinberg, 
Jacques Tits, and D. Hertzig (see [21]) to obtain addi­
tional new infinite families of simple groups and the 
classical groups not handled by Chevalley. Shortly 
thereafter, Suzuki [73], while in the process of clas­
sifying a certain type of doubly transitive permu­
tation groups, also discovered another new infinite 
family. Analyzing the Suzuki groups, Rimhak Ree 
noticed that when interpreted from a Lie-theoretical 
point of view, they were closely related to a cer­
tain family of Chevalley groups. He then showed 
that the method of Steinberg could be used to con­
struct the Suzuki groups. This in turn led him to 
investigate two other similar situations and eventu­
ally discover his two families of simple groups ([68], 
[69]). The Suzuki and Ree groups, together with those 
of Chevalley and Steinberg, are collectively referred 

GALLIAN: The Search for Finite Simple Groups
261
to as the simple groups of Lie type. These, together 
with the alternating groups An (n > 5), account for 
all but 26 or so of the finite simple groups known to 
date.
The Suzuki groups are noteworthy for another 
reason. They provided the first examples of sim­
ple groups whose orders are not divisible by 3, and 
Thompson, in a major classification theorem, has re­
cently shown that these are the only possible such 
groups. The elements of the Suzuki groups are cer­
tain 4 x 4 matrices with entries from the Galois fields 
of order 22n+1, again illustrating the extremely im­
portant role that matrix groups over finite fields play 
in simple group theory.
13 Sporadic simple groups
A simple group which no one has yet been able to fit 
into an infinite class of simple groups ina natural way 
is called a sporadic simple group. For example, An 
and PSL(n, q) are infinite families of simple groups 
while the five Mathieu groups are sporadic. In the 
classification schemes of Dickson, Dieudonne, and 
Artin only the five Mathieu groups are sporadic and 
no new ones were discovered until Zvonimir Janko 
found one of order 175,560 in 1966 [57]. Remarkably, 
the discoveries of Mathieu and Janko are separated by 
more than one hundred years. Using other results of 
Janko, M. Hall proved [49] the existence ofa sporadic 
simple group of order 604,800 in 1967. This brought 
to 56 the number of known simple groups of order 
less than 1,000,000, and to 7 the number of sporadic 
simple groups. Paraphrasing Gorenstein ([47], p. 14) 
we recount the following anecdote in connection with 
Hall’s simple group:
Shortly after Hall constructed his group he gave 
a lecture on it at Oxford. Donald Higman and 
Charles Sims were in the audience and they were 
both struck by the fact that one of the Mathieu 
groups had certain permutation properties anal­
ogous to those ofa group which Hall had used in 
his construction. That very same night this ob­
servation led them to the construction of a new 
sporadic simple group!
Hall’s method has also led to the discovery of two 
others by analogous methods. By now there are 26 or 
so sporadic simple groups and it has been proved that 
there are exactly 56 simple groups of order less than 
1,000,000. (Of late, new sporadic simple groups are 
being discovered so frequently that it is difficult for 
one to be sure of their precise number.)
Some of the sporadic simple groups have been dis­
covered in the course of solving certain problems in 
permutation group theory, while others have turned 
up as the automorphism group of a distance-transitive 
graph (see Chapter 4 and the Appendix in [6]). 
Quite often, two or more sporadic groups are related 
in some way. Indeed, the Conway .1 simple group 
contains 12 sporadic simple groups as subgroups! 
The existence of many of these recently-discovered 
groups has been verified by means of a permuta­
tion representation of the group and extensive use of 
computers.
An important technique which has led to the dis­
covery of a number of sporadic simple groups in­
volves the notion of the centralizer of an involution 
(i.e., of an element of order 2). This method is em­
ployed in the following way. Choose H to be the 
centralizer ofan involution from some known simple 
group G. Next, assume G* is any simple group which 
contains an involution x such that C(x) is isomorphic 
to H. (By a theorem of Brauer and Fowler [10] only a 
finite number of such groups can exist, so H “almost” 
determines G.) Then a great deal of information about 
G* can be obtained. With this information it is often 
possible to show that G* is isomorphic to G or to 
some other known simple group. For example Dieter 
Held [53] has proved such a theorem when G = A8 or 
A9. Ifit cannot be shown that G* must be isomorphic 
to some known simple group, the information may be 
adequate to suggest a method of constructing a new 
simple group. Held [54] has also been instrumental 
in accomplishing this. He began with the observation 
that P SL(5, 2) and the largest Mathieu group pos­
sess involutions with isomorphic centralizers, and no 
other known simple group has this property. Choos­
ing this for H , he was led to three possible configu­
rations for G*. Ultimately, enough properties of this 
third group were derived so that Graham Higman and 
John McKay were able to construct it with the use of 
a computer.
Similarly, one may proceed by assuming Gisasim- 
ple group which contains an involution whose cen­
tralizer closely resembles the form ofa centralizer of 
an involution from a known simple group. In this case, 
if the information about G is not self-contradictory 
it suggests the possible existence of a new simple 
group and may be sufficient to lead to an actual con­
struction of the group. This is how Janko discovered 
his simple group of order 175,560. Each member of 
a family of simple groups discovered by Ree has a 
centralizer isomorphic to Z2 x P SL(2, 3n ) and has 
its Sylow 2-subgroups isomophic to Z2 x Z2 x Z2 . 

262
Algebra and Number Theory
Janko set out to determine all simple groups which 
have a centralizer isomorphic to Z2 x PSL(2,pn)), 
p odd, and with Sylow 2-subgroups isomorphic to 
Z2 x Z2 x Z2 . Eventually he was able to show that 
either p =3and the group is of Ree type or pn =5. 
The information he obtained about this latter case led 
him to write down a pair of 7 x 7 matrices with en­
tries in the field of order 11 which generated a new 
simple group.
This method was also recently used independently 
by Bernd Fischer and Thompson and by Robert Griess 
to discover a possible new simple group. This object, 
called the Monster M, is not defined in terms of gen­
erators and relations. In fact, it has not been defined 
at all! What Fischer, Thompson and Griess did was 
to assume that there exists a finite simple group M 
that satisfies certain hypotheses. They showed, un­
der this assumption, that M would be in fact a new 
simple group (i.e., not isomorphic to any existing sim­
ple group). They also obtained a great deal of other 
information about M, such as its order, properties 
of certain subgroups, and a portion of its charac­
ter table. Thompson has computed the order of M 
to be
808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,
757,005,754,368,000,000,000
= 246 • 320 • 59 • 76 • 112 • 133 • 17 • 19 • 23 • 29 •
31 • 41 • 59 • 71
(hence the name). If there is a simple group satisfying 
the stipulated hypothesis we should be able to deduce 
what it must look like, and once we know what it looks 
like, we should be able to define it. For the Monster 
M this last step has not yet been accomplished.
A certain section of M (i.e., a group of the form 
H/K, where H and K are subgroups of M and K is 
normal in H), the Baby Monster B, is also a possible 
new simple group. Fischer has computed the order of 
B to be
4,154,781,481,226,426,191,177,580,544,000,000
= 241 • 313 • 56 • 72 • 11 • 13 • 17 • 19 • 23 • 41 • 47.
Of course, neither of the groups M or B has yet been 
shown to exist.
In addition to the role the centralizers of involu­
tions play in the discovery of new simple groups, 
these subgroups are important for another reason. 
There is presently under way a systematic attempt 
to use the centralizers of involutions as a means for 
classifying all the known finite simple groups. This 
program began in 1954 with Brauer’s characterization 
of P SL(3, q), q odd, and is now almost complete. Ac­
cording to Gorenstein ([47], p. 21),
Probably more individuals have been involved in 
this effort than in any other single area of simple 
group theory.
We refer the reader to section 4.4 of [36] for a survey 
of results of this type.
14 Thompson’s N-paper
Most simple groups contain other simple groups as 
subgroups. For example,
A 5 C A 6 C A 7 C • • • .
On the other hand, a minimal simple group is one, 
all of whose proper subgroups are solvable. It fol­
lows then that every simple group has a minimal sim­
ple group as a section. Minimal simple groups are 
therefore basic and the complete determination of all 
such groups would clearly be of great value. In the 
early 1960s Thompson set out to do just this. Such an 
endeavor was a natural successor to the Odd Order 
Theorem since the minimal counterexample G in that 
proof was a minimal simple group. Actually, Thomp­
son decided to tackle a more general classification 
problem. The normalizer of a non-identity solvable 
subgroup of a group G is called a local subgroup of 
G and an N-group is one in which all local subgroups 
are solvable. Evidently, every minimal simple group 
is also an N -group.
As early as 1963, Thompson had concluded that, 
with only finitely many exceptions, the simple N- 
groups were PSL(2, q) (q>3) and the Suzuki 
groups. The complete classification of all non- 
solvable N -groups however, did not come until sev­
eral years later. The 407-page proof (!!) [75] of 
this remarkable theorem is spread out over six jour­
nal issues during the seven-year period 1968-1974. 
Describing his approach, Thompson writes ([75], 
p. 383):
In a broad way, this paper may be thought of 
as a successful transformation of the theory of 
solvable groups to the theory of simple groups. 
By this is meant that a substantial structure is 
constructed which makes it possible to exploit 
properties of solvable groups to obtain delicate 

GALLIAN: The Search for Finite Simple Groups
263
information about the structure and embedding 
of many solvable subgroups of the simple group 
under consideration. In this way, routine results 
about solvable groups acquire great power.
(An essay which outlines the organization of the proof 
and discusses some of the arguments used is given in 
[46], pp. 473-480.)
This result has a number of important corollaries, 
the most important of which is a classification of all 
minimal simple groups. A few consequences of this 
corollary are mentioned in the next two sections. For 
his many profound contributions to simple group the­
ory, Thompson was awarded the Fields Medal—the 
mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize—by the 
International Congress of Mathematicians in 1970.
15 The paqbrc problem
One of the corollaries of Thompson’s result classify­
ing the minimal simple groups seems to have put 
the solution of a very difficult, well-known prob­
lem within reach. This problem concerns the natural 
generalization of Burnside’s pa qb theorem to three 
primes. Since there are eight known simple groups 
which have orders divisible by exactly three distinct 
primes, the logical extension of Burnside’s result 
would be the complete determination of all simple 
groups with orders of the formpaqbrc. The first steps 
in this direction were taken by Burnside, Frobenius 
and E. Maillet. For example, Burnside [14] showed 
that there is no simple group whose order has the 
form pqbr, where p<q<r. Fifty years later Brauer 
and Hsio Tuan [12] used character theory to show that 
except for the groups P SL(2, 5) and P SL(2, 7), the 
restriction that p<q<rwas unnecessary. In 1962 
and again in 1968 Brauer ([8], [9]) returned to this 
problem and determined all simple groups whose or­
ders have the form paqbr, where a =1or 2, or the 
form 2a3b5.
In spite of the fact that Brauer and his predeces­
sors had solved the “three-prime problem” in numer­
ous special cases, the complete solution was far from 
sight until Thompson proved his result. Specifically, 
he proved that a simple group whose order is divisible 
by exactly three distinct primes must have one of
PSL(2,4), PSL(2,7), PSL(2,8), 
PSL(2, 17) or PSL(3, 3)
as a section. From this it follows that such a group 
must have order of the form 2a3bpc where p is 5, 7, 
13 or 17. Then, since character theory is a natural 
tool for analyzing groups whose orders have a prime 
to the first power only, David Wales [76] used it in 
conjunction with the N -paper to determine all sim­
ple groups (8 of them) whose orders have the form 
2a 3bpc. Finally, Kenneth Klinger and Geoffrey Ma­
son are presently in the midst of showing (they hope) 
that there are no simple groups with orders of the 
form 2a3bpc with c>1. Of course, the completion 
of this work will finish the pa qcrc problem.
16 The range problem to
1,000,000
At the suggestion of Brauer, Sister Michaels, in her 
1963 Ph.D. dissertation [62], showed that there was 
no known simple group in the range 6232 to 20,000. 
Her work was superseded during the late 1960s and 
early 1970s when the range problem was taken up 
by M. Hall ([49], [50]). Using a wide assortment 
of methods from elementary to advanced, as well as 
a computer, he succeeded in eliminating all but 21 
of the first 1,000,000 integers as possible orders for 
new simple groups. For the integers not eliminated 
by elementary considerations, the theory of modular 
characters and Thompson’s result on minimal simple 
groups played an important role. The character theory 
yields integer equations which certain parameters of 
the group must satisfy and a computer was used to 
make the verifications. Every simple group must have 
a section which is a minimal simple group, and so the 
order of any simple group is divisible by the order 
of a minimal simple group. Hall was able to show 
that from among Thompson’s list of minimal simple 
groups only
PSL(2,5), PSL(2,7), PSL(2,8), 
PSL(2, 13),P SL(2, 17),P SL(3, 3), 
PSL(2, 23) and PSL(2, 27)
could occur as a section of an unknown simple group 
of order less than 1,000,000. From a result of Goren- 
stein it then follows that such a group has order divisi­
ble by 840 or 2184. Eventually the list was pared down 
to 1146 integers which required individual consider­
ation. The first paper [49] eliminates all but about 
100 of these and the second paper [50] reduces the 
list to 21.
Then Paul Fong [39] classified all simple groups 
whose Sylow 2-subgroups have order at most 26 and 
this reduced Hall’s list to 13 integers as possible orders

Algebra and Number Theory
for new simple groups of order less than 1,000,000. 
Finally, the range problem to 1,000,000 was recently 
finished when two students of Held, Bert Beisiegel 
and Volker Stingl [3], eliminated the remaining inte­
gers on Hall’s list by extending Fong’s work as far as 
the case 210.
In conclusion we mention that even though the 
range problem is not the central one in simple group 
theory, this achievement is a dramatic illustration of 
how far the theory has progressed in the years since 
Holder determined the simple groups of order up to 
200.

A Simple Song
For readers who have difficulty in keeping track of the 
history of simple group theory we offer the following 
summary in ballad form. This classic first appeared in 
print in 1973 in the American Mathematical Monthly 
(p. 1028) where it is claimed to have been found 
scrawled on a table in Eckhart Library at the Uni­
versity of Chicago. The author, possibly for cause, is 
claimed to be unknown. The tune is that of “Sweet 
Betsy from Pike”.
Oh, what are the orders of all simple groups?
I speak of the honest ones, not of the loops.
It seems that old Burnside their orders has 
guessed
Except for the cyclic ones, even the rest.
CHORUS: Finding all groups that are simple 
is no simple task.
Groups made up with permutes will produce 
Some more:
For An is simple, if n exceeds 4.
Then, there was Sir Matthew who came into 
view
Exhibiting groups of an order quite new.
Still others have come on to study this thing.
Of Artin and Chevalley now we shall sing. 
With matrices finite they made quite a list 
The question is: Could there be others they’ve 
missed?
Suzuki and Ree then maintained it’s the case 
That these methods had not reached the end 
of the chase.

270
Algebra and Number Theory
They wrote down some matrices, just four by 
four,
That made up a simple group. Why not make 
more?
And then came the opus of Thompson and 
Feit
Which shed on the problem remarkable light. 
A group, when the order won’t factor by two 
Is cyclic or solvable. That’s what is true.
Suzuki and Ree had caused eyebrows to raise, 
But the theoreticians they just couldn’t faze. 
Their groups were not new: if you added a 
twist,
You could get them from old ones with a flick 
of the wrist.
Still, some hardy souls felt a thorn in their 
side.
For the five groups of Mathieu all reason de­
fied;
Not An, not twisted, and not Chevalley, 
They called them sporadic and filed them 
away.
Are Mathieu groups creatures of heaven or 
hell?
Zvonimir Janko determined to tell.
He found out that nobody wanted to know: 
Themastershadmissed175560.
The floodgates were opened! New groups 
were the rage!
(And twelve or more sprouted, to greet the 
new age.)
By Janko and Conway and Fischer and Held 
McLaughlin, Suzuki, and Higman, and Sims.
No doubt you noted the last lines don’t rhyme. 
Well, that is, quite simply, a sign of the time. 
There’s chaos, not order, among simple 
groups;
And maybe we’d better go back to the loops.

Genius and Biographers:
The Fictionalization of Evariste Galois
TONY ROTHMAN
American Mathematical Monthly 89 (1982), 84-106
1 
Introduction
In Paris, on the obscure morning of May 30, 1832, 
near a pond not far from the pension Sieur Faultrier, 
Evariste Galois confronted Pescheux d’Herbinville 
in a duel to be fought with pistols, and was shot 
through the stomach. Hours later, lying wounded and 
alone, Galois was found by a passing peasant. He 
was taken to the Hospital Cochin where he died the 
following day in the arms of his brother Alfred, after 
having refused the services of a priest. Had Galois 
lived another five months, until October 25, he would 
have attained the age of twenty-one.
The legend of Evariste Galois, creator of group 
theory, has fired the imagination of generations of 
mathematics students. Many of us have experienced 
the excitement of Freeman Dyson who writes ([8], 
p. 14):
In those days, my head was full of the romantic 
prose of E. T. Bell’s Men of Mathematics, a col­
lection of biographies of the great mathemati­
cians. This is a splendid book for a young boy to 
read (unfortunately, there is not much in it to in­
spire a girl, with Sonya Kovalevsky allotted only 
half a chapter), and it has awakened many people 
ofmy generation to the beauties of mathematics. 
The most memorable chapter is called “Genius 
and Stupidity” and describes the life and death 
of the French mathematician Galois, who was 
killed in a duel at the age of twenty.
Dyson goes on to quote Bell’s famous description 
([1], p. 375) of Galois’s last night before the duel:
All night long he had spent the fleeting hours 
feverishly dashing off his scientific last will and 
testament, writing against time to glean a few of 
the great things in his teeming mind before the 
death which he saw could overtake him. Time 
after time he broke off to scribble in the margin 
“I have not time; I have not time,” and passed 
on to the next frantically scrawled outline. What 
he wrote in those last desperate hours before the 
dawn will keep generations of mathematicians 
busy for hundreds of years. He had found, once 
and for all, the true solution of a riddle which had 
tormented mathematicians for centuries: under 
what conditions can an equation be solved?
This extract is likely the very paragraph which has 
given the greatest impetus to the Galois legend. As 
with all legends the truth has become one of many 
threads in the embroidery. E. T. Bell has embroi­
dered more than most, but he is not alone. James 
R. Newman, writing in The World of Mathematics 
([16], Vol. 3, p. 1534) notes: “The term group was 
first used in a technical sense by the French mathe­
matician Evariste Galois in 1830. He wrote his bril­
liant paper on the subject at the age of twenty, the 
night before he was killed in a stupid duel.” From 
a description in the famed Bullitt archives of math­
ematics [5] issued by the University of Louisville 
library, we learn: “Goaded by a ‘mignonne’ and two 
of her slattern confederates into a ‘duel of honor’, 
Galois was shot and killed at the age of 20.” Leopold 
Infeld, in his biography of Galois [13], invokes a con­
spiracy theory to explain Galois’s death: Galois was 
considered one of the most dangerous republicans in 
Paris; the government wanted to get rid of him; a fe­
male agent provocateur set him up for the duel with 
d’Herbinville; et cetera. Fred Hoyle, in his Ten Faces 
of the Universe ([11], Chapter 1), attempts a partial 
271

272
Algebra and Number Theory
inversion of the argument: Galois’s ability to carry on 
complex calculations entirely in his head made him 
appear distant to others; personal animosities arose 
with his republican friends; they began to think he 
was not fully for the cause; Galois in their eyes was 
the agent provocateur; et cetera. All three authors, 
Bell, Hoyle, and Infeld, invoke a political cause for 
the duel, with a mysterious coquette just off center.
This article is an attempt to sift some of the facts 
of Galois’s life from the embroidery. It will not be an 
entirely complete account and will assume the reader 
is familiar with the story, presumably through Bell’s 
version. Because these authors have emphasized the 
end of Galois’s life, I will do so here. As will become 
apparent, many of the statements just cited are at 
worst nonsensical, and at best have no basis in the 
known facts.
Although a number of the documents presented 
here are, I believe, translated into English for the 
first time, it should be emphasized that they are not 
new, just ignored. There is more known about Galois 
than recent authors admit. It is my hope that some 
ambitious historian will find the requisite letter in 
an attic trunk or a newspaper clipping in the Paris 
archives to unravel the remaining mysteries.
2 
Sources
It is not difficult to trace the story of Galois’s brief 
life through its increasingly embellished incarnations. 
The primary source of information, containing eye­
witness accounts and many relevant documents, is 
the original study of Paul Dupuy [7], which appeared 
in 1896. Dupuy was a historian and the Surveillant 
General of the Ecole Normale. Bell, Hoyle, and In­
feld all cite it as an important reference but never 
once explicitly quote it. Indeed, Bell acknowledges 
([1], p. vii) that his account is based on Dupuy and 
the documents in Tannery [19] (see below), but it 
remains unclear how much Bell has read of Dupuy; 
for while numerous passages are lifted bodily from 
Dupuy, other important information in the latter is 
strangely absent. Dupuy’s study itself is lacking a 
number of important letters and documents. Whether 
Dupuy was unaware of their existence or chose not to 
publish them I do not know. He also makes a number 
of minor errors in chronology. In any case, the first 
lesson is already learned: those who use Dupuy as 
their sole source of information must make mistakes. 
Nevertheless, this original biography is much more 
complete and accurate than the subsequent dilutions 
and contains more information than a reading of Bell, 
Hoyle, or Infeld would even suggest. A translation of 
Dupuy into English should be undertaken.
Some of the documents not found in Dupuy are 
contained in Tannery’s 1908 edition [19] of Galois’s 
papers. All are contained in the definitive 1962 edi­
tion [4] of Bourgne and Azra. This volume contains 
every scrap of paper known to have been written by 
Galois, an accurate chronology, facsimiles of some 
of his original manuscripts, and a number of relevant 
letters by others. When quoting Galois, I have worked 
exclusively from this edition.
The memoirs of Alexandre Dumas ([6], Vol. 4, 
Chapter 204) contain a pertinent chapter, and the Let- 
tres sur les Prisons du Paris by Francois Vincent Ra- 
spail ([17], Vol. 2) are the primary source on Galois’s 
months in prison. Some of these letters are quoted by 
Dupuy and Infeld. Other references will be cited as 
they appear.

Early life and Louis-le-Grand
I will not dwell at length on the first sixteen years of 
Galois’s life, for they are reported with fair accuracy 
by Bell. This is not surprising; his account approaches 
that of a somewhat abridged translation of Dupuy. The 
divergences will set in later. Thus this section and the 
next may be taken as a rather condensed review and 
criticism of Bell. Infeld and Hoyle, who concentrate 
most of their energies on the duel, will be dealt with 
at the appropriate time.
Evariste Galois was born on October 25, 1811, not 
far from Paris in the town of Bourg-la-Reine, France. 
His father was Nicholas-Gabriel Galois, who was then 
thirty-six years of age, and his mother was Adelaide- 
Marie Demante. Both parents were highly intelligent 
and well educated in the subjects considered impor­
tant at the time: philosophy, classical literature, and 
religion. Bell points out that there is no record of any 
mathematical talent on either side of the family. A 
more neutral statement should perhaps be made: no 
record exists in favor of or against any such talent. M. 
Galois did possess the talent for composing rhymed 
couplets with which he would amuse neighbors. This 
harmless activity, as Bell notes, would later cause his 
undoing. Evariste seems to have inherited some of 
this ability, participating in the fun at house parties. 
For the first twelve years of his life, Evariste’s mother 
served as his sole teacher, giving him a solid back­
ground in Greek and Latin, as well as passing on her 
own skepticism toward religion.
In 1815, during The One Hundred Days, M. Galois 
was elected mayor of Bourg-la-Reine. He had been a 

ROTHMAN: Genius and Biographers: The Fictionalization of Evariste Galois
273
supporter of Napoleon and, in fact, had been elected 
chief of the town’s liberal party during Napoleon’s 
first exile. After Waterloo, he had planned to relin­
quish his post to his predecessor, but the latter had left 
the country. Galois demanded to be either confirmed 
or replaced, and in the confusion managed to keep his 
office. He served the new King faithfully, but from 
this point on he met increasing resistance from the 
conservative elements of his town. It is probably safe 
to say that the younger Galois inherited his liberal 
ideas from his parents.
On October 6, 1823, Evariste was enrolled in 
the Lycee of Louis-le-Grand, a famous preparatory 
school (which still exists) in Paris. Both Robespierre 
and Victor Hugo had studied there. Louis-le-Grand 
is where Evariste’s troubles began, where Infeld’s ac­
count of his life essentially opens, and where Bell in­
troduces his theme of “Genius and Stupidity”, taking 
on the tone ofa blanket condemnation of almost ev­
eryone and everything that surrounded Galois. “Ga­
lois was no ‘ineffectual angel’,” Bell writes in his 
introduction ([1], p. 362), “but even his magnificent 
powers were shattered before the massed stupidity 
aligned against him, and he beat out his life fighting 
one unconquerable fool after another.” I believe we 
will see that the problems ran much deeper than that.
Bell’s first liberties with Dupuy are minor. Bell de­
scribes Louis-le-Grand as a “dismal horror” and goes 
on to say “the place looked like a prison and was” 
([1], p. 363). Admittedly, Dupuy writes that Louis- 
le-Grand happened to look like a jail because of its 
grills, but he then goes on ([7], p. 203) to describe 
the underlying “passions of work, academic triumph, 
passions of liberal ideas, passions of memories of 
the Revolution and the Empire, contempt and hate 
for the legitimist reaction.” Bell, by cutting Dupuy’s 
sentence in half, has begun the slant toward the 
negative.
At this particular time, there were problems. Dur­
ing Galois’s first term, the students, who suspected 
the new provisor of planning to return the conserva­
tive Jesuits to the school, protested by staging a minor 
rebellion. When required to sing at a chapel service, 
they refused. When required to recite in class, they 
refused. When required to toast King Louis XVIII at 
an official school banquet, they refused. The provi­
sor summarily expelled the forty students whom he 
suspected of leading the insurrection. Galois was not 
among those expelled, nor is it known if he was even 
among the rebels, but we may guess that the arbitrari­
ness of the provisor and the general severity of the 
school’s regime made a deep impression on him.
Nevertheless, Galois’s first two years at Louis-le­
Grand were marked by a number of successes. He 
received a prize in the General Concourse and three 
mentions. At this point we witness the first of Bell’s 
distortions of chronology to give the impression that 
Galois was misunderstood and persecuted. Galois 
was asked to repeat his third year because of his poor 
work in rhetoric. Bell writes, “His mathematical ge­
nius was already stirring,” and “He was forced to lick 
up the stale leavings which his genius had rejected” 
([1], p. 364; compare with [7], p. 205). I cannot say 
for certain whether Galois’s mathematical genius was 
already stirring, but it is known that Galois did not 
enroll in his first mathematics course until after he 
had been demoted.
During this first mathematics course, which he 
began in February 1827, Galois discovered Legen­
dre’s text on geometry, soon followed by Lagrange’s 
original memoirs: Resolution of Numerical Equa­
tions [= Algebraic Equations], Theory of Analytic 
Functions, and Lessons on the Calculus of Func­
tions. Doubtlessly, Galois received his initial ideas 
on the theory of equations from Lagrange. I do 
not understand why Bell claims Galois’s classwork 
was mediocre; his instructor, M. Vernier, constantly 
writes such accolades as “zeal and success”, “zeal 
and progress very marked” ([7], pp. 255-256).
With his discovery of mathematics, Galois became 
absorbed and neglected his other courses. Before en­
rolling in M. Vernier’s class, typical comments about 
him had been ([7], pp. 254-255):
Religious Duties—Good 
Conduct—Good 
Disposition—Happy
Work—Sustained
Progress—Marked
Character—Good, but 
singular
After a trimester in M. Vernier’s class, the comments 
were:
Religious Duties—Good
Conduct—Passable
Disposition—Happy
Work—Inconstant
Progress—Not very 
satisfactory
Character—Closed 
and original
The words “singular”, “bizarre”, “original”, and 
“closed” would appear more and more frequently dur­
ing the course of Galois’s career at Louis-le-Grand. 
His own family began to think him strange. His 
rhetoric teachers would term him “dissipated”. Bell 
discusses these remarks at some length. His use of 
the indefinite pronoun “they” gives the impression 
that the entire faculty was aligned against Galois. 

274
Algebra and Number Theory
A perusal of Dupuy’s appendix, however, shows the 
negative remarks were penned, by and large, by Ga­
lois’s two rhetoric teachers. Until this point in his life, 
I believe it fair to say that Galois was somewhat mis­
understood by his teachers in the humanities, but not 
that he was persecuted.
Slightly more serious problems were soon to arise. 
His mathematics teacher, M. Vernier, constantly im­
plored Galois to work more systematically. His re­
mark on one of Galois’s trimester reports makes this 
clear ([7], p. 256):
Intelligence, marked progress, but not enough 
method.
Galois did not take the advice; he took the entrance 
examination to l’Ecole Polytechnique a year early, 
without the usual special course in mathematics, and 
failed. Apparently he did not know some basics. To 
Galois, his failure was a complete denial of justice. 
This and subsequent rejections embittered him for 
life. When we examine some of his later writings, I 
think it will be evident that he developed not a little 
paranoia.
Galois did not yet give up. The same year, 1828, 
saw him enroll in the course of Louis-Paul-Emile 
Richard, a distinguished instructor of mathematics. 
Richard encouraged Galois immensely, even pro­
claimed that he should be admitted to the Poly­
technique without examination. The results of such 
encouragement were spectacular. In April of 1829, 
Galois published his first small paper, “Proof of a The­
orem on Periodic Continued Fractions”. It appeared 
in the Annales de Gergonne.
This paper was a minor aside. Galois had also been 
working on the theory of equations (Galois theory). 
On May 25 and June 1, 1829, while still only 17, he 
submitted to the Academy his first researches on the 
solubility of equations of prime degree. Cauchy was 
appointed referee.
We now encounter a major myth which evidently 
has its origins in the very first writings on Galois and 
which has been perpetuated by virtually all writers 
since. This myth is the assertion that Cauchy either 
forgot or lost the papers (Dupuy [7], p. 209, Bell [1], 
p. 368) or intentionally threw them out (Infeld [13], 
p. 306). Recently, however, Rene Taton [20] has dis­
covered a letter of Cauchy in the Academy archives 
which conclusively proves that he did not lose Ga­
lois’s memoirs but had planned to present them to the 
Academy in January 1830. There is even some evi­
dence that Cauchy encouraged Galois. The letter and 
related events will be discussed in more detail later; 
for now we note only that to hold Cauchy responsible 
for “one of the major disasters in the history of math­
ematics”, to paraphrase Bell ([1], p. 368), is simply 
incorrect, and to add neglect by the Academy to the 
list of Galois’s difficulties during this period appears 
entirely unwarranted.
A truly tragic blow came within a month of the 
submissions: on the second of July, 1829, Galois’s 
father committed suicide. The reactionary priest of 
Bourg-la-Reine had signed Mayor Galois’s name to 
a number of maliciously forged epigrams directed at 
Galois’s own relatives. A scandal erupted. M. Galois’s 
good nature could not withstand such an attack and 
he asphyxiated himself in his Paris apartment “not 
two steps from Louis-le-Grand.” During the funeral, 
when the same clergyman attempted to participate, a 
small riot erupted. The loss of his father may explain 
much of Galois’s future behavior. We must wait a few 
years, until Evariste’s second prison term, to see this. 
In any case, he loved his father dearly, and if an iron 
link had not already been forged between the Bourbon 
government and the Jesuits, it had now. (Probably the 
clearest picture of the relationship between the Jesuits 
and the Bourbons, one which contains episodes par­
alleling that of M. Galois’s misfortunes, is Stendhal’s 
famous novel The Red and The Black.)
But Galois’s troubles were not yet over. A few days 
later, he failed his examination to l’Ecole Polytech­
nique for the second and final time. Legend has it 
that Galois, who worked almost entirely in his head 
and who was poor at presenting his ideas verbally, 
became so enraged at the stupidity of the examiner 
that he hurled an eraser at him. Bell records this ([1], 
p. 369) as a fact, although Dupuy specifically states 
([7], p. 211) that it is only an unverified tradition. The 
examination failures, as well as the misunderstand­
ing of his humanities teachers, left him irrevocably 
embittered. Bell quotes him as writing ([1], p. 371), 
“Genius is condemned by a malicious social orga­
nization to an eternal denial of justice in favor of 
fawning mediocrity.” I believe Bell constructed this 
quotation from a passage of Dupuy ([7], p. 217), but 
Galois did express similar sentiments in his fragmen­
tary essay “Sciences Hierarchie: Ecoles” and in “Sur 
l’Enseignment des Sciences” (“Hierarchy is a means 
for the inferior.” ([4], p. 27). In Bell’s diatribe against 
this famous examination, as well as in other accounts 
of it, the suggestion that the death of Galois’s father 
several days before may have had something to do 
with the outcome never arises. Itis a simple matter for 
Bell to lay the fault squarely with the examiner’s stu­
pidity because Bell has placed the examination before 

ROTHMAN: Genius and Biographers: The Fictionalization of Evariste Galois
275
M. Galois’s unfortunate suicide. In this case, Bell is 
not fully to blame; Dupuy does not date the examina­
tion (I assume here, as elsewhere, the chronology in 
[4], pp. xxvii-xxxi). I do not wish to suggest Galois 
should not have been failed. I only wish to point out 
that the examination must have been held under the 
worst possible conditions.
Thus, Galois’s secondary school career ended in 
a string of minor setbacks and two major disasters. 
Evariste had not planned to take the Baccalaureate ex­
aminations, because the Ecole Polytechnique did not 
require them. Now, having failed the Polytechnique’s 
entrance examination and having decided to enter the 
less prestigious Ecole Normale, he was forced to re­
consider. “Still persecuted and maliciously misunder­
stood by his preceptors,” in Bell’s words ([1], p. 370) 
“Galois prepared himself for the final examinations.” 
Despite such malice, Galois did very well in math­
ematics and physics, although less well in literature. 
He received both a Bachelor of Letters and a Bachelor 
of Science on the twenty-ninth of December, 1829.
Itis interesting to note that, although he has contin­
ued to play the role of muckraker of malice, Bell has 
failed to mention M. Richards distinct cooling toward 
Galois, on whom he had previously bestowed enco­
mia. After the first trimester of the 1828-1829 aca­
demic year, Richard wrote: “This student is markedly 
superior to all his classmates.” After the second: “This 
student works only in the highest realms of Mathe­
matics.” After the third: “Conduct good, work satis­
factory.”
Because I do not have an accurate date for this re­
port, I cannot propose a specific event as the cause 
of this obvious change in attitude. Presumably, it oc­
curred in the spring of 1829, shortly before or after 
Galois’s time of troubles began. One could, of course, 
argue that M. Richard had simply become bored with 
Galois. Otherwise, it does serve to show that Bell’s 
black-and-white presentation of Galois’s preceptors 
is an oversimplification.

L’Ecole Normale
The early months of 1830, which saw Galois offi­
cially enrolled as a student at l’Ecole Normale, also 
witnessed an interesting series of transactions with 
the Academy. As will be recalled, Galois submitted 
his first researches to the Academy on May 25 and 
June 1 of 1829. On January 18, 1830, Cauchy wrote 
the previously mentioned letter discovered by Taton 
([20], p. 134):
I was supposed to present today to the Academy 
first a report on the work of the young Galois, 
and second a memoir on the analytic determina­
tion of primitive roots in which I show how one 
can reduce this determination to the solution of 
numerical equations of which all roots are pos­
itive integers. Am indisposed at home. I regret 
not to be able to attend today’s session, and I 
would like you to schedule me for the following 
session for the two indicated subjects.
Please accept my homage . . .
A.-L. Cauchy
This letter makes it clear that, six months after 
their receipt, Cauchy was still in possession of Ga­
lois’s manuscripts, had read them, and very likely was 
aware of their importance. At the following session 
on 25 January, however, Cauchy, while presenting his 
own memoir mentioned above, did not present Ga­
lois’s work. Taton hypothesizes that between January 
18 and January 25, Cauchy persuaded Galois to com­
bine his researches into a single memoir to be submit­
ted for the Grand Prize in Mathematics, for which the 
deadline was March 1. Whether or not Cauchy actu­
ally made the suggestion cannot yet be proved, but in 
February Galois did submit such an entry to Fourier 
in his capacity as perpetual secretary of mathematics 
and physics for the Academy. In any case, there is an 
additional piece of evidence which attests to Cauchy’s 
appreciation of Galois’s work. This is an article ([20], 
p. 139) which appeared the following year on 15 June, 
1831, in the Saint-Simonian journal Le Globe. The 
occasion was an appeal for Galois’s acquittal after his 
arrest following the celebrated banquet at the Ven- 
danges des Bourgogne:
Last year before March 1, M. Galois gave to 
the secretary of the Institute a memoir on the 
solution of numerical equations. This memoir 
should have been entered in the competition for 
the Grand Prize in Mathematics. It deserved the 
prize, for it could resolve some difficulties that 
Lagrange had failed to do. M. Cauchy had con­
ferred the highest praise on the author about this 
subject. And what happened? The memoir is lost 
and the prize is given without the participation 
of the young savant. [Taton’s italics]
(My own interpretation of this article is slightly dif­
ferent from that of Taton. Taton writes that the jour­
nalist evidently had first-hand information. But note 
the date: 15 June 1831. In the aftermath of the July 

276
Algebra and Number Theory
revolution, Cauchy fled France during September, al­
most nine months prior to the article’s publication. 
It is difficult to see when the journalist would have 
spoken to Cauchy. However, the article appeared in 
a Saint-Simonian journal. Galois’s best friend, Au­
guste Chevalier, was one of the most active Saint- 
Simonians. My own suspicion, which I cannot prove, 
is that the journalist was Chevalier and the informa­
tion was coming directly from Galois. If this hypoth­
esis is correct, Galois himself is admitting Cauchy’s 
encouragement.)
The misfortune referred to above was the death of 
Fourier in April. Galois’s entry could not be found 
among Fourier’s papers. In Galois’s eyes this could 
not be an accident. “The loss of my memoir is a very 
simple matter,” he wrote ([4], p. xxix). “It was with M. 
Fourier, who was supposed to have read it and, at the 
death of this savant, the memoir was lost.” It was an 
unfortunate coincidence; however it was not Fourier’s 
sole responsibility to read the manuscript, for the 
committee appointed to judge the Grand Prize con­
sisted also of Lacroix, Poisson, Legendre, and Poinsot 
([20], p. 138). I mention this because a number of 
sources give the impression that somehow Fourier 
either intentionally lost the paper or could not under­
stand it (see, e.g., [14]).
In spite of the setback caused by the loss of his 
manuscript, April saw the publication of Galois’s pa­
per “An Analysis of a Memoir on the Algebraic Res­
olution of Equations” in the Bulletin de Ferussac. In 
June he published “Notes on the Resolution of Nu­
merical Equations” and the important article “On the 
Theory of Numbers” ([4], p. xxviii).
In addition to propagating the legend that Cauchy 
lost the manuscripts, Bell, curiously, does not men­
tion Fourier by name in the preceding misadven­
ture, although Dupuy is explicit on the identity of 
the Academy’s Perpetual Secretary. I do not under­
stand the reason for this omission unless Bell felt it 
a little too much to “expose” Cauchy, Fourier, and 
later Poisson, as incompetents. Bell also does not 
make it clear that the papers listed above (plus a later 
memoir) constitute what is now called “Galois the­
ory”. If this point had been clarified, the claim that 
Galois had written the theory down on the eve of 
the duel would be difficult to substantiate or even to 
suggest.
From this point onward, the scenario of Galois as a 
passive victim of negligence, misunderstanding, and 
bad luck begins to break down—if it has not already. 
More and more he participated in the creation of his 
own disasters. But this picture does not fit Bell’s plan.
Therefore chronology is rearranged, events are omit­
ted, and others invented in increasing quantity, until 
the end of his account is largely fantasy. The whole­
sale reordering of events will be especially evident in 
what follows.
Most important, Bell gives an extremely late start 
to Galois’s political activities. He remarks that had 
Evariste’s teachers at Louis-le-Grand allowed him to 
study only mathematics he might have lived to be 
eighty ([1], p. 366). Unlikely. According to Dupuy, 
one of the reasons Galois had hoped to attend the 
Polytechnique was to participate in political activi­
ties. At l’Ecole Normale he became a “polytechni­
cian in exile”. The July revolution of 1830 reared its 
head. The Director of l’Ecole Normale, M. Guigni- 
ault, locked the students in so that they would not be 
able to fight on the streets. Galois was so incensed 
at the decision that he tried to escape by scaling the 
walls. He failed, and in doing so missed the revolu­
tion. Afterwards, the Director put the students in the 
service of the provisional government. Charles X had 
fled France. He would be followed in September by 
Cauchy. Louis-Phillipe was the new King.
The events of July, severely abridged here, Bell 
chronicles accurately. He does fail to mention that 
Galois probably joined the Society of the Friends of 
the People, one of the most extreme republican secret 
societies, within the next month, certainly before De­
cember ([7], p. 221). The importance of this omission 
will be explained after we have filled in the remaining 
gaps of the narrative.
In December of that year, M. Guigniault was en­
gaging in polemics against students in the pages of 
several newspapers. Galois saw his chance for attack 
and jumped into the squabble with a blistering letter 
to the Gazette des Ecoles. It read in part ([4], p. 462; 
also [7], p. 225; translated in part in [13], Chapter 5):
Gentlemen:
The letter which M. Guigniault inserted yes­
terday in the Lycee on the occasion of one of the 
articles in your journal has seemed to me very 
inappropriate. I had thought that you would wel­
come with eagerness every means to expose this 
man.
Here are the facts which can be verified by 
forty-six students.
On the morning of July 28, when many of the 
students wished to leave the school and fight, M. 
Guigniault told them on two occasions that he 
would call the police to reestablish order within 
the school. The police on the 28th of July!

277
On the same day, M. Guigniault told us with 
his usual pedantry: “There are many brave men 
fighting on both sides. IfI were a soldier I would 
not know what to decide—to sacrifice liberty or 
legitimacy?”
Here is the man who the next day covered his 
hat with an immense tricolor cockade. Here are 
our liberal doctrines!
Galois continues. According to Dupuy, every state­
ment in the letter is accurate. Nonetheless, the result 
was what might have been anticipated: Galois was ex­
pelled. The action was to become official on January 
4, but Galois quit school immediately and joined the 
Artillery of the National Guard, a branch of the militia 
which was almost entirely composed of republicans. 
It is interesting that the forty-six students referred to 
in the letter actually published a reply against Galois, 
but this seems to have been at the “prompting” of 
M. Guigniault ([7], pp. 227-228).
December was a turbulent month for other reasons. 
After the Bourbons had fled France, four of their ex­
ministers were tried for treason. Popular sentiment 
called for their execution. The decision to execute or 
imprison for life was to be announced on December 
21. That day, the Artillery of the National Guard was 
stationed in the quadrangle at the Louvre. Galois was 
certainly there. The atmosphere was very tense. If 
the ministers were given a life sentence, the artillery­
men had planned to revolt. But the Louvre was soon 
surrounded by the full National Guard and troops of 
the line, more trustworthy arms of the military. A 
distant cannon shot was heard. It signaled the end 
of the trial and that the ministers had indeed been 
given imprisonment over execution. The artillerymen 
and the National Guard readied themselves for blood­
shed, but with the arrival at the Louvre of thousands 
of Parisians, the fighting did not erupt. Over the next 
few days, the situation in Paris grew calmer with 
the appearance of Lafayette, who called for peace, 
and daily proclamations calling for order. On De­
cember 31, 1830, the Artillery of the National Guard 
was abolished by royal decree in fear of its threat 
to the throne (account based on [3]; also see [13], 
Chapter 5).
In January 1831 Galois, no longer a student, at­
tempted to organize a private class in mathematics. 
At the first meeting, about forty students appeared 
([7], p. 234), but the endeavor did not last long, evi­
dently because of Galois’s political activities. On the 
17th of that month, upon the invitation of Poisson, 
Galois submitted a third version of his memoir to 
the Academy. Later, in July, Poisson would reject the 
manuscript (Dupuy does not date this event and its 
placement in the narrative may have misled Bell). 
This rejection will be discussed at the proper time, 
but we should note that by that time Galois would 
have already been arrested.
If we return to Bell’s account, we will now find 
a totally distorted chain of events. The months after 
July are missing; Galois still has not joined the So­
ciety of Friends of the People. He leaves school in 
December but has not joined the artillery. The events 
at the Louvre, which will turn out to have critical 
importance for the remainder of the story, never take 
place. Galois attempts to organize his private course 
in mathematics. Bell writes: “Here he was at nineteen, 
a creative mathematician of the first rank, peddling to 
no takers ... Finding no students, Galois temporarily 
abandoned mathematics and joined the Artillery of 
the National Guard ...” ([1], p. 372). According to 
Bell, Galois submits his paper to Poisson, it is re­
jected; and this being the “last straw”, Galois decides 
to devote “all his energy to revolutionary politics.”
The chronology presented by Bell is thus com­
pletely backwards. The impression given by this re­
arrangement of events is once again that of a mis­
understood and persecuted Galois who, surrounded 
on all sides by idiots, finally gives up and goes into 
radical politics. By writing that Galois found no stu­
dents, Bell of course strengthens this impression. A 
more balanced account clearly requires what is lack­
ing in Bell: a Galois of volition. We may get a better 
indication of his character and behavior during the 
spring of 1831 from a letter written on April 18 by 
the mathematician Sophie Germain to her colleague 
Libri [9]:
... Decidedly there is a misfortune concerning 
all that touches upon mathematics. Your preoc­
cupation, that of Cauchy, the death of M. Fourier, 
have been the final blow for this student Galois 
who, in spite of his impertinence, showed signs 
ofa clever disposition. All this has done so much 
that he has been expelled from l’Ecole Normale. 
He is without money and his mother has very lit­
tle also. Having returned home, he continued his 
habit of insult, a sample of which he gave you 
after your best lecture at the Academy. The poor 
woman fled her house, leaving just enough for 
her son to live on, and has been forced to place 
herself as a companion in order to make ends 
meet. They say he will go completely mad, I 
fear this is true.

278
Algebra and Number Theory
Unfortunately, as Bell observes, Galois was no inef­
fectual angel.
Before continuing, another historical detail should 
be mentioned. As an aftermath of the December 
events at the Louvre and the dissolution of the Ar­
tillery of the National Guard, nineteen officers were 
arrested, having been suspected of planning to de­
liver their cannons to the people. The charge was 
conspiracy to overthrow the government. In April, all 
nineteen were acquitted.
Until now, my criticism has been devoted almost 
entirely to Bell. Partly, this has been because his ac­
count is by far the most famous. There are other rea­
sons as well. Hoyle’s short essay, as already men­
tioned, is purely concerned with Galois’s death and 
thus has little to say concerning the foregoing events. 
Infeld’s account, on the other hand, is of book length. 
In a single article it would be difficult to debate all 
salient points. Nonetheless, Infeld has also stated 
(13], Afterword) that he is primarily concerned with 
the events surrounding the duel. It is then reasonable 
to devote attention here to that aspect of the book. In­
feld’s work is actually something of a curiosity. The 
bulk of it is a fictionalized biography, interspersed 
with real documents and eyewitness accounts. All 
dates, names, and places are respected. The second 
part of the biography consists of a lengthy Afterword 
in which Infeld details exactly what he has invented, 
what he has not, and what he believes to be true. He 
also includes a fairly comprehensive bibliography. In 
my criticisms of Infeld to follow, I only take issue 
with those points he claims not to have invented. The 
reader may get the flavor of the author’s intent by not­
ing that at Galois’s private class in algebra, spoken 
of earlier, Infeld has stationed two police spies ([13], 
p. 169).
It might also be noted that, according to James 
R. Newman’s brief remark quoted in the Introduction, 
Galois at this point in the narrative would be dead.

Arrest and prison
And thus we arrive on May 9, 1831. The occasion was 
the republican banquet at the restaurant Vendanges 
des Bourgogne, where approximately two hundred 
republicans were gathered to celebrate the acquittal 
of the nineteen republicans on conspiracy charges. 
As Dumas says in his memoirs, “It would be difficult 
to find in all Paris two hundred persons more hostile 
to the government than those to be found reunited 
at five o’clock in the afternoon in the long hall on 
the ground floor above the garden” ([6], p. 331). It is 
worth quoting Bell’s description ([1], p. 372) of this 
event:
The ninth of May, 1831, marked the beginning 
of the end. About two hundred young republi­
cans held a banquet to protest against the royal 
order disbanding the artillery which Galois had 
joined. Toasts were drunk to the Revolutions of 
1789 and 1793, to Robespierre, and to the Rev­
olution of 1830. The whole atmosphere of the 
gathering was revolutionary and defiant. Galois 
rose to propose a toast, his glass in one hand, 
his open pocket knife in the other. “To Louis- 
Phillipe”—the King. His companions misunder­
stood the purpose of the toast and whistled him 
down. Then they saw the open knife. Interpret­
ing this as a threat against the life of the King, 
they howled their approval. A friend of Galois, 
seeing the great Alexander Dumas and other no­
tables passing by the open windows, implored 
Galois to sit down, but the uproar continued. 
Galois was the hero of the moment, and the ar­
tillerists adjourned to the street to celebrate their 
exuberance by dancing all night. The following 
day Galois was arrested at his mother’s house 
and thrown into the prison at Sainte-Pelagie.
Dumas himself describes this event at length in his 
memoirs. To save space, we quote only a portion ([6], 
pp. 332-333):
Suddenly, in the midst of a private conversation 
which I was carrying on with the person on my 
left, the name Louis-Phillipe, followed by five 
or six whistles, caught my ear. I turned around, 
One of the most animated scenes was taking 
place fifteen or twenty seats from me.
A young man who had raised his glass and held 
an open dagger in the same hand was trying 
to make himself heard. He was Evariste Galois, 
since killed by Pescheux d’Herbinville, a charm­
ing young man who made silk-paper cartridges 
which he would tie up with silk ribbons.
[This is a literal translation of Dumas. We have 
not been able to discover exactly to what this 
occupation refers, but it is a plausible guess that 
d’Herbinville made what the British call crack­
ers, party favors that pop when the ribbons are 
pulled and contain inspirational messages. They 
seem to have been invented at about this time.] 
Evariste Galois was scarcely 23 or24 at the time. 
He was one of the most ardent republicans. The 

ROTHMAN: Genius and Biographers: The Fictionalization of Evariste Galois
279
noise was such that the very reason for this noise 
had become incomprehensible.
All I could perceive was that there was a threat 
and that the name of Louis-Phillipe had been 
mentioned; the intention was made clear by the 
open knife.
This went way beyond the limits of my republi­
can opinions. I yielded to the pressure from my 
neighbor on the left who, as one of the King’s 
comedians, didn’t care to be compromised, and 
we jumped from the window sill into the garden.
I went home somewhat worried. It was clear this 
episode would have its consequences. Indeed, 
two or three days later, Evariste Galois was ar­
rested.
The amusing discrepancies between the two ac­
counts are not entirely difficult to explain. Bell has 
taken his description from Dupuy, almost word for 
word, who in turn has based his account on Du­
mas and the report in the Gazette des Ecoles ([7], 
pp. 234-235). The toasts Bell mentions, as well as the 
description of the general atmosphere, are found in 
Dupuy. But Bell has mistranslated: Dupuy writes ([7], 
p. 235) that “. . . Dumas et quelques autres passaient 
par le fenetre dans le jardin pour ne pas se compro- 
mettre...” which, in this context, means “. . . Dumas 
and several others jumped through the window into 
the garden in order not to be compromised.” It does 
not here mean, “Dumas and several others passed by 
the window in order not to be compromised.” One 
of course wonders how Bell interpreted the clause 
“in order not to be compromised” in light of his own 
translation. Why should Dumas be passing by open 
windows in order not to be compromised? It is diffi­
cult to call this carelessness. Bell has also distorted 
the reason for the banquet. Dupuy clearly states ([7], 
p. 234) that it was a celebration for the acquittal of 
the nineteen conspirators. But Bell has not mentioned 
the trial. For consistency’s sake, he must therefore em­
phasize the obviously revolutionary character of the 
gathering.
The issue of accuracy becomes more important 
when we question the most glaring omission in Bell’s 
account: the absence of any mention of Pescheux 
d’Herbinville. The single sentence in Dumas is the 
only extant evidence that d’Herbinville was the man 
who eventually shot Galois. Although Dumas is re­
peatedly cited by Dupuy, Bell has obviously not read 
Dumas. Ifhe had, Bell might have seen fit to close the 
discrepancies in the banquet accounts, in order not to 
be compromised. On the other hand, Bell claims to 
have read Dupuy; Dupuy, once again citing Dumas, 
explicitly names d’Herbinville as Galois’s adversary 
([7], p. 247). Hoyle is guilty of the same charge; listing 
Dupuy as a main reference, he relegates d’Herbinville 
to the ranks of anonymous assassins. Infeld, who does 
identify d’Herbinville, attempts to prove he was a po­
lice agent.
For mathematics, of course, it is not important to 
know exactly who killed Galois; for historical accu­
racy, it is. In light of the plethora of theories which 
have arisen to explain the cause of the celebrated 
duel, most of which involve police spies, agents 
provocateurs, and political overtones, the identity of 
d’Herbinville might be a key piece of information. 
We will, in fact, find that the only evidence strongly 
indicates that d’Herbinville was not a police agent. 
D’herbinville and the conspiracy theories will be dis­
cussed in greater detail later, but for now let us return 
to Galois.
Evariste was arrested at his mother’s house the day 
following the banquet, which does indicate that po­
lice or informers were at the dinner, although the 
celebration was open to any subscriber. Galois was 
held in detention at Sainte-Pelagie prison until June 
15, when he was tried for threatening the King’s life. 
Bell’s description of this event is highly oversimpli­
fied. Indeed, the defense lawyer did claim Galois had 
actually said, “To Louis-Phillipe, if he betrays”, but 
that the noise had been such to drown out the qual­
ifying clause. Nonetheless, the matter took on a less 
facetious aspect when the prosecutor asked Galois if 
he really intended to kill the King. Galois replied, 
“Yes, if he betrays.” The prosecutor goes on to ask 
how Galois “can believe this abandonment of legality 
on the part of the King”, and Galois answers, “Ev­
erything makes us believe he will soon turn traitor if 
he has not done so already.” Galois is asked to clarify 
his remarks and basically repeats what he has already 
said: “I will say that the trend in government can make 
one suppose that Louis-Phillipe will betray one day 
ifhe hasn’t already.”
As Dumas aptly remarks, “One understands that 
with such lucidity in the questions and answers, the 
discussion did not last long.” Apparently moved by 
Galois’s youth, the jury acquitted him within mo­
ments. Dumas writes, “I repeat that this is a rude 
generation, perhaps a bit foolish, but you will recall 
Beranger’s song Les Fous [The Fools or The Madmen] 
([6], UG Edition, Volume 2, Chapter 37).
Shortly after this event, the Academy rejected Ga­
lois’s memoir on the resolution of equations, this 

280
Algebra and Number Theory
time with Poisson as referee. The rejection was writ­
ten on July 4, although according to Infeld ([13], 
p. 230) Galois did not receive the letter until Oc­
tober, when he was in prison again (I have found 
no other source which either corroborates or contra­
dicts Infeld’s claim that the rejected manuscript was 
not received until October, three months after the ac­
tual rejection.) By this time, about eight months had 
passed since he had submitted the paper at Poisson’s 
request. As we will see, Galois did not take the rejec­
tion lightly.
The cause for Galois’s second arrest was preven­
tative: On Bastille Day, July 14, 1831, he and his re­
publican friend Duchatelet were apprehended dressed 
in Artillery Guard uniforms and heavily armed. Be­
cause the Artillery Guard had been disbanded on the 
last day of 1830 in fear of its becoming an instru­
ment of the republicans, to wear the uniform was an 
outright gesture of defiance. It was also illegal. This 
was the charge brought against Galois, but not until 
the late date of October 23; he was sentenced to six 
months in prison. The sentence was confirmed by the 
court of appeals on December 3. In the meantime, 
Galois had been sitting in Sainte-Pelagie prison since 
his arrest in July.
In Bell’s fierce diatribe against this arrest he for­
gets to mention several relevant points. First, he does 
not seem to comprehend that this was not the Paris 
of our day but Paris one year after a revolution, when 
street riots were rampant, assassination attempts not 
uncommon, and republican activity dangerous (see, 
e.g., [10]). The “celebration” Bell mentions was a re­
publican demonstration on Bastille Day. Today such 
a demonstration would be considered patriotic; then 
it was seditious. This is exactly what the police chief 
decided when he went on record opposing the demon­
stration ([7], p. 238). Bell concedes, “True, Galois 
was armed to the teeth when arrested, but he had 
not resisted arrest” ([1], p. 378). More precisely, Ga­
lois was carrying a loaded rifle, several pistols, and 
his dagger, a punishable offense even in our more 
moderate times. To say that he had not resisted ar­
rest may also be inaccurate. The police came to Ga­
lois’s house to detain him, but Evariste had already 
decamped.
Galois’s predicament was not helped by his friend 
Duchatelet, who drew a picture on the wall of his cell 
of the King’s head lying next to a guillotine with the 
inscription “Phillipe will carry his head to your altar, 
O Liberty!” ([7], p. 238). Part of the delay in bringing 
Galois to trial was the fact that Duchatelet was tried 
first.
The point here is not to argue for or against the 
justice of Galois’s arrest. The point is that he was 
behaving dangerously in a dangerous time. Two forces 
are clearly at work here: the government’s intention 
to deal harshly with him after his threat of regicide 
and his own inability to keep out of trouble.
During his stay in prison, a number of events oc­
curred which throw further light on Galois’s person­
ality. These incidents were recorded by the republi­
can Francois Vincent Raspail. Raspail was an early 
botanist, one of the first to advocate the use of the mi­
croscope to examine cell structure in plants. He also 
had his troubles with the Academy and was sitting 
next to Dumas at the May 9 banquet. An ardent repub­
lican, he refused to receive the Cross of the Legion 
of Honor from Louis-Phillipe and during the years 
1830-1836 spent a total of twenty-seven months in 
prison [21]. Later in life, Raspail became a famous 
statesman. He is now remembered by a boulevard and 
a metro stop in Paris. He lived to be about eighty. One 
of his many arrests occurred at about the same time 
that Galois was taken. Raspail recorded the following 
incidents in several of his letters. Infeld quotes him 
several times at great length, but never explains who 
he was.
On July 25, 1831, Raspail wrote ([17], p. 84) that 
his fellow prisoners had taunted Galois into drinking 
some liquor, a pastime at which he was apparently a 
novice:
To refuse the challenge would be an act of cow­
ardice. And our poor Bacchus has so much 
courage in his frail body that he would give 
his life for the hundredth part of the smallest 
good deed. He grasps the little glass like Socrates 
courageously taking the hemlock; he swallows 
it at one gulp, not without blinking and mak­
ing a wry face. A second glass is not harder to 
empty than the first, and then the third. The be­
ginner loses his equilibrium. Triumph! Homage 
to the Bacchus of the jail! You have intoxicated 
an ingenuous soul, who holds wine in horror.
The scene repeats itself. This time Galois empties 
a bottle of brandy in a single draught. Galois, drunk, 
pours out his soul to Raspail in haunting prophecy 
([17], p. 89):
How I like you, at this moment more than ever. 
You do not get drunk, you are serious and a friend 
ofthe poor. But what is happening to my body? I 
have two men inside me, and unfortunately I can 
guess which is going to overcome the other. I 

ROTHMAN: Genius and Biographers: The Fictionalization of Evariste Galois
281
am too impatient to get to the goal. The passions 
of my age are all imbued with impatience. Even 
virtue has that vice with us. See here! I do not 
like liquor. At a word I drink it, holding my 
nose, and get drunk. I do not like women and it 
seems to me that I could only love a Tarpeia or 
a Graccha. And I tell you, I will die in a duel 
on the occasion of some coquette de bas etage.
Why? Because she will invite me to avenge her 
honor which another has compromised.
Do you know what I lack, my friend? I confide it 
only to you: it is someone whom I can love and 
love only in spirit. I have lost my father and no 
one has ever replaced him, do you hear me . . .
The aftermath of this episode is neither heartwarm­
ing nor pleasant; Galois ina delirium attempts suicide 
([17], p. 90):
We laid him out on one of our beds. But the 
fever of intoxication tormented our unhappy 
friend ..... He would fall back senseless only to
raise himself with new exaltation, and he fore­
told sublime things which a certain reserve often 
rendered ridiculous.
“You despise me, you who are my friend! You 
are right, but I who committed such a crime must 
kill myself!”
And he would have done it if we had not flung 
ourselves on him, for he had a weapon in his 
hands . . .
Several important points need to be made about 
these passages. Bell, in his account, says only, 
“Goaded beyond endurance, Galois seized a bottle 
of brandy, not knowing or caring what it was, and 
drank it down. A decent fellow prisoner took care 
of him until he recovered” ([1], p. 374). Thus, the 
really important parts of the episode, which tell us 
something about Galois’s character and which bear 
on future events, are omitted altogether.
Later, in attempting to understand the cause of Ga­
lois’s death, Dupuy remarks ([7], p. 245), “IfI credit 
an allusion of Raspail, Galois lost his virgin heart 
to quelque coquette de bas etage.” Bell writes ([1], 
p. 374): “Some worthless girl [quelque coquette de 
bas etage] initiated him.” Here, Bell is taking a con­
jecture of Dupuy based on a letter of Raspail reporting 
an utterance of Galois spoken in a delirium a year be­
fore the duel as a characterization of real events. This 
can only be termed fabrication. And it is very likely 
that this piece of fabrication is responsible for the 
widespread belief that a prostitute was the cause of 
Galois’s death.
Infeld, in his version of the prison scene, quotes 
the letters far more fully than Dupuy, but jumps 
from “Tarpeia and Graccha” to “Do you know what 
I lack, my friend?” In other words, he omits Gaiois’s 
prophecy that he will die in a duel. He also makes 
no comment whatsoever on Galois’s suicide attempt. 
This selective presentation and slanting of evidence is 
characteristic of Infeld’s book. He publishes any doc­
ument or any portion of a document which does not 
interfere with his stated hypothesis that Galois was 
killed by the secret police. More obvious examples 
will be presented later when we discuss the actual 
circumstances surrounding the duel.
On August 2, Raspail chronicles an interesting se­
ries of events which took place after his previous 
letters. On July 27, the prisoners were invited to at­
tend a mass in memory of those killed during the July 
revolution a year earlier. Because many of the pris­
oners were political, the atmosphere was tense and 
an open riot was expected to erupt at any moment. A 
few prudent prison leaders defused the situation, and 
two days passed without violence. At lock-up time 
on the 29th, a shot was heard throughout the prison, 
followed by cries of “Help, murder!” The following 
day, the mystery was clarified. Raspail, quoting the 
conversation of another prisoner with the prison su­
perintendent, writes ([17], pp. 117-118):
“Here are the facts. I am one of those in the attic 
room of the bathing pavilion. We were quietly 
going to bed. The man whose bed is between 
two casements had his face toward the window 
while undressing and he was humming a tune.” 
“At that moment a shot was fired from the garret 
opposite. We thought our comrade was dead, but 
he was only unconscious. Not knowing where 
the shot had come from, nor how serious the 
wound was, we called for help. For in such a 
room, open in all directions through six win­
dows, a better-aimed shot would have struck 
down its man.”
The shot, it turned out, came from a garret, across 
the street, where one of the prison guards lived. Galois 
was not the man who was at the window and wounded. 
However, he was in the same room and was later 
thrown into the dungeon, evidently because he had 
insulted the superintendent, probably accusing him 
of having intentionally arranged the shooting. Raspail 
continues ([17], p. 118; also [7], p. 243) to record the 
conversation. The prisoner already quoted is talking: 

282
Algebra and Number Theory
“What? You have no order to seize the guilty 
man [the guard who fired the shot]? But you have 
one to throw into the dungeon both the victim of 
this shameful trap and the witnesses of it? It may 
sound insolent to say that the administration pays 
turnkeys to murder prisoners. But what if this 
insolent statement is true? And I bear witness 
that no other insolence has come from those 
who were thrown into the dungeon. This young 
Galois doesn’t raise his voice, as you well know; 
he remains as cold as his mathematics when he 
talks to you.”
“Galois in the dungeon!” repeats the crowd. “Oh, 
the bastards! They have a grudge against our 
little scholar.”
“Of course they have a grudge against him. They 
trick him like vipers. They entice him into every 
imaginable trap. And then, too, they want an 
uprising.”
An uprising they got. This oblique conversation 
ends with the superintendent taking to his heels as 
the prisoners take control of the prison. The situation 
remains stalemated until late that night when the in­
fantry is called in. The prisoners surrender without 
violence and remarkably no one is hurt.
I have tried to present this episode in as neutral a 
tone as possible. Infeld interprets the shot as an as­
sassination attempt on Galois’s life, and later cites it 
in his Afterword as his first piece of evidence that Ga­
lois was murdered by the government ([13], p. 308). 
It is agreed that the moderate government of Louis- 
Phillipe would have liked to have been rid of all po­
litical extremists. But a conspiracy theory presumes 
that there exists a reason to single out a particular 
victim. Why Galois over Raspail? A shot was fired in 
a prison full of political prisoners on the verge of a 
riot, at night (“lock-up time”), into a room contain­
ing an unknown number of men, evidently “aimed” 
at someone else. Yes, it could have been an attempt 
to kill Galois. I do not find the evidence compelling.
More compelling is the evidence for the abso­
lute hatred Galois had developed for the Academy, 
which I feel can only be termed paranoid. And, as 
is not uncommon with paranoiacs, there was a ker­
nel of justification for the behavior. At some point in 
October, according to Infeld, Galois was notified of 
Poisson’s rejection of his latest manuscript on the 
theory of equations. Infeld quotes the following letter 
(from [2]; see also [13], p. 230), which was originally 
published by Bertrand. It is not quoted by Dupuy.
Dear M. Galois:
Your paper was sent to M. Poisson to referee. 
He has returned it with his report, which we 
quote:
“We have made every effort to understand M. 
Galois’s proofs. His argument is neither suffi­
ciently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow 
us to judge its rigor; it is not even possible for 
us to give an idea of this paper.
The author claims that the propositions con­
tained in his manuscript are a part of a general 
theory which has rich application. Often differ­
ent parts of a theory clarify each other and can 
be more easily understood when taken together 
than when taken in isolation. One should rather 
wait to form a more definite opinion, therefore, 
until the author publishes a more complete ac­
count of his work.”
For this reason, we are returning your manu­
script in the hope that you will find M. Poisson’s 
remarks useful in your future work.
Francois Arago, Secretary to the Academy
Bell, elaborating from Dupuy, states ([1], p. 371) 
that Poisson found the manuscript “incomprehensi­
ble” but “did not state how long it had taken him to 
reach this remarkable conclusion.” I believe that this 
is an unfair characterization of Poisson’s comments. 
This is the rejection that Bell has occurring before 
Galois’s arrest.
In light of previous events and in light of his char­
acter, it is not terribly surprising that Galois reacted 
violently to what might nowadays be considered an 
encouraging rejection letter. He gave up all plans to 
publish his papers through the Academy and decided 
to publish them privately with the help of his friend 
Auguste Chevalier. Galois collected his manuscripts 
and in December, while still in Sainte-Pelagie, penned 
what surely must be one of the most remarkable docu­
ments in the history of mathematics, his Preface. The 
entire Preface runs to about five pages. Infeld, to his 
credit, prints some of it, although he alters and omits 
certain parts at will. To save space, I here quote only 
the first page. The full text can be found in Bourgne 
and Azra ([4], pp. 3-11):
Firstly, you will notice the second page of this 
work is not encumbered by surnames, Chris­
tian names or titles. Absent are eulogies to some 
prince whose purse would have opened at the 
smoke of incense, threatening to close once 
the incense holder was empty. Neither will you 
see, in characters three times as high as those in

the text, homage respectfully paid to some high- 
ranking official in science, or to some savant­
protector, a thing thought to be indispensable (I 
should say inevitable) for someone wishing to 
write at twenty. I tell no one that I owe anything 
of value in my work to his advice or encourage­
ment. I do not say so because it would be a lie. 
If I addressed anything to the important men of 
science or of the world (and I grant the distinc­
tion between the two at times is imperceptible) 
I swear it would not be thanks. I owe to impor­
tant men the fact that the first of these papers 
is appearing so late. I owe to other important 
men that the whole thing was written in prison, 
a place, you will agree, hardly suited for medi­
tation, and where I have been dumbfounded at 
my own listlessness in keeping my mouth shut at 
my stupid, spiteful critics: and I think that I can 
say “spiteful critics” in all modesty because my 
adversaries are so low in my esteem. The whys 
and wherefores of my stay in prison have noth­
ing to do with the subject at hand; but I must tell 
you how manuscripts go astray in the portfolios 
of the members of the Institute, although I can­
not in truth conceive of such carelessness on the 
part of those who already have the death of Abel 
on their consciences. I do not want to compare 
myself with that illustrious mathematician but, 
suffice to say, I sent my memoir on the theory of 
equations to the Academy in February of 1830 
(in a less complete form in 1829) and it has been 
impossible to find them or get them back. There 
are other anecdotes in this genre but I would be 
ungracious to recount them because, other than 
the loss of my manuscripts, those incidents do 
not concern me. Happy voyager, only my poor 
countenance saved me from the jaws of wolves. 
Perhaps I have already said too much for the 
reader to understand why, as much as I would 
have liked otherwise, it is absolutely impossible 
for me to embellish or disfigure this work with 
a dedication.
The remainder of the Preface continues in much 
the same tone (“And thus it is knowingly that I ex­
pose myself to the laughter of fools”). Others of his 
writings are not dissimilar ([4], pp. 21-27). Among 
his papers is the picture of a bizarre, torsoless fig­
ure, captioned by Bourgne and Azra [4] “Riquet a la 
Houppe.” The picture must have been drawn shortly 
before his death. It may be significant that Riquet 
a la Houppe was in French folklore a character, 
short, ugly, disdained by all, but nonetheless very 
clever.
6 The duel and theories 
surrounding it
We are almost at the end of this short story. Galois re­
mained in Sainte-Pelagie without further recorded in­
cident until March 16, 1832, when he was transferred 
to the pension Sieur Faultrier. Ironically enough, this 
was to prevent the prisoners from being exposed to 
the cholera epidemic then sweeping Paris. Galois was 
due to be given his freedom on April 29. From this 
point on, the historical record is very scanty. On May 
25, Galois writes ([4], pp. 468-469) to his friend 
Chevalier and clearly alludes to a broken love affair:
My dear friend, there is a pleasure in being sad 
if one can hope for consolation; one is happy 
to suffer if one has friends. Your letter, full of 
apostolitic unction, has given me a little calm. 
But how can I remove the trace of such violent 
emotions that I have felt?
How can I console myself when in one month 
I have exhausted the greatest source of happiness 
a man can have, when I have exhausted it without 
happiness, without hope, when I am certain it is 
drained for life?
The letter continues in similar tones. Galois goes on 
([4], p. 470) to say that he is disgusted with the world: 
“I am disenchanted with everything, even the love of 
glory. How can a world I detest soil me?”
The next few days are a complete blank. On the 
morning of May 30, the famous duel took place. The 
previous evening, Galois wrote ([4], p. 471) several 
well-known letters to his republican friends:
I beg patriots, my friends, not to reproach me for 
dying otherwise than for my country.
I die the victim of an infamous coquette and 
her two dupes. It is in a miserable piece of slander 
that I end my life.
Oh! Why die for something so little, so con­
temptible?
I call on heaven to witness that only under 
compulsion and force have I yielded to a provo­
cation which I have tried to avert by every means. 
I repent in having told the hateful truth to those 
who could not listen to it with dispassion. But to 
the end I told the truth. I go to the grave with a 
conscience free from patriots’ blood.

284
Algebra and Number Theory
I would like to have given my life for the 
public good.
Forgive those who kill me for they are of good 
faith.
Galois also writes ([4], p. 471) another, similar letter 
to two republican friends, Napoleon Lebon and V. 
Delauney:
My good friends,
I have been provoked by two patriots . .. It is 
impossible for me to refuse.
I beg your forgiveness for not having told you.
But my adversaries have put me on my word
of honor not to inform any patriot.
Your task is simple: prove that I am fighting 
against my will, having exhausted all possible 
means of reconciliation; say whether I am capa­
ble of lying even in the most trivial matters.
Please remember me since fate did not give 
me enough of a life to be remembered by my 
country.
I die your friend.
We will return to Galois’s activities during this last 
night in due time. For now we discuss a few of the 
many theories which purport to explain the cause 
of this celebrated duel. There is perhaps enough in 
the two letters to raise suspicions of foul play. The 
attempts to make Galois the victim of royalists, a 
female agent provocateur, a prostitute, or a govern­
ment conspiracy doubtlessly stem from these letters, 
for there is no other direct evidence in existence. 
Thus, we have the origin of Bell’s assertion ([1], 
p. 375):
What happened on May 29th is not definitely 
known. Extracts from two letters suggest what 
is usually accepted as the truth: Galois had run 
afoul of political enemies immediately after his 
release.
The first statement is accurate, the second is not. 
Dupuy certainly believes the exact opposite, as will 
be seen shortly. Dupuy does mention that Alfred Ga­
lois, unjustifiably in his view, did maintain that his 
older brother was murdered. Because Bell “followed” 
Dupuy exclusively, one can only conclude that he took 
Alfred’s position and termed it widely accepted or that 
he invented the whole thing.
Although Bell may have invented the theory, or 
merely propagated it to previously unattained heights, 
he is not its chief advocate. Infeld goes further. He 
assumes the “infamous coquette” was a female agent 
provocateur who set up Galois for the duel with a 
police agent. Infeld’s evidence is by admission cir­
cumstantial. In addition to the bullet episode at 
Sainte-Pelagie it consists of the following ([13], pp. 
308-311): the police were known to have used spies; 
the police broke up a meeting of the Society of Friends 
of the People the night before Galois’s funeral; Police 
Chief M. Gisquet wrote in 1840 that Galois “had 
been killed by a friend”; police spies were unmasked 
in 1848, at which time a claim appeared in a journal 
that Galois “had been murdered in a so-called duel 
of honor”; Galois’s brother Alfred always maintained 
that Evariste had been murdered; Galois was aban­
doned by his adversaries and his seconds and found 
by a peasant.
It should be noted that this evidence is consistent 
and does not contradict known facts. However, ne­
cessity does not follow from consistency. The bullet 
episode has already been discussed. It is true that 
the police used spies and that they were unmasked in 
1848. We will return to this point below. Infeld does 
not mention that the newspapers announced Galois’s 
funeral before the fact and explicitly named him as a 
member of both the Artillery of the National Guard 
and the Friends of the People. In any event, his mem­
bership in these organizations must have been widely 
known. One must weigh for oneself whether it is re­
markable that police knew of republican meetings. 
Infeld finds it suspicious that the police chief, eight 
years after the fact, knew Galois had been “killed by 
a friend”. He does not find it suspicious that Dumas 
knew more—precisely who that friend was. Dupuy 
feels that Alfred’s position was the result of justi­
fiable anger over his brother’s death and points out 
some unlikely details Alfred attributed to the duel, 
such as stating that Evariste would have fired into the 
air. The assertion that Galois was abandoned to die, 
another of Alfred’s claims, is also open to dispute. 
Dupuy mentions ([7], pp. 247-248) that one of the 
witnesses went to Galois’s mother the following day 
to explain what had happened. He feels, then, it was 
more likely that the witnesses were searching for a 
doctor when the peasant happened along. This ex­
planation may be weak; nonetheless Infeld fails to 
mention that Mme. Galois was informed.
The remarks above are admittedly as circumstan­
tial as the evidence. There is, however, more concrete 
evidence which weighs very heavily against the po­
litical conspiracy theorists: the identity of Pescheux 
d’Herbinville. More is known about him than his 
anonymity. He was, in fact, one of the nineteen repub­
licans who were acquitted on charges of conspiring to 

ROTHMAN: Genius and Biographers: The Fictionalization of Evariste Galois
285
overthrow the government in the trial spoken of ear­
lier. Is there any reason to suspect that d’Herbinville 
was a police agent? The historian Louis Blanc, in his 
exhaustive History of Ten Years, writes ([3], p. 431):
The trial gave rise to highly interesting scenes. 
In the sittings of the 7th of April, the president 
having reproached M. Pescheux d’Herbinville, 
one of the accused, with having had arms by him 
and with having distributed them, “Yes,” replied 
the prisoner, “I have had arms, a great many 
arms, and I will tell you how I came by them.” 
Then, relating the part he had taken in the three 
days, he told how, followed by his comrades, 
he had disarmed posts, and sustained glorious 
conflicts; and how, though not wealthy, he had 
equipped national guards at his own cost. There 
still burned in the hearts of the people some of 
the fire kindled by the revolution of July; such 
recitals as this fanned the embers. The young 
man himself, as he concluded his brief defense, 
wore a face radiant with enthusiasm and his eyes 
filled with tears.
In addition, Blanc mentions ([3], p. 431) the ap­
pearance of General Lafayette during the trial:
The old general came to give his testimony in fa­
vor of the accused, almost all of whom he knew, 
and all saluted him from their places with looks 
and gestures of regard.
D’Herbinville, it seems, was one of the heroes of the 
hour. After the acquittal, the crowd pulled his coach 
through the streets of Paris “amid shouts of rapturous 
applause”.
Bell, by not mentioning d’Herbinville at all, re­
lieves himself of the difficulty of explaining why Ga­
lois should be killed in a political duel with a fellow 
republican or why d’Herbinville should be consid­
ered a political enemy. Infeld is in a more difficult 
position. Having acknowledged d’Herbinville’s exis­
tence, he must explain why neither Dumas nor Blanc, 
both republicans, nor evidently the extremely liberal 
Lafayette (assuming he knew d’Herbinville person­
ally), nor, one would gather from Blanc’s account, 
any republican in Paris, ever held any suspicions that 
d’Herbinville was an agent. Infeld talks at length 
about the 1848 unmasking of the police spies, but he 
does not mention the following extract from Dupuy 
([7], p. 247):
Pescheux was certainly not a “false-brother”: all 
the men who acted as police agents during the 
reign of Louis-Phillipe were revealed in 1848 
when Caussidiere became chief of police, as wit­
ness Lucien de la Hodde [Hodde was a “repub­
lican” who was unmasked as a spy in 1848]. If 
Pescheux were suspect, he would certainly not 
have been nominated as curator of the palace of 
Fontainebleu. It is absolutely necessary to dis­
card the idea of police intervention and of a 
framed assassination.
Thus there are some serious difficulties with the 
political enemies scenario. Infeld gets around this 
problem in characteristic fashion: in his bibliography 
he cites both Blanc and Dupuy as primary sources but 
quotes neither. In his Afterword, Infeld goes so far as 
to admit, “There is no reason to believe Pescheux 
d’Herbinville was a police agent.” But then he goes 
on to say ([13], p. 310):
I believe there is enough circumstantial evidence 
to prove that the intervention of the secret police 
sealed Galois’s fate. I do not believe it is possi­
ble to fit all the known facts without assuming 
Galois was murdered.
It is left as an exercise for the reader to form a 
rebuttal to this statement. But in order to see just how 
far “known facts” can be stretched, we turn to Hoyle’s 
version of the event. He writes ([11], p. 14):
Such are the bare bones of the story of the life 
and death of Evariste Galois. The classical biog­
raphy of Galois [he then references Dupuy], in 
an attempt to add flesh to these bones, suggests 
that he was done to death by royalist enemies, 
as does E. T. Bell in his book Men of Math­
ematics. There are dark hints that the release 
from prison was but a device for encompassing 
his death, a necessary preliminary to his being 
matched against a highly skilled assailant in roy­
alist pay. But why should Galois feel it critical to 
his honor that he should accept the challenge of 
a right-wing agent, especially if the agent were 
a known marksman? Gallic logic suggests on 
account ofa girl ...
We first note the complete misrepresentation of 
Dupuy’s position. If Hoyle is challenging Bell, and ad­
mittedly this is unclear, it seems to be on the extremely 
naive assumption that Galois would have known his 
opponent was a right-wing agent. Hoyle then goes on 
to dispose of the “infamous coquette” and propose 
his own theory ([11], p. 15):

286
Algebra and Number Theory
It is possible that the “infamous coquette” was 
the source of a purely personal quarrel, but it 
is the normal biological rule among mammals 
that sexual quarrels between two males cease 
as soon as one side seeks “accommodation”. It 
is the normal rule that either party to such fights 
can simply walk away, which is just what Galois 
seems to have attempted to do.
The more likely possibility is that Galois’s 
habit of working mathematical problems in his 
head, his ability to think in parallel, caused seri­
ous animosities, and perhaps suspicions, to de­
velop during the six months of imprisonment. 
There may have been suspicions that Galois was 
not wholly for the “cause”, or even that he was 
an agent provocateur ...
Lincoln’s remark comes to mind: “You can fool 
some of the people some of the time ...” To sug­
gest as Hoyle does that any republican in Paris sus­
pected Galois after his expulsion from l’Ecole Nor­
male, his Artillery activities, his threat to the King, 
his arrests, trials, sentencings, resentencings, and 
prison activities borders on the fantastical. This is 
in addition to the fact that two or three thousand 
republicans later attended the funeral of this sup­
posed agent provocateur. One might equally well 
claim that Lenin had been suspected of being a 
Menshevik.
As to Hoyle’s bio-sociological theories, he is con­
tradicted by the historical record. The greatest Rus­
sian poet, Alexander Pushkin, was killed in 1837 at 
the age of 37 in a duel over his wife. England’s Lord 
Camelford was killed in a duel over a prostitute. As 
late as 1838 members of the American legislature 
were engaging in similar duels. Toward the end of 
the eighteenth century, during election season, ap­
proximately 23 duels per day were fought in Ireland 
alone, unlikely just for political reasons. In the last 
decades of the nineteenth century, Paris newspapers 
carried notices of the daily duels and their terms. 
These practices continued until World War I. The 
cause of such “affairs of honor” ranged from geese, 
to insults, to politics, to women (see, e.g., [15], “Du­
els and Ideals”, and [18], Chapter 1). Dupuy him­
self mentions that nothing was more common at the 
time in question than duels between republicans, and 
I think that one may safely infer from his remarks 
that no one paid the slightest attention to them ([7], 
p. 247).
However, argument by analogy is generally a weak 
policy when dealing with a specific case, and Hoyle’s 
expansive pronouncements on the sexual behavior of 
mammals bring to mind further evidence with which 
anyone wishing to invoke a political cause for Galois’s 
death must contend. This evidence consists primarily 
of two fragmentary letters written to Galois by one 
Mademoiselle Stephanie D, who is none other than 
the “infamous coquette” over whom the duel was 
fought. Most authors have assumed her identity to be 
an absolute mystery and that she, like d’Herbinville, is 
an anonymous casualty of history. Dupuy apparently 
was unaware of the letters or chose not to publish 
them. Bell and Hoyle never mention her name. Infeld 
calls her Eve Sorel (perhaps inspired by Stendhal). 
This is a strange state of affairs, for the letters were 
published in Tannery’s 1908 edition of Galois’s pa­
pers. Tannery does not affix a name to the author 
of these fragments; it is left for the 1962 edition of 
Bourgne and Azra to attempt an identification. One 
can understand why Bell and Infeld did not mention 
her name since Tannery did not provide it. Hoyle does 
not have such an excuse, his book being published 
in 1977. One cannot understand why these letters 
are never mentioned by anyone, especially by Bell 
and Infeld who cite Tannery as a major source for 
Galois’s manuscripts.
The letters, as they exist, are copies made by Ga­
lois himself on the back of one of his papers ([4], 
pp. 489-491). The copies contain gaps, which may 
indicate he had previously torn up the originals and 
could not completely reconstruct them. More likely, 
Galois purposely omitted any incriminating or per­
sonally distasteful segments. I say this because some 
words in the French versions are broken in half; one 
generally does not remember only half a word. Ga­
lois has certainly obliterated Stephanie’s last name 
in a fit of anger. Due to the fragmentary nature 
of these letters their translation has proved difficult 
and may be uncertain in places. Where impossible 
to translate we have allowed the original French to 
stand.
Letter I:
Please let us break up this affair. I do not have 
the wit to follow a correspondence of this na­
ture but I will try to have enough to converse 
with you as I did before anything happened. Here

not exist and which never would have existed.

nomination it may have happened between us. In 
any case, Sir, be assured there never would have 
been more. You’re assuming wrongly and your 
regrets have no foundation. True friendship ex­
ists nearly only between people of the same sex

trust ...but it has been very wounded ...you

a word for these one is not The calm of my

usually see without much reflection: this is the 
reason that I rarely regret having been wrong 
in my judgment of a person. I am not of your 
opinion les sen plus que les a exiger ni se 
thank you sincerely for all those who you would 
bring down in my favor.
These are highly tantalizing morsels, but is there 
anything else known about the author? Indeed there is. 
C. A. Infantozzi has examined the original of the first 
letter [12]. With the help of a magnifying glass he was 
able to discern Stephanie’s full signature under Ga­
lois’s erasures: Stephanie Dumotel. Further archival 
investigation by Infantozzi shows she was Stephanie- 
Felicie Poterin du Motel, daughter of Jean-Louis Au­
guste Poterin du Motel, a resident physician at the 
Sieur Faultrier, where Galois stayed the last months 
ofhis life. In 1840 Stephanie married Oscar-Theodore 
Barrieu, a language professor. Any presumption that 
she was a prostitute must at this point be discarded as 
a complete figment of Bell’s imagination.
The establishment of Stephanie’s identity unfortu­
nately does not conclusively establish what in actu­
ality did occur. From Stephanie’s second letter it is 
not difficult to infer that Galois took some song of 
sorrows on her part too seriously and himself pro­
voked the duel. On face value she certainly seems an 
unwilling participant in whatever transpired. On the 
other hand, we have a curious passage from Dupuy, 
once again not quoted by the other authors. Dur­
ing the course of his researches, Dupuy had asked 
Galois’s cousin ifhe knew the cause of the duel ([7], 
p. 246).
His cousin, M. Gabriel Demante, writes me that 
at a last meeting [with Stephanie?] Galois found 
himself in the presence ofa supposed uncle and 
a supposed fiance, each of whom provoked the 
duel.
It is difficult to say in which direction this passage 
points, but in weighing its importance, one should 
keep in mind Dupuy’s own skepticism of anything 
the Galois family said concerning the duel.
With this passage, all the evidence pertaining to 
the duel which I have found to date has been pre­
sented. One can read the circumstantial evidence as 
Infeld does to arrive at a conspiracy. No known facts 
conclusively refute this interpretation. But it must be 
re-emphasized that there is absolutely no direct ev­
idence that such is the case. Furthermore, there is 
the testimony of several men, two of whom were re­
publicans, that d’Herbinville was not a police agent. 
In addition, there is the identity of Stephanie, who 
was simply the daughter of a physician who hap­
pened to live and work at the pension where Galois 
was staying. To suggest she was an agent provocateur 
somehow planted there to entrap Galois becomes a 
baroque, if not byzantine, invention.
If one chooses to reject the conspiracy theory, 
a fairly consistent picture of a personal quarrel 
emerges. We have Galois’s unhappy letter to Cheva­
lier of May 25. His famous cry, “I am the victim ofan 
infamous coquette and her two dupes”, may mean 
exactly what it says, with suitable allowances for 
Galois’s usual withering tone. The excerpt from 
Dupuy quoted above is certainly consistent with “two 
dupes”. Galois himself writes, “Forgive those who kill 
me for they are of good faith”, i.e., they are not politi­
cal enemies. And we must remember, in his own eyes, 
Galois was exceedingly honest. Ifhe felt any treach­
ery were involved, we can be sure he would have said 
as much. The two letters from Stephanie are perhaps 
the strongest argument for a personal quarrel. Those 
dissenting could of course take the extreme position 
that she was a very good actress.
In addition, there is the more difficult question of 
psychology. Galois’s writings are at times unques­
tionably violent, and equally violent erasures are pre­
served on his manuscripts. He was arrested twice 
for dangerous actions which might have easily been 
avoided by a more prudent individual, or perhaps in 
a more prudent age. Raspail writes that Galois at­
tempted suicide in prison, and of course there is Ga­
lois’s own prophecy, not inconceivably self-fulfilling, 
that he would be killed in an affair of honor. It is not 

288
Algebra and Number Theory
terribly difficult to believe that such a troubled young 
man in such a turbulent time could have ended his 
life in a duel.
In this scenario, the role of Pescheux d’Herbinville 
admittedly remains unclear. Was he a “supposed” fi­
ance or a real fiance whom Galois’s cousin took for 
supposed? Did Galois’s cousin invent this epithet, or 
was d’Herbinville simply involved in a stupid quar­
rel? I have no answers to these questions. The point 
I wish to make now for the interested historian is 
that, although in 1982 Galois will have been dead for 
150 years, the investigation of his death has been 
closed prematurely. D’Herbinville should be traced 
to see if any letters exist which might shed some light 
on the matter; a perusal of the standard biographical 
encyclopedias has failed to reveal any further infor­
mation on d’Herbinville. If he was in prison with 
Galois, a background for the quarrel might be es­
tablished. Letters of Stephanie or her husband might 
be extant and could conceivably mention the duel. 
Dupuy remarks cryptically that Raspail as well as all 
the republicans knew the cause of the duel. Raspail 
became a famous politician. Perhaps there is a clue in 
his correspondence.
These avenues are still open for those who are in­
terested. They have been neglected only because of 
the intentional or unintentional omission of informa­
tion by those who have previously written on Galois. 
We will return to the question of scholarship after dis­
posing of the remaining myths concerning the night 
before the duel.
7 
The last night
We saw in the introduction how Bell all but states 
outright that Galois committed his theory of equa­
tions to paper the night before he was shot. James R. 
Newman repeats this as an assertion, and the vision 
of the doomed boy, sitting by candlelight, feverishly 
bringing group theory into the world seems to be the 
major myth which most scientists harbor concerning 
Galois. This is again due to Bell’s embellishment of 
Dupuy, who in this instance is sufficiently romantic 
of his own accord. But as has already been detailed 
at great length, Galois had been submitting papers 
on the subject since the age of 17. The term group, 
used in the sense of group of permutations, is used 
in all of them. During the night before the duel, in 
addition to the letters already quoted, Galois wrote 
([4], p. 173) a long letter to his friend Chevalier. He 
begins:
My Dear Friend,
I have made some new discoveries in analysis.
The first concern the theory of equations, the 
others integral functions.
In the theory of equations I have researched 
the conditions for the solvability of equations 
by radicals; this has given me the occasion to 
deepen this theory and describe all the transfor­
mations possible on an equation even though it 
is not solvable by radicals.
All this will be found here in three memoirs.
Galois then goes on to describe and elucidate the 
contents of the memoir which was rejected by Pois­
son, as well as subsequent work. Galois had indeed 
created a field which would keep mathematicians 
busy for hundreds of years, but not “in those last 
desperate hours before the dawn”. During the course 
of the night he annotated and made corrections on 
some of his papers. He comes across a note that Pois­
son ([4], p. 48) had left in the margin of his rejected 
memoir:
The proof of this lemma is not sufficient. But it 
is true according to Lagrange’s paper, No. 100, 
Berlin 1775.
Galois writes directly beneath it:
This proof is a textual transcription of that which 
we gave for this lemma in a memoir presented 
in 1830. We leave as an historic document the 
above note which M. Poisson felt obliged to in­
sert. (Author’s note.)
A few pages later ([4], p. 54), Galois scrawls next 
to a theorem:
There are a few things left to be completed in 
this proof. I have not the time. (Author’s note.)
Galois penned this famous inscription only once 
during the course of the night. It is unfortunate he 
tarnished some of the romance by including his par­
enthetical “Author’s note”. Galois ends ([4], p. 185) 
his letter to Chevalier with the following request:
In my life I have often dared to advance propo­
sitions about which I was not sure. But all I have 
written down here has been clear in my head 
for over a year, and it would not be in my inter­
est to leave myself open to the suspicion that I 
announce theorems of which I do not have com­
plete proof.

ROTHMAN: Genius and Biographers: The Fictionalization of Evariste Galois
289
Make a public request of Jacobi or Gauss to 
give their opinions not as to the truth but as to 
the importance of these theorems.
After that, I hope some men will find it prof­
itable to sort out this mess.
I embrace you with effusion. E. Galois
And that was the end. The funeral was to be held 
on June 2. During the previous evening, the police 
broke up a meeting of the Society of Friends of the 
People on the pretext that the republicans were plan­
ning a demonstration for Galois’s funeral. Thirty of 
those present were arrested. The next day, two or three 
thousand republicans were present at the services. Ga­
lois’s body was interred in a common burial ground 
of which no trace remains today.
Later, Evariste’s brother Alfred and his devoted 
friend Chevalier would laboriously re-copy the math­
ematical papers and submit them to Gauss, Jacobi, 
and others. By 1843 the manuscripts had found their 
way to Liouville, who, after spending several months 
in the attempt to understand them, became convinced 
of their importance. He published the papers in 1846.
There exist many fragments which indicate that 
Galois carried on his mathematical researches, not 
only while in prison, but right up until the time of 
his death. The fact that he could work through such a 
turbulent life is testimony to the extraordinary fertility 
of his imagination. There is no question that Galois 
was a great mathematician who developed one of the 
most original ideas in the history of mathematics. The 
invention of legends does not make him any greater.
8 
Harsher words
The account of Galois’s life given here has not been 
entirely complete. There are more documents, letters, 
and events. No doubt I will shortly be exposed for 
having selectively presented evidence. The purpose 
of this paper, however, has not been one of complete­
ness, nor entirely one of biography. No, the purpose 
has been to show that something is wrong. Two highly 
respected physicists and an equally well-known math­
ematician have invented history.
Bell’s account, by far the most famous, is also the 
most fictitious. It is a myth devoid of such complica­
tions as a protagonist who is faulted as well as gifted. 
It is myth based on the stereotype of the misunder­
stood genius whom the conservative hierarchy is out 
to conquer—as if the befuddled hierarchy is gener­
ally organized well enough for persecution. It is a 
myth based on a misunderstanding of the method by 
which a scientist works—as if a great theory could be 
written down coherently in a single night.
It is unclear how far one can go in forgiving Bell. 
Surely all his mistakes could not result from a poor 
knowledge of French. No, I believe consciously or 
unconsciously Bell saw his opportunity to create a 
legend. The details which are absent in his account, 
such as Dumas at the banquet, such as d’Herbinville, 
such as the suicide attempt and Raspail, are those de­
tails which lend a concreteness and a humanness to 
Galois’s life which a legend must not have. Unfortu­
nately, if this was Bell’s intent, he succeeded. After 
hearing of my investigation, physicists and mathe­
maticians all open conversations with me with the 
same question: “Did Galois really invent group the­
ory the night before he was killed?” No, he didn’t.
Infeld presents far more details. He is not interested 
in making Galois a legend. He does intend to make 
Galois a hero of the people. Politics is the guiding 
principle for Infeld. His book might be termed the 
proletarian interpretation of Galois; certainly, parts 
of it read like the local Workers’ Party publication. 
Infeld is very good at covering his tracks. To delete a 
phrase here, a paragraph there, a counter-argument in 
between, is all that is necessary to create conspiracy 
from chaos.
As to Hoyle’s motives, we can only take him at 
his word: He describes at length how as a child he 
was taught arithmetic by his mother, how he became 
proficient at mathematics, and how school for him be­
came an excruciating bore. Hoyle was forced to learn 
to “think in parallel” in order to fool the teacher into 
believing he paid attention in class. He then writes, 
“I mention these personal details because I believe 
they cast some light on the mysterious death of the 
French mathematician Evariste Galois.” Further com­
ment seems unnecessary.
Dupuy seems to have less of a vested interest. I 
assume he included all the documents known to him 
at the time. If not, then he too should be scrutinized 
more carefully. He does seem a priori unwilling to 
accept conspiracy theory.
At the very least, the three twentieth-century au­
thors are guilty of distorting Dupuy’s account and 
even falsifying it. In each case the story of Galois 
has been used to put a stamp of approval on the au­
thor’s personal theories. Indeed, all history is inter­
pretative. But if we do not approve, we understand 
the liberty: Galois, like Einstein, has passed into the 
public domain. No act or anecdote attributed to him 
is too outrageous to be given consideration. There 
is a closer analogy from farther afield. The Russian 

290
Algebra and Number Theory
composer Reinhold Gliere once wrote a symphony, 
his third, which ran well over an hour. Stokowski— 
the story goes—worked with Gliere to edit the score 
down to manageable length. Since then, every con­
ductor presents his own edition. I do not know if I 
have ever heard the original.
The investigations of Galois discussed here have 
told us less about the man than about his biogra­
phers. The misfortune is that the biographers have 
been scientists. Because they appreciate his genius 
a century after its undisputed establishment, anyone 
who did not recognize it at the time is condemned. 
“In all the history of science,” writes Bell, “there isno 
completer example of the triumph of crass stupidity 
over untamable genius.” “Is it possible to avoid the 
obvious conclusion,” asks Infeld, “that the regime of 
Louis-Phillipe was responsible for the early death of 
one of the greatest scientists who ever lived?” The 
underlying assumption is apparent: Galois was per­
secuted because he was a genius, and all scientists, to 
a greater or lesser degree, understand that genius is 
not tolerated by mediocrity. From this point of view, a 
genius must be recognized as such, even when stand­
ing drunk on a banquet table with a dagger in his 
hand. Anyone who does not recognize him becomes 
a fool, an assassin, or a prostitute. This is a presump­
tion of the highest arrogance. Scientists should not be 
so enamored of themselves.

Hermann Grassmann and the Creation 
of Linear Algebra
DESMOND FEARNLEY-SANDER
American Mathematical Monthly 86 (1979), 809-817
There is a way to advance algebra as far beyond 
what Vieta and Descartes have left us as Vieta 
and Descartes carried it beyond the ancients . . . 
We need an analysis which is distinctly geomet­
rical or linear, and which will express situation 
directly as algebra expresses magnitude directly.
Leibniz ([17], p. 382)
1 Introduction
From Pythagoras to the mid-nineteenth century, the 
fundamental problem of geometry was to relate num­
bers to geometry. It played a key role in the creation of 
field theory (via the classic construction problems), 
and, quite differently, in the creation of linear algebra. 
To resolve the problem, it was necessary to have the 
modern concept of real number; this was essentially 
achieved by Simon Stevin, around 1600, and was thor­
oughly assimilated into mathematics in the following 
two centuries. The integration of real numbers into 
geometry began with Descartes and Fermat in the 
1630s, and achieved an interim success at the end of 
the eighteenth century with the introduction into the 
mathematics curriculum of the traditional course in 
analytic geometry. From the point of view of analysis, 
with its focus on functions, this was entirely satisfac­
tory; but from the point of view of geometry, it was 
not: the method of attaching numbers to geometric 
entities is too clumsy, the choice of origin and axes 
irrelevant and (in view of Euclid) unnecessary.
Leibniz, in 1679, had mused upon the possibility of 
a universal algebra, an algebra with which one would 
deal directly and simply with geometric entities. The 
possibility is already suggested by a perusal of Euclid. 
For example, if D is a point in the side BC of a 
triangle ABC, then
BD _ ABD
BC = ABC ;
this ancient theorem begs to be proved by simply 
multiplying numerator and denominator on the left by 
A. The geometric algebra of which Leibniz dreamed, 
and in which the concept of real number is thoroughly 
assimilated, was created by Hermann Grassmann in 
the mid-nineteenth century.
Grassmann looked on geometry as it might well be 
considered today but is not, as being applied math­
ematics. In his view, there is a part of mathematics, 
linear algebra, that is applicable to a part of the phys­
ical world, chalk figures on a blackboard or objects in 
space; and geometry, as the business of relating the 
two, does not belong to mathematics pure and simple. 
One may say without great exaggeration that Grass­
mann invented linear algebra and, with none at all, 
that he showed how properly to apply it in geometry. 
Linear algebra has become a part of the mainstream 
of mathematics, though Grassmann gets scant credit 
for it; but its application to geometry, affine and Eu­
clidean, is remembered only in a half-baked version 
in which the notion of vector is all important and the 
notion of point is unnecessary.
The reason is that there are other applications 
of linear algebra which are of greater practical im­
portance (though they are no more interesting) than 
geometry—namely, within mathematics, to function 
spaces, and, within physics, to forces and other vec­
torial entities. [And yet, oddly enough, Grassmann’s 
geometry is better suited to physics, since, for exam­
ple, it distinguishes the notions of (polar) vector and 
axial vector; modern physics texts (such as Feynman 
[9]), in attempting to explain the physical distinction 
291

between the two types of entity, are handicapped by 
the fact that in the accepted model both have the same 
mathematical representation.]
2 Grassmann’s life
A biography of Grassmann, by Friedrich Engel, may 
be found in the Collected Works ([14], III.2) and also, 
more briefly, in Michael Crowe’s scholarly work [6], 
the main modern source in English of which I am 
aware.
Hermann Gunther Grassmann was born in Stettin 
in 1809, lived there most of his life, and died in 1877. 
He was one of twelve children and, after marrying at 
the age of 40, fell short of his father in himself siring 
only eleven. He spent three years in Berlin studying 
theology and philology. He had no university math­
ematical training, nor did he ever hold a university 
post, though he repeatedly sought one. His life was 
spent as a schoolteacher.
His major mathematical works are A Theory of 
Tides, which is a kind of thesis written in 1840 in the 
hope of improving his status as a teacher and which 
was unpublished until the appearance of the Collected 
Works between 1894 and 1911; a book known briefly 
as the Ausdehnungslehre (literally “Theory of Ex­
tension”), which was published in 1844 and almost 
totally ignored, though it was drawn to the attention 
of Mobius, Gauss, Kummer, Cauchy, and others; and 
the Ausdehnungslehre of 1862, which was a new work 
on the same subject, rather than a new edition, and 
which met an equally cold reception. (Both are in­
cluded in [14].) His many papers include important 
contributions to physics as well as to mathematics. He 
also wrote textbooks in mathematics and languages, 
edited a political journal for a time, and produced a 
translation of the Rig Veda and a huge commentary on 
it which, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica, is 
still used today. For his work in philology he received, 
in the last year of his life, an honorary doctorate. His 
achievements in mathematics were virtually unrecog­
nized, and it has taken a century for their importance 
to become clearly visible.
While I intend to devote my attention to his lin­
ear algebra and geometry, there are two other con­
tributions of Grassmann to mathematics which may 
be mentioned. In an arithmetic text [13] published 
in 1861, he defined the arithmetic operations for in­
tegers inductively and he proved their properties— 
commutativity, associativity, distributivity. He thus 
anticipated in its most important aspects Peano’s treat­
ment [20] of the natural numbers, published 28 years 
later. Peano generously acknowledges this, but in the 
naming game by which History distributes fame to 
the creators of mathematics Peano is a winner, Grass­
mann a loser. Dedekind, who published a similar de­
velopment [7] of the natural numbers in 1888, makes 
no mention of Grassmann.
A feature of Grassmann’s work, far in advance of 
the times, is the tendency toward the use of implicit 
definition—in which a mathematical entity is charac­
terized by means of its formal properties rather than 
being obtained by an explicit construction. For exam­
ple, in the Ausdehnungslehre of 1844 he comes very 
close indeed to the abstract notion ofa (not necessar­
ily associative) ring; what is lacking is the language 
of set theory. This is the second contribution I wanted 
to mention. Incidentally, the first formal definition of 
a ring was given by Fraenkel [11] in 1915.
3 The invention of linear algebra
From the beginning, Grassmann distinguished linear 
algebra, as a formal theory independent of any inter­
pretation, from its application in geometry. However, 
in the first Ausdehnungslehre, the algebra is inter­
mixed with its geometric interpretation—indicating, 
very interestingly, how he came upon the ideas. Those 
who did read his work in the late nineteenth century 
found it easier to follow the 1862 Ausdehnungslehre, 
in which, in modern style, the full development of the 
mathematical theory precedes its application, and in 
outlining his linear algebra I shall mainly follow the 
latter work; it should be borne in mind, though, that 
some of the ideas have their origin as much as two 
decades previously.
The definition of a linear space (or vector space) 
came into mathematics, in the sense of becoming 
widely known, around 1920, when Hermann Weyl 
[23] and others published formal definitions. In fact, 
such a definition had been given thirty years previ­
ously by Peano [19], who was thoroughly acquainted 
with Grassmann’s mathematical work. Grassmann 
did not put down a formal definition—again, the lan­
guage was not available—but there is no doubt that 
he had the concept. Beginning with a collection of 
“units” e1 ,e2 ,e3 ,..., he effectively defines the free 
linear space which they generate; that is to say, he 
considers formal linear combinations 22 aiei, where 
the ai are real numbers, defines addition and multi­
plication by real numbers by setting
0^a^ + 
Piei = yy ai + Pi) ei

FEARNLEY-SANDER: Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra
293
and
a 
aiei^ = ^(aai,)ei,
and formally proves the linear space properties for 
these operations. (At the outset, itis not clear whether 
the set of units is allowed to be infinite, but finiteness 
is implicitly assumed in some of his proofs.) He then 
develops the theory of linear independence in a way 
which is astonishingly similar to the presentation one 
finds in modern linear algebra texts.
He defines the notions of subspace, independence, 
span, dimension, join and meet of subspaces, and 
projections of elements onto subspaces. He is aware 
of the need to prove invariance of dimension under 
change of basis, and does so. He proves the Steinitz 
Exchange Theorem, named for the man who pub­
lished it [21] in 1913 (and who, incidentally, defined 
a linear space in terms of “units” in the same way 
Grassmann did). Among other such results, he shows 
that any finite set has an independent subset with the 
same span and that any independent set extends to a 
basis, and he proves the important identity
dim(U + W) = dim U + dim W — dim(U A W).
He obtains the formula for change of coordinates un­
der change of basis, defines elementary transforma­
tions of bases, and shows that every change of basis 
(equivalently, in modern terms, every invertible linear 
transformation) is a product of elementaries.
4 Products
In a paper [12] published in 1855, Grassmann defines 
a product of elements of a linear space by setting
aie^ 
fijej^ = 
aifijeiej,
and he proves distributivity. (In this paper the scalars 
are explicitly allowed to be complex.) If the ei ej are 
themselves linear combinations of the ei , we have 
here the concept of an algebra. Instead of following 
this path (though he did later observe that the algebra 
of quaternions is a special case), Grassmann singles 
out particular products by “equations of condition”
'^je Zij ei ej 
0,
and, observing as a disadvantage of this notion that it 
lacks invariance under change of basis, he proceeds to 
characterize those products whose conditioning equa­
tions are invariant under various substitutions.
Grassmann’s declared motive for publishing this 
paper was to claim priority for some results that had 
been published by Cauchy. The interesting story is 
related by Engel. In 1847 Grassmann had wanted 
to send a copy of the Ausdehnungslehre to Saint­
Venant (to show that he had anticipated some of Saint­
Venant’s ideas on vector addition and multiplication), 
but, not knowing the address, Grassmann sent the 
book to Cauchy, with a request to forward it. Cauchy 
never did so. And six years later Cauchy’s paper [4] 
appeared in Comptes Rendus. Grassmann’s comment 
was that, on reading this, “I recalled at a glance that 
the principles which are there established and the 
results which are proved were exactly the same as 
those which I published in 1844, and of which I gave 
at the same time numerous applications to algebraic 
analysis, geometry, mechanics and other branches of 
physics.” An investigating committee of three mem­
bers of the French Academy, including Cauchy him­
self, never came to a decision on the question of 
priority.
In the two Ausdehnungslehren, Grassmann singles 
out for special attention those products, which he calls 
linear products, for which the conditioning equations 
are invariant under change of basis. He shows that, 
apart from two trivial cases, there are only two possi­
ble types of product: it must be the case that either
eiej =ejei 
(1)
or
eiej = —ej ei (and, in particular, ei2 =0) 
(2)
for all i and j. Whereas in the 1855 paper he 
does not consider higher-order products, in the Aus- 
dehnungslehren he examines in detail products of the 
second type, extended, by imposing associativity, to 
allow multiplication of products of the original sim­
ple units (such a product being called a compound 
unit) and, by imposing distributivity, to allow multi­
plication of linear combinations of compound units 
(such a combination being called a form). Condition 
(2) entails certain relations among compound units of 
higher order (for example, that e1e3e2 = —e1e2e3), 
but it is assumed that no other relations hold. Di­
mension plays a role here, since, for example, in the 
three-dimensional case we have only a single inde­
pendent third-order unit, say e1 e2e3, and this forces 
independence of the three units e1e2, e2e3, and e3e1 
of order 2, because
Z 1 e 1 e 2 + Z2 e 2 e 3 + Z 3 e 3 e 1 = 0
implies, when we multiply by e3, that Z 1 e 1 e2 e3 =0 
and hence Z1 = 0 (and, similarly, Z2 =0=Z3).

294
Algebra and Number Theory
This multiplication is nowadays called exterior 
multiplication. Half a century later, in treating Grass­
mann’s ideas at length in his Universal Algebra [24], 
A. N. Whitehead explicitly excludes forms of mixed 
degree like e1 + e1 e2 on the rather metaphysical 
ground that they are “meaningless”; he thus admits 
arbitrary products of linear combinations of simple 
units, but not arbitrary linear combination of prod­
ucts. Whitehead’s objection itself would have been 
meaningless to Grassmann and, although he never 
explicitly brings in such forms, neither, so far as I 
can see, does he explicitly exclude them. If I am right 
about this, then Grassmann has the full exterior alge­
bra, while Whitehead’s presentation (like many mod­
ern treatments of exterior products) restricts consider­
ation to a graded linear space (a far less tidy structure 
than an algebra).
The full development of exterior algebra as Grass­
mann did it (in particular the essential invariance 
under change of basis) is complicated and must be 
omitted. Perhaps the most important fact is that ele­
ments a1 ,a2 ,...,ak of the original linear space are 
linearly independent if and only if a 1 a2 • • • ak =0; 
Grassmann proves this in the modern way and gives 
the following application (with notation precisely as 
I have written it) to a system of n linear equations in 
n unknowns,
a 11) x 1 + a 21) x 2 + • • • + an1-* xn = ft (1)
a 12) x 1 + a 22) x 2 + • • • + a(2 xn = ft (2)
• • •
a(n)x + a(n)x + •••+ a(n)x = ft(n) 
a1 x1 a2 x2 • • • an xn = 
.
Introducing (independent) units e(1),e(2),...,e(n) 
and quantities
a = a(1)e(1) + a(2)e(2) + ••• + a(n)e(n)
a1 = a e + a e 
+ • • • + a e
a = a(1)e(1) + a(2)e(2) + ••• + a(n)e(n)
a2 = a e + a e 
+ • • • + a e
a = a (1) e (1) + a (2) e (2) + ••• + a (n) e (n) 
an = an e 
+ an e 
+ • •• + an e
and
b = ft (1) e (1) + ft (2) e (2) + ••• + ft (n) e (n),
we have
b = x1a1 + x2a2 + •••+xnan,
and so ba2 a3 •••an = x1 a1 a2 •••an, ...... Thus if
a1 a2 •••an =0we have the unique solution
ba2 a3 •••an
x 1 = ---------------- , x 2 = . . . , . . . .
a1a2a3 •••an
(Equivalently, x1 is the number obtained by dividing 
the (non-zero) determinant of the matrix obtained 
from aj(i) by replacing each a1(i) by ft(i) .) This is 
Cramer’s rule [5]. The same elegant derivation (but 
without the double subscript-superscript notation) is 
given in the first Ausdehnungslehre. It is one of the 
techniques that occurs in the above-mentioned paper 
of Cauchy.
5 Inner products
Grassmann derives the concept of inner product from 
that of exterior product in a very interesting way. 
Working in the algebra generated by the simple units 
e1 ,e2 ,...,en (subject, as always, to (2)), he defines 
the supplement |E of a compound unit E as +1 or 
-1 times the product of those of the simple units that 
are not factors of E, the sign + or - being chosen in 
such a way that
E|E = +e1e2 •••en .
For example, in the three-dimensional case,
|e1 = e2e3 and |e1 e3 = -e2.
The supplement is extended to linear combinations 
of compound units of the same order by linearity:
| 
aj Ej = 
aj |Ej .
(The map A ^ |A is nowadays called the Hodge star­
operator.) If E and F are forms of the same order, 
then necessarily E |F is a multiple of e1 e2 •••en ; 
indeed, since the forms of order n make up a one­
dimensional linear space, one may identify them 
with the scalars, and this Grassmann does, set­
ting e1e2 •••en =1. Although E|F makes sense for 
forms E and F of different order, itis only in the case 
where both orders are the same (in particular, where 
they are both 1) that E |F is a number. Noting that 
E|F is linear in both E and F, Grassmann calls E|F 
the inner product of E and F . Its restriction to the 
original linear space (the space of forms of order 1) 
is indeed an inner product in the modern sense, since, 
as he shows,
1ifi = j
ei|ej = 0ifi=j ,

and hence
ae^^i i^2 pjej 
y? Oi^i.
He calls y/a]a the numerical value of a. The notion 
of a complete orthonormal set is introduced, and it 
is shown that such a set must be independent and 
that in theorems involving the inner product the orig­
inal system of units may be replaced by any such set. 
The notions of orthogonal complement and orthog­
onal projection are investigated; the Gram-Schmidt 
Process is at least implicitly involved in this.
6 Linear transformations
For the linear transformation that carries the basis 
elements e1 ,e2,...,en tob1 ,b2,...,bn,respectively, 
Grassmann writes
q = b 1 ,b2 ,...,bn
e1,e2,...,en
and considers Q to be a generalized quotient. While 
there are obvious problems with this notation, it does 
have a certain elegance; for example, ifb1 ,b2,...,bn 
are independent then the inverse of Q is
euei,.^ 
b1,b2,...,bn
He effectively obtains the matrix representation ofQ 
by showing that it may be written 
Q=
ar,sEr,s
where
0,...,0,es,0,...,0 
Er,s — 
.
e1 , . . . ,er , . . . ,en
The determinant of Q is defined to be the number
b1 b2 ••• bn
, 
e1e2 ■■■ en
eigenvalues and eigenvectors are introduced (though 
different terms are used), and the fact that the eigen­
values are roots of the characteristic polynomial is 
demonstrated as follows. Suppose that
Qx — px
where x 52 &iei — 0. Writing ci — (p — Q)ei, we 
see that 52 Zici — 0; thus c 1, c2,..., cn are dependent 
and hence
[(p - Q ) e 1][( p - Q ) e 2] • • • [( p - Q ) en] — 0.
Since e 1 e2 • • • en — 0, this is equivalent to the vanish­
ing of the determinant of the linear map p — Q.Itis 
shown that the eigenvectors corresponding to distinct 
eigenvalues are independent and the spectral theorem 
for a symmetric Q is proved.
Turning to a general linear transformation Q, 
Grassmann shows, in effect (by constructing an ap­
propriate basis), that the whole space may be decom­
posed as the direct sum of invariant subspaces Wp , 
where p ranges through the characteristic roots ofQ, 
and each Wp is the kernel of(Q — p)k, k being the al­
gebraic multiplicity ofp. While the spectral theorem 
had been proved by Weierstrass [22] in 1858 (and, 
for the case of n distinct eigenvalues, by Cauchy [3] 
in 1829), it appears that Grassmann was the first to 
prove the latter result which is sometimes called the 
primary decomposition theorem; it goes part of the 
way to obtaining Jordan’s canonical form, published 
in 1870 [16] (the remaining step being to reduce the 
nilpotent maps Q — p : Wp ^ Wp).
7 
Geometry
In the Ausdehnungslehre of 1844, Grassmann de­
scribes the geometric considerations which led him 
to the theory that we now call linear algebra. Musing 
on the formula
AB + BC — AC, 
(3)
which one might find in old geometry texts, to de­
scribe a relationship between lengths that holds for 
collinear points A, B and C, with B between A and 
C, he realized that the formula remains valid regard­
less of the order of the three collinear points, provided 
that one sets
BA — —AB; 
(4)
for example, if C lies between A and B then (3) 
follows from the fact that
AB — AC + CB — AC — BC.
Over many years Grassmann carefully investigated 
the consequences of (4), which is the special property 
that defines an exterior algebra. His development of 
geometry is complicated, and we shall give here an 
oversimplified presentation that brings one rapidly to 
the heart of the matter; those who regard it as criminal 
to attempt a modern paraphrase of old mathematics 
should read no further. To avoid (merely notational) 
complications we shall, like Grassmann, restrict our­
selves to three dimensions.
Beginning with the basic material of geometry, 
numbers and points, we permit them to be combined 

296
Algebra and Number Theory
by formal operations of sum and product, assuming 
the elementary algebraic rules for such operations, 
but subject to the condition that (4) holds for all points 
A and B and also that
aA = Aa 
(5)
for all real numbers a and points A. From (4) we 
deduce that every point A has A2 =0; thus the square 
of a point is a number, and we explicitly assume that 
it is not a point:
0 is not a point. 
(6)
We need a rule by which to interpret geometrically 
the entities which occur in this formal algebra. For a 
pair of points A and B, and positive real numbers a 
and p with a + p =1, write
P = aA + pB.
Then immediately we have
AP = pAB, PB = aAB and AP +PB= AB;
these formulas suggest that P should be interpreted 
as the unique point which divides the line segment 
from A to B in the ratio p to a. We do so interpret P; 
it is here, via the bijection a ^ aA + pB between 
[0, 1] and the line segment, that numbers enter geom­
etry, and all other geometric interpretations follow 
from this one. To give an immediate example, the in­
terpretation of P = aA + pB with a < 0 and p > 0 
anda + p =1is forced by the fact that, equivalently,
B=(-a A+(p P,
where -a/p > 0, 1 /p > 0 and (-a/p) + 1 /p = 1. 
The line through A and B is the set of all aA + pB 
with a + p =1, and accordingly we assume that
if A and B are points and a + p =1
then aA + pB is a point. 
(7)
To sum up, we consider a ring Q, in which the 
number 1 is a unit element and which is generated 
by R U P, where R is the set of real numbers and 
P is a set whose elements are called points, subject 
to the conditions (4), (5), (6), and (7); equivalently, 
Q may be regarded as an algebra generated by P. 
Dimensionality comes in with the assumption that
Q is generated, as an algebra, by four elements
of P but not by three, 
(8) 
and, finally, ensuring non-triviality of multiplication, 
that
there exist points A, B, C, D with ABCD =0.
(9) 
Existence and uniqueness of such a structure are 
proved in [8]. We then have a model for the geometry 
of three-dimensional space; the multiplication is an 
exterior product and Grassmann’s abstract theory may 
now be brought to bear in a situation where geometric 
interpretation is possible.
The difference of two points is a vector; here the 
interpretation is forced by the identity
B — A = C — D —^ 2( A + C) = 2( B + D).
The sum of a vector X and a point A is a point, since
A + X = B X = B - A.
And a product of a number and a vector is a vector, 
since for X = B - A we have aX = P - A, where 
P =(1- a)A + aB; this also entails that aX is to 
be interpreted as having the same direction as X and 
a times its length.
Here is a classic theorem which with just these 
ideas becomes trivial: if, in a triangle with vertices 
A, B, and C, the points D and E, respectively, divide 
the side from A to B and the side from A to C in 
equal ratios, then the line segment from D to E is 
parallel to the one from B to C and the ratio of their 
lengths is the appropriate number. The proof is two 
lines:
D =aA+pB, E=aA+pC
^ D - E = p (B - C).
The hypotheses (8) and (9) imply that the space of 
all fourth-order forms is one-dimensional: ifA, B, C, 
and D are independent points, then any product 
ABC'D' is a multiple of ABCD and one may 
show that the ratio must be interpreted as the ratio of 
the oriented volumes of the associated tetrahedra. In 
particular, ABCD = A'B'C'D' means that the two 
tetrahedra have the same orientation and volume. This 
in turn forces one to interpret ABC = A'BC' as 
meaning that the associated triangles are coplanar and 
have the same orientation and area; and AB = A'B' 
as meaning that the associated line segments lie on 
the same line and are equal in length and direction.
We may now prove the converse ofthe above result 
about triangles in exactly the way that it was done by 
Euclid. If the line segments from D to E and from B 

FEARNLEY-SANDER: Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra
297
to C are parallel, then
DB _ DBC _ EBC _ EC 
AB = ABC = ABC = AC,
where we have used the fact that for a suitable real a
DBC = [E + a(B - C)]BC = EBC.
Again, here is the proof that the diagonal of a par­
allelogram bisects it:
D = C + A - B ^ ABD = -ABC.
These examples give an indication, if no more, of 
the power of Grassmann’s geometric interpretation 
of linear algebra. They are results of affine geom­
etry, but by introducing an inner product one gets 
equally transparent algebraic proofs of the theorems 
of Euclidean geometry and trigonometry. (Inciden­
tally, Grassmann, with his inclination toward abstrac­
tion and generality, displays little interest in proving 
known results of geometry, and these proofs are mine; 
many other examples are given by Forder [10].)
8 
Contemporary and later 
developments
Though in 1844 he had been unaware of their work, 
Grassmann later acknowledged that in some respects 
his theory was anticipated, in particular, by the con­
cept of vector addition of Bellavitis [1] and others, 
and by the barycentric calculus of Mobius [18]. But 
no one had approached the elegant simplicity of the 
formula
(C-B)+(B-A)=C-A
which, for Grassmann, forces the interpretation of the 
sum of two vectors; and Mobius had not exploited the 
full possibilities of his notation
P = aA + pB + yC,
which, even today, in his brilliant [2], is dismissed by 
Boyer as inferior to the homogeneous coordinate rep­
resentation P =(a, p, y). The key to the difference 
between Mobius and Grassmann is that, whereas for 
Mobius the equation aA + pB = a A + p' B entails 
merely that a : p = a' : p', for Grassmann it implies 
that a = a' and p = p'; the one concept is appropri­
ate to projective geometry, the other to Euclidean.
The story of Hamilton’s invention of the quater­
nions [15] in 1843 and of the subsequent influence 
of Hamilton and of Grassmann in the emergence of 
vector analysis is well told by Crowe. But vector anal­
ysis in Crowe’s sense of the term is a subject that has 
ceased to exist, or should have; it has been absorbed 
by linear algebra. It would not be easy to estimate the 
relative influences of the two men in the development 
of linear algebra as we know it, but there is no doubt 
that Grassmann in his own work came far closer to 
it than Hamilton or any of his contemporaries. Even 
in those cases where forerunners may be discerned, 
his results, and especially his methods, were highly 
original. All mathematicians stand, as Newton said 
he did, on the shoulders of giants, but few have come 
closer than Hermann Grassmann to creating, single­
handedly, a new subject.
9 
Conclusion
The genius of Descartes revealed itself in his deci­
sion to drop the ancient convention that a product 
of line segments is a rectangle. In Grassmann’s ge­
ometry a product of line segments is again a higher­
dimensional object. It is a return to Euclid, but to Eu­
clid with a difference, the difference that had been 
dreamed of by Leibniz. But Grassmann’s geome­
try (as distinct from his linear algebra) has been 
largely forgotten. Perhaps this is because, at the mo­
ment when it might have been remembered, Hilbert, 
with his immense prestige, closed the book of Euclid 
by showing that Euclid’s program, rigorously carried 
through, was too tedious for anyone to bother with. 
Grassman’s way is not tedious; properly done, it is 
simple, direct, and powerful, and perhaps the book 
should be opened again.
I conclude with a quotation (as translated in ([6], 
p. 89) from the preface to the 1862 Ausdehnungslehre:
I remain completely confident that the labor I 
have expended on the science presented here 
and which has demanded a significant part of 
my life as well as the most strenuous application 
of my powers, will not be lost. It is true that I 
am aware that the form which I have given the 
science is imperfect and must be imperfect. But 
I know and feel obliged to state (though I run the 
risk of seeming arrogant) that even if this work 
should again remain unused for another seven­
teen years or even longer, without entering into 
the actual development of science, still that time 
will come when it will be brought forth from the 
dust of oblivion and when ideas now dormant 
will bring forth fruit. I know that if I also fail to 
gather around me (as I have until now desired in 
vain) a circle of scholars, whom I could fructify 
with these ideas, and whom I could stimulate 

298
Algebra and Number Theory
to develop and enrich them further, yet there 
will come a time when these ideas, perhaps in 
a new form, will arise anew and will enter into 
a living communication with contemporary de­
velopments. For truth is eternal and divine.

The Roots of Commutative Algebra 
in Algebraic Number Theory
ISRAEL KLEINER
Mathematics Magazine 68 (1995), 3-15
Introduction
The concepts of field, commutative ring, ideal, and 
unique factorization are among the fundamental no­
tions of commutative algebra. How did they arise? In 
large measure, from three central problems in number 
theory: Fermat’s Last Theorem, reciprocity laws, and 
binary quadratic forms. In this paper we will describe 
how this happened.
To put the issues in a broader context, these three 
number-theoretic problems were instrumental in the 
emergence of algebraic number theory—one of the 
two main sources of the modern discipline of com­
mutative algebra. The other source was algebraic ge­
ometry. It was in the setting of these two subjects that 
many of the main concepts and results of commuta­
tive algebra evolved in the nineteenth century. Thus 
commutative algebra can be said to have been well 
developed before it was created.
Commutative algebra is nowadays understood to 
be the study of commutative noetherian rings. The 
first book on the subject, dating from the 1950s, was 
Zariski and Samuel’s Commutative Algebra. In the 
first decades of the twentieth century, what we un­
derstand as commutative algebra was known as Ideal 
Theory, a name which reflects the sources of the sub­
ject.
To set the scene for our story, a word about mathe­
matics, and especially algebra, in the nineteenth cen­
tury. The period witnessed fundamental transforma­
tions in mathematics—in its concepts, its methods, 
and in mathematicians’ attitude toward their subject. 
These included a growing insistence on rigor and ab­
straction; a predisposition for founding general the­
ories rather than focusing on specific problems; an 
acceptance of non-constructive existence proofs; the 
emergence of mathematical specialties and special­
ists; the rise of the view of mathematics as a free 
human activity, neither deriving from, nor dependent 
on, nor necessarily applicable to concrete setting; the 
rise of set-theoretic thinking; and the re-emergence of 
(a new variant of) the axiomatic method. As for alge­
bra, its subject-matter and methods changed beyond 
recognition. Algebra as the study of solvability of 
polynomial equations gave way to algebra as the study 
of abstract structures defined axiomatically. While in 
the past algebra was on the periphery of mathematics, 
it now (the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) 
became one of its central concerns. Moreover, alge­
bra began to penetrate other mathematical fields (e.g. 
geometry, analysis, logic, topology, number theory) 
to such an extent that in the early decades of the twen­
tieth century one began to speak of the algebraization 
of mathematics ([3], p. 135 and [23]).
Algebraic number theory and 
unique factorization
Algebraic number theory arose (as noted) from the in­
vestigation of three fundamental problems: Fermat’s 
Last Theorem, reciprocity laws, and binary quadratic 
forms. Although these problems had their roots in the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, they began to 
be intensively studied only in the nineteenth century. 
The strategy that began to emerge was to embed the 
domain Z of integers, in terms of which these prob­
lems were formulated, in domains of (what came to 
be known as) algebraic integers. Let me explain.
Fermat’s Last Theorem states that xn + yn = zn 
has no non-trivial integer solutions for n>2.Itsuf- 
fices to consider n =4 and n = p, an odd prime. 
299

Algebra and Number Theory
Fermat proved the conjecture for n =4in the early 
seventeenth century, and Euler proved it for n =3in 
the eighteenth (Euler’s proof had a gap). In the early 
nineteenth century, Dirichlet and Legendre proved 
Fermat’s conjecture for n =5, but the case n =7de- 
fied the efforts of the best mathematicians, including 
Dirichlet and Gauss. A new approach was called for. 
It was provided by Lame.
On March 1, 1847, Lame excitedly announced be­
fore the Paris Academy of Sciences that he had proved 
Fermat’s Last Theorem. His basic idea was to factor 
the left-hand side of xp + yp = zp as follows:
xp + yp
= (x + y)(x + uy)(x + u2y) ••• (x + up-1 y), (1)
where u is a primitive pth root of 1. Since xP + yp = 
zp , the product of the factors on the right-hand 
side of (1) is a pth power. Lame claimed that if 
these factors are relatively prime, then each is a pth 
power. From this a contradiction can be derived us­
ing Fermat’s method of infinite descent. If the fac­
tors x + y,x + uy,...,x+ up-1y are not relatively 
prime, then, upon division by a suitable a, we obtain 
the relatively prime factors
x + y x + uy x + up-1 y 
, 
, • • • , 
,
aa 
a
and the proof, Lame asserted, proceeds analogously
The essential idea of Lame’s approach is contained 
in the following method for finding all primitive 
Pythagorean triples (x, y, z). Factoring the left-hand 
side of x2 + y2 = z2 we get (x + yi)(x - yi)=z2 . 
It can be shown that x + yi and x - yi are rel­
atively prime (since (x, y, z)=1), and since their 
product is a square, each is a square. In particular, 
x + yi =(a + bi)2 =(a2 - b2 ) + 2abi, hence x = 
a2 - b2, y = 2ab, and it follows that z = a2 + b2 . 
This is the standard formula yielding all Pythagorean 
triples.
Following Lame’s presentation, Liouville, who was 
in the audience, took the floor and pointed to what 
seemed to him to be a gap in Lame’s proof. The gap, 
he said, was Lame’s contention that if a product of 
relatively prime factors is a pth power, then each of 
the factors must be a pth power. This result is of course 
true for the integers, Liouville noted, but it required 
a proof for the complex entities Lame was dealing 
with.
Liouville’s observation went to the head of what 
was wrong with Lame’s proof. Specifically, to prove 
Lame’s claim one had to show that unique factoriza­
tion holds in the domain
Dp = |ao + a i u + • • • + ap-1 up 
: ai G Z^
of so-called cyclotomic integers. About three months 
after Lame’s presentation Kummer wrote to Liouville 
that Dp is in general not a unique factorization do­
main (UFD). (The first p forwhichitisnotisp = 23.)
It is important to note that although Lame’s proof 
was false (it is correct for those p for which Dp is a 
UFD), his overall strategy proved fundamental for 
subsequent approaches to Fermat’s Last Theorem. 
In particular, he proved the theorem for n = 7(!), a 
feat that (we recall) eluded the likes of Dirichlet and 
Gauss.
We turn now to reciprocity laws. It is no easy matter 
to define what a reciprocity law is; see [10], [22], [30]; 
for our purposes, the descriptions that follow suffice. 
Gauss was the first to define formally the notion of 
congruence. Thus it was natural for him to pose the 
question of solvability of the congruence
ao + aix + a2x2 + • • • + anxn = 0 (mod n).
The problem in this generality proved intractable (it 
is so to this day), and so Gauss considered a sim­
pler case, namely a0 + a1x + a2x2 = 0 (mod n). 
Several reductions show that it suffices to consider 
the congruence x2 = q (mod p), where both p and 
q are odd primes (the case of even primes has to 
be considered separately). Gauss proved that there 
is a reciprocity relation between the solvability of 
x2 = q (mod p) and x2 = p (mod q). Specifically, 
x2 = q (mod p) is solvable if, and only if, x2 = p 
(mod q) is solvable, unless p = q = 3 (mod 4). In 
the latter case, x2 = q (mod p) is solvable if, and 
only if, x2 = p (mod q) is not. This is the celebrated 
quadratic reciprocity law, one of the “jewels of num­
ber theory”, proved in Gauss’ Disquisitiones Arith- 
meticae of 1801.
What about higher reciprocity laws? That is, is 
there a reciprocity relation between the solvability of 
xm = q (mod p) and xm = p (mod q),form>2? 
Gauss opined that such laws cannot even be properly 
conjectured within the context of natural numbers 
([29], p. 105), adding that ([17], p. 108)
The previously accepted laws of arithmetic are 
not sufficient for the foundations of a general 
theory ... Such a theory demands that the do­
main of higher arithmetic be endlessly enlarged.

A prophetic statement, indeed. Gauss was calling (in 
modern terms) for the founding of an arithmetic the­
ory of algebraic numbers. In fact, Gauss himself be­
gan to enlarge the domain of arithmetic by introduc­
ing what came to be known as the Gaussian integers,
Z[i] = {a + bi : a,b G Z},
and showing that they form a UFD. This he did in 
two papers in 1829 and 1831, in which he used Z[i] 
to formulate the law of biquadratic reciprocity.
In the 1831 paper Gauss also introduced the geo­
metric representation of complex numbers as points 
in the Euclidean plane. At about the same time, Jacobi 
and Eisenstein (as well as Gauss in unpublished pa­
pers) formulated the cubic reciprocity law. Here one 
needed to consider the domain
Z[p] = {a + bp : a,b G Z},
where p is a primitive cube root of 1. Z[p] was also 
shown to be a UFD. The search was on for higher 
reciprocity laws. But as in the case of Fermat’s Last 
Theorem, here too one needed new methods to deal 
with cases beyond the first few, since unlike Z[i] and 
Z[p], other domains of higher arithmetic needed to 
formulate such laws were not UFDs.
We now turn to the third number-theoretic prob­
lem related to the rise of algebraic number theory— 
namely, representation of integers by binary quad­
ratic forms. (This problem is, in fact, intimately con­
nected to reciprocity laws; see [10].) An (integral) 
binary quadratic form is an expression of the form
f (x, y)=ax2 + bxy + cy2 , a,b,c G Z.
The major problem of the theory of quadratic forms 
was: Given a form f, find all integers m that can be 
represented by f; that is, for which f(x, y)=m.This 
problem was studied for specific f by Fermat, and in­
tensively investigated by Euler. For example, Fermat 
considered the representation of integers as sums of 
two squares. It was, however, Gauss in the Disqui- 
sitiones who made the fundamental breakthroughs 
and developed a comprehensive and beautiful theory 
of binary quadratic forms. Most important was his 
definition of the composition of two forms and his 
proof that the (equivalence classes of) forms with a 
given discriminant D = b2 - 4ac form a commuta­
tive group under this composition.
The idea behind composition of forms is simple: 
if forms f and g represent integers m and n, re­
spectively, then their composition f * g should repre­
sent the product mn. The implementation of this idea 
is subtle and “extremely difficult to describe” ([13], 
p. 334). Attempts to gain conceptual insight into 
Gauss’s theory of composition of forms inspired the 
efforts of some of the best mathematicians of the time, 
among them Dirichlet, Kummer, and Dedekind. The 
key idea here, too, was to extend the domain ofhigher 
arithmetic and view the problem in a broader context.
Here is perhaps the simplest illustration. Ifm1 and 
m2 are sums of two squares, so is m1m2. Indeed, if 
m1 = x12 + y12 and m2 = x22 + y22 , then
m1m2 = (x1x2 - y1y2)2 + (x1y2 + x2y1)2 .
In terms of the composition of quadratic forms this 
can be expressed as
f(x1,y1) * f(x2,y2)
= f(x1x2 - y1y2,x1y2 + x2y1),
orf * f = f, where f(x, y)=x2 + y2. But even this 
“simple” law of composition seems mysterious and 
ad hoc, until one introduces the Gaussian integers, 
which make it transparent (<5 denotes the conjugate 
of a):
(x12 + y12)(x22 + y12)
=(x1 + y1 i)(x1 - y1i) (x2 + y2 i)(x2 - y2i)
= (x 1 + yii)(x2 + y2i) (x 1 + y 1 i)(x2 + y2i)
= [(x1x2 - y1y2) + (x1y2 + x2 y1)i]
x [(x 1 x2 - y 1 y2) + (x 1 y2 + x2y 1)i]
= (x1x2 - y1y2)2 + (x1y2 + x2y1)2.
In general, ax2 + bxy + cy2 = m can be written 
as
where D = b2 - 4ac is the discriminant of the 
quadratic form. We have thus expressed the prob­
lem of representation of integers by binary quadratic 
forms in terms of the domain
R=
: u, v G Z, u = v (mod 2) > .
Specifically, ifwe let
a = a, 
then
ax2 + bxy + cy2
-(ax + (y)(a x + (3 y) 
a
= - N (ax + py), 
a 

302
Algebra and Number Theory
where N denotes the norm. Thus to solve ax2 + 
bxy + cy2 = m is to find x,y G Z such that N(ax + 
py) = m. In fact, Kummer noted in the 1840s that 
the entire theory of binary quadratic forms can 
be regarded as the theory of “complex numbers” 
(Kummer’s terminology) of the form x + ^/D ([6], 
p. 585). And since such domains of “complex num­
bers” did not, in general, possess unique factorization, 
the development of their arithmetic theory became an 
important goal. (Gauss’ theory of binary quadratic 
forms may, in fact, be seen as the first major (im­
plicit) attempt to deal with non-unique factorization.)
It is time to take stock. We have seen that in deal­
ing with central problems in number theory—namely 
Fermat’s Last Theorem, reciprocity laws, and binary 
quadratic forms—it was found important to formu­
late them as problems in domains of (what came 
to be called) algebraic integers. This often trans­
formed additive problems into multiplicative ones 
(e.g., x3 + y3 = z3) was changed to
(x + y)(x + py)(x + p2 y) = z3,
p a primitive cube root of unity. Now, multiplica­
tive problems in number theory are, in general, much 
easier to handle than additive problems—provided 
that one has the (multiplicative) machinery to do it, 
namely unique factorization in the domain under con­
sideration. Thus the study of unique factorization in 
domains of algebraic integers became the major prob­
lem of a newly emerging subject—algebraic number 
theory. Number theory had lost its innocence (which, 
at the appropriate time, is of course no bad thing). 
After more than 2000 years in which number the­
ory meant the study of properties of the (positive) 
integers, its scope became enormously enlarged. One 
could no longer use the term “integer” with impunity. 
The term had to be qualified—a rational (ordinary) 
integer, a Gaussian integer, a cyclotomic integer, a 
quadratic integer, or any one of an infinite species 
of other algebraic integers. Of course the real diffi­
culty was not the multiplicity of types of integers, but 
the fact that, in general, domains of such integers no 
longer possessed unique factorization.
Could one regain the paradise lost by establish­
ing unique factorization in some sense for these do­
mains? An affirmative answer was given by Dedekind 
and Kronecker in the last third of the nineteenth cen­
tury. We will describe the work of Dedekind, who 
introduced the notions of ideal and prime ideal, and 
showed that every nonzero ideal in an arbitrary do­
main of algebraic integers is a unique product of 
prime ideals. (An ideal P is prime ifxy G P implies 
x G P or y G P .) This result generalizes the theo­
rems on unique factorization of elements into primes 
in (for example) Z, Z[i], and Z[p]. But it was pre­
ceded by very significant contributions by Kummer 
to the problem of unique factorization, which inspired 
both Dedekind and Kronecker (in different ways). We 
begin with a sketch of Kummer’s contribution.
Kummer and ideal numbers
We recall that the domains of cyclotomic integers
Dp = {a 0 + ai^ + • • • + ap 11 ^p 1 :
ai G Z, w a primitive pth root of 1}
were central in the study of Fermat’s conjecture. They 
also proved important in the investigation of higher 
reciprocity laws. The two problems are, in fact, re­
lated, and progress on one was often linked with 
progress on the other (see [18], p. 203). Gauss con­
tended that if he were able to derive higher reciprocity 
laws, then Fermat’s Last Theorem would be one of 
the less interesting corollaries. That is one prediction 
where Gauss proved to be wrong. A general reci­
procity law (due to Artin) was obtained in the 1920s, 
but Fermat’s problem was not resolved until Andrew 
Wiles’s proof in the mid-1990s. In any case, Wiles’s 
proof does by no means follow from Artin’s reci­
procity law.
Both Fermat’s problem and higher reciprocity laws 
were of great interest to Kummer (the latter apparently 
more than the former), and to make serious progress 
on them it was essential to establish unique factoriza­
tion (of some type) in the domains Dp . This Kummer 
accomplished in the 1840s. As he put it in a letter to 
Liouville, unique factorization in Dp “can be saved 
by the introduction of a new kind of complex num­
bers that I have called ideal complex numbers” ([3], 
p. 101). Kummer then showed that every element in 
the domain of cyclotomic integers is a unique product 
of ideal primes.
Kummer’s theory was vague and computational. 
In fact, the central notion of ideal number was only 
implicitly defined in terms of its divisibility properties 
(see [13] or [14]). Kummer noted that in adopting the 
implicit definition he was guided by the idea of free 
radical in chemistry, a substance whose existence can 
only be discerned by its effects ([9], p. 35).
The following example (even if not of a cyclotomic 
domain) may give a sense of Kummer’s theory of ideal 
numbers. Let D = {a + ^/5i : a,b G Z}. This is a 
standard example (due to Dedekind) of a domain in 

KLEINER: The Roots of Commutative Algebra in Algebraic Number Theory

which factorization is not unique. For example,
6 = 2 x 3 = (1 + V5 i )(1 - V5 i),
where 2, 3, and 1 ^/5i are primes (indecompos- 
ables) in D ([1], p. 250). To restore unique fac­
torization of 6 e D, adjoin the ideal numbers s/2, 
(1 + V5i)//, and (1 - /5i) /. These are, in 
fact, ideal primes.
We then have 
6 = 2 x 3 = V2 x a/2 x 1 + /5 i 
/2
1 — /5 i 
/2
and
6 = (1W5i )(1 -JI i) 
= /2 x 1 + /5 i 
/2
that is, the decomposition of 6 into primes is now 
unique. Furthermore, although the choice of the ideal 
primes a/2, (1 ± V5i) /V2 seems to have been ad 
hoc, it will come to seem natural after ideals are in­
troduced.
A cruder but perhaps more revealing example is 
the “domain”
H= {3k+1:k=0,1,2,...}
= {1,4,7,10,13,...},
introduced by Hilbert. (This is not an integral do­
main, but its structure as a multiplicative semigroup 
illustrates the ideas involved.) Here
100 = 10 x 10 = 4 x 25,
where 4, 10, and 25 are primes ofH. We can eliminate 
the non-uniqueness of this factorization by adjoining 
the “ideal primes” 2 and 5. Then
100=10x 10=2x5x2x5
and
100 = 4 x 25= 2 x 2 x 5 x 5.
The notion of adjoining elements to a given mathe­
matical structure in order to obtain a desired property 
is commonplace and important in various areas of 
mathematics. Thus we adjoin /—1 to the reals to ob­
tain algebraic closure, and adjoin ideal points (points 
at infinity) to the euclidean plane to obtain symmetry 
(duality) between points and lines. The adjunction of 
ideal numbers to the cyclotomic integers should be 
seen in the same light.
Kummer’s ideas were brilliant but difficult and not 
clearly formulated. The fundamental concepts of 
ideal number and ideal prime were not intrinsically 
defined. “Today,” notes Edwards, “few mathemati­
cians would find [Kummer’s] definition [of ideal 
primes] acceptable” ([16], p. 6). Most importantly, 
Kummer’s decomposition theory was devised only 
for cyclotomic integers (he mentions, without elabo­
ration, that an analogous theory could be developed 
for algebraic integers of the form x + WD). What 
was needed was a decomposition theory that would 
apply to arbitrary domains of algebraic integers. This 
called for a fundamentally new approach to the sub­
ject, provided (independently, and in different ways) 
by Dedekind and Kronecker. We will focus (as men­
tioned) on Dedekind’s formulation, which is the one 
that has generally prevailed.
Dedekind and ideals
Dedekind’s work [11] in 1871 was revolutionary in 
several ways: in its formulation, its grand conception, 
its fundamental new ideas, and its modern spirit. Its 
main result was that every non-zero ideal in the do­
main of integers of an algebraic number field is a 
unique product of prime ideals. Before one could 
state this theorem one had, of course, to define the 
concepts in its statement, especially “the domain of 
integers of an algebraic number field” and “ideal.” It 
took Dedekind about 20 years to formulate them.
The number-theoretic domains studied at the time, 
such as the Gaussian integers, the integers arising 
from cubic reciprocity, and the cyclotomic integers, 
are all of the form
Z[6] = {a0 + a 1 6 + • • • + an6n : ai e Z},
where 6 satisfies an appropriate polynomial with in­
teger coefficients. It was therefore tempting to de­
fine the domains to which Dedekind’s theorem would 
apply as objects of this type. These were, how­
ever, the wrong objects, Dedekind showed. For ex­
ample, he proved that Kummer’s theory of unique 
factorization could not be extended to the domain 
Z[/3i] = {a + b/3i : a,b e Z} ([14], p. 337), and, 
of course, Dedekind’s objective was to try to extend 
Kummer’s theory to all domains of algebraic inte­
gers. One had to begin the search for the appropriate 
domains, Dedekind contended, within an algebraic 
number field—a finite field extension
Q(a) = {q0 + q 1 a +------ + qsas : qi e Q}
of the rationals, a an algebraic number (the notion 
of algebraic number was well known at the time, 
but not that of algebraic integer). He showed that 

304
Algebra and Number Theory
Q(a) is closed under the four algebraic operations 
of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, 
and then defined axiomatically (for the first time) the 
notion ofa field ([3], p. 118):
A system A of real or complex numbers is called 
a field if the sum, difference, product, and quo­
tient of any two numbers of A belongs to A.
This procedure was typical of Dedekind’s modus 
operandi: He would distill from a concrete object (in 
this case Q(a)) the properties of interest to him (in 
this case closure under the four algebraic operations) 
and proceed to define an abstract object (in this case a 
field) in terms of those properties. This is, of course, 
standard practice nowadays, but it was revolutionary 
in Dedekind’s time. Dedekind used it again and again, 
as we shall see.
To come back to the domain of algebraic integers 
to which Dedekind’s result was to apply: He defined it 
to be the set R of all elements of Q(a) that are roots of 
monic polynomials with integer coefficients. (All the 
elements of Q(a) are roots of polynomials, not nec­
essarily monic, with integer coefficients.) He showed 
that these elements behave like integers—they are 
closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplica­
tion. They are the integers of the algebraic number 
field Q(a). Dedekind did not, however, motivate this 
basic definition of the domain of algebraic integers, a 
fact lamented by Edwards ([14], p. 332):
Insofar as this is the crucial idea of the theory, 
the genesis of the theory appears, therefore, to 
be lost.
This is not to say, of course, that the notion of 
the domain of algebraic integers cannot be moti­
vated. The algebraic integers of Q(a) are to Q(a) 
what the rational integers (the elements of Z) are 
to Q. Now, the elements of Q can be thought of 
as roots of linear polynomials with integer coeffi­
cients (viz. p(x) = ax + b). Among these, the inte­
gers are the roots of monic linear polynomials (viz. 
q(x)=x + b). Ifwe extend this analysis to polyno­
mials of arbitrary degree over Z, their roots in Q(a) 
yield all of Q(a), while the roots of the monic poly­
nomials among them yield the domain of integers of 
Q(a). Moreover, just as Q is the field of quotients 
of Z, so Q(a) is the field of quotients of its domain 
of integers. (See also [28], pp. 264-265, for a dis­
cussion, from a different perspective, of the issue of 
motivation of algebraic integers.)
Having defined the domain R of algebraic integers 
of Q(a) in which he would formulate and prove his 
result on unique decomposition of ideals, Dedekind 
considered, more generally, sets of integers of Q(a) 
closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplica­
tion. He called them orders. (The domain R of in­
tegers of Q(a) is the largest order.) Here, then, was 
another algebraic first for Dedekind—an essentially 
axiomatic definition of a commutative ring, albeit in 
a concrete setting.
The second fundamental concept of Dedekind’s 
theory, that of ideal, derived its motivation and name 
from Kummer’s ideal numbers. Dedekind wanted to 
characterize them internally, within the domain Dp 
of cyclotomic integers. Thus, for each ideal number 
a, he considered the set of cyclotomic integers divis­
ible by a. These, he noted, are closed under addition 
and subtraction, as well as under multiplication by all 
elements of Dp . Conversely, he proved (and this is a 
difficult theorem) that every set of cyclotomic inte­
gers closed under these operations is precisely the set 
of cyclotomic integers divisible by some ideal number 
t. Thus there is a one-one correspondence between 
ideal numbers and subsets of the cyclotomic inte­
gers closed under the above operations. Such subsets 
of Dp Dedekind called ideals. These subsets, then, 
characterized ideal numbers internally, and served as 
motivation for the introduction of ideals in arbitrary 
domains of algebraic integers.
Dedekind defined them abstractly as follows ([14], 
p. 343:
A subset I of the integers R of an algebraic 
number field K is an ideal of R if it has the 
following two properties:
i. 
if /3,y e I, then p ± y e I.
ii. 
if p e I, ^ e R, then P/i. e I.
Dedekind then defined a prime ideal—perhaps the 
most important notion of commutative algebra—as 
follows: an ideal P of R is prime if its only divisors 
are R and P . Given ideals A and B, A was said 
to divide B if A D B .In later versions of his work 
Dedekind showed that A divides B if, and only if, 
B = AC for some ideal C of R (see [7], p. 122). 
Having defined the notion of prime ideal, Dedekind 
proved his fundamental theorem that every nonzero 
ideal in the ring of integers of an algebraic number 
field is a unique product of prime ideals.
Here is another way of introducing ideals, in the 
spirit of Kronecker’s work on establishing unique 
factorization in domains of algebraic integers. It 
is perhaps best illustrated with an example. Let 
D = {a + ^/5i : a,b e Z}. As we noted, D is not

a UFD. Since uniqueness of factorization in a domain 
is equivalent to the existence of the greatest com­
mon divisor (g.c.d.) of any two non-zero elements in 
the domain ([16], p. 199), it follows that one way to 
re-establish unique factorization in D is to introduce 
g.c.d.s in D. (This is Kronecker’s motivation for the 
introduction of divisors (ideals); see [5], p. 125, or 
[14], p. 353.) How do we introduce the g.c.d. of, say, 
2 and 1 + 75i, which appear in the factorizations of 
6 into primes, 6 = 2 x 3 = (1 + 75i) x (1 — 75i)? 
We look at Z (or any UFD) for guidance.
If a,b Z Z, the g.c.d. of a and b can be found among 
the elements of the set
I = {ax + by : x, y e Z}.
In fact, I is a principal ideal ofZ,
I = (d) = {dm : m Z Z},
and g.c.d.(a, b)=d. (An ideal J ofa ring R is prin­
cipal if it is generated by a single element a e R. 
We write J = (a).) In like manner, if D were a UFD, 
then g.c.d.(2, 1 + 75i) would be found among the 
elements of
P = {2a + (1 + 75i)P : a, p e D}.
Moreover, we would have P = (s') (the principal ideal 
of D generated by some s e D) and
g.c.d.(2, 1 + 75 i) = s.
Since D is not a UFD, there is no s e D such that P = 
(s'). But why not have all of P represent (capture) 
g.c.d.(2, 1 + 75i)? Indeed, this is Kronecker’s idea. 
(Dedekind would have argued for an “ideal element” 
s (s e D) to describe P, so that P would be the set 
of elements in D divisible by s; we exhibit such an s 
below.) We note that P is an ideal ofD, though not a 
principal ideal. Similarly we let
Q = (3, 1 + 75p = {3a + (1 + 75i)P : a, p e D} 
and R = (3, 1 — 75 p
(note that (2, 1 — 75P = (2, 1 + 75P )■
We then easily verify that
P 2 = {2 p PQ = {1 + V5i}, QR = {3 p 
and PR = [1 — 75p,
where we must recall that if A and B are ideals of a 
ring R, their product is the ideal
AB = 
aibi : ai A A, bi B B, a finite sum .
Returning now to the factorizations
6 = 2 x 3 = (1 + 75 i) x (1 — 75 i), 
they yield the following factorizations of ideals:
(6) = (2)(3) = P2(QR) and
{6) = {1 + V5i}{ 1 — V5 p = (PQ)(PR) = P2 QR.
One can readily verify that the ideals P, Q, R are 
prime. Thus the ideal [6) (if not the element 6) has 
been factored uniquely into prime ideals. Paradise 
regained. See [5], [14].
Let us compare this factorization of (6} into prime 
ideals with the factorization of 6 into ideal primes (a 
la Kummer) that we gave earlier: 
6 = 2 x 3 = 72 x 72 x 1+ 75 i 
72
1 — 75 i
72
x
and
6 = (1 + 75 i )(1 -75 i)
= 72 x 1 + 75 i
72
— 75 i 
72
;■ x 1
Performing some eighteenth-century symbolic callis­
thenics, we obtain the following. Since
P 2 = (2 p p 
72
(where “”” stands for “corresponds to”, “captures”, 
“represents”). In fact, P is the ideal consisting of all 
elements of D divisible by the ideal number 72 — 
that is, such that the quotient is an algebraic integer 
([7], p. 235). This would have been Dedekind’s way of 
introducing P (that is, s = 72). We also have PQ = 
[1 + 75p, hence PQ/P ~ (1 + 75i)/72, so that 
the ideal Q corresponds to the ideal number (1 + 
75i)/72. And since PR = {1 — 75P,
PR/R ~ (1 — 75i)/72,
hence R ^ (1 — 75i) /^2 . This removes the mys­
tery associated with our earlier introduction of the 
ideal numbers 72 and (1 ±75i) A/2. (How might 
Dedekind have restored unique factorization to the 
“domain” H = {1, 4, 7, 10, 13,...} we considered 
earlier?)
Dedekind’s legacy
Dedekind’s Supplement X [11] to Dirichlet’s Zahlen- 
theorie was the culmination of70 years of investiga­
tions of problems related to unique factorization. It 
created, in one swoop, anew subject—algebraic num­
ber theory. It introduced, albeit in a concrete setting, 
some of the most fundamental concepts of commu­
tative algebra, such as field, ring, ideal, prime ideal, 

306
Algebra and Number Theory
and module (the last we have not discussed). These 
became basic in algebra and beyond. Supplement X 
also established one of the central results of algebraic 
number theory, namely the representation of ideals 
in domains of integers of algebraic number fields as 
unique products of prime ideals. The theorem was 
soon to play a fundamental role in the study of al­
gebraic curves. It would also serve as a model for 
decomposition results in algebra.
As important as his concepts and results were 
Dedekind’s methods. In fact, “his insistence on philo­
sophical principles was responsible for many of his 
important innovations” ([14], p. 349). One of his 
philosophical principles was a focus on intrinsic, con­
ceptual properties over formulas, calculations, or con­
crete representations. Another was the acceptance of 
nonconstructive procedures (definitions, proofs) as 
legitimate mathematical methods. Dedekind’s great 
concern for teaching also influenced his mathemati­
cal thinking. His two very significant methodological 
innovations were the use of the axiomatic method and 
the institution of set-theoretic modes of thinking. See 
[15], [16].
To illustrate, compare Dedekind’s and Kronecker’s 
definitions of a field. (Recall that these two mathe­
maticians developed essentially the same theory, at 
about the same time, but used entirely different meth­
ods and approaches.) Dedekind defined a field ax- 
iomatically (even ifin a concrete setting), as the set of 
all real or complex numbers satisfying certain prop­
erties. Kronecker did not, in fact, define a field in the 
way we think of a definition. He described it, calling 
it a domain of rationality. It consisted of all rational 
functions in the quantities R, R", R”,... with inte­
ger coefficients, Q (R, R”, R",..., in current nota­
tion). He put no restrictions on these quantities—they 
could be indeterminates or roots of algebraic equa­
tions. In this sense, Kronecker’s field concept is more 
general than Dedekind’s. On the other hand, the el­
ements R, R', R",... had to be given explicitly, 
so that (for example) the field of all algebraic num­
bers would not be considered a domain of rationality, 
whereas it qualified as a field under Dedekind’s def­
inition. Here was a foreshadowing of the formalist- 
intuitionist controversy, to emerge in full force in the 
early decades of the twentieth century.
The axiomatic method was just beginning to sur­
face after 2000 years of near dormancy. Dedekind was 
instrumental in pointing to its mathematical power 
and pedagogical value. In this he inspired (among 
others) David Hilbert and Emmy Noether. His use of 
set-theoretic formulations (recall, for example, his 
definition of an ideal as the set of elements of a 
domain satisfying certain properties), including the 
use of the completed infinite—taboo at the time— 
preceded by about 10 years Cantor’s seminal work on 
the subject. Undeniably, it justifies the description of 
his 1871 memoir as “the ‘birthplace’ of the modern 
set-theoretic approach to the foundations of mathe­
matics” ([15], p. 9). Edwards’s tribute (especially as it 
comes from one who is a great admirer of Kronecker’s 
approach to the subject) is fitting ([14], p. 20):
Dedekind’s legacy ... consisted not only of im­
portant theorems, examples, and concepts, but 
of a whole style of mathematics that has been an 
inspiration to each succeeding generation.
Postscript
What of the three fundamental number-theoretic 
problems that gave rise to the development of alge­
braic number theory? In the 1871 memoir Dedekind 
gave a very satisfactory explanation, in terms of ide­
als, of Gauss’s theory of binary quadratic forms, in 
particular of the composition of such forms. Specifi­
cally, with each quadratic form f(x, y)=ax2 + bxy 
+ cy2 with discriminant D = b2 - 4ac, Dedekind as­
sociated the ideal I of integers of the quadratic field 
Q( VD) generated by a and (-b + VD) /2, that is, 
I = [a, (—b + y/D)/2). He showed that this estab­
lishes a one-one correspondence between quadratic 
forms with discriminant D and ideals of the domain 
of integers of Q(VD), and that under this correspon­
dence composition of forms corresponds to multipli­
cation of ideals (see [1]). Although this result made 
Gauss’s composition of forms transparent, it did not 
end interest in the arithmetic study of binary quadratic 
forms. In particular, the representation of integers 
by specific forms and the determination of the class 
number of forms are problems of current interest. See 
[10].
Various reciprocity laws beyond the biquadratic 
were formulated and proved in the nineteenth century, 
especially by Eisenstein, Kummer, and Hilbert. Kum­
mer’s work relied on his results on unique factoriza­
tion of cyclotomic integers, Hilbert’s initiated class­
field theory (see [10], [18]). But these efforts were not 
entirely satisfactory. In fact, one of Hilbert’s 23 prob­
lems presented at the 1900 International Congress of 
Mathematicians was to find a general reciprocity law. 

KLEINER: The Roots of Commutative Algebra in Algebraic Number Theory
307
Artin solved the problem in the 1920s with his cel­
ebrated reciprocity law—a centerpiece of class-field 
theory. It establishes (in one of its incarnations, and 
roughly speaking) a connection between the Galois 
group of an abelian extension of an algebraic num­
ber field and the arithmetical properties of the ground 
field (see [10]). A far cry from the quadratic, cubic, 
and biquadratic reciprocity laws! See [22], [30].
Having instituted unique factorization in the do­
mains Dp of cyclotomic integers, Kummer proved 
Fermat’s Last Theorem for regular primes. (A prime 
p is regular if it does not divide the class number 
h of Dp ; equivalently, if for any ideal I of Dp ,if 
Ip is a principal ideal then so is I.) He then showed 
that all primes p< 100 (with the exception of 37, 
59, and 67) are regular. Thus Fermat’s Last Theo­
rem was established for all primes p<100 (about 10 
years later Kummer disposed of the three remaining 
cases). Given that Gauss and Dirichlet failed to prove 
Fermat’s theorem even for n =7, this was quite an ac­
complishment. It showed the power of Kummer’s the­
ory of ideal numbers in cyclotomic domains. Much 
progress was made on Fermat’s Last Theorem fol­
lowing Kummer’s work (see [13] and [26]). In 1976, 
through the use of powerful computers along with 
powerful abstract mathematics, Fermat’s Last Theo­
rem was shown to hold for all primes p<125, 000 
(see [26]). In another direction, as a corollary of 
his pioneering work on abelian varieties, Faltings 
showed in 1983 that for each fixed n>2 the equa­
tion xn + yn = zn has at most finitely many solutions 
(See [4], pp. 41-42). Wiles’s very recent proof of Fer­
mat’s Last Theorem has its roots in Taniyama’s 1955 
conjecture about elliptic curves. It took 30 years to 
tie the conjecture to Fermat’s Last Theorem. The high 
point of these developments was Ribet’s 1987 proof 
that a special case of the Taniyama conjecture im­
plies Fermat’s Last Theorem. Wiles devoted the past 
six years to proving this special case of Taniyama’s 
conjecture. See [12], [27].
Emmy Noether used to say modestly of her work 
that it can already be found in Dedekind’s. It would 
not be amiss to say that much of the subject matter of 
this paper originated in, or was inspired by, Gauss’s 
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of 1801. A new subject, 
algebraic number theory, came into being. It em­
bodied fundamental concepts whose consequences 
reached far beyond number theory. Yet some of 
the major number-theoretic problems of that period 
are still with us today, two centuries later. Of course, 
the tools that have been brought to bear on their study 
are recent, and they are powerful. Gauss, Kummer, 
and Dedekind would likely have found them initially 
inscrutable, but in time wondrous. Mathematics is 
alive and well (if any evidence were needed).

Eisenstein’s Misunderstood Geometric Proof 
of the Quadratic Reciprocity Theorem
REINHARD C. LAUBENBACHER AND DAVID J. PENGELLEY
College Mathematics Journal 25 (1994), 29-34
The quadratic reciprocity theorem has played a cen­
tral role in the development of number theory, and 
formed the first deep law governing prime numbers. 
Its numerous proofs from many distinct points of view 
testify to its position at the heart of the subject. The 
theorem was discovered by Euler, and restated by 
Legendre in terms of the symbol now bearing his 
name, but was first proven by Gauss. The eight dif­
ferent proofs Gauss published in the early 1800s, for 
what he called the fundamental theorem, were fol­
lowed by dozens more before the century was over, 
including four given by Gotthold Eisenstein in the 
years 1844-1845. Our aim is to take a new look at 
Eisenstein’s geometric proof, in which he presents a 
particularly beautiful and economical adaptation of 
Gauss’s third proof, and to draw attention to all the 
advantages of his proof over Gauss’s, most of which 
have apparently heretofore been overlooked.
It is hard to imagine today the sensation caused 
by Eisenstein when he burst upon the mathematical 
world. In the autumn of 1843, at age twenty, this self­
taught mathematician had barely received his high 
school certificate and entered the Friedrich-Wilhelms 
University of Berlin, when he produced a flood of 
publications, instantly making him one of the leading 
mathematicians of the early nineteenth century. On 
July 14, 1844, Gauss wrote to C. Gerling:
I have recently made the acquaintance of a 
young mathematician, Eisenstein from Berlin, 
who came here with a letter of recommenda­
tion from Humboldt. This man, who is still very 
young, exhibits very excellent talent, and will 
certainly achieve great things [4].
In 1844 Eisenstein contributed no less than 16 of 
the 27 mathematical articles in Volume 27 of Crelle’s 
Journal, and by his third semester as a student he 
had received an honorary doctorate from Breslau 
[9]. Both Gauss and the great scientist and explorer 
Alexander von Humboldt made great efforts, for the 
most part in vain, to obtain recognition and financial 
security for the impoverished Eisenstein. Gauss wrote 
to Humboldt that Eisenstein’s talent was “that which 
nature bestows upon only a few in each century” [3]. 
He did obtain a position as a Privatdozent (unsalaried 
lecturer) at the University in Berlin, and was even­
tually admitted to the Berlin Academy of Sciences 
in early 1852. But by then his lifelong poor health 
had seriously deteriorated, and later that same year 
he died, aged 29, of tuberculosis. Gotthold Eisenstein 
stands with Abel and Galois as another nineteenth­
century mathematical genius with a tragic and short 
life [3], [9].
Eisenstein’s geometric proof appeared in Crelle’s 
Journal under the title “Geometrischer Beweis des 
Fundamentaltheorems fur die quadratischen Reste” 
[5]. It is intimately connected to Gauss’s third proof 
(published in [6] and translated in [10]). Many expo­
sitions of Eisenstein’s proof, beginning with [1], [2], 
have observed only one of its three geometric aspects, 
and have overlooked the other important differences 
between the two proofs. The result has been a fail­
ure to recognize and fully appreciate all the ways 
in which Eisenstein greatly streamlines and illumi­
nates Gauss’s proof, and thereby reveals its essence. 
For instance, Gauss’s third proof is based on a result 
known as Gauss’s lemma, and Eisenstein was partic­
ularly pleased with a shortcut he found to avoid the 
technicalities involved in applying it:
I did not rest until I freed my geometric proof . . . 
from the Lemma on which it still depended, and

it is now so simple that it can be communicated
in a couple of lines ([7], pp. 173-174).
We believe that the elegance of Eisenstein’s proof 
deserves wide appreciation, and we present it here 
along with a comparison to Gauss’s third proof.
Eisenstein’s proof
To set the stage, we recall a few consequences of 
the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime p 
form a field Zp. Fermat’s little theorem, that bp -1 = 1 
(mod p) for any integer b not divisible by p, holds 
because the non-zero residue classes form a (cyclic) 
group of order p - 1 under multiplication. When p is 
odd, the squaring map x ^ x2 has kernel {-1, 1}, so 
its image, the squares or quadratic residues modulo 
p, form a subgroup of order (p - 1)/2 and the non­
residues form its coset. The quadratic character of 
a residue class b G Zp is specified by the Legendre 
symbol: 
(p) 
1
=-1
if b is a quadratic residue mod p 
if not.
From b(p-1)/2 2= 
1, it follows that b(p-1)/2
= ± 1 for any b G Z*. But if b = c2, then
b(p-1)/2 = 
cp-1= 
1,
so the quadratic residues are all roots of the polyno­
mial x(p-1)/2 - 1. Since this polynomial can have 
no more than (p - 1)/2 roots in the field Zp, we con­
clude that its roots are exactly the quadratic residues. 
That is, we have Euler’s criterion: 
(p) = b(p-1)/2
for any integer b not divisible by p.
The quadratic reciprocity theorem compares the 
quadratic character of two primes with respect to each 
other.
qa. Then it is apparent that the list of numbers (-1)r r 
agrees with the list of numbers a, up to multiples of 
p. For clearly each of the numbers (-1)r r has even 
least positive residue, and if there were duplication 
among these residues, e.g.
(-1) qa qa = (-1)qa' qa1,
then a = ±a'. Since the as are distinct, it follows that 
a + a' = 0, which cannot occur since 0 < a + a' < 
2p and a + a' is even.
Thus,
q (p-1)/2 
a= r (mod p)
and n a = (- 1)E r n r (mod p),
from which it follows that
q(p-1)/2 = (-1) r (mod p).
Recalling Euler’s criterion that 
= q (P - 1) / 2
(mod p),
this produces
(p) = ( - 1)E r, 
(1)
so that one may focus solely on the parity of the 
exponent. Clearly
qa = p 
qpa + r, (2)
where []is the greatest integer function. Since the 
elements a are all even, and p is odd, it follows that 
r = [qa/p] (mod 2), and thus 
Q) = ( - 1G [ qa/p].
(Here Eisenstein remarks that since up to this point 
q need not have been an odd prime, but merely a 
number relatively prime to p, one can easily obtain 
the Erganzungssatz
Quadratic reciprocity theorem. If p and q are dis­
tinct odd primes, then

(2) = (-1)(p2-1)/8
= (-1)(p-1)(q-1)/4
Here is Eisenstein’s proof, closely following both his 
own language and notation (which he conveniently 
and successfully abuses).
Proof : Consider the seta =2, 4, 6, ... ,p- 1. Letr 
denote the remainder (mod p) of an arbitrary multiple 
from the above formula. This we leave as an exercise 
for the reader.)
Eisenstein now uses a geometric representation of 
the exponent in this last equation to transform it twice 
while retaining its parity. This exponent is precisely 
the number of integer lattice points with even abscis­
sas lying in the interior of the triangle ABD in the 
Figure (note that no lattice points lie on the line AB).

LAUBENBACHER AND PENGELLEY: Eisenstein’s Quadratic Reciprocity Theorem
311
Consideranevenabscissaa > p/2. Since the num­
ber of lattice points on each abscissa in the interior of 
the rectangle ADBF is even, the number [qa/p] of 
lattice points on the abscissa below AB has the same 
parity as the number of lattice points above AB . This 
in turn is the same as the number of points lying be­
low AB on the odd abscissa p - a. This one-to-one 
correspondence between even abscissas in triangle 
BHJ and odd abscissas in AHK now implies that 
q[qa/p] = 1 (mod 2), where 1 is the number of 
points inside triangle AHK, and thus
ft)=( - 1’ '■
Reversing the roles of p and q yields
ft)=( - 1’v,
where v is the number of points inside the triangle 
AHL. Since the total number of points inside both 
triangles is simply (p - 1) /2 • (q - 1) /2, one may 
now conclude that
ft) ft) = (-1)v+11
(-1)(p-1)(q-1)/4
Even the normally modest Eisenstein ([7], p. 174) 
could not restrain his pleasure with this proof:
How lucky good Euler would have considered 
himself, had he possessed these lines about sev­
enty years ago.
Eisenstein versus Gauss
Gauss himself considered his third proof to be the 
most direct and natural of his demonstrations. In in­
troducing it he said:
For a whole year this theorem tormented me 
and absorbed my greatest efforts until at last I 
obtained a proof . . . Later I came across three 
other proofs which were built on entirely dif­
ferent principles . . . I do not hesitate to say that 
until now a natural proof has not been produced. 
I leave it to the authorities to judge whether the 
following proof which I have recently been for­
tunate enough to discover deserves this descrip­
tion ([10], p. 113).
While Eisenstein essentially follows the same out­
line as Gauss, each feature of his approach displays 
great clarity and insight, and offers an elegant view 
while shortening the path taken by Gauss.
Gauss’s third proof begins with his lemma, which 
says that
ft) = (- 1’ a • 
(3)
with a obtained as follows: Let
A = 1, 2, ... , p - and
B = p + 1 p + 3
1.
p
Then a is defined to be the number of least positive
residues of the set qA which lie in B.
Instead of using Gauss’s lemma, Eisenstein derives 
equation (1), with the algebraic expression r in the 
exponent, which is then more easily converted into the 
key equation 
= (- 1)£ [(qa)/p ],
(4)
common to both proofs, than is equation (3). While 
Eisenstein’s algebraic exponent is easily transformed 
into the exponent in (4) via (2), Gauss must establish a 
number of technical properties of the greatest integer 
function and apply them to relate a to the exponent in 
(4). Eisenstein’s use of the seta =2, 4, 6, ... ,p- 1, 
as opposed to Gauss’s A, allows him to count the same 
elements as Gauss’s lemma, but via the expression
r , leading quickly to (4):
The main difference between my argument and 
that of Gauss is that I do not divide the numbers 
less than p into those less than p/2 and those 
greater than p/2, but rather into even and odd 
ones [7].
Eisenstein now applies his two clever geometric 
transformations to convert the exponent [qa/p] into 
the number of lattice points in the triangle AHK 
(mod 2). After doing the same for (p/q), yielding 
the number of lattice points in AHL, the proof is 

312
Algebra and Number Theory
completed simply by counting the lattice points in 
the rectangle AKHL. (Most modern expositions of 
Eisenstein’s proof present only this final counting ar­
gument, replacing his two geometric transformations 
by algebra.) Gauss, on the other hand, in essence per­
forms the same two transformations, and counting, 
without availing himself of the geometric presenta­
tion. He actually counts the lattice points using al­
gebraic properties of the greatest integer function. 
This makes the remainder of his proof lengthy and 
non-intuitive, and forces him to consider separate 
cases, depending on the congruence classes ofp andq 
(mod 4). (For a more detailed comparison, see [8].)

Waring’s Problem
CHARLES SMALL
Mathematics Magazine 50 (1977), 12-16
What follows is a non-scholarly survey of the history 
of Waring’s problem. Although a few easy things are 
proved along the way, the paper is mostly concerned 
with telling stories—in other words, quoting many 
beautiful theorems without proof. The proofs, for the 
most part, involve hard-core analysis, and are diffi­
cult. Anyone wishing to pursue the subject should 
examine chapters 20 and 21 of Hardy and Wright 
[4] and then [1] and [2]. Ellison’s paper [2] provides a 
much more scholarly and detailed version of the story, 
with many proofs and an extensive bibliography; the 
present informal version should serve a useful role as 
an introduction to [1] and [2].
Waring’s problem began with Edward Waring, who 
published a book entitled Meditationes Algebraicae 
in 1770, in which, among other things, the following 
remarkable assertion occurs:
Every number is the sum of 4 squares; every 
number is the sum of 9 cubes; every number is 
the sum of 19 biquadrates (4th powers); and so 
on.
(Here, and throughout, number means natural num­
ber, possibly 0.)
The assertion for squares is much older: it is hinted 
at in Diophantus (roughly third century AD) and 
stated explicitly by Bachet in 1621. Fermat claimed 
to have a proof in 1641, but in 1770 when Waring’s 
book appeared, the 4-squares theorem was a well- 
known “fact” for which no proof was known. It was 
proved later in the same year by Lagrange, to the cha­
grin of Euler, who had tried unsuccessfully to find a 
proof.
There have been many other proofs for the 4- 
squares theorem since Lagrange; here’s one that is 
particularly short and sweet. Suppose that we are 
given a number n which we want to write as a sum of 
four squares. Clearly, we can throw out any squares
that divide n: if n = x2 n! and n' = a2 + b2 + c2 + 
d2 then n = (xa)2 + (xb)2 + (xc)2 + (xd)2 . Thus 
we may assume that n = p1 . . .pn is a product of 
distinct primes pi . Then, by the Chinese Remainder 
Theorem, we know that Zn breaks up as the cor­
responding direct product Zp 1 x • • • x Zpn of finite 
fields. Now in each Zpi , -1 is a sum of two squares. 
(In fact it’s easy to prove, more generally, that in any 
finite field every element is a sum of two squares.) 
Thus -1 is a sum of two squares in Zn , so we can 
find integers c, d, m such that -1=c2 + d2 - mn.
Now consider the matrix
A=
- di
c+ di 
m
over Z[ i ], where i = y/—1. Then det A = 1 and 
n> 0. Under these conditions it can be shown (we 
indicate one method in the next paragraph) that 
A = BE* for some 2 x 2 matrix B over Z[i], where 
* denotes conjugate transpose. The upper left entry 
in BB* yields the desired expression for n:
n - = x+yi
yi
wi
In other words, n = x2 + y2 + w2 + z2 ,asumof 
4 squares.
We can be sure that A = BB* for some 2 x 2
complex matrix B for well-known reasons ([3], §72): 
A represents a positive transformation. But we really 
need a matrix B over Z[i]. We can get it by a proof

is due to George Bergman, and it is what makes this 
proof work so nicely.
The assertions for cubes and biquadrates, and the 
implied assertions for higher powers, originate with 
Waring. The first question, no doubt, is what those

Table 1. Waring’s Problem concerns efficient ways of expressing integers as sums of kth powers. When k =2it can 
always be done with four squares (including 0 if necessary); when k =3it requires 9 cubes, when k =4it requires at 
least 19 biquadrates (or fourth powers), and when k =5it requires 37 fifth powers. The sequences 7, 23, 79, 223, ... and 
4, 9, 19, 37, ...form a pattern discovered by Euler: the number of kth powers needed to express the (k - 1)st number in 
the first sequence is given by the corresponding number in the second sequence.

“and so on” (& sic deinceps) mean? One might ob­
serve that 2 • 4 + 1 = 9 and 2 • 9 + 1 = 19 and won­
der if Waring meant to assert that, for each k, every 
number is a sum of s(k) kth powers, where s(k) 
is the appropriate term in the sequence defined by 
s(2) = 4, s(n +1)=2s(n)+1. It turns out, as we 
shall see below, that there is a better candidate for 
such a sequence in which the next term after 19 is 37 
rather than 39. But the most likely interpretation of 
what Waring had in mind is something weaker than 
this.
Let us define g(k) to be the smallest r such that 
every number is the sum of rkth powers, and put 
g(k) = to if no such r exists. Thus, Lagrange’s the­
orem is that g(2) < 4 (and therefore g(2) = 4, since 
7 is not a sum of three squares). In this language, the 
interpretation of Waring’s assertion has usually been:
g(2)=4,g(3)=9,g(4)=19, 
and g(k) < to for all k.
Waring’s problem, then, is to prove that g(k) < to for 
all k, and then to compute g(k).
Of course, the general problem is much harder than 
the case k = 2 considered above. Indeed, it is one of 
those nasty gems, like Fermat’s Last Theorem, which 
begins with a simply-stated assertion about natural 
numbers, and leads quickly into deep water. One dif­
ference between the two is that Fermat’s Last Theorem 
is still a problem whereas Waring’s problem is mostly 
a theorem: Fermat’s conjecture that xn + yn = zn 
has no solution in positive integers when n> 2 re­
mains unproved, while Waring’s problem, at least in 
its original form, is 99% solved. [Editors’ note: This 
paper was written well before Andrew Wiles’s proof 
in the mid-1990s of Fermat’s Last Theorem for all ex­
ponents, while the proof of the finiteness of g(k) for 
all exponents had been accomplished much earlier; 
the determination of the value for all g(k) remains 
tantalizingly incomplete, however.]
To get a feeling for the solution, let’s look for 
numbers that cannot be written as sums of just a 
few kth powers. In other words, we’re looking for 
lower bounds for g(k). (Since we don’t know, a pri­
ori, whether g(k) is finite, it seems prudent to begin 
by seeking lower bounds!) The first obvious choice is 
n =2k - 1; clearly n requires nkth powers; hence 
g (k) > 2k - 1. A trick found by Euler will let us do 
better:
Divide 3k by 2k, writing the result as Euclid taught 
us:
3k = q • 2k + r, 0 < r<2k .
Now consider n = q • 2k — 1. Since n < q • 2k < 3k, 
we can use only 1k and 2k to write n as a sum of kth 
powers; and since n < q • 2k we can use only (q — 1) 
2k s; the difference has to be made up with 1s. Thus
n = (q — 1) • 2k + (2k — 1) • 1k
is a minimal decomposition of n as a sum of 
kth powers; the number of kth powers involved is 
q — 1+2k — 1=q +2k — 2, which we will call 
<j(k). Thus q • 2k — 1 is not the sum of fewer than 
</(k) kth powers, so that g(k) > g(k) for all k.
This result takes on some life if we tabulate (in 
Table 3) some values of g. To do this it is convenient

back to Jacobi suggests that 454 is the largest number re­
quiring eight cubes, and that 8042 is the largest requiring

SMALL: Waring’s Problem

Table 3. Waring’s problem deals with the representation of integers as sums of kth powers. In this table, g(k) is the 
smallest number with the property that every number is the sum of g(k) kth powers. Euler found a simple lower bound 
for g(k), called g(k), given by the formula g(k) = q + 2k — 2, where q = [(3/2)k]. This table indicates that for small 
k = 4 Euler’s bound is in fact the correct value for g(k); that it might be correct for all values of k is a major unsolved 
problem known as the Ideal Waring Theorem. The final line in this table reflects the relative lack of knowledge concerning 
the related number G(k), which is defined as the smallest number such that every sufficiently large number is the sum of 
G(k) kth powers.

to express q as [(3/2)k], and then use g(k) = q + 
2k - 2. Euler’s procedure shows that 7 (= 2 • 22 - 1) 
requires 4 squares, 23 (= 3 • 23 - 1) requires 9 cubes, 
79 (= 5 • 24 - 1) requires 19 biquadrates, .... And 
Euler knew the procedure, in general, by 1772.
The general theorem—that g(k) is finite for all 
k—was proved in 1909 by Hilbert. By that time it 
had been shown that g(3) = 9 (Wieferich, 1909), that 
g(4) < 53 (Liouville, 1859), and that g(k) was finite 
for k =5, 6, 7, 8, and 10.
Hilbert’s proof is extremely complicated. The es­
sential ingredient is a fantastic identity that had been 
conjectured by Hurwitz:
( x 2 +x 2+ ••• + xn)k
M
= 
Xj (a 1 jX 1+ ••• + anjXn ) 
.
j=1
The assertion here is that for each n and k there exist 
positive rational numbers Xj and integers aij, where
1 < i < n, 1 < j < M, and
M = (2k + n)!/(2k)!(n - 1)!, 
making the identity in the indeterminates x1 ,...xn 
true. Hilbert proved the existence of such identi­
ties by estimating huge multiple integrals associated 
with certain convex bodies; in the original paper, a 
25-fold integral is evaluated. The proof has since been 
simplified, but it remains an existence proof for the 
numbers g(k), and sheds no light on their actual value. 
Once Hilbert’s theorem is known, the problem “re­
duces” to computation of g(k). The general question 
was taken up by Hardy and Littlewood, in a long series 
of papers published in the 1920s under the title “On 
Some Problems of Partitio Numerorum” I, II, ..., 
VIII. Partitio Numerorum has since become additive 
number theory, in approximately the same sense that 
analysis situs has become topology. Additive number 
theory is now a vast and flourishing subject, which 
grew from Waring’s problem and generalizations of it. 
Hardy and Littlewood developed a powerful analytic 
method for handling such questions, and they used it 
to give an entirely different proof of Hilbert’s theo­
rem. Their proof was no easier than Hilbert’s, but it 
did offer some hope of leading to actual computation 
of the values of g(k).
The Hardy-Littlewood method was improved in 
many important respects by Vinogradov, and the 
method which evolved from their combined work is 
still a dominant force in additive number theory. The 
Russians call it the Hardy-Littlewood-Vinogradov 
method, but elsewhere it is usually known as the cir­
cle method, because it involves integrating a compli­
cated function around a circle in the complex plane. 
The circle is divided into major arcs and minor arcs 
whose precise identification depends on the particu­
lar aspect of the problem being considered. Because 
the integrand behaves in a complicated way near the 
contour of integration, delicate analysis is required to 
estimate the integrals on those arcs.
The Hardy-Littlewood-Vinogradov method was 
sufficiently refined by about 1935 to allow Dickson to 
determine g(k) for nearly all k. Recall the definition 
of q, r and g(k):
3k = q • 2k + r, 0 < r<2k,
(D1
q=
g(k) = q + 2k - 2.
Let us call k good ifq + r < 2k, and bad otherwise. 
What Dickson showed was this:
If k is good and not equal to 4, then g(k) = #(k). 
If k is bad, then g(k) = g(k) + q' - t, where 
q' = (!)k and t =1 if 2k < qq' + q + q', 
and 0 otherwise.

316
Algebra and Number Theory
(Since 2k < qq' + q + q', t can equal 0 only in 
case 2k = qq + q + q'.) This determines g (k) com­
pletely, except for k =4.
It is, of course, a matter of simple arithmetic to 
determine if a given k is good or not. In particular, 
the reader can check that all k < 9 are good, so that if 
we leave aside k =4we can add g(k) to our previous 
table (see the fourth line of Table 3). A computer study 
in 1964 showed that all k < 200, 000 are good, and a 
difficult theorem due to Mahler (1957) shows that at 
most finitely many k are bad; it is not known whether 
any bad k actually exist. This is certainly a tantalizing 
state of affairs: the conjecture that all k are good is 
a simple-looking assertion about the natural numbers 
that is (except for k =4) equivalent to the so-called 
ideal Waring theorem—namely, the assertion that the 
rather trivial lower bound g( k) found by Euler in 1772 
is actually the correct value ofg(k) for all k.
To be perfectly accurate, we should note that Dick­
son was not the only person involved in the proof 
of this key result. Dickson proved it in 1935 for 
k > 7, aside from a few cases that were filled in dur­
ing the 1940s by various people (including Dickson). 
For k =6 it is due to Pillai (1940), and for k =5 
to Chen (1964). For k =3 and k =2 it is, as we 
have seen, classical and pre-classical, respectively. 
For k =4 Euler’s construction yields, as we have 
seen, 19 = g(4) < g(4). The upper bounds have de­
creased over the years, the best known currently being 
g (4) < 22 (H. E. Thomas, 1974). There is little doubt 
that further computation will show g(4) = 19. It has 
been, since 1940, literally a matter of computation; 
for Auluck proved in that year that all numbers greater 
than
88.39 
c=1010
are sums of 19 biquadrates!
The theorem of Dickson et al. solves Waring’s 
problem in its original form (except for the ambi­
guity about g(4) and the question of whether any 
bad numbers exist). However, there is another aspect 
which opens a whole new range of problems; in fact 
it is an essential part of the method of proof in the 
Hardy-Littlewood-Vinogradov-Dickson solution of 
Waring’s problem.
To describe it, let us go back to the case of 
cubes. Recall that Wieferich, in 1909, had proved that 
g (3) = 9. In the same year, Landau observed that by 
tracing through Wieferich’s arguments very carefully 
it was possible to prove more: only finitely many num­
bers actually required 9 cubes because all sufficiently 
large numbers are sums of 8 cubes. Back in 1851, 
Jacobi had tabulated for us all numbers up to 12000, 
writing each as a sum ofas few cubes as possible. He 
found, in that range, exactly 2 numbers that require 9 
cubes (23 and 239), 15 numbers that require 8 cubes 
(the largest is 454), and 121 that require 7 cubes (the 
three largest are 5306, 5818 and 8042). On the basis 
of the increasingly large gaps between these numbers 
(5306, 5818, 8042, and 12000, where he stopped) Ja­
cobi concluded that it was very likely that all numbers 
greater than 8042 are sums of 6 cubes or fewer. In fact, 
numbers requiring 6 cubes become sparse toward the 
end of Jacobi’s table, and he almost permits himself 
to conjecture that all sufficiently large numbers are 
sums of 5 cubes.
These observations suggest a general definition: let 
G(k) denote the smallest r such that every sufficiently 
large number (i.e., every number with perhaps finitely 
many exceptions) is a sum of rkth powers. Then 
G(k) < g(k) for all k; and G(2) > 4 since 7+8n 
is never a sum of 3 squares for any n (because 7 is 
not a sum of3 squares modulo 8). Therefore G(2) = 
g(2) = 4.
The Hardy-Littlewood-Vinogradov proof leads to 
upper bounds for G(k). If one finds such an upper 
bound, G( k), and if it is less than or equal to the lower 
bound g(k) for g(k), one can use it to compute g(k), 
by extracting from the proof a specific n0 such that all 
n > n0 are sums of GG( k) kth powers. This is in fact 
how g(k ) is determined. For k =4, the appropriate 
n0 was Auluck’s number c; it is now known that every 
number less than 10140 or greater than 101408.3 is a 
sum of 19 biquadrates, but the gap is still too large, 
as yet, to permit complete calculations.
Jacobi’s conjecture for cubes—that G(3) < 6,or 
perhaps even G(3) < 5—remains unproved; the best 
that is known is a theorem of Linnik (1942), accord­
ing to which G(3) < 7. As mentioned above, Landau 
had proved G(3) < 8 in 1909; and Dickson showed in 
1939 that in fact 23 and 239 are the only numbers that 
require 9 cubes. In the other direction, we know that 
G(3) > 4 because of a striking result due to Maillet 
and Hurwitz: G(k) > k +1forall k>1. The proof, 
which is elegant and astonishingly easy, can be found 
in Hardy and Wright ([4], Chapter 21.6). (The spe­
cial case G(3) > 4 can also be proved by working 
modulo 9.)
Only a little more is known about G(k) in the direc­
tion of explicit lower or upper bounds for specific k, 
although there are many asymptotic theorems com­
paring G(k ) with known functions for large k.We 
have mentioned G(2) = 4 and 4 < G(3) < 7. For bi­
quadrates, we can show that G(4) > 16. To begin, we

317
note that 15 requires 15 biquadrates modulo 16, so 
that G(4) > 15. Using this it is easy to show that 
if n requires 16 biquadrates, so does 16n. Since 31 
requires 16 biquadrates, this implies G(4) > 16. In 
fact, Davenport showed in 1939 that G(4) = 16, and 
G(2) and G(4) are the only values of G(k) known 
exactly.
Finally, let us mention briefly some generaliza­
tions. The most obvious, perhaps, is to ask Waring’s 
question in other rings or fields: is every element 
which is a sum of kth powers a sum of gkth powers, 
for some g depending only on k? There is a substantial 
literature on such questions, for example in algebraic 
number fields and their rings of integers; see e.g., [5].
Another possibility is to remain in the natural num­
bers and generalize the question: given an interesting 
subset S of numbers, is every number (respectively, 
every sufficiently large number) a sum of r elements 
of S, for some bound r depending only on S? For 
example, if S is the set of kth powers, the appropriate 
r is g(k) (respectively, G(k)). The question in this 
generality is the province of additive number theory, 
and the literature on it is vast (see, for example, the 
bibliography of [6]: 28 dense pages, single-spaced!).
One interesting choice for S is the set of primes; 
this leads to Goldbach’s problem. Another is the set of 
values of some fixed integer polynomial, more gen­
eral than Xk . We close with a rather special case, 
where there is a particularly striking theorem (quoted 
incorrectly in [2]).
Suppose we have a sequence 2 < n0 < n 1 < 
n2 ... and we ask: is there, for each j , a bound 
r = r(j) with the property that every sufficiently 
large number can be written in the following 
form?
xn 0 + xn 1, + • • • + xn 
xj + xj +1 + 
+ xj + r .
(If all nj = k, the appropriate bound is G(k) - 1.) 
The answer was announced without proof by Frelman 
in 1949, and proved by Scourfield in 1960: such 
bounds rj exist if and only if 1/nj diverges! The 
“only if” is relatively easy; the “if” uses the full 
Hardy-Littlewood-Vinogradov machine.

has held untold fascination for mathematicians, both 
professionals and amateurs alike. The basic theorem 
which we shall discuss in this lecture is known as the 
prime number theorem and allows one to predict, at 
least in gross terms, the way in which the primes are 
distributed. Let x be a positive real number, and let 
n (x) = the number of primes < x. Then the prime 
number theorem asserts that

show that (2) and (3) are equivalent to one another. 
The advantage of the version (3) is that the function
Li(x) = 
x
called the logarithmic integral, provides a much 
closer numerical approximation to n (x) than does 
x/ log x. This is a rather deep fact and we shall return 
to it.
In this article, I should like to explore the history of 
the ideas which led up to the prime number theorem 
and to its proof, which was not supplied until some 
one hundred years after the first conjecture was made. 
The history of the prime number theorem provides a 
beautiful example of the way in which great ideas 
develop and interrelate, feeding upon one another 
ultimately to yield a coherent theory which rather 
completely explains observed phenomena.
The very conception ofa prime number goes back 
to antiquity, although it is not possible to say precisely 
when the concept first was clearly formulated. How­
ever, a number of elementary facts concerning the 
primes were known to the Greeks. Let us cite three 
examples (the first two appearing in Euclid):
(i)

positive integer n can be written as a product of

primes. Moreover, this expression of n is unique 
up to a rearrangement of the factors.
(ii) There exist infinitely many primes.
(iii) The primes may be effectively listed using the 
so-called sieve of Eratosthenes.
We will not comment on (i) or (iii) any further, 
since they are part of the curriculum of most under­
graduate courses in number theory, and hence are 
probably familiar to most of you. However, there is 
a proof of (ii) which is quite different from Euclid’s 
well-known proof and which is very significant to the 
history of the prime number theorem. This proof is 
due to the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler and 
dates from the middle of the eighteenth century. It 
runs as follows:
Assume that p1 , ...,pN is a complete list of all 
primes, and consider the product
n (i - -) = n (1+-+4+•••) • (6) 
i=1 
pi 
i=1 
pi 
pi2
Since every positive integer n can be written uniquely 
as a product of prime powers, every unit fraction 1/n 
appears in the formal expansion of the product (6). For 
example, if n = p1a1 •••paNN , then 1/n occurs from 
multiplying the terms
1/ a1 1/ a2 ••• 1/ aN 
/p1 , /p2 , • • • , /pN •
Therefore, if R is any positive integer,
N 
1 -1 
R
n(*-2 S1 /n (7)
However, as R ^ <x, the sum on the right hand side 
of (7) tends to infinity, which contradicts (7). Thus, 
p1 , • ••,pN cannot be a complete list of all primes.
We should make two comments about Euler’s 
proof: First, it links the Fundamental Theorem of 
Arithmetic with the infinitude of primes. Second, it 
uses an analytic fact, namely the divergence of the 
harmonic series, to conclude an arithmetic result. It 
is this latter feature which became the cornerstone 
upon which much of nineteenth-century number the­
ory was erected.
The first published statement which came close to 
the prime number theorem was due to Legendre in 
1798 [7]. He asserted that n (x) is of the form
x/(A log x + B)
for constants A and B . On the basis of numerical 
work, Legendre refined his conjecture in 1808 [8] by 
asserting that
n (x) =
x
log x + A(x) ,
where A(x) is “approximately 1 •08366 • • • ”. Presum­
ably, by this latter statement, Legendre meant that
lim A (x) = 1 •08366 • 
x—>^>
It is precisely in regard to A(x) where Legendre was 
in error, as we shall see below. In his memoir [9] 
of 1808, Legendre formulated another famous con­
jecture. Let k and l be integers which are relatively 
prime to one another. Then Legendre asserted that 
there exist infinitely many primes of the form l + kn 
(n = 0, 1,2, 3, • • •). In other words, if nk,l (x) denotes 
the number of primes p of the form l + kn for which 
p < x, then Legendre conjectured that
nk,l(x) ^ <x as x ^ <x. 
(8)
Actually, the proof of (8) by Dirichlet in 1837 [1] 
provided several crucial ideas on how to approach 
the prime number theorem.
Although Legendre was the first person to publish a 
conjectural form of the prime number theorem, Gauss 
had already done extensive work on the theory of 
primes in 1792-1793. Evidently Gauss considered 
the tabulation of primes as some sort of pastime and 
amused himself by compiling extensive tables on how 
the primes distribute themselves in various intervals 
of length 1000. We have included some of Gauss’s 
tabulations as appendices. The first table, excerpted 
from ([2], p.436), covers the primes from 1 to 50,000. 
Each entry in the table represents an interval of length 
1000. Thus, for example, there are 168 primes from 
1 to 1000; 135 from 1001 to 2000; 127 from 3001 to 
4000; and so forth. Gauss suspected that the density 
with which primes occurred in the neighborhood of 
the integer n was 1/ log n, so that the number of 
primes in the interval [a, b) should be approximately 
equal to
f6 dx
Ja logx'
In the second set of tables, samples from ([3], pp.442­
443]), Gauss investigates the distribution of primes 
up to 3,000,000 and compares the number of primes 
found with the above integral. The agreement is strik­
ing. For example, between 2,600,000 and 2,700,000, 
Gauss found 6762 primes, whereas

Gauss never published his investigations on the dis­
tribution of primes. Nevertheless, there is little reason 
to doubt Gauss’s claim that he first undertook his work 
in 1792-1793, well before the memoir of Legendre 
was written. Indeed, there are several other known 
examples of results of the first rank which Gauss 
proved, but never communicated to anyone until years 
after the original work had been done. This was the 
case, for example, with the elliptic functions, where 
Gauss preceded Jacobi, and with Riemannian geom­
etry, where Gauss anticipated Riemann. The only in­
formation beyond Gauss’s tables concerning Gauss’s 
work in the distribution of primes is contained in an 
1849 letter to the astronomer Encke. We have in­
cluded a translation of Gauss’s letter.
In his letter Gauss describes his numerical experi­
ments and his conjecture concerning n(x). There are 
a number of remarkable features of Gauss’s letter. 
On the second page of the letter, Gauss compares his 
approximation to n(x), namely Li(x), with Legen­
dre’s formula. The results are tabulated at the top of 
the second page and Gauss’s formula yields a much 
larger numerical error. In a very prescient statement, 
Gauss defends his formula by noting that although 
Legendre’s formula yields a smaller error, the rate of 
increase of Legendre’s error term is much greater than 
his own. We shall see below that Gauss anticipated 
what is known as the Riemann hypothesis. Another 
feature of Gauss’s letter is that he casts doubt on 
Legendre’s assertion about A(x). He asserts that the 
numerical evidence does not support any conjecture 
about the limiting value of A(x).
Gauss’s calculations are awesome to contemplate, 
since they were done long before the days of high­
speed computers. Gauss’s persistence is most impres­
sive. However, Gauss’s tables are not error-free. My 
student, Edward Korn, has checked Gauss’s tables 
using an electronic computer and has found a num­
ber of errors. We include the corrected entries in an 
appendix. In spite of these (remarkably few) errors, 
Gauss’s calculations still provide overwhelming evi­
dence in favor of the prime number theorem. Modern 
students of mathematics should take note of the great 
care with which data was compiled by such giants 
as Gauss. Conjectures in those days were rarely idle 
guesses. They were usually supported by piles of la­
boriously gathered evidence.
The next step toward a proof of the prime number 
theorem was a step in a completely different direction, 
and was taken by Dirichlet in 1837 [1]. In a beautiful 
memoir, Dirichlet proved Legendre’s conjecture (8) 
concerning the infinitude of primes in an arithmetic 
progression. Dirichlet’s work contained two radically 
new ideas, which we should discuss in some detail.
Let Zn denote the ring of residue classes modulo 
n, and let ZX denote the group of units of Zn. Then 
ZX is the so-called group of reduced residue classes 
modulo n and consists of those residue classes con­
taining an element relatively prime to n.Ifk is an 
integer, let us denote by k its residue class modulo 
n. Dirichlet’s first brilliant idea was to introduce the 
characters of the group ZX; that is, the homomor­
phisms of ZX into the multiplicative group Cx of 
non-zero complex numbers. If x is such a character, 
then we may associate with x a function (also denoted 
by x) from the semi-group Z* of non-zero integers as 
follows. Set
x(ak) 
if(a,n)=1
0 
otherwise.
Then it is clear that x : Z* ^ C and has the following 
properties: 
(i) x(a + n) = x(a),
(ii) x(aa') = x(a)x(a'), 
(iii) x(a)=0if (a, n) =1,
(iv) x(1) = 1.
A function x : Z* ^ C satisfying (i)-(iv) is called a 
numerical character modulo n. Dirichlet’s main re­
sult about such numerical characters was the so-called 
orthogonality relations, which assert the following:
x(a) =
a
ifx is identically 1 
otherwise,
(A)
where a runs over a complete system of residues mod­
ulo n;
x(a) =
x
if a = 1 (mod n) 
otherwise,
(B)
where x runs over all numerical characters modulo 
n. Dirichlet’s ideas gave birth to the modern theory 
of duality on locally compact abelian groups.
Dirichlet’s second great idea was to associate to 
each numerical character modulo n and each real 
number s>1, the following infinite series
T ( f 'V x (n)
L(s,x ) = X ~~r-
n=1
(9)
It is clear that the series converges absolutely 
and represents a continuous function for s>1. 
However, a more delicate analysis shows that the 

GOLDSTEIN: A History of the Prime Number Theorem
321
series (9) converges (although not absolutely) for 
s>0 and represents a continuous function of s in 
this semi-infinite interval provided that x is not iden­
tically 1. The function L (s, x) has come to be called 
a Dirichlet L-function.
Note the following facts about L (s, x): First 
L (s, x) has a product formula of the form
L (s,x) = n(1 - Xp)) 
(s> 1), 
(10) 
where the product is taken over all primes p. The proof 
of (10) is very similar to the argument given above 
in Euler’s proof of the infinity of prime numbers. 
Therefore, by (10),
log L (s,x) = - E log(j - xpp))
= -v V X (pm) 
mpms .
p m=1
(11)
Dirichlet’s idea in proving the infinitude of primes 
in the arithmetic progression a, a + n, a + 2 n, • •• , 
(a, n)=1, was to imitate, somehow, Euler’s proof 
of the infinitude of primes, by studying the function 
L (s, x) for s near 1. The basic quantity to consider 
is
x(a)-1 logL(s,x)
x
X (a) 1X (Pm)

V

p m=1 x
= - EE’' E X (a) -1X (Pm), (12)
mpms
where we have used (11). Let a* be an integer such 
that aa* = 1 (mod )n. Then x (a*) = X(a)-1 by 
(i)-(iv). Moreover,
X(a)-1 X (Pm)
X
= E X (a* pm)
X
f ^(n) 
if a*pm = 1 (mod n)
0 otherwise.
However, a*pm = 1(mod n) is equivalent to pm = a 
(mod n). Therefore, by (12) and (13), we have
X(a)-1 logL(s,X)
X
= ^(n) E E (14)

pm =a(mod n) m = 1
Thus, finally, we have

(15)
From (15), we immediately see that in order to prove 
that there are infinitely many primes p = a (mod n), 
it is enough to show that the function
E 1

ps
p = a (mod n)
tends to + to as s approaches 1 from the right. But it 
is fairly easy to see that as s ^ 1+, the sum

remains bounded. Thus, it suffices to show that
-J^- E X(a)- 1log L (s,X) ^ + x (s ^ 1+)■ 
^(n)
However, if X0 denotes the character which is identi­
cally 1, then it is easy to see that
s X0(a) 1 L (s,X0) ^ + TO as s ^ 1 + ■ 
^(n)
Therefore, it is enough to show that if X = X0 , then 
log L (s, x) remains bounded as s ^ 1+. We have 
already mentioned that L (s, X) is continuous for 
s>0 if X = X0. Therefore, it suffices to show that 
L (1, X) =0. And this is precisely what Dirichlet 
showed.
Dirichlet’s theorem on primes in arithmetic pro­
gressions was one of the major achievements of 
nineteenth-century mathematics, because it intro­
duced a fertile new idea into number theory—that 
analytic methods (in this case the study of the Dirich­
let L-series) could be fruitfully applied to arithmetic 

322
Algebra and Number Theory
problems (in this case the problem of primes in arith­
metic progressions). To the novice, such an appli­
cation of analysis to number theory would seem to 
be a waste of time. After all, number theory is the 
study of the discrete, whereas analysis is the study 
of the continuous; and what should one have to do 
with the other? However, Dirichlet’s 1837 paper was 
the beginning of a revolution in number-theoretic 
thought, the substance of which was to apply analysis 
to number theory. At first, undoubtedly, mathemati­
cians were very uncomfortable with Dirichlet’s ideas. 
They regarded them as very clever devices, which 
would eventually be supplanted by completely arith­
metic ideas. For although analysis might be useful in 
proving results about the integers, surely the analytic 
tools were not intrinsic. Rather, they entered the the­
ory of the integers in an inessential way and could be 
eliminated by the use of suitably sophisticated arith­
metic. However, the history of number theory in the 
nineteenth century shows that this idea was eventu­
ally repudiated and the rightful connection between 
analysis and number theory came to be recognized.
The first major progress toward a proof of the 
prime number theorem after Dirichlet was due to the 
Russian mathematician Tchebycheff in two memoirs 
([11], [12]) written in 1851 and 1852. Tchebycheff 
introduced the following two functions of a real vari­
able x: 
E 
p<x
log p,
E
pm <x
log p,
0 (x)
0 ( X )
where p runs over primes and m over positive integers. 
Tchebycheff proved that the prime number theorem 
(1) is equivalent to either of the two statements
lim °x = 1, 
(16)
lim i®. = 1. 
(17)
x i<X X
Moreover, Tchebycheff proved that if 
limxi2(0(x)/x) exists, then its value must be 
1. Furthermore, Tchebycheff proved that
n (x)
0.92129 < liminf / J < 1
r 2 x/ log x
n (x) 
. .
< lim sup—-------- < 1.10555. (18)
xix x/ log x
Tchebycheff’s methods were of an elementary combi­
natorial nature, and as such were not powerful enough 
to prove the prime number theorem.
The first giant strides toward a proof of the prime 
number theorem were taken by B.Riemann in a mem­
oir [9] written in 1860. Riemann followed Dirichlet 
in connecting problems of an arithmetic nature with 
the properties of a function of a continuous variable. 
However, where Dirichlet considered the functions 
L (s, x) as functions of a real variable s, Riemann 
took the decisive step in connecting arithmetic with 
the theory of functions of a complex variable. Rie­
mann introduced the following function:
z (s ) = E -1s, 
ns
n=1
(19)
which has come to be known as the Riemann zeta 
function. It is reasonably easy to see that the series 
(19) converges absolutely and uniformly for s in a 
compact subset of the half-plane (s) > 1. Thus, 
Z (s) is analytic for (s) > 1. Moreover, by using 
the same sort of argument used in Euler’s proof of the 
infinitude of primes, it is easy to prove that
z(s) = n f1 - 4") 
(»(s) > 1), 
(20)
p 
ps
where the product is extended over all primes p. 
Euler’s proof of the infinitude of primes suggests that 
the behavior of z(s) for s =1is somehow connected 
with the distribution of primes. And, indeed, this is 
the case.
Riemann proved that z(s) can be analytically con­
tinued to a function which is meromorphic in the 
whole s-plane. The only singularity of z(s) occurs at 
s =1and the Laurent series about s = 1 looks like
Z (s) = s------1 + a 0 + a 1(s — 1) + • • • . 
(21)
Moreover, if we set
R(s) = s(s - 1)n-s/2r(s/2)Z(s), 
(22) 
then R(s) is an entire function of s and satisfies the 
functional equation
R(s) = R(1 - s). 
(23)
To see the immediate connection between the Rie­
mann zeta function and the distribution of primes, let 
us return to Euler’s proof of the infinitude of primes. 
A variation on the idea of Euler’s proof is as follows. 
Suppose that there were only finitely many primes 
p1 ,...,pN . Then by (20), z(s) would be bounded as 
s tends to 1, which contradicts equation (21). Thus, 
the presence of a pole of z(s) at s = 1 immediately 
implies that there are infinitely many primes. But the 

GOLDSTEIN: A History of the Prime Number Theorem
323
connection between the zeta function and the distri­
bution of primes runs even deeper.
Let us consider the following heuristic argument. 
From equation (20), it is easy to deduce that
then Cauchy’s theorem implies that

(25)
Therefore, assuming that interchange of limit and

to an integer, we have

pm <x

(26)
Thus, we see that there is an intimate connection 
between the function ^ (x) and Z(s). This connection 
was first exploited by Riemann, in his 1860 paper.
Note that the function
xs Z' (s) 
s Z (s)
(27)
has poles at s = 0 and at all zeros p of Z(s). More­
over, note that by equation (20), we see that Z(s) =0 
for K(s) > 1. Therefore, all zeros of Z(s) lie in the 
half-plane (s) < 1. Further, since R (s) is entire and 
Z(s) = 0 for (s) > 1, the functional equation (23) 
implies that the only zeros of Z (s) forwhich K (s) < 0 
are at s = - 2, -4, - 6, - 8, • • •, and these are all sim­
ple zeros and are called the trivial zeros of Z(s). Thus, 
we have shown that all non-trivial zeros of Z(s) lie in 
the strip 0 < (s) < 1. This strip is called the critical 
strip. The residue of (27) at a non-trivial zero p is
xp
.

Thus, if a is a large negative number, and if Ca,T 
denotes the rectangle with vertices a ± iT, 2 ± iT, 
where R(a, T) denotes the sum of the residues of the 
function (27) at the poles inside Ca,T. By letting a and 
T tend to infinity and by applying equations (26) and 
(28), Riemann arrived at the following remarkable 
formula, known as Riemann’s explicit formula
xp
i2 (x) = x - 
—
pp
Z' (0)
Z (0)
- 2 log 1 - x 2 , 
(29)
where p runs over all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann 
zeta function. Riemann’s formula is surprising for at 
least two reasons. First, it connects the function ^ (x), 
which is connected with the distribution of primes, 
with the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta 
function. That there should be any connection at all 
is amazing. But, secondly, the formula (29) explicitly 
puts in evidence a form of the prime number theorem 
by equating ^ (x) with x plus an error term which 
depends on the zeros of the zeta function. If we denote 
this error term by E(x), then we see that the prime 
number theorem is equivalent to the assertion
lim E-) = 0, 
(30)
which, in turn, is equivalent to the assertion
lim1 V xP =0. 
(31)
x iot x p

Riemann was unable to prove (31), but he made a 
number of conjectures concerning the distributions 
of the zeros p from which the statement (31) follows 
immediately. The most famous of Riemann’s con­
jectures is the so-called Riemann hypothesis, which 
asserts that all non-trivial zeros of Z(s) lie on the line 
K(s) = 1, which is the line of symmetry of the func­
tional equation (23). This conjecture has resisted all 
attempts to prove it for more than a century and is 
one of the most celebrated open problems in all of 

324
Algebra and Number Theory
mathematics. However, if the Riemann hypothesis is 
true, then
xp
p
= x 1 / 2 — 
x |p| ’
and from this fact and equation (29), it is possible to 
prove that
t (x )= x + O (x 2+e) 
(32)
for every e > 0, where O(x 2+e) denotes a function 
f (x) such that f (x)/x1+e is bounded for all large x. 
Thus, the Riemann hypothesis implies (31) in a triv­
ial way, and hence the prime number theorem follows 
from the Riemann hypothesis. What is perhaps more 
striking is the fact that if (32) holds then the Riemann 
hypothesis is true. Thus, the prime number theorem 
in the sharp form (32) is equivalent to the Riemann 
hypothesis. We see, therefore, that the connection be­
tween the zeta function and the distribution of primes 
isno accidental affair, but somehow is woven into the 
fabric of nature.
In his memoir, Riemann made many other conjec­
tures. For example, if N (T ) denotes the number of 
non-trivial zeros p of Z(s) such that —T < Im(p) < 
T, then Riemann conjectured that
N (T) = 1- T log T
2 n
— 1 + M2 n) T + O (log T). (33) 
2 n
The formula (33) was first proven by von Mangoldt 
in 1895 [14]. An interesting line of research has been 
involved in obtaining estimates for the number of 
non-trivial zeros p on the line K(s) = 11. Let M(T) 
denote the number of p such that (s) = 2 and 
—T < Im(s) < T. Then Hardy [5] in 1912 proved 
that M(T) tends to infinity as T tends to infinity. 
Later, Hardy [6] improved his argument to prove that 
M (T) >ATlog T, where A is a positive constant, 
not depending on T . The ultimate result of this sort 
was obtained by Atle Selberg in 1943 [10]. He proved 
thatM(T) >ATlogT for some positive constant A. 
In view of equation (33), Selberg’s result shows that 
a positive percentage of the zeros of Z(s) actually 
lie on the line K(s) = 2. This result represents the 
best progress made to date in attempting to prove the 
Riemann hypothesis.
Fortunately, it is not necessary to prove the Rie­
mann hypothesis in order to prove the prime number 
theorem in the form (17). However, it is necessary 
to obtain some information about the distribution of 
the zeros of Z(s). Such information was obtained 
independently by Hadamard [4] and de la Vallee 
Poussin [13] in 1896, thereby providing the first com­
plete proofs of the prime number theorem. Although 
their proofs differ in detail, they both establish the ex­
istence ofa zero-free region for Z(s), the existence of 
which serves as a substitute for the Riemann hypothe­
sis in the reasoning presented above. More specifi­
cally, they proved that there exist constants a, t0 such 
that
Z(a + it) = 0 if ct > 1 — 1 /a log |t|, \t\ > to.
This zero-free region allows one to prove the prime 
number theorem in the form
t(x)= x + O xec(log x)/ 
. 
(34)
Please note, however, that the error term in (34) is 
much larger than the error term predicted by the 
Riemann hypothesis.
Thus, the prime number theorem was finally proved 
after a century of hard work by many of the world’s 
best mathematicians. It is grossly unfair to attribute 
proof of such a theorem to the genius of a single 
individual. For, as we have seen, each step in the 
direction of a proof was conditioned historically by 
the work of preceding generations. On the other hand, 
to deny that there is genius in the work which led up 
to the ultimate proof would be equally unfair. For at 
each step in the chain of discovery, brilliant and fertile 
ideas were discovered, and provided the material out 
of which to fashion the next link.

APPENDIX B: Gauss’s Letter to Encke
My distinguished friend:
Your remarks concerning the frequency of primes were 
of interest to me in more ways than one. You have reminded 
me of my own endeavors in this field which began in the 
very distant past, in 1792 or 1793, after I had acquired 
the Lambert supplements to the logarithmic tables. Even 
before I had begun my more detailed investigations into 
higher arithmetic, one of my first projects was to turn my 
attention to the decreasing frequency of primes, to which 
end I counted the primes in several chiliads [intervals of 
length 1000], and recorded the results on the attached white 
pages. I soon recognized that behind all of its fluctuations, 
this frequency is on the average inversely proportional to 
the logarithm, so that the number of primes below a given 
bound n is approximately equal to
d dn 
l logn,
where the logarithm is understood to be hyperbolic. Later 
on, when I became acquainted with the list in Vega’s tables 
(1796) going up to 400031, I extended my computation 
further, confirming that estimate. In 1811, the appearance 
of Chernau’s cribrum gave me much pleasure and I have 
frequently (since I lack the patience for a continuous count) 
spent an idle quarter of an hour to count another chiliad 
here and there; although I eventually gave it up without 
quite getting through a million. Only some time later did 
I make use of the diligence of Goldschmidt to fill some 
of the remaining gaps in the first million and to continue 
the computation according to Burkhardt’s tables. Thus (for 
many years now) the first three million have been counted 
and checked against the integral. A small excerpt follows: 
(See Table A)
I was not aware that Legendre had also worked on this 
subject; your letter caused me to look in his Theorie des 
Nombres, and in the second edition I found a few pages on 
the subject which I must have previously overlooked (or, by 
now, forgotten). Legendre used the formula
n
log n - A ,
where A is a constant which he sets equal to 1.08366. After 
a hasty computation, I find in the above cases the deviations
-23.3 +42.2 +68.1 +92.8 + 159.1 + 167.6
These differences are even smaller than those from the 
integral, but they seem to grow faster with n so that it is 
quite possible they may surpass them. To make the count 
and the formula agree, one would have to use, respectively, 
instead of A = 1.08366, the following numbers:
1.09040 1.07682 1.07582 1.07529 1.07179 1.07297

217308.5+563.5
It appears that, with increasing n, the (average) value of A 
decreases; however, I dare not conjecture whether the limit 
as n approaches infinity is 1 or a number different from 1. 
I cannot say that there is any justification for expecting a 
very simple limiting value; on the other hand, the excess of 
A over 1 might well be a quantity of the order of 1/ log n. 
I would be inclined to believe that the differential of the 
function must be simpler than the function itself.
If dn/ log n is postulated for the function, Legendre’s 
formula would suggest that the differential function might 
be something of the form dn/(log n - (A - 1)). By the 
way, for large n, your formula could be considered to coin­
cide with
n
log n — (1 / 2 k),
where k is the modulus of Briggs’s logarithms; that is, with 
Legendre’s formula, if we put A = 1/2k = 1.1513.
Finally, I want to remark that I noticed a couple of dis­
agreements between your counts and mine.
Between 59000 and 60000, you have 95, while I have 
94; between 101000 and 102000, you have 94, while 
I have 93.
The first difference possibly results from the fact that, in 
Lambert’s Supplement, the prime 59023 occurs twice. The 
chiliad from 101000-102000 in Lambert’s Supplement is 
virtually crawling with errors; in my copy, I have indicated 
seven numbers which are not primes at all, and supplied 
two missing ones. Would it not be possible to induce young 
Mr. Dase to count the primes in the following (few) mil­
lions, using the tables at the Academy which, I am afraid, 
are not intended for public distribution? In this case, let 
me remark that in the 2nd and 3rd million, the count is, 
according to my instructions, based on a special scheme 
which I myself have employed in counting the first million. 
The counts for each 100000 are indicated on a single page 
in 10 columns, each column belonging to one myriad [an 
interval of length 1000]; an additional column in front (left) 
and another column following it on the right; for example 
here is a vertical column and the two additional columns 
for the interval 10000000 to 11000000 —
As an illustration, take the first vertical column. In the 
myriad 1000000 to 1010000 there are 100 Hecatontades 
[intervals of length 100]; among them one containing a sin­
gle prime, none containing two or three primes; two con­
taining four each; eleven containing 5 each, etc., yielding 
altogether
752 = 1 • 1 + 4 • 2 + 5 • 11 + 6 • 14+-----
primes. The last column contains the totals from the other 
ten. The numbers 14, 15, 16 in the first vertical column are 
superfluous since no hecatontades occur containing that 
many primes; but on the following pages they are needed. 
Finally the 10 pages are again combined into one and thus 
comprise the entire second million.
It is high time to quit—. With most cordial wishes for 
your good health
Yours, as ever,
C. F. Gauss
Gottingen, 24 December 1849.

1 Early work on primes
This year marks the hundredth anniversary of the 
proof of the Prime Number Theorem (PNT), one of 
the most celebrated results in mathematics. The the­
orem is an asymptotic formula for the counting func- 
tionofprimesn(x) := #{p < x : p prime}asserting 
that
x
n (x) ~ ;-----
log x
(PNT)
The twiddle notation is shorthand for the statement
lim
x—>^>
n (x) 
(x/ log x) =1.
Here we shall survey early work on the distribution 
of primes, the proof of the PNT, and some later de­
velopments.
Since the time of Euclid, the primes, 2, 3, 5, 
7, 11, 13,..., have been known to be infinite in num­
ber. They appear to be distributed quite irregularly, 
and early attempts to find a closed formula for the 
nth prime were unsuccessful. By the end of the eigh­
teenth century many mathematical tables had been 
computed, and examination of tables of prime num­
bers led C. F. Gauss and A. M. Legendre to change 
the question under investigation. Instead of seeking 
an exact formula for the nth prime, they considered 
the counting function n (x) and asked for approxima­
tions to this function, evidently a new kind of question 
in number theory. Each of the two men conjectured 
the PNT, though neither did so in the form we have 
given. In 1808 Legendre published the formula
n (x) = x/(log x + A (x)),
where A(x)tends to a constant as x ^ <x.
Gauss recorded his conjecture in one of his favorite 
books of tables around 1792 or 1793 but first dis­
closed it, in a mathematical letter, over fifty years 
later. He actually found a better approximation for 
n (x) in terms of the logarithmic integral function, 
defined for x > 0 by
li(x) := lim [ f + ! 
dt.
£—0+ Uo 
J++U logt
It is easy to show that li(x) ~ xf log x, so either ex­
pression can be used in the asymptotic formula for 
n(x). It has been shown that li(x) is a more accurate 
estimate of n(x) than either x/ log x or Legendre’s 
proposed formula, so today li(x) is used in PNT error 
estimates. For more details about Gauss’s meditations 
on the PNT, see [10], included in this volume.
The function that we now call the Riemann zeta 
function, which was to play a decisive role in the 
proof of the PNT, was introduced by L. Euler in the 
eighteenth century. For s real and s>1, define

Using the unique factorization of positive integers, 
Euler proved that

where the product extends over all primes p. Further, 
he gave another proof of the infinitude of the primes 
by observing that if the number of primes were finite, 
then the product for Z(1) would converge, while in 
fact the sum for Z at s =1 is the harmonic series, 
which diverges. Euler’s proof shows further that the

primes are sufficiently numerous that the sum of their 
reciprocals diverges.
Legendre conjectured and incorrectly believed he 
had proved that there are an infinite number of primes 
in each arithmetic progression for which the first term 
and common difference are relatively prime. This 
theorem was established by P. L. Dirichlet in 1837 
by greatly extending the method of Euler described 
above. In two papers, Dirichlet introduced characters 
(periodic completely multiplicative arithmetic func­
tions) to select the elements of an arithmetic progres­
sion; he generalized the Z function by multiplying 
terms of the series for Z by characters to make what 
we today call Dirichlet L functions; he related the 
value of an L function L (1, x) with the class num­
ber of quadratic forms of a given discriminant, and 
from the positivity of the class number he deduced his 
key lemma that each of the L functions is non-zero 
at the point s =1. The subject of analytic number 
theory is generally considered to have begun with 
Dirichlet.
The first person to establish the true order of n (x) 
was P. L. Chebyshev. In the middle of the nineteenth 
century he found an ingenious elementary method to 
estimate n (x) and established the bounds 
P. L. Chebyshev (1821-1894)
0.921x 
log x
1.106x 
log x
< n (x) <
for all sufficiently large values of x. Chebyshev’s work 
was based on the use of the arithmetic identity
^A( d) = log n, 
d|n
where von Mangoldt’s function A is a weighted 
prime and prime-power counting function defined by 
A(d) = log p if d = pa for some prime p and positive 
integer a and A(d) = 0 otherwise. Chebyshev’s for­
mula is the arithmetic equivalent of the zeta function 
identity {-<'(s)/Z(s)} • Z(s) = -Z'(s). Chebyshev 
showed also that if n (x) / (x/ log x) had a limit as 
x ^ to , then its value would be 1. Attempts at im­
proving Chebyshev’s methods led to slightly sharper 
estimates and much more elaborate calculations, but 
the PNT was not to be established by an elementary 
method for another hundred years.
A few years after the appearance of Chebyshev’s 
paper, a path to the proof of the PNT was laid out by 
G. F. B. Riemann ([9], [14]) in his only published pa­
per on number theory. Riemann’s revolutionary idea 
was to consider Z as a function of a complex vari­
able and express n (x) in terms of a complex integral 
involving Z . By formally deforming the integration 
contour, Riemann achieved an explicit formula for 
n (x) as an infinite series whose leading term was 
li(x) and that involved the zeros of Z(s). However, 
there was not enough analysis available at that time 
to rigorously deduce the PNT following Riemann’s 
program. It was not until the end of the nineteenth 
century that the missing essential ingredient was sup­
plied: this was the theory of entire functions of finite 
order, which was developed by J. Hadamard for the 
purpose of proving the PNT.
Riemann proved that the Z function has an analytic 
continuation to C with just one singularity, a simple 
pole with residue 1 at the point s =1, and that Z sat­
isfies a functional equation connecting its values at 
complex arguments s and 1 - s. Incidentally, we owe 
to Riemann the unusual notation for a complex num­
ber s = a + it that has become standard in analytic 
number theory. Riemann recognized the key role that 
zeros of the Z function play in prime number theory. 
He conjectured several properties of these zeros, all

but one of which were proved around the end of the 
nineteenth century by Hadamard and H. von Man- 
goldt. The one conjecture that remains to this day, 
and is generally considered to be the most famous 
unsolved problem in mathematics, is the so-called 
Riemann hypothesis:
All non-real zeros of the Z function have real part 1. 
(RH)
Riemann evidently perceived the greater difficulty of 
the RH, for while he stated his other conjectures with 
no qualification, he prefaced the statement of the RH 
with the phrase “it is very likely that [es ist sehr 
wahrscheinlich dass].....”
Activity in prime number theory increased to­
ward the end of the nineteenth century. The term 
Prime Number Theorem appears to have originated 
at this time in the Gottingen dissertation of H. von 
Schaper, Uber die TheoriederHadamardschenFunk- 
tionen und ihre Anwendung auf das Problem der 
Primzahlen, 1898. There were several false starts be­
fore correct proofs of the PNT were given. For ex­
ample, in 1885 Stieltjes [18] claimed to have proved 
the RH. With this result one could establish the PNT 
with an essentially optimal error term
n (x) — li( x )= O (x 2+£). 
(1)
Here we have used the notation f (x) = O(g(x)), 
where g is a positive function for all x from some point 
onward, if |f (x)|/g(x) < B holds for some positive 
constant B and all sufficiently large positive values 
of x. The deduction of (1) under the assumption of 
the RH was later carried out by von Koch. Stieltjes 
died in 1894 without having either substantiated or 
retracted his claim of having proved the RH.
First proofs of the prime number 
theorem
The PNT was established in 1896 by Jacques 
Hadamard and by Charles-Jean de la Vallee Poussin. 
It was the first major achievement for each at the 
start of long and distinguished careers. Hadamard 
was born at Versailles, France, in 1865. After studies 
at the Ecole Normale Superieure he obtained his doc­
torate in 1892. He spent most of his career in Paris, 
working principally in complex function theory, par­
tial differential equations, and differential geometry. 
He died in 1963, within two months of his 98th birth­
day. De la Vallee Poussin was born in 1866 in Louvain, 
Belgium, where his father was a professor of miner­
alogy and geology at the University. After studying at 
Louvain, he too joined the faculty of the University, 
at the age of 26, as Professor of Mathematics. His 
elegant and lucid Cours d’Analyse has educated gen­
erations of mathematicians in the methods of Borel 
and Lebesgue. De la Vallee Poussin died in 1962, in 
his 96th year.
The arguments of both Hadamard and de la Vallee 
Poussin followed the scheme laid out by Riemann. 
Both papers made essential use of Riemann’s func­
tional equation for the zeta function, several other 
properties of Z conjectured by Riemann and estab­
lished by Hadamard, and Hadamard’s new theory of 
entire functions.
Hadamard’s paper on the PNT [11] consists of two 
parts. Here are the opening paragraphs of Part I, On 
the distribution of zeros of the zeta function (in our 
translation). It is interesting to see how he treats Stielt­
jes’s claim.

BATEMAN AND DIAMOND: A Hundred Years of Prime Numbers
331
J. Hadamard (1865-1963)
The Riemann zeta function is defined, when the 
real part of s is greater than 1, by the formula
log Z (S ) = - log (1 - 1 /ps), 
(2)
p
where p runs over the prime numbers [Transla­
tors’ remark: Use the principal branch for the 
logarithms on the right side of (2).] It is holo­
morphic in the entire plane, except at the point 
s = 1, which is a simple pole. It does not van­
ish for any value of s with real part greater than 
1, since the right-hand side of (2) is finite. But 
it admits an infinity of complex zeros with real 
part between 0 and 1. Stieltjes proved, in accor­
dance with Riemann’s expectations, that these 
zeros are all of the form 1 + it (where t is real); 
but his proof has never been published, and it 
has not even been established that the function 
Z has no zeros on the line ^s = 1.
It is this last assertion that I propose to prove 
here.
Hadamard’s proof that Z =0on the line
L{a = 1} := {s e C : ^s = 1}
used formula (2) for log Z (s), where s = a + it with 
a > 1 and t real, and the representation
co
-^ log 1 - p-s = 
—
mpms
m=1
y° cos (mt log p)
m=1
mp
Thus
logIZ(s)|=EE 
.^. 
. 
(3)
p m=1
In the analysis of Z, one can ignore the contribution 
of the higher prime powers, because that part of the 
series is uniformly bounded for a>1, while the sum 
over just the primes in (3) is not. Hadamard observed 
first that, because of the simple pole ofZ at s =1, 
y p-a ~ log Z(-) ~ log -—-y (a ^ 1+). (4)
p
He next noted that if 1+it0 were a zero ofZ, neces­
sarily simple, then it would follow that 
y p-a cos (to logp)----log -—1 (a ^ 1+).
p
(5)
Comparing (4) and (5), he concluded in succession 
that
(a) cos (10 log p) & — 1 for most primes p;
(b) hence cos (210 log p) & +1 for most primes p;
(c) finally 1+2it0 would be a pole of Z, contradict­
ing the fact that Z has no singularities in C other 
than at s =1.
We have omitted some details that Hadamard gave 
to make this argument complete; they can be found 
also in Chapter 3 of [19]. Today it is customary to 
use a cleaner method, due to F. Mertens, that com­
bines formula (3) with a trigonometric inequality to 
get an inequality that expresses Hadamard’s idea. For 
example, the choice
3 + 4 cos B + cos 2B > 0
yields
Z(s)3|Z(a+it)|4|Z(a+2it)|>1(a>1).

332
Algebra and Number Theory
Part II of Hadamard’s 1896 paper, “Arithmetic 
Consequences”, contains his deduction of the PNT. It 
begins with the following modest words:
As one can see, we are quite far from having 
proved the assertion of Riemann-Stieltjes; we 
have not even been able to exclude the hypothe­
sis of an infinity of zeros of Z (s) approaching ar­
bitrarily close to the limiting line ^s = 1. How­
ever, the result which we have obtained suffices 
by itself to prove the principal arithmetic conse­
quences which people have, up to now, sought 
to deduce from the properties of Z(s).
Ch. J. de la Vallee Poussin (1866-1962)
Here are the main ingredients in Hadamard’s de­
duction of the PNT. He first established the following 
“smoothed” form of the Mellin inversion formula,
1 
22 + i° xs
^g log(x/n^2-i 
s2
n<x 
2 ^i 2 —i o s 
oV ands, 
ns
n=1
valid for x positive and an n—s a Dirichlet se­
ries that is absolutely convergent for ^s > 1. The 
arithmetic function to which he applied the formula 
was the von Mangoldt function A( n) that appeared 
in Chebyshev’s work. The associated Dirichlet series 
satisfies the zeta function formula
oo£a( n) n—s = -z ' (s)/z (s), 
n=1
which is shown by differentiating formula (2) for 
log Z (s). Using the Weierstrass-Hadamard product 
representation for (s - 1)Z(s), the convergence of 
P \p\ — 2 (where p runs over the non-real zeros of 
Z), and a contour deformation and estimation of the 
above Mellin integral, Hadamard deduced that
E A(n) log(x/n) - x. 
n <x
From this relation the PNT follows quite easily.
Like Hadamard, de la Vallee Poussin [6] began his 
proof by establishing that Z has no zeros with real 
part 1 (by a rather more complicated argument than 
that of Hadamard). He also used a smoothed form of 
the Mellin inversion formula, but with an expression 
xs/(s — p)(s — v) in place of xs/s2. In 1899, de la 
Vallee Poussin published another article in which he 
obtained the PNT with an error estimate
n(x) — li(x) = O (x exp {—c loga x}), (6) 
where a = 2 and c is some positive constant. In the 
last paper he made use of Mertens’ trigonometric 
inequality. A quarter of a century went by before de 
la Vallee Poussin’s error bound was improved.
We note that the estimate (6) with a fixed positive 
value of a is superior to any estimate of the form
n(x) — li(x) = O(x/ logk x)
with fixed k>0. The RH implies that (6) holds with 
a = 1 ,c = 2- — e, as stated in (1).
Later developments
In just over a decade after the proof of the PNT, prime 
number theory moved from obscurity to mainstream. 
So little was known on the subject in England at the 
turn of the century that J. E. Littlewood was assigned 
the task of proving the RHby E. W. Barnes, his Cam­
bridge research supervisor, and at one point, accord­
ing to G. H. Hardy, it was believed that the RH had 
been proved. The publication of E. Landau’s Hand- 
buch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen 
[14] in 1909 quickly changed the status of the subject. 
Landau’s book presented in accessible form nearly ev­
erything that was then known about the distribution 
of primes. Incidentally, the O notation we use was 
popularized by Landau.

In addition to writing about prime number theory, 
Landau made significant contributions to the subject, 
including the simplification of some of the main ar­
guments and extension of the results. For example, he 
was the first to prove the PNT without making use of 
the functional equation of Z. His idea was to combine 
an analytic continuation of the zeta function a bit to 
the left of L{a = 1}, e.g., via
Z(s)------^j- = s ( 
[x],+1 x dx, 
^s > 0,
s - 1 
1 
xs +1
with an upper bound for the logarithmic derivative of 
the zeta function in a suitable zero-free region. With 
the aid of his new methods, Landau was able to treat 
some related problems, such as estimating the num­
ber of prime ideals of norm at most x in the ring of 
integers of an arbitrary algebraic number field (Sec­
tion 242 of [14]). This result solved part of the eighth 
problem posed in Hilbert’s famous 1900 address to 
the International Congress of Mathematicians.
It had long been noted, possibly already by Gauss, 
that
n(x) — li(x) < 0 
(7)
for x =2, 3,... to whatever point it was checked. In 
addition to this empirical evidence, theoretical sup­
port for the conjecture that (7) holds for all x > 2 was 
provided by Riemann, who observed that his formula 
for n (x) begins with the terms li(x) — li Ui) / 2. 
However, this conjecture was disproved by Little­
wood [12], who used almost periodic functions and 
diophantine ideas to show that in fact the difference 
changes sign infinitely often. Littlewood’s proof did 
not provide an estimate of where the first change of 
sign might be, and this question attracted further at­
tention. The suggestion was raised that the question 
might be undecidable. However, it was proved by S. 
Skewes that there is a number
x<exp exp exp exp 7.705
E. Landau (1877-1938)
for which (7) does not hold. Skewes’s number, which 
is among the largest that have occurred in mathe­
matics, has subsequently been replaced by a more 
modest number with fewer than 400 decimal digits. 
There is a moral here: vast amounts of empirical ev­
idence, together with a “philosophical” explanation 
for a mathematical phenomenon, are not the same as 
a proof.
What is the relation between the PNT and the non­
vanishing of the Riemann zeta function on L{a = 
1}? It is quite easy to see that the PNT implies that Z 
has no zeros on the line. Proofs of the PNT were given 
first by Landau ([14], Section 241) and then by Hardy 
and Littlewood that used, besides the non-vanishing 
of Z on L{a = 1}, only very weak growth conditions 
for Z(& + it) for a > 1 and |t| ^ <x. The question 
arose whether the PNT could be proved using just 
the fact that Z has no zeros on L{a =1}. This was 
answered affirmatively around 1930 by work of N. 
Wiener using Fourier analysis. Wiener created an ap­
proximate integral formula for n (x) involving a com­
pactly supported smoothing function. The following 
tauberian theorem [4] provides one of the most direct 
proofs now known for the PNT.

decreasing real-valued function on [1, ex) such that

weaker hypothesis on the behavior of the function g 
near L{a = 1} can be used in the proof of Beurling’s 
theorem.
Generalized prime number theory has several ap­
plications, and it has raised interesting new problems. 
For example, Landau’s prime ideal theorem is easily 
deduced from Beurling’s result. Also, there are gener­
alized prime models for which the counting function 
of generalized integers is quite close to that of the 
usual integers, but for which the analogue of the RH 
is false. This means that a successful proof of the RH 
will require more than just the facts that the positive 
integers are a multiplicative semigroup and that the 
counting function of positive integers [x] is close to 
x; presumably, the additive structure of the integers 
must be taken into account. More on this topic can be 
found in the authors’ survey article [2].
Many different proofs have been given for the PNT. 
A very concise argument that uses only the analytic­
ity and non-vanishing of (s - 1) Z(s) on the closed 
half plane {s : Ks > 1} was found by D. J. New­
man [15]. In place of the Wiener-Ikehara theorem or 
an application of the Mellin inversion integral, New­
man’s method uses basic complex function theory to
for each real a > 1. Suppose further that
f f (u)us1 du =--------+ g(s), 
Ks > 1,
1 
s-1
where a e R and g is the restriction to {s : Ks > 1} 
of a continuous function on the closed half plane 
{s : ffis > 1}. Then
lim u-1f(u) = a. 
u —>^>
In 1937 A. Beurling introduced an abstraction of 
prime number theory in which multiplicative struc­
ture was preserved but the additive structure of the 
integers was dropped. A sequence of real numbers 
pi < p2 < p3 < • • •, called generalized primes, was 
introduced, and the free abelian semigroup generated 
from them under multiplication was called the as­
sociated sequence of generalized integers. From the 
assumption that the counting function of the general­
ized integers satisfies the condition
I(x) = Ax + O x log-Y x , y> ~,
an analogue of the PNT was established. Moreover, 
the condition that y > 2 was shown to be best pos­
sible. A form of the Wiener-Ikehara theorem with a

estimate the integral

J si 
R 2 \ L=1 nS
over a finite contour for large values of R. Some 
other interesting proofs of the PNT include that of H. 
Daboussi, which uses elements of sieve theory, and a 
method of A. Hildebrand based on the large sieve.
De la Vallee Poussin’s PNT error term was im­
proved by Littlewood, who used exponential sum 
methods to find bounds for Dirichlet series. These es­
timates led to enlarged regions on which the zeta func­
tion is guaranteed to be non-zero and consequently to 
better PNT estimates. The method was developed and 
improved by the school of I. M. Vinogradov, leading 
to the bound in which (6) holds with a = 5 — e.
The failure of the Chebyshev methods and the suc­
cess of Riemann’s program in proving the PNT led 
to the opinion, voiced by Hardy and others, that the 
PNT could be proved only with the use of the Rie­
mann zeta function. This belief was strengthened by 
Wiener’s proof of the equivalence of the PNT and the 
non-vanishing of Z on L{& = 1}. Inspired by work in 
sieve theory, A. Selberg developed a kind of weighted 
analogue of Chebyshev’s identity. With this formula 
and an argument of P. Erdos he succeeded in giv­
ing an “elementary” proof of the PNT. Subsequently, 
Selberg and Erdos each discovered an independent 
proof. Their arguments are considered elementary in 
the sense that they do not involve the zeta function, 
complex analysis, or Fourier methods; however, the 
methods are quite intricate. Subsequently, elementary 
estimates were sought for the PNT error term, and by 
use of higher-order analogues of Selberg’s formula 
and more elaborate tauberian arguments, error terms 
of type (6) with a =6 e were achieved. For a survey 
of the use of elementary methods in prime number 
theory, see [7].
We conclude with a summary of what is now known 
about the truth of the RH. If the RH is false and 
has even a single non-real zero off the critical line 
{s e C : Ks =2 }, there would be consequences for 
prime number theory, such as in the quality of the PNT 
error term. The numerical evidence in support of the 
RH is very great—by comparing the sign changes of 
a real-valued equivalent of Z(1 + it) with the zeros 
predicted by use of the argument principle, van de 
Lune, te Riele, and Winter showed that the first one 
and a half billion (!) non-real zeros of zeta lie on the 
critical line and are simple. In the 1920s, Littlewood 
showed that almost all the non-real zeros lie in any 
given strip of positive width that contains the critical 
line. Hardy proved that there were infinitely many 
zeros of zeta on the critical line, and later Selberg 
showed that a positive proportion of the non-real zeros 
were on the line. Near the end of his life, N. Levinson 
introduced an efficient zero counting method, which 
B. Conrey has developed to show that more than 5 
of the non-real zeta zeros are simple and lie on the 
critical line.
Sources
The theory of the distribution of prime numbers is a 
rich and fascinating topic. In this survey we have had 
to treat fleetingly or omit entirely many interesting 
topics. Also, it was not feasible to list the sources 
for all the facts cited. The following books and arti­
cles discuss further topics and provide references to 
original sources.
Landau’s Handbuch [14] remains an excellent in­
troduction to prime number theory and is a reference 
for virtually all early results in the area. The sec­
ond edition of the Handbuch, edited by the first au­
thor, contains information on work up to about 1950 
on the distribution of primes. The books of Chan- 
drasekharan [4], [5], Ingham [12], and Ellison and 
Mendes-France [8] provide very readable introduc­
tions to the subject. Titchmarsh and Heath-Brown 
[19] and Ivie [13] are standard references on the Rie­
mann zeta function, and Edwards [9] provides a his­
torical view of this subject. There are detailed and 
authoritative encyclopedia articles on prime number 
theory by Hadamard [1] and by Bohr and Crameer 
[3]. The recent survey article ofW. Schwarz [17] de­
scribes the development of prime number theory in 
the twentieth century, including several topics that we 
have not treated. Finally, Ribenboim [16] provides a 
kind of Guinness record book about primes and in­
cludes extensive references.

The Indian Mathematician Ramanujan
G. H. HARDY
American Mathematical Monthly 44 (1937), 137-155
I have set myself a task in these lectures which is 
genuinely difficult and which, if I were determined 
to begin by making every excuse for failure, I might 
represent as almost impossible. I have to form myself, 
as I have never really formed before, and to try to help 
you to form, some sort of reasoned estimate of the 
most romantic figure in the recent history of mathe­
matics; a man whose career seems full of paradoxes 
and contradictions, who defies almost all the canons 
by which we are accustomed to judge one another, 
and about whom all of us will probably agree in one 
judgment only, that he was in some sense a very great 
mathematician.
The difficulties in judging Ramanujan are obvious 
and formidable enough. Ramanujan was an Indian, 
and I suppose that it is always a little difficult for an 
Englishman and an Indian to understand one another 
properly. He was, at the best, a half-educated Indian; 
he never had the advantages, such as they are, of an 
orthodox Indian training; he never was able to pass 
the First Arts Examination of an Indian university, and 
never could rise even to be a “Failed B.A.” He worked, 
for most of his life, in practically complete ignorance 
of modern European mathematics, and died when he 
was a little over 30 and when his mathematical edu­
cation had in some ways hardly begun. He published 
abundantly—his published papers make a volume of 
nearly 400 pages—but he also left a mass of unpub­
lished work which had never been analysed properly 
until the last few years. This work includes a great deal 
that is new, but much more that is rediscovery, and 
often imperfect rediscovery; and it is sometimes still 
impossible to distinguish between what he must have 
rediscovered and what he may somehow have learnt. I 
cannot imagine anybody saying with any confidence, 
even now, just how great a mathematician he was and 
still less how great a mathematician he might have 
been.
These are genuine difficulties, but I think that we 
shall find some of them less formidable than they 
look, and the difficulty which is the greatest for me 
has nothing to do with the obvious paradoxes of Ra­
manujan’s career. The real difficulty for me is that Ra­
manujan was, in a way, my discovery. I did not invent 
him—like other great men, he invented himself—but 
I was the first really competent person who had the 
chance to see some of his work, and I can still re­
member with satisfaction that I could recognise at 
once what a treasure I had found. And I suppose that 
I still know more of Ramanujan than any one else, and 
am still the first authority on this particular subject. 
There are other people in England, Professor Watson 
in particular, and Professor Mordell, who know parts 
of his work very much better than I do, but neither 
Watson nor Mordell knew Ramanujan himself as I 
did. I saw him and talked with him almost every day 
for several years, and above all I actually collabo­
rated with him. I owe more to him than to any one 
else in the world with one exception, and my associa­
tion with him is the one romantic incident in my life. 
The difficulty for me then is not that I do not know 
enough about him, but that I know and feel too much 
and that I simply cannot be impartial.
I rely, for the facts of Ramanujan’s life, on Se- 
shu Aiyar and Ramachaundra Rao, whose memoir of 
Ramanujan is printed, along with my own, in his Col­
lected Papers [3]. He was born in 1887 in a Brahmin 
family at Erode near Kumbakonam, a fair-sized town 
in the Tanjore district of the Presidency of Madras. 
His father was a clerk in a cloth-merchant’s office in 
Kumbakonam, and all his relatives, though of high 
caste, were very poor.
He was sent at 7 to the High School of Kum- 
bakonam, and remained there nine years. His excep­
tional abilities had begun to show themselves before 
he was 10, and by the time that he was 12 or 13 he 
337

was recognised as a quite abnormal boy. His biog­
raphers tell some curious stories of his early years. 
They say for example that, soon after he had begun 
the study of trigonometry, he discovered for himself 
“Euler’s theorems for the sine and cosine” (by which I 
understand the relations between the circular and ex­
ponential functions), and was very disappointed when 
he found later, apparently from the second volume of 
Loney’s Trigonometry, that they were known already. 
Until he was 16 he had never seen a mathematical 
book of any higher class. Whittaker’s Modern Analy­
sis had not yet spread so far, and Bromwich’s Infinite 
Series did not exist. There can be no doubt that either 
of these books would have made a tremendous differ­
ence to him if they could have come his way. It was a 
book of a very different kind, Carr’s Synopsis, which 
first aroused Ramanujan’s full powers.
George Shoobridge Carr was formerly Scholar of 
Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; his book (A 
Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied 
Mathematics [2]) is almost unprocurable now. There 
is a copy in the Cambridge University Library, and 
there happened to be one in the library of the Govern­
ment College of Kumbakonam, which was borrowed 
for Ramanujan by a friend. The book is not in any 
sense a great one, but Ramanujan has made it fa­
mous, and there is no doubt that it influenced him 
profoundly and that his acquaintance with it marked 
the real starting point of his career. Such a book must 
have had its qualities, and Carr’s, if not a book of any 
high distinction, is no mere third-rate textbook, but a 
book written with some real scholarship and enthusi­
asm and with a style and individuality of its own. Carr 
himself was a private coach in London, who came to 
Cambridge as an undergraduate when he was nearly 
40, and was 12th Senior Optime in the Mathematical 
Tripos of 1880 (the same year in which he published 
the first volume of his book). He is now completely 
forgotten, even in his own college, except in so far as 
Ramanujan has kept his name alive; but he must have 
been in some ways rather a remarkable man.
I suppose that the book is substantially a summary 
of Carr’s coaching notes. If you were a pupil of Carr, 
you worked through the appropriate sections of the 
Synopsis. It covers roughly the subjects of Schedule 
A of the present Tripos (as these subjects were under­
stood in Cambridge in 1880), and is effectively the 
“synopsis” it professes to be. It contains the enun­
ciations of 6165 theorems, systematically and quite 
scientifically arranged, with proofs which are often 
little more than cross-references and are decidedly 
the least interesting part of the book. All this is 
exaggerated in Ramanujan’s famous note-books 
(which contain practically no proofs at all), and any 
student of the note-books can see that Ramanujan’s 
ideal of presentation had been copied from Carr’s.
Carr has sections on the obvious subjects, algebra, 
trigonometry, calculus and analytical geometry, but 
some sections are developed disproportionately, and 
particularly the formal side of the integral calculus. 
This seems to have been Carr’s pet subject, and the 
treatment of it is very full and in its way definitely 
good. There is no theory of functions; and I very much 
doubt whether Ramanujan, to the end of his life, ever 
understood at all clearly what an analytic function 
is. What is more surprising, in view of Carr’s own 
tastes and Ramanujan’s later work, is that there are 
no elliptic functions. However Ramanujan may have 
acquired his very peculiar knowledge of this theory, 
it was not from Carr.
On the whole, considered as an inspiration for a 
boy of such abnormal gifts, Carr was not too bad, and 
Ramanujan responded amazingly. According to his 
Indian biographers [3]:
Through the new world thus opened to him, Ra­
manujan went ranging with delight. It was this 
book which awakened his genius. He set him­
self to establish the formulae given therein. As 
he was without the aid of other books, each so­
lution was a piece of research so far as he was 
concerned ... Ramanujan used to say that the 
goddess of Namakkal inspired him with the for­
mulae in dreams. It is a remarkable fact that fre­
quently, on rising from bed, he would note down 
results and rapidly verify them, though he was 
not always able to supply a rigorous proof . . .
I have quoted the last sentences deliberately, not 
because I attach any importance to them—I am no 
more interested in the goddess of Namakkal than you 
are—but because we are now approaching the dif­
ficult and tragic part of Ramanujan’s career, and we 
must try to understand what we can of his psychology 
and of the atmosphere surrounding him in his early 
years.
I am sure that Ramanujan was no mystic and that 
religion, except in a strictly material sense, played 
no important part in his life. He was an orthodox 
high-caste Hindu, and always adhered (indeed with a 
severity most unusual in Indian residents in England) 
to all the observances of his caste. He had promised 
his parents to do so, and he kept his promises to the 
letter. He was a vegetarian in the strictest sense—this

proved a terrible difficulty later when he fell ill— 
and all the time he was in Cambridge he cooked all 
his food himself, and never cooked it without first 
changing into pyjamas.
Now the two memoirs of Ramanujan printed in 
the Papers (and both written by men who, in their 
different ways, knew him very well) contradict one 
another flatly about his religion. Seshu Aiyar and 
Ramachaundra Rao say
Ramanujan had definite religious views. He 
had a special veneration for the Namakkal 
goddess . . . He believed in the existence of a 
Supreme Being and in the attainment of God­
head by men ... He had settled convictions about 
the problem of life and after . . .
while I say
his religion was a matter of observance and not 
of intellectual conviction, and I remember well 
his telling me (much to my surprise) that all 
religions seemed to him more or less equally 
true...
Which of us is right? For my part I have no doubt at 
all; I am quite certain that I am.
Classical scholars have, I believe, a general princi­
ple, difficilior lectio potior—the more difficult read­
ing is to be preferred—in textual criticism. If the 
Archbishop of Canterbury tells one man that he be­
lieves in God, and another that he does not, then it 
is probably the second assertion which is true, since 
otherwise it is very difficult to understand why he 
should have made it, while there are many excellent 
reasons for his making the first whether it be true or 
false. Similarly, if a strict Brahmin like Ramanujan 
told me, as he certainly did, that he had no definite 
beliefs, then it is 100 to 1 that he meant what he said.
This was no sufficient reason why Ramanujan 
should outrage the feelings of his parents or his In­
dian friends. He was not a reasoned infidel, but an 
“agnostic” in its strict sense, who saw no particu­
lar good, and no particular harm, in Hinduism or in 
any other religion. Hinduism is, far more for example 
than Christianity, a religion of observance, in which 
belief counts for extremely little in any case, and, if 
Ramanujan’s friends assumed that he accepted the 
conventional doctrines of such a religion, and he did 
not disillusion them, he was practising a quite harm­
less, and probably necessary, economy of truth.
This question of Ramanujan’s religion is not itself 
important, but it is not altogether irrelevant, because 
there is one thing which I am really anxious to insist 
upon as strongly as I can. There is quite enough about 
Ramanujan that is difficult to understand, and we have 
no need to go out of our way to manufacture mystery. 
For myself, I liked and admired him enough to wish to 
be a rationalist about him; and I want to make it quite 
clear to you that Ramanujan, when he was living in 
Cambridge in good health and comfortable surround­
ings, was, in spite of his oddities, as reasonable, as 
sane, and in his way as shrewd a person as anyone 
here. The last thing which I want you to do is to 
throw up your hands and exclaim “here is something 
unintelligible, some mysterious manifestation of the 
immemorial wisdom of the East!” I do not believe in 
the immemorial wisdom of the East, and the picture 
I want to present to you is that of a man who had his 
peculiarities like other distinguished men, but a man 
in whose society one could take pleasure, with whom 
one could take tea and discuss politics or mathemat­
ics; the picture in short, not of a wonder from the East, 
or an inspired idiot, or a psychological freak, but of 
a rational human being who happened to be a great 
mathematician.
Until he was about 17, all went well with Ramanu­
jan.
In December 1903 he passed the Matricula­
tion Examination of the University of Madras, 
and in the January of the succeeding year he 
joined the Junior First in Arts class of the Gov­
ernment College, Kumbakonam, and won the 
Subrahmanyam scholarship, which is generally 
awarded for proficiency in English and Mathe­
matics...,
but after this there came a series of tragic checks.
By this time, he was so absorbed in the study of 
mathematics that in all lecture hours—whether 
devoted to English, History, or Physiology—he 
used to engage himself in some mathematical 
investigation, unmindful of what was happening 
in the class. This excessive devotion to mathe­
matics and his consequent neglect of the other 
subjects resulted in his failure to secure promo­
tion to the senior class and in the consequent 
discontinuance of the scholarship. Partly owing 
to disappointment and partly owing to the influ­
ence of a friend, he ran away northward into the 
Telugu country, but returned to Kumbakonam af­
ter some wandering and rejoined the college. As 
owing to his absence he failed to make sufficient 
attendances to obtain his term certificate in 1905, 
he entered Pachaiyappa’s College, Madras, in 

340
Algebra and Number Theory
1906, but falling ill returned to Kumbakonam. 
He appeared as a private student for the F. A. 
examination of December 1907 and failed . . .
Ramanujan does not seem to have had any definite 
occupation, except mathematics, until 1912. In 1909 
he married, and it became necessary for him to have 
some regular employment, but he had great difficulty 
in finding any because of his unfortunate college ca­
reer. About 1910 he began to find more influential 
Indian friends, Ramaswami Aiyar and his two biog­
raphers, but all their efforts to find a tolerable position 
for him failed, and in 1912 he became a clerk in the 
office of the Port Trust of Madras, at a salary of about 
£30 a year. He was then nearly 25. The years between 
18 and 25 are the critical years in a mathematician’s 
career, and the damage had been done. Ramanujan’s 
genius never had again its chance of full development.
There is not much to say about the rest of Ramanu­
jan’s life. His first substantial paper had been pub­
lished in 1911, and in 1912 his exceptional powers be­
gan to be understood. It is significant that, though In­
dians could befriend him, it was only the English who 
could get anything effective done. Sir Francis Spring 
and Sir Gilbert Walker obtained a special scholarship 
for him, £60 a year, sufficient for a married Indian to 
live in tolerable comfort. At the beginning of 1913 
he wrote to me, and Professor Neville and I, after 
many difficulties, got him to England in 1914. Here 
he had three years of uninterrupted activity, the re­
sults of which you can read in his Papers. He fell ill 
in the summer of 1917, and never really recovered, 
though he continued to work, rather spasmodically, 
but with no real sign of degeneration, until his death 
in 1920. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society 
early in 1918, and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cam­
bridge, later in the same year (and was the first In­
dian elected to either society). His last mathematical 
letter on “Mock-Theta functions”, the subject of Pro­
fessor Watson’s presidential address to the London 
Mathematical Society last year, was written about 
two months before he died.
The real tragedy about Ramanujan was not his early 
death. It is of course a disaster that any great man 
should die young, but a mathematician is often com­
paratively old at 30, and his death may be less of a 
catastrophe than it seems. Abel died at 26 and, al­
though he would no doubt have added a great deal 
more to mathematics, he could hardly have become a 
greater man. The tragedy of Ramanujan was not that 
he died young, but that, during his five unfortunate 
years, his genius was misdirected, side-tracked, and 
to a certain extent distorted.
I have been looking again through what I wrote 
about Ramanujan 16 years ago, and, although I know 
his work a good deal better now than I did then, and 
can think about him more dispassionately, I do not 
find a great deal which I should particularly want to 
alter. But there is just one sentence which now seems 
to me indefensible. I wrote
Opinions may differ about the importance of Ra­
manujan’s work, the kind of standard by which 
it should be judged, and the influence which it is 
likely to have on the mathematics of the future. 
It has not the simplicity and the inevitableness 
of the very greatest work; it would be greater 
if it were less strange. One gift it shows which 
no one can deny, profound and invincible orig­
inality. He would probably have been a greater 
mathematician if he could have been caught and 
tamed a little in his youth; he would have discov­
ered more that was new, and that, no doubt, of 
greater importance. On the other hand he would 
have been less of a Ramanujan, and more of 
a European professor, and the loss might have 
been greater than the gain . . .
and I stand by that except for the last sentence, which 
is quite ridiculous sentimentalism. There was no gain 
at all when the College at Kumbakonam rejected the 
one great man they had ever possessed, and the loss 
was irreparable; it is the worst instance that I know 
of the damage that can be done by an inefficient and 
inelastic educational system. So little was wanted, 
£60 a year for five years, occasional contact with 
almost anyone who had real knowledge and a little 
imagination, for the world to have gained another of 
its greatest mathematicians.
Ramanujan’s letters to me, which are reprinted in 
full in the Papers, contain the bare statements of about 
120 theorems, mostly formal identities extracted from 
his note-books. I quote fifteen which are fairly repre­
sentative. They include two theorems, (14) and (15), 
which are as interesting as any but of which one is 
false and the other, as stated, misleading. The rest 
have all been verified since by somebody; in par­
ticular Rogers and Watson found the proofs of the 
extremely difficult theorems (10)-(12).
I should like you to begin by trying to reconstruct 
the immediate reactions of an ordinary professional 
mathematician who receives a letter like this from an 
unknown Hindu clerk.

Algebra and Number Theory
The first question was whether I could recognize 
anything. I had proved things rather like (7) myself, 
and seemed vaguely familiar with (8). Actually (8) is 
classical; it is a formula of Laplace first proved prop­
erly by Jacobi; and (9) occurs in a paper published by 
Rogers in 1907. I thought that, as an expert in definite 
integrals, I could probably prove (5) and (6), and did 
so, though with a good deal more trouble than I had 
expected. On the whole the integral formulas seemed 
the least impressive.
The series formulas (1)-(4) I found much more 
intriguing, and it soon became obvious that Ramanu­
jan must possess much more general theorems and 
was keeping a great deal up his sleeve. The second 
is a formula of Bauer well known in the theory of 
Legendre series, but the others are much harder than 
they look. The theorems required in proving them 
can all be found now in Bailey’s Cambridge Tract on 
hypergeometric functions.
The formulas (10)-(13) are on a different level and 
obviously both difficult and deep. An expert in el­
liptic functions can see at once that (13) is derived 
somehow from the theory of “complex multiplica­
tion”, but (10)-(12) defeated me completely; I had 
never seen anything in the least like them before. A 
single look at them is enough to show that they could 
only be written down by a mathematician of the high­
est class. They must be true because, if they were 
not true, no one would have had the imagination to 
invent them. Finally (you must remember that I knew 
nothing whatever about Ramanujan, and had to think 
of every possibility), the writer must be completely 
honest, because great mathematicians are commoner 
than thieves or humbugs of such incredible skill.
The last two formulas stand apart because they are 
not right and show Ramanujan’s limitations, but that 
does not prevent them from being additional evidence 
of his extraordinary powers. The function in (14) is a 
genuine approximation to the coefficient, though not 
at all so close as Ramanujan imagined, and Ramanu­
jan’s false statement was one of the most fruitful he 
ever made, since it ended by leading us to all our 
joint work on partitions. Finally (15), though liter­
ally “true”, is definitely misleading (and Ramanujan 
was under a real misapprehension). The integral has 
no advantage, as an approximation, over the simpler 
function
found in 1908 by Landau. Ramanujan was deceived 
bya false analogy with the problem of the distribution 
of primes. I must postpone till later what I have to say 
about Ramanujan’s work on this side of the theory of 
numbers.
It was inevitable that a very large part of Ra­
manujan’s work should prove on examination to have 
been anticipated. He had been carrying an impossible 
handicap, a poor and solitary Hindu pitting his brains 
against the accumulated wisdom of Europe. He had 
had no real teaching at all; there was no one in India 
from whom he had anything to learn. He can have 
seen at the outside three or four books of good qual­
ity, all of them English. There had been periods in 
his life when he had access to the library in Madras, 
but it was not a very good one; it contained very few 
French or German books; and in any case Ramanujan 
did not know a word of either language. I should esti­
mate that about two-thirds of Ramanujan’s best Indian 
work was rediscovery, and comparatively little of it 
was published in his life-time, though Watson, who 
has worked systematically through his notebooks, has 
since disinterred a good deal more.
The great bulk of Ramanujan’s published work was 
done in England. His mind had hardened to some ex­
tent, and he never became at all an “orthodox” mathe­
matician, but he could still learn to do new things, and 
do them extremely well. It was impossible to teach 
him systematically, but he gradually absorbed new 
points of view. In particular he learnt what was meant 
by proof, and his later papers, while in some ways 
as odd and individual as ever, read like the works 
of a well-informed mathematician. His methods and 
his weapons, however, remained essentially the same. 
One would have thought that such a formalist as Ra­
manujan would have revelled in Cauchy’s Theorem, 
but he practically never used it, and the most aston­
ishing testimony to his formal genius is that he never 
seemed to feel the want of it in the least.
It is easy to compile an imposing list of theorems 
which Ramanujan re-discovered. Such a list naturally 
cannot be quite sharp, since sometimes he found a 
part only of a theorem, and sometimes, though he 
found the whole theorem, he was without the proof 
which is essential if the theorem is to be properly 
understood. For example, in the analytic theory of 
numbers he had, in a sense, discovered a great deal, 
but he was a very long way from understanding the 
real difficulties of the subject. And there is some of 
his work, mostly in the theory of elliptic functions, 
about which some mystery still remains; itis not pos­
sible, after all the work of Watson and Mordell, to 
draw the line between what he may have picked up 
somehow and what he must have found for himself.

HARDY: The Indian Mathematician Ramanujan
343
I will take only cases in which the evidence seems to 
me tolerably clear.
Here I must admit that I am to blame, since there 
is a good deal which we should like to know now 
and which I could have discovered quite easily. I 
saw Ramanujan almost every day, and could have 
cleared up most of the obscurity by a little cross­
examination. Ramanujan was quite able and willing 
to give a straight answer to a question, and not in 
the least disposed to make a mystery of his achieve­
ments. I hardly asked him a single question of this 
kind; I never even asked him whether (as I think he 
must have done) he had seen Cayley’s or Greenhill’s 
Elliptic Functions.
I am sorry about this now, but it does not really 
matter very much, and it was entirely natural. In the 
first place, I did not know that Ramanujan was going 
to die. He was not particularly interested in his own 
history or psychology; he was a mathematician anx­
ious to get on with the job. And after all I too was 
a mathematician, and a mathematician meeting Ra­
manujan had more interesting things to think about 
than historical research. It seemed ridiculous to worry 
him about how he had found this or that known theo­
rem, when he was showing me half a dozen new ones 
almost every day.
I do not think that Ramanujan discovered much 
in the classical theory of numbers, or indeed that he 
ever knew a great deal. He had no knowledge at all, at 
any time, of the general theory of arithmetical forms. 
I doubt whether he knew the law of quadratic reci­
procity before he came here. Diophantine equations 
should have suited him, but he did comparatively lit­
tle with them, and what he did do was not his best. 
Thus he gave solutions of Euler’s equation
x3 +y3 +z3 = w3, 
(17)
such as
x =3a2 +5ab - 5b2 ,y=4a2 - 4ab +6b2 , 
z =5a2 - 5ab - 3b2 ,w=6a2 - 4ab +4b2 ;
(18)
and
x = m7 - 3m4 (1 + p)+m(2 + 6p + 3p2), 
y =2m6 - 3m3 (1 + 2p)+1+3p +3p2 , 
z = m6 - 1 - 3p - 3p2 ,
w = m7 - 3m4p + m(3p2 - 1); 
(19)
but neither of these is the general solution.
He re-discovered the famous theorem of von Staudt 
about the Bernoullian numbers:
( — 1) n Bn = Gn + -+------1------+ ••• + 
(20)
2pq 
r
where p,q,... are those odd primes such that p — 
1,q— 1, ... are divisors of 2n, and Gn is an inte­
ger. In what sense he had proved it it is difficult to 
say, since he found it at a time of his life when he 
had hardly formed any definite concept of proof. As 
Littlewood says:
the clear-cut idea of what is meant by a proof, 
nowadays so familiar as to be taken for granted, 
he perhaps did not possess at all; if a significant 
piece of reasoning occurred somewhere, and the 
total mixture of evidence and intuition gave him 
certainty, he looked no further.
I shall have something to say later about this ques­
tion of proof, but I postpone it to another context in 
which it is much more important. In this case there 
is nothing in the proof that was not obviously within 
Ramanujan’s powers.
There is a considerable chapter of the theory of 
numbers, in particular the theory of the representa­
tion of integers by sums of squares, which is closely 
bound up with the theory of elliptic functions. Thus 
the number of representations of n by two squares is
r(n) = 4{d1(n) — d3 (n)}, 
(21)
where d1 (n) is the number of divisors of n of the 
form 4k +1and d3 (n) the number of divisors of the 
form 4k + 3. Jacobi gave similar formulas for 4, 6 
and 8 squares. Ramanujan found all these, and much 
more of the same kind.
He also found Gauss’s theorem that n is the sum of 
3 squares except when it is of the form
4a(8k + 7), 
(22)
but I do not attach much importance to this. The 
theorem is quite easy to guess and difficult to prove. 
All known proofs depend upon the general theory 
of ternary forms, of which Ramanujan knew nothing, 
and I agree with Professor Dickson in thinking it very 
unlikely that he possessed one. In any case he knew 
nothing about the number of representations.
Ramanujan, then, before he came to England, had 
added comparatively little to the theory of numbers; 
but no one can understand him who does not under­
stand his passion for numbers in themselves. I wrote 
before:

344
Algebra and Number Theory
He could remember the idiosyncrasies of num­
bers in an almost uncanny way. It was Littlewood 
who said that every positive integer was one of 
Ramanujan’s personal friends. I remember go­
ing to see him once when he was lying ill in 
Putney. I had ridden in taxi-cab No. 1729, and 
remarked that the number seemed to me rather 
a dull one, and that I hoped that it was not an 
unfavorable omen. “No,” he replied, “it is a very 
interesting number; it is the smallest number ex­
pressible as a sum of two cubes in two different 
ways” (1729 = 123 +13 =103 + 93). I asked 
him, naturally, whether he could tell me the so­
lution of the corresponding problem for fourth 
powers; and he replied, after a moment’s thought, 
that he knew no obvious example, and supposed 
that the first such number must be very large. 
(The smallest known is Euler’s example
(x + 1) n + (x — 1) n x + 3 x + 5 x + •••
(26) 
are extremely special cases. Watson [6] has recently
published a proof of the most imposing of them.
It is perhaps in his work in these fields that Ra­
manujan shows at his very best. I wrote before:
It was his insight into algebraical formulae, 
transformation of infinite series, and so forth, 
that was most amazing. On this side most cer­
tainly I have never met his equal, and I can com­
pare him only with Euler or Jacobi. He worked, 
far more than the majority of modern mathe­
maticians, by induction from numerical exam­
ples; all his congruence properties of partitions, 
for example, were discovered in this way. But 
with his memory, his patience, and his power 
of calculation he combined a power of general­
ization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for 
rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were 
often really startling, and made him, in his own 
peculiar field, without a rival in his day.
635318657 = 1584 * +594 = 1344 + 1334.)
In algebra, Ramanujan’s main work was concerned 
with hypergeometric series and continued fractions 
(I use the word algebra, of course, in its old-fashioned 
sense). These subjects suited him exactly, and here 
he was unquestionably one of the great masters. 
There are three now famous identities, the Dougall- 
Ramanujan identity

in which he had been anticipated by British math­
ematicians, and about which I shall speak in other 
lectures. As regards hypergeometric series one may 
say, roughly, that he re-discovered the formal theory, 
set out in Bailey’s tract, as it was known up to 1920. 
There is something about it in Carr, and more in 
Chrystal’s Algebra, and no doubt he got his start from 
that. The four formulas (1)-(4) are highly specialized 
examples of this work.
His masterpiece in continued fractions was his 
work on
1 x x2
(25)
1+1+1 + •••,
which includes the theorems (10)-(12). The theory 
of this fraction depends upon the Rogers-Ramanujan 
identities, in which he had been anticipated by Rogers, 
but he had gone beyond Rogers in other ways and the 
theorems which I have quoted are his own. He had 
many other very general and very beautiful formulas, 
of which formulas like Laguerre’s
(x + 1) n — (x — 1) n n n 2 — 1 n 2 — 22

HARDY: The Indian Mathematician Ramanujan
345
I do not think now that this extremely strong lan­
guage is extravagant. It is possible that the great days 
of formulas are finished, and that Ramanujan ought 
to have been born 100 years ago; but he was by far 
the greatest formalist of his time. There have been a 
good many more important, and I suppose one must 
say greater, mathematicians than Ramanujan during 
the last 50 years, but not one who could stand up to 
him on his own ground. Playing the game of which 
he knew the rules, he could give any mathematician 
in the world fifteen.
In analysis proper Ramanujan’s work is inevitably 
less impressive, since he knew no theory of functions, 
and you cannot do real analysis without it, and since 
the formal side of the integral calculus, which was all 
that he could learn from Carr or any other book, has 
been worked over so repeatedly and so intensively. 
Still, Ramanujan rediscovered an astonishing num­
ber of the most beautiful analytic identities. Thus the 
functional equation for the Riemann zeta-function
z (s ) = E 4
ns
n=1
namely
Z(1 - s) = 2(2n)-s cos (1 s^ r(s)Z(s), (27) 
2
stands (in an almost unrecognizable notation) in the 
notebooks. So does Poisson’s summation formula 
a1 /2 {2P(0) + P(a) + P(2a) + '' ' |
= P1 /2 {1P(0) + P(P) + P(2P) + ••• } , (28) 
where
ap = 2n and p(x) = \ — [ p(t)cos(xt)dt.
V n J o
So also does Abel’s functional equation ([1], [4]):
L (x) + L (y) + L (xy) + l( x(1 y))
1 - xy
+ l ( y (1 - x) A =3l (1) 
(29)
1 - xy
for
L(x) = p+x2+i+
He had most of the formal ideas which underlie the 
recent work of Watson and of Titchmarsh and myself 
on Fourier kernels and reciprocal functions; and he 
could of course evaluate any evaluable definite in­
tegral. There is one particularly interesting formula, 
viz.
f ^
I xs-1 {p(0) — xp(1) + x2p(2) — • • • } dx
Jo
= 
' s), 
(30)
sin sn
of which he was especially fond and made continual 
use. This is really an interpolation formula, which 
enables us to say, for example, that, under certain 
conditions, a function which vanishes for all positive 
integral values of its argument must vanish identi­
cally. I have never seen this formula stated explicitly 
by any one else, though it is closely connected with 
the work of Mellin and others.
I have left till last the two most intriguing sides of 
Ramanujan’s early work, his work on elliptic func­
tions and in the analytic theory of numbers. The first 
is probably too specialized and intricate for anyone 
but an expert to understand, and I shall say nothing 
about it now. The second subject is still more difficult 
(as anyone who has read Landau’s book on primes or 
Ingham’s tract will know), but anyone can understand 
roughly what the problems of the subject are, and any 
decent mathematician can understand roughly why 
they defeated Ramanujan. For this was Ramanujan’s 
one real failure; he showed, as always, astonishing 
imaginative power, but he proved next to nothing, 
and a great deal even of what he imagined was false.
Here I am obliged to interpolate some remarks on 
a very difficult subject, proof and its importance in 
mathematics. All physicists, and a good many quite 
respectable mathematicians, are contemptuous about 
proof. I have heard Professor Eddington, for example, 
maintain that proof, as pure mathematicians under­
stand it, is really quite uninteresting and unimportant, 
and that no one who is really certain that he has found 
something good should waste his time looking for a 
proof. It is true that Eddington is inconsistent, and 
has sometimes even descended to proof himself. It 
is not enough for him to have direct knowledge that 
there are exactly 136 • 2256 protons in the universe; 
he cannot resist the temptation of proving it; and I 
cannot help thinking that the proof, whatever it may 
be worth, gives him a certain amount of intellectual 
satisfaction. His apology would no doubt be that proof 
means something quite different for him from what it 
means for a pure mathematician, and in any case we 
need not take him too literally. But the opinion which 
I have attributed to him, and with which I am sure 
that almost all physicists agree at the bottom of their 

346
Algebra and Number Theory
hearts, is one to which a mathematician ought to have 
some reply.
I am not going to get entangled in the analysis of 
a particularly prickly concept, but I think that there 
are a few points about proof where nearly all math­
ematicians are agreed. In the first place, even if we 
do not understand exactly what proof is, we can, in 
ordinary analysis at any rate, recognise a proof when 
we see one. Secondly, there are two different motives 
in any presentation of a proof. The first motive is sim­
ply to secure conviction. The second is to exhibit the 
conclusion as the climax of a conventional pattern of 
propositions, a sequence of propositions whose truth 
is admitted and which are arranged in accordance 
with rules. These are the two ideals, and experience 
shows that, except in the simplest mathematics, we 
can hardly ever satisfy the first ideal without also 
satisfying the second. We may be able to recognise 
directly that 5, or even 17, is prime, but nobody can 
convince himself that
2127-1
is prime except by studying a proof. No one has ever 
had an imagination so vivid and comprehensive as 
that.
A mathematician usually discovers a theorem by 
an effort of intuition; the conclusion strikes him as 
plausible, and he sets to work to manufacture a proof. 
Sometimes this is a matter of routine, and any well- 
trained professional could supply what is wanted, but 
more often imagination is a very unreliable guide. In 
particular this is so in the analytic theory of numbers, 
where even Ramanujan’s imagination led him very 
seriously astray.
There is a striking example, which I have very 
often quoted, of a false conjecture which seems to 
have been endorsed even by Gauss and which took 
about 100 years to refute. The central problem of the 
analytic theory of numbers is that of the distribution 
of the primes. The number n (x) of primes less than 
a large number x is approximately
x
log x ;
(31)
this is the Prime Number Theorem, which had been 
conjectured for a very long time, but was never es­
tablished properly until Hadamard and de la Vallee 
Poussin proved it in 1896. The approximation errs by 
defect, and a much better one is
x dt
Li( x) = 
------
h log t
(32)
In some ways a still better one is
Li(x) - -Li(x1 /2) — 3Li(x1 /3) - 1 Li( x 1 / 5)
5
— - Li( x1 / 6) —
6 ( 
)
1 Li( x1 / 7) +
• • • 
(33)
(we need not trouble now about the law of formation 
of the series). It is extremely natural to infer that
n(x) < Li(x), 
(34)
at any rate for large x, and Gauss and other mathe­
maticians commented on the high probability of this 
conjecture. The conjecture is not only plausible but 
is supported by all the evidence of the facts. The 
primes are known up to 10, 000, 000, and their num­
ber at intervals up to 1, 000, 000, 000, and (34) is true 
for every value of x for which data exist.
In 1912 Littlewood proved that the conjecture is 
false, and that there are an infinity of values of x 
for which the sign of inequality in (34) must be re­
versed. In particular, there is a number X such that 
(34) is false for some x less than X. Littlewood proved 
the existence of X , but his method did not give any 
particular value, and it is only very recently that an 
admissible value, viz.
X = 1010
1034
was found by Skewes [5]. I think that this is the largest 
number which has ever served any definite purpose 
in mathematics.
The number of protons in the universe is about 
1080. The number of possible games of chess is much 
bigger, perhaps
50 
1010
(in any case a second-order exponential). If the uni­
verse were the chessboard, the protons the chess­
men, and any interchange in the position of two 
protons a move, then the number of possible games 
would be something like the Skewes number. How­
ever much the number may be reduced by refinements 
on Skewes’s argument, it does not seem at all likely 
that we shall ever know a single instance of the truth 
of Littlewood’s theorem.
This is an example in which the truth has defeated 
not only all the evidence of the facts and of common 
sense but even a mathematical imagination so pow­
erful and profound as that of Gauss; but of course it 
is taken from the most difficult parts of the theory. 
No part of the theory of primes is really easy, but 
up to a point simple arguments, although they will

prove very little, do not actually mislead us. For ex­
ample, there are simple arguments which might lead 
any good mathematician to the conclusion
x
n (x) ~ ;-----

(35)
of the Prime Number Theorem, or, what is the same 
thing, to the conclusion that
Pn ~ n log n, 
(36)
where pn is the nth prime number (here f ~ g means 
that the ratio f/g tends to unity).
In the first place, we may start from Euler’s identity

This is true for s>1, but both series and product 
become infinite for s =1. It is natural to argue that, 
when s =1, the series and the product should diverge 
in the same sort of way. Also,
log n 1--=e log T-1P-7
= E ~ + E f y2s + T“3r + ■ ■ ■ , (38) 
ps

and the last series remains finite fors =1. It is natural 
to infer that 1 diverges like
log (e n) •
or, more precisely, that 
p
for large x. Since also
y-E_
n log n 
n <x

(39)
^ log log x,
formula (39) indicates that pn is about nlog n.
There is a slightly more sophisticated argument 
which is really simpler. It is easy to see that the highest 
power of a prime p which divides x! is

where [y] denotes the integral part ofy. Hence

The left-hand side of (40) is practically x log x,by 
Stirling’s Theorem. As regards the right-hand, one 
may argue: squares, cubes, . . . of primes are compar­
atively rare, and the terms involving them should be 
unimportant, and it should also make comparatively 
little difference if we replace [x/p] by x/p. We thus 
infer that
log p 
log p
^ x log x, > ------~ log x,

and this again just fits the view that pn is approxi­
mately n log n.
This is broadly the argument used, naturally in a 
less naive form, by Tchebychef, who was the first to 
make substantial progress in the theory of primes, 
and I imagine that Ramanujan began by arguing in 
the same sort of way, though there is nothing in the 
note-books to show. All that is plain is that Ramanu­
jan found the form of the Prime Number Theorem 
for himself. This was a considerable achievement; 
for the men who had found the form of the theorem 
before him, like Legendre, Gauss, and Dirichlet, had 
all been very great mathematicians; and Ramanujan 
found other formulas which lie still further below the 
surface. Perhaps the best instance is (15). The inte­
gral is better replaced by the simpler function (16), 
but what Ramanujan says is correct as it stands and 
was proved by Landau in 1908; and there is nothing 
obvious to suggest its truth.
The fact remains that hardly any of Ramanujan’s 
work in this field had any permanent value. The 
analytic theory of numbers is one of those excep­
tional branches of mathematics in which proof really 
is everything and nothing short of absolute rigour 
counts. The achievement of the mathematicians who 
found the Prime Number Theorem was quite a small 
thing compared with that of those who found the 
proof. It is not merely that in this theory (as Lit­
tlewood’s theorem shows) you can never be sure of 
the facts without the proof, though this is impor­
tant enough. The whole history of the Prime Number 
Theorem, and the other big theorems of the subject, 
shows that you cannot reach any real understanding 
of the structure and meaning of the theory, or have 
any sound instincts to guide you in further research, 

348
Algebra and Number Theory
until you have mastered the proofs. It is compara­
tively easy to make clever guesses; indeed there are 
theorems, like Goldbach’s Theorem (that any even 
number greater than 2 is a sum of two primes), which 
have never been proved and which any fool could have 
guessed.
The theory of primes depends upon the properties 
of Riemann’s function Z (s), considered as an analytic 
function of the complex variable s, and in particular 
on the distribution of its zeros; and Ramanujan knew 
nothing at all about the theory of analytic functions. 
I wrote before:
Ramanujan’s theory of primes was vitiated by his 
ignorance of the theory of functions of a com­
plex variable. It was (so to say) what the theory 
might be if the zeta-function had no complex 
zeros. His method depended upon a wholesale 
use of divergent series . . . That his proofs should 
have been invalid was only to be expected. But 
the mistakes went deeper than that, and many 
of the actual results were false. He had obtained 
the dominant terms of the classical formulae, al­
though by invalid methods; but none of them are 
such close approximations as he supposed. This 
may be said to have been Ramanujan’s one great 
failure . . .
andifIhad stopped there I should have had nothing to 
add, butI allowed myself again to be led away by sen­
timentalism. I went on to argue that “his failure was 
more wonderful than any of his triumphs”, and that is 
an absurd exaggeration. It is no use trying to pretend 
that failure is something else. This much perhaps we 
may say, that his failure is one which, on the balance, 
should increase and not diminish our admiration for 
his gifts, since it gives us additional, and surprising, 
evidence of his imagination and versatility.
But the reputation of a mathematician cannot be 
made by failures or by re-discoveries; it must rest 
primarily, and rightly, on actual and original achieve­
ment. I have to justify Ramanujan on this ground, and 
that I hope to do in my later lectures.
Note: This lecture was originally given at the Har­
vard Tercentenary Conference of Arts and Sciences, 
on August 31, 1936.

Emmy Noether
CLARK H. KIMBERLING
American Mathematical Monthly 79 (1972), 136-149
The past two years have seen a surge of interest in 
Emmy Noether and her mathematics. Along with Au­
guste Dick’s biography of her, listed below, Constance 
Reid’s biography, Hilbert, frequently mentions Emmy 
Noether. New mathematics books, such as Introduc­
tion to the Calculus of Variations by Hans Sagan, and 
Commutative Rings by Irving Kaplansky, are spread­
ing anew her methods, and the adjective “noetherian” 
abounds in titles to papers in mathematics research 
journals. The State University of New York at Buffalo 
has just set up a George William Hill-Emmy Noether 
Fellowship. A high school textbook, Modern Intro­
ductory Analysis, by Dolciani, Donnelly, Jurgensen, 
and Wooten, devotes a page to Emmy Noether. And 
one finds such remarks in periodical literature as “The 
woman mathematician today is better off than Emmy 
Noether, who taught without pay. But ...”.
Despite all this recent interest, it is difficult to find 
much about Emmy Noether in mathematics history 
books. Although she was dubbed “der Noether” by 
P. S. Alexandroff, and that name with its masculine 
German article has stuck, she is given only a foot­
note in E. T. Bell’s Men of Mathematics and hardly 
more in comparable books. In fact, little else can be 
found about her than three obituary addresses and the 
biography published just last year:

dress at Bryn Mawr College, April 26, 1935),

Her passing
A note in the files of the Bryn Mawr Alumnae Bulletin 
reads, “The above was inspired, if not written, by Dr. 
Hermann Weyl, eminent German mathematician. Mr. 
Einstein had never met Miss Noether.” The “above” is 
the following, as it appeared in The New York Times, 
May 3, 1935:
The efforts of most human beings are consumed 
in the struggle for their daily bread, but most of 
those who are, either through fortune or some 
special gift, relieved of this struggle are largely 
absorbed in further improving their worldly lot. 
Beneath the effort directed toward the accumu­
lation of worldly goods lies all too frequently 
the illusion that this is the most substantial and 
desirable end to be achieved; but there is, fortu­
nately, a minority composed of those who rec­
ognize early in their lives that the most beautiful 
and satisfying experiences open to humankind 
are not derived from the outside, but are bound 
up with the development of the individual’s own 
feeling, thinking and acting. The genuine artists, 
investigators and thinkers have always been per­
sons of this kind. However inconspicuously the 
life of these individuals runs its course, none 
the less the fruits of their endeavors are the most 
valuable contributions which one generation can 
make to its successors.
Within the past few days a distinguished math­
ematician, Professor Emmy Noether, formerly 
connected with the University of Gottingen and 
for the past two years at Bryn Mawr College, 
died in her fifty-third year. In the judgment of the 
349

350
Algebra and Number Theory
most competent living mathematicians, Fraulein 
Noether was the most significant creative mathe­
matical genius thus far produced since the higher 
education of women began. In the realm of alge­
bra, in which the most gifted mathematicians 
have been busy for centuries, she discovered 
methods which have proved of enormous impor­
tance in the development of the present-day 
younger generation of mathematicians. Pure 
mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical 
ideas. One seeks the most general ideas of oper­
ation which will bring together in simple, logi­
cal and unified form the largest possible circle of 
formal relationships. In this effort toward logical 
beauty spiritual formulae are discovered neces­
sary for the deeper penetration into the laws of 
nature.
Born in a Jewish family distinguished for the 
love of learning, Emmy Noether, who, in spite 
of the efforts of the great Gottingen mathemati­
cian, Hilbert, never reached the academic stand­
ing due her in her own country, none the less 
surrounded herself with a group of students and 
investigators at Gottingen, who have already be­
come distinguished as teachers and investiga­
tors. Her unselfish, significant work over a pe­
riod of many years was rewarded by new rulers 
of Germany with a dismissal, which cost her the 
means of maintaining her simple life and the op­
portunity to carry on her mathematical studies. 
Farsighted friends of science in this country were 
fortunately able to make such arrangements at 
Bryn Mawr College and at Princeton that she 
found in America up to the day of her death not 
only colleagues who esteemed her friendship but 
grateful pupils whose enthusiasm made her last 
years the happiest and perhaps the most fruitful 
of her entire career.
ALBERT EINSTEIN
Princeton University, May 1, 1935.
Freeman J. Dyson of The Institute for Advanced 
Study has written me concerning the statement above 
that the letter written by Einstein to The New York 
Times was “inspired, if not written, by Dr. Her­
mann Weyl.” Professor Dyson discussed this state­
ment with Miss Dukas, Einstein’s former secretary, 
who is presently in charge of the Einstein archive at 
The Institute for Advanced Study.
I quote from Professor Dyson’s letter:
Miss Dukas has the original German draft of 
the letter. She confirms that this was written by 
Einstein himself at the request of Weyl. She does 
not remember whether Weyl or somebody else 
afterwards translated it into English.
Miss Dukes also has a letter from Einstein 
to Hilbert dated May 24, 1918, including the 
following passage: “Gestern erhielt ich von 
Fr. Noether eine sehr interessante Arbeit ue- 
ber Invariantenbildung. Es imponiert mir, dass 
man diese Dinge von so allgemeinem Stand- 
punkt ubersehen kann. Es hatte den Goettinger 
Felgrauen nichts geschadet, wenn sie zu Frl. 
Noether in die Schule geschickt worden waeren. 
Sie scheint ihr Handwerk zu verstehen!”
Here “Feldgrauen” is slang for “Warriors”.
From the letter you can see that, while it may 
be true that Einstein and Emmy Noether never 
met (Miss Dukes is not sure about this), Einstein 
certainly knew her work well and understood its 
importance early and at first hand.

Early years
We are indebted to Dr. Auguste Dick of Vienna for 
much of what we know today about Emmy Noether’s 
early life and her forebears. Most of the information 
in this present section may be found in Dr. Dick’s 
biography.
Among those affected by an 1809 Tolerance Edict 
in the German state of Baden was one Elias Samuel, 
who as the head of a Jewish household was required 
to change his name and the names of his nine chil­
dren. He chose the surname Nother, and one of his 
sons, Hertz, he renamed Hermann. At the age of eigh­
teen, Hermann left his birthplace, Bruchsal, and went 
to Mannheim to study theology. However, in 1837, 
he and his older brother Joseph founded an iron- 
wholesaling firm. The firm lasted for nearly a century, 
when it fell to anti-Jewish forces.
Born to Hermann and Amalia Nother were five 
children, and the third, in 1844, was named Max. Dur­
ing his fourteenth year, Max suffered from infantile 
paralysis and was somewhat handicapped for the rest 
of his life. Nevertheless, he became a mathematician 
of great stature, arriving at the University of Erlan­
gen as a professor in 1875, where he remained until 
his death in 1921. In 1880, Max married Ida Amalia 
Kaufmann. Although their marriage certificate bears 
the name Nother, Max and all his children used the 
name Noether instead.
Amalie Emmy Noether was born on March 23, 
1882 in the South German town of Erlangen. She was 
the first child of Max and Ida Noether and soon had 

KIMBERLING: Emmy Noether
351
brothers, Albert, born in 1883, and Fritz, in 1884. Still 
another brother was born in 1889. The family rented 
a large flat in the first story of an apartment house 
at Nurnberger Strasse 30-32. Another tenant there 
for many years was Professor Eilhard Wiedemann, 
remembered as an Islamist as well as a physicist. The 
Noether family occupied their flat for about forty-five 
years.
As a child, Emmy was acutely near-sighted, not out­
wardly attractive, and not exceptional in any way. Her 
teachers and classmates remember that she favored 
the study of language and that little she did reflected 
teachings of the Jewish religion. Like many other 
girls, she took clavier lessons and dancing lessons, 
but apparently with little fervor.
Three years after leaving her “high school”, the 
Stadtischen Hoheren Tochterschule in Erlangen, 
Emmy took tests for prospective schoolteachers of 
French and English. These tests were given in Ans­
bach in April, 1900. No sooner had she passed these 
and thus qualified as a language teacher than she be­
came interested in university studies.
Among nearly a thousand students at the Univer­
sity of Erlangen in the winter of 1900, Emmy Noether 
was one of two women. As a rule, female students 
could not be registered in the usual sense, and they 
could take an examination for course credit only 
upon consent of the professor teaching the course. 
This consent was often withheld. Nevertheless, 
whether passing through the prerequisite courses in 
the usual manner or not, a woman could eventually 
take an examination for a university certificate.
Among Emmy’s early professors at Erlangen, one 
was a historian and another, Julius Pirson, a pro­
fessor of romance languages. Between 1900 and 
1902, Emmy must have chosen to pursue mathemat­
ics rather than languages, since during that time she 
must have been preparing for the final university ex­
amination, which she passed in July, 1903. This ex­
amination was given in Nurnberg at the royal Real- 
gymnasium, now the Willstatter-Gymnasium. Quite 
possibly it was administered by the mathematician 
Aurel VoB, from whom Emmy’s brother Fritz later 
received his doctorate.
In the winter of 1903 Emmy attended classes at the 
University of Gottingen. There she heard such em­
inent mathematicians as Hermann Minkowski, Otto 
Blumenthal, Felix Klein, and David Hilbert. After just 
one semester, however, she returned to Erlangen, for 
it had become possible for women to be matriculated 
and tested in the manner formerly reserved for men.
In October of 1904, Emmy Noether was officially 
registered as a student at the University of Erlangen.
As a member of Section II of the Philosophical 
Faculty, she studied only mathematics. On Decem­
ber 13, 1907, she passed her doctoral oral examina­
tion, and in July of 1908 her dissertation was regis­
tered with the Erlanger Universitatsschriften as Num­
ber 202.

Excerpts from Weyl’s address
Concerning the dissertation and the professor, Paul 
Gordan, under whom Emmy wrote it, Weyl spoke as 
follows in his memorial address:
Side by side with [Max] Noether acted in Erlan­
gen as a mathematician the closely befriended 
Gordan, an offspring of Clebsch’s school like 
Noether himself. Gordan had come to Erlangen 
shortly before, in 1874, and he, too, remained 
associated with that university until his death in 
1912. Emmy wrote her doctor’s thesis under him 
in 1907: On complete systems of invariants for 
ternary biquadratic forms; it is entirely in line 
with the Gordan spirit and his problems. The 
Mathematische Annalen contains a detailed obit­
uary of Gordan and an analysis of his work, writ­
ten by Max Noether with Emmy’s collaboration. 
Besides her father, Gordan must have been well- 
nigh one of the most familiar figures in Emmy’s 
early life, first as a friend of the house, later as a 
mathematician also; she kept a profound rever­
ence for him though her own mathematical taste 
soon developed in quite a different direction. I 
remember that his picture decorated the wall of 
her study in Gottingen. These two men, the fa­
ther and Gordan, determined the atmosphere in 
which she grew up. Therefore I shall venture to 
describe them with a few strokes.
Riemann had developed the theory of alge­
braic functions of one variable and their in­
tegrals, the so-called Abelian integrals, by a 
function-theoretic transcendental method rest­
ing on the minimum principle of potential theory 
which he named after Dirichlet, and had uncov­
ered the purely topological foundations of the 
manifold function-theoretic relations governing 
this domain. (Stringent proof of Dirichlet’s prin­
ciple which seemed so evident from the physi­
cist’s standpoint was only given about fifty years 
later by Hilbert.) There remained the task of 
replacing and securing his transcendental exis­
tential proofs by the explicit algebraic construc­
tion starting with the equation of the algebraic 
curve. Weierstrass solved this problem (in his 

352
Algebra and Number Theory
lectures published in detail only later) in his 
own half function-theoretic, half algebraic way, 
but Clebsch had introduced Riemann’s ideas 
into the geometric theory of algebraic curves 
and Noether became, after Clebsch had passed 
away young, his executor in this matter: he suc­
ceeded in erecting the whole structure of the 
algebraic geometry of curves on the basis of the 
so-called Noether residual theorem. This line of 
research was taken up later on, mainly in Italy; 
the vein Noether struck is still a profusely gush­
ing spring of investigations; among us, men like 
Lefschetz and Zariski bear witness thereto. Later 
on there arose, beside Riemann’s transcenden­
tal and Noether’s algebraic-geometric method, 
an arithmetical theory of algebraic functions 
due to Dedekind and Weber on the one side, 
to Hensel and Landsberg on the other. Emmy 
Noether stood closer to this trend of thought. 
A brief report on the arithmetical theory of al­
gebraic functions that parallels the correspond­
ing notions in the competing theories was pub­
lished by her in 1920 in the Jahresberichte der 
Deutschen Mathematikervereinigung. She thus 
supplemented the well-known report by Brill 
and her father on the algebraic-geometric theory 
that had appeared in 1894 in one of the first vol­
umes of the Jahresberichte. Noether’s residual 
theorem was later fitted by Emmy into her gen­
eral theory of ideals in arbitrary rings. This sci­
entific kinship of father and daughter—who be­
came in a certain sense his successor in algebra, 
but stands beside him independent in her funda­
mental attitude and in her problems—is some­
thing extremely beautiful and gratifying. The fa­
ther was—such is the impression I gather from 
his papers and even more from the many obitu­
ary biographies he wrote for the Mathematische 
Annalen—a very intelligent, warm-hearted har­
monious man of many-sided interests and ster­
ling education.
Gordan was of a different stamp. A queer fel­
low, impulsive and one-sided. A great walker 
and talker—he liked that kind of walk to which 
frequent stops at a beer-garden or a cafe be­
long. Either with friends, and then accompany­
ing his discussions with violent gesticulations, 
completely irrespective of his surroundings; or 
alone, and then murmuring to himself and pon­
dering over mathematical problems; or if in an 
idler mood, carrying out long numerical calcu­
lations by heart. There always remained some­
thing of the eternal “Bursche” of the 1848 type 
about him—an air of dressing gown, beer and 
tobacco, relieved however by a keen sense of 
humor and a strong dash of wit. When he had 
to listen to others, in classrooms or at meetings, 
he was always half asleep. As a mathematician 
not of Noether’s rank, and of an essentially dif­
ferent kind, Noether himself concludes his char­
acterization of him with the short sentence: “Er 
war ein Algorithmiker.” His strength rested on 
the invention and calculative execution of for­
mal processes. There exist papers of his where 
twenty pages of formulas are not interrupted by 
a single text word; it is told that in all his papers 
he himself wrote the formulas only, the text be­
ing added by his friends. Noether says of him: 
“The formula always and everywhere was the 
indispensable support for the formation of his 
thoughts, his conclusions and his mode of ex­
pression... In his lectures he carefully avoided 
any fundamental definition of conceptual kind, 
even that of the limit.”
He, too, had belonged to Clebsch’s most in­
timate collaborators, had written with Clebsch 
their book on Abelian integrals; he later shifted 
over to the theory of invariants following his 
formal talent; here he added considerably to the 
development of the so-called symbolic method, 
and he finally succeeded in proving by means of 
this computative method of explicit construction 
the finiteness of a rational integral basis for bi­
nary invariants. Years later Hilbert demonstrated 
the theorem much more generally for an arbi­
trary number of variables—by an entirely new 
approach, the characteristic Hilbertian species 
of methods, putting aside the whole apparatus 
of symbolic treatment and attacking the thing 
itself as directly as possible. Ex ungue leonem— 
the young lion Hilbert showed his claws. It was, 
however, at first only an existential proof pro­
viding for no actual, finite algebraic construc­
tion. Hence Gordan’s characteristic exclamation: 
“This is not mathematics, but theology!” What 
then would he have said about his former pupil 
Emmy Noether’s later “theology”, that abhorred 
all calculation and operated in a much thinner 
air of abstraction than Hilbert ever dared!
Itis queer enough that a formalist like Gordan 
was the mathematician from whom her mathe­
matical orbit set out; a greater contrast is hardly 
imaginable than between her first paper, the dis­
sertation, and her works of maturity; for the

former is an extreme example of formal com­
putations and the latter constitute an extreme 
and grandiose example of conceptual axiomatic 
thinking in mathematics. Her thesis ends with a 
table of the complete system of covariant forms 
for a given ternary quartic consisting of not less 
than 331 forms in symbolic representation. It is 
an awe-inspiring piece of work; but today I am 
afraid we should be inclined to rank it among 
those achievements with regard to which Gor­
dan himself once said when asked about the use 
of the theory of invariants: “Oh, it is very useful 
indeed; one can write many theses about it.”
In 1910 Gordan retired, soon to be replaced by 
Ernst Fischer. In Weyl’s judgment Fischer had a more 
penetrating influence on Emmy Noether’s work than 
Gordan did. Weyl wrote as follows:
Under his direction the transition from Gordan’s 
formal standpoint to the Hilbert method of ap­
proach was accomplished. She refers in her pa­
pers at this time again and again to conversations 
with Fischer. This epoch extends until about 
1919. The main interest is concentrated on finite 
rational and integral bases; the proof of finite­
ness is given by her for the invariants of a finite 
group (without using Hilbert’s general basis the­
orem for ideals), for invariants with restriction to 
integral coefficients, and finally she attacks the 
same question along with the question of a min­
imum basis consisting of independent elements 
for fields of rational functions.

Her contribution to physics
In 1916, Emmy Noether left Erlangen and went to 
the University of Gottingen. At that time Hilbert was 
working on the general theory of relativity and Emmy 
was especially welcome because of her knowledge of 
the theory of invariants.
Weyl described her major contribution to two im­
portant aspects of relativity as
the genuine and universal mathematical formu­
lation: first, the reduction of the problem of dif­
ferential invariants to a purely algebraic one by 
use of ‘normal coordinates’; second, the identi­
ties between the left sides of Euler’s equations 
of a problem of variation which occur when the 
(multiple) integral is invariant with respect to 
a group of transformations involving arbitrary 
functions (identities that contain the conserva­
tion theorem of energy and momentum in the 
case of invariance with respect to arbitrary trans­
formations of the four world coordinates).
During my own inquiries about Emmy Noether, it 
was once hinted that “young physicists are using her 
theories,” and I was eventually referred to Professor 
Eugene Wigner (1963 Noble Prize in Physics), who 
wrote,
We physicists pay lip service to the great ac­
complishments of Emmy Noether, but we do not 
really use her work. Her contribution to physics 
that is most often quoted arose from a suggestion 
of Felix Klein. It concerns the conservation laws 
of physics, which she derived in a way which was 
at that time novel and should have excited physi­
cists more than it did. However, most physicists 
know little else about her, even though many of 
us who have a marginal interest in mathematics 
have read much else by and about her.
Professor Peter G. Bergmann of Syracuse Univer­
sity gave the following account of Emmy Noether’s 
influence in physics:
Noether’s Theorem, so-called, forms one of the 
corner stones of work in general relativity as 
well as in certain aspects of elementary particle 
physics. The idea is, briefly, that to every invari­
ance or symmetry property of the laws of nature 
(or of a proposed theory) there corresponds a 
conservation law, and vice versa. Accordingly, 
if a physical quantity is known to satisfy a con­
servation law (known as a “good quantum num­
ber” in quantum physics), the theorist attempts 
to construct a theory with appropriate symmetry 
properties. Conversely, if a theory is known to 
possess certain symmetries, then this fact alone 
entails the existence of certain integrals of the 
dynamical equations.
General relativity is characterized by the prin­
ciple of general covariance, according to which 
the laws of nature are invariant with respect to 
arbitrary curvilinear coordinate transformations 
that satisfy minimal conditions of continuity 
and differentiability. A discussion of the conse­
quences in terms of Noether’s theorem (whether 
explicitly quoted as such or not) would have to 
include all of the work on ponderomotive laws, 
inter alia.
Goldstein’s text, Classical Mechanics, con­
tains a treatment of Noether’s theorem on 

354
Algebra and Number Theory
pp. 47 ff., without, however, calling it by that (or 
any other) name. J. L. Anderson’s book, Prin­
ciples of Relativity Physics (Academic Press, 
1967), explicitly refers to Noether’s Theorem on 
p. 92. These references, picked at random from 
my book shelves at home, will indicate to you 
that a list of papers involving Noether’s theorem 
in one way or other would probably amount to 
hundreds of items.

World War I years
At Gottingen it was still difficult, as it had been in 
Erlangen, for anyone to push through any provision 
for remuneration for Dr. Noether. The philologists 
and historians of the Gottingen Philosophical Faculty 
opposed Hilbert’s efforts in her behalf, and Hilbert 
once declared during a University Senate meeting, “I 
do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argu­
ment against her admission as Privatdozent. After all, 
we are a university and not a bathing establishment.” 
Finally, in 1919, her habilitation as Privatdozent was 
made possible, and three years later she became a 
“nicht-beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor”, un­
der which title she received no salary. A small salary 
was soon afforded her, however, as a lecturer in alge­
bra.
Weyl’s description of Emmy Noether’s political life 
is interesting as a commentary on pre-World War II 
Germany:
During the wild times after the Revolution of 
1918, she did not keep aloof from the polit­
ical excitement, she sided more or less with 
the Social Democrats; without being actually in 
party life she participated intensely in the dis­
cussion of the political and social problems of 
the day. One of her first pupils, Grete Hermann, 
belonged to Nelson’s philosophic-political circle 
in Gottingen. It is hardly imaginable nowadays 
how willing the young generation in Germany 
was at that time for a fresh start, to try to build 
up Germany, Europe, society in general, on the 
foundations of reason, humaneness, and justice. 
But alas! the mood among the academic youth 
soon enough veered around; in the struggles that 
shook Germany during the following years and 
which took on the form of civil war here and 
there, we find them mostly on the side of the re­
actionary and nationalistic forces. Responsible 
for this above all was the breaking by the Allies 
of the promise of Wilson’s Fourteen Points, and 
the fact that Republican Germany came to feel 
the victors’ fist not less hard than the Imperial 
Reich could have; in particular, the youth were 
embittered by the national defamation added 
to the enforcement of a grim peace treaty. It 
was then that the great opportunity for the paci­
fication of Europe was lost, and the seed sown 
for the disastrous development we are the wit­
nesses of. In later years Emmy Noether took no 
part in matters political. She always remained, 
however, a convinced pacifist, a stand which she 
held very important and serious.

Excerpts from Alexandroff’s 
address
Emmy Noether’s mathematical activities from 1919 to 
1923 and her influence on the mathematical commu­
nity are covered by Alexandroff in his 1935 address 
to the Moscow Mathematical Society:
Emmy Noether entered upon her wholly individ­
ual path of mathematical work in 1919-1920. 
She herself dated the beginning of this principal 
period of activity with the well-known collabo­
rative work with V. Schmeidler (Mathematische 
Zeitschrift 8 (1920)). This work serves as a pro­
logue to her general theory of ideals, opening 
with the classical memoir of 1921, Idealtheorie 
in Ringbereiche. I think that of all that Emmy 
Noether did, the bases of the general theory of 
ideals and all the work related to them have ex­
erted, and will continue to exert, the greatest 
influence on mathematics as a whole ...Ifthe 
development of today’s mathematics undoubt­
edly proceeds under the aegis of algebra, and 
algebraic concepts and algebraic methods have 
penetrated into the various mathematical theo­
ries themselves, then all that has become possi­
ble only after the works of Emmy Noether. She 
taught us just to think in simple, and thus gen­
eral, terms: homomorphic representation, the 
group or ring with operators, the ideal—and not 
in complicated algebraic calculations, and she 
therefore opened a path to the discovery of alge­
braic regularities where before these regularities 
had been obscured by complicated specific con­
ditions.
It is enough to glance at the work of Pontrya­
gin in the theory of continuous groups, at the just 
completed work of Kolmogoroff in the combi­
natorial topology of locally-bicompact spaces, 

KIMBERLING: Emmy Noether

at the works of Hopf in the theory of continuous 
representations, not to mention the works of van 
der Waerden in algebraic geometry, to feel the 
influence of Emmy Noether’s ideas. This influ­
ence is vividly clear also in the book by H. Weyl, 
Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik.
For all the concreteness and constructiveness 
of Emmy Noether’s various findings, as related 
to the various working periods of her life, there is 
no doubt that her greatest energy and the major 
thrust of her talent were directed toward general 
mathematical conceptions which had to be ax- 
iomatically tinctured to a considerable degree. It 
is quite appropriate to analyze this aspect of her 
work in more detail—especially because now the 
question of general and specific, abstract and 
concrete, axiomatic and constructive, appears 
as one of the most acute questions of mathe­
matical practice. Interest in the problem as a 
whole is sharpened by the fact that, on the one 
hand, mathematical journals are, without doubt 
unnecessarily, burdened with an abundance of 
all sorts of generalizing, axiomatic, and similar 
articles, often devoid of concrete mathematical 
content; while on the other hand, here and there 
declarations are heard that only that which is 
“classical” comprises the true mathematics. Un­
der this latter slogan, important mathematical 
problems are rejected only because they oppose 
one or another habit of thought, or because they 
employ concepts that were not current several 
decades ago ...H. Weyl, in the obituary that I 
have already cited, also raises this general ques­
tion. What he says in this regard penetrates so 
far into the heart of the matter that I cannot but 
quote him in full.
In a conference on topology and abstract alge­
bra as two ways of mathematical understanding, 
in 1931, I said this:
Nevertheless I should not pass over in si­
lence the fact that today the feeling among 
mathematicians is beginning to spread that 
the fertility of these abstracting methods is 
approaching exhaustion. The case is this: 
that all these nice general notions do not 
fall into our laps by themselves. But definite 
concrete problems were first conquered in 
their undivided complexity, single-handed 
by brute force, so to speak. Only afterwards 
the axiomaticians came along and stated: 
instead of breaking in the door with all 
your might and bruising your hands, you 
should have constructed such and such a 
key of skill, and by it you would have been 
able to open the door quite smoothly. But 
they can construct the key only because 
they are able, after the breaking in was 
successful, to study the lock from within 
and without. Before you can generalize, 
formalize and axiomatize, there must be 
a mathematical substance. I think that the 
mathematical substance in the formalizing 
of which we have trained ourselves dur­
ing the last decades, becomes gradually 
exhausted. And so I foresee that the gen­
eration now rising will have a hard time in 
mathematics.
Emmy Noether protested against that: and in­
deed, she could point to the fact that the ax­
iomatic method in her hands had opened new, 
concrete, profound problems and pointed the 
way to their solution.
In this quotation there is much that deserves 
attention: First of all, of course, the indisputable 
point of view that a concrete, I would say, naive, 
seizure of mathematical material must precede 
any axiomatic treatment of it; that, further, the 
axiomatic treatment is only of interest when it 
touches upon real mathematical knowledge (the 
“mathematical substance”, of which H. Weyl 
speaks), and does not appear, to speak crudely, 
as a milling of the wind. All this is indisputable, 
and it is not against this that Emmy Noether 
protested. But she did protest against that pes­
simism which is seen in the last words cited 
by Weyl himself from his speech of 1931; the 
substance of human knowledge, including math­
ematical knowledge, is inexhaustible, at least 
for many long years to come—in this Emmy 
Noether firmly believed. The “substance of the 
last decades” is exhausting itself, but not math­
ematical substance in general, which by a thou­
sand complicated threads is connected with the 
reality of the world’s and mankind’s existence. 
Emmy Noether intensely felt this connection of 
every great mathematical system, even the most 
abstract, with real existence, and even if she did 
not think this connection out philosophically, she 
felt it with the whole being of a learned, lively 
person, who was by no means shackled within 
abstract schemes. For Emmy Noether mathemat­
ics was always knowledge of the world and not a 

356
Algebra and Number Theory
game of symbols, and she avidly protested when 
representatives of those areas of mathematics 
which are immediately concerned with appli­
cations wanted to secure privilege for practical 
knowledge.
In 1924-1925 the school of Emmy Noether 
made one of its most brilliant acquisitions: a 
graduating Amsterdam student, B. L. van der 
Waerden, became her pupil. He was then 22 
years old and one of the brightest young math­
ematical talents in Europe. Van der Waerden 
quickly mastered the theories of Emmy Noether, 
enlarged them with important new findings, and 
like no one else, promoted her ideas. A course 
in the general theory of ideals, given by van der 
Waerden in 1927 in Gottingen, was enormously 
successful. The ideas of Emmy Noether in the 
brilliant exposition of van der Waerden subdued 
public mathematical opinion, first at Gottingen, 
then in the other leading mathematical centers of 
Europe. It was no accident that Emmy Noether 
required a popularizer of her ideas: her lectures 
were intended for a small group of students, 
working in the direction of her own investiga­
tions and listening constantly to her. From ex­
ternal appearances, Emmy Noether’s delivery 
was poor, hurried, and inconsistent; but in her 
lectures there was immense strength of math­
ematical thought and extraordinary animation 
and fervor. Of such a kind, too, were her reports 
to mathematical societies and at meetings. For 
the mathematician who had already been cap­
tured by her ideas and become interested in her 
work, her reports provided much; but the math­
ematician who stood far from her work often 
could understand her exposition only with great 
difficulty.
From 1927 the influence of the ideas of Emmy 
Noether on contemporary mathematics contin­
ually grew, and along with it grew scientific 
praise for the author of those ideas. The direc­
tion of her work at this time moved more and 
more into the region of non-commutative al­
gebra, the theory of representation and of the 
general arithmetic of hypercomplex quantities. 
Two fundamental works of the last period of 
her activity are Hyperkomplexe Grossen und 
Darstellungstheorie (1929) and Nichtcommuta- 
tive Algebra (1933), both published in Math- 
ematische Zeitschrift (vols. 30 and 37). These 
and related works evoked considerable response 
from spokesmen for the algebraic theory of 
numbers, especially from Helmut Hasse. Among 
her pupils during this period of her activities, 
the most outstanding was M. Deuring; in addi­
tion there was a whole row of young, beginning 
mathematicians (Witt, Fitting, and others).
Emmy Noether at last received recognition 
for her ideas. Ifin the years 1923-1925 she had 
to demonstrate the importance of the theories 
that she had developed, in 1932, at the Inter­
national Mathematical Congress in Zurich, she 
was crowned with the laurel of her success. A 
summary of her work read by her at this gath­
ering was the real triumph of the direction she 
represented, and she could look, not only with 
inner satisfaction, but now also with conscious­
ness of full recognition, upon the mathematical 
path that she had traveled. The Zurich congress 
was the high point of her international scientific 
reputation. In a few months there would burst 
over German culture, and in particular over her 
home, which the University of Gottingen had 
become, the catastrophe of the Fascist revolu­
tion, which in a few weeks scattered to the wind 
all that had been built up over a long period of 
decades. One of the greatest tragedies that hu­
man culture has undergone since the time of the 
Renaissance took place, a tragedy which a few 
years ago appeared improbable and impossible 
in the Europe of the twentieth century. One of 
its numerous victims was the Gottingen School 
of Algebra, which had been founded by Emmy 
Noether. Its directress was banished from the 
walls ofthe University; and having lost the right 
to teach, Emmy Noether had to emigrate from 
Germany. She accepted the invitation from the 
women’s college at Bryn Mawr, where she lived 
out the last year and a half of her life.
If what I have just quoted is the main strand of 
the material of Alexandroff’s address, another is his 
description of Emmy Noether’s influence on Soviet 
mathematics and her regard for Soviet ideals:
Emmy Noether was closely connected with 
Moscow. This connection began in 1923, when 
the late Pavel Samuelovitch Urysohn and I first 
arrived in Gottingen and immediately found our­
selves in a mathematical circle whose leader was 
Emmy Noether. The basic traits of the Noether 
school struck us right away: the scientific enthu­
siasm of the directress of the school which was 
passed along to all her students, her deep belief 
in the importance and mathematical fruitfulness 

KIMBERLING: Emmy Noether
357
of her ideas (a belief that was not at all shared 
then by everyone, even in Gottingen), and the ex­
traordinary simplicity and sincerity of relations 
between the head of the school and its members. 
In those days this school was almost entirely 
made up of young Gottingen students; the time 
was still in the future when it would become, for 
its membership and for its acknowledged world­
wide influence, an outstanding international cen­
ter of algebraic thought.
The mathematical interests of Emmy Noether 
(centered at that time in the full swing of her 
work on the general theory of ideals) and the 
mathematical interests of Urysohn and myself 
(centered around the problems of so-called ab­
stract topology) had many points in common and 
quickly led to continual, almost daily, mathemat­
ical discussions. Emmy Noether was interested, 
however, not only in our topological work, but 
also in what had been taking place in the whole 
area of mathematics (and not only in the area of 
mathematics) in Soviet Russia; she did not hide 
her sympathies with our country and our social 
and governmental system, in spite of the fact that 
the manifestation of these sympathies seemed 
outrageous and unseemly to the majority of rep­
resentatives of Western European academic cir­
cles. The matter had reached the point where 
Emmy Noether was literally banished from one 
of the Gottingen boarding houses (where she had 
settled and lived) at the demand of the student 
corporation, resident in the same house, who 
did not want to live under the same roof with a 
“Marxist-inclined Jewess.”
And Emmy Noether was truly gladdened by 
the scientific, and particularly the mathematical 
successes of the Soviet country, since she saw in 
this the final refutation of all the old wives’ tales 
to the effect that “the Bolsheviks are destroying 
culture.” A spokesman of the most abstract areas 
of mathematical science, she distinguished her­
self at the same time by a surprising sensitivity 
in understanding the great historical movements 
of our epoch; always vitally interested in poli­
tics, hating war with her whole being, and hating 
chauvinism in all its manifestations, she never 
in this area knew any vacillation: her sympa­
thies always and unchangingly belonged to the 
Soviet Union, in which she saw the beginning of 
a new era in the history of mankind and firm sup­
port for everything progressive for which human 
thought has lived and lives still.
The scientific and personal friendship which 
sprang up between Emmy Noether and me in 
1923 did not come to an end even with her death. 
Recalling this friendship in his obituary speech, 
Weyl advances the supposition that the general 
system of thought of Emmy Noether did not re­
main without influence on my own topological 
research. I am happy now to affirm the truth of 
Weyl’s supposition: Emmy Noether’s influence 
on my own, and on other topological research 
in Moscow, was very great, and it affected the 
whole essence of our work. In particular, my the­
ory of the continuous breakdown of topological 
spaces arose to a significant degree under the 
influence of conversations with her in Decem­
ber and January of 1925-1926, when we were in 
Holland together.
Emmy Noether spent the winter of 1928-1929 
in Moscow. She taught a course in abstract alge­
bra at the University of Moscow and conducted 
a seminar in algebraic geometry at the Commu­
nist Academy. She quickly established contact 
with a majority of Moscow’s mathematicians, in 
particular and especially, with L. S. Pontryagin 
and O. U. Schmidt. It is not difficult to trace the 
influence of Emmy Noether on the mathemati­
cal talent of L. S. Pontryagin; a strong algebraic 
note in his work was undoubtedly benefited in its 
development by contact with Emmy Noether. In 
Moscow, Emmy Noether very easily fit herself in 
with our life, both in her scientific and her non­
professional relationships. She lived in a mod­
est room in the KSU hostel near the Crimean 
Bridge, and most of the time she walked to the 
University. She was very much interested in the 
life of our country, especially in the life of Soviet 
young people and students.
In the winter of 1928-1929 I was as usual 
on a visit to Smolensk and was giving lec­
tures on algebra at the Pedagogical Institute 
there. Inspired by my continual conversations 
with Emmy Noether, I gave my lectures along 
the lines established by her. Among my stu­
dents there, A. G. Kurosh immediately stood out, 
and the theories that I was expounding, wholly 
steeped as they were in Emmy Noether’s ideas, 
appealed very much to him. In this way, through 
my teaching, Emmy Noether acquired a disci­
ple who has since grown into an independent 
and learned man, as is well known, and whose 
works through the present day have proceeded 
in the principal circle of ideas created by her.

358
Algebra and Number Theory
In the spring of 1929, she left Moscow for 
Gottingen with the firm intention of coming to 
visit us again in the near future. Several times 
she was close to carrying out that intention, and 
closest to doing so in the last year of her life. Af­
ter her exile from Germany, she seriously con­
sidered a final trip to Moscow, and I exchanged 
letters with her in this regard. She clearly under­
stood that nowhere could she find the means to 
create a new brilliant mathematical school in ex­
change for the one that had been taken from her 
in Gottingen. I had already conducted talks with 
the Narkompros [The People’s Commissariat for 
Education] about assigning her a chair at the 
University of Moscow. However, at the Com­
missariat, as usual, they were slow in making a 
decision, and they did not give me a final answer. 
Meanwhile, time passed, and Emmy Noether, 
deprived even of that modest work which she 
had in Gottingen, could wait no longer and had to 
accept the invitation of the women’s college . . .
Such was Emmy Noether, the greatest of 
women mathematicians, a great scientist, an 
amazing teacher, and an unforgettable per­
son . . . True, Weyl has said that “the Graces did 
not stand at her cradle,” and he is right, if one 
has in mind the generally known heaviness of her 
appearance. But here Weyl is speaking of her not 
only as a great scholar, but also as a great woman. 
And she was that—her femininity appeared in 
that gentle and subtle lyricism which lay at the 
heart of the far-flung but never superficial con­
cerns which she maintained for people, for her 
profession, and for the interests of all mankind. 
She loved people, science, life, with all the 
warmth, all the cheerfulness, all the unselfish­
ness, and all the tenderness of which a deeply 
sensitive—and feminine—soul is capable.

In America
Among the scientists who left Germany during the 
early thirties and sooner or later took refuge in the 
United States were E. Artin, R. Courant, P. Debye, M. 
Dehn, A. Einstein, P. Ewald, W. Feller, J. Franck, K. 
Friedrichs, K. Godel, E. Hellinger, O. Neugebauer, 
J. von Neumann, Emmy Noether, L. Nordheim, O. 
Ore, G. Polya, G. Szego, A. Tarski, Olga Taussky 
(Todd), H. Weyl, and E. Wigner.
Arrangements were made for Emmy Noether to 
teach at Bryn Mawr College, just outside Philadel­
phia, beginning in the autumn of 1933. Conveniently 
close was the Institute for Advanced Study at Prince­
ton, where, beginning in February, 1934, she gave 
weekly lectures. At the Institute were Einstein, Weyl, 
Oswald Veblen, and Abraham Flexner.
Emmy Noether returned to Germany to visit during 
the summer of 1934 and then resumed her work at 
Bryn Mawr and Princeton in the early fall. Richard 
Brauer had joined the Institute, and after her lectures, 
she usually visited with Brauer, Weyl, and Veblen 
before returning to Bryn Mawr.
One of Emmy Noether’s associates at Bryn Mawr 
was Grace Shover (Quinn), now a professor at the 
American University. Awarded the Emmy Noether 
Fellowship for post-doctoral study, she became ac­
quainted with Emmy Noether in September, 1934. 
There were three other graduate students in mathe­
matics. Marie Weiss of Newcomb College held the 
Emmy Noether Scholarship. Olga Taussky held the 
foreign fellowship. Ruth Stauffer (McKee) was a 
doctoral candidate, Emmy Noether’s only American 
Ph.D. student.
Professor Quinn recalls that Emmy Noether
was around 5'4" tall and was slightly rotund in 
build. Her complexion was swarthy. Her dark 
hair, flecked with grey, was cropped short. She 
wore thick glasses to cover her near-sighted eyes, 
and she had a way of turning her head aside and 
looking into the distance when trying to think 
while talking. Her looks and dress were most 
unconventional, such as to attract attention, but 
such a result was far from her thoughts. She was 
sincere, straightforward, kindly, thoughtful, and 
considerate.
Her lectures were delivered in broken English.
She often lapsed into her native German when 
she was bothered by some idea in lecturing. She 
loved to walk. She would take her students off 
for a jaunt on a Saturday afternoon. On these 
trips she would become so absorbed in her con­
versation on mathematics that she would forget 
about the traffic and her students would need to 
protect her.
The chairman of the Bryn Mawr mathematics de­
partment was Anna Pell Wheeler, now deceased. Hav­
ing studied at Gottingen a few years before receiv­
ing her doctorate from the University of Chicago in 
1910, Professor Wheeler became a very close friend 
of Emmy Noether. In this connection, Mrs. McKee 
has written:

KIMBERLING: Emmy Noether
359
Probably the greatest difference in her life in 
America was her close friendship with the head 
of the mathematics department. In Germany at 
that time women were neither expected nor en­
couraged to study. It was rather assumed that 
their role in life was that of a homemaker. There­
fore, to have as a friend a woman who was a 
nationally recognized mathematician who had 
earlier studied at Gottingen and who thoroughly 
understood the problems of a woman scholar 
in Germany, was a unique experience for Miss 
Noether . . . Many of Miss Noether’s former stu­
dents and colleagues stopped to see [her] in Bryn 
Mawr and she always took them to see her ‘good 
friend.’

Missing letters recovered
Together with Jean Cavailles, Emmy Noether edited 
the correspondence between Richard Dedekind and 
Georg Cantor. Although completed in March, 1933, 
the book, Briefwechsels—G. Cantor und R. Dedekind, 
did not appear until 1937, when it was published by 
Hermann of Paris.
The Cantor-Dedekind letters were still in Emmy 
Noether’s possession when she died, along with corre­
spondence from G. Frobenius and H. Weber (Hilbert’s 
predecessor at Gottingen). A representative of the law 
firm which settled Emmy Noether’s estate wrote to her 
brother Fritz, exiled in Tomsk, asking what should be 
done with the letters. Professor Noether’s reply was 
that they be returned to their (unspecified) owner. 
This directive was not carried out. Instead, the letters 
lay lost in the files of a Philadelphia law office, until, 
after some 33 years, a member of the firm wrote me, 
“Inasmuch as you are researching her life, a rather 
valuable bit of information was unearthed by me in 
going through the Estate file. Under separate cover 
you will shortly receive them via parcel post. I sup­
pose you will be agreeable to the modest charge of 
$25.00...”
I had no idea what the “valuable bit of information” 
was, but as promised, the letter collection arrived 
a few days later. Included with the famous Cantor- 
Dedekind letters, a few of whose paragraphs may be 
found in English in Sherman K. Stein’s popular Math­
ematics: The Man-made Universe (Freeman), are 47 
letters written by Weber in Konigsberg and Heidel­
berg to Dedekind in Braunschweig. Together with 20 
post cards, telegrams, and printed circulars, these let­
ters span the years 1876-1879.
Three letters each by Frobenius and Dedekind are 
dated 1882-1883. Their remaining 38 letters and 
7 postcards are dated from 1895 to 1901. Most were 
written in 1886. Their content is more mathematical 
than that of the Weber letters. A few reach a length 
of 20 pages. I counted a total of 178 pages from 
Frobenius to Dedekind and 113 from Dedekind to 
Frobenius.
At present, the letters are kept in the Clifford 
Memorial Library at the University of Evansville.

A Marvelous Proof”

American Mathematical Monthly 101 (1994), 203-222
No one really knows when it was that the story of what 
came to be known as “Fermat’s Last Theorem” really 
started. Presumably it was sometime in the late 1630s 
that Pierre de Fermat made that famous inscription 
in the margin of Diophantus’s Arithmetica claiming 
to have found “a marvelous proof”. It seems now, 
however, that the story may be coming close to an end. 
In June 1993, Andrew Wiles announced that he could 
prove Fermat’s assertion. Since then, difficulties seem 
to have arisen, but Wiles’s strategy is fundamentally 
sound and may yet succeed.
The argument sketched by Wiles is an artful blend 
of various topics that have been, for years now, the 
focus of intensive research in number theory: elliptic 
curves, modular forms, and Galois representations. 
The goal of this article is to give mathematicians who 
are not specialists in the subject access to a general 
outline of the strategy proposed by Wiles. Of neces­
sity, we concentrate largely on background material 
giving first a brief description of the relevant top­
ics, and only afterwards describe how they come to­
gether and relate to Fermat’s assertion. Readers who 
are mainly interested in the structure of the argument 
and who do not need or want too many details about 
the background concepts may want to skim through 
Section 2, then concentrate on Section 3. Our discus­
sion includes a few historical remarks, but history is 
not our main intention, and therefore we only touch 
on a few highlights that are relevant to our goal of 
describing the main ideas in Wiles’s attack on the 
problem.
1 
Preliminaries
We all know the basic statement that Fermat wrote 
in his margin. The claim is that for any exponent 
n > 3 there are no non-trivial integer solutions of 
the equation xn + yn = zn . (Here, “non-trivial” will 
just mean that none of the integers x, y, and z will be 
equal to zero.) Fermat claims, in his marginal note, to 
have found “a marvelous proof” of this fact, which 
unfortunately would not fit in the margin.
This statement became known as “Fermat’s Last 
Theorem”, not, apparently, due to any belief that the 
“theorem” was the last one found by Fermat, but 
rather due to the fact that by the 1800s all of the other 
assertions made by Fermat had been either proved or 
refuted. This one was the last one left open, whence 
the name. In what follows, we will adopt the abbre­
viation FLT for Fermat’s statement, and we will refer 
to “xn + yn = zn” as the Fermat equation.
The first important results relating to FLT were 
theorems that showed that Fermat’s claim was true 
for specific values of n. The first of these is due to 
Fermat himself: very few of his proofs were ever made 
public, but in one that was he shows that the equation 
x4 + y4 = z2
has no non-trivial integer solutions. Since any solu­
tion of the Fermat equation with exponent 4 gives a 
solution of this equation also, it follows that Fermat’s 
claim is true for n =4.
Once that is done, it is easy to see that we can 
restrict our attention to the case in which n is a prime 
number. To see this, notice that any number greater 
than 2 is either divisible by 4 or by an odd prime, and 
then notice that we can rewrite an equation
xmk + ymk = zmk
as
(xm)k + (ym)k = (zm)k,
so that any solution for n = mk yields at once a 
solution for n = k.Ifn is not prime, we can always 
choose k to be either 4 or an odd prime, so that the 
problem reduces to these two cases.

GOUVEA: A Marvelous Proof
In the 1750s, Euler became interested in Fermat’s 
work on number theory, and began a systematic in­
vestigation of the subject. In particular, he considered 
the Fermat equation for n =3and n =4, and once 
again proved that there were no solutions. (Euler’s 
proof for n = 3 depends on studying the “numbers” 
one gets by adjoining ^—3 to the rationals, one of 
the first instances where one meets “algebraic num­
bers”.) A good historical account of Euler’s work is 
to be found in [35]. In the following years, several 
other mathematicians extended this step by step to 
n =5, 7,... A general account of the fortunes of 
FLT during this time can be found in [24].
Since then, ways for testing Fermat’s assertion for 
any specific value of n have been developed, and the 
range of exponents for which the result was known to 
be true kept getting pushed up. As of 1992, one knew 
that FLT was true for exponents up to four million 
(by work of S. Buhler).
It is clear, however, that to get general results one 
needs a general method, i.e., a way to connect the 
Fermat equation (for any n) with some mathemati­
cal context which would allow for its analysis. Over 
the centuries, there have been many attempts at do­
ing this; we mention only the two biggest successes 
(omitting quite a lot of very good work, for which 
see, for example, [24]).
The first of these is the work of E. Kummer, who, in 
the mid-nineteenth century established a link between 
FLT and the theory of cyclotomic fields. This link al­
lowed Kummer to prove Fermat’s assertion when the 
exponent was a prime that had a particularly nice 
property (Kummer named such primes regular). The 
proof is an impressive bit of work, and was the first 
general result about the Fermat equation. Unfortu­
nately, while in numerical tests a good percentage of 
primes seem to turn out to be regular, no one has 
yet managed to prove even that there are infinitely 
many regular primes. (And, ironically, we do have a 
proof that there are infinitely many primes that are 
not regular.) A discussion of Kummer’s approach can 
be found in [24]; for more detailed information on 
the cyclotomic theory, one could start with [33].
The second accomplishment we should mention is 
that of G. Faltings, who, in the early 1980s, proved 
Mordell’s conjecture about rational solutions to cer­
tain kinds of polynomial equations. Applying this to 
the Fermat equations, one sees that for any n> 4 one 
can have only a finite number of non-trivial solutions. 
Once again, this is an impressive result, but its im­
pact on FLT itself turns out to be minor because we 
have not yet found a way to actually determine how 
361
many solutions should exist. For an introduction to 
Faltings’s work, check [7], which contains an English 
translation of the original paper.
Wiles’s attack on the problem turns on another such 
linkage, also developed in the early 1980s by G. Frey, 
J.-P. Serre, and K. A. Ribet. This one connects FLT 
with the theory of elliptic curves, which has been 
much studied throughout this century, and thereby 
to all the machinery of modular forms and Galois 
representations that is the central theme of Wiles’s 
work. The main goal of this paper is to describe this 
connection and then to explain how Wiles attempts to 
use it to prove FLT.
Notation We will use the usual symbols Q for the 
rational numbers and Z for the integers. The integers 
modulo m will be written as Z/mZ; we will most of­
ten need them when m is a power of a prime number 
p.Ifp is prime, then Z/pZ is a field, and we com­
memorate that fact by using an alternative notation: 
Fp = Z/pZ.
2 
The actors
We begin by introducing the main actors in the drama. 
First, we briefly (and very informally) introduce the 
p-adic numbers. These are not so much actors in the 
play as they are part of the stage set: tools to allow 
the actors to do their job. Then we give brief and im­
pressionistic outlines of the theories of elliptic curves, 
modular forms, and Galois representations.
p-adic numbers
The p-adic numbers are an extension of the field of 
rational numbers which are, in many ways, analogous 
to the real numbers. Like the real numbers, they can 
be obtained by defining a notion of distance between 
rational numbers, and then passing to the completion 
with respect to that distance. For our purposes, we do 
not really need to know much about them. The crucial 
facts are:
1. For each prime number p there exists a field 
Qp , which is complete with respect to a certain 
notion of distance and contains the rational num­
bers as a dense subfield.
2. Proximity in the p-adic metric is closely related 
to congruence properties modulo powers of p. 
For example, two integers whose difference is 
divisible by pn are “close” in the p-adic world 
(the bigger the n the closer they are).

362
Algebra and Number Theory
3. As a consequence, one can think of the p-adics 
as encoding congruence information: whenever 
one knows something modulo pn for every n, 
one can translate this into p-adic information, 
and vice-versa.
4. The field Qp contains a subring Zp , which is 
called the ring of p-adic integers. (In fact, Zp is 
the closure of Z in Qp .)
There is, of course, a lot more to say, and the reader 
will find it said in many references, such as [15], 
[3], [1], and even [12]. The p-adic numbers were 
introduced by K. Hensel (a student of Kummer), and 
many of the basic ideas seem to appear, in veiled form, 
in Kummer’s work; since then, they have become a 
fundamental tool in number theory.
Elliptic curves
Elliptic curves are a special kind of algebraic curves 
which have a very rich arithmetical structure. (Per­
haps it’s best to dispel the obvious confusion right 
up front: ellipses are not elliptic curves. In fact, the 
connection between elliptic curves and ellipses is a 
rather subtle one. What happens is that elliptic curves 
over the complex numbers are the “natural habitat” of 
the elliptic integrals which arise, among other places, 
when one attempts to compute the arc length of an 
ellipse. For us, this connection will be of very little 
importance.)
There are several fancy ways of defining elliptic 
curves, but for our purposes we can just define them 
as the set of points satisfying a polynomial equation 
of a certain form.
To be specific, consider an equation of the form 
y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6 , 
where the ai are integers (there is a reason for the 
strange choice of indices on the ai but we won’t go 
into it here). We want to consider the set of points 
(x, y) which satisfy this equation. Since we are doing 
number theory, we don’t want to tie ourselves down 
too seriously as to what sort of numbers x and y are: 
it makes sense to take them in the real numbers, in 
the complex numbers, in the rational numbers, and 
even, for any prime number p,inFp (in which case 
we think of the equation as a congruence modulo p). 
We will describe the situation by saying that there is 
an underlying object which we call the curve E and, 
for each one of the possible fields of definition for 
points (x, y), we call the set of possible solutions the 
“points of E” over that field. So, if we consider all 
possible complex solutions, we get the set E(C) of 
the complex points of E. Similarly, we can consider 
the real points E(R), the rational points E(Q), and 
even the Fp -points E(Fp ).
We haven’t yet said when it is that such equations 
define elliptic curves. The condition is simply that the 
curve be smooth. If we consider the real or complex 
points, this means exactly what one would expect — 
the set of points contains no “singular” points, that 
is, at every point there is a well-defined tangent line. 
We know, from elementary analysis, that an equa­
tion f(x, y) = 0 defines a smooth curve exactly when 
there are no points on the curve at which both partial 
derivatives of f vanish. In other words, the curve will 
be smooth if there are no common solutions of the 
equations
f(x, y)=0
dft > n
dX (x,y ) = 0
df. 
> n
— (x,y) = 0. 
dy
Notice, though, that this condition is really alge­
braic (the derivatives are derivatives of polynomi­
als, and hence can be taken formally). In fact, we 
can boil it down to a (complicated) polynomial con­
dition in the ai. There is a polynomial A( E) = 
A( a 1, a2,a3, a4,a6) in the ai such that E is smooth 
if and only if A(E) =0. This gives us the means 
to give a completely formal definition (which makes 
sense even over Fp). The number A(E) is called the 
discriminant of the curve E.
Definition 1. Let K be a field. An elliptic curve over 
K is an algebraic curve determined by an equation 
of the form
y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6 , 
where each of the ai belongs to K and such that 
A(a1,a2,a3,a4,a6) =0.
Specialists would want to rephrase that definition 
to allow other equations, provided that a well-chosen 
change of variables could transform them into equa­
tions of this form.
It’s about time to give some examples. To make 
things easier, let us focus on the special case in which 
the equation is of the form y2 = g(x), with g(x) a 
cubic polynomial (in other words, we’re assuming 
a1 = a3 =0). In this case, it’s very easy to determine 
when there can be singular points, and even what sort 
of singular points they will be. If we put f(x, y)= 
y2 - g(x), then we have
d^ 
, ,df
dx (x, y) = -g (x) and dy (x, y) = 2y,

GOUVEA: A Marvelous Proof
363
Figure 1
and the condition for a point to be “bad” becomes
y2 = g (x) 
- g (x) = 0 
2 y = 0,
which boils down to y2 = g (x) = g (x) = 0. In other 
words, a point will be bad exactly when its y- 
coordinate is zero and its x-coordinate is a double 
root of the polynomial g(x). Since g(x) is of degree 
3, this gives us only three possibilities:
• g (x) has no multiple roots, and the equation defines 
an elliptic curve;
• g (x) has a double root;
• g (x) has a triple root.
Let’s look at one example of each case, and graph the 
real points of the corresponding curve.
For the first case, consider the curve given by y2 = 
x3 - x. Its graph is in Figure 1a (to be precise, this 
is the graph of its real points). A different example of 
the same case is given y2 = x3 + x; see Figure 1b. 
(The reason these look so different is that we are only 
looking at the real points of the curve; in fact, over the 
complex numbers these two curves are isomorphic.)
When there are “bad” points, what has happened is 
that either two roots of g(x) have “come together” or 
all three roots have done so. In the first case, we get 
a loop. At the crossing point, which is usually called 
a node, the curve has two different tangent lines; see 
Figure 1c, where we have the graph of the equation 
y2 = x3 + x2 (double root at zero).
In the final case, not only have all three roots of 
g(x) come together, but also the two tangents in the 
node have come together to form a sort of “double 
tangent” (this can be made precise with some easy 
algebra of polynomials, but it’s more fun to think of it 
geometrically). The graph now looks like Figure 1d, 
and we call this kind of singular point a cusp.
How does all this relate to the discriminant A we 
mentioned above? Well, if r1, r2, and r3 are the roots 
of the polynomial g(x), the discriminant for the equa­
tion y2 = g(x) turns out to be
A=K (r1 - r2)2 (r1 - r3)2 (r2 - r3)2 ,
where K is a constant. This does just what we want: 
if two of the roots are equal, it is zero, and if not, not. 
Furthermore, itis not too hard to see that A is actually 

364
Algebra and Number Theory
a polynomial in the coefficients of g(x), which is what 
we claimed. In other words, all that the discriminant 
is doing for us is giving a direct algebraic procedure 
for determining whether there are singular points.
While this analysis applies specifically to curves of 
the form y2 = g(x), it actually extends to all equa­
tions of the sort we are considering: there is at most 
one singular point, and it is either a node or a cusp.
One final geometric point: as one can see from 
the graphs, these curves are not closed. It is often 
convenient to “close them up.” This is done by adding 
one more point to the curve, usually referred to as the 
point at infinity. This can be done in a precise way 
by embedding the curve into the projective plane, 
and then taking the closure. For us, however, the only 
important thing is to remember that we actually have 
one extra point on our curves. (One should imagine it 
to be “infinitely far up the y-axis,” but keep in mind 
that there is only one “point at infinity” on the y-axis, 
so that it is also “infinitely far down.”)
With some examples in hand, we can proceed to 
deeper waters. In order to understand the connection 
we are going to establish between elliptic curves and 
FLT, we need to review quite a large portion of what 
is known about the rich arithmetic structure of these 
curves.
The first thing to note is that one can define an 
operation on the set of points of an elliptic curve that 
makes it, in a natural way, an abelian group. This 
operation is usually referred to as “addition”. The 
identity element of this group turns out to be the 
point at infinity (it would be more honest to say that 
we choose the point at infinity for this role).
We won’t enter into the details of how one adds 
points on an elliptic curve. In fact, there are several 
equivalent definitions, each of which has its advan­
tages! The reader should see the references for more 
details of how it is done (and the proof that one does 
get a group). The main thing to know about the defini­
tion, for now, is that it preserves the field of definition 
of the points: adding two rational points gives a ratio­
nal point, and so on.
What this means is that for every choice of a base 
field, we can get a group of points on the curve with 
coordinates in that field, so that in fact an elliptic 
curve gives us a whole bunch of groups, which are, 
of course all related (though sometimes related in 
a mysterious way). So, given an E, we can look at 
the complex points E(C), which form a complex Lie 
group which is topologically a torus, orwe can look at 
the real Lie group E(R), which turns out to be either 
isomorphic to the circle S1 or to the direct product 
Z/2Z x S1. (Look back at the examples above; can 
you see which is which?)
From an arithmetical point of view, however, the 
most interesting of these groups is the group of 
rational points, E(Q). A point P e E(Q) gives 
a solution in the rational numbers of our cubic 
equation, and looking for such solutions is, of course, 
an example of solving a Diophantine equation, a sort 
of problem that is quite important in number theory. 
What is especially nice about E(Q) is the fact, proved 
by L. Mordell (and extended by A. Weil) in the 1920s, 
that it is a finitely generated abelian group. What 
this means is just the following: there is a finite list 
of rational points on the curve (or, if one prefers, of 
rational solutions to the equation) such that any other 
rational solution is obtained by combining (using the 
addition law) these points with one another. These 
points are called the generators of the group E(Q), 
which is usually called the Mordell-Weil group of E.
The curves we considered earlier have very simple 
Mordell-Weil groups. For the curve given by y2 = 
x3 - x (Figure 1a), it has four points, and for y2 = 
x3 + x (Figure 1b) it has two. It is easy, though, to 
give more interesting examples. Here is one, chosen 
at random from [6]: if E is the curve defined by 
y2 + y = x3 - x2 - 2x +2, the Mordell-Weil group 
E(Q) is an infinite cyclic group, generated by the 
point (2, 1).
Of course, knowing that we have a finitely gener­
ated group raises the obvious question of estimating 
or computing the number of generators needed and 
of how one might go about actually finding these 
generating points. Both of these questions are still 
open, even though there are rather precise conjec­
tures about what their answers should be. For many 
specific curves, both the number and the generators 
themselves have been completely worked out (see, for 
example, the tables in [6]), but the general problem 
still seems quite difficult.
A fundamental component of the conjectural plan 
for determining the generators is considering, for 
each prime number p, the reduction of our curve 
modulo p. The basic idea is quite simple: since our 
equation has integer coefficients, we can reduce it 
modulo p and look for solutions in the field Fp of 
integers modulo p. This should give a finite group 
E(Fp), whose structure should be easier to analyze 
than that of the big group E(Q). It’s a rather simple 
idea, but several complications arise.
The main thing that can go wrong is that the re­
duction modulo p may fail to be an elliptic curve. 
That is actually very easy to see. To tell whether the 

GOUVEA: A Marvelous Proof
365
curve is elliptic (that is, if it has no singular points), 
one needs to look at A. It is perfectly possible for 
A to be non-zero (so that the curve over Q is ellip­
tic) while being at the same time congruent to zero 
modulo p (so that the curve over Fp is singular). This 
phenomenon is called bad reduction, and it is easy to 
come up with examples. One might take p =5, and 
look at the curve y2 = x3 - 5. This turns out to be 
an elliptic curve over Q, but its reduction modulo 5 
is going to have a cusp. One says, then, that the curve 
has bad reduction at 5. In fact, the discriminant turns 
out to be A = -10,800, which is clearly divisible by 
2, 3 and 5, so that the curve has bad reduction at 
each of these. (In each case, it’s easy to verify that the 
reduced curve has a cusp.)
We want to clarify the possible types of reduction, 
but there is one further glitch that we have to deal 
with before we can do so. To see what it is, consider 
the curve y2 = x3 - 625x. At first glance, it seems 
even worse than the first, and the discriminant, which 
turns out to be A = -15,625,000,000, looks very 
divisible by 5. But look what we can do: let’s change 
variables by setting x =25u =52u and y = 125v = 
53v. Then our equation becomes
(53v)2 = (52u)3 - 625(52u),
which simplifies to
56v2 = 56u3 - 56u,
and hence to
v2 = u3 - u,
which is not only a nice elliptic curve, but has good 
reduction at 5. In other words, this example shows 
that curves which are isomorphic over Q can have 
very different reductions modulo p.
It turns out that among all the possible equations 
for our curve, one can choose an equation that is mini­
mal, in the sense that its discriminant will be divisible 
by fewer primes than the discriminant for other equa­
tions. Since the primes that divide the discriminant 
are the primes of bad reduction, a minimal equation 
will have reduction properties that are as good as pos­
sible. When studying the reduction properties of the 
curve, then, one must also pass to such a minimal 
equation (and there are algorithms to do this).
Well, then, suppose we have done so, and have an 
elliptic curve E given by a minimal equation. Then 
we can classify all prime numbers into three groups:
• Primes of good reduction: those which do not di­
vide the discriminant of the minimal equation. The 
curve modulo p is an elliptic curve, and we have a 
group E(Fp ).
• Primes of multiplicative reduction: those for which 
the curve modulo p has a node. If the singu­
lar point is (x0 ,y0 ), it turns out that the set 
E(Fp )\{(x0 ,y0 )} has a group structure, and is 
isomorphic to the multiplicative group Fp \{0}.
• Primes of additive reduction: those for which the 
curve modulo p has a cusp. If the singular point is 
(x0,y0), the set E(Fp)\{(x0,y0)} once again has 
a group structure, and is isomorphic to the additive 
group Fp .
No curve can have good reduction everywhere, so 
there will always be some bad primes, but the feel­
ing one should get is that multiplicative reduction 
is somehow not as bad as additive reduction. There 
are various technical reasons for this, which we don’t 
really need to go into. Instead, we codify the infor­
mation about the reduction types of the curve into a 
number, called the conductor of the curve. We define 
the conductor to be a product N = pn(p), where
{
0 if E has good reduction at p
1 if E has multiplicative reduction at p 
> 2 if E has additive reduction at p.
(The exact value for n(p) for the case of additive 
reduction depends on some rather subtle properties 
of the reduction modulo such primes; most of the 
time, the exponent is 2.) The result is that one can 
tell, by looking at the conductor, exactly what the 
reduction type ofE at each prime is.
The elliptic curves we will want to consider are 
those whose reduction properties are as good as pos­
sible. Since good reduction at all primes is not pos­
sible, we opt for the next best thing: good reduction 
at almost all primes, multiplicative reduction at the 
others. Such curves are called semistable:
Definition 2. An elliptic curve is called semistable if 
all ofits reductions are either good or multiplicative. 
Equivalently, a curve is semistable if its conductor is 
square-free.
A crucial step in the application of Wiles’s theo­
rem to FLT will be verifying that a certain curve is 
semistable. Just to give us some reference points, let’s 
look at a few examples.
1. Let E1 be the curve y2 = x3 - 5, which we con­
sidered above. One checks that this equation is 
minimal, and that the curve has additive reduction 

366
Algebra and Number Theory
at 2, 3, and 5, so that it is not semistable. The con­
ductor turns out to be equal to 10,800 (essentially, 
the same as the discriminant!).
2. Let E2 be the curve y2 + y = x3 + x. This has 
multiplicative reduction at 7 and 13 (checking this 
makes a nice exercise) and good reduction at all 
other primes. Hence, E2 is semistable and its con­
ductor is 91.
3. Let E3 be the curve y2 = x3 + x2 +2x +2 
(which is minimal). This has discriminant A = 
-1152 = -27 • 32, so that the bad primes are 2 
and 3. It turns out that the reduction is multiplica­
tive at 3 and additive at 2, and the conductor is 
384: the curve is not semistable.
4. The main example for the purpose at hand: Let a, b 
and c be relatively prime integers such that a + b + 
c =0. Consider the curve Eabc whose equation 
is y2 = x(x - a)(x + b). Depending on what a, b 
and c are, this equation may or may not be minimal, 
so let’s make the additional assumption that a = 
-1 (mod 4) and that b = 0 (mod 32). In this case, 
the equation is not minimal. A minimal equation 
for this curve turns out to be
2 
3 b - a - 1 2 ab
y + xy = x +------- 4----- x - 16,
which we get by the change in variables x ^ 
4x, y ^ 8y + 4x. One can then compute that the 
discriminant is A=a2 b2 c2 /256 (not surprising: 
a constant times the product of the squares of the 
differences of the roots of the original cubic), and 
that the curve is semistable. The primes of bad 
reduction are those that divide abc (this would be 
easy to see directly from the equation, by check­
ing when there is a multiple root modulo p), and 
therefore the conductor is equal to the product of 
the primes that divide abc:
n = n p 
p |abc
(this number is sometimes called the radical of 
abc). We will be using curves of the form Eabc 
(for very special a, b and c) when we make the 
link with FLT.
We need a final bit of elliptic curve theory. It is 
interesting to look at the number of points in the 
groups E(Fp) as p ranges through the primes of good 
reduction for E. Part of the motivation for this is the 
reasoning that if the group E(Q) is large (i.e., there 
are many rational solutions), one would expect that 
for many choices of the prime p, many of the points in 
E(Q) would survive reduction modulo p, so that the 
group E(Fp ) would be large. Therefore, one would 
like to make some sort of conjecture that said that if 
the E (Fp ) are very large for many primes p, then the 
group E(Q) will be large.
Elaborating and refining this idea leads to the con­
jecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, which we 
won’t get into here. But even this coarse version sug­
gests that variation of the size of E(Fp) as p runs 
through the primes should tell us something about 
the arithmetic on the curve. To “encode” this varia­
tion, we start by observing that the (projective) line 
over Fp has exactly p + 1 points (the p elements ofFp 
plus the point at infinity). We take this as the “stan­
dard” number of points fora curve over Fp and, when 
we look at E(Fp), record how far from the standard 
we are. To be precise, given an elliptic curve E and a 
prime number p at which E has good reduction, we 
define a number ap by the equation
#E(Fp )=p +1 - ap .
For primes of bad reduction, we extend the definition 
in a convenient way; it turns out that we get ap = ±1 
when the reduction is multiplicative (with a precise 
rule to decide which) and ap =0when it is additive.
The usual way to “record” the sequence of the ap 
is to use them to build a complex analytic function 
called the L-function of the curve E. It then is nat­
ural to conjecture that this L-function has properties 
similar to those of other L-functions that arise in 
number theory, and that one can read off properties 
of E from properties of its L-function. This is a huge 
story which we cannot tell in this article, but which is 
really very close to some of the issues which we do 
discuss later on. Suffice it to say, for now, that we get 
a function
L(E,s) = E
where the ap are exactly the same as the ones just 
introduced, the an are determined from the ap by 
“Euler product” expansion for the L-function, and 
the series can be shown to converge when (s) > 3. 
The L-function is conjectured to have an analytic con­
tinuation to the whole complex plane and to satisfy a 
certain functional equation.
It is time to introduce the other actors in the play 
and to explain how they relate to elliptic curves. The 
reader who would like to delve further into this theory 
has a lot to choose from. As an informal introduction, 
one could look at J. Silverman’s article [30], which 

GOUVEA: A Marvelous Proof
367
relates elliptic curves to “sums of two cubes” and 
Ramanujan’s taxicab number. Various introductory 
texts are available, including [4], [13], [14], [29], and 
[32]. Each of these has particular strengths; the last 
is intended as an undergraduate text. In addition to 
these and other texts, the interested reader might en­
joy looking at symbolic manipulation software that 
will handle elliptic curves well. Such capabilities are 
built into GP-PARI and SIMATH, and can be added 
to Mathematica by using Silverman’s EllipticCurve- 
Calc package (which is what we used for most of the 
computations in this paper), and to Maple by using 
Connell’s Apecs package. See [2], [36], [32], [5].
Modular forms
Modular forms start their lives as analytic objects (or, 
to be more honest, as objects of group representation 
theory), but end up playing a very intriguing role in 
number theory. In this section, we will very briefly 
sketch out their definition and explain their relation 
to elliptic curves.
Let h = {x + iy : y>0} be the complex upper 
half-plane. As is well known (and, in any case, easy 
to check), matrices in SL2 (Z) act on h in the following 
way. If y e SL2 (Z) is the matrix
y=(cd)
(so that c, b, c andd are integers and cd - bc =1), 
and z e h, we define
Y • z = cz + b 
cz +d .
It is easy to check that if z e h then y • z e h, and 
that y 1 • (Y2 • z) = (Y1Y2 ) • z•
We want to consider functions on the upper half­
plane which are “as invariant as possible” under this 
action, perhaps when restricted to a smaller group. 
The subgroups we will need to consider are the “con­
gruence subgroups” which we get by adding a con­
gruence condition to the entries of the matrix. Thus, 
for any positive integer N , we want to look at the 
group
ro(N) = (y = Cbb)l e SL2(Z) : c = 0(mod N)) . 
cd
We are now ready to begin defining modular 
forms. They will be functions f : h ^ C, holomor­
phic, which “transform well” under one of the sub­
groups r0(N). To be specific, we require that there 
exist an integer k such that
f ( —+1) = (cz + d) kf(z).
cz +d
Applying this formula to the special case in which the 
matrix is
(0 
1)
shows that any such function must satisfy f(z+1) = 
f (z), and hence must have a Fourier expansion
00
f (z)= 
anqn, where q = e2niz.
n= -0
We require that this expression in fact only involve 
non-negative powers of q (and in fact we extend that 
requirement to a finite number of other, similar, ex­
pansions, which the experts call the “Fourier expan­
sions at the other cusps”). A function satisfying all 
these constraints is called a modular form of weight 
k on ro(N).
We will need to consider one special subspace of 
the space of modular forms of a given weight and 
level. Rather than having a Fourier expansion with 
non-negative powers only, we might require positive 
powers only (in the main expansion and in the ones 
“at the other cusps”). We call such modular forms 
cusp forms; they turn out to be the more interesting 
part of the space of modular forms.
Finally, one must make a remark on the relation 
between the theory at various levels: if N divides M, 
then every form of level N (and weight k) gives rise 
to (a number of) forms of level M (and the same 
weight). The subspace generated by all forms of level 
M and weight k which arise in this manner (from the 
various divisors ofM) is called the space of old forms 
of level M . With respect to a natural inner product 
structure on the space of modular forms, one can then 
take the orthogonal complement of the space of old 
forms. This complement is called the space of new 
forms, which are the ones we will be most interested 
in.
What really makes the theory of modular forms 
interesting for arithmetic is the existence ofa family 
of commuting operators on each space of modular 
forms, called the Hecke operators. We will not go into 
the definition of these operators (they are quite natural 
from the point of view of representation theory); for 
us the crucial things will be:
• For each positive integer n relatively prime to the 
level N, there is a Hecke operator Tn acting on the 

368
Algebra and Number Theory
space of modular forms of fixed weight and level 
N.
• The Hecke operators commute with each other.
• If m and n are relatively prime, then Tnm = TnTm.
We will be especially interested in modular forms 
which are eigenvectors for the action of all the Hecke 
operators, i.e., forms for which there exist numbers Xn 
such that Tn (f) = Xnf for each n which is relatively 
prime to the level. We will call such forms eigenforms.
This is all quite strange and complicated, so let’s 
immediately point out one connection between mod­
ular forms and elliptic curves. Suppose one has a 
modular form which is
• of weight 2 and level N,
• a cusp form, 
• new, 
• aneigenform.
If that is the case, one can normalize the form so that 
its Fourier expansion looks like
oo
f(z)
anqn with a1 =1.
n=1
Suppose that, once we have done the normalization,
• all of the Fourier coefficients an are integers.
Then there exists an elliptic curve whose equation has 
integer coefficients, whose conductor is N, and whose 
an are exactly the ones that appear in the Fourier 
expansion of f. In particular, the L-function ofE can 
be expressed in terms of f (as a Mellin transform), 
and the nice analytic properties of f then allow us 
to prove that the L-function does have an analytic 
continuation and does satisfy a functional equation.
This connection between forms and elliptic curves 
is so powerful that it led people to investigate the 
matter further. The first one to suggest that every el­
liptic curve should come about in this manner was Y. 
Taniyama, in the mid-fifties. The suggestion only pen­
etrated the mathematical culture much later, largely 
due to the work ofG. Shimura, and it was made more 
precise by A. Weil’s work pinning down the role of the 
conductor. We now call this the Shimura-Taniyama- 
Weil Conjecture. Here it is:
Conjecture 1 (Shimura-Taniyama-Weil). Let E be 
an elliptic curve whose equation has integer coeffi­
cients. Let N be the conductor of E, and for each n 
let an be the number appearing in the L-function of
E. Then there exists a modular form of weight 2, now 
of level N, an eigenform under the Hecke operators, 
and (when normalized) with Fourier expansion equal 
to an qn .
For any specific curve, it is not too hard to check 
that this is true. One takes E, determines the con­
ductor and the an for a range of n. Since the space 
of modular forms of weight 2 and level N is finite­
dimensional, knowing enough of the an must deter­
mine the form, and we can go and look if it is there. 
(In general, given a list of an it is not at all easy to 
determine whether an qn is the Fourier expansion 
of a modular form, so we need to do it the other way: 
we generate a basis of the space of modular forms, 
then try to find our putative form as a linear combi­
nation of the basis.) Ifwe find a form with the right 
(initial chunk of) Fourier expansion, this gives prima 
facie evidence that the curve satisfies the STW con­
jecture. To clinch the matter, one can use a form of 
the Cebotarev density theorem to show that if enough 
(in an explicit sense) of the an are right, then they all 
are.
This method has been used to verify the STW con­
jecture for any number of specific curves (see, for 
example, [6]). The conjecture has a really crucial role 
in the theory of elliptic curves; in fact, curves that 
satisfy the conjecture are known as “modular elliptic 
curves”, and many of the fundamental new results in 
the theory have only been proved for curves that have 
this property.
As our final remark on modular forms, we point out 
that it is possible, for any given N, to determine (es­
sentially using the Riemann-Roch theorem) the exact 
dimension of the space of cusp forms of weight 2 and 
level N . This gives us a very good handle on what 
curves of that conductor should exist (if the STW 
conjecture is true). For more information on modular 
forms, one might look at [17], [23], or [28]. There is 
an intriguing account of the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil 
conjecture, in a very different spirit, in Mazur’s article 
[21], and a useful survey in [18].
Galois representations
The final actors in our play are Galois representations. 
One starts with the Galois group of an extension of 
the field of rational numbers. To understand this Ga­
lois group, one can try to “represent” the elements 
of the group as matrices. In other words, one can 
try to find a vector space on which our Galois group 
acts, which gives a way to associate a matrix to each 

GOUVEA: A Marvelous Proof
element of the group. This in fact gives a group ho­
momorphism from the Galois group to a group of 
matrices (this need not be injective; when it is, one 
calls the representation faithful).
Rather than work with specific finite extensions of 
Q, we work with the Galois group G = Gal(Q/Q) 
of the algebraic closure of Q. This is a huge group 
(which one makes more manageable by giving it a 
topology) that hides within itself an enormous amount 
of arithmetic information. The representations we 
will be considering will be into 2 x 2 matrices over 
various fields and rings, and they will (for the most 
part) be obtained from elliptic curves and from mod­
ular forms.
To see how to get Galois representations from an el­
liptic curve, let’s start with an elliptic curve E, whose 
equation has coefficients in Z. Choose a prime p. 
Since the (complex, say) points of E form a group, 
one can look in this group for points which are of or- 
derp (that is, for points (x, y) such that adding them 
to themselves p times gives the identity). It turns out 
that (over C) there are p2 such points, and they form 
a subgroup which we denote by E [p]. In fact, this 
group is isomorphic to the product of two copies of 
Fp:
E [p ] = Fp x F p.
Now, the points in E [p] are a priori complex, but 
on closer look one sees that in fact they are all de­
fined over some extension of Q, and in particular that 
transforming the coefficients of a point of order p by 
the Galois group G yields another point of order p. 
In fact, it’s even better than that: since the rule for 
adding points is defined in rational terms, the whole 
group structure is preserved. Since E [p] looks like a 
vector space of dimension 2 over Fp , this means that 
each element of G acts as a linear transformation on 
this space, and hence that we get a representation
pE,p : G ^ GL2(Fp ).
(We use a bar to remind ourselves that this is a repre­
sentation “modulo p”.)
Now, GL2 (Fp ) is a finite group, and G is very 
infinite, so this representation, while it tells us a lot, 
can’t be the whole story. It turns out, however, that 
we can use p-adic numbers to get a whole lot more. 
Instead of considering only the points of order p,we 
can consider points of order pn for each n. This gives 
a whole bunch of subgroups
E[p] C E[p2] C E[p3] C • • • 
369
and a whole bunch of representations, into GL2 (Fp), 
then into GL2 (Z/p2 Z), then into GL2 (Z/p3Z),... 
Putting all of these together ends up by giving us a 
p-adic representation
Pe,p : G ^ GL2(Qp),
which hides within itself all of the others. The repre- 
sentationsPE,p containalotofarithmetic information 
about the curve E.
And how does it look on the modular forms side? 
Well, it follows from the work of several mathemati­
cians (M. Eichler, G. Shimura, P. Deligne, and J.-P. 
Serre) that, whenever we have a modular form f (of 
any weight) which is an eigenform for the action of 
the Hecke operators and whose Fourier coefficients 
(after normalization) are integers, we can construct a 
representation
Pf,p : G ^ GL2(Qp)
which is attached to f in a precise sense which is 
too technical to explain here. (The construction of 
the representation is quite difficult, and in fact no 
satisfactory expository account is yet available.)
The crucial thing to know, for our purposes, is 
that when an elliptic curve E arises from a modular 
form f, then the representations PE,p andPf,p are the 
same. In fact, a converse is also true: given a curve 
E, if one can find a modular form f such that PE,p is 
the same as Pf,p, then E will be modular.
3 The play
We are now ready to take the plunge and try to see how 
all of the theory relates to Fermat’s Last Theorem. The 
idea is to assume that FLT is false, and then, using 
this assumption, to construct an elliptic curve that 
contradicts just about every conjecture under the sun.
Linking FLT to elliptic curves
So let’s start by assuming FLT is false, i.e., that there 
exist three non-zero integers u, vandw such that up + 
vp + wp =0(as we know, we only need to consider 
the case of prime exponent p, which is therefore odd, 
so that we can recast a solution in Fermat’s form to be 
in the form above). Since we know that the theorem 
is true for p = 3, we might as well assume that p > 5. 
We may clearly assume that u, v and w are relatively 
prime, which means that precisely one of them must 
be even. Let’s say v is even. Since p is bigger than 
2, we can see, by looking at the equation modulo 4, 
that one of u and w must be congruent to -1 modulo 

370
Algebra and Number Theory
4, and the other must be congruent to 1. Let’s say 
u = - 1(mod 4).
Let’s use this data to build an elliptic curve, fol­
lowing an idea due to G. Frey (see [9], [10], [11]). We 
consider the curve
y2 = x (x - up)(x + vp) .
This is usually known as the Frey curve. Following our 
discussion, above, of the curve Eabc, we already know 
quite a bit about the Frey curve. Here’s a summary:
1. Since v is even and p > 5, we know that we 
have vp = 0 (mod 32). We also know that up = 
-1 (mod 4). This puts us in the right position to 
use what we know about the curves Eabc.
2. The minimal discriminant of the Frey curve is
(uvw 
A = -----------.
256
3. The conductor of the Frey curve is the product 
of all the primes dividing up vp wp , which is, of 
course, the same as the product of all the primes 
dividing uvw.
4. The Frey curve is semistable.
Now, as Frey observed in the mid-1980s, this curve 
seems much too strange to exist. For one thing, its 
conductor is extremely small when compared to its 
discriminant (because of that exponent of 2p). For 
another, its Galois representations are pretty weird. 
Very soon, people were pointing out that there were 
several conjectures that would rule out the existence 
of Frey’s curve, and therefore would prove that Fer­
mat was correct in saying that his equation had no 
solutions.
FLT follows from the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil 
conjecture
It was already clear to Frey that it was likely that the 
existence of his curve would contradict the Shimura- 
Taniyama-Weil conjecture, but he was unable to give 
a solid proof of this. A few months after Frey’s work, 
Serre pinpointed, in a letter to J.-F. Mestre, exactly 
what one would need to prove to establish the link. 
In this letter (published as [26]), Serre describes the 
situation with the phrase “STW + £ implies Fermat.” 
Because of this, the missing theorem became known, 
for a while, as “conjecture epsilon”. This conjecture 
was proved by K. A. Ribet in [25] about a year later, 
and this established the link. A survey of these results 
can be found in [19].
What Serre noticed was that the representation 
modulo p
pE,p : G ^ GL2 (Fp )
obtained from the Frey curve was rather strange. It 
looked like the sort of representation one would get 
from a modular form of weight 2, but if one applied 
the “usual recipe” for guessing the level of that mod­
ular form, the answer came out to be N =2.Healso 
showed that the modular form must be a cusp form. 
The problem is that there are no cusp forms of weight 
2 and level 2!
So suppose there is a solution of the Fermat equa­
tion for some prime p, and use this solution to build 
a Frey curve E.LetN be the conductor of E (which 
we determined above). Suppose, also, that STW holds 
for E, so that there exists a modular form of weight 2 
and level N whose Galois representation is the same 
as the one for E. Then we have the following curious 
situation: we have a representation p which we know 
comes from a modular form of weight 2 and level N, 
but which looks as if it should come from a modular 
form of smaller level.
Here is where Ribet’s theorem comes in: he proves 
that (under certain hypotheses which will hold in 
our case) whenever this happens the modular form 
of smaller level must actually exist! Notice that this 
doesn’t mean that the original modular form came 
from lower level; what it means is that there is a form 
of lower level whose representation reduces modulo 
p to the same representation.
The upshot of Ribet’s theorem is the following:
Theorem 1 (Ribet). Suppose STW holds for all 
semistable elliptic curves. Then FLT is true.
This is true because if FLT were false, one could 
choose a solution of the Fermat equation and use itto 
construct a Frey curve, which would be a semistable 
elliptic curve. By STW, this curve would be attached 
to a modular form, so that its Galois representation 
is attached to a modular form. By Ribet’s theorem, 
there must exist a modular form of weight 2 and 
level 2 which gives the same representation modulo 
p. Just a little more work allows one to check that 
this modular form must be a cusp form. But this is 
a contradiction, because there are no cusp forms of 
weight 2 and level 2.
Deforming Galois representations
It is now that we come to Wiles’s work. His idea 
was that one can attack the problem of proving STW 

GOUVEA: A Marvelous Proof
by using the Galois representations, and in particular 
by thinking of “deformations” of Galois representa­
tions. The idea is to consider not only a representation 
modulo p, but also all the possible p-adic represen­
tations attached to it (one speaks of “all the possible 
lifts” of the representation modulo p). These can be 
thought of as “deformations” because, from the p- 
adic point of view, they are “close” to the original 
representation.
This sort of idea had been introduced by B. Mazur 
in [20]. Mazur showed that one could often obtain a 
“universal lift”, i.e., a representation into GL2 ofabig 
ring such that all possible lifts were “hidden” in this 
representation. If one knew that the representations 
modulo p were modular, then one could make another 
big ring “containing” all the lifts which are attached 
to modular forms. The abstract deformation theory 
then provides us with a homomorphism between these 
two rings: and one can try to prove that this is an 
isomorphism. If so, it follows that all lifts are modular.
What Wiles proposes to do is very much in this 
spirit, except that he restricts himself to lifts that have 
especially nice properties. He starts with a represen­
tation modulo p, and supposes it is modular and that it 
satisfies certain technical assumptions. Then he con­
siders all possible deformations which “look like they 
could be attached to forms at weight 2,” and gets ade- 
formation ring. Considering all deformations which 
are attached to modular forms of weight 2 gives a 
second ring (which is closely related to the algebra 
generated by the Hecke operators, in fact). Wiles then 
attempts to prove, using a vast array of recent results, 
including ideas of Mazur, Ribet, Faltings, V. Kolyva- 
gin, and M. Flach, that these two rings are the same.
It is not hard to see that the homomorphism be­
tween the two rings we want to consider is surjective. 
The difficulty is to prove it is also injective. Wiles re­
duces this question to bounding the size of a certain 
cohomology group. It is here that the brilliant ideas 
of Kolyvagin and of Flach come in. About five years 
ago, Kolyvagin came up with a very powerful method 
for controlling the size of certain cohomology groups 
using what he calls “Euler systems” (see [16] and the 
survey of the method in [22]). This method seems 
to be adaptable to any number of situations, and has 
been used to prove several important recent results. 
The initial breakthrough showing how one could be­
gin to use Kolyvagin’s method in our context is due to 
Flach (see [8]), who found a way to construct some­
thing that can be thought of as the beginning of an 
Euler system applicable to our situation. Wiles called 
on all these ideas to construct a “geometric Euler 
371
system” which plays a central role in the argument. 
(It is at this point that the current difficulty lies.)
From the bound on the cohomology group one will 
get a proof that the two rings are in fact isomorphic. 
Translated back to the language of representations, 
this means that if one starts with a representation 
modulo p which satisfies Wiles’s technical assump­
tions (and is modular), then any lift of the kind Wiles 
considers is also modular.
Put it all together . . .
Assume, then, that one can prove that all lifts of a 
modular representation are still modular. Now sup­
pose we have an elliptic curve E whose representa­
tion modulo p we can prove (by some means) to be 
modular. Suppose also that this representation satis­
fies Wiles’s technical assumptions. Then any lift of 
this representation is modular. But the p-adic repre­
sentation pE,p attached to E is one such lift! It follows 
that this representation is modular, and hence that E 
is modular.
All we need, now, is to prime the pump; we must 
find a way to decide that the representation modulo p 
is modular, and then use that to clinch the issue. What 
Wiles does is quite beautiful. First of all, he takes a 
semistable elliptic curve and looks at the Galois rep­
resentation modulo 3 attached to this curve. At this 
point, there are two possibilities. The representation, 
as we pointed out above, amounts to an action of the 
Galois group on the vector space F3 x F3. Now, it 
may happen that there is a subspace of that vector 
space which is invariant under every element of the 
Galois group. In that case, one says that the represen­
tation is reducible. If not, it is irreducible.
One has to be just a little more careful. Just as it 
sometimes happens that a real matrix has complex 
eigenvalues, it can happen that the invariant subspace 
only exists after we enlarge the base field. We will 
say a representation is absolutely irreducible when 
this does not happen: even over bigger fields, there is 
no invariant subspace.
Well, look at pE, 3. It may or may not be absolutely 
irreducible. If it is, Wiles calls upon a famous theorem 
of J. Tunnell, based on work of R. P. Langlands (see 
[33], [19]) to show that it is modular, and hence, using 
the deformation theory, that the curve is modular.
If pE,3 is not absolutely irreducible, Wiles shows 
that there is another elliptic curve which has the 
same representation modulo 5 as our initial curve, 
but whose representation modulo 3 is absolutely ir­
reducible. By the first case, it is modular. Hence, its 

372
Algebra and Number Theory
representation modulo 5 is modular. But since this 
is the same as the representation modulo 5 attached 
to our original curve, we can apply the deformation 
theory for p =5to conclude that our original curve 
is modular.
If Wiles’s strategy is successful, we get:
Theorem 2. The Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture 
holds for any semistable elliptic curve.
And, since the Frey curve is semistable,
Corollary 1. For any n > 3, there are no non-zero 
integer solutions to the equation xn + yn = zn.
And of course, this is just one corollary of the proof 
of the STW conjecture for semistable curves, and it is 
certain that there will he many others still. For exam­
ple, as Serre pointed out in [27], one can apply Frey’s 
ideas to many other Diophantine equations that are 
just as hard to handle as Fermat’s. These are equations 
that are closely related to the Fermat equation, of the 
form
xp + yp = Mzp,
where p is a prime number and M is some integer. 
From Serre’s argument and Wiles’s result, one gets 
something like this:
Corollary 2. Let p be a prime number, and M be a 
power of one of the following primes:
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 53, 59.
Suppose that p > 11 and that p does not divide m. 
Then there are no non-zero integer solutions of the 
equation xp + yp = Mzp.
The proof is precisely parallel to what we have done 
before: given a solution, construct a Frey curve, and 
consider the resulting modular form. Apply Ribet’s 
theorem to lower its level, and then study the space 
of modular forms of that level to see if the form 
predicted by Ribet is there. If there is no such form, 
there can be no solution.
In fact, one can even get a general result, as Mazur 
pointed out:
Corollary 3. Let M be a power of a prime number f 
and assume that £ is not of theform 2n ± 1. Then there 
exists a constant C such that the equation xp + yp = 
Mzp has no non-zero solutions for any p > Cf.
However successful they may be in the end at prov­
ing the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture, Wiles’s 
ideas are certain to have enormous impact.

Afterword
In chapter 10 of his A History of Algebra [26], B. L. van der Waerden repeats much of what he wrote 
about Hamilton’s discovery of quaternions. Interestingly, there he mentions Caspar Wessel as one of 
the originators of the geometric interpretation of complex numbers, while in the current article he 
ignores Wessel. But he also goes on to discuss Cayley’s own use of quaternions to describe rotations 
in three-space, meanwhile pointing out the earlier results of Rodrigues. In addition, he deals with 
some applications of quaternions to the question of representing integers as sums of four squares. He 
concludes by discussing Hermann Hankel’s 1867 book that presents many of Grassmann’s results, 
but in a form that was easier to understand.
Simon Altmann writes in his article that we know “next to nothing” about Olinde Rodrigues, but 
in the next fifteen years he remedied this situation, publishing the results in his recent biography, 
Mathematics and Social Utopias in France: Olinde Rodrigues and His Times [1]. Similarly, Karen 
Parshall went on to do further research on the life and work of Sylvester. Her results appear 
in her edition of Sylvester’s letters [18] as well as in her magnificent biography of the English 
mathematician [19].
Israel Kleiner has expanded his paper on group theory and some of his other work on the history 
of algebra into a new book, A History of Abstract Algebra [15]. Leo Corry’s Modern Algebra and 
the Rise of Mathematical Structures [5] is another recent work that concentrates specifically on the 
development of abstraction in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but claims that true abstraction 
did not come into being until the work of Emmy Noether in the 1920s. Corry’s conclusion is based 
on his detailed study of algebra texts of the period, and he reports on this in an article [6] on 
the change in the conception of algebra between 1895 and 1930. Sujoy Chakraborty and Munibur 
Rahman Chowdhury [4] have studied the immediate motivations for Arthur Cayley’s first paper on 
group theory and argue that, despite Cayley’s seemingly faulty definition of an abstract group, he 
really understood the central ideas and did in fact include all the necessary conditions. There is also 
a new study of the idea of quotient groups by Julia Nicholson [17], who detailed the reasons for the 
development of this idea throughout the nineteenth century.
Joseph Gallian wrote his report on finite simple groups in 1976, when it was not yet known that 
no more sporadic groups would be found. But in February, 1981, Daniel Gorenstein, one of the 
leading group theorists of the late twentieth century, confirmed that the “Monster” was the last 
of the sporadic groups and the classification of the finite simple groups was complete. Two recent 
articles by Ron Solomon [25] and Michael Aschbacher [2] discuss the current status of the enormous 
proof of the classification. Two recent popular books discuss the long search for all of the sporadic 
simple groups, Mark Ronan’s Symmetry and the Monster [23], and Marcus du Sautoy’s Symmetry: 
A Journey into the Patterns of Nature [10].

Algebra and Number Theory
Both versions of Hermann Grassmann’s Ausdehnungslehre have been translated by Lloyd Kan- 
nenberg ([12], [13]). In addition, in 1994 there was a major conference in Germany to celebrate the 
150th anniversary of the publication of the first edition. The proceedings have been published as 
Hermann Gunther Grassmann (1809-1877): Visionary Mathematician, Scientist, and Neohumanist 
Scholar [24] and contain numerous essays on Grassmann’s work and influence.
In Kleiner’s discussion of Dedekind’s development of ideals, he notes that Leopold Kronecker 
developed an alternative approach to the subject of algebraic number theory around the same 
time. Although Dedekind’s approach prevailed, Harold Edwards has written a detailed study of 
Kronecker’s theory in Divisor Theory [11]. There is also a more general study of divisibility theory 
in a recent paper by Olaf Neumann [16].
Edward Waring’s book, in which Waring’s problem was first stated, has been translated into English 
by Dennis Weeks [27]. There continue to be new developments in the mathematics of this problem, 
which are frequently reported in the mathematics press. There have also been several recent books 
dealing with the Riemann hypothesis and its relationship to the prime number theorem, including 
John Derbyshire’s Prime Obsession [7], Marcus du Sautoy’s The Music of the Primes [9] and Don 
Rockmore’s Stalking the Riemann Hypothesis [22].
As to Fermat’s Last Theorem, it turned out that Wiles’s announced proof of 1993 had a flaw, but 
one that he and a former student, Richard Taylor, were finally able to correct about a year later. 
Nevertheless, Gouvea’s outline of the proof is still the best study of the proof aimed at non-specialist 
mathematicians. More details are in Griffith’s article in Part 4 of this book as well as in the reference 
mentioned in the afterword to that chapter. Recently, David Pengelley and Reinhard Laubenbacher 
have shown that Sophie Germain in the early nineteenth century had developed her own strategy for 
proving the theorem, although, as it turned out, the strategy could not be successful. See [20] for 
details.
Robert Kanigel has written a wonderful biography of Ramanujan: The Man Who Knew Infinity 
[14]. Bruce Berndt and George Andrews have spent many years working through Ramanujan’s 
notebooks. They have written a series of volumes in recent years detailing the mathematics in these 
notebooks, all published by Springer. Finally, Auguste Dick’s biography of Emmy Noether was 
translated into English and published in 1981 [8]. At the same time J. W. Brewer and M. K. Smith 
edited a volume of essays paying tribute to her: Emmy Noether: A Tribute to her Life and Work [3].

Foreword
This final chapter contains three survey articles on mathematics, dating from 1900, 1951, and 2000, 
as well as a brief and subjective account of the Second International Congress of Mathematicians, 
held in Paris in August 1900.
George Bruce Halsted was one of the American delegates to the Congress and wrote a report 
for the Monthly shortly after he returned. The major part of the paper deals with his reactions 
to Hilbert’s famous address on the problems of mathematics, an address that set the agenda for 
twentieth-century work in mathematics. But the other talk that particularly interested Halsted was 
one on Japanese mathematics, by Rikitaro Fujisawa (1861-1933). Fujisawa’s conclusions as to the 
Japanese independent discovery of both zero and the square root of -1 are not accepted today.
In a report written for the beginning of the twentieth century, G. A. Miller discusses some “new 
fields” of mathematics, fields that seemed to him to be particularly fertile. Among the important areas 
currently under active investigation, Miller picked the arithmetization of analysis, the development 
of set theory, and the study of groups as particularly worthy of further attention. He also noted 
that practical applications of mathematics were important; in particular, he was impressed with the 
discovery of a linkage that would construct a straight line.
A half-century later, Hermann Weyl discussed the mathematics of the first half of the twentieth 
century. In the areas of algebra and number theory, Weyl emphasizes the advances in the abstract 
theory of rings, ideals, and fields, pointing out how van der Waerden’s text Moderne Algebra 
explaining these subjects was written from a structural and abstract point of view, far different 
from the textbooks of the turn of the century. Weyl particularly stresses how the development of 
p-adic analysis enabled mathematicians to develop class field theory, “that most fascinating branch 
of mathematics.” He also deals with the theory of group representations, especially its application 
to continuous groups. In analysis, Weyl considers spectral theory in Hilbert spaces as one of the 
most important new developments (see Steen’s article earlier in this volume). He also notes the 
importance of Lebesgue’s theory of integrals and its generalizations, as well as homology theory 
and algebraic topology in general. Turning next to geometry, Weyl discusses differential geometry 
and its relation to general relativity, calling it “the most important development of geometry in 
the twentieth century.” He concludes with a few words about the foundations of mathematics, in 
particular the effect of the work of Godel on the various philosophies of mathematics.
Passing on to the beginning of the twenty-first century, Phillip Griffiths deals with the major 
achievements of the late twentieth century and the challenges for the future. In particular, he 
discusses Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, Thomas Hales’s settling of Kepler’s 
Sphere Packing Conjecture, and Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken’s solution to the four-color 
problem. Griffiths then shows how late twentieth-century mathematics defied the earlier trends

toward fragmentation of the subject by developing the connections among many seemingly disparate 
fields, and also continued to develop new interactions with other sciences. Among the most important 
of the interactions is with the life sciences, as mathematical biology now seems to be ever more im­
portant for the understanding of our world. Griffiths concludes his articles with a list of some of the 
major mathematical challenges for mathematics in the twenty-first century, including the Riemann 
hypothesis, the Poincare conjecture, and the question whether P = NP, as well as the more general 
challenges of mathematics education and outreach to the general public.

The International Congress of Mathematicians
GEORGE BRUCE HALSTED
American Mathematical Monthly 7 (1900), 188-189
On the sixth of August at the Palais des Congres in the 
Paris Exposition, was held the opening session of the 
second International Congress of Mathematicians. 
The president, Poincare, is regarded as the greatest 
of living mathematicians. Among the vice presidents 
in attendance were Gordan, Lindeloef, Lindemann, 
Mittag-Leffler.
Representing Japan was Fujisawa; Spain sent Zoel 
de Galdeano; the United States, Miss Scott. The 
president of the section of Arithmetic and Algebra 
was Hilbert; of Geometry was Darboux, of Bibli­
ography and History was Prince Roland Bonaparte. 
Among the most interesting personalities present 
may be mentioned Dickstein of Warsaw, Gutzmer 
of Jena, Hagen of Washington, Laisant of Paris, 
Langel of Golfe Juan, Lemoine of Paris, Delury of 
Toronto, Padoa of Rome, Shroeder of Carlsruhe, 
Sintsof of Yekaterinoslav, Stringham of Berkeley, 
Tannery of Paris, Vasiliev of Kazan, Whitehead of 
Cambridge.
Of the many important papers presented two may 
be selected for their general interest and the enthusi­
asm with which they were received. These are: The 
Mathematics of the Old Japanese School by Fujisawa, 
and The Problems of Mathematics by Hilbert.
Among other matters of extraordinary importance, 
Fujisawa showed his astonished audience that the 
Japanese had independently discovered the zero and 
by a mysterious coincidence used for it a circular 
symbol as did the Hindus and as do we. He showed 
that the Japanese had rectified the circle with an ac­
curacy far exceeding Archimedes and only paralleled 
in our modern developments of pure mathematics. 
He showed that the Japanese had recognized v” 
(the square root of minus one) as a number, as a new 
unit, a neomon, and thus had reached the basis for 
the theory of the complex numbers. This paper is 
epoch-making for the history of mathematics.
Hilbert’s beautiful paper on The Problems of Math­
ematics shows that when a science progresses con­
tinuously we may from the problems which actually 
occupy it judge of its ulterior development. The ex­
istence of precise problems has a capital importance 
both for the progress of mathematics and for the work 
of each investigator.
Whence come the problems of mathematics? It is 
experience that in each domain puts before us the pri­
mary problems (e.g., duplication of the cube, quadra­
ture of the circle, etc.). In the later development of 
the science itis the mind which by logical reasonings 
(combination, generalization, specialization) creates 
itself problems new and fertile (e.g., problems of 
prime numbers). We say that a problem is solved 
when starting from a finite number of assumptions 
furnished by the problem itself we demonstrate the 
justness of the solution by a finite number of deduc­
tions. This mathematical rigor which we require does 
not necessitate complicated demonstrations; the most 
rigorous method is often the simplest and the easiest 
to comprehend.
The conceptions of arithmetic or those of analysis 
are not the only ones susceptible of rigorous treat­
ment. Those of geometry and the physical sciences 
are equally so, provided that by means of a complete 
system of assumptions they are as well fixed as the 
conceptions of arithmetic.
When a problem presents serious difficulties, by 
what methods can we attack it?
First by generalization, in attacking the problem 
considered to a group of questions of the same order 
(e.g., introduction of ideal numbers into the theory of 
algebraic numbers; employment of complex paths in 
the theory of definite integrals).
Or else by specialization, in deepening the 
study of more simple analogous problems already 
solved.
383

384
Surveys
The failure of attempts at the solution of a prob­
lem comes often from the problem being impossible 
to solve under the form given. Then we require a 
rigorous demonstration of the impossibility (parallel 
postulate, quadrature of the circle, algebraic solution 
of the equation of the fifth degree).
We say that a conception exists from the mathe­
matical point of view when the assumptions which 
define it are compatible, that is to say when a fi­
nite chain or system of logical deductions start­
ing from these assumptions can never lead to a 
contradiction.
Mathematics in developing, far from losing its 
character of unique science, manifests it from day 
to day more clearly. Each real progress brings nec­
essarily the discovery of methods more incisive and 
more simple, permitting to each geometer an access 
relatively facile to all the parts of our science.
The magnificent reception given by the President 
of France M. Loubet and his wife Madame Emilie 
Loubet in which the members of the Congress partic­
ipated, was only surpassed in charm by the delightful 
entertainment given in our honor by Prince Roland 
Bonaparte.

A Popular Account of Some New Fields of 
Thought in Mathematics
G. A. MILLER
American Mathematical Monthly 7 (1900), 91-99
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, elemen­
tary arithmetic was a Freshman subject in our best 
colleges. In 1802 the standard of admission to Har­
vard College was raised so as to include a knowledge 
of arithmetic to the ‘Rule of Three’. A boy could enter 
the oldest college in America prior to 1803 without a 
knowledge of a multiplication table ([3], p. 60). From 
that time on the entrance requirements in mathemat­
ics were rapidly increased, but it was not until after 
the founding of Johns Hopkins University that the 
spirit of mathematical investigation took deep root in 
this country.
The lectures of Sylvester and Cayley at Johns Hop­
kins University, the founding of the American Jour­
nal of Mathematics and the young men who received 
their training abroad cooperated to spread the spirit of 
mathematical investigation throughout our land. This 
has led to the formation of the American Mathemat­
ical Society eight years ago, as well as to the starting 
of a new research journal, The Transactions of the 
American Mathematical Society, at the beginning of 
this year. While these were some of the results of 
mathematical activity, they, in a still stronger sense, 
tend to augment this activity.
In Europe such men as Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, 
Lagrange and Euler laid the foundation for the devel­
opment of mathematics in many directions. These 
men, as well as a few of the most prominent names 
in the early part of the nineteenth century, were not 
specialists in mathematics. They were familiar with 
all the fields of mathematical activity in their day and 
some of them were well known for their contributions 
in other fields of knowledge. The last three-quarters of 
a century, and especially the last two or three decades, 
have witnessed a marvelous change in the mathemati­
cal activity of Europe. Mathematical periodicals have 
sprung up on all sides. A number of mathematical so­
cieties have been organized and many of the leading 
mathematicians have confined their investigations to 
comparatively small fields of mathematics.
The rapid increase of the mathematical literature 
created an imperative need of bibliographical reviews. 
This need was met in part by the establishment at 
Berlin, in 1869, of a year-book devoted exclusively to 
the reviews of mathematical articles, Jahrbuch uber 
die Fortschritte der Mathematik. The 28th volume 
of this work reached our library a short time ago. It 
contains over 900 pages, and gives a review of over 
2000 memoirs and books. With a view towards fur­
ther increasing the facilities to keep in touch with 
the growing literature, the Amsterdam Mathematical 
Society commenced the publication ofa semi-annual 
review, Revue Semestrielle, in 1893. In the last num­
ber of this, 236 periodicals are quoted, each of which 
contains, at times, mathematical articles that are of 
sufficient merit to be noted. Each of the four coun­
tries, France, Germany, Italy, and America publishes 
over thirty such periodicals.
One of the characteristic features of our times is the 
prominence of the spirit of cooperation. The mathe­
matical periodicals and the mathematical societies 
are evidences of this spirit. In quite recent years in­
ternational mathematical congresses have given fur­
ther expression of the widespread desire to cooperate 
with even the most remote workers in the same fields. 
The first of these congresses was held in Zurich in 
1897, and the second is to be held during the com­
ing summer in connection with the Paris Exposition.
385

386
Surveys
The same spirit led in 1894 to the starting of a peri­
odical, L’lntermediaire des Mathematiciens, which is 
devoted exclusively to the publishing of queries and 
answers in regard to different mathematical subjects.
This desire for extensive cooperation is tending 
towards unifying mathematics and towards laying es­
pecial stress on those subjects which have the widest 
application in the different mathematical disciplines. 
This explains why the theory of functions of a com­
plex variable and the theory of groups are occupying 
such prominent places in recent mathematical thought 
([7], p. 134).
Before entering upon a description of some of the 
fields included in these subjects and the interesting 
problems which they present, it may be well to state 
explicitly that our remarks on mathematics will have 
very little reference to its application to other sci­
ences. To the pure mathematician a result that has 
extensive application in mathematics is just as im­
portant and useful as one which applies to the other 
sciences. Mathematics is a science which deserves to 
be developed for its own sake. The thought that some 
of its results may find application in other sciences is, 
however, a continual inspiration, and those who in­
vestigate such applications sometimes add materially 
to the development of mathematics.
The curve representing a function of a single vari­
able was the principal object of investigation dur­
ing the eighteenth and a great part of the nineteenth 
century [9]. The investigations of Abel and Cauchy 
on power series during the early part of the nine­
teenth century furnished the foundation for the mod­
ern theory of analytic functions—a theory which has 
been adorned by the labors of some of the most bril­
liant mathematicians of the preceding generation and 
which is claiming the attention of some of the fore­
most thinkers of the present time. Quite recently this 
theory has been made more accessible to English 
readers by the treatises of Forsyth and Harkness and 
Morley.
The critical spirit of our age is, in a large measure, 
due to the study of the theory of analytic functions. 
“Newton assumes without hesitation the existence, 
in every case, of a velocity in a moving point, with­
out troubling himself with the inquiry whether there 
might not be continuous functions having no deriva­
tive” ([8], p. 41). When it was discovered that such 
functions exist and that the works of some of the 
greatest mathematicians of the preceding centuries 
had to be modified in some instances, mathemati­
cians naturally became much more exacting in regard 
to rigor, and thus ushered in an age which may be 
compared with the times of Euclid with respect to its 
demands for rigor. Whether our critical age will pro­
duce a work which, like Euclid, will serve as a model 
for millennia cannot be foretold, but it seems certain 
that works which can stand the critical tests of this 
age will stand the tests of all ages.
The critical spirit of our times is the foundation 
of what has been styled the arithmetization of math­
ematics. This movement which the late Weierstrass 
knew so well to lead is pervading more and more the 
whole mathematical world. We are rapidly banishing 
from our treatises the term quantity and replacing it by 
the word number. Our geometric intuitions are forced 
into the background and logical deductions from in­
tuitions are taking their places. Who can conceive of 
curves which have no tangent at any of their ratio­
nal points in a given interval? Nevertheless it is well 
known that such curves exist. An account of such 
functions was first published by Hankel (see [11], 
p. 398) in 1870.
Mathematicians find themselves in a great dilemma 
at this point. Geometric intuition has been such a 
strong instrument of research and has given so much 
life and beauty to mathematical investigation that 
mathematicians cling to it as to their own lives. It is 
an enormous price when rigor can be purchased only 
with geometric intuition. Yet, in the present stage of 
mathematical thought, this seems to be the only thing 
that will be accepted, and mathematicians stand help­
less before this decree.
A few examples may throw some light on this sub­
ject. What do we understand by the length of a con­
tinuous curve? The intuitionalist says, if we connect 
different points of the continuous curve by straight 
lines and find the sum of the lengths of these straight 
lines, then the length of the curve will be the limit of 
this sum as the number of the points is indefinitely 
increased. Jordan was the first to call attention to the 
fact that this sum need not have a limit. Hence there 
are continuous curves which do not have any length 
according to the ordinary definition of length. In fact, 
a number of area-filling curves have recently been 
studied, and Cantor has shown that a multiplicity of 
any number of dimensions can be put in a one-to-one 
correspondence with a multiplicity of one dimension.
These are some of the facts which have compelled 
mathematicians to construct their own worlds—the 
number worlds. Conclusions drawn in one number 
world do not necessarily apply to another. When a 
problem is under consideration, the number world is 
so chosen as to meet the demands of the problem. 
For instance, the constructions and demonstrations

of Euclid’s geometry seem to require only a 
space composed of quadratic numbers (see [14], 
p. 443). Hence it appears that we do not need to 
assume that space is continuous in order to demon­
strate the theorems of elementary geometry. Similarly 
in algebra, we are laying more and more stress upon 
a distinct statement of the number world (the domain 
of rationality) in which we are operating. Such speci­
fications add a clearness and rigor to our work which 
would otherwise scarcely be possible.
This refinement which the mathematical thought 
of today is so actively cultivating is not restricted to 
the finite region. Mathematical infinity is receiving 
its share of attention. It is well known that it is some­
times desirable to regard the infinite region as a single 
point. This is, for instance, the case in the transforma­
tion known as inversion. Again, in ordinary projective 
geometry, it is generally convenient to regard the infi­
nite region as of one lower dimension than the finite, 
so that the infinite region of a plane is merely a line 
and the infinite region of space is a plane. The student 
of differential calculus is, moreover, familiar with the 
infinite variable and the many simplifications which 
its use makes possible.
The most fruitful investigations along this line 
are those on multiplicities (Mengenlehre, ensembles). 
Any total of definite and clearly defined elements is 
said to form a multiplicity. If two multiplicities are 
simply isomorphic, i.e., if there is a one-to-one cor­
respondence between the elements of the multiplic­
ities, they are said to be equivalent, or to have the 
same power. For example, it is easy to prove that all 
the positive rational numbers are equivalent to the 
natural numbers. To do this we may associate all the 
rational numbers p/q for which the sum p + q = n, 
any positive integer. We thus have the n - 1 numbers.
n - 1 n - 2 n - 3 
2 
1
1 , 
2 , 
3 , ••• , n - 2, n - 1'
We may let 1 correspond to 1; the numbers for 
which n =3 correspond to 2 and 3; the numbers 
for which n =4 correspond to 4, 5 and 6, etc. We 
thus obtain the following one-to-one correspondence 
between all the rational numbers and the positive 
integers

It may be observed that we do not need to reduce 
the rational fractions to their lowest terms to effect 
this correspondence. This method of proof is due to 
Cantor, who has also proved that all algebraic num­
bers are equivalent to the natural numbers ([4], [5]). 
How important and far-reaching the investigations 
along this line are may be inferred from the fact that 
Jordan has employed them to serve as a foundation 
of the elementary part of the second edition of his 
magistral Cours d’Analyse.
A large number of mathematical problems may be 
reduced to equations involving a single unknown. The 
solution of such equations has occupied a prominent 
place in the mathematical literature for centuries. The 
problem is so difficult that it has been attacked from a 
number of different points and by means of a large va­
riety of instruments. The instrument which has proved 
to be the most powerful and far-reaching is substitu­
tion groups. By means of it Abel succeeded in 1826 
to prove that an equation whose degree exceeds four 
cannot generally be solved by the successive extrac­
tion of roots [11] and Galois a few years later sketched 
a far-reaching theory of equations which rests upon 
the theory of these groups.
In recent years it has been recognized (especially 
through the labors of Sophus Lie) that the theory of 
groups has very extensive and fundamental applica­
tion in a large number of the other domains of math­
ematics. About a year ago the great French mathe­
matician H. Poincare showed in an article, published 
in the Chicago Monist [12], how this concept may 
be employed in laying the foundations of elemen­
tary geometry. It should be observed that the theory 
of groups is intrinsically based upon the fundamen­
tal concepts of mathematics. It is not a superstruc­
ture. It stands on its own foundation and supports 
more or less a number of other mathematical struc­
tures.
As this theory is less known than most of the other 
extensive branches of mathematics, it may be de­
sirable to enter into some details. It is evident that 
there are rational functions of n independent vari­
ables
(x1,x2,x3,...,xn)
which are not changed when these variables are per­
muted in every possible manner. Such functions are 
said to be symmetric in regard to these variables. The 
sum of any given power of these variables
x a+x a+x a +—+ xan 

388
Surveys
is an instance of a symmetric function. These func­
tions occupy one extreme. The other extreme is fur­
nished by functions such as
x 1 + 2 x 2 + 3 x 3 + • • • nxn
which change their value for every possible inter­
change of the variables. Most of the functions are of 
neither of these extreme types.
Suppose that a function ^(x 1 ,x2,. ..xn) is not 
changed by either of two interchanges of its inde­
pendent variables. Such interchanges are called sub­
stitutions and they may be represented by S1 and 
S2. Since 0 is not changed by either of the substitu­
tions S1,S2, it cannot be changed by the substitutions 
which are equivalent to the succession of these sub­
stitutions taken in any order. All such substitutions 
may be represented by
SasIsyS2 • • •
(where the exponents indicate the number of times the 
substitution is employed in succession). Since only a 
finite number of permutations are possible with n let­
ters it follows that Sas1S1YS2 • • • can represent only 
a finite number of distinct substitutions. The total­
ity of these substitutions is said to be a substitution 
group. Hence we observe that every rational function 
belongs to some substitution group.
It was soon observed that an infinite number of 
functions belong to the same substitution group and 
that all of these functions can be expressed rationally 
in terms of one of them. The researches of Abel, 
Galois, and Jordan were based upon these facts and 
they show that the most important problems in the 
theory of equations involve the theory of substitution 
groups. The theory of groups was thus founded with 
a view to its application to a subject of paramount 
importance. A broad mathematical subject can, how­
ever, not grow vigorously and harmoniously as long 
as it is studied with a view to its direct applications 
to other mathematical subjects. It must be free to ex­
pand in all directions. That freedom for which the 
human race has ever been struggling must be vouch­
safed to such fundamental subjects before they will 
exhibit their great fertility and far-reaching connec­
tions. Less than three years ago the first work on 
the theory of groups that does not consider its ap­
plication [2] was given to the public, but the mathe­
matical journals have been publishing a large num­
ber of memoirs along the same line for a number of 
years.
In defining a substitution group we implied only 
two conditions; viz., no two substitutions ofthe group 
are identical, and if we combine the substitutions in 
any way we obtain only substitutions which are al­
ready in the group. Substitutions obey per se some 
other conditions; i.e., when they are combined (mul­
tiplied together) they obey the associative law, and if 
we multiply a substitution by (or into) two different 
substitutions the products will be different. In general 
we say that any finite number of operations which 
obey these four conditions constitute a group; e.g., 
all the rotations around the center of a regular solid 
which make the solid coincide with itself constitute 
a group, the nnth roots of unity constitute a group 
with respect to multiplication, but not with respect to 
addition, etc.
While the bulk of the mathematicians are revelling 
in the new fields of thought which are opening up 
on all sides, without any thought in reference to any 
immediate practical application of their results, there 
is fortunately a goodly number whose main efforts 
are devoted towards making some of these new re­
sults useful to the investigators in some of the other 
sciences. As an instance of fairly recent work of the 
latter kind, we may mention the study of linkages 
with a view towards describing a straight line. Al­
though the straight line is of such fundamental im­
portance both in pure and applied mathematics, yet 
it seems it was not until the latter half of the nine­
teenth century that a mechanical device has been dis­
covered by means of which such a line can be des­
cribed.
In 1864 M. Peaucellier, an officer of engineers in 
the French army, discovered the well-known device 
to describe a straight line by means ofan instrument 
composed of seven links.
His discovery was not at first estimated at its 
true value, fell almost into oblivion, and was 
rediscovered by a Russian named Lipkin, who 
got a substantial reward from the Russian gov­
ernment for his supposed originality. However, 
M. Peaucellier’s merit was finally recognized and 
he has been awarded the great mechanical prize 
ofthe Institute of France, the Prix Montyon ([6], 
p. 12).
Although the straight line and the circle occupy 
such a prominent place in elementary geometry and 
have been before the eyes of the mathematicians for 
thousands of years, yet less than half a century has 
passed since the invention of a mechanical device by 
means of which the straight line can be drawn. Such 
discoveries go far towards emphasizing the need of 
investigations, even in the most elementary subjects. 

MILLER: A Popular Account of some New Fields of Thought in Mathematics
389
Such investigations should, however, be preceded by 
a thorough knowledge of what has been done along 
the same lines.
If elementary mathematics is to continue to fur­
nish the best possible preparation for the study of ad­
vanced mathematics, it is evident that it has to adapt 
itself to the rapid changes which are going on in the 
different branches of mathematics. A need is thus 
created for elementary textbooks which meet the new 
requirements, and we are happy to be able to state that 
such books are being produced in our midst. How rad­
ical such changes may become cannot be foretold. In 
his address before the New York Mathematical Soci­
ety, Simon Newcomb said, “The mathematics of the 
twenty-first century may be very different from our 
own; perhaps the schoolboy will begin algebra with 
the theory of substitution groups, as he might now but 
for inherited habits” [10]. It is to be hoped that our 
inherited habits will not furnish an insurmountable 
barrier to progress in this direction.
In modern times the continent of Europe has al­
ways been the most progressive, and most of the new 
theories were first developed in these countries. The 
theory of invariants seems to be an exception to this 
rule. The two great English mathematicians, Cayley 
and Sylvester, developed this theory with great vigor; 
when their important results became generally known 
on the continent (largely through the work of Cleb- 
sch), they aroused a great deal of interest and they 
furnished a starting point for many important inves­
tigations.
One of the fundamental processes of mathematics 
is transformation—the deducing of truths from given 
facts and relations. The expressions which remain in­
variant when given transformations are performed are 
naturally objects of great interest and of fundamental 
importance. Imbued with this thought, Lie once said, 
“What do the natural phenomena present to us if it is 
not a succession of infinitesimal transformations of 
which the laws of the universe are the invariants?”
It need scarcely be added that all mathematical 
thought, even on the same subject, is not running in 
the same channel. Klein has divided mathematicians 
into three main categories [8], viz., the logicians, the 
formalists, and the intuitionists. The term logician is 
“intended to indicate that the main strength of the 
men belonging to this class lies in their logical and 
critical powers, in their ability to give strict defini­
tions and to derive rigid deductions therefrom. The 
great and wholesome influence exerted in Germany 
by Weierstrass in this direction is well known. The 
formalists among the mathematicians excel mainly 
in the skillful formal treatment of a given question, in 
devising for it an algorithm. Gordan, or let us say Cay­
ley or Sylvester, must be ranged in this group. To the 
intuitionists, finally, belong those who lay particular 
stress on geometrical intuition, not in pure geome­
try only, but in all branches of mathematics. What 
Benjamin Peirce has called “geometrizing a mathe­
matical question” seems to express the same idea. 
Lord Kelvin and von Staudt may be mentioned as 
types of this category.”
In his address before the Zurich International 
Congress Poincare says [13],
Mathematics has a triple end. It should furnish 
an instrument for the study of nature. Further­
more, it has a philosophical end, and, I venture 
to say, an aesthetic end. It ought to incite the 
philosopher to search into the notions of num­
ber, space, and time; and above all, adepts find 
in mathematics delights analogous to those that 
painting and music give. They admire the del­
icate harmony of numbers and of forms; they 
are amazed when a new discovery discloses for 
them an unlooked-for perspective; and the joy 
they experience has it not the aesthetic charac­
ter, although the senses take no part in it? Only 
the privileged few are called to enjoy it fully, it 
is true, but is it not the same with all the noblest 
arts? Hence I do not hesitate to say that mathe­
matics deserves to be cultivated for its own sake 
and that the theories not admitting of application 
to physics deserve to be studied as well as others. 
Moreover, a science produced with a view single 
to its applications is impossible; truths are fruit­
ful only if they are concatenated, if we cleave to 
those only of which we expect immediate results 
the connecting links will be lacking, and there 
will be no longer a chain.
In closing we may remark that no effort has been 
made to mention all the new fields of mathematical 
thought. Mathematics, like the other sciences, seems 
to offer inexhaustible fields of investigation. As it 
expands its perimeter increases and hence there is a 
continually increasing demand for investigators. The 
fields that have been examined present many difficul­
ties which cannot at present be surmounted. Some of 
the old difficulties are being removed by the light of 
the new discoveries. Still we know only a few things 
even about the fields which have been investigated. It 
is the exception that something can be done by known 
methods, the rule is that it cannot yet be done.

When we study the literature of some of the 
older subjects we are sometimes surprised by the 
large number of known facts, but when we come to 
study the subjects themselves and ask independent 
questions we are generally surprised to learn that 
so few properties are known. Hence it seems very 
desirable that the advanced student, at least, should 
study subjects, rather than the known facts in regard 
to these subjects. In this way a more accurate idea 
of the true state of knowledge can be obtained. Be­
sides, the knowledge of having discovered facts and 
relations which will enter into the structure of a grow­
ing science is the greatest source of pleasure that the 
student can obtain.

A Half-Century of Mathematics
HERMANN WEYL
American Mathematical Monthly 58 (1951), 523-553
Introduction. Axiomatics
Mathematics, beside astronomy, is the oldest of all 
sciences. Without the concepts, methods and results 
found and developed by previous generations right 
down to Greek antiquity, one cannot understand ei­
ther the aims or the achievements of mathematics 
in the last fifty years. Mathematics has been called 
the science of the infinite; indeed, the mathematician 
invents finite constructions by which questions are 
decided that by their very nature refer to the infinite. 
That is his glory. Kierkegaard once said religion deals 
with what concerns man unconditionally. In contrast 
(but with equal exaggeration) one may say that math­
ematics talks about the things which are ofno concern 
at all to man. Mathematics has the inhuman quality 
of starlight, brilliant and sharp, but cold.
But it seems an irony of creation that man’s mind 
knows how to handle things the better the farther 
removed they are from the center of his existence. 
Thus we are cleverest where knowledge matters least: 
in mathematics, especially in number theory. There 
is nothing in any other science that, in subtlety and 
complexity, could compare even remotely with such 
mathematical theories as for instance that of algebraic 
class fields. Whereas physics in its development since 
the turn of the century resembles a mighty stream 
rushing on in one direction, mathematics is more like 
the Nile delta, its waters fanning out in all directions. 
In view of all this—dependence on a long past, other­
worldliness, intricacy, and diversity—it seems an al­
most hopeless task to give a non-esoteric account of 
what mathematicians have done during the last fifty 
years. What I shall try to do here is, first to describe 
in somewhat vague terms general trends of develop­
ment, and then in more precise language explain the 
most outstanding mathematical notions devised, and 
list some of the more important problems solved, in 
this period.
One very conspicuous aspect of twentieth-century 
mathematics is the enormously increased role which 
the axiomatic approach plays. Whereas the axiomatic 
method was formerly used merely for the purpose 
of elucidating the foundations on which we build, it 
has now become a tool for concrete mathematical re­
search. It is perhaps in algebra that it has scored its 
greatest successes. Take for instance the system of 
real numbers. It is like a Janus head facing in two 
directions: on the one side it is the field of the al­
gebraic operations of addition and multiplication; on 
the other hand it is a continuous manifold, the parts 
of which are so connected as to defy exact isolation 
from each other. The one is the algebraic, the other 
the topological face of numbers. Modern axiomatics, 
simple-minded as it is (in contrast to modern poli­
tics), does not like such ambiguous mixtures of peace 
and war, and therefore cleanly separated both aspects 
from each other.
In order to understand a complex mathematical sit­
uation it is often convenient to separate in a natural 
manner the various sides of the subject in question, 
make each side accessible by a relatively narrow and 
easily surveyable group of notions and of facts for­
mulated in terms of these notions, and finally return 
to the whole by uniting the partial results in their 
proper specialization. The last synthetic act is purely 
mechanical. The art lies in the first, the analytic act 
of suitable separation and generalization. Our math­
ematics of the last decades has wallowed in general­
izations and formalizations. But one misunderstands 
this tendency if one thinks that generality was sought 
merely for generality’s sake. The real aim is simplic­
ity: every natural generalization simplifies since it 
391

392
Surveys
reduces the assumptions that have to be taken into 
account.
It is not easy to say what constitutes a natural 
separation and generalization. For this there is ulti­
mately no other criterion but fruitfulness: the success 
decides. In following this procedure the individual 
investigator is guided by more-or-less obvious analo­
gies and by an instinctive discernment of the essen­
tial acquired through accumulated previous research 
experience. When systematized, the procedure leads 
straight to axiomatics. Then the basic notions and 
facts of which we spoke are changed into undefined 
terms and into axioms involving them. The body of 
statements deduced from these hypothetical axioms 
is at our disposal now, not only for the instance from 
which the notions and axioms were abstracted, but 
wherever we come across an interpretation of the ba­
sic terms which turns the axioms into true statements.
It is a common occurrence that there are sev­
eral such interpretations with widely different subject 
matter. The axiomatic approach has often revealed in­
ner relations between, and has made for unification of 
methods within, domains that apparently lie far apart. 
This tendency of several branches of mathematics to 
coalesce is another conspicuous feature in the mod­
ern development of our science, and one that goes 
side by side with the apparently opposite tendency 
of axiomatization. It is as if you took a man out of 
a milieu in which he had lived, not because it fitted 
him but from ingrained habits and prejudices, and 
then allowed him, after thus setting him free, to form 
associations in better accordance with his true inner 
nature.
In stressing the importance of the axiomatic 
method I do not wish to exaggerate. Without inventing 
new constructive processes no mathematician will get 
very far. It is perhaps proper to say that the strength 
of modern mathematics lies in the interaction be­
tween axiomatics and construction. Take algebra as 
a representative example. It is only in this century 
that algebra has come into its own by breaking away 
from the one universal system Q of numbers which 
used to form the basis of all mathematical operations, 
as well as all physical measurements. In its newly- 
acquired freedom algebra envisages an infinite vari­
ety of “number fields”, each of which may serve as an 
operational basis; no attempt is made to embed them 
into the one system Q. Axioms limit the possibilities 
for the number concept; constructive processes yield 
number fields that satisfy the axioms.
In this way algebra has made itself independent of 
its former master analysis, and in some branches has 
even assumed the dominant role. This development 
in mathematics is paralleled in physics to a certain 
degree by the transition from classical to quantum 
physics, inasmuch as the latter ascribes to each physi­
cal structure its own system of observables or quan­
tities. These quantities are subject to the algebraic 
operations of addition and multiplication; but as their 
multiplication is non-commutative, they are certainly 
not reducible to ordinary numbers.
At the International Mathematical Congress in 
Paris in 1900 David Hilbert, convinced that problems 
are the life-blood of science, formulated twenty-three 
unsolved problems which he expected to play an im­
portant role in the development of mathematics dur­
ing the next era. How much better he predicted the 
future of mathematics than any politician foresaw the 
gifts of war and terror that the new century was about 
to lavish upon mankind! We mathematicians have 
often measured our progress by checking which of 
Hilbert’s questions had been settled in the meantime. 
It would be tempting to use his list as a guide for a 
survey like the one attempted here. I have not done 
so because it would necessitate explanation of too 
many details. I shall have to tax the reader’s patience 
enough anyhow.

Groups

Indeed, at this point it seems impossible for me to 
go on without illustrating the axiomatic approach by 
some of the simplest algebraic notions. Some of them 
are as old as Methuselah. For what is older than the 
sequence of natural numbers 1, 2, 3,...,bywhichwe 
count? Two such numbers a, bmaybe added and mul­
tiplied (a + b and a • b). The next step in the genesis 
of numbers adds to these positive integers the nega­
tive ones and zero; in the wider system thus created 
the operation of addition permits of a unique inver­
sion, subtraction. One does not stop here: the integers 
in their turn get absorbed into the still wider range 
of rational numbers (fractions). Thereby division, the 
operation inverse to multiplication, also becomes pos­
sible, with one notable exception however: division 
by zero. (Since b • 0 = 0 for every rational number 
b, there is no inverse b of 0 such that b • 0 = 1.) I 
now formulate the fundamental facts about the oper­
ations “plus” and “times” in the form of a table of 
axioms:

WEYL: A Half-century of Mathematics
393
Table T
1. The commutative and associative laws for addi­
tion,
a + b = b + a. 
a +(b + c)=(a + b)+c.
2. The corresponding laws for multiplication.
3. The distributive law connecting addition with mul­
tiplication
c • (a + b) = (c • a) + (c • b)■
4. The axioms of subtraction:
4.1 There is an element o (0, “zero”) such that 
a + o = o + a = a for every a.
4.2 To every a there is a number -a such that 
a +(-a)=(-a)+a = o.
5. The axioms of division:
5.1 There is an element e (1, “unity”) such that 
a • e = e • a = a for every a.
5.2 To every a = o there is an a-1 such that 
a • a-1 = a-1 a = e.
By means of (4.2) and (5.2) one may introduce the 
difference b - a and the quotient b/a as b + (-a) and 
ba-1, respectively
When the Greeks discovered that the ratio V2 be­
tween the diagonal and side of a square is not mea­
surable by a rational number, a further extension of 
the number concept was called for. However, all mea­
surements of continuous quantities are possible only 
approximately, and always have a certain range of in­
accuracy. Hence rational numbers, or even finite dec­
imal fractions, can and do serve the ends of mensura­
tion provided they are interpreted as approximations, 
and a calculus with approximate numbers seems 
the adequate numerical instrument for all measuring 
sciences.
But mathematics ought to be prepared for any sub­
sequent refinement of measurements. Hence dealing, 
say, with electric phenomena, one would be glad if one 
could consider the approximate values of the charge e 
of the electron which the experimentalist determines 
with ever greater accuracy as approximations of one 
definite exact value e.
And thus, during more than two millennia from 
Plato’s time until the end of the nineteenth century, the 
mathematicians worked out an exact number concept, 
that of real numbers, that underlies all our theories in 
natural science. Not even to this day are the logical 
issues involved in that concept completely clarified 
and settled. The rational numbers are but a small part 
of the real numbers. The latter satisfy our axioms no 
less than the rational ones, but their system possesses 
a certain completeness not enjoyed by the rational 
numbers, and it is this, their “topological” feature, on 
which the operations with infinite sums and the like, 
as well as all continuity arguments, rest. We shall 
come back to this later.
Finally, during the Renaissance complex numbers 
were introduced. They are essentially pairs z =(x, y) 
of real numbers x, y, pairs for which addition and 
multiplication are defined in such a way that all 
axioms hold. On the ground of these definitions 
e =(1, 0) turns out to be the unity, while i =(0, 1) 
satisfies the equation i • i = -e. The two members 
x, y of the pair z are called its real and imaginary 
parts, and z is usually written in the form xe + yi, or 
simply x + yi. The usefulness of the complex num­
bers rests on the fact that every algebraic equation 
(with real or even complex coefficients) is solvable in 
the field of complex numbers. The analytic functions 
ofa complex variable are the subject of a particularly 
rich and harmonious theory, which is the show-piece 
of classical nineteenth-century analysis.
A set of elements for which the operations a + b 
and a • b are so defined as to satisfy the axioms (1)­
(4) is called a ring; it is called a field if also the 
axioms (5) hold. Thus the common integers form a 
ring I, the rational numbers form a field w; so do 
the real numbers (field Q) and the complex numbers 
(field Q*). But these are by no means the only rings 
or fields. The polynomials of all possible degrees h,
f = f (x) = a o + a i x + a 2 x2 + • • • + ahxh, (1)
with coefficients ai taken from a given ring R (e.g., 
the ring I of integers, or the field w), called “poly­
nomials over R”, form a ring R[x]. Here the variable 
or indeterminate x is to be looked upon as an empty 
symbol; the polynomial is really nothing but the se­
quence of its coefficients a0,a1 ,a2, ••• . But writing 
it in the customary form (1) suggests the rules for the 
addition and multiplication of polynomials which I 
will not repeat here. By substituting for the variable x 
a definite element (“number”) 7 of R, or of a ring P 
containing R as a subring, one projects the elements f 
of R [x] into elements a of P, f ^ a: the polynomial 
f = f (x) goes over into the number a = f (7). This 
mapping f ^ a is homomorphic, i.e.,itpreservesad- 
dition and multiplication. Indeed, if the substitution 
of y for x carries the polynomial f into a and the 
polynomial g into p, then it carries f + g, f • g into 
a + p,a • p, respectively.
If the product of two elements of a ring is never 
zero unless one of the factors is, one says that the ring 

394
Surveys
is without null-divisor. This is the case for the rings 
discussed so far. A field is always a ring without null­
divisor. The construction by which one rises from 
the integers to the fractions can be used to show that 
any ring R with unity and without null-divisor may 
be imbedded in a field k, the quotient field, such that 
every element of k is the quotient a/b of two elements 
a and b of R the second of which (the denominator) 
is not zero.
Writing 1a, 2a, 3a,... , for a, a + a, a + a + a, 
etc., we use the natural numbers n =1, 2, 3,..., as 
multipliers for the elements a of a ring or a field. Sup­
pose the ring contains the unity e. It may happen that 
a certain multiple ne of e equals zero; then one read­
ily sees that na =0for every element a of the ring. 
If the ring is without null divisors, in particular if it 
is a field and p is the least natural number for which 
pe =0, then p is necessarily a prime number like 2 
or 3 or 5 or 7 or 11.... One thus distinguishes fields
of prime characteristic p from those of characteristic 
0 in which no multiple of e is zero.
Plot the integers ...,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2,...asequidis- 
tant marks on a line. Let n be a natural number > 2 
and roll this line upon a wheel of circumference n. 
Then any two marks a, a' coincide, the difference 
a — a' of which is divisible by n. (The mathemati­
cians write a = a' (mod n); they say: a is congru­
ent to a' modulo n.) By this identification the ring 
of integers I goes over into a ring In consisting of 
n elements only (the marks on the wheel), as which 
one may take the “residues” 0, 1,...,n— 1. Indeed, 
congruent numbers give congruent results under both 
addition and multiplication: a = a' ,b = b' (mod n) 
imply a + b = a' + b', a • b = a' • b' (mod n). For 
instance, modulo 12 we have 7 + 8 = 3 and 5 • 8 = 4 
because 15 leaves the residue 3 and 40 the residue 
4 if divided by 12. The ring I12 is not without null 
divisors since 3 • 4 is divisible by 12, but neither 3 
nor 4 is. However, if p is a natural prime number, 
then Ip has no null divisor and is even a field; for as 
the ancient Greeks proved by an ingenious procedure 
(Euclid’s algorism), for every integer a not divisible 
by p there is one, a', such that a • a' = 1 (mod p). 
This Euclidean theorem is at the basis of the whole 
of number theory. The example shows that there are 
fields of any given prime characteristic p.
In any ring R one may introduce the notions of unit 
and prime element as follows. The ring element a is 
a unit if it has a reciprocal a' in the ring, such that 
a' • a = e. The element a is composite if it may be 
decomposed into two factors a1 • a2, neither of which 
is a unit. A prime number is one that is neither a unit 
nor composite. The units of I are the numbers +1 
and —1. The units of the ring k[x] of polynomials 
over a field k are the non-vanishing elements of k 
(polynomials of degree 0). According to the Greek 
discovery of the irrationality of V2, the polynomial 
x2 — 2 is prime in the ring w [x]; but, of course, not 
in Q[x], for there it splits into the two linear factors 
(x — V2) • (x + V2).
Euclid’s algorism is also applicable to polynomi­
als f (x) of one variable x over any field k. Hence 
they satisfy Euclid’s theorem: given a prime element 
P = P (x) in this ring k[x] and an element f(x) of 
k[x] not divisible by P(x), there exists another poly­
nomial f(x) over k such that {/ (x) • f (x)} — 1 is 
divisible by P (x). Identification of any elements f 
and g of k[x], the difference of which is divisible by 
P, therefore changes the ring k[x] into a field, the 
“residue field k of k[x] modulo P.” Example: w [x] 
(mod x2 — 2). (Incidentally, the complex numbers 
may be described as the elements of the residue field 
of Q[x] (mod x2 + 1).)
Strangely enough, the fundamental Euclidean the­
orem does not hold for polynomials of two variables 
x, y. For instance, P(x, y)=x — y is a prime ele­
ment of w [x, y], and f(x, y)=x an element not di­
visible by P(x, y). But a congruence
x • f(x,y) = 1 (mod x — y)
is impossible. Indeed, it would imply —1+x • 
f (x, x) = 0, contrary to the fact that the polynomial 
of one indeterminate x,
— 1 + x • f (x,x) = — 1 + C 1 x + c2x2 + • • • ,
is not zero. Thus the ring w[x, y] does not obey the 
simple laws prevailing in I and in w[x].
Consider k, the residue field of w[x] (mod x2 — 2). 
Since for any two polynomials f (x), f (x) which are 
congruent mod x2 — 2 the numbers f (a/2) , f ^/2) 
coincide, the transition f (x) ^ f (V2) maps k into 
a subfield w [V2] of Q consisting of the numbers 
a + bV2 with rational a, b. Another such projec­
tion would be f (x) ^ f (—V2). In former times one 
looked upon k as the part w ^/2] of the continuum Q 
or Q* of all real or all complex numbers; one wished 
to embed everything into this universe Q or Q * in 
which analysis and physics operate. But as we have 
introduced it here, k is an algebraic entity whose 
elements are not numbers in the ordinary sense. It 
requires for its construction no other numbers but the 
rational ones. It has nothing to do with Q, and ought 
not to be confused with the one or the other of its two 
projections into Q. More generally, if P = P(x) is 

WEYL: A Half-century of Mathematics
395
any prime element in w [x], we can form the residue 
field kp of w [x] modulo P. To be sure, if J is any of 
the real or complex roots of the equation P(x) = 0 in 
Q*, then f (x) ^ f (6) defines a homomorphic pro­
jection of kp into Q*. But the projection is not kp 
itself.
Let us return to the ordinary integers • • • , 
—2, — 1, 0, 1, 2, • • • , which form the ring I. The mul­
tiples of 5, i.e., the integers divisible by 5, clearly 
form a ring. It is a ring without unity, but it has an­
other important peculiarity: not only does the prod­
uct of any two of its elements lie in it, but all the 
integral multiples of an element do. The queer term 
ideal has been introduced for such a set: Given a 
ring R, an R-ideal (a) is a set of elements of R such 
that
1. the sum and difference of any two elements of (a) 
are in (a),
2. the product of an element in (a) by any element of 
R is in (a).
We may try to describe a divisor a by the set of all 
elements divisible by a. One would certainly expect 
this set to be an ideal (a) in the sense just defined. 
Given an ideal (a), there may not exist an actual 
element a ofR such that (a) consists of all multiples 
j = m • a of a (m any element in R). But then we 
would say that (a) stands for an “ideal divisor” a: the 
words “the element j of R is divisible by a” would 
simply mean: “j belongs to (a).” In the ring I of 
common integers all divisors are actual.
But this is not so in every ring. An algebraic sur­
face in the three-dimensional Euclidean space with 
the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z is defined by an 
equation F (x, y, z)=0, where F is an element of 
3 Q=Q[x, y, z], i.e., a polynomial of the variables 
x, y, z with real coefficients. F is zero in all the points 
of the surface; but the same is true for every multiple 
L • F of F (L being any element of 3 Q), in other 
words, for every polynomial of the ideal (F) in 3 Q. 
Two simultaneous polynomial equations
F1 (x, y, z)=0, 
F2 (x, y, z)=0
will in general define a curve, the intersection of the 
surface F1 =0and the surface F2 =0. The polyno­
mials (L 1 • F1) + (L2 • F2) formed by arbitrary ele­
ments L1 ,L2 of 3Q form an ideal (F1 ,F2), and all 
these polynomials vanish on the curve. This ideal 
will in general not correspond to an actual divisor 
F, for a curve is not a surface. Examples like this 
should convince the reader that the study of algebraic 
manifolds (curves, surfaces, etc., in 2, 3, or any num­
ber of dimensions) amounts essentially to a study of 
polynomial ideals. The field of coefficients is not nec­
essarily Q or Q*, but may be a field ofa more general 
nature.
Some achievements of algebra 
and number theory
I have finally reached a point where I can hint, I hope, 
with something less than complete obscurity, at some 
of the accomplishments of algebra and number the­
ory in our century. The most important is probably 
the freedom with which we have learned to man­
age these abstract axiomatic concepts, like field, ring, 
ideal, etc. The atmosphere in a book like van der 
Waerden’s Moderne Algebra, published about 1930, 
is completely different from that prevailing, e.g., in 
the articles on algebra written for the Mathemati­
cal Encyclopaedia around 1900. More specifically, a 
general theory of ideals, and in particular of poly­
nomial ideals, was developed. (However, it should be 
said that the great pioneer of abstract algebra, Richard 
Dedekind, who first introduced the ideals into number 
theory, still belonged to the nineteenth century.)
Algebraic geometry, before and around 1900 flour­
ishing chiefly in Italy, was at that time a discipline of 
a type uncommon in the sisterhood of mathematical 
disciplines: it had powerful methods, plenty of gen­
eral results, but they were of somewhat doubtful valid­
ity. By the abstract algebraic methods of the twentieth 
century all this was put on a safe basis, and the whole 
subject received a new impetus. Admission of fields 
other than Q*, as the field of coefficients, opened up 
a new horizon.
A new technique, the “primadic numbers”, was in­
troduced into algebra and number theory by K. Hensel 
shortly after the turn of the century, and since then 
has become of ever increasing importance. Hensel 
shaped this instrument in analogy to the power series 
which played such an important part in Riemann’s 
and Weierstrass’s theory of algebraic functions of 
one variable and their integrals (Abelian integrals). 
In this theory, one of the most impressive accom­
plishments of the previous century, the coefficients 
were supposed to vary over the field Q* of all com­
plex numbers. Without pursuing the analogy, I may 
illustrate the idea of p-adic numbers by one typical 
example, that of quadratic norms. Let p be a prime 
number, and let us first agree that a congruence a = b 
modulo a power ph of p for rational numbers a, b has

396
Surveys
this meaning, that (a - b)/ph equals a fraction whose 
denominator is not divisible by p; for example, 
39 - 12 = 0 (mod 72) because 39 - 12=72 • 
.

Let now a, b be rational numbers, a =0, and b not 
the square of a rational number. In the quadratic field 
w [Vb] the number a is a norm if there are rational 
numbers x, y such that
a = (x + Vby^ X- — Vby^ , or a = x 2 — by 2.
Necessary for the solvability of this equation is that 
for every prime p and every power ph of p the con­
gruence a = x2 - by2 (mod ph) has a solution. This 
is what we mean by saying the equation has a p-adic 
solution. Moreover, there must exist rational num­
bers x and y such that x2 - by2 differs as little as 
one wants from a. This is what we mean by saying 
that the equation has an to-adic solution. The latter 
condition is clearly satisfied for every a, provided b 
is positive; however, ifb is negative itis satisfied only 
for positive a. In the first case every a is a to-adic 
norm; in the second case only half of the a’s are, 
namely, the positive ones. A similar situation prevails 
with respect to p-adic norms. One proves that these 
necessary conditions are also sufficient: ifa is a norm 
locally everywhere, i.e., ifa = x2 - by2 has a p-adic 
solution for every “finite prime spot p” and also for 
the “infinite prime spot to”, then it has a “global” 
solution, namely an exact solution in rational num­
bers x, y.
This example, the simplest I could think of, is 
closely connected with the theory of genera of 
quadratic forms, a subject that goes back to Gauss’s 
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, but in which the twen­
tieth century has made some decisive progress by 
means of the p-adic technique, and it is also typical 
for that most fascinating branch of mathematics men­
tioned in the introduction: class field theory. Around 
1900 David Hilbert had formulated a number of inter­
laced theorems concerning class fields, proved some 
of them at least in special cases, and left the rest 
to his twentieth-century successors, among whom I 
name Takagi, Artin and Chevalley. His norm residue 
symbol paved the way for Artin’s general reciprocity 
law. Hilbert had used the analogy with the Riemann- 
Weierstrass theory of algebraic functions over Q * for 
his orientation, but the ingenious, partly transcenden­
tal, methods which he applied had nothing to do with 
the much simpler ones that had proved effective for 
the functions. By the primadic technique a rapproche­
ment of methods has occurred, although there is still 
a considerable gap separating the theory of algebraic 
functions and the much subtler algebraic numbers.
Hensel and his successors have expressed the p- 
adic technique in terms of the non-algebraic “topo­
logical” notion of (“valuation” or) convergence. An 
infinite sequence of rational numbers a1 ,a2 , ••• is 
convergent if the difference ai - aj tends to zero, 
ai — aj ^ 0, provided i and j independently of each 
other tend to infinity; more explicitly, if for every 
positive rational number £ there exists a positive in­
teger N such that —£< ai — aj < £ for all i and 
j>N. The completeness of the real number sys­
tem is expressed by Cauchy’s convergence theorem: 
To every convergent sequence a1 ,a2, ••• of rational 
numbers there exists a real number a to which it 
converges: ai — a ^ 0 for i ^ to. With the to-adic 
concept of convergence we have now confronted the 
p-adic one induced by a prime number p. Here the 
sequence is considered convergent if for every ex­
ponent h =1, 2, 3, • •• , there is a positive integer N 
such that ai — aj is divisible by ph as soon as i and 
j>N. By the introduction of p-adic numbers one 
can make the system of rational numbers complete 
in the p-adic sense, just as the introduction of real 
numbers makes them complete in the to-adic sense. 
The rational numbers are embedded in the contin­
uum of all real numbers, but they may be embedded 
as well in that of all p-adic numbers. Each of these 
embedments corresponding to a finite or the infinite 
prime spot p is equally interesting from the arithmeti­
cal viewpoint. Now it is more evident than ever how 
wrong it was to identify an algebraic number field 
with one of its homomorphic projections into the field 
Q of real numbers; along with the (real) infinite prime 
spots one must pay attention to the finite prime spots 
which correspond to the various prime ideals of the 
field. This is a golden rule abstracted from earlier, and 
then made fruitful for later, arithmetical research; and 
here is one bridge (others will be pointed out later) 
joining the two most fascinating branches of modern 
mathematics: abstract algebra and topology.
Besides the introduction of the primadic treatment 
and the progress made in the theory of class fields, 
the most important advances of number theory dur­
ing the last fifty years seem to lie in those regions 
where the powerful tool of analytic functions can be 
brought to bear upon its problems. I mention two such 
fields of investigation: I. distribution of primes and 
the zeta function, II. additive number theory.
I. The notion of prime number is of course as old 
and as primitive as that of the multiplication of natural 
numbers. Hence it is most surprising to find that the 

WEYL: A Half-century of Mathematics
397
distribution of primes among all natural numbers is 
of such a highly irregular and almost mysterious char­
acter. While on the whole the prime numbers thin out 
the further one gets in the sequence of numbers, wide 
gaps are always followed again by clusters. An old 
conjecture maintains that there even come along again 
and again pairs of primes of the smallest possible dif­
ference 2, like 71 and 73. However, the distribution 
of primes obeys at least a fairly simple asymptotic 
law: the number n (n) of primes among all numbers 
from 1 to n is asymptotically equal to n/ log n. [Here 
log n is not the Briggs logarithm which our logarith­
mic tables give, but the natural logarithm as defined 
by the integral 1n dx/x.] By “asymptotic” is meant 
that the quotient between n (n) and the approximating 
function n/ logn tends to 1 as n tends to infinity.
In antiquity Eratosthenes had devised a method to 
sift out the prime numbers. By this sieve method the 
Russian mathematician Tchebycheff had obtained, 
during the nineteenth century, the first non-trivial re­
sults about the distribution of primes. Riemann used 
a different approach: his tool is the so-called zeta­
function defined by the infinite series
z (s ) = 1-s + 2-s +3-s + ••• • 
(2)
Here s is a complex variable, and the series converges 
for all values of s, the real part of which is greater 
than 1, ffis > 1. Already in the eighteenth century 
the fact that every positive integer can be uniquely 
factorized into primes had been translated by Euler 
into the equation
1 /z(s) = (1 - 2-s) (1 - 3-s) (1 - 5-s) ••• ,
where the (infinite) product extends over all primes 
2, 3, 5,  Riemann showed that the zeta-function 
has a unique “analytic continuation” to all values of 
s other than 1 and that it satisfies a certain func­
tional equation connecting its values for s and 1 - s. 
Decisive for the prime number problem are the ze­
ros of the zeta-function, i.e., the values s for which 
z(s) = 0. Riemann’s equation showed that, except for 
the “trivial” zeros at s = -2, -4, -6,..., all zeros 
have real parts between 0 and 1. Riemann conjectured 
that their real parts actually equal 2. His conjecture 
has remained a challenge to mathematics now for 
almost a hundred years. However, enough had been 
learned about these zeros at the close of the nineteenth 
century to enable mathematicians, by means of some 
profound and newly-discovered theorems concern­
ing analytic functions, to prove the above-mentioned 
asymptotic law. This was generally considered a great 
triumph of mathematics. Since the turn of the cen­
tury Riemann’s functional equation with the attending 
consequences has been carried over from the “classi­
cal” zeta-function of the field of rational numbers to 
that of an arbitrary algebraic number field (E. Hecke). 
For certain fields of prime characteristic, one suc­
ceeded in confirming Riemann’s conjecture, but this 
provides hardly a clue for the classical case. About 
the classical zeta-function we know now that it has 
infinitely many zeros on the critical line ffis 2, and 
even that at least a fixed percentage, say 10 per cent, 
of them lie on it. (What this means is the following: 
Some percentage of those zeros whose imaginary part 
lies between arbitrary fixed limits -T and +T will 
have a real part equal to 21, and this percentage will not 
sink below a certain positive limit, like 10 per cent, 
when T tends to infinity.) Finally, about two years 
ago, Atle Selberg succeeded, to the astonishment of 
the mathematical world, in giving an “elementary” 
proof of the prime number law by an ingenious re­
finement of old Eratosthenes’s sieve method.
II. It has been known for a long time that every 
natural number may be written as the sum of at most 
four square numbers, e.g.,
7=22 +12+12+12,
87= 92 +22 +12 +12 =72 +52 +32 +22.
The same question arises for cubes, and generally 
for any kth powers (k =2, 3, 4, 5,...). In the eigh­
teenth century Waring had conjectured that every 
non-negative integer n may be expressed as the sum 
of a limited number M of kth powers,
n = n1k + n2k + ••• + nkM , 
(3)
where the ni are also non-negative integers and M 
is independent of it. The first decade of the twentieth 
century brought two events: first one found that every 
n is expressible as the sum of at most 9 cubes (and 
that, excepting a few comparatively small n, even 
8 cubes will do); and shortly afterwards Hilbert 
proved Waring’s general theorem. His method was 
soon replaced by a different approach, the Hardy­
Littlewood circle method, which rests on the use of 
a certain analytic function of a complex variable and 
yields asymptotic formulas for the number of differ­
ent representations of it in the form (3). With some 
precautions demanded by the nature of the problem, 
and by overcoming some quite serious obstacles, the 
result was later carried over to arbitrary algebraic 
number fields; and by a further refinement of the cir­
cle method in a different direction Vinogradoff proved 

398
Surveys
that every sufficiently large n is the sum of at most 
3 primes. Is it even true that every even n is the sum 
of 2 primes? To show this seems to transcend our 
present mathematical powers as much as the twin­
prime conjecture. The prime numbers remain very 
elusive fellows.
III. Finally, a word ought to be said about investiga­
tions concerning the arithmetical nature of numbers 
originating in analysis. One of the most elementary 
such constants is n, the area of the circle of radius 
1. By proving that n is a transcendental number (not 
satisfying an algebraic equation with rational coeffi­
cients), the age-old problem of “squaring the circle” 
was settled in 1882 in the negative sense; that is, one 
cannot square the circle by constructions with ruler 
and compass. In general it is much harder to estab­
lish the transcendency of numbers than of functions. 
Whereas it is easy to see that the exponential function
23
e =1+ 
2 
3 +-
is not algebraic, it is quite difficult to prove that its 
basis eis a transcendental number. C. L. Siegel was 
the first who succeeded, around 1930, in developing a 
sort of general method for testing the transcendency 
of numbers. But the results in this field remain spo­
radic.
Groups, vector spaces and algebras
This ends our report on number theory, but not on 
algebra. For now we have to introduce the group con­
cept, which, since the young genius Evariste Galois 
blazed the trail in 1830, has penetrated the entire body 
of mathematics. Without it an understanding of mod­
ern mathematics is impossible.
Groups first occurred as groups of transformations. 
Transformations may operate in any set of elements, 
whether it is finite like the integers from 1 to 10, 
or infinite like the points in space. Set is a pre- 
mathematical concept: whenever we deal with a realm 
of objects, a set is defined by giving a criterion which 
decides for any object of the realm whether it belongs 
to the set or not. Thus we speak of the set of prime 
numbers, or of the set of all points on a circle, or of 
all points with rational coordinates in a given coor­
dinate system, or of all people living at this moment 
in the State of New Jersey. Two sets are considered 
equal if every element of the one belongs to the other 
and vice versa. A mapping S of a set a into a set 
a' is defined if, with every element a of a, there is 
associated an element a' of a', a ^ a'. Here a rule is 
required which allows one to find the “image” a' for 
any given element a ofa. This general notion of map­
ping we may also call of a pre-mathematical nature. 
Examples: a real-valued function of a real variable 
is a mapping of the continuum Q into itself. Perpen­
dicular projection of the space points upon a given 
plane is a mapping of the space into the plane. Rep­
resenting every space-point by its three coordinates 
x, y, z with respect to a given coordinate system is a 
mapping of space into the continuum of real number 
triples (x, y, z). If a mapping S, a ^ a' of a into a', 
is followed by a mapping S', a' ^ a" of a' into a 
third set a", the result is a mapping SS', a ^ a" of 
a into a". A one-to-one mapping between two sets 
a, a' is a pair of mappings, S : a ^ a' of a into a', 
and S' : a' ^ a of a' into a, which are inverse to each 
other. This means that the mapping SS' of a into a 
is the identical mapping E of a which sends every 
element a of a into itself, and that S'S is the identi­
cal mapping of a'. In particular, we are interested in 
one-to-one mappings of a set a into itself. For them 
we shall use the word transformation. Permutations 
are nothing but transformations of a finite set.
The inverse S' of a transformation S, a ^ a' of a 
given set a , is again a transformation and is usually 
denoted by S-1 . The result ST of any two transfor­
mations S and T of a is again a transformation, and 
its inverse is T-1S-1 (according to the rule of dress­
ing and undressing: if in dressing one begins with the 
shirt and ends with the jacket, one must in undressing 
begin with the jacket and end with the shirt: the order 
of the two “factors” S, T is essential.) A group of 
transformations is a set of transformations ofa given 
manifold which
1. contains the identity E,
2. contains with every transformation S its inverse 
S-1, and
3. contains with any two transformations S, T their 
“product” ST.
Example: One could define congruent configurations 
in space as point sets of which one goes into the other 
by a congruent transformation of space. The cong­
ruent transformations, or “motions”, of space form 
a group, a statement which, according to the above 
definition of group, is equivalent to the three-fold 
statement that
1. every figure is congruent to itself,
2. if a figure F is congruent to F', then F' is con­
gruent to F, and

WEYL: A Half-century of Mathematics
399
3. if F is congruent to F' and F' is congruent to F", 
then F is congruent to F".
This example at once illuminates the inner signifi­
cance of the group concept. Symmetry of a configu­
ration F in space is described by the group of motions 
that carry F into itself.
Often manifolds have a structure. For instance, the 
elements of a field are connected by the two oper­
ations of plus and times; or in Euclidean space we 
have the relationship of congruence between figures. 
Hence we have the idea of structure-preserving map­
pings; they are called homomorphisms. Thus a ho­
momorphic mapping of a field k into a field k' is a 
mapping a ^ a' of the “numbers” a of k into the 
numbers a' of k' such that (a + b)' = a' + b' and 
(a • b)' = a' • b'. A homomorphic mapping of space 
into itself would be one that carries any two con­
gruent figures into two mutually congruent figures. 
The following terminology (suggestive to anyone who 
knows a little Greek) has been agreed upon: homo­
morphisms which are one-to-one mappings are called 
isomorphisms; when a homomorphism maps a mani­
fold a into itself, it is called an endomorphism, and an 
automorphism when it is both: a one-to-one mapping 
ofa into itself. Isomorphic systems, i.e., any two sys­
tems mapped isomorphically upon each other, have 
the same structure; indeed nothing can be said about 
the structure ofthe one system that is not equally true 
for the other.
The automorphisms of a manifold with a well- 
defined structure form a group. Two sub-sets of the 
manifold that go over into each other by an automor­
phism deserve the name of equivalent. This is the 
precise idea at which Leibniz hints when he says that 
two such sub-sets are “indiscernible when each is con­
sidered in itself”; he recognized this general idea as 
lying behind the specific geometric notion of simil­
itude. The general problem of relativity consists in 
nothing else but to find the group of automorphisms. 
Here then is an important lesson the mathematicians 
learned in the twentieth century: whenever you are 
concerned with a structured manifold, study its group 
of automorphisms. Also the inverse problem, which 
Felix Klein stressed in his famous Erlangen program 
(1872), deserves attention: Given a group of transfor­
mations of a manifold a, determine such relations or 
operations as are invariant with respect to the group.
If in studying a group of transformations we ignore 
the fact that it consists of transformations and look 
merely at the way in which any two of its transfor­
mations S, T give rise to a composite ST, we obtain 
the abstract composition schema of the group. Hence 
an abstract group is a set of elements (of unknown or 
irrelevant nature) for which an operation of composi­
tion is defined generating an element st from any two 
elements s, t, such that the following axioms hold:
1. There is a unit element e such that es = se = s 
for every s.
2. Every element s has an inverse s-1 such that 
ss-1 = s-1s = e.
3. The associative law (st)u = s(tu) holds.
It is perhaps the most astonishing experience of mod­
ern mathematics how rich in consequences these three 
simple axioms are.
A realization of an abstract group by transforma­
tions of a given manifold a is obtained by associat­
ing with every element s of the group a transforma­
tion S of a, s ^ S such that s ^ S,t ^ T imply 
st ^ ST. In general, the commutative law st = ts 
will not hold. Ifit does, the group is called commuta­
tive or Abelian (after the Norwegian mathematician 
Niels Henrik Abel). Because composition of group 
elements in general does not satisfy the commutative 
law, it has proved convenient to use the term “ring” in 
the wider sense in which it does not imply the commu­
tative law for multiplication. (However, in speaking 
of a field one usually assumes this law.)
The simplest mappings are the linear ones. They 
operate ina vector space. The vectors in our ordinary 
three-dimensional space are directed segments AB 
leading from a point A to a point B . The vector AB 
is considered equal to A'B' if a parallel displacement 
(translation) carries AB into A'B'. In consequence 
of this convention one can add vectors and one can 
also multiply a vector by a number (integral, rational 
or even real). Addition satisfies the same axioms as 
enumerated for numbers in the table T above, and 
it is also easy to formulate the axioms for the sec­
ond operation. These axioms constitute the general 
axiomatic notion of vector space, which is therefore 
an algebraic and not a geometric concept. The num­
bers which serve as multipliers of the vectors may be 
the elements of any ring; this generality is actually 
required in the application of the axiomatic vector 
concept to topology. However, here we shall assume 
that they form a field. Then one sees at once that one 
can ascribe to the vector space a natural number n as 
its dimensionality in this sense: there exist n vectors 
e 1, • •• ,en such that every vector may be expressed 
in one and only one way as a linear combination 
x 1 e 1 + • • • + xnen, where the “coordinates” xi are 

400

definite numbers of the field. In our three-dimensional 
space n equals 3, but mechanics and physics give am­
ple occasion to use the general algebraic notion of an 
n-dimensional vector space for higher n.
The endomorphisms of a vector space are called 
its linear mappings; as such they allow composition 
ST (perform first the mapping S, then T), but they 
also allow addition and multiplication by numbers 
Y: if S sends the arbitrary vector x into xS, T into 
xT, then S + T,yS are those linear mappings which 
send x into (xS) + (xT) and y • xS, respectively. 
We must forgo to describe how in terms of a vector 
basis e1 ,...,en , a linear mapping is represented by 
a square matrix of numbers.
Often rings occur—they are then called algebras— 
which are at the same time vector spaces, i.e., for 
which three operations, addition of two elements, 
multiplication of two elements and multiplication of 
an element by a number, are defined in such man­
ner as to satisfy the characteristic axioms. The linear 
mappings of an n-dimensional vector space them­
selves form such an algebra, called the complete ma­
trix algebra (in n dimensions). According to quantum 
mechanics the observables ofa physical system form 
an algebra of special type with a non-commutative 
multiplication. In the hands of the physicists abstract 
algebra has thus become a key that unlocked to them 
the secrets of the atom. A realization of an abstract 
group by linear transformations of a vector space is 
called a representation. One may also speak of rep­
resentations of a ring or an algebra: in each case the 
representation can be described as a homomorphic 
mapping of the group or ring or algebra into the com­
plete matrix algebra (which indeed is a group and a 
ring and an algebra, all in one).
Finale
After spending so much time on the explanation of 
the notions I can be brief in my enumeration of some 
of the essential achievements for which they provided 
the tools. Ifg is a subgroup of the group G, one may 
identify elements s, t ofG that are congruent mod g, 
i.e., for which st-1 ising; g is a “self-conjugate” sub­
group if this process of identification carries G again 
into a group, the “factor group” G/g . The group­
theoretic core of Galois’s theory is a theorem due to 
C. Jordan and O. Holder which deals with the sev­
eral ways in which one may break down a given fi­
nite group G in steps G = G0,G1,G2,..., each Gi 
being a self-conjugate subgroup of the preceding 
group Gi-1. Under the assumption that this is done in 
as small steps as possible, the theorem states, the steps 
(factor groups) Gi- 1 /Gi (i = 1, 2, • ••) in one such 
“composition series” are isomorphic to the steps, suit­
ably rearranged, ina second such series. The theorem 
is very remarkable in itself, but perhaps the more so 
as its proof rests on the same argument by which one 
proves what I consider the most fundamental propo­
sition in all mathematics, namely the fact that if you 
count a finite set of elements in two ways, you end up 
with the same number n both times.
The Jordan-Holder theorem in recent times re­
ceived a much more natural and general formulation 
by
1. abandoning the assumption that the breaking down 
is done in the smallest possible steps, and
2. by admitting only such subgroups as are invariant 
with respect to a given set of endomorphic map­
pings of G.
It thus has become applicable to infinite as well as fi­
nite groups, and has provided a common denominator 
for quite a number of important algebraic facts.
The theory of representations of finite groups, the 
most systematic and substantial part of group the­
ory developed shortly before the turn of the century 
by G. Frobenius, taught us that there are only a few 
irreducible representations, of which all others are 
composed. This theory was greatly simplified after 
1900 and later carried over, first to continuous groups 
that have the topological property of compactness, 
but then also to all infinite groups, with a restrictive 
imposition (called almost-periodicity) on the repre­
sentations. With these generalizations one trespasses 
the limits of algebra, and a few more words will have 
to be said about it under the title analysis.
New phenomena occur if representations of finite 
groups in fields of prime characteristic are taken 
into account, and from their investigation profound 
number-theoretic consequences have been derived. It 
is easy to embed a finite group into an algebra, and 
hence facts about representations of a group are best 
deduced from those of the embedding algebra. At the 
beginning of the century algebras seemed to be fero­
cious beasts of unpredictable behavior, but after fifty 
years of investigation they, or at least the variety called 
semi-simple, have become remarkably tame; indeed 
the wild things do not happen in these superstructures, 
but in the underlying commutative “number” fields.
In the nineteenth century geometry seemed to have 
been reduced to a study of invariants of groups; Fe­
lix Klein formulated this standpoint explicitly in his 

WEYL: A Half-century of Mathematics
401
Erlangen program. But the full linear group was prac­
tically the only group whose invariants were studied. 
We have now outgrown this limitation and no longer 
ignore all the other continuous groups one encounters 
in algebra, analysis, geometry and physics.
Above all we have come to realize that the theory 
of invariants has to be subsumed under that of repre­
sentations. Certain infinite discontinuous groups, like 
the unimodular and the modular groups, which are of 
special importance to number theory, witness Gauss’s 
class theory of quadratic forms, have been studied 
with remarkable success and profound results. The 
macroscopic and microscopic symmetries of crystals 
are described by discontinuous groups of motions, 
and it has been proved for n dimensions, what had 
long been known for 3 dimensions, that in a certain 
sense there is but a finite number of possibilities for 
these crystallographic groups.
In the nineteenth century Sophus Lie had reduced 
a continuous group to its “germ” of infinitesimal ele­
ments. These elements form a sort of algebra in which 
the associative law is replaced by a different type of 
law. A Lie algebra is a purely algebraic structure, 
especially if the numbers which act as multipliers 
are taken from an algebraically defined field rather 
than from the continuum of real numbers Q. These 
Lie groups have provided a new playground for our 
algebraists.
The constructions of the mathematical mind are 
at the same time free and necessary. The individual 
mathematician feels free to define his notions and to 
set up his axioms as he pleases. But the question is, 
will he get his fellow mathematicians interested in the 
constructs of his imagination? We can not help feel­
ing that certain mathematical structures which have 
evolved through the combined efforts of the mathe­
matical community bear the stamp of a necessity not 
affected by the accidents of their historical birth. Ev­
erybody who looks at the spectacle of modern algebra 
will be struck by this complementarity of freedom and 
necessity.

Linear operators and their spectral 
decomposition. Hilbert space
A mechanical system of n degrees of freedom in 
stable equilibrium is capable of oscillations deviat­
ing “infinitely little” from the state of equilibrium. 
It is a fact of fundamental significance not only for 
physics but also for music that all these oscillations 
are superpositions of n “harmonic” oscillations with 
definite frequencies.
Mathematically the problem of determining the 
harmonic oscillations amounts to constructing the 
principal axes of an ellipsoid in an n-dimensional 
Euclidean space. Representing the vectors x in this 
space by their coordinates (x1 ,x2 ,...,xn) one has 
to solve an equation
xX • Kx = 0,
where K denotes a given linear operator (= lin­
ear mapping); X is the square of the unknown fre­
quency v of the harmonic oscillation, whereas the 
“eigenvector” x characterizes its amplitude. Define 
the scalar product (x, y) oftwo vectors x and y by the 
sum x 1 y 1 + • • • + xnyn. Our “affine” vector space is 
made into a metric one by assigning to any vector x 
the length ||x|| given by ||x||2 =(x, x), and this met­
ric is the Euclidean one so familiar to us from the 
3-dimensional case and epitomized by the Pytha­
gorean theorem. The linear operator K is symmet­
ric, in the sense that (x,Ky) = (Kx,y). The field of 
numbers in which we operate here is, of course, the 
continuum of all real numbers. Determination of the 
n frequencies v, or rather of the corresponding eigen­
values X = v2 , requires the solution of an algebraic 
equation of degree n (often known as the secular 
equation, because it first appeared in the theory of 
the secular perturbations of the planetary system).
More important in physics than the oscillations of 
a mechanical system of a finite number of degrees of 
freedom are the oscillations of continuous media, as 
the mechanical-acoustical oscillations of a string, a 
membrane or a 3-dimensional elastic body, and the 
electromagnetic-optical oscillations of the “ether”. 
Here the vectors with which one has to operate are 
continuous functions x(s) of points with one or sev­
eral coordinates that vary over a given domain, and 
consequently K is a linear integral operator.
Take for instance a straight string of length 1, the 
points of which are distinguished by a parameter vary­
ing from 0 to 1. Here (x, x) is the integral 01x2 (s)ds, 
and the problem of harmonic oscillations (which first 
suggested to the early Greeks the idea of a universe 
ruled by harmonious mathematical laws) takes the 
form of the integral equation
x(s) — X 
K(s,t)x(t)dt = 0, (0 < s < 1), (4)
0

402

where
k(s,t) = iay s(1 -t) fors5t (5) 
\n/ 
(1 — s)t for s > t,
and a is a constant determined by the physical condi­
tions of the string. The solutions are
X = (na )2, 
x (s) = sin nns,
where n is capable of all positive integral values 
1, 2, 3,  This fact that the frequencies of a string 
are integral multiples na of a ground frequency a 
is the basic law of musical harmony. If one prefers 
an optical to an acoustic language, one speaks of the 
spectrum of eigenvalues X.
After Fredholm at the very close of the nineteenth 
century had developed the theory of linear integral 
equations, it was Hilbert who in the next decade es­
tablished the general spectral theory of symmetric 
linear operators K. Only twenty years earlier it had 
required the greatest mathematical efforts to prove the 
existence of the ground frequency for a membrane, 
and now constructive proofs for the existence of the 
whole series of harmonic oscillations and their char­
acteristic frequencies were given under very general 
assumptions concerning the oscillating medium. This 
was an event of great consequence both in mathemat­
ics and theoretical physics. Soon afterwards, Hilbert’s 
approach made it possible to establish those asymp­
totic laws for the distribution of eigenvalues the physi­
cists had postulated in their statistical treatment of the 
thermodynamics of radiation and elastic bodies.
Hilbert observed that an arbitrary continuous func­
tion x(s) defined in the interval 0 5 s 5 1 may be 
replaced by the sequence
xn = a/2 
x (s) sin nns ds, n = 1, 2, 3,...,
0
of its Fourier coefficients. Thus there is no inner 
difference between a vector space whose elements 
are functions x(s) ofa continuous variable and one 
whose elements are infinite sequences of numbers 
(x i ,x 2 ,x 3, ■•■).
The square of the “length”, 01 x2 (s)ds, equals 
x2 + x2 + x3 + • • •. Between the two forms in which 
one may pass from a finite sum to a limit, the infinite 
sum a 1 + a2 + a3 + • • • and the integral J01 x2( s) ds, 
there is therefore here no essential difference. Thus 
an axiomatic formulation is called for. To the axioms 
for an (affine) vector space one adds the postulate 
of the existence of a scalar product (x, y) of any 
two vectors x, y with the properties characteristic for 
the Euclidean metric: (x, y) is a number depending 
linearly on either of the two argument vectors x and 
y; it is symmetric, (x, y) = (y,x); and (x, x) = ||x||2 
is positive, except for x =0. The axiom of finite di­
mensionality is replaced by a denumerability axiom 
of more general character.
All operations in such a space are greatly facilitated 
if it is assumed to be complete in the same sense 
that the system of real numbers is complete; i.e., if 
the following is true: Given a “convergent” sequence 
x', x",... ofvectors, namely, one for which ||x(m) — 
x(n) || tends to zero with m and n tending to infinity, 
there exists a vector a toward which this sequence 
converges,
||x(n) — a|| ^ 0 for n ^ <x>.
A non-complete vector space can be made complete 
by the same construction by which the system of 
rational numbers is completed to form that of real 
numbers. Later authors have coined the name “Hilbert 
space” for a vector space satisfying these axioms.
Hilbert himself first tackled only integral opera­
tors in the strict sense as exemplified by (4). But 
soon he extended his spectral theory to a far wider 
class, that of bounded (symmetric) linear operators 
in Hilbert space. Boundedness of the linear oper­
ator requires the existence of a constant M such 
that ||Kx||2 5 M ||x||2, for all vectors x of finite 
length ||x||. Indeed, the restriction to integral oper­
ators would be unnatural since the simplest operator, 
the identity x ^ x, is not of this type. And now one of 
those events happened, unforeseeable by the wildest 
imagination, the like of which could tempt one to 
believe in a pre-established harmony between physi­
cal nature and mathematical mind. Twenty years af­
ter Hilbert’s investigations, quantum mechanics found 
that the observables of a physical system are repre­
sented by the linear symmetric operators in a Hilbert 
space and that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
that operator which represents energy are the energy 
levels and corresponding stationary quantum states of 
the system. Of course this quantum-physical interpre­
tation added greatly to the interest in the theory and 
led to a more scrupulous investigation ofit, resulting 
in various simplifications and extensions.
Oscillations of continua, the boundary value prob­
lems of classical physics and the problem of energy 
levels in quantum physics, are not the only titles for 
applications of the theory of integral equations and 
their spectra. One other somewhat isolated applica­
tion is the solution of Riemann’s monodromy problem 
concerning analytic functions of a complex variable z. 
It concerns the determination ofn analytic functions 
of z which remain regular under analytic continuation 

WEYL: A Half-century of Mathematics
403
along arbitrary paths in the z-plane, provided these 
avoid a finite number of singular points, whereas the 
functions undergo a given linear transformation with 
constant coefficients when the path circles one of 
these points.
Another surprising application is to the establish­
ment of the fundamental facts, in particular of the 
completeness relation, in the theory of representa­
tions of continuous compact groups. The simplest 
such group consists of the rotations ofa circle, and in 
that case the theory of representations is nothing but 
the theory of the so-called Fourier series, which ex­
presses an arbitrary periodic function f (s) of period 
2n in terms of the harmonic oscillations
cos ns, sin ns, n = 0, 1, 2, ■■■ .
In Nature functions often occur with hidden 
non-commensurable periodicities. The mathemati­
cian Harald Bohr, the brother of the physicist Niels 
Bohr, prompted by certain of his investigations con­
cerning the Riemann zeta function, developed the 
general mathematical theory of such almost periodic 
functions. One may describe his theory as that of 
almost periodic representations of the simplest con­
tinuous group one can imagine, namely, the group of 
all translations of a straight line.
His main results could be carried over to arbitrary 
groups. No restriction is imposed on the group, but 
the representations one studies are supposed to be 
almost-periodic. For a function x(s), the argument s 
of which runs over the group elements, while its val­
ues are real or complex numbers, almost-periodicity 
amounts to the requirement that the group be compact 
in a certain topology induced by the function. This rel­
ative compactness instead of absolute compactness is 
sufficient. Even so the restriction is severe. Indeed the 
most important representations of the classical con­
tinuous groups are not almost-periodic. Hence the 
theory is in need of further extension, which has bus­
ied a number of American and Russian mathemati­
cians during the last decade.
Lebesgue’s integral, Measure theory, 
Ergodic hypothesis
Before turning to other applications of operators in 
Hilbert space I must mention the, in all probability fi­
nal, form given to the idea of integration by Lebesgue 
at the beginning of our century. Instead of speaking 
of the area of a piece of the 2-dimensional plane re­
ferred to coordinates x, y, or the volume ofa piece of 
the 3-dimensional Euclidean space, we use the neu­
tral term measure for all dimensions. The notions of 
measure and integral are interconnected. Any piece 
of space, any set of space points, can be described by 
its characteristic function x(P), which equals 1 or 0 
according to whether the point P belongs or does not 
belong to the set. The measure of the point set is the 
integral of this characteristic function.
Before Lebesgue one first defined the integral for 
continuous functions; the notion of measure was sec­
ondary; it required transition from continuous to such 
discontinuous functions as x(P). Lebesgue goes the 
opposite and perhaps more natural way: for him mea­
sure comes first and the integral second.
The one-dimensional space is sufficient for an il­
lustration. Consider a real-valued function y = f (x) 
ofa real variable x which maps the interval 0 < x < 1 
into a finite interval a < y < b. Instead of subdividing 
the interval of the argument x, Lebesgue subdivides 
the interval (a, b) of the dependent variable y into 
a finite number of small subintervals ai < y<ai+1 
say, of lengths < £, and then determines the measure 
mi of the set Si on the x-axis, the points of which 
satisfy the inequality ai < f(x) < ai+1. The integral 
lies between the two sums i aimi and i ai+1mi 
which differ by less than £, and thus can be computed 
with any degree of accuracy.
In determining the measure of a point set—and this 
is the more essential modification—Lebesgue covers 
the set with infinite sequences, rather than finite en­
sembles, of intervals. Thus, to the set of rational x in 
the interval 0 < x < 1 no measure could be ascribed 
before Lebesgue. But these rational numbers can be 
arranged in a denumerable sequence a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,..., 
and, after choosing a positive number £ as small as 
one likes, one can surround the point an by an in­
terval of length £/2n with the center an . Thus the 
whole set of rational points is enclosed in a sequence 
of intervals of total length
£( 1+212+23+ ••• 
= £;
and according to Lebesgue’s definition its measure is 
therefore less than (the arbitrary positive) £ and hence 
zero. The notion of probability is tied to that of mea­
sure, and for this reason mathematical statisticians 
are deeply interested in measure theory.
Lebesgue’s idea has been generalized in several 
directions. The two fundamental operations one can 
perform with sets are: forming the intersection and the 
union of given sets, and thus sets may be considered 
as elements of a “Boolean algebra” with these two 
operations, the properties of which may be laid down 
in a number of axioms resembling the arithmetical 

404
Surveys
axioms for addition and multiplication. Hence one of 
the questions which has occupied the more axiomat- 
ically minded among the mathematicians and statis­
ticians is concerned with the introduction of measure 
in abstract Boolean algebras.
Lebesgue’s integral is important in our present con­
text, because those real-valued functions f (x) of a 
real variable x ranging over the interval 0 < x < 1, 
the squares of which are Lebesgue-integrable, form 
a complete Hilbert space—provided two functions 
f(x),g(x) are considered equal if those values x 
for which f (x) = g(x) form a set of measure zero 
(Riesz-Fischer theorem).
The mechanical equations fora system of n degrees 
of freedom in Hamilton’s form uniquely determine 
the state tP at the moment t if the state P at the mo­
ment t = 0isgiven. Such is the precise formulation of 
the law of causality in mechanics. The possible states 
P form the points of a (2n)-dimensional phase space, 
and for a fixed t and an arbitrary P the transition 
P ^ tP is a measure-preserving mapping (t). These 
transformations form a group: (t1 )(t2) = (t1 + t2). 
For a given P and a variable t the point tP describes 
the consecutive states which this system assumes if 
at the moment t =0 it is in the state P . Consider­
ing P as a particle of a (2n)-dimensional fluid which 
fills the phase-space and ascribing to the particle P 
the position tP at the time t, one obtains the pic­
ture of an incompressible fluid in stationary flow. The 
statistical derivation of the laws of thermodynamics 
makes use of the so-called ergodic hypothesis, ac­
cording to which the path of an arbitrary individual 
particle P (excepting initial states P which form a set 
of measure zero) covers the phase-space (or at least 
that (2n - 1)-dimensional sub-space of it where the 
energy has a given value) everywhere densely, so that 
in the course of its history the probability of finding 
it in this or that part of the space is the same for any 
parts of equal measure.
Nineteenth-century mathematics seemed to be a 
long way off from proving this hypothesis with any 
degree of generality. Strangely enough it was proved 
shortly after the transition from classical to quan­
tum mechanics had rendered the hypothesis almost 
valueless, and it was proved by making use of the 
mathematical apparatus of quantum physics. Under 
the influence of the mapping (t), P ^ tP, any func­
tion f(P) in phase-space is transformed into the 
function f = Uif, defined by the equation f(tP) = 
f(P). The Ui form a group of operators in the 
Hilbert space of arbitrary functions f(P),Ui1 Ui2 = 
Ui1 +i2 and, application of spectral decomposition 
to this group enabled J. von Neumann to deduce the 
ergodic hypothesis with two provisos:
1. Convergence of a sequence of functions fn (P) 
toward a function f (P), fn ^ f, is understood 
(as it would be in quantum mechanics), namely 
as convergence in Hilbert space where it means 
that the total integral of (fnf)2 tends to zero with 
n ^ tt.
2. One assumes that there are no subspaces of the 
phase-space which are invariant under the group 
of transformations (t), except those spaces that are 
in Lebesgue’s sense equal either to the empty or 
the total space.
Shortly afterwards proofs were also given for other 
interpretations of the notion of convergence.
The laws of nature can either be formulated as dif­
ferential equations or as “principles of variation,” ac­
cording to which certain quantities assume extremal 
values under given conditions. For instance, in an op­
tically homogeneous or non-homogeneous medium, 
the light travels along that road from a given point 
A to a given point B for which the time of travel as­
sumes minimal value. In potential theory the quantity 
which assumes a minimum is the so-called Dirichlet 
integral. Attempts to establish directly the existence 
of a minimum had been discouraged by Weierstrass’s 
criticism in the nineteenth century. Our century, how­
ever, restored the direct methods of the Calculus of 
Variation to a position of honor after Hilbert in 1900 
gave a direct proof of the Dirichlet principle and later 
showed how it can be applied not only in establish­
ing the fundamental facts about functions and inte­
grals (“algebraic” functions and “abelian” integrals) 
on a compact Riemann surface (as Riemann had sug­
gested 50 years earlier), but also for deriving the basic 
propositions of the theory of uniformization. That the­
ory occupies a central position in the theory of func­
tions of one complex variable, and the first decade 
of the twentieth century witnessed the first proofs by 
P. Koebe and H. Poincare of these propositions con­
jectured about 25 years before by Poincare himself 
and by Felix Klein. As in an Euclidean vector space 
of finite dimensionality, so in the Hilbert space of 
infinitely many dimensions, this fact is true: Given a 
linear (complete) subspace E, any vector may be split 
in a uniquely determined manner into a component 
lying inE (orthogonal projection) and one perpendic­
ular to E. Dirichlet’s principle is nothing buta special 
case of this fact. But since the function-theoretic ap­
plications of orthogonal projection in Hilbert space

which we alluded to are closely tied up with topol­
ogy, we had better turn first to a discussion of this 
important branch of modern mathematics: topology.
Topology and harmonic integrals
Essential features of the modern approach to topol­
ogy can be brought to light in its connection with 
the, only recently developed, theory of harmonic in­
tegrals. Consider a stationary magnetic field h in a 
domain G which is free from electric currents. At ev­
ery point of G it satisfies two differential conditions 
which, in the usual notations of vector analysis, are 
written in the form div h =0, rot h =0. A field of 
this type is called harmonic. The second of these con­
ditions states that the line integral of h along a closed 
curve (cycle) C, C h, vanishes provided C lies in a 
sufficiently small neighborhood of an arbitrary point 
of G. This implies C h =0 for any cycle C in G 
that is the boundary of a surface in G. However, for 
an arbitrary cycle C in G the integral is equal to the 
electric current surrounded by C.
Let the phrase “C homologous to zero”, C ~ 0, 
indicate that the cycle C in G bounds a surface in G. 
One can travel over a cycle C in the opposite sense, 
thus obtaining -C, or travel over it 2, 3,... times, 
thus obtaining 2C, 3C,...; and cycles may be added 
and subtracted from each other (if one does not in­
sist that cycles are of one piece). Two cycles C, C' 
are called homologous, C ~ C', if C — C' ~ 0. Note 
that C ~ 0, C' ~ 0 imply — C ~ 0, C + C' ~ 0. 
Hence the cycles form a commutative group under 
addition, the “Betti group”, if homologous cycles are 
considered as one and the same group element.
These notions of cycles and their homologies may 
be carried over from a three-dimensional domain in 
Euclidean space to any n-dimensional manifold, in 
particular to closed (compact) manifolds like the two­
dimensional surfaces of the sphere or the torus; and on 
an n-dimensional manifold we can speak not only of 
1-dimensional, but also of 2-, 3-, ..., n-dimensional 
cycles. The notion ofa harmonic vector field permits 
a similar generalization, harmonic tensor field (har­
monic form) of rank r (r =1, 2,...,n), provided 
the manifold bears a Riemannian metric, an assump­
tion the meaning of which will be discussed later in 
the section on geometry. Any tensor field (linear dif­
ferential form) of rank r may be integrated over an 
r-dimensional cycle.
The fundamental problem of homology theory con­
sists in determining the structure of the Betti group, 
not only for 1-, but also for 2-, ..., n-dimensional 
cycles, in particular in determining the number of 
linearly independent cycles (the Betti number). [v 
cycles C1,... ,Cv, are linearly independent if there 
exists no homology k1 C1 + • • • + kvCv ~ 0 with in­
tegral coefficients k, except k 1 = • • • = kv =0.] The 
fundamental theorem for harmonic forms on compact 
manifolds states that, given v linearly independent cy­
cles C1,...,Cv, there exists a harmonic form h with 
pre-assigned periods
h = n 1, • • • , h = nv.
H. Poincare developed the algebraic apparatus nec­
essary to formulate exactly the notions of cycle and 
homology. In the course of the twentieth century it 
turned out that in most problems cohomologies are 
easier to handle than homologies. I illustrate this for 
1-dimensional cycles.
A line C1 leading from a point p1 to p2 , when fol­
lowed by a line C2 leading from p2 to a third point p3, 
gives rise to a line C1 + C2 leading from p 1 to p3. The 
line integral C h of a given vector field h along an 
arbitrary (closed or open) line C is an additive func­
tion $(C) of C, $(C1 + C2) = $(C1) + $(C2). If 
moreover rot h vanishes everywhere, then $(C) = 0 
for any closed line C that lies in a sufficiently 
small neighborhood of a point, whatever this point 
may be. Any real-valued function ^ satisfying these 
two conditions may be called an abstract integral. 
The cohomology $ ~ 0 means that ^(C) = 0 for 
any closed line C, and thus it is clear what the 
cohomology k 1 ^ 1 + • • • + kvov ~ 0 with arbitrary 
real coefficients k1 ,...,kv, means. The homology 
C ~ 0 could now be defined, not by the condition 
that the cycle C bounds, but by the requirement 
that ^ (C) = 0 for every abstract integral ^. With 
the convention that any two abstract integrals ^, ft 
are identified if ^ — fl ~ 0, these integrals form a 
vector space, and the dimensionality of this vector 
space is now introduced as the Betti number. And 
the fundamental theorem for harmonic integrals on 
a compact manifold now asserts that for any given 
abstract integral ^ there exists one and only one har­
monic vector field h whose integral is cohomologous 
to ^, Cch = ^ (C) for every cycle C (realization 
of the abstract integral in concreto by a harmonic 
integral).
J. W. Alexander discovered an important result con­
necting the Betti numbers of a manifold M that is 
embedded in the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn 
with the Betti numbers of the complement Rn \M 
(Alexander’s duality theorem).

The difficulties of topology spring from the double 
aspect under which one can consider continuous man­
ifolds. Euclid looked upon a figure as an assemblage 
of a finite number of geometric elements, like points, 
straight lines, circles, planes, spheres. But after re­
placing each line or surface by the set of points lying 
on it, one may also adopt the set-theoretic view that 
there is only one sort of element, points, and that any 
(in general infinite) set of points can serve as a figure. 
This modern standpoint obviously gives geometry far 
greater generality and freedom. In topology, however, 
it is not necessary to descend to the points as the ulti­
mate atoms, but one can construct the manifold like a 
building from “blocks” or cells, and a finite number of 
such cells serving as units will do, provided the man­
ifold is compact. Thus it is possible here to revert to a 
treatment in Euclid’s “finitistic” style (combinatorial 
topology).
On the first standpoint, a manifold as a point set, the 
task is to formulate that continuity by which a point p 
approaching a given point p0 becomes gradually in­
distinguishable from p0 . This is done by associating 
with p0 the neighborhoods of p0 , an infinite shrink­
ing sequence of sub-sets U1 D U2 D U3 D • • •, all 
containing p0 . For example, in a plane referred to 
Cartesian coordinates x, y we may choose as the nth 
neighborhood U of a point p0 =(x0 ,y0 ) the interior 
of the circle of radius 1/2n around p0 . The notion 
of convergence, basic for all continuity considera­
tions, is defined in terms of the sequence of neigh­
borhoods as follows: A sequence of points p1 ,p2,... 
converges to p0 if for every natural number n there 
is an N so that all points pv with v > N lie in the 
nth neighborhood Un ofp0. Of course, the choice of 
the neighborhoods Un is arbitrary to a certain ex­
tent. For instance, one could also have chosen as 
the nth neighborhood Vn of (x0 ,y0) the square of 
side 2/n around (x0 ,y0), to which a point (x, y) 
belongs if
-1/n < x - x0 < 1/n, -1/n < y - y0 < 1/n.
However, the sequence Vn is equivalent to the se­
quence Un in the sense that for every n there is 
an n' such that Un > C Vn (and thus Uv C Vn for 
v > n'), and also for every m there is an m' such 
that Vm i C Um; and consequently the notion of con­
vergence for points is the same, whether based on the 
one or the other sequence of neighborhoods.
It is clear how to define continuity ofa mapping of 
one manifold into another. A one-to-one mapping of 
two manifolds upon each other is called topological if 
it is continuous in both directions, and two manifolds 
that can be mapped topologically upon each other are 
topologically equivalent. Topology investigates such 
properties of manifolds as are invariant with respect 
to topological mappings (in particular, with respect 
to continuous deformations).
A continuous function y = f (x) may be approxi­
mated by piecewise linear functions. The correspond­
ing device in higher dimensions, the method of sim- 
plicial approximations of a given continuous mapping 
of one manifold into another, is of great importance 
in set-theoretic topology. It has served to develop a 
general theory of dimensions, to prove the topological 
invariance of the Betti groups, to define the decisive 
notion of the degree of mapping (“Abbildungsgrad”, 
L. E. J. Brouwer), and to prove a number of interest­
ing fixed-point theorems. For instance, a continuous 
mapping ofa square into itself has necessarily a fixed 
point, i.e., a point carried by the mapping into itself. 
Given two continuous mappings ofa (compact) man­
ifold M into another M', one can ask more generally 
for which points p on M both images on M' coincide. 
A famous formula by S. Lefschetz relates the “total 
index” of such points with the homology theory of 
cycles on M and M'.
Application of fixed-point theorems to functional 
spaces of infinitely many dimensions has proved a 
powerful method to establish the existence of solu­
tions for non-linear differential equations. This is par­
ticularly valuable, because the hydrodynamical and 
aerodynamical problems are almost all of this type.
Poincare found that a satisfactory formulation of 
the homology theory of cycles was possible only 
from the second standpoint where the n-dimensional 
manifold is considered as a conglomerate of n- 
dimensional cells. The boundary of an n-dimensional 
cell (n-cell) consists of a finite number of (n - 1)- 
cells, the boundary of an (n - 1)-cell consists of a 
finite number of (n - 2)-cells, etc. The combinato­
rial skeleton of the manifold is obtained by assigning 
symbols to these cells and then stating in terms of their 
symbols which (i - 1)-cells belong to the boundary 
of any of the occurring i-cells (i =1, 2,...,n). From 
the cells one descends to the points of the man­
ifold by a repeated process of subdivision which 
catches the points in an ever finer net. Since this 
subdivision proceeds according to a fixed combi­
natorial scheme, the manifold is in topological re­
gard completely fixed by its combinatorial skeleton. 
And at once the question arises under what circum­
stances two given combinatorial skeletons represent 

WEYL: A Half-century of Mathematics
407
the same manifold, i.e., lead by iterated subdivision to 
topologically equivalent manifolds. We are far from 
being able to solve this fundamental problem. Alge­
braic topology, which operates with the combinatorial 
skeletons, is in itself a rich and beautiful theory, linked 
in various ways with the basic notions and theorems 
of algebra and group theory.
The connection between algebraic and set- 
theoretic topology is fraught with serious difficulties 
which are not yet overcome in a quite satisfactory 
manner. So much, however, seems clear that one 
had better start, not with a division into cells, but 
with a covering by patches which are allowed to 
overlap. From such a pattern the fundamental topo­
logically invariant concepts are to be developed. The 
above notion of an abstract integral, which relates 
homology and cohomology, is an indication; it can 
indeed be used for a direct proof of the invariance of 
the first Betti number without the tool of simplicial 
approximation.
Conformal mapping, meromorphic 
functions, Calculus of variations in the large
Homology theory, in combination with the Dirichlet 
principle or the method of orthogonal projection in 
Hilbert space, leads to the theory of harmonic inte­
grals, in particular for the lowest dimension n =2to 
the theory of abelian integrals on Riemann surfaces. 
But for Riemann surfaces the Dirichlet principle also 
yields the fundamental facts concerning uniformiza- 
tion of analytic functions of one variable if one com­
bines it with the homotopy (not homology) theory of 
closed curves. Whereas a cycle is homologous to zero 
if it bounds, it is homotopic to zero if it can be con­
tracted into a point by continuous deformation. The 
homotopy theory of 1- and more-dimensional cycles 
has recently come to the fore as an important branch 
of topology, and the group-theoretic aspect of homo­
topy has led to some surprising discoveries in abstract 
group theory.
Homotopy of 1-dimensional cycles is closely re­
lated with the idea of the universal covering manifold 
of a given manifold. Given a continuous mapping 
p ^ p' of one manifold M into another M', the point 
p' may be considered as the trace or projection in M' 
of the arbitrary point p on M, and thus M becomes 
a manifold covering M'. There may be no point or 
several points p on M which lie over a given point 
p' of M' (which are mapped into p'). The mapping 
is without ramifications if, for any point p0 of M,it 
is one-to-one (and continuous both ways) in a suffi­
ciently small neighborhood ofp0 .Letp0 be a point 
on M, p0 its trace on M', and C' a curve on M' be­
ginning at p0. If M covers M' without ramifications 
we can follow this curve on M by starting at p0 ,at 
least up to a certain point where we would run against 
a “boundary of M relative to M'”
Of chief interest are those covering manifolds M 
over a given M' for which this never happens and 
which therefore cover M' without ramifications and 
relative boundaries. The best way of defining the cen­
tral topological notion “simply connected” is by de­
scribing a simply connected manifold as one hav­
ing no other unramified unbounded covering but it­
self. There is a strongest of all unramified unbounded 
covering manifolds, the universal covering manifold, 
which can be described by the statement that on it 
a curve C is closed only if its trace C' is (closed 
and) homotopic to zero. The proof of the funda­
mental theorem on uniformization consists of two 
parts:
1. constructing the universal covering manifold of 
the given Riemann surface;
2. constructing by means of the Dirichlet principle 
a one-to-one conformal mapping of the covering 
manifold upon the interior of a circle of finite or 
infinite radius.
All we have discussed so far in our account of 
analysis is in some way tied up with operators and 
projections in Hilbert space, the analogue in in­
finitely many dimensions of Euclidean space. In H. 
Minkowski’s Geometry of Numbers, distances |AB |, 
which are different from the Euclidean distance but 
satisfy the axioms that |BA| = |AB | and that in a 
triangle ABC the inequality \AC| < |AB\ + \BC| 
holds, were used to great advantage for obtaining nu­
merous results concerning the solvability of inequal­
ities by integers. We do not find time here to report 
on the progress of this attractive branch of number 
theory during the last fifty years. In infinitely many 
dimensions spaces endowed with a metric of this sort, 
of a more general nature than the Euclid-Hilbert met­
ric, have been introduced by Banach, not however for 
number-theoretic but for purely analytic purposes. 
Whether the importance of the subject justifies the 
large number of papers written on Banach spaces is 
perhaps questionable.
The Dirichlet principle is but the simplest example 
of the direct methods of the Calculus of Variations as 
they came into use with the turn of the century. It was 

408
Surveys
by these methods that the theory of minimal surfaces, 
so closely related to that of analytic functions, was 
put on a new footing. What we know about non-linear 
differential equations has been obtained either by the 
topological fixed-point method (see above), or by the 
so-called continuity method, or by constructing their 
solutions as extremals of a suitable functional.
A continuous function on an n-dimensional com­
pact manifold assumes somewhere a minimum and 
somewhere else a maximum value. Interpret the func­
tion as altitude. Besides summit (local maximum) and 
bottom (local minimum) one has the further possibil­
ity of a saddle point (pass) as a point of “stationary” 
altitude. In n dimensions the several possibilities are 
indicated by an inertial index k which is capable of 
the values k =0, 1, 2,...,n,thevaluek = 0 charac­
terizing a minimum and k = n a maximum. Marston 
Morse discovered the inequality Mk > Bk between 
the number Mk of stationary points of index k and the 
Betti number Bk of linearly independent homology 
classes of k-dimensional cycles. In their generaliza­
tion to functional spaces these relations have opened 
a line of study adequately described as Calculus of 
Variation in the large.
Development of the theory of uniformization for 
analytic functions led to a closer investigation of con­
formal mapping of 2-dimensional manifolds in the 
large, which resulted in a number of theorems of sur­
prising simplicity and beauty. In the same field there 
is to register an enormous extension of our knowledge 
of the behavior of meromorphic functions, i.e., single­
valued analytic functions of the complex variable z 
which are regular everywhere with the exception of 
isolated “poles” (points of infinity). Towards the end 
of the previous century Riemann’s zeta function had 
provided the stimulus for a deeper study of “entire 
functions” (functions without poles).
The greatest stride forward, both in methods and 
results, was marked by a paper on meromorphic func­
tions published in 1925 by the Finnish mathematician 
Rolf Nevanlinna. Besides meromorphic functions in 
the z-plane one can study such functions on a given 
Riemann surface; and in the way in which the theory 
of algebraic functions (equal to meromorphic func­
tions on a compact Riemann surface) as a theory of 
algebraic curves in two complex dimensions may be 
generalized to any number of dimensions, so one can 
pass from meromorphic functions to meromorphic 
curves.
The theory of analytic functions of several complex 
variables, in spite of a number of deep results, is still 
in its infancy.
Geometry
After having dealt at some length with the problems 
of analysis and topology I must be brief about ge­
ometry. Of subjects mentioned before, minimal sur­
faces, conformal mapping, algebraic manifolds and 
the whole of topology could be subsumed under the 
title of geometry.
In the domain of elementary axiomatic geometry 
one strange discovery, that of von Neumann’s point­
less “continuous geometries” stands out, because it 
is intimately interrelated with quantum mechanics, 
logic and the general algebraic theory of “lattices”. 
The 1 -, 2-,..., n-dimensional linear manifolds of 
an n-dimensional vector space form the 0-, 1-, ..., 
(n - 1)-dimensional linear manifolds in an (n - 1)- 
dimensional projective point space. The usual ax­
iomatic foundation of projective geometry uses the 
points as the primitive elements or atoms of which 
the higher-than-zero-dimensional manifolds are com­
posed.
However, there is possible a treatment where the 
linear manifolds of all dimensions figure as elements, 
and the axioms deal with the relation “B contains A” 
(A C B) between these elements and the operation of 
intersection, A n B, and of union, A U B, performed 
on them; the union A U B consists of all sums x + y 
of a vector x in A and a vector y in B. In quantum 
logic this relation and these operations correspond to 
the relation of implication (“The statement A implies 
B”) and the operations ‘and’, ‘or’ in classical logic. 
But whereas in classical logic the distributive law
An (BUC)=(AnB)U (AnC)
holds, this is not so in quantum logic; it must be 
replaced by the weaker axiom:
IfC C A, thenAn (B U C)=(AnB) U C.
On formulating the axioms without the implica­
tion of finite dimensionality one will come across 
several possibilities; one leads to the Hilbert space in 
which quantum mechanics operates, another to von 
Neumann’s continuous geometry with its continuous 
scale of dimensions, in which elements of arbitrarily 
low dimensions exist but none of dimension zero.
The most important development of geometry in 
the twentieth century took place in differential geom­
etry and was stimulated by general relativity, which 
showed that the world is a 4-dimensional manifold 
endowed with a Riemannian metric. A piece ofan n- 
dimensional manifold can be mapped in one-to-one 
continuous fashion upon a piece of the n-dimensional 

WEYL: A Half-century of Mathematics

“arithmetical space” which consists of all n-tuples 
(x1 ,x2 ,...,xn) of real numbers xi. A Riemann 
metric assigns to a line element which leads from 
the point P =(x1 ,x2 ,...,xn) to the infinitely near 
point P' = (x 1 + dx 1, x 2 + dx 2,... ,xn + dxn) a 
distance ds, the square of which is a quadratic form 
of the relative coordinates dxi ,
ds2 = 
gij dxi dxj , 
(i, j =1,...,n)
with coefficients gij depending on the point P but not 
on the line element. This means that, in the infinitely 
small, Pythagoras’s theorem and hence Euclidean ge­
ometry are valid, but in general not in a region of finite 
extension. The line elements at a point may be consid­
ered as the infinitesimal vectors of an n-dimensional 
vector space inP, the tangent space or the compass at 
P; indeed an arbitrary (differentiable) transformation 
of the coordinates xi induces a linear transformation 
of the components dxi of any line element at a given 
point P .
As Levi-Civita found in 1915, the development 
of Riemannian geometry hinges on the fact that a 
Riemannian metric uniquely determines an infinites­
imal parallel displacement of the vector compass at 
P to any infinitely near point P'. From this a gen­
eral scheme for differential geometry arose in which 
each point P of the manifold is associated with a ho­
mogeneous space Sp described by a definite group 
of “authomorphisms”, this space now taking over the 
role of the tangent space (whose group of authomor- 
phisms consists of all non-singular linear transforma­
tions). One assumes that one knows how this associ­
ated space Sp is transferred by infinitesimal displace­
ment to the space Sp> associated with any infinitely 
near point P'. The most fundamental notion of Rie- 
mannian geometry, that of curvature, which figures 
so prominently in Einstein’s equations of the gravita­
tional field, can be carried over to this general scheme. 
Thus one has erected general differential affine, pro­
jective, conformal, geometries, etc.
One has also tried by their structures to account 
for the other physical fields existing in nature be­
side the gravitational one, namely the electromag­
netic field, the electronic wave-field and further fields 
corresponding to the several kinds of elementary par­
ticles. But it seems to the author that so far all such 
speculative attempts of building up a unified field 
theory have failed. There are very good reasons for 
interpreting gravitation in terms of the basic concepts 
of differential geometry. But it is probably unsound 
to try to “geometrize” all physical entities.
Differential geometry in the large is an interesting 
field of investigation which relates the differential 
properties of a manifold with its topological structure. 
The schema of differential geometry explained above 
with its associated spaces Sp and their displacements 
has a purely topological kernel which has recently 
developed under the name of fibre spaces into an 
important topological technique.
Our account of progress made during the last fifty 
years in analysis, geometry and topology had to touch 
on many special subjects. It would have failed com­
pletely had it not imparted to the reader some feeling 
of the close relationship connecting all these mathe­
matical endeavors. As the last example of fibre spaces 
(beside many others) shows, this unity in diversity 
even makes a clear-cut division into analysis, geom­
etry, topology (and algebra) practically impossible.
Foundations
Finally, a few words about the foundations of math­
ematics. The nineteenth century had witnessed the 
critical analysis of all mathematical notions includ­
ing that of natural numbers to the point where they got 
reduced to pure logic and the ideas “set” and “map­
ping”. At the end of the century it became clear that 
the unrestricted formation of sets, subsets of sets, sets 
of sets etc., together with an unimpeded application to 
them as to the original elements of the logical quan­
tifiers “there exists” and “all” [cf. the sentences: the 
(natural) number n is even if there exists a number x 
such that n =2x;itisoddifn is different from 2x for 
all x] inexorably leads to antinomies. The three most 
characteristic contributions of the twentieth century 
to the solution of this Gordian knot are connected 
with the names of L. E. J. Brouwer, David Hilbert 
and Kurt Godel. Brouwer’s critique of “mathemati­
cal existentialism” not only dissolved the antinomies 
completely, but also destroyed a good part of classi­
cal mathematics that had heretofore been universally 
accepted.
If only the historical event that somebody has suc­
ceeded in constructing a (natural) number n with the 
given property P can give a right to the assertion 
that “there exists a number with that property,” then 
the alternative that there either exists such a num­
ber or that all numbers have the opposite property 
non-P is without foundation. The principle of ex­
cluded middle for such sentences may be valid for 
God who surveys the infinite sequence of all nat­
ural numbers, as it were, with one glance, but not 
for human logic. Since the quantifiers “there is” and 

410
Surveys
“all” are piled upon each other in the most manifold 
way in the formation of mathematical propositions, 
Brouwer’s critique makes almost all of them mean­
ingless, and therefore Brouwer set out to build up a 
new mathematics which makes no use of that logical 
principle.
I think that everybody has to accept Brouwer’s cri­
tique who wants to hold on to the belief that mathe­
matical propositions tell the sheer truth, truth based 
on evidence. At least Brouwer’s opponent, Hilbert, 
accepted it tacitly. He tried to save classical mathe­
matics by converting it from a system of meaningful 
propositions into a game of meaningless formulas, 
and by showing that this game never leads to two 
formulas, F and non-F, which are inconsistent. Con­
sistency, not truth, is his aim. His attempts at proving 
consistency revealed the astonishingly complex log­
ical structure of mathematics. The first steps were 
promising indeed. But then Godel’s discovery cast a 
deep shadow over Hilbert’s enterprise. Consistency 
itself may be expressed by a formula. What Godel 
showed was this: If the game of mathematics is actu­
ally consistent, then the formula of consistency can­
not be proved within this game. How can we then 
hope to prove it at all?
This is where we stand now. It is pretty clear that 
our theory of the physical world is not a descrip­
tion of the phenomena as we perceive them, but is 
a bold symbolic construction. However, one may be 
surprised to learn that even mathematics shares this 
character. The success of the anti-phenomenological 
constructive method is undeniable. And yet the ulti­
mate foundations on which it rests remain a mystery, 
even in mathematics.

Introduction
The last century has been a golden age for mathemat­
ics. Many important, long-standing problems have 
been resolved, in large part because of the growing 
understanding of the complex interactions among the 
subfields of mathematics. As those relationships con­
tinue to expand and deepen, mathematics is beginning 
to reach out to explore interactions with other areas of 
science. These interactions, both within diverse areas 
of mathematics and between mathematics and other 
fields of science, have led to some great insights and 
to the broadening and deepening of the field of math­
ematics. I discuss some of these interactions and in­
sights, describe a few mathematical achievements of 
the twentieth century, and pose some challenges and 
opportunities that await us in the twenty-first century.

The world of mathematics
In discussing our subject, we mathematicians face a 
dilemma. The most effective way to explain mathe­
matics to general readers is to use metaphors, which 
entails a loss of precision and carries the risk of mis­
understanding. On the other hand, advanced mathe­
matical terms are incomprehensible to most people— 
including other scientists. As my colleague David 
Mumford, former president of the International Math­
ematics Union, has said, “I am accustomed, as a pro­
fessional mathematician, to living in a sort of vacuum, 
surrounded by people who . . . declare with an odd 
sort of pride that they are mathematically illiterate.”
Within the mathematical community, however, the 
use of a precise language is a distinct advantage. Be­
cause of its abstract nature and universality, mathe­
matics knows neither linguistic nor political bound­
aries. It is one reason that mathematics has always 
carried a distinctly international flavor. A mathemati­
cian in Japan can usually read the paper of a colleague 
in Germany without translation.
The number of highly active research mathematical 
scientists worldwide is small—probably well under 
10,000—so that a given subfield may be populated by 
a small number of highly specialized individuals. By 
necessity, these colleagues know one another well, 
regardless of country of residence, and collaborate 
over long distances. During the present century, a 
growing number of papers have been co-authored by 
mathematicians from different nations (the number 
rose by about 50% between 1981 and 1993). And so 
mathematicians are well adapted to the current trend 
toward a world of vanishing borders.
But what is it that these mathematicians do? In 
general, mathematics can be described as the search 
for structures and patterns that bring order and sim­
plicity to our universe. It may be said that the object 
or beginning point of a mathematical study is not as 
important as the patterns and coherence that emerge. 
And it is these patterns and coherence that give math­
ematics its power, because they often bring clarity to 
a completely different object or process—to another 
branch of mathematics, another science, or to society 
at large.
When mathematicians speak of their work, two 
words carry great importance. Mathematics is a field 
where a “problem” is not a bad thing. In fact, a good 
problem is what mathematicians yearn for; it sig­
nifies interesting work. The second word is “proof”, 
which strongly suggests the rigor of the discipline. Sir 
Arthur Eddington once said, “Proof is an idol before 
which the mathematician tortures himself.” A mathe­
matical proof is a formal and logical line of reasoning 
that begins with a set of axioms and moves through 
logical steps to a conclusion. A proof, once given, is 
411

permanent; some have existed since the times of the 
Greeks. A proof confirms truth for the mathemati­
cian the way experiment or observation does for the 
natural scientist.
The twentieth century has been a fertile time for 
the resolution of long-standing problems, and for a 
wealth of accomplishments that would require at least 
an encyclopedia to describe. Let us look at just two 
of the more interesting achievements—solutions to 
problems that were over 300 years old. Both occurred 
toward the end of the century and could have suc­
ceeded only because of the mathematics that preceded 
them.
Fermat’s Last Theorem
The first is the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem by 
Andrew Wiles, which made news around the globe in 
1993. This example is interesting because of Fermat, 
an eccentric jurist and amateur mathematician who 
published no papers; because of Wiles, who toiled on 
the problem alone for seven years; and because of the 
problem itself, whose solution depended on funda­
mental advances in number theory by many mathe­
maticians over a period of 350 years, especially during 
the last half-century.
The theorem was written in 1637, when Pierre 
de Fermat was studying an ancient text on number 
theory called Arithmetica, by Diophantus. Interest in 
number theory had waned since the time of the an­
cient Greeks, but Fermat loved numbers. He came 
across the famous Pythagorean equation most of us 
learn in school: x2 + y2 = z2. Even today, countless 
schoolchildren learn to say, “The square of the hy­
potenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other 
two sides.”
Of particular interest are solutions to the 
Pythagorean equation in whole numbers, such as the 
beautiful 3-4-5 right triangle. When Fermat saw this, 
he noted that for any exponent greater than two, the 
equation could not have solutions in whole numbers. 
He also wrote, in Latin, that he had discovered his own 
wonderful proof, but that the margin was too small 
to contain it. No such proof has ever been found. 
Fermat made many such marginal comments (some 
regarded as taunts to his fellow mathematicians), and 
over the centuries they were all resolved except this 
one, Fermat’s Last Theorem.
Andrew Wiles first came across Fermat at age 10, 
in a library in Cambridge, England, where he grew 
up. He decided that some day he would prove it. By 
the time he was a young mathematician, however, he 
had learned that pursuing Fermat by itself was not 
advisable, and decided to work instead, in a complex 
area of algebraic number theory known as Iwasawa 
theory. But he never forgot about Fermat.
In 1986 he learned ofa breakthrough: a colleague, 
Ken Ribet at the University of California at Berke­
ley, had linked Fermat’s Last Theorem to another un­
solved problem, the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, a 
surprising and brilliant formulation in algebraic ge­
ometry posed in 1955. To summarize a very com­
plex sequence of reasoning, this linkage showed that 
proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would also 
prove Fermat’s Last Theorem as well. It constructed 
a logical bridge between the intricate worlds of ellip­
tic curves and modular forms, a kind of dictionary 
that allows questions and insights to be translated be­
tween the two worlds. It also meant that Wiles’s earlier 
work in algebraic number theory would be helpful, 
and that he would probably generate some interesting 
problems—whether or not he found a proof.
He did find a proof—after a series of baffling ob­
stacles and sudden insights. Even after he had pre­
sented his results, a crucial error was found during 
the refereeing process, which led to a further year’s 
work. Again, there seemed to be no solution—and 
again, there was one. Wiles called this last insight 
“the most important moment of my working life. 
It was so indescribably beautiful, it was so simple 
and elegant and I just stared in disbelief for twenty 
minutes.”
Perhaps I can best describe my experience of 
doing mathematics in terms of a journey through 
a dark unexplored mansion. You enter the first 
room of the mansion and it’s completely dark. 
You stumble around bumping into furniture, but 
generally you learn where each piece of furniture 
is, Finally, after six months or so, you find the 
light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it’s 
all illuminated. You can see exactly where you 
were. Then you move into the next room and 
spend another six months in the dark. So each 
of these breakthroughs, while sometimes they’re 
momentary, sometimes over a period of a day or 
two, they are the culmination of—and couldn’t 
exist without—the many months of stumbling 
around in the dark that precede them.
Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat’s Last
Theorem in 1993
Did Fermat really complete his own proof in the 
seventeenth century? Undoubtedly, some will con­
tinue to look for evidence that he did, but it is 

GRIFFITHS: Mathematics at the Turn of the Millennium

highly unlikely. Wiles’s work made use of whole 
subfields of nineteenth and twentieth century mathe­
matics that didn’t exist in Fermat’s time. Beneath 
Fermat’s equation now lies an enormous and elab­
orate formal structure—the kind of structure that 
mathematicians strive for. The solution to Fermat 
arises from the implications of understanding that 
structure.
Kepler’s Sphere Packing Conjecture
The second problem is Kepler’s Sphere Packing Con­
jecture. Like the Fermat problem, sphere packing 
could have been solved in the way it was only in 
the last few decades. Even so, it took Thomas Hales, 
professor of mathematics at the University of Michi­
gan, ten years to do so. Like Fermat, sphere packing 
sounds simple, but it defeated mathematicians for 
nearly four centuries. Moreover, both problems had 
subtle difficulties that led countless mathematicians 
to believe that they had found solutions—but those 
“solutions” turned out to be false.
The question was posed in the latter half of the 
sixteenth century, when Sir Walter Raleigh asked the 
English mathematician Thomas Harriot for a quick 
way to estimate the number of cannonballs that could 
be stacked on the deck of a ship. In turn, Harriot 
wrote to Johannes Kepler, the German astronomer, 
who was already interested in stacking: how could 
spheres be arranged to minimize the gaps among 
them? Kepler could find no system more efficient 
than the way sailors naturally stack cannonballs, or 
grocers stack oranges, known as face-centered cubic 
packing. Kepler declared that by this technique “the 
packing will be the tightest possible, so that in no 
other arrangement could more pellets be stuffed into 
the same container.” This assertion became known as 
the Kepler conjecture.
Major progress was made in the nineteenth cen­
tury, when the legendary German mathematician 
Carl Friedrich Gauss proved that the orange-pile ar­
rangement was the most efficient among all “lattice­
packings”, but this didn’t rule out the possibility of a 
more efficient non-lattice arrangement. By the twen­
tieth century the Kepler conjecture was deemed suf­
ficiently important for David Hilbert to include it in 
his list of 23 great unsolved problems.
The problem is difficult because of the immense 
number of possibilities that must be eliminated. By 
the mid-twentieth century, mathematicians knew how 
to reduce it to a finite problem, but the problem was 
too complex to compute. A major advance came in 
1953 when the Hungarian mathematician Laszlo Fe- 
jes Toth reduced the problem to a huge calculation 
involving many specific cases and also suggested how 
it might be solved by computer.
Even for Hales the challenge was immense. His 
equation has 150 variables, each of which must be 
changed to describe every conceivable stacking ar­
rangement. The proof that Kepler was right, explained 
in a 250-page argument that contains 3 gigabytes of 
computer files, relies extensively on methods from the 
theory of global optimization, linear programming, 
and interval arithmetic. Hales acknowledged that for 
a proof so long and complex, it would be some time 
before anyone could confirm all its details.
It is worth noting, however, that this exercise was 
far from frivolous. The topic of sphere packing be­
longs to a crucial part of the mathematics that lies 
behind the error-detecting and error-correcting codes 
that are widely used to store information on com­
pact disks and to compress information for transmis­
sion around the world. In today’s information society, 
it is difficult to think of a more significant applica­
tion.
The four-color problem
As an addendum to sphere-packing, a related prob­
lem is worth mentioning—the so-called four-color 
problem of map-making. This is the assertion that 
only four colors are needed to color any map so that 
no neighboring countries have the same color. This 
problem is similar to sphere packing: it is an elemen­
tary problem that probably seemed straightforward 
enough when first proposed by the English mathe­
matician Francis Guthrie in 1852. It is also similar in 
that the existing proof reduces it to a finite problem, 
which then required heavy amounts of computing ca­
pability.
The proof, accomplished in 1976 by Wolfgang 
Haken and Kenneth Appel, involved showing that 
if every one of a list of x maps is four-colorable, 
then all maps are four-colorable. Although the num­
ber of conceivable maps is infinite, Haken and Appel 
showed that the colorability of all of them depends 
only on the colorability of a large but finite set of fun­
damental maps. This was the first significant problem 
to succumb to the raw power of the computer. At the 
same time, it has caused some people to suggest that 
“brute-force” computer proofs lack the clarity of tra­
ditional proof: that is, they prove that the conjecture 
is true, but do not explain why. We may expect further 
debate on this point.

The dual nature of mathematics
We have spoken of mathematics’ reputation for smug­
ness; in fact, it has been called the Queen of Sciences: 
somewhat superior, unto herself. There is a feeling of 
blue sky, of airy exercises performed for their own 
sake. Indeed, the mathematician G. H. Hardy once 
said that the practice of mathematics can be justified 
only as an art form.
In fact, there is a parallel with the arts here. Math­
ematicians, like artists, rely heavily on aesthetics as 
well as intuition, and it is not uncommon to solve 
problems while taking a shower or a walk. But with 
respect to utility, the argument in mathematicians’ fa­
vor is a strong one. To mention just a few examples, 
the modern computer would not exist without Leib­
niz’s binary number code; Einstein could not have 
formulated his Theory of Relativity without the de­
velopment of Riemannian geometry, and the edifices 
of quantum mechanics, crystallography, and commu­
nications technology all rest firmly on the platform 
of group theory.
Moreover, the “reach” of mathematicians seems 
large in relation to their number. That is, the mental 
constructs of mathematicians (a tiny sub-population 
of a single species on a single planet) seem to re­
flect principles that apply throughout the universe. 
Earlier in the century, the physicist Eugene Wigner 
called this phenomenon “the unreasonable effective­
ness of [abstract] mathematics in the natural sci­
ences”; nowadays, one would add effectiveness in 
drug design, finance, and many other fields. There are 
many opinions about the ultimate origin of mathemat­
ical constructs. Arthur Jaffe suggests: “Mathematical 
ideas do not spring full grown from the minds of 
researchers. Mathematics often takes its inspirations 
from patterns in nature. Lessons distilled from one 
encounter with nature continue to serve as well when 
we explore other natural phenomena.”
Mathematicians have always carried their discov­
eries into adjacent fields where they have produced 
new insights and whole new subfields. Francis Bacon, 
at the dawn of the Enlightenment in 1605, prefigured 
this principle of integrative science with an apt im­
age: “No perfect discovery can be made upon a flat 
or a level: neither is it possible to discover the more 
remote or deeper parts of any science, if you stand 
but upon the level of the same science and ascend not 
to a higher science.”
Repeatedly in the twentieth century, mathematics 
has ascended to that higher place. For example, the 
development of x-ray tomography (the CAT and MRI 
scanning technologies) was built upon integral ge­
ometry; the generation of codes for secure transmis­
sion of data depends on the arithmetic of prime num­
bers; and the design of large, efficient networks in 
telecommunications uses infinite-dimensional repre­
sentations of groups.
Thus mathematics has a dual nature: it is both an 
independent discipline valued for precision and in­
trinsic beauty, and it is a rich source of tools for the 
world of applications. And the two parts of this dual­
ity are intimately connected. As we see in the follow­
ing section, it is the strengthening of these connec­
tions during the twentieth century that has allowed 
the field steadily to gain effectiveness—both within 
mathematics and in the world beyond.
3 
Trends of the twentieth 
century
A principal reason that mathematics is healthy today 
is the breakdown of barriers within the field. At first 
glance, the full span of mathematics—an enormous 
body of concepts, conjectures, hypotheses, and the­
orems amassed over more than 2000 years—seems 
to defy the possibility of unity. Gone are the days 
when a single giant—an Euler or a Gauss—could 
command its entirety. With the rapid development of 
subfields after World War II, mathematics became 
so specialized that practitioners had difficulty com­
municating with anyone outside their own specialty. 
And today these specialists are commonly scattered 
among Bonn, Princeton, Berkeley, and Tokyo.
But this trend toward fragmentation is comple­
mented by the growing tendency to address inter­
esting problems in an overarching manner. Subfields, 
once viewed as quite disjoint, are now seen as parts of 
a whole, as new connections emerge between them. 
For example, algebraic geometry, the field I am most 
familiar with, combines algebra, geometry, topology, 
and analysis. As we near the end of this century, syn­
ergies in this strongly interconnected area have played 
a major role in some of the crowning achievements of 
pure mathematics. One, of course, is the solution of 
Fermat’s Last Theorem. Another is the solution of the 
Mordell Conjecture, which states that a polynomial 
equation of degree 4 or more with rational coefficients 
can have at most a finite number of rational solutions 
(the Fermat equation has no such solutions). A third 
is the solution of the Weil conjectures, which are 
the analogs for finite fields of the Riemann hypoth­
esis. All these accomplishments reflect the ability of 

GRIFFITHS: Mathematics at the Turn of the Millennium
415
mathematicians simultaneously to draw on multiple 
subfields and to perceive their subject as a whole.
Solitons
One of the most remarkable achievements of math­
ematics of the latter half of the twentieth century is 
the theory of solitons, which illustrates the underly­
ing unity of the field. Solitons are non-linear waves 
that exhibit extremely unexpected and interesting be­
havior.
Let me give a bit of background. Traditionally, we 
talk about two different kinds of waves. The first, 
linear waves, are familiar in everyday life; examples 
are light waves or sound waves. Linear waves move 
uniformly through space without changing. That is, 
they have a constant velocity, no matter what their 
shape; C-sharp travels at the same speed as F-flat. 
And they have a constant wavelength; a C-sharp re­
mains C-sharp if you hear it a block away. Linear 
waves also obey the property of superposition: if you 
play multiple notes on the piano simultaneously, you 
always hear the sum of all notes at once, which brings 
us harmony. Even a very complicated sound can be 
resolved into its constituent harmonics.
The second kind of waves, non-linear waves, are 
less familiar and quite different. A simple exam­
ple can be seen as an ocean wave approaches 
the shore. The amplitude, wavelength, and velocity, 
which are constant in linear waves, all can be seen to 
change. The distance between wave-tops decreases, 
the height increases as the waves “feel” the bottom, 
and the velocity changes; the upper part overtakes the 
bottom part and falls over it as the wave breaks. In an 
even more intricate event, two waves may come to­
gether, interact in a complicated, non-linear way, and 
give rise to three waves instead of two.
Now we come to solitons. The story begins in 1834 
when a Scottish engineer named John Scott Russell 
was trying to determine the most efficient design for 
a canal boat. One day, he observed that waves in a 
shallow canal sometimes behaved in a very peculiar 
fashion. Waves might travel long distances at a con­
stant velocity without changing shape, but those with 
large amplitude went faster than those with small 
amplitude. A large wave might overtake a smaller 
one, resulting in a complex interaction, whereupon 
the large wave would emerge traveling faster than the 
smaller one. After this non-linear interaction, they 
would again act like linear waves.
In the middle of the twentieth century, a group 
of mathematicians were studying a non-linear wave 
equation. Because it described non-linear waves, they 
expected that its solution would develop singularities, 
or breaks, at some point, just as intersecting waves in­
teract and break in a non-linear fashion. They wrote a 
computer program to solve the equation numerically 
and found that the wave did not break as expected. 
This led them to look at the Korteweg-de Vries equa­
tion, which was written down a century ago to de­
scribe the behavior of waves in shallow water. It was 
found that the phenomena observed by Russell were 
provable mathematically for the Korteweg-de Vries 
equation; in other words, the solution to that equa­
tion exhibited soliton behavior. These are extremely 
unusual equations, because solitons are in some ways 
like linear waves and in other ways like non-linear 
waves.
This discovery provoked a rush of activity, which 
exhibited in the most beautiful way the unity of math­
ematics. It involved developments in computation, 
and in mathematical analysis, which is the traditional 
way to study differential equations. It turns out that 
one can understand the solutions to these differential 
equations through certain very elegant constructions 
in algebraic geometry. The solutions are also inti­
mately related to representation theory, in that these 
equations turn out to have an infinite number of hid­
den symmetries.
Finally, they relate back to problems in elementary 
geometry. For example, an interesting problem is to 
find the surface of a cone with a fixed volume but 
least area among all surfaces with a given bound­
ary. It’s not at all evident that this has anything to do 
with a shallow water wave, but in fact it does. The 
differential equations that describe the solution turn 
out to have soliton behavior like that of the equations 
describing shallow water waves, So we have started 
with two mathematical problems—one in mathemat­
ical physics and one in differential geometry—and 
found that each exhibits the same extremely rare and 
interesting soliton behavior.
Mathematics and other sciences
Beyond the breakdown of internal barriers, mathe­
matics has become much more interactive with other 
sciences and with business, finance, security, man­
agement, decision-making, and the modeling of com­
plex systems. And some of these disciplines, in turn, 
are challenging mathematicians with interesting new 
types of problems, which then lead to new applica­
tions.

416

Mathematics and theoretical physics
This is nowhere better illustrated than in theoretical 
physics. Beyond the purely mathematical contribu­
tions, algebraic geometry has been used by theoretical 
physicists in their search for a unified field theory—or 
more precisely, for a theory that unifies gravity with 
the three fundamental forces of physics: the strong 
nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and electro­
magnetism.
One exciting candidate for a new unifying theory 
is string theory. The name comes from the idea that 
the most elementary building blocks of matter are 
tiny vibrating loops or segments that are string-like 
in shape and vibrate in many different modes, like 
violin strings. The effort to understand this extremely 
complex theory has led a group of theoretical physi­
cists deep into mathematics, where they have made a 
series of spectacular predictions about mathematics; 
these predictions are beginning to be verified. These 
results have stimulated a flurry of work that contin­
ues to add to the plausibility of the theory. It has also 
spawned a new branch of four-dimensional mathe­
matics called quantum geometry, which, in turn, is 
opening new insights to physics.
Another indication of the close relationship be­
tween mathematics and physics was seen in the 1998 
awards of the Fields Medals, the highest honor in 
mathematics. Of the four medalists, three worked in 
areas with strong physical influences, and a special 
award was given for work in quantum computing, 
which has its roots in quantum mechanics.
Mathematics and the life sciences
One of the fastest-growing new partnerships is the 
collaboration between mathematics and biology. The 
partnership began in the field of ecology in the 1920s, 
when the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra devel­
oped the first models of predator-prey relationships. 
He found that the waxing and waning of predator and 
prey populations of fish could be described mathe­
matically. After World War II, the modeling meth­
ods that Volterra developed for populations were ex­
tended to epidemiology, the study of diseases in large 
populations.
Most recently, the insights of molecular genetics 
have inspired scientists to adapt these same methods 
to infectious diseases, where the objects of study are 
not populations of organisms or people, but popula­
tions of cells. In a cellular system, the predator is a 
population of viruses, for example, and the prey is 
a population of human cells. These two populations 
rise and fall in a complex Darwinian struggle for sur­
vival that lends itself to mathematical descriptions. 
In the last decade, the ability to use mathematical 
models that describe infectious agents as predators 
and host cells as prey has redefined many aspects of 
immunology, genetics, epidemiology, neurology, and 
drug design. The reason this partnership is successful 
is that mathematical models offer powerful tools to 
describe the immensity of numbers and relationships 
found in biological systems.
For example, mathematical biologists have been 
able to make quantitative predictions about how 
viruses and other microbes grow in their hosts, 
how they change the genetic structure of hosts, and 
how they interact with the host’s immune system. 
Some of the most surprising results have emerged in 
the study of the AIDS epidemic, reversing our un­
derstanding of HIV viruses in infected patients. The 
prevailing view had been that HIV viruses lie dor­
mant for a period of 10 or so years before beginning 
to infect host cells and cause disease. Mathematical 
modeling has shown that the HIV viruses that cause 
the most disease are not dormant; they grow steadily 
and rapidly, with a half-life of only about two days.
Why, then, does it take an average of ten years 
for infection to begin? Again, mathematical model­
ing has shown that disease progression may be caused 
by viral evolution. The immune system is capable of 
suppressing the virus for a long time, but eventually 
new forms of viruses mutate and become abundant 
and overwhelm the immune defense. This happens 
because viruses, like other infectious agents, can re­
produce faster than their hosts, and the reproduction 
of their genetic material is less accurate. Virtually 
every HIV infection is seen as an evolutionary pro­
cess in which the virus population constantly changes 
and new virus mutants continuously emerge. Natural 
selection favors variants able to escape the immune 
response, orto infect more kinds of cells in the human 
body, orto reproduce faster. The models show that all 
evolutionary changes increase virus abundance in the 
patient and thereby accelerate disease.
These same mathematical models have brought an 
understanding of why anti-HIV drugs should be given 
in combination, and given as early as possible during 
infection. These drugs are most effective in combina­
tion because viruses seldom produce multiple muta­
tions at once. And they should be given early before 
viral evolution can progress very far.
A major threat to human health in the next cen­
tury will be microbial resistance to drug therapy, and 

GRIFFITHS: Mathematics at the Turn of the Millennium

this will be another area where mathematical mod­
els can contribute. They can present clear guidelines 
for collection and analysis of data, which can make 
drugs more effective. Good models of the complex 
interactions between infectious agents and the im­
mune system can eventually create a new discipline 
of quantitative immunology.
There are many more new partnerships between 
mathematics and the other sciences; much of the 
most innovative and productive work is being done 
at the frontiers between fields and disciplines. An 
excellent example is the study of fluid dynam­
ics. Describing the complex movement of fluids— 
hurricanes, blood flow through the heart, oil in porous 
ground—was virtually impossible before the dis­
covery that a purely mathematical construct called 
the Navier-Stokes equation can do just that. An­
other example is control theory, a branch of the 
theory of dynamical systems. In just one applica­
tion, much testing of high-performance aircraft can 
now be done by computer simulations, greatly reduc­
ing the expense and danger of wind tunnels and test 
flights.
It is important to emphasize that while modeling 
and simulation are modern and important topics, we 
are still not very good at addressing the uncertainties 
that are present in these complex simulations. Learn­
ing to grapple with uncertainty is high on the list of 
priorities for mathematicians, who must develop fun­
damentally new approaches if they are to understand 
how uncertainties arise in models and how they prop­
agate through systems. Our models will be only as 
accurate as our ability to smooth out their uncertain­
ties.

Research challenges for the 
twenty-first century
Despite the tremendous achievements of the twen­
tieth century, dozens of outstanding problems still 
await solution. Most of us would probably agree that 
the following three problems are among the most 
challenging and interesting.
The Riemann hypothesis
The first is the Riemann hypothesis, which has tanta­
lized mathematicians for 150 years. It has to do with 
the concept of prime numbers, which are the basic 
building blocks of arithmetic. A prime number is a 
positive whole number greater than 1 that cannot be 
divided by any positive number except itself and 1. 
The primes begin with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and continue 
without bound. As long ago as the third century B.C., 
Euclid proved that no one could ever find the “largest” 
prime number; in other words, the primes are infinite 
in number.
But is there a pattern to these primes? For someone 
studying them by pencil and paper, they at first appear 
to occur randomly. But in the nineteenth century, the 
German mathematician Bernhard Riemann extended 
Euclid’s observation to assert that primes are not only 
infinite in number, but they occur in a very subtle 
and precise pattern. Proving that this is so (or not 
so) is perhaps the deepest existing problem in pure 
mathematics.
The Poincare conjecture
This problem is baffling both because it is so funda­
mental and it seems so simple. In Poincare’s day, a 
century ago, it was even regarded as trivial, as was 
the whole field of topology—a field that he essentially 
invented. But today topology is a vital and significant 
subfield of mathematics.
In rough terms, topology is concerned with the 
fundamental properties of structures and spaces. A 
sphere, for example, can be stretched, compressed, 
or warped in any number of ways (in a topologist’s 
eyes) and still remain a sphere, as long as it isn’t 
torn or punctured. A topologist sees a donut and a 
coffee cup as identical, because either one of them 
can be massaged into the same basic shape as the 
other—a ring with a hole in it, or torus. Of special 
interest to topologists are manifolds, which means 
“having multiple features or forms”. A soccer ball, 
for example, is a two-dimensional manifold, or two- 
sphere; we can manipulate it any way we want as 
long as we don’t rip it, and it will still be a soccer 
ball.
Topologists seek to identify all possible manifolds, 
including the shape of the universe—which is the sub­
ject of Poincare’s conjecture. This is relatively easy 
in two dimensions, and was done by the end of the 
nineteenth century. The test of whether a manifold is 
really a two-sphere is also straightforward. Imagine 
placing a rubber band on the surface ofa soccer ball. 
If the rubber band can be shrunk to a point without 
leaving the surface, and if this can be done anywhere 
on the surface, the ball is a two-sphere, and we say 
that it is simply connected.
In 1904, Poincare conjectured that what is true 
for two dimensions is also true for three—that any 

418
Surveys
simply-connected, three-dimensional manifold (such 
as the universe) has to be a three-sphere. This sounds 
intuitively obvious, but nobody has ever shown that 
there aren’t some false three-spheres, so the conjec­
ture still hasn’t been proved. Surprisingly, proofs are 
known for the equivalent of Poincare’s conjecture for 
all dimensions strictly greater than 3, but not yet 
for 3.
Does P = NP?
A third problem is closely related to the philosophical 
question of what is knowable and what is unknowable. 
In 1931, the Austrian-born logician Kurt Godel estab­
lished that complete certainty could not be found in 
arithmetic—assuming that arithmetic is founded on 
certain “self-evident” properties, or axioms, of whole 
numbers. In the theory of computing, Alan Turing 
set down rules in the 1930s to decide what is com­
putable and what is not. A more refined question is 
to ask what is computable in polynomial time, or P 
time. In the familiar traveling salesman problem, for 
example, polynomial time means that you can write a 
computer program to compute the best route for him 
to visit n cities in a reasonable amount of computer 
time, which would be roughly n-squared or n-cubed 
time.
As the problem becomes more complex, computer 
time may increase exponentially, until the problem 
becomes computationally intractable, or NP. For ex­
ample, most cryptographic codes today are based on 
the assumption that factoring large integers is a com­
putationally intractable problem.
In fact there are some very interesting current de­
velopments on the “P vs. NP” question, which may 
be related to the Godel incompleteness theorem. It 
seems possible that certain mathematical statements 
that eventually include lower bounds on computation, 
such as “P does not equal NP”, cannot be proved 
within the framework of Peano arithmetic, the stan­
dard, or most natural, version of arithmetic. This the­
sis is not yet proved; but its resolution appears feasi­
ble in the foreseeable future. What is known is that all 
techniques used so far to prove lower bounds on com­
putational models reside in a specific low fragment 
of Peano arithmetic. Moreover, proved techniques in 
these fragments cannot separate P from NP—unless 
the integer factorization has much faster algorithms 
than we currently know or suspect. In other words, 
whether a problem is P orNP will depend on whether 
or not we can factor integers much faster than we have 
thought possible.
Theoretical computer science
The field we are discussing, theoretical computer sci­
ence, is one of the most important and active areas 
of scientific study today. It was actually founded half 
a century ago, before computers existed, when Alan 
Turing and his contemporaries set out to define math­
ematically the concept of “computation” and to study 
its powers and limits. These questions led to the prac­
tical construction by von Neumann of the first com­
puter, followed by the computer revolution we are 
witnessing today.
The practical use of computers, and the unexpected 
depth of the concept of “computation”, have sig­
nificantly expanded theoretical computer science, or 
TCS. In the last quarter-century TCS has grown into 
a rich and beautiful field, making connections to other 
sciences and attracting first-rate scientists. Here are 
just a few aspects of this evolution:
First, the focus of the field has changed from the 
notion of “computation” to the much more elusive 
concept of “efficient computation”. The fundamen­
tal notion of NP-completeness was formulated, its 
near universal impact was gradually understood, and 
long-term goals, such as resolving the P vs. NP ques­
tion, were established. The theory of algorithms and 
a variety of computational models were developed. 
Randomness became a key tool and resource, revolu­
tionizing the theory of algorithms.
Significantly, the emergence of the complexity­
based notion of one-way function, together with the 
use of randomness, led to the development of modern 
cryptography. What many people at first thought were 
just mental games, such as trying to play poker with­
out cards, has turned into a powerful theory and prac­
tical systems of major economic importance. Com­
plexity theory, which attempts to classify problems 
according to their computational difficulty, has inte­
grated many of these ideas and has given rise to the 
field of proof complexity, where the goal is to quantify 
what constitutes a difficult proof.
Beyond these activities, which are internal to TCS, 
is important cross-fertilization between TCS and 
other subfields, such as combinatorics, algebra, topol­
ogy, and analysis. Moreover, the fundamental prob­
lems of TCS, notably “P vs. NP”, have gained promi­
nence as central problems of mathematics. More and 
more mathematicians are considering the computa­
tional aspects of their areas. In other words, they 
start with the fact “An object exists” and follow 
it with the problem “How fast can this object be 
found?”

GRIFFITHS: Mathematics at the Turn of the Millennium
419
A final aspect of TCS, which is to some people the 
most interesting, is that the field now overlaps with 
a whole new set of algorithmic problems from the 
sciences. In these problems the required output is not 
well defined in advance, and it may begin with almost 
any kind of data: a picture, a sonogram, readings from 
the Hubble Space Telescope, stock-market share val­
ues, DNA sequences, neuron recordings of animals 
reacting to stimuli. Mathematical models are used to 
try to make sense of the data or predict their future 
values.
In general, the very notion of “computation”, and 
the major problems surrounding it, have taken on deep 
philosophical meaning and consequences. In addition 
to the “P vs. NP” question, the field is focused on 
a few clear and deep questions: For example: Does 
randomization help computation? What makes a the­
orem difficult to prove? and, Can quantum mechanics 
be effectively simulated by classical means? The time 
is ripe for exciting growth and fundamental new un­
derstanding throughout this new field of theoretical 
computer science.
Quantum computing
Another new and exciting area of research is the inves­
tigation of quantum computing. This topic is closely 
related to the “P vs. NP” question because of a sur­
prising demonstration in 1994. It was discovered that 
if a quantum computer could be built, it would be 
capable of breaking any computer code now used or 
thought to be secure.
The need for a fundamentally new form of com­
puting is very real, especially for running complex 
simulation models. Although modern computers are 
extremely fast, they still use the classical binary cal­
culating system of 0s and 1s that dates back 150 years 
to George Boole’s adding machine. For many years 
this has seemed sufficient, especially in the presence 
of “Moore’s Law”: the observation that the capac­
ity of computer chips doubles every two years or so 
while chip prices drop by half. This has been accom­
plished through better engineering and the production 
of smaller and smaller chips. But now, we are ap­
proaching quantum mechanical limits on how small 
a chip can be.
These limits were foreseen as early as 1982, when 
Richard Feynman predicted that efforts to simulate 
quantum mechanical systems on digital computers 
would carry an inherent “overhead”. But in a lengthy 
side remark, he proposed that this difficulty might be 
circumvented by some form of quantum computer. In 
1985, David Deutsch advanced the dialog by suggest­
ing that if quantum computers could be fast enough 
to solve quantum mechanical problems, they might 
also solve classical problems more quickly.
It appears that this is the case. In 1994, Peter W. 
Shor showed that a quantum computer could factor 
large numbers in a time that is polynomial in the 
length of the numbers, a nearly exponential speed­
up over classical algorithms. This was surprising 
for two reasons. First, modern cryptographers use 
long numbers as security codes because they are so 
difficult to factor—a job that a quantum computer 
could do rather quickly. Second, theoretical com­
puter scientists had believed that no type of com­
puting could be much faster than conventional digital 
computers.
On the other hand, experimentalists are not at all 
sure they can build a quantum computer. As they 
pursue that possibility, there are numerous parallel 
efforts to design other kinds of computers based on 
principles other than Boolean arithmetic—all with the 
same goal of greatly expanding computer capacity. 
We can expect exciting and intense work in this field 
for years to come.

Maintaining the strength 
of mathematics in the 
twenty-first century
The bulk of this essay has been devoted to trends and 
problems of research. However, it is irresponsible to 
discuss research without mentioning the context in 
which it occurs. The success of research depends on 
the quality of the people doing it and the degree to 
which it receives sustained support from society; in 
other words, it requires “patient capital”. The next 
millennium will bring a set of contextual questions 
every bit as challenging as the research problems we 
want to solve.
Education
First, how can we attract the best young talent into 
mathematics? Here we have seen a significant change 
in the last half-century. During World War II, the sys­
tem and techniques of science and technology gen­
erated much excitement, attracting post-war students 
to careers in research. This trend received a power­
ful stimulus in 1957, when the Soviet satellite Sput­
nik was launched and science was recognized for the 

420
Surveys
political and economic power it could generate. Re­
search became as important to society as it was fas­
cinating to practitioners.
Toward the end of the century, however, society’s 
interest in many areas of research appears to have 
diminished in most countries around the world. Math­
ematics and science, with some exception in biomed­
ical areas, appear not to be felt as important to so­
ciety as they once were, nor to provide desirable ca­
reer opportunities. In both developed and developing 
countries, many bright students who once would have 
chosen careers in mathematics are not doing so; they 
are choosing applied information science, business, 
or other areas where the future looks more interesting. 
There appears to be a fundamental lack of appreci­
ation for the richness and relevance of the subject 
itself.
It is ironic that student interest is low at a time when 
career opportunities for professional mathematicians 
have never been greater or more diverse. This is true 
both for the traditional disciplinary areas, which are 
rich with new developments and challenging prob­
lems, and in the applied fields and other areas of sci­
ence, where demand for mathematicians with proper 
training will continue to grow rapidly in the foresee­
able future.
An obvious reason for student disinterest is that we 
are not communicating a full picture of mathematics 
as a field where one may choose among so many intel­
lectually rewarding and challenging careers. The peo­
ple best positioned to effect this communication are 
high school teachers, college professors, and fellow 
students. However, these groups can describe current 
opportunities and fast-growing fields only if they, in 
turn, are informed by those in the profession. Thus 
the mathematics community as a whole faces a criti­
cal challenge: to foster more interaction at every level 
of teaching and practice, and to widen the channels 
of communication with the students who will even­
tually replace us and extend our work into the next 
century.
Outreach
Closely allied with our educational needs is the op­
portunity to better communicate with and educate 
the public about mathematical issues. Mathemati­
cians clearly understand the purpose and value of 
their work, but many people in government, business, 
and even education do not share this understanding. If 
mathematicians expect their research at universities 
to be supported by public funds, we must present to 
the public a more vivid picture of that research and its 
power to deepen our understanding and improve our 
well-being. It is no longer possible to remain aloof 
from the passing needs of the world or to work in an 
ivory tower.
The culture of the next millennium will be highly 
interactive and collaborative. Mathematicians must 
seize the opportunity not only to collaborate with 
other mathematicians and scientists, but also to reach 
out to the community at large. They are uniquely 
qualified to articulate the value of mathematics in 
catalyzing major advances in science and health, in 
promoting powerful economic tools and efficiencies, 
and to probing the patterns and truths of the universe 
in which we live.
Interactivity
Finally, the trend toward interactivity merits a final 
mention. We have seen that within mathematics and 
throughout the sciences much of the most productive 
work is being done at frontiers between subfields, 
fields, and disciplines. Mathematics loses something 
when it is isolated or fragmented according to disci­
plinary paradigms. However, many institutions have 
been slow to adapt to this reality. Universities around 
the world, and many industries and government agen­
cies, stand to gain much by removing barriers to col­
laborations.
In particular, much can be done to enhance inter­
actions between academic and industrial mathemati­
cians. The primary missions of academia and indus­
try are indeed different; nonetheless, the two cultures 
have much to learn from one another and can gain 
much from collaboration. In general, the scientific 
enterprise can function at full potential only when 
there is a fast flow of knowledge between the creators 
and users of mathematics.
The next millennium
The globalization, interactivity, and “opening out” of 
the mathematical enterprise is a new and powerful 
trend. As a harbinger of things to come, note the 
mode in which Thomas Hales chose to announce his 
proof of the Kepler sphere-packing problem. Rather 
than publish it in a journal, where his results would 
be seen by a small number of specialists, he opened 
it to an unlimited audience via the Internet. In ad­
dition, he frankly invited scrutiny of his proof and 

GRIFFITHS: Mathematics at the Turn of the Millennium
further contributions to its accuracy—a significant 
step in the competitive world of top-level mathe­
matics.
In general, then, we mathematicians have two ob­
jectives as we enter the next millennium. The first is to 
maintain traditional strengths in basic research, which 
is the seedbed of new thinking and new applications. 
421
The second is to broaden our exploration of the terrain 
outside the traditional boundaries of our field—to the 
other sciences and to the world beyond science. With 
each passing year, mathematicians achieve more ef­
fectiveness in their work to the degree that they offer 
it to others and include others in the world of mathe­
matics.


Afterword
G. B. Halsted names several mathematicians who participated in the Second International Congress, 
most of whom are not household names today. These include, first, the representatives of the U.S., 
Charlotte Angas Scott (1858-1931), from Bryn Mawr College [14]; of Japan, Rikitaro Fujisawa 
(1861-1933); and of Spain, Zoel Garcia de Galdeano y Yanguas (1846-1924). The last of these was 
the academic advisor of Julio Rey Pastor, who later became the central figure in the development of 
mathematics in Argentina in the twentieth century. Then there were Halsted’s “interesting person­
alities”. One of these was Samuel Dickstein (1851-1939), a Jew from Russian Poland who at the 
time of the Congress was the principal of a science-oriented secondary school in Warsaw that had 
introduced Hebrew into its curriculum and who later was one of the first professors of mathematics 
at the University of Warsaw. There were also Karl Gutzmer (1860-1924), a German mathematician 
who worked on differential equations; Emile Lemoine (1840-1912), a French civil engineer who did 
some work in geometry; Alessandro Padoa (1868-1937), an Italian logician who lectured on a new 
system of definitions for Euclidean geometry at the Congress; and Dmitrii Sintsov (1867-1946), 
who created a school of geometry at Kharkov University in Russia. One wonders what Halsted’s 
criteria for “interesting personalities” were. (Biographies of most of the mathematicians Halsted 
mentions are available online at Wikipedia or at the St. Andrews MacTutor website.)
There are several available books dealing with Hilbert’s Congress lecture on problems. These 
include the 1976 AMS publication Mathematical Developments Arising from Hilbert Problems [2], 
which contains a copy of Hilbert’s lecture, and the more recent books by Jeremy Gray, The Hilbert 
Challenge [12], and Ben Yandell, The Honors Class: Hilbert’s Problems and Their Solvers [24].
G. A. Miller mentions that the last quarter of the nineteenth century saw the beginnings of 
a research mathematics tradition in the United States. This theme is explored in great detail in 
Parshall and Rowe’s The Emergence of the American Mathematical Research Community [17]. 
More details on the arithmetization of analysis can be found in Chapter 7 of Umberto Bottazzini’s 
The Higher Calculus [1] and on the nineteenth-century developments in set theory in the chapter 
“Developments in the Foundations of Mathematics”, in I. Grattan-Guinness’s From the Calculus to 
Set Theory [3]. The history of the theory of groups is well covered in Hans Wussing’s The Genesis 
of the Abstract Group Theory [23] and in earlier articles in this volume.
H. Weyl’s article covers a good bit of ground, and there are many new works that detail various 
aspects of his story. The development of structure in algebra is dealt with by Leo Corry in Modern 
Algebra and the Rise of Mathematical Structures [6]. A detailed introduction to the theory of p-adic 
numbers is found in Fernando Gouvea’s p-adic Numbers: An Introduction [11], while one of the 
better treatments of the history of the Riemann Hypothesis is found in Prime Obsession [7], by 
John Derbyshire. Lynn Steen’s article in Chapter 1 of this volume gives more details on spectral 
423

theory and Hilbert spaces, while Thomas Hawkins has written the definitive treatment of the history 
of Lebesgue integration [13] and Jean Dieudonne’s History of Algebraic and Differential Topology 
[9] covers the developments in homology theory and other areas of algebraic topology. There is a 
brief treatment by S. S. Chern on differential geometry in the twentieth century [5], which expands 
on Weyl’s comments. Similarly, the logician Stephen Kleene has written an analysis of the work of 
Godel [14].
Phillip Griffiths refers to several long-standing problems that were resolved late in the twentieth 
century. There are book-length treatments of many of these. Simon Singh has written a solid 
history of Fermat’s Last Theorem; Fermat’s Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World’s Greatest 
Mathematical Problem [18]. The solution of Kepler’s Conjecture is well-covered in George Szpiro’s 
Kepler’s Conjecture [21]. Similarly, Robin Wilson has written the definitive book on the four-color 
problem and its solution: Four Colors Suffice [22]. As to Griffith’s trends of the twentieth century, 
there are numerous books and articles dealing with solitons. But string theory has been in the news 
lately, mostly because it has not reached its goals. A book-length study debunking the theory has 
been written by Lee Smolin: The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall ofa 
Science, and What Comes Next [19]. For a good treatment of the relationship between mathematics 
and biology, and its implications in education, consult the MAA’s Math and Bio 2010: Linking 
Undergraduate Disciplines [20].
Finally, although the Riemann conjecture has still not been solved, the Poincare conjecture is now 
a theorem. A history of this conjecture and of its recent proof by Grigory Perelman is available as 
The Poincare Conjecture: In Search of the Shape of the Universe [16], by Donal O’Shea. We also 
note that, like Hales, Perelman announced his proof by placing it on the Internet in late 2002 and 
early 2003, whereupon it took three years for experts to agree that his proof was in fact valid. The 
Poincare conjecture is the first of the seven Clay Institute Millennium Prize Problems to be solved. 
A survey of all seven problems is found in the AMS publication, The Millennium Prize Problems 
[4], and in a more accessible form in Keith Devlin’s The Millennium Problems: The Seven Greatest 
Unsolved Mathematical Puzzles of Our Time [8]. Besides the Riemann Hypothesis, the P versus NP 
problem is also on this list, and the reader should consult Devlin’s book or the book by Garey and 
Johnson [10] for a more complete description than Griffiths gives.

About the Editors
Marlow Anderson is a professor of mathematics at The Colorado College, in Colorado Springs. He has 
been a member of the mathematics department there since 1982. He was born in Seattle, and received his 
undergraduate degree from Whitman College. He studied partially ordered algebra at the University of Kan­
sas and received his PhD in 1978. He has written over 20 research papers, and co-authored a monograph on 
lattice-ordered groups. He has also co-written an undergraduate textbook on abstract algebra. In addition to 
algebra, he is interested the history of mathematics. When not teaching, reading or researching mathematics, 
he may be found with his wife Audrey scuba-diving in far-flung parts of the world.
Victor J. Katz received his PhD in mathematics from Brandeis University in 1968 and was for many years 
Professor of Mathematics at the University of the District of Columbia. He has long been interested in the 
history of mathematics and, in particular, in its use in teaching. His well-regarded textbook, A History of 
Mathematics: An Introduction, is now in its third edition. Its first edition received the Watson Davis Prize of 
the History of Science Society, a prize awarded annually by the Society for a book in any field of the history 
of science suitable for undergraduates. Professor Katz is also the editor of The Mathematics of Egypt, Meso­
potamia, China, India and Islam: A Sourcebook, which was published in July, 2007 by Princeton University 
Press. Currently, he is the PI on an NSF grant to the MAA supporting Loci: Convergence, the online maga­
zine in the history of mathematics and its use in teaching. k
Robin Wilson is Professor of Pure Mathematics at the Open University (UK), a Fellow in Mathematics at 
Keble College, Oxford University, and Emeritus Gresham Professor of Geometry, London (the oldest math­
ematical Chair in England). He has written and edited about thirty books, mainly on graph theory and the 
history of mathematics. His research interests focus mainly on British mathematics, especially in the 19th and 
early 20th centuries, and on the history of graph theory and combinatorics. He is an enthusiastic popularizer 
of mathematics, having produced books on mathematics and music, mathematical philately, and sudoku, and 
gives about forty public lectures per year. He has an Erdos number of 1 and has won two MAA awards (a 
Lester Ford Award (1975) and a George Polya award (2005).
