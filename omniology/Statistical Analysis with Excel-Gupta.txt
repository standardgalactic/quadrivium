ABOUT THE AUTHOR 
Vijay Gupta has taught statistic, econometrics, and finance to institutions in 
the US and abroad, specializing in teaching technical material to 
professionals. 
He has organized and held training workshops in the Middle East, Africa, 
India, and the US.  The clients include government agencies, financial 
regulatory bodies, non-profit and private sector companies. 
A Georgetown University graduate with a Masters degree in economics, he 
has a vision of making the tools of econometrics and statistics easily 
accessible to professionals and graduate students.  His books on SPSS and 
Regression Analysis have received rave reviews for making statistics and 
SPSS so easy and “non-mathematical.”  The books are in use by over 150,000 
users in more than 140 nations. 
He is a member of the American Statistics Association and the Society for 
Risk Analysis. 
In addition, he has assisted the World Bank and other organizations with 
econometric analysis, survey design, design of international investments, 
cost-benefit, and sensitivity analysis, development of risk management 
strategies, database development, information system design and 
implementation, and training and troubleshooting in several areas. 
Vijay has worked on capital markets, labor policy design, oil research, trade, 
currency markets, and other topics.

Vijay has a vision for software tools for Office Productivity and 
Statistics.  The current book is one of the first tools in stage one of his 
vision.  We now list the stages in his vision. 
Stage one: Books to Teach Existing Software 
He is currently working on books on word-processing, and report 
production using Microsoft Word, and a booklet on Professional 
Presentations. 
The writing of the books is the first stage envisaged by Vijay for 
improving efficiency and productivity across the world.  This directly 
leads to the second stage of his vision for productivity improvement 
in offices worldwide. 
Stage two: Improving on Existing Software 
The next stage is the construction of software that will radically 
improve the usability of current Office software. 
Vijay’s first software is undergoing testing prior to its release in Jan 
2003.  The software — titled “Word Usability Enhancer” — will 
revolutionize the way users interact with Microsoft Word, providing 
users with a more intuitive interface, readily accessible tutorials, and 
numerous timesaving and annoyance-removing macros and utilities. 
He plans to create a similar tool for Microsoft Excel, and, depending 
on resource constraints and demand, for PowerPoint, Star Office, etc. 

 
5 
Stage 3: Construction of the first “feedback-designed” Office and Statistics 
software 
Vijay’s eventual goal is the construction of productivity software 
that will provide stiff competition to Microsoft Office.  His hope is 
that the success of the software tools and the books will convince 
financiers to provide enough capital so that a successful software 
development and marketing endeavor can take a chunk of the multi-
billion dollar Office Suite market. 
Prior to the construction of the Office software, Vijay plans to 
construct the “Definitive” statistics software.  Years of working on 
and teaching the current statistical software has made Vijay a 
master at picking out the weaknesses, limitations, annoyances, and, 
sometimes, pure inaccessibility of existing software.  This 1.5 billion 
dollar market needs a new visionary tool, one that is appealing and 
inviting to users, and not forbidding, as are several of the current 
software.  Mr. Gupta wants to create integrated software that will 
encompass the features of SPSS, STATA, LIMDEP, EViews, 
STATISTICA, MINITAB, etc. 
Other 
He has plans for writing books on the “learning process.”  The books 
will teach how to understand one’s approach to problem solving and 
learning and provide methods for learning new techniques for self-
learning.

The mean/average or expected value of the disturbance 
equals zero 216 
Assumption 5b: 
The disturbance terms all have the same variance 216 
Assumption 5c: 
A disturbance term for one observation should have no 
relation with the disturbance terms for other observations or with any 
of the independent variables 217

 INTRODUCTION 
Are there not enough Excel books in the market?  I have asked myself this 
question and concluded that there are books “inside me,” based on what I 
have realized from observation by friends, students, and colleagues that I 
have a “vision and knack for explaining technical material in plain 
English.” 
Read the book practicing the lessons on the sample files provided in the 
zipped file you downloaded.  I hope the book is useful and assists you in 
increasing your productivity in Excel usage.  You may be pleasantly 
surprised at some of the features shown here.  They will enable you to 
save time. 
The “Make me a Guru” series teach technical material in simple English.  
A lot of thinking went into the sequencing of chapters and sections.  The 
book is broken down into logical “functional” components.  Chapters are 
organized into sections and sub-sections.  This creates a smooth flowing 
structure, enabling “total immersion” learning.  The current book is 
broken down into a multi-level hierarchy: 
—Chapters, each teaching a specific skill/tool. 
— Several sections within each chapter.  Each section shows aspect of 
the skill/tool taught in the chapter.  Each section is numbered—for 
example, “Section 1.2” is the numbering for the second section in 
chapter 1. 
— A few sub-sections (and maybe one further segmentation) within 
each section.  Each sub-section lists a specific function, task, or 
proviso related to the “master” section.  The sub-sections are 
numbered——for example, “1.2.a” for the first sub-section in the 
second section of chapter 1.

Unlike other publishers, I do not consider you dummies or idiots.  Each 
and everyone had the God given potential to achieve mastery in any field.  
All one needs is a guide to show you the way to master a field.  I hope to 
play this role.  I am confident that you will consider your self an Excel 
“Guru” (in terms of the typical use of Excel in your profession) and so will 
others. 
Once you learn the way to master a windows application, this new 
approach will enable you to pick up new skills” on the fly.”  Do not argue 
for your limitations.  You have none. 
I hope you have a great experience in learning with this book.  I would 
love feedback.  Please use the feedback form on our website vjbooks.net.

STATISTICS PROCEDURES 
Three chapters teach statistics functions including the use of Excel 
functions for building Confidence Intervals and conducting Hypothesis 
Testing for several types of distributions.  The design of hypothesis tests 
and the intermediate step of demarcating critical regions are taught 
lucidly. 
It seems that Microsoft has taken pains to “hide” some of the most 
powerful tools in Excel.  These “hidden” tools are called “Add-Ins.”  These 
tools work on top of Excel, extending the power and abilities of Excel.  
Many Add-Ins are available for specific types of analysis like Risk 
Analysis.  I show how to use three Add-Ins that install with Excel.   
BASICS 
The fundamental operations in Excel are taught in Volume 1: Excel For 
Beginners, Volume 2: Charting in Excel, and Volume 3: Excel– Beyond The 
Basics 
FUNCTIONS 
I teach the writing of formulas and associated topics in Volume 3: Excel– 
Beyond The Basics.  I show, in a step-by-step exposition, the proper way 
for writing cell references in a formula.  The book describe tricks for 
copying/cutting and pasting in several examples.  In addition, I discuss 
special pasting options.   
Finally, different types of functions are classified under logical categories 
and discussed within the optimal category.  The categories include 
financial, Statistical, Text, Information, Logical, and “Smart” Logical.

MANAGING & TABULATING DATA 
Excel has extremely powerful data entry, data management, and 
tabulation tools.  The combination of tools provide almost database like 
power to Excel.  Unfortunately, the poor quality of the menu layout and 
the help preclude the possibility of the user self-learning these features.  
These features are taught in Volume 4: Managing & Tabulating Data in 
Excel  
CHARTING 
Please refer to book two in this series.  The book title is Charting in Excel. 
Sample data 
Most of the tutorials use publicly available data from the International 
labor Organization (ILO).  I used a simple data set with only a few 
columns and observations.  All the sample data files are included in the 
zipped file. 
The samples for functions use several small data sets that are more suited 
to illustrating the power and usefulness of the functions. 
I have not included the data set for conducting statistical procedures.  
This is intentional; often, readers fail to internalize the few key concepts 
of hypothesis testing because they do not subject themselves to a “sink-or-
swim” inference-drawing thinking and imbibing process when 
interpreting the results of statistical procedures.

WRITING FORMULAS 
This chapter discusses the following topics: 
— THE BASICS OF WRITING FORMULAE 
— TOOL FOR USING THIS CHAPTER EFFECTIVELY: VIEWING 
THE FORMULA INSTEAD OF THE END RESULT 
— The A1 VS THE R1C1 STYLE OF CELL REFERENCES 
— TYPES OF REFERENCES ALLOWED IN A FORMULA 
— REFERENCING CELLS FROM ANOTHER WORKSHEET 
— REFERENCING A BLOCK OF CELLS 
— REFERENCING NON–ADJACENT CELLS 
— REFERENCING ENTIRE ROWS 
— REFERENCING ENTIRE COLUMNS 
— REFERENCING CORRESPONDING BLOCKS OF 
CELLS/ROWS/COLUMNS FROM A SET OF WORKSHEETS 
The most important functionality offered by a spreadsheet application is 
the ease and flexibility of writing formulae.  In this chapter, I start by 
showing how to write simple formula and then build up the level of 
complexity of the formulae.   
Within the sections of this chapter, you will find tips and notes on 
commonly encountered problems or issues in formula writing.

THE BASICS OF WRITING FORMULAE 
This section teaches the basics of writing functions. 
1.2 
TOOL FOR USING THIS CHAPTER EFFECTIVELY: 
VIEWING THE FORMULA INSTEAD OF THE END 
RESULT 
For ease of understanding this chapter, I suggest you use a viewing option 
that shows, in each cell on a worksheet, the formula instead of the result.  
Follow the menu path TOOLS/OPTIONS/VIEW.  In the area “Window 
Options” select the option “Formulas” as shown in Figure 1.   
Execute the dialog by clicking on the button OK.  Go back to the 
worksheet.  The formula will be shown instead of the calculated value. 
Eventually you will want to return to the default of seeing the results 
instead of the formula.  Deselect “formula” in the area “Windows Options” 
in TOOLS/OPTIONS/VIEW.

The effect is only cosmetic; the results will not change.  As you shall see 
later, what you have just done will facilitate the understanding of 
functions. 
In addition, leave the option VIEW/ FORMULA BAR selected as shown in 
Figure 2.

1.2.A 
THE “A1” VS.  THE “R1C1“ STYLE OF CELL REFERENCES 
The next figure shows a simple formula.  The formula is written into cell 
G15.  The formula multiplies the values inside cells F8 and F6. 
Figure 3:  A!-style cell referencing 
 
This style of referencing is called the “A1“ style or “absolute” referencing.  
The exact location of the referenced cells is written.  (The cells are those 
in the 6th and 8th rows of column F.)  One typically works with this style.   
However, there is another style for referencing the cells in a formula.  
This style is called the “R1C1“ style or “relative” referencing.  The same 
formula as in the previous figure but in R1C1 style is shown in the next 
figure. 
Figure 4:  The same formula as in the previous figure,  but in R1C1 (Offset) style cell 
referencing while the previous figure showed A1 (Absolute-) style cell referencing 
 
Does not this formula look different?  This style uses relative referencing.  
So, the first cell (F8) is referenced relative to its position in reference to 
the cell that contains the formula (cell G15).  Row 8 is 7 rows below row 
15 and column F is 1 column before column G.  Therefore, the cell 
reference is “minus seven rows, minus 1 column” or “R[— 7]C[— 1].” 
If you see a file or worksheet with such relative referencing, you can 
switch all the formulas back to absolute “A1” style referencing by going to 
TOOLS/OPTIONS/GENERAL and deselecting the option “R1C1 reference 
style.”

WRITING A SIMPLE FORMULA THAT REFERENCES CELLS 
Open the sample file “File3.xls” and choose the worksheet “main.”  
Assume you want to write add the values in cells C2231 and D223 (that is, 
to calculate “C223 + D223”) and place the result into cell F223. 
Click on cell F223.  Key-in “=“and then write the formula by clicking on 
the cell C223, typing in “+” then clicking on cell “D223.”   
Figure 6:  Writing a formula 
 
After writing in the formula, press the key ENTER.  The cell F223 will 
contain the result for the formula contained in it.   
Figure 7:  The result is shown in the cell on which you wrote the formula

TYPES OF REFERENCES ALLOWED IN A FORMULA 
1.3.A 
REFERENCING CELLS FROM ANOTHER WORKSHEET 
You can reference cells from another worksheet.  Choose cell H235 on the 
worksheet “main.”  In the chosen cell, type the text shown in the next 
figure.  (Do not press the ENTER key; the formula is incomplete and you 
will get an error message if you press ENTER.) 
Figure 8:  Writing or choosing the reference to the first referenced range 
 
Then select the worksheet “second” and click on cell D235.  Now press the 
ENTER key.  The formula in cell H235 of worksheet “main” references the 
cell D235 from the worksheet “second”.  The next figure illustrates this. 
Figure 9:  Writing or choosing the reference to the second referenced range which is not on the 
worksheet on which you are writing the formula 
 
In this formula, the part “second!” informs Excel that the range referenced 
is from the sheet “second. 
1.3.B 
REFERENCING A BLOCK OF CELLS 
Select the worksheet “main.”  Choose cell H236.  In the chosen cell, type 
the text shown in the next figure. 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
30 
Figure 10:  This formula requires a block of cells as a reference 
 
Use the mouse to highlight the block of cells “E223 to E235.”  Type in a 
closing parenthesis and press the ENTER key.  The resulting function is 
shown in the next figure.

REFERENCING NON–ADJACENT CELLS 
Choose cell H237.  Click in the cell and type the text shown in the next 
figure.   
Figure 12:  The core function is typed first 
 
As in the previous example, choose cells E223 to E235 by highlighting 
them— the formula should like the one shown in the next figure.   
Figure 13:  The first block of cells is referenced 
 
Type a comma.  The resulting formula should look like that shown in the 
next figure.

1.3.D 
REFERENCING ENTIRE ROWS 
Choose cell H238.  In this cell, type the text shown in the next figure.   
Using the mouse, highlight the rows 197 to 209.  Type in a closing 
parenthesis and press the ENTER key.  The resulting formula is shown in 
the next figure. 
Figure 16:  Referencing entire rows 
 
1.3.E 
REFERENCING ENTIRE COLUMNS 
Choose cell H239.  In this cell, type the text shown in the next figure.  
Using the mouse, highlight the columns C and D.  Key-in a closing 
parenthesis and press the ENTER key.

1.3.F 
REFERENCING CORRESPONDING BLOCKS OF 
CELLS/ROWS/COLUMNS FROM A SET OF WORKSHEETS 
Assume you have a workbook with six worksheets on similar data from 
six clients.  You want to sum cells “C4 to F56” across all six worksheets.   
One way to do this would be to create a formula in each worksheet to sum 
for that worksheet’s data and then a formula to add the results of the 
other six formulae.   
Another way is using “3–D references.”  The row and column make the 
first two dimensions; the worksheet set is the third dimension.  You can 
use only one formula that references all six worksheets that the relevant 
cells within them. 
While typing the formula, 
• Type the “=“sign, 
• Write the formula (for example, “Sum”), 
• Place an opening parenthesis “(,” then 
• Select the six worksheets by clicking at the name tab of the first one 
and then pressing down SHIFT and clicking on the name tab of the 
sixth worksheet, and then 
• Highlight the relevant cell range on any one of them, 
• Type in the closing parenthesis “)” 
• And press the ENTER key to get the formula 
=SUM(Sheet1:Sheet6!”C4:F56”)

SIMULTANEOUSLY 
2.1 
COPYING AND PASTING A FORMULA TO OTHER 
CELLS IN THE SAME COLUMN 
Often one wants to write analogous formulae for several cases.  For 
example, assume you want to write a formula analogous to the formula in 
F223 into each of the cells F224 to F2352.  The quick way to do this is to: 
— Click on the “copied from” cell F223. 
— Select the option EDIT/COPY.  (The menu can also be accessed by 
right-clicking on the mouse or by clicking on the COPY icon.) 
— Highlight the “pasted on” cells F224 to F235 and 
— Choose the menu option EDIT/PASTE.  (The menu can also be 
accessed by right-clicking on the mouse or by clicking on the 
PASTE icon.) 
— Press the ENTER key. 
— The formula is pasted onto the cells F224 to F235 and the cell 
                                         
2 The formula in F223 adds the values in cells that are 3 and 2 columns to the left (that 
is, cells in columns in C and D.) 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
36 
references within each formula are adjusted3 for the location 
difference between the “pasted on” cells and the “copied from” cell. 
Figure 18:  Pasting a formula 
 
2.2 
COPYING AND PASTING A FORMULA TO OTHER 
CELLS IN THE SAME ROW 
Select the range F223— F235 (which you just created in the previous sub–
section).  Select the option EDIT/COPY.  Choose the range G223— G235 
(that is, one column to the right) and choose the menu option 
EDIT/PASTE.  Now click on any cell in the range G223— G235 and see 
how the column reference has adjusted automatically.  The formula in 
                                         
3 The formula in the “copied cell” F223 is “C223 + D223” while the formula in the 
“pasted on” cell F225 is “C225 + D225.”  (Click on cell F225 to confirm this.)  The cell 
F225 is two rows below the cell F223, and the copying-and-pasting process accounts 
for that. 

Chapter 2: Copying/Cutting and pasting formulae 
37 
G223 is “D223 + E223” while the formula in F223 was “C223 + D223”.   
The next figure illustrates this.  Because you pasted one column to the 
right, the cell references automatically shifted one column to the right.  
So: 
— The reference “C” became “D,” and 
— The reference “D” became “E.” 
Figure 19:  Cell reference changes when a formula is copied and pasted 
 
The examples in 2.1 on page 36 and 2.2 on page 37 show the use of “Copy 
and Paste” to quickly replicate formula in a manner that maintains 
referential parallelism. 
2.3 
COPYING AND PASTING A FORMULA TO OTHER 
CELLS IN A DIFFERENT ROW AND COLUMN 
Select the cell F223.  Select the option EDIT/COPY.  Choose the range 
H224 (that is, two columns to the right and one row down from the copied 
cell) and choose the menu option EDIT/PASTE.  Observe how the column 
and row references have changed automatically— the formula in H224 is 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
38 
“E224 + F224” while the formula in F223 was “C223 + D223”.   
The next figure illustrates this.  Because you pasted two columns to the 
right and one row down, the cell references automatically shifted two 
columns to the right and one row down.  So: 
— The reference “C” became “E” (that is, two columns to the right) 
— The reference “D” became “F” (that is, two columns to the right) 
— The references “223” became “224” (that is, one row down) 
Figure 20:  Copying and pasting a formula 
 
2.4 
CONTROLLING CELL REFERENCE BEHAVIOR 
WHEN COPYING AND PASTING FORMULAE (USE 
OF THE “$” KEY) 
The use of the dollar key “$” (typed by holding down SHIFT and choosing 
the key “4”) allows you to have control over the change of cell references in 
the “Copy and Paste” process.  The use of this feature is best shown with 
some examples. 
— The steps in copy and pasting a formula from one range to another: 
— Click on the “copied from” cell F223. 
— Select the option EDIT/COPY.  (The menu can also be accessed by 
right-clicking on the mouse or by clicking on the COPY icon.) 

Chapter 2: Copying/Cutting and pasting formulae 
39 
— Choose the “pasted on” cell F219 by clicking on it, and 
— Select the menu option EDIT/PASTE.  (The menu can also be 
accessed by right-clicking on the mouse or by clicking on the 
PASTE icon.) 
— Press the ENTER key. 
— The formula “C219 + D219” will be pasted onto cell F219.  (For a 
pictorial reproduction of this, see Figure 21.) 
Figure 21:  The “pasted-on” cell 
 
Change the formula by typing the dollar signs as shown Figure 22. 
Figure 22:  Inserting dollar signs in order to influence cell referencing 
 
Copy cell F219.  Paste into G220 (that is, one column to the right and one 
row down).  The dollar signs will ensure that the cell reference is not 
adjusted for the row or column differential for the parts of the formula 
that have the dollar sign before them4— see the formula in cell F220 
(reproduced in Figure 23).   
                                         
4 In this example, the parts are the “C” reference and “219” reference in “$C$219” part of 
the formula.

COPYING AND PASTING FORMULAS FROM ONE 
WORKSHEET TO ANOTHER 
The worksheet “second” in the sample data file has the same data as the 
worksheet you are currently on (“main.”)  In the worksheet main, select 
the cell F219 and choose the menu option EDIT/COPY.  Select the 
worksheet “second” and paste the formula into cell F219.  Notice that the 
formula is duplicated.

2.7 
PASTING SEVERAL FORMULAS TO A SYMMETRIC 
BUT LARGER RANGE 
Assume you have different formulas in cells G2, H2, and I2.  You want to 
paste the formula: 
— In G2 to G3:G289 
— In H2 to H3:H289 
— In I2 to I3:I289 
Select the range G2:I2.  Pick the menu option EDIT/COPY.  Highlight the 
range G3:I289.  (Shortcut: select G3.  Scroll down to I289 without 
touching the sheet.  Depress the SHIFT key and click on cell I289.)  Pick 
the menu option EDIT/PASTE. 
2.8 
DEFINING AND REFERENCING A “NAMED RANGE” 
You can use range names as references instead of exact cell references.  
Named ranges are easier to use if the names chosen are explanatory. 
First, you have to define named ranges.  This process involves informing 
Excel that the name, for example, “age_nlf,” refers to the range “C2:C19.”  

Chapter 2: Copying/Cutting and pasting formulae 
43 
Pick the menu option “INSERT/NAME/DEFINE.”  The dialog (user-input 
form) that opens is shown in the next figure.  Type the name of the range 
into the text-box “Names in workbook” and the “Cell References” in the 
box “Refers to:” See the next figure for an example. 
Figure 27:  The DEFINE NAMES dialog 
 
Click on the button “Add.”  The named range is defined.  The name of a 
defined range is displayed in the large text-box in the dialog.  The next 
figure illustrates this text. 
Figure 28:  Once added, the defined named range’s name can be seen in the large text-box 
 
Several named ranges can be defined.  A named range can represent 
multiple blocks of cells.

If the first/last row/column in your ranges has the labels for the range, 
then you can define names for all the ranges using the menu option 
INSERT/NAMES/CREATE.  The dialog is reproduced in the next figure. 
Figure 32:  CREATE NAMES 
 
In our sample data set, I selected columns “A” and “B” and created the 
names from the labels in the first row. 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
46 
Figure 33:  The named ranges “Country_Name,” and “Series_Name” were defined in one step 
using “Create Names” 
 
Using a named range 
Named ranges are typically used to make formulas easier to read.  The 
named ranges could also be used in other procedures 
Assume you want to sum several of the ranges defined above.  One way to 
sum them would be to select them one-by-one from the worksheet. 
 
Another way is to use the menu option INSERT/NAME/PASTE to select 
and paste the names of the ranges.  The names are explanatory and 
reduce the chances of errors in cell referencing. 
A reference to the named range is pasted onto the formula as shown 
below.

CUTTING AND PASTING FORMULAE 
2.11.A 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “COPYING AND PASTING” 
FORMULAS AND “CUTTING AND PASTING” FORMULAS 
Click on cell F223, select the option EDIT/CUT, click on cell H224 and 
choose the menu option EDIT/PASTE.  The formula in the “pasted on” cell 
is the same as was in the “cut from” cell.  (The formula “=C223 + D223.”)  
Therefore, there is no change in the cell references after cutting–and–
pasting.  While copy–and–paste automatically adjusts for cell reference 
differentials, cut–and–paste does not. 
If you had used copy and paste, the formula in H224 would be “=D224 + 
E224.” 
Figure 35:  Cut from cell F223 
 
Figure 36:  Paste into cell H223.  Note that the cell references do not adjust. 
 
After doing this, select the option EDIT/UNDO because I want to 
maintain the formulas in F223— F235 (and not because it is required for 
a cut and paste operation).

operation on cells!

3.1 
PASTING THE RESULT OF A FORMULA, BUT NOT 
THE FORMULA 
Sometimes one wants the ability to copy a formula (for example, “=C223 + 
D223)”) but paste only the resulting value.  (The example that follows will 
make this clear.) 
Select the range “F223:F235” on worksheet ““main.” 
Choose the menu option FILE/NEW and open a new file.  Go to any cell in 
this new file and choose the menu option EDIT/PASTE SPECIAL. 
In the area “Paste,” choose the option “Values” as shown in Figure 37.

OTHER SELECTIVE PASTING OPTIONS 
3.2.A 
PASTING ONLY THE FORMULA (BUT NOT THE FORMATTING 
AND COMMENTS) 
Choose the option “Formulas” in the area “Paste” of the dialog (user-input 
form) associated with the menu “EDIT/PASTE SPECIAL.”  This feature 
makes the pasted values free from all cell references.  The “pasted on” 
range will only contain pure numbers.  The biggest advantage of this 
option is that it enables the collating of formula results in different 
ranges/sheets/workbooks onto one worksheet without the bother of 
maintaining all the referenced cells in the same workbook/sheet as the 
collated results. 
Figure 40:  Pasting formulas only 
 
3.2.B 
PASTING ONLY FORMATS 
Choose the option “Formats” in the area “Paste” of the dialog associated 
with the menu “EDIT/PASTE SPECIAL use the “Format Painter” icon.  I 
prefer using the icon.   
Refer to Volume 1: Excel For Beginners for a discussion on the format

3.2.C 
PASTING DATA VALIDATION SCHEMES 
Pick the option “Validation” in the area “Paste” of the dialog associated 
with the menu “EDIT/PASTE SPECIAL.”  Data validation schemes are 
discussed in Volume 4: Managing & Tabulating Data in Excel.  This 
option can be very useful in standardizing data entry standards and rules 
across an institution. 
3.2.D 
PASTING ALL BUT THE BORDERS 
Choose the option “All except borders” in the area “Paste” of the dialog 
associated with the menu “EDIT/PASTE SPECIAL.”  All other formatting 
features, formulae, and data are pasted.  This option is rarely used. 
3.2.E 
PASTING COMMENTS ONLY 
Pick the option “Comments” in the area “Paste” of the dialog associated 
with the menu “EDIT/PASTE SPECIAL.”  Only the comments are pasted.  
The comments are pasted onto the equivalently located cell.  For example, 
a comment on the cell that is in the third row and second column that is 
copied will be pasted onto the cell that is in the third row and second 
column of the “pasted on” range.  This option is rarely used.

PERFORMING AN ALGEBRAIC “OPERATION” WHEN 
PASTING ONE COLUMN/ROW/RANGE ON TO 
ANOTHER 
3.3.A 
MULTIPLYING/DIVIDING/SUBTRACTING/ADDING ALL CELLS 
IN A RANGE BY A NUMBER 
Assume your data is expressed in millions.  You need to change the units 
to billions— that is, divide all values in the range by 1000.  The complex 
way to do this would be to create a new range with each cell in the new 
range containing the formula “cell in old range/1000.”  A much simpler 
way is to use PASTE SPECIAL.  On any cell in the worksheet, write the 
number 1000.  Click on that cell and copy the number.  Choose the range 
whose cells need a rescaling of units.  Go to the menu option EDIT/PASTE 
SPECIAL and choose “Divide” in the area Options.  The range will be 
replaced with a number obtained by dividing each cell by the copied cells 
value! 
The same method can be used to multiply, subtract or add a number to all 
cells in a range 
Figure 41: You can multiply (or add/subtract/divide) all cells in the “pasted on” range by 
(to/by/from) the value of the copied cell 
 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
58 
3.3.B 
MULTIPLYING/DIVIDING THE CELL VALUES IN CELLS IN 
SEVERAL “PASTED ON” COLUMNS WITH THE VALUES OF THE 
COPIED RANGE 
You can use the same method to add/subtract/multiply/divide one 
column’s (or row’s) values to the corresponding cells in one or several 
“pasted on” columns (or rows). 
 Copy the cells in column E and paste special onto the 
cells in columns C and D choosing the option “Add” in the area 
“Operation” of the paste special dialog.  (You can use EDIT/UNDO to 
restore the file to its old state.) 
3.4 
SWITCHING ROWS TO COLUMNS 
Choose any option in the “Paste” and “Operations” areas and choose the 
option “Transpose.”  If pasting a range with many columns and rows you 
may prefer to paste onto one cell to avoid getting the error “Copy and 
Paste areas are in different shapes.”

INSERTING FUNCTIONS 
This chapter teaches the following topics: 
— A SIMPLE FUNCTION 
— FUNCTIONS THAT NEED MULTIPLE RANGE REFERENCES 
— WRITING A “FUNCTION WITHIN A FUNCTION“ 
— NEW IN EXCEL XP 
— RECOMMENDED FUNCTIONS IN THE FUNCTION WIZARD 
— EXPANDED AUTOSUM FUNCTIONALITY 
— FORMULA EVALUATOR 
— FORMULA ERROR CHECKING 
4.1 
BASICS 
Excel has many in–built functions.  The functions may be inserted into a 
formula. 
Accessing the functions dialog/wizard 
(a) select the menu path INSERT/FUNCTION, or 
(b) click on the function icon (see Figure 42) 
 

Chapter 4: Inserting functions 
61 
Figure 42:  The Function icon 
 
The “Paste Function” dialog (or wizard, because it is a series of dialogs) 
opens.  The dialog is shown in Figure 43. 
Figure 43:  Understanding the PASTE FUNCTION dialog 
 
The equivalent dialog in the XP version of Excel is called INSERT 
FUNCTION.  (It is reproduced in the next figure below.)  The dialog has 
one new feature—a “Search for a function” utility.  The “Function 
category” is now available by clicking on the list box next to the label “Or 
select a category.”

Figure 44:  The equivalent dialog in the XP version of Excel is called INSERT FUNCTION 
 
This dialog has three parts: 
(1) The area “Function category” on the left half shows the labels of 
each group of functions.  The group “Statistical” contains 
statistical functions like “Average” and “Variance.”  The group 
“Math & Trig” contains algebra and trigonometry functions like 
“Cosine.”  When you click on a category name, all the functions 
within the group are listed in the area “Function name.” 
(2) The area “Function name” lists all the functions within the 
category selected in the area “Function category.”  When you 
click on the name of a function, its formula, and description is 
shown in the gray area at the bottom of the dialog.

that contains the function, then click on the function name in the area 
“Function name” (in area 2 or the left half of the dialog) and then execute 
the dialog by clicking on the button OK. 
4.2 
A SIMPLE FUNCTION 
In my first example, I show how to select and use the function “Average” 
which is under the category “Statistical.” 
Choose the category “Statistical” as shown in Figure 45. 
Figure 45:  Choosing a function category 
 
Choose the formula “Average” in the area “Function name.” 
This is shown in Figure 46. 
Execute the dialog by clicking on the button OK. 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
64 
Figure 46:  Choosing a function name 
 
The dialog (user-input form) for the “Average” function opens. 
For a pictorial reproduction of this, see Figure 47.

Step 3 for inserting a function — defining the data 
arguments/requirements for the function 
Figure 48:  Selecting the cell references whose values will be the inputs into the function 
 

Chapter 4: Inserting functions 
65 
You have to tell Excel which cells contain the data to which you want to 
apply the function “AVERAGE.”  Click on the right edge of the text-box 
“Number1”6.  (That is, on the red–blue–and–white corner of the cell.)  Go 
to the worksheet that has the data you want to use and highlight the 
range “C2 to E3.”  Click on the edge of the text-box.  (For a pictorial 
reproduction of this, see Figure 48.) 
You will be taken back to the “Average” dialog.  Notice that — as shown in 
Figure 49 — the cell reference “C2:E3” has been added. 
Furthermore, note that the answer is provided at the bottom (see the line 
“Formula result = 9973333.333”). 
Execute the dialog by clicking on the button OK. 
Figure 49:  The completed function dialog 
 
                                         
6 If you want to use non-adjacent ranges in the formula, then use the text-box “Number 
2” for the second range.  Excel will add more text-boxes once you fill all the available 
ones.  If the label for a text-box is not in bold then it is not essential to fill that text-
box.  In the AVERAGE dialog shown in Figure 402, the label for the first text-box 
(“Number 1”) is in bold—so it has to be filled.  The label for the second text-box 
(“Number 2”) is not in bold — so, it can be left empty. 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
66 
The formula is written into the cell and is shown in Figure 50. 
Figure 50:  The function is written into the cell 
 
Press the ENTER key and the formula will be calculated. 
You can work with this formula in a similar manner as a simple formula 
— copying and pasting, cutting and pasting, writing on multiple 
worksheets, etc. 
If you remember the function name, you do not have to use 
INSERT/FUNCTION.  Instead, you can simple type in the formulas using 
the keyboard.  This method is faster but requires that you know the 
function. 
4.3 
FUNCTIONS THAT NEED MULTIPLE RANGE 
REFERENCES 
Some formulas need a multiple range reference.  One example is the 
correlation formula (“CORREL“).  Assume, in cell J1, you want to 
calculate the correlation between the data in the two ranges: “D2 to D14” 
and “E2 to E14.” 
Activate cell J1.  Select the option INSERT/FUNCTION.  Choose the 
function category “Statistical.”  In the list of functions that opens in the 
right half of the dialog, choose the function “CORREL“ and execute the 
dialog by clicking on the button OK. 

Chapter 4: Inserting functions 
67 
Figure 51:  Choosing the function CORREL 
 
The CORREL dialog (shown in the next figure) opens.  The function needs 
two arrays (or series) of cells references.  (Because the labels to both the 
text-box labels are bold, both text-boxes have to be filled for the function 
to be completely defined.)  Therefore, the pointing to the cell references 
has to be done twice as shown in Figure 53 and the next two figures. 
 
Figure 52:  The CORREL dialog 
 
Choosing the first array/series 
Click on the box edge of “Array1” (as shown in Figure 52.)  Then go to the 
relevant data range (D2 to D14 in this example) and select it. 
 
Figure 53:  Selecting the first data input for the function 
 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
68 
Repeat the same for “Array 2,” selecting the range “E2:E14” this time. 
Figure 54:  The first data input has been referenced 
 
The formula is complete.  The result is shown in the dialog in the area at 
the bottom “Formula result.”  Execute the dialog by clicking on the button 
OK. 
Figure 55:  The second data input has also been referenced 
 
Once the dialog closes, depress the ENTER key, and the function will be 
written into the cell and its result evaluated/calculated. 
Figure 56:  The function as written into the cell. 
 
4.4 
WRITING A “FUNCTION WITHIN A FUNCTION” 
I use the example of the CONFIDENCE function from the category 
“Statistical.” 
Choose the menu option INSERT/FUNCTION. 

Chapter 4: Inserting functions 
69 
Choose the function category “Statistical.” 
In the list of functions that opens in the right half of the dialog, choose the 
function CONFIDENCE and execute the dialog by clicking on the button 
OK. 
Figure 57:  Selecting the CONFIDENCE function 
 
The Confidence dialog (user-input form) requires7 three parameters: the 
alpha, standard deviation, and sample size.  First type in the alpha 
desired as shown in Figure 58.  (An alpha of “.05” corresponds to a 95% 
confidence level while an alpha value of “:.1” corresponds to a confidence 
interval of 90 %.) 
Figure 58:  Dialog for CONFIDENCE 
 
                                         
7 We know that all three are necessary because their labels are in bold. 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
70 
Press the OK button. 
Figure 59:  The first part of the function 
 
Type a comma after the “.05” (see Figure 60) and then go to 
INSERT/FUNCTION and choose the formula STDEV as shown in Figure 
61. 
Figure 60:  Placing a comma before entering the second part 
 
Choose the range for which you want to calculate the STDEV (for 
example, the range “E:E”) and execute the dialog by clicking on the button 
OK. 
Figure 61:  Using STDEV function for the second part of the function 
 
The formula now becomes: 
Figure 62:  A function within a function 
 
The main formula is still CONFIDENCE.  The formula STDEV provides 
one of the parameters for this main formula.  The STDEV function is 
nested within the CONFIDENCE function. 

Chapter 4: Inserting functions 
71 
Type a comma, and then go to INSERT/FUNCTION and choose the 
function “Count” from the function category “Statistical” to get the final 
formula. 
Figure 63:  The completed formula 
 
There are two other ways to write this formula. 
Select the option INSERT/FUNCTION, choose the function 
CONFIDENCE from the category “Statistical” and type in the formulae 
“STDEV(E:E)” and “COUNT(E:E)” as shown in Figure 64. 
This method is much faster but requires that you know the function 
names STDEV and COUNT. 
Figure 64:  If sub-functions are required in the formula of a function, the sub-functions may be 
typed into the relevant text-box of the function’s dialog 
 
The third way to write the formula is to type it in.  This is the fastest 
method.

NEW FUNCTION-RELATED FEATURES IN THE XP 
VERSION OF EXCEL 
Searching for a function 
Type a question (like “estimate maximum value”) into the box “Search for 
a function” utility and click on the button “Go.”  Excel will display a list of 
functions related to your query.

4.5.A 
ENHANCED FORMULA BAR 
After you enter a number or cell reference for the first function 
“argument” (or first “requirement”) and type in a comma, Excel 
automatically converts to bold format the next argument/requirement.  In 
the example shown in the next figure, Excel makes bold the font for the 
argument placeholder pmt after you have entered a value for nper and a 
comma. 
Figure 67:  The Formula Bar Assistant is visible below the Formula Bar 
 
Similarly, the argument/requirement after pmt has a bold font after you 
have entered a value or reference for the argument pmt 

Chapter 4: Inserting functions

— WATCH WINDOW 
— ERROR CHECKING 
— FORMULA EVALUATION 
5.1 
TRACING THE CELL REFERENCES USED IN A 
FORMULA 
Click on the cell that contains the formula whose references need to be 
visually traced.  Pick the menu option TOOLS/AUDITING/TRACE 
PRECEDENTS.  (For a pictorial reproduction of this, see Figure 70.) 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
76 
Figure 70:  Tracing precedents.  These options are from Excel versions prior to Excel XP. 
 
Figure 71:  Excel XP offers several error-checking and debugging tools. 
 
As shown in Figure 72, blue arrows will trace the references. 
If a group of cells is referenced, then the group will be marked by a blue 
rectangle.  The two rectangular areas are referenced in the formula.  
In Volume 3: Excel- Beyond The Basics, you are taught the simple process 
through which you can select all the cells whose formulas are precedents 
of the active cell. 

Chapter 5: Tracing Cell References & Debugging Formula Errors

5.2 
TRACING THE FORMULAS IN WHICH A 
PARTICULAR CELL IS REFERENCED 
You may want to do the opposite— see which formulas reference a 
particular cell. 
• 
First, click on the cell of interest. 
• 
Then, pick the menu option TOOLS/AUDITING/TRACE 
DEPENDENTS as shown in Figure 73.  Now the arrows will go 
from the active cell to all the cells that have formulas that use 
the active cell.

Remove all the auditing arrows by following the menu path 
TOOLS/AUDITING/REMOVE ALL ARROWS.  
In Volume 3: Excel- Beyond The Basics you learn the simple process 
through which you can select all the cells whose formulas are dependents 
of the active cell. 
5.3 
THE AUDITING TOOLBAR 
The “Auditing” toolbar opens automatically when you are using the 
auditing option (TOOLS/AUDITING) to review formula references.   
Refer to Volume 3: Excel- Beyond The Basics for details on using toolbars.   
In the XP version of Excel, you can launch the toolbar through the menu 
option TOOLS/AUDITING/SHOW FORMULA AUDITING TOOLBAR.

5.4 
WATCH WINDOW (ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE XP 
VERSION OF EXCEL) 
The window is accessed through the menu path TOOLS/ AUDITING/ 
SHOW WATCH WINDOW, or VIEW/ TOOLBARS/ WATCH WINDOW. 
Figure 75:  The Watch Window may not display correctly.  Use the mouse to drag the walls of 
the dialog to a workable size. 
 
Add one cell on whose values you want to keep tabs. 
The value will be shown in the Watch Window so that you can see the 
value even if you are working on cells or sheets that are far from the cell 
whose value is being “watched.”   
Figure 76:  Add Watch 
 
You can add many cells to the Watch Window.  Note that the Watch 
Window provides precise information on the location of the cell being 
watched and the formula in the cell.  For example, the first watched cell is 
on cell D8 in sheet “Date to serial” in the file “Date and Time.xls.”  The 
formula in the cell is “=DATE(F7, E7, D7)”.

Figure 77:  You can add many cells to the Watch Window 
 
5.5 
ERROR CHECKING AND FORMULA EVALUATOR 
(ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE XP VERSION OF EXCEL) 
The tools are accessed through TOOLS/ERROR CHECKING and 
TOOLS/FORMULA AUDITING/EVALUATE FORMULA. 
The Error Checking dialog shows the formula in the cell as well as the 
type of error.  In this example, these are “=DEGREE(COS(C6))” and 
“Invalid Name Error,” respectively. 
The button (“Help on this error”) links to a help file containing assistance 
on understanding and debugging the error. 
The button “Show Calculation Steps” links to a step-by-step debugger that 
assists in catching the calculation step at which the error occurred. 
This debugger has the same functionality as the Formula Auditor 
(accessed through TOOLS/FORMULA AUDITING/EVALUATE 
FORMULA).   

Chapter 5: Tracing Cell References & Debugging Formula Errors 
81 
Figure 78:  The Error Checking dialog shows the formula in the cell as well as the type of error 
 
The button “Ignore Error” keeps the error “as is.”  The button Options 
opens the dialog for setting error-checking options.  The choices within the 
dialog are listed in section 5.8. 
The Formula Evaluator shows the step at which the first calculation error 
occurred.  This helps in identifying the primary problem. In this example, 
no error has occurred in the formula part “COS(C6))”.  The dialog informs 
you that “The next evaluation (that is, calculation step), will result in an 
error.” 
Figure 79:  The Formula Evaluator shows the step at which the first calculation error occurred 
 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
82 
After clicking on evaluate, you see that the error is in the formula part 
“DEGREE.”  Excel also informs you of the type of error— “#NAME?” 
suggests that “DEGREE” does not match the name of any Excel function.  
(The correct function is “DEGREES.”) 
The “COS“ function is nested within the DEGREE function.  Clicking on 
“Step In” will evaluate the nested function only. 
Figure 80:  After clicking on evaluate...

each function. 
6.1 
“AVERAGED” MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY 
These set of functions perform some type of averaging to measure a 
“mean” value.  You may want to use the Trimmed Mean function to 
estimate an average that excludes the extreme values of the data series.  
The Harmonic Mean estimates the averages of the reciprocals of the 
numbers in the series.  The Geometric Mean is used to average rates of 
change. 
Samples will be available at http://www.vjbooks.net/excel/samples.htm. 
6.1.A 
AVERAGE  
The function calculates the simple arithmetic average of all cells in the 
chosen range. 
Menu path to function: Go to the menu option INSERT/FUNCTION and 
choose the formula “AVERAGE the function category STATISTICAL.

Data requirements: The X values can be input as references to one or more 
ranges that may be non–adjacent.  The second range can be referenced in 
the first text-box “Number1” after placing a comma after the first range, 
or it could be referenced in the second text-box “Number2.”  If you use the 
second text-box, then a third text-box “Number3” will automatically open.  
(As you fill the last visible box, another box opens until the maximum 
number of boxes — 30 — is reached.) 
The function does not count invalid cell values when counting the number 
of X values.  The X values can take any real number value. 
6.1.B 
TRIMMEAN (“TRIMMED MEAN”) 
This function is a variation of the average or mean.  This function 
calculates the average for a set of X values after removing “extreme 
values” from the set.  The excluded cells are chosen by the user based on 
the extremity (from mean/median) of the values in the range.  
TRIMMEAN calculates the mean taken by excluding a percentage of data 
points from the top and bottom tails of a data set.  The user decides on the 
percentage of extreme values to drop.  For symmetry, TRIMMEAN 
excludes a set of values from the top and bottom of the data set before 
moving on to the next exclusion. 
Menu path to function: INSERT/FUNCTION/STATISTICAL/TRIMMEAN. 
Data requirements: The X values can be input as references to one or more 
ranges that may be non–adjacent.  The function does not count invalid cell 
values when counting the number of X values.  The X values can take any 
real number value.

In the dialog (shown above), Percent is the fractional number of data 
points to exclude from the calculation.  Percent must be greater than zero 
and less than one. 
6.1.C 
HARMEAN  (“HARMONIC MEAN”) 
The function calculates the harmonic mean of all cells in the chosen 
range(s).  The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of 
reciprocals.  In the formula below, H is the harmonic mean, n the 
sample/range size and the Y’s are individual data values.

LOCATION MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY 
(MODE, MEDIAN) 
The Median and — less often — the Mode are also used for estimating the 
central tendency of a series.  The Median is much better in situations 
where, either: 
(a) A few extreme highs or lows are influencing the Mean (note that 
the TRIMMEAN or Trimmed Mean function shown in the 
previous section can reduce the chance of extreme values over-
influencing a Mean estimate), or 
(b) The central tendency is required to obtain the mid-point of 
observed values of the data series as in the “Median Voter” 
models, which are used to know if the “Median Voter” threshold is 
crossed in support of a point on the nominee’s agenda.  (In a two-
person face-off, any more than the Median vote will result in a 
greater than 50% majority).

SKEWNESS 
Skewness measures asymmetry around the mean.  The parameter is best 
interpreted as relative to the Normal Density Function (whose Skewness 
equals zero).  The interpretation of the Skewness for a series (relative to 
the Normal Density Function) is: 
— Skewness > 0 Æ asymmetric tail with more values above the mean. 
— Skewness < 0 Æ asymmetric tail with more values below the mean.

KURTOSIS

The next figure shows three Density Functions.  The Density Functions 
lie around the same Mean and Median, but note the difference in the 
relative flatness of the Density Functions: 
Distribution of series X1 is the flattest with a Kurtosis < 0, that of X2 is 
less flat with a Kurtosis = 0 (a Normal Density Function) and that of 
series X3 is the least flat with a Kurtosis > 0.

7.1.A 
PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION (PDF) 
Figure 101:  Probability Density Function (PDF) 
 
The horizontal axis contains the values of the series/series.  The vertical 
height of the curve at a point on the X–axis shows the probability 
associated (or frequency) with that point.  (The total area under the curve 
equals 1; so, all the “heights” add up to 1 or 100 %.)  The higher the 
frequency with which that point is observed in a series/series, the higher 
is its frequency. 
An often–used probability Density Function — the “Normal” probability 
Density Function — is shown in the previous figure.  This Density 
Function has some convenient properties: 
 — its Mean, Mode and Median are the same  
— it does not have a left or right skew, and 
— the left half is a mirror image of the right half. 
All these “symmetrical” properties allow one to draw inferences from tests 
run on series that are distributed “Normally.”   

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
110 
Based on several theorems, postulate, “most data series start behaving 
more and more like a series that follows a Normal Density Function as 
the sample size (or number of data points) increases.”  (This presumption 
follows from the “Central Limit Theorem.”)  This has made the Normal 
Density Function the bedrock of most statistics and econometrics. 
7.1.B 
CUMULATIVE DENSITY FUNCTION (CDF) 
We are typically interested in measuring the area under the curve (a) to 
the left of an X value (b) to the right of an X value, or (c) between two X 
values.  The height of the curve at any X value is not so useful by itself 
because it does not answer any of these questions directly.   
A better graphical tool to measure the “area under the curve” is the 
Cumulative Density Function (CDF).  A CDF plots the X categories 
against the “probability of a value taking a value below the chosen X 
value.” 
The CDF for the Normal Density Function is reproduced in the next 
figure.  The curve increases from left to right (from 0 to 18).  The height at 
any X-value tells us “the probability of a value having a value below this 
X-value equals the Y-axis value of the CDF at this X.” 
                                         
8 The area under any Density Function curve always equals 1.  The relative 
frequency equals (frequency that X takes on this particular value) divided by (the 
total sample size).  Therefore, in a sense, the height gives the frequency weight for 
each X value.  If you sum all the relative frequencies, their sum is “sample size 
divided by sample size” equals 1.  This is the area under the curve.  It can also be 
expressed in percentage terms; the total percentage area then becomes 100%. 

Chapter 7: Probabiity Density Functions & Confidence Intervals 
111 
Figure 102:  The “Cumulative Density Function” (CDF) associated with the Probability 
Density Function (PDF) shown in the previous figure 
 
The CDF is a better tool for answering the typical questions about the 
properties of a data series.  CDF is of great importance for building 
Confidence Intervals and implementing hypothesis tests.   
In fact, for some Density Functions, Excel only measures the CDF only 
(and not the CDF & PDF). 
The CDF and Confidence Intervals 
The concept of a Confidence Interval for a measured parameter (typically 
for a mean) is based on the concept of probability depicted by a Density 
Function curve.  A Confidence Interval of 95% is a range of X values 
within whose range the sum of the relative frequencies is 0.95 or 95%.   
I will use this property to show how to create Confidence Intervals for 
various distributions using the Inverse of the CDF.  (You will learn more 
on the Inverse in the next sub-section.)

7.1.C 
INVERSE MAPPING FUNCTIONS 
The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) tells us “For any X series, the 
probability of the value of X falling below a specific x value can be 
calculated from the height of the Cumulative Density Function (CDF) 
at that x value.” 
An inverse function does the reverse mapping: “For a probability P, the X 
to who’s left the probability of the data lying can be obtained by a reverse 
reading of the Cumulative Density Function (CDF).  That is, from 
“Desired Cumulative Probability Æ unknown X that will give this desired 
cumulative probability P.” 
Alternatively, “Inverse” functions find the X value that corresponds to a 
certain “probability of values below the X equaling a known cumulative 
probability.” 
Figure 103:  Reading inverse mapping from a Cumulative Density Function (CDF).  The 
arrows show the values below which are 95% of the values of the data series. 
 
Inverse functions permit easy construction of Confidence intervals.  
This will be shown several times in further sections whenever I discuss 
the construction of Confidence intervals.

NORMAL DENSITY FUNCTION 
The Normal Density Function has several properties that make it easy to 
make generalized inferences for the attributes of a series whose Density 
Function can be said to be “Normal.” 
Figure 104:  A Normal Probability Density Function 
 

Chapter 7: Probabiity Density Functions & Confidence Intervals

Symmetry 
The major measures of central tendency — the mean, median, and mode 
— all lie at the same point right at the place where the bell shaped curve 
is at its greatest height. 
The Density Function is perfectly symmetrical around this “confluence” of 
central tendencies.  Therefore, the left half of the Density Function 
(measured as all points to the left of the mode/median/mean) is a mirror 
image of the right half of the Density Function. 
This is shown in the next figure — the lighter shaded half is a mirror 
image of the darker shaded half.  So, the frequency of the values of the 
variables becomes lower (that is, the height of the curve lowers) as you 
move away from the mode/mean/median towards either extreme.  This 
change is gradual and occurs at the same rate for negative and positive 
deviations from the mean. 
Figure 105:  An idealized “symmetrical” Normal Density Function.  Note that the relatively 
lightly shaded half is a mirror image of the relatively darker shaded half 
 
The symmetry also implies that: 
(a)  The Density Function is not “skewed” to the left or right of the 
mode/median/mean (and, thus, the Skewness measure = 0)  
(b)  The Density Function is not “too” peaked (which would imply that the 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
116 
change in probability is very rapid when moving from the 
mode/median/mean towards an extreme) nor “too” flat (which 
would imply that the change in probability is very slow when 
moving from the mode/median/mean towards an extreme).   
The first property implies that Skewness = 0, and the second 
implies that Kurtosis = 0. 
Convenience of using the Normal Density Function 
If a series is Normally distributed, then you just need two parameters for 
defining the Density Function for any series X— the mean and standard 
deviation of the variables values!  This is because, once you know the 
mean, you also know the mode and median (as these two statistics equal 
the mean for a Normal Density Function). 
Once you know the standard deviation, you know the spread of values 
around the mean/mode/median.  (A series that follows a Normal Density 
Function is not skewed to the left or right, nor is “too” peaked or “too” 
flat.) 
Are all large-sample series Normally Distributed? 
Some formal mathematical theorems and proofs support the theory that 
“as the sample size gets larger most Density Functions become more like 
the Normal Density Function.”  Therefore, for example, if a series has a 
left skewed Density Function when a sample of 20 observations is used, it 
may also behave more like a symmetrical (that is, a zero–skewed) Normal 
Density Function if the sample size is, for example, 1000 observations. 
(Even if the Density Function does not have the classic bell–shape of a 

Chapter 7: Probabiity Density Functions & Confidence Intervals 
117 
normal curve, it can behave like a Normal Density Function if it satisfies 
— to a sufficient extent — the conditions that imply normality – 
• 
The fact that the mode, mean and median are very close to each 
other 
• 
An additional feature is that the Density Function is roughly 
symmetrical around the mode/median/mean. 
Statistics & Econometrics: Dependence of Methodologies on the 
assumption of Normality 
Assuming that variables are distributed Normally is a practice that 
underlies— and even permits— most hypothesis testing in econometrics 
and statistics.  Without this assumption, statistics, as we know it, would 
lose much of its power to estimate coefficients and establish relationships 
amongst variables. 
Assume you have three variables — X1, X2, and X3.  X1 is measured in 
dollars with a mean of $2.30, X2 also in dollars with a mean of $30,000 
and X3 in tons.  You assume that all the variables are distributed 
Normally.  This permits you to make inferences about the series.  Once 
you know the mean and standard deviation for X1, you can make 
statements like “60% of the values of X1 lie below $2.62,” “Between the 
values $24,000 and $28,000, we will find that 18% of the values of X2 will 
lie,” or, “Over 40% of the values of X3 lie below 24 tons.”  (Note: the 
figures are chosen arbitrarily).  This is fine.  But the problem is that the 
relation between the “mean, standard deviation, X values and probability” 
must be calculated anew for each of the variables because they are 
measured in different units  (dollars versus tons)  or/and on different 
scales and ranges  (X1 versus X2 in our example). 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
118 
This limits the usefulness of using the Normal Density Function to assess 
the relation between series values and the probability of values occurring 
less than, equal to or above them.  In practical terms, you would need a 
statistics textbook that lays out the relationship between an X value and 
probability for all possible combinations of mean and standard deviation! 
The Standard Normal and its power 
Luckily, a method removes the need for such exhaustive table listings.  
This method involves rescaling all series that follows a Normal Density 
Functions to a common scale such that, on the new scale, the variables 
have a mean/mode/median of zero and a standard deviation of one.  The 
process is called “standardization” and this standardized Density 
Function is called the standard Normal Density Function or the Z –
Density Function. 
The Z –scores are also used to standardize the Density Functions of the 
means of variables or the estimates of statistical coefficients.  If the 
standard error of mean for the population from which the sample is 
unknown (as is typically the case), then the T Density Function is used 
instead of the Z Density Function.

COUNTING AND SUMMING 
COUNT function 
This function counts the number of valid cells in a range.  Cells are valid 
only if there value is numeric or a date. 
Menu path to function: INSERT /FUNCTION /STATISTICAL 
/COUNT.   
Data requirements: Numbers and dates are included in the count.  Not 
counted cells include those that contain error values, text, blank cells, and 
logical values (like TRUE and FALSE).  The X values can be input as 
references to one or more ranges that may be non–adjacent.   
The second range can be referenced in the first text-box “Value1” after 
placing a comma after the first range, or it could be referenced in the 
second text-box “Value2.”   
If you use the second text-box, then a third text-box “Value3” will 
automatically open.  (As you fill the last visible box, another box opens 
until the maximum number of boxes — 30 — is reached.)

COUNTA function also counts cells with logical or text values 
This function counts the number of valid cells in a range.  Valid values 
include cells with numeric, date, text, logical, or error value.  COUNTA 
only excludes empty cells, but text and logical values are only counted if 
you type them directly into the list of arguments are counted.  If an 
argument is a data array or range reference, only numbers in that data 
array or range reference. 
Figure 128:  The function COUNTA is a variant of the COUNT function.  The example is in the 
sample file “Count.xls.” 
 
Menu path to function: INSERT / FUNCTION / STATISTICAL / 
COUNTA. 
Data requirements: Unlike the COUNT function, COUNTA will include 
the label row in the count.  (So, if you have one label in the referenced 
range, you may want to use “= COUNTA (A:A) — 1”.)  The X values can be 
input as references to one or more ranges that may be non–adjacent.  The 
second range can be referenced in the first text-box “Value1” after placing 
a comma after the first range, or it could be referenced in the second text-
box “Value2.”  If you use the second text-box, then a third text-box 
“Value3” will automatically open.  (As you fill the last visible box, another 
box opens until the maximum number of boxes — 30 — is reached.)  The 
function does not count invalid cell values when counting the number of X 
values. 

Chapter 8: Other Mathematics & Statistics Functions 
147 
COUNTBLANK function counts the number of empty cells in the range 
reference 
This function counts the number of blank cells in a range.   
Menu path to function: INSERT /FUNCTION 
/INFORMATION/COUNTBLANK. 
Figure 129:  COUNTBLANK.  The example is in the sample file “Count.xls.” 
 
SUM function 
This function sums the values in the data array. 
SUM = X1 + X2 +…. +Xn 
Menu path to function: INSERT / FUNCTION / MATH / SUM.   
Figure 130:  SUM 
 
Data requirements: This function does not include blank cells or cells with 
values that are of the following formats: text, and logical values (that is, 
TRUE and FALSE.) 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
148 
PRODUCT function 
This function multiplies all the values referenced. 
PRODUCT = X1 *  X2 *….* Xn 
Figure 131:  PRODUCT (multiplying all the values in a range) 
 
Menu path to function: INSERT / FUNCTION / MATH / PRODUCT. 
SUMPRODUCT function 
This function multiplies corresponding components in two or more data 
arrays/ranges, and then sums the results of these multiplications.  The 
data arrays/ranges must have the same number of data points. 
Menu path to function: INSERT /FUNCTION /MATH /SUMPRODUCT 
Figure 132:  SUMPRODUCT (multiplying individual data points across data series and then 
adding up the results of all these multiplications). 
 
Data Array1, data Array2, data Array3 ... are 2 to 30 data arrays/ranges 
whose components you desire to multiply and then add.  The minimum 
number of arrays is two.  The data arrays must have the same number of 
data points.  Non-numeric cell values are assigned the value of zero. 

Chapter 8: Other Mathematics & Statistics Functions 
149 
The X values can be input as references to two or more ranges that may 
be non–adjacent.  The second range should be referenced in the second 
text-box “Array2.”  If you use the third text-box, then a fourth text-box 
“Array4” will automatically open.  (As you fill the last visible box, another 
box opens until the maximum number of boxes — 30 — is reached.) 
Example 
The following formula multiplies all the components of the two data 
arrays on the preceding worksheet and then adds the products— that is, 
3*2 + 4*7 + 8*6 + 6*7 + 1*5 + 9*3. 
Note:  
Samples will be available at http://www.vjbooks.net/excel/samples.htm. 
8.2 
THE “IF” COUNTING AND SUMMING FUNCTIONS: 
STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS WITH LOGICAL 
CONDITIONS 
I display two “if-then” two-step functions in this section.  The functions 
first evaluate a criterion.  If a cell in the referenced range satisfies the 
criteria then the second part of the function includes this cell. 
SUMIF function  
This function adds the values in a range if the cell with the value satisfies 
a user-defined criterion. 
• 
In the box Range, enter a reference to the range of cells you want 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
150 
evaluated. 
Figure 133:  SUMIF (summing only the cells whose value satisfies one “if” condition) 
 
• 
In the box Criteria, enter the condition (a number, expression, or 
text) that defines which cells values will be summed.  For 
example, Criteria can be expressed as 32, “32,” “>32”. 
• 
In the box Sum_range, you may reference the actual cells to sum.  
The cells in sum range are summed only if their corresponding 
cells in the entire Range match the criteria.  If sum range is 
omitted, all the “criterion-satisfying” cells in the Range are 
summed. 
 
Menu path to function: INSERT /FUNCTION /MATH /SUMIF.  The 
Criteria should be relevant to the type of data/text in the queried range. 
COUNTIF  function  
This function counts the number of cells in a range that satisfy a user-
defined criterion. 
The dialog for “COUNTIF“ requires two inputs from the user.  The 
“Range” is similar to the functions shown previously.  The “Criteria” is a 
logical condition set by you. 

Chapter 8: Other Mathematics & Statistics Functions 
151 
Figure 134:  COUNTIF (counting only the cells whose value satisfies one “if” condition) 
 
• 
In the box Range, enter a reference to the range of cells you seek to 
evaluate. 
• 
In the box Criteria, enter the condition (a number, expression, or 
text) that defines which cells will be counted.  For example, 
Criteria can be expressed as 32, “32,” “>32,” “tea.” 
Menu path to function: INSERT /FUNCTION /STATISTICAL /COUNTIF.   
Data requirements: The range can take any values.  The Criteria should 
be relevant to the type of data/text in the queried range. 
 
Example 
Choose the range “D:D” and the condition “>1,000,000”.  The function is 
“Count the number of cases in the range D:D, but only if the value of the 
cell is greater than 1 million.”   
For a pictorial reproduction of this, see the next figure.

Log natural  
LN (X) 
This function calculates the 
natural logarithm of a 
number.  Natural 
logarithms are based on 
the constant e (2.718). 
LN (85) = 4.454347.   
This mean: “If you raise the 
base e to the power of 4.45 
you will get 85.  Æ  LN (85)

LOG10 (X) 
This function calculates the 
base 10 logarithm of a 
number. 
LOG10 (85) = 1.934 
because the base of 10 
needs to be raised 1.934 
times to get 85:  
  101.934 = 85 
LOG10 (10)  = 1 because

ADD-INS: ENHANCING EXCEL 
This chapter discusses the following topics: 
— WHAT CAN AN ADD-IN DO? 
— WHY USE AN ADD-IN (AND NOT JUST EXCEL 
MACROS/PROGRAMS)? 
— ADD–INS INSTALLED WITH EXCEL 
— OTHER ADD-INS 
— THE STATISTICS ADD-IN 
— CHOOSING THE ADD-INS 
9.1 
ADD-INS: INTRODUCTION 
An “Add-In” is a software application that adds new functionality to 
Excel.  The Add-In typically seamlessly fits into the Excel interface, 
providing accessibility to its functionality through 
— new menus 
— new options in existing menus 
— new functions  

Chapter 9: Add-ins: Enhancing Excel 
161 
— new toolbars and specific toolbar icons 
9.1.A 
WHAT CAN AN ADD-IN DO? 
Almost anything an imaginative software developer could create.  
Usually, an Add-In provides functionality that is useful for a particular 
type of analysis/industry — statistics, finance, real estate, etc. 
9.1.B 
WHY USE AN ADD-IN? 
The Add-In could have its base code written in software languages like C, 
C++, FORTRAN, Pascal, etc.  This is important because some algorithms 
and operations (like simulations) operate best when written in a specific 
language.  Therefore, the developer uses the best language/tool to create 
the functionality and then packages this inside an Add-In. 
9.2 
ADD–INS INSTALLED WITH EXCEL 
Some Add–Ins are available in the Microsoft Office CD–ROM and are 
installed (but not activated10) along with Excel.  I show the use of three 
Add–ins. 
                                         
10 Figure 540 and Figure 542 show how to activate the Add-ins 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
162 
9.3 
OTHER ADD-INS 
Many commercially sold Add-Ins can be almost like separate software just 
needing Excel as the “host.”  Two examples: 
— Crystal Ball risk analysis software 
— UNISTAT software for conducting advanced statistics and 
econometrics from inside Excel 
Hundreds of software companies construct Add-Ins.  The greatest 
contribution of this book, if I succeed in doing so, would be the opening of 
this massive potential functionality to Excel users. 
9.4 
THE STATISTICS ADD-IN 
The Analysis ToolPak Add-In that ships with Excel can conduct several 
procedures including descriptives, regression, ANOVA, F-test, correlation, 
T-tests, moving average, and histogram.  Let us learn how to use this 
“Add-In.” 
9.4.A 
CHOOSING THE ADD-INS 
Choose the menu option TOOLS/ADD-INS.  You will see several Add-Ins 
as shown in Figure 140.  (You may not see all the Add–Ins shown in the 
next two figures.) 

Chapter 9: Add-ins: Enhancing Excel 
163 
Figure 140:  Selecting an Add-In 
 
Figure 141: In Excel XP, the Add-Ins dialog provides access to “Automation.”  This topic is 
beyond the scope of this book. 
 
You need the “Analysis ToolPak Add-Ins.”  Select — by clicking on it — 
the box to the left of these Add-Ins (shown in Figure 142).  Execute the 
dialog by clicking on the button OK and wait for some time while the Add-
Ins are “loaded” or “registered” with Excel.  An Add-In has to be 
loaded/registered before it is available for use.  The Add-In remains 
loaded across sessions.  It is only “unloaded” when you select the option 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
164 
TOOLS/ADD-INS and deselect the Add-In11. 
Figure 142:  The Add-In pair for data analysis 
 
You have activated the “Analysis ToolPak.”  At the bottom of the menu 
TOOLS, you will see the option “DATA ANALYSIS the bottom— this 
option was not there before you accessed the Add-In.  (This is illustrated 
in Figure 143.) 
The statistical procedures are accessed through this new option. 
Note:  
Usually Add-Ins expose their functionality by creating new menu 
options or even new menus.  The menu option “Data analysis” 
provides the statistics functionality available in “Analysis ToolPak” 
and “Analysis ToolPak VB.”  The menu options “Optquest” down till 
CB Bootstrap” are linked to the Add-in “Crystal Ball” (not shipped in 
the Office CD-ROM). 
                                         
11 If too many Add-Ins are loaded, Excel may work too slowly, or even freeze.  If you find 
this problem occurring, then just load the Add-in when you are going to use it and 
unload it before quitting Excel.

CHAPTER 10 
 
 
STATISTICS TOOLS 
This chapter discusses the following topics: 
— DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 
— RANK AND PERCENTILE 
— BIVARIATE RELATIONS— CORRELATION, COVARIANCE 
A proper analysis of data must begin with an analysis of the statistical 
attributes of each series in isolation — univariate analysis.  From such an 
analysis, you can learn: 
— How the values of a series are distributed — normal, binomial, 
etc. 
— The central tendency of the values of a series (mean, median, 
and mode) 
— Dispersion of the values (standard deviation, variance, range, 
and quartiles) 
— Presence of outliers (extreme values) 

Chapter 10: Statistics Tools 
169 
The answer to these questions illuminates and motivates further, more 
complex, analysis.  Moreover, failure to conduct univariate analysis may 
restrict the usefulness of further procedures (like correlation and 
regression).  Reason: even if improper/incomplete univariate analysis may 
not directly hinder the conducting of more complex procedures, the 
interpretation of output from the latter will become difficult (because you 
will not have an adequate understanding of how each series behaves). 
Note: I do not go into the details of each statistics procedure.  For such 
details, refer to your statistics textbook or to “SPSS for Beginners” 
(available at http://www.vjbooks.net and amazon.com). 
This chapter requires the Analysis ToolPak Add-Ins; chapter 9 shows how 
to learn how to launch the Add-Ins. 
10.1 
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 
I do not supply the sample data for most of the examples in chapters 36-40.  
My experience is that many readers glaze over the examples and do not go 
through the difficult step of drawing inferences from a result if the sample 
data results are the same as those in the examples in the book. 
Choose the menu option TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS12.  The dialog shown 
in Figure 144 opens. 
                                         
12 If you do not see this option, then use TOOLS / ADD-INS to activate the Add-In for 
data analysis.  Refer to section 41.4. 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
170 
 
Figure 144:  The options for the menu TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS 
 
Choose the statistical procedure “Descriptive Statistics.”  The dialog for 
“Descriptive Statistics” opens.  Figure 145 shows this dialog (user-input 
form). 
Figure 145:  Descriptive Statistics dialog 
 

Chapter 10: Statistics Tools 
171 
Input (or, “Source”) data 
Choose the data series whose descriptives you desire.  Click on the edge of 
the box next to “Input Range” (at the point where the dotted arrow points 
in Figure 145). 
Options 
Choose other options shown in Figure 145.  Select the option “Labels in 
first row” because the names of the three series are in the first row of the 
range you selected (the labels are in cells C1, D1, and E1)— this way 
Excel picks up the names of the variables and uses these names in the 
output13.  Execute the dialog by clicking on the button OK. 
Output 
Excel produces the descriptive statistics and places the results in a new 
worksheet.  (This is illustrated in Figure 146.) 
                                         
13 Note that in the output of this procedure (shown in Figure 546) the first row has the 
labels for the three variables— 1995, 2000, and 2010.

Example 2: Adding additional parameters to the descriptives table 
Go to the menu option TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS.  Select the option 
“Descriptive Statistics.”  In addition to the statistics requested in the 
previous example, I request Excel to report on the fifth largest and fifth 
smallest values for each column/series.

RANK AND PERCENTILE 
This tool produces a table that contains the ordinal and percentage rank 
of each value in a data set.  You can analyze the relative standing of 
values in a data set.  The Percentile values can assist in learning about 
the spread of the series across its range.  For a series provides information 
on the ranges for the lowest 25%, the next 25%, the next 25%, and the 

Chapter 10: Statistics Tools 
175 
highest 25%. 
Go to14 the menu option TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS15.  Select the option 
“Rank and Percentile.”  The dialog is shown in the next figure. 
Figure 148:  Rank and Percentile tool 
 
The result is reproduced in the next table.  Each output table contains 
four columns: 
— The place of the data point in the data series, 
— The value of the data (with the label for the series as the label 
on the output column), 
— The rank of the data point within the range, and 
                                         
14 I do not supply the sample data for most of the examples in chapter 42 to chapter 46.  
My experience is that many readers glaze over the examples and do not go through 
the difficult step of drawing inferences from a result if the sample data results are 
the same as those in the examples in the book.

BIVARIATE RELATIONS— CORRELATION, 
COVARIANCE 
Correlation analysis 
This tool and its formulas measure the relationship between two data sets 
that are scaled to be independent of the unit of measurement.  The 
correlation coefficient depicts the basic relationship across two variables: 
“Do two variables have a tendency to increase together or to change in 
opposite directions and, if so, by how much?” Bivariate correlations 
measure the correlation coefficients between two variables at a time, 
ignoring the effect of all other variables. 
Go to the menu option TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS16.  Select the option 
“Correlation.” 
Select the “Input Range” — it must have more than one data series. 
                                         
16 If you do not see this option, then use TOOLS / ADD-INS to activate the Add-In for 
data analysis.  Refer to section 41.4.

Interpreting the output 
— A high level of correlation is implied by a correlation coefficient 
that is greater than 0.5 in absolute terms (that is, greater than 
0.5 or less than –0.5). 
— A mid level of correlation is implied if the absolute value of the 
coefficient is greater than 0.2 but less that 0.5. 
— A low level of correlation is implied if the absolute value of the 
coefficient is less than 0.2. 

Chapter 10: Statistics Tools 
179 
10.3.A 
COVARIANCE TOOL AND FORMULA 
The options are same as for the CORRELATION TOOL.  The covariance 
is dependent on the scale of measurement of the data series.  Therefore, 
there is no standard scale from which to infer if a covariance value is 
“high” or “low.”  Thus, use the correlation tool that provides a uniform 
scale of “–1 to 1.” 
The coefficient of determination can be roughly interpreted as the 
proportion of variance in a series that can be explained by the values of 
the other series.  The coefficient is calculated by squaring the correlation 
coefficient.

 HYPOTHESIS TESTING 
This chapter teaches: 
— Z-TESTING FOR POPULATION MEANS WHEN POPULATION 
VARIANCES ARE KNOWN 
— PAIRED SAMPLE T-TESTS 
— T-TESTING MEANS WHEN THE TWO SAMPLES ARE FROM 
DISTINCT GROUPS 
— THE PRETEST— F-TESTING FOR EQUALITY IN VARIANCES 
— T-TEST: TWO–SAMPLE ASSUMING UNEQUAL VARIANCES 
— T-TEST: TWO–SAMPLE ASSUMING EQUAL VARIANCES 
— ANOVA 
The statistics Add-In provides some procedures for hypothesis testing.  
The “Inverse Functions” in Excel 
 (see 7.1) and 
other statistics software can be used to build Confidence Interval’s that 
provide the values for the “Critical Regions” for conducting hypothesis 
tests.  The use of the functions opens up a much wider range of possible 
hypothesis tests limited only by the Inverse functions available in Excel. 
I include a set of “testing rules” in several of the examples.  These rules 
will blow your mind — it will make hypothesis testing a readily 
comprehensible step–by–step process.  The rules will assist you in all 
hypothesis tests— in Excel or otherwise.

11.1 
Z-TESTING FOR POPULATION MEANS WHEN 
POPULATION VARIANCES ARE KNOWN 
This tool performs a two–sample Z-test for means with known variances.  
This tool is used to test hypotheses about the difference between two 
population means. 
Possible hypothesis for testing 
u1 is the mean of sample one.  u2 is the mean for sample two.  The critical 
regions are based on a 5% significance level (or, equivalently, a 95% 
Confidence Interval) 
(a) Two–tailed 
The hypothesis 
— H0 (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 = 1 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 <> 1 
Critical region: 
— “Fail to accept” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated Z is higher than 1.96.  Examples of such Z values are: 
“+2.12” and “–2.12.” 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
184 
— “Fail to reject” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated Z is lower than 1.96.  Examples of such Z values are: 
“+1.78,” “0.00” and “–1.78.” 
In short, if the absolute value of the Z is higher than 1.96, then one may 
conclude (with 95% Confidence) that the means of the samples differ by 
the hypothesized difference. 
(b) One–tailed (left-tail) 
The hypothesis: 
— H0 (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 >= 1 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 < 1 (one–tailed) 
Critical region: 
— “Fail to accept” the null hypothesis if the value of the calculated 
Z is lower than “–1.64.”  Examples of such Z values are: “–2.12” 
and “–1.78.” 
— “Fail to reject” the null hypothesis if left-tail) 
The value of the calculated Z is greater than “–1.64.”  Examples of such Z 
values are: “+1.78” and “0.00.” 
In short, if the Z is lower than “–1.64,” then one may conclude (with 95% 
Confidence) that the means of the samples differ by the hypothesized 
difference. 

Chapter 11: Hypothesis Testing 
185 
(c) One–tailed (right-tail) 
The hypothesis: 
— H0  (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 <= 1 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 > 1 (one–tailed) 
Critical region: 
— “Fail to accept” the null hypothesis if the value of the calculated 
Z is greater than “+1.64.”  Examples of such Z values are: “+2.12” 
and “+1.78.” 
— “Fail to reject” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated Z is less than “+1.64.”  Examples of such Z values are: 
“–1.78” and “0.00.” 
In short, if the Z is greater than “+1.64,” then one may conclude (with 95% 
Confidence) that the means of the samples differ by the hypothesized 
difference. 
Excel calculates the P or Significance value for each test you run. 
— If P is less than 0.10, then the test is significant at 90% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the means are 
equal can be rejected at the 90% level of Confidence).  This 
criterion is considered too “loose” by some. 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
186 
— If P is less than 0.05, then the test is significant at 95% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the means are 
equal can be rejected at the 95% level of Confidence).  This is the 
standard criterion used. 
— If P is less than 0.01, then the test is significant at 99% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the means are 
equal can be rejected at the 99% level of Confidence).  This is the 
strictest criterion used. 
You should memorize these criteria, as nothing is more helpful in 
interpreting the output from hypothesis tests (including all the tests 
intrinsic to every regression, ANOVA and other analysis). 
Go to TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS17.  Select the option “Z-test.”  The dialog 
(user-input form) that opens is shown in the next figure. 
Enter the hypothesized mean difference (that is, the Null Hypothesis) into 
the text-box “Hypothesized Mean Difference.”  Enter the variances for the 
two populations. 
                                         
17 If you do not see this option, then use TOOLS / ADD-INS to activate the Add-In for 
data analysis.  Refer to section 41.4.

Interpreting the output 
The P value (that is “P (Z<= or >= z) two–tail”) of 0.081 implies that we 
fail to reject the null for the two one–tail hypothesis.  Moreover, Z= –1.397 
implies that we “fail to reject” the null hypothesis because the Z is in the 
acceptance region (“1.96,” “–1.96”) for the two–tail hypothesis. 
The P value (that is “P (Z<>z) two–tail”) of 0.163 implies that we fail to 
reject the null for the two–tail hypothesis.  In addition, if we use a one–
tailed (left tail) test, we again fail to reject the null hypothesis because the 
Z is in the acceptance region (“> –1.645”) for the left–tail hypothesis.  If 
we use a one–tail (right tail) test, we fail to reject the Null because the Z 
is in the acceptance region (“< +1.645”) for the right–tail hypothesis. 
11.2 
T-TESTING MEANS WHEN THE TWO SAMPLES ARE 
FROM DISTINCT GROUPS 
11.2.A 
THE PRETEST— F-TESTING FOR EQUALITY IN VARIANCES 
The T-test is used most often to test for differences in means across 
samples from distinct groups.  The respondents in the two samples differ.  
An example is a pair of samples from two surveys on earnings, one survey 
in country A and the other in country B.  The formula used in estimating 
the T statistic depends on the equality of variance for the data series 

Chapter 11: Hypothesis Testing 
189 
across the two samples.  In particular, if the variances of the two samples 
are unequal the formula takes into account this difference across the 
samples.  An F-test is used to test for unequal variances. 
The “F-test Two–sample for Variances” performs a test to compare the 
variances across two groups of data.  Launch the procedure by accessing 
the menu option TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS20 and selecting the “F-test 
Two–sample for Variances.” 
The relevant dialog is reproduced in the next figure. 
Figure 151:  F-test Two–Sample for Variances 
 
Choose the “alpha” for level of significance.  A 0.05 level sets up a 95% 
confidence test.

21 I do not supply the sample data for most of the examples in chapter 42 to chapter 46.  
My experience is that many readers glaze over the examples and do not go through 
the difficult step of drawing inferences from a result if the sample data results are 
the same as those in the examples in the book. 

Chapter 11: Hypothesis Testing 
191 
— If P is less than 0.10, then the test is significant at 90% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the variances are 
equal can be rejected at the 90% level of Confidence).  The P of 
0.0926 implies the test is significant at the 90% Confidence level.  
Being “significant” implies that the estimated F statistic lies in 
the critical region and the “null hypothesis cannot be accepted.”  
You are in the area represented by the alternate hypothesis — 
the variances are unequal. 
— If P is less than 0.05, then the test is significant at 95% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the variances are 
equal can be rejected at the 95% level of Confidence).  The 
hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 0.05 level of significance. 
— If P is less than 0.01, then the test is significant at 99% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the variances are 
equal can be rejected at the 99% level of Confidence).  The 
hypothesis of equal variances cannot be rejected at the 0.01 level 
of significance. 
The test is significant only at the 0.10 level of significance.  The critical 
estimated F of 0.81 is higher than the critical F of 0.8747 implying that 
the “null hypothesis of equal variances” cannot be accepted at a 0.05 level 
of Confidence. 
Once you know if the null hypothesis of equal variances can be accepted, 
you can resolve whether to use the “Two–Sample T-test Assuming Equal 
Variances” or “Two–Sample T-test Assuming Unequal Variances.”

11.2.B 
T-TEST: TWO–SAMPLE ASSUMING UNEQUAL VARIANCES 
This T-test form assumes that the variances of both ranges of data are 
unequal.  Use this test when the groups under study are distinct.  Use a 
paired test (discussed in the next section) when there is one group before 
and after a treatment. 
Possible hypothesis for testing 
u1 is the mean of sample one.  u2 is the mean for sample two.  The critical 
regions are based on a 5% significance level (or, equivalently, a 95% 
Confidence Interval) 
(a) Two–tailed 
The hypothesis 
 
— H0 (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 = 0 (or any non–zero value) 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 <> 0 
Critical region: 
— “Fail to accept” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated T is higher than 1.96.  Examples of such Z values are: 
“+2.12” and “–2.12.” 
— “Fail to reject” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated T is lower than 1.96.  Examples of such T values are: 
“+1.78,” “0.00” and “–1.78.” 
In short, if the absolute value of the T is higher than 1.96, then one may 
conclude (with 95% Confidence) that the means of the samples differ by 
the hypothesized difference. 

Chapter 11: Hypothesis Testing 
193 
(b) One–tailed (left-tail) 
The hypothesis: 
— H0 (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 >= 0 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 < 0 (one–tailed) 
Critical region: 
— “Fail to accept” the null hypothesis if the value of the calculated 
T is lower than “–1.64.”  Examples of such T values are: “–2.12” 
and “–1.78.” 
— “Fail to reject” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated T is greater than “–1.64.”  Examples of such T values 
are: “+1.78” and “0.00.” 
In short, if the T is lower than “–1.64,” one may conclude (with 95%

Critical region: 
— “Fail to accept” the null hypothesis if the value of the calculated 
T is greater than “+1.64.”  Examples of such T values are: “+2.12” 
and “+1.78.” 
— “Fail to reject” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated T is less than “+1.64.”  Examples of such T values are: 
“–1.78” and “0.00.” 
In short, if the T is greater than “+1.64,” then one may conclude (with 95%

Interpreting the output 
The row “Mean” shows the estimated means for the two samples s1 and 
s2.  The next column “Variance” displays the calculated variance for these 
sample mean values.  “Df” shows the “Degree of Freedom.”  The degrees of 
freedom equal the total sample points (the sum of the sample sizes of the 
two samples) minus the one degree of freedom to account for the one 
equation (the “hypothesized mean difference” which here is “u1 — u2 = 5”) 
.  So, degrees of freedom equals “168 + 168 -1 = 331”. 
(a) Two–tailed 
The hypothesis was: 
 
— H0 (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 = 5 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 <> 5, where u1 is the mean 
of sample s1 and u2 the mean of sample s2.

The calculated T statistic is “–7.465.”  The P value for the two–tailed test 
is “3.72 multiplied by the 13th point after the decimal” or 
“0.000000000000372.”  As the P value is less than 0.01, the hypothesis is 
“significant24“at the 99% Confidence level or “alpha = 0.01” level of 
significance.  (The natural extension of this inference is that the 
hypothesis is significant at the 95% and 90% Confidence levels also.) 
The region for the two–tailed test is “> 1.967 or < –1.967.”  In this 
example, the test is significant (at a 0.05 level of significance because the 
estimated T lies in the critical region.  (The estimated T of “–7.465” lies in 
the region “< –1.967”.) 
(b) One–tailed (left-tail) 
The hypothesis was: 
— H0 (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 >= 5 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 < 5, where u1 is the mean of 
sample s1 and u2 the mean of sample s2. 
 
The P value for the one–tailed test is “7.45 multiplied by the 13th point 
after the decimal” or “0.000000000000745.”  The relevant test here is the 
left–tail because the T statistic is a negative value.  As the P value is less 
                                         
24 If a test is “significant” the implication is a “failure to accept” the null hypothesis.  
The test T statistic lies in the critical region.  In informal terms, the alternate 
hypothesis is “correct.”

than 0.01, the hypothesis is “significant” at the 99% Confidence level or 
“alpha = 0.01” level of significance.  (The natural extension of this 
inference is that the hypothesis is significant at the 95% and 90% 
Confidence levels also.) 
Another way to test the hypothesis is to compare the estimated T statistic 
to the critical region shown in the column “T Critical one–tail.”  The 
region for the left–tailed test is “< –1.649”.  In this example, the test is 
“significant25“at a .05 level of significance because the estimated T lies in 
the critical region.  (The estimated T of “–7.465” lies in the region “< –
1.649”.) 
(c) One–tailed (right-tail) 
The hypothesis was: 
— H0  (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 <= 5 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 > 5, where u1 is the mean of 
sample s1 and u2 the mean of sample s2. 
The region for the right–tailed test is “> 1.649”.  In this example, the test 
is not significant because the estimated T does not lie in the critical 
region.  (The estimated T of “–7.465” is not in the region “>1.649”.) 
                                         
25 If a test is “significant” the implication is a “failure to accept” the null hypothesis.  
The test T statistic lies in the critical region.  In informal terms, the alternate 
hypothesis is “correct.”

T-TEST: TWO–SAMPLE ASSUMING EQUAL VARIANCES 
This tool performs a two–sample student's T-test— under the assumption 
that the variances of both data sets are equal.  The hypothesis and 
interpretation of results is the same as for the Two–Sample Assuming 
Unequal Variances.  (See previous sub-section). 
The next table shows the result this type of test26. 
11.3 
PAIRED SAMPLE T-TESTS 
This tool performs a paired two–sample T-test to deduce whether the 
difference between the sample means is statistically distinct from a 
hypothesized difference.  This T-test form does not assume that the 
variances of both populations are equal.  You can use a paired test when 
there is a natural pairing of observations in the samples, such as when a 
sample group is tested twice— before and after an experiment.  The tested 
groups form a “Paired Sample” with the same respondents sampled 
“before” and “after” an event.

Place the hypothesized difference in means into the checkbox 
“Hypothesized Mean Difference.”  In this example, one is using the 
hypothesis: 
“H0 (Null Hypothesis): mean difference > 5”.  See the next figure for 
an example of setting the hypothesis for testing.  Set a 
hypothesized mean difference of zero to test the standard 
hypothesis that the “Means for the two groups/samples are 
statistically different.” 
The level of significance for the hypothesis tests should be placed in 
the checkbox “Alpha.”  If you desire a significance level of “alpha = 
.05” (that is, a Confidence level of 95%), then write in “.05” into the 
checkbox Alpha.  The next figure illustrates this.

Possible hypothesis for testing 
u1 is the mean of sample one.  u2 is the mean for sample two.  The critical 
regions are based on a 5% significance level (or, equivalently, a 95% 
Confidence Interval) 
(a) Two–tailed 
The hypothesis 
 
— H0 (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 = 0 
— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 <> 0 
Critical region: 
— “Fail to accept” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated T is higher than 1.96.  Examples of such T values are: 
“+2.12” and “–2.12.” 
— “Fail to reject” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated T is lower than 1.96.  Examples of such T values are: 
“+1.78,” “0.00” and “–1.78.” 
In short, if the absolute value of the T is higher than 1.96, then one may 
conclude (with 95% Confidence) that the means of the samples differ by 
the hypothesized difference. 
(b) One–tailed (left-tail) 
The hypothesis: 
— H0 (Null Hypothesis): u1— u2 >= 0

— Ha (Alternate hypothesis): u1— u2 < 0 (one–tailed)

and “–1.78.” 
— “Fail to reject” the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the 
calculated T is greater than “–1.64”.  Examples of such T values 
are: “+1.78” and “0.00.” 
In short, if the T is lower than “–1.64,” then one may conclude (with 95%

In short, if the T is greater than “+1.64,” then one may conclude (with 95% 
Confidence) that the means of the samples differ by the hypothesized 
difference. 
Excel calculates the P or Significance value for each test you run. 
— If P is less than 0.10, then the test is significant at 90% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the means are 
equal can be rejected at the 90% level of Confidence).  This 
criterion is considered too “loose” by some. 
— If P is less than 0.05, then the test is significant at 95% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the means are 
equal can be rejected at the 95% level of Confidence).  This is the 
standard criterion used. 
— If P is less than 0.01, then the test is significant at 99% 
Confidence (equivalently, the hypothesis that the means are 
equal can be rejected at the 99% level of Confidence).  This is the 
strictest criterion used. 
You should memorize these criteria, as nothing is more helpful in 
interpreting the output from hypothesis tests (including all the tests 
intrinsic to every regression, ANOVA and other analysis).  The output for

Interpreting the output 
The information on “Between Groups” is derived from the difference in 
means and variances across the groups.  In an ANOVA, the number of 
groups may exceed two. 
— The test is analyzing the variance as measured by the SS “Sum of 
Squares” of the “dependent” series.  The total Sum of Squares is 
12159.27.  Of this, 0.62 can be explained by the differences across the 
means of the two groups.  The other 12158.65 is explained by the 
differences across individual values of the “dependent” series. 
• Sum of Squares = Sum of Squares for Between Groups + Sum of 
Squares for Within Groups 
— The MS is the “Mean Sum of Squares” and is estimated by dividing the 
SS by the degrees of freedom.  Therefore, the MS for “Between Groups” 
equals (0.62/1) = 0.62.  (Note that “ANOVA = Analysis of Variance.”)  
The MS for “Within Groups” equals (12158.65/334) = 36.403.  The MS 
may be informally interpreted as “Sum of Squares Explained per Degree 
of Freedom.”   
• Mean Sum of Squares = (Sum of Squares)/ (Degrees of Freedom) 

Chapter 11: Hypothesis Testing 
207 
— The ANOVA uses an F-test to determine if “Between Groups” 
information (the number 0.62 in the column “Between Groups” Source 
of Variation MS) provides sufficient additional information to improve 
the ability of the data to explain the variance in the “dependent” series.  
The ANOVA is asking “Does the Between Groups Sum of Squares 
Explained per Degree of Freedom” divided by the “Within Groups Sum 
of Squares” provide an F that is large enough to justify the statement 
“The use of Between Groups information explains a statistically 
significant amount of the Sum of Squares of the dependent series.” 
• F = (Mean Sum of Squares Between Groups)/ (Mean Sum of 
Squares Within Groups) 
— All ANOVA tests (including the ANOVA output from a regression) can 
be interpreted in the same way – 
• F = [  (Increase in ability of model to explain the Sum of 
Squares)/ (Degrees of Freedom) /  
(Total Sum of Squares) / (Degrees of Freedom)]

CHAPTER 12 
 
 
 REGRESSION 
This chapter discusses the following topics: 
— ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING REGRESSION MODELS 
— CONDUCTING THE REGRESSION 
This chapter requires the Analysis ToolPak Add-Ins; chapter 9 
shows how to learn how to launch the Add-Ins. 
12.1 
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING REGRESSION 
MODELS 
The field of econometrics uses regression analysis to create quantitative 
models that can be used to predict the value of a series if one knows the 
value of several other variables.  For example, the wage per hour can be 
predicted if one knows the values of the variables that constitute the 
regression equation.  This is a big leap of faith from a correlation or 
Confidence interval estimate.  In a correlation, the statistician is not 
presuming or implying any causality or deduction of causality.  On the 
other hand, regression analysis is used so often (probably even abused) 
because of its supposed ability to link cause and effect.  Skepticism of 
causal relationships is not only healthy but also important because real 
power of regression lies in a comprehensive interpretation of the results. 

Chapter 12: Regression 
211 
Regression models are used to test the statistical validity of causal 
relation presumed in theory or hypothesis.  Regression can never be 
divorced from the hypothesis it is testing.  The construction of the model 
has to be based upon the hypothesis, and not on the availability of the 
data.  Therefore, if you believe you have a valid hypothesis, but do not 
have the correct data series to represent each factor in your hypothesis, 
the best practice is not running a regression analysis.   
On the other hand, the method of throwing in all variables into the model 
and making the computer select the best model is a misleading technique 
that sadly has gained popularity because of the belief that the best model 
is the one that fits the data the best.   
The best models can only be a subset of “valid models.”  (That is, models 
that have passed all diagnostic test for presumptions for conforming to the 
assumptions required by a regression.)  Furthermore, note that if the 
model is shown to “not fit” the data, or the expected relationship between 
variables is estimated as negligible, you still have valid results.  The 
variance between the hypothesis and the results is always important and 
can give rise to a new perspective relative to the hypothesis. 
The process of interpretation is called inferential analysis and is far more 
important than the actual number punching.  Inferential analysis also 
includes testing if the data and model have complied with the strong 
assumptions underlying a regression model.   
The very veracity and validity depends upon several diagnostic tests.  
Unfortunately, many econometricians do not perform the diagnostic 
testing or simply lie about the inferences and conclusions derived from the 
model.   
Our book “Interpreting Regression Output” provides a summary table (a 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
212 
cheat–sheet for you!) that lists the implications of the invalidity of 
assumptions.  (The book can be purchased at http://www.vjbooks.net).  
This summary provides, in one page, what other books have spread out 
over many chapters.  Please use this table as a checklist before you 
interpret any model.  Most statistic professors and textbooks teach the 
interpretation of regression results before discussing the issue of validity.  
You will save yourself a lot of grief if you always perform diagnostics after 
running a regression model. 
Once you have a valid model, interpret the results in the logical sequence 
shown in the table interpreting regression output in our book 
“Interpreting Regression Output.”  This table will provide a framework 
and flowchart for interpretation thereby enabling a structured and 
comprehensive inferential analysis. 
12.1.A 
ASSUMPTION 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANY ONE 
INDEPENDENT SERIES AND THE DEPENDENT SERIES CAN BE 
CAPTURED BY A STRAIGHT LINE IN A 2–AXIS GRAPH 
This is also called the assumption of linearity in the regression 
coefficients.  (None of the regression coefficients — the betas — should 
have an exponential power or any other non— linear transformation.) 
12.1.B 
ASSUMPTION 2: THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES DO NOT 
CHANGE IF THE SAMPLING IS REPLICATED 
The independent variables are truly independent— the model assumes is 
using deviations across the X variables to explain the dependent series.  
The regression attempts to explain the dependent series’ variations across 

Chapter 12: Regression 
213 
the combination of values of the independent variables.   
If repeated samples are used, the model predicts the same predicted 
dependent series for each combination of X values, but— across the 
samples— the observed Y may differ across the same combination of X 
values.  (The gap between the predicted and observed Y values is the 
residual or error.) 
12.1.C 
ASSUMPTION 3: 
THE SAMPLE SIZE MUST BE GREATER 
THAN THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES (N 
SHOULD BE GREATER THAN K–1) 
This assumption ensures that a basic mathematical postulate is adhered 
to by the regression algorithm.  A system of simultaneous equations is 
only “determined31“if the number of equations32 is greater than the 
number of unknowns.  That is, only if the number of regression 
coefficients— K minus 1, the subtraction accounting for the coefficient for 
the intercept). 
What information is “known” prior to running the regression? 
— All values of the independent variables are known first.  In 
theory, the independent variables are the “experiment.” 
                                         
31 That is, it can be solved to estimate the optimization parameters — the regression 
coefficients in the case of a regression 
32 The sample size N in the case of a regression

214 
— Once the “experiment” is conducted, the values of the dependent 
series Y are known.  (Not that this “experiment” analogy holds 
even if the data for the independent and dependent variables are 
obtained from the same data collection survey.) 
— The regression minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, 
which is the same as minimizing the square of the difference 
between the observed and the predicted dependent series.  The 
number of residuals equals the number of observations.  Thus, 
the number of equations equals the number of observations. 
What information is “unknown” prior to running the regression? 
The regression coefficients — the betas — are unknown.  Once the 
regression coefficients are known, one can estimate the predicted 
dependent variables, errors/residuals, R–square, etc.  If X does not vary, 
then the series cannot have any role in explaining the variation in Y.  The 
number of unknowns equals the number of regression coefficients. 
12.1.D 
ASSUMPTION 4: NOT ALL THE VALUES OF ANY ONE 
INDEPENDENT SERIES CAN BE THE SAME 
A model uses the effect of variation in X to explain variation in Y.  If X 
does not vary, then the series cannot have any role in explaining the 
variation in Y. 
Note that the formulas for estimating the regression coefficients — the 
betas — use the “squared deviations from mean” in the denominator of 
the formula.  If the X values do not vary then all the values equal the 
mean implying that the “squared deviations from mean” is zero.  This will 

Chapter 12: Regression 
215 
make the regression coefficient indeterminate because the denominator of 
the formula equals zero. 
12.1.E 
ASSUMPTION 5: 
THE RESIDUAL OR DISTURBANCE 
ERROR TERMS FOLLOW SEVERAL RULES 
This is the most important assumption, and most diagnostic tests are 
checking for the observance of this assumption.  In several textbooks, you 
will find this assumption broken into parts, but I prefer to list the rules of 
Assumption 5: 
Assumption 5a: The mean/average or expected value of the disturbance 
equals zero 
If not, then you know that the model has a systemic bias, which makes it 
inaccurate, especially because one does not typically know what is causing 
the bias. 
Assumption 5b: The disturbance terms all have the same variance 
This assumption is also called homoskedasticity.  Given that the expected 
value of any disturbance equals zero, if one disturbance has a higher 
variance than the other one, it implies that the observation underlying 
this high variance should be given less importance because its relative 
accuracy is suspect.  (This is the reason that weighted regression is used 
to correct for the nonconformity with this rule.)

Assumption 5c: A disturbance term for one observation should have no 
relation with the disturbance terms for other observations or with any of 
the independent variables 
The disturbance term must be truly random — one should not be able to 
predict or guess the value of any disturbance term given any of the 
information on the model data.  The disturbance term is also called the 
error term.  This error is assumed random.  If this is not the case, then 
your model may have failed to capture all the underlying independent 
variables, incorrectly measured independent variables, or have correlation 
between successive observations in a series Sorted by one of the 
independent variables.   
Typically, Time Series data series suffers from the problem of disturbance 
terms being related to the values of previous periods.  It is for this reason 
that times series analysis requires special data manipulation procedures 
prior to creating any prediction model. 
Assumption 5d: There is no specification bias 
This is the most crucial assumption because a mistake in specifying the 
equation for regression is the responsibility of the statistician.  One 
cannot blame the nature of the data for this problem.  One type of 
specification bias is the use of an incorrect functional form.  For example, 
you have a specification bias if you use a linear function when a 
logarithmic or exponential function should be used.   
The other type of specification bias is when the model does not include a 
relevant data series.  This is the most common type of error of oversight 
by because of the incorrect habit in creating a hypothesis only after 
looking at the available data.  This approach may result in the exclusion 
of an important series that may not be in the available data set.   

Chapter 12: Regression 
217 
Remember that a regression is based on a hypothesis — you always define 
the hypothesis first.  After that, look for data that can capture all of the 
variables in the hypothesis.  If you do not find the data to represent an 
important factor, then you should not use regression analysis.  Another 
bad habit is the dropping of variables from a model if the coefficient is 
seen to have no impact on the dependent series.  It is better to have an 
irrelevant or excess series, then to drop a relevant series.  In fact, the 
result that a factor has no impact on the dependent series often provides 
compelling insight. 
Assumption 5e: The disturbance terms have a Normal Density Function 
The use of the F-test for validating the model and the T-tests for 
validating individual coefficients is predicated on the presumption that 
the disturbance terms follow a Normal Density Function. 
12.1.F 
ASSUMPTION 6: THERE ARE NO STRONG LINEAR 
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES 
If the relationships are strong, then the regression estimation will not be 
able to isolate the impact of each independent series.  Related to this is 
another rule: there should be no endogenity in the model.  This means 
that none of the independent variables should be dependent on other 
variables.  An independent series should not be a function of another 
independent series. 
Every estimate in a regression is not only a point estimate of the 
parameter of the expected value of the parameter.  The regression 
estimates the expected value (mean) of the parameter, its variance, and 
its Density Function (the assumption of normality provides the shape of 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
218 
the Density Function).  The mean and standard error are estimated by the 
model.  There is a pair of such estimates for each coefficient (each BETA), 
each disturbance term, and each predicted value of the dependent series. 
Note: The dependent series is that whose values you are trying to predict 
(or whose dependence on the independent variables is being studied).  It is 
also referred to as the “Explained” or “Endogenous” series, or as the 
“Regressand.” 
The independent variables are used to explain the values of the dependent 
series.  The values of the independent variables are not being 
explained/determined by the model — thus, they are “independent” of the 
model.  The independent variables are also called “Explanatory” or 
“Exogenous” variables.  They are also referred to as “Regressors.”

The statistical Add-In provided with Excel has many 
limitations— it does only a few procedures, has bugs, and cannot handle 
complex data.  (For example, it cannot do a regression if there are any 
missing values.)  Fortunately, some other companies have created Add-Ins 
that provides comprehensive statistics capabilities.  Links to such Add-Ins

 OTHER TOOLS FOR STATISTICS 
This chapter briefly touches on the following topics: 
— SAMPLING ANALYSIS 
— RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION 
— TIME SERIES 
— EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING, MOVING AVERAGE ANALYSIS 
This chapter requires the Analysis ToolPak Add-Ins; chapter 9 
shows how to learn how to launch the Add-Ins. 
13.1 
SAMPLING ANALYSIS 
This tool creates a sample from a population by treating the input range 
as a population.  You can use a representative sample when the 
population is too large to process or chart.  You can also create a sample 
that contains only values fro a particular part of a cycle if you believe that 
the input data is periodic Excel draws samples from the first column, then 
the second column, and so on. 
Access the feature through the menu path TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS and 
choose the procedure “Sampling.”   

Chapter 13: Other Tools for Statistics 
229 
Figure 157:  Sampling 
 
Sampling Method: choose Periodic or Random to indicate the sampling 
interval you want. 
Period: Enter the periodic interval at which you want sampling to take 
place.  The interval value in the input range and every period’s value 
thereafter are copied to the output column. 
Random & Number of Samples: Number of random values you desire in 
the output column.  Excel draws each value from a random position in the 
input range.  (Consequently, a value may be drawn more than once.) 
Output Range: Data is written in a single column below the cell.  
Note: 
If you selected Periodic, the number of values in the output table is 
equal to the number of values in the input range, divided by the 
sampling rate.  If you selected Random, the number of values in the 
output table is equal to the number of samples.

230 
13.2 
RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION 
This tool fills a range with independent random numbers drawn from one 
of several Density Functions. 
You can characterize a population with a Probability Density Function. 
Select the option TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS34 and choose the procedure 
“Random Number Generation.” 
Number of Variables: Number of columns of values you want in the output 
table.  If you do not enter a number, all columns in the output will be 
filled.   
Figure 158:  Random Number Generator

data analysis.  Refer to section 41.4. 

Chapter 13: Other Tools for Statistics 
231 
Number of Random Numbers: Number of data points you want to see.  
Each point appears in a row of the output table.  If you do not enter a 
number, all rows in the output range will be filled. 
Distribution: choose the Density Function for defining the criterion for the 
Random Number generation. 
Parameters: The base parameters for the generation process using the 
selected Density Function.

Uniform 
This distributing is characterized by lower and upper bounds.  
Excel draws variables from all values in the range.  The 
probability of drawing a value is equal for all values in the range. 
13.3 
TIME SERIES 
Exponential Smoothing 
This tool and its formula predict a value based on the forecast for the 
prior period, adjusted for the error in that prior forecast.  The tool uses 
the smoothing constant alpha, the magnitude of which determines how 
strongly forecasts respond to errors in the prior forecast. 
Using the mouse, select the menu path TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS35 and 
choose the procedure “Exponential Smoothing.” 
Damping: The factor you want to use as the exponential smoothing 
constant.  The damping factor is a corrective factor that minimizes the 
instability of data collected across a population. 
The default value for the damping factor is 0.3.  Values of 0.2 to 0.3 are 
reasonable smoothing constants.  These values indicate that the current 
forecast should be adjusted 20 to 30 percent for error in the prior forecast. 
                                         
35 If you do not see this option, then use TOOLS / ADD-INS to activate the Add-In for 
data analysis.  Refer to section 41.4. 

Statistical Analysis with Excel 
234 
Larger constants yield a faster response but can produce erratic 
projections.  Smaller constants can result in long lags for forecast values. 
Figure 166:  Exponential Smoothing 
 
Data Requirement: A single column or row with four or more cells with 
valid data. 
Output: The output range must be on the same worksheet as the data in 
the input range.  Enter the range reference for the upper— left cell of the 
output table (for example, “AD4”).  You can obtain a column of Standard 
Errors by selecting the option “Standard Errors.”  If you want to chart the 
procedure's output — the actual values and forecasts –, select the option 
“Chart Output.”   
Moving Average analysis 
This tool projects values in the forecast period based on “the average 
value of the series over a specific number of preceding periods.”  A moving 
average provides trend information that a simple average of all historical 
data would mask. 

Chapter 13: Other Tools for Statistics 
235 
Select the option TOOLS/DATA ANALYSIS36 and choose the procedure 
“Moving Average.” 
Interval: Number of values you want to include in the moving average.  
The default is three.

Data Requirement: A single column or row with four or more cells with 
valid data. 
Output: The output range must be on the same worksheet as the data in 
the input range.  Enter the range reference for the upper–left cell of the 
output table (for example, “AD4”).  You can obtain a column of Standard 
Errors by selecting the option “Standard Errors.”  If you want to chart the 
procedure's output — the actual values and forecasts –, select the option

— ADDING CONSTRAINTS 
— OPTIONS 
14.1 
DEFINING THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION (CHOOSING 
THE OPTIMIZATION CRITERION) 
The problem of constrained optimization: 
For example, 
Maximize/Minimize /other (over the choice parameters Xc …)   Y = f(X1, X2 …) 
Subject to the inequality constraints:- 
C1 = ….C2 >=…      ,  C3 <= … 
 

Chapter 14: The Solver Tool for Constrained Optimization 
239 
The Add-In “Solver” can solve such models.  In the Solver dialog (user-
input form), the options equate with the function above.  The “mapping” of 
the dialog to different parts of the optimization function is shown in the 
next table.

The constraints C1, C2, … 
The Solver permits constraints of inequality.  This makes the solver 
extremely powerful. 
Choose the menu option TOOLS/ADD-INS.  Choose the Add-In “Solver” as 
shown in Figure 168.  Execute the dialog by clicking on the button OK. 
Figure 168:  Selecting the Solver Add-In

You have activated the “Analysis ToolPak.”  If you go to the menu 
TOOLS, you will see the option “SOLVER“— this option was not there 
before you accessed the Add-In.  Please define a sample problem and try it 
on an Excel workbook37. 
Access the feature through the menu path TOOLS/SOLVER.  The dialog 
shown in Figure 169 opens.  The “Target Cell” contains the formula for 
the function you are attempting to optimize. 
The “Equal to” area is where you choose the optimization criterion– 
— Maximization (Max) 
— Minimization (Min) 
                                         
37 I do not supply the sample data for most of the examples in chapter 42 to chapter 46.  
My experience is that many readers glaze over the examples and do not go through 
the difficult step of drawing inferences from a result if the sample data results are 
the same as those in the examples in the book. 

Chapter 14: The Solver Tool for Constrained Optimization 
241

The choice parameters are the numbers the algorithm plays around with 
to find the max/min. 
You have to tell Excel about the cells that contain these parameters.  One 
can do it manually, or, an easier option is to click on the button “Guess.” 
Excel automatically chooses all the cell references for use in the formula 
in J10 (the target cell/objective function).  This is illustrated in Figure 
170.

ADDING CONSTRAINTS 
The optimization function has been defined, as have the “choice 
parameters.”  At this stage, you have to add the constraints. 
Click on the button “Add” and write in a constraint as shown in Figure 
171. 
Figure 171:  The first constraint 
 
After defining the first constraint, click on the button “Add” (see Figure 
171.)  Write the second constraint— see Figure 172.

Continue with constraint definitions.  After defining the last constraint, 
execute the dialog by clicking on the button OK (see Figure 172).

The constraints are shown in the area “Subject to the Constraints” as 
shown in Figure 173.

CHOOSING ALGORITHM OPTIONS 
You need to choose the options for the analysis.  So, click on the button 
“Options.”  The dialog shown in Figure 174 opens.

You may want to increase the iterations to 10,000.  If you want to relax 
the requirements for preciseness, increase the value of “Precision” by 
removing some post-decimal zeros. 
“Save Model” is used to save each optimization model.  You can define 
several optimization problems in one workbook.  The other options are 
beyond the scope of this book.  Click on the button “Continue.”
