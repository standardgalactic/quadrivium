Special Methods: Hashing and Equality
Recall that for an object to be usable in a mapping type
à key in a dictionary
à element of a set
it must be hashable
à implement __hash__
à should also implement __eq__
If __eq__ is implemented, __hash__ is implicitly set to None unless __hash__ is implemented
By default, when an override is not specified:
__hash__ uses id of object
(but only do so for immutable objects)
__eq__ uses identity comparison (is)
