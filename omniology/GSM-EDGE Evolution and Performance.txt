GSM Standardization History
Guillaume S´ebire
1.1
Introduction
GSM, the Global System for Mobile communications, owes its worldwide success to the
continued progressive and backward-compatible evolution of its open industry standard and
to visionary yet simple ideas such as global roaming – enabling, thanks to a harmonized
spectrum, the use of a device with the same number outside its home network, multivendor
environment – enabling different vendors to implement with sufficien freedom compatible
products based on the same standard, SMS1 –enabling people to text each other, etc.
First aimed at providing mobile voice communications, GSM developed early on into
a rich system offering supplementary services and other data communications, well ahead
of the analogue systems then sporadically deployed in several regions of the world and
which were incompatible. GSM has been and is by far the most widely used and most
successful communications system of all time, enabling, at the time of writing, over four
billion subscribers [1] to communicate in just about every single country of the world, just
about everywhere (including airplanes) and with virtually everyone. The success of GSM is,
simply put, staggering. Of all the active digital mobile subscriptions worldwide, more than
80% are GSM [2].
This chapter relates the history of GSM standardization from the early 1980s to the late
2000s and lists the main features and functionalities that have gradually been introduced in
GSM specifications

History
Initially launched as a European initiative in 1982 by CEPT,2 the Groupe Sp´ecial Mobile
(Special Mobile Group) was tasked to develop a standard for mobile telephony across Europe
in the 900 MHz band. Five years later in 1987, the signature by thirteen countries3 of a
Memorandum of Understanding to develop a pan-European common cellular telephony system
in the 900 MHz band marked the officia birth of GSM, set for service launch in 1991. ETSI,
the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, created in 1988 by CEPT to handle all
telecommunication standardization activities, became in 1989 the sole entity responsible for
the GSM standard.
By 1990, the firs set of specifications GSM Phase 1, was frozen and published. By 1995,
GSM Phase 2 was available, followed a couple of years later by GSM Phase 2+ which also
introduced the concept of “yearly” release. The publication of the specification into backward-
compatible phases/releases has been a cornerstone of the evolution of the GSM standard and
a model for future standards. It has ensured the availability in the specification of a same
phase/release of a consistent set of services, functionalities and features on both network and
terminal sides and the inherent compatibility between equipment of different phases/releases.
Since the firs “release” in Phase 2+, known as Release 96 (or R96), nine others have been
published (or are being developed): R97, R98, R99, Release 2000 later renamed Rel-4, Rel-5,
Rel-6, Rel-7, Rel-8 and Rel-9. Release 9 is still in the making at the time of writing while
stage 1 requirements for Release 10 are being laid out. Release 4 marked the transfer of
GSM specification within the Third Generation Partnership Project or 3GPP in the year
2000.
3GPP was established in December 1998 as a collaboration project between ETSI (Europe),
ARIB4 (Japan), TTC5 (Japan), ATIS6 (North America), TTA7 (South Korea) and CCSA8
(China) to develop a global third generation mobile phone system specification that is UMTS
commonly referred to as “3G”. Though originating from GSM concepts and seen as part of
the GSM family, UMTS is not as such an evolution of GSM. It was developed as a new system
using GSM as a model. UMTS requires a new radio interface and the deployment of brand
new radio networks, and thus is not backward-compatible with GSM – a UMTS phone cannot
work in a GSM system nor can a GSM phone work in a UMTS system. The UMTS core
network and architecture, however, though requiring new IP-based interfaces, were largely
based on the GSM core network and architecture.
In the following sub-sections, non-exhaustive lists of services, features and functionalities
characterizing each GSM phase/release are provided.

1.3
Phase 1
GSM Phase 1 contains the following items:
r Basic telephony using full-rate speech codec (FR) at 13 kbit/s [3] with a speech quality
comparable to that of POTS9 wireline.
r Emergency calls using a single number (“112”) even if the SIM10 is not present or the
PIN11 is not entered. The growing deployment of GSM outside Europe led to the introduc-
tion in Phase 2+ (R96) of additional numbers (in the SIM) to be regarded as emergency
numbers.
r Support for multiple data services (up to 9.6 kbit/s) allowing, for example interconnection
with ISDN,12 modem connection through PSTN.13
r Security through authentication and confidentialit in order to protect operators and sub-
scribers against malicious actions by third parties. Authentication to verify and confir
a
subscriber’s identity. Confidentialit to preserve the privacy of a given piece of information
[4]. See Chapter 4 for more details on the evolution of GSM security.
r Short message service (SMS) either point-to-point or using cell broadcast [5,6].
r Supplementary services pertaining to call barring and call forwarding such as barring of
all incoming calls, barring of incoming calls when roaming outside the home network, call
forwarding on no reply, call forwarding on mobile subscriber busy, etc.
r Support for facsimile (fax) communications (Group 3: the most widely used) [7,8].
1.4
Phase 2
GSM Phase 2 contains the following items:
r Half-rate speech codec (HR) at 5.6 kbit/s allowing a higher maximum number of voice users
compared to FR speech, at the expense of speech quality [9].
r Enhanced Full-Rate speech codec (EFR) at 12.2 kbit/s. EFR provides a considerable speech
quality improvement over FR [10].
r Half-rate data services allowing a higher maximum number of data users.
r SMS enhancements such as SMS concatenation, replacement.
r Supplementary services such as enhancements to call barring and forwarding, calling line
identificatio presentation and restriction, multiparty calls, etc.
r Fax enhancements.
r Support of GSM in the 1800 MHz band that is DCS14 1800 as well as interworking between
GSM 900 and DCS 1800, and multi-band operation by a single operator.

GSM/EDGE
1.5
Phase 2+
1.5.1
Phase 2+, R96
Release 96 contains the following items:
r Data services at 14.4 kbit/s.
r High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD) allowing the use of multiple 9.6 kbit/s or
14.4 kbit/s channels in one direction for considerably faster data transfers. HSCSD offers
data rates up to 38.4 kbit/s (four times 9.6 kbit/s) or 57.6 kbit/s (four times 14.4 kbit/s) for
Type 1 mobile stations that is mobile stations not required to transmit and receive at the
same time [11].
r ASCI (Advanced Speech Call Items) Phase 1 for GSM railway systems (GSM-R) containing
for example Voice Broadcast Service (VBS) calls supporting one talker and several listeners
and Voice Group Call Service (VGCS) allowing calls supporting several talkers and listeners
[12,13].
r CAMEL (Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic) Phase 1. CAMEL
enables the definitio of services on top of existing GSM services such as allowing using
the same phone number when roaming outside one’s home network. CAMEL Phase 1 offers
call control related functionalities.
r SIM Application Toolkit (SIM ATK) which provides standardized means for applications
(e.g. banking, weather) residing on the SIM to interact proactively with the mobile station.
r Support of additional call set-up MMI procedures allowing emergency calls to be placed
with emergency numbers stored in the SIM thus catering for the expansion of GSM in
countries using other numbers than “112” for emergencies.
1.5.2
Phase 2+, R97
Release 97 contains the following items:
r GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) allowing packet-switched data connections down to
the GSM radio interface thus providing a more efficien use of network and radio resources
compared to circuit-switched data. Resources are assigned when data are transmitted, and
released otherwise thus creating packet transmissions. Four coding schemes, CS-1 to CS-4
using GMSK15 modulation, and link adaptation allow adaption of the channel coding to
the channel conditions thus enabling an efficien use of radio resources. Data rates up to
20 kbit/s per time slot per direction are possible [13].
r GPRS encryption using the GPRS-A5 algorithm (GEA16). See Chapter 4 for more details
on the evolution of GSM security.
r Security mechanisms for SIM ATK.
r ASCI Phase 2.
r CAMEL Phase 2.
15 GMSK: Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying.
16 GEA: GPRS Encryption Algorithm.

1.5.3
Phase 2+, R98
Release 98 contains the following items:
r AMR (Adaptive Multi-Rate speech codec): Definitio
of mechanisms to support AMR
speech (narrow-band or AMR-NB) in GSM enabling the adaptation of the speech codec
to the link quality and/or capacity requirements by means of an optimized link and codec
adaptation. To this end, eight codec modes are defined 4.75, 5.15, 5.9, 6.7, 7.4, 7.95,
10.2 and 12.2 kbit/s.17 The higher the bitrate, the higher the source coding and the weaker
the channel coding. In GSM, AMR channel coding is define
for GMSK full-rate chan-
nels (TCH/AFS) for all codec modes and for GMSK half-rate channels (TCH/AHS) for
4.75 kbit/s to 7.95 kbit/s codec modes [15]. AMR has also been define
as the default
speech codec for UMTS.
r Location Services (LCS) in CS Domain: Definitio
of mechanisms to support location
technologies in GSM based on cell identity (or Cell ID), E-OTD,18 TOA19 and A-GPS.20
LCS supports both mobile station-assisted positioning (the terminal takes the measurements
while the network calculates the position) and mobile station-based positioning (the mobile
station both takes the measurements and calculates the position).
r Support of GSM/GPRS in the 1900 MHz band (PCS 1900).
1.5.4
Phase 2+, R99
Release 99 contains the following items:
r EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution): EDGE was specifie as a global evo-
lution path for GSM operators, and, in the US, TDMA operators. Through the introduc-
tion of the 8-PSK21 modulation on the GSM air interface for both packet-switched data
(EGPRS – Enhanced GPRS) and circuit-switched data (ECSD – Enhanced CSD), EDGE
boosts peak and average data rates as well as network capacity. EGPRS provides data rates
up to 59.2 kbit/s per time slot per direction (i.e. up to 473.6 kbit/s per 200kHz carrier),
supports incremental redundancy (Hybrid Type II ARQ22), introduces a wide range of mod-
ulation and coding schemes using GMSK and 8-PSK modulations, as well as new link
quality measurement quantities, the combination of which allows accurate link adaptation
in varying channel conditions [16]. ECSD provides data rates up to 43.2 kbit/s per time slot,
hence significantl reducing the need to allocate multiple time slots to increase data rates for
CS data and thus addressing a main issue inherent to HSCSD: capacity. ECSD also allows
fast power control.
r DTM (Dual Transfer Mode): Definitio
of mechanisms to support parallel CS and PS
connections on the same carrier for a given mobile station, hence significantl reducing the
17 AMR 12.2 speech codec is compatible with EFR.
18 E-OTD: Enhanced-Observed Time Difference.
19 TOA: Time Of Arrival.
20 A-GPS: Assisted GPS.
21 8-PSK: Octal Phase Shift Keying.
22 ARQ: Automated Repeat reQuest.

GSM/EDGE
complexity otherwise implied for class A mobile stations (where the CS and PS connections
are independent) [17]. A DTM mobile station is hence referred to as a simple Class A mobile
station. DTM multislot classes 1, 5 and 9 are supported [18].
r Enhanced Measurement Reporting: Definitio
of mechanisms allowing the reporting of
more than six neighbor cells for mobility purpose thus providing benefit for multiband
and/or multisystem scenarios (e.g. GSM and UMTS).
r GSM/UTRAN23 Interworking: Definitio of mechanisms to support interworking (mobility)
between GSM and UMTS. Handover from GSM to UMTS is specifie in the CS domain,
and cell re-selection otherwise.
r Support of A5/3 and GEA3: Definitio of the support in GSM of the KASUMI f8 algorithm
introduced in UMTS, using a ciphering key of 64 bits. See Chapter 4 for more details on the
evolution of GSM security.
r GSM 450 band: Uplink 450.4–457.6 MHz and Downlink 460.4–467.6 MHz (GSM400).
r GSM 480 band: Uplink 478.8–486 MHz and Downlink 488.8–496 MHz (GSM400).
r GSM 850 band: Uplink 824–849 MHz and Downlink 869–894 MHz (GSM850).
1.5.5
Phase 2+, Rel-4
Release 4 contains the following items:
r NACC (Network Assisted Cell Change): definitio
of mechanisms allowing the mobile
station to notify the cell to which it will reselect (Cell Change Notification) and the network
to provide in turn system information pertaining to this cell thereby reducing the access time
in this cell.
r Delayed Downlink TBF Release/Extended Uplink TBF mode: Definitio of mechanisms
maintaining a layer 2 link (TBF24) in a given direction between a mobile station and the
network when no data is exchanged between the mobile station and the network on this TBF,
hence avoiding TBF re-establishment when new data is incoming, thus improving latency
and reducing signaling.
r DTM Multislot Class 11 [19].
r Extended DTM Multislot Class: allowing the support of half-rate PDCH (Packet Data
Channel) together with full-rate PDCH(s) in DTM.
r Gb over IP: Definitio
of IP transport over the Gb interface between the BSC25 and the
SGSN,26 as an alternative to frame relay.
r GERAN/UTRAN Interworking additions: Definitio of interworking between GERAN and
UTRAN low chip-rate TDD.27
23 UTRAN: UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network.
24 TBF: Temporary Block Flow.
25 BSC: Base Station Controller.
26 SGSN: Serving GPRS Support Node.
27 TDD: Time Division Duplex.

r Dynamic ARFCN Mapping: Definitio
of mechanisms to allow dynamic mapping of
ARFCN (Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number) to different bands hence overriding
the fi ed ARFCN numbering. An ARFCN identifie a GSM carrier (200 kHz).
r GSM 750 band: Downlink 747–762 MHz and Uplink 777–792 MHz (GSM700).
1.5.6
Phase 2+, Rel-5
Release 5 contains the following items:
r Support of High Multislot Classes for (E)GPRS.
r GERAN Iu mode: Definitio of architecture and mechanisms to connect the GSM/EDGE
Radio Access Network to the same Core Network as UTRAN via the Iu interface (Iu-ps
and Iu-cs). The Iur-g interface was also define allowing the connection and exchange of
control-plane information between two BSCs or between a BSC and an RNC, similar to the
Iu-r interface in UTRAN [20].
r Wideband AMR (AMR-WB): Definitio

12.65, 15.85 and 23.85 kbit/s)28 are supported through the use of 8-PSK full-rate channels
(O-TCH/WFS). Codec modes up to and including 12.65 kbit/s are supported through the
use of GMSK full-rate channels (TCH/WFS) and 8-PSK half-rate channels (O-TCH/WHS).
There is no support for GMSK half-rate channels.

of Enhanced Power Control allowing faster
Power Control for GMSK and 8-PSK channels, through the use of power control (and
reporting) on every SACCH30 block (occurring every 120 ms) instead of every SACCH

r eNACC (External NACC): Definitio
of mechanisms to support external NACC, that is
NACC between two BSCs, through the introduction of RIM (RAN Information Manage-
ment) procedures allowing the exchange of information (e.g. system information) between
two BSCs [22].

r GAN (Generic Access Network): Definitio of mechanisms and architecture allowing access
to GSM services (via the A and Gb interfaces) through an internet access (using e.g. Wireless
LAN, BlueTooth) by tunneling non-access stratum protocols between the network and the
mobile station. This allows for example access to GSM outside GSM radio coverage [28].
r DARP Phase 1 (Downlink Advance Receiver Performance Phase 1): Improvements of the
reception performance of the mobile station through the use of single antenna interference
cancellation (SAIC).
r ACCH Enhancements: Definitio of mechanisms to increase the robustness of FACCH33

r Definitio of A5/4 and GEA4: Definitio of the support in GSM of the KASUMI f8 algorithm
using a 128-bit encryption key, thus aligning the security level of all 3GPP radio access

Phase 2+, Rel-7
Release 7 contains the following items:
r GSM Onboard Aircrafts: Not part of 3GPP specification the work to defin GSMOBA,36
initiated by a mandate of the European Commission, spanned 3GPP Releases 6 and 7 time-
frames. To ensure compliance with 3GPP requirements and essentially compatibility with
legacy GSM terminals, 3GPP involvement was necessary. It consisted of 3GPP reviewing
and guiding the design of the GSMOBA system which was under the responsibility of
the ETSI GSMOBA and CEPT ECC PT SE7 groups. The airborne GSM system provides
GSM/GPRS connectivity in an aircraft cabin during cruise fligh (above 3000 meters) en-
abling phone calls, SMS, and other data exchange, for example e-mail. It operates in the
1800 MHz band and ensures, by means of a Network Control Unit (NCU) installed in the
cabin, that any harmful interference to a terrestrial mobile network is prevented. To this
end, the NCU transmits on at least the GSM400, GSM900, DCS1800 and UMTS bands, a
wideband noise signal of which the power can be adjusted as a function of the altitude of the
aircraft. GSM coverage in the cabin is provided by an onboard GSM BTS (OBTS) which is
further connected by means of a satellite link to the terrestrial mobile network. The OBTS
makes use of uplink power control to limit the transmit power of terminals to its lowest
specifie level that is 0dBm [34,35].
r EGPRS2: Definitio of mechanisms to support (combinations of) higher order modulations
(16QAM, 32QAM), turbo coding and higher modulation symbol rate to boost data rates up
to twice those of EGPRS. Two levels, EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B, were specifie in both
uplink and downlink directions.

increased compared to unacknowledged mode while maintaining a delay
budget unlike the RLC acknowledged mode. It was firs introduced in Release 6 for MBMS,
and expanded in Release 7 to other applications.

of data to a mobile station over two simultaneous independent downlink carriers (200 kHz),
hence enabling higher data rates compared to EGPRS.

station receiver diversity (MSRD), DARP Phase 2 improves the reception of a transmitted
signal by using two antennas to enable diversity techniques between the two received signals.
r PS Handover between GAN and GERAN and GAN and UTRAN.
r DTM Handover: Definitio of mechanisms to support concurrent handovers of CS and PS
resources in DTM [36,37].

Introduction
GSM, the world’s most successful and widely deployed communications technology of all
times recording over four billion subscribers, reached another evolution milestone with the
completion of the 3GPP Release 7 specifications
Making the internet truly mobile. While mobility has revolutionized the internet and enabled
access where the internet had never been before, it has, at the same time, brought about
constraints of coverage, data rates, latency and spectrum efficien y.1 When 3GPP laid the
foundation for evolving EGPRS further, key requirements were thus define [1]:
r at least 50% improvement in coverage and spectrum efficien y;
r at least double the data rates in both uplink (terminal to network) and downlink (network to
terminal) reaching one Mbit/s and above;
r at most halve the round-trip time between a terminal and the network (∼150 ms).
These requirements paved the way for carefully studying, selecting and specifying techniques,
such as higher order modulations, turbo-coding, antenna diversity, and associated features
which individually or combined achieve the goals above: EGPRS2, Downlink Dual Carrier
and Mobile Station Receiver Diversity(DARP Phase 2) and Latency Reductions.
Leveraging operators’ investments, enabling new technologies. Massive investments have
been made to deploy EGPRS in GSM networks across the globe, thereby making it the most
widely used cellular packet data technology. In addition, besides a large base of installed
GSM (radio network) infrastructure worldwide, green-fiel deployments, network expansions
1 How efficien the usage of the spectrum is: the more the amount of bits that can be sent in a given time in a given
frequency allocation, the better.

Minimizing technology gaps and raising the minimum user experience.
and modernization are also continuously bringing the latest generation hardware to the field
Underwriting these investments is the full exploitation of these pieces of equipment and their
capabilities.
Omnipresent in most countries (and getting there rapidly in for example India, China or
Africa), GSM is the technology providing ubiquitous access to voice and data services. Being
able to use mobile services anywhere is taken for granted; it is the result of an evolution that
is continuously raising the minimum user experience. Moreover with the deployment of, for
example HSPA and with the forthcoming LTE (Rel-8), GSM consistently acts as the underlying
technology; GSM coverage typically reaches far beyond any other overlay technologies.
GSM hence provides a nurturing base for other technologies to grow and interworking with
GSM becomes thus a de facto requirement for such technologies to commercially take off.
Interworking ensures service continuity and availability.
Minimizing through the EGPRS evolution the technology gap between GSM and other
technologies, as illustrated in Figure 2.1,2 thus serves not only the competitiveness of GSM
but also that of other technologies that it works with, while further improving the overall user
experience.
This chapter describes the features making up the EGPRS Evolution as specifie in 3GPP
Release 7: EGPRS2, Downlink Dual Carrier, Mobile Station Receiver Diversity and Latency
Reductions.

EGPRS2
2.2.1
Introduction
Specifie
in 3GPP Release 99 and designed to boost GPRS peak data rates, throughput,
coverage and capacity, EGPRS features two key elements: 8-PSK modulation tripling peak

data rates compared to GMSK modulation, and incremental redundancy (Type II Hybrid ARQ)
yielding significantl better RLC (layer 2) performance than GPRS’ Type I ARQ by exploiting
erroneous transmissions otherwise lost in the case of GPRS.
Though very similar, EGPRS and GPRS RLC protocols are, due to incremental redundancy,
incompatible. EGPRS consists of nine modulation and coding schemes, MCS-1 to MCS-9,
covering a wide range of channel conditions and arranged in four families define by payload;
A, B, C and A with padding. EGPRS MCSs offers data rates ranging from 8.8 kbit/s to
59.2 kbit/s per time slot (or up to 473.6 kbit/s per carrier). MCS-1 to MCS-4 use GMSK
modulation and are the peers of GPRS CS1 to CS4 but, as opposed to these, support incremental
redundancy. MCS-5 to MCS-9 use 8-PSK modulation.
EGPRS2, specifie in 3GPP Release 7, complements EGPRS and is compatible with it.
Higher order modulations, turbo codes and a higher modulating symbol rate are the key
additional building blocks that characterize EGPRS2 compared to EGPRS. EGPRS2 consists
of two separate levels both in uplink and in downlink: EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B. EGPRS2
data rates range from 22.4 kbit/s up to 118.4 kbit/s per time slot.
In Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, an overview of the two levels of EGPRS2 is given, with each
section split between downlink and uplink and with the characteristics of the new modulation
and coding schemes summarized in Tables 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4. Then in Section 2.2.4, more
detail is provided about the new modulations and the new symbol rate, including a descrip-
tion of the operations that defin a modulation scheme such as the bit to symbol mapping,
symbol rotation and transmit pulse shaping. In Section 2.2.5, the error correction coding in
EGPRS2 is described, that is the turbo coding and the convolutional coding. This section also
covers the puncturing schemes used, the interleaving and the bit swapping operations. Finally,
Section 2.2.6 addresses link adaptation, including a description of the link adaptation families
supported by EGPRS2.
2.2.2

used alongside convolutional coding. Its data rates range from 22.4 kbit/s to 96.4 kbit/s per
time slot in downlink and from 44.8 to 76.8 kbit/s per time slot in uplink.

EGPRS2-B Uplink
In EGPRS2-B Uplink, eight modulation and coding schemes (UBS-5 to UBS-12) are define
in addition to the four GMSK modulated coding schemes of EGPRS (MCS-1 to MCS-4). The
main attributes of UBS-5 to UBS-12 are summarized in Table 2.4.
2.2.4
Modulation and Pulse Shaping
2.2.4.1
Introduction
EGPRS2 introduces a number of additions compared to EGPRS, especially in the number
of modulations schemes supported.3 Five new modulation schemes are defined 16QAM and
32QAM at the symbol rate of 270.8 ksymb/s and QPSK, 16QAM and 32QAM at the higher
symbol rate of 325 ksymb/s [12]. This is in addition to GMSK and 8-PSK at the legacy symbol
rate of 270.8 ksymb/s.
Each modulation scheme represents a different trade-off between bandwidth efficien y and
robustness to noise and collectively they provide a high degree of fl xibility to the physical
layer of EGPRS2 to adapt to a wide range of channel conditions. For example, in areas such as
indoors or at the cell border, the data rates might benefi more from the support of the QPSK
modulation scheme, while benefi might be expected in areas close to the base station with the
support of 32QAM modulation. The raw bit rate of a modulation scheme is the bit rate at the
air interface. It provides an indication of the modulation scheme’s bandwidth efficien y and is
depicted in Table 2.5 for each of the modulation schemes supported by EGPRS and EGPRS2.
In the case of EGPRS2, a wide range of raw bit rates are supported which extend up to twice
the maximum of EGPRS.
To facilitate the early adoption of the EGPRS2 feature by the telecommunications industry,
the modulation schemes have been divided into two levels: EGPRS2-A, which corresponds to
the schemes at the legacy symbol rate of 270.8 ksymb/s (the same symbol rate as EGPRS),
and EGPRS2-B, which corresponds to the schemes at the higher symbol rate of 325 ksymb/s.
3 A modulation scheme in this context is define as the combination of a modulation and its symbol rate.

Each has been specifie in 3GPP so that neither level is dependent on the other. This is to
allow a mobile vendor to implement EGPRS2-A in a firs phase and EGPRS2-B in a later
second phase. A mobile indicates its level of support during the establishment phase of a data
connection with the help of two indicator bits in the MS Radio Access Capability Information
Element [3]. These bits are used to signal to the network the support of either EGPRS2-A,
both EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B, or neither EGPRS2-A nor EGPRS2-B. Separate indicator
bits are define for uplink and downlink.
Each modulation scheme in EGPRS2 can be described by the three operations which are
depicted in Figure 2.2 [12].

2.5 is for 32QAM modulation. All constellation points are Gray coded with the exception of
the 32QAM constellation, where a perfect Gray coding was not possible. In this case, the
coding was optimized by simulation, with the non-Gray pairs being indicated in Figure 2.5.
2.2.4.3
Symbol Rotation
After the bit to symbol mapping, the modulating symbols are rotated to avoid transitions
through the origin. This minimizes the variations in the modulating signal which in turn
minimizes the linearity requirements of the amplifie (resulting in a more efficien amplifier as
well as maximizing the power capability of the respective modulation and hence its coverage.
The impact of rotation can be seen in Figures 2.6 and 2.7, where transitions between the
constellation points of 16QAM modulation are shown firs without rotation (Figure 2.6) and
then with rotation applied (Figure 2.7). For the QPSK and QAM modulation schemes, the

variations in the modulating signal are minimized when the modulating symbols are rotated
at a rate of ϕ radians per symbol, where ϕ is PI/4 or a multiple thereof. Table 2.6 shows the
rotation angle together with the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) of each of the modulating
signals of EGPRS and EGPRS2 (where PAR is often used to describe a modulating signal’s
variation). Unique rotation angles have been specifie for each of the modulations within each
symbol rate. This is to facilitate modulation detection in the mobile and network transceivers.
2.2.4.4
Pulse Shaping
Transmit pulse shaping is used to limit a modulating signal’s spectral bandwidth and in the
case of EGPRS2 two pulse shapes are supported: the Linearized Gaussian Minimum Shift
Keying (linearized GMSK) pulse and a pulse that has been optimized for the 325 ksymb/s
symbol rate for use in the uplink direction. This optimized pulse, referred to hereafter as the
“wide pulse”, has a wider bandwidth than the linearized GMSK pulse and results in a higher
throughput performance thanks to its reduced inter-symbol interference.
The spectral shape of both pulses is shown in Figure 2.8. One of the consequences of a
widened bandwidth is a lowered adjacent channel protection. For example, the wide pulse
in Figure 2.8 exhibits a 5.5 dB lower adjacent channel protection than the linearized GMSK
pulse. However, the level of interference introduced by a pulse shape not only depends on the
adjacent channel protection provided, but also on factors such as the proportion of time slots
supporting the EGPRS2 service or the pulse shape’s time slot occupancy. Interestingly, this
latter aspect can be expected to be lowered as a result of the higher throughput performance.
Moreover, any interference that might be introduced by the use of a wide pulse in uplink can
easily be suppressed by the use of interference cancellation algorithms that are commonly
deployed in dual antenna base stations. For the downlink, this latter aspect is less certain in
the mobile station where the suppression capability is restricted by the use of a single antenna
and limited baseband capability. For this reason, no wide pulse shape has been specifie yet
for the downlink (at the time of writing). Instead, a feasibility study into the performance of
a wide pulse and on its impact on legacy mobiles is ongoing in 3GPP, the results of which
are being collated in [2]. More information about the pulse shapes being considered in this
feasibility study can be found in Chapter 4 on Release 9 and beyond.

Coding and Puncturing
2.2.5.1
Introduction
EGPRS2 provides a wide range of modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) to be used by the
radio resource controller to adapt to the constantly changing channel. Their main attributes are
shown in Tables 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 (corresponding to EGPRS2-A Downlink and EGPRS2-A
Uplink and EGPRS2-B Downlink and EGPRS2-B Uplink respectively). In these tables, the
robustness of an MCS to noise is indicated by its modulation and symbol rate and its initial
code rate (the ratio of information bits to coded bits). The given peak bit rate is given at the
RLC layer, exclusive of all overheads up to and including the RLC layer.
Figure 2.9 depicts the error correction codes that are used in EGPRS2. In addition to the
convolutional codes used for the RLC/MAC header and for each of the RLC data blocks in
uplink, EGPRS2 introduces turbo codes for the RLC data blocks on the downlink and new
block codes for the Uplink State Flag (USF) [10].
2.2.5.2
Turbo Code
Turbo codes are well suited to the long block lengths associated with the new modulation
schemes of EGPRS2. The turbo encoder, a structure consisting of constituent encoders which
in parallel are separated with an interleaver, has been found to be particularly efficien at

constructing long block codes with good distance properties. At the receiving end, the turbo
decoder has a similar arrangement, with two constituent decoders for decoding the con-
stituent codes. Turbo decoders have been found to be very efficien at decoding turbo codes,
thanks to an iterative operation in which information is exchanged between the constituent
decoders.
The turbo encoder in EGPRS2 is depicted in Figure 2.10. It is the same turbo encoder
as in UTRAN: a parallel concatenated convolutional encoder, consisting of two recursive
convolutional encoders arranged in parallel and separated by a pseudo random interleaver.
Using the same encoder in this way allows a mobile vendor to exploit the already available
hardware within their dual-mode GSM/EDGE and UTRAN mobile platforms. Hence the turbo
code is only specifie on the downlink. Furthermore, as turbo codes are not very optimal for
short block lengths, they have been specifie only for the RLC data blocks.
2.2.5.3
Convolutional Code
The encoder for the RLC/MAC header and the RLC data blocks in uplink is depicted in Figure
2.11. It is the same encoder as in EGPRS, a 7-state feed-forward convolutional encoder,
operating at a 1/3 rate.
2.2.5.4
Puncturing and Incremental Redundancy
To achieve the desired code rate for each modulation and coding scheme (the initial code
rate in Tables 2.1 to 2.4), puncturing is applied to the convolutional or turbo encoded RLC
data blocks using one of two (or three4) puncturing schemes. The firs of these puncturing
schemes applies to the initial transmission of the block and the second (and third) scheme
4 Two puncturing schemes are needed when the initial code rate is less than or equal to 2/3 and three puncturing
schemes are needed when the initial code rate is greater than 2/3.

applies when the block is re-transmitted (assuming RLC acknowledged mode of operation).
Specifying the puncturing schemes in this way allows the initial transmission of an RLC block
to be combined with the firs (and/or second) retransmission of the block so that additional
redundancy is added leading to a reduction in the code rate. To achieve this, the puncturing
scheme optimization used the following criteria:
r decoding performance of the initial transmission;
r joint decoding performance between the initial transmission and the firs and second retrans-
mission;
r self-decodability of the retransmissions (this criterion is needed for the case of a lost initial
transmission for example due to an RLC header decode failure).
In the uplink, these criteria were met by a computer search, while in the downlink a modifie
UTRAN Rate Matching algorithm has been used [11] (where the modification relate to
improvements to the criteria on joint decoding performance and self-decodability).

2.2.5.5
Interleaving
The coded and punctured bits are mapped to the four bursts of a radio block after performing
interleaving and after carrying out a number of bit swapping operations.
Interleaving spreads the bits across the bursts so that the impact of channel disturbances is
averaged across all four bursts that comprise the radio block. For example, interleaving provides
time diversity when the bursts are subjected to a fading channel, or enhances the frequency
diversity benefit provided by a frequency hopping channel. Interleaving also spreads the bits
within a burst so that their strength relative to their proximity to the training sequence is
averaged over the duration of the burst.
Channel decoding performance improves with interleaving depth except for coding schemes
with little or no coding (very high code rates). For these schemes, the interleaving depth should
be as short as possible. In EGPRS2, two formulae for interleaving are specified Equation 2.1
is used when interleaving is performed over an interleaving depth of 4 bursts and Equation
2.2 is used for the very high code rate schemes where interleaving is performed over a depth
of one burst or one and a third bursts. One burst interleaving is performed for the RLC data
blocks of UBS-11, DBS-11 and DBS-12 (which have very high code rates and consist of
four RLC blocks per radio block), one and a third burst interleaving is performed for UAS-
11 and DAS-12 (which also have very high code rates and consist of three RLC blocks per
radio block) and four burst interleaving is performed for the RLC data in all the remaining
modulation and coding schemes and for the RLC header in all the modulation and coding
schemes.
The interleaving formulae are applied by firs reserving the bit positions in the burst for
the RLC/MAC header, the stealing bits and the USF (if applicable). These bits are placed
in the symbol positions closest to the training sequence where the symbol error probability
is lowest. The rectangular interleaving over four bursts (Equation 2.1) is then performed as
a single operation after concatenating all RLC blocks together. When interleaving over a
single burst or over one and a third bursts, each RLC data block is interleaved independently
(Equation 2.2).
Both interleaving formulae include one non-deterministic parameter, a. This parameter has
been optimized by simulation to maximize the interleaving performance for each modulation
and coding scheme.

2.2.5.6
Bit Swapping
The constellations for 16QAM and 32QAM have the property that not all the bit positions in
the symbol have equal bit error probability. A similar phenomenon exists also for 8-PSK of
EGPRS, where the most reliable bits are in the firs two positions (of three), while in the case
of 16QAM, the most reliable bits are in the firs two positions (of four) and in the case of
32QAM, the most reliable bits are in the firs and fourth positions (of fi e).
Already the RLC/MAC header, the stealing bits and the USF (downlink only) are mapped
to the symbol positions that are closest to the training sequence. This is where the symbol error
probability is lowest. This is further refine with bit swapping where the RLC/MAC header
bits are swapped with data bits so that the RLC/MAC header is mapped to the most reliable
bits closest to the training sequence. This is depicted in Figure 2.12 for the 32QAM modulated
schemes. Bit swapping brings benefit to incremental redundancy performance where a robust
RLC/MAC header is essential.
2.2.6
Link Adaptation
Link adaptation when in RLC acknowledged mode is supported by EGPRS and EGPRS2
through a concept of coding scheme families, whereby each family of coding schemes support
a common RLC data block size. Different code rates or bit rates within a family are then
obtained by transmitting different numbers of RLC data blocks within each radio block. For
example, Figure 2.13 depicts the families supported by EGPRS2-A Downlink. Four families
have been defined C, B padding2, B and A padding6, which are based on common RLC data
block sizes: 22, 82, 28 and 68 octets respectively. When performing link adaptation within
Family A, an RLC data block (be it an initial transmission or a retransmission) may be sent

blocks), where the quality of service and the prevailing channel conditions will dictate which
scheme to use. Figures 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 depict the coding scheme families for EGPRS2-B
Downlink, EGPRS2-A Uplink and EGPRS2-B Uplink respectively.
In many cases, a modulation and coding scheme in one family is re-used in another family
through the use of padding, whereby the modulation and coding scheme’s native RLC data

block size is effectively shortened by appending padding octets prior to encoding. For example,
in EGPRS2-B Downlink (Figure 2.14), DBS-6, DBS-8 and DBS-10 are native to Family A
(74 octets) but become members of Family A padding6 (68 octets) when 6 padding octets
are appended to each RLC data block. While inefficient this has the benefi of reducing the
number of modulation and coding schemes that need to be implemented.
The families of EGPRS2 have been designed to be compatible with EGPRS so that many
of the coding schemes of EGPRS can be adopted by EGPRS2. In some cases, a half RLC data

block size is supported such as with some of the GMSK modulated coding schemes (MCS-1
to MCS-3). In these cases, the block is split into two and transmitted over two radio blocks.
Coding scheme families give fl xibility to the Radio Resource Controller by allowing re-
transmissions to be sent using any coding scheme – as long as it is from the same family as
the coding scheme used to send the initial transmission. In the case of EGPRS2, incremental
redundancy is supported not only between retransmissions from the same modulation and cod-
ing scheme, but also between retransmissions from different modulation and coding schemes
from within the same family (provided they are neither split blocks or padded blocks).

In the uplink direction, from the mobile station to the network, two dual carrier allocation
schemes were considered where the two carriers were either independent or within a certain
frequency range. However, for neither of them could feasibility be shown. RF impacts such
as inter-modulation distortion, high peak to average power ratio and low power amplifie
efficien y resulting in power consumption issues implied a complex and non-cost efficien
design of the RF module at the transmitter side. Both carriers could indeed be spread over the
entire frequency band. As a result, the use of two simultaneous uplink carriers is not specified
In addition, the asymmetrical downlink-biased characteristic of popular packet data services
such as web browsing, download of emails or videos, leads to focusing on the downlink
direction. Further, to minimize complexity and costs, while complying with initial requirements
(see Section 2.1), multi-carriers eventually converged towards Downlink Dual Carrier for
EGPRS.
EGPRS providing a peak data rate of 59.2 kbit/s per time slot and 473.6 kbit/s per carrier
(i.e. 8 time slots), Downlink Dual Carrier can yield up to 947.2 kbit/s. In real network
conditions, an average throughput performance ranging from 100 kbit/s to 200 kbit/s is feasible
using four EGPRS time slots. With Downlink Dual Carrier, this figur can thus double up to
400 kbit/s. Combined with EGPRS2-B, the Downlink Dual Carrier can reach a peak data rate of
1.9 Mbit/s, and in real network conditions, up to about 600 kbit/s average throughput is expected
[19]. See Chapter 6 for further evaluation.
Downlink Dual Carrier allows the reuse of legacy network implementations since the
network is only required to distribute the user data on two legacy carriers. Hence the impact
on the network is limited to software upgrade. New mobile stations, however, are required that
support the reception of two independent carriers at the same time.
2.3.2
Functional Description
In this section a summary of the functional description of the Downlink Dual Carrier is
provided.
2.3.2.1
Basic Concept
Downlink Dual Carrier is based on the simultaneous reception, per TDMA frame, of two
independent GSM carriers belonging to the same serving cell, and is compatible with slow
frequency hopping. Note the term carrier is used hereafter such that for a network not using
slow frequency hopping, the carrier is fi ed and define
by the absolute radio frequency
channel number (ARFCN). In the case of a network employing slow frequency hopping,
the term carrier refers to the temporary GSM carrier in each TDMA frame which is derived
according to the parameters Mobile Allocation (MA), Mobile Allocation Offset (MAIO) and
Hopping Sequence Number (HSN). By means of this simultaneous reception it is possible for
the mobile to receive on more downlink time slots in a shorter period of time in the TDMA
frame thus allowing transmitting on a higher number of uplink time slots per TDMA frame.
Consequently the uplink data rate can also be increased for a mobile supporting Downlink
Dual Carrier. Aside from reception and transmission, the mobile is required to use idle times
in each TDMA frame for neighbor cell monitoring. This is depicted in Figure 2.17.

Reception, transmission and monitoring: single carrier vs. dual carrier.
As can be seen in Figure 2.17, the time for neighbor cell monitoring can be increased
remarkably if the same number of downlink and uplink time slots is supported as in sin-
gle carrier reception. Alternatively time slots 0 and 1 can be used for downlink data re-
ception, providing doubled throughput with neighbor cell monitoring on two carriers in
time slot 7.5
5 Each radio block on a Packet Data Channel (PDCH) in downlink and in uplink is mapped to the same time slot
and same carrier in four consecutive TDMA frames, resulting in a radio block period of 20 ms conforming to the
Basic Transmit Time Interval (BTTI) of 20 ms.

3GPP Release 7

The performance of a mobile station, as determined by its RF and Baseband processing
capability, is indicated by its multislot class. The multislot class depicts the capability of the
mobile to receive and transmit on a given number of time slots including switching times
between reception and transmission and vice versa. This capability was originally define for
single carrier reception in Release 1997, extended in Rel-5 and is now mapped to dual carrier
operation.
Downlink Dual Carrier is also applicable to Dual Transfer Mode (DTM), that is the si-
multaneous support of a circuit switched (CS) connection carrying a voice traffi channel
and of a packet switched (PS) connection carrying constrained or unconstrained delay data.
Thus, with DTM, Downlink Dual Carrier improves the use of multimedia applications (e.g.
web browsing, email reception, fil
sharing, etc.) also during a voice call. If the mobile
supports DTM and Downlink Dual Carrier, both CS voice and PS data connections are
mapped onto both carriers in downlink, while the uplink carrier is assigned to both the
CS voice and the PS data connections. Note, the specificatio
prescribes that all uplink
PDCHs need to be assigned on the same carrier as the uplink CS time slot. An example
of a Downlink Dual Carrier channel configuratio
in DTM with one time slot for voice,
four downlink and three uplink time slots for packet data is depicted in Figure 2.18 for
case B.
Although fast frequency synthesizers are assumed, the monitoring slot is a bit shorter than
for single carrier reception shown in case A, to allow for tuning from the Tx frequency to the
monitoring frequency and from the monitoring frequency to the Rx frequency. This allocation
of a total of nine time slots for transmit and receive gives a gain of 80% in the overall throughput
compared with a state-of-the-art single carrier mobile supporting a sum of fi e transmit and
receive slots as depicted in Figure 2.18.
Downlink Dual Carrier multislot capabilities have been define
using single carrier ca-
pabilities as a basis. Due to the fact that the monitoring task can be shifted to the second
receiver tuned to carrier frequency 2 in Figure 2.18, the firs transceiver on carrier frequency
1 employed both for reception and transmission can be used in a more efficien manner and
thus the peak throughput in Downlink can be more than doubled. This is shown in Table 2.8,
depicting the transmit and receive multislot capabilities for the single carrier and Downlink
Dual Carrier operation.
2.3.2.2
Multiplexing of a Downlink Dual Carrier Mobile with Legacy Mobiles
On the uplink, the Downlink Dual Carrier mobile cannot serve two carriers at the same
time, however, it has the fl xibility to alternate between the uplink carriers that correspond
to the allocated downlink carriers according to the dynamic allocation. This is illustrated
in Figure 2.19, which shows a Downlink Dual Carrier mobile A, supporting up to eight
receive time slots on carrier frequency 1 or carrier frequency 2. When multiplexed with two
legacy single carrier mobiles B and C, supporting up to two receive slots and one transmit
slot, the Downlink Dual Carrier mobile in this case uses in two consecutive radio block
periods either carrier frequency 1 or carrier frequency 2 on uplink, as commanded by the
network and hence the uplink multiplexing with legacy single carrier mobiles is considerably
improved.

Feedback Control Information
Feedback control information sent by the mobile to the network includes ACK/NACK reports
and channel quality reports related to the reception of downlink data. This information is sent
on PACCH after the mobile has been polled by the network. In case of simultaneous ongoing
CS voice, measurement reports are transmitted via SACCH. If a paired uplink timeslot is not
available (e.g. see Figure 2.18 where there is a paired uplink timeslot only for frequency 1 on
frequency 1’ but not for frequency 2), the PACCH message has to include the ACK/NACK
report and Channel Quality report for both carriers.

2.3.2.4
Channel Quality Reporting
Channel Quality Reporting by the mobile station to the network includes averaged measure-
ments such as mean and variance of the Bit Error Probability (MEAN BEP, CV BEP) on each
assigned carrier, signal level of the serving cell and interference level on each assigned time
slot. This information is used for Downlink Power Control and Link Adaptation procedures
executed at the BSS. In a Downlink Dual Carrier configuration the mobile station needs to
support the channel quality measurements for each carrier independently and also to support
reporting of these measurements in a message sent to the network. If the message size available
for reporting is too short, then the mobile only includes channel quality measurements for the
carrier on which the polling message was received.
2.3.2.5
Application to Different Frequency Bands
Several GSM operators today have allocations in different frequency bands (such as GSM 900
and DCS 1800 in Europe) and use a common BCCH in the low band (900 MHz band) and
deploy traffi channels both in the low band (900 MHz) and in the high band (1800 MHz).
The issue was assessed whether Downlink Dual Carrier should also support configuration
with one carrier allocated in the low band and one carrier allocated in the high band. However,
because frequency planning due to different propagation losses for low band and high band
is different and because of the impact on the mobile receiver design (such a configuratio
would force a narrowband implementation), the application of Downlink Dual Carrier has
been restricted in the specification to two carriers in the same frequency band.
2.3.2.6
Signaling Support
The support of Downlink Dual Carrier is indicated by the mobile including information on
the supported multislot class in the Downlink Dual Carrier operation and is sent via higher
control layer to the network as part of the mobile station’s capabilities. The maximum number
of time slots in a TDMA frame that the MS can receive is implicitly specifie by the applicable
multislot class as depicted in Table 2.8, according to 3GPP TS 45.002. The MS signals to the
network whether it supports the possible maximum or only a reduced number of time slots
relative to this maximum.

Impacts on the Network
Impacts on the radio access network are generally limited to SW-based functionalities such as
the multiplexing of Downlink Dual Carrier mobiles performed in RLC/MAC layer, the support
of Downlink Dual Carrier radio resource signaling (at assignment and resource reconfiguration
and Link Adaptation. The core network needs to be made aware of the Downlink Dual Carrier
capability of the mobile.
2.3.4.2
Impact on the Mobile Station
The major difference between a state-of-the-art single carrier mobile and a Downlink Dual
Carrier mobile is that simultaneous reception on two carriers is required. In general, two
receiver types may fulfil this requirement:
1. Separate narrowband receiver chains: The dual-carrier terminal exploits an architecture,
where the receiver branches can be tuned to different frequencies, whereby the receiver
branches can use either the same antenna or separate antennas. The latter case is depicted
in Figure 2.20.

2. Wideband receiver: Another option for Downlink Dual Carrier operation may be a wideband
receiver. In this architecture, a single analogue to digital converter (ADC) samples the
frequency range of the dual carrier assignment and baseband processing is commonly done
for all carriers. Due to lower channel selectivity than for option (1), receiver blocking and
receiver intermodulation requirements are tougher with this option.
2.4
Mobile Station Receiver Diversity
Mobile Station Receiver Diversity (MSRD) is a downlink feature which aims to improve the
reception of the radio link in the downlink direction. This is achieved by means of diversity
provided by an additional antenna in the MS. Antenna diversity is commonly used in the BTS
where a significan improvement in uplink performance is achieved. MSRD aims to bring
some of these benefit to the MS.
MSRD is characterized by a new set of performance requirements to the MS. These per-
formance requirements are referred to as Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance Phase 2
(DARP Phase 2). MSRD can be considered a natural extension to the Single Antenna Interfer-
ence Cancellation (SAIC) feature specifie in 3GPP Release 6; denoted DARP Phase 1. The
introduction of SAIC showed that significan link and system level gains can be achieved by
enhancing the MS receiver for GMSK modulated signals. SAIC is described further in Section
8.3. MSRD provides a natural extension to this by adding further gains to GMSK modulated
speech and data services, but also by improving the performance of channels with higher order
modulation, such as EGPRS.
This means that whereas DARP Phase 1 was targeting improvements in the spec-
tral efficien y of speech services, DARP Phase 2 also allows improved data services. If
the market penetration of DARP Phase 2 capable MS is high, it will allow a signifi
cant increase in the network capacity. For lower MS penetration rates, the user will ob-
serve an increase in the average data rate and thereby a better user experience for data
services.

3GPP Release 7
41
2.4.1
The Concept of MSRD
The basic principle of receiver diversity is that the MS receives the downlink transmission using
two antennas and combines the signals from the antennas before decoding. This mitigates the
impact of the fading radio channel, also known as multi-path fading. Ideally, the two received
signals are independent, that is uncorrelated and thus the combined signal will have less fades,
thereby increasing the signal-to-noise level of the received transmission.
In practice, the signals received at the two antennas will be correlated, and the higher the
correlation “ρ”, the less diversity gain can be achieved. The amount of correlation depends on
factors such as the radio propagation environment, the antenna design, the physical design of
the MS as well as the presence of a user. A simple model of the environment surrounding a
diversity-capable MS is shown in Figure 2.21.
The left-hand side of Figure 2.21 illustrates the transmitter at the base station sending the
desired downlink signal to the MS. This signal is received by the MS, and the signals received
at the two antennas are correlated with a factor, ρ. Besides the desired signal, Figure 2.21 also
shows signals originating from other base station transmitters. Like the desired signal, these
signals are received by the MS antennas and are correlated with factors ρ2 . . . ρn.
Another impairment which affects the performance of a receiver diversity MS is the antenna
gain imbalance or branch power difference, G. This impairment simply stems from the fact
that the received signal at the two antennas may be attenuated by different amounts. As for
the correlation, the antenna gain imbalance depends on the design of the MS and the user
interaction. For instance, the user may attenuate the signal to one antenna by covering its
signal with the hand during reception. Figure 2.22 illustrates the impact of antenna correlation
for an example MSRD implementation. The scenario is a typical urban scenario with a mobile
speed of 50 km/h with a co-channel interferer. The desired user signal and the interferer
signal are correlated with different correlation factors. Each point of the surface illustrates the
required CIR in dB to achieve a bit error rate of 1% in the receiver. It can be observed from
Figure 2.22 that there is a difference of 5–6 dB between a correlation factor of 0 and 1 (100%).

Note: Typical urban environment; MS speed of 50 km/h; co-channel interference.
In order to take these impairments into account when specifying the performance require-
ments to MSRD (DARP Phase 2), a simple channel model was adopted by 3GPP and included
in 3GPP TS 45.005 [13].
2.4.2
MSRD Radio Channel Modeling and Performance Requirements
The channel model for MSRD was derived with the purpose of setting performance require-
ments for the MS which reflect a performance that would be achievable in a real network.
Furthermore, the channel model allows setting requirements that ensure a robust MS perfor-
mance. The channel model takes these two objectives into account by including antenna gain
imbalance and correlation as parameters. The channel model is shown in Figure 2.23.
Antenna correlation is modeled by the parameter ρ denoting the magnitude of the complex
correlation whereas antenna gain imbalance is modeled by an attenuation G applied to one of
the signal branches. As can be observed from the model, ρ = 0 results in uncorrelated signals
at the two outputs of the model, Y1 and Y2. The channel model reflect one signal path or
radio link and if additional signals are required, for example to model interfering signals, the
channel model is simply extended with additional instances, and each signal is summed at the
antenna ports. A multi-interferer model is shown in Annex N of [13].
For DARP Phase 1 (SAIC), a new set of test scenarios were define denoted DARP Test
Scenarios (DTS), see Section 8.3. The basic idea behind these is to better reflec the complex

interference scenarios that a DARP-capable MS will be influence by in a real network. For
MSRD, these test scenarios are extended to receiver diversity scenarios by means of the
channel model in Figure 2.23 extended to a multi-interferer scenario, see Annex N of [13].
Two sets of antenna correlation and gain imbalance have been define reflectin the best
case and worst-case impairments (Table 2.10).
2.4.3
Link Level Performance of MSRD
The link level performance of MSRD can be exemplifie
by comparing the performance
requirements in 3GPP TS 45.005 for DARP Phase 2 with those of a legacy and a DARP Phase
1 receiver.
Table 2.11 shows the performance requirements of a legacy MS, a DARP Phase 1 MS and
a DARP Phase 2 MS, for GPRS and EGPRS PDTCH using GMSK modulation and with
co-channel interference. The requirements are specifie as the CIR level in dB for which a
BLER of at most 10% is reached.
It can be observed that the requirements for DARP Phase 1 are roughly 5 to 8 dB tighter
than those of a normal MS. The DARP Phase 2 requirements are in the area of 15 to 20 dB
tighter than those of the DARP Phase 1 MS, and more than 20 dB tighter than those of the

It is clear that DARP Phase 2 MS effectively cancels the impact of a co-channel interferer
and thus provides very large gains in performance compared to a legacy receiver.

differences between the requirements are represented in Figure 2.25. It is clear that DARP
Phase 2 also provides significan gains for 8-PSK modulated services, as the performance
requirements are more than 20 dB tighter than those for the legacy receiver.
Table 2.13 shows the reference sensitivity performance requirements of a legacy MS com-
pared to those of a DARP Phase 2 MS. The DARP Phase 2 requirements are shown for
both best and worst case impairments. That is, no correlation and no gain imbalance as well
as a correlation of 0.7 and a gain imbalance of −6 dB. The gains compared to legacy MS
requirements are represented in Figure 2.26 where “AGI” denotes the antenna gain imbalance.
When comparing the legacy requirements to those of the DARP Phase 2 receiver, it is
clear that even with worst case parameters, the DARP Phase 2 MS provides a significan
improvement in reference sensitivity level. The gains are in the order of 0.5 to 7 dB, and

2.4.5
Implementation Aspects
MSRD is a receiver enhancement which to a large extent only affects the MS implementation.
The network implementation may, however, require minor changes to procedures such as link
adaptation algorithms and radio resource management in order to take the enhanced downlink
performance into account.
The impacts on the MS implementation are significan compared to a DARP Phase 1 imple-
mentation as an increase in processing power is required as well as additional hardware in order
to implement the second receiver branch. Antenna design and placement also pose significan
challenges to the form factor and design of the MS. Such constraints do not exist in the BTS
and thus receiver diversity is commonly used in the uplink. However, cost, size and mechanics
design are very important parameters in the MS. Therefore, the introduction of MSRD often
requires trade-offs between these parameters and the actual performance of the feature.

Latency Reductions

and the network’s PCU,6 the unit operating RLC and MAC protocols. A short RTT enables

low-delay services, but also generally improves the performance of TCP-based services
including web browsing. Fast Ack/Nack Reporting (FANR) and Reduced Transmission Time
Interval (RTTI) are the two features specifie
in Release 7 to reduce latency. In addition,
while FANR and RTTI are closely linked to the support of packet-switched conversational
services in GERAN, RLC non-persistent mode (NPM) was also define
in Release 7 to
increase the radio link performance of point-to-point connections used for delay-sensitive
applications.
2.5.2
Reduced Transmission Time Interval
2.5.2.1
Concept
A radio block, which consists of four normal bursts, is transmitted using either a basic
transmission time interval (BTTI) configuratio or a reduced transmission time interval (RTTI)
configuration
The BTTI configuratio corresponds to the original radio block configuratio as of the firs
release of GPRS, R97. In this configuratio the four bursts of a radio block are transmitted on
the same time slot in four consecutive TDMA frames.
The RTTI configuratio was introduced as a means to reduce latency. In this configuratio the
four bursts of a radio block are transmitted on two time slots (PDCH-pair7) in two consecutive
TDMA frames. Thus a radio block is sent in RTTI configuratio in half the time it takes with
a BTTI configuration
Figure 2.27 illustrates the transmission of a radio block in BTTI and RTTI configurations
A radio block is transmitted with four bursts (b0, b1, b2, b3). The legacy frame structure is
strictly followed in RTTI configuration The transmission of an RTTI block always occurs
during the firs or the second half of a BTTI period.

2.5.2.2
Assignment of RTTI Resources
The network assigning a TBF using an RTTI configuratio specifie a set of PDCH-pairs for
both the uplink and the downlink directions. In a default configuratio the firs PDCH-pair
consists of the PDCH on time slot 0 and PDCH on time slot 1, the second PDCH-pair comprises
PDCH on time slot 2 and PDCH on time slot 3 and so forth.
Each PDCH-pair in one direction has a unique corresponding PDCH-pair in the opposite
direction for the purpose of reception and transmission of control signaling. In a default
configuration the corresponding PDCH-pair is allocated on the same time slot numbers as the
PDCH-pair in the opposite direction. However, some configuration require the corresponding
PDCH-pair(s) to use a different time slot in particular when the dual transfer mode is used, in
which case the network provides an explicit indication of the assigned PDCH-pairs for both
directions.
2.5.2.3
Multiplexing with Legacy Terminals
In order to avoid radio resource segregation between RTTI-capable mobile stations and legacy
ones, it is required that the uplink resource be allocated to a legacy mobile station when RTTI
radio blocks are transmitted in the downlink and that the uplink resource can be allocated to a
mobile station in RTTI configuratio when BTTI radio blocks are transmitted in the downlink.
This requirement led to the introduction of two USF8 modes: BTTI USF mode and RTTI
USF mode. In RTTI USF mode, the USF is transmitted as part of the RTTI radio block within
two TDMA frames. The RTTI USF mode is used if the radio resource is shared only between
mobile stations operating in RTTI configuration In BTTI USF mode, two USF values are
transmitted on a PDCH-pair. The firs USF value is carried in bursts b0, b2 of the two RTTI
blocks transmitted on the PDCH-pair. The second USF value is carried in bursts b1, b3 of the
two RTTI blocks transmitted on the PDCH-pair (Figure 2.28).
8 USF: Uplink State Flag. The USF is sent in downlink RLC/MAC blocks to allocate dynamically one or more
radio blocks in uplink direction. At assignment of an uplink TBF to a mobile station, a USF is assigned to that TBF
(and mobile station), the later scheduling of which in downlink will determine the scheduling of the uplink TBF. The
USF granularity controls whether the USF allocates one or four radio blocks on a given time slot (USF granularity
one and four, respectively).

BTTI USF mode and RTTI USF mode in RTTI configuration
If multiplexing with legacy terminals is not used and thus RTTI USF mode is used, a USF
value assigned to a TBF in RTTI configuratio allocates one RTTI block in the next RTTI
block period. When USF granularity four is used, the USF sent during the firs half of a BTTI
period allocates an RTTI block in the second half of the current and of the next three BTTI
periods. Similarly, the USF sent during the second half of a BTTI period allocates an RTTI
block in the firs half of each of the four BTTI periods immediately following the BTTI period
in which the USF was sent.
If multiplexing with legacy terminals is required and thus BTTI USF mode is used, a USF on
the lower-numbered PDCH (lower time slot number) of a PDCH-pair allocates an RTTI block
in the firs half of the next BTTI period. A USF on the higher numbered PDCH (higher time slot
number) of a PDCH-pair allocates an RTTI block in the second half of the next BTTI period.
If USF granularity “four” is used, the USF allocates an RTTI block in the firs or the second
half of the next four BTTI periods depending on which PDCH the USF was sent. The uplink
allocation with USF granularity four in BTTI and RTTI USF mode is shown in Figure 2.29.
In BTTI USF mode, the network may also transmit the USF with mixed modulation. In
this case, the modulation used for the transmission of the firs RTTI block differs from the
modulation used for the transmission of the second RTTI block. However, the network must
ensure that only the modulations supported by the mobile station to which the USF is addressed
are used. If the USF is sent with mixed modulation, then the coding of the USF bits conveyed

by the firs and the second RTTI block is performed according to the modulation and coding
scheme used for these blocks.
Because CS-1 cannot be used to send RLC/MAC control blocks during a TBF in RTTI
configuratio when BTTI USF mode is used, a new modulation and coding scheme, MCS-0,
is used instead. MCS-0 may also be used in RTTI configuratio with RTTI USF mode.
MCS-0 is largely derived from MCS-1. The MCS-0 header includes the RLC/MAC header
of the RLC/MAC control block as well as the 18-bit block check sequence (BCS) of the
payload it carries (the RLC/MAC control message). It corresponds to the size of the RLC/MAC
header in MCS-1. The encoding of the MCS-0 header follows that of the MCS-1 RLC/MAC
header, while the encoding of the MCS-0 payload is the same as that of the MCS-1 payload.
The interleaving and burst mapping are common to both schemes. The structure of MCS-0
compared to CS-1 and MCS-1 is depicted in Figure 2.30.
2.5.3
Fast Ack/Nack Reporting
2.5.3.1
Concept
Since GPRS was specifie in R97, the transfer of RLC data blocks9 between two peer RLC
entities in RLC acknowledged mode has relied on the receiver indicating the reception status
of these blocks to the transmitter, for potential retransmission(s). A (positive) acknowledge-
ment (Ack) indicates the corresponding data block was correctly received while a negative
acknowledgement (Nack) indicates otherwise, that is a retransmission is necessary. Ack/Nack
information pertaining to a number of blocks is provided by the RLC receiver by means
of a specifi control message (Ack/Nack message) which then carries an Ack/Nack bitmap,
of which each bit indicates the reception status of a given data block. Given that the RLC
9 RLC data blocks are carried within RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer. An RLC/MAC block for data transfer
may carry only one RLC data block in GPRS, up to two RLC data blocks in EGPRS and up to four RLC data blocks
in EGPRS2.

control-plane data and the RLC user-plane data share the same radio resources and are mul-
tiplexed in time-domain, the network usually keeps the amount of resources allocated to
control-plane signaling at a minimum so as not to negatively impact the user-plane traffic
As a result, an Ack/Nack message is transmitted with delay after a block is sent; only once
multiple blocks have been sent is an Ack/Nack message issued. Consequently, the retrans-
mission of erroneously received blocks, that is blocks intended for a given mobile station of
which the decoding of the data part or of both the data and header parts has failed, is delayed
proportionally to the frequency of the Ack/Nack message transmission.
Fast Ack/Nack Reporting (FANR) addresses the problems above by allowing, in addition
to Ack/Nack messages, the piggy-backing of Ack/Nack information within RLC/MAC blocks
for data transfer. Fast reporting of Ack/Nack information between peer RLC entities is thus
made possible by means of a new PAN (Piggy-backed Ack/Nack) fiel in those blocks, as
shown in Figure 2.31. Two ways of reporting are defined SSN-based, described in Section
2.5.3.2 and time-based, described in Section 2.5.3.3, which differ only by how the PAN is
constructed and formatted.
The introduction of this new structure required the definitio of new modulation and coding
scheme (MCS) variants for all MCSs except MCS-4 and MCS-9. The PAN fiel could not be
included in MCS-4 or MCS-9 because the code rate of the payload is 1.0, and because the
encoding of the header could not be changed. Tables 2.15 and 2.16 list the coding parameters
for the EGPRS and EGPRS2 coding schemes. The code rate of the payload when a PAN is
included is indicated with an asterisk (*).
Similarly to Ack/Nack messages, the network sends PAN field pertaining to an uplink
TBF in an unsolicited manner. However, the mobile station transmits an Ack/Nack message
or a PAN pertaining to a downlink TBF upon polling from the network. In addition, the
network may enable an event-based fast Ack/Nack reporting for a downlink TBF, the aim
of which is to report an erroneous transmission as soon as it is detected by transmitting a
negative acknowledgement to the RLC transmitter. When an event is detected, the mobile
station transmits either a PAN if possible (e.g. it has other data to transmit in uplink), or if not,
an Ack/Nack message. An erroneous transmission is detected by one of the following events:
r The RLC/MAC header of an RLC/MAC block for data transfer is successfully received but
the decoding of the RLC data block(s) included in the RLC/MAC block fails.
r An out-of-sequence reception occurs. The mobile station receives a new RLC data block
which is not the next in-sequence data block to the most recent10 RLC data block received.
The in-sequence data block(s) have thus not been received.
10 Recent here refers to the sequence number domain, not to the time domain.

While PAN enables the fast exchange of Ack/Nack information between peer RLC entities,
reaction times are define to minimize both the time by which the mobile station should be
ready to retransmit a block indicated as erroneous in the received PAN,11 and the time by which
the mobile station should be ready to transmit a PAN or Ack/Nack message upon detection of
an erroneous RLC data block.12

SSN-Based Fast Ack/Nack Reporting
SSN13-Based FANR is always used in the uplink direction. In this case it conveys acknowl-
edgement information pertaining to a downlink data transfer. In the downlink direction, the
network may use either SSN-Based FANR or Time-Based FANR. The variant used is signaled
to the mobile station at establishment and reconfiguratio of an uplink TBF.
11 This reaction time is define
as 5 or 6 TDMA frames since the last TDMA frame of the RLC/MAC block
containing the PAN.

Note: *Code rate of the payload when a PAN is included.
The PAN format in SSN-Based FANR is similar to that of an Ack/Nack message and is shown
in Figure 2.32. It contains an address fiel (TFI14) to identify the TBF being acknowledged.15 It
includes a bitmap of which each bit indicates the reception status of a data block. And a starting
sequence number (SSN) indicates the starting point of the bitmap and thus the exact data blocks
for which a reception status is provided in the bitmap. The reported bitmap (RB) is constructed
so that the RLC receiver reports the most recent unreported negative acknowledgement. The
size of the reported bitmap is determined by that of the ShortSSN fiel which contains the least
significan bits of the starting sequence number. The number of least significan bit included
is determined based on the RLC window size so that the ShortSSN uniquely identifie data
blocks within that window. The size of the ShortSSN fiel varies between 7 and 11 bits. If
the reported bitmap starts at the beginning of window, then the RLC receiver indicates this by
setting the Beginning Of Window (BOW) bit accordingly.
2.5.3.3
Time-Based Fast Ack/Nack Reporting
While SSN-based FANR uses the RLC sequence numbering as a reference to identify the RLC
data blocks for which an acknowledgement status is provided in the PAN, the Time-Based Fast
Ack/Nack reporting uses a time reference, between the transmission of an RLC data block in
14 TFI: Temporary Flow Identifie .
15 The number of information bits fed to the channel coder is 20 bits. The TFI is encoded by scrambling the TFI
with the fi e last parity bits added to the PAN information bits in the encoder.

uplink and the transmission of a PAN in downlink, to identify an RLC data block. Thus while
the SSN-based FANR is intended for a single mobile station, the time-based FANR is intended
for a multiplicity of mobile stations.
In time-based FANR, the PAN provides an acknowledgement status for all RLC data blocks
transmitted on one or more uplink time slots. The transmission time of the most recent RLC
data block reported in the PAN is define by a time reference. The time reference is represented
as a time shift (TSH) between the firs TDMA frame (N) of a given radio period in which the
PAN is transmitted and the firs TDMA frame of the radio block16 in which the reported RLC
data block has been transmitted (N – TSH or N – TSH – 1) modulo 2715648.17 The possible
values of TSH are listed in Table 2.17 (see Section 2.5.2 for details of RTTI).
The Time-Based PAN contains one code point for each RLC/MAC block transmitted in the
uplink on the reported time slot. The code points for RLC/MAC blocks transmitted during the
same transmission period are ordered in increasing order of the time slot numbers or PDCH-
pairs (see Section 2.5.2.1) in which they were sent. The code points are bit strings of Huffman
code and are described in Table 2.18. If more than one RLC data block was transmitted in a
single radio block, then the data blocks are split into two groups as follows. For a radio block
with two RLC data blocks, each group contains one RLC data block. For a radio block with
three RLC data blocks, the firs group contains the firs RLC data block and the second group
contains the second and third RLC data block. For a radio block with four RLC data blocks,

2.5.3.4
Multiplexing with Legacy Terminals
Mobile stations using FANR may be multiplexed on the same radio resource with mobile
stations not using FANR (i.e. legacy mobile stations, or mobile stations capable of FANR but
ordered not to use FANR). In this case, a mobile station using FANR may detect the presence of
a PAN fiel in an EGPRS RLC/MAC block for data transfer intended for a legacy mobile station
(or a mobile station not using FANR) even if there is none.18 Therefore, the network should
avoid those polling periods, although the probability of a false positive decoding is very low.
2.5.4
RLC Non-Persistent Mode
2.5.4.1
Concept
The RLC non-persistent mode, originally introduced for Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast
Services (MBMS) in Release 6, was adapted for point-to-point connections in Release 7.
It is aimed at error-tolerant delay-sensitive services such as media streaming. The transfer
of RLC data blocks in RLC non-persistent mode includes non-exhaustive (non-persistent)
retransmissions (using selective type I ARQ or type II hybrid ARQ) controlled by the RLC
window size, the non-persistent mode transfer time and acknowledgement information. RLC
non-persistent mode can be seen as a hybrid between RLC acknowledged and unacknowledged
modes where the RLC performance is significantl better than unacknowledged mode while
maintaining a delay budget unlike RLC acknowledged mode.
The RLC transmitter operating in non-persistent mode is allowed to advance its RLC
transmit window and transmit new RLC data even if the oldest block in the window has not
been positively acknowledged by the receiver. This prevents the RLC window from stalling
and ensures new requests for data transmission are served as soon as the radio resource is
allocated. As a consequence, it is expected that some RLC data blocks will not be correctly
received. If some RLC data blocks are not received, the receiving side attempts to preserve the
user information length by replacing missing RLC data blocks with dummy information bits.
2.5.4.2
Non-Persistent Mode Transfer Time
Media streaming services have usually strict requirements on transport delay between a source
and a destination. The transport delay is one of Quality of Service (QoS) attributes associated
with the packet data context (PDP). A large number of RLC retransmissions may thus trigger
data though correctly received to be discarded by upper layers if received too late. A transfer
time19 may hence be associated with an RLC entity operating in RLC non-persistent mode
in order to avoid the transmission of data of which the delivery would exceed an assigned
limit. The value of the NPM transfer time is decided by the network based on transport
delay requirement and the time budget estimation for the different parts of the communication
18 This is caused by the redefinitio of the combination of RRBP and ES/P field to PANI (PAN Indicator) and
CES/P field in the RLC/MAC header. See 3GPP TS 44.060.
19 NPM transfer time.

3GPP Release 7
59
channel. It is also possible for the network to assign different value of NPM transfer time to
the RLC transmitter and the RLC receiver.
When the RLC transmitter begins to transmit a new upper layer PDU20 and an NPM transfer
time limitation is assigned, a timer set to this value is started, at the expiry of which no RLC data
blocks containing segment(s) of the upper layer PDU are (re)transmitted any longer (except if
an RLC data block also contains segment(s) of any other upper layer PDU for which the timer
is still running). While the timer is running, if all RLC data blocks including a segment of an
upper layer PDU have been positively acknowledged, the RLC transmitter stops the timer.
On the RLC receiver side, the boundaries of an upper layer PDU are unknown until all the
RLC data blocks containing segments of the upper layer PDU are actually received. Therefore,
the RLC receiver is able to start a timer with the value of the NPM transfer time only based
on the status of RLC data blocks. The RLC receiver starts the timer for an RLC data block if
the following conditions are met:
r the RLC data block has not been received yet; and
r an RLC/MAC block containing an RLC data block with equal or higher BSN has been
received (this addresses the case when the RLC/MAC header is correctly decoded but the
decoding of the RLC data block fails).
The timer at the receiver side is started only once for each RLC data block when the conditions
above are met for the firs time. The RLC receiver stops the timer when the RLC data block is
correctly received.
The minimum and maximum values of the NPM transfer time are 30 ms and 5 s respectively.
2.5.5
Specificatio Aspects
RTTI, Fast Ack/Nack reporting and RLC non-persistent mode are specifie as shown in Table
2.19.
2.5.6
Implementation Aspects
Implementation of latency reduction requires changes on both terminal and network sides.
In order to support latency reduction, the network and the terminal must support new block
formats and corresponding MCSs used for radio blocks carrying PAN, transmission and
reception of blocks on PDCH-pair, new procedures such as event-based reporting. The terminal
implementation also has to comply with new requirements on reaction times (e.g. a time needed
for retransmission of a data block after it has been reported as erroneously received by the
network). RLC non-persistent mode for non-MBMS services is a feature separate from latency
reductions and as such its implementation is independent of latency reductions.
The terminal signals the support of latency reduction via a single bit in MS Radio Access
Capability information element. This means that the terminal has to implement all the features
included under the umbrella of latency reduction. However, there is no signaling of the support

Introduction
The rapid increase of data traffi
over wireless networks and the increasing demand for
real-time applications required cellular networks to evolve further. To cope with this trend
in the longer term, enhancements of 3GPP access technologies to provide high data rates
while enabling better spectrum efficien y over the radio interface were needed in the packet-
switched domain. The feasibility studies on the evolution of cellular networks, which started
in December 2004, focused on bringing these enhancements to UTRAN technology and
3GPP system architecture. The results of this work led to the definitio in 3GPP Release 8
of “Evolved UTRA” generally known as LTE, and that of Evolved Packet Core (EPC) also
referred as System Architecture Evolution (SAE). EPC is a fla core network architecture that
enables the integration of LTE with legacy GERAN and UTRAN-HSPA networks as well as
other non-3GPP wireless technologies. As define in [1], the LTE and SAE/EPC jointly form
the evolved packet system (EPS). LTE will boost mobile broadband and enable, for example
real-time applications including Voice-over IP (VoIP) with high-performance in highly mobile
environments and with bandwidth scalability up to 20 MHz.
In a landscape where other 3GPP RATs1 are already deployed (i.e. GERAN and/or UTRAN),
the deployment of LTE must follow an essential requirement: the ability to interwork with these
technologies to ensure service continuity and service availability. Interworking mechanisms
between GERAN/UTRAN and E-UTRAN have thus been specifie in 3GPP Release 8.
Following another trend towards IP-based transport solutions in the wireless network, A
interface over IP (AoIP) is another significan topic specifie in Release 8. AoIP enables the A
interface user plane data to be transported over IP. The support for the A interface control plane
signaling over IP (SIGTRAN [2]) was already introduced in Release 7, while user plane data

was based only on TDM [3]. Implementing the A interface over IP allows efficien transport
solutions, with higher fl xibility and lower cost. AoIP enables simpler network design between
the BSS and the MSCs, also allowing the CS core to utilize the same IP backhaul for different
3GPP radio access technologies. Furthermore, with AoIP, support for TrFO (Transcoder-
free operation) becomes possible in GSM networks thus leading to bandwidth savings and
improved voice quality.
RF performance specificatio
for a GSM Multicarrier BTS (MCBTS) is a further topic
handled in Release 8. In this context, two MCBTS classes have been introduced supporting
multicarrier operation by means of a single wideband transceiver, that is without using passive
TX combiners, thus improving power efficien y and allowing less complex antenna systems.
However, the multicarrier architecture requires some relaxation compared to the stringent RF
requirements specifie for a state-of-the-art Normal BTS. Major impacts are caused by higher
intra BSS TX intermodulation distortion (IMD) on the transmitter side and lower inband
blocking performance due to the use of a wideband receiver architecture on the receiver side.
The functional description and the standardization of GSM MCBTS are described at the end
of this chapter.
3.2
Interworking with LTE
The design of LTE as a packet-switched only system brings a number of challenges in definin
interworking mechanisms with other systems. The absence of the traditional circuit-switched
domain [5] (Figure 3.1) means in particular that new solutions are needed to ensure service
continuity of CS services such as voice in GERAN and UTRAN. Not only radio access
technology (RAT) change needs to be executed, but also domain transfer between PS and CS
domains is required.
Another design constraint is to limit the impact on the already deployed GERAN networks
while taking into account the different sets of GERAN features supported in these networks.
Hence, the primary objective is to defin adequate solutions that satisfy the LTE interworking
requirements while having a minimum impact on the existing GERAN networks.
3.2.1
Interworking Requirements and Mechanisms
3.2.1.1
Interworking Requirements
The set of requirements for interworking between E-UTRAN and GERAN define
in [6]
focuses on mobility and service continuity in idle and active modes for real-time and non-real-
time applications. A multi-mode mobile station supporting E-UTRAN, GERAN and possibly
UTRAN should be able to support measurements, cell change and possibly handover2 between
the two (three) systems, according to a fundamental design principle: “single radio”. The
principle of “single radio” consists of having at any point in time at most a single active
radio (GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN) which greatly minimizes the complexity of terminals
as well as battery consumption. In addition, the impact on existing network elements would be
2 A handover consists of allocating resources in the target cell prior to the mobile station being handed over to that
cell, thus reducing the interruption which otherwise occurs at cell change. A handover keeps the mobile station in
active mode, while a cell change forces a mobile station to idle mode in the target cell.

minimized to reduce the deployment costs of E-UTRAN. Finally, performance criteria were
define as follows [6]:
r The interruption time of real-time services should be less than 300 ms.
r The interruption time for non-real-time services should not exceed 500 ms.
In case of inter-RAT handover between GERAN and E-UTRAN, three main scenarios are
identified
r handover of packet data services including voice service that is Voice over IP (VoIP);
r handover of voice services with domain transfer between CS and PS domains;3
3 It should be noted that this scenario was considered only for the direction from PS (LTE) to CS (UMTS, GSM).
Indeed, for the reverse direction it was assumed that a call ongoing in the CS domain (e.g. in GSM) would not be
handed to LTE.

66
GSM/EDGE
r handover of the voice with domain transfer between CS and PS domains and packet data
services simultaneously.
The solutions investigated take into account the different sets of features potentially supported
in GERAN networks while preventing unnecessary requirements on these networks. To this end
an extensive list of the possible combinations of CS Handover, DTM, EGPRS, PS Handover,
DTM Enhancements and VoIP, grouped in scenarios, is identifie in [7]. As a result, a number
of interworking solutions are specifie
to provide service continuity between GERAN and
E-UTRAN in the scenarios above.
3.2.1.2
Interworking Mechanisms
The introduction of E-UTRAN as an additional RAT with which it is possible to interwork
in GERAN requires that coexistence between RATs must be possible and thus backwards
compatibility with existing mechanisms must be ensured. It must also be possible to interwork
solely between GERAN and E-UTRAN without requiring any unnecessary mechanisms that
may be define for interworking with other RATs (e.g. transit through UTRAN is of course
not an alternative). This is required to allow a multiplicity of dual-mode and multi-mode
deployment scenarios. In addition, the impact on existing networks must be minimized. This
can mean, however, that interworking requirements (e.g. interruption time) may not be met or
that complexity may instead be imposed on LTE as described below, see Section 3.2.2.1. The
standard is nonetheless sufficientl fl xible and offers scalable means to enable a network op-
erator to select the correct trade-off between service aspects, impact on its coverage (GERAN)
network (according to the features it already supports) and impact on LTE.
A minimum set of interworking mechanisms is, however, required to ensure a basic in-
terworking functionality between GERAN and E-UTRAN: the broadcast and acquisition of
E-UTRAN-related system information in GERAN, and the priority re-selection algorithm
allowing prioritization among RATs for cell re-selection purposes. These and other aspects
are described in the following.
3.2.2
Service Continuity
3.2.2.1
Voice-Call Continuity with Domain Change between CS and PS
The concept of domain change was introduced in Release 7. It provides voice call continuity
(VCC) between the IP Multimedia-Subsystem (IMS) and the CS domains [8]. The VCC ap-
plication provides the necessary functions for originating and terminating calls while enabling
domain transfer between the CS domain and the IMS (PS domain).
Release 7 VCC supports handovers between Wireless LAN (WLAN) VoIP and CS calls.
This is known as “dual radio VCC” where two radios are simultaneously active, that is WLAN
and for example GSM. IMS and CS registrations are concurrently active, and the mobile station
with an ongoing call in one domain can start handover in the other domain simultaneously.
Inter-RAT handover of voice services between LTE and GERAN networks with no support
for PS conversational services requires PS to CS domain transfer. As opposed to Release 7
VCC, the VCC solution between E-UTRAN and GERAN is based on single radio; Single

3GPP Release 8
67
Radio VCC (SRVCC) specifie as of Release 8 in [9]. SRVCC provides a solution for voice
call continuity in the direction from E-UTRAN to GERAN only, seeing that this direction
is identifie
as the most important and relevant scenario for early (typically spotty) LTE
deployments [7]. It enables a PS to CS handover from E-UTRAN to GERAN by means of
enhanced functionality in the MME and the MSC server. SRVCC is based on the assumption
that the voice sessions are anchored in the IMS. The MSC server thus, upon receiving the
handover request from the MME, initiates both the session transfer with the IMS and the CS
handover with the target cell. Simultaneous handover of voice services and other packet data
is handled such that the MME distinguishes the bearers to enable the handover of the data
through the PS domain.
SRVCC is designed to provide voice service continuity with GERAN networks that support
only CS handover (among the features listed in Section 3.2.1.1) and makes no changes to
the GERAN networks. Instead SRVCC requires added functionality to the standard EPS
functionality and importantly voice support in LTE. The complexity of SRVCC motivated the
introduction of a CS fallback [10] solution developed to cope with early LTE deployments
where voice is simply not supported. This solution enables the handling of traditional CS-
domain services such as CS voice and SMS in E-UTRAN. For example, CS fallback enables
a mobile station initiating/receiving a voice call in E-UTRAN to be redirected to GERAN
where the call will be established and take place. Upon call termination, the mobile station
may be redirected back to E-UTRAN by the network. The CS fallback in EPS is enabled by
the introduction of the SGs interface, based on the Gs interface, define in [11] between the
MSC Server and the MME.
3.2.2.2
Packet Data Service Continuity
Packet data service continuity is enabled by inter-RAT PS handover between GERAN and
E-UTRAN. While PS handover provides service continuity upon cell change, it is not always
available. In this case cell re-selection occurs which involves service interruption. As opposed
to a handover mechanism where resources in the target cell are assigned prior to the mobile
station arriving in that cell and resources in the source cell are released only upon the mobile
station successfully accessing the target cell, cell re-selection proceeds by firs releasing
the connection in the source cell, re-selecting to the target cell and upon successful access to
that cell, establishing the connection to the cell.
In order to limit the service interruption at cell re-selection, the only way is to minimize
the time needed for the mobile station to successfully access the new cell. To this end, the
Network Assisted Cell Change (NACC) procedure [12, 13, 1] was introduced in Release 4
between GERAN cells. NACC enables the source cell to provide the mobile station with
system information about the target cell necessary to access that cell, faster than it would take
the mobile station to acquire that information from broadcast channels in the target cell. In
Release 5, NACC was extended to cover the direction from UTRAN to GERAN only, while
for the other direction it is faster to acquire the information in the UTRAN cell itself than
transferring it while in GERAN. In Release 8, NACC has been extended for the same reason
to support a cell change only in the direction from E-UTRAN to GERAN.
Although NACC enables better cell re-selection performance for packet data services
through minimizing service interruption, it does not meet the timing requirements of LTE [14].

3.2.3
E-UTRAN Information in GERAN System Information
Mobility in a cellular system relies on the availability in each cell of neighboring cell infor-
mation:
r to avoid mobile stations camping on a given cell to blindly search for neighboring frequencies
and cells;
r to control the outbound mobility from a given cell and thus the inbound mobility to a given
cell.
This neighbor cell information is typically broadcast as part of the system information of a cell.
The conventional manner is for the network to broadcast a list of neighboring frequencies and
possibly cells that a mobile station in this cell considers for cell re-selection and measurement
reporting. This principle, generally known as a white list, has not been applied with the
introduction of E-UTRAN.
Different from GERAN and UTRAN where the neighbor cell list is always a white list, in
E-UTRAN the concept of black list was introduced. It consists of listing for given frequencies
cells that are not to be considered for cell re-selection and measurement reporting. All other
unlisted cells can thus be considered as potential candidates for cell change and measurements.
The use of a black list for E-UTRAN cells was chosen due to the broadcast capacity savings it
yields as less system information bits are transferred compared to the white list. A disadvantage
of the black list, however, is that some cells not listed in the black list might not be allowed
for some users, for example they may belong to a forbidden Tracking Area (TA). A mobile
station re-selecting such a cell will, as in GERAN and UTRAN, be forbidden to re-select any
cell on the same frequency for a certain time. In GERAN, in the case of E-UTRAN as well
as UTRAN, this time is 20 minutes [15]. To alleviate this problem, adding the Tracking Area
Identity (TAI) to the Physical Layer Cell Identity (PCI or PLCID) and the center frequency
of an E-UTRAN cell was considered. It would have resulted in broadcast capacity utilization
and therefore was not seen as desirable – it would also have led to a “gray” list. However, in
order to identify such cells and avoid or minimize cell re-selection attempts to forbidden TAs
and the resulting frequency ban, the grouping of E-UTRAN cells per TA is used in GERAN
networks. The E-UTRAN neighbor cell information broadcast in GERAN system information
hence consists of groups of cells (PCIs) belonging to the same TA and optionally include the
related TAI. A device receiving this information would then be able to immediately re-select
to a cell on a given frequency after it has re-selected a cell belonging to a forbidden TA on that
same frequency. In connected mode, TA grouping saves also on the radio resources utilization
as unnecessary measurement reporting of forbidden cells is prevented.
3.2.3.1
E-UTRAN-Related System Information Broadcast and Acquisition
The transmission of E-UTRAN neighbor cell information in GERAN follows similar prin-
ciples to that of UTRAN neighbor cell information. E-UTRAN neighbor cell information is
introduced in the System Information Type 2quater (SI2quater) message [15] broadcast on
BCCH, and in other existing dedicated signaling messages (e.g. Measurement Information on
SACCH).

Fragmentation of System Information due to Multi-RAT MSs.
However, adding the E-UTRAN neighbor cell information to these messages, although
based on the black list, increases the time to acquire the system information, in particular
when a mobile station supports all three RATs (see Figure 3.2) but also in case when it only
supports two RATs. In this case, it needs to read a significan amount of system information,
some of which is irrelevant (e.g. UTRAN information when the mobile station is not UMTS-
capable). This introduces delays in cell re-selection and measurement reporting. In some case,
a reduction of several seconds is possible [16].
For a dual-mode GERAN/E-UTRAN mobile, the acquisition of E-UTRAN neighbor cell
information (including measurement parameters) is optimized by enclosing this information
in adjacent instances of the System Information Type 2quater message (or dedicated signaling
message) with no other RAT information in between. UTRAN information is arranged in the
same way. Each instance then contains:
r an indicator identifying the RAT for which it carries the information;
r a START indicator to identify the instance where the information starts;
r a STOP indicator to identify the instance where the information stops.
For example, if a message instance is the firs one containing E-UTRAN information, the
START fiel is set to 1, while if the E-UTRAN information were the last one, then the STOP
fiel would be set to 1. If the message instance is neither the firs or the last one containing
E-UTRAN or UTRAN information, then the respective START and STOP field will be set to
0. Figure 3.3 shows an example of the usage of the START and STOP indicators.
This optimization although requiring additional bits for the START/STOP bit indicators
enables faster acquisition of system information allowing for the reduction in cell re-selection
and measurement reporting time as well as reduced power consumption for mobile stations that
do not support all three RATs and therefore can skip the reading of those instances belonging
to the RAT they do not support.

Priority-Based Inter-RAT Cell Re-Selection in GERAN
3.2.4.1
RAT Prioritization
The availability of E-UTRAN in addition to UTRAN forced the need for prioritization between
RATs so that a multi-RAT mobile station, when cell re-selection is in its control, has the means
to differentiate between the different RATs and re-select to the favorable RAT as indicated by
the network, that is the priority RAT.
The algorithm based on thresholds/offsets [17] already utilized for GERAN/UTRAN inter-
working could provide prioritization between cells of different RATs. For example, some of
the parameters that control the cell re-selection in GERAN, if set appropriately, could influ
ence the selection of a certain RAT so that cell re-selection to that RAT would more likely
happen than re-selection to another RAT. Although feasible, this mechanism was not seen as
advantageous due to the varying offsets.
Instead in Release 8, an algorithm based on absolute priorities is used. The priority-based
inter-RAT cell re-selection algorithm operates with either common priorities or individual
priorities (and associated thresholds).
Common priorities defin the basic inter-RAT cell-reselection principles in a given cell.
They are typically provided in the system information of a cell for general-purpose operation
in that cell. Common priorities apply to mobile stations that do not have any individual
priorities.
Individual priorities, on the other hand, last in time and across cells. They override any
common priority. They are typically valid in a given entire PLMN, and are subscriber-specific
thus provided individually to mobile stations. Individual priorities may be used, for instance,
to prioritize given RAT frequencies to premium data users or even make such frequencies
accessible only to such users.
The network assigns individual priorities, for example, based on subscription-related infor-
mation provided by the core network. This subscription-related information is known as the
Subscriber Profil ID for RAT/Frequency priority (SPID [5,13] or as RSFP [1]). SPID is an

3GPP Release 8
71
index referring to user information such as mobility profile service usage, etc. The SPID is
sent from the core network to the BSS (or eNB or RNC) and can be used by the BSS (or eNB
or RNC) both in idle mode or connected mode, for example:
r to derive mobile station-specifi cell re-selection priorities to control idle mode camping; or
r to control the redirection or handover to other RATs/frequencies in connected mode.
3.2.4.2
Cell Re-Selection Algorithm
The definitio
of cell re-selection criteria based on absolute priorities allows an operator,
according to given radio conditions, to prioritize RAT or frequencies over others, as well as
prevent access to a given RAT or frequencies. The priority-based inter-RAT cell re-selection
algorithm only applies in the case of mobile station autonomous cell re-selection. It provides a
means to control the mobility of the mobile station even if no network-controlled mechanism is
used (i.e. a mechanism by which the network orders the mobile station to move to a given cell)
by ensuring that the mobile station always camps on the highest priority RAT or frequency
(provided that the given radio criteria are fulfilled)
Priorities are given on an E-UTRAN or UTRAN frequency basis. For GERAN, a single
priority is used.4 No two priorities belonging to two different RATs are equal. If for a given
frequency no priority is given, this frequency is not considered for cell re-selection. The basic
algorithm is described and illustrated hereafter, considering GERAN as the serving RAT.
It should be noted that priorities and thresholds cannot be de-correlated. The algorithm is
specifie in detail in [17]:
r If the measurement quantity of a higher priority non-GERAN RAT frequency is higher
than a given (high) threshold for that RAT during a time interval Treselection, the mobile
station operates cell re-selection among higher priority cell candidates consisting of cells
in decreasing order of priority and, when on the same frequency, in decreasing order of
measurement quantity. This is illustrated in Figure 3.4.
r If the serving cell level is lower than a given (low) threshold and all measured GERAN
cells during a time interval Treselection, the mobile station operates cell re-selection among
lower priority cell candidates consisting of cells of which the measurement quantity is higher
than a given threshold for the corresponding RAT, in decreasing order of priority and, when
on the same frequency, in decreasing order of measurement quantity. This is illustrated in
Figure 3.5.
r If the serving cell level is lower than a given (low) threshold for all measured GERAN cells
during a time interval Treselection, and there is no cell re-selection candidate, of which the
measurement quantity is higher than a given threshold for the corresponding RAT, the mobile
station operates cell re-selection among non-GERAN cells of which the corresponding
4 The mobile station may be assigned different priorities per GSM carrier while in UTRAN or E-UTRAN. If in this
case the mobile station moves to a GSM cell on a given carrier, it applies while in GSM only the priority applicable
to that carrier.

3.2.5
Inter-RAT Measurement Reporting and Control
When interworking with LTE was introduced, some scenarios were identifie
where the
monitoring of LTE cells was not seen as necessary or reporting was not needed, for example:
r LTE being a PS-only system, when a CS voice call is ongoing in GERAN, there is no
possibility of handing over that call to E-UTRAN given there is no single-radio voice
call continuity in the direction from GERAN/UTRAN CS domain to E-UTRAN. In such
scenarios it is not necessary to measure (and report) LTE cells until the call is ended.
r When Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) cells (see Section 3.2.8) are deployed on a specifi
CSG frequency, it should be possible for CSG-capable mobile stations to measure cells on
this frequency while ensuring no reports are sent and for non CSG-capable mobile stations
not to measure cells on this frequency.
Means have thus been define
for the network to selectively control the measurement and
reporting of inter-RAT cells by mobile stations. The mechanisms specifie control finel and
independently whether or not to take measurements (possibly on a frequency basis) of UTRAN
and E-UTRAN neighboring cells, and if so whether only provided the serving cell signal level
is below or above given levels. It is also possible to selectively control whether measurements
are reported. These mechanisms allow tuning of the neighboring cell measurements and

74

associated reporting on a case-by-case basis, and as a consequence to mitigate the impact on
the MS battery consumption and on the radio interface signaling.
3.2.6
Inter-RAT PS Handover
The Inter-RAT PS handover between GERAN and E-UTRAN, define in [1,18], is applicable
to all PS data services, real-time and non-real-time. It is the only mechanism in Release 8 that
enables service continuity to fulfil the maximum service interruption times in both directions:
GERAN to E-UTRAN and E-UTRAN to GERAN. It is based on the same principles as the
inter-RAT PS handover define between GERAN and UTRAN, thus with minimum impact
on the specification and on deployed networks.
This mechanism is under the control of the network and define
in such a way that it
is the source system that decides on both the initiation and the execution of the handover. It
follows the “source adapts to target” principle which means that the source system provides the
information as expected by and define in the target system, for example in a PS handover from
E-UTRAN to GERAN information is provided by E-UTRAN to GERAN within a “Source
BSS to Target BSS transparent container” (as used in a PS Handover in GERAN) [18].
In order for inter-RAT PS Handover to operate, for example to E-UTRAN, it requires that
in the source RAT, for example GERAN, the terminal capabilities pertaining to the target RAT
must be available prior to handover initiation. In addition, the following conditions must be
met in the direction from GERAN to E-UTRAN:
r The mobile station is involved in an ongoing packet data session (and if in GERAN, not in
a CS voice call).
r The BSS supports PFM (Packet Flow Management) procedures [13].
Simplifie
illustrations of the PS handover signaling from GERAN to E-UTRAN and
E-UTRAN to GERAN as specifie in [1] are depicted in Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8.5
3.2.6.1
E-UTRAN Capability Transfer
The mechanism for enabling the transfer of the MS UTRAN capabilities from the mobile
station to the BSS is re-used to support the transfer of the MS E-UTRAN capabilities as
well. As described in [18] and specifie in [13,19], the E-UTRAN capabilities needed for PS
handover to E-UTRAN are transferred from the MS to the BSS by means of NAS (Non-Access
Stratum) signaling. An SGSN, as depicted in Figure 3.9, supporting inter-RAT PS handover to
E-UTRAN will request the MS to transfer its E-UTRAN capabilities in Attach Complete and
Routing Area Update Complete messages. The SGSN will then in turn include this container
upon every PFC creation within the CREATE-BSS-PFC message sent to the BSS, that is
when data transfer is initiated. A BSS which receives these capabilities will then forward

them in the GERAN network, that is to a target BSS upon a subsequent (intra-GERAN) PS
handover.
However, upon inter-RAT PS handover to GERAN, it cannot be guaranteed that an eNodeB
will forward the MS UTRAN capabilities or that, likewise, an RNC will forward the MS
E-UTRAN capabilities. This is because a RAT may not obtain the MS capabilities of a third
RAT (i.e. if this RAT is not involved in the handover) and therefore cannot send those during
handover. In order to cover this case in Release-8, PS handover is extended so that the missing
capabilities of another RAT can be requested in GERAN upon successful PS handover. This
is enabled by extending the PS Handover Complete procedure [13]. With this addition it is
guaranteed that the E-UTRAN and UTRAN capabilities are available at the BSS in order to
support a subsequent PS handover following the “source adapts to target” principle.

3.2.8
CSG Mobility from GERAN
In EPS there is a possibility that some of the LTE users (respectively 3G users) have access to
EPS services through eNodeBs (respectively NodeBs) located in private homes, commercial
premises or enterprises. In LTE these eNBs are known as Home eNodeBs (HeNB) while in
UTRAN they are referred to as Home NodeBs (HNB).
Users having access to cells under control of H(e)NBs belong to a Closed Subscriber
Group (CSG), that is a closed group of subscribers. Such group may be, for example, that of
premium data users. Hence these cells are also known as CSG cells. The primary goals with
the introduction of CSG cells are the improvement of the coverage, for example, in areas that

the support of the preceding capabilities in that list.

may not be covered by macro cells of the same RAT as well as the differentiation of services
between users with different billing and charging schemes.
The CSG mobility mechanisms specifie in Release 8 provide only a basic support for HeNB
or HNB deployment. These mechanisms are limited to CSG cell identificatio and CSG cell
selection/re-selection for CSG members only. CSG mobility mechanisms are define for idle
mode only and limited to autonomous cell search and re-selection as well as manual CSG cell
selection mechanisms. The priority reselection algorithm is also applicable to CSG cells. This
implicitly allows some form of network control over CSG cell re-selection.
3.2.8.1
Identificatio of CSG and CSG Cells
A CSG is identifie by a CSG identity (CSG-ID) which is a unique identifie within a PLMN
[20]. It gathers a collection of CSG cells, within an E-UTRAN or a UTRAN network, that
are open only to a certain group of subscribers. The CSG-ID is a static identifie with a fi ed
length of 27 bits. For the CSG ID of an H(e)NB, a human readable name is also assigned
which is broadcast in free text format [23] and used as an aid for manual CSG cell selection.
This is comparable to the SSID of a WLAN access point, for example.
Like a macro cell, the home cell controlled by a Home eNB is assigned a Physical Cell
Identity (PCI) on the carrier frequency on which it operates. But unlike a macro cell’s PCI, the
PCI of a home cell is a variable identifie , although changes are expected to be infrequent. It
may, however, change at each HeNB start-up or reconfiguration although it is recommended
that a HeNB uses its previously used PCI if no collision is detected.7 It may also happen that
the PCI changes, for example due to the detection of a PCI collision. In addition, the carrier
frequency of the HeNB, selected from a preconfigure limited range of frequencies, may also
be modifie
but only at power up [5]. In spite of changes that could occur to these basic
yet crucial parameters, interworking with those cells must not be impaired. Moreover these
changes should not require any effort or intervention from the CSG users or the managers of
the HeNB – they should be handled by the network and mobile stations.
Moreover, it is also important to note that a home cell will be deployed on a carrier frequency
either shared with (non-CSG) macro cells, or dedicated to CSG cells. In the former case, a
range of PCIs dedicated to CSG cells is broadcast by CSG cells. This enables a terminal to
identify “immediately” whether a cell on a carrier frequency is a CSG cell or not simply from
the PCI (and frequency). When received, this range is stored for 24 hours [5,22], and used for
cell (re-)selection purposes. It is valid only within the network (PLMN) in which it is sent. This
PCI range8 is used in GERAN as well, but is indicated directly within the system information
of GERAN cells. The PCI range enables mobile stations that are non-CSG members to ignore
CSG cells, for example when in idle mode, thus preventing cell re-selection failures to any such
cell in that frequency [15]. In connected mode, it permits, in an easy manner, these mobile
stations not to measure CSG cells. This, in turn, prevents wasting measurement reporting
capacity used instead for non-CSG E-UTRAN or UTRAN cells.
7 It is indeed expected that an HeNB has the capability to detect PCIs in its vicinity so a non-colliding PCI (on a
given frequency) can be allocated.
8 For UTRAN CSG cells, a similar range of PSC is also used.

3GPP Release 8
79
When deployed on a dedicated carrier frequency, all corresponding PCIs are reserved for
CSG cells, thus yielding the same benefit as when a PCI-range is used on a shared frequency.
3.2.8.2
CSG Cell Selection and Re-Selection in Idle Mode
CSG cells are managed by the owner of the H(e)NB and the operator. Under the supervision
of the operator, the H(e)NB owner may add or remove CSG members from its CSG cells.
The network operator controls the H(e)NB deployment and (re-)configuratio by verificatio
of its identity, configurin its settings, checking the regulatory requirements and determining
its location. The addition of H(e)NB does not impose/require any network changes in the
operator’s network, other than the identificatio aspects described in Section 3.2.8.1.
Each CSG user has a list of allowed CSG cells9 stored in its USIM [20]. This “Allowed CSG
list” prevents camping on and cell re-selection attempts to forbidden CSG cells. It is either
provided to the mobile station from the network by means of NAS signaling or obtained by
manual selection.
In the case of manual selection, the CSG user scans for the available CSG identities within
the registered PLMN and selects only one of its identifie allowed CSG cells from its stored
list [23,24]. If the request to search the available CSG IDs comes from the network through
NAS, the mobile station reports these cells back to the network.
Only a mobile station that contains at least one CSG ID in its “Allowed CSG list” proceeds
in addition to normal Inter-RAT cell re-selection, with E-UTRAN or UTRAN CSG cells
search. A cell is considered to be a CSG cell indicated as such through a CSG Indicator (set
to TRUE) [17]. Once the strongest detected suitable cell found on a frequency is a CSG cell,
the mobile station will re-select to this cell. The search function and measurement rules are
implementation dependent.
Further details and additions regarding inbound mobility to CSG cells are described in
Chapter 4.
3.3
A Interface over IP
The A interface over IP (AoIP) refers to the solution allowing the transport of CS user plane
data over an IP protocol stack [25]. Note that the standardization of the A interface control
plane over IP was already introduced in Release 7, with the specificatio of the SIGTRAN
protocol stack for BSSAP signaling.

Legacy Architecture: A Interface User Plane over TDM
Before the introduction of the A User Plane interface over IP feature in Release 8, the
architecture of the CS domain part of a GERAN network was that described in Figure 3.10.
In this case, the A User Plane interface only uses TDM transport solutions. The codec
used on the A interface for voice services is G.711 and then transcoding takes place in the
BSS, thanks to the Transcoders (TC) located in some TRAU (Transcoder and Rate Adaptation

Unit). Alternatively, TFO (Tandem Free Operation) is also possible, allowing the tunneling of
compressed speech frames through the PCM links connecting the BSS with the Core Network.
This greatly helps to improve the voice quality but cannot save bandwidth on the A interface.
The A Control Plane interface also can either use the same TDM transport solution used for
the User Plane, or it can alternately make use of an IP-based solution, thanks to the adoption
of the SIGTRAN protocol stack, in Release 7.

tecture and the work split between the BSS and the Core Network, as shown in Figure 3.11.
This basically means that the transcoding functionality remains in the BSS, the codec used
on the A interface is still G.711 but then the solution foresees that the 64 kbit/s fl ws carrying

the CS User Plane between the BSS and the MGW are chunked into RTP/UDP/IP packets,
each carrying a 20 ms voice sample. TFO is possible also using this approach, but also in this
case this would not lead to any bandwidth savings. In general, considering that the amount
of payload bits does not change but the header of the IP protocol stack needs to be added,
the overall bandwidth requirement with this solution is not expected to decrease with respect
to the A over TDM case, unless some other optimizations are considered. One standardized
option to improve the bandwidth efficien y in this case is to adopt IP multiplexing techniques.
The main benefi of this solution is that it allows the re-use of already deployed equipments
(e.g. existing TRAUs could continue to be used, without requiring additional transcoding
resources in the MGW) at the same time adding the full fl xibility provided by IP, in terms
of connectivity, network configuration etc. One important example is the one of “MSCs in
pool”, where the connectivity of the same BSS to several MGWs is greatly simplifie by the
use of an underlying IP infrastructure.
3.3.1.3
A over IP without Transcoders in BSS
Besides the introduction of the plain IP transport solution described in Section 3.3.1.2, the A
over IP Release 8 feature also allows the transition to the same network architecture define
for 3G networks, for the CS domain.
The solution in fact allows a network configuratio
where the functional split between
the BSS and the Core Network is changed with respect to legacy architecture and where
transcoders are completely removed from the BSS and only located in the MGW, controlled
by the MSC Server, as shown in Figure 3.12.
This approach makes it possible to replace the use of PCM (G.711) on the A interface with
the more efficien transmission of compressed speech, through the packetization into 20 ms
voice samples included in RTP/UDP/IP packets. One firs benefi of this approach is that the
bandwidth utilization on the A interface is heavily reduced. Compared to the TFO scenario of

previous solutions, in this case there is no need to embed the compressed speech in the higher
bandwidth PCM stream: the speech is directly formatted into IP packets of the right size.
This also means that TrFO (Transcoder Free Operation) is made possible by this approach:
the codec to be used on both the radio and the A interfaces is negotiated between the BSS
and the MSC Server, and then – through the Core Network – with the peer system as well with
the aim of establishing a TrFO operation, using the same codec through the whole mobile-
to-mobile path and not requiring any transcoding in any part of the network. Whenever this
is possible (TrFO is established), the end-to-end voice quality greatly improves, thanks to the
lack of unnecessary transcoding operations and the reduction of the end-to-end delay.
With this solution, transcoders are only needed to cover scenarios where TrFO is not used,
that is when the codecs used on the two radio interfaces of the two legs of a mobile-to-mobile
call are incompatible with each other, so that transcoders have to be inserted.
The fact that transcoders are not always needed with this architecture highlights one more
benefi of this approach: although additional transcoder resources might be needed in the
MGWs (for instance, to take care of the needed transcoding functionality for all mobile-to-
PSTN calls), the total amount of transcoder resources in the overall network (considering the
BSS as well) is certainly lower than in legacy networks today.
3.3.2
User Plane Aspects
For both architectural A over IP solutions, the user plane information is transported via
RTP/UDP/IP packets (see Figure 3.13), each carrying a 20 ms voice sample. No specifi
solution is standardized for the Link (L2) and Physical (L1) layers [27].
Especially when compressed speech samples are transferred over this protocol stack, this can
be quite inefficien in terms of bandwidth utilization, given that the overall header size can be
higher than the payload size. To overcome this problem an optional solution has been defined
allowing the multiplexing of several RTP payload units of different user plane connections
within the same UDP/IP packet. As a further option, the RTP header can also be compressed.
The use of RTP multiplexing and RTP header compression is negotiated between the BSS
and the MGW for each user plane connection by using RTCP mechanisms.
3.3.3
Control Plane Aspects
3.3.3.1
Control Plane Principles
First of all, SIGTRAN support is a prerequisite for the support of an IP-based A User Plane
interface. This means that BSSAP messages are exchanged between the BSS and the MSC
using the SIGTRAN protocol stack, see Figure 3.14.

Protocol stack for the A Interface Control Plane over IP (SIGTRAN) [26].
Then some new principles for the A Interface Control Plane signaling have been define
[26]. The firs modificatio
is the introduction of a Transport Layer Address information
element in all the relevant BSSMAP messages. The Transport Layer Address indicates the IP
Address and the UDP Port Number used by a given endpoint to support the IP connection.
An IP connection on the A interface involves two Transport Layer Addresses: one at the BSS
side and one at the MGW side. The exchange of the Transport Layer Address information on
the A interface is realized by including the corresponding information elements in the relevant
messages between the BSS and the MSC Server, namely in the messages for the assignment
procedure at call set-up and for the different handover types.
Another modificatio is the introduction of a Call Identifie information element, as a MSC-
unique value by which an IP connection can be identifie in both the MSC Server and the
BSS. For calls using an IP-based A User Plane interface, the Call Identifie replaces the CIC
(Circuit Identificatio Code) currently used in legacy TDM-based A User Plane interfaces. Call
Identifier are assigned by the MSC server and communicated to the BSS during assignment
and inter-BSS handover procedures.
One more important principle introduced with A over IP, specificall required by the solution
of getting rid of transcoders in the BSS, is that the codecs to be used on the radio interface need
to be carefully negotiated between the BSS and the Core Network. In architectures without
transcoders in the BSS, G.711-encoded RTP packets cannot be sent on the A interface. In
this case RTP packets have to carry voice samples encoded with exactly the same compressed
speech codec used on the radio interface, and the codec choice therefore needs to be agreed
between the BSS and the MSC Server. Furthermore, in order to achieve TrFO for mobile-to-
mobile calls, codec negotiation should happen through the Core Network up to the distant
end as well, so that the same common codec is eventually selected on both radio legs, both A
interfaces and in the internal network interfaces as well. New information elements specifying
the speech codecs have therefore been added in the relevant BSSMAP messages. In particular,
at call set-up/handover, the BSS indicates to the MSC Server – in a Codec List (BSS Supported)
IE – all the codec it supports, without any specifi order. On the other hand, also the MSC
Server indicates to the BSS – in a Codec List (MSC Preferred) IE – all the codecs it supports,
in a priority order, to provide an indication of its preference (e.g. for codecs that may enable
TrFO or TFO).
3.3.3.2
Procedures
A number of BSSMAP procedures and messages have been introduced or modifie to support
A over IP. In particular, as anticipated in Section 3.3.3.1, a number of new information elements

84
GSM/EDGE
have been added at least to the messages exchanged during the assignment procedures at call
set-up and the messages used during handovers.
For each individual call, during the set-up procedure, an independent codec negotiation
procedure is performed. The BSS indicates the list of codecs it supports, in the specifi cell,
at that specifi time, in the firs message to the MSC Server (the one conveying the service
request from the mobile station). The MSC Server then determines its own ordered list of
preferred codecs and sends it back to the BSS in the assignment request message, taking into
account at least BSS, MS and MGW capabilities. However, when the goal is to establish TrFO
for a mobile-to-mobile call (which requires the architecture without transcoders in the BSS),
an end-to-end codec negotiation needs to be performed within the Core Network up to the
terminating side, and the outcome of this procedure needs to be considered when creating
the list of preferred codecs to be included in assignment request messages on the A interface.
The other new information element included by the MSC Server in the assignment request
messages is the Transport Layer Address at the MGW side, so that the BSS knows the IP/UDP
endpoint to be considered at the Core Network side for the ongoing call. If the call can
be successfully established, the BSS then answers with the assignment complete message,
including the indication of the codec which was finall chosen on the radio interface and the
Transport Layer Address at the BSS side. At this point in time, the IP connection between the
BSS and the MGW can be established, since both IP/UDP endpoints are known to each peer,
as well as the codec and the payload format to be used for RTP packets.
A new codec negotiation and a new exchange of Transport Layer Addresses need to be
performed during inter-BSS handovers as well. This is done using the handover request and
handover request acknowledge messages exchanged between the MSC Server and the target
BSS during an inter-BSS handover procedure.
On the other hand, for intra-BSS handovers, no new procedures are foreseen on the A
interface, as long as the codec used in the target cell is the same or compatible with the one
used in the source cell. In this case the payload format to be used for RTP packets stays the
same, as well as the Transport Layer Addresses used by the IP connection on the A interface.
The exception is the case of intra-BSS handovers, including intra-cell ones, requiring a
codec in the target cell which is incompatible with the one in the source. This can happen,
for instance, in overload situations when a transition from EFR to HR codecs is required.
In this case, a new codec needs to be negotiated and new Transport Layer Addresses need
to be exchanged. A new optimized three-way signaling procedure has been define to cover
this scenario, called “BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support”, to be used in place of the
existing inter-BSS handover procedure. The BSS starts with a new Internal Handover Required
message, indicating the target cell, the updated list of supported codecs and the new Transport
Layer Address at the BSS side for the new radio channel termination. The MSC Server would
then respond with a new Internal Handover Command message, indicating the chosen codec
and the new Transport Layer Address at the MGW side. The BSS can finall
confir
the
success of the handover procedure by sending the Handover Complete message.
3.4
Multi-Carrier BTS (MCBTS)
Throughout the operation of GSM/EDGE networks reducing capital and operational expen-
ditures has been a main focus of mobile operators to increase their operating profit Since the

3GPP Release 8
85
population of BTSs with multiple single carrier transceivers is large compared to other network
elements, for example a single Base Station Controller (BSC) may serve about 200 to 500
BTSs, cost improvements in the BTS largely impact an operator’s CAPEX and OPEX figures
The introduction of base stations based on a multicarrier architecture – Multi-carrier BTS – is
expected to yield cost improvements as further described in Section 3.4.2. It also provides the
adequate hardware platform for operating multiple 3GPP radio technologies simultaneously.
This section provides an overview of MCBTS, an evolution of Base Transceiver Station
(BTS) hardware platforms; and of its standardization. The functional description is then
introduced, followed by detailed standardization and regulatory aspects. It should be noted that
the standardization of GSM MCBTS in 3GPP Release 8 is closely related to the standardization
of multicarrier multi-standard base stations in 3GPP Release 9 supporting multiple 3GPP
radio access technologies by a single wideband transceiver. This is further addressed in
Chapter 14.
3.4.1
Overview
The concept of applying a multicarrier architecture in GSM was investigated several years ago.
Driven by progress in component technology on one hand, and the introduction of wideband
mobile radio systems such as WCDMA, on the other, wideband power amplifier (PA) have
become widely available. Approved for deployment in the US by the FCC in the year 2000
for GSM 850 MHz and PCS 1900 MHz frequency bands, both for single GSM deployment
mode and for mixed deployment mode with TIA/IS-54 systems using 30 kHz narrowband
carriers, relaxations of unwanted emissions based on the usage of wideband power amplifier
were introduced in GSM Release 99 specifications
GSM Multicarrier BTS was introduced in 3GPP Release 8 specification in 2009. The
discussion started in 2006 for deployment in the GSM 900 MHz and DCS 1800 MHz frequency
bands [28] and was extended to cover the GSM 400 MHz, GSM 700 MHz, GSM 850 MHz
and PCS 1900 MHz frequency bands as well.
3.4.2
Functional Description
In the past, the architecture of GSM/EDGE base stations, hereafter referred to as “GSM
Normal BTS”, generally followed the concept of one transceiver (TRX) per carrier comprising
a transmitter and a receiver unit. BTSs with multiple carriers were realized by combining the
carriers behind the power amplifier with passive components, for example using 3 dB hybrids
or tunable RF filters and by passively splitting the received antenna signal towards multiple
receivers. Figure 3.15 shows the architecture of a GSM Normal BTS operating four carriers.
This architecture is also referred to as single carrier BTS (SCBTS).
Technological progress in transmitter and receiver design permitted implementation of BTSs
for 2G and 3G radio access technologies (GSM, EDGE, UMTS, cdma2000 R⃝), that are capable
of processing multiple carriers within a single wideband transmitter/receiver unit. In the case
of GSM/EDGE, such BTSs are called GSM Multicarrier Base Stations (GSM MCBTS).
The differences between the Multicarrier BTS architecture and the Normal BTS architecture
are obvious from a comparison of Figure 3.15 and Figure 3.16.

Traditional architecture of a Normal BTS with single carrier transceivers.
In particular, the MCBTS architecture consisting of a wideband transmitter and receiver has
several advantages:
1. Higher integration level of RF components. The analog RF components, that is mixers,
amplifiers oscillators, filters etc., are needed only once per antenna instead of once per
carrier. The per-carrier circuitries are shifted to the digital part where they can be integrated
into a few chips of silicon.
2. Improved power efficienc . The huge loss of energy in the passive TX combiner (75% in
case of traditional SCBTS architecture, see Figure 3.15) is avoided because the carriers
are combined in the digital domain, that is by a mathematical ADD operation on digitized
carrier signals, and the multicarrier PA output goes directly to the antenna via the duplex
filte . This results in better power efficien y of the BTS when multiple carriers are to be
transmitted over one antenna, which is the more efficient the more carriers are sent per
antenna and the more combiner stages would be needed in the traditional architecture.
3. Reduced complexity of antenna systems. Operators benefi from higher integration level of
GSM MCBTS architecture reducing site requirements, in particular reduced complexity of
the antenna systems. This finall translates into reduced costs of MCBTS installation and
maintenance per each radio site.
4. Flexibility to split the total available output power between carriers. The composite output
power of the GSM MCBTS is split between all active carriers, thus the maximum output
power per carrier depends on the number of active carriers. A GSM MCBTS, for example,

may have a composite power of 80 watts and thus support different carrier configurations
for instance, 1 carrier with up to 80 watts output power, 2 carriers with up to 40 watts per
carrier, 4 carriers with up to 20 watts per carrier and 8 carriers with up to 10 watts per
carrier. In addition, the carrier power can be assigned on a more fl xible basis, for example
higher carrier power can be assigned to the BCCH carrier or to the carriers belonging to the
frequency layer operating data services requiring a high CIR, while the carriers belonging
to the frequency layer for voice services may require less output power per carrier due to
lower required CIR.
The concept of multicarrier BTS can be realized in different ways: either the multicarrier
transceiver is included in the ground-mounted BTS cabinet or it is tower-mounted as part of a
Remote Radio Head (RRH) solution. Implementation and operation of MCBTSs nevertheless
require a few relaxations and changes of the emission characteristics for GSM MCBTS that
are described in Sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.4.
3.4.3
Impact of Usage of MCBTS on Unwanted Emissions
The usage of wideband transmitters for multicarrier transmission in GSM affects the level of
unwanted emissions outside the wanted channel, in that these emissions are higher than for
traditional single carrier BTS. This section describes the sources of these increased emissions
and their contribution to the unwanted emissions.
3.4.3.1
Main Sources of Unwanted Emissions in the MCBTS Transmitter
The main sources of the unwanted emissions in the MCBTS transmitter are:
1. D/A converter. Due to the incoming digital wideband multi-carrier signal, the D/A converter
needs to operate a wider signal bandwidth and a higher input dynamic range compared
against a narrowband signal input to a TRX of a SCBTS. Hence a larger portion of am-
plitude and phase noise is generated leading to broader noise spectrum, which contributes
to a higher level of wideband noise emissions over the maximum supported RF band-
width of the MCBTS and several MHz beyond. In addition, spurious emissions occur at
certain frequencies, that is at harmonics of the D/A converter clock frequencies and their
intermodulation products.
2. RF-modulator. The dominant source of unwanted emissions in the analog RF modulator is
the phase noise generated in the I/Q modulator, in the TX variable gain amplifie and also in
the RF synthesizers. Due to the incoming wideband signal this phase noise is translated into
a broader noise spectrum which contributes to higher level of wideband noise emissions.
In addition, spurious emissions are generated due to oscillator leakage and intermodulation
products of the mixer stages.
3. Multi-carrier power amplifie . A major technological challenge for using wideband power
amplifier for transmission of multiple narrowband GSM signals with a bandwidth of
200 kHz is the nonlinear characteristic of such amplifiers This characteristic affects the
level of unwanted emissions, introduced by those nonlinearities typically characterized by
AM/AM and AM/PM compression curves. In contrast to a GMSK single carrier having
constant amplitude, in the multicarrier case, due to the AM component, these nonlinearities

88
GSM/EDGE
yield to intermodulation products transmitted in addition to the multiple carriers over the
air interface. The generation of these intermodulation products is considered in more detail
in the following section.
3.4.3.2
Transmitter Intermodulations10
Transmitter intermodulation products are a major source of unwanted emissions. They are
generated due to nonlinearities in the transmitter, when several signals are processed in a
common active element [29]. For MCBTS, the multicarrier power amplifie is the dominating
source of these intermodulation products. Among different orders of the generated intermodu-
lation products, third, fift and seventh order intermodulation products are most relevant since
they may fall into or are close to the transmit band and hence are an additional source of
interference to mobile receivers.
The transfer function of an active element input with M signals Si can be described by a
Taylor series of powers as follows:
Sout =
∞

n=1
cn · (S1 + S2 + . . . + SM)n
(3.1)
The value of the power index n, equals at the same time the order of intermodulation, as this
describes the number of signals involved in the process. Normally the factor cn is decreasing
rapidly with the power index that is with the intermodulation order and only odd intermodula-
tion orders, that is 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc. may fall inside the GSM transmit or receive bands. Thus
the most important intermodulation products to consider are the 3rd, 5th and 7th order.
The third order intermodulation products from M carriers located between f1 and fM may
be found at
|2 · fa −fb|
and also at
| fa + fb + fc|
for any combination of a, b and c in the range 1 to M and where fa, fb and fc are the center
frequencies of carriers a, b and c. These products can be found for offsets up to | f1 −fM|
outside the group of carriers. Another characteristic of these products is the broadening of
spectrum. When assuming GMSK signals and 200 kHz channels, the 3rd order intermodulation
(IM3) products have a bandwidth of about 600 kHz and thus will occur at the adjacent
channels as well, with a 3 dB lower power than on the channels at the center frequency of the
intermodulation.

3GPP Release 8
89
Similarly, the 5th order intermodulation products may be found at
|3 · fa −2 · fb|, |3 · fa −( fb + fc)|, |2 · fa + fb −2 · fc|, |2 · fa + fb −( fc + fd)|,
| fa + fb + fc −2 · fd| and also on | fa + fb + fc −( fd + fe)|
for any combination of a, b, c, d and e in the range 1 to M and where fa, fb, fc, fd and fe
are the center frequencies of carriers a, b, c, d and e. These products may be found for offsets
up to 2 · | f1 −fM| outside the group of carriers. For this case the spectrum broadening is
higher, since the 5th order intermodulation (IM5) products have a bandwidth of about 1000
kHz, however, the power is 2 to 2.5 dB lower in the adjacent 200 kHz channels than on the
channels at the center frequency of the intermodulation.
Finally, 7th order intermodulation (IM7) products may be found for offsets up to 3 · | f1 −
fM| outside the group of carriers. In general, they have a much lower power than 3rd and 5th
order intermodulation products.
If the carriers are equally spaced in frequency, several 3rd order and 5th order and higher
order intermodulation products will coincide on the same frequencies and add up, thus creating
the maximum amplitude of the intermodulation products. The highest amplitude can be found
closest to the carriers, that is next to the outermost carrier of the MCBTS allocation, and the
amplitude decreases by increasing frequency offset.
An example of a power spectrum of a GSM MCBTS, normalized to the carrier power
level, including wideband noise emission and intermodulation products with 3 equally spaced
carriers using 1 MHz spacing and equal power is shown in Figure 3.17.

In Figure 3.17 the 3rd order intermodulation products identifying the dominant intermodu-
lation products are located between −3 and 3 MHz, that is at 1 and 2 MHz frequency offsets
on both sides of the outermost carriers. The 5th order intermodulation products are located
between −5 and 5 MHz, that is between 1 and 4 MHz frequency offsets on both sides of the
outermost carriers. Higher order intermodulation products, such as the 7th order IM located
between −7 and 7 MHz, that is between 1 and 6 MHz frequency offsets on both sides of the
outermost carriers, are much lower compared to 3rd and 5th order IM and hence may even not
exceed the wideband noise level.
If the number of active carriers M is reduced, while keeping the same output power for the
active ones, the power of 3rd and 5th order intermodulation products is rapidly reduced as the
coefficient c3 and c5 remain the same and fewer products add up.
3.4.3.3
Mitigation of Unwanted Emissions in the MCBTS Transmitter
To mitigate distortions in the transmitter one essential technique is the usage of predistortion in
the transmitter branch. Recent fast digital signal processing devices execute the predistortion
in the digital domain. An exemplary block diagram of the digital predistortion in a multicarrier
base station is depicted in Figure 3.18.
The predistortion is executed by means of a control loop including a feedback branch
and a nonlinear Digital Adaptive Pre-Distortion (DAPD) of the digital signal. The distorted
multicarrier signal output from the multicarrier PA (MCPA) is demodulated into baseband and
converted into the digital domain. The sampled distorted transmit signal is then equalized by a
training model by applying the estimated inverse transfer function of the nonlinear distortion

in the forward branch. The error between ideal, that is the undistorted transmit signal and the
equalized distorted transmit signal is then calculated. The error signal is input into a control
block which dynamically adjusts the digital predistortion block in the transmitter forward
branch by adding a time variant digital correction signal, so that the error signal is minimized.
An exemplary power spectrum of a GSM MCBTS with three carriers using predistortion
means is shown in Figure 3.19.
It can be seen that the level of unwanted emissions, in particular of the dominant 3rd order
and 5th order intermodulation products can be remarkably decreased.
3.4.3.4
Spurious Emissions
Spurious emissions are generated at distinct frequencies due to oscillator leakage of the RF
synthesizers, intermodulation products generated in the analog TX stages and unwanted mixing
products of the D/A converter as depicted above. Due to the increased operating bandwidth of
the transmitter compared to a narrowband single carrier transmitter, more spurious emissions
fall into the operating bandwidth and hence the MCBTS generates a higher level of spurious
emissions in the operated bandwidth and at frequencies close to it. This has been considered
in the standardization by the definitio of relaxed requirements for inband and out-of-band
spurious emissions as depicted in the next section.

GSM/EDGE
3.4.4
Standardization in 3GPP TSG GERAN
The operation of a GSM MCBTS requires a few relaxations and changes of the emission
characteristics for MCBTS that were introduced into the core specificatio 3GPP TS 45.005
and to the BTS conformance test specificatio 3GPP TS 51.021 in Release 8. These changes
are summarized in this section.
3.4.4.1
Definitio of MCBTS Classes
Due to the expressed interest of operators in 3GPP TSG GERAN to allow different levels of
improved power efficien y of MCBTS, thereby impacting the linearization performance of
the MCBTS, 3GPP TSG GERAN has standardized two MCBTS classes with different levels
of relaxation compared to radio requirements for state-of-the-art single carrier BTS, namely:
r MCBTS class 1 allowing unwanted emissions of up to −70 dB relative to the carrier power
at frequencies where intermodulation products are expected and at their adjacent channel
frequencies.
r MCBTS class 2 allowing the same level of relaxation as MCBTS class 1 and additionally a
further relaxed level of unwanted emissions of up to −60 dB relative to the carrier power at
frequencies where 3rd order intermodulation products can be expected and at their adjacent
channel frequencies. Performance compliant to this MCBTS class is shown in Figure 3.19
(with predistortion).
Due to the relaxed intermodulation attenuation requirements for MCBTS class 2 compared
to MCBTS class 1, MCBTS class 2 is expected to yield a higher power efficien y, that is a
reduced power consumption of the wideband transmitter, than MCBTS class 1.
In addition, the manufacturer needs to declare the maximum supported RF bandwidth for the
MCBTS, the supported carrier configuration with specifie maximum power level per carrier,
assuming equal power distribution among the carriers, and the supported modulation types.
The different intermodulation attenuation requirements for both MCBTS classes specifie
in sub-clause 4.7 of 3GPP TS 45.005 led to different requirements for the spectrum due to
modulation and wideband noise applied to the frequency range close the MCBTS carrier
allocation inside the transmit frequency band (see Section 3.4.4.3) as well as for out-of-band
spurious emissions outside the transmit frequency band (see Section 3.4.4.4). The MCBTS
performance specificatio is based on equal or even frequency spacing for all active MCBTS
carriers as described later in this section. In most test cases the carriers have equal power, but
the performance requirements are also verifie by applying an unequal power profil to all
declared configuration of active MCBTS carriers. For example, for the case of four active
MCBTS carriers, two carriers have a transmit power 2 dB higher and two carriers a transmit
power 4 dB lower than for the equal power profile
3.4.4.2
Study of System Impacts Through the Introduction of GSM MCBTS
System impacts due to the introduction of GSM MCBTS have been investigated in 3GPP
TSG GERAN for different coexistence scenarios by simulating a GSM aggressor network
with MCBTS base stations transmitting on all carriers with maximum transmit power and a

3GPP Release 8
93
non-coordinated GSM victim network employing single carrier BTS and RF power control
in the adjacent frequency allocation being interfered with by the aggressor network both
in downlink and in uplink. In particular, system impacts caused by higher intra BSS TX
intermodulation distortion on the transmitter side of the aggressor network and lower inband
blocking performance due to use of a wideband receiver architecture on the receiver side of
the GSM MCBTS network have been analysed. The conclusion of these studies was that the
relaxations due to the introduction of both MCBTS classes did not yield higher call drop
rates in case of voice calls or yielded a noticeable degradation of EGPRS/EGPRS2 throughput
performance [30].
3.4.4.3
Spectrum Due to Modulation and Wideband Noise
Being part of the unwanted emissions close to the allocation of the wanted carrier, the spectrum
due to modulation and wideband noise, specifie in sub-clause 4.2.1 of 3GPP TS 45.005, is
measured for state-of-the-art SCBTS on both sides of the allocation of the wanted carrier with
up to 2 MHz outside the operated BSS transmit band being typically a subset of the relevant
transmit band, for example a SCBTS may operate the frequency range 940–955 MHz as part
of the P-GSM 900 band. For MCBTS, the spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise is
measured for several configurations that is for all supported number of carriers, on both outer
sides of the group of carriers belonging to a contiguous MCBTS frequency allocation up to
10 MHz outside the RF bandwidth excluding the measurement locations where intermodulation
products are expected. In fact, the relaxation of this radio requirement for MCBTS is only
minor, since the method used when creating a transmission mask for MCBTS with M carriers
is derived from the equivalent requirement resulting from the aggregation of M single-carrier
transceivers connected to one antenna port:
r for frequency offsets up to 1.8 MHz from the outermost MCBTS carrier the transmission
mask is identifie by the aggregated wideband noise of all MCBTS carriers based on the
existing mask for spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise for single carrier and
taking into account the offset between each carrier allocation and the measurement point for
wide band noise;
r for frequency offsets beyond 1.8 MHz from the outermost MCBTS carrier, the transmission
mask is identifie by determining the mask for the dominant outermost MCBTS carrier and
adding a multicarrier offset factor 10 × log10(M) where M is the number of active carriers.
Note, most of the relaxation of this radio requirement for MCBTS compared against SCBTS
stems from an increased number of exceptions, where a higher level of unwanted emissions is
granted than for SCBTS, that is the level is based on the relative intermodulation attenuation
of the respective MCBTS class (see Section 3.4.4.1) rather than on the absolute power level
of −36 dBm as define for SCBTS.
For verificatio purposes, the requirement for spectrum due to modulation and wideband
noise and the intermodulation requirement are tested together. The specificatio prescribes
using different carrier spacings for the test, that is a minimum carrier spacing based on
600 kHz and a maximum carrier spacing, resulting from the spread of the carriers over the
maximum RF bandwidth of the MCBTS, which typically lies between 10 and 20 MHz. In
the latter case, the spread of carriers is even, that is two carriers are allocated at the lowest

and highest carrier frequencies of the maximum RF bandwidth and the remaining carriers are
located evenly in between, so that the spacing between adjacent carriers may only vary in a
range +/−200 kHz.
The requirements for spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise need to be met also for
the case of non-contiguous frequency blocks. This applies to deployments where the operator
has a split frequency allocation, the carriers of which are operated by MCBTS. This scenario
is relevant in several European countries, in India, in the US and in other countries. The core
specificatio 3GPP TS 45.005 prescribes that the MCBTS manufacturer declares the support
of split frequency allocation. This capability needs to be verifie through test of a configuratio
with four active MCBTS carriers, where two pairs of carriers, each using the minimum carrier
spacing of 600 kHz, are separated so that an interim UMTS, HSPA or LTE carrier with
5 MHz bandwidth can be allocated between the pairs of carriers. Figure 3.20 depicts this test
scenario. Note that in this figure unwanted emissions consist of spectrum due to modulation
and wideband noise as well as the dominating 3rd and 5th orders intermodulation products.
The measured range of the unwanted emissions is x MHz.
3.4.4.4
Spurious Emissions
Spurious emissions specifie in sub-clause 4.3 in 3GPP TS 45.005 can be distinguished into
inband and out-of-band spurious emissions. Inband spurious emissions are measured within
the transmit frequency band (e.g. 935 MHz to 960 MHz for P-GSM MCBTS and 925 MHz
to 960 MHz for E-GSM MCBTS). For MCBTS, no separate requirement for inband spurious
emissions, measured from 2 MHz beyond the outermost carrier until the edge of the transmit
frequency band on both sides, exists as for SCBTS; instead the requirements define
for
spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise apply in this frequency range for MCBTS.
Out-of-band spurious emissions are measured outside the transmit frequency band with an
offset greater than 2 MHz and need to comply with absolute power levels. A relaxation of up
to 10 dB is granted for MCBTS class 1 and of up to 20 dB for MCBTS class 2 compared to
SCBTS for offsets lower than 5 MHz from the transmit frequency band edge, while for larger

offsets beyond 10 MHz the size of the relaxation is at most 9 dB compared to SCBTS due
to different used measurement methods (average detector instead of peak-hold). For offsets
between 5 MHz and 10 MHz a linear interpolation of the out-of-band spurious emissions
requirements is specified which takes into account the additional attenuation of the duplexer
filte in the MCBTS. This is depicted in Figure 3.21.
3GPP TSG GERAN agreed that the out-of-band spurious emissions requirements are based
on the most stringent requirement between the absolute power mask, as shown in Figure
3.21 for GSM 900, and the unwanted emission requirements define by the cumulated mask
composed by the spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise and the intermodulation
products. Thus, for a MCBTS operating far from the band edge the unwanted emission
requirements as depicted in Sections 3.4.4.1 and 3.4.4.3 apply, while the absolute power mask
is valid for a MCBTS operating close or at the band edge.
3.4.4.5
Inband Receiver Blocking
A MCBTS including a MCPA may also be equipped with a multicarrier wideband receiver as
shown in Figure 3.16, or else it may be operated with multiple single carrier receivers. In the
firs case the selectivity of the analog receiver front-end is decreased compared to a narrowband
single carrier receiver which yields reduced inband receiver blocking performance. Another
limitation exists in the restricted dynamic range of current A/D converters, which in the case

of a wideband GSM receiver need to operate with a dynamic range of about 100 dB, being
about 20 dB above current available technology.
Inband receiver blocking is created, when a mobile station is transmitting with high power
in the same frequency band close to the wanted channel and at the same time is located close
to the receiving base station. This situation will not appear if the mobile is registered to the
same network as the base station thanks to uplink power control. However, if the mobile is
registered to a different network and the serving base station is far away from the mobile, this
effect may occur if there is no coordination between the operators of the networks. Figure 3.22
depicts the situation of receiver blocking.
A mobile station MS 1 attached on frequency f1 to a distant BTS site of Network 1 owned
by operator A is located close to a BTS site of Network 2 owned by operator B, serving a
mobile station MS 2 on frequency f2 and no network coordination between operator A and B
is in place. Thus the MS 1 transmits a high power signal on uplink on frequency f1 which may
be close or even adjacent to the frequency f2, thus yielding potential blocking of the reception
of the signal, coming from MS2, at the BTS site of the Network 2. The impact of such blocking
signals is the more severe the closer it is transmitting to the wanted channel in the frequency
domain. Such high power levels will occur mainly in dense urban areas but with a rather
small probability. However, due to complete blocking of the BTS receiver, they can lead to
an amount of dropped calls that is not acceptable within GSM networks. For MCBTS with a
wideband receiver, this problem is more evident than for SCBTS or for MCBTS with single
carrier receivers due to the reduced receiver selectivity and the restricted input dynamic range
as depicted above. Among the different alternatives, 3GPP TSG GERAN agreed to specify
for a MCBTS with a wideband receiver two additional relaxation levels for inband receiver
blocking, allowing a larger desensitization than for SCBTS, that is a larger degradation of the
receiver sensitivity. This means that in case of strong RX blockers, the receiver AGC is biased
towards reception of strong signals, thus allowing for the usage of available A/D converter
technology with restricted dynamic range.
SCBTS receiver blocking performance is stated in 3GPP TS 45.005 subclause 5.1, for exam-
ple for GSM 400 MHz and GSM 900 MHz frequency bands and for a blocking signal offset by
3 MHz or more from the wanted channel, the receiver reference sensitivity performance must
be met with a blocker signal up to −13 dBm and with a wanted signal level at −101 dBm
(3 dB above the BTS receiver reference sensitivity level of −104 dBm) as stated in 3GPP TS
45.005. For a blocker signal closer to the wanted signal, that is between 800 kHz and 3 MHz,
the receiver reference performance needs to be met with a blocker signal up to −16 dBm at
the input signal level of −101 dBm.

Inband RX blocking level mask for SCBTS and MCBTS in 900 MHz band depending on
the frequency offset of the blocking signal from the wanted channel.
For SCBTS, MCBTS class 1 and MCBTS class 2, the receiver blocking performance
is shown in Figure 3.23. Three blocking limits are define
for GSM 400 MHz and GSM
900 MHz frequency band both for MCBTS class 1 and class 2:
1. First blocking limit at 3 dB desensitization. The receiver reference performance must be
met for the same conditions as for SCBTS, that is for a wanted signal at −101 dBm with a
blocker signal up to −25 dBm, yielding a relaxation of 9 dB in case the blocker is 0.8–3 MHz
apart from the wanted channel and a relaxation of 12 dB if it is more than 3 MHz
apart.
2. Second blocking limit at 8 dB desensitization. The reference receiver performance must be
met with a blocker level of up to −20 dBm and a signal level of −96 dBm, that is allowing
a further desensitization of 5 dB related to firs blocking limit.
3. Third blocking limit at 12 dB desensitization. The reference receiver performance must be
met with a blocker level of up to −16 dBm and a signal level of −92 dBm, that is allowing
a further desensitization of 9 dB related to firs blocking limit.
Note, for the low frequency bands GSM 700 MHz and GSM 850 MHz as well as for the high
frequency bands such as DCS 1800 MHz and PCS 1900 MHz, the same inband RX blocking
levels are specifie as for SCBTS. For instance, for DCS 1800 MHz and PCS 1900 MHz, a
blocking limit of −25 dBm for blocker offsets at 800 kHz and above and a limit of −35 dBm
below 800 kHz is required. Hence there is no relaxation introduced for both MCBTS classes
for these frequency bands.
3.4.5
Status in Regulatory Bodies
While 3GPP TSG GERAN has investigated in particular inband coexistence of GSM MCBTS
with other public GSM networks, as depicted in Section 3.4.4.2, coexistence studies of GSM
MCBTS with services in the same band such as UMTS 900 MHz or UMTS 1800 MHz and in

98
GSM/EDGE
the adjacent band such as GSM Railway (GSM-R) and Private Access Mobile Radio (PAMR)
below the GSM 900 MHz band, aeronautic systems like radio navigation service (ARNS)
and distance measurement equipments (DME) above the GSM 900 MHz band, DECT above
DCS 1800 MHz band and military systems in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands have been
undertaken in 3GPP TSG RAN 4 (UMTS 900, UMTS 1800), in CEPT ECC SE7 (military
systems) and in CEPT ECC PT1 (the remainder), concluding that GSM MCBTS does not
yield additional degradation for coexistence with other systems in adjacent bands compared
to existing GSM single carrier BTS. Some restrictions have been identifie for the coexistence
with DME systems, in particular in case DME systems are deployed in European countries
in the frequency range 962–977 MHz, which is located directly above the GSM 900 MHz
downlink frequency band. In particular, the coexistence study in ECC PT1 concluded that only
in case DME systems are deployed using the lower edge channel at 962 MHz, interference
mitigation techniques, that is usage of RF power control on downlink by the operator using
GSM MCBTS or other techniques to reduce the radiated power of the MCBTS over the air,
may be prescribed by national regulators to achieve sufficien isolation. For the European
telecommunication market, the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) and
technical committee TC MSG is responsible for issuing the new Harmonized Standard for
GSM base stations including MCBTS. Recently ETSI TC MSG has approved the Release 8
version of the Harmonized Standard for GSM base stations [31] including both GSM features
EGPRS2 and MCBTS. For the latter one ETSI TC MSG has approved one set of requirements
corresponding to MCBTS class 2 in 3GPP TSG GERAN. The authors’ expectation is that the
new Harmonized Standard for GSM base stations will presumably be published during the
second half of 2010.

Introduction
Given the huge market penetration of GSM/EDGE worldwide and the interest of numerous
operators to keep running the technology for at least the coming decade; given its increasing
footprint in countries such as India, China and other emerging markets where demographics
and/or network topology pose new challenges; given the coming deployment of LTE, the
expansion of 3G/HSPA and the growing interest of mobile operators to enter the home envi-
ronment; given all these and other reasons, new evolutionary steps are being define for GSM
within 3GPP Release 9. These involve both the radio access and the core parts of the network
and can be classifie into four major categories:
1. Evolution of voice and data services. The evolution of voice services, described in Section
4.2, is addressed by the introduction of “VAMOS”, a feature aiming to double the hardware
and spectral efficiencie for speech. The evolution of (packet) data services, treated in Sec-
tion 4.3, targets further EGPRS and EGPRS2 throughput increase by means of a spectrally
wider transmit pulse shape.
2. Enhanced mobility with Home NodeBs and Home eNodeBs. While mobility between
GERAN cells (typically macro cells) and UMTS home cells (Home NodeB) or LTE home
cells (Home eNodeB) is restricted to autonomous reselection by the mobile station in Re-
lease 8, it is extended to cover network-controlled mechanisms in Release 9, that is during
an ongoing data session and/or an ongoing voice call. The mechanisms introduced are
depicted in more detail in Section 4.4.
3. Security enhancements. Since the introduction of GSM, security mechanisms have been in
place to protect network operators and users against malicious attacks from third parties.
Section 4.5 summarizes the evolution of security in GSM from the early days to 3GPP
Release 9.

4. Network architecture evolution. Network architecture evolution is based on the standard-
ization of local switching for local calls as part of 3GPP Release 9. The feature “Local Call
Local Switch” switches calls locally in the Base Station Subsystem (BSS) with minimal
impact on the core network (CN) and thus leads to considerable OPEX savings in terms
of reduced bandwidth, especially in the BSS internal interfaces, but possibly also on the A
interface and on the core network interfaces. It is dealt with in Section 4.6.
These main 3GPP Release 9 features are described in the following sections in more detail
and for each of them an outlook is provided. It is noted that the introduction of multicarrier
multi-standard base stations (MSR) identifie a further Rel-9 feature in 3GPP GERAN. It is
described in more detail in Section 14.4.
4.2
Voice Evolution
4.2.1
Introduction
A continuous evolution of voice services has taken place ever since GSM Phase 1 (see Chapter
1), in terms of both speech codecs and radio interface efficien y. It is summarized here.
Voice Evolution before 3GPP Release 9
Speech in GSM started with the support of the Full Rate speech codec (FR) [2] yielding a
source bit rate of 13 kbit/s. FR is based on the RPE/LTP-LPC1,2 speech encoding algorithm.
It was selected by CEPT in 1987 for GSM Phase 1 and later used in network deployments in
the early 1990s. Through the introduction of GSM Half Rate codec (HR) [3] in GSM Phase 2
in 1995 with a source bit rate of 5.6 kbit/s based on the VSELP3 speech encoding algorithm,
voice capacity could be doubled compared to FR. However, the speech quality suffered, as
witnessed by a MOS4 up to 3.3, compared to FR speech which achieved a MOS up to 3.5 [7].
Thus operators primarily use HR for mitigation of traffi peaks, for example during busy hours.
It was later in GSM Phase 2 that a new speech codec was introduced: Enhanced Full Rate
(EFR) [4]. EFR has a source bit rate of 12.2 kbit/s and is based on CELP5 speech encoding
algorithm. It brings a considerable improvement in speech quality compared to FR with a
MOS up to 4.0 [7].
Another evolutionary step was taken with the introduction of Adaptive Multi-Rate speech
codec (AMR) [5] in GSM Phase 2+ in Release 98. AMR is based on the A-CELP6 speech
encoding algorithm. It supports source bit rates between 4.75 and 12.2 kbit/s enabling link
and codec adaptation to suit not only the radio environment but also capacity requirements.
Indeed, AMR channel coding is define both for GMSK full-rate channels (TCH/AFS) for
all codec modes and for GMSK half-rate channels (TCH/AHS) for 4.75 kbit/s to 7.95 kbit/s

2 LPC: Linear Predictive Coding.
3 VSELP: Vector-sum Excited Linear Prediction.
4 Mean Opinion Score or MOS is a metric which for speech measures the quality of a given codec, as evaluated by
subjective tests. MOS ranges from 1 to 5 and indicates a quality expanding from Bad (1) to Excellent (5) (and going
through Poor (2), Fair (3) and Good (4)) [1].

codec modes. Like FR and EFR, AMR operates narrowband speech (i.e. at POTS7 wireline
voice quality). Voice is sampled at 8 kHz and filtere to just 3.1 kHz (0.3–3.4 kHz), hence its
name “narrowband AMR” (AMR-NB). AMR-NB speech quality not only outperforms EFR
with a MOS slightly above 4.1 but it is also much better in degrading radio conditions [7].
Later, in Release 5, AMR-NB support was define
on 8-PSK half-rate channels, for all
codec modes (O-TCH/AHS). In the same release, the use of the Wideband AMR speech codec
(AMR-WB) [6] was introduced in GERAN specifications Voice is sampled at 16 kHz, and
filtere
to 7 kHz (50 Hz–7 kHz) thus designed to support audio signals such as music. It
has nine codec modes,8 fi e of which can be used in GSM (6.60, 8.85, 12.65, 15.85 and
23.85 kbit/s). AMR-WB is supported through the use of 8-PSK full-rate channels
(O-TCH/WFS) for all codec modes. Codec modes up to and including 12.65 kbit/s are sup-
ported through the use of GMSK full-rate channels (TCH/WFS) and 8-PSK half-rate channels
(O-TCH/WHS). Speech quality with AMR-WB reaches a MOS up to 4.2 [8].
Voice Evolution in 3GPP Release 9
Given the high demand for voice services in current GSM/EDGE networks and the general
interest of mobile network operators to reduce operational costs, a new feature to boost
the spectral efficien y of voice in GSM is, at the time of writing, being specifie in 3GPP
Release 9. It should indeed be noted that Release 7, as seen in Chapter 2, focused on data.
By fittin more speech users on given radio resources, not only does this feature free radio
resources in order to serve more data users with higher data rates (e.g. using Downlink Dual
Carrier EGPRS and/or EGPRS2), it can also be used to help release part of a GSM network’s
spectrum while not affecting its capacity, for example for re-farming purposes.
4.2.2
Objectives
The objectives of this later evolution as agreed by 3GPP [9] are classifie into performance
objectives and compatibility objectives as summarized below:
r Performance objectives. Capacity improvements at the BTS: increase of Hardware Efficien y
by doubling voice capacity per BTS transceiver for various (GMSK) full rate and half rate
speech traffi channels (and associated signaling channels) for FR, HR, EFR, AMR-NB and
AMR-WB, that is TCH/FS, TCH/HS, TCH/EFS, TCH/AFS, TCH/AHS and TCH/WFS.
Capacity improvements at the air interface: increase of Spectral Efficien y by enhancing
voice capacity by means of multiplexing at least two users simultaneously on the same radio
resource both in downlink and in uplink for the channel types listed previously.
r Compatibilityobjectives. Inorder toallow deployment inpotentiallyall GSM/EDGE markets
and to minimize the impact of the new feature on existing networks and mobile stations
while avoiding additional costs for voice-only handsets, fi e compatibility objectives are
defined
r Maintenance of voice quality: voice quality as perceived by the user should not decrease
and a voice quality better than GSM HR should be ensured, taking into account the
7 POTS: Plain Old Telephone Service.
8 6.60, 8.85, 12.65, 14.25, 15.85, 18.25, 19.85, 23.05 and 23.85 kbit/s.

GSM/EDGE
influenc of the inter-channel interference (ICI) on voice quality, originating from the
simultaneous activity of users in the same radio resource.
r Support of legacy mobile stations: no implementation impact should be required for legacy
mobile station types. Besides, these mobiles should be included in the multiplexing. Given
the nature of the feature, the priority is given to multiplexing of legacy DARP Phase 1
mobiles. However, mobiles not supporting DARP Phase 1 are also considered.
r Implementation impact on new mobile stations: hardware changes for new mobile stations
should be avoided. Additional complexity in terms of processing power and memory
should be kept to a minimum.
r Implementation impact on BSS: hardware upgrades to the BSS should be avoided. BTS
transceivers need to support new and legacy channel types serving all kinds of legacy
mobile stations simultaneously as per the above objectives. Impact on the dimensioning
of resources on the BTS-BSC interface (Abis) should be minimized.
r Impact on network planning: impact on network planning and frequency reuse should be
minimized. Impact on legacy MS interfered on downlink through the deployment of the
new technique should be avoided in the case of usage of a wider transmit pulse shape in
the downlink. Also scenarios related to the usage of the feature at the band edge should
be considered, that is at the edge of an operator’s band allocation and in country border
regions without frequency coordination.
4.2.3
Functional Description
As agreed in 3GPP, a new feature meeting the objectives listed above is being specifie at
the time of writing. “VAMOS” or Voice over Adaptive Multi-user channels on One Slot is
based on the concept of Orthogonal Sub-channels (OSC) and on the use, in the downlink, of
the QPSK modulation of which the symbol constellation can be adjusted (Adaptive Symbol
Constellation).VAMOS aims at multiplexing on the same radio resources twice as many speech
users per channel mode, thus allowing on a single GSM time slot either:
r up to four half-rate voice traffi channels; or
r up to two half-rate voice traffi channels and one full-rate voice traffi channel; or
r up to two full-rate voice traffi channels.
The functional concept of this technique is described for downlink and uplink in the following
subsections.
4.2.3.1
Downlink
Orthogonal Sub-Channels (OSC)
The OSC concept aims at multiplexing two users on the same radio resource, that is on the
same frequency and same time slot, by assigning each user onto a given sub-channel. These
sub-channels are then multiplexed by means of orthogonal sequences onto a common carrier
signal and transmitted. On the receiver side, each sub-channel can be detected knowing which
of the orthogonal sequences was used.

Baseband transmitter block diagram for orthogonal sub-channels technique.
In particular, OSC is based on the usage of orthogonal midambles, part of the GSM normal
burst, and thus operates with user specifi training sequences each indexed by a Training
Sequence Code (TSC). The composite baseband signal is generated by multiplexing two user
signals with orthogonal TSC onto one baseband signal employing a quaternary modulation
scheme such as ordinary QPSK. On the receiver side, the signal detection applying the
known training sequence indexed by the user-specifi Training Sequence Code, is executed.
Figure 4.1 depicts the baseband transmitter in downlink using the OSC technique.
The data from User A and User B are mapped onto QPSK constellations where for each
constellation symbol, the firs bit is assigned to User A, in the firs sub-channel OSC A, and
the second bit is assigned to User B, in the second sub-channel OSC B. Since the signal
constellations are based on ordinary QPSK and are always symmetric, the orthogonal sub-
channels are transmitted with equal power, that is the I and Q branches have the same power.
The addition of 8-PSK compatible signal constellations allowing higher signal power in a
sub-channel is described in more detail in Chapter 8.
VAMOS Adaptive Symbol Constellation
The modulation scheme applied for VAMOS is called Adaptive QPSK (AQPSK) and is based
on an α-QPSK (alpha-QPSK) modulation, where “α” adjusts the symbol constellation and
consequently the power of each sub-channel in a fl xible manner. OSC can thus be seen as
using α-QPSK with a fi ed α equal to π/4.
The modulating symbols ck for AQPSK, using the normal symbol rate of 270.83 ksym/s,
are define as a function of the incoming data bits ak of the firs sub-channel (OSC A), bk of
the second sub-channel (OSC B) and the argument α as shown in Equation 4.1:
ck = (1 −2 · ak) · cos α + j(1 −2 · bk) · sin α
(4.1)
with ak = {0;1}, bk = {0;1}, the symbol index k = 0, 1, 2 . . . and 0 ≤α ≤π
2
Figure 4.2 depicts the baseband transmitter in downlink for the adaptive symbol constellation
technique applied for VAMOS.
The adaptability of the modulation scheme is achieved by the time-varying argument α.
The value of α can range between 0 and π/2, these limits representing the BPSK9 signal
constellation points, that is either suppressing the second sub-channel (OSC B) on the Q
9 BPSK: Binary PSK.

branch (α = 0) or the firs sub-channel (OSC A) on the I branch (α = π/2). The α value may
be changed on a burst-by-burst basis according to the requirements for power assignment to
both sub-channels. The power assignment is based on a continuous α range, but can be set
discretely by the network. The embedding of the power assignment in the downlink power
control procedure is described hereafter in this section. Like OSC, a rotation between symbols
of π/2 is then applied.
Training Sequences Used in VAMOS
VAMOS applies to GSM normal bursts, keeping the burst structure unchanged. Only a second
Training Sequence is define
for the paired sub-channel. To allow multiplexing of legacy
mobile stations in the fiel the firs sub-channel carries by definitio a training sequence code
out of the existing (legacy) eight TSCs. This legacy TSC set is referred to as “TSC set 1”.
The TSC applied to the paired sub-channel belongs to “TSC set 2” which is designed both to
have optimum autocorrelation properties and to achieve the lowest cross-correlation with the
Training Sequences of TSC set 1. The training sequence codes of this second set can only be
applied to the second sub-channel, that is when new VAMOS-aware mobiles (see the section
below) are served. The two TSC sets are depicted in Table 4.1.
The multiplexing is done in such a way that a TSC pair is selected by taking the two TSC
with the same index in both sets. This TSC pairing applies if either a legacy mobile is paired
with a VAMOS-aware mobile or if two VAMOS-aware mobiles are paired.
VAMOS also includes a legacy mode, multiplexing two legacy mobiles. In this case, both
training sequences belong to TSC set 1.
In all cases, the TSC assigned is signaled to the mobile station in the channel assignment
message at call set-up or after handover.
VAMOS Operation in Discontinuous Transmission
If DTX is activated in the downlink and one of the sub-channels enters DTX mode (due to e.g.
a silent period), only the active sub-channel is transmitted. This allows the use of GMSK mod-
ulation with linearized GMSK pulse shape as for legacy channels. This has the advantage that
the power of the GMSK transmission compared to AQPSK can be reduced during this period
by for example 3 dB, since the signal energy for the remaining active user doubles compared to
ordinary QPSK transmission when both users are active. Once the sub-channel in DTX mode
needs to transmit a silence indicator description (SID FIRST, SID-UPDATE, ONSET, NO-
DATA) or reenters the next speech activity period, the AQPSK modulation scheme is selected.

VAMOS Pulse Shaping
Pulse shaping is performed using the linearized Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (LGMSK)
pulse shape, introduced for 8-PSK signals in EDGE. In addition, further (optimized) pulse
shaping forms that have a wider bandwidth than the LGMSK pulse and which aim at yielding
additional spectral efficien y and hardware efficien y gains are, at the time of writing, under
discussion in 3GPP:
r RRC pulse shape with 3 dB-bandwidth of 240 kHz and rolloff of 0.3;
r synthetic pulse shape with 3 dB-bandwidth of about 210 kHz.
These pulse shapes are depicted in Figure 4.3.
Both optimized pulse shapes are considered only if both sub-channels are active, while in
DTX mode of one sub-channel the usage of the LGMSK pulse shape is proposed on the other
sub-channel.
Mobile Station Types for VAMOS
VAMOS-aware Mobile Stations
Two types of VAMOS-aware mobile stations are defined
1. VAMOS Level 1: VAMOS-aware mobile stations that are DARP Phase 1 capable (see
Chapter 1) and implement TSC Set 2 (in addition to TSC Set 1). These mobiles need to
comply with performance requirements for VAMOS Level 1 mobiles.

2. VAMOS Level 2: VAMOS-aware mobile stations that are DARP Phase 1 capable, implement
TSC Set 2 (in addition to TSC Set 1) and use an advanced receiver architecture to comply
with tighter performance requirements than for VAMOS Level 1 mobiles.
These new mobiles are designed to be multiplexed on VAMOS sub-channels. In addition,
multiplexing of these mobile stations with legacy mobile stations is foreseen.

3GPP Release 9 and Beyond
109
Legacy Mobile Stations
As explained earlier, legacy mobile stations are always assigned to the firs sub-channel bearing
legacy TSCs. Two types of legacy mobile stations are considered, namely:
1. Legacy mobiles stations that support DARP Phase 1.
2. Legacy non-DARP Phase 1 mobiles that comply with existing performance specification
in 3GPP TS 45.005 and support at least FR and HR legacy speech channels.
VAMOS thus allows multiplexing between two VAMOS-aware mobiles and between a
VAMOS-aware mobile and a legacy mobile. It also supports multiplexing between two legacy
mobiles provided they both support DARP Phase 1. Implementation aspects for mobile stations
are described in Section 4.2.5.2.
Power Control
Power control in downlink for VAMOS is done in two successive stages:
1. Determination of the required transmit power levels for both mobile stations (MSA and
MSB) according to the radio link measurement reports (signal level – RXLEV and signal
quality – RXQUAL) received from these mobiles. The BSS determines the power level
P MSA required for MSA in the firs sub-channel and P MSB for MSB in the second sub-
channel.
2. Determination of the corresponding AQPSK signal constellation and output power for the
AQPSK signal. A control unit in the BTS computes a combination of output power P and
α that gives the required combination of P MSA and P MSB in downlink based on the
following relationship:
P = P MSA + P MSB = P × cos2 α + P × sin2 α
(4.2)
Both steps are part of the radio link control in the BSS. The procedure is depicted in an
exemplary implementation in Figure 4.4.
Associated Control Channels
An important aim with VAMOS is to preserve the integrity of the associated control channels
(FACCH and SACCH), which in downlink direction identify the basis for reliable neighboring
cell descriptions, power control and timing advance commands for uplink. Hence a balanced
performance between traffi channels and associated control channels is targeted. To achieve
this, a metric has been define such that the relative performance between traffi channels
and associated control channels should not degrade in comparison to legacy traffi channels
in non-VAMOS mode.
While a robust FACCH performance is achievable by transmitting a FACCH frame using
GMSK modulation, one of the drawbacks in VAMOS mode is that speech frames will need
to be stolen from both sub-channels simultaneously in order to transmit a FACCH frame to
one user. This will increase the FACCH signaling load and may lead to artifacts audible in the
speech. To minimize this impact, FACCH soft stealing may be employed, whereby the power

between two users sharing the same radio resource is apportioned in favor of the user to which
the FACCH is associated, but so that the other user’s speech frame is not entirely stolen. This
is depicted in Figure 4.5, where the firs constellation shows equal power for two users sharing
the same radio resource, the second shows a power imbalance in favor of user B and the third
constellation shows a power imbalance in favor of user A.
To overcome temporary severe channel degradations, Downlink Repeated FACCH and
Repeated SACCH, described in Chapter 7, need to be supported by VAMOS-aware mobile
stations.
4.2.3.2
Uplink
The uplink for VAMOS is based on the OSC concept.
Burst Structure and Training Sequence Codes
In contrast to downlink, the physical layer is not changed for uplink. This means that two
independent uplink transmissions are simultaneously received at the BTS. The legacy GMSK

modulation and normal burst are used. Thus the transmitter side is the same as for legacy
GMSK-based voice traffi channels. The same TSC as applied in downlink is, however, used
in uplink.
Associated Control Channels
Since uplink power control is executed on a dedicated basis for both sub-channels, there is no
difference to the legacy non-VAMOS channel mode.
With regards to the SACCH transmission, Repeated SACCH define in Release 6 must be
supported by VAMOS-aware mobiles to overcome severe channel degradations.
Reception of VAMOS Sub-channels at the BTS
The BTS receiver needs to process signals from two mobiles on simultaneous sub-channels
with individual propagation paths, which may include time offsets of one or two symbols.
Hence the uplink for VAMOS can be seen as a 2 × 2 Multi User MIMO system, where different
propagation paths from two users provide the basis to fully utilize the degree of freedom of
two receive antennas in typical base station (BTS) implementations. The BTS receiver types
are further described in a section below.
4.2.4
Specificatio Aspects
VAMOS is being specifie in 3GPP Release 9 at the time of writing. Table 4.2 provides an
overview of the related 3GPP GERAN specifications
4.2.5
Implementation Aspects
The implementation impacts are listed hereafter for networks and mobile stations.
4.2.5.1
Impact on the Network
Four major network impacts due to VAMOS need to be considered as described in this section.
BTS Receiver
With regards to the BTS receiver, different receiver algorithms may be used, that is Space Time
Interference Rejection Combining (STIRC), Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) or
Joint Detection (JD) to receive both orthogonal sub-channels distinguished by their individual
training sequences. Another option is to use two independent GMSK receivers for each sub-
channel. The concept of a SIC receiver implementation is depicted in Figure 4.6.
For efficien operation of the uplink, the base station sub-system (BSS) should apply uplink
power control possibly interworked with Dynamic Frequency Channel Allocation (DFCA)
scheme to keep the difference of received uplink signal power levels of paired sub-channels
within a certain power window, for example within a 15 dB window. Performance for VAMOS
uplink reception is specifie in TS 45.005 for discrete Sub-channel Power Imbalance Ratios
(SCPIR), see Section 4.2.5.2. The exact SCPIR figure are subject to agreement at the time of
writing.

Radio Resource Management
Radio Resource Management (RRM) is responsible for optimum pairing of users in channels
supporting the VAMOS mode. This is executed according to the available information on path
loss, location and mobility of the users. In general, it is preferable to pair users with a similar
path loss, since uplink reception is improved in this case. Hence RRM needs to balance the
received uplink signal levels of both sub-channels within a power window of 15 dB range.
Handover to channels in non-VAMOS mode also needs to be provided if the channel quality
remarkably degrades for one of the sub-channels. This applies to both channel modes: full-rate
and half-rate voice traffi channels.
RRC protocol signaling also indicates at channel assignment the used TSC set on this
sub-channel and by this whether the firs or second VAMOS sub-channel is assigned. In

addition, AMR channel rate and codec mode adaptation are performed by RRM, if AMR-type
channels are served.
Abis Interface
In the extreme case that all Abis time slots in all TRXs in the given BTS site are working at
the same time in VAMOS mode, the Abis bandwidth needed for CS traffi must be doubled in
comparison to the legacy non-VAMOS mode. Note that Abis bandwidth reserved for signaling
must also be adjusted accordingly in such a case. However, unless a 100% penetration of
VAMOS-aware mobiles is available in the network, it is unlikely to achieve 100% penetration
of VAMOS channels. Thus, a suitable mix of VAMOS channels and legacy full-rate and half-
rate channels has to be assumed for Abis dimensioning, taking into account that the mobiles
may require channel mode adaptation from VAMOS half-rate channel mode or legacy half-rate
channel mode to legacy full-rate channel mode in the case of degrading radio conditions. Thus,
the actual impact of VAMOS on Abis resources, that need to be reserved for the CS domain, is
proportional to the penetration of channels in VAMOS mode. A viable solution in this context
is the migration of the transport network towards packet/IP-based Abis.
Frequency Planning
VAMOS channels are intended to be employed both on BCCH carrier and on TCH carriers.
As performance investigations during the study phase have shown, VAMOS can exhibit the
best performance for hardware-limited scenarios and loose frequency reuses, while for tighter
frequency reuses such as 1/1 and 1/3, the performance gains are rather moderate in general.
This is described in more detail in Chapter 8. In general, impacts on frequency planning due
to VAMOS introduction are rather limited, but nonetheless dependent on the mix of mobile
station types in the network and the applied frequency reuse on traffi layer.
4.2.5.2
Impacts on the Mobile Station
As described in Section 4.2.2, VAMOS is expected to serve legacy mobile stations, as it is
either non-DARP or DARP Phase 1 compliant. New VAMOS-aware mobile stations need to
support the new training sequences of TSC Set 2 in downlink and uplink. VAMOS level 1

114
GSM/EDGE
mobiles are based on the design of DARP Phase 1 mobiles updated with the knowledge of
these new training sequences and the signaling support.
With regards to VAMOS Level 2, mobiles, having advanced receiver architectures, different
receiver algorithms may be used: as for the BTS, the SIC technique may be applied and
thereby detect the two sub-channels in a serial manner. Alternatively the MS may rely on
Joint Detection of the sub-channels, for instance, by means of a QPSK type receiver. A
common feature of these methods is that they are aiming to perform equalization of both
sub-channels and by this achieving additional gains compared to VAMOS Level 1 receivers.
In contrast to VAMOS Level 1, mobiles’ estimation of α corresponding to the actual alpha
signal constellation needs to be performed by these mobiles, since the used α is not signaled.
The VAMOS-aware mobiles are expected to be served on the weaker sub-channels when
being multiplexed with legacy mobiles. The operating range of α values for different mobile
station types is depicted in Figure 4.7.
With regards to the supported α range, the performance specificatio in 3GPP TS 45.005
for both downlink and uplink is based on the Sub-channel Power Imbalance Ratio (SCPIR).

Note that VAMOS level 2 mobiles are specifie to support a larger SCPIR range than VAMOS
level 1 mobiles. The performance is specifie to be tested for different SCPIR ratios with SCPIR
= 0 dB being one of them. The exact SCPIR range is under discussion at the time of writing.
If further transmit pulse shapes other than LGMSK are define in downlink, these and the
corresponding capability signaling need to be supported by these mobile stations.
4.2.6
Future Work
VAMOS is being specifie in Release 9. A number of enhancements are, at the time of writing,
under discussion and no decision has been reached as to their standardization:
r Definitio of optimized transmit pulse shape(s) in downlink in addition to legacy GMSK
pulse shape.
r Introduction, in addition to Repeated SACCH, of an alternative SACCH mapping for the
second sub-channel.
VAMOS has so far focused on single antenna mobiles. Dual antenna mobiles, that is compliant
with DARP Phase 2 requirements standardized in 3GPP Release 7, have not been included
in the investigations. It is expected that further performance improvements can be achieved
especially in networks employing tight frequency reuses when introducing such mobiles. In
addition, multiplexing of sub-channels as introduced by VAMOS could be studied for channel
types other than voice traffi channels, for example for packet traffi channels or even for
signaling channels, should a demand arise for spectral efficien y increase for these channels.

Data Evolution
4.3.1
Introduction
In December 2007, a major advance in the data rates of EDGE was achieved with the introduc-
tion of EGPRS2 in Release 7 of the 3GPP specifications EGPRS2 doubles the peak data rate
of EGPRS from 59.2 kbit/s to 118.4 kbit/s per time slot with the support of new modulations
(QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM) and a higher modulating symbol rate at 325 ksymb/s.
The new modulations and the higher modulating symbol rate were introduced in conjunction
with a wide bandwidth transmit pulse that was optimized specificall for the higher modulating
symbol rate for use in the uplink. This “wide pulse” is expected to increase throughput
performance considerably thanks to its reduced inter-symbol interference. For more details
about the wide pulse in uplink, see Chapter 2 on 3GPP Release 7.
A wider bandwidth pulse, while yielding gains in throughput performance, provides lower
protection to adjacent channel users and this aspect needs particular attention on the down-
link. This is because while in the uplink, any potential interference introduced by the wide
pulse can easily be suppressed by the interference cancellation algorithms that are widely
deployed within dual antenna base stations, in the downlink, the suppression capability in
legacy mobile stations is restricted by the use of a single antenna and limited baseband
complexity. For this reason, no wide pulse shape has been specifie
yet for the downlink
(at the time of writing). Instead, a feasibility study into the performance of a wide pulse on the

116
GSM/EDGE
downlink and on its impact on legacy mobiles is ongoing within 3GPP, the results of which
are being collated in 3GPP TR 45.913 [11].
In this section, two of the wide bandwidth pulse shapes under evaluation in 3GPP for use
on the downlink are described, together with an evaluation of their performance in terms of
their adjacent channel protection. For a more comprehensive evaluation in terms of link level
and system level performance, see Chapter 6 on data evolution performance.
4.3.2
Wide Bandwidth Pulse Shape for Downlink
The optimization of a new pulse shape on the downlink can be viewed as a trade-off between
the throughput performance and the level of interference introduced by the new pulse shape.
This latter aspect is dependent not only on the adjacent channel protection provided by the
pulse shape but also on a number of other factors:
r the level of protection provided to a co-channel user (co-located in frequency) as well as to
an adjacent channel user (adjacent in frequency);
r the proportion of time slots supporting the EGPRS2 service and the pulse shape’s time slot
occupancy;
r the degree to which the frequencies on which the EGPRS2 service is deployed are interfer-
ence limited (for example, frequencies allocated to a TCH layer tend to be more interference
limited than those allocated to a BCCH layer due to a tighter frequency reuse).

The protection ratio of a transmit pulse when on an adjacent frequency (200 kHz offset).
A number of pulse shapes are being evaluated in 3GPP for use on the downlink, two of which
are depicted in Figure 4.8 (the linearized GMSK pulse shape – LGMSK – is also shown for
reference).
The protection that a transmit pulse provides to a user who is on a channel that is co-located
in frequency or to a user who is on a channel that is adjacent in frequency, can be define
as the ratio of power of that pulse shape to the power of the legacy pulse shape (LGMSK),
after both have passed through the legacy mobile’s front-end filte . This is depicted in Figure
4.9 for the case when the transmit pulse is adjacent (with 200 kHz offset). If we assume the
front-end filte of that mobile has a frequency spectrum which is similar to the linearized
GMSK truncated to −160–+160 kHz, then the protection ratios for the proposed transmit
pulse can be calculated, as shown in Table 4.3. By comparing the protection ratios with the
LGMSK pulse shape, we can see that the wide bandwidth pulse shapes offer a lower protection
to users in the adjacent channel (at 200 kHz offset) and a higher protection to users in the
co-channel.
A transmit pulse should offer sufficien protection in the adjacent frequencies. For exam-
ple, in the case of GMSK modulation, the adjacent channel protection at offsets 200 kHz,
400 kHz and 600 kHz (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd adjacent channels) is specifie in 3GPP TS 45.005
[12] at −18 dB, −50 dB and −58 dB respectively. The greater protection at the higher offsets

corresponds to the expected proximity of the interferer in frequency as a result of frequency
reuse planning.
These 400 kHz and 600 kHz requirements were used as boundary conditions in the op-
timization of the 1st and 2nd pulse shapes in Figure 4.1. To take into account transmitter
impairments such as spectral re-growth coming from the non-linear characteristics of the
power amplifie , a model of the gain and phase characteristics of a typical base station power
amplifie was used during the pulse shape optimization process. The resulting protection ratios
for the proposed transmit pulse when including transmitter impairments are shown in Table
4.4. It can be seen that the transmit pulse meets the requirements at the 400 kHz and 600 kHz
offsets.
At the 200 kHz offset, the 18 dB requirement has been relaxed to enable the investigation
into the trade-off between adjacent channel protection at the 200 kHz offset and throughput
performance. In Chapter 6, the system impact of this trade-off, both in terms of the throughput
performance for the EGPRS2 users and impact to other users is evaluated.

H(e)NB Enhancements
In Release 9 the CSG mobility mechanisms specifie in GERAN in Release 8 (see Chapter
3) are extended to provide support for inbound mobility to Home NodeB and Home eNodeB
(H(e)NB) in connected mode thus enabling service continuity and ensuring improved user
experience towards home cells.
In addition, a Release 9 Home (e)NB may now provide access not only to the mobile
subscribers belonging to the Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) to which the H(e)NB belongs
but also to other subscribers. This is known as hybrid access [13, 14]. A set of service
requirements for Home (e)NB enhancements for Rel-9 is given in [14]. It should be noted

that H(e)NB enhancements are being specifie at the time for writing. For this reason only
concepts and guiding principles are described hereafter.
The architecture for Home eNodeB support in E-UTRAN is depicted in Figure 4.10. The
H(e)NB Gateway (GW) ensures support for a large number of HeNB through a single S1
interface to the EPC, the same interface as specifie
between an eNB and the EPC. The
H(e)NB GW serves thus as a collection point for the control plane signaling, while the user
plane signaling may either stop at the H(e)NB GW or be sent directly to the Serving Gateway
(SGW) [14]. The HeNB provides the same functionality as the eNB with the addition of
H(e)NB GW discovery when available. A HeNB can only be connected to one HeNB GW or
MME at a time. The MME provides access control for a CSG member (i.e. verifie whether
the user is member of the CSG or not) as well as routing of handover messages [14].

120
GSM/EDGE
As part of 3GPP Rel-9 GERAN solutions for inbound mobility to UTRAN and E-UTRAN
CSG cells including the hybrid access are being specifie for:
r Idle mode.
r Packet transfer mode10 (connected mode): network-controlled cell (re)selection and PS
handover to a Home (e)NodeB.
r Dedicated mode11 and Dual Transfer Mode12 (connected mode): handover to a (UTRAN)
Home NodeB.
4.4.1
Idle Mode Mobility
In idle mode, the reselection from a GERAN cell to a CSG cell that fulfill given radio criteria
requires the following steps:
1. To obtain the routing parameters of the CSG cell: The mobile station reads the system
information13 from the corresponding H(e)NB to acquire the parameters to uniquely identify
the CSG cell (e.g. global cell identifier and the CSG (CSG ID).
2. To perform access control: The mobile station determines whether it is allowed access to
the CSG cell by verifying whether the CSG ID of the H(e)NB belongs to its “Allowed
CSG list”. The allowed CSG ID will be stored by the mobile station with the physical
layer identity of the cell (i.e. scrambling code or PSC for UTRAN, and physical layer
cell identity or PCI for E-UTRAN) and possibly fingerprin information (such as GPS
coordinates). The storage of this information may help reduce the occurrences where the
routing parameters need to be re-acquired from CSG cells and may thus yield battery
savings.
3. To validate the stored information: In order to minimize the reading of the CSG system
information there may be different ways to control the validity of the obtained routing
parameters from the CSG system information stored by the mobile station, for example, by
utilizing timers or location related indicators.
4. To detect the physical layer identities confusion: The deployment of H(e)NB within the
coverage of a GERAN macro cell, makes it likely that the same physical layer identity
(PSC/PCI) be used on the same frequency by two or more CSG cells under coverage of the
GERAN cell – this is referred to as PSC/PCI confusion, that is the physical layer identifie
coupled with the frequency do not allow to uniquely identify the cell itself. The mobile
station detecting the PCI/PSC confusion could store this information and possibly utilize
it later to inform the network and/or trigger the acquisition of routing parameters from a
CSG cell where confusion exists.

4.4.2
Connected Mode Mobility
The deployment of H(e)NBs, although under the supervision of network operators, is, unlike
macro cells, uncoordinated or loosely coordinated. Their geographical location may also
change. This increases the risk for PSC/PCI confusion as described in Section 4.4.1.
The challenge in GERAN networks for inbound mobility to CSG cells in connected mode
is to cope with the CSG cell identification PCI/PSC confusion and measurement reporting of
CSG cells.
The only way to uniquely identify a CSG cell is by means of its global cell identifie (GCI).
However, the GCI is only broadcast by the H(e)NB in the system information of the CSG cell.
The acquisition of routing parameters and access control as described in Section 4.4.1 may
thus be necessary steps in connected mode.
MIB/SIB reading in connected mode results in service interruption and increased battery
consumption. While it is not reasonable to require the mobile station to perform MIB/SIB
reading when the information is readily available, it is also essential to ensure this information
is accurate when sent to the network. Means are thus being investigated to minimize the
occurrences where MIB/SIB reading is necessary (e.g. CSG cell being the best suitable cell on
the frequency) while ensuring the accuracy of the information reported to the network for use,
for example in handover preparation. Inaccurate information could otherwise trigger handover
failure [15]. The solution being define in GERAN is based on these two principles.
In addition to minimizing MIB/SIB reading occurrences, measurement reporting of CSG
cells is further restricted to CSG cells that belong to the mobile station’s “Allowed CSG list”
and that meet given radio criteria. Not only does this minimize the impact on signaling (due
to signaling capacity limitations), it also ensures that only information potentially useful to
the user is exchanged between the mobile station and the network. It is indeed useless for a
mobile station to provide reports for cells to which no mobility is possible, be it for radio or
membership reason.
Inbound mobility to CSG cells in connected mode is being specifie
at the time of
writing.
4.5
Security Improvements
GSM security aims at protecting operators and subscribers against malicious attacks from third
parties. It provides both authentication and confidentialit . Authentication ensures the verifi
cation and confirmatio of a subscriber’s identity by the network. Confidentialit ensures the
privacy of a given piece of information so it is never made available or disclosed to any unau-
thorized individuals, entity or process.14 The subscriber’s identity, the transfer of user data (e.g.
CS voice, CS/PS data) and some signaling information elements such as the identities of the
subscriber (IMSI15) and of the mobile terminal (IMEI16) are all subject to confidentialit [16].

GSM/EDGE
Three algorithms are used for GSM security: A3, A5 and A8. The introduction of GPRS
included also the GPRS-A5 algorithm (or GEA17). The A3 algorithm is used for authentication
and operates between the authentication center and the mobile station. The A5 algorithm is
used for the confidentialit of CS connections over the radio interface and operates on the radio
link between the radio access network (BTS) and the mobile station. The GPRS-A5 algorithm
is used for confidentialit of PS connections over the radio interface and operates between the
core network (SGSN) and the mobile station. Both A5 and GEA provide ciphering using a
specifi encryption key generated by the A8 algorithm [17].
Although A5 is referred to as an algorithm, there are in fact different variants (“A5/x”)
which use different algorithms and achieve different security levels. Likewise different variants
(“GEAx”) of GPRS-A5 exist. A5/x and GEAx are listed hereafter.
r A5/0 and GEA0 provide no encryption.
r A5/1 is the original mandatory algorithm designed in 1987 for the pan-European GSM
system (see Chapter 1).
r GEA1 is not related to A5/1. It uses an algorithm which has been kept secret.
r A5/2 was a deliberate weakened export18 version of A5/1. As it was so weak and as even its
implementation made the terminal vulnerable, the GSM Association strongly recommended
that it no longer should be implemented in terminals built as of 1 July 2006. Thereafter,
following GSMA recommendation, 3GPP modifie its specification from R99 onwards to
prohibit the implementation of A5/2 in mobile stations.
r GEA2 is not related to A5/2. It uses an algorithm which has been kept secret.
r A5/3 and GEA3 [18] were introduced in R99 alongside the specification of EDGE and
UMTS. They provide an increased level of security compared to A5/1 and GEA1. A5/3 and
GEA3 use the same KASUMI [19] f8 algorithm as in UMTS but with a ciphering key of 64
bits instead of 128 bits.
r A5/4 and GEA4 [20] were introduced in Rel-6. A5/4 and GEA4 use the same algorithm as
A5/3 and GEA3 but thanks to a ciphering key of 128 bits offer greater security. However,
only the specificatio of the algorithm using a 128-bit key was completed in Rel-6. The
remaining specifications such as signaling changes, were finalize in Rel-9.
Ever since cryptographic methods have been used, studies have been made to identify breaches
that could permit the corresponding codes to be broken. Historical examples are plenty and
the security of GSM and of other systems is no exception. A5/2 was quickly dismissed as a
result of this process. A number of publications have also been published on potential attacks
to A5/1. Theoretical threats do exist, and sometimes also practical threats. Nonetheless the
authors are not aware, at the time of writing, of any malicious attack having actually occurred
in any live GSM network worldwide. It should also be noted that there is no known attack on
17 GEA: GPRS Encryption Algorithm.
18 Cryptography and in particular encryption methods have historically been a matter of national security for
the countries in which they were developed. Systems using these means were thus bound to apply drastic export
restrictions. Exporting such systems to other countries meant they could not support the original encryption method,
but instead a weaker version, if any at all. An export version of an encryption algorithm is thus define typically as a
weaker version of an algorithm originally subject to export restrictions.

3GPP Release 9 and Beyond
123
GEA. Though even in case when no theoretical threat exists, the remote possibility that there
could be one has itself justifie the specificatio and implementation of more and more secure
mechanisms The gradual introduction both of stronger mechanisms with means to ensure
their secrecy, and of products, especially mobile terminals, implementing those, guarantees
the timely integrity of the system and of its users.
The implementation of A5/0, A5/1 and A5/3 in GSM terminals, and additionally that of
GEA0, GEA1, GEA2 and GEA3 when GPRS capable, have been mandatory for a few years.
With the recent completion of A5/4 and GEA4 specification in Rel-9, it is expected their
implementation in mobile terminals will soon become mandatory as well.

Local Call Local Switch
A Work Item for Local Call Local Switch was agreed at GERAN#41, with the goal of
standardizing procedures, messages and information elements on the A interface to enable local
switching in the BSS of the user plane of local calls. Local call refers to a mobile-to-mobile
CS voice call involving two MSs connected to the same BSS, while the term local switching
refers to the possibility of switching a local call in the BSC, or create a direct communication
between the involved BTSs, see Figure 4.11. In any case the effect is that some resources
on the BSS internal interfaces (Abis and Ater) can be saved. In actual implementations the
specifi solution is based on BSS network topology and remains implementation specific
The specificatio
of LCLS is ongoing at the time of writing with expected completion in
Release 10.

4.6.1
User Plane Aspects
The only user plane aspects that are standardized are the ones affecting the A interface [21].
To minimize changes to existing deployments using a legacy TDM-based A interface, and to
AoIP networks being deployed, the impact on the A interface user plane handling is kept as
small as possible. In particular, for A over TDM, no changes to the A interface are currently
defined Even if a call is (temporarily) locally switched, the two corresponding circuits always
remain active, meaning that bandwidth savings on the A interface for locally switched calls
are not possible, while of course savings are realized on the Abis/Ater interfaces. While a call
is locally switched, the foreseen solution is that the TRAU will send some silence codeword
on the A interface. Also for AoIP, the IP connections between the BSS and the MGW always
remain active, that is the corresponding IP/UDP endpoints are not released. What happens is
that while a call is locally switched, user plane transmission on the AoIP interface is suspended
and the BSS/MGW does not expect to receive data through its IP/UDP endpoints.
4.6.2
Control Plane Aspects
To support local switching a number of control plane aspects have been addressed [22]. First
of all, in order to trigger local switching, the BSS needs to be able to correlate the two legs
of a local call, that is it needs to know who is talking to whom. A solution has been define
to pass this piece of information from the Core Network to the BSS during the assignment
procedure at call set-up and during handovers. The BSS can then perform the correlation and
inform the Core Network when the correlation has been found.
Second, even if a call is a local one, there is some user plane information that needs to be
received via the Core Network, the most important being the ring-back tone at call set-up.
This means that local switching should not be activated immediately, but only after the call
is finall through-connected. Or at least the ring-back tone should still be conveyed from the
Core Network to the calling party, even if a local connection is created between the calling
and the called parties. The information that a call is finall connected is also available at the
Core Network and a solution has been define to pass this to the BSS, so that it knows when
local switching can finall be established.
It needs to be noted that, at least for the case of A over IP without Transcoders in BSS, local
switching in the BSS is only possible if the same or compatible codecs are used on the two
legs of the call. Especially in this scenario it is up to the MSC Server to ensure that the same
or compatible codecs are offered on the two legs of the call.
Then, since the possibility and the usefulness of establishing local switching are directly
linked to the BSS network topology, it has been specifie that – after all the assistance received
by the Core Network – the fina decision whether to trigger (and/or subsequently release) local
switching remains in the BSS. This decision is then reported back to the Core Network to keep
it informed of the status of the call.
After a local switching has been established, there can be several reasons why it needs to
be released to then resume transmission of the user plane data to the Core Network. The most
obvious ones are outgoing inter-BSS handovers and, for AoIP, also BSS internal handover
procedures due to incompatible codecs. One more reason is the activation of a Supplementary
Service that requires it to forward user plane data to the Core Network. The knowledge that

3GPP Release 9 and Beyond
125
some Supplementary Services are activated is also available at the Core Network, and is then
passed to the BSS to command the release of local switching. More generally, all intra-BSS
handovers where maintaining local switching is not practical, possible or useful, trigger the
release of local switching. In all these cases the BSS informs the Core Network that local
switching has been released and that user plane transmission on the A interface has been
re-established.

Introduction
The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of performance evaluation as a key input to
the design, deployment, and utilization of telecommunication systems. The most common
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are introduced and performance evaluation methods used
throughout the book are explained.
Continued radio technology evolution makes it possible to take the GSM system to a whole
new performance level. Enhancements specifie by 3GPP standardization forum are bringing
in benefits which will improve the user experience and the overall system performance.
Operators and network infrastructure vendors are challenged to fin new ways to improve
the network services. New creative methods are needed to increase the coverage of a radio
link and capacity at system level given the limitations of the operator spectrum and network
resources. 3GPP Release 4 introduced highly successful EDGE technology and since then
several new features have been added to the GSM standard. These new features are now
reaching network equipment and user terminals.
Starting from 3GPP Release 7 new features for GSM Evolution have been discussed in
the standardization. Downlink Dual Carrier, Mobile Receive Diversity, Higher Symbol Rate,
Higher Order Modulation, lower latency, and many more are specifie to add new features
and improve the network service performance. GSM voice capacity has been significantl
improved with Orthogonal Sub-Channels (OSC). These new technologies are designed to
be backwards compatible and work seamlessly with the existing features. New performance
requirements are needed to ensure compatibility of new features. Feature performance is
specifie on the link level, but also the system performance needs to be verifie and further
optimized to meet the performance targets.

On the GSM Radio System Performance Engineering
The primary goal of the cellular network performance engineering is to design a commu-
nications network, which meets the coverage, quality and capacity requirements set by the
network operator to satisfy the customers ordering the network services. Today multiple
cellular network operators are competing for the same market share in the same geographical
area. The challenge for the radio performance engineers is to meet the customer expectations
and requirements, and at the same time keep the operational costs low enough to be profitable
and being able to upgrade and maintain the investment to enable future service.
The competition for the market shares has a direct impact on the network performance
requirements. When competition gets more intense, the cost of the service for the customer
gets lower. User equipment and terminals are getting cheaper while the capability increases and
more and more attractive functionalities can be implemented such as high average data rates
for effortless internet browsing and gaming. The cheaper the calls, the more rapid increase of
subscribers will be experienced. The cellular telephone market has been growing all over the
world for more than fiftee years and there were four billion users in 3GPP specifie systems
by 2009.
The radio frequencies are fundamental to cellular systems, and also a limited resource,
which cannot be increased. Therefore, resources become more and more limited while the
cellular boom goes on. The available resources must serve the increasing number of service
requests while the number of subscribers and cellular operators increases. If an operator cannot
acquire more radio frequencies, then the spectrum efficien y needs to be improved. Spectrum
efficien y is one of the key characteristics when selecting a system and planning the network
roll-out and capacity performance.
The popularity of cellular services grows year by year and the amount of traffi rapidly
increases. In particular, the recent popularity of data services has increased the absolute
number of user data bits transmitted through the systems. Data services are equally popular in
both rural and dense urban areas.
Operators are seeking new means and solutions to meet the increasing capacity requirements
and demand for higher average data rates. Rural areas can be populated with more base station
sites to narrow down the distance signal needs to travel. This is a simple but costly way to
increase the average data rate. Upgrading the existing system to a more robust and higher
performing link connections is in many cases a more viable option. There are also several
options on how to build up the network capacity. In some cases, the operator can acquire a
license to utilize additional frequencies, for example, on a higher frequency band. However,
if frequencies are not available, the only solution is to use the existing frequencies more
efficientl , for example improve the network capacity of voice and data services within the
existing spectrum.
Spectral efficien y is one of the key the optimization criterion, where GSM has several radio
engineering tools to work with. One traditional way to increase capacity is to decrease the cell
size, which gives more freedom in increasing the frequency reuse. These so-called micro cells
have smaller coverage but can potentially serve more traffi since more resources are available
in the same geographical area. Micro cells are also good for offic buildings and in general
for indoors, since the attenuation from building walls does not affect the link budget and also
the interference levels can be lower towards the rest of the network. One drawback with large
number of micro cells is the higher cost of the network infrastructure and overall maintenance

required to cover a certain area with more base stations. However, there are alternative ways
to improve the capacity.
The GSM system has been continuously improved in the 3GPP standardization forum and
contains several high performance features, which make GSM one of the most competitive
systems in terms of the cost of the network and the number of subscribers using the network.
GSM Evolution can address these challenges and issues. The huge number of GSM terminals,
a large installed base of GSM base stations and infrastructure have such a massive volume
that it makes sense to improve and maintain the network capability to make the most of the
spectrum. A good GSM network performance also paves the way for other systems as users
are more comfortable with using the latest services not only in hot spots but also in rural areas
and while roaming on other operators’ networks.
GSM Evolution provides service continuity to new systems such as HSPA and E-UTRAN
long-term evolution. GSM Evolution in 3GPP Release 7 and Release 9 has standardized several
new features which are designed to allow a more efficien use of the allocated frequency band
and improve the network spectral efficien y and hardware efficien y. As always, there are also
some proprietary features available in network equipment and cellular infrastructure that do
not require standardization.
5.3
Simulation Tools
Cellular networks with radio transmitters and receivers are dynamic systems, which cannot
be evaluated using exact analytical models and equations. One of the reasons for this is the
random behavior of signal propagation. The fundamental reason behind this behavior is the
complex interactions (reflection absorption, diffraction, dispersion, etc.) of electromagnetic
waves in different environments.
In link and network level performance evaluation, the chosen methodology and simulation
tools have a significan role. A link level simulator is an efficien tool for studying the various
transmission and reception related modules with new modeling ideas. System level simulators,
on the other hand, are outstanding for studying overall performance of new link level features.
The following chapters discuss the link and system level simulators, which have been used
throughout this book.
5.3.1
Semi-Analytical Methods
Analyzing the performance via computer simulation works well for a large variety of commu-
nication systems, but can be time-consuming for very low error rates. Semi-analytic techniques
allow the computation of error rates, which are small (in the order of 10−6 or less). The semi-
analytic technique can provide analysis and results more quickly than methods relying on
Monte Carlo simulations. The benefi of a semi-analytic technique comes from the combina-
tion of simulation and analytic methods to analyze the error rate. A computing environment
can be used to implement the semi-analytic techniques to perform some of the initial analysis
related to modulations used in GSM and GSM Evolution.
The semi-analytic technique works well for certain types of communication systems, but care
should be taken when definin the methodology. Applicability of the semi-analytic technique

132
GSM/EDGE
depends on the type of processes to be modeled. The technique is applicable if a system has
these characteristics:
r effects of multipath fading;
r quantization;
r the receiver is perfectly synchronized with the carrier;
r timing jitter is negligible.
Because phase noise and timing jitter are slow processes, they reduce the applicability of the
semi-analytic technique to a communication system. Amplifie nonlinearities must precede
the effects of noise in the actual channel being modeled. The noiseless simulation has no
errors in the received signal constellation. Distortions from sources other than noise should be
mild enough to keep each signal point in its correct decision region. If this is not the case, the
predicted BER is too low. The semi-analytic function also assumes that the noise in the actual
channel being modeled is following a Gaussian distribution.
The semi-analytic simulation (Figure 5.1) averages the error probabilities over the entire
received signal to determine the overall error probability. If the error probability calculated in
this way is a symbol error probability, the error probability can be converted to a bit error rate.
5.3.2
Link Level Simulator
One way to compute the bit error rate or symbol error rate for a communication system is
to simulate the transmission of data messages and compare all the messages before and after
transmission.

Link level performance is the baseline design criteria for a communications system. Link
level simulations are performed between the transmitter and the receiver to evaluate the
performance of the physical layer. There is always at least one directional connection where
the modeled system contains a data source, a channel coding block, a modulator, a radio
propagation channel, a demodulator, a channel decoding block and performance evaluation
blocks (Figure 5.2). Details to run a simulation in different scenarios are dependent on the
requested service.
The process of running link simulations consists of building parameter files starting simula-
tions, waiting for the simulation to end and examining the results. Typically a single simulation
run can include any number of different simulation cases with different requested services and
channel coding parameters. Those cases can be simulated in parallel, sharing most of the
common processing between different cases.
5.3.2.1
Link Level Modeling
Starting from 3GPP Release 7 there are new GSM Evolution features, which require changes
to the physical layer modeling. Higher symbol rate, an optimized pulse shaping filte combined
with higher order modulation using 32-QAM and 16-QAM double the data rate compared to
EGPRS. Introduced features need to be evaluated against the GPRS and EGPRS reference
performances. New modulations and higher symbol rate usually mean that also the receiver
algorithms need to be revised and optimized in terms of performance and complexity.
The link simulator for GSM Evolution is implemented using Matlab computing environment
with MEX extensions to modules implemented using C-language. C-implementations are also
used in the bit true modules, which are used to model a realistic signal processing platform
with the impact of limited signal dynamic range, for example.
EGPRS2 introduced a new higher symbol rate, QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM higher order
modulations and new transmitter pulse shaping filter for both downlink and uplink. For the
performance requirements all the baseband signal processing algorithms need to be upgraded
to accommodate the new modulations and potentially the higher complexity of receiving end.
Voice evolution introduces multiplexing of two mobiles to a same radio resource. This is
achieved by using Orthogonal Sub-Channels where one symbol from a higher order QPSK

134
GSM/EDGE
modulation is carrying information for two users for both Full Rate and Half Rate logical chan-
nels. Multiplexing different mobile station capabilities to the sub-channels of a same symbol
can be enhanced by making the modulation adaptive with fl xible modulation constellation
patterns. When a modulation constellation is adapted by doing a favor for one user, the other
user is equally degraded, causing a sub-channel power imbalance ratio. This means that a
new modulator had to be designed where the users with their sub-channel specifi power are
multiplexed to a composite signal carrying information for two users. This is also something
to be taken into account when carrying out the performance measurement.
5.3.3
System Level Simulator
The system level simulator used throughout this book is called SMART, which follows the
principles and requirements for dynamic simulator described in [1], Appendix E. In SMART,
cell phones are dynamically moving around the chosen network environment, which allows re-
alistic modeling of radio resource management (RRM) algorithms (handovers, power control,
channel/codec mode adaptation, etc.). Realistic algorithms with a realistic network environ-
ment make a dynamic simulator to give realistic performance results.
5.3.3.1
Introduction to System Simulations
SMART is a dynamic system level simulator which is continuously being updated with new
features coming onto 3GPP standardization releases. Later on, features that are standardized
are optimized to support studies for product development. Realistic algorithms corresponding
to ones from actual BSS (Base Station Sub-system) software make SMART also capable
of supporting customer network trials by realistic network simulations. First, this makes it
possible to evaluate performance with the features that are not available in the real network.
System parameters needs to be optimized for new algorithms and dynamic system level
simulator with a realistic network set-up can be used for this task. Initial parameters can
be achieved through performance simulations with theoretical simulation environments, but
realistic initial values are only possible with simulations using real network data. Real network
data in a certain format can be imported into the simulator and optimal parameters can be
obtained by executing a simulation campaign. Hence, a dynamic network simulator is an
excellent tool for studying new features at network level and can provide valuable input and
cost savings to live network trials.
5.3.3.2
Basic Functionality
Simulation length is typically define
as simulation steps. The natural definitio
of a step
in GSM is a TDMA frame consisting of 8 time slots. During one simulation’s step, all
the necessary actions are executed for each mobile phone in the network. At first mobiles
are moved and then received power for bursts of each link in the simulation is calculated.
The interference situation in the network is then frozen for that time step, and carrier to
interference and noise power ratio C/(I+N) values are calculated for each active transmission
link. Transmission links are stored in an interference matrix. There are separate matrixes
for both downlink and uplink. A matrix is found effective and essential for the interference

accumulation loop over the active connections during a simulation step. Basic functionalities
of a system level simulation platforms are described in [1], Appendix E.
5.3.3.3
Cellular Models
SMART models logical connections and physical links between base station and cell phones.
The network topology has several options. Standard idealistic cellular models (hexagon macro
cells, “Manhattan” grid micro cells, indoor office are supported as well as digital terrain
maps. A theoretical propagation model is used for standardization cases, such as the Okumura-
Hata model. On the other hand, propagation data can be imported from customer networks.
Correlated multipath fast fading and slow fading, for example shadowing, models are supported
and these provide the expected performance of a radio link with feasible computational
complexity. Vehicular and pedestrian models are used with theoretical topologies. Path and
road mobility models are supported, but not commonly used. In the traffi model, calls arrive
according to Poisson distribution and their traffi profil service time follows exponential
distribution for circuit switched calls. Various packet data models are supported for the data
service (web browsing, FTP, email, video streaming).
The following cellular models are supported:
r Multipath fading
r Shadowing
r Distance-based attenuation or imported propagation data
r Adjacent channel interference
r Antenna patterns (omni-directional, 3 sectors, 6 sectors)
r Burst level interference modeling (Actual Value Interface)
r Realistic mobility models
r Different network configuration (frequency reuse, number of frequencies, number of TRXs,
layer modeling (BCCH/TCH)).
Radio resource modeling contains complete models of the following features:
r DTX
r Power control
r Handover algorithms
r Frequency hopping (cyclic/random hopping sequence).
The following GSM-specifi models are supported:
r Channel mode adaptation for logical channels
r Codec mode adaptation
r Full Rate codecs EFR, AMR, 8PSK AMR, WB-AMR
r Half Rate codecs AMR, 8PSK AMR
r VAMOS 1/OSC: Double FR, Double HR
r VAMOS 2/OSC: Double FR, Double HR
r EGPRS2: complete model (normal symbol rate and higher symbol rate)
r Optimized transmit pulse shapes for EGPRS2 (“WIDER”)

136
GSM/EDGE
r Dual Transfer Mode
r Enhanced QoS.
The latest features are implemented for 3GPP standardization purposes. WIDER and VA-
MOS/OSC models are implemented according to details proposed in 3GPP standardization
forum.
The following EGPRS2 features are modeled explicitly:
r Modulation and coding schemes
r RLC block split
r Interleaving
r USF handling
r WIDER pulse shapes.
The following VAMOS/OSC features are modeled in detail:
r Sub-Channel Power Imbalance Ratio (SCPIR)
r Sub-Channel Power control via modulation constellation (constellation power control)
r Channel mode adaptation
r Optimized transmit pulse shape.
It is important to model cellular network features explicitly. One critical part of the dynamic
system level simulator is the link-to-system interface (L2S). The system level simulator can
be adapted to use new physical layer features via L2S modeling. One such model is the
Actual Value Interface (AVI) table, where the expected link performance can be converted to
a mapping table, which maps the system level C/I to BER and BER further to FER or BLER
depending on the service. More information on the Link-to-System mapping can be found in
Section 5.3.4.
5.3.3.4
Simulation Parameters
Basic parameters are usually the same for the different simulation cases. Propagation models,
fast fading, slow fading and mobility models are not normally changed during the simulation
campaign. The general parameters are kept the same in all the simulations in this book if not
otherwise stated. The basic set-up for radio network engineering parameters is listed in
Table 5.1.
There is a set of parameters that are define for VAMOS/OSC and WIDER simulations in
3GPP standardization, see [2]. Scenarios are called MUROS according to the initial 3GPP
working item, when the OSC concept was introduced. See Tables 5.2 and 5.3.
5.3.4
Link-to-System Interface
System level simulators operate on discrete steps, reflectin
successive time periods when
a number of mobile users move through the network. Thus, at any given step, it needs to
evaluate the performance of each active link. However, executing the link-level simulator

for each active link results in a prohibitive amount of calculation. For example, determining
the link level performance for one link on a given step can take of the order of minutes,
and the network simulator typically operates on thousands of steps and thousands of links.
Furthermore, different network simulations are executed for different number of users. This
motivates the need for a fast calculation of the expected performance of a given link and this
interface is called the link-to-system interface (L2S).
5.3.4.1
Statistical Methods
Ultimately, the network simulator must estimate the throughput that a link has on a given step.
This depends on factors such as the attenuation experienced by the data signal, the symbol
modulation in use, the interference levels at the mobile position, the channel coding scheme
employed, and to some extent on the mobile speed. A modular approach is used to decouple the
effects of the fading channel and receiver, from the effects of the channel coding scheme. The
basic idea is to compute a throughput (equivalently BLER or FER) estimate from burst-wise
quality measures computed for the interleaving period [3, 4, 5]. Throughout this book, the

two-stage approach is referred to the link to the system level simulator interface and takes the
following general form:
1. Compute burst-wise signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) for a group of bursts
belonging to one interleaving period. Use a SINR to BER mapping to compute one BER
per SINR.
2. Compute the average and standard deviation of the burst-wise BERs. Use a BLER mapping
to read the expected BLER for the computed average and standard deviation.
The reliability of the simulated network performance largely depends on the accuracy of the
link-level performance modeling. If the SINR to BER mapping is biased to give higher or
lower error rates than the actual expected values, then the estimated user and cell throughputs
are likely to be pessimistic or optimistic, respectively. Therefore, verificatio techniques that
assess the accuracy of the whole mapping chain are typically employed. This ensures that the
predicted throughputs match the link-level results, at least on average.
The following sections describe each of the mapping stages, and the verificatio strategies
are summarized in Section 5.3.4.6.
5.3.4.2
First Stage Mappings: From Signal Powers to Bit Error Rates
A fundamental difference between these mappings for system simulation and the link level
results is that the expected BER is associated with an “instantaneous” SINR (i.e., the average
SINR over the particular burst under consideration), as opposed to the expected BER over a

Fundamentals of GSM Performance Evaluation
139
distribution of SINRs. For this reason, this mapping has been called the Actual Value Interface
(AVI) [5].
For a single antenna receiver, the firs stage is a SINR to BER mapping. This relationship
depends on the modulation employed, receiver characteristics such as phase noise and power
amplifie linearity, interference power statistics and spectral properties of the interfering sig-
nals. Indeed, for the same SINR, the expected BER is different for the cases of co-channel,
adjacent channel and mixtures of both types. Additionally, the modulation employed by the in-
terferers can have a large impact on the SINR to BER mapping. For example, the SAIC receiver
has interference rejection capabilities for GMSK-modulated co-channel interferers, but this
gain is largely lost for PSK or QAM-modulated interferers. Furthermore, user-multiplexing
techniques, such as VAMOS, exhibit additional variability, depending on the orthogonality
properties of the training sequences employed by the paired users.
A trade-off between modeling complexity and accuracy has been achieved with two alter-
native methods:
1. Derive the SINR to BER mapping from a link-level simulation where the statistics of the
interference levels of different interferer types (e.g., co-channel/adjacent channel, narrow/
wide band transmit pulse, GMSK/04/16/32QAM, single user/VAMOS multiplexed user
pair) have been derived from the system level simulations. This is done iteratively by
simulating with an initial SINR to BER mapping, then deriving an interference profile
upon which a new SINR to BER mapping is produced and fed to the system level simulator.
After one or two iterations, the profile and mappings do not change significantl . This is
the approach used for EGPRS2 and SAIC/OSC in Chapters 6 and 8 respectively.
2. Derive SINR to BER mappings from link-level simulations representing scenarios where
the mappings are substantially different, and implementing a mapping switching logic in
the network-level simulator. This logic can be based, for example, on the characteristics
of the dominant interferer during the burst. While this approach does not require system-
level simulations, it assumes a deep knowledge of the receiver performance characteristics.
On the other hand, the switching criteria need to be define
and tuned, and ultimately
subject to the verificatio
procedure. This is the approach employed for the VAMOS
study.
5.3.4.3
Interference Rejection Receivers
When more than one receive antenna is available, the receiver can use the associated diversity
to process the signal before the detection step. The basic idea is to exploit the short-term
correlation properties of the interfering signals, in order to maximize the signal to interference
ratio after processing. This is done by applying a whitening filte , followed by a maximum-ratio
combiner (MRC) filte . Both MRC and IRC concepts are well known and used extensively in
the uplink of current GSM networks.
In terms of the firs stage mapping, the number of variables has increased, compared
to the single antenna case. It is known that the performance of the IRC receiver depends
on the relationship between the different interfering powers suffered by the receiver. More
specificall , the ratios of the dominant interfering power to the aggregated power of the rest
of the interferers (dominant-to-rest interference ratio, DIR) play a key role: the higher the

140
GSM/EDGE
ratios, the better the IRC performance. Rather than associating the BER with the DIR and
SINR variables, we take the approach of firs computing a single approximate SINR from
all the user-signal and interfering signal powers. The SINR can then be associated with the
burst-wise BER, and a SINR to BER mapping can be derived. One possibility is to use the
classical SINR for the IRC filte in the presence of narrowband signals [6]. Another option
is to combine the per-antenna DIR and CIR values to produce a single [SINR, DIR] pair [7].
Both choices provide sufficien accuracy in terms of verificatio procedures.
5.3.4.4
OSC/VAMOS Uplink Receivers
The OSC/VAMOS concept allows two users to simultaneously share a frequency and a time
slot. For single antenna mobiles, the base station and the two users form a 2 x 2 multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system. On the side of the mobiles, the data transmission cannot
be coordinated, as opposed to a MIMO system with a single user employing two receive
antennas. In order to separate the data stream from both users, the base station employs an
iterative procedure known as successive interference cancellation (SIC), which consists of
three steps:
1. Sorting: determine which user has the larger SINR. Here, the IRC-style SINR can be used
by considering that user 1 is interference to user 2, and vice versa. This user is denoted
as the dominant user. Since there is one SINR per antenna per user, the maximum SINR
across antennas is used for classification
2. Cancellation: process the data for the dominant user with the IRC receiver and decode its
data stream. Rebuild the received signal from the decoded bits by using the channel estimate
which is required by the IRC filte , and subtract the rebuilt signal from the composite signal.
The quality of this cancellation depends on how close the rebuilt signal is to the true received
signal of the user that was decoded first
3. Use the signal after the cancellation step, to decode the other user.
The receiver could, of course, iterate this sequence by subtracting the second user from the
original composite signal and executing steps 1–3. However, this increases the computational
complexity of the algorithm and the increments in performance benefit become smaller with
each iteration.
From the firs stage mapping point, of view, the BER for both users is computed as
follows:
1. From the signal and interfering powers on the receiver antennas, compute IRC-style SINRs
as described in Section 5.3.4.3. Here, the signal power of user 1 is added to the list of
interfering powers of user 2, and vice versa. We denote the user with larger SINR as the
dominant user.
2. Use a SINR to BER mapping, which is specifi to the dominant user. The mapping is
selected on the basis of the maximum DIR across the user’s antennas. This assumes that a
set of mappings is available for different DIR values, and the value closest to the maximum
DIR is used.

Fundamentals of GSM Performance Evaluation
141
3. Assume that the cancellation of the dominant user signal is perfect, and compute a new
SINR for the other user. Use a SINR to BER mapping, which is specifi to the non-dominant
user. The mapping is selected from a set of curves, based on the maximum DIR, similar to
the previous point.
4. A burst-wise BER value for each user has been determined.
The channel estimation quality depends on the orthogonality properties of the training se-
quences used by the users. However, it turns out that mappings built for different sequence
pairs can be approximated by simple shifts of the mappings built for the best performing
pair. This simplifie the L2S slightly, because the system simulator only needs to apply a
sequence-pair dependent shift to the computed SINRs, instead of using different mappings for
the dominant and non-dominant user.
An example of the mappings for the dominant and non-dominant users, for different max-
imum DIR values is shown in Figure 5.3. This illustrates the performance of the training
sequence pair (0,8).

Second Stage Mapping: From BERs to FER/BLER
The second stage of the L2S takes the burst-wise BERs and gives an expected BLER, which
then determines the throughput of a link and ultimately the network performance. Modeling
the performance of channel coding schemes is in general not easy. However, the simplifie

model described in this section is widely used in network performance simulations, and is also
considered to be accurate enough for these purposes.
The second stage mapping predicts the BLER for a group of consecutive bursts, according
to the interleaving period of the channel coding scheme. This period is typically 4, 2 or 1 burst.
The BLER is approximated by a function of two variables: the average and standard deviation
of the burst-wise BERs, which we denote by µ and σ, respectively. There are two types of
(µ, σ) pairs that are of interest: those where the BLER is between zero and one, and those
where the surface is either zero or one.
Many channel coding schemes benefi from channel variations within the interleaving
period, for example, from frequency hopping. This is seen in the BLER surface by following
a line with constant µ, and observing that the BLER decreases as σ increases. This gain also
depends on the level of µ considered. On the other hand, one can identify a range for µ, outside
which the surface is either zero or one, regardless the value of σ. This range is of interest, as
the system simulator does not need to evaluate the BLER surface in these cases.
The use of frequency hopping has an impact on the range of σ values that can be observed
in the link and system-level simulations. For systems without frequency hopping, the BER
variability within the interleaving period is largely determined by the mobile speed. When
frequency hopping is used, however, the speed does not have a big impact in the distribution of
σ. It must be noted that µ and σ are not independent variables, because they are both computed
upon the same burst-wise BERs. Thus, at small values of µ, large values of σ are not possible.
This implies that the accuracy of the BLER mapping is more critical in certain zones, depending
on the usage of frequency hopping, the mobile speeds and the error-correction capabilities of
the channel coding scheme. The latter comes from the fact that high-rate coding schemes tend
to show an “on-off” behavior, that is, the range of µ over which the BLER is between zero
and one is very narrow. Finally, we point out that the performance of both convolutional and
turbo channel codes is modeled as a function of (µ, σ).
Figure 5.4 shows an example BLER surface, for MCS DBS8 of EGPRS2B downlink.

Mapping Chain Verificatio Procedures
One key aspect of the link performance modeling is its accuracy. The L2S is ultimately re-
sponsible for the network simulation results, because the throughput estimates of each link
are computed by the two-stage mapping procedure described in the previous sections. The
verificatio considered throughout this book assesses how close the mapping chain approxi-
mates the link-level BLER/FER results, for a given interference profil (e.g., a DTS-2 type of
scenario, or a custom interference profil derived from network simulations). The comparison
is done as follows:
1. Group consecutive simulated bursts according to the interleaving depth of the MCS under
consideration.
2. Use the mapping chain to determine whether the RLC blocks of the group were successfully
decoded.
a. Use the first-stag mapping to get burst-wise BERs.
b. Compute the average and standard deviation of the BERs of each group.
c. For each group, compute a BLER estimate with the second-stage mapping. Use this
estimate to draw binary random variables and assign decoding success/failure to the
RLC blocks of the group.
3. Compute the L2S-predicted BLER as the ratio of blocks marked as failure in 2.C) to the
total number of simulated blocks.
4. Repeat steps 1–3 for each point in the link-level BLER curve, and compare the predicted
BLER with the actual BLER given by the link-level simulator.
The accuracy of the L2S has a different impact on the system-level simulator results, depending
on the BLER levels at which the whole chain is not accurate. For example, if the network is
designed to operate at 10% BLER, errors in the mapping chain for BLER levels below 1% may
have a negligible impact in the system-level results. Similarly, inaccuracies at BLER levels over
20 or 30% may only produce slight distortions in the throughput percentiles representing the
cell edges. The L2S mappings employed throughout this book typically show an accuracy of
1 dB or better, at 10% BLER. The accuracy of the L2S tends to worsen with larger constellation
sizes. For example, MCS for EGPRS2 using QPSK tend to be more accurate than MCS using
32QAM, especially at lower BLER levels.
An example of the verificatio procedure result is shown in Figure 5.5.

Key Performance Indicators

Key Performance Indicators for Link Level Analysis
Commonly agreed Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are fundamental when specifying and
comparing the performance between transmitter and receiver. The aim of the standardization is
to specify the expected minimum performance requirement, but not to specify the methodology
how to achieve the target performance. This way, each mobile and network vendor can develop
high performing platforms with a proprietary cost-efficien architecture, and ensure the network
operation and compliant performance are define by the 3GPP standard.

5.4.1.1
Bit Error Ratio and Received Signal Quality
The bit error ratio (BER) in GSM systems represents the likelihood of a misinterpreted bit
between the transmitter and receiver in a communications link due to noise and interference.
That is, BER represents the signal quality over the air interface. BER is a function of energy
quantity per transmitted bit to noise power spectral density ratio of the desired signal, Eb/N0.
BER can be measured simply by dividing the number of erroneous bits received with the total
number of transmitted bits. For a communications link, the simplest form of performance
measure is typically done in an Additive White-Gaussian-Noise channel (AWGN). For any
practical wireless application the realistic radio propagation channels with different mobile
station velocities need to be evaluated in terms of BER. These prototype propagation channels,
such as Typical Urban, Hilly Terrain and Rural Area, are specifie in [8].
In GSM, both the mobiles and the base transceiver stations estimate BER and report the
result to the Base Station Controller (BSC) where BER is used as a measure to control the
traffi channel parameters and management, such as handover and power control decisions.
BER is stored in BSC also for statistical purposes, where the network average performance
can be monitored and optimized over different traffi profile such as busy hour traffi and
night time. Along with the performance requirements, also the BER measurement reporting
accuracy and reliability are standardized. Received Signal Quality (RXQual) represents the
average bit error rate over the measurement period in signal quality reporting over a slow
associated common control channel frame of 480 ms (SACCH).

Fundamentals of GSM Performance Evaluation
145
5.4.1.2
Frame Erasure Ratio
For GSM, the Frame Erasure Ratio (FER) is the ratio of discarded speech frames compared
to all the received speech frames. A speech frame is generally discarded if after the decoding
and error correction process a speech frame is considered to be corrupted. It is better to reject
a suspicious or an erroneous frame rather than pass it onto the speech decoding, since a bad
frame usually degrades the subjective speech quality.
The FER is a measure of how successfully the speech frame was received after the error
correction process. Therefore it is a better indication of the subjective speech quality compared
to the RXQUAL, which gives an estimate of the link quality in terms of BER, but does not
indicate the distribution of errors over the measurement period.
Different speech codecs will have a slightly different FER to MOS correlation (Mean
Opinion Score), since the higher the speech codec bit rate is, the more sensitive it becomes to
frame erasures, thus degrading the quality experienced.
5.4.1.3
Block Error Ratio
Similarly to FER, Block Error Ratio (BLER) is a ratio of discarded data service blocks
compared to all the received data blocks. A data block is generally discarded if the block-wise
decoding of data header fails or if any of the received bits is found to be erroneous after the
decoding and error correction process.
5.4.2
Key Performance Indicators for System Level Analysis
In system level simulations the chosen relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are analyzed
to understand how the studied features are performing. The same KPIs are also used in the fiel
trial, thus making it possible to compare the simulation with the real live network performance.
There are various KPIs define for voice and data services. Table 5.4 and Table 5.5 contain
information on the most common KPIs that are being used in the latest standardization
contributions. Detailed descriptions of the KPIs are found in [1].
5.5
EFL Methodology1
The spectral efficien y (SE) of a deployed cellular network is very hard to quantify in practice.
This is due to the fact that cellular networks have an operating point in terms of local traffi
load, which varies due to busy hour, site-to-site configuratio
and different geographical
conditions, for example. The performance measurements collected during a trial, will identify
the performance of the network associated with the traffi
load at each operating point.
However, this information is not sufficien to measure the Spectral Efficien y of the measured
network, because it is usually not possible to quantify the maximum capacity without driving
the network to a maximum load condition. This is the point where the average load during the
measurement period exceeds the maximum achievable capacity.

Network Performance Characterization
The Effective Frequency Load (EFL) quantifie how much of each available frequency can
be loaded in the system [9]. It is independent of the frequency reuse and deployed TRX
configuration
When EFL methodology is deployed in the system under evaluation, it is possible to
estimate the load associated with any benchmark quality. Maximum network capacity for a
given benchmark quality can be calculated, or how much the network quality will degrade as the
predicted load increases. EFL is directly proportional to the traffi and inversely proportional
to the available bandwidth.
In real networks the traffi
load is fi ed but the number of frequencies deployed can
be modifie
in order to increase the EFL. During trials the network performance can be
characterized by modifying the number of frequencies used.
Figure 5.6 displays the characterization of a sample network. As an example both the BCCH
and frequency hopping layers have been characterized to indicate a much differentiated perfor-
mance. Typically there is hardly any degradation on BCCH layer performance, because BCCH
TRX is always transmitting at full nominal power to meet the cell coverage, even if the tempo-
rary load decreases or increases. On the other hand, the hopping layer experiences degradation
as load increases, as expected. The overall network performance using the allocated frequency

resource will be the combination of both layers weighted by the traffi distribution per layer.
Different ELF points in the 1/1 hopping curve mean that each EFL point represents a different
hopping configuration while in the BCCH layer the different traffi load operating points are
mainly due to different channel allocation strategies.
5.5.1.1
Network Capacity
GSM voice spectral efficien y is used to quantify the number of voice users a network (or
site or cell) is able to carry for a given spectrum. A spectrum is a limited resource for GSM,
where a large number of subscribers continuously load the network. Moreover, in many
countries portions of the same spectrum are allocated to new systems such as UMTS900 and
E-UTRAN/LTE. Re-farming of GSM spectrum to new systems has started and therefore it
would be beneficia to optimize GSM to use a narrower spectrum with the same target quality
and level of service. GSM voice performance is a very important asset to maintain since most
of the subscriber voice traffi will be carried in the GSM networks.
In this book, network capacity is measured using the EFL formula (Equation 5.1) [1]:

(5.2)
where
Ave#(TSL/TRX) has been considered to be 8 time slots.
EFL can easily be calculated from the system-level simulation or from the network fiel trial.
EFL provides a direct measure of how loaded the frequency resources are. In this book, EFL
has been used as a measure of voice traffi load and Spectral Efficien y.
One way to improve the network SE is to use a tighter frequency reuse factor. As Figure 5.7
shows, the GSM network utilizing AMR voice and enhanced radio resource management
algorithms can be operated at tighter frequency reuses. Tighter frequency reuse factor enables
more TRXs per cell when the available spectrum is limited.
Starting from the introduction of the initial GSM technology, the relative frequency reuse
has been reduced three times to a lower number by applying standardized features and sup-
porting proprietary features in the network. As shown in Figure 5.7, GSM voice evolution
OSC/VAMOS allows usage of looser frequency reuses since the hardware efficien y is doubled,
for example the number of voice channels per TRX is doubled. Even further improvements
would be possible utilizing GSM Evolution features standardized in 3GPP Release 7. For
example, mobile station diversity with OSC/VAMOS could be leading GSM networks to even
higher spectrum efficien y and tighter frequency reuses.

Further Reading
There are several documents on the 3GPP standards, which support not only the performance
requirements but also the network level design and technology deployment. Documents closely
related to link performance engineering are given in the 3GPP TR 45 “Radio Aspects” series,
which is useful reading when working with the radio performance engineering details. For
system-level information, the 3GPP TR 43.030 “Technical Realization” series contains several
documents where the technical deployment scenarios are explained. This is especially useful
for radio network planning aspects.

Introduction
The GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) is today’s backbone of mobile communi-
cations, providing worldwide access and roaming for voice and packet data services. Current
deployments of GPRS and especially the widespread rollout of EDGE in existing GPRS net-
works have opened the door to worldwide mobile internet services [1]. Commercially available
mobile stations with a typical downlink multi-slot capability of 4 to 5 time slots support appli-
cation peak data rates of up to 75–90 kbps with GPRS and 225–275 kbps with EDGE [2]. The
aim of the upcoming GERAN data evolution features is to significantl increase capacity and
spectrum efficien y along with a boost in user throughput and significantl reduced overall
latency [3].
The principal GERAN data evolution feature is the EGPRS2 concept, a comprehensive
feature package including the introduction of higher order modulation schemes (such as QPSK,
16-QAM and 32-QAM) along with 20% increased symbol rate, spectrally wide transmit pulse
shaping filte and turbo coding. Other essential features are mobile station receive diversity,
reduced latency by improved multiplexing schemes and fast Ack/Nack reporting [4, 5]. A
detailed study of the EGPRS2 performance deployed in the GSM uplink can be found in [6].
3GPP Release 7 also introduced Downlink Dual Carrier (DLDC), where the user’s signal
bandwidth can be increased on the downlink, potentially increasing the throughput twofold or
even more. EGPRS2 in combination with DLDC, in particular, will break through the current
4–5 TS MS limit to up theoretical 16 time slots per connection, and open the possibility of
four times higher data rates compared to conventional single carrier EDGE and resulting data

rates up to 1.89 Mbps in downlink. GSM evolution is essential for data service continuity
with HSPA and LTE, since today 68% of EDGE networks and the majority of EDGE devices
support HSPA.
This chapter is organized as follows. Section 6.2 briefl discusses the GSM data performance
evolution, and the performance evaluation of the new EGPRS2 physical layer is presented in
Section 6.3. System level performance evaluations for data services are discussed for EGPRS2
and Downlink Dual Carrier in Sections 6.4 and 6.5 respectively. Dual Transfer Mode for
simultaneous voice and data traffi is studied in Section 6.6. Finally, Section 6.7 gives a
summary of the data performance enhancements for GSM Evolution.
6.2
Overview of GSM Data Performance Evolution
General packet radio service (GPRS) introduced the convenience of “always online” direct
internet connections adding packet switching to GSM with a packet-based air interface on top
of the current circuit switched mode of operation. These standards and their evolution have
enabled the firs sophisticated end-user services of mobile internet connectivity and personal
multimedia.
In 3GPP Release 99, Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was introduced to
boost network capacity and the data rates of GPRS threefold. EDGE is especially attractive
to GSM 900, GSM 1800 and GSM 1900 operators that do not have a license for UMTS, but
still wish to offer competitive personal multimedia applications utilizing the existing band
allocation. EDGE was designed to be backward-compatible with GSM with the support of
GMSK modulation while allowing improved data transmission rates and a data throughput
peak rate over 400 kbps per carrier. EDGE networks deployments started in 2000–01. EDGE
has become a huge success and has outgrown the number of fi ed internet connections, which
typically use local area network connections and DSL. Today EDGE is supported by many
chip vendors and all major mobile vendors.
In 3GPP Release 7, GSM data evolution also called EDGE Evolution, Evolved EDGE or
EDGE II, is an upgraded version of GSM technology that was ratifie by the 3GPP. Release
7 enhances GSM data performance through many techniques, which can be deployed in the
network independently or as a combination of features. These new features apply some of
the techniques employed also in HSPA and LTE to increase the data throughput while lowering
the transmission latency.
In Release 7, a key part of the evolution is the utilization of two radio frequency carriers, a
technique called Downlink Dual-Carrier (DLDC). This is designed to overcome the inherent
limitation of the narrow channel bandwidth of a single GSM carrier. DLDC enables higher
effective channel bandwidth for user data. These carriers can be allocated independently
along with the existing frequency hopping carrier allocation, thus allowing compatibility with
network frequency plans and fast deployments in existing networks. For example, DLDC with
ten time slots per connection enables peak rates above 1 Mbit/s and typical average data rates
of 400 kbps or more can be expected.
Another important step for GSM data evolution in the 3GPP Release 7 was the introduction
of EGPRS2, which specifie higher symbol rate (HSR) and higher order modulations for the
downlink and uplink directions. Higher symbol rate with spectrally wide transmit pulse shaping
filte means higher bandwidth, which is now increased to 325 kHz exceeding the normal

EGPRS2 and Downlink Dual Carrier Performance
153
270 kHz symbol rate by 20%. Higher symbol rate is combined with three new modulations
QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM. As a result, EGPRS2 provides 118.4 kbps peak rates per time
slot, which is double compared to EDGE maximum data rate of 59.2 kbps per time slot. When
combining the DLDC with EGPRS2-B, up to 16 time slots can be used with a higher symbol
rate, thus providing the GSM data evolution maximum peak rate of 1.89 Mbps.
GSM data evolution brings not only improvements in the highest peak rate but also in the
average bit rates which is especially beneficia to users who do not have access to the latest
technical steps of LTE or HSPA due to lack of network coverage or lack of support in the user
equipment. The launch of GSM data evolution means a dramatic increase in average data rates.
All the user equipment that is capable of GSM Rel-7 evolution services is also backwards
compatible with the EDGE systems. In many cases, GSM data evolution can be implemented
as a software upgrade of infrastructure hardware in existing networks.
The transferred volume of wireless data is growing fast and is expected to reach 100 times the
data transmitted today during the next stages of evolution in the wireless systems. Technologies
such as WLAN, HSPA and LTE increase the usage of data services and this will increase the
volume of GSM data transmission as well. Therefore the spectrum resource allocated to GSM
should be maintained and continuously improved.

EGPRS2 Link Performance
6.3.1
Overview
In this section the performance of radio link is studied in downlink and uplink. Perfor-
mance is usually characterized in sensitivity and interference-limited conditions to reflec the
nature of a cellular network with limited coverage and spectrum resource. For data services
the performance is usually evaluated in terms of throughput per time slot of connection. In
many cases the throughput gain is based on the link-level improvement, such as EGPRS2,
where both the symbol rate and modulation have been improved to double the data throughput
per time slot compared to EGPRS.
GERAN data services consist of a layered protocol structure, and the EGPRS2 concept
has an impact only to the radio interface protocols below the Logical Link Control (LLC).
EGPRS2 can seamlessly co-exist with other GSM data. Therefore, the EGPRS2 concept does
not require any new base station sites or new spectrum, and has no impact on the existing
cell or frequency plans. The EGPRS2 services come with two Network and Mobile Station
(NW/MS) support levels, namely Level A and Level B (which may be deployed depending
on network capabilities) and two transmit pulse shaping options for the uplink are define for
EGPRS2 support Level B, where either the Linearized GMSK pulse or a new spectrally wide
pulse shape can be selected by the network.
6.3.2
Simulation Models
The performance of the EGPRS2 concept has been studied by means of classic link-level
simulations for both downlink and uplink, and for both support levels A and B, using the
available transmit pulse shaping options. The link simulation chain used for this performance
evaluation was discussed in Chapter 5. This is a one-way link between one transmitter and

154
GSM/EDGE
one receiver. For this performance study, the block error rate (BLER), the bit error rate before
channel decoding (RawBER) and the throughput per time slot are evaluated.
In downlink, a single antenna mobile station is assumed while in the uplink, a dual antenna
base station employing interference cancellation is assumed (antenna diversity is used in the
vast majority of base stations). Channel coding is implemented according to 3GPP Release
7. The multi-path radio propagation channel is Typical Urban channel model, with a mobile
speed of 3 km/h with ideal frequency hopping, which is also reflecte in the naming convention
of the simulation scenarios, for example TU3 ideal FH.
Frequency hopping has been either disabled, or assumed to be ideal. Ideal frequency hopping
means that tne radio channel does not have a memory and consecutive radio bursts do not
correlate.
Noise- and interference-limited scenarios are simulated with Additive White Gaussian Noise
and single co-channel interference (C/I) scenario respectively.
Table 6.1 gives an overview of the modulation and coding schemes available in GERAN
for packet switched data transmission along with the RLC maximum data rate per time slot.
Table 6.1 also shows the code rate used in forward error correction (FEC) for different
EGPRS and EGPRS2 modulation and coding schemes. The code rate is define as the ratio
between number of bits given as the input to the channel encoder to the number of bits
coming out of the encoding and puncturing or rate matching process. The encoding process
involves addition of systematic redundancy bits and, therefore, the lower value of FEC code
rate indicates more redundant bits, stronger coding and better protection against impairments
in radio channel. A value of 1.0 implies no coding gain.
EGPRS service offers a peak throughput of 59.2 kbps (MCS-9), while EGPRS2 offers
118.4 kbps – double that of EGPRS. EGPRS2 level A, however, offers peak throughput of
98.4 kbps in the downlink (DAS-12) and 76.8 kbps in the uplink (UAS-11). Owing to the weak
channel coding, these coding schemes (i.e. MCS-9, DAS-12, UAS-11, DBS-12, and UBS-
12) can achieve peak throughputs only in good radio conditions. However, EGPRS2 offers
significantl better throughput than EGPRS even in moderate and poor channel conditions.
This is explained further in following sub-sections.
6.3.3
EGPRS Reference Link Performance
EGPRS performance has been evaluated as a reference performance level for EGPRS2. Fig-
ures 6.1 to 6.4 provide the link-level performance of EGPRS coding schemes MCS-1 to
MCS-9. Some of these coding schemes are also reused in EGPRS2 service, and hence the
link performances of these schemes are the same between EGPRS and EGPRS2. The plots
show BLER and RawBER performance at different input signal levels in the case of noise
limited scenario (sensitivity) and at different C/I ratios in the case of an interference-limited
scenario.
The reference RawBER performance of 8PSK modulation scheme is clearly worse than
that of GMSK modulation scheme, indicating the expected coverage with GMSK modulated
coding schemes should be the best of the EGPRS coding schemes. However, owing to strong
channel coding used in MCS-5 and MCS-6 (both 8PSK), the performance of these chan-
nels is better than MCS-4 and sometimes than MCS-3 which have relatively weak channel
coding.

At a higher signal level or C/I, MCS-7 even outperforms MCS-4. This clearly shows that
mobiles not supporting 8PSK modulation will not achieve expected EGPRS throughput even
when the channel conditions are below average.
It is worth noting that the link performance is significantl different between downlink and
uplink in interference-limited conditions, because the base station receiver uses a diversity
combining with interference cancellation.
6.3.4
EGPRS2 Link Performance
EGPRS2 downlink performance was evaluated using the same link-level simulation, except
the concept level details were modifie according to EGPRS2 requirements. The results are
grouped into Level A and Level B and presented in the following sub-sections. Only BLER
and RawBER of different coding schemes are presented as link-level performance.

almost equal to MCS-5 and MCS-6 due to the same modulation and almost the same channel
coding specification DAS-7 performs significantl better than MCS-7 despite using the same
modulation because the former is protected by the FEC code rate of 0.54 while the latter is
protected by the code rate of 0.75.
Weaker coding schemes, that is, DAS-10, 11 and 12, show a reasonable performance
only at high C/I levels. DAS-12, in particular, experiences an error floo which indicates
that the peak throughput of this coding scheme is difficul to achieve in this propagation
scenario.
6.3.4.2
EGPRS2 Level B Downlink
Figures 6.6 and 6.7 show the EGPRS2 Level B downlink performance in an interference-
limited scenario. Figure 6.6 shows performance with the Linearized GMSK pulse shape filte
in the transmitter. This is the narrow-band legacy filte specifie in 3GPP TS 45.004. Figure 6.7
shows the performance when using the spectrally wide pulse shape filte (Chapter 4, WIDER)
designed for higher symbol rate transmission and reception in the downlink.

As seen in the case of level A, the weaker coding schemes, for example, DBS-11 and DBS-
12, show reasonable performance only at high C/I and with a spectrally wide transmitter filte .
With a spectrally narrow filte , these coding schemes hit the error floo too early. Simulation
results indicate that the transmitter pulse shaping filte should be matched to the modulation
symbol rate of the transmitted signal to achieve the full potential of the EGPRS2 higher symbol
rate data service.
Stronger coding schemes of EGPRS2 Level B, for example DBS-5 and DBS-6, show a
good performance, which is comparable to MCS-1 and MCS-2. Comparison of their actual
throughput is discussed later on in this section.

EGPRS2 Uplink Performance
EGPRS2 uplink performance was also evaluated using link-level simulation. The results are
grouped into Level A and Level B and presented in the following sub-sections. Only BLER

EGPRS2 Level A Uplink
In the uplink, EGPRS2 Level A supports MCS-1 to MCS-6 using legacy modulation schemes
and UAS-7 to UAS-11 using the new modulation scheme, namely 16-QAM. Figure 6.8
shows the link-level performance of only UAS-7 to UAS-11 coding schemes in co-channel
interference scenario. Earlier sub-section 6.3.3 on the EGPRS reference link performance has
already profile MCS-1 to 6 performance.
When comparing Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.8, it is clear that UAS coding schemes start to
contribute to the link performance where MCS-1 to 6 coding schemes reach the limit of their
performance.
6.3.5.2
EGPRS2 Level B Uplink
EGPRS2 Level B performance for uplink was evaluated using link-level simulation in co-
channel interference scenario for both spectrally narrow and wide pulse transmitter shaping
filters Figure 6.9 shows the performance with the linearized GMSK pulse shape filte in the
transmitter. This is the same pulse shaping filte as used in EGPRS, and is also referred to as the
spectrally narrow pulse shape. Its performance evaluation indicates about the same limitations
as in the downlink when using LGMSK filte , which is not matched to the higher symbol
rate.

Figure 6.10, on the other hand, shows the link performance with the spectrally wide pulse
shape filte as specifie in 3GPP TS 45.004 for uplink only. The weaker coding schemes in
the uplink, for example, UBS-11 and UBS-12, show quite good performance at high C/I and
it is possible to achieve a performance quite close to the peak throughput in realistic network
conditions. The robust coding schemes perform well in average network conditions and show
doubled throughput throughout the whole practical C/I range.
6.3.6
EGPRS2 Pulse Shaping Filters
In 3GPP TS 45.004, two transmit pulse shaping filte types are specifie for EGPRS2 uplink:
(1) a spectrally wide pulse, optimized for throughput performance at the higher symbol rate;
and (2) the existing linearized GMSK pulse, for scenarios where the wide pulse shape might
not be suitable. For example, the narrow pulse can be used in scenarios where the edge channels
in a network operator’s bandwidth allocation are next to another network allocation and there
is no guard channel, or EGPRS2 data layer interferes with another service layer of the same
operator’s network.
Figures 6.11 a) and b) show a performance comparison of the wide and narrow Tx pulse
shape filter in uplink in sensitivity and co-channel interference scenarios. Performance is

given as throughput for selected coding schemes at different input signal levels (noise limited)
and C/I levels (co-channel interference). Sensitivity performance is important for coverage
and Figure 6.11(a) shows about 5 dB loss due to narrow pulse shaping for the high bit rate
coding schemes. At a moderate input level, the wide pulse provides a throughput improvement
of about 40 kbps compared to the narrow pulse and more than double the throughput at high
signal levels.
Interference-limited networks are co-channel limited in most cases, thus a higher adjacent
channel interference by a wider transmit spectrum is partly compensated for by the lower co-
channel interference from the pulse shape. At the network level, the expected shorter transmit
time will further reduce the impact of higher adjacent channel interference. Figure 6.11(b)
shows that the narrow Tx filte will result in about 4 dB loss in the case of UBS-12 in an
interference-limited scenario.
No decision had been made at the time of writing about the specificatio of a spectrally wide
pulse shape for the downlink, which is currently being evaluated as part of a study in 3GPP
[7]. Figure 6.12 shows that, with the narrow Tx filte , the level B peak throughput (contributed
by DBS-11) is similar to the level A peak throughput (contributed by DAS-12). Note that, due
to high level of block errors, the throughput of DBS-12 with the narrow Tx filte is lower than
that of DBS-11. This clearly underlines the importance of wide pulse shape filte in downlink.

6.3.7
Incremental Redundancy in EGPRS2
Incremental redundancy is a crucial feature in EGPRS and EGPRS2 to improve the data
throughput with retransmissions. Each coding scheme in EGPRS2 has multiple puncturing
patterns, which support the efficien combining of soft bits from repeated transmissions of same
user data. Each retransmission adds some time diversity and increases the coded robustness
of the user signal.
Figure 6.13 shows an example of the incremental redundancy performance in EGPRS2-B
downlink. The throughput improvement is mainly seen in cases of moderate or poor radio
conditions and in weaker coding schemes (e.g., DBS-12). In stronger coding schemes (e.g.
DBS-5) or in very good channel conditions, the delay associated with retransmissions offsets
the gain achieved by improved channel decoding.
6.3.8
Effect of Frequency Hopping
Frequency hopping has a mixed impact on link-level performance as seen in Figure 6.14 for
EGPRS2-B and Figure 6.15 for EGPRS. There is a gain from hopping for the stronger coding
schemes in the low C/I regions. In other cases, frequency hopping is giving no gain or degrades
performance. This behavior is expected in EGPRS and same conclusions apply to EGPRS2 for
the equivalent code rates. For the high bit rate codecs with least robust coding, the increased
variance of the radio channel makes errors more probable, while channel coding is insufficien
to correct them.

From the performance point of view, EGPRS2-B with frequency hopping enabled can
provide better or equal C/I limited performance throughout the whole practical C/I range
compared to EGPRS. At 15 dB C/I where EGPRS achieves its peak rate of 59.2 kbps,
EGPRS2-B throughput is 115 kbps, that is close to the peak throughput of 118.4 kbps.
6.3.9
EGPRS vs. EGPRS2 RLC Throughput
Figures 6.16 and 6.17 show the comparison of overall throughput of EGPRS and EGPRS2.
These plots represent the throughput envelope vs. input level of all the coding schemes of
respective services in EGPRS, EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B. These envelopes represent the
ideal RLC throughput of each service. For this analysis, EGPRS service takes into account
MCS-1 to MCS-9 while EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B consider only the new modulation and
coding schemes. It can be seen that the EGPRS2 service offers significan throughput gains
over EGPRS. At the very low signal levels (e.g. less than −104 dBm in downlink and less than
−109 dBm in uplink), EGPRS2-B is equal to EGPRS because GMSK modulation has been
specifie as part of EGPRS2.
EGPRS2 Level A is not able to provide significantl better throughput than EGPRS unless
the radio conditions are fairly good. In other words, throughput improvement by EGPRS2
Level A compared to EGPRS service cannot be sustained over the whole cell coverage area.
EGPRS2 Level B service provides better coverage and throughput compared to EGPRS
throughout the whole practical signal level range. At high signal levels, EGPRS2 Level B

Conclusion
This chapter presents the GSM/EDGE data evolution concept EGPRS2, which has been stan-
dardized in 3GPP Release 7. The key aspects of the link-level transmission techniques were
described, and link-level performance results were provided for EGPRS and EGPRS2. It was
shown that EGPRS2 level A outperforms EGPRS with a 30% higher data peak rate. However,
EGPRS2-A does not improve the coverage of the packet data services. With EGPRS2-B,
the peak rate is 100% higher and the link simulations with the wide transmit pulse showed
about 15 kbps per time slot better data rates in average network conditions which increased to
twice the peak rate in good conditions. EGPRS2-B codecs are able to improve the packet
data service throughout the whole cell, whereas EGPRS2-A has some improvements at
good network conditions but does not provide gain, when the network conditions are below
average.
The use of different traffi
layers to deploy voice and data services can decrease the
overall impact to legacy services [6]. Reduced transmission times associated with the higher
throughputs of EGPRS2-B can compensate for the increased ACI power, in interference-
limited networks.

EGPRS2 System Performance
In this section, EGPRS2 performance is evaluated and discussed based on results obtained from
a dynamic system-level network simulator. First, the simulation assumptions are described,
such as scenarios, network layout and set-up, simulated services, RRM algorithms and the key
performance indicators. Finally, the simulation results are presented and the conclusions are
drawn.
6.4.1
Simulation Assumptions
EGPRS2 system performance evaluations were performed to compare the performance of
EGPRS, EGPRS2 level A and EGPRS2 level B (using wide pulse, for example WIDER,
Chapter 4, Data Evolution) by running data-only simulations. Also the aim was to see the
difference in connection throughput and evaluate the impact to speech users of EGPRS2 level
B with different pulse shapes. For these simulations, both data and speech connections were
simulated simultaneously within the same network.
6.4.1.1
Scenarios
The simulations were performed in a homogeneous hexagonal grid network containing
75 cells. Three cells were grouped in a site. Time slots were synchronized in the whole
network, TDMA frames were aligned within a site and randomly aligned between different
sites.

For the data-only simulations three scenarios were defined two interference-limited scenar-
ios with different resources and frequency hopping arrangement (A, B) and one noise-limited
non-hopping scenario (C).
For the pulse shape comparison, the scenarios specifie in the 3GPP study into the spectrally
wide pulse shapes [7] (referred to as the WIDER study) were utilized. In this case the WIDER-
1 scenario was split into two separate scenarios to investigate the performance in BCCH and
TCH layers independently. The scenario parameters are summarized in Tables 6.2 to 6.6.
6.4.1.2
RRM Description
In scenarios A and C, there was only one BCCH transceiver per BTS, with the firs time slot
reserved for BCCH and the remaining time slots dedicated to packet data traffic as shown in
Figure 6.18.
In scenario B, there were three transceivers per BTS: one BCCH and two hopping. The
BCCH transceiver was blocked for traffi and all the data traffi was carried by the two hopping
transceivers, see Figure 6.19.
The WIDER scenarios had the time slot resources configure according to Figure 6.20.
Power control was used in uplink direction only. In downlink, full transmit power was used
with a back-off which depended on the current burst’s modulation. The back-off values are
listed in Table 6.7.
All packet data services used modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptation, where the
adaptation algorithm selected the MCS providing maximum throughput, based on past link

6.4.1.3
Simulated Services
Data connections consisted of FTP single fil
downloads using terminals with EGPRS,
EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B with narrow and spectrally wide transmit pulse shaping filte
support (LGMSK pulse and pulse candidates 2 and 3 from WIDER). Mobile terminals sup-
ported up to four time slots in downlink. The traffi generation model was very simple: one
block of data in one direction representing one file There was neither FTP control signaling
nor TCP signaling modeled.
This service represented the worst case for measuring throughput under various loads.
The highest load point was when the network reached saturation, that is when the rate of
newly arriving data calls roughly equaled the rate of ending calls. The observed performance
indicators are summarized in Section 6.4.1.4, connection throughput being the most important
performance indicator in this case.
The second service was circuit-switched speech using AMR codec adaptation on a full-rate
channel.

Key Performance Indicators
In the pure data simulations, an FTP service was used by all terminals with performance
indicators of mean connection throughput and throughput versus distance from BTS.
Connection throughput was calculated as the amount of transmitted data divided by the time
needed for error-free transmission. Mean connection throughput is the arithmetic mean of all
simulated connections.
Throughput versus distance from BTS shows the average throughput relative to the BTS to
which the terminal is associated. The throughput samples were taken in one second intervals.
The indicator demonstrated the level of throughput gain at the cell edge or gains in coverage
(i.e. the gain in coverage given a fi ed throughput reference such as EGPRS). Cell edge was
here define as distance from BTS, beyond which only 10% of the samples remained.
In addition to the above, a throughput map was collected showing the average throughput
versus network location. Also here the sample duration was one second.
For the mixed data and speech simulations, the most important performance indicators
were 10th, 50th and 90th-percentile connection throughputs and proportion of speech users
experiencing 1% frame erasure rate (FER) or less.

FTP in Downlink
This section shows results of the FTP service evaluated in the downlink using the scenarios
described in Section 6.4.1.1. The FTP service was configure
according to the description
in Section 6.4.1.3. The FTP service in downlink was used to compare the throughput for
EGPRS, EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B. For statistical confidenc the simulations consist of
10,000 connections per data point in the graph.
Figures 6.21, 6.23 and 6.25 (b) show the mean throughput for EGPRS, EGPRS2 A and B

with EGPRS2 relative to EGPRS. Positive gains are observed which ranged from 7–55% for
EGPRS2-A and 40–82% for EGPRS2-B.
Figures 6.21, 6.23 and 6.25 (a) show the minimum guaranteed throughput achieved in 90%
of the samples. In all the figures a significan gain in the 10th percentile throughput can be
seen with EGPRS2-B relative to EGPRS and EGPRS2-A. While EGPRS2-A shows a loss in
the 10th percentile throughput for scenario A, in scenario B it shows a significan improvement
in throughput compared to EGPRS.
When considering the network level performance results for BCCH layer in Figure 6.22 (a),
the throughput with EGPRS2-A and -B increases as the distance reduces. With EGPRS2-A,
the throughput decreases at a faster rate with distance than EGPRS2-B.
Figure 6.24 (a) shows a more constant throughput behavior with distance. Figure 6.26 (a)
shows throughput over a higher distance range than Figure 6.22 (a) and Figure 6.24 (a).
When comparing scenarios A and C (where the only difference is the higher site-to-site
distance in scenario C), it is seen that EGPRS2-B throughput for a higher site-to-site distance
is comparable to EGPRS throughput in scenario A. The results indicate that PS spectrum
resources can be reduced or eliminated in certain BTSs to save costs without degradation of
performance.
Table 6.10 shows the average throughput gain of EGPRS2 (A and B) over EGPRS for
different offered load points. FTP throughput indicates that EGPRS2-B network performance

tions consist of 10,000 connections per data point in the graph.
Table 6.11 shows the average throughput gain of EGPRS2 (A and B) over EGPRS at
different offered load points. It can be seen that the EGPRS2-B performance is higher than
EGPRS2-A in all scenarios. Note that even higher gains can be expected for EGPRS2-A and
-B with further optimizations of the link adaptation algorithm.
6.4.2.3
FTP Uplink and Downlink Comparison
By comparing Figure 6.22 (a) with Figure 6.28 (a) and Figure 6.24 (a) with Figure 6.30 (a), it
can be seen that throughput increases in the uplink with distance from the BTS. This behavior
is explained by the IRC receiver and power control in uplink.
Figure 6.33 shows the CIR over distance for Scenario A and B. The performance gain of
the uplink compared to the downlink is evident in both scenarios.

details about these pulse shapes can be found in Chapter 4 and in [7]. The reference simulation
uses the Linearized GMSK transmit pulse (narrow pulse, N) and a data traffi load set to
saturation, that is the highest rate of arriving data calls which the network still managed to
serve and match with the rate of ending calls.1 The offered load in the simulations with wide
pulse shapes W1 and W2 was roughly the same as in the reference simulation.
1 The data calls were never blocked due to insufficien resources. Rather, once the data terminals arrived in the
network, they were waiting idle (if there were currently insufficien resources available).

Figure 6.34 shows the impact of wide pulse used in the data connections to the voice
quality of the speech connections. In general, the impact was rather negligible and there was
no significan difference between wide pulse shape candidates 1 and 2. The biggest impact
is observed in the WIDER-1 BCCH scenario, as a result of the large proportion of resources
dedicated to data traffic
However, the wide pulse has a significan impact on the connection throughput as shown in
Figure 6.35 and Figure 6.36. The median throughput gains with the pulse shape candidate W1
ranges from 36–44%, while pulse shape candidate W2 provides slightly less gains – between
31% and 39%, depending on the scenario.

Capacity Gain with Wide Pulse
This section shows results from the same scenarios as shown in Section 6.4.2.4 but from a
capacity point of view. In this case, the network is close to the saturation point in all three
scenarios: reference pulse (N, narrow), wide pulse candidate W1 and wide pulse candidate
W2.
Figure 6.37 shows again the impact of the wide pulse on the voice quality. Comparing
with results with Figure 6.34 it can be concluded that the impact is about the same – rather
negligible.
Achieved connection throughput in those scenarios is shown in Figure 6.38 and the corre-
sponding gains in Figure 6.39.

Conclusions with Wide Pulse
Wide pulse candidate W1 gives median throughput gains from 16–27% and candidate pulse
W2 from 13–23%, depending on the scenario. Median throughput fell by about 11% due to the
increased traffi load (and hence interference in the network). Nevertheless, the wide shaping
candidates still outperformed the reference narrow pulse.
In addition, there were also capacity gains, in terms of increased offered load: W1 pro-
vides minimum 18% gain and W2 minimum 16% gain, which were measured from scenario
WIDER-2.

resource management supports novel downlink dual-carrier (DLDC) capable mobile stations
(MS) by the dynamic configuratio
of GPRS/EGPRS packet data channels (PDCHs) on
multiple non-BCCH carriers. Multislot capable Mobile Stations with 4–5 time slots (TS)
provide 225–275 kbps with EDGE. Along with 3GPP Release 7, the EGPRS2 feature provides
enhanced PDCH data rates up to 118.4 kbps per TS and 1.89 Mbps in multislot connections
using the maximum 16 time slots.
System-level simulation results for the end-to-end performance of EGPRS/EGPRS2 over
TCP/IP, assuming conventional four time slots up to a future potential 12 time slots, for capable
mobiles show up to 680/1360 kbps peak data rates.
In this section, FTP application throughput has been investigated with respect to both
download fil size and important TCP settings such as, for example receiver window size. The

DC performance of legacy EGPRS has been compared with that of EGPRS2 both under ideal
radio conditions and in regular hexagonal cellular deployments depending on system load.
The simultaneous allocation of 4 DL TS on single TRX and up to 12 downlink TS on
two TRX has been assumed. Preserving the present EGPRS coding schemes the focus is on
the end-to-end performance under ideal radio conditions (single cell, not limited coverage
scenario) as well as in a real network interference-limited environment. In addition, the new
EGPRS2 concept has been investigated under the same conditions to evaluate the resulting
performance gain in terms of user throughput and network capacity.
As a consequence, on the network side, both an intelligent radio resource management
(RRM) as well as an efficien radio link quality control (LQC) strategy has to be implemented
for dynamically handling MS DC allocations on BCCH and non-BCCH transceivers (TRX)
with multiple reuse planning (MRP) characterized by variable radio conditions [8].
The effects of TCP/IP as today’s dominant transport layer protocol over the internet on
the application throughput in wireless networks have been thoroughly investigated [8–10].
Valuable recommendations concerning the setting of the TCP receiver window size on the
client side have been given. Furthermore, the dependency of the application throughput on the
FTP download fil size has been derived. FTP application throughput results under varying
system load are presented for slow-moving MS in cellular hexagonal deployments with relaxed
4/12 frequency reuse.

for RLC has been completely implemented. For EGPRS, the round-trip time (RTT) on RLC
level (i.e. signaling delay from the MS to the packet control unit (PCU) and vice versa)
was adjusted to 100 ms, the Relative Reserved Block Period (RRBP) to 40 ms [13]. For
EGPRS2, both RTT and RRBP have been reduced, to 80 ms and 20 ms, respectively.

Network simulation model according to the GERAN evolution architecture featuring the
dual-carrier approach and including all end-to-end network entities and relevant protocol stacks such as
RLC/MAC, LLC, TCP/IP.
5. The network layer comprises the transmission of IP packets as well as routing functionality.
6. The transport layer offers both User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as well as TCP (Reno).
Specifi features of TCP have a severe impact on the overall performance of wireless
data services. Thus, the model covers, for example, the choice of the maximum TCP
segment size (MSS), advertising window size of the receiver/client (AWND), congestion
window management at the sender/server and TCP slow start. The TCP round-trip time
is continuously measured and filtere to update the retransmission timeout (RTO). RTO
expiry causes TCP retransmissions and a new slow start. In addition, the effects of duplicate
acknowledgments (DUPACKs) combined with fast recovery and fast retransmit are part of
the model. Hence the complete TCP Reno implementation of the transport layer has been
incorporated in the simulator.
7. The application layer consists of a variety of traffi models for WAP, HTTP, email, FTP,
SMS, MMS and streaming services. Because of the open architecture of the simulator, new
traffi models or traces of real sessions can easily be imported [15, 16]. User’s behavior
is modeled by probability distributions of the number and size of downloads per Internet
session and reading times between separate downloads. Nevertheless the network simula-
tion results presented in this study are exclusively performed for the FTP download service
with deterministic fil volume of 500 kByte.
Figure 6.40 shows the network elements and interfaces included in the simulation model as
well as the path through the network for an IP packet (from the server to the client) on a
download request. When a mobile leaves the idle state, a packet data protocol (PDP) context is
generated at the SGSN. The mobile makes an access to the GPRS/EDGE network and submits
a download request via the mobile network and the internet to a server. The server divides the
requested data volume into TCP segments, adds a TCP/IP header and sends them as IP packets
via a router to the SGSN. Furthermore, the server initializes the TCP fl w control parameters,
for example to perform the slow start.
The SGSN creates LLC frames out of the IP packets and transmits them over the Gb interface
to the PCU, if a permission has been obtained from the leaky bucket fl w control, otherwise the

EGPRS2 and Downlink Dual Carrier Performance
191
LLC frames are queued. Packet queuing on the Gb interface due to congestion is considered.
Meanwhile the PCU allocates radio resources (PDCHs) and the necessary bandwidth on the
dynamic Abis interface. The LLC frames wait in a queue in the PCU to be segmented into RLC
blocks. The RLC blocks are scheduled and transmitted over the air interface to the mobile.
The PCU polls the mobile for a bitmap to indicate the correctly and erroneously received RLC
blocks. The latter are retransmitted.
During the TBF lifetime the PCU performs a periodic TS upgrade/downgrade and LA. As
soon as the MS has correctly received all the RLC blocks belonging to the same LLC frame,
it reassembles the LLC frame and sends it to the connected laptop/PC client. In the client, the
corresponding IP packet and hence the TCP segment are reassembled.
On the receipt of a TCP segment with the expected sequence number, the client sends
an acknowledgement to the server. Delayed acknowledgement is considered. For segments
out of sequence, the TCP layer of the client transmits DUPACKs. Depending on the state of
the TCP parameters, the server invokes on receipt of the TCP acknowledgements and their
sequence numbers the appropriate TCP algorithm, for example fl w control and congestion
window management, RTO handler and retransmission management, as well as fast recov-
ery/retransmissions. As soon as the client has received all the TCP segments of the application
data volume, the network resources of the packet call are released. The client/user might send
additional download requests after a certain idle period. Otherwise the GPRS/EDGE session
is finishe and the PDP context is deleted in the SGSN.
6.5.2
Simulation Results for Ideal Radio Conditions
The GSM/EDGE standard specifie nine modulation and coding schemes MCS-1–MCS-9
utilizing both GMSK and 8-PSK and providing RLC data rates of up to 59.2 kbps per PDCH.
The GERAN evolution concept EGPRS2-B supporting higher order modulation and coding
schemes with higher symbol rate and turbo coding allows for 118.4 kbps per PDCH, that is
twice higher than that provided by legacy EDGE. A BLER-based LA algorithm selects the most
appropriate MCS/DBS according to the radio conditions optimizing the overall throughput
[17, 18]. Hence under ideal radio conditions (zero BLER) the highest MCS-9/DBS-12 with
EGPRS/EGPRS2-B will be selected all the time. Furthermore the support of the extended UL
TBF feature has been assumed.
Figure 6.41 shows the simulated FTP 2 MByte end-to-end mean application throughput for
a single TS MS (one PDCH allocated) up to 12 TS MS depending on the TCP receiver window
size ranging from 16 kByte (Windows XP default) up to 48 kByte. Application throughput
means that upper layer effects such as TCP slow start as well as overhead including TCP/IP
and LLC headers have been considered, the latter reducing the peak data rates by up to 5%.
The Windows XP default TCP window size of 16 kByte is absolutely sufficien for 1 up to
4 TS allocations. Target throughput of 56 kbps for single TS, 112 kbps for 2 TS, 169 kbps for
3 TS and 225 kbps for 4 TS MS has been achieved.
Obviously a 16 kByte receiver window size is completely insufficien for the DC approach
and has to be properly adjusted. A throughput degradation of roughly 10% from approximately
340 kbps down to 300 kbps is clearly visible for 6 TS MS. A TCP receiver window size of
24 kByte is required for 6 and 8 TS MS to obtain peak throughput of 340 and 450 kbps,
respectively. A 10 TS MS needs a TCP window size of 32 kByte to achieve data rates of

The results shown in Figure 6.42 for EGPRS2-B reveal that the TCP receiver window size
has to be adjusted to 64 kByte to support data rates of up to 1.25 Mbps achievable with 12 TS

receiver window size required with EGPRS2-B is significantl less than that required with
EGPRS due to the latency reduction features to be introduced with EGPRS2-B significantl
improving the TCP/IP round-trip time (ping reduction from currently 160 ms down to less
than 100 ms expected).
The impact of FTP download fil size on the achievable peak application throughput for
different MS TS capabilities ranging from 4 TS up to 12 TS is illustrated in Figure 6.43
for EGPRS and in Figure 6.44 for EGPRS2-B respectively. The fil size varies from rather
small 10 kByte to a quite large one of 10 MByte. For a small fil size, no major difference
in throughput has been observed with different MS multi-slot capabilities. Due to the adverse
TCP slow start effect, the user data rate is heavily degraded down to approximately 100 kbps
for both EGPRS and EGPRS2-B. With increasing fil size the application throughput grows
very rapidly up to a certain saturation level depending on the MS multi-slot capability, for
example 225 kbps for a 4 TS MS in EGPRS and 450 kbps in EGPRS2-B. Apparently the
higher the MS multi-slot class, the larger the fil size required for throughput saturation, for
example a fil size of 1 MByte is sufficien to obtain the target throughput of 225/450 kbps for
4 TS MS, however, 5 MByte are required for 8 TS MS to achieve 450/900 kbps and 10 MByte
for 12 TS MS at 680/1360 kbps with EGPRS/EGPRS2-B, respectively.

(i.e. a 3-sector site with four TRX per sector) and 700 m cell radius. In each cell (sector) 8
reserved PDCHs have been configure on two non-BCCH TRXs planned in a relaxed 4/12
frequency reuse. LA has been enabled in both scenarios EGPRS and EGPRS2-B, while IR has
been enabled only in EGPRS.
Figure 6.45 depicts the mean application throughput along with the 10th and 90th user
percentiles for varying system load measured in terms of mean user busy hour (BH) data rate.
In the investigated scenarios an offered load of for example 500 bps translates to 18.6 kbps
per TS.
It should be pointed out that the EGPRS dual-carrier mean user throughput of 350 kbps to
360 kbps achieved with 8 TS MS under very low load conditions (up to 100 bps offered load)
is as high as in 3G-UMTS Rel.99 networks. Some 10% of the EGPRS users enjoy the top
data rates of roughly 400 kbps and 90% of the subscribers achieve data rates higher than 250
kbps. As the offered load increases, the perceived user throughput gradually decreases due to
increased interference level in the network and resource sharing between users. An excellent
mean user throughput of 200 to 250 kbps has been obtained at medium load (400 to 600 bps),
and even in a fully loaded system (800 bps) mean user data rates well above 100 kbps are
feasible. Further increase of the data load pushes the EGPRS network into congestion. The
worst 10% of the users get practically nothing from the service (less than 32 kbps).
EGPRS2-B outperforms EDGE in terms of both user throughput and capacity over the entire
system load range (Figure 6.46). The gain in user throughput achieved by the introduction of
the higher order modulation and coding schemes with turbo coding DBS-5 through DBS-12,
increased 1.2 symbol rate as well as the latency reduction features in GERAN evolution

PDCH utilization vs. system load on 2 non-BCCH carriers in 4/12 frequency reuse

EGPRS2 has been evaluated as a function of the offered system load. Obviously the gain
in peak data rates of roughly factor 2 is independent of the load. The gain in both mean
user throughput and that of the best 10% users varies in the range of 60–90% for an of-
fered load up to 700 bps. At system load beyond 800 bps the EGPRS scenario runs into
congestion causing the exponential gain growth. For an offered load higher than 650 bps
(24 kbps/TS), EGPRS2-B provides more than double throughput for the worst 10% users.
Furthermore, the improvement in throughput performance reduces the effective load in the
network since the sojourn time of each EGPRS2-B user gets shorter. This improves the capacity
of the system. Figure 6.47 clearly indicates the reduced PDCH-utilization with EGPRS2-B
as the offered load increases. At medium to high offered load (300 to 700 bps), the PDCH-
utilization measured in the EGPRS scenario has been reduced by nearly 30% in the EGPRS2-B
scenario. The spared resources along with the enhanced link-level performance and latency
reduction features in EGPRS2-B translate to a roughly 100% capacity gain as indicated in
Figure 6.46. While the EGPRS scenario runs into an overload situation at 900 to 1000 bps
offered load, the PDCH-utilization of 70–80% observed in the EGPRS2-B scenario still allows
excellent mean user throughput of about 200 kbps.
The cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the application throughput at low (100 bps),
medium (500 bps) and high system load (800 bps) are presented in Figure 6.48.
The distributions clearly demonstrate the optimum exploitation of the good radio conditions
(good CIR) on the non-BCCH carriers in 4/12 reuse. Especially at low load EGPRS2-B users
can overwhelmingly profi from the excellent CIR which is typically higher than 25 dB in
90% of the cell area. While the application throughput for about 70% of the EGPRS users is
limited to the peak value of 380 kbps, 50% of the EGPRS2-B users enjoy 240 kbps higher
throughput (higher than 620 kbps). The best 10% EGPRS2-B users perceive almost double

perception with EGPRS2-B at high system load is at least as good as with EGPRS at medium
load revealing the significantl improved spectral efficien y of EGPRS2-B. In addition, the
best 10% EGPRS2-B users achieve data rates higher than 500 kbps.

Summary
The novel DC approach as well as the currently standardized EGPRS2-B GERAN evolution
feature package have been investigated by means of system level simulations under both ideal
and realistic radio conditions. Preserving the modulation and coding schemes currently used
with EGPRS, a DC implementation on two non-BCCH carriers planned in 4/12 frequency
reuse demonstrates a substantial performance gain over today’s single carrier approach. A
3G-UMTS Rel-99 like mean user throughput can be obtained in EGPRS DC networks.
Mean user throughput of 360 kbps has been measured for FTP 500 kByte download with
8 TS capable MS at low system load. TCP receiver window size and download fil size
have a much stronger impact on the end-to-end performance of EGPRS2-B compared to that
of EGPRS. As an example, a TCP receiver window size of 24 kByte is required for 8 TS
MS to achieve the peak data rate of approximately 450 kbps in EGPRS while the receiver
window size has to be adjusted to 40 kByte for an EGPRS2-B MS with 8 TS to support a
peak data rate of 900 kbps. Following this recommendation and assuming a sufficientl large
download fil size target throughput of up to 680/1360 kbps could be achieved under ideal
radio conditions (single cell with not coverage-limited scenario) with the DC approach using
EGPRS/EGPRS2-B capable MS with 12 TS.

198
GSM/EDGE
In a cellular interference-limited deployment (4/12 frequency reuse) at medium system load,
EGPRS2-B outperforms EGPRS providing more than 60% gain in mean user throughput and
an increase in network capacity of about factor 2.
GERAN evolution including DC and EGPRS2-B is a promising method of enhancing
GERAN packet data service to UMTS/HSDPA so that in the near future subscribers can enjoy
seamlessly high data rates in multi RAT mobile networks.
6.6
DTM performance
Dual Transfer Mode (DTM) is a GSM feature in 3GPP standard Release 99. It allows simul-
taneous transfer of voice and data in different channels. This feature is optional and requires
DTM support in both terminal and network.
When DTM is enabled in the network and the DTM terminal is setting up a DTM call, the
connection state is set to dual transfer mode. This means that connection has reserved CS and
PS channels. The transmission states are described in Figure 6.49.
In Release 99, the dual transfer mode can be entered only from the dedicated mode. This
means a DTM MS cannot establish a CS call in the middle of a PS session, but has to
firs release the assigned PS resources before entering dedicated mode. When the MS has
entered dedicated mode, the MS or the network are able to start the DTM call establishment
procedure. The procedure assigns PS resources during an existing CS connection and the MS
finall enters into dual transfer mode [19]. In Release 5, DTM enhancements were brought in,
allowing direct transitions between packet transfer mode and dual transfer mode as illustrated
in Figure 6.49.
DTM introduces a new challenge for the network. There are limitations, for example in
channel allocation due to terminal capabilities. This section discusses important network

features that improve the overall performance of the network where DTM is implemented.
Various features have been developed to make DTM deployment successful. In the early
research phase, new features are developed into the dynamic system level simulator SMART
and major Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are evaluated to understand the benefit of the
feature. The discussion section finall gives conclusions on how essential it is to deploy RRM
algorithm improvements along with the DTM.
The DTM call establishment process takes some time. The reason is that the CS connection
needs to be moved to the PS territory. This requires the territory downgrade procedure that
lasts 400 ms and intra-cell handover which takes additional 320 ms. From the user’s point of
view, the total delay for initiating data transfer in dedicated mode is around 900 ms. Once the
DTM call has been established, PS data transfer runs as a normal (E)GPRS session. The major
difference is that for each different multi-slot class (MSC), 1+1 time slots are reserved for CS
call.
6.6.1
Fragmentation Issue
This section presents the PS territory fragmentation issue due to the DTM call allocation. PS
and CS resources are divided into PS and CS territories. The territory mechanism uses a set
of BSS parameters to move the border dynamically based on the CS traffi load. Figure 6.50
gives an example of the dynamic resizing of the PS territory.
When a DTM call is established in the PS territory, it causes fragmentation of PS resources
if the PS configure time slots in the territory are no longer subsequent to each other due to
the DTM/CS resource reservation. The fragmentation makes multi-slot PS allocation for other
users more difficult because the time slots in the multi-slot allocation have to be subsequent
to each other.

Figure 6.51
DTM channel allocation procedure.
An example of the allocation procedure is demonstrated in Figure 6.51. In the firs step,
four consecutive time slots were assigned in the regular PS connection (user 1). Then a DTM
call (user 2) is allocated to the PS territory. This causes reallocation of the firs regular PS
connection. Once the DTM call is allocated, there is one shared time slot. Another allocation
of DTM call (user 3) causes fragmentation. PS traffi is allocated to the neighboring time slots.
A third DTM connection would get at most two consecutive time slots and would cause many
reallocations.
One solution to the fragmentation issue is the non-contiguous channel allocation, which
is explained in the following section. With Higher multi-slot classes (HMC), the number of
fragmentation cases increases significantl .
6.6.1.1
Non-Contiguous Channel Allocation
One possible solution to solve the fragmentation problem is to allow non-contiguous allocation
(NCA) of PS calls. This option makes PS territory less affected by fragmentation. Without
DTM allocation the PS resources are always assigned as contiguous.
Simulation Results
All the simulations in this section are based on a dynamic network level simulator SMART.
SMART simulations are executed in the regular homogeneous network with 25 3-sectorized
sites. Two TRXs are assumed for each sector (1 BCCH + 1 RF hopping).
The define traffi model uses 30% AMR speech calls and 70% EGPRS FTP data calls
with a fil size of 120 kB. The DTM penetration rate is set to 30% and the DTM user’s Class
is assumed to be Class 11 [19].

EGPRS2 and Downlink Dual Carrier Performance
201
Territory configuratio
is set as follows: default PS territory size is 5 and maximum PS
territory size is 14. The maximum number of DL TS is set to 2 for DTM and 5 for non DTM
users (higher multi-slot class – HMC).
Figure 6.52 (a) shows the mean number of time slots per user due to the impact of territory
fragmentation. A network without DTM service is used as a reference case. On average, there
are 1.5 time slots less for 30% of DTM penetration compared to a network without DTM. By
allowing non-contiguous PS allocation we observe around 1 time slot more per connection.
The distribution of used time slots is actually more critical than the average values as shown
in Table 6.12.
Figure 6.52 (b) shows the average throughput per user for DTM users. When non-continuous
allocation is enabled, the frequency of higher throughputs is increased. The fragmentation im-
pact in the throughput, delay and other KPIs can be decreased with non-continuous allocation.
Non-contiguous channel allocation can be considered a must for higher DTM penetrations.
6.6.2
DTM Multiplexing
In the firs network simulations of DTM, only FR was supported in DTM/CS. The aim of this
section is to show the impact of supporting also half-rate speech (HR) in DTM/CS. Lower and
upper bounds for network capacity with DTM support obtained by simulations are presented
in the following section.
Using HR with DTM/CS provides higher fl xibility on sharing remaining PS resources.
Figure 6.53 shows examples of multiplexing of resources.
6.6.2.1
Simulation Results
The simulations in this section are based on a regular grid with 75 sectors and with 2 TRXs
(1 BCCH + 1 RF hopping) per sector. The traffi model assumes 30% speech AMR and 70%
EGPRS FTP with 120 kB fil size. A penetration rate of 30% DTM Class 11 users is assumed.
The dedicated/default/maximum PS territory sizes are set to 2/4/6 respectively. The maximum
number of DL TSL is 2 for DTM users and 4 for non-DTM users.
Figure 6.54 shows the TBF blocking gain due to DTM/CS multiplexing when forcing the
CS part of the DTM call to half-rate mode. The reference case is based on a network with
DTM disabled. Analyzing the TBF blocking impact on DTM users, the forced use of HR in
DTM mode provides a gain of about 20% compared to HR not supported in DTM, considering
a 1% TBF blocking threshold.
6.6.3
Intra-Cell Handover Failures
Transition from dedicated mode to dual transfer mode is necessary before DTM call estab-
lishment. Transition implies an intra-cell handover. The intra-cell handover is triggered by
the DTM assignment and expiry of packet fl w timer (after PS release). A CS call needs to
be moved from CS territory into PS territory to start a DTM call. A PS call needs to release
PS resources firs before starting the DTM call. Either a CS or PS call starts the DTM call,
it implies resource reallocation. The DTM assignment increases the intra-cell handover and
these extra handovers can cause the drop of the call due to handover signaling failure.

play an important role, but they are not analyzed here.
6.6.3.2
Solutions to Intra-Cell Handover Failures Caused by DTM
In this section features for improving the intra-cell handover performance are studied and
discussed: the introduction of a RXQUAL threshold and FACCH repetitions. Two features are
studied in this section: RXQUAL threshold and FACCH repetition.
RXQUAL Threshold for Intra-Cell Handover Caused by DTM
The basic principle of this feature is to use an RXQUAL threshold for intra-cell handovers
caused by DTM, similar to the switch from AMR-HR operation to AMR-FR mode triggered
by radio conditions. In DTM assignment, there are good reasons for blocking TBF if the
connection has a substantially high RXQUAL representing poor radio conditions (Figure
6.56). And after PS release, it is recommended to reset the packet fl w timer (PFT) until
RXQUAL is good enough. Figure 6.57 shows the range layers where the intra-cell handover
due to DTM assignment will not be allowed and where a DTM connection with RXQUAL
higher than 5 will have the TBF blocked.
FACCH Repetition for DCR HO Caused by DTM
FACCH signaling is bidirectional (uplink and downlink) and is used when a handover is
required. FACCH failures imply an increase of Dropped Call Rate (DCR) during handover
process. It may also be employed in call establishments. The solution is to use the FACCH
repetition/boosting to increase the FACCH performance and reduce the handover failures.
Figure 6.58 shows that FACCH FER performance without repetition creates a bottleneck in
handover since performance of signaling channels is worse than that of the lower rate AMR
codecs.

EGPRS2 and Downlink Dual Carrier Performance

DTM increases the blocking (voice and data) and the DTM/CS HR mode has to be used.
It increases the fl xibility of dedicated PS territory and hence smooths the impact of DTM
deployment.
DTM also increases the number of intra-cell handovers and these additional handovers
will cause a higher rate of dropped calls due to handover signaling failure. Essential features
to solve this issue are the enabling of RXQUAL threshold and the application of FACCH
repetition. Both features clearly improve the overall performance by reducing the handover
failures.
Non-contiguous allocation, half-rate for DTM/CS and FACCH enhancements are essential
for DTM to be successfully deployed. It is clearly seen that any features that improve speech
service performance will also improve overall DTM performance. For example, dynamic
allocation of frequency resources, for example DFCA, deployment improves the capacity
of DTM/CS and leaves more fl xibility to DTM/PS to improve performance by higher data
throughput.
DTM gets even more interesting when LTE is deployed. Future mobile stations will support
GSM and LTE technologies. Future dual transfer mode may consist of GSM speech service
and LTE data service. Smooth interaction between GSM and LTE is essential to optimize
overall network performance. Spectrum migration plays an important role and multi-radio
DTM would provide more fl xibility to an operator.

GSM Data Evolution Performance Summary
GSM/EDGE data evolution consists of complementary techniques that taken together could
achieve quadrupling data rates compared to average data rates available in existing EDGE net-
works. These data evolution features can be employed to allow a fl xible bandwidth extension
with EGPRS2 and Downlink Dual Carrier, which both provide doubling of the throughput
compared to traditional EDGE services. EGPRS2 supports higher order modulation schemes,
such as 32-QAM and together with the higher symbol rate, spectrally wide optimized transmit
pulse shaping filte and turbo codes boost peak data rates to 118.4 kbps per time slot. Downlink
Dual Carrier, on the other hand, doubles the bandwidth and hence the number of assigned time
slots can be increased to 16 thus enabling the theoretical peak data rates of up to 1.89 Mbps
with EGPRS2-B.
Table 6.13 summarizes the data evolution performance characteristics per allocated time slot
using the new EGPRS2 modulations. Table 6.13 also lists Mobile Station Receive Diversity
(MSRD) as one potential technology to increase the data throughput, although MSRD is not
evaluated here.
The 3GPP Release 7 improvements increase peak bit rates, and more importantly, the
average bit rates when the data service coverage area and spectrum efficien y are improved.
Data rates offered by EGPRS2 and DLDC complement HSPA speeds allowing multi-mode
users to experience a new level of service continuity, where the boundaries between 2G and
3G do not limit the usage of latest packet data application. It is worth noting that almost all
HSPA and LTE users are also GSM/EDGE users.
One of the key design criteria in 3GPP Release 7 is that the deployment of evolution features
has minimal or even no hardware impact on legacy network equipment. Therefore it is possible
to introduce the specifie data enhancements only with software upgrades, without any new

Introduction
7.1.1
Overview
Since the beginning of GSM, a significan amount of effort has been spent by the ETSI and
3GPP standardization bodies to improve the quality, robustness and capacity of the speech
channel leading to a number of advancements in speech codec technology. In this respect,
a milestone was reached with the Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) codec. AMR introduces a
plurality of codec modes from which the network adapts the robustness and the speech quality
of the codec to suit the condition of the radio channel.
This makes AMR the codec of choice in bandwidth efficien networks where the need
for increased robustness against interference is matched by the need to maintain a reason-
able speech quality performance. While AMR represents a significan step forward towards
increased network efficien y, the performance of the control channels associated with the
speech traffi channel represent a major bottleneck since they were designed with less robust
traffi channels in mind such as the Full-Rate, Enhanced Full-Rate and Half-Rate channels.
To realize the full potential of AMR, a need was identifie within the 3GPP standardization
body to improve the robustness of the associated control channels so that their performance
relative to the robust modes of AMR could be ensured.
In this chapter on control channel performance, we describe the improvements to the asso-
ciated control channels that were standardized as part of 3GPP Release 6. It is complementary
to Chapter 12 on Capacity Enhancements for GSM, where a number of non-standardized
enhancements to the associated control channels are described and which can be considered as
complementary to the standardized methods. First, in Section 7.1.2, we give an introduction
to the AMR codec where we highlight the benefit of this codec over previous codecs both
in terms of speech quality performance and robustness to interference. Then in Section 7.1.3,
we give an introduction to the associated control channels: the FACCH and SACCH, where
we describe their role in maintaining the link between the network and the mobile. Next,

in Section 7.2 we give an introduction to the Repeated SACCH, the standardized method to
improve the robustness of the SACCH. A case study relating to radio link failure is also given
to demonstrate the benefit of the technique. Finally, in Section 7.3, we give an introduction
to the Repeated Downlink FACCH, the standardized method to improve the robustness of the
FACCH. The benefi of the technique is demonstrated in a case study relating to handover.
7.1.2
Introduction to Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) Coding
Speech service in GSM began with the Full-Rate (FR) codec based on Regular Pulse Excitation-
Long Term Prediction (RPE-LTP) coding and operating at an average bit rate of 13 kbps. Later,
the Enhanced Full-Rate (EFR) codec based on Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction
(ACELP) coding was introduced to improve speech quality while operating at a slightly lower
bit rate (12.2 kbps). To increase the network capacity of voice traffic ETSI also standardized
the Half-Rate (HR) codec which is based on Vector Sum Excited Linear Prediction (VSELP)
coding and operates at 5.6 kbps.
The bits from these speech codecs are transmitted over GSM logical channels TCH/FS,
TCH/EFS and TCH/HS respectively after having undergone channel coding for protection
against impairments in the wireless channel. Channel coding adds redundancy bits and matches
the source bit rate to the bit rate of the GSM channel (which is 22.8 kbps for the TCH/FS
and TCH/EFS and 11.4 kbps for TCH/HS). More details about the channel coding for these
logical channels can be found in 3GPP TS 45.003 [1].
While these speech codecs operate only at constant bit rates, the Adaptive Multi-Rate
(AMR) codec supports a range of bit rates that can be adapted depending on the condition of the
channel. AMR utilizes the ACELP algorithm employed in GSM EFR and supports eight codec
modes with bit rates 12.2, 10.2, 7.95, 7.4, 6.7, 5.9, 5.15 and 4.75 kbps. All eight modes are sup-
ported by the TCH/AFS full-rate traffi channel while the last six are supported by the TCH/
AHS half-rate traffi channel. AMR delivers optimum speech quality and increased system
capacity through fast in-band signaling and link adaptation. It adapts to the radio and traffi con-
ditions by selecting the optimum traffi channel mode (full-rate or half-rate) and codec mode.
Channel coding for the AMR codec modes is based on recursive systematic convolutional
coding with puncturing to obtain the required GSM channel bit rates (22.8 kbps for full-rate
and 11.4 kbps for half-rate).
In the basic AMR operation (depicted in Figure 7.1), both the mobile station (MS) and
the base transceiver station (BTS) perform channel quality estimation on the received signal.
On the basis of these channel quality measurements, a codec mode command (CMC) on the
downlink or codec mode request (CMR) in the uplink is sent over the radio interface in in-band
messages and the receiving end uses this information to choose the best codec mode for the
prevailing channel conditions. A codec mode indication (CMI) is also sent to indicate the
current mode of operation at the sending side. The basic principle for codec mode selection is
that the mode chosen in the uplink may differ from the one used on the downlink direction,
but the channel mode (full-rate or half-rate) must be the same.
The benefi of the in-band method is that it does not require a separate signaling channel
for message transfer. By sending the messages and the indicators together with the speech, the
link adaptation can be made faster, leading to improvements in system performance.
The network controls the uplink and downlink codec modes and channel modes, while the
MS must obey the codec mode commands coming from the network. To determine which

The performance of the channel encoder (CHE) for the TCH/AFS channel is depicted in
Figure 7.2 as a function of carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I), where performance is given in
terms of frame erasure rate (FER) and where a frame erasure is counted by an error in the
class 1a bits (the most sensitive bits of the speech frame). In many cases, the speech quality
begins to degrade when the FER exceeds 1%. Hence when we compare the most robust mode
of AMR with the TCH/FS channel reference (also depicted in Figure 7.2), we see a benefi of
about 5 dB (corresponding to the relative level of interference that can be tolerated).
The other side of the AMR coin are the bit rates supported by the Speech Encoder (SPE), as
these together with the compression algorithm determine the quality of the speech. In AMR,
the supported bit rates range from 12.2–4.75 kbps, which compare to fi ed bit rates of 13 kbps
for FR, 12.2 kbps for EFR and 5.6 kbps for HR. Their performance in terms of speech quality
can be compared after performing listening tests and rating the listening quality according to
the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) in Table 7.1 [3]. For example, Figure 7.3 depicts the delta
MOS for each of the AMR codec modes as a function of FER.
The performance of the CHE and SPE combined is depicted in Figure 7.4.1 To maximize
speech quality performance and channel robustness, the AMR link adaptation algorithm needs

Introduction to the Associated Control Channels
From the beginning of a call when a traffi channel (TCH) is allocated, until the end of
the call when the TCH is released, the network and mobile need to send and receive radio
resource messages that are vital in maintaining the link between the two entities. To transmit
these messages, a signaling link is provided over two control channels that are associated
with the speech traffi channel (TCH): the Fast Associated Control Channel (FACCH) and
the Slow Associated Control Channel (SACCH). These associated control channels are time-
multiplexed on the same physical channel as the TCH as depicted in Figure 7.5 (for the full-rate
TCH channel).

In the figure six TCH speech frames have been mapped onto 24 bursts in every 26 TDMA
frames. Onto these same bursts, the FACCH frames are mapped such that when a FACCH
frame needs to be sent, a TCH speech frame is ‘stolen’. SACCH frames are sent in regular
intervals are mapped onto 4 dedicated bursts in every 104 TDMA frames.
When a mobile moves out of coverage of the serving cell and into coverage of a neighboring
cell, the network needs to move the call from the physical channel in the serving cell to a
physical channel in the neighbor cell. This Radio Resource Management (RRM) procedure is
called handover and is a fundamental aspect of GSM.
For the duration of the call, information about the radio frequencies allocated to the neigh-
boring cells is sent at 480 ms intervals on the downlink SACCH and in return, the mobile
measures their reception quality and sends the results back to the network at 480 ms intervals
on the uplink SACCH. Once a neighbor cell is found to have a better reception quality to the
serving cell, a handover is triggered when the network transmits a HANDOVER COMMAND
message on the downlink FACCH. This message commands the mobile to switch to a physical
channel in the neighbor cell.
It is clear that for handover to succeed, a reliable signaling link is needed both over the
SACCH (so the mobile can inform the network about a loss in reception quality) and over the
FACCH (so the network can order the mobile switch to a physical channel in a neighbor cell).
Another Radio Resource Management procedure that is a necessary part of GSM is connec-
tion release, when a radio resource allocated to a call needs to be terminated. This is normally
performed when either party ends the call, but is also needed when the radio link fails and it
has not been possible to re-establish the connection. The criteria for radio link failure is based
on the success rate of the messages sent over the SACCH. Any deficiencie in the SACCH
performance may translate into a prematures release of a call (i.e. increased proportion of
dropped calls due to radio link failure).
When we consider the FACCH and SACCH without enhancements, their performance is as
depicted in Figure 7.6.

Repeated SACCH
7.2.1
Introduction
The method adopted in 3GPP to improve the robustness of the SACCH is called Repeated
SACCH and is based on the principle that when repeated transmissions are combined in the
receiver, a decoding gain is achieved thanks to the time diversity between the transmissions. In
the case of Repeated SACCH, duplicate SACCH frames are sent by making use of information
redundancy that is already inherent in the SACCH transmissions. These are then exploited at
the receiving end to produce a second attempt at decoding the frame. The Repeated SACCH
was firs proposed in 2005 [4] and was standardized to become part of Release 6 of the 3GPP
specification in 2005.
7.2.2
The Repeated SACCH Procedure
The Repeated SACCH procedure, which is described in 3GPP TS 44.006 [5], is depicted in
Figure 7.7. For SACCH reception on the downlink, the mobile attempts to decode a SACCH
frame, firs without attempting to combine it with the previously received SACCH frame. If
the decoding fails, the mobile notifie the network (by setting the SACCH Repetition Request
indicator bit on the uplink SACCH to “SACCH Repetition Required”) and makes a second
attempt, this time after combining it with the previously received SACCH frame. The process
is then repeated for the next downlink SACCH frame. For SACCH transmission in the uplink,
the mobile firs checks if Repeated SACCH is enabled in the uplink (by checking if the SACCH
Repetition Order indicator bit in the last successfully decoded downlink SACCH frame was
set to “SACCH Repetition Order”) and that the previously transmitted SACCH frame is not
already a duplicate. The mobile then transmits a duplicate frame instead of the originally
scheduled frame. The process is then repeated for the next uplink SACCH frame.

7.2.3
The Repeated SACCH Concept
To understand the Repeated SACCH concept, it helps to recognize that one of the functions of
the SACCH is to enable serving cell measurements during the time that speech frames are not
being transmitted (i.e. when the user is muted during discontinuous transmission operation).
For this reason, measurement result messages have to be transmitted continuously on the
uplink SACCH and system information messages have to be transmitted continuously on the
downlink SACCH (unless something else needs to be sent, such as an SMS message).With
this principle in mind, it can be understood that the SACCH serves not only to provide an
acceptable refresh rate of the information carried by the SACCH but also to allow the mobile
and the network to continuously perform its link quality measurements.
Figure 7.8 depicts the information update rate on the SACCH and Repeated SACCH as
a function of interference (C/I). While a reduction is seen as a result of the duplication
of information (by up to 50%), this is only when conditions are good. In practice, SACCH
Repetition will only be used when conditions deteriorate (e.g. when the network C/I is low) and
in this case the capacity of the SACCH can be seen to improve thanks to the added robustness.
Repeated SACCH makes use of a certain level of information redundancy that already
exists on the SACCH, which the receiving end can then capitalize upon by attempting to
combine every received SACCH frame with its predecessor. This is particularly the case on
the downlink, where system information messages sent in the main body of the SACCH frame
seldom change because they pertain to information relating to the serving and neighbor cells
(which is normally updated only after handover). In the L1 header of the downlink SACCH,
the Ordered Timing Advance has a slow rate of change even at high speeds,2 while the Ordered
2 A change in the Ordered Timing Advance will occur after the mobile has traveled a distance which is equivalent
to one symbol period, that is 0.55 km (at the speed of light). This is equivalent to 39.6 s (or 82.4 SACCH periods) for
a mobile traveling at 50 km/h.

Control Channel Performance
219
MS Power Level changes at a rate typically determined by uplink quality measurements which
are often averaged over a number of SACCH periods to improve their accuracy. Clearly, the
criterion that enables Repeated SACCH in uplink and downlink will be critical if the gains
are to be to maximized and any unnecessary repetitions minimized. While this criterion has
been left for each network vendor to specify, the SACCH Repetition Request indicator bit may
be employed, which has been introduced in the uplink SACCH to indicate the occurrence of
SACCH frame failures on the downlink.
7.2.4
Case Study: Radio Link Failure
In this section, we evaluate the impact of Repeated SACCH on the probability of radio link
failure (RLF). As mentioned earlier, an orderly release of the network’s resources needs to
be performed when the radio link fails and it is not possible to re-establish the connection.
The criteria that triggers a radio link failure is based on SACCH frame decoding failures and
a parameter broadcast on the BCCH called RADIO LINK TIMEOUT. Specificall , a radio
link failure occurs when the radio link counter expires, where this counter is initialized by
and never exceeds the value of RADIO LINK TIMEOUT and is decremented by one with
every unsuccessfully decoded SACCH frame and incremented by two with every successfully
decoded SACCH frame [7].
In 3GPP TS 45.008 [7], it states that a radio link failure should not occur until the call has
degraded to beyond the point at which the user would have manually released the call. “This
ensures that, for example, a call on the edge of a radio coverage area, although of bad quality,
can usually be completed if the subscriber wishes.” Hence the criteria that triggers a radio link
failure should be robust enough in “bad” quality speech.
To calculate the probability of a radio link failure, the radio link counter can be modelled
as a state machine following a Markov process with a limiting border at one side (the value of
RADIO LINK TIMEOUT) and an absorbing border on other side (when the counter is zero
corresponding to a radio link failure).
The RADIO LINK TIMEOUT value determines the number of states, and the decoding
state of each SACCH frame determines the transitions between the states. The probability of a
state is accumulated with each SACCH transmission and hence the probability of a radio link
failure can be determined by calculating the probability at the absorbing state after a specifie
number of SACCH transmissions.
If we assume the average call duration is 3 minutes and the probability of a SACCH frame
failure is given by the FER shown in Figure 7.9 (for the SACCH and Repeated SACCH) and
when considering RADIO LINK TIMEOUT values of 16, 32 and 64, then the probability
of a RLT occurring can be calculated, as shown by the curves in Figure 7.9. Given that the
probabilistic model above assumes uncorrelated SACCH frame failures, these curves should
be taken as an upper bound (because the SACCH frame failures will in practice be correlated
due to the multipath and shadow fading effects of the channel).
In Table 7.1, the listening quality for speech has been classifie into a Mean Opinion Score
(MOS) where a score of “1” is given for bad quality and a score of “2” for poor quality. In
this case study, we have assumed the boundary between these levels (i.e. “1.5”) as the point
at which a user would choose not to maintain the call under any conditions. If a premature

call drop is therefore to be avoided, then the probability of a radio link failure occurring when
speech quality is above this “1.5” level should be zero.
Finally, the MOS verses C/I curves that are needed to compare with the curves depicting the
probability of a radio link failure can be obtained from the FER verses C/I curves in Figure 7.2
(which assume the same channel conditions as the FER verses C/I curves for the SACCH and
Repeated SACCH in Figure 7.9) and by mapping the FER to MOS by using the MOS verses
FER curves in Figure 7.3.
In Figure 7.9, at the point at which the MOS for the most robust AMR codec mode
(TCH/AFS4.75) is “1.5”, the probability of a radio link failure for RADIO LINK TIMEOUT
values of 16, 32 and 64 respectively are 19%, 1.3% and 0.0% for the SACCH and 0.0% in all
cases with Repeated SACCH. Clearly the performance of the SACCH is too weak for RADIO
LINK TIMEOUT values of 16 and 32 if a zero probability of radio link failure is targeted. In
this case study, increasing the RADIO LINK TIMEOUT value to 64 could be used to prevent
unnecessary radio link failures, but RADIO LINK TIMEOUT values has high as this are not
normally used as they can lead to a late release of a call (where a prolonged radio link failure
will affect a user’s satisfaction and may result in higher interference levels).

Repeated Downlink FACCH
7.3.1
Introduction
The method that was adopted to improve the robustness of the FACCH is called Repeated
Downlink FACCH and, like the Repeated SACCH, makes use of time diversity between
repeated transmissions to increase the likelihood of a successful decode. In the case of Repeated
Downlink FACCH, the duplicate FACCH frame is sent by making use of the speech codec’s

Control Channel Performance
221
tolerance to having the speech frames “stolen” for the purpose of FACCH transmissions and
which can be exploited by the receiving end to provide a second attempt at a successful
decoding. Repeated FACCH was firs proposed in 2001 [8] and Repeated Downlink FACCH
was standardized to become part of Release 6 of the 3GPP specification in 2005.
7.3.2
The Repeated Downlink FACCH Procedure
The Repeated Downlink FACCH procedure is described in 3GPP TS 44.006 [5] and is depicted
in Figure 7.10. The network may transmit a duplicate FACCH frame 8 TDMA frames after
sending a FACCH frame (or 9 TDMA frames, if a SACCH or idle frame occurs in-between).
This maximizes the time diversity on the full-rate channel and minimizes any FACCH sig-
naling latency on the half-rate channel. If the mobile receives both frames but is unable to
decode either of them independently, then a further attempt is made this time after combining
them.
The data link layer sends information on the FACCH within LAPDm command and response
frames (the latter frame type being specifi to acknowledged information transfer) and both
frame types are applicable with Repeated Downlink FACCH. Repeated Downlink FACCH is
also applicable to legacy mobiles as well as those indicating support for Repeated ACCH.
With a legacy mobile, the use of Repeated Downlink FACCH is restricted to command
frames only and in this case a diversity gain is achieved when the legacy mobile attempts
to decode both FACCH frames independently. If a mobile explicitly indicates support for
Repeated ACCH (a capability indicator in the MS Classmark 3 information element [10]),
then the use of Repeated Downlink FACCH can extend to response frames as well. This is
because the capability indicator implicity ensures that the mobile has allocated enough time to

the support of combining. Figure 7.11 shows the layer 1 performance of the downlink FACCH
and Repeated Downlink FACCH. For legacy mobiles, the gain is about 3 dB and for mobiles
indicating support for Repeated Downlink FACCH, the gain is about 6 dB (when measured at
5% FER).
7.3.3
Case Study: Handover
7.3.3.1
Introduction
To illustrate the effectiveness of Repeated Downlink FACCH, it is useful to consider its impact
on the success probability of the radio resource messages involved rather than on the success
probability of the individual layer 1 FACCH frames. For example, in the introduction to this
chapter, handover was highlighted as being fundamental to maintaining the link between the
network and a mobile. In this case study, we investigate the impact of Repeated Downlink
FACCH on the success probability of the radio resource messages that are used as part of the
handover procedure.
We then analyze their combined probabilities to investigate the benefit of Repeated Down-
link FACCH to the handover completion time.
7.3.3.2
Handover Procedure
The relevant messages sent over the air interface during handover are the HANDOVER COM-
MAND message, the HANDOVER ACCESS message, the PHYSICAL INFORMATION

message, the SABM command frame and the HANDOVER COMPLETE message [6]. Their
transmission sequence is depicted in the signaling diagram in Figure 7.12.
Handover is initiated by the transmission of a HANDOVER COMMAND message on the
downlink FACCH. This message instructs the mobile to change channel to a neighboring cell.
When the mobile receives a HANDOVER COMMAND message and changes channel, it starts
timer T3124 and begins repeating the HANDOVER ACCESS message in access bursts on the
uplink FACCH. HANDOVER ACCESS messages allow the network to calculate the timing
advance information needed to synchronize the mobile to the network. Once the network
has calculated this information, it sends a Timing Advance command back to the mobile in
the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message on the downlink FACCH and starts timer T3105.
On expiry of T3015, the network retransmits the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message and
resets the timer. This is then repeated for a maximum of Ny1 times or until a layer 2 or TCH
frame is received. When the mobile receives the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message, it
stops transmitting HANDOVER ACCESS messages and stops timer T3124. Finally, when the

224
GSM/EDGE
mobile has successfully established a data link layer connection (after respectively sending
a SABM command and receiving a UA response), it sends a HANDOVER COMPLETE
message on the uplink FACCH and on receipt of this message, the network releases the old
channel.
7.3.3.3
Physical Layer and Data Link Layer Reliability
The reliability of the handover procedure described above depends on the correct reception
of each of the aforementioned messages and the responsibility of this task is given to the
physical layer (layer 1) and the data link layer (layer 2). On the physical layer, error correction
is provided by the FACCH with a concatenated convolutional and FIRE code [1] while on the
data link layer, an ARQ protocol is provided by the LAPDm acknowledged mode of operation
[9].
The ability of the physical layer to correctly decode a FACCH frame is characterized by the
FER performance of the FACCH as depicted in Figure 7.11.
On the data link layer, the LAPDm acknowledged mode of operation provides a rudimentary
ARQ protocol based on the transmission of command frames and response frames. When L3
information needs to be sent, a L3 message is transmitted within Information (I) command
frames and acknowledgements to I frames are transmitted within Receive Ready (RR) response
frames. If a L2 link firs needs to be established, a Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM)
command frame is sent and an acknowledgement to a SABM command frame is sent in an
Unnumbered Acknowledgement (UA) response frame. The reliability of the data link layer
is dependent on the maximum number of retransmissions allowed and this depends on the
logical channel on which the command frames are sent (SACCH, SDCCH, FACCH etc.) and
on the LAPDm procedure being employed (information transfer or layer 2 link establishment
and release) [5]. For example, the maximum number of retransmissions on the FACCH when
performing information transfer (using an I frame) or L2 link establishment (using a SABM
command frame) is given in Table 7.2.
7.3.3.4
Maximum Transmission Times on the Data Link Layer
The maximum time permitted before a response frame shall be transmitted (after receiving a
command frame) or before a command frame shall be retransmitted (after failing to receive
a response frame) is also dependent on the logical channel used. For example, the maximum
transmission times for the FACCH/Full-rate and FACCH/Half-rate channels are given in
Table 7.3. When assuming these maximum times, then the “round-trip” time for a single

acknowledged LAPDm transmission can be calculated. For example, on the FACCH/Full-
rate channel it is 25 TDMA frames or 115 ms. If Repeated Downlink FACCH is used, this is
increased by 9 TDMA frames to 157 ms. Further, when we assume the maximum time allowed
before a retransmission has to be sent, then the accumulated transmission time is extended by
39 TDMA frames or 180 ms per retransmission.
7.3.3.5
Success Probability Fundamentals
When a LAPDm frame is transmitted within a FACCH frame, the probability of the frame
being received in error as a function of C/I can be determined by the FER performance of the
FACCH. For example, the FER performance of the FACCH/Full-rate in uplink (using normal
and access bursts) and in downlink (with Repeated Downlink FACCH enabled and disabled
both for legacy mobiles and mobiles indicating support for the Repeated Downlink FACCH)
is depicted in Figure 7.11.
Note that the FER performance shown reflect the receiver’s performance against a single
interferer, while in practice a channel will consist of many interferers.
Let p denote the probability of a frame received in error (e.g. as determined by the FER for
a given C/I). Then the probability of a successful transmission is 1 −p and the probability of
a successful transmission in one or more of N attempts is
1 −pN
(7.1)
This equation can be used to determine the success probability of a L3 message transmitted
over the data link layer when in unacknowledged mode, where N is the number of transmissions
and when assuming uncorrelated transmissions.
The probability of a successful transmission both on the downlink and in the uplink (for
example, when a transmission in one direction needs to be acknowledged with a transmission
in the other direction), is (1 −pd)(1 −pu) and the probability of a successful transmission
both on the downlink and in the uplink in one or more of N attempts is
1 −(1 −(1 −pd)(1 −pu))N
(7.2)

226
GSM/EDGE
This equation can be used to determine the success probability of a L3 message transmitted
over the data link layer in acknowledged mode, where N is the number of transmissions and
where pd and pu denote the probability of a frame received in error on the downlink and
uplink respectively.
When the size of a L3 message exceeds the payload size of a L2 frame, the L3 message
firs needs to be segmented into K L2 frames. In which case, the success probability of K L2
frames after N transmissions (where N ≥K) is

7.3.3.6
HANDOVER COMMAND Message
One of the purposes of the HANDOVER COMMAND message is to convey the physical
channel in the neighbor cell that the mobile must switch to. This includes the mobile’s
allocation of carrier frequencies in the case of frequency hopping. Depending on the number
of hopping frequencies, the HANDOVER COMMAND message may need segmenting over
two L2 frames. Transmission of the HANDOVER COMMAND message is in acknowledged
mode, hence to calculate the probability of a successful transmission we use Equation (7.3),
where K = 2, pd and pu is the FER of the FACCH on the downlink and uplink respectively
(given in Figure 7.12 for normal bursts) and N is 1. . .35 (where the maximum number of
retransmissions i.e. the maximum number of transmissions minus one is given in Table 7.2 for
information transfer on the FACCH/Full-rate). The maximum transmission delay will be 115
+ n × 180 ms for an acknowledged LAPDm command frame on the FACCH/Full-rate and
this increases to 157 + n × 180 ms with Repeated Downlink FACCH, where n is the number
of retransmissions. When taking into account the above assumptions, it is possible to calculate
the success probability and transmission delay of the HANDOVER COMMAND message
on the FACCH/Full-rate. This is shown in Figure 7.13 for FACCH and Repeated Downlink
FACCH.
7.3.3.7
HANDOVER ACCESS Message
On receipt of a HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile starts repeatedly transmitting
the HANDOVER ACCESS message in access bursts in successive TDMA frames on the uplink
FACCH(resulting in a transmission delay of 5ms per HANDOVER ACCESS message). On the
network side, their time of arrival provides the information needed to synchronize the mobile
to the neighbor cell. Between non-synchronized cells, the HANDOVER ACCESS message is
sent in consecutive TDMA frames until the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message is received
or the timer T3124 expires. On a traffi channel, T3124 is fi ed at 320 ms, hence to calculate the
probability of a successful HANDOVER ACCESS message we use Equation (7.1), where N
is 69 and p is the FER of access bursts sent on the uplink FACCH (given in Figure 7.12). When
taking into account the above assumptions, it is possible to calculate the success probability
and transmission delay of the HANDOVER ACCESS message on the FACCH. This is shown
in Figure 7.14.

PHYSICAL INFORMATION Message
The timing advance information sent to the mobile to allow it to synchronize to a neighbor cell
is transmitted by the network in successive PHYSICAL INFORMATION messages. These
messages are sent in intervals determined by the timer T3105 until either a SABM command
frame or a speech frame is received, or until a maximum of Ny1 retransmissions have been
sent. Ny1 is a network dependent parameter that ranges from 3 to 64, hence we use Equation

In this case study we assume the values 3 and 80ms for Ny1 and T3105 respectively. When
taking into account the above assumptions, it is possible to calculate the success probability
and transmission delay of the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message on the FACCH/Full-rate.
This is shown in Figure 7.15 for FACCH and Repeated Downlink FACCH.
7.3.3.9
Link Establishment on Data Link Layer
Once the mobile is synchronized to the neighboring cell, it firs establishes a data link layer
connection before it can send and receive layer 3 signaling messages. This is initiated by the
mobile by transmitting a SABM command in acknowledged mode. Hence to calculate the
probability of a successful transmission we use Equation (7.2), where pd and pu are the FER
of the FACCH on the downlink and uplink respectively (given in Figure 7.11 for normal bursts)
and N is 1. . .6 (where the maximum number of retransmissions i.e. the maximum number of
transmissions minus one is given in Table 7.2 for L2 link establishment information transfer
on the FACCH/Full-rate). The maximum transmission delay is 115 + n × 180 ms for an
acknowledged LAPDm command frame on the FACCH/Full-rate and this increases to 157 +
n×180 ms with Repeated Downlink FACCH, where n is the number of retransmissions. When
taking into account the above assumptions, it is possible to calculate the success probability
and transmission delay of the SABM command on a FACCH/Full-rate. This is shown in Figure
7.16 for FACCH and Repeated Downlink FACCH.

Handover Completion
The probability of a successful handover is the combined probability of all the aforementioned
messages. If we assume a message success probability of no less than 99% (which is equivalent
to a 95% handover success probability or higher), we can calculate from the required number
of transmissions the time needed to perform the handover. This is shown in Figure 7.18 both
with and without Repeated Downlink FACCH.

In relatively good channel conditions, the completion time with Repeated Downlink FACCH
is shown to take longer. This is because of the worst-case assumptions on the delay calculation,
where an additional 9 TDMA delay had been assumed for Repeated Downlink FACCH to
account for the duplicate FACCH frame. In practice, this additional delay will not be seen in
good channel conditions, because the firs instance of the Repeated FACCH pair is quite likely
to be succeed. Furthermore, it is expected that a network will enable Repeated Downlink
FACCH only when the channel conditions deteriorate. In Figure 7.18, as the interference
level increases, the handover completion time reduces exponentially thanks to the Repeated
Downlink FACCH. Note that the discontinuities seen in the plot are the result of the integer
number in retransmissions. If we assume a user will manually end the call after having endured
a 5 second handover interruption time, then at this limit the user should be able to tolerate
about 2 dB higher interference thanks to the Repeated Downlink FACCH. This additional
robustness will particularly benefi interference limited networks, where handover failure is
often the dominant cause for a dropped call.
The average number of transmissions needed to receive a message consisting of K frames
could alternatively be calculated by using Equation (7.4)
K(1 −pd)(1 −pu)
(7.4)
where pd and pu denote the probability of the frame being received in error in downlink
and uplink respectively. From the average number of transmissions it is possible to determine
the average time needed for each message in handover and the combined delay for all the
messages.

This is shown in Figure 7.19 as a function of C/I both with and without Repeated Downlink
FACCH. Like the calculation based on the individual success probabilities, a 2 dB gain is
clearly visible with Repeated Downlink FACCH.
The difference in the gain at this level with the gain at the physical layer level (where
Repeated Downlink FACCH shows about 4 dB gain measured at the 66% FER level in
Figure 7.12), can be attributed to the impact on the handover procedure from the uplink
FACCH transmissions. For example, if we consider error-free conditions in uplink, the gain is
increased to 4 dB with Repeated Downlink FACCH. Handover performance clearly relies and
a balanced link between the uplink and downlink.

Introduction
The number of GSM subscriptions worldwide reached 4 billion by the end of 2009 [1].
Voice is still one of the most important mobile services and its traffi continues to grow. In
order to accommodate this growth, new voice enhancement concepts have continuously been
developed for GSM. Both standardized and vendor-specifi features have been developed to
increase GSM networks’ voice capacity. The Spectral Efficien y (SE) has improved many times
since the introduction of GSM Phase 1 voice at the beginning of the 1990s. Performance has
also improved, for example with more robust speech coding, advanced receivers and concepts
allowing more users per channel. Moreover, Radio Resource Management (RRM) methods
have been developed in order to optimize the available resources in changing traffi conditions
and to fulfil the quality requirements of network operators. High capacity, spectral efficien y,
cell coverage, low call drop rate, low blocking probability and high handover success rate are
the basic requirements for a network to provide end users with a high quality voice service.
In the past few years energy efficien y has also become an increasingly important aspect for
network operators.
In this chapter, a performance evaluation of GSM voice evolution is presented. The main
focus is on the latest voice performance features, namely Orthogonal Sub-Channel (OSC),
Voice over Adaptive Multi-user channels on One Slot (VAMOS), Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR),
Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC) and Downlink Advanced Receiver Perfor-
mance (DARP). First, an overview of GSM voice evolution is given in Section 8.2. Then, the
performance of AMR with SAIC/DARP is presented in Section 8.3. A detailed investigation

Section 8.5.

Overview of GSM Voice Evolution
8.2.1
Voice Capacity
The GSM voice spectral efficien y (SE) is used to quantify the number of voice users a
network (or site or cell) is able to carry in a given spectrum. Spectrum is a limited resource
for all radio technologies and its use requires a license and significan investment. The lower
frequency bands are especially attractive since they provide better coverage than those at higher
frequencies. However, one challenge with the GSM 900 MHz band is that the allocations are
typically quite small (between 5 MHz to 10 MHz) and scattered. “Re-farming” the 900 MHz
spectrum from GSM to HSPA has started in a few countries, but HSPA requires a minimum
of 4.2 MHz unscattered spectrum [2], which means that a HSPA 900 MHz deployment may
require more than 50% of the original spectrum available for GSM. Given that today most
of the voice traffi is still carried over GSM networks, GSM voice capacity has become an
important issue for network operators. Re-farming of a spectrum must avoid any degradation
of service.
Tighter frequency reuse factors can be used to improve a network’s SE by allowing more
TRXs per cell for the same available spectrum. GSM networks utilizing AMR and enhanced
RRM algorithms can be operated with very tight frequency reuses. For example, AMR perfor-
mance with tight frequency reuse factors has been studied in [3], where it is shown that AMR
can improve the network SE up to 150%.
Figure 8.1 describes how spectral efficien y of GSM voice has developed from GSM Full-
rate speech to the VAMOS concept introduced in 3GPP Release 9. Figure 8.1 includes potential
features for a further voice evolution as well as how the voice performance KPIs have been
evolving.
8.2.1.1
Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR)
Next to the introduction of GSM Phase 1 voice service, AMR has been one of the most
significan voice enhancement features deployed. It provides better voice quality by introducing
a new speech codec which adapts the speech and channel coding to the changes in radio signal
quality. This increased robustness to channel errors can be utilized for both system capacity
and quality improvements. The improved voice quality has also enabled the use of half-rate
speech via AMR. Then, a major step towards a high speech quality was achieved with the
introduction of the AMR-WB speech codec. AMR-WB is evaluated in Chapter 9.
8.2.1.2
Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance (DARP)
DARP represents a significan step in downlink performance evolution. With DARP techniques
the mobiles can tolerate more interference and thereby operate in more challenging interference
conditions. This allows network operators to deploy tighter frequency reuse factors, which
leads to higher spectral efficien y. Together with the robust AMR speech codecs, DARP is

able to provide good speech quality with very low C/I values. Detailed performance results
are shown in Section 8.3.
8.2.1.3
Dynamic Frequency and Channel Allocation (DFCA), Progressive
Power Control (PPC)
DFCA and PPC use AMR fl xibility to further improve network quality and capacity. These are
examples of vendor-specifi RRM algorithms that the network operators can use to optimize
their networks. DFCA is described in Chapter 10 and PPC and other non-standardized capacity
enhancement techniques are described in Chapter 12.
8.2.1.4
Orthogonal Sub-Channels (OSC), VAMOS
The OSC and VAMOS concepts have recently been introduced. At the beginning of 2009,
Nokia Siemens Networks successfully demonstrated the OSC concept in a network trial where
four calls were carried in one GSM radio time slot [4]. The OSC concept does not require
standardization but DARP Phase 1 capable mobile stations are needed [5] for successful
operation. VAMOS is a GERAN Release 9 feature which benefit from a new set of Training
Sequences (TSC) and two new mobile classes. VAMOS is presented in detail in Chapter
4. Both OSC and VAMOS double the number of voice channels per TRX which allows an
increase in the network HW efficien y. Performance results are shown in Section 8.4.

GSM/EDGE
8.2.1.5
Mobile Station Receiver Diversity (MSRD)
MSRD is a potential enhancement to push GSM voice capacity to the next level. MSRD
is specifie in 3GPP Release 7 and mobiles able to fulfil the MSRD performance require-
ments are denoted as DARP Phase 2 mobiles. MSRD is described further in Chapter 2.
Currently this technique is not deployed in small mobile handsets. However, new systems
like HSPA and LTE are pushing terminals towards receiver diversity. Dual antenna receiver
diversity is commonly used in base stations, which has resulted in the downlink being the
limiting link for voice capacity. The introduction of mobile station diversity in downlink
would challenge the uplink performance which could be further enhanced with 4-way antenna
diversity.
8.2.2
Voice Performance KPIs and Hardware Efficienc
The Drop Call Rate (DCR) and the Handover (HO) success rate have always been important
KPIs since they directly affect the end user’s experience. A lost connection has a negative
impact on the end user’s perceived quality of service and hence a well-performing network
should have a DCR which is lower than a pre-define limit (such as 2%). The Blocked Call
Rate (BCR) is another important criterion which should also be lower than a predefine limit
(again, such as 2%) during the busy hour traffic
Following the introduction of AMR, more interest has been directed to voice quality. Low
Frame Erasure Rate (FER) indicates good voice quality, but FER alone cannot account for
the difference in quality between the different speech codecs. Therefore, in case of AMR an
indicator reflectin a subjective speech quality is needed such as define by the Mean Opinion
Score (MOS). While this is not available from the measurement reports, tools exist in the
market to measure and quantify the subjective speech quality of the available link data.
The main benefi from OSC and VAMOS is an improvement in hardware (HW) efficienc .
Figure 8.2 shows the evolution of the number of voice channels supported per GSM TRX.
The GSM carrier is divided into 8 time slots allowing a maximum of 8 full-rate channels to be
allocated to one TRX. A half-rate channel only uses every second time slot thereby doubling
the capacity to 16. In OSC and VAMOS two users are allocated to the same channel. Therefore,
these techniques can provide up to 32 half-rate connections per TRX.
In case of the half-rate codec modes, higher C/I values are required to achieve a performance
which is comparable to the full-rate codec modes. Therefore, connections in poor radio
conditions must use full rate. Similarly, OSC has higher C/I requirements compared to the
normal half-rate channel. In networks where a high SE is required and interference conditions
are challenging, only a proportion of the users can be allocated to normal half-rate and OSC
half-rate channels. In this task, advanced RRM algorithms play an important role to allocate
users to the most fittin channel and mode.
HW efficien y is also closely related to energy efficien y. Energy consumption is becoming
increasingly important in GSM/EDGE networks. Also, cost efficien y is important especially
in low ARPU regions. These are addressed in more detail in Chapter 13.
In multimode networks (i.e. networks that support two or more radio access technologies
such as GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN) frequency and potentially also power resources may
be shared between systems. With higher GSM SE more resources can be allocated to the new
systems, and/or for the GSM/EDGE data traffic

Overall, as the GSM voice is still one if not the most important mobile service, and as it
continues to grow, high GSM SE is of key importance to network operators.
8.3
AMR and SAIC Performance
In November 2002, TSG GERAN initiated a feasibility study with the scope of studying
the performance of Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC) in the mobile station.
The basic idea behind interference cancellation in the downlink is to enhance the receiver
performance by means of advanced signal processing techniques which increase the robustness
towards interference in the network. Single antenna reception was considered in order to
minimize the cost of the mobile station implementation. As mentioned earlier, the enhanced
performance of the mobile station receiver in interference limited scenarios might be utilized to
enable tighter frequency re-uses in the network provided that the penetration of DAR-capable
mobile station is sufficientl high.
The feasibility study of SAIC was completed in 2004 [6], following which performance
requirements were specifie in 3GPP under the Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance
(DARP) Phase 1 feature. Mobile station receiver diversity (MSRD) was later introduced as
DARP Phase 2. It is further described in Chapter 2.
DARP Phase 1 only targets GMSK-modulated signals, as the SAIC signal processing tech-
niques showed the most promising gains for this modulation type [6]. A natural consequence
of this is that DARP Phase 1 primarily targets improvements in voice capacity.
DARP Phase 1 has been the de facto standard for most mobile station vendors, and therefore
the market penetration of such mobiles is high. Sections 8.3.1 to 8.3.3 describe the principles
of AMR for GMSK-modulated speech traffi and quantify the link level gains that can be
achieved for these channels with the use of DARP Phase 1.

GSM/EDGE
8.3.1
Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR)
AMR is a codec introduced in GSM with the aim of increasing the speech and channel coding
performance compared to the legacy Full-rate (FR) and Enhanced Full-Rate (EFR) codecs. The
AMR coding system provides the means for selecting the optimum trade-off between speech
and channel coding depending on the radio conditions. This means that besides enhancing
the speech quality, an enhancement in system capacity can also be achieved. AMR was firs
specifie in Release 98, with the introduction of AMR narrowband (AMR-NB) for GMSK
modulation. Further enhancements were specifie in 3GPP Release 5 with the introduction of
AMR-NB for 8PSK traffi channels as well as AMR-WB for both GMSK and 8PSK traffi
channels. A more detailed description of the various AMR types is provided in Chapter 4 and
in [3].
DARP Phase 1 targets voice capacity improvements for GMSK-modulated traffi channels,
and thus the feature fit well with AMR-NB for GMSK enabling even further gains.
AMR-NB for GMSK consists of a full-rate traffi channel (TCH), denoted TCH/AFS and
a half-rate channel denoted TCH/AHS. AFS consists of eight codec modes and AHS of six
codec modes, as listed in Table 8.1.
The specification allow a maximum of four modes to be applied within an Active Codec
Set. The selection between these four modes is handled through link adaptation in the mobile
station and in the network [7]. An AMR-capable mobile station continuously monitors its
perceived link quality and suggests which codec mode should be applied in the downlink,
based on a set of thresholds signaled from the network. The signaling of the requested codec
mode as well as the applied codec mode is performed through in-band signaling using bits of
the traffi channel. The applied codec mode can be changed every second speech frame which
corresponds to every 40 ms (full-rate).
The link adaptation of AMR described above selects the best suited speech codec mode
taking the performance of the mobile station into account as well as the overall carrier to

interference levels in the network (cell). This can be exploited to increase system capacity
while still maintaining a good speech quality, as is explained below.
As mentioned, DARP is a general receiver enhancement which improves the link perfor-
mance of a GMSK-modulated channel. Thus, DARP introduces gains for all AMR modes
allowing further capacity improvements. As will be shown in Section 8.3.3, the gains from
DARP are constant between the different AMR codec modes.
8.3.2
Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance (DARP)
DARP Phase 1 is specifie in 3GPP Release 6 and the specification primarily consist of a
new set of performance requirements for the mobile station [8], a new set of test scenarios
and DARP capability signaling. The capability signaling was introduced in such a way that
DARP may be implemented as a release independent feature, thereby allowing DARP to be
introduced in pre-3GPP Release 6 mobile station implementations.
As mentioned earlier, DARP enables the mobile station to cope with higher interference in
the network which can be exploited to increase network capacity provided that the market pen-
etration of DARP mobile stations is sufficientl high. For an end-user, the feature may result in
an increase in voice quality since the mobile station would allow a higher speech code rate than
a legacy mobile station. That is, a DARP mobile station may be able to use TCH/AFS12.2 at
certain signal conditions where a legacy mobile station would apply TCH/AFS7.95. Examples
of the link level gains of DARP with AMR are provided in Section 8.3.3.
In order to specify a new set of performance requirements for the DARP mobile station,
a new set of test scenarios were define by 3GPP TSG GERAN: the DARP Test Scenarios
(DTS) [8]. Their scope is to provide a test environment that approximates to the interference
environment of a real network while allowing the test and measure of a mobile station in a
laboratory environment. During the feasibility study phase of SAIC, a number of link and
system level network configuration were developed with the aim of evaluating the gains of
SAIC by means of simulations [6]. The configuration were based on data derived from live
network implementations for a number of different network deployments. The DARP test
scenarios are inspired by these configurations but have been simplifie in order to be better
suited for implementation in test equipment.
The DARP test scenarios seek to model the following conditions:
r single and multiple interferers;
r training sequence correlation between wanted signal and interferer;
r synchronous and asynchronous network configurations
Tables 8.2 to 8.5 list the fi e different DARP test scenarios as define in 3GPP TS 45.005
[8]. Each test scenario is characterized by a number of parameters. The “interfering signal”
column define the type of interference, such as co-channel, adjacent channel or white noise
(AWGN). The “interferer relative power level” define the power level of each signal relative to
the dominant co-channel interferer (for a single interferer scenarios namely DTS-1 and DTS-4,
this parameter is not applicable). For DTS-2 it can be observed that for example Co-channel 2
has 10 dB lower signal level than that of the dominant interferer. The “TSC” column describes
whether the interferer includes a training sequence code or consists of random bits. It is well

known that the choice of training sequence affects the link level performance, because the
different training sequences have different cross-correlation properties. If the network is not
synchronized, random bits can provide a more accurate model of the average performance in
a real network where the mobile station is prone to a mix of interferers at different delays.
DTS-3 consists of the same interferer signal levels as DTS-2, but correlates the TSC to emulate
the impact of a synchronous interferer. For asynchronous interferers, the dominant interferer
is offset by 50% of a normal burst as shown in the column “Interferer delay”.
The DARP test scenarios are to be seen as additional tests applicable for the DARP mobile
station. That is, all legacy test cases still apply.
All DARP test cases are to be conducted using a typical urban channel profil with a mobile
station speed of 50 km/h. Examples of the link performance of DTS-1 and DTS-2 are presented
in the following section.
8.3.3
AMR DARP Link Performance
The link level performance of a DARP Phase 1 capable mobile station using AMR-NB is
exemplifie in Figures 8.3 to 8.6 and compared to that of a legacy mobile station implemen-
tation. Single and multiple interferer scenarios are considered (DTS-1 and DTS-2) as well as
TCH/AFS and TCH/AHS.
It can be observed from Figures 8.3 and 8.4 that in case of single interference (DTS-1)
the DARP Phase 1 mobile station has a significan performance gain compared to the legacy
mobile station. The gain is in the range of 12–13 dB when looking at the 1% frame erasure
rate.

Phase 1 mobile station performs better than the legacy mobile station. The gains are more
modest than those achieved in the single interferer scenarios, but are in the order of 3 dB which
is quite remarkable considering the level and variations in the interference type.
Today, both AMR and DARP Phase 1 are standard features of most mobile station vendors.
Although the results presented in this section have focused on AMR-NB, the gains are equally
applicable to AMR-WB. DARP is a general receiver improvement for GMSK modulated
channels and thus the feature will also provide significan gains for AMR-WB.
8.4
OSC and VAMOS Performance
The following sections describe OSC and VAMOS fundamentals and performance. First, the
general principles are described. Then, link and system level performance results are presented.
Finally, OSC performance gains are demonstrated by means of drive test measurement results.
8.4.1
The Principles of the DL Concept
In this section, the basic principles for OSC and VAMOS downlink are described. First, we
consider a frequency fla channel, that is a channel without inter-symbol interference (ISI).

246
GSM/EDGE
The GMSK modulation can be seen as a binary modulation xi = {−1, 1}, and for this case
the maximum likelihood (ML) decision for the i th symbol can be formed as
argmaxxi (ln(p(yi|xi, h))) = argmaxxi (2 · real(yH
i hxi) −x H
i hHhxi)
(8.1)
where yiis the i th received sample, h is a scalar channel and xiis the modulated symbol.
The decision metric is clearly real. Now, consider another binary modulated symbol with
symbols, zi = {−1, 1}, and defin a new transmitted symbol as ˆxi = xi + zi j carrying two
binary information symbols, where j = √
−1. It follows the ML metric can be formed as
argmax(xi,zi)(ln(p(yi|ˆxi, h))) = argmaxxi (2 · real(yH
i )xi −x H
i h Hhxi)
+ argmaxzi (−2 · imag(yH
i h)zi + z H
i hHhz)
(8.2)
Thus, the terms related to xiand ziare independent of each other and they can also be decoded
independently of each other without any interference.
In practice, the situation is more complicated due to the frequency selectivity of the radio
channels. The multi-path fading channels cause inter-symbol interference and also interference
between the two information streams. This has to be taken into account in the actual receiver
design. There are several ways to reduce the impact of the interference and some of the options
are listed below:
1. Filtering. A digital filte , typically FIR, can be placed in the signal path before the detector.
This filte converts the channel impulse response to minimum phase, that is close to a
frequency fla channel. An example of such a solution is the pre-filte of an MMSE-DFE
receiver. This type of filte may already exist in many of today’s EGPRS receivers.
2. Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC). Typically new GSM mobiles are
equipped with DARP capabilities. As the interfering information stream of an OSC or
VAMOS sub channel looks like a co-channel interferer, it is possible to apply SAIC to re-
duce the impact of the interference. Thus, DARP Phase 1 mobiles do not require additional
design to receive voice transmitted over OSC or VAMOS signals.
3. Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). In a SIC receiver the sub-channels, or users, are
received in an iterative fashion. The dominant sub-channel is received firs and according to
the detected information the impact of the detected stream is removed before the detection
of the other sub-channel and so on.
4. Joint Detection (JD). In joint detection, both information streams are decoded at the same
time. An example is a QPSK type receiver, where both information streams are demodulated
as one signal.
8.4.1.1
Constellation Power Control
Depending on the channel quality, the base station transmitter may wish to adjust the power
between the different sub-channels. The symbol amplitudes can be represented as α = [0, 1]
where ˆxi = αxi +
√
1 −α2zi jis a variable used to scale the power. The total transmitted
power is still constant, but the power distribution between users can be adjusted. Even more
specificall , if α is define
from the set α ∈{sin(π/8), sin(2π/8), sin(3π/8)}, a particular

utilized (see Figure 8.7). This allows the possibility to reuse the existing EGPRS transmitters.
8.4.2
The Principles of UL Concept
In the uplink, mobiles transmit a normal GMSK signal. Since two VAMOS or OSC users
share the same physical radio resources, it is left for the BTS to separate the user sub-channels.
One could say that the system resembles a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system where the separation of the user signals is allowed by independent multi-path channel
characteristics. The base station should be equipped with antenna diversity in order to perform
the signal detection. The signal separation is further facilitated by the fact that different training
sequences are applied in the transmitted sub-channels.
The training sequences should preferably be orthogonal to each other to guarantee the qual-
ity of the channel estimates. In order to improve the correlation properties a new improved set
of training sequences was specifie in [9]. In the following, the correlation properties of the
training sequences when using a 5 tap least squares (LS) channel estimator are studied. The
correlation properties of the original GSM training sequences (TSC) are presented in Table 8.6.

The correlation properties between original and the new set of sequences are given in
Table 8.7. Clearly, the new set has the best correlation properties when paired with the
original TSC with the same sequence number. It should be noted that the original set of train-
ing sequences already can provide suitable pairs for an UL multi-user MIMO setup, but some
pre-selection is needed in order to fin the best pairs.
Similarly to the case of downlink, there are different options to receive the multi-user signals.
Those include Interference Rejection Combining (IRC), Successive Interference Cancellation
(SIC) and Joint Detection (JD).
8.4.3
Downlink VAMOS Link Performance with AMR
As mentioned earlier, VAMOS enables two full-rate or four half-rate users to be allocated to
the same TDMA slot which thereby yields an increase in network capacity. In order to evaluate
the performance of VAMOS level 1 and level 2 mobile station receivers a new set of VAMOS
test scenarios (MTS) were included in the 3GPP VAMOS working assumptions [10]. As with
the DARP test scenarios, the scope of the MTS is to provide a test environment which matches
that of a real interference-limited network, by modeling the conditions where there are single
and multiple interferers, and synchronous and asynchronous network deployments.
The main difference between the VAMOS and DARP test scenarios is the applied interferer
modulation type. Tables 8.8 to 8.11 list the four different VAMOS test scenarios assumed in
[10], and characterized by a number of parameters. The “interfering signal” column define

the type of interference, such as co-channel, adjacent channel or white noise (AWGN). The
“interferer relative power level” define the power level of each signal relative to the dominant
interferer. For a single interferer scenario such as MTS-1 and MTS-3 this level is 0 dB as there
is one interferer, and therefore with equal QPSK sub-channel powers the external interferer
may actually be 3 dB stronger than the desired signal on each of the two VAMOS sub channels.
The modulation for Co-channel 1 will be either: GMSK or VAMOS type. For MTS-2 and
MTS-4 the modulation for Co-channel 1, Co-channel 2, and Adjacent 1 will be either: GMSK
or VAMOS type. All interferers should use the same modulation type. The “TSC” column
describes whether the interferer includes a training sequence code or it consists of random
bits. The “Interferer delay” column denotes the delay in symbols.
The VAMOS working assumption is that the VAMOS test scenarios are to be seen as
additional tests applicable for the VAMOS mobile station. That is, all legacy DARP test cases
still apply.
Examples of the VAMOS link performance using MTS-1 and MTS-2 are presented in the
following section, using a typical urban channel profil with a mobile station speed of 3 km/h.
8.4.3.1
Equal Sub-Channel Power Imbalance Ratios
Sub-Channel Power Imbalance Ratio (SCPIR) define the user-specifi power given by the
modulation constellation and these details are described for VAMOS in Chapter 4. A VAMOS
capable mobile station should be able to operate with equal SCPIR values and over a range of
different SCPIR configurations The VAMOS link level performance with AMR is divided into
two sections. First, the performance is exemplifie for a VAMOS level 1 and a VAMOS level
2 mobile station when operating with 0 dB SCPIR and then the performance is exemplifie
for a VAMOS level 1 and a VAMOS level 2 mobile station in a VAMOS configuratio over a
range of (non-zero) SCPIRs.
The link level performance of both a VAMOS level 1 and a VAMOS level 2 capable
mobile stations for all AMR-NB codec modes are exemplifie in Figures 8.8 to 8.15. Single
and multiple interferer scenarios are considered (MTS-1 and MTS-2) using both GMSK and
QPSK modulated interference as well as TCH/AFS and TCH/AHS channel modes.
It can be observed from Figures 8.8 to 8.11 that in the case of a single interferer (MTS-1)
both the VAMOS level 1 and the VAMOS level 2 mobile station performance depend on
the interferer modulation type. Furthermore it can be seen that the VAMOS level 2 mobile
stations performs better than the VAMOS level 1 mobile station when the interferer is QPSK
modulated. The gain is in the order of 1 dB (measured at the 1% FER point) when SCPIR =
0 dB. Assuming the VAMOS level 1 mobile station is developed from a DARP Phase 1 mobile
station platform but updated to support the new VAMOS TSCs (as described in Chapter 4),
then the presented performance results in Figures 8.8 to 8.11 will also reflec the performance
of DARP Phase 1 mobile station.
The multi-interferer scenarios (MTS-2) of Figures 8.12 to 8.15 also show that both VAMOS
level 1 and VAMOS level 2 mobile station performance depend on the interferer modulation
type. Furthermore, it is noted that when SCPIR = 0 dB, the VAMOS level 2 mobile station
performs better than the VAMOS level 1 mobile station both with GMSK and with QPSK
modulated interference. The performance differences are in the range of 1 dB to 1.8 dB
depending on the modulation type of the interferer.

From Figures 8.16 to 8.19 it can be observed that in the case of MTS-1 with QPSK modulated
interference, the VAMOS level 2 mobile station performs better than the VAMOS level 1
mobile station for all SCPIR values and for both AMR-NB codecs. The actual performance
gain depends both on the SCPIR level and on the AMR-NB codec. From the performance
curves it can also be seen that the gain is more than 2 dB (measured at the 1% FER point)
when SCPIR = −7.7 dB.
The MTS-2 scenarios from Figures 8.20 to 8.23 also show that the VAMOS level 2 mobile
station performs significantl better than the VAMOS level 1 mobile station for all SCPIR
values and for all AMR-NB codecs when the multi-interference scenario is used. Again, the
largest gains were observed for the negative SCPIR levels, where the gain is above 3 dB
(measured at the 1% FER point) when SCPIR = −7.7 dB.
In general, the conclusion can be made that the VAMOS level 1 mobile station is more
sensitive to the applied SCPIR level than the VAMOS level 2 mobile station.

8.4.4.1
Performance Impacts of Sub-Channel Power Imbalance Ratio in Uplink
In Figure 8.25 the uplink receiver performance is evaluated when using average SCPIR values
up to 10 dB with legacy training sequence pairs. In this scenario the UL receiver is able to
decode the weaker channel while achieving the 3GPP performance requirements.
8.4.4.2
Performance Impacts of Interference Type
Noise whitening and interference rejection have been proved to be effective means, when
separating the OSC users. One technique for performing noise whitening is based on the
de-correlation of colored noise for a binary signal by separating the received signal into its real
and imaginary parts (IQ). The IQ-whitening can cancel GMSK modulated interference more
efficientl due to its binary nature. With OSC there can be two categories of interference:
1. User interference where OSC sub-channel 0 (User1) is an interference source for the second
sub-channel and vice versa, where both OSC users are GMSK modulated signals.
2. Residual interference coming from other users sharing the same radio resources (e.g. GMSK
or 8PSK, or a mix of two or more GMSK and/or 8PSK modulated signals).
For OSC, the user interference is usually more dominant than the residual interference. With
an OSC receiver based on IQ-noise whitening, the other user can be more or less removed
completely given that it is equivalent to a GMSK modulated interferer. When both users have
the same power level, an efficien whitening mechanism is required to detect the desired user
from the other sub-channel.
Figure 8.26 shows the IQ-whitening and non IQ-whitening receiver performance when
GMSK and 8PSK residual interferences are simulated with the legacy training sequence
pair {0, 6} for TU3iFH radio propagation scenario. The IQ-whitening receiver performs
significantl better in both GMSK and 8PSK residual interference cases when compared to
the non-IQ-whitening receiver. The gain of the IQ-whitening receiver is much higher for the
GMSK interference whereas the non-IQ whitening receiver performs almost the same for both
GMSK and 8PSK interference.

System Level Performance
This section presents system level performance evaluations for OSC and VAMOS. The results
are based on dynamic network level simulations. First, simulation scenarios and assumptions
are described. Then the results are presented, starting from the basic OSC performance and,
after that, evaluating some enhancements for the VAMOS concept.
8.4.5.1
Simulation Configuration and Assumptions
The evaluated scenarios are based on VAMOS working assumptions described in [10]. Results
are shown for two scenarios. Both network configuration are based on a regular grid with

75 sectors. Table 8.12 and Figure 8.27 summarize the characteristics of each network con-
figuration Scenario 1 is an interference- limited scenario with hopping layer frequency reuse
factor of 1/1. Scenario 2 is a loose frequency reuse scenario and is more limited by hardware
capacity than by interference. BCCH layer reuse factor was 4/12 in both scenarios and BCCH
TRX was included in the simulations.
Mobile stations were assumed to be DARP Phase 1 compliant with the exception that the
simulations of constellation power control were done with 50% DARP Phase 1 and 50%
non-DARP mobile stations.
The simulated channel modes are summarized in Table 8.13. REF represents the reference
case with AMR 5.9 Half-Rate (HR) codec, while OSC is the case with the same codec, which
also includes the Double Half-Rate (DHR) OSC channel mode. The simulations were done
using only half-rate channel modes, because those channel modes better indicate the achievable
gains of OSC on top of current AMR codecs. The channel mode adaptation algorithm to adapt
between HR and DHR modes takes into account RxQual and RxLevel measurements and cell
load conditions.

Two quality indicators were used: the firs was Blocked Call Rate (BCR) with 2% QoS
criterion; the second was the Bad Quality Calls (BQC) with 5% QoS criterion. Connection
quality was measured with Frame Erasure Rate (FER). It was assumed that the quality of a
call was bad if connection average FER was higher than 3%.
A summary of test cases used for the simulations in this section is presented in Table 8.14,
and details for each one are given below:
1. The firs simulation is evaluating the baseline performance. Results are shown for the
reference AMR with DARP Phase 1 and OSC with regular RRM. The advanced RRM are
introduced by the other cases.
2. In the second case, performance improvement with an optimized pulse shape is evaluated.
Linearized Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (LGMSK) is the basic pulse shape for VA-
MOS. The specificatio of an optimized pulse shape for VAMOS is under study as part of
the 3GPP MUROS Feasibility Study [10]. Typically, the choice of pulse shape is expected
to represent a compromise between increased adjacent channel interference and improve-
ment in reception robustness. Results are shown for two types of pulse shapes. Linearized
GMSK pulse shape and a Root-raised-cosine (RRC) pulse shape filte with 3 dB-bandwidth
of 240 kHz and roll-off value of 0.3. These pulse shapes were introduced in Chapter 4. In
these simulations, adjacent channel protection values for the pulse shape filter are 18.2 dB
for LGMSK, 13.8 dB for RRC.
3. In this simulation, the optimized channel allocation for OSC is studied. The baseline
simulations used the allocation algorithm of a normal GSM network using interference
estimation to choose the best target channel. This algorithm sorts the available channels
by their interference levels. An OSC-based algorithm sorts the available channels by the
path loss difference between the incoming user and the other half-rate user which is
already using the channel, thus it minimizes the power requirement differences of each
OSC mobile station in downlink. The hybrid mode uses the priority provided from both
allocation algorithms.

Figure 8.28
Traffi multi-frame structure for normal OSC traffi and User diversity pattern 2 [11].
4. This set of simulations evaluates User diversity for OSC, which is a feature suggested in
3GPP for increasing interference diversity on OSC calls. It changes the frame structure of
OSC calls in order to mix different mobiles on the same OSC channel. There are several
mixing patterns proposed for this feature [11]. In these simulations, the pattern 2 described
in Figure 8.28 was used. In this pattern, the frame structure of users 1 and 3 is kept
unchanged, and therefore those sub-channels are able to hold legacy users which are not
aware of frame structure modification For users 2 and 4 the frame structure is modifie in
a way that those either interfere with user 1 or with user 3. The important point about this
feature is the DTX silence period. When DTX is enabled, the BTS changes the constellation
from QPSK to GMSK if one of the users in the OSC channel is silent. In this case, the active
user gains from the inactivity of its pair and therefore better quality is obtained. When user
diversity is enabled, DTX gains are spread over all users which are paired with the inactive
user. As an example, consider that user 1 in Figure 8.28 is in DTX mode. During normal
OSC transmission, user 2 will have no interferer; therefore, it will behave as a normal
half-rate call. When user diversity is enabled, half of the bursts received by user 2 and user
4 will be using GMSK, therefore both users benefi from DTX state of user 1. Additionally,
user diversity tends to spread DTX gains over the call period since it is not expected that
users 1 and 3 will always be inactive simultaneously.

5. Sub-channel specifi power control is evaluated in this simulation set. In addition to normal
power control and channel allocation methods, DL Sub-Channel Power Imbalance Ratios
(SCPIRs) provides a means for implementing different downlink powers for each sub-
channel, as described in Section 8.4.1.1. One important application of SCPIRs is to improve
the radio conditions for legacy receivers [12]. Receivers which are not DARP Phase 1-
compliant suffer from high quality degradation as they are multiplexed on an OSC channel.
Therefore, by using this technique it is possible to apply an equivalent power unbalancing
in downlink to improve the legacy receiver’s link quality while leading to small increase
in FER of advanced receivers. This approach presents a good compromise in order to
make it feasible to multiplex non-DARP terminals in OSC channels. In these simulations,
rectangular constellation points were used. In addition to the different SCPIR constellations,
it is possible to take advantage of the burst interleaving of GSM traffi in order to achieve
different sub-channel power steps. This is done by transmitting part of the half-bursts
that compose the interleaving period of each block using a rectangular constellation, for
example switching between modulation constellation points of 8PSK and QPSK modulation
on each received time slot [13], for example the modulation method does not change, only
the points selected from the constellation. Table 8.15 illustrates the constellation patterns
used in simulations. Additionally, this set of simulations was created using 50% of DARP
Phase 1 and 50% of non-DARP receivers.
6. This set of simulations evaluates the performance of different FACCH transmission strate-
gies for OSC. One concern with OSC is how to manage signaling as calls are paired in the
same channel. Degradation in the expected bit error rate of the FACCH caused by OSC
multiplexing might be an important factor that could lead to an increase in the dropped
call rate. There are some proposed alternatives for this issue and this text will present the
Double FACCH Stealing and Soft FACCH Stealing techniques. Both of them improve the
transmission of FACCH signaling at the cost of some degradation in voice quality for the
second user on an OSC channel. When using Double FACCH Stealing, the user transmit-
ting FACCH has full priority over the channel, and therefore the channel is not shared at
this time with its OSC pair. As a consequence, the paired user loses the TCH block under
transmission. The Soft FACCH Stealing feature presents a compromise between the full
priority for transmitting FACCH and the voice quality of the second user. This soft-stealing
technique uses an unbalanced OSC constellation to apply equivalent higher power for the
user that is transmitting the FACCH block. Simulations were performed to test the different

Table 8.15.
8.4.5.2
Simulation Results
A summary of the simulation results for cases 1 to 3 are presented in Tables 8.16 and 8.17.
In both scenarios the network was blocking limited. In the tight frequency reuse scenario
(Scenario 1), the OSC baseline showed 14% capacity gain compared to the reference case.
When the optimized pulse shape was used, the gain increased to 26%, and when the optimized
channel allocation was employed, this increased further to 30%.
In the loose frequency reuse scenario (Scenario 2), the OSC gains were significantl higher.
Already the baseline results showed a gain above 50% for OSC. And, with the optimized pulse
shape the gain increased to 70%.
In terms of hardware efficien y, it can be seen that the reference case is limited to about
13 Erls/TRX. In Scenario 1 up to 16.5 Erls/TRX was achieved and in Scenario 2 up to 23
Erls/TRX with OSC when using the optimized pulse shape and channel allocation. Given that
the 2% hard blocking limit for OSC is about 28 Erls/TRX, then it is reasonable to assume
that additional methods and optimization algorithms could be considered to improve OSC
performance in this scenario.
It can be seen from the results that network capacity has increased significantl when using
the RRC pulse shape. Although the RRC pulse shape has a lower adjacent channel protection
than the LGMSK pulse shape, there is BER performance improvement when this pulse shape
is used, leading to an improvement for both the tight and loose reuse scenarios. This can be

A set of simulations were created to compare different channel allocation algorithms.
Table 8.18 shows the results for the normal, purely OSC-based algorithm and for the hybrid
algorithm. Evaluation was made in scenario 1. It is noted that the hybrid algorithm achieved
the best performance. This algorithm included both interference estimation and path loss
measurement.
User diversity simulation results are demonstrated in Figure 8.30, where a significan im-
provement in bad quality calls rate is shown when user diversity is used. In Figure 8.30 an
average BQC improvement of 35% is observed, since the mean FER for OSC was reduced
due to the improved interference diversity received by each OSC user.

The simulation results shown in Figure 8.31 display the possible benefit of using sub-
channel specifi power control for OSC when 50% of the mobiles are non-DARP. In all the
simulations a fi ed constellation pattern is used when DARP Phase 1 and non-DARP receivers
are multiplexed on the same channel. Labels used to indicate which constellation pattern is
used in each curve are described in Table 8.15.
From these simulations, a capacity gain of about 2% and 12% was observed in Scenarios
1 and 2, respectively, when using the constellation pattern RE1SQ3. In addition to this gain
in the overall call quality, it was observed in Scenario 2, for instance, that the FER on OSC
frames for non-DARP receivers has decreased from 22% to 6% while it has increased from
0.3% to 7% for the DARP Phase 1 receiver. Therefore, sub-channel power control for OSC
has been shown to be an efficien method for equalizing the FER among users in different
conditions, leading to a reduction in the power levels requested by non-DARP mobile stations
and, thus, a decrease in the overall interference level on the network.

increasing the percentage of Bad Quality calls. Although it might be expected that the Double

ing Bad Quality Calls is provided by the Soft FACCH stealing using RE4SQ0 constellation

Double Stealing could cause FACCH retransmissions, thereby decreasing the call quality of
the second user.
Significan gains in the Dropped Calls can already be achieved by using only one rectangular
burst with Soft SACCH stealing (RE1SQ3). This scheme has presented 20% improvement in
the proportion of dropped calls near the 30% EFL network load point, while increasing the
amount of BQCs by only 6%. This could be a good compromise between speech degradation
and dropped calls. With the RE2SQ2 soft-stealing scheme, Dropped calls were improved by
30% to around 30% EFL point, while increasing BQC by 10%. These results demonstrate the
trade-off between DCR and call quality. Selection of the optimal FACCH stealing scheme for
a given network depends on the network characteristics and on the desired target values and
balance between Dropped and BQC rates.

OSC Drive Test Motivation and Set-Up
Orthogonal-Sub Channels is a concept where the different implementations of legacy terminals
could have a significan impact on the performance – especially given that such terminals have
not been optimized to receive and demodulate the composite signal of two users. Therefore
it is important to verify the simulations by performing fiel trials and drive tests, where the
legacy terminals, base stations and multipath radio propagation environment are used to verify
the expected performance and functionality.
To demonstrate OSC in a real-time environment, the OSC feature [5] was implemented in
a GSM base station. A set of drive tests were performed where the OSC feature was enabled
with four users sharing the same physical radio resource. An Abis protocol analyzer collected
the DHR call traces and further post-processing was performed to obtain the RxLevel and
FER results from OSC traces and to estimate the speech MOS.
Power control was enabled in the UL and disabled in the DL. Codec mode adaptation was
enabled and the calls were directly initiated in DHR mode. Intra-cell handovers were not
allowed and all the mobile phones were located in the same drive test car.

Figure 8.38
UL MOS, Double Half-Rate and Half-Rate, versus RxLevel measurement traces samples.
MOS estimation, seen in Figure 8.36 and Figure 8.37, was calculated from the median
codec mode and over two seconds averaging period. Codec mode and FER were mapped into
a MOS value based on the MOS results in [14]. It can be seen from the results that most of the
time, MOS is above 3.2, which is usually determines the target threshold for a good quality
voice call.
Next, DHR MOS was compared to normal reference HR MOS to evaluate the impact on
voice quality. The results of this comparison are shown in Figures 8.38 and 8.39. In this case
DHR requires a higher RxLevel than normal HR to maintain a good MOS quality level. In UL
the DHR achieves MOS values above 3.2 up to RxLevel of −105 dBm, for example almost for
the whole coverage area of the drive test route. The reference HR achieves MOS 4.0 almost
throughout the whole drive test route until the coverage runs out and MOS drops quickly.
It is worth noting that when the RxLevel gets lower, the DHR starts to gradually degrade at
−70 dBm as expected, but the DHR MOS can be still maintained above the good quality
threshold of 3.2 MOS.
Somewhat similar conclusions can be drawn from the MOS downlink measurements. DHR
starts with good MOS quality above the 3.2 threshold. When RxLevel decreases as a function of
distance, then also the MOS starts to decrease and drops below 3.2 around RxLevel −95 dBm.
Interestingly, the MOS values close to the base station were higher than the reference.
Based on the drive tests,it can be concluded that OSC deployment is a feasible option and
can provide good MOS and coverage in legacy networks with doubled hardware capacity.

Conclusion
Voice capacity of the GSM networks has increased multifold since the introduction of GSM
Phase 1 voice service. In this chapter, the focus was on the latest voice capacity features,
namely AMR, DARP Phase 1, Orthogonal Sub-Channels and VAMOS, which is standardized
in 3GPP Release 9.
The AMR and DARP Phase 1 features provide improvements in link performance which
enable the introduction of OSC and VAMOS. In the downlink, the interfering sub-channel is
equivalent to another GMSK modulated signal and hence it is possible for a DARP Phase 1
mobile to reduce the impact of this interference. In the uplink, the concept can be seen as a
multi-user MIMO system where the separation of the signals is taken care of by independent
multipath channel characteristics. Robust AMR codec modes make sure that OSC can be used
in the lower C/I conditions.
OSC enables a maximum of 32 voice calls per one TRX and thus significantl improves
GSM voice HW efficien y. As shown with the system level simulations, OSC provides high
capacity gains in blocking limited scenarios. In the interference-limited networks, gains are
more limited. In 3GPP Release 9 a new set of training sequences and downlink constellation
power control have already been specifie and a wider transmit pulse shape is under study.
With these new enhancements spectral efficien y can be significantl improved. For example,
simulation results showed that 30% capacity gains in the interference-limited network are
achievable. OSC has also been tested in the fiel where measurements demonstrated that four
calls can be carried in one GSM radio time slot. Furthermore, there are several enhancement
methods under study, which can further improve the capacity of voice evolution concepts.

276
GSM/EDGE
AMR, DARP Phase 1, OSC and VAMOS provide additive gains which can be used to
achieve very high spectral and hardware efficiencie for GSM voice traffic These gains
can be exploited in multi-technology networks and in the re-farming of the GSM 900 MHz
band. By investing in advanced GSM voice capacity features, operators can target small
spectrum allocations without impacting the service level performance, and thereby maximize
the available resources for mobile broadband.

lies in its superior speech quality compared to traditional narrowband (NB) telephony thanks
to an extended audio bandwidth.
In this chapter on Wideband AMR Performance, these speech quality improvements are
evaluated in detail together with their effects on radio network performance and capacity.
The chapter considers the performance of AMR-WB in GERAN networks from several
perspectives. First, listening tests are described which assess the perceived quality difference
between wideband and narrowband coded speech. A network planning study is then described
which investigated the impact of AMR-WB on coverage and quality in the network. Different
frequency reuse patterns were applied ranging from 4/3 down to 1/1. Finally, the network
performance of AMR-WB is analyzed by network simulation, taking into account results from
the network planning study and listening tests as well as dynamic effects such as fading,
power control, and AMR codec mode adaptation. These simulations complement the results
of the planning study and provide a detailed evaluation of quality and capacity in AMR-WB
networks when compared to conventional AMR-NB.

Introduction
The AMR-NB speech codec, which is already well established in mobile networks [4–9],
outperforms older codec standards such as “Enhanced Full-Rate” (GSM-EFR), “Full-Rate”
(GSM-FR), and “Half-Rate” (GSM-HR) both in respect to speech quality and error robustness
[10]. The next major step towards excellent speech quality was achieved with the introduction

of AMR-WB, which was standardized for use both in GSM and UMTS mobile networks
[1, 2, 11] and which has been adopted by the ITU-T as Recommendation G.722.2, thereby
facilitating its introduction across other networks [3].
3GPP Release 8 define fi e codec modes ranging from 6.60 kbps to 23.85 kbps [8]. In
GSM/EDGE, all fi e of these codecs are supported on the 8-PSK full-rate speech channel
(O-TCH/WFS), three are supported on the GMSK full-rate speech channel (TCH/WFS) and
three are supported on the 8-PSK half-rate channel (O-TCH/WHS). The source rates compare
with the eight codec modes of AMR-NB which range from 4.75 kbps to 12.2 kbps and to the
source rate of ISDN narrowband speech which employs G.711 A-law coding [12] which is
delivered at a rate of 64 kbps.
9.3
Audio Bandwidth Extension for More Natural Sounding Speech
The benefi of AMR-WB over traditional narrowband telephony lies in the audio bandwidth
extension. Extending the upper frequency coding range from 3400 Hz to 7000 Hz improves
intelligibility, while a lower frequency extension from 300 Hz down to 50 Hz contributes
to a more natural sound impression. Figure 9.1 shows a time signal s(t) and its spectrogram
L(f,t) as a function of time and frequency for an AMR-WB audio signal under error-free radio
conditions [13]. The combination of P.3411 and MSIN2 filterin
was applied to reflec the

bandwidth limitations caused by technical restrictions in mobile phones. These include both
the miniaturization of loudspeakers and acoustic design considerations such as suppression
of low-frequency noise and optimization of intelligibility. In the spectrogram, the blackening
signifie the amount of signal energy in the time/frequency domain. A frequency scale has been
chosen which is proportional to the Bark scale (to obtain an aurally-adequate spectrogram)
[14]. While a significan amount of energy can be seen in the low frequency extension range,
its contribution in terms of information is only low. The main benefi of AMR-WB coding
lies in the extension in the upper frequency range and at these frequencies, information can be
seen which is not conveyed in the narrowband area.
9.4
End-User’s Quality Perception by Listening Tests
9.4.1
Test Method
The difference in the perceived quality between wideband and narrowband coded speech can
be quantifie by performing listening tests [15]. One such listening test method that can be
used to compare different bandwidths within the same experiment is the “MUlti Stimulus test
with Hidden Reference and Anchors” (MUSHRA) [16–18]. MUSHRA has been designed to
provide a reliable and repeatable measure of the quality of intermediate-quality signals [16].
In this chapter, a modifie MUSHRA test methodology is adopted whereby the listeners have
been taken from a selection of standard mobile phone users instead of professional listeners.
While a quality assessment by people recruited on the street represents a deviation from the
strict MUSHRA concept, it was chosen in order to evaluate better the end-user’s perception.
9.4.2
Experimental Design
In MUSHRA, “multiple stimulus” means differently processed versions of a sound source
are presented simultaneously on a display to be played at random by pressing a button. This
allows the test subject to listen to one version and to switch quickly to another version. The
original unprocessed version of the source is also presented and is identifie as the reference
version. This guarantees that the listener knows how each version should sound. That would
not be the case in Absolute Category Rating (ACR) tests [19]. Among versions to be assessed,
the MUSHRA test also includes a hidden reference and so-called anchors. Thus the original
unprocessed version also appears as one of the versions to be graded by the subject. Anchors
are low-pass filtere
originals with a band limit at 3.5 kHz (NB anchor) and 7 kHz (WB
anchor), respectively [17]. Both the hidden reference and anchors provide a reference grid that
covers the grading scale.
The subjects were instructed to rate the speech quality of each signal on a scale of 0 to
100 with the understanding that 100 corresponded to the reference [15]. The term “speech
quality” is not define so the listener’s understanding could be a combination of intelligibility
and general quality impression. The fact that a hidden reference appears among the versions
to be graded is not revealed to the subjects. Subjects were asked to proceed in two steps. In the
first the quality is classifie according to a coarse scale of fi e equidistant ranges representing
“excellent”, “good”, “fair”, “poor”, and “bad” quality. In the second step, a refinemen of the
setting was requested, this time using the continuous scale between 0 and 100. It was left to

280
GSM/EDGE
the subject to decide whether his/her assessments were satisfactory and when to terminate the
experiment.
The experiments were controlled by a computer which was connected via an external sound
card and amplifie for individual volume control to a monaural headphone. The test subjects
were trained in a previous experiment to make them familiar with the user interface and to
expose them to the range of the sound quality. All tests were carried out in a silent environment
by an independent research institute.
9.4.3
Test Conditions and Stimuli
A total number of 150 test subjects (78 male, 72 female) were recruited at three different
locations in Germany. They represented a uniform distribution of business users and private
users in four age categories: 16–25, 26–40, 41–55, and over 55 years. People with hearing
impairments were not included.
In the main experiment, the type rating of AMR-WB against AMR-NB quality in error-free
conditions was conducted with a total number of 80 subjects. Four additional experiment types
in error-prone channel conditions within specifi GSM channels were also conducted, with
a total of 32 subjects each. For each experiment, subjects were randomly selected to reflec
proportions of the whole sample. Disregarding the training experiments, specifi combinations
of experiment type and speaker were presented not more than once per session. Audio source
material (recorded at 44.1 kHz) comprised eight different utterances in German language,
spoken by male or female speakers in clean or typical background noise, as shown in Table
9.1. Each sample lasted about 8 s.
The stimuli used in the test were generated from source material using rate conversion,
filtering transcoding, and level adjustment [15]. Characteristics of pre-filterin and possible
transcodings to determine stimulus are summarized in Table 9.2.
For error-prone channel transcoding, the encoded signal was passed through a radio channel
simulator, which was configure for the following conditions: single interferer, Typical Urban
3 km/h, ideal frequency hopping, GSM900 with carrier to interference ratios (C/I) of 1, 4, 7,
10, and 13 dB. Performance of the simulator was similar to the one used within ETSI/3GPP
AMR performance characterization tests [10,11]. In each condition only the best-suited AMR
codec mode was presented, as determined in advance by experienced listeners.

Listening Test Results
9.4.4.1
Error-Free Radio Channel Condition
Figure 9.2 shows the mean and 95% confidenc intervals of the results from the main experi-
ment corresponding to clean speech using male and female voices.3 Sample size is almost 40,
representing half of the 80 subjects who assessed clean speech but with some subjects rejected
due to an excessive variance in their hidden reference [15].
The hidden reference received the highest score but fell short of the expected value (100).
AMR-WB speech quality assessments stood out considerably from narrowband results, even
though they did not match up to the original sound alias reference. The quality improvement
of around 20 corresponds to a full step on the fi e-grade scale that the experiments maintained
in parallel with the continuous scale. The 7 kHz anchor ranked only slightly higher indicating
that losses due to wideband transcoding had only minor effects. These AMR-WB assessments
did not expose a difference between the 23.85 and 12.65 kbps transcoding.
The 3.5 kHz anchor adhered to the narrowband group, where no significan differences were
observed as well. Thus any AMR-NB transcoding losses in relation to G.711 (ISDN) were of
no importance.
3 Although channel codec types are mentioned, results for error-free channel conditions are a feature of the source
coding only and independent of the employed channel coding.

In the results corresponding to speech in background noise conditions shown in Figure 9.3,
the shape when compared to the clean speech results is virtually preserved. This confirm
the validity of prior observations. However, the level of the scores is reduced by a common
offset (20 on average). Thus, the score of the hidden reference misses the expected projection
considerably, a fact which will be discussed later.

Figure 9.4
Dependency of speech quality on speaker group for error-free channel: mean of assigned
values.
To further analyze the outcome of the main experiment, the dependency of the mean of
the assigned values has been depicted in terms of speaker group in Figure 9.4. Assessments
for single speakers or combinations of speakers with clean speech are shown on the left and
assessments for noisy speech are shown on the right. For example, the mean values in Figure
9.2 can be found directly to the left of “clean & noisy”, each plotted one above the other.
Similarly, the values in Figure 9.3 can be found to the right of center. Across speaker groups
the assessments of the same stimulus type are linked by lines to serve visual orientation. This
does not necessarily imply dependence between connected points. Added on the abscissa is
the sample size corresponding to the number of subjects contributing.
In a similar manner, Figure 9.5 shows the half-width of the 95% confidenc interval to
illustrate reliability of the mean values given above. Naturally, highest reliability is achieved
if assessments are averaged for all speakers, thus including the assessments of 77 subjects.
The size of the confidenc interval and its variance among different codec modes and filte
combinations increase with decreasing sample size, as statistics become less reliable. Average
standard deviation was determined to be round about 23, almost independent of the speaker
group.
When shifting the focus from clean speech to noisy speech in Figure 9.4, it becomes apparent
that the assignment levels vary more across speakers, revealing dependency on the nature of
the background noise (spectral distribution and level). Also it appears that the 7 kHz anchor
loses its small advantage over AMR-WB, hinting that wideband codec losses are even less
important in the presence of background noise. However, this tendency is not confirme for
error-prone channels, presented below.
It is important to note that while disregarding assessment offset variations, Figure 9.4
demonstrates that observations made previously for clean and noisy speech are essentially
reflecte in any subgroup.

When dividing results into individual speakers, two effects should be kept in mind: (a) low
statistical reliability due to small sample size and (b) effects peculiar to individual speakers
and background conditions. In any case, AMR-WB was always found to be of higher quality
than narrowband.
9.4.4.2
Error-Prone Radio Channel Conditions
Four additional experiments reflectin error-prone radio conditions for three AMR-WB chan-
nels and one AMR-NB channel are shown in Figures 9.6 to 9.9. Each figur depicts mean
values for clean speech represented by squares, noisy speech represented by asterisks, and
all speakers are represented by circles. The three stimulus types on the left correspond to the
hidden reference and anchors and the remaining types correspond to deteriorating radio condi-
tions for the given channel. Marks for 95% confidenc intervals are attached to the data points
of the “all speakers” group4 and data points were linked by lines for better visual distinction
only. Due to the fact that sample size is much smaller than in the main experiment, intervals
are somewhat larger.
Although confidenc intervals are of a considerable size, the curves of deteriorating speech
quality are clearly localized for almost all channels and speaker groups. In other words, the
mean values hardly deviate from a visually smooth curve for the deteriorating side of the

random error. Obviously, the subject’s assessment in relation to each other are likely more
reliable than the assessments for a particular stimulus between subjects. The subjects’ individ-
ual interpretations of scale create a spread that contributes to variance and, in consequence, to
standard deviation and confidenc width.

Speech quality of 3.5 kHz anchor plus/minus a small margin may serve as an orientation
for the level of AMR-NB in an error-free channel in Figures 9.6 to 9.8. This quality level also
corresponds to G.711, as evidenced by error-free channel results. The procedure delivers the
following results: except for poor radio conditions, wideband speech quality always outper-
forms error-free channel narrowband. The quality turnover points fall between 7 dB and 4 dB
C/I for O-TCH/WFS and TCH/WFS and between 10 dB and 7 dB for O-TCH/WHS.

For fair comparison with AMR-NB, its deterioration must also be taken into account. The
true turnover points are therefore even lower.
A common findin among the results was that the hidden reference was rated significantl
lower than the expected value of 100, especially in the case of noisy speech. Obviously some
subjects graded on an absolute scale rather than in relation to the reference, which naturally
discriminates speech in a distracting background. A likely explanation is that the meaning of
the reference was not always understood, or perhaps was in doubt, when the background noise
made a bad overall impression. Subjects recruited on the street cannot be expected to be as
attentive to the test procedure as experienced listeners would be in a genuine MUSHRA test.
However, this does not appear to compromise the basic validity of the results: The ordering
of the stimuli as well as the relative differences in their assessments is not affected when only
a smaller fraction of the full scale is used.
To summarize, the end-user study attests to a substantial gain in speech quality if wide-
band codecs like AMR-WB replace conventional narrowband codecs such as AMR-NB. The
challenge for network engineers is to exploit this benefi to the full in real networks.
9.5
Impact of AMR-WB on Network Planning5
For network analysis it is essential to identify to what extent the inherent quality gain by speech
coding enhancements is transferred to network performance improvement. Channel coding
of AMR-WB plays an important role in this investigation. The dependency of the perceived
speech quality on C/I was analyzed by listening tests and is shown in Figures 9.6 to 9.8.
The scope of this section is to identify the prevailing C/I conditions in various geographical
parts of the network and to map these conditions on to the operating ranges of the different
AMR-WB codec modes. The average C/I was calculated in a real network planning study
for dense urban and sub-urban deployment areas in Munich, Germany [20]. In addition,
the uplink (UL)/downlink (DL) power budget balance was analyzed for its impact on the
coverage.
9.5.1
Network Planning Model
The designed network was originally planned and optimized for indoor speech service using
plain GSM-FR speech. Sites were distributed to achieve an indoor received signal level
RxLev≥−104 dBm (corresponding to the receiver sensitivity of GSM Mobile Stations (MS)
according to 3GPP standard [21]) for 95% of the cell area. The link budget is presented in
Table 9.3. For 8-PSK modulated AMR-WB channel types O-TCH/WFS and O-TCH/WHS a
back-off of 2 dB in BTS output power, that is 46.3 dBm, was selected to account for peak-to-
average ratio (PAR) power excess. In UL a maximum MS transmission power of 27 dBm for
8-PSK modulation was used [21]. Specifi antenna characteristics are listed in Table 9.4. The
antenna down-tilt in the designed network area was optimized for improving the homogeneity

European cities were assumed.
Based on these values, the BTS deployment distancewas calculated using a tuned COST-231
two-slope propagation model. To achieve the desired indoor coverage (which corresponded to
an outdoor RxLev of −68.5 dBm or higher), the maximum site-to-site distance was 900 m.
Figure 9.10 shows the considered network area and deployed base stations.
9.5.2
Network Coverage Analysis for AMR-WB
The weaker path in the link budget is the UL, especially for 8-PSK modulation. Hence only
UL plots are shown in the following three figures where utilization of the different AMR-WB
codec modes based on coverage analysis is shown.
Figure 9.11 shows the indoor coverage for O-TCH/WFS. The utilization of various codec
modes within the network area depends on receiver sensitivity, which is specifi for each
codec mode. The legend indicates the required outdoor receive level for operating the cor-
responding codec mode in indoor environments. Areas in white indicate insufficien indoor
coverage.
However, full outdoor coverage is still provided for the whole area. Figure 9.12 demonstrates
the situation for O-TCH/WHS. Due to the higher signal level requirements of the O-TCH/WHS
codec modes, the regions with insufficien coverage (white) are larger than those in Figure
9.11. In these areas the utilization of the 8-PSK modulated codec modes is not possible and a
switch to GMSK modulation has to be performed. This provides higher output power. Finally,

The conclusion is that O-TCH/WFS and O-TCH/WHSprovide indoor coverage in almost the
entire network area planned for conventional GSM-FR speech codec. Fallback to TCH/WFS
allows full area indoor coverage. Deployment of further base stations or re-planning of the
network is not necessary.

Network Quality and Capacity Advantage of AMR-WB over
AMR-NB
In the previous section, the performance of the network in terms of C/I was evaluated for
the different geographical parts of the network. In this section, the evaluation is extended to
performance in terms of quality on a cell basis using a fully functional system level simulation
model. Focus is shifted from static users to moving subscribers including the dynamic effects
within mobile networks. A key aspect for capacity analysis is the performance difference
between TCH/AFS and TCH/WFS channel types in interfering situations at various traffi
loads.
Although subjective speech quality improvements are provided by AMR-WB, the link
level performance for codec modes of comparable source bit rates remains similar to that of
AMRNB. In this section, the effect of improved audio perception in combination with the
impact of channel errors and call drops on the network performance is analyzed [13].
The combination of listening test results for AMR-NB [10], AMR-WB [11], MUSHRA
test results (Section 9.4) and instrumental PESQ [23] measurements provide a general relation
between speech quality and radio conditions. For the comparison between TCH/WFS and
TCH/AFS channel types, performance curves were generated using C/I as the common basis.
6 It has to be noted that the instantaneous C/I fluctuate around the mean C/I value due to fading effects. Hence true
codec mode adaptation is also necessary within areas of the same shades of gray and not only at the border regions. In
this study moderate codec mode adaptation thresholds were applied. Dynamic simulations described in the following
section show improved network quality for selecting slightly higher codec mode adaptation thresholds, that is more
frequent utilization of more robust codec modes.

MUSHRAtest results span the grid points for the two performance curves and defin the quality
difference between AMR-NB and AMR-WB at a given C/I. Because MUSHRA data spacing
is too coarse to interpolate continuous slopes over C/I with sufficien accuracy, the shapes of
the curves were derived using additional data sources. These comprised results of subjective
listening tests [10, 11] as well as our own experiments evaluating instrumental “objective”
speech quality based on PESQ. After approximating continuous shapes from the sources’ data
they were fitte to the MUSHRA data by adjusting offset and scaling on the quality dimension
and offset-only on the C/I dimension. Figure 9.17 shows the envelope of the best performing
codec modes on GMSK modulated full-rate traffi channels using TCH/WFS and TCH/AFS
as a function of C/I. The quality measure is Speech Quality Indicator (SQI), ranging from
0 to 1, with 1 representing the maximum achievable quality for TCH/WFS under error-free
radio conditions.7 TCH/WFS outperforms TCH/AFS for C/I higher than 3.5 dB. The reason
for the better performance of TCH/AFS below this turnover point is the availability of more
robust codec modes with source bit rates down to 4.75 kbps. The fundamental relationship
between SQI and C/I for TCH/WFS and TCH/AFS shown in Figure 9.17 was applied in the
performance analysis which follows.
9.6.1
Simulation Model
The quality analysis and capacity analysis for TCH/AFS and TCH/WFS were performed
by system level simulations for GSM900. A hexagonal cell layout in an urban deployment
7 Each SQI value represents the quality of the best performing codec mode for this channel type at given radio
conditions, that is movement on the envelope of the performance characteristics of the codec modes is assumed.

scenario for slow moving subscribers was assumed. Simulations were performed for three
different frequency reuse scenarios. For reuses 4/3 and 3/3, a frequency spectrum of 12 MHz
and 10MHzrespectivelywas assumed which included theBroadcastControlCHannel (BCCH)
frequencies. Speech service capacity was evaluated on TCH hopping carriers only since in
this case GPRS/EDGE and signaling channels were mainly configure on the BCCH carrier.
The BCCH carrier was planned in 4/3 reuse (consuming a bandwidth of 2.4 MHz), resulting
in up to four TCH carriers per cell, that is 32 GSM full-rate traffi channels. The speech traffi
on the four hopping transceivers (TRX) were fi ed at the hard blocking limit (22 Erlang for
32 traffi channels @ 1% blocking probability).
The tight reuse scenario 1/1 focuses on network operators with limited frequency spectrum
of for example 5MHz. A bandwidth of 12 hopping frequencies was assumed for TCH planning
in reuse 1/1.8 Latencies in the power control algorithm were modeled accurately. Real codec
mode adaptation with hysteresis and latency was applied in the simulation model.9 The system
load is given as Effective Frequency Load (EFL) which is the average traffi per cell divided by
the product of 8 GSM time slots and number of hopping frequencies. The focus of this study
was set on DL simulations. The essential parameter settings are summarized in Table 9.5.
Speech calls were generated according to a Poisson process with arrival rate λ depending
on the offered traffi load and mean call duration of 90 s. After positioning a new subscriber
in the 183 cell area, an independent slow fading value between each BTS to MS connection is
used. The MS chooses the cell with the lowest path loss and connects to this BTS. During the
simulation run aMS can change its serving cell by handover based on a power budget or quality
decision criterion using real handover modeling. Lognormal fading is modeled by a Gaussian
distribution with a standard deviation of σ = 6 dB and a correlation distance of 50 m. The fast
fading values are modeled by Rayleigh distribution derived from link level simulations.
The value is updated for each speech burst (≈5 ms) assuming constant C/I during burst
length and resulting in a time dependent fast fading, uncorrelated between each frequency
and BTS-MS path. The C/I per speech burst is calculated as the ratio of the carrier signal
between serving BTS and MS and the sum of all interfering signals considering co-channel
and adjacent channel interference.
9.6.2
Quality Criteria
9.6.2.1
Speech Quality Indicator (SQI)
GSM radio network planning typically aims at a mean C/I of 9 dB at the cell border as a
minimum requirement for networks planned in relaxed frequency reuse. According to Figure
9.17, the corresponding SQI for AMR-NB is 0.69. In tight reuse networks lower quality is
tolerated for the benefi of increased capacity. Hence in the tight reuse scenario a slightly lower
quality requirement of SQI = 0.66 was assumed corresponding to 7 dB C/I. In the simulation
8 Four TRX can be configure per cell if using static Mobile Allocation Index Offset (MAIO). Applying dynamic
MAIO allocation in reuse 1x1, up to 12 TRX can be deployed depending on the operator’s capacity requirements.
Thus installing a sufficien number of TRX per cell, hard blocking due to lack of resources can be minimized.
9 It is assumed that always one link limits connection quality, which in this case is the GSM side. Hence the impact
of the remote link on codec mode adaptation was ignored. Impacts of in-band signaling decoding errors as well as
advanced features like TX diversity, switched beams (adaptive antennae) and interference cancellation algorithms
such as SAIC [24] were not taken into account.

model the C/I is averaged in a rectangular filte of 1.92 s length (4 SACCH periods) and
transformed into a SQI value according to the relation shown in Figure 9.17.
The quality criterion to be fulfille is that 95% of the calls need to show a mean SQI per
call higher than 0.69 for relaxed frequency reuse and higher than 0.66 for tight 1/1 frequency
reuse.
9.6.2.2
Frame Erasure Rate (FER)
SQI is based on assessments related to general speech quality impression rather than intel-
ligibility. Increasing the traffi load increases the interference in a network resulting in an
increased amount of frame errors and consequently a loss of information. To minimize the loss
of information, a certain level of FER should not be exceeded. In this study a maximum value
of 2% per call was assumed. From a link level point of view, the support of robust codec modes
with source bit rates down to 4.75 kbps provide a C/I gain of 2 dB at FER = 2% for TCH/AFS
compared to TCH/WFS. A further advantage of TCH/AFS is related to faster codec mode
adaptation [25] in tandem mode. The higher latency of codec mode adaptation using Tandem
Free Operation (TFO) [26,27], which is the prerequisite for AMR-WB, leads furthermore to
an increased probability of sequential frame errors. Sequentially lost frames create a subjective
impression of speech degradation more severe than reflecte by SQI, the latter being more
trustable for sporadic frame errors. The most severe impact is given if complete words are
missing in a conversation (e.g. the word “not” in a negotiation!). These frame errors in a row

296
GSM/EDGE
are likely to occur if the most robust codec mode is already applied. This is more likely with
TCH/WFS which has less robust codec modes than TCH/AFS (see Table 9.5).
Assuming a certain FER impairing intelligibility, the well-established criterion of mean
FER per call lower than 2% to be fulfille
for 95% of the subscribers was considered the
quality limit.
9.6.2.3
Bad Quality Probability (BQP)
Alternatively, the speech quality degradation caused by frame errors can be quantifie
by
the percentage of speech samples taken within certain sampling intervals (e.g. over 4 SACCH
periods, i.e. 1.92 s, with FER higher than a specifi threshold, e.g. FERmax=2.5%). Since such
speech samples indicate bad speech quality, the probability (percentage) of their occurrence is
termed BQP. The target speech quality performance is deemed satisfactory if the BQP in the
network is lower than 5%.

9.6.2.4
Call Drop Rate (CDR)
A further capacity-related criterion is CDR, which can be due to excessive failures on the
Associated Control CHannels (ACCH). Temporary ACCH overpower [28] was applied to
reduce the C/I gap in the link level performance between AMR voice on TCH and ACCH
in order to improve the probability of successful decoding of the xACCH (FACCH/SACCH)
frames10 (refer to Chapter 12, Section 12.3). The criterion reflectin user satisfaction is CDR
lower than 2%.

Performance Results for Networks in Relaxed Frequency
Reuse Planning
Figure 9.18 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of mean SQI per call for
TCH/AFS and TCH/WFS in 4/3 reuse. The low interference level in 4/3 reuse networks and
the large averaging window size result in steep SQI distributions for both channel types. The
quality criterion mean SQI > 0.69 is fulfille for 100% of the TCH/AFS and TCH/WFS calls.
For TCH/AFS the 5th percentile of mean SQI is 0.71, that is more than 95% of the
calls provide the maximum achievable quality for this channel type. For TCH/WFS the 5th
percentile of the mean SQI distribution is 1.00, that is for both channel types the highest
network homogeneity was observed at a significan quality difference of SQI = 0.29 between
AMR-WB and AMR-NB.11
Figure 9.19 presents the CDF of the mean FER per call in 4/3 reuse. The quality criterion
means FER per call lower than 2% is fulfille for 99.8% of the calls for TCH/AFS and 99.7%
10 Repeated xACCH including soft combining was not applied in the simulations, because speech frame stealing
by signaling channels is not considered in the fundamental transformation of C/I on SQI in Figure 9.17.
11 In the 3/3 frequency reuse scenario, the 5th percentile of the distribution of mean SQI is again 0.71 for TCH/AFS
and 1.00 for TCH/WFS.

of the calls for TCH/WFS. At the 95th percentile the mean FER of 0.18% for TCH/AFS is in
the same order as mean FER of 0.23% for TCH/WFS.12
In 4/3 reuse, the BQP criterion is fulfille for 99.7% of the TCH/AFS samples and for 99.5%
of the TCH/WFS samples, respectively. The CDR is below 0.01%.13 As a conclusion, in relaxed
frequency reuse the FER of both channel types (TCH/AFS and TCH/WFS) is comparable and
sufficientl low. The major performance difference indicated by SQI is related to the inherent
speech quality improvement of the AMR-WB speech codec. The capacity of relaxed reuse
schemes is limited by hard blocking, that is lack of resources.
9.6.4
Performance Results for Networks in Tight Frequency
Reuse Planning
As the traffi load increases in high capacity tight reuse networks with a large number of TRX
installed in each cell, the interference level caused especially by the cells of neighbor sites
increases dramatically. In tight frequency reuse networks a different type of capacity limitation
comes into play: soft-blocking. The soft-blocking limit define the maximum traffi load at
which the allocation of additional calls would violate the operator’s quality expectations. In
the following the soft-blocking limit is define by the combination of multiple quality criteria
SQI, FER, BQP, and CDR.
9.6.4.1
Quality Criterion SQI
Figures 9.20 and 9.21 show the CDFs of mean SQI per call for TCH/AFS and TCH/WFS,
respectively. The quality criterion of mean SQI per call higher than 0.66 is fulfille for more
than 95% of the calls for an EFL up to 21% for TCH/AFS and up to 32% for TCH/WFS,
respectively.
9.6.4.2
Quality Criterion FER
Figure 9.22 shows the CDF of the mean FER per call for TCH/AFS at varying offered load.
The results for TCH/WFS are shown in Figure 9.23. The quality criterion for mean FER lower
than 2% for more than 95% of the calls is fulfille by TCH/AFS for an offered EFL up to 20%,
nearly achieving the maximum EFL for the SQI criterion (21% EFL). For TCH/WFS the FER
criterion is fulfille for an offered EFL up to 17%, yielding a significan gap between FER
and SQI based capacity limits. Selecting the more restrictive quality criterion (out of mean
SQI and mean FER per call) limits the capacity of TCH/WFS in tight reuse networks to 17%
EFL.14
12 In the 3/3 frequency reuse scenario, 95% of the calls are characterized by a mean FER lower than 0.31% for
TCH/AFS and lower than 0.38% for TCH/WFS, respectively.
13 In 3/3 reuse, the BQP criterion is fulfille for TCH/AFS for 99.4% of the samples. For TCH/WFS the BQP
criterion is met for 99.2% of the samples. The CDR is below 0.01%.
14 Higher capacity with respect to the FER criterion could be achieved by selecting higher codec mode adaptation
thresholds. The drawback is a reduction in the potentially achievable quality, since selecting a more robust codec
mode at good C/I levels results in subjective speech quality degradation.

Quality Criteria BQP and CDR
The BQP criterion is less restrictive than the mean FER < 2% criterion. The BQP criterion
is met for TCH/AFS at EFL of 31% and for TCH/WFS at EFL of 21%, respectively. BQP
and CDR results for 1/1 reuse at varying offered load are listed in Table 9.6. Considering the
BQP criterion along with the SQI criterion results in a soft-capacity limit of 21% EFL for both
channel types TCH/AFS and TCH/WFS. The requirement for CDR < 2% allows for 33%
EFL and is therefore less restrictive than the FER < 2% and BQP criteria for both channel
types.
However, without temporary ACCH overpower (results not listed in Table 9.6) the capacity
of the network would be limited by the dropping criterion to 25% EFL.
9.6.5
Combination of Quality Criteria
Figure 9.24 summarizes the results for TCH/AFS obtained with different satisfie user criteria
as a function of the EFL. Aiming at 95% satisfie users, the mean SQI criterion well matches
the FER criterion. The BQP and CDR are less restrictive criteria hence allow a higher capacity.
The results for TCH/WFS are shown in Figure 9.25. The graphs reveal a large gap between
the SQI and FER/BQP based quality criteria. Applying the less restrictive BQP criterion in
combination with mean SQI > 0.66 yields a maximum EFL of 21%, identical to that achieved
by TCH/AFS. Replacing the BQP criterion by the FER criterion results in amaximum
capacity of 17% EFL for TCH/WFS. The capacity limits for the different quality criteria are
summarized in Table 9.7.
This analysis shows that applying a single criterion for network dimensioning is not suf-
ficient Different quality criteria should be combined covering subjective speech quality and
intelligibility. Considering SQI and FER/BQP for network dimensioning the audio bandwidth
advantage of AMR-WB is exploited best if it serves to improve the subscriber’s quality
experience rather than boosting capacity.

Conclusion
Listening test results prove a substantial advantage in speech quality for wideband coded
speech over narrowband. For both clean and noisy speech, AMR-WB is perceived to be of

fi e grade MOS scale. In error-prone radio conditions, if C/I is not too low, the quality of
wideband speech for full-rate GMSK and 8-PSK channels was assessed to be higher than
narrowband speech in error-free conditions. The turnover point when quality becomes worse
ranges between 7 dB and 4 dB for full-rate GMSK and 8-PSK channels and between 10 dB and
7 dB for half-rate 8-PSK channel, respectively. For radio conditions above this point, speech
bandwidth is more important than coded-speech bit rate. In the presence of background noise,
this effect persists confirmin that the benefit of AMR-WB are not reduced.
This study analyzed to what extent this inherent quality gain is transferred into network
performance improvements. Coverage and quality impacts were investigated by planning a real
AMR-WB network. Based on the knowledge of AMR-WB performance in a geographical cell
layout, the quality differences within the network were studied in detail by network simulations
using an idealized cell layout. Both approaches in combination provided a comprehensive
analysis of quality and capacity in AMR-WB networks.
Deployment of AMR-WB in GERAN networks does not require additional sites, as shown
by coverage analysis. In the critical case of dense urban indoor scenarios some stray coverage
holes were only identifie for 8-PSK modulation due to limited MS output power. In these
regions a switch from 8-PSK to GMSK modulation will be triggered to ensure full coverage.
To analyze network quality and capacity in detail, four measures were used. A quality
measure called SQI was introduced founded on listening tests from above. Since SQI relates to
speech quality rather than to intelligibility, two additional criteria for determining themaximum
network capacity were applied. FER and BQP criteria reflec frame errors that lead to loss of
information during conversation. Finally, the Call Drop Rate was included in the analysis.
Results of the simulations show that AMR-WB gains a significan quality advantage over
AMR-NB in relaxed frequency reuse networks. Capacity is limited by the number of available
resources only. In high capacity tight reuse networks at varying traffi load, the SQI and
FER-based criteria are well aligned for TCH/AFS, whereas a large gap between these criteria
has been observed for TCH/WFS, which precludes full exploitation of subjective quality
advantages for capacity boost.
For providing both high speech quality and intelligibility in tight reuse networks, the capacity
of the network should be limited by admission control, taking into consideration a combination
of criteria covering both aspects in order not to lose sight of intelligibility.
Otherwise, if the entire subjective quality gain of AMR-WB is traded in for capacity
increase, user dissatisfaction is likely. This is because the quality span between busy and
non-busy hours would be considerable, exceeding that experienced with TCH/AFS by far. It

is thus recommended that the improved audio quality by AMR-WB should be used for quality
improvement rather than for capacity increase.

Introduction
The radio frequency spectrum is a scarce resource and the spectrum itself constitutes a major
investment the operators need to bear. Therefore spectral efficien y that quantifie the amount
of traffi a network can serve per MHz is a critical metric and solutions that would ensure reuse
of the existing spectrum in the most effective way have always been a top priority for mobile
network operators. Advanced spectral efficien y techniques are essential especially in narrow-
band scenarios, that is in networks having an allocated spectrum no higher than for example 5
or 7.2 MHz per link. However, they are gaining more importance in all networks facing rapid
traffi increase where more capacity is required. There is also a growing interest in deploying
other systems such as, for example WCDMA/HSPA into frequency bands already used by
GSM technology (e.g. 900 MHz) – a policy known as spectrum re-farming. To preserve GSM
capacity and service quality with reduced available spectrum, the implementation of features
to boost GSM spectral efficien y need to be considered. Features such as frequency hopping,
dynamic power control, discontinuous transmission (DTX) or more advanced solutions like
AdaptiveMulti-Rate (AMR), Orthogonal Sub-Channel (OSC) and finall Dynamic Frequency
and Channel Allocation (DFCA) are potential ways to enhance GSM spectral efficien y.
The main focus of this chapter is DFCA but for the sake of completeness, other solutions
such as MAIO management in asynchronous and synchronous networks are discussed here as
well since they are the intermediate steps on theway towards highly spectral efficien networks.
Section 10.2 outlines the basics of the frequency hopping feature. In Section 10.3 the principles
of intra-site interference management are described. Both static MAIO management that
provides the control over frequency hopping and allows intra-site interference to be minimized

and a dynamic MAIO allocation strategy that overcomes the limitation of the static MAIO
assignment are covered. With the introduction of network synchronization the static MAIO
allocation strategy can be extended to beyond the sectors of the same site which enables the
control of inter-site interference as well. The detailed description of this technique is provided
in Section 10.4. Finally, Section 10.5 presents a dynamic channel selection scheme called
Dynamic Frequency and Channel Allocation (DFCA). DFCA is a proprietary radio resource
management algorithm that aims to optimize the distribution of interference when taking into
account the unique channel quality requirements of different users and services. In addition
to the detailed description of the DFCA mechanism, this section also provides performance
results extracted from comprehensive simulation campaigns and fiel trials performed in real
networks around the world.
10.2
Frequency Hopping Basics
Frequency Hopping (FH) is a well-known and commonly used feature that provides a signifi
cant enhancement in the quality and capacity of GSM networks. When frequency hopping is
activated, the radio link performance is improved as a result of two main effects: frequency
diversity, which increases the fading de-correlation among the bursts that comprise a single
speech frame and thereby the efficien y of channel coding; and interference diversity, which
helps to mitigate the harmful impact of interference. In the GSM system, the so-called slow
frequency hopping is utilized, where the frequency may change after each TDMA frame (4.615
ms).
The frequency hopping rule for determining the frequency used in each TDMA frame is
based on two parameters: the mobile allocation index offset (MAIO) and the hopping sequence
number (HSN). TheMAIO parameter is used to specify an offset within the hopping sequence
and can take as many values as there are frequencies in the hopping list (i.e. the mobile
allocation or MA list). The HSN parameter define the hopping sequence and can take on 64
different values. When HSN is zero, the hopping mode is cyclic and when HSN is non-zero,
the hopping mode is pseudo-random.
The FH algorithm is described in [1]. For a given set of parameters, the index to the absolute
radio frequency channel number (ARFCN) in the MA list (the mobile allocation index or
MAI) is obtained from the following algorithm, where FN is the Frame Number and N is the
number of hopping frequencies (the number of elements in the MA list):
If HSN = 0 (cyclic hopping) then:
MAI, integer (0 . . . N −1):
MAI = (FN + MAIO) modulo N
else (HSN ̸= 0 random hopping):
MAI, integer (0 . . . N −1):
MAI = (S + MAIO) modulo N1
where S is calculated from the HSN, the time parameters, the number of frequencies and a
predefine table which can be found in [1].

Two sequences that are determined by the same FN and HSN but different MAIOs will
never overlap, that is the hopping sequences are orthogonal. Hopping sequences within a cell
can be kept orthogonal provided appropriate MAIO planning is applied and the number of
TRXs is lower than the length of the MA list. To keep the hopping sequences orthogonal
between several cells (e.g. between all sectors of a site), those cells have to be frame number
synchronized with a common FN. Two channels define by the same time slot number, the
same MA list but different HSN will interfere with each other only in 1/N bursts (in 1 out of
N), where N is the number of frequencies in the MA list. In this way the interference can be
averaged out over the network.
10.3
Intra-Site Interference Management
When radio frequency hopping and MAIO management are in use, there is a certain degree of
interference control that can be used to avoid or minimize undesired co-channel and adjacent
channel interference. In this section, we assume synchronization is between sectors of the
same site only and therefore limit the discussion to intra-site MAIO management. We also
consider a random frequency hopping scenario with tight frequency reuse pattern equal to 1/1.
10.3.1
Static MAIO Management
In a 1/1 frequency reuse network with random frequency hopping enabled, all the cells share the
same set of hopping frequencies, therefore inter-cell interference diversity can be achieved by
allocating different HSNs to all of them. When cells are synchronized with each other, there
is also the potential to remove the co-channel and adjacent channel inter-cell interference
through careful allocation of hopping parameters. In fact, if different MAIOs are assigned
to cells that have the same HSN and frame numbering, all co-channel interference can be
eliminated. Furthermore, cells can be prevented from operating on adjacent frequencies at the
same time provided that the assignment of adjacent MAIOs is avoided.
Radio bursts within the same cell are always synchronized in a GERAN network. This
means the co-channel and adjacent channel interference within a cell can be eliminated by
proper MAIO planning in combination with fractional loading (where fractional loading is
when the hopping frequencies exceed the hopping transceivers in a cell).
Typically, base stations that are located within the same BTS cabinet will share the same
frame clock source and therefore will always be synchronized relative to each other. It is also
quite straightforward to chain a common clock signal between BTS cabinets within the same
site, and that way achieve local synchronization. Thus, if synchronization between sectors of
the same site is supported, the frequencies used by each TRX within the site can be controlled
by assigning identical HSNs to all co-sited sectors and by appropriate MAIO planning (see
Figure 10.1).
A static MAIO allocation (SMA) is the strategy that consists of fi ed MAIOs assignments
to the hopping TRXs deployed in the same site. The principle is that available MAIOs are split
into subsets comprising different MAIOs for each sector. As the number of MAIOs is limited
to the number of frequencies in the MA list, the degree of control of both co-channel and
adjacent channel interference within the site will be determined by the applied fractional load.

When assuming a single MAIO usage with 12 hopping frequencies, the maximum number of
hopping TRXs per site is limited to 12. Should the fractional load exceed 33.33%, then a number
of deployment strategies are possible. One option is to maintain a static MAIO management
in all the sectors within the site, which will cause permanent co-channel interference between
certain TRXs. Another option is to allocate different HSNs per sector, which will increase the
overall interference but will randomize its occurrence. Another way to deal with the intra-site
interference would be to assign the same HSN only to two sectors within the site and to
use MAIO management to control the interference between them, while a different HSN is
assigned in the third sector of the site.
The performance of the different strategies has been compared by means of system level
simulations performed in a 1/1 frequency reuse scenario with 5 × 5 × 5 site configuratio
(5 hopping TRXs per cell, 3 sector site) and 12 hopping frequencies in the MA list (the
fractional load is therefore above 33.33%). The simulations also assumed an urban network
deployment with slowmoving subscribers (3 km/h), a hexagonal deployment with a site-to-site
distance of 1200 m, a propagation index of 3.76, a slow fading standard deviation of 8 dB
and a handover margin of 3 dB. AMR link adaptation was activated and only four AMR
FR codec modes (12.2, 7.4, 5.9, and 4.75 kbps) were included in active codec set. Also, the
performance of the non-BCCH layer was studied only. In all of the scenarios, speech quality
was evaluated in terms of Bad Quality Samples (BQS), where a Bad Quality Sample is define
as a sample of speech 4 SACCH periods in duration (1.92 s) with 2.1 % FER or higher.
The system load is given as Effective Frequency Load (EFL), which is the average voice

traffi per cell divided by the product of 8 time slots and the number of hopping frequencies.
For example in the considered scenario, voice traffi of 25 Erlang per cell results in EFL
of 26%.
Figure 10.2 shows the simulation results for three different interference management
strategies. Case A corresponds to the scenario with different HSNs in each sector and in
this case, interference between all cells, even co-located ones, can only be randomized.
Case B corresponds to the scenario where MAIO management is applied. As the number of
hopping TRXs per site exceeds the number of hopping frequencies, the MAIOs have to be
reused within the site. Finally, Case C is a combination of MAIO management that was done
between two sectors of the site having the same HSN and the third sector being allocated a
different HSN (to achieve a randomization of the remaining intra-site interference). It can be
seen that Case A has the worst performance in terms of BQS and that Case B outperforms
Case C. This is because in Case A the gain from MAIO management is not utilized at all,
that is control over intra-site interference is lost as all sectors have different HSN assigned. In
Case B, intra-site interference can be significantl reduced. Only when MSs are handled on
the same time slot number and on a TRXs with the same MAIO assigned, might continuous
co-channel interference occur. How strong the interference will be depends on where the MSs
are located. In the simulations, the radio resources were allocated in the randomized manner.
This means an intra-site co-channel assignment may happen also in low load conditions,
that is even when resources on non co-MAIO TRXs are available. By considering the results
of uplink idle channel measurements, such suboptimum resource assignments could be
partially minimized. In which case, the performance gap between Case C and Case B will
increase.

10.3.2
Dynamic MAIO Management
As mentioned in the previous section, the degree of control of both co-channel and adjacent
channel interference within the site provided by a static MAIO allocation is conditioned by
the fractional load. If the number of deployed on-site hopping transceivers exceeds half of
the number of hopping frequencies, then adjacent intra-site interference will occur. If the
number of hopping TRXs per site is higher than the number of hopping frequencies, then
the MAIOs have to be reused within the site. This means continuous intra-site co-channel
interference will be introduced between connections allocated on TRXs with the same MAIO.
This is especially relevant for MSs located at the sector border where they may experience
high co-channel and adjacent channel interference from the neighboring sector of the same
site due to the overlapping antenna diagrams.
Furthermore, a static MAIO allocation strategy does not offer an efficien use of the MAIOs
because of their fi ed assignment for each TRX. For this reason a dynamic MAIO allocation
(DMA) scheme has been introduced to allow a fully fl xible and optimum selection of the
time slot and MAIO pair for a new channel request.
In case of dynamic MAIO allocation, the list of MAIO values is not divided into subsets for
each sector but it is considered as common resource at the site level. So, for each incoming
call, DMA selects the best MAIO and time slot (TS) pair in a way that intra-site interference
is minimized. In this way, instantaneous non-uniformity of traffi distribution within the site
is exploited and non-optimum allocations may be avoided.
The DMA algorithm estimates the expected interference for all idle TS-MAIO combinations
by taking into account the TS-MAIO pairs being currently in use at the site, and allocates to an
upcoming call the TS-MAIO pair with the minimum expected interference level. This strategy
is based on an optimization algorithm operating on the entire TS × MAIO domain, which
means that all MAIOs can be used by any sector of the site. Figure 10.3 depicts a simplifie
scheme of the DMA algorithm.
For each incoming voice call (e.g. after call set-up or handover), DMA selects a channel
on the basis of the current MAIO utilization state within the site. Initially, all TS-MAIO
combinations are considered in the channel assignment problem and then the algorithm pro-
gressively restricts the solution space, until a single pair (TS-MAIO) is selected. In a firs step
for each free TS the best associated MAIO value is chosen (the MAIO selection step). Having
determined the list of candidate channels (TS-MAIO pairs), the best channel is selected (TS
selection step).
The benefit of the DMA feature are remarkable especially for an instantaneous inhomo-
geneous traffi distribution within the site, as this leads to an efficien use of the common
MAIO pool. To study the effect of the Dynamic MAIO Allocation strategy on GSM voice
performance in terms of capacity and quality, system level simulations have been performed
in a 1/1 frequency reuse scenario with 5 × 5 × 5 site configuratio (hopping TRXs) and 12
hopping frequencies in the MA list. The performance of SMA and DMA were evaluated for
varying load conditions expressed in EFL ranging from 10–35% (see Figure 10.4). Since the
DMA algorithm tries to minimize the number of MAIO repetitions within the site and controls
the number of adjacent MAIO allocations within the site, the best possible time slot and MAIO
pair were always selected. DMA outperformed SMA by reducing the intra-site adjacent and
also co-channel interference (once the load increased). It is worth noting that the difference
in DMA and SMA performance starts to decrease at very high EFL ranges. The reason is that

the TS-MAIO solution space becomes limited at the very high network loads and it is more
difficul to fin a clean TS-MAIO pair. While a uniform traffi distribution over the sectors of
the same site was assumed, an uneven traffi distribution in a real network environment will
lead to even higher gain with DMA.
10.4
Inter-Site and Intra-Site Interference Management
The solutions that have been described in the previous sections only help to combat intra-site
interference, while the dominant interference in a network is inter-site interference, as shown in
Figure 10.5. Therefore, the key to achieving highly spectral efficien networks is to implement
advanced ways of controlling inter- and intra-site interference.
Figure 10.6 shows a histogram derived from real downlink measurement reports provided by
mobile stations in dedicated mode. Based on the measurement reports, information on a cell’s
interdependencies can be collected and cells having the strongest interference relationships are
identified It can be seen that co-sited sectors (cells B and C) are not the strongest interferers
for the victim cell A which implies that the maximum possible interference suppression will
not be achieved if concentrated on intra-site interference only.
Without network synchronization, interference control is only generally feasible between
sectors of the same base station, while in a synchronized network the interference avoidance is
feasible between any sectors, irrespective of the base station. One way to achieve networkwide
synchronization is to provide the common master clock signal to all BTS sites in a cluster

or network. To this end, a stable and globally available clock signal from the GPS satellites
can be utilized. A GPS receiver in every BTS site provides a frame clock signal that can then
be distributed to all BTS cabinets in the site. The frame clock can be calculated from the
GPS clock signal according to the same rules in all the sites leading to common TDMA frame
alignment and numbering in all base stations. An alternative to the GPS-based synchronization
is a method that would exploit an MS capability to measure the time difference between the
serving and the target BTS during the handover procedure (Observed Time Difference (OTD)
based solution).
10.4.1
Extended Static MAIO Management
The disadvantage of static MAIO management described in Section 10.3.2 is that it does not
take the inter-cell interference relations into account, for example the strongest interferers
might not be eliminated. An alternative approach would be to synchronize cells based on
the mutual cell relations and plan the MAIOs not only within sites but also between sites to
achieve the maximum possible interference reduction. With such a strategy the synchronized
groups (the MAIO clusters) may have a more irregular pattern. This is illustrated in Figure
10.7 where a grouping of cells that will be subject to MAIO management has been created
according to their cell interference relation, in contrast to the case where MAIO planning has
been done between co-sited sectors only.
In “Extended” Static MAIO management, all the cells organized in a MAIO cluster are
assigned the same FN offset and the same HSN. The MAIOs are then planned as in the case
of MAIO planning between sectors of the same site, that is cells within the MAIO cluster
are treated as if they were of the same site. Given that the control of both co-channel and
adjacent channel interference between cells will be conditioned by the applied fractional load,

the grouping of the cells in MAIO clusters cannot be done according to the interference
matrix2 only. The maximum size of the MAIO cluster should be determined by the number
of the hopping frequencies. This is needed to avoid strong continuous co-channel interference
between certain TRXs in the cluster. Since the strongest interferers within a cluster are subject
to MAIO management, more care is needed to avoid a repeated MAIO than when planning
between co-sited sectors.
The drawback of this interference management method is the grouping of the cells in
MAIO clusters is done statically which ignores the time-varying nature of the interference
distribution. If the distribution of interference changes significantl , for example over a day,
then the grouping of the cells in MAIO clusters should also follow these changes. Moreover
any extensions to the cell configuratio may require the whole grouping process to be repeated
if MAIO clusters were optimized for maximum size. Indeed, in order to maximize the benefi
from extended MAIO planning, the clusters should include as many hopping TRXs as there
are hopping frequencies define in the MA list.
To investigate the benefit of extended static MAIO planning, system level simulations were
performed in a homogenous network with 4 × 4 × 4 site configuratio (hopping TRXs) and
12 hopping frequencies in the 1/1 reuse. Cells were grouped in MAIO clusters according to
the interference matrix. The percentage of satisfie
users was measured for changing load
conditions in terms of EFL. Speech quality has been evaluated by means of Bad Quality
Samples (the percentage of samples with FER higher than 2.1%). Simulation-based studies
showed that capacity gains of 10–20% can be achieved in a regular network layout scenario
with uniform traffi distribution when compared to intra-site static MAIO management (see
Figure 10.8). The actual gain will depend on the network topology and how well MAIO
clusterization is done. In real irregular networks, even higher gains may be expected.

Frame Number Offsets Considerations
A common TDMA frame numbering, when inter-site synchronization is implemented, is
not desirable at the wide area level since it leads to a coincident broadcast of the broadcast

common control channel (BCCH) and traffi (TCH) channel multi-frames in all the base
stations [2]. In the current method of performing neighbor cell measurements in GSM, the
MS measures the received signal strength (RXLEV) of neighbor cells on the cell BCCH
frequencies in the time slots between uplink transmission and downlink reception. A neighbor
cell is identifie by decoding BSIC on the Synchronization Channel (SCH) and it is required
that the MS decodes the BSIC at least every 10 seconds for that cell to be considered as a
handover candidate. RXLEV measurements from the six strongest base stations in the BCCH
Allocation (BA) list that satisfy this criterion are then included in each measurement report
together with their broadcast frequencies and BSICs. When a common TDMA frame number
is used for the BCCH, co-incident transmission of the synchronization bursts will occur in
every 10 TDMA frames (see Figure 10.9). An MS in dedicated mode will attempt to search for
neighbors during the idle frames and these idle frames occur once within a TCH multi-frame
of 26 TDMA frames (see Figure 10.10). Thus, if the network is synchronized with a common
frame numbering, BSIC decoding cannot be performed as often in a synchronous network
since the number of instances where a SCH will be co-incident with an idle TCH frame will
be reduced. This will affect BSIC decoding performance leading to a reduction in handover
performance.
Another issue with common frame numbering is the Slow Associated Control Channel
(SACCH) transmissions always occur at the same time over a synchronized area (see Figure
10.10). Since the SACCH is always transmitted regardless of voice activity, it would not
benefi from DTX at all [2]. This is undesirable, particularly with Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR)
where the benefit have been found to be limited by the signaling channel (SACCH, FACCH)
performance

The problems described above can be avoided by planning different frame number offsets
throughout the synchronized area. In order to improve identificatio of the neighboring cells
in a synchronized network, the frame numbering between cells should be shifted so that all
the synchronization bursts between neighboring cells are transmitted at different times. This
is achieved when the difference in FN offsets between two cells is neither zero nor a multiple
of 51. With this rule, simultaneous SACCH transmissions are also avoided.
10.4.1.2
Training Sequence Code Considerations
Another important aspect is the influenc of the Training Sequence Codes (TSC). The TSCs
used in GSM were originally optimized to ensure good autocorrelation properties, while the
cross-correlation properties were not so considered. For unsynchronized networks, this is not
an issue since the TSCs from different base stations coincide only randomly. However, with
base station synchronization, the training sequences will continuously coincide and this will
have an impact on receiver performance. Channel estimation is performed to characterize the
multipath fading profil and subsequently to mitigate the multipath fading by equalization.
However, with base station synchronization, cross-correlation energy will be received from

the interfering TSC code and this will result in a degradation to the channel estimation.
The higher the cross-correlation between TSCs, the more detrimental the impact on channel
estimation. For optimum network performance, TSC pairs assigned to cells operating on the
same frequency shall have vanishing cross-correlation properties. The best way to cope with
this problem is through TSC planning, where the likelihood of the worst TSC combinations
occurring is reduced. Since all neighboring cells are potential interferers in networks applying a
1/1 frequency reuse pattern, the following TSC planning rules might be applied: cells grouped
in a MAIO cluster (the same HSN and FN offset but different MAIOs assigned) may use
the same TSCs, whereas cells between which co-channel collisions appear should use pairs
with minimum cross-correlation. Moreover, the best pairs should be reserved for the strongest
interferers that may be identifie
based on for example the interference matrix and/or the
traffi load on the hopping layer. As mentioned previously, the distribution of interference on
the hopping layer may change significantl (e.g. during the day), which means that static TSC
planning will not be able to provide the optimum network performance. Therefore, by applying
a dynamic TSC allocation scheme that follows the interference variations, the performance of
the receivers may be improved.
10.5
Dynamic Frequency and Channel Allocation
The main characteristic of random frequency hopping is that two channels having different
HSNs, but the same frequency list and the same time slot, will interfere in 1/N of the bursts,
where N is the number of frequencies in the hopping sequence. This means that random
frequency hopping randomizes or averages the interference throughout the network.
Dynamic Frequency and Channel Allocation (DFCA) on the other hand tries to control rather
than randomize the interference and this can lead to a significan increase in the network spectral
efficien y. DFCA is a proprietary radio resource management functionality that dynamically
assigns the radio channel for each incoming call. Specificall , DFCA selects a radio channel
based on information about the interference in the network combined with the time slot
and frequency usage information. The idea behind DFCA is to assign a channel that provides
sufficien quality (in terms of C/I), so that the Quality of Service requirement of each connection
is met. Moreover, the radio channel is selected in such a way that outgoing interference caused
by a new call towards the existing connections is minimized. The main advantage of DFCA
compared to other channel allocation methods is that DFCA dynamically adapts to changing
interference conditions. DFCA is particularly suited to interference limited scenarios.
10.5.1
Interference Control
DFCA is a functionality that controls the interference in the network and hence improves
spectral efficien y. Control of interference is achieved with the aid of cyclic frequency hopping
and inter-site synchronization.
A short example below explains the method of interference control. In the example, only
one Mobile Allocation (MA) list containing the frequencies f0, f1, f2 and f3 is in use. The
BSC allocates two connections on two different TRXs. If these TRXs belong to the same site,
they are synchronized as usual. If the TRXs belong to different sites, they will need to be
synchronized in order to control the interference between them.

Figure 10.11
Interference control – no interference due to synchronization and correct MAIO plan.
In the example, the frequency of each TRX is taken from the same MA list and is changed
in every TDMA frame to another frequency in the MA list. Synchronization between TRXs
ensures that two calls will always use different frequencies: they use the same time slot number
and the same MA list but they do not interfere because they have different MAIOs assigned
(Figure 10.11). The interference is under control because the frequencies occur in certain
time slot numbers systematically (i.e. periodically) – the frequency separation (resulting from
MAIO assignment) between two interfering radio channels is the same and does not change
during the whole call duration. Indeed, focusing on one particular time slot (e.g. time slot
number 2 of TRX1 and TRX2, with TRX1 and TRX2 still using the same MA list), the
condition of co-channel interference is met only when the MAIO offset is compensated by the
FN offset:
(FN A + MAIOA) mod MA length = (FN B + MAIOB) mod MA length
This is an undesirable situation that may happen when TRX1 and TRX2 belong to different
cells and are not synchronized. In such a case, even with the correct MAIO plan, the above
equation can be satisfie due to differences in frame numbering (Figure 10.12).
Figure 10.12
Interference control – co-channel interference due to lack of synchronization.

320
GSM/EDGE
To ensure that the MAIO offset will not be compensated by the FN offset, inter-site synchro-
nization is required that allows the FN to be controlled. The DFCA algorithm is made aware
of the FN offset information and takes this into consideration during the channel selection
process so that MAIO offset compensation is avoided.
10.5.2
DFCA Channel Allocation
DFCA allocates the radio channel as a combination of the time slot, MA, MAIO and TSC.
It also calculates the initial DL and UL power reduction that should be applied at the very
beginning of the connection (before the standard power control algorithm start). When a
channel needs to be assigned as a result of a newly initiated connection or after handover,
DFCA evaluates all the possible candidates and chooses the most suitable one. For this reason,
the C/I is estimated for each available radio channel. The aim is to choose the best channel,
in terms of both incoming interference (the disturbance that the new connection would be
suffering) and outgoing interference (the disturbance that the new call would cause to other
calls in other cells). The C/I of an idle radio resource can be estimated based on the mobile
station measurement reports received by the network.
With pre-Release 99 mobiles the number of reported neighboring cells is limited to six.
However, with Release 99 compliant mobiles, more neighboring cells can be reported thanks
to the enhanced measurement reporting (EMR). In most cases, reporting of only six neighbors
is sufficien for handover evaluation purposes, but for interference estimation the potential C/I
needs to be determined from all the surrounding cells. While the C/I can be directly calculated
for the neighboring cells that are included in the latest measurement report (the C/I is estimated
based on the mobile Rx Level value of the serving and neighboring cells as well as the applied
DL power reduction), for the remaining surrounding cells, a statistical C/I estimation can
be performed. This is done by collecting long-term neighboring cell Rx Level measurement
statistics from mobile measurement reports sent within a cell. From these long-term statistics,
a C/I with a given outage probability can be determined for all the surrounding cells. This
information is stored in the BSC as an Interference Matrix (IM). That way, the DFCA can
estimate the C/I for all the potentially interfering cells even if some of them are not included
in the latest measurement report. Since the downlink path loss is generally equal to the uplink
pathloss, the C/I statistics can also be used to determined for the uplink.
There are four C/I estimations calculated for each available radio channel. The incoming C/I
describes the interference coming from existing connections that would affect the new call for
which a channel is being assigned. The new connection may also cause interference to existing
calls on the same or in an adjacent radio channel. This is examined by determining the outgoing
C/I for every potentially affected existing connection. The incoming and outgoing interference
levels are estimated separately for downlink and uplink directions. The C/I estimation relies
on the fact that the interference relations in a DFCA network are stable and predictable
(because of inter-site synchronization) and controlled (use of cyclic frequency hopping). The
C/I estimation is performed by combining information from the measurement reports, the
interference matrix and a BSC radio resource table where the current status of radio resources
occupation is stored.
In the C/I estimation process, the DFCA algorithm determines the interference that a new
user would experience with different available time slots, MA list, and MAIO combinations.

DFCA and Other Advanced Interference Management Techniques
321
This is done by searching all entries in the Interference Matrix to identify interference caused
by the co-channel and adjacent channel connections. In case of adjacent channel interference,
an adjacent channel protection is applied (usually 18 dB) to reflec the fact that adjacent
channel interference is less harmful for the connection than the co-channel (as a result of Rx
filte attenuation). For each channel the C/I value is estimated taking into account the strongest
interferer to achieve the most pessimistic value. If the analyzed interferer had been reported
in the latest MS measurement report, the C/I value is taken from that report, otherwise the
C/I value is taken from IM table. The fina C/I level is calculated by taking into account the
power reduction applied to the interfering call to obtain a more realistic value. The difference
between estimated C/I and the target C/I value (required C/I) is calculated. This difference is
calculated for the incoming and outgoing C/I for both the UL and DL direction. Among these
four C/I differences (calculated for the strongest interferer), the lowest is determined. This
most restrictive C/I difference is then used in the channel selection procedure.
Having determined the most restrictive C/I difference for all the candidate channels, the
channel with the highest C/I difference is checked against the soft-blocking limit. The soft-
blocking limit is a configurabl threshold in dB to ensure that the new connection would not
generate or would not suffer from too strong interference. Any channel request that breaks
the soft-blocking limit will be directed towards non-DFCA resources of the cell. Hence this
soft-blocking check is an admission control mechanism in DFCA networks.
For the DFCA layer, DFCA also takes care of the training sequence code allocation. After a
suitable channel has been found, the BSC determines the most suitable TSC by examining all
the interfering connections. Specificall , the BSC determines the training sequence code that
has been used by an interfering connection characterized by the highest C/I relation. This means
that for the selected MA, MAIO and time slot combination, the C/I differences are checked
TSC by TSC. The method of the training sequence code selection aims at avoiding the worst-
case situation where a significan interference source uses the same training sequence code as
the new connection. Such a conflic with a significan interferer would result in an incorrect
channel estimation in the receiver and would consequently lead to a link level performance
degradation. For that reason TSC used by the connection with the highest C/I difference is
selected by DFCA algorithm, to guarantee the new connection will have the smallest chance
for adverse effects from TSC cross-correlation.
The channel selection process above can be used for any service type (e.g. EFR, AMRHR,
SDCCH, (E)GPRS) according to its service specifi C/I target and C/I soft-blocking thresholds.
In case of an SDCCH allocation, the radio time slot and DFCA hopping parameters (MA
and MAIO) with the highest C/I difference are selected. If several combinations have the
same C/I value then the time slot having the most SDCCH connections is selected. If on the
selected time slot there are already SDCCH sub-channels being used, then for the next SDCCH
allocation on that time slot the same DFCA hopping parameters (as for the firs sub-channel)
must be used.
The DFCA algorithm may be involved also in the PS territory creation procedure which is
triggered when an (E)GPRS service is being activated in a cell. In such a case, DFCA calculates
the C/I for every time slot that is selected for the PS territory and selects the combination with
the best radio quality. If on a DFCA TRX there is already an existing PS territory that needs
to be upgraded, the DFCA will allocate the next time slots with the same DFCA hopping
parameters as previously used by the PS territory (multislot connections require that the same
hopping parameters are applied to all the assigned time slots). For these time slots, DFCA

322
GSM/EDGE
calculates the C/I and compares them against the soft-blocking threshold. If C/I soft-blocking
occurs for any time slot, only time slots starting from the soft blocked ones towards the border
of PS territory can be selected for an (E)GPRS upgrade. As the radio channel for the PS territory
upgrade is selected by the DFCA algorithm from C/I estimates in real time, the maximum
allowed interference level affecting each TCH and PDCH can be controlled by means of a
C/I soft-blocking check. This C/I soft-blocking check indeed works as an admission control
mechanism for the PS domain on DFCA layer.
10.5.3
Channel Allocation Based on Service-Specifi C/I Requirements
DFCA controls the interference in the network and by this provides better quality for the radio
channel. It also allows different QoS requirements to be set for different types of services (by
means of different C/I target thresholds). This is very important, especially when the robustness
of these services against interference varies significantl (e.g. due to different channel coding
schemes). For example, an AMR connection can tolerate much higher interference level than an
EFR connection while still maintaining comparable performance in terms of speech quality.
As the least robust service determines the minimum frequency reuse distance, the AMR
connection is often served in the hopping layer with 1/1 reuse while non-AMR connections
are served by the BCCH layer (which usually offers better quality than hopping layer). For
(E)GPRS services, higher C/I requirements are usually set for the benefi of higher modulation
and coding schemes. Examples of service type specifi C/I target and soft-blocking thresholds
are given in Table 10.3.
The DFCA algorithm considers service type specifi C/I requirements already during chan-
nel allocation and provides the channel with just the required quality. Furthermore, the same
requirements are evaluated each time a new potentially interfering channel is allocated, thus
aiming to keep the C/I above target for the whole duration of the connection. A new channel
can be allocated by the DFCA only if it does not cause an ongoing connection to fall below the
soft-blocking limit. Thus, DFCA automatically optimizes the usage of the frequency resource
without the need for network planning changes, which is often a consequence of growing
traffic
For SAIC-capable mobiles, which provide sufficien quality at higher interference levels,
a special configurabl offset is applied to the connection type specifi C/I target and C/I
soft-blocking thresholds.

10.5.4
Forced Half-Rate Mode
The DFCA feature controls the interference and allocates the channel according to the required
QoS. However, in high network load conditions, most resources are occupied and DFCA has
less freedom during the channel selection procedure. It is therefore important to increase the
half-rate usage in the high load scenario, even when there are sufficien hardware resources
available in the cell. In this situation, a conventional load based channel rate selection algorithm
between full-rate and half-rate will not be sufficient Therefore a “forced Half-rate mode” has
been introduced with DFCA. Forced HR mode is a way of performing channel rate selection
between full-rate and half-rate, based on the average of the estimated incoming DL C/I values.
The average DL C/I ratio provides a good benchmark of the load on the DFCA frequencies and
can therefore be used to force HR allocation. Forced HR mode is triggered if the averaged C/I
drops below a configurabl threshold (Figure 10.13). When HR allocation is forced in the cell,
it is triggered also in the interfering neighbor cells (to avoid a synchronized full-rate channel
interfering with both corresponding half-rate channels in the serving cell). When the cell is
in the forced HR mode, all new connections are assigned as HR channels. If during forced

HR mode the DFCA algorithm is unable to provide a HR channel above the soft-blocking
C/I threshold, the call is treated as soft-blocked and the resources on non-DFCA layer (e.g.
BCCH) are searched for an allocation. If there are no resources on the non-DFCA layer, an
FR connection is attempted on the DFCA TRX.
In general, triggering a DFCA forced HR mode with higher average C/I will lead to
earlier use of half-rate which will improve the overall C/I conditions in the DFCA network.
DFCA actually benefit from the greater degree of freedom during channel selection provided
by the intense use of HR channels which can lead to improved C/I conditions and better
overall speech quality (see Section 10.5.5.1). Forced half-rate mode allows DFCA to obtain
optimum performance independently of load-based channel rate selection, which can be used
conservatively to prevent unwanted half-rate usage in non-DFCA layers (Figure 10.13). In
DFCA networks, the load criterion is checked firs and if the condition for half-rate activation
is not fulfilled the C/I is compared against the C/I forced HR mode threshold. Thus, on
the DFCA layer there are more possibilities to activate a channel as half-rate – HR mode
can be chosen even if the load has not exceeded the threshold for a load-based channel rate
selection.
10.5.5
DFCA Performance Results
By controlling interference, the DFCA functionality provides the best possibleway of assigning
radio channels with the highest possible quality. This improves performance of both traffi
and signaling (FACCH and SACCH) channels compared to the non-DFCA scenario. As a
consequence, the key performance indicators such as Dropped Call Rate (DCR), uplink and
downlink Rx Quality as well as Frame Erasure Rate (FER) improve.
The performance of the DFCA has been evaluated in different scenarios by network level
simulations and fiel trials. The results are given in the next sections.
10.5.5.1
Simulation Results
A complete DFCA RRM algorithm was implemented in the simulator. In a real network-based
simulation scenario, the DFCA performance was compared with a reference case that utilized
a so-called ad-hoc random frequency hopping (an ad-hoc plan is a frequency plan that does
not respect frequency groups – frequencies are assigned on a per-need basis).
Only voice capacity on the hopping layer has been taken into account. The real network
scenario was used as it always has a varying degree of irregularities and it was expected that
highly dynamic nature of DFCA should be able to adapt to the irregularities. The typical
scenario was created by importing a network layout from a real network in a city center
and its surroundings. An uneven traffi distribution was used to achieve the cell loads that
were observed in the real network. As a result, the cell traffi was highly variable. Mobility
was simulated with the MS speed of 3km/h. Mean call duration was fi ed at 100 seconds.
Power control and discontinuous transmission (DTX factor 50%) in uplink and downlink were
enabled. The number of DFCA TRXs per cell ranged from one to fi e according to the real
network configuration In both the reference and the DFCA cases, 18 hopping frequencies
were used.

DFCA gain in terms of dropped call rate.
As shown in Figure 10.14, activation of the DFCA feature improves the DCR statistic.
Dropped call rate decreases because calls, which in the non-DFCA mode were abnormally
released due to interference, are now prevented from being dropped by the DFCA allocating
a channel with a lower interference level.
Simulation results show a DCR reduction of approximately 20% at 8% of EFL. This
performance improvement is called quality gain. At the same time DFCA reaches DCR of
0.6% at about 10% of EFL. This means that DFCA provides a capacity gain of 25%.
In addition to the improved dropped call rate, the simulations clearly indicate an improve-
ment in terms of Rx Quality. At 8% of EFL the percentage of bad RxQual samples (here
RxQual > 5) was reduced by approximately 60% in downlink and 75% in uplink (Figure
10.15). The number of measurement samples with bad Rx Quality is correlated with the level
of interference that is reduced by DFCA which allocates a channel that affects existing calls
in the least harmful way.
During the simulation campaign speech quality was evaluated in terms of Bad Quality
Samples (the percentage of samples with FER higher than 4.2%). When compared to the
reference scenario, DFCA considerably reduced the bad speech quality probability (FER >
4.2%) by 30% in the uplink and 40% in the downlink respectively (Figure 10.16).
An additional simulation campaign was performed for mixed PS and CS traffi in the same

case random frequency hopping with 1/1 reuse was applied. In the scenario with DFCA in
use, the management of the PS territory (i.e. creating, upgrading and downgrading), was fully
controlled by the DFCA algorithm. Two services were simultaneously simulated: voice with
AMR HR (50% of all calls) and FTP download using (E)GPRS. The performance of the

effect is minimized in the DFCA network owing to the intelligent radio resource allocation
scheme.
The activation of DFCA has also a positive influenc on the performance of PS services.
Indeed, DFCA provides better average C/I per time slot and therefore higher MCSs can be
used. This, in turn, leads to higher average LLC throughputs and shorter delays as shown in

very high (e.g. 95%) HR utilization offers similar speech quality as the non-DFCA network
with low HR usage. This means DFCA with high half-rate utilization is possible while voice
quality kept within acceptable levels. Higher HR utilization may be transformed into higher
BTS hardware efficien y (as more traffi can be served with a lower number of TRXs) and thus

10.5.5.2
DFCA Deployments in Live Networks
To verify the DFCA feature performance in real-life network scenarios, several fiel trials have
been carried out. The main focus of the trials was to validate the gains revealed by the system
level simulations, that is the impact of DFCA on the selected key performance indicators
such as dropped call rate and speech quality. Furthermore, the efficien y of the DFCA in the
narrowband scenario has been verified The influenc of high AMR HR penetration rate on
DFCA network performance has been evaluated as well.
Figure 10.21 shows the performance of the DFCA in terms of dropped call rate observed in
one of the trialled clusters. The benchmark case for the DFCA was random hopping with an
ad-hoc frequency plan (6 MHz for hopping + 3.6 MHz for BCCH). It can be seen that for a
given load operating point for example 10% of EFL, after DFCA activation, the dropped call
rate was improved by approximately 40%. This is due to the better radio conditions having a
positive influenc on the performance on the signaling channels (FACCH and SACCH).
Apart from the DCR, the RxQuality statistics were also collected over the network where
the trial took place (see Figure 10.22). It can be seen that DFCA provides approximately 45%
less samples with bad Rx Quality (samples with RXQUAL equal to 5 and 6 were considered as
bad quality ones) in DL and about 50% in UL at an EFL of 10%. The Rx Quality improvements
are due to a reduction in interference provided by the DFCA functionality.

DFCA performance in terms of DCR in the narrowband scenario.
To verify the DFCA efficien y in a more challenging environment, a dedicated trial was
carried out in a narrowband deployment scenario in which the length of the DFCA MA list
was gradually reduced from 16 to 12 and finall to 8 frequencies. The performance of the
DFCA functionality was benchmarked against the reference case with 18 hopping frequencies
in a 1/1 reuse pattern. The results demonstrated that DFCA can provide considerable capacity
and quality gains also in scenarios with very limited spectrum.
In Figure 10.25 depicting the dropped call rate statistics, it can be seen that DFCA allows
about three times higher EFL without any DCR performance degradation (with DFCA the
DCR of 1% was achieved at EFL of more than 20% while in the reference scenario the same
performance was observed at around EFL of 7%). Moreover, comparing the dropped call rate
statistics for the same load conditions, it can be seen that this KPI was significantl improved
with the help of the DFCA even when the spectrum was reduced from 18 to 16 frequencies.
The results given in Figure 10.26 and Figure 10.27 demonstrate that not only dropped call
rate but also the Rx Quality and FER statistics gain from DFCA even with significantl reduced
bandwidth available for the hopping layer.
As already stated, the DFCA enables high half-rate usage as it improves the overall C/I
distribution in the network. This has been confirme
by the results of the network trial in
which very high penetration of half-rate mode was achieved without quality degradation.
Figure 10.28 compares the performance of the non-DFCA and DFCA scenarios in terms of
uplink frame erasure rate. With the DFCA feature activated, the FER statistics improve slightly,
even though the HR utilization was almost doubled.
Summarizing the performance figure from simulations and fiel trials, one can conclude
that the DFCA functionality provides significan spectral efficien y gains. On the one hand,
higher network capacity can be achieved without compromising the most important KPIs,

while on the other hand, DFCA allows operators to serve the same traffi with the reduced
frequency spectrum while keeping quality at a satisfactory level. The DFCA functionality can
also efficientl manage a mix of CS and PS traffi in one common frequency band enhancing
both CS and PS services performance.

Another significan benefi of the DFCA feature is the excellent performance of half-rate
channels that enables very high HR usage without quality degradation that can be observed in

Moreover, DFCA simplifie the network planning. The DFCA TRXs do not have preassigned
frequencies, frequency hopping parameters and training sequence codes since DFCA allocates
the radio channel parameters “on the fly” This also simplifie the network capacity upgrades
as new TRXs can be introduced with minimum planning effort.

Introduction
In recent years, EGPRS technology has been evolving towards a high speed system that
should enable operators to provide new, more advanced and consequently more demanding
services. Offering services characterized by stringent quality requirements in combination
with huge increase in PS traffi volume has brought forward the challenge of how to manage
network resources more efficientl . This has increased the demand for techniques that increase
network capacity and consequently the operators’ revenues while ensuring satisfactory quality
for the end user. One way to face this challenge is the introduction of Quality of Service
(QoS) management techniques that provide measures to secure sufficien performance for
all services while maximizing the number of served subscribers. QoS management provides
the mechanisms for differentiation between services and users, prioritization of premium
subscribers and urgent traffi as well as guaranteeing certain quality levels for more demanding
applications at the expense of lower priority ones.
The aim of this chapter is to introduce the principles of QoS management in GERAN net-
works. The main focus is Admission Control and Quality Control functionalities. However,
for the sake of completeness, other complementary mechanisms such as Packet Flow Manage-
ment, QoS-aware channel allocation algorithms and data fl w scheduling are also discussed.
Section 11.2 explains the fundamentals of QoS management and provides a concise descrip-
tion of the 3GPP QoS architecture including the concepts of the PDP Context and BSS Packet
Flow Context. In Section 11.3 the procedures related to Admission Control are presented.
Section 11.4 provides a detailed description of the Quality Control mechanisms including load
balancing and its exemplary realization with Network Control Cell Reselection. In Section
11.5, the simulation results of a QoS-aware GERAN network are presented and analyzed.

networks in the support of conversational traffi class services, namely Network Assisted Cell
Change and Packet Switched Handover.
11.2
Quality of Service Management
Quality of Service, according to 3GPP, is the collective effect of service performance which
determines the degree of satisfaction of a service user. It is characterized by a combination
of factors such as service operability, accessibility, retention, integrity and other applica-
tionspecifi ones. To provide a mobile networks’ subscribers with satisfactory quality, while
maximizing network capacity, a set of mechanisms for efficien QoS management has been
introduced. The QoS management in mobile networks is based on the fact that a user’s expec-
tations vary a lot depending on the application type and that different performance levels may
be requested by users of different services.
The basic criteria for the service differentiation are: reliability (transmission link erroneous-
ness), throughput and delay requirements. For example, an e-mail application is characterized
by strict reliability and relatively relaxed delay requirements while a videoconferencing re-
quires small delays but tolerates some transmission errors. Services having strict delay and
loose reliability requirements are regarded as real-time services, for example videoconference,
Pushto- Talk over Cellular, audio/video streaming or Voice over IP. Services characterized by
high reliability and relaxed delay requirements are regarded as non-real-time services, for ex-
ample e-mail applications, web browsing or fil downloading. Furthermore, real-time services
usually require a guaranteed bit rate that is implied in the use of a video or audio codec, while
non-real-time services typically do not. This differentiation of the quality requirements of
various applications is the essence of QoS management in EGPRS networks. By classifying
and handling particular services according to their real needs, the QoS management allows
efficien network resources utilization and maximization of the number of satisfie users. The
concept of services differentiation is depicted in Figure 11.1. In this example, higher priority,
in terms of bandwidth, is assigned to the video streaming in order to guarantee minimum delay
and sufficien throughput, while web browsing and e-mail services, for which delay is less
critical, are allocated less bandwidth. Since e-mail is a typical background application, lower
priority is assigned to it compared to interactive web browsing.

QoS management includes measures to negotiate the quality to be provided to the applica-
tion, to prioritize particular connections and to guarantee certain performance for higherpriority
data fl ws at the expense of quality degradation of lower-priority ones. Guaranteeing adequate
performance for the most demanding applications requires mechanisms for the detailed esti-
mation of expected quality of the incoming data connection and its impact on ongoing data
fl ws. The so-called Admission Control (AC) functionality is in charge of blocking a new
connection establishment should its quality be inadequate or else it might degrade the perfor-
mance of already existing data fl ws to below acceptable limits. An efficien AC algorithm
needs information on the current utilization of the Base Station Subsystem (BSS) resources.
To make such information available already at the admission control stage, the Packet Flow
Management feature has been introduced, which controls the QoS profil negotiations between
SGSN and BSS and handles the BSS Packet Flow Contexts (see Section 11.2.2.1). The AC
mechanism is supported also by the resource reservation functionality which, after having ad-
mitted a newconnection, keeps resources reserved for a given period of time. QoS management
might also include an Allocation Retention Priority (ARP) feature which allows pre-emption
of lower priority connections in order to free resources for incoming higher priority ones.
The ARP mechanism also enables higher priority connections to retain their quality against
lower priority ones in congested scenarios. To sustain the negotiated quality for the lifetime
of the data fl w, Quality Control (QC) functions have been introduced. The QC mechanisms
aim to maintain the negotiated quality by detecting and reacting against potential QoS down-
grades. Another important component of QoS management is in the QoS-aware selection of
the transmission mode. For instance, some services with stringent delay requirements need to
be realized in unacknowledged mode (since acknowledged mode could result in unacceptable
delays), while those with high reliability prerequisites may require an acknowledged mode.
To realize an efficien QoS management, the above-mentioned functionalities need to be
supported by a QoS-wise resource allocation algorithm and data fl w scheduler as depicted in
Figure 11.2. The QoS-aware data fl w scheduler is aimed at ensuring that the high priority data
fl ws experience at least the minimum specifie quality even in highly loaded conditions by
sharing resources between connections according to their priorities. The resource allocation

algorithm aims to assign resources to particular data fl ws according to the requests coming
from other QoS mechanisms and provides feedback information to certain QoS algorithms.
Detailed description of QoS mechanisms and related parameters is provided in the next
sections.
The QoS mechanisms allow operators to realize different strategies, for example maximiza-
tion of the number of satisfie
users equally for all the services, or treating some selected
services as higher priority than others. The QoS management prioritization functions may be
used by the operators to differentiate not only between services but also between subscribers.
For example, high-priority packages with higher bit rates may be provided for premium users,
and low-priority affordable packages for budget users. Furthermore, it is possible to man-
age user priorities dynamically, for example to downgrade the priorities of the users having
exceeded their subscribed data volume limits.
The QoS mechanisms themselves are not a remedy for lack of network capacity. Rather,
they help in well-dimensioned networks to minimize the effects of high traffi load, especially
during busy hour congestion conditions, and thus improve the user’s experience. QoS manage-
ment may be regarded as a solution that ensures optimum usage of scarce network resources
and as a prerequisite for GERAN networks offering high data rate and delay-sensitive services,
such as video streaming or Voice over IP.
11.2.1
End-to-End QoS Architecture
In the context of end-to-end Quality of Service, the EGPRS network may be regarded as the
sub-system that provides data connectivity between a user terminal (e.g. mobile station or
laptop connected via mobile station) and an external IP network. The end-to-end transmission
path, between a user terminal and a service provider, consists of three domains: the Radio
Access Network, the Core Network and the external IP network (see Figure 11.3). Since
different QoS mechanisms are used along the end-to-end path, it is necessary to coordinate
the QoS management between all domains and this increases the complexity of the end-to-end
QoS management.
In the external IP network, QoS may be realized with for example Differentiated Services
(Diff- Serv), Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) or Integrated Services (IntServ) mech-
anisms. Similarly, for the IP-based mobile network core domain, any IP-specifi QoS solution
may be applied by the operator. To provide an end-to-end QoS in such a scenario, service
quality requirements must be appropriately mapped to QoS protocols in each domain. Fur-
thermore, a mechanism intended to integrate the different QoS algorithms will be needed.
In EGPRS networks, these integration functions might be implemented in the GGSN. For
example, the GGSN might utilize GERAN-specifi QoS attributes to configur the DiffServ
edge functionality and provide interworking between GERAN and IP-based networks [2,8].
11.2.2
3GPP QoS Architecture in GERAN
The concept of a GERAN QoS architecture was standardized by 3GPP in Release 97 and
Release 98, the main feature being the Packet Data Protocol Context. A PDP context is a
logical connection established between a mobile station and a GGSN to transfer all IP traffi
to and from the mobile station. The PDP context activation procedure makes the mobile station

visible in the external IP network and allows aQoS profil for an incoming data transfer session
to be negotiated between a mobile station and a network. While a PDP context activation is
usually triggered by the application layer in a terminal, a PDP context activation may also be
requested by a GGSN, although this would only be possible if a mobile station is assigned a
static IP address (which is not that common).
The concept of the PDP context is the essence of services differentiation in GERAN. The
basic idea is explained in Figure 11.4. QoS parameters are agreed on a per PDP context basis,
that is all applications sharing one PDP context have the same QoS profile For individual
treatment of particular applications, separate PDP context must be activated. In 3GPP Release
97 and Release 98, each PDP context has its own IP address. In 3GPP Release 99, an en-
hancement was introduced allowing several PDP contexts (with different QoS profiles to be
assigned to one common IP address. All the PDP contexts using the same IP address have to
be connected to the same Access Point Name, where the APN identifie the access point to
the external IP network and one APN may address one or several access points of the same
GGSN. The mapping between services and APNs via services that are available is done by the
operator and is usually based on QoS requirements as depicted in Figure 11.4. For example,
it is possible to provide all services via the same APN (scenarios 1 and 2 in Figure 11.4)
or to group services according to their QoS requirements and map them to different APNs
(scenario 3 in Figure 11.4). If different services are available via different APNs, the service
differentiation may require different PDP contexts connected to different APNs [1].
The PDP context activation request should ideally contain a detailed description of the
QoS requirements based on a set of standardized QoS attributes. However, mobile station
implementation depends on whether a PDP context activation request conveys explicit values

of certain QoS parameters or not. It is even possible that a PDP context activation request
is empty. Given this, it is possible to divide terminals into two groups: QoS-aware and non-
QoS-aware. Non-QoS-aware terminals (or application clients) are unable to indicate any QoS
requirements, in which case all the necessary information is retrieved by an SGSN from the
HLR (each subscriber has its own QoS profil created in the HLR). QoS-aware terminals are
able to indicate to the network explicit values of certain QoS attributes. Upon receiving a
PDP context activation request from a QoS-aware terminal, an SGSN checks with the HLR
if the requested service is available for the subscriber and triggers the GGSN to establish
a connection with an external IP network. If the requested QoS attributes exceed the upper
limits define
in the HLR profile the values from the HLR are used. If only some of the
QoS attributes are explicitly indicated by a QoS-aware terminal, the missing information will
be retrieved from the HLR. Having verifie the QoS profil and set up the PDP context, the
network indicates to a terminal that the PDP context has been activated with a PDP context
activation accept message, which contains the agreed QoS profil and the assigned IP address
to be used in communication with an external network. If the assigned QoS parameters are un-
acceptable, a mobile station may terminate the session by starting the PDP context deactivation
procedure.
When requesting the PDP context activation, a terminal may indicate to the network (besides
the QoS requirements), the APN via which the requested service should be realized. If different

Description
Precedence class
Indicates the relative priority of maintaining the service. There are three
service precedence levels:
r High precedence - guarantees service ahead all other precedence levels
r Normal precedence - guarantees service ahead of low priority ones
r Low precedence - receives service after commitments for high and normal
precedence services have been fulfille
Delay class
Define end-to-end transfer delay through EGPRS network. There are three
predictive delay classes for which maximum values of mean transfer delay
and 95th percentile are determined. There is also one best-effort class for
which no limits are specified
Reliability class
Indicates the transmission characteristics that are required by an application.
Data reliability is define in terms of:
r Probability of Service Data Unit (SDU) loss
r Probability of SDU deliver out of sequence
r Probability of duplicate SDU delivery and
r Probability of corrupted SDU
There are fi e different reliability classes.
Throughput class
Define the bandwidth requested by a PDP context. User data throughput
requirements are define by two negotiable parameters:
r Peak Throughput - specifie the expected maximum bit rate of data transfer
across EGPRS network. There is no guarantee that this peak throughput
can be achieved or sustained.
r Mean Throughput - specifie the average bit rate of data transfer across
EGPRS network (aggregated over the PDP context lifetime). There is no
guarantee that this throughput can be achieved or sustained.
applications are mapped by the operator to different APNs (scenario 3 in Figure 11.4) and if
for each subscriber a separate QoS profil was created for each APN, it is possible to realize
the strategy of service differentiation even for non-QoS-aware mobile stations. The only
prerequisite is that a non-QoS-aware terminal indicates, in the PDP context activation request,
the appropriate APN. This requires proper terminal configuration This kind of workaround
is not necessary for QoS-aware terminals that are able to differentiate services by requesting
service-specifi QoS attributes during PDP context activation even towards the same APN
(scenario 2 in Figure 11.4).
According to 3GPP Release 97 and Release 98, the service differentiation is based on four
attributes: precedence class, delay class, retainability class and throughput class. Definition
of particular attributes can be found in Table 11.1[5,6].
The 3GPP Release 97 and Release 98QoS architecture supports only non-real-time services,
such as e-mail, web browsing or fil transfer. To give operators better control of QoS in their
networks and to allow real-time services, the concept of BSS Packet Flow Context (PFC)
was introduced in 3GPP Release 99. With this mechanism an SGSN checks with the BSS
whether the requested QoS can be provided by the radio access network before a PDP context
is admitted. Having verifie the resource’s availability, a BSS creates the Packet Flow Context

for the PDP context. The single BSS PFC can be shared by several PDP contexts with identical
or similar negotiated QoS requirements. The set of QoS requirements of a PFC is called an
Aggregate BSS QoS Profil (ABQP). The ABQP determines the quality that must be provided
by a BSS to all the packet data fl ws established within the PFC. Radio as well as Abis and
Gb interfaces are here considered. PFC QoS parameters are negotiated between an SGSN and
a BSS based on the PDP context QoS attributes. More details on BSS PFC may be found in
Section 11.2.2.1.
In addition to the BSS PFC, 3GPP Release 99 brought to GERAN the concept of QoS traffi
classes and a new set of QoS parameters. These changes were introduced to keep the GERAN
QoS management aligned with 3GPP Release 99 for UTRAN.
Four different traffi classes have been define to distinguish between the various service
characteristics: background, interactive, streaming and conversational. These classes are dif-
ferentiated mainly by delay sensitivity, that is the conversational class is meant for the most
delay-sensitive applications while the background class is the most delay-insensitive. The
conversational and streaming classes are mainly dedicated to carry real-time traffi (see Table
11.2). The conversational class applies to the most delay-sensitive applications such as Voice
over IP, video over IP or real-time gaming, while the streaming class applies to delay-sensitive
applications such as audio and video streaming where the delay variations can be compensated
(up to the certain extent) with the use of buffering mechanisms. The interactive and background
classes are mainly intended to be used by applications with relaxed delay but more stringent
reliability requirements. The interactive class is based on typical request-response communi-
cation scheme such as web browsing. In the case of backgroundtype services, the receiving
side tolerates relatively longer response times and hence is less delay sensitive than interactive
ones. Classic background applications are the e-mail and fil downloading applications. Ow-
ing to different characteristics, particular traffi classes are handled by the QoS management
algorithms differently. For example, for the streaming and conversational data fl ws, certain
minimum throughputs and maximum delays may be guaranteed at the expense of background
and interactive ones. Moreover, the interactive traffi class has a higher scheduling precedence
than the background one. This means the background data fl ws have the least priority and

may only use resources when neither conversational nor streaming nor interactive applications
need them.
Definition of the other 3GPP Release 99 QoS parameters are presented in Table 11.3 [7].
Not all the attributes are relevant for all the traffi classes, that is the traffi handling priority
attribute is applicable only to the interactive traffi class while the transfer delay and the
guaranteed bit rate parameters are relevant only for the streaming and conversational traffi
classes. Moreover, the EGPRS Base Station Subsystem depends on whether and which of the
parameters are used in QoS management. Furthermore, some parameters, such as residual BER
or SDU error ratio, are characterized by limited tuning fl xibility [7]. In practice, only traffi
class, maximum bit rate, guaranteed bit rate (for streaming and conversational traffi classes
only), transfer delay, allocation/retention priority and traffi
handling priority (interactive
traffi class only) provide fl xibility in QoS profile parameterization.

11.2.2.1
Packet Flow Management
As already mentioned, in 3GPP Release 99, the concept of a BSS Packet Flow Context, known
as Packet Flow Management (PFM), was define
to improve QoS handling in 3G and 2G
networks. This mechanism allows exchange of the QoS information between an SGSN and a
BSS already at the stage of QoS negotiations (PDP context activation). Figure 11.5 shows the
message fl w of the PDP context activation in the 3GPP Release 99 scenario [6].
In the 3GPP Release 97 and Release 98 scenarios, detailed information about radio resource
occupation cannot be utilized by the AC since the PDP Context Activation procedure takes
place between the MS and the SGSN, and it is totally transparent to a BSS.
In the 3GPP Release 99 scenario, when both the network and the MS indicate their support
of the PFM, the information fl w is extended, that is having agreed the PDP context with a

GGSN, an SGSN starts the BSS PFC set-up procedures. To this end, it recalculates some QoS
parameters values (already accepted by the GGSN) to create the Aggregated BSS QoS Profil
Information Element which define the QoS requirements for the given Packet Flow Context.
Some parameters such as transfer delay must be recalculated since the BSS can guarantee QoS
only on the path between an MS and an SGSN – not across the whole delivery chain. An SGSN
assigns to the PFC the Packet Flow Identifie (PFI) according to the QoS parameter values
in the ABQP. Besides four predefine PFI values which correspond to signaling, SMS, TOM
(Tunneling of Messages) and best-effort (these four do not require the BSS PFC Procedure),
the PFI assignment algorithm is vendor-specific However, the idea is that PFC with identical or
similar requirements should get the same PFI. The ABQP information element complemented
with the Allocation/Retention Priority parameter is sent to the BSS in a Create BSS Packet
Flow Context Request message. Having checked during the Admission Control phase whether
the available resources satisfy the QoS requirements, the BSS replies to the SGSN with a
Create BSS Packet Flow Context Accept message. If the resources are insufficien to meet the
QoS requirements, the BSS might restrict the requested QoS parameter values. The agreed
QoS profil is then sent by the SGSN to the MS within the Activate PDP Context Accept
message. If the assigned QoS parameters are not acceptable to the mobile station, it may reject
the assigned PDP context [6].
The BSS PFC establishment procedure may be also triggered by a BSS being requested to
transfer a LLC PDU for which no BSS PFC is available. A BSS will then trigger an SGSN
(by sending the Download BSS Packet Flow Context Request message) to create a new BSS
PFC and provide the required ABQP information element. The BSS PFC may be modifie
during its lifetime, for example if an earlier agreed QoS profil can no longer be sustained by
the BSS. Finally, the BSS PFC may be deleted by an SGSN via the Delete BSS PFC Request
message when for example the related PDP context is closed. In the case of UL TBF, the
Packet Flow Timer (sent to the BSS together with the ABQP in the Create BSS Packet Flow
Context Request) define how long a PFC shall be stored in a BSS after the transmission of
the last UL LLC frame.
A single mobile station may have several BSS PFCs created. They are stored in a BSS in the
form of BSS Context. The logical relation between BSS Context and BSS PFCs is depicted in
Figure 11.6. The PFC of a given MS can be assigned to one (MS1 PFI 15) or more applications
(MS2 PFI 16) using the same PDP Context. On the other hand, the same PFI can be associated
with more than one MS (PFI 20) if the users perceive the same quality. Note that PFM impacts
transmission not only on the Gb but also on the Abis and radio interface.
The information stored in the BSS Contexts allows QoS differentiation on two different
levels:
r between mobile stations, for example in the case of congestion, the performance of an MS
with the lower priority PFC may be degraded prior to a performance deterioration of an MS
with a PFC of higher priority;
r between PFCs of one mobile station, for example being aware of the number of active fl ws
and being able to distinguish between them, a BSS can share the available radio resources
in an optimum way (where the streaming and conversational PFCs will be preferred).
The packet fl w schedulers, being vendor-specifi solutions, are usually based on more or less
complex variations of the Weighted Round Robin scheduling algorithms. To enable a BSS

to schedule a particular LLC PDUs with proper priority, a BSS must be provided with the
information on the QoS profil of all the PDUs. In 3GPP Release 97 and Release 98, this
information, in the form of a QoS IE containing a subset of QoS parameters, is sent in each
DL/UL-UNITDATA message (the BSSGP layer message containing LLC PDU) exchanged
between an SGSN and a BSS. In the case of 3GPP Release 99, since all the QoS parameters
are, in general, available in the BSS before the LLC PDUs appear, there is only a need to link
the content of the UNITDATA message with the stored ABQP. This is realized with the help of
the Packet Flow Indicator which is included in the UNIDATA message body as a new Release
99 Information Element.
Introduction of the Packet Flow Management functionality in 3GPP Release 99 also im-
proved the performance of the Gb fl w control algorithm, which aims to adjust the speed of
transmission of DL LLC PDUs from the SGSN towards the BSS.
This can be used to limit the data rate in order to avoid BSS buffers’ overfl w and guarantee
minimum data loss in case of cell reselection, or it can increase the data rate to guarantee a
smooth transmission without delays and avoid the situation that BSS has nothing to transmit
on the radio interface while data is kept in SGSN. The 3GPP Release 99 define two levels of
data transmission control between the SGSN and the BSS: cell1 and mobile station levels [12].
As long as a BSS can control data fl w transmission speed on the Gb interface to a resolution
of a whole cell only, few mobiles with poor radio performance could fil up the BSSGP Virtual
Connection (BVC) buffer, which in turn would force a slowdown in data transfer towards

between a PCU and a single cell.

all mobiles in this cell. Control and buffering on the MS level avoid this phenomenon and
decrease the total buffer size. Furthermore, 3GPP Release 5 has define the third level of the
Gb fl w control: the Packet Flow Control level. Analogously, this change prevents the buffer
in BSS dedicated to a given MS from being fille up by the data of the “slow” PFC with lower
priority. For example, if streaming and background PFCs are used in parallel by a single user,
preference on the air interface will be given to the streaming user. This may lead to protracted
storage time of the background PFC PDUs in the BSS buffer and consequently its potential
congestion. That is why it is better that the arrival rates of LLC PDUs of particular PFCs are
controlled by the BSS.
11.3
Admission Control
11.3.1
Primary Functionalities of the Admission Control
The aim of theQoS-awareAdmission Control (AC) is to calculatewhich network resources are
needed to satisfy the negotiatedQoS requirements, determine if these resources are available or
not and reserve these resources [6].With Admission Control, access to the network is granted
only if certain conditions related to satisfying the QoS requirements of the new Packet Flow
Contexts are met. Moreover, the Admission Control algorithm has to assure that there will
be no performance deterioration of the already established connections beyond the acceptable
limits set by their respective PFC. The AC checking may be performed not only during the PFC
creation but also due to the modificatio of a PFC or during a cell change. The efficien and
strict Admission Control functionality is one of the main differentiators between the legacy
“best effort” approach and the QoS-aware network management approach.
During the Admission Control process performed in the Packet Control Unit, availability of
the resources across the whole transmission path is estimated, where it is assessed whether the
radio interface, Abis interface, Gb interface associated with the PCU as well as PCU hardware
(including but not limiting to available processing power, buffer sizes etc.) are each capable
of handling a PFC. If the Admission Control fails, the creation or the modificatio of a PFC
is declined or queued or alternatively the Aggregate BSS QoS Profil (ABQP) profil may be
downgraded. Consequently, an efficien Quality of Service mechanism is always performing
a trade-off between the number of connections served by the network and provided quality of
the transmission. Performance of the Admission Control is presented in Section 11.5.
During the Admission Control phase, a detailed comparison has to be performed between
the capacity needed to satisfy the QoS requirements of the PFC and available PS capacity
[15]. In the case of the radio interface, the capacity figure could be define as the number
of radio blocks per second needed by the given ABQP and the number of radio blocks per
second available (where the maximum capacity of the single radio time slot would be 50 radio
blocks per second). The detailed procedure will depend on the QoS traffi class with the most
important differentiation being between non-real-time and real-time services. In the next two
sections, calculation of the needed and available capacity in the radio interface is presented
(given that the radio interface is usually the bottleneck of the whole transmission path [1]).
11.3.2
Calculation of the Available Capacity
The number of time slots that could be used to serve PS traffi is one of the major inputs into
the Admission Control and resource reservation algorithms. Generally, two types of radio time

352
GSM/EDGE
slot may be distinguished: time slots dedicated to PS traffic and shared time slots that can be
utilized by CS or PS traffic
The assessment of available capacity could be based on information about the current PS
load (e.g. the number of radio blocks used for all NRT and RT allocations across all the
available time slots), or in the case of RT services, it could be directly calculated from the
number of allocated resources. That way, temporarily inactive PFCs, that is the ones for which
there is no ongoing TBF, will also be included in the number of occupied resources.While the
inclusion of allocated RT resources improves the Admission Control performance, it could
unnecessarily increase the blocking rate of the new PFCs. Hence, one could assume a certain
overbooking might be allowed even for RT PFC. In this case, an appropriate trade-off in the
actual implementation would have to be found. To avoid unnecessary transmission breaks
caused by TBF establishment, longer TBF release times may be define for real-time services
(especially for conversational ones). Such an extension of a TBF lifetime could be achieved by
utilizing Delayed TBF Release and Extended UL TBF functionalities. Moreover, even when
transmission is not currently scheduled for a TBF, the necessary resources needed to satisfy
QoS requirements could be treated as occupied during the Admission Control phase.
When calculating available capacity, the signaling messages sent on the radio interface
that contribute to PACCH load (such as acknowledgements or packet assignments), should
also be taken into consideration [2]. They reduce the amount of resources available for data
transmission since PACCH is dynamically allocated (in both DL and UL direction) on the
same physical channel as the application data traffic
The active load, for example as measured by the scheduler algorithm, might not be sufficien
to determine the influenc of changes in traffi load and radio network conditions that may
affect the Abis interface as well as the radio interface occupancy in highly dynamic manner.
A sudden deterioration in interference in the network implies the use of lower coding schemes
or a higher number of retransmissions which will directly affect the achievable throughput
and may also negatively affect the delay factors. This will lead to an increase in the PS
resources’ occupancy time related to the given data volume which will result in a reduction
in the resources available for other PFCs. This phenomenon should be taken into account
with the application of carefully parameterized safety margins [15]. For example, a certain
number of radio blocks shared on a demand basis could be restricted to existing TBFs and not
made available for new TBFs. Moreover, in the calculations of the available capacity, an input
from Quality Control entity could be taken into account as well, that is whether the already
used resources for existing PFCs are indeed enough to satisfy their needs in terms of QoS
requirements. The detailed set-up may be tuned with different levels of risk depending on the
QoS traffi class [1].
11.3.3
Calculation of the Needed Capacity
In the assessment of needed capacity, for example for satisfying throughput or delay re-
quirements, the calculations used in the Admission Control algorithm may be non-trivial in
the sense that a main contributor might be the afore-mentioned dynamics in radio channel
conditions. For example, the interference situation in the network, multipath propagation,
constant changes in the load volume handled by the network etc. will all have an impact on
the needed capacity. One approach is to use reference factors that tie the expected or measured

Advanced Admission and Quality Control Techniques
353
interference situation in the network (e.g. in the single cell or the frequency layer, additionally
differentiated by frequency reuse factor [2]) to the achievable throughput per radio time slot
and delay values. The Link Adaptation restrictions (e.g. the set of available modulation and
coding schemes for the given MS) could be taken into account as well. Moreover, BLER values
could further limit the usage of certain coding schemes due to the delay requirements of the
ABQP. For details about Link Adaptation and BLER factors, please refer to Section 11.4.2.
Another approach could be based on analyzing the relationship between throughput or
delay requirements and resources needed for currently served PFCs, to predict the number of
resources needed for a new PFC. Such an analysis may be performed either among PFCs of a
given MS, or among PFCs of different MSs but having similar requirements.
Having estimated the throughput achievable per single radio time slot, the number of time
slots needed to satisfy the QoS requirements of the given PFC could be assessed by dividing
the requested guaranteed bit rate by the assessed time slot throughput. In this way, the needed
number of radio blocks per second for the particular PFC could be provided as well.
A novel approach to the capacity calculation could also be based on utilization of the DFCA
algorithm. Please refer to Section 11.3.5 for further details.
The use of the acknowledged or unacknowledged mode, determined according to the SDU
error ratio attribute, affects this assessment as well. For example, in the former case, the
potential retransmissions should also be included in the needed capacity calculation. When
using acknowledged mode, the RLC Non-Persistent Mode feature may be applied, especially
with conversational services where delay jitter should be avoided (for more details, see Chapter
2). Moreover, a mobile station’s capability, such as its level of (E)GPRS support (whether e.g.
it is EGPRS-2 capable or not), its multislot class, frequency bands the mobile could operate
in and support for complementary PS features, such as for example Downlink Dual Carrier,
have to be considered as well.
The guaranteed bit rate is foremost a requirement of real-time Packet Flow Contexts.
However, it might also be beneficia to introduce a minimum bit rate threshold for nonreal-
time services. The network would then try to maintain at least this minimum bit rate for non-
real-time services (e.g. 1 radio block per second for the given TBF related to NRT PFC) in
order to assure general PS service availability. This could be beneficia especially formobiles
that do not fully support QoS functionalities.
11.3.4
Multiplexing of the Resources
The PS radio resources may be shared by more than one TBF and more than one PFC. This
fact directly influence the throughput calculations since the time slot capacity must be shared
in such a case [2]. Certain restrictions related to the maximum number of TBFs/PFCs that
utilize the same radio resources may be applied in order to reduce the transfer delay caused
by multiplexing, even if the throughput requirements were met.
The channel allocation algorithm should aim to distribute the PS traffi evenly among the
resources in order to minimize the average number of TBFs per PDCH, assuming the CS
load volume allows for such a strategy. Taking into account bursty traffi generated by some
services, it might be beneficia to multiplex, for example streaming with background services
to utilize the common radio resources during the silence period of the TBF related to the
streaming class [1]. Such a policy could be justifie especially during the PS traffi peak. It

354
GSM/EDGE
should be also noted that due to statistical multiplexing gain [2], it is usually beneficia from
the throughput point of view to assign the highest possible number of time slots for the MS
(taking into account the split between DL and UL time slots and related limitations) even if
the multiplexing factor were higher in this case. A certain trade-off between the throughput
and delay constraints will have to be found.
The afore-mentioned multiplexing phenomena could affect achievable throughput for certain
TBF/PFC in amore severeway ifPDCHsare shared between mobileswith different capabilities
in terms of supported modulation schemes. In order to grant to the mobile the chance for
UL transmission, an appropriate Uplink State Flag has to be sent in the downlink direction,
unless a fi ed allocationmethod is used. If this fla
is dedicated to a GPRSmobile station,
the downlink block within which USF is sent has to be GMSK modulated. This fact directly
influences for example the EGPRS DL bit rate if the GPRS and EGPRS TBFs are multiplexed
onto the single PDCH. If USF GRANULARITY is set to 1 for uplink TBF (so-called USF
Granularity 4 functionality), theUSF fla grants transmission for four successive blocks in the
given time slot instead of one. Although in this case the impact of multiplexing is limited,
this phenomenon should be taken into account during the Admission Control process. The
problem becomes even more severe for EGPRS2 services, the performance of which could
be significantl limited when multiplexing with legacy mobiles, especially GPRS mobiles. It
should be noted that while USF Granularity 4 is an effective way of preventing DL throughput
degradation, it negatively affects the performance of scheduling in the UL direction since it
reduces the fl xibility of the scheduler (four free consecutive radio blocks have to be found in
order to grant the transmission turn).

PRS ones is presented at various EGPRS2A penetration figure (assuming there is no policy

regarding routing of EGPRS and EGPRS2A to different radio resources). It can be seen that
the higher the EGPRS penetration, the lower the mean EGPRS2A throughput. When the ratio
of EGPRS2A to EGPRS mobiles is increased, the throughput as perceived by EGPRS mobiles
can be seen to also increase.
This phenomenon could be observed since the resources’ occupancy time for transmitting
certain amount of data is lower for EGPRS2 than for EGPRS MSs. Hence, the freed resources
could be utilized for EGPRS transmission. The simulations were performed for 1/3 frequency
reuse pattern and for a heavy loaded network. USF Granularity 4 was applied.
Generally, one should avoid allocating MSs with different capabilities to the same radio
resources. Moreover, it is likely to happen that only some part of the hardware resources
in the radio access network (e.g. TRXs) are capable of transmitting and receiving in for
example EGPRS- 2 mode. It is then reasonable to prevent (up to the certain extent) the
allocation of GPRS or EGPRS connections to such TRXs. The policy with respect to applying
such limitations should also be aligned with mobile station penetration figure related to the
support of the given technology (like, e.g. EGPRS level).
11.3.5
Channel Allocation
Once the information about needed and available capacity is available, the Admission Control,
together with the channel allocation algorithm, can search for the most applicable allocation
so that an even distribution of the load across the time slots is achieved. Moreover. use
of dedicated resources instead of shared ones [16] may be of special interest especially for
demanding, real-time conversational services, since dedicated resources could not be occupied
or pre-empted by the CS traffi in any case. Furthermore, scheduling weights that reflec the
relative priority of the PFC in the scheduling phase could be taken into account during the
allocation process in order to fin best the possible resources for the new PFC. For further
details, refer to Section 11.4.1.
The simplifie example of used and free capacity assessment for the single TRX on a radio
block basis together with a safety margin applied is presented in Figure 11.8. Unless Downlink
Dual Carrier functionality is employed, it is not allowed to extend the allocation beyond one
TRX. In the example provided, a new PFC could be admitted in the system since the assessed
needed capacity is lower than the free capacity.
Usage of the Extended Dynamic Allocation2 (EDA) deteriorates the scheduler fl xibility in
UL direction and hence should be taken into account during Admission Control and channel
allocation procedures, especially for UL RT allocations. This potential deterioration could be
caused by:
r a short break (of the length of one UL transmission turn) as a result of decreasing the number
of scheduled slots for UL (applicable to mobiles that are unable to monitor the assigned
USF in the DL PDCH corresponding to the lowest numbered uplink PDCH of the shortened
scheduled allocation [10], as depicted in Figure 11.9);
2 In Extended Dynamic Allocation, a USF fla grants transmission on the time slot on which the USF was received
and all higher numbered time slots belonging to the UL allocation.

r the fact that among the scheduled slots for EDA, the one with the highest number is always
included;
r UL PACCH signaling load related to DL TBF that limits the EDA usage in UL.
Moreover, it has to be taken into account that all PACCH messages in DL are transmitted
on the PDCH corresponding to lowest numbered time slot in the UL EDA assignment. If
the Shifted USF feature [10, 11] is employed, PDCH which corresponds to second lowest
numbered time slot in the UL assignment is used instead. These limitations should also
be taken into account in the Admission Control process since it affects the signaling load
distribution. In the case of concurrent TBF allocation, however, PACCH messages could be
transmitted by the network on any of the common time slot in the DL/UL assignment.

Another limitation that has to be considered in the capacity assessment is the UL power
reduction for multislotULallocation applied not only according to the used modulation scheme
and frequency band but also due to MS Multislot Power Profil (in order to avoid possible
overheating in the transmitting circuitry [3]). However, in some cases use of Extended Dynamic
Allocation instead of Dynamic Allocation could be the only way to ensure that requested UL
throughput demanding QoS requirements are met.
Even if most PS applications have a asymmetrical DL-oriented character, it is essential that
both directions (DL and UL) should be evaluated jointly during Admission Control phase and
a new PFC should be admitted only if it passes both UL and DL requirements.
If Admission Control grants access to the network, the PS resources may be reserved at once
even if TBF is not yet created. Such a shift from common TBF-oriented to PFC-oriented allo-
cation policy is not necessary for the non-real-time services but improves the probability that
real-time PFC will be handled properly. If immediate PS resources “pre-allocation” are used,
this has to take place across the whole delivery chain in order to make this solution fully reliable.
It is clear that the Admission Control algorithm is very closely connected with the channel
allocation process (being a part of RRM) and in fact, in the QoS-aware network it is not
possible to treat these two algorithms independently [6]. The DFCA algorithm usability for
the Admission Control and QoS differentiation could be here especially marked. With the help
of the DFCA, it is possible (as presented in detail in Chapter 10) to fin the radio channel
allocation that meets a given service quality requirement (both CS and PS) and at the same time
minimizes any impact to the already established connections. The PS service differentiation
could be performed taking into account the respective Packet Flow Contexts [1]. Moreover,
the control in interference level experienced by a particular user could be tuned according to
different QoS needs. More precisely, one of the targets of the QoS-aware DFCA algorithm
could be, for example to ensure high and constant CIR levels for the streaming connections
while for the non-real-time services the CIR levels could be compromised. In such a way,
real-time PFC requirements with respect to throughput or delay could be met even in a highly
loaded network.
If it finall
happens that there are no resources available for establishing a new PFC,
the Admission Control procedure may trigger pre-emption procedures related to the already
established PFC depending on, for example QoS traffi class and priorities (e.g. THP together
with ARP) in order to grant access for higher priority PFCs [1] or alternatively the renegotiation
of QoS profil could take place.
11.3.6
Admission Control during PFC Runtime
An efficien Admission Control also plays an important role during Packet Switched Handover
or Network Controlled Cell Reselection (NCCR) procedures. The NCCR functionality can be
seen as an intermediate step between the conventional mobile-based cell reselection and PS
handover. With the help of PS Handover or NCCR, it is possible to undertake efficien PS
load management. Performance of such a management could be further improved by means of
carefully configure Admission Control process. Before triggering a cell change (or handover),
it could be checked whether a new fl w in the target cell would satisfy the QoS requirements
and simultaneously that the performance of the already active PFCs will not be affected in the
target cell. For details about PS Handover and NCCR functionality, refer to Sections 11.4.3.1
and 11.6.2 respectively.

358
GSM/EDGE
Another aspect that has to be considered in the Admission Control phase is the priority that
is normally given in the GSM networks to CS traffic It could be reflected for example in the
handling of shared PS/CS time slots where CS traffi takes precedence over packet allocations
and under heavy voice load may downgrade the number of PS time slots. The reorientation of
this policy may be considered during QoS introduction in the network. It might be reasonable to
avoid downgrading if the quality of the established PFCs were affected and there are no means
of reallocating them. Such a strict policy against CS-triggered pre-emption of PS resources
could be applicable only for some PFCs, for example for the real-time conversational ones.
11.4
Quality Control
11.4.1
Scheduler
The introduction of an Admission Control network is to ensure that certain QoS requirements
related to Packet Flow Contexts can be met. Hence the scheduler, which is responsible for
handling the transmission turns for the different Packet Flow Contexts, needs also to be
QoSaware. The scheduling algorithm takes into account distribution of TBFs across the
available PDCHs. In the downlink direction, the scheduler needs to be PFC-oriented (rather
than TBoriented), since more than one PFC could be handled within one TBF, as depicted in
Figure 11.10 (the Multiple TBF feature is assumed not employed here).
The BSS can control the DL data transfer for a given MS on a PFC basis via the Gb interface
by utilizing the PFC Flow Control functionality (see Section 11.2.2.1). Moreover, data fl ws
related to non-real-time PFCs could be restricted if there is a risk that a real-time PFC would
not satisfy its QoS requirements.
An exemplary utilization of the Multiple TBF feature is depicted in Figure 11.11. Support
for the Multiple TBF functionality is essential, especially if different RLC modes are required
for various TBFs related to a single MS.
In the uplink direction, the scheduler is responsible only for distributing the permissions to
access the physical radio resource on a TBF basis. Moreover, sequence of TBFs may utilize
the same PFC in both DL and UL directions.

The scheduler has to prioritize the blocks according to the QoS class related to the given
Packet Flow Contexts and simultaneously utilize the capacity left after satisfying the guaran-
teed bit rate requirements in the most efficien way. This could be performed while handling in
a reasonable way the multiplexing effects described in the Section 11.3.4 as part of Admission
Control and by utilizing an efficien polling algorithm to minimize the influenc on the actual
traffi performance. For the non-real-time services that are without throughput and delay re-
quirements, the scheduling weights need to reflec the relative priority of the various PFCs and
could be assigned according to, for example traffi class, ARP, traffi handling priority, etc.
In the case of real-time services, the scheduling weights should be derived firs and foremost
from throughput and delay requirements. This process could be handled in a similar way as
for the calculation of needed capacity during the Admission Control phase (refer to Section
11.3.3). These weights could be used, for example in a defici round robin [15] algorithm
implemented in the scheduler where each PFC is served in a cyclic way and the serving time
is assigned according to each of the PFC’s traffi needs. PFCs are not handled in a uniform
way (as in the simplest round robin scheduling algorithm), instead a certain prioritization is
applied according to ABQP. The scheduler should prioritize blocks corresponding to real-time
services. However, in order to leave room for non-real-time services during the scheduling
phase, a minimum bit rate (to be understood as a non-binding target to be achieved) may also
be introduced. This could even be essential, especially when the same resources (e.g. time
slots) are shared between non-real-time and real-time services. It should be also noted that the
scheduler has to respect the maximum bit rate limits set by the PFC, and the PFC throughput
should not exceed the guaranteed limit unless it will not affect the performance of the other
PFCs (including NRT ones). In the firs iteration of the scheduling algorithm, real-time related
TBFs could be given transmission turns while in the second iteration, non-real-time TBFs
could be included (as long as there is any residual capacity left after the firs phase).
An example of handling three different TBFs in a scheduler: one RT and two NRTs is
given in Figure 11.12. In this example, the residual capacity left after assigning transmission
turns for the RT and NRT services is shared among the three TBFs according to their relative
weights (e.g. three times more radio blocks are assigned to TBF3 compared to the TBF2).
Radio blocks allocated as a safety margin could also be utilized by both the RT and NRT
scheduler.

In general, the RT service performance should be preserved by the Quality Control func-
tionality, even in highly loaded network conditions as depicted in Figure 11.13, where, during
congestion, the RT services have been protected at the expense of delaying the packets related
to non-real-time services. If there were no QoS functionality in the network, then all services
could be negatively impacted.
Moreover, higher scheduling weights for the signaling in downlink could be assigned than
for the traffi channels, for example when a Packet Uplink Ack/Nack message has to be sent
and an UL radio block has to be assigned for polling purposes. The same rule is also applicable
in uplink for example when a polling response is needed.
11.4.2
Link Adaptation
Among the various other mechanisms that help to maintain an acceptable quality of service, the
Link Adaptation procedure can also be considered a part of QoS-aware network management.

This algorithm needs to be carefully parameterized to ensure not only the maximum possible
throughput under changing radio conditions but also to satisfy the delay requirements as
well. Usage of Incremental Redundancy is clearly favored in terms of throughput when less
robust coding schemes are used, even in imperfect radio conditions, but simultaneously in
such circumstances, multiple retransmissions may lead to degradation in the transfer delay
[1]. In Figure 11.14, the throughput performance of MCS6 and MCS9 is shown both with

and without Incremental Redundancy together with their BLER performance. The boundary
of when a deterioration in throughput or delay factor is acceptable is determined by the QoS
requirements of the particular Packet Flow Context. Hence, the optimum Link Adaptation
algorithm may be different for different QoS profiles For reasons of simplicity, two EGPRS
coding schemes are shown in Figure 11.14. Assuming ideal Link Adaptation with Incremental
Redundancy enabled, the switching point A may be applied to change between coding schemes
for the case where only throughput maximization is desired. Switching point B may be used
where certain delay requirements have to be met, leading to a limitation in the BLER (in this
case to 10%) during the transmission. For acknowledged mode, the transfer delay parameter
from the ABQP could be mapped to acceptable BLER limits. If Incremental Redundancy is
not enabled, switching points C and D for the cases without delay requirements and with
some BLER constraints may be applied respectively. Note that in case of unacknowledged
mode where Incremental Redundancy is not applicable, BLER limitations could be calculated
according to the SDU error ratio – the more stringent the requirement, the lower the acceptable
BLER.
The presented BLER could be computed as follows:
BLER = 1 −
Ncorrect blocks
Nneeded transmissions
Ncorrect−blocks is the number of RLC data blocks received correctly in the given period
and Nneeded−transmissions is the number of transmissions needed for correct reception. The
general formula for BLER calculation is also valid for the cases where Incremental Redundancy
is used.
11.4.3
Load Balancing
To prevent a degradation to PS service quality, it is often beneficia to balance the PS load:
between the time slots inside a given TRX; between TRXs within the cell and (if possible)
between the cells. This is not always possible during the Admission Control and resource
reservation phase, which is why a mechanism performing some periodical checking and
distributing of the load may be required. Reallocation of the PS services may also be required,
for example to optimize the throughput of the non-real-time services. Hence, the use of
Network Controlled Cell Reselection or Packet Switched Handover may be beneficia or in
some cases essential. Moreover, Network Controlled Cell Reselection in conjunction with
Network Assisted Cell Change can decrease the outage time during cell change, and hence
can improve the quality and performance of the service as perceived by the end user [2]. PS
Handover can reduce this outage even further. The NCCR feature is described in more detail
in Section 11.4.3.1. Further information on the NACC and PS Handover functionalities is also
provided in Sections11.6.1 and 11.6.2 respectively.
It is also beneficia to compress the CS allocation in the shared resources as much as possible
unless it deteriorates quality of CS calls. Such a policy, which will result in a CS and PS traffi
split [1], provides additional room for PS load balancing and helps in admitting more users
during the Admission Control phase. Due to certain limitations introduced by a mobile’s
multislot class, contiguous PS allocation across the time slots is usually preferred. Moreover,

Advanced Admission and Quality Control Techniques
363
it should be emphasized that unless the PS Handover feature is utilized in the network, it is
usually easier and more efficien to move the CS calls, for example to other radio cells with
the help of load-based handovers, rather than reallocate PS traffic Furthermore, prioritization
of certain layers (either BCCH or non-BCCH [13]) for PS traffi may be beneficia as well.
11.4.3.1
Network Control Cell Reselection
A cell reselection procedure allows a mobile station to change cell either in standby or in
ready state. In the standby state (when an MS is GPRS attached but has no radio resources
allocated for packet transfer and thus is in packet idle mode), the cell reselection is performed
autonomously by the MS – so-called mobile controlled cell re-selection. However, in the
ready state (when packet transfer is ongoing or has just ended but the ready timer has not
yet expired), the cell reselection can be initiated either by the MS or by the network. In the
latter case, the network orders the MS to send measurement reports, commands the MS to
change cell and also decides to which cell the MS shall change. This mode is supported when
the Network Controlled Cell Reselection functionality is enabled in the network.When the
network makes the decision to trigger a cell reselection, it sends a Packet Cell Change Order
message to force the MS to switch to another cell. There might be several criteria evaluated
by the Network Controlled Cell Reselection algorithm that triggers a cell change and selects
the target cell for the cell change. For instance, a power budget criterion, which is based on
measurement reports containing information about the carrier level of the serving and adjacent
cells, might trigger the MS to make cell reselection towards a cell with a lower path loss.
Furthermore, by means of the budget criterion, some neighboring cells or layers (e.g. a less
interfered 1800 MHz layer) can be made more attractive to an MS in packet transfer mode than
to an MS in GMM idle mode. Neighbor cell capabilities can also be considered to determine
a cell’s attractiveness, for example the NCCR algorithm could force an EGPRS MSs to select
an EGPRS capable cell and keep the GPRS only MSs in a non-EGPRS capable cell in order to
minimize allocation of MSs with different capabilities on the same radio resources. As another
criterion, the load situation in the serving and neighboring cells can be taken into account by
the network to trigger a cell reselection. In such a case, the network may try to move the MSs
in packet transfer mode from the overloaded cell to a neighboring cell that offers acceptable
radio conditions and has enough free resources to accommodate the additional traffic
Normally, in networks without any QoS management, the channel allocation algorithm
allocates packet data channels as long as there are available resources in the cell. This may lead
to a situation where some cells are congested, while their neighboring cells are not. Network
controlled cell reselection due to traffi reasons is, in principle very similar to handover due to
traffi reasons in the CS domain and can optimize the use of hardware resources and thereby
boost the network capacity.
The basic idea of load balancing is outlined in Figure 11.15. When a certain load in the
cell is exceeded that is the PS traffi
in the cell exceeds a predefine
threshold (THR1)
reflectin the percentage of busy PS resources, the terminals in the serving cell involved in
data transmission can be subjected to a reallocation to a neighboring cell. The goal of the
algorithm is to decrease the PS channel utilization below a value define by another threshold
(THR2). Only neighboring cells that have enough free PS capacity, that is their load is below a
certain threshold (THR3) can be considered as target cells for reselection due to traffi reasons.

PS load balancing based on NCCR.
More complex algorithms based on real-time and non-real-time traffi load and cell capacity
information may estimate the actual load level that every candidate cell would reach if it is
selected as the target cell for a particular ongoing PS connection. Of course, the target cells
considered by the load balancing algorithm need also to fulfil the criteria relating tominimum
radio conditions. These are determined based on for example measurement reports sent to the
network by theMS. There might be several different implementations as regards the procedure
for the selection of terminals to be transferred to the neighboring cells. Some basic solutions are
based on releasing the load of the serving cell by forcing a certain number of connections to be
transferred to neighboring cells according to the power budget criteria. Some more advanced
solutions are aware of the QoS profil of the ongoing PFCs. For instance, the terminals having
PFCs established for a low delay-sensitive service class, such as, for example background,
can be moved firs to the neighboring cells. If this does not help to decrease the load to below
the target level, the MSs with high QoS connections may become candidates for transfer to
adjacent cells in the second step.
The Network Controlled Cell Reselection may also be triggered by a Quality Control
function as a result of a QoS degradation as described in Section 11.4.4.
11.4.4
Countermeasures against Quality Degradation
Due to dynamics in the radio system such as the interference situation in the network or
the influenc
of other factors such as possible hardware failures or CS traffi
peaks that
could degrade the PS traffi performance, the quality of the transmission has to be monitored
constantly against the negotiated QoS. The Quality Control mechanism may then attempt
to maintain connection quality by detecting degradation in service quality and reacting to

Advanced Admission and Quality Control Techniques
365
it. Quality Control is in fact responsible for addressing all these problems that could not be
addressed in an earlier phase, for example during the Admission Control or scheduling phase.
Quality Control (like Admission Control) should take care of all parts of the delivery chain,
since only then can it be reliable. However, when considering Quality Control, the radio
interface should be assumed to be the most critical part [1].
The Block Error Rate (BLER) of the TBF is one of the most critical performance indicators,
for example BLER of an ongoing TBF could fall below a certain threshold even if the signal
level is relatively high (for details of BLER calculations, refer to Section 11.4.2). Delay values
can be assessed in an indirect way, for example with the help of constant BLER monitoring. In
some cases, it is the variance of delay that is of interest and not the delay as such. Throughput
as perceived by the user also has to be constantly controlled and a certain interaction with the
scheduling algorithm may needed to be detected, for example a degradation in throughput.
In the DL, throughput should be monitored in the BSS domain to ensure it does not drop
below the guaranteed bit rate or actual incoming throughput from SGSN (if it is lower than
the guaranteed bit rate [15]). For the UL, the situation is not as straightforward since the
incoming throughput is not known by the network (actually only the UL PFC is known). For
this reason, a throughput lower than the guaranteed bit rate does not necessarily mean there are
bandwidth limitations across the delivery chain. An unacceptable degradation could therefore
be detected, for example by comparing available throughput related to the UL PFC on the
radio interface (assessed with the help of BLER evaluation and throughput recalculation for the
particular coding scheme) and UL PFC throughput measured on the Gb interface. Assuming
the radio interface is the bottleneck, then if these two throughput values are equal and lower
than guaranteed bit rate, then it can be assumed the available bit rate in the UL is insufficient
On the other hand, if the available throughput is higher than the throughput on the Gb interface,
it could be assumed the QoS parameters are satisfied Other factors could be monitored as
well, such as the mean bit rate per radio block (to determine the actual quality of the TBF
which could be compared against the theoretical radio block capacity), or information about
signal strength, etc.
If Quality Control faces a degradation in the bit rate or delay factors for one or more of the
Packet Flow Contexts, then there are many possible countermeasures that can be applied, such
as:
r reallocation of the TBF into different resources (e.g. TRX);
r network-controlled cell reselection and Inter-System NCCR;
r PS Handover together with Inter-System PS Handover;
r renegotiation of the QoS (including downgrading of the QoS traffi class, e.g. from streaming
to interactive);
r dropping the PFC(s) (if there are no ways of ensuring that QoS requirements could be
satisfied)
During the corrective actions performed by the Quality Control, the Admission Control func-
tionality should also be utilized in order to assess the influenc of allocating a PFC on a
different resource.
It is evident that even though the Admission Control and Quality Control functions are
distinct parts of the QoS-aware network, they should also be designed to be complementary
to each other.

Performance of the QoS-aware GERAN Networks
A QoS-aware GERAN network controls the access to the resources by taking into account the
QoS requirements of the incoming Packet Flow Context and all other Packet Flow Contexts that
have already been established according to the rules presented in the previous subsections. This
section presents system-level simulations that have been performed to show the performance
of the typical QoS-aware RRM algorithms including Admission Control and Quality Control
procedures in various network scenarios. To simplify the analysis, a regular network without
CS traffi was simulated and only the downlink direction was taken into account. A hopping
layer with 1/1 frequency reuse pattern (2 TRXs/cell in 900-MHz band) was analyzed.
To show the performance of QoS service differentiation procedures, the following three
services were simulated in various network load conditions:
r H.263 video streaming based on real-time streaming class;
r WWW service based on non-real-time interactive class;
r FTP download based on non-real-time background class.
The guaranteed bit rate for the streaming service was set to 64 kbit/s – sufficien for the
considered application. Two different scenarios were analyzed. In the first an even distribution
of the service penetration across the users was assumed. In the second scenario, the proportion
of background, interactive and streaming application users was set to 1:1:3. Net session
throughput was calculated as the mean quotient of the received data to the time where MS
has a TBF (or the TBF was in the establishment phase). Figure 11.16 shows that even in a

highly loaded network, the mean throughput for the admitted streaming Packet Flow Contexts
does not degrade below the guaranteed bit rate. The performance of the streaming service
is sustained at the expense of a throughput deterioration experienced by the non-real-time
users. Furthermore, the performance degradation for the background service can be seen to
be significantl worse as a result of being handled with a lower priority than the interactive
service. The influenc of the network load on delay values is presented in Figure 11.17, where
mean gross LLC frame delay is shown. It is define as the time difference between storing
an LLC frame in the PCU buffer and its correct reception by the MS. The lowest delay is
perceived by the streaming application being served with the highest preference. Furthermore,
the delay degradation with increased traffi load is barely visible for the streaming class while
the delay values of the non-real-time services deteriorate significantl . The background service
handled by the network with lowest priority suffers most from higher delay degradation when
compared to the interactive one.
Moreover, it can be seen that the performance of the non-real-time services degrades more
(in terms of both throughput and delay) for the scenario where the streaming application
contributed more to the total offered load (1:1:3 vs. 1:1:1). This reflect the inherent behaviour
of a QoS-aware network that prioritizes the real-time PFCs over non-real-time ones.
In Figures 11.18 and 11.19, the performance of the streaming service in a non-QoS-aware
network is shown. It can be seen that without QoS management, the network is unable to
provide satisfactory performance to the application even at moderate offered loads. One of
the reasons for this phenomenon is the lack of AC and QC functionalities. Furthermore, in
QoS-aware networks, the PFC throughput cannot exceed the guaranteed one if it affects the

performance of other PFCs. In non-QoS-aware networks, there is no such mechanism and
hence, higher throughputs and lower delays may be possible but only at low offered loads.
To achieve the expected network performance in terms of throughput and delay values,
efficien Admission Control and Quality Control mechanisms are needed. Moreover, there is
a clear relationship between the probability of blocking caused by the Admission Control and
the probability of dropping or degradation performed by Quality Control. Prior to dropping or
degradation, other countermeasures such as reallocation may be triggered by the QC. In the
case of streaming services, degradation means that the PFC is downgraded to an interactive
one. The actual Admission Control algorithm may be tuned according to different strategies.
If the Admission Control is strict, the probability of service degradation or dropping during
PFC runtime is lower. This could be achieved, for example with the help of applying certain
safety margins. On the other hand, the number of admitted users is lower in comparison with
more relaxed approaches towards Admission Control tuning. The effect of three different AC
parameterization strategies in case of streaming services is depicted in Figure 11.20. Case
1 corresponds to the least strict AC parameterization, while in case 3 the most stringent
approach was applied. The results were obtained for a heavy loaded network where the effect
of Admission Control and Quality Control performance is especially visible.
The presented simulation results show that QoS-aware RRM is needed in order to achieve
efficien service differentiation and to guarantee satisfactory performance for real-time appli-
cations in GERAN. Therefore modern, more advanced services may be offered by GSM
operators. At the same time, the trade-off between quality and capacity should also be
considered.

Enhanced GERAN Performance towards Conversational Services
Although the conversational traffi class is define in 3GPP Release 99, its support in Release
99 compliant GERAN networks failed to materialize as a result of performance limitations in
the GERAN to serve the most demanding real-time applications. The main issues were: too
high transfer delay and round- trip time (RTT) as well as too long service interruption times
and too high packet loss rate resulting from cell change procedures. Therefore, some further
enhancements on the radio and Gb interfaces were needed to enable support of conversational
traffi class in GERAN. The conversational applications require one-way end-to-end transfer
delays in the range of 150 ms to 200 ms and packet loss of about 1–3%. However, delays
ranging between 300 ms and 500 ms could still be considered as acceptable [14,17]. Aiming
to meet conversational traffi class requirements, a number of features have been introduced
by 3GPP to improve performance in GERAN. In 3GPP Release 4, two new features were
introduced, namely Extended UL TBF and Network Assisted Cell Change (NACC). With
Extended UL TBF, an UL Temporary Block Flow may be kept active during short inactivity
periods (when there is no data to be transferred). The analogous functionality in the downlink
direction is called Delayed DL TBF Release, which was introduced in 3GPP Release 97.
Extended UL TBF is intended to shorten both one-way end-to-end delays and RTTs by
avoiding unnecessary TBF releases and establishments. With this feature, the end-to-end
delay for IP audio packets may be shortened to between 320 ms and 370 ms. Detailed studies
on the Extended UL TBF feature may be found in [14]. The NACC feature was introduced
to improve cell change mechanisms and shorten service outage time during this procedure.
Further details on this feature may be found in Section 11.6.1. However, service interruption
times offered by GERAN in Gb mode with the NACC mechanism, although improved, are
still unacceptable for conversational traffi class. In order to avoid Gb mode limitations and
support conversational class services in GERAN, the Iu-mode for GERAN was standardized
in 3GPP Release 5. The Iu-PS interface connects the 2G BSS to the 3G core network via
3G SGSN. With this architecture, GERAN subscribers can be offered the same services as
UTRAN ones. This solution, however, requires Iu-mode capable mobile stations.
To further reduce the service outage time during cell change in GERAN Gb mode and
to enable real-time services with stringent delay requirements, the PS handover feature was
introduced in the 3GPP Release 6. The PS handover is intended to improve the performance of
the cell change procedure by reusing the CS handover principle, that is by allocating resources
to a mobile station in a target cell before a mobile station is moved to that cell. Although
the PS handover is intended for real-time services, especially conversational traffi class, it is
applicable to all PS services offered by GERAN Gb mode. Further details on the PS handover
functionality can be found in Section 11.6.2.
3GPP Release 7 brought further enhancements aiming to improve QoS in EGPRS networks.
Besides features such as Downlink Dual Carrier, EGPRS2 and MSRD, aimed at increasing
the user perceived throughput (see Chapter 2 for further details), a set of latency-reducing
mechanisms have been designed, namely: Reduced Transmission Time Interval (RTTI), RLC
Non-Persistent Mode, Fast Ack/Nack Reporting and TBF pre-allocation [17]. In Reduced
Transmission Time Interval, the transmit time of the single radio block is reduced from
20 ms to 10 ms by transmitting four bursts (comprising one radio block) in parallel onto two
different time slots and hence using only two consecutive TDMA frames. By halving the
transmission time, a significan reduction is provided in delay and round-trip time. In Fast

Advanced Admission and Quality Control Techniques
371
Ack/Nack Reporting, the bandwidth needed for feedback messages (Packet Uplink/Downlink
Ack/Nack) is minimized to allow frequent acknowledgements reporting. This is realized by
a very short Piggy-backed Ack/Nack report embedded in a normal RLC data block instead
of typical PUAN/PDAN messages in dedicated radio blocks. In RLC Non-Persistent Mode,
delays are reduced compared to typical acknowledged mode of operation, especially in severe
radio conditions. With RLC acknowledged mode, correctly received data blocks cannot be
relayed to the upper layer until all preceding ones have been successfully retransmitted. In
RLC nonpersistent mode, if a configurabl timer expires, the non-correctly received blocks
are replaced with dummy information bits and together with all subsequent correctly received
ones are forwarded to the upper layer. A detailed description of the RTTI, FANR and RLC
NPM features can be found in Chapter 2. In TBF pre-allocation, a TBF may be established
before the user data is ready for transmission and kept open by the network via the Extended
UL TBF feature. Thanks to TBF pre-allocation, the TBF set-up time is removed from the
service initial access time. The combination of all the delay and latency-reducing features
enables GERAN to fulfil the QoS requirements of the most demanding real-time services and
to support all the traffi classes, define in the 3GPP Release 99, including the conversational
one.
11.6.1
Network Assisted Cell Change
It has already been mentioned that the “conventional” cell reselection algorithm is unsuitable
for services that require seamless cell change operation, such as real-time services. This is
because “conventional” cell reselection is performed by the terminal without notificatio to
the network. Furthermore, the mobile cannot make a random access to restart the data transfer
in the new cell until a consistent set of system information for that cell has been correctly
received. In other words, an MS that performs cell reselection must firs acquire a define
minimum set of (P)SI in the target cell before resuming the TBF in the new cell. The service
interruption time that arises during cell reselection is therefore dependent on how quickly the
MS can acquire the minimum set of system information in the new cell. This procedure can
take a couple of seconds, which makes “conventional” cell reselection unsuitable for the more
delay-sensitive service classes like, for example streaming.
To support these services in GERAN, enhancements to the existing cell change mechanism
are necessary. To this end, the Network Assisted Cell Change feature was introduced in 3GPP
Release 4 for MSs, performing cell changes between cells belonging to the same BSC. The
feature can reduce the service outage time for an MS in packet transfer mode from a couple
of seconds down to even below one second by giving the network the possibility of assisting
an MS before and during the cell change. The assistance is given both by the sending of
neighboring cell system information and with introduction of new procedures that will be
briefl
described in the later part of this section.3 The NACC feature introduced in 3GPP

GSM/EDGE
Release 4 covers only the case of intra-BSC cell reselection. In order to support NACC in
the case of inter-BSC cell changes, the RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol was
introduced in 3GPP Release 5. The task for RIM in the context of the NACC feature is to
support the retrieval of the relevant system information data of cells managed by neighboring
BSCs and to provide this information for the NACC supported cell change procedure [4,12].
The principle of the Network Assisted Cell Change feature is tominimize the service outage
time for all QoS traffi classes when an MS in packet transfer mode moves between GSM
cells. The outage time reduction is achieved by giving the network the possibility to assist
an MS before and during cell reselection.4 As mentioned before, there are two independent
mechanisms specifie for NACC.
The first called Neighbor Cell System Information Distribution, allows the network to assist
an MS by providing the neighboring cell system information required for initial access after a
cell change. This information is sent to the mobile station on the PACCH in the source cell. An
MS in packet transfer mode that receives this information stores it for 30 seconds. It may then
use this information when accessing a target cell and hence avoid scanning the BCCH channel
for the necessary system information. Having switched to a new cell, the MS may directly
initiate the access procedure via RACH and then ask for the missing system information on
the PACCH by using the Packet SI Status procedures.
The second mechanism provides the network with the means to order mobiles of 3GPP
Release 4 or later to enter so-called Cell Change Notificatio (CCN) mode before reselecting a
cell. In CCN mode, an MS notifie the network about when cell reselection criteria are fulfille
and delays the execution of cell reselection so that the network can respond with neighbor cell
system information. Having entered the CCN mode (Figure 11.21 depicts the message fl w
in CCN mode), the MS informs the network with a Packet Cell Change Notificatio (PCCN)
message that it wants to change a cell. After sending the message to the network, the mobile
station continues the ongoing packet transfer for either a maximum time of about 1 second or
until the network responds with a Packet Cell Change Continue or Packet Cell Change Order
message. The Packet Cell Change Order message might be sent to indicate a different target
cell from the one proposed by the mobile station (e.g. when the target cell proposed by MS is
in a congestion status), or the Packet Cell Change Continue message might be sent to force
the MS to continue the cell reselection procedure to the target cell proposed by the MS. Upon
reception of the PCCN message, the network may send the required system information about
the proposed or any other cell selected by the network in a Packet Neighbor Cell Data message
to allow the MS to perform an immediate initial access in the target cell when the re-selection
has been performed.
By providing (P)SI information on the target cell still on a dedicated link in the source cell,
the service interruption time due to cell reselection can be significantl reduced. There are
a few different performance indicators providing information about the service interruption
time caused by the cell reselection. Figure 11.22 shows one of them, namely Data Outage

Note that in case of inter-RA cell change, the service interruption times may get longer owing
to the RAU procedure during which an application data transfer is not possible.
As depicted in Figure 11.22, the NACC feature can significantl reduce the data outage
time arising from the cell change procedure compared to “conventional” cell reselections.
Consequently, more delay-sensitive applications, like streaming ones, may be enabled in
GERAN. However, to meet the delay requirements of conversational-like services, the service
interruption times during cell change procedures need to be further reduced.

11.6.2
PS Handover
The key QoS requirements of conversational class services are those related to latency aspects
and hence the main network prerequisites for supporting such services, besides low transfer
delays, are fast and efficien cell change mechanisms. The NACC feature already allows a
reduction in data outage time during a cell change procedure to a minimum of 300 ms for
uplink and 900 ms for downlink, depending on network configuration This is still insufficien
for the conversational traffi class where the maximum acceptable service time needs to be
about 150–200 ms. Thus, to shorten the service outage time further during cell reselection,
Packet Switched Handover for GERAN A/Gb mode was introduced in 3GPP Release 6.
Although introduction of this feature was driven by real-time services, it is applicable to all
types of PS applications. PS Handover improves the performance of the packet cell reselection
procedure towards the performance of circuit-switched handover by allocating resources in the
target cell before the mobile station leaves the old cell. New mechanisms supporting handover
of BSS Packet Flow Context between source and target cells have also been introduced on
the Gb interface. In this case, new BSSGP signalling messages that carry information related
to BSS PFC being handed over, including corresponding QoS profiles have been defined
The PS Handover functionality also provides mechanisms for data forwarding which reduce
packet losses during a cell change.
The PS Handover procedure can move an MS with one or more packet fl ws from a source
cell to a target cell, where the source and target cells can be located either within the same
BSS (Intra-BSS HO), between different BSSs within the same SGSN (Intra-SGSN HO), or be-
tween different SGSNs (Inter-SGSN HO), or even between different radio access technologies

Advanced Admission and Quality Control Techniques
375
(Inter-RAT HO). In the case of the PS Handover, the whole cell change procedure is controlled
by the network, with the decision about whether and towards which cell a terminal should be
handed over being based on for example measurement reports received from a mobile station.
Before an MS is ordered to change cell, the network needs to reserve the appropriate resources
in a target cell and depending on whether a target cell belongs to the same or different BSS
or SGSN, then the network may involve different procedures in the HO preparation phase
[9]. The exemplary message fl w for the intra-SGSN inter-BSS PS Handover procedure is
depicted in Figure 11.23.

GSM/EDGE
As soon as radio resources in a target cell are allocated, the mobile station is commanded
to make a cell change (PS Handover Command message), where the network provides the
MS with a description of the allocated resources and with the system information needed for
access in a target cell. The provisioning of part of the target cell system information before
the cell change allows the mobile station to access the assigned resources without having to
perform the signaling phase on common control channels. This significantl reduces service
outage time (in the order of couple of seconds compared to legacy cell change procedure). On
receiving the PS Handover Command message, the mobile station acknowledges its correct
reception to the network (if polled by BSS) and switches to the target cell. Having accessed
the allocated resources in the target cell, the mobile station is able to receive downlink data.
In the case of inter-BSS handovers, the SGSN can start the downlink packets forwarding both
to a source and a target BSS as soon as radio resources are reserved in the target BSS. This
packet forwarding functionality, known also as SGSN bi-casting, is also possible in case of
inter-SGSN handovers. Thanks to this functionality, the service outage time may be shortened.
To further reduce the interruption time in downlink, a so-called “blind” transmission has
been introduced. This feature, which is applicable only to services using unacknowledged
LLC and RLC mode, allows the target BSS to transmit downlink LLC PDUs in the target
cell without having to wait for a confirmatio
that the mobile station has switched to the
assigned resources successfully (e.g. by receiving the firs normal burst containing an UL
LLC PDUs). When the terminal notifie its presence in the target cell, downlink packets
are redirected by the SGSN only to the target BSS and the resources in a source cell are
released.
The service outage time in uplink direction depends on whether the network is synchronized
(where timing advance information about the target cell can be provided to a mobile station
before leaving a source cell) or non-synchronized (where the timing advance information about
the target cell is unknown prior to handover). In the non-synchronized case, the mobile station
having accessed the allocated resources in a target cell, needs to obtain valid timing advance
information from the BSS by sending on the assigned PDCH a PS Handover Access message
formatted as four access bursts. Upon receiving this message, the BSS replies with a Packet
Physical Information message containing the timing advance information. Once the mobile
station obtains a valid timing advance, it can transmit normal bursts. In the synchronized case,
the request for timing advance information may be skipped since it is already provided in
an old cell. If the mobile station fails to receive all system information relating to the target
cell before leaving the source cell, it must collect the missing information before higher-layer
(e.g. GMM or SNDCP) data transfer is started in a new cell. A mobile station requests this
remaining system information by sending a Packet (P)SI Status message to the BSS. Once
the missing system information is received, the transfer of upper-layer data can be started.
Prior to the application data transfer, a Cell Update or Routing Area Update Request (in
the case of an inter-RA handover) must be sent by a mobile station. Having transmitted
such a request, the mobile stationmay start the user data transfer. As opposed to the non-PS
Handover scenario, uplink and downlink user data transfer may continue during the RAU
procedure and is suspended only when signaling messages must be transmitted by the GMM
layer.
Furthermore, GMM signaling requires RLC acknowledged mode, while for user data trans-
fer, to reduce the delay, unacknowledged mode may be used on both RLC and LLC lay-
ers. Without the Multiple-TBF feature (allowing an MS to have more than one TBF active

Advanced Admission and Quality Control Techniques
377
simultaneously), the RLC mode would in this case need to be changed from unacknowledged
to acknowledged mode. This means the ongoing TBF must be released and a new one estab-
lished which would lead to an impact on the service interruption time. Considering that in case
of an ongoing the DL TBF, an UL TBF establishment may only be requested when sending a
DL TBF polling response, the service outage time would be dependent on downlink polling
algorithm.
In the following system-level simulation results [18], PS handover performance (Figure
11.23) is given in terms of service interruption time for a conversational type of application
(VoIP). The used network simulator modelled all of the relevant details affecting the service
outage time starting from the physical layer up to radio access network and core network level
(cell deployment, frequency reuse, mobility, Routing Area Update, etc.). A simple model of
VoIP speech is used as the traffi model (where the data frame is generated every 20 ms,
the size of the frame is matched to the predefine bit rate of 8kb/s and the call arrival rate
is 5 calls/hour/terminal). Only one time slot in UL and one time slot in DL were allocated
to a mobile station having an active call. No multiplexing was allowed, so only one mobile
is allocated on each time slot. Extended UL TBF mode and Delayed DL TBF Release were
applied, but not Multiple-TBF. The service outage time is measured at LLC layer. To measure
the most significan delay that may occur during PS Handover, two different definition were
used depending on whether the intra-RA or inter-RA scenario was analyzed. In the case of
intra-RA PS handover, the largest service interruption time occurs when switching between
the source and the target cells and this was define as the period between the reception of
the last correct LLC data block in the old cell and the reception of the firs correct LLC
data block in the new cell. In the case of inter-RA PS handover, the most significan service
outage time is when GMM signaling messages are transmitted in the target cell and this
was define
as the time between the reception of the last LLC data block before the firs
mobility management message is sent and the reception of the firs LLC data block after
the mobility management message is received. The firs GMM message is the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST in uplink and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT in
downlink.
The service interruption time introduced by PS handover on the LLC layer for downlink
and uplink LLC frames for the intra-RA scenario is depicted in Figure 11.24.
When SGSN bi-casting is enabled, the typical service interruption time is about 20–60 ms in
downlink and 60–80 ms in uplink. These service interruption times are significantl improved
over those introduced by the NACC procedures and fully satisfy the delay requirements of
conversational traffi class services. The presented results are for a synchronized network
scenario with SGSN bi-casting enabled. Without SGSN bi-casting, the outage time in the
downlink might extend to 80–140 ms for the synchronized network and 120–180 ms for the
non-synchronized network, while uplink service interruption times in the non-synchronized
network extend to 80–120 ms [18].
The service interruption time introduced by Routing Area Update procedures on the LLC
layer for downlink and uplink LLC frames for the case of inter-RA PS handover is depicted
in Figure 11.25.
In the case of an inter-RA PS handover, the service interruption times are longer when
compared to the intra-RA scenario and are about 400 ms in downlink and 700 ms in uplink. This
is caused by the need to change to RLC acknowledged mode to send the GMM message. The
presented results for uplink were obtained with a polling algorithm optimized for fast uplink

TBF re-establishment. These service interruption times are not sufficien for the conversational
traffi class services, even though they represent a significan improvement compared to the
inter-RA cell reselection procedures even with the NACC feature (where typical outage time
is in the order of few seconds). To reduce inter-RA PS handover service interruption times
to acceptable levels for conversational traffi class services, the Multiple-TBF feature which
avoids a TBF mode change for GMM signaling transfer is necessary [18].
The results show that the PS Handover feature can reduce the service interruption time
significantl compared to a pre-Release 6 GERAN A/Gb mode cell change mechanism. For
this reason, the introduction of PS Handover functionality is a major step towards support of
the conversational traffi class services in GERAN networks.

Introduction
In this chapter, we introduce some of the proprietary solutions that are available to improve
the performance and capacity of a GSM/EDGE network.
First in 12.2, we describe Progressive Power Control, a technique that enhances power
control in AMR by adapting the thresholds that govern it resulting in lower interference and
a reduced dropped call rate. Then in 12.3 we describe Temporary Overpower, a technique
that targets the associated control channels in order to increase retainability in the network.
Retainability is also enhanced by minimising the size of the signalling commands at call
set-up and during handover. This is described in 12.4. Other optimizations are also described
in 12.5 for the Radio Link Timeout parameter, in 12.6 on the criteria for performing intra-cell
handovers and in 12.7 on service dependent channel allocation based on a multiple frequency
reuse scheme.
Finally in 12.8, proprietary solutions to the GERAN transport system are described, namely
efficien IP transport techniques that contribute to savings in terms of bandwidth and cost.
Different migration paths for GERAN transport evolution are also outlined.
12.2
Progressive Power Control for AMR
Progressive Power Control (PPC) is a technique that improves both the quality and capacity
of an AMR network by minimizing the use of high transmission power, while at the same
time maximizing the use of the high bit-rate codec modes. PPC can also be used to address
the imbalance in quality between the control and AMR traffi channels.
In this section, we provide an overview of the PPC technique and provide an evaluation of
its gains with the help of system level simulations and laboratory test measurements.

Introduction
Power Control (PC) reduces interference in a network by adjusting transmission power levels
based on radio link measurements. For example, PC might be used to optimize the transmission
power in order to maintain the signal level such that a quality criterion for the connection is
only just met. In [1], GSM power control is studied together with DTX in a variety of network
configuration and it is clearly evident that PC improves network performance both with or
without DTX or frequency hopping.
When applied to GSM voice, power control algorithms are commonly based on thresholds
to the reported RxQual and RxLev parameters.
For example, high and low RxQual thresholds are often used to defin a “target” RxQual
(corresponding to a value between the high and low thresholds). Provided the maximum or
minimum transmission power is not exceeded, the quality of a connection is kept to within the
target quality criterion.
AMR link adaptation adapts the codec mode according to a signal quality criterion and
as a consequence, the AMR codec mode usage should correlate to the targetted RxQual. For
example, Figure 12.1 shows an example of AMR codec mode usage versus RxQual, based on
results obtained from a test measurement (whose set-up is described below). When RxQual
exceeds 4, the most robust AMR mode (AFS 4.75) is used; AFS 5.9 is used when RxQual is
within the range 2 to 4, and the higher speech bit rates (AFS 7.4 and AFS 12.2) are used in the
case of best two quality classes. In this configuration a target RxQual in excess of 4 would
push the AMR codec to the most robust modes, while a target RxQual less than 2 would favor
the high bit-rate codec modes.
Progressive Power Control provides added fl xibility to the basic power control method.
This fl xibility can be used to maximize the potential gains of AMR. Connections that use
the highest power levels cause interference other users hence, from a system performance
point of view, it is better to push the connections in poor radio conditions towards the robust

modes of AMR, instead of increasing the transmission power to the highest levels. On the
other hand, connections in very good radio conditions should be allowed to achieve maximum
voice quality by using the highest speech bit rate modes because the highest power levels
are not required. With PPC, this is done by adapting the RxQual thresholds in the power
control algorithm. For example in Figure 12.2, the high and low RxQual thresholds change
dynamically depending on the transmission power level. If high power is already in use, the
quality threshold is tightened. Thus, connections requiring the highest power levels are pushed
to the most robust modes of AMR. The target RxQual thresholds are then lowered, step by
step as a function of transmission power until users in good radio conditions are permitted to
use a transmission power level to achieve the highest quality speech.
PPC performance was studied using laboratory tests and system level simulations. The
laboratory test scenario in Figure 12.3 depicts a 2G network where an Abis protocol analyzer
and drive test tools collect appropriated log and traces from measurements results and where
a signal generator provides the interference source to emulate the CIR conditions that trigger
the power control algorithm thresholds.
The test case configuratio consisted of two TRXs and frequency hopping was disabled.
The reference PC RxQual thresholds were: AFS (4, 2) and AHS (2, 0), where the firs and
second number in the parenthesis corresponds to low and high quality thresholds respectively.
PPC adapted the thresholds in the AFS case from (6, 4) to (2, 0) and in the case of AHS from
(4, 2) to (2, 0). The AMR codec set consisted of the modes: AMR12.2, AMR7.4, AMR5.9
and AMR4.75 (except for the AMR12.2 mode, which is available only for AFS).

A dynamic, time-driven network level simulator for GSM/EDGE was utilized to evaluate
network level capacity and quality gains (further details about the simulator environment can
be found in Chapter 5). The simulated scenario was an irregular network in an interference
limited macro environment. The essential parameters of the simulation are in Table 12.1.
12.2.2
PPC Impact on Power Levels
Power level distributions change when PPC is applied such that high power transmissions
are avoided by adapting the RxQual thresholds that govern the power control mechanism.
Instead of powering up, the robust modes are used leading to a reduction in interference. Use
of maximum output power is expected to be less frequent than those ones observed in normal
power control schemes. Figure 12.4 shows the results of several campaigns of simulations
based on different PPC specifi parameter combinations. Points are vertically grouped for
a given Effective Frequency Load (EFL), where each point on the graph is the result of a
given simulation due to a combination of specifi PPC parameters and a given network load.
These simulations validate the type of behavior that affects the power level distribution and
the fina average output power transmissions. As shown in Figure 12.4, PPC resulted in less
transmission power, where an average power reduction of about 2 dB was achieveable in the
case of PPC with optimized parameters.
It is also interesting to consider the impact of PPC on the distribution of output power
levels. In this case, results were obtained from laboratory test trials and system simulations for
power level distributions in the MS and BTS respectively. Results are shown in Figure 12.5
and Figure 12.6.

In Figure 12.5, it is seen that with PPC there is less utilization of high power levels. With
normal PC, the highest peak of power transmission occurs with 10 dB attenuation (equivalent
to 5 PC steps) while with PPC it occurs with 14 dB attenuation (equivalent to 7 PC steps).
In Figure 12.6, it is seen that the peak in the maximum BTS TX power is significantl
reduced in case of PPC. Also, use of the lowest power levels is reduced, demonstrating PPC’s
capability to enable higher C/I ratios for connections in good radio conditions. These results
were collected from the system level simulations.
The above finding demonstrate that PPC can be used to reduce output power both in UL and
DL. However, any comparisons between UL and DL power distributions should be avoided in
this case since the results were from different studies.
12.2.3
PPC Impact on AMR Codec Modes
In practical terms, PPC improves cooperation between power control and AMR link adaptation
since AMR link adaptation will adapt to meet the RxQual thresholds while PPC has the main
objective of promoting the use of the most robust AMR codecs in poor radio conditions (before
trying to increase power transmission) and promoting the use of increased power transmission
in good radio conditions (before trying to use more robust modes). Given that the RxQual
thresholds for power control change based on transmission power level, the overall expectation
is to have a shift on AMR codec distribution promoting more use of the most robust mode and
the mode that provides the best quality from the configure codec set available for AFS and
AHS.
Figure 12.7 depicts AMR codec usage taken from the fiel trial measurements. The trail in
this case was from a high interference scenario and therefore useage of the most robust AMR

codec mode is relatively high. It can be seen that the use of the most robust mode is slightly
increased. Then, there is clear increment in the best two speech quality AMR codec modes.
This is a good example of the basic principle of PPC, how it can be used to push connections
to more robust modes, and, at the same time favor use of the highest codec mode in good radio
conditions.
12.2.4
Quality and Capacity Gains
This section depicts the potential capacity and performance gains obtained by progressive
power control. Network capacity and quality have been evaluated using DCR and FER (mea-
sured as bad quality FER samples) respectively. Since the goal is to reduce high power
transmission and thus overall interference, the benefit of PPC should also be evident on
FACCH and SACCH performance behavior. Specificall , a reduction in the drop call rate due
to the handover process and due to the radio failure perceived by radio link timeout is expected.
Figures 12.8 and 12.9 depict the DCR and FER performance for the real network simulation
scenario described in Section 12.2.1 when configure
for different combinations of PPC
parameter settings. Shown are the results obtained for the best and worse PPC settings and
for normal PC (shown for reference). For the best combination, a DCR quality gain of 19%
or a capacity gain of 12% was achieved (Figure 12.8). These gains were obtained due to a
reduction of interference derived from less utilization of maximum output power. The impact
to the AMR codec mode distribution resulted in an impact to the FER samples, where a slight
degradation can be seen for the best PPC settings (Figure 12.9). This demonstrates that the
PPC algorithm can be used to balance quality difference between control and traffi channels,
and same time increase network capacity.

Temporary Overpower1
In the past number of years, a series of voice quality and capacity enhancement features
have been introduced in narrowband deployments of GERAN (GSM/EDGE Radio Access
Networks) mobile radio networks such as the Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) speech codec.
Findings from fiel measurements have revealed that the Call Drop Rate (CDR) is the major
limiting factor even at medium load in networks exploiting AMR with tight frequency reuse,
due to excessive failures on the fast and slow associated control channels (FACCH/SACCH).
The reason for this phenomenon which is typically observed at Effective Frequency Loads
(EFLs) beyond 20%, is the significan physical layer performance imbalance of up to 6 dB in
terms of carrier to interference ratio (C/I) between the robust TCH/AFS4.75 / 5.90 kbps speech
codecs and the signaling channels. A novel strategy using temporary overpower on the control
channels was introduced as a practical and fully backwards compatible option to improve the
probability of successful decoding of the FACCH/SACCH frames. The evaluation of the novel
approach by system level simulations shows a significan soft capacity gain by substantially
reducing the CDR, enabling a system load above 30% EFL in homogeneous hexagonal
networks. The temporary overpower strategy is especially attractive when extremely high
network load situations temporarily occur.
In such conditions, a speech quality degradation down to a still acceptable level is often
tolerated when providing the required capacity during busy hours load peaks. Moreover, the
temporary overpower on FACCH/SACCH can be efficientl combined with the 3GPP Release
6 standardized features Repeated Downlink FACCH and Repeated SACCH.
12.3.1
Introduction
Originally in GSM the robustness of the signaling FACCH/SACCH channels was properly
designed to match the error protection schemes of the standard full-rate and half-rate speech
traffi channels (TCH/FS, TCH/HS). Signaling performance was sufficien to cope with the
interference levels in early GSM deployments utilizing standard or enhanced full-rate speech
(TCH/EFS) codecs even in tight 1/3 or 1/1 frequency reuse at a system load appropriate for
those codecs [2–6]. Under poor radio conditions connections were terminated due to perceived
bad speech quality by one of the parties before the call was dropped due to signaling errors
such as for example radio link timeout on SACCH.
The robustness of the GSM traffi channels has been substantially increased by the intro-
duction of AMR speech codecs capable of adapting the relative amount of speech and channel
coding to the prevailing radio conditions. Robust AMR codec modes in full-rate, for exam-
ple TCH/AFS4.75 and TCH/AFS5.90, provide sufficien speech quality even at very low C/I
levels.
Today’s state-of-the-art GERAN networks exploiting the robustness of AMR are deployed
in aggressive 1 × 1 frequency reuse, offering high capacity. Since the robustness of the control
channels FACCH and SACCH, in the following referred to as ACCH, has not been improved
until recently, the high interference levels in such types of networks substantially degrade the

signaling performance especially in downlink (DL). In the uplink (UL) direction interference
cancellation is used to improve also the performance of the signaling channels. While the
speech quality is still acceptable, important control information for timing advance, power
control (PC) and handover (HO) is not available. Even at reasonable speech quality provided
by TCH/AFS4.75 codec mode, both SACCH and FACCH show a significan block erasure
rate (BLER): radio link failure (RLF) is often observed due to successively bad decoding of
SACCH blocks. The HO command sent on FACCH does not reach the mobile station (MS)
in the serving cell. The physical layer information (containing the timing advance) sent on
DL FACCH does not reach the mobile station in the target cell. All those events are the main
reason for a dramatic increase in the number of dropped calls, limiting the network capacity
well below the soft capacity limit for TCH. The analysis of the call drop statistics in real
networks planned in tight reuse operated at medium to high fractional load also shows that the
vulnerability of ACCH is the limiting factor for the network capacity.
There are two approaches to address ACCH performance enhancements in DL:
1. By improving the error protection schemes for FACCH and SACCH, implying changes in
the 3GPP GERAN standard.
2. By improving the C/I on the ACCHs, applying temporarily higher transmission power on
FACCH and SACCH bursts.
Regarding the firs approach, the optional features called “Repeated Downlink FACCH”
and “Repeated SACCH” were define
in the 3GPP GERAN specification [6–8] for Re-
lease 6 compliant MS, capable of performing soft combining on two successively repeated
FACCH/SACCH blocks. The MS indicates the support of these features via the MS Classmark
3 (CM3) Information Element called Repeated ACCH Capability (1 bit field as define in [9].
This permits their early implementation for pre-Release 6 compliant MSs. The repeated DL
FACCH/SACCH procedure foresees a serial repetition of the FACCH/SACCH blocks. The
MS can then enhance its link performance by attempting a soft decision combining of the re-
peated FACCH/SACCH blocks. The performance requirements for repeated FACCH/SACCH
are define in [10] with a reference performance of FER ≤5%. According to link-level sim-
ulation results, the expected gain in decoding performance is about 3–5 dB. This link-level
improvement will reduce the number of lost FACCH/SACCH blocks and hence the number
of dropped calls due to failed handovers and RLF will be minimized. More information about
the Repeated Downlink FACCH and Repeated SACCH can be found in Chapter 7 on Control
Channel Performance.
Regarding the second approach, the performance in DL of both FACCH and SACCH has
been improved by introducing a novel strategy called Temporary Overpower (TOP). TOP
improves the C/I on FACCH/SACCH bursts by temporarily increasing their DL transmit
power with respect to the currently used power control level on speech bursts (on hopping
TRXs with Static Power Reduction (SPR)) by for example 2 or 4 dB for mobiles in very poor
radio conditions. As a result, the balance between TCH/AFS and ACCH link performance
can be re-established. Consequently the CDR can be reduced leading to a significan increase
in the GERAN network capacity for speech services. A particular benefi from the second
approach is its applicability to both legacy as well as 3GPP Release 6 compliant MS.

12.3.2
Dropped Calls in GERAN Networks
12.3.2.1
Overview
In real deployments, the network-initiated curtailment of a call may originate from various
reasons, for example radio interface failures, failures from HO, Abis interface, A interface,
user actions, failures in the Base Transceiver Station (BTS), Base Station Controller (BSC)
and at the mobile side. An MS malfunction has an especially strong impact on the measured
CDR in real networks. In this simulation study, only dropped calls related to failures on the
air interface are considered. Such failures are caused by excessive errors on the SACCH and
FACCH signaling channels, mainly due to high interference or insufficien signal level in
capacity and coverage limited scenarios, respectively. In the following, call drop performance
has been addressed for interference limited deployments based on the RLF criterion as define
in [11] as well as on HO failures encountered during HO execution.
12.3.2.2
Dropped Calls Due to Radio Link Failure
The objective of prematurely terminating the call by the radio access network is to remove
calls experiencing such a bad radio link quality that retaining the connection is useless.
Excessive errors on the air interface not only cause unacceptable speech quality but they also
may completely compromise the transmission of signaling messages required to maintain
the connection in a mobile environment. In GSM, the RLF criterion has been define as a
main trigger mechanism to drop speech calls suffering from excessive bad quality. The aim of
detecting an RLF in both the MS and BTS was to ensure that connections with unacceptable
speech quality, which cannot be improved either by RF power control or HO, are either released
or re-established in a define manner. The RLF criterion is based on the radio link counter S.
If the MS/BTS is unable to decode a SACCH message, S is decreased by one. In the case of
a successful reception of a SACCH message, S is increased by two. In any case, S shall not
exceed the value define by the parameter RADIO LINK TIMEOUT set in the data base, for
example at 24, and broadcast via SYS INFO messages. If S reaches zero, an RLF due to radio
link timeout is declared and the call is dropped.
12.3.2.3
Dropped Calls Due to HO Failures
HO is required to maintain a call in progress as the MS passes from one cell coverage area to
another and may also be employed to meet network management requirements, for example
for congestion relief. HO may occur during a call from one TCH to another TCH. It may also
occur from SDCCH to SDCCH or from SDCCH to TCH (directed retry) during the initial
signaling period at call set-up. The HO may be either from a channel on one cell to another
channel on a surrounding cell (Inter-Cell HO) or between channels on the same cell (Intra-Cell
HO). In general, the HO process comprises two phases [7]:
r HO decision: detecting the necessity of an Inter-Cell HO for an ongoing call based on several
criteria, for example quality, level, power budget, etc. as well as generating and evaluating
the target cell list, or the necessity of an Intra-Cell HO due to bad quality or for channel
mode adaptation reasons.

392
GSM/EDGE
r HO execution: requiring the exchange of signaling messages on FACCH to transmit the HO
or assignment (ASS) command to the MS and to perform the access on the new channel in
the target cell in case of Inter-Cell HO or on the new channel in the serving cell in case of
Intra-Cell HO.
12.3.2.4
Assignment and Handover Command Transmission
On a HO decision after receiving the ASS or HO command message from the BSC, the BTS
of the serving cell uses the FACCH on the TCH to send these messages to the MS over the air
interface. The HO command is a Layer-3 (L3) message with variable length depending on the
type of coding used. If the HO command is too long, it is segmented by LAPDm into multiple
L2 information (I)-frames with a payload of 20 bytes each. One I-frame is transmitted on the
air interface by L1 using one FACCH frame on the TCH. The ASS command occupies a single
I-frame. The FACCH steals one speech frame in the case of a full-rate (FR) or two speech
frames in the case of a half-rate (HR) channel. Since the LAPDm window size is limited
to one, the transmission of one segment must be acknowledged before the next one can be
transmitted. For this purpose the timer T200 and the counter N200 are used. When the BTS
transmits the firs burst of the FACCH frame, the BTS starts timer T200 and waits for the
acknowledgement frame from theMS, in this case the MS responds with a receive ready (RR)
frame on the UL FACCH. If the acknowledgement from the MS is not received within T200,
the FACCH is repeated and T200 restarted. The maximum number of FACCH repetitions
is controlled by the counter N200, a fi ed value of for example 34, specifie
by GSM for
FACCH FR. If the transmission of the firs or of a successive (if necessary) I-frame fails,
that is after N200 retransmissions the FACCH frame has still not been successfully decoded,
the BTS sends an error indication (ERR IND) message with cause “T200 expired (N200 +
1) times” to the BSC which releases the resources: a dropped call due to T200 expiry is the
result.
12.3.2.5
Access Procedure on the New Channel of the Target Cell
After successful reception of the HO command, the MS will access the target cell by trans-
mitting an unspecifie number of HO access bursts on the new traffi channel. At the time of
transmitting the firs HO access burst, the MS starts timer T3124. After receipt of a HO access
burst, the BTS starts transmitting the PHYS INFO message (a single I-frame) on FACCH to
the MS and starts timer T3105. If the MS correctly receives the PHYS INFO before T3124 has
expired, the MS stops T3124 and sends the Set Asynchronous Balance Mode (SABM) frame
on the UL FACCH to establish the L2 connection for the submission of the HO complete
message. If T3105 expires before the BTS receives the SABM frame, it repeats the PHYS
INFO FACCH and restarts T3105. The maximum number of FACCH repetitions is deter-
mined by the counter NY1. If the PHYS INFO is not correctly received before the expiry of
T3124 (which is fi ed at 320 ms), the MS returns to the old channel of the originating BTS,
sends a HO FAILURE message on the UL FACCH and tries to resume the connection. The
SABM frame has to be correctly acknowledged by an Unnumbered Acknowledgement (UA)
FACCH from the BTS. If the MS does not receive the UA frame, it retransmits the SABM.
The time between two UA retransmissions is 34 TDMA frames in case of FR speech and

Capacity Enhancements for GSM
393
the total number of transmissions is restricted to 5. If the UA frame is correctly received,
the MS will send the HO complete message which concludes the non-synchronized Inter-cell
HO execution procedure. If the MS was not able to correctly decode the UA frame (after it
has been transmitted 5 times as described above), the MS returns to the old channel of the
originating BTS, sends a HO FAILURE message on the UL FACCH and tries to resume the
connection.
Exactly the same procedure is accomplished in the case of Intra-Cell HO except that
the PHYS INFO message is omitted. In other words, after successful reception of the ASS
command, the MS transmits on the new channel the SABM frame on the UL FACCH to
establish the L2 connection for the submission of the ASS complete message. The latter has to
be correctly acknowledged by the BTS, using the UA frame on the DL FACCH. If the MS does
not receive the UA frame, it retransmits the SABM. The time between two UA retransmissions
is 34 TDMA frames in the case of FR speech and the total number of transmissions is
restricted to 5. If the UA frame is correctly received, the MS will send the ASS complete
message which concludes the Intra-Cell HO execution procedure. If the MS was not able to
correctly decode the UA frame (after it has been transmitted fi e times), the MS returns to

connection.

Performance Improvements on the Associated Control Channels
12.3.3.1
Temporary Overpower Strategy
Figure 12.10 shows the link-level performance of AMR TCH/AFS4.75, TCH/EFS, FACCH
and SACCH with ideal frequency hopping on a TU3 channel. When measured at the 1%
FER/BLER limit, there is a performance gap of around 6 dB between TCH/AFS4.75 and the
associated signaling channels. Recall that the latter have been properly designed to support
TCH/FS and TCH/EFS at C/I operating point of 8–10 dB with FER = 1%.
As mentioned above, one option to reduce the C/I gap and improve the probability of
successful decoding of the FACCH/SACCH frames at the MS side is to use TOP on these
channels in DL. Overpower is suggested to increase the C/I exclusively for particular radio
links suffering from poor radio conditions. Under normal radio conditions, both FACCH and
SACCH are transmitted using the current power settings due to PC for the TCH. In critical
radio conditions, however, based on a new trigger mechanism, FACCH and SACCH shall
be transmitted independently of each other with 2 dB or 4 dB higher power (overpower)
with respect to the currently used TCH transmission power level commanded by the DL PC
procedure. To avoid the adverse effect of permanent overpower on the interference level ex-
perienced on TCH channels, overpower on ACCH is only applied if the measured radio link
quality in DL of a particular radio link is below a certain bad quality threshold. For example,
if the averaged RXQUAL in DL reported by the mobile is worse than 6.5, corresponding
to a C/I of less than 4 dB. Note that according to Figure 12.10, TCH/AFS4.75 at C/I =
4 dB still provides sufficien speech quality with mean FER well below 1% whereas both
FACCH and SACCH show a BLER of about 30%. TOP requires a static power reduction
of the same amount on the TCH TRX providing headroom for the ACCH overpower. The
resulting fina transmission power is not allowed to exceed the maximum physical output
power of the TRX. That means, for example in the case of a static 2 dB power reduction

and exhausted PC, an overpower command of 4 dB leads to a maximum 2 dB fina power in-
crease. TOP is applicable in interference limited high capacity scenarios implying no coverage
limitations.
12.3.4
Network Simulation Model
To study the effect of TOP on the GERAN speech service performance in terms of capacity and
quality, system level simulations have been performed in a tight 1/1 frequency reuse scenario
with 3 + 3 + 3 up to 6 + 6 + 6 configuration (i.e. 3-sectored sites with 3 up to 6 TCH-TRX
per sector) depending on the offered cell load.
Table 12.2 gives an overview of the essential parameter settings used in the system simulation
model. An urban network deployment with slow moving subscribers (3 km/h) has been
assumed. A hexagonal cell layout with a site-to-site distance of 1500 m, a propagation index
of 3.76 and a slow fading standard deviation of 6 dB with correlation distance of 110 m have
been used. A narrowband scenario has been assumed with 5 MHz spectrum availability in
the 900 MHz frequency band. A BCCH planning in a typical 4/3 reuse results in 2.4 MHz
(12 frequencies) left for the hopping layer and one guard channel.
Both power budget (better cell) Inter-Cell HO with HO-margin of 3 dB between cells of
different sites (0 dB between cells on the same site) and HO due to quality with a quality
threshold of 2 dB are modeled very close to the real system implementation based on signal
level and quality measurements. Since in tight (1/1) reuse due to the high interference levels
on the serving TCH especially at high traffi load, the power budget HO is strongly delayed

causing dramatic degradation in signal quality, a HO due to quality is required to achieve
appropriate network performance. An Intra-Cell HO is initiated if in addition to the bad
quality (C/I < 2 dB), the measured received signal level exceeds −75 dBm.
Dropped calls resulting from decoding errors on FACCH and SACCH have been consid-
ered. For this purpose, the HO execution procedure including transmission of ASS and HO
commands, physical information and acknowledgements over FACCH along with the trans-
mission of power control and timing advance commands over SACCH have been modeled
according to Section 12.3.1. However, in the case of assignment and HO failure, the call is
deemed dropped instead of returning to the old channel. The Radio Link Timeout parameter
has been set to 24.
TOP is implemented assuming 4 dB static power reduction on the TCH-TRXs and applying
2 dB overpower on both FACCH and SACCH bursts for a call suffering from bad channel
quality (measured DL RXQUAL is worse than 6.5), and adding 2 dB more overpower whenever
FACCH retransmissions are required. Adjacent channel interference has been considered
assuming an adjacent channel protection factor of pessimistic 14 dB.
Since GPRS/EDGE and signaling channels in operational networks are mainly configure
on the BCCH carrier, only speech service capacity on the TCH-TRXs has been taken into

396
GSM/EDGE
account. Simulations have been performed for DL only since it has been assumed that the
DL is the limiting link due to interference cancellation technique introduced in UL. AMR
codec mode adaptation based on C/I thresholds comparison has been implemented close to
the real system, automatically switching between four AMR FR codec modes included in
the active codec set. Latency in the link adaptation as well as in the PC algorithm has been
modeled accurately. A mobile receiver with decent interference reference performance has
been selected while advanced receiver algorithms in DL like SAIC [13] or sophisticated radio
resource management [14] have not been taken into account. On the network side, TX diversity
obtained for example by antenna hopping has been switched off.
The speech quality in terms of FER is measured over a sampling period of 1.92 seconds
(i.e. 4 SACCH periods). The speech quality in the network is quantifie by the percentage
of speech samples with FER higher than a specifi threshold for example FERmax = 2.5%
(see Table 12.2). Since such speech samples indicate a bad speech quality, the probability of
their occurrence is termed bad quality probability (BQP). The network capacity is determined
by the EFL at which BQP does not exceed a certain threshold, for example 5% also called
outage probability. Correspondingly the EFL at the outage BQP is termed soft capacity limit.
Assuming that all eight time slots on a TRX are available for speech traffi using FR speech
codecs, EFL is given by [9]:
EFL[%] =
ErlBH
8 · Ntotalfreq
· 100[%],
where ErlBH is the busy hour served traffi in Erlangs and Ntotalfreq is the number of TCH
frequencies in the system (e.g. 12 according to Table 12.1).
12.3.5

12.3.5.1
Preserving AMR Capacity and Speech Quality
The EFL at which the speech quality in the network becomes unacceptable due to excessive
interference is referred to as the soft capacity or soft-blocking limit.
Speech quality is define in the network by BQP, where the speech quality in the network
is deemed satisfactory when the BQP is less than 5% for FERmax at 2.5%. Hence, the
BQP outage probability define a soft capacity limit allowing network operators to adjust the
QoS within a tolerable range according to their needs. In established high capacity GERAN
networks an outage probability of 5–10% is widely accepted in extremely high load traffi
situations emerging temporarily during busy hours.
Figure 12.11 depicts the trade-off between outage probability in terms of BQP and the
network soft capacity in terms of EFL for a high capacity GERAN network in a tight 1/1
re-use with 12 hopping frequencies (2.4 MHz bandwidth for TCH). Two scenarios have been
investigated: one without improvements on ACCH denoted in the legend by TOP-off, and
another one featuring the TOP strategy on ACCH denoted by TOP-on. Both scenarios have
been studied assuming a segmentation of the HO-command message into a single I-frame.
The BQP graph with TOP-on reveals a performance degradation at increasing system load
since calls which have been dropped in the TOP-off scenario due to excessive errors on
the signaling channels are now maintained contributing a significan portion of bad speech

samples. According to Figure 12.11, using TCH/AFS codecs with TOP, a soft capacity of 34%
and 40% EFL has been achieved at BQP outage of 5% and 7.5%, respectively. Note that with
maximum installed 6 TCH-TRX per cell (see Table 1) a system load beyond 40% EFL causes
a hard blocking of more than 2% (hard blocking of 2% is widely tolerated in matured mobile
networks).
12.3.5.2
Boosting GERAN Capacity by Call Drop Suppression
Considering a CDR of 2% as the upper limit for Grade of Service (GoS) widely accepted in
commercial networks, as shown in Figure 12.12, the maximum EFL supported in a network
without ACCH improvements (TOP-off) is about 24%. In other words, the network capacity
limit of almost 40% EFL at BQP outage of 5% depicted in Figure 12.11 (TOP-off) is captured
by the CDR due to bad ACCH performance.
The applied TOP strategy proves to be able to shift the capacity limitation due to CDR to
about 31% EFL harmonizing the GoS and QoS define in terms of BQP. This corresponds to
a network capacity gain of nearly 30% achieved by TOP.
It should be noted that the TOP strategy is an efficien solution for interference-limited
scenarios whereas the improvements based on the 3GPP standard are suitable for both in-
terference and coverage limited deployments. A combination of both strategies provides an
additive gain, not presented in this study.
The impact of the second I-frame (in case of HO-command segmentation) on the CDR is
in the range of 1–2% EFL. However, it should be noted that with increasing users’ speed, the

effect of the delay caused by the second I-frame leads to a higher probability of losing the
HO-command and consequently to a dropped call.
12.3.5.3
Impact of Radio Link Timeout and Handover Failure on Call Drop Rate
The main contributors to dropped calls on the radio interface are Radio Link Timeout (RLT) on
SACCH and failures during HO execution on FACCH. The comparison of the results for the
scenario TOP-off shown in Figure 12.13 clearly reveals FACCH failures to be the dominant
contributor to dropped calls observed in highly loaded GERAN networks in tight 1/1 reuse
accounting for about 90% of the total CDR. For example, at 25% EFL, the CDR due to RLT
in a network without TOP is 0.1–0.2%, which is about 10% of the total CDR of 2% according
to Figure 12.13 for the same scenario.
The overwhelming impact of failed FACCH transmissions on the CDR is even more visible
in terms of CDR per terminated call, see Figure 12.14. While RLFs account for less than 1%
of the dropped calls even at the highest load, the CDR due to failures on FACCH observed
during Intra-Cell HO execution exponentially increases with system load. This phenomenon
is explained by the dramatic growth in the number of Intra-Cell HO due to bad quality as the
interference level in the network increases (see Figure 12.15).
TOP proves to be an appropriate technique to substantially reduce the number of lost calls
caused by unsuccessful FACCH delivery. While the number of Intra-Cell HO per call is almost
doubled with TOP (see Figure 12.15) the CDR per terminated call is almost halved by TOP
(see Figure 12.14).

Detailed Spatial BQP and CDR Analysis
To get a better insight into the relationship between BQP and CDR, an interference limited
GERAN network in tight 1/1 reuse has been traced at a very high traffi load of 40% EFL
without TOP.
Figure 12.16 shows a snapshot of MSs experiencing a certain FER over a sampling interval
of 1.92 seconds. MS locations are differently blackened according to the measured FER: error
free, 1%, 2%, from 2% to 5% and above 5%. Figure 12.17 shows both the MS locations
of successfully completed (END OF SESSION) and dropped calls collected over the entire
simulation run distinguishing between the various dropping causes: RLT (RADIO LINK
TIMEOUT DL), T200 expiry (T200 EXPIRY) and HO failures due to T3124 expiry (HO
FAILURE T3124 EXPIRY) and UA failures (HO FAILURE UA). In both figure the serving
cell is located at coordinates (0.0; 0.0) km with antenna main lobe pointing in x-direction. The
cell radius is 500 m. Two of the dominant inter-site interfering cells belong to the site located
at coordinates (1.5; 0.0) km. The other two dominant interfering signals are radiated by cells
of different neighbor sites located at the top and bottom of the displayed area (1.0, ±0.87)
respectively. The effect of slow fading on the serving cell area is clearly visible. There are MS
locations found far away from the serving site.
As shown in Figure 12.16, mobiles contributing to BQP (FER > 2%) are predominantly
located at the cell border. Locations marked by circles and squares amount to roughly 10%
related to 7.5% BQP at 40% EFL, referring to Figure 12.11. According to Figure 12.17,
mobiles suffering from a dropped call are also predominantly located at the cell border. This
proves the strong correlation between bad link quality and call drop. Obviously the portion of
calls dropped due to failed HO is overwhelming, as already illustrated in Figure 12.13.

Summary
Field measurements in high capacity GERAN deployments in 1/1 reuse reveal dropped calls
to be the major factor limiting the EFL to well below 30% at 2% CDR. This fact has been con-
firme in this simulation study. Speech quality in those networks is still acceptable for EFL of
up to 40%, assuming BQP outage of up to 5% while failures on the signaling channels limit the
network capacity down to 24% EFL. To improve performance, a novel temporary overpower
technique for the control channels FACCH and SACCH has been implemented in interference-
limited scenarios. This technique can be interpreted as a separate/independent quality-based
PC for signaling and traffi channels.Aprerequisite for this approach is a static power reduction
of the base station transceivers in the range of 2 dB to 4 dB. The simulation results reveal that
the TOP strategy is the proper answer to the call drop issue, boosting GERAN AMR speech
service capacity beyond 30% EFL in homogeneous deployments without coverage limitation.
In particular, TOP supports both legacy and 3GPP Release 6 compliant handsets, providing an
additive capacity gain for the latter in combination with the 3GPP optional features Repeated
DL FACCH and Repeated SACCH.
12.4
Handover Signaling Optimization
In Chapter 7, it has been demonstrated that the HO success rate (and consequently the CDR)
will be proportional to number of I-frames required to convey the layer 3 (L3) HO-command
message. Likewise, the size of the L3 ASS-command (which is used during the TCH assign-
ment phase at call set-up and during intracell HO) will have an effect on the call set-up success
rate and the intracell handover success rate (and consequently the CDR). For these reasons, a
number of techniques have been employed used by BSC developers to reduce the size of the
ASS-command and HO-command messages.
One such technique is to minimise the size of the coding for the frequency list (which is
often a significan contributor the size of these messages). For example, if the hopping pattern
consists of a “block-wise” frequency allocation (where frequencies assigned in the hopping
pattern are directly adjacent to each other), an optimium coding strategy might be to use a
variable bitmap to code the frequency list. This method can support up to 32 frequencies in
one FACCH block (consisting of 20 bytes of L3 payload). Hence the BSC can restrict the size
of the Information Element (IE) according to the size of the frequency list instead of using a
fi ed length of 16 bytes, which is typically used. The principle of a “bitmap” is that each bit
position represents a particular frequency within the frequency list. If a bit is set to “1”, then
the frequency represented by this bit position is included in the list of hopping frequencies.
Another technqiue used by BSC developers to reduce the HO/ASS-command message size
is to remove Information Elements which are redundant for a given scenario. In 3GPP TS
44.018, the Information Elements that comprise the HO and ASS-command messages are
described. During channel allocation (or handover), the frequency list often constitutes a large
part of the HO and ASS-command when the number of hopping frequencies is large. In 3GPP
TS 44.018 it states that the HO and ASS-command should include one of the IEs listed below:
r Frequency Channel Sequence (10 octets).
r Frequency list (4–131 octets).
r Frequency Short List (10 octets).
r Mobile Allocation (3–10 octets).

Capacity Enhancements for GSM
403
Each IE has certain restrictions on when and howthey may be used. For example, the Frequency
Channel Sequence IE may be used only if all frequencies are within the P-GSM band, while
if the Mobile Allocation IE is present, the 17 octet Cell Channel Description IE should also
be present.
In a system with a 1/1 frequency reuse, the number of hopping frequencies is typically
large and the allocation is often identical between neighboring cells. Consequently, a lot of
signaling is wasted by repeating the same frequency allocation over and over again.
A simple but efficien reduction of the ASS/HO command message size employed by some
BSC manufacturers is to make the above-mentioned IEs optional in the message. If none of
the IEs are present, the MS will assume the same hopping frequency allocation as in the old
cell. For a BSC that uses a Mobile Allocation IE together with a Cell Channel Description
IE in the HO/ASS command, the removal of the Cell Channel Description IE which consists
of 17 octets, means with a high probability that the message length can be reduced by one I
frame. This significantl speeds up handover and TCH assignment and improves performance
in terms of call set-up and HO success rate – leading to a reduction in the call drop rate.
The technique of HO command and ASS command message length reduction has been
trialled in a real network and the results of the trial showed a significan performance im-
provement brought by these HO signaling optimization techniques. In the reference scenario
(AMR network with 1/1 reuse and 16 consecutive hopping frequencies in the MA list), the
ASScommand and HO-command messages were typically 37 bytes in length. After enabling
HO signaling optimization, this was reduced to about 20 bytes. This reduced the number of I
frames required to convey these L3 messages from 2 frames to a single frame. The technique
had a significan impact on retainability: CDR at EFL of 15% was reduced by 25% as shown
in Figure 12.18 and both ASS command and HO command message length reductions con-
tributed to this retainability improvement. Drops during intercell HO at an EFL of 15% were
reduced by 37% as depicted in Figure 12.19, while during intracell HO at an EFL of 15%, a
performance gain of 39% was seen as depicted in Figure 12.20.

Separate Radio Link Timeout Value for AMR
The purpose of Radio Link Timeout (RLT) is to control a forced release so that the forced call
release does not occur until the call has degraded to a quality beyond which the majority of
subscribers would have manually released the call (this is described in more detail in 12.3.2).
Given that AMR calls are more robust than EFR calls and provide acceptable speech quality
at much lower C/I ratios, the specificatio of a common RLT value for AMR and non AMR
calls may cause the AMR calls to be unnecessarily dropped. For this reason, separate RLT
thresholds for AMR and non-AMR calls have been investigated. The finding indicate that
the RLT threshold for AMR should be at a much higher value than for EFR. Trials in a real
network with AMR penetration of 70% have shown that when the RLT threshold is increased
by more than 50% (e.g. from 20 for EFR to 36 for AMR), the overall CDR was reduced by
25% (Figure 12.23), while keeping the speech quality at the acceptable level (Figure 12.24).

drops too quickly, a call drop might occur during the handover procedure. The same could
also happen when the MS moves around a corner. Its own RX level does not change but the
interferer level rapidly increases. This can cause the DL quality to drop to the very low level
(e.g. RxQual = 7) and consequently to trigger a quality-based handover to AMR FR. Since it
would occur in very poor radio conditions, there is a high chance the handover will fail and the
call will be dropped. For that reason the handover algorithm can be improved by preventing
unpacking HOs when the quality drops below a configurabl threshold. This is depicted in
Figure 12.26. Furthermore, when the RX quality reaches the unpacking threshold but the RX
level is low, it might also be reasonable to avoid HO and instead remain on the HR channel.
With this improvement, the HO algorithm prevents AMR unpacking and interference based
intracell handovers when the RX level and/or the RX quality conditions are very poor.
Trials in a live network have proved that these HO improvements reduce the number of
dropped calls during handover. Handover to AMR FR was in this case triggered when RxQual
was 6 or above, while HO was prevented when RxQual was 7 and RxLev was −95 dBm or
less. Figure 12.27 shows the results of the trial where the improved unpacking HO algorithm
reduced DCR on average by 10%.

Service Dependent Channel Allocation
A multiple reuse scheme is a technique whereby multiple frequency reuse factors are used
within the same network. The basic concept is to decrease the effective frequency reuse by
utilizing channel allocation schemes that assign connections to different layers (using various
reuses). The available spectrum is divided into different bands that correspond to different
layers with different reuses, for example a layer with a sparse reuse (e.g. 4/12) and a layer
with a tight frequency reuse like 1/1.

An example of a multiple reuse scheme could be 4/12 reuse for the BCCH TRX together
with 3/9 and 1/1 reuse patterns allocated to the firs and second TCH transceiver respectively.
Nine frequencies are reserved for the second transceiver, thus the second TRX will have a 9
reuse. These 9 frequencies are never used by the firs or third transceivers in any of the cells
in the system. In the same way, the third TRX in all cells use one of the frequencies from the
third set which consists of six frequencies in reuse 1/1. Altogether 33 frequencies are needed
(12 for BCCH, 9 for reuse 3/9 and 12 for reuse 1/1). This method allows for gradual tightening
of the reuse as more TRXs are installed (e.g. one TRX can be added to the layer with reuse
1/1). Furthermore, it also takes advantage of the fact that the traffi is not homogeneously
distributed within the system.
Modern radio resource algorithms allow the allocation of resources from different layers
based on service type. Now a days, a huge variety of available services with different C/I
requirements need to be supported in the GERAN network. Some of them like (E)GPRS
requires good radio conditions (high C/I) while other services like AMR are robust against
interference and can be served in relatively low C/I. Service Dependent Channel Allocation
(SDCA) is a technique that allows a radio channel to be allocated based on the service type.
The basic concept is to allocate a radio channel for the specifi service from a layer define
in the list of preferred layers. With this technique, TRXs are divided into layers, hence a
layer represents a TRX or a group of TRXs which offer the same radio quality (as a result of
belonging to the same frequency plan). Different layers have different qualities since they are
planned with different reuse factors. Every service has its own list of preferred layers. Only
resources included in that list can be allocated to the service. The list can contain one or more
layers and the order of the layers could represent the order of preference. Figure 12.28 depicts
the concept of channel allocation based on service type. In this example, a cell is define

with 5 TRXs and 3 layers: layer 0 represents a BCCH TRX planned with a 4/12 reuse pattern
and offering superior quality; layer 1 represents TRX2 and TRX3 planned with a 3/9 pattern
and offering good quality; layer 2 represents TRX 4 planned with a 1/3 pattern and provides
medium quality; and the worst quality layer with 1/1 reuse pattern is layer 3 consisting of
TRX5. Since in this example there are 3 services and each of them requires its own list of
preferred layers there are 3 lists dedicated to each service type. Service 1 (e.g. EGPRS) is
the service that has the highest C/I requirement. Therefore the Service Dependent Channel
Allocation algorithm for EGPRS assigns resources from layer 0 only (which provides highest
quality). Service 2 (e.g. EFR) requires good or medium quality, therefore in the associated
list of layers, layer 1 with good quality is preferred unless there are no resources available, in
which case layer 2 (which provides medium quality) is selected. Finally service 3 (e.g. AMR)
has the lowest C/I requirements, therefore a channel can be allocated from layer 3 which is
planned with the tight 1/1 frequency reuse and offering the poorest quality.
Service Dependent Channel Allocation allows efficien utilization of the frequency band. A
channel is allocated according to the required quality and the list of layers which comes as the
result of frequency planning. Furthermore, the parameters used to configur radio link control
functions such as power control and handover can be differentiated for each service instead
of being fi ed for the whole cell. This might be needed since for different services, different
strategies may need to be applied. For example, AMR is more resistant to interference than

Capacity Enhancements for GSM
411
other services such as EFR and so a more aggressive strategy could be applied. As a result,
parameters dedicated to the AMR service can be applied so that a power increase for AMR
calls might be triggered later than for the EFR calls. Likewise, the handover parameters can
be adjusted according to the C/I requirements of the service. A consequence of aggressive
parameter settings might be a lowering of the level of interference leading to positive impacts
to retainability and speech quality.
The concept of Service Dependent Channel Allocation provides higher fl xibility when
assigning resources to voice/data services. Each layer can be tailored to handle a specifi
service, whose quality requirements determine the adopted reuse scheme. The concept of
layers also allows an additional degree of freedom in the link control functions, which in turn
can lead to greater mobile network efficien y.
A potential benefi of SDCA which is most relevant is when the performance enhancement
is transformed into the capacity gain. A simulation campaign was performed to estimate the
potential capacity gain from a multiple reuse scheme that utilizes a Service Dependent Channel
Allocation scheme. The performance of multiple layers together with the SDCA scheme were
compared with a reference scenario, which consisted of a single baseband hopping layer within
which and BCCH TRX was included. In total, 27 frequencies were included in the hopping
sequence. Power control and DTX were activated in uplink and downlink. Three service types
were used: EFR, AMR and EGPRS. In the SDCA case, the BCCH layer was planned with
reuse 4/12 and served by EGPRS only. For EFR 1 TRX with synthesized random hopping over
6 frequencies was used. Finally AMR traffi was served by one layer consisting of 2 TRXs
using synthesized random hopping with 9 frequencies in 1/1 reuse. In this campaign traffi
was simulated using the following traffi mix: 50% AMR, 25% EFR and 25% EGPRS.
The results in Figure 12.29 show the trend in the overall drop call rate (for AMR and
EFR) and suggest that the multiple reuse scheme and SDCA provide an additional gain

(Figure 12.30).
During the simulation campaign the speech quality was studied by observing the FER in

SDCA when compared to the reference scenario.
Finally, EGPRS throughput was studied. In the reference scenario, PS data was served using
baseband hopping while SDCA allowed EGPRS to be allocated to the dedicated BCCH layer
that offers excellent C/I conditions. This had the impact of increasing the throughput in the
SDCA case, as depicted in Figure 12.31.
The results demonstrate that SDCA has the potential to provide significan performance
enhancements and capacity gains when compared to a reference network that utilized baseband
hopping. However, SDCA requires careful frequency planning and parameter optimization
(adjustment for each service type) and the gains are dependent on network load and traffi
distribution.

Advanced Abis Solutions
GERAN network entities (Base Station, BSC, TRAU) are connected to each other by means
of E1/T1 TDM links which convey traffi related to a user as well as control and management
planes over Abis and Ater/A interfaces (Figure 12.32).
Transmission to and from base stations accounts for a large part of total cost of ownership
(TCO) in GERAN: radio access networks are non-homogeneous in terms of topologies and
traffi volume per base station; base stations are numerous and often cover large areas; transport
bandwidth is limited; and its scalability is stepwise in large steps of for example 2 Mbit/s in
case of E1.
Moreover, GERAN just like other mobile communication networks is currently facing traffi
growth challenges of a twofold nature:

Traditional realization of transport in GERAN.
r connection of more and more subscribers contributes to steady growth of voice traffic
r huge increase in data traffi which is driven by an availability of features enabling high
throughput rates on a radio interface (EGPRS, DLDC, EGPRS2, . . .) and also by competitive
fla rates.
The combination of these two effects results in a traffi “explosion” both in emerging and
mature markets which additionally coincides with a change of traffi characteristics from
voice-dominated to data-dominated as most of the innovations – both in terms of devices and
in terms of end-user services – are conceived for the packet world. The traffi explosion and an
inevitable migration towards data dominated mobile networks definitel increase bandwidth
demand but do not necessarily bring proportional revenues for network operators as the fla
rate trend for PS services leads to greater data traffi in the network but not to additional
ARPU.
Therefore, to keep the business profitable the costs should be uncoupled from capacity
which means migrating from a TDM-based transport to an IP-based one. Thus the revolution
in the GERAN transport aiming at the introduction of IP transport, which was supposed to
begin soon anyway, has even been brought forward and has actually now already started.
12.8.1
Basic Principles for Saving Bandwidth and Costs
In a traditional Abis realization, a TDM signal is transmitted over E1/T1 links using a per-
manent mapping between the radio and Abis interface. Typically, on top of these permanent
resources on the Abis interface, some dynamic capacity (depending on PS traffi volume to
be served) is made available to enable high data throughput rates. The essential drawback of
such a set-up is the blocking of transmission capacity even if there is no information to be
sent (for example, during transmission of idle or silent frames). In such a case dummy bits are
inserted to preserve a constant bit rate. Therefore, in the traditional realization of the transport
in GERAN, Abis bandwidth is determined by a configuratio of a base station: nearly the same

Capacity Enhancements for GSM
415
bandwidth is reserved for base stations with the given configuratio regardless of traffi load.
For these reasons the traditional TDM-based transport that is adequate to handle voice and
data with basic GPRS coding schemes CS1/CS2 (which were the only user plane traffi types
present in GSM networks until EGPRS deployment) is becoming inefficien for a transmission
of the bursty traffi nowadays dominating in GERAN networks.
Migration to the IP-based transport means the introduction of a new concept in which Abis
frames conveying traffi and signalling information between a base station and an associated
controller are subject to conversion prior to sending them to a transmission path. As a result
of this conversion, the informative bits retrieved from incoming frames are used to form IP
packets which are eventually sent over the Abis interface. Such realization of the Abis transport
is referred to as “packet Abis” hereafter. A packetization process described above brings in
a number of effects which contribute to bandwidth savings which are achievable with the
Packet Abis and unattainable for the traditional Abis realization. The most important are the
following:
r only informative bits are transmitted over Packet Abis, all other bits are not needed (for
example, those used to preserve a constant bit rate in the legacy Abis implementation) and
thus are not sent;
r the number of IP packets that are produced and transmitted corresponds exactly to the actual
traffi load of a base station; moreover, further bandwidth optimization is observed due
to the statistical multiplexing effect caused by an unbalanced load in sectors of the base
station; bandwidth is used efficientl as it is allocated according to the actual needs, that is
a common bandwidth is reused by different traffi types, a codec mode used on the radio
interface determines a payload size, no resources are dedicated permanently, no “empty”
packets are sent.
Obviously, the involvement of transport protocols leads to a certain transmission overhead
but the savings from the packetization process more than compensates for the bandwidth
consumption for the transport of the protocol headers introduced by the Packet Abis. In
consequence, unlike the traditional Abis, the required transport bandwidth mainly depends on
a load and a traffi profil observed in a base station and varies over time.
12.8.2
Transport Aspects
An additional advantage of the Packet Abis is that the above-mentioned principles are appli-
cable to different realizations of a physical layer, namely the currently installed TDM links as
well as Ethernet links (i.e. Packet Switched Networks) can transmit Packet Abis traffic
The former allows reuse of an existing transport infrastructure and significan reduction of
bandwidth usage on Abis lines at the same time (i.e. due to optimization effects brought in by
Packet Abis, more TRXs can be handled by given amount of TDM links). Both are helpful to
protect the installed base of TDM networks which is especially appreciated by those operators
who have recently made big investments in leased lines.
The latter leads to phasing out the TDM transport and to the introduction of Packet Switched
Networks (PSN) instead. The process affects the existing network topology but it paves the way
to a common, fully integrated transport network that can be freely shared between different

416
GSM/EDGE
radio access technologies as well as by fi ed networks which is beneficia in terms of costs
and operability.
The Ethernet-based IP transport is more cost efficien in comparison to the TDM-based
one but, on the other hand, it introduces some complexity that is irrelevant to the TDM-based
transport and special features are needed to cope with this. The most crucial issues are related
to:
r transport impairments;
r synchronization distribution;
r higher security requirements;
r lack of guaranteed bandwidth.
The grade of service must not be reduced after migration from TDM-based transport to
the Packet Switched Networks (PSN) where a certain packet loss rate, packet delay and
packet delay variations are inevitably present. Although all these transport impairments are
unavoidable in PSN, it is possible to achieve “TDM-like” performance and to preserve voice
quality and data throughputs at the level before migration by keeping the packet loss rate,
the packet delay and the packet delay variation below definit thresholds. Therefore, stringent
requirements concerning the packet loss rate, the packet delay and the delay variation are put
on a PSN, and satisfying the required service level is a prerequisite for the selection of the
PSN as a transport network.
Delivery of a synchronization signal from a master (e.g. base station controller) to a slave
entity (i.e. base station in case of GERAN) with an expected time and frequency accuracy is a
fundamental requirement in the GERAN networks (Figure 12.33). For the traditional transport
realization, the synchronization signal is reliably distributed among the master and slave
entities by means of TDM lines connecting these entities, while in a PSN the synchronization

417
chain is broken and in consequence isolated physical clocks cannot synchronize with each
other over time. Thus several techniques are worked out and made available to guarantee
the distribution of the synchronization signal between distant nodes for various network
configurations topologies and customers’ preferences. Available methods can be classifie
into one of the following categories:
r external synchronization input, for example a GPS receiver;
r physical layer, for example Synchronous Ethernet [13];
r clock recovery algorithms [14].
A GPS receiver installed at a base station is the source of a timing signal which can guarantee
a required accuracy and stability. However, in this method the installation of the GPS receiver
is necessary at each node, which in some cases can be unacceptable, for instance, due to costs.
Synchronous Ethernet makes use of a concept known from for example PDH/SDH networks
where an extremely accurate reference signal is transmitted over a physical layer and all other
clocks in the network can adjust their timing via a dedicated port. In this method the reference
timing signal is delivered to the Ethernet switches using a synchronization port. The method
maintains a stable and a precise clock signal regardless of a network load when it is supported
at every hop along the chain of nodes between the source of reference clock (e.g. BSC) and the
base station. Precision Time protocol (define by [14]) is a solution in which a reference source
generates timing packets transmitted to a single distinct node. In the case of GERAN, this is
the base station site which the timing packet is produced for. The slave function installed in
the base station uses complex algorithms to interpret a reception rate of time-stamped packets
and retrieve a clock signal.
Use of a public Ethernet or IP networks for GERAN transport purposes raises security con-
cerns because it makes the connections between base stations and controllers more vulnerable
to possible attacks than in the case of the traditional TDM-based transport. The security aspects
are especially crucial in the case of large PS networks which might be shared between various
systems and managed by different operators. Such networks often offer global connectivity
which is conducive to increasing the risk of attacks. Thus a number of countermeasures have
been worked out to reduce the potential security weaknesses of PS networks and, in particular,
to improve the security level for Packet Abis. The key security features are:
r access control based on control lists or identity certification
r installation of fir walls in front of important network entities (such as base station controllers)
or interconnecting nodes;
r creation of IPsec tunnels on the route from base stations to a controller.
Bandwidth available in PSN is normally shared with unknown traffic Besides, complex and
non-homogeneous transport networks working under variable load conditions result in band-
width fluctuations Thus, the bandwidth required to avoid overload in the whole transmission
path between the base station and the base station controller must be protected by a congestion
control mechanism.
GERAN networks are very different from each other and therefore no single recommen-
dation for the migration from TDM-based to IP-based transport exists. Quite the contrary,
several possible migration paths are available. To choose the best one, the requirements of

418
GSM/EDGE
each operator must be elaborated separately and a fina decision depends on many incompa-
rable factors including, but not limited to, customer strategy and preferences, installed base in
terms of HW platform, network configuratio and traffi load, price scheme and subscribers’
profile Nevertheless availability of reliable PS networks is always the supreme precondition
for starting the migration, so it becomes a decisive factor which definitel affects the pace
of the transport evolution and is taken into account during the elaboration of the network
evolution steps and timeframe.
12.8.3
GERAN Transport Evolution for Different Network Scenarios
Packet Abis provides significan savings in terms of a required transmission bandwidth. As
already explained, bandwidth savings are possible owing to decomposition of a PCM time
structure and the introduction of optimization mechanisms aimed at transmitting solely the
informative bits. As a result, in the E1 environment, even up to 24 TRXs can be served by a
single line with Packet Abis over TDM depending on a traffi load and user profile Although
the achievable bandwidth savings definitel vary with different traffi volumes to be carried
over the Abis interface, and thus the number of TRXs that can be handled by an individual
TDM line needs to be evaluated case-by-case, quite a few overall conclusions can be drawn.
For the Packet Abis over TDM, the crucial base station configuration are those where the
entire TDM line can be off-loaded just due to introduction of Packet Abis. In such a case the
achievable savings can be employed twofold: either by allowing more traffi to be handled
by the base station with the same transmission capacity in terms of TDM lines or by moving
the redundant TDM lines to other base station sites where shortage of transmission capacity
is experienced. Both ways are helpful to improve cost efficien y of a transport network even
before the migration to PSN.
Further cost optimization is possible after a replacement of TDM lines with PSN even
though Packet Abis over PSN consumes more bandwidth than Packet Abis over TDM due to a
bigger transport overhead. Nevertheless, better cost efficien y is achievable after the migration
to the IP transport because costs per bit are significantl lower in PSN than those in TDMlines.
The related savings, compared to the same bandwidths, can even exceed 50%, depending on
the network configuratio and price scheme.
Figure 12.34 summarizes typical migration paths in GERAN networks. The traditional
TDM-based transport can evolve either directly to a PSN-based one or gradually in intermediate
steps where a Packet Abis over TDMis in use to protect installed base and optimize bandwidth
consumption on Abis. As mentioned in the previous section, the evolution path depends on
many factors and must be elaborated for each individual customer case.
IP-based transport combines bandwidth savings due to explicit optimization done prior
to transmission and low cost transport media. Therefore it is the most cost effective one.
Besides, in addition to Packet Abis, a similar concept of transport is already applicable
to GERAN interfaces towards core network (A over IP, Gb over IP) to enable seamless IP
transport throughout the entire GERAN network. Finally, further synergies and in consequence
additional cost savings are possible when the same transport network is shared by various
technologies, for example, by co-located 2G and 3G sites, which is also possible with a
common IP-based transport. To satisfy market demands that expect a consistent plan of
GERAN transport evolution, future proof products are now available, together with various

Introduction
Climate change due to global warming is one of the most challenging global problems today
and for the next decades. The root cause of global warming is the greenhouse effect induced
by massive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases [1], especially in
highly industrialized and fast developing countries. Although the telecommunications sector
contributes to only 0.5% of the total CO2 emissions [2], it is crucial that it minimizes its
ecological footprint as well.
The energy costs are currently one of the biggest components of the operator’s OPEX1
and may become even more significan in the coming years if the energy prices increase.
So by applying measures to reduce energy consumption such as efficien network planning
or solutions to optimize the GSM network energy performance, operators may lower their
operational expenditures while limiting the negative impact upon our natural environment.
Among solutions to improve the energy efficien y, the main focus is placed on features
reducing the power consumption of base station sites, which amounts to about 90% of the total
energy consumed by a mobile network infrastructure. The remaining 10% are dedicated to
power other network elements such as controllers, OSS,2 core network, etc. About 70% of the
power consumed by a base station site is directly utilized to form communication signals to
mobile terminals and controllers. The remaining 30% are expended mostly by air-conditioning
systems.

In this chapter some of the solutions to improve energy efficien y are presented. Section 13.2
provides an overview of an energy optimized network design. Sections 13.3 and 13.4 focus
on the functionalities developed to enhance network coverage and capacity with the help of
which the base station footprint can be minimized and consequently substantial power savings
can be achieved. Section 13.5 addresses dedicated “green” software features to optimize
the power transmitted over the air interface and simultaneously improve the environmental
performance of GSM networks. Section 13.6 highlights hardware solutions lowering power
consumption of the signal processing units and the air-conditioning systems. In Section 13.7,
renewable energy sources as alternative ways to power base station sites are described. Finally,
Section 13.8 presents the concepts of the energy-aware mechanisms applied to controllers and
transcoders.
13.2
Energy Optimized Network Design
When deploying an environmentally friendly network, the energy efficien y should be con-
sidered in several areas. One of the key enablers of highly energy-efficien mobile networks
is the optimum planning and design aiming at building the network with a minimum number
of hardware elements such as BTSs and TRXs. This can be achieved by applying various
advanced coverage and capacity enhancements.
Coverage extension beyond the one offered by a commonly used two-branch (2RX) receive
diversity in uplink is possible by means of advanced techniques to improve the radio link
performance. Moreover, specifi BTS site architectures have been developed to increase the
range of the cells. For instance, by installing feederless sites, in which a base station radio unit
is located close to an antenna system, a feeder cable is eliminated and with it the related feeder
losses. As a result of coverage improvements, the number of radio sites can be potentially
reduced without jeopardizing the overall perceived radio quality. Owing to the decreased
number of sites in the network, the total power consumption can thus be minimized, as
illustrated in Figure 13.1.
Furthermore, the growth of mobile traffi introduces challenges to operators on how to boost
the network capacity while sustaining sufficien quality and keeping CAPEX3/OPEX down.
Therefore, features to increase the spectral and hardware efficiencie have become highly
desirable.
By improving the network spectral efficien y, it is possible to boost the network capacity
without quality degradation. In some scenarios, higher spectral efficien y may allow the
operators to improve the capacity by extending cell configuration with additional TRXs.
This, in turn, may avoid the deployment of extra capacity sites that would increase the energy
consumption in the network. By increasing the hardware efficien y, it is possible either to
provide the same capacity with a reduced amount of resources or to serve higher traffi
without configuratio extensions. The resultant savings in the number of actively used radio
time slots or even in the number of deployed TRXs, may translate directly into the reduction of
energy consumption. A potential package of “green” features could include: Power Control,

coverage and capacity boosters and their influenc on the energy savings are discussed in more
detail.
Although particular features aiming to enhance either coverage or capacity may bring
significan energy savings, further savings can be achieved by applying dedicated “green”
software solutions to optimize the power transmitted on the radio interface. This optimization
may be realized by intelligent (radio) resource allocation, by extending the energy saving
mode on BCCH TRX or by putting network elements onto standby mode when not in use.
Energy-aware software solutions are presented in Section 13.5.
Another way to slash the power consumption is to use the latest most energy-efficien base
station technology which can yield savings up to 35%.
Air-conditioning units are nowadays the most common solution for cooling telecom shelters
that contain radio equipment. They consume approximately 30% of the total BTS site energy.
Introducing instead a new cooling method, that is air-fl w cooling may bring additional energy
savings.
In addition, renewable energy sources are becoming viable alternatives to power base station
sites. The sun and wind are the “greenest” solutions as the energy is harnessed without any
impact on the natural environment. For example, while today’s primary choice to power remote
sites that are out of range of an electricity grid is a diesel generator, using solar power is a
much “greener” alternative. And although the initial investments for a solar power generator
are much higher than that of a diesel generator, it can prove to be a much cheaper option over
the years since regular on-site maintenance including refueling can be avoided.

illustrated in Figure 13.2.
13.3
Coverage Improvement Techniques
As introduced earlier, techniques to improve the radio coverage can contribute to the reduction
of the number of radio equipments to cover a given region, and in turn reduce the energy
consumption of the corresponding network. It is important to note, however, that a balance
between the uplink6 and downlink7 ranges and the gains thereof is necessary in order to
provide an overall radio coverage gain. Indeed, the radio coverage is downlink-limited when
the uplink coverage is better than the downlink coverage, and uplink-limited otherwise.
13.3.1
Uplink Techniques
13.3.1.1
Antenna Diversity – 2RX, 4RX
By using multiple receiving antennas, more signal energy can be collected and therefore
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved when the signals from the antennas are coherently
combined. Moreover, since these radio signals are independently faded, it is also possible to
achieve diversity gain in the environment dominated by multipath propagation. The efficien y
of antenna diversity, called diversity gain, depends on the grade of de-correlation between the
diversity receiving paths.
6 Mobile to network link.
7 Network to mobile link.

425
This gain can be achieved by deploying antennas with orthogonal polarizations8 (X-pol)
or by ensuring sufficien horizontal spatial separation between vertically polarized9 (V-pol)
antennas. For example, for a voice service, it can be assumed that a two-branch (2RX) receive
diversity provides from 4 to 5 dB gain in the link budget. Four-branch (4RX) may be realized by
means of two cross-polarized (X-pol) antennas, however, space separation is required between
them. For the most space-critical cases, it is possible to use a so-called XX-pol antenna which
is composed of 2 separate X-pol antenna elements embedded in a single antenna panel. The
4RX diversity improves sensitivity performance by an average 2 to 3 dB on top of a standard
2RX diversity technique.
13.3.1.2
Mast Head Amplifier – MHA
An additional way to improve uplink performance is to place a low noise amplifie between
the antenna and the feeder cable. This solution is known as the mast head amplifier (MHA).
It aims at compensating the feeder loss in the power budget in the uplink direction and reduces
the composite noise figur of the base station receiver system. Furthermore, if the noise figur
of MHA is better than the one of the base station receiver, MHA may further improve the
sensitivity performance.
13.3.2
Downlink Techniques
In scenarios where the maximum cell range is limited by the performance of the downlink
direction, the cell coverage may be improved by means of for example the downlink transmit
diversity techniques. Among others, the delay diversity (DD) and antenna hopping (AH)
methods have become the most popular ones since they do not require any changes in mobile
stations receiver and hence provide full gains for all terminal types.
13.3.2.1
Delay Diversity – DD
The delay diversity technique refers to a transmission scheme in which delayed copies of
the same modulated signal are transmitted over multiple antennas. The antenna signals are
de-correlated by ensuring sufficien antenna spacing or by applying cross-polarized antennas.
On the MS side, the receiver equalizer is able to separate the signals thanks to the applied time
delay (up to several symbols) and in turn to coherently combine them. On the transmitter side,
a delay is firs induced in the digital domain after which the signals are amplifie separately in
the analogue domain. When two antennas are used, this gives 3 dB extra transmission power
that is double transmission power, to which an additional 2 to 3 dB diversity gain can be
assumed in link budget calculations.
Moreover, the performance of the delay diversity technique can be further enhanced by
rotating the phase of the signal transmitted by the second antenna. The idea behind the
8 Cross-polarized antenna contains two polarization planes (+45◦, −45◦) in a single unit. It achieves diversity in
the same antenna because the main and diversity dipoles are separated by orthogonal polarization planes.
9 Antenna that produces an electrical wave vector in a vertical plane.

426
GSM/EDGE
phase hopping is to prevent continuous, destructive summing of the received signals (e.g.
when the phases of the received signals are in opposition). Since the diversity gain of phase
hopping comes through channel coding and interleaving, similar to that of terminal movement
and frequency hopping, this technique is therefore most beneficia in case of slow-moving
terminals and non-hopping networks.
13.3.2.2
Antenna Hopping
Antenna hopping refers to a scheme in which the transmitter alternately switches between
the two antennas. The idea is to de-correlate the fading profil between bursts, and reach an
improved BLER/FER performance through interleaving and channel coding. This technique
brings the highest benefit in non-frequency-hopping scenarios or in cases when frequency
hopping is not efficien because of for example high correlation between the frequencies.
13.3.2.3
Feederless Sites – FL
Certain undesirable attenuation in the antenna system of a typical BTS site is caused by a
feeder cable between the antenna and the transceiver module. In a feederless site, as depicted
in Figure 13.3, the transceiver modules are located as close as possible to the antenna. In
addition, either the whole base station hardware is located on top of the tower or the baseband
system modules are connected by means of fibe optic cables and optical converters.
Hence, in both downlink and uplink directions, the signal attenuation due to the feeder cable
is eliminated or greatly reduced, which results in link budget improvements.
The combinations of the afore-mentioned uplink and downlink features might be considered
when planning a well-balanced system from the coverage point of view, as illustrated in
Figure 13.4.
13.3.3
Energy Savings Due to Coverage Enhancements
Coverage enhancements solutions presented in Sections 13.3.1 and 13.3.2 can lead to sig-
nifican site count reduction without affecting the quality of the network. However, this gain

cannot be directly transformed into energy savings at the network level since the deployment
of coverage boosters at a BTS site may increase its power consumption.
In Table 13.1, the performance of various functionalities that improve the cell coverage
is compared against the reference 2RX diversity technique. For each scenario the number of
BTS sites required to cover a rural area of 10000 sq.km with 90% probability is estimated.
Three-sector sites with 2 TRXs per cell and 30-meter-high antennas with 18 dBi gain are
assumed in the link budget calculations. The typical output power and sensitivity values for
the GSM 900 MHz band and state-of-the-art BTS and MS equipment are used.
Although the MHA deployment on top of two-branch receive diversity increases the cell
range significantl , the scenario remains still uplink-limited – as in the reference case. The
application of the 4RX solution further extends the cell range but becomes downlink-limited.
The additional application of DD allows a site-to-site distance increase by approximately 43%
compared to the reference scenario.
The increase of the site area allows a reduction of the site count, the level of which for
different coverage boosters is presented in Table 13.2, together with the influenc on the
power savings for the exemplary BTS power consumption figures
Tables 13.3 and 13.4 depict the influenc of the feederless site deployment on the cell
coverage and power savings respectively. Downlink coverage improvement solutions are not
applicable here since the scenario remains uplink-limited even for the 4RX diversity case.
With a feederless site with four-branch receive diversity technique, a site count reduction of
48% can be translated into 41% of power savings.

Capacity Improvement Techniques
13.4.1
AMR, SAIC and DFCA as Green Features
13.4.1.1
AMR
AMR is an efficien quality and capacity improvement functionality that relies on improved
robustness of the AMR codec modes against errors in poor radio conditions. With AMR, the
need for additional base station sites due to capacity reasons can be significantl reduced as
more TRXs per site can be deployed. This is because of the higher spectral efficien y it offers,
that is more subscribers per MHz can be supported with AMR than without.
AMR half-rate (AMR HR) can carry the same traffi with less radio resources as two users
can be served by a single radio time slot. These inherent properties of AMR can be utilized to
slash the energy consumption in GSM networks.
In the case of AMRHR codec modes, although the same speech codecs as in full-rate mode
are defined better radio conditions (higher C/I values) are required for the same frame error
rate (FER) performance. Therefore, half-rate utilization and consequently hardware efficien y
depend strongly on the C/I distribution in the network. For example, higher HR utilization can
be achieved at lower load operation points as better C/I distribution enables higher HR usage.
On the other hand, in high network load conditions and worse radio interface quality, AMR
HR penetration must be decreased. In that case a higher utilization of AMR FR will guarantee
sufficien speech quality owing to very robust codecs such as 5.9 or 4.75 kbit/s.
The introduction of AMR codecs which can tolerate lower C/I values provides additional
means to reduce the power consumed by the BTSs. By definin tighter power control thresholds
for AMR calls, the transmission power used in uplink and in downlink may be lowered

efficientl , and energy savings ensued. The impact of AMR on BTS transmission power has
been verifie by means of system level simulations (see Figure 13.5) performed on top of a
cluster comprising 122 BTSs with maximum output power varying between 37 and 42 dBm.
A dynamic range of a downlink power control equal to 30 dB was used.
As Figure 13.5 depicts, the introduction of the AMR codecs combined with AMR optimized
power control settings reduces the usage of the high transmit power levels. The application of
tighter power control thresholds for AMR mobiles would help reduce the BTS transmit power
even more. However, further energy savings would be realized at the cost of a compromised
speech quality.
The average BTS power reduction due to AMR optimized power control settings is shown
in Figure 13.6 (a). It can be seen that the reduction is equal to approximately 2.5 dB for a
conservative power control strategy while for an aggressive one it exceeds 3 dB. The transmit
power reduction can be transformed into a lowered BTS energy consumption. As shown in
Figure 13.6 (b), the energy savings are even up to 7% per BTS for aggressive power control
settings. The aggressive power control strategy means that the PC thresholds are set to less
stringent values, hence effectively reducing the corresponding transmission power.

overall C/I distribution in the network. This improvement can be utilized to increase the
network capacity without building new sites. In addition, DFCA allows very high HR use
without compromising the speech quality. A higher HR penetration leads to a higher BTS
hardware utilization which in turn requires a lower number of TRXs to support the same
traffi
load. And thanks to lower TRXs configurations the combining losses10 might be
minimized as well. Therefore, the number of sites due to enhanced cell ranges can be reduced.
A detailed description of the DFCA functionality can be found in Chapter 9.
13.4.1.3
Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC)
SAIC is a generic term for single antenna receiver techniques which attempt to cancel or
suppress interference through signal processing. It is mainly intended for use in the downlink
direction, where terminal space and aesthetics typically preclude the use of multiple antennas.
SAIC was standardized in Release 6 as DARP Phase 1 (see Chapter 1), that is performance
requirements and signaling of the terminal capability were defined However, at some oper-
ators’ request, SAIC terminals were made available that were non-DARP Phase 1 terminals.
The firs commercial pre-release 6 SAIC terminals were available already in 2004 but they had
some limitations, for example they were not able to indicate to the network that they supported
advanced receiver capabilities [2,4].
The main idea of SAIC is to cancel or suppress the co-channel interference at the mobile
side. Owing to improved co-channel link level performance a SAIC-capable mobile can
tolerate higher interference level than a non-SAIC terminal. Figure 13.7 compares the link-
level performance of an exemplary SAIC and a conventional (non-SAIC) receivers. Channel
conditions in these simulations are typical urban 3 km/h (TU3) and ideal frequency hopping.
10 Combining losses stands for all the attenuations between a TRX output and an antenna feeder input, introduced
by units separating the TX and RX paths and coupling several TRX into a single antenna.

Link-level performance, SAIC vs. non-SAIC receiver.
As can be seen (and expected), the SAIC receiver has better Raw BER11 performance than a
non-SAIC receiver. Consequently better received signal quality values (RXQUAL12 [5]) can
be reported by a SAIC mobile station in certain radio conditions. Since RXQUAL is one of
the inputs to the power control algorithm, a lower transmission power in downlink direction
in turn can be expected for SAIC mobiles.
A BTS serving SAIC mobiles can thus transmit with lower power. This in turn reduces the
overall level of interference which improves the performance of the conventional non-SAIC
mobiles as well.
Moreover if the SAIC terminal penetration increases, the downlink power control algorithm
is able to reduce the BTS transmit power more efficientl . This can be seen in Figure 13.8

which shows the distribution of BTS transmitted carrier power for different SAIC terminal
penetration rates. One can note that the percentage of radio bursts transmitted with high power
drops significantl once SAIC capable mobiles are present in the network. At the same time
the share of bursts transmitted with reduced power increases compared to the reference case
with non-SAIC terminals only.
The average BTS power reduction resulting from SAIC introduction is shown in Figure
13.9 (a). It can be noticed that for 50% penetration of SAIC capable terminals the average
reduction was approximately 4 dB higher compared to the non-SAIC scenario. With 100% of
SAIC terminals, the reduction was slightly higher, that is approximately 4.5 dB compared to
the non-SAIC scenario. There is a clear correlation between the transmit power reduction and
the BTS energy consumption. As shown in Figure 13.9 (b), the energy savings coming from
SAIC technique reach up to 9% per BTS for a pure SAIC scenario.
13.4.2
OSC
Orthogonal sub-channels (OSC) is a voice capacity feature that aims to improve the cost
efficien y of GSM voice services by allowing two mobile stations to be multiplexed simulta-
neously on the same radio channel, each occupying a sub-channel.
The technical method of doubling the voice channel capacity in downlink is based on a
QPSK-like modulation, where each of the sub-channels is mapped so that it can be received
as a (legacy) GMSK signal. In the uplink direction the traditional GMSK modulation is
applied in combination with 2 × 2 multi-user MIMO13 technique. Both orthogonal sub-
channels are simultaneously received by the BTS that needs to employ, for example diversity
and interference cancellation means separating the two orthogonal sub-channels. Different

training sequence codes are assigned to terminals simultaneously sharing the same channel in
order to optimize the link performance, in both uplink and downlink directions. With these
techniques combined with AMR half-rate mode, up to four legacy SAIC handsets can be
served within a single radio time slot in a so-called Double Half-Rate (DHR) mode (see Figure
13.10). The OSC concept can also be extended to AMR full-rate mode offering the capability
of multiplexing two full-rate connections on the same radio time slot in Double Full Rate
(DFR) mode. Note that in this sub-section the focus is on DHR mode only.
OSC enables up to four users to be allocated on the same radio time slot which significantl
increases the BTS hardware efficien y. This means that in contrast to a non-OSC scenario either
less radio resources are needed to carry the same CS traffi or a higher traffi volume can be
served with the same number of TRXs. The BTS hardware efficien y gain greatly depends
on DHR mode utilization itself, the penetration of SAIC-capable mobiles, the network load
conditions, the interference distribution, etc. Additionally, the path-loss criterion plays an
important role in the multiplexing procedure as only a limited difference between link budgets
of paired users is allowed.
Figure 13.11 shows the average TCH time slot occupation as a function of different AMR
FR/HR and OSC penetrations. In all the scenarios for the given TRX configuratio the same
offered traffi was used. It was calculated for 100% AMR, the FR case was at 2% of blocking
probability. As can be observed, AMR HR significantl decreases the average TCH time slot
occupation while OSC may reduce this KPI14 further by around 20–25%.
The TCH time slot occupation has a substantial impact on the amount of energy expended
per BTS hardware. The major portion of the energy is consumed by TRXs, especially by power
amplifier during on-transmission periods. Hence higher energy savings can be achieved with
OSC as the number of active time slots for a given traffi load is lower than in non-OSC
scenarios. The potential savings in the BTS power consumption are depicted in Figure 13.12.
The savings obtained in the scenario with high HR utilization can be extended by an additional

penetration, it is possible to reduce the number of deployed TRXs without compromising the
network grade of service. Thus the afore-mentioned energy savings could be boosted even
further.
13.4.3
Power Control on Non-BCCH Transceivers
The aim of power control (PC) is to adjust the level of the power transmitted by a BTS or by
a mobile so that an adequate transmission quality is maintained on the radio communication
path in both downlink and uplink directions. This results in a decreased interference level in
the network. However, another positive effect is a reduced power consumption at the BTS and
MS sides.

The achievable savings of the PC algorithm on the BTS power consumption were verifie by
network level simulations executed on top of the same scenario as described in Section 13.5.1.
Figure 13.13 depicts the absolute (in kWh/day) and relative savings as a result of PC activation
for two different network load conditions. As proved by simulations, PC reduces the BTS
power consumption to a large extent. Up to 8 kWh/day can be saved, which corresponds to
25% cuts in energy expanded by the BTS.
13.4.4
Discontinuous Transmission
Other effective means of decreasing the BTS power consumption are to activate the discon-
tinuous transmission (DTX) functionality. DTX avoids transmitting when a silent period is
detected during a speech connection. In a typical speech call, the involved parties are active
alternately, hence leaving periods of silence. A subscriber talks for on average 50–60% of the
conversation time. This, however, depends on the language family and speaker’s temperament.
As a result, when a subscriber does not speak, the transmitter can be switched off. Thus, not
only can the interference level in a network be decreased (which is the main motivation to
introduce DTX), but the power consumption of the BTS and the MS could be decreased as well.
The savings in the BTS power consumption due to the application of the DTX feature were
verifie by means of network level simulations performed on the same scenario as described in
Section 13.5.1. Figure 13.14 depicts the absolute (in kWh/day) and relative savings from DTX
for two different network load conditions. As shown, the DTX can save up to 3.5 kWh/day per
base station. This is approximately 12% of the power consumed by the BTS in a non-DTX case.

In Table 13.5, exemplary combinations of particular features are compared in the context of
power consumption savings resulting from possible reductions in the site count and cell con-
figurations As the reference, the EFR-only network scenario with a basic set of standard GSM
functionalities such as radio frequency hopping (FH), Power Control (PC) and Discontinuous
Transmission (DTX) was considered. Assuming a maximum effective frequency load (EFL)
of 9–12% in the hopping layer for a well-optimized network scenario with 5-MHz bandwidth
deployment, approximately 16.5 Erlangs can be served by every single cell without compro-
mising the network quality in terms of speech quality (reflecte by bad quality samples (BQS))
as well as dropped call rate (DCR). This traffi has to be carried on 4 TRXs in order to keep
the blocking probability below 2%.
The introduction of AMR FR, owing to its increased robustness against errors in poor radio
conditions, achieves higher EFL without violating the soft blocking limit (a maximum EFL
for AMR FR of 20% has been assumed). This, in turn, makes it possible to increase the
site capacity by deploying additional TRXs and consequently to reduce the number of sites
needed to provide a certain guarantee of service. In the analyzed example, the number of sites

can be decreased by 46% which corresponds to a 14% lower power consumption (see Table
13.6). The activation of AMR half-rate mode enables a considerable reduction in the number
of TRXs needed to carry a given traffi without any hard blocking deterioration. This yields
further energy savings. Forcing AMR HR utilization (80%) with the help of the DFCA feature
yielded about 40% energy savings. Further cuts in power consumption were obtained thanks
to the introduction of the OSC functionality. With 40% OSC penetration, the energy savings
reached 51%.

by the BTS are presented in Figure 13.15.

Energy-Aware Resource Allocation
The aim of a radio resource allocation algorithm in the circuit-switched domain is to search
and allocate radio channels for requests coming to the network during for example a call
establishment or a handover procedure. The radio channel selection algorithm can be based on
criteria such as cell load conditions, terminal and cell capabilities, quality of the available radio
time slots or preferred traffi allocation strategy, that is on a non-BCCH layer or on a BCCH
layer. A typical approach is to prioritize the non-BCCH transceivers for voice call while the

Figure 13.16
Typical (a) vs. energy-aware (b) resource allocation.
BCCH transceiver is predominately reserved for packet-switched connections. This is mainly
because of a better quality offered on the BCCH layer resulting from a looser frequency reuse
pattern. With this approach a voice call is allocated to the BCCH transceiver only if the TCH
ones are fully occupied. However, the opposite strategy can be justifie as well, for example in
narrowband deployments where more aggressive BCCH frequency reuse patterns are applied,
leading to poorer quality experienced on this layer.
The above-mentioned allocation rules are not optimal in the context of BTS power energy
consumption. One of the reasons is that calls being able to operate with low downlink transmit
power may be allocated to the BCCH transceiver on which power control is not allowed and
therefore full power is constantly used as shown in Figure 13.16 (a). If the calls were allocated
to a non-BCCH transceiver, the transmit power could be reduced by means of the power
control procedure, consequently leading to lower BTS power consumption. On the other hand,
the allocation to the non-BCCH transceiver of calls that require high downlink transmit power
significantl limits the usage of the power control algorithm. Instead, by assigning such calls
to the BCCH transceiver on which the maximum transmit power is used regardless of whether
time slots are occupied or not, the BTS power consumption could be optimized. Through
allocation of high power demanding calls to the BCCH transceiver, the unused time slots on
the non-BCCH transceivers could be assigned to calls that can utilize power control more
efficientl as presented in Figure 13.16 (b).
The Energy-aware Resource Allocation aims at allocating radio channels according to
the serving cell downlink signal level measured and reported by a terminal (RX level) as
illustrated in Figure 13.17. The reported levels are compared against configurabl thresholds
in the network to determine whether a call is classifie as a high or low power-demanding
one. The algorithm attempts to allocate calls demanding a high downlink transmit power to a
BCCH transceiver and the calls demanding a low downlink transmit power to a non-BCCH
transceiver. As a result, the average dynamic power reduction can be maximized.
It may, however, happen that the performance of the BCCH layer at a cell edge is unsatis-
factory compared to the non-BCCH layer. In such a case, although the calls are classifie as
high power-demanding ones, they should be allocated to the non-BCCH layer to benefi from
for example frequency hopping gain and thus avoid quality degradation.
In order to minimize the BTS power consumption, the Energy-aware Resource Allocation
principles can be applied also at intra- and inter-cell handovers triggered by bad quality, low
signal level, power budget, etc.

configuratio of which was 4 TRXs per cell that is 1 BCCH and 3 non-BCCH TRXs. The
standard channel allocation priority strategy, that is non-BCCH layer preferred, was used as
the reference for the Energy-aware Resource Allocation. The threshold level that determines
whether a call is classifie as a high or a low power demanding one was set in correlation
with the BCCH downlink reception level distribution experienced in the simulated network.
The power control window was adjusted to ensure that the calls allocated to the non-BCCH
transceivers were immediately subject to the power reduction as shown in Figure 13.18. The
simulations were performed for different network load scenarios.

Average time slot occupation and average power reduction levels on the non-BCCH

The potential savings in the BTS power consumption thanks to energy-aware resource
allocation were benchmarked against the standard resource allocation strategy by evaluating the
average time slot occupation and the average power reduction on the non-BCCH transceivers.
Moreover, the network performance was monitored by evaluating the overall bad quality
samples in uplink and downlink with a frame erasure rate (FER) greater than 2.1%.
As expected, with the energy-aware resource allocation the average time slot utiliza-
tion of the non-BCCH transceivers is lower compared to the standard one as presented in
Figure 13.19(a). The simulations proved that the power control operates most efficientl with
the energy-aware resource allocation. Hence the average power reduction on the non-BCCH
transceivers is higher for this allocation policy as shown in Figure 13.19 (b). In consequence,
the average BTS transmit power is minimized.
Figure 13.20 summarizes the absolute and relative energy savings in the BTS power con-
sumption provided by the energy-aware resource allocation.
The savings in BTS power consumption presented in Figure 13.20 ensue from the optimal
distribution of the calls among the BCCH and non-BCCH transceivers ensured by the energy-
aware resource allocation algorithm. The savings shown in Figure 13.20 refers to a single
BTS site. In a network consisting of for example 2000 sites the potential savings would be
approximately 730 MWh a year.
Figure 13.21 shows that the energy-aware resource allocation has a minor impact on the
network performance in the simulated network compared to the standard allocation strategy.

sufficien to handle the peak traffi demand in the cell according to required grade of service
and/or other quality of service requirements. The network load varies a lot in a day and over
the days of the week. In addition, the traffi during off-peak hours might be significantl
lower than during the busy hour. Consequently a lot of hardware resources are simply unused
during low traffi periods and part of them can be switched off with no impact on network
accessibility.
Figure 13.22 illustrates the hourly profil of the served traffi over a day derived from a
4-TRX cell. As can be seen, there is a huge variation between the served amount of traffi
during off-peak hours (between 11 pm and 8 am) and during busy hours (between 7 pm and
10 pm).

Exemplary traffi profil in a cell (cell configuratio equal to 4 TRXs).
It can be noted that in off-peak hours there is no need to keep all four TRXs active as the
traffi is low enough to be served even by a single TRX without compromising on network
accessibility. By exploiting the traffi
variations in the network, it is possible to achieve
significan power consumption savings.
The TRX power down solution monitors the number of unused time slots in the cell. When
that number exceeds a certain threshold, some TRXs are automatically disabled so that only
those necessary for managing the current traffi load are supplied. However, the decision
to disable TRXs is taken only if the number of free channels remains high enough for the
specifie supervision period.
As soon as the traffi in the cell starts to increase and the number of unused time slots falls
below a predefine threshold, the powered-down TRXs are immediately brought back into
service. With this mechanism any harmful impact on the service quality is avoided. In order
to eliminate frequent TRX switch on and off sequences, a hysteresis is needed so that the
threshold definin the amount of idle radio channels initiating the TRX switch-off procedure
is different from the threshold that triggers the TRX switch-on action.
If the threshold to power down TRXs is set relatively high, the TRX switch-off procedure
starts only when there is a significan drop in the cell traffi load. It may then happen that with
such parameterization, TRXs will be powered down only during night-time, that is when the
majority of the available time slots in the cell are idle. On the other hand, if the threshold is
set to a low value, then the algorithm tries to follow the traffi variations and even small and
temporary fluctuation may trigger the TRX power down procedure. In this case the energy
savings can be also realized throughout a day. Figures 13.23 and 13.24 demonstrate the feature
behavior with the two different parameterization strategies above.
Figure 13.23 shows an example of the algorithm behavior if the threshold to power down
TRXs is set to a relatively high value. The real traffi data collected over two days have been
used to illustrate how the feature reacts on changing cell load conditions. In total, 30 TCH
channels (4 TRXs, 2 TS for signaling) were available in the cell. When the number of idle
radio resources exceeded 22, then 2 TRXs were switched off and the number of active TCH
channels was reduced to 14. It can be observed that TRXs were mainly deactivated at night.
The reason is that the traffi during the day rarely dropped below the level which initiates

TRX power down procedure. On the contrary, Figure 13.24 presents the algorithm behavior in
case the threshold to power down TRXs was set relatively low, that is when just 17 idle radio
resources triggered TRX to shut down. It can be seen that TRXs in that scenario are switched
on and off more frequently than in the previous case. This means that energy could be saved
during daytime as well.
The cell traffi pattern is another factor that has an impact on the level of reduction of the
energy consumed by the BTS. If the traffi load in the cell during busy hours is significantl
higher than in the remaining hours (see Figure 13.25 (a)), TRXs may be switched off earlier
and remain in standby mode for a longer time. This will account for higher energy savings. If
the cell has a more fla traffi distribution (see Figure 13.25 (b)), then energy saving will be
lower as more TRXs are required to serve traffi in off-peak hours.
Besides traffi
profile the amount of traffi
in the cell can also strongly influenc
the
efficien y of the feature. The higher the traffi volume carried by the cell during busy hours,
the more the number of TRXs that need to be installed to meet the required grade of service.
However, in such cells, especially at night, the traffi often drops to a very low level so that
the difference between the maximum and minimum loads is relatively high. As a result, in
such cells, potentially more TRXs may be switched off and eventually a higher portion of the
energy may be saved.
Certain priorities are considered by the TRX switch-off procedure so that some TRXs are
preferred for powering down earlier than other. For instance, TRXs with a lower number of

traffi channels configure (half-rate, dual-rate, full-rate) are the preferred ones for powering
down. Additionally, some TRXs cannot be switched off at all as it would prevent normal BTS
site operation, for example the BCCH TRX cannot be powered down. Moreover, the TRX
management algorithm must not disturb the already established connections. Before being
switched off, a TRX is cleared from the traffi by standard intra-cell handover procedure.
The amount of energy that can be saved by deactivating TRXs during low traffi periods
depends as well on the type of hardware installed on a BTS site and on the methods that are
applied to power down a TRX. In some solutions a whole TRX is switched off, that is baseband
processing together with the RF part. Another method is to switch off the power amplifie (PA)
unit only. Depending on how TRXs are powered down, up to 50 W per TRX might be saved.
For example, in the case of 3-sector BTS site, each sector with 4 TRXs, the energy savings can
reach approximately 1 kWh per day provided that 2 TRXs per cell are switched off for 8 hours.
The time-domain behavior of the TRX Power Down functionality activated in a single cell
with 6 TRXs is presented in Figure 13.26. The number of occupied time slots reflect the
utilization of these TRXs and follows the CS traffi variation in the network reaching its

mean electricity savings due to putting the TRXs in standby mode were equal to approximately
1 kWh/day per cell during extensive observation time. This proves that a considerable gain
from the energy consumption viewpoint can be expected at network level thanks to deploying
TRX Power Down enhancement.
13.5.3
Energy-Saving Mode on BCCH Transceiver
Additional energy savings might be obtained by activating a so-called energy saving mode
for a BCCH transceiver. With this software-based solution, an overall power consumption is
reduced by transmitting dummy bursts on idle channels with 2 dB lower power level compared
to the maximum power of BCCH transceiver. The highest energy savings achievable by the
power reduction on dummy bursts are possible at low traffi periods for example at night
when there is no traffi served on the BCCH transceiver. Further potential energy savings
come from dynamic power control applied on active dedicated circuit switched channels
(TCH/SDCCH) of the BCCH transceiver. With the dynamic power control on busy traffi
channels of the BCCH transceiver, the reduction of power consumption is possible at high
traffi periods as well. The downlink power control on the BCCH transceiver does not differ
from a standard power control utilized on non-BCCH transceivers apart from the fact that the
maximum dynamic power reduction is limited from 30 dB to only 2 dB. As in case of the
standard power control in downlink, the received signal quality (RXQUAL) and the signal
level (RXLEV) of a serving cell measured and reported by a mobile station are used as inputs
to the power control algorithm. If the averaged signal level and quality experienced by a call
handled on the BCCH transceiver indicate good radio conditions, then a 2 dB power reduction
is used. Otherwise, transmission is done at full power. The broadcast and common control
channels (BCCH/CCCH) that are carried on time slot 0 are always transmitted at full power.
This ensures that the cell range from system access viewpoint is not affected.
In the case of packet switched connections served on BCCH time slots, the dynamic power
reduction is not applied. This prevents decreasing the user throughput due to downgrading
of the coding schemes that could result from the reduction in the transceiver output power.
Furthermore, this restriction guarantees that the cell range and data rate distribution for the
GPRS/EDGE services are not affected by this feature. Figure 13.27 illustrates the concept of
energy-saving mode for the BCCH TRX.

The potential gains from that functionality depend on how many time slots of the BCCH a
transceiver can operate with a reduced output power. The number of time slots of the BCCH
TRX that are subject to 2 dB power reduction will depend on factors such as the traffi load
in the cell, distribution of the users, traffi management policy, for example BCCH preferred
vs. non-BCCH preferred time slot allocation for CS/PS services, and quality of the BCCH
layer. Table 13.7 summarizes the exemplary energy savings per 3-sector BTS site with 1 TRX
configuratio as a function of the number of time slots operating with 2 dB power reduction.
The percentage values in Table 13.7 indicate the energy savings compared to a case when all
the time slots of the BCCH transceiver are transmitted with full output power.
The BCCH carriers are continuously transmitted in the downlink direction so that the
minimum reuse for the BCCH layer is clearly limited by the performance of that link. In this
perspective, the energy-saving mode on the BCCH TRX may provide another benefit that is
the reduction of the interference level that is caused by BCCH transmissions. While this may
lead to an improved network quality, the gain strongly depends on the average power reduction
applied on the BCCH layer.
If an operator decides to enable the energy-saving mode on the BCCH TRX in certain
cells, the cell selection, cell reselection and handover procedures involving these cells might
be slightly affected. This is due to the fact that the signal level measured by the mobile at
some instances in time will be affected by the possibly lower output power level of the BCCH
carriers. When the power reduction is applied, a terminal reports lower signal levels than
it would if neighboring cells were otherwise transmitting at the full BCCH power all the
time. This may cause, for example handovers be delayed as neighboring cells would meet
the handover candidate selection criteria a bit later. In addition, the order of the reported
neighboring cells15 may also change as the measurements on some neighboring cells might be
done when the full BCCH power is in use whereas on other neighboring cells when the power
reduction is applied. The extent of that impact is dependent upon the measurement schedule in
each particular mobile station as well as the used output power reduction (See Figure 13.28).
When there is no or little traffi served on the BCCH layer, the average power reduction
of 2 dB can be expected as dummy bursts will be predominantly transmitted by the BCCH
transceivers. On the other hand, in high network load conditions it is likely that there are

hardly any dummy bursts transmitted and on the dedicated SDCCH/TCH channels the power
reduction may not be applied due to quality reasons or insufficien signal level. In such a case,
the expected average deviation from the maximum BCCH signal level is approximately 1 dB.
The afore-mentioned side effects of energy-saving mode on BCCH TRX can be minimized
simply by tuning the corresponding network parameters. However, the adjustment of the
parameters might be needed only in specifi cases when for example handover performance
degradation would be noticed. It is worth noting that experience from EDGE deployment
showed no need for global parameter adjustments due to 8-PSK back-off and reduced BCCH
power in scenarios with EDGE services deployed on the BCCH TRX.
Figure 13.29 presents the potential impact of the BCCH TRX power reduction on the han-
dover procedure. The handover trigger point can be shifted as the result of a lower transmitted
power in the neighboring cell, for example execution of the power budget handover might be
delayed.
Assuming that there are, during one day on the BCCH transceiver, on average 3 time slots
idle and that 2 dB power reduction is applied to 50% of the active BCCH time slots, energy
savings of approximately 1 kWh/day per BTS site can be achieved. The reductions in the BTS
power consumption achievable through BCCH energy saving mode were demonstrated in a
fiel trial. Figure 13.30 shows the BTS power consumption for periods with and without the
feature activated. It can be observed that the average BTS power consumption drops by around

power consumption per year if the BCCH energy-saving mode is enabled on 1000 BTS sites.
13.6
Energy-Efficien BTS Site
The hardware and cooling system of a base station’s hardware can be identifie as the main
contributors to the energy consumption of a BTS site. Although the cooling system is only
part of the auxiliary equipment installed on the BTS site, its power consumption reaches 30%
of the total BTS site power consumption. The remaining 70% is utilized by the base station
hardware itself (see Figure 13.31). Of this, the largest portion, up to 80%, is consumed by the
radio part and only 20% is needed for the baseband processing, transmission equipment, etc.
The energy split within the base station hardware depends on the number of installed TRXs,

the utilization of radio time slots and the transmission power. These factors directly determine
the amount of energy spent to supply the power amplifie stage of each TRX. Since the power
amplifie is the largest energy-consuming unit of the radio part, its demand drives the share of
the radio part in the overall base station power consumption.
A lower BTS power consumption can be achieved by elimination of the power-hungry air
conditioning that is normally used as the cooling system. Air conditioning equipment aims at
maintaining a desired temperature, usually 25◦C, which is the maximum that the BTS HW can
tolerate in a long time period. Significan reduction in power consumption can be obtained by
replacing the air conditioning unit by a fresh-air cooling system with fans.
In a standard system, the air circulates inside the BTS cabinet through the cooler. Without
the air-conditioner the cold air intake from outside and the hot air from inside are circulated by
means of fans as presented in Figure 13.32. Another method to reduce the power consumption

of the air conditioning system is to equip the base station site with hardware that can tolerate
higher temperatures, for example up to 40◦C. With this enhancement the energy consumption
can be reduced by up to 30% compared to traditional “25◦C” hardware.
Significan energy savings can also be achieved by installing a state-of-the-art base station
equipment. The potential savings result mainly from the use of improved power amplifie tech-
nology and linearization techniques. Due to continuous traffi increase in mobile networks and
growing demand for higher peak user data rates, the application of more advanced, spectrally
efficien modulation schemes becomes inevitable. Such modulations require, however, a high
linearity of power amplifiers which in turn implies an increased energy consumption. On the
other hand, there is strong pressure to limit the total energy consumed by the BTS hardware.
These facts justify continuous efforts spent coping with the contradictory requirements de-
fine nowadays for the power amplifie technology. For example, the latest GSM/EDGE and
WCDMA base station equipment can decrease the energy consumption by 35% and 75%,
respectively, compared to fi e-year older equipment.
Another technique to boost the energy efficien y of a BTS is to utilize off-transmission
periods on idle TCH time slots. In a modern base station the power amplifie (PA) of the
carrier unit is automatically switched off for unused radio time slots. Once the TCH time
slot is about to be allocated by the radio resource management (RRM) algorithm due to for
example call set-up or handover, the PA is automatically activated. The corresponding power
savings are of course a function of the radio time slot occupation. The highest savings can
be obtained in low traffi periods when there are more radio time slots that do not carry any
circuit-switched speech or user data. Depending on the hardware and traffi characteristics, the
reductions in power consumption from the above mechanism may vary between 20 W to 40 W
per TRX. Figure 13.33 illustrates the basic concept of efficien power amplifie management.
If the considered improvements are deployed together, the energy savings on a BTS site
may reach even 50–60%. Thus energy-aware hardware solutions are powerful means operators
have at hand to satisfy “green objectives” and improve the site energy efficien y while reducing
their energy bill.
13.7
Renewable Energy Sources
Further energy savings might be achieved by utilization of renewable energy sources, such
as the sun or wind. These are the “greenest” available solutions as the energy is harnessed
without any impact on the natural environment. Such solutions can be applied in specifi areas
only, that is where the natural environment guarantees enough energy production. The amount
of energy the solar power system can produce depends on the available periods of sunshine.

These vary depending on the geographical location, the season, the local weather and the time
of the day. In Europe, the average solar radiation is relatively low and it is strongly influence
by seasons. In the Sahel region, for instance, the solar radiation is significantl higher and
evenly distributed throughout the year. Depending on the latitude the sun strikes the surface
at different angles ranging from 0◦(just above the horizon) to 90◦(directly overhead at the
equator). Zones with the highest sun radiation are located mainly in Africa, Australia and
South America.
The efficien y of the solar power system depends also on the number of solar panels it is
composed of. Nevertheless, in areas with low sun radiation, even large solar panel constructions
do not guarantee the required amount of power. In addition, the additional space needed to
install them might not be available. Hence each power system has to be designed individually.
The number of solar panels has to be calculated assuming the expected power consumption
of the BTS configuration which is installed on-site. Then, the sunshine periods have to be
analyzed taking into account average conditions as well as the worst case scenario sunshine
point of view. Finally, solar panels have to be correctly installed to generate the highest output,
typically on the North–South axis and tilted as a function of latitude.
The solar power system is usually equipped with the following main elements: solar panels
(energy source), batteries (energy storage) and a system controller, which is responsible for
the correct charging of batteries and optimal sharing of the load between the solar panels and
the batteries (see Figure 13.34).
Solar systems operate on a fi ed 24-hour cycle: a peak sunny phase, a partly sunny phase
and a night phase. The peak phase covers full-load capacity and in this phase batteries are also
charged. The partly sunny phase uses 100% of the capacity with surplus energy supplied by
the batteries. While at the night phase, 100% of the load is drawn from the batteries.
Solar power systems can also be supplemented with a wind turbine. Such a solution guar-
antees higher efficien y of the system as the energy is harnessed from more than one source.
The wind turbine can be an option especially in coastal and mountain areas and generally in
locations of a particularly high elevation.

When a wind turbine is installed, the system controller decides which source of energy (sun
or wind component) should be used to produce the energy. Of course, both sources can be
utilized at the same time depending on the weather conditions. Batteries are employed when
both sources are inefficien (see Figure 13.35).
A solar/wind power system can continuously supply the BTS equipment with stable power
ranging from a few hundred watts up to several kilowatts. Importantly, the solar and wind
components of the power system do not require significan maintenance effort. They can be
remotely controlled and managed. Solar panels have to be cleaned every 4 to 6 months so their
efficien y is maintained.
13.8
Energy Savings for Controllers and Transcoders
Given the large number of BTSs in a GSM network, they constitute the main portion of the
energy consumed by a network. A small portion is due to Core Network equipment and only
a minor portion is due to controllers and transcoders (plus an additional percentage due to the
cooling process of the cabinets or rooms where these equipments are installed). Nevertheless,
energy savings in these equipments are also possible and worthwhile, even if on a smaller
scale compared to the radio network.
In the European Union and globally, growing pressure exists for higher energy efficien y.
For example the International Energy Agency (IEA) urges new policies to reduce the energy

consumption of Information Technology and Communication (ITC) equipments without refer-
ring to specifi products. Moreover, European projects, such as OPERA-net (Optimizing Power
Efficien y in Mobile Radio Networks), address the complete end-to-end cellular systems.
Also mobile operators are showing a growing interest in the energy consumption figure of
the whole radio access network, not only of the BTSs. Up to now, the optimization of controllers
and transcoders focused on features aimed at reducing costs and increasing equipment capacity,
with energy savings arising as a side effect of the parallel evolution of the component efficien y.
A more conscious step on the energy-saving path would be the use of new or existing
ad-hoc mechanisms to reduce the energy consumption of equipments. A possibility could be
to redesign controllers and transcoders in order to be able to work at higher room temperature,
thereby reducing the energy required by the cooling process. Another possibility could instead
be to “modulate” the hardware consumption with the shape of the managed traffic With this
approach, it would be possible to exploit the mechanisms available in components such as for
example a processor’s in-built technology that dynamically adapts processor speed according
to the computing load, or the execution of “IDLE” or “RESET” commands in DSPs (Digital
Signal Processors) when there is no traffi to process.
Another approach instead would be to power on and off cards via software, depending
on the handled traffi (load-based cards power on/off). As seen earlier in Section 13.5.2,
traffi changes with time. And usually voice and data traffi inactivity periods are different. In
general, it may be assumed that voice traffi is mainly present during the day while data traffi
is mainly concentrated in the late afternoon and evening hours (see Figures 13.36 and 13.37).
At present in both controllers and transcoders, all HW resources are active despite traffi
variations. As a result, their energy consumption remains almost constant during the whole
day and night.
The main idea of the load-based power on/off of cards approach is to exploit traffi load
variations by monitoring traffi requirements and powering only cards which are necessary to
manage the current traffi load. In practice, this means that the current traffi is clustered on
a subset of the available cards while the unused cards are powered off, thus saving energy. As
traffi increases, the required cards are powered on again.

In the case of controllers, such a mechanism may be applied to packet-switched and circuit-
switched services related cards. The maximum gain is obtained if the controller architecture
allows powering them off independently, thus fully exploiting the different inactivity periods.
In the case of transcoders, the above mechanism may be applied to speech transcoding cards
by following voice traffi variations.
Preliminary energy-saving evaluations performed both on processor’s speed adaptation
methods (based on load) and IDLE/RESET commands-based approaches have revealed minor
gains. However, a better performance has been observed in the case of load-based cards power
on/off mechanism. For example, considering the traffi reported in Figure 13.36 and Figure
13.37 where both PS and CS traffi are characterized by about 6 hours of inactivity, 9% of
energy saving is obtained independently of the configurations

Introduction
This chapter deals with standardization and deployment aspects of GSM Multi-carrier Base
Transceiver Stations (GSM MCBTS) in multimode networks.
The performance of GSM MCBTS has been standardized for a GSM/EDGE stand alone
network in 3GPP Release 8, see Chapter 3. As an extension of the multi-carrier concept,
the standardization of base stations in Multi-Mode networks is described hereafter referring
to the Release 9 feature related to the specificatio of the multi-standard multicarrier radio
base station (MSR) including a brief overview of the status in standardization and regulation.
Finally, the deployment of such a multi-carrier BTS supporting multiple 3GPP radio access
standards including impacts on radio resource management is shown. The introduction of base
stations based on the multi-carrier architecture provides the platform for operating multiple
3GPP radio access technologies simultaneously.
14.2
Standardization of MSR Base Station for Multimode Networks
A consequential extension of the multi-carrier GSM architecture, where a single wideband
transmitter and receiver is used for transmitting and receiving multiple GSM carriers, is the
establishment of a multi-standard architecture for a base station, that is to enable a base
station operating simultaneously different radio access technologies. In this respect 3GPP
opened the work item “RF requirements for Multi-carrier and Multi-RAT BS (MSR)” [1], in
September 2008. It aims at specifying the RF performance requirements of an MSR base station
equipment supporting multiple 3GPP radio access technologies (RAT) without touching the
baseband receiver performance specification The technical progress of this work is reflecte
in 3GPP TR 37.900 [3].

14.2.1
Motivation
The motivation to deploy multi-standard base stations is the fact that many mobile operators to-
day operate GSM (i.e. GSM/EDGE) and UMTS (i.e. UTRAN networks using WCDMA/HSPA
access) radio networks in parallel and may additionally deploy LTE (i.e. E-UTRAN) radio
networks in the coming years. MSR supports such migration path to allow higher bit rates and
larger RF bandwidths with minimum disruption to GSM/EDGE, that is the coverage network
which across the globe today accounts for over 4 billion subscribers (and growing fast). A
realistic exemplary migration in three phases is shown in Figure 14.1 for an operator with
licenses for GSM/EDGE, UMTS (i.e. UTRAN networks using WCDMA/HSPA access), and
LTE (i.e. E-UTRAN networks) substituting a part of the GSM spectrum with WCDMA/HSPA
spectrum in Phase 2 and later on replacing the UMTS spectrum with LTE in Phase 3.
The start of Phase 3 largely depends on the time of availability of E-UTRAN and the user
experience it provides (i.e. vs HSPA), as well as on the population of GSM-only mobiles in
the fiel at that time (including roaming users). Eventually all three RATs may be operated by
a MSR base station in the transition from Phase 2 to Phase 3.
Note that other migration paths exist such as a direct transition from Phase 1 to Phase 3
(i.e. UMTS skipped altogether), or from UTRAN to E-UTRAN (e.g. in Japan where GSM is
not deployed). The MSR standard is to cater for all migration paths, but from a GSM/EDGE
perspective, only the ones depicted above, that is from Phase 1 via Phase 2 to Phase 3, or from
Phase 1 directly to Phase 3, are relevant.
14.2.2
Deployment Scenarios
When standardizing the radio performance requirements for a MSR base station, the deploy-
ment scenarios need to be firs investigated. 3GPP RAN WG 4 has taken the approach of
definin frequency bands for MSR and classifying them into three band categories:

GSM in Multimode Networks
459
r Band Category 1 (BC1): MSR is define into frequency bands that simultaneously support
two RATs, namely UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN FDD.
r Band Category 2 (BC2): MSR is define in frequency bands that simultaneously support
three RATs, namely GSM/EDGE, UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN FDD.
r Band Category 3 (BC3): MSR is define in frequency bands that simultaneously support
two RATs, namely UTRAN TDD and E-UTRAN TDD.
It has to be noted that no mixture of FDD and TDD RATs is foreseen for MSR. Table 14.1
depicts the assignment of BC1 and BC2 band categories to paired frequency bands using FDD.
The support of GSM/EDGE is foreseen merely for Band Category 2 for GSM 850, E-GSM
900, DCS 1800 and PCS 1900 frequency bands.

Standardization in 3GPP GERAN
The standardization work for MSR is reflecte in the following documents:
r An overview of the specificatio impacts due to the standardization of the MSR base stations
is provided in the Work Item Technical Report 3GPP TR 37.900.
r The core specificatio for MSR radio performance is included in 3GPP TS 37.104 detailing
the TX and RX performance requirements for the specifie three band categories, both in

mixed RAT mode, that is MSR operates different RATs simultaneously and in single RAT
mode, that is MSR operates only one RAT.
r The MSR conformance testing is specifie in 3GPP TS 37.141, depicting the selected test
scenarios for the specifie three band categories BC1, BC2 and BC3.
3GPP GERAN is contributing to the work led by 3GPP RAN on MSR standardization for
equipment foreseen to support GSM/EDGE together with other 3GPP RATs dealt with in BC
2 category. The following aspects are treated in this context:
14.2.3.1
Manufacturer’s Declaration
The manufacturer’s declaration includes the declaration of the manufacturer related to the
total output power of the MSR BS, the maximum power per supported RAT and the maximum
carrier power as well as the maximum supported carrier number in case of a multi-carrier BS
for a specifi RAT. To allow a more fl xible power distribution in case of a multi-carrier BS
for a specifi RAT, the specificatio of a maximum power difference between multiple carriers
within one RAT is foreseen. According to TR 37.900, the manufacturer of a MSR base station
should declare the following parameters according to the supported RATs:
General parameters:
r supported band(s);
r the maximum RF bandwidth supported by a MSR BS within an operating band;
r the rated total output power as a sum over all RATs;
r maximum supported power difference between carriers;
RAT specifi parameters:
r whether the MSR BS supports GSM/UTRA or E-UTRA carriers;
r the maximum number of supported GSM/UTRA/E-UTRA carriers;
r the maximum RF bandwidth supported by the MSR BS when configure with GSM carriers
only/when configure
with UTRA carriers only/when configure
with E-UTRA carriers
only;
r which of the E-UTRA channel bandwidths specifie in TS36.104 clause 5.6 are supported;
r the rated output power for GSM/UTRA/E-UTRA as a sum of all GSM carriers/all UTRA
carriers/all E-UTRA carriers;
r the rated output power per GSM carrier/per UTRA carrier/per E-UTRA carrier.
14.2.3.2
MSR Single RAT Performance
Based on the work task description in GERAN [2] to adapt existing GERAN single RAT
requirements to an MSR specificatio aiming at minimizing changes to these requirements,
the MSR base station is required to exhibit almost the same performance as a GSM MCBTS
(either class 1 or class 2) if being operated in single RAT mode, that is if only GSM/EDGE is
operated by the MSR BS. The same is valid, if only UMTS or LTE is operated by the MSR
BS, where the existing requirements for the corresponding RAT apply.

ter intermodulation and unwanted emissions. Unwanted emissions can be distinguished into
operating band unwanted emissions which apply within the downlink operating band and in
addition the frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below this band and into transmitter
spurious emissions, define further apart from the used spectrum. For MSR BS transmitting
different 3GPP radio access technologies in one contiguous frequency block, that is applying
the mixed RAT mode, it is essential to defin the level of unwanted emissions. Figure 14.2
depicts an unwanted emission mask (UEM) for Band Category 2.
The unwanted emission is define outside the operating bandwidth, that is the RF bandwidth
of the MSR BS. In this scenario GSM/EDGE is allocated close to the upper RF bandwidth
edge, that is with an offset of 200 kHz for its centre frequency, thus requiring that the UEM
is based on the 8-PSK spectrum mask as used for EDGE, which is slightly relaxed compared
to the GMSK spectrum mask used for GSM. At 150 kHz the UEM needs to meet the UTRA
emission mask derived from a carrier power level of 43 dBm, which needs to be met in the
given scenario for the frequency range below the allocated frequency block, since UTRA or
E-UTRA (5 MHz and higher bandwidth) is operated close to the lower RF bandwidth edge,
and both have the same unwanted emission requirements.
Thus the unwanted emissions for MSR comprising the operating band unwanted emissions
as well as the transmitter spurious emissions are based on the emission mask of a UTRA
carrier with a carrier power level of 43 dBm. In the case of GSM carriers or a narrowband
E-UTRA carrier with 1.4 or 3 MHz bandwidth close to the RF bandwidth edge, the mask is
relaxed as shown in Figure 14.2, following the 8-PSK spectrum mask for this carrier power
level. The operating band unwanted emission mask and the spurious emission mask are hence
both based on absolute emission limits in dBm per 30 kHz or per 1 MHz depending on the
frequency offset from the RF bandwidth edge. It is noted that this definitio
of unwanted
emission requirements for MSR follows the principle of Block Edge Masks (BEM) as applied
in international standards, for example FCC Title 47 requirements in the US and requirements
in the “WAPECS” decision in Europe.

RX Requirements
RX requirements are define
in terms of receiver sensitivity level, dynamic range, inband
selectivity and blocking for a narrowband/wideband interferer, out-of-band blocking, receiver
intermodulation for a narrowband/wideband interferer as well as receiver spurious emissions
and in-channel selectivity (the latter only for E-UTRAN).
14.2.3.5
EMC Requirements
Electro-magnetic compatibility requirements in terms of conducted emissions and unwanted
radiated emissions of the equipment are also being specifie for MSR BS.
14.3
Status in Regulatory Bodies
Work on MSR in the regulatory bodies will start once 3GPP has completed the standardization.
The author’s expectation is that the work will start in the firs half of 2010. The Harmonized
Standard for MSR in Europe will be created by ETSI TC MSG TFES with the inclusion of
coexistence studies in CEPT ECC PT1. Due to the fact that MSR will use the same transmission
masks as applied for GSMMCBTS, UTRAN and E-UTRAN for single standard base stations,
the coexistence studies will have a limited scope only.
14.4
Use of MSR Base Stations in Multimode Networks
Multi-standard base stations operating different 3GPP radio access technologies are designed to
be employed in multimode networks. Typically an operator has a contiguous frequency alloca-
tion in a frequency band and aims at serving users connected via GSM/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA
and via LTE. Since the population of multimode terminals is expected to increase steadily in
the near future, the share of GSM only terminals will decrease and less capacity is needed for
GSM/EDGE traffic In this context, deployment of multi-standard base stations is advanta-
geous since migration of users connected via state-of-the-art RATs, such as GSM/EDGE and
WCDMA/HSPA, to most recent 3GPP RATs, such as HSPA+, Dual Cell HSPA and LTE, is
provided on a fl xible basis from the start without need for a later major upgrade of the radio
access network.
The expected increase of multimode terminals upholding two or more 3GPP RATs also gives
support to considerations of establishing a common radio resource management between the
different supported RATs. For instance, if the traffi load on GSM/EDGE carriers of such
MSR base station is high, the Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) may hand
over some users to UTRA or E-UTRA carriers, actually carrying lower traffi loads. This is
not a new mechanism, since common radio resource management between different single
RAT base stations was already introduced in 3GPP Release 5 by using the RAN Information
Management (RIM) procedure. The major difference here is that the same radio end point is
used for the handover and hence the handover can proceed in a faster way due to lower delays
for control plane signaling.
One technique being investigated in this context is spectrum sharing. Thus three operational
modes can be distinguished:

1. No spectrum sharing. This scenario is depicted in Figure 14.3. The operator deploys MSR
base stations serving different RATs, whereby each RAT has a dedicated allocation. For
instance, assume that GSM/EDGE and E-UTRA carriers may be operated by a MSR BS.
The GSM/EDGE allocation is reduced to one BCCH carrier as only the BCCH layer is
deployed. Nevertheless the RF bandwidth of the MSR base station needs to include the
complete BCCH layer, which may be as large as 2.4 MHz in case of BCCH reuse 12, the
precise allocation being the subject of network planning. For E-UTRA a frequency reuse
1 is assumed. An optional guard band may be used for higher isolation in downlink
reception. However, MSR base stations generally avoid such guard bands between different
RATs due to implicit coordination between RATs with MSR. If GSM/EDGE traffi needs
to be carried, there is only one solution left: the operator shifts dual mode terminals to
the RAT with higher throughput performance, that is to E-UTRA, to increase capacity for
GSM only terminals. Beyond this, no further fl xibility exists.
2. Static spectrum sharing. Static spectrum sharing allocates the same resources to differ-
ent RATs in a pre-assigned manner. For instance, the MSR base station may operate
GSM/EDGE and LTE in a specifi geographical area. Both spectrums are allocated next to
each other and typically no guard band is needed. If LTE traffi decreases or GSM/EDGE
traffi increases, some E-UTRA sub-carriers or resource blocks, respectively, will not be
needed and hence can be removed from the E-UTRA transmission. Note, only a restricted
subset of all E-UTRA sub-carriers may be nullified while the BCH allocation remains,
since neighbor cell measurements of E-UTRAN cells are based on all E-UTRA sub-carriers
belonging to the BCH allocation with a 1.4 MHz bandwidth. The resource of the nullifie
E-UTRA sub-carriers can be reused for carriers operating dedicated GSM/EDGE traffi

channels and is beneficia for increasing interference diversity in the case of activated GSM
slow frequency hopping. The spectrum sharing is considered static as the configuratio only
changes slowly over time, for example once per day between day and night operational
mode. An exemplary static spectrum sharing operation is shown in Figure 14.4.
3. Dynamic spectrum sharing. Dynamic spectrum sharing offers an even increased fl xibility
for adjusting the traffi loads in different RATs on top of static spectrum sharing. This is
achieved, for instance, by applying a time multiplex for the spectrum used by some E-
UTRA sub-carriers to be used both for LTE and GSM/EDGE networks. The joint common
radio resource management define the details for the time multiplex and the relevant E-
UTRA sub-carriers or E-UTRA resource blocks which are involved. An exemplary dynamic
spectrum sharing operation is shown in Figure 14.5.

Generic Access Network
Extending the GSM Paradigm

15.1
Introduction
Generic Access Network (GAN), introduced in 3GPP Release 6 [1, 2] may be the furthest
expansion of the GSM paradigm as it is not using GSM radio access at all to access GSM
services. Instead it relies on any generic IP access network hence its name, GAN.
The core idea of GAN is to securely convey all the GSM-based services such as voice, SMS
and data as well as GSM core network signaling (e.g. mobility management) over a generic
IP network while also supporting seamless mobility with GERAN and in later releases full
mobility with UTRAN as well.
15.2
Drivers for Convergence
The definitio of a generic access network was initially motivated by the Unlicensed Mobile
Access (UMA) Consortium and later adopted by 3GPP in Release 6 as “GAN”. Aiming
at offering GSM and GPRS services over an unlicensed radio access such as Wireless LAN
(WLAN), the primary drivers behind the UMA/GAN work (hereafter referred to as GAN) were:
r a desire to improve the existing cellular coverage (especially in the US) while faced
with the costs and difficult of new sites acquisition;
r the rapid growth in the penetration of fi ed broadband technologies;
r the availability of inexpensive and fast unlicensed radio technologies such as 802.11
(WLAN) and even Bluetooth;
r the threat to incumbent telecoms created by the expansion of (virtually) free internet VoIP
calling, in particular in the home environment.

15.2.1
Innovation on Top of Existing GSM Systems
The core innovation of GAN, and a precondition for its success, resides in its ability to reuse
the GSM core network capabilities (services and signaling functions) without any changes to
existing GSM network elements. That being said, it does not even require any changes to
this infrastructure to support active call mobility between these two accesses, GAN and GSM.
This is achieved by the camouflag ability of both the GAN access (GAN “cell”), which
appears as a GSM cell on the GSM radio interface, and of the GAN controller (GANC), which
appears as a BSC from the Core Network viewpoint, see Section 15.3.
15.3
GAN Architecture
15.3.1
General GAN Architecture
The general (simplified GAN architecture is depicted in Figure 15.1. GAN is characterized
by two new main elements: the GAN controller (GANC) and the Up interface (and associated
protocols) between the mobile station and the GANC.
The GANC implements the same A and Gb interfaces towards the core network as a
GSM BSC does. It is thus seen as a BSC by the core network, as is further explained in
Sections 15.3.2, 15.3.3, 15.3.4 and 15.3.5. It interfaces with the mobile station by means
of the Up interface, a secure interface which provides IP transport over a (typically un-
trusted) IP broadband access network such as a fi ed line broadband internet accompanied
by WLAN or Bluetooth unlicensed radio access. The GANC is therefore responsible, via a
security gateway (SEGW), for securely tunneling all traffi between the mobile station and the
GANC over the generic IP network while ensuring (seamless) mobility with cellular access
(GSM or even UMTS). In the following sub-sections, the required protocol architectures are
introduced.
Three types of GANC are defined each serving a specifi (logical) role and helping to
distribute the load in the system: the provisioning GANC, the default GANC and the serving
GANC:
1. Provisioning GANC. Located in the home network of a mobile station, the provisioning
GANC is the firs GANC contacted by the mobile when initially attempting to gain access
to GAN. The contact details of the provisioning GANC reside in the phone itself, or can
be derived from information on the SIM card. This GANC supplies the mobile station with
the contact details (e.g. IP address) of the default GANC to which it can register.

2. Default GANC. Located in the home network of a mobile station, the default GANC
indicated by the provisioning GANC is the one to which the mobile station registers for
GAN access, see Section 15.4.3. Upon successful registration, the default GANC may
redirect the mobile to a more suitable serving GANC in the same or different network as
required or may itself become the serving GANC.
3. Serving GANC. Located in the home network of a mobile station or in a visited network, it
provides the registered mobile with GAN services. The serving GANC may also redirect
the mobile station as necessary to a different serving GANC.
15.3.2
CS Control Plane Protocol Architecture in GAN
As illustrated in Figure 15.2, the GAN CS control plane protocol architecture is characterized
by the transparent exchange of GSM mobility management and other core network signaling
between the mobile station and the MSC and the reuse as is of the A interface and its protocols.
The Up interface provides the actual GAN-related protocols GA-RC1 and GA-CSR.2 GA-RC
manages the IP connection between the GANC and the MS including the GANC registration
procedures. GA-CSR performs an equivalent though lighter functionality to that of GSM-RR;
it provides bearer establishment for circuit-switched traffic mobility between GERAN and
GAN such as handover, and other functions such as paging, etc.
All this signaling traffi is then sent through an IPsec3 tunnel providing a secure link between
the MS and the GANC over the IP transport and thus overcoming any potential security issue
over the Generic IP network. No assumption is indeed taken as to which access layer is used
for the Generic IP network. In practical implementations it is in most cases 802.11 wireless
(Wireless LAN). In some implementations Bluetooth radio or even Ethernet wired connection
have also been used.

One of the key functionalities of GAN is the ability to switch between cellular connectivity
and GAN connectivity. In the terminal, this requires a corresponding coordination between
GA-CSR and GSM RR protocols for mobility. This capability is well illustrated in Figure 15.3
describing the mobile station’s internal architecture (GSM and GAN).
The access mode switch is used to switch between the radio interfaces (GSM and GAN) as
a function of their availability and the preferred access mode set in the mobile. There are four
different (self-explanatory) access modes: GAN preferred, GAN only, GERAN preferred and
GERAN only (see Section 15.4.4). In practical implementations the mode “GAN preferred”
is maybe the most used, as it enables GAN to be used whenever the IP connectivity to the
GANC is available in a given location.

CS User Plane Protocol Architecture in GAN
As illustrated in Figure 15.4, the GAN CS user plane protocol architecture is characterized
by the reuse as is of the A interface and its protocols and by the use of RTP/UDP to convey
user traffi between the mobile station and the GANC. The user traffi can be voice, data or
even CS video telephony. CS video can be emulated over GAN in the same way as “CS voice”
is conveyed over the GAN IP-based bearer. Figure 15.4 represents the user plane protocol
architecture for voice specificall but in principle the same figur also applies to the CS video
call case.
The only speech codec mandated in GAN is narrowband AMR (full rate codec). However,
the specificatio also allows use of other codec such as AMR Wide Band (AMR-WB), poised
for deployment in GSM networks at the time of writing.
As in the case of the control plane, all user traffi encapsulated within RTP/UDP is then
sent through the IPsec tunnel and over the underlying Generic IP network.
15.3.4
PS Control Plane Protocol Architecture in GAN
As illustrated in Figure 15.5, the GAN PS control plane protocol architecture is characterized
by the transparent exchange of GPRS LLC and upper layers’ protocol information between
the mobile station and the SGSN and the reuse as is of the Gb interface and its protocols.
The Up interface provides in addition to GA-RC (see Section 15.3.2), GA-PSR.4 GA-PSR
performs an equivalent but narrower functionality to that of the GSM-RLC protocol though
adapted to operation over an IP connection.
Similar to the CS side, the ability of terminals to switch between GPRS connectivity and
GAN connectivity is illustrated in Figure 15.6, where the necessary coordination between
GA-PSR and GPRS (RLC/)MAC protocols for mobility is also represented.

GAN Management Functionality
15.4.1
Modes of Operation: GAN or Cellular
Knowing the possible states of a GAN-capable mobile station is essential to understand its
behavior in different situations. Two modes are define guiding the operation of the GAN-
capable MS:
1. GERAN(/UTRAN) mode (default), when the MS is not in GAN mode and is seeking access
to or being served by GERAN (or UTRAN).
2. GAN mode, when the MS is served by a GANC.
The MS can be in only one mode of operation at a time. Note, however, that, despite this,
a mobile station for example in GERAN(/UTRAN) mode served by a GSM cell, potentially
with an ongoing call, can at the same time seek GAN connectivity. “Dual-radio” operation5 is
indeed assumed for GAN as there is no coordination between the 3GPP radio access and the
generic access which can use practically any IP access. The wide and growing availability of
GSM mobiles supporting multi-radio operation using Bluetooth and possibly Wireless LAN

demonstrate the feasibility of this assumption. The use of dual-radio in GAN is, however,
transparent to the user as the services are always provided through a single access at a time.
15.4.2
Authentication
As the MS approaches the GANC over the generic IP access, there is a need to verify and
confir
the subscriber’s identity before granting it access to the GSM network and its services.
The authentication procedure in GAN is based on the same GSM credentials on the SIM card
as used in GSM authentication. To this end, the EAP-SIM6 protocol along with the Internet
Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol are utilized.7 On the network side the credentials
are authenticated using the security gateway residing in the GANC (GANC-SEGW) interfaced
with an AAA8 -server having access to the subscriber’s information in the authentication center
or HLR9 of the network. See Figure 15.8. Upon completion of the authentication procedure, a
secure signaling link is achieved between the MS and the GANC after which registration can
proceed.
15.4.3
GAN Registration Procedure
Upon successful authentication and establishment of a secure signaling link with GAN, the
mobile station (in GERAN/UTRAN mode) then needs to perform registration in order later
to be able to access and receive GSM services through the appropriate (serving) GANC.
Registration serves indeed two main purposes:
r For the MS to inform the GAN network that it is now cleared (i.e. authenticated) and can be
reached in a secured way over GAN.
r For the network to select the appropriate GANC through which GSM services will be
accessed by the MS, that is the serving GANC and notify the MS accordingly, so it is able
to enter GAN mode (“rove-in”).

Generic Access Network: Extending the GSM Paradigm
473
Upon successful registration, the mobile station is informed of the parameters that camouflag
the GAN access (GAN “cell”) as a fake GSM cell in the GSM network, that is an ARFCN10
and a BSIC.11 This information can then be used by the GSM network and the mobile station
with no impact on GSM signaling for mobility between GSM and GAN. Of course, to ensure
the correct operation, these parameters must not conflic with those of existing GSM cells in
the network (or at minimum with those of neighboring GSM cells of a GSM cell with which
GAN interaction is possible). The simplest alternative is thus to select a unique ARFCN, BSIC
pair across the entire network, to ensure the GAN access is always identifie in the same way.
15.4.4
Mode Selection in Multimode Terminals
As discussed earlier, there are two main modes of operation for a Generic Access capable
terminal: GAN mode and GERAN(/UTRAN) mode. After a normal power up procedure, a
Generic Access capable terminal enters GERAN/UTRAN mode, after which it may enter
GAN mode as a function of user and/or operator configurabl preferences as follows:
r GAN preferred: the most used preference mode as the GAN terminal enters GAN mode
whenever available (i.e. upon successful registration with the GANC).
r GAN only: this may be desired, for example if cellular use is not wanted. In GAN only mode,
there is no handover to the cellular network. This implies that the full range of a certain
access point, for example WLAN access point is perceived by the user.
r GERAN/UTRAN only: with this preference the GAN MS is not attempting to enter GAN
mode at all. This may be desired, for example if the user wants to use the CS video call
feature over UTRAN and that is not supported over GAN in the terminal. It may also be
used as the initial sales package setting in the terminal when the GAN service activation has
not been provisioned to it yet.
r GERAN/UTRAN preferred: this mode is typically not required by GAN-enabled operators
and thus not supported in mobile stations’ implementations either. There are very few real-
life scenarios where this mode would be beneficial The most potential use case might be
when the cellular network has poor coverage and GAN is then used to fil coverage holes
in a kind of “back-up” mode. In practice, however, “GAN preferred” also addresses this
situation and does it more elegantly.
15.4.5
PLMN Selection
Principally the PLMN selection is unaffected by the introduction of GAN, that is the same
mechanisms as used in GSM do apply. A GANC can be connected to only one PLMN. The
available PLMNs for a mobile station are listed for GAN and GERAN/UTRAN separately. In
some cases, more than one GANC-PLMN pairs is offered to the mobile station at registration.
If the currently used PLMN in GERAN/UTRAN is among those, it is selected. Otherwise the
selection is made based on implementation specifi criteria. So the saying “the devil is in the
detail” applies here as well.

Mobility Features in GAN
15.5.1
Idle Mode Mobility
Mobility between GAN and GSM in idle mode, that is when no active user transaction is
ongoing is carried out by “rove-in” in the direction from GSM to GAN and “rove-out” in the
opposite direction. Both almost always involve a switch between GERAN(/UTRAN) mode
and GAN mode. Actually the idea of “rove in/out” is very close to the cell reselection procedure
in the GSM networks. It is also worth noting that inbound mobility to GAN is only possible
following successful registration to the GANC.
15.5.1.1
Rove-In
While in GERAN mode, following successful GANC registration, the mobile station is able to
autonomously switch to GAN mode, that is “rove in” provided its mobility in the GSM network
is not under control of the network. Once the access mode is switched to GAN mode (see Fig-
ures 15.3 and 15.6), the upper layers (mobility management) are notifie that the mobile station
is now served solely by GAN, that is the GSM radio protocols in the mobile no longer interact
with upper layers. This means that for example possible mobile-terminated call paging is to be
received from this point onwards via GAN not GSM. However, it should be noted that typically
the GSM radio still needs to measure neighboring cells from time to time in order to maintain
the possibility for mobility back to GSM (if needed). In GAN-only mode, this feature can be
disabled and a so-called GSM radio hibernation can be applied to save the terminal’s battery.
15.5.1.2
Rove-Out
While in GAN mode, the mobile station may monitor neighboring GERAN/UTRAN cells.
When a suitable cell is known and upon loss or detachment of the IP connection, the mobile
station may rove out of the GAN “cell” and restore normal GSM operation. Once the access
mode is switched to GERAN mode (see Figures 15.3 and 15.6), the upper layers are notifie
that the mobile station is now served solely by the GSM access network.
It is worth noting that de-registration from the GANC may not occur when roving out.
Indeed, the generic IP connection may be lost so suddenly that there is no time to de-register,
for example when losing WLAN coverage on entering an elevator. However, in such a case,
the GANC will automatically detect it has lost contact with the mobile station and then make
an implicit GAN de-registration.
It should be noted as well that if the mobile station was in GAN-only mode (Section 15.4.4),
it will inevitably remain in GAN-mode indicating “no service”.
15.5.2
Active Mode Mobility
Mobility between GAN and GERAN/UTRAN in active mode, that is, when a transaction is
ongoing between the mobile station and the network,12 is handled by means of (network-
controlled) cell reselection (for non time critical data) or handover (for time critical data e.g.
voice call). In the direction from GSM to GAN, the role played by camouflagin the GAN

“cell” as a fake GSM cell (see Section 15.4.3) is essential for it allows not only the mobile to
request mobility to GAN, but also the network to order the mobile to move to GAN.

When under network control, active mode mobility in a GSM network relies on the mobile
station reporting measurements to its serving cell. These include measurements of the signal
level or signal quality of neighboring cells,13 as well that of the serving cell. The neighboring
cells with the best signal are reported. Based on these measurement reports and other policies,
the network is then able to select the best cell to which the mobile should go. Since GAN relies
on a generic IP network, the signal level of the neighboring GAN “cell” (i.e. fake GSM cell)
listed by the network cannot as such be measured and reported using the “GSM scale” results.
Instead the mobile station in GERAN mode, successfully registered to the GANC, always
reports a superb signal level for the GAN “cell”, that is in practice the maximum possible
level in the “GSM scale”. This indicates a request from the mobile station to the cellular (e.g.
GSM) network to move to GAN. The network may then order cell re-selection or handover to
GAN as appropriate. The cleverness of this scheme is two-fold: this way the MS always gets
to GAN when it has been successfully registered to it (in the background); and it is achieved
with no changes to existing network elements.
15.5.2.2
Network-Controlled Cell Re-Selection
Network-controlled cell re-selection in active mode only occurs in the direction from
GERAN/UTRAN to GAN and during an ongoing packet data session. Upon reception of
a measurement report for the GAN “cell”, the network may order the mobile station to move
to the GAN “cell”, that is “rove-in”. The latencies of this operation are quite tolerable for most
use cases such as web browsing since the GAN connection has already been established in
the background and thus the needed time for the re-selection is in the range of similar plain
GSM/GPRS operation.
15.5.2.3
Handover
Because handover ensures seamless mobility, it is a necessary mechanism for services that
have tight delay requirements such as a voice call.
In the case of a cellular network for example GSM-to-GSM handover, all resources in the
new cell and in the core network are assigned prior to the mobile station being handed over to
that cell, thus guaranteeing the service gap is minimal. It is the responsibility of the network
to assign and indicate these resources to the mobile station before it arrives in the cell.
In the case of GSM-to-GAN handover as dual-radio operation is used (see Section 15.4.1),
there is no need to assign and indicate the (GAN) resources to the mobile station before it
arrives in the GAN “cell”. The connection path between the core network and the GANC
must, however, be properly set up before handing over the mobile to GAN. The mobile station
is able to maintain the ongoing voice call in the GSM cell until the call is fully established
through the GANC.
13 Only neighboring cells listed by the GSM cell may be measured and reported by the mobile station.

476
GSM/EDGE
In the case of GAN-to-GSM handover, the same principles as in a GSM-to-GSM handover
are used. All resources are assigned in the target GSM cell prior to the mobile station being
handed over to that cell. Unlike the previous handover cases, however, it is the mobile that
triggers the handover. The trigger may be for example a weak signal level from the WLAN
access point, or an indication from the GANC that based on measurements on the RTP layer, the
uplink voice quality is problematic, etc. depending on implementation decisions. Upon such
a trigger occurring, the mobile station explicitly requests a handover from the GANC, after
which the GANC proceeds with the handover in the same manner as a normal GSM-to-GSM
handover. In its firs release (Release 6), GAN-to-UMTS handover was supported in a similar
manner as a GAN-to-GSM handover, and using the same principles as in a GSM-to-UMTS
handover.
15.6
Voice Service over GAN
Voice telephony traffi in GAN is very similar to Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic AMR voice
frames are packetized by the Real Time Protocol (RTP) and then carried over UDP/IP packets.
However, the voice traffi stream going through the IPsec tunnel voice security in GAN is
higher than in average internet VoIP. The most usual voice sample transmission period in GAN
is 20 ms as in GSM, but also longer periods such as 40 ms can be supported, at the expense of
end-to-end latency. The benefi from the longer sample period would be an improved power
saving on the air interface. As the voice traffi in GAN is packet-based, it also requires a related
jitter buffer to mitigate the fact that the voice packets may arrive at the receiver’s end in the
wrong order as well as at different intervals. The length and characteristics of the jitter buffer
are an implementation-specifi topic. The GAN specification also include an RTP redundancy
feature where the reception certainty at the receiving end is increased by including with each
voice packet the nth and (n −1)th speech frame at the senders’ end. Thus if some of the packets
are lost, the receiving end can still receive the lost piece of voice data from the consecutive
RTP packet.
15.7
Supplementary Services and SMS over GAN
15.7.1
Supplementary Services
GSM specification have a large amount of standardized Supplementary Services (SS) (see
Chapter 1). The DTAP14 signaling related to SS is relayed over GAN like any layer 3 level call
control or other signaling. So in most cases there are no changes to the existing SS offering
over GAN.
It is worth noting that in practice, the implementation of certain supplementary services
such as “Call Hold” will also require following all relevant RTP related IETF RFCs,15 where,
for example, the use of Silence Insertion Descriptor (SID) frames during a discontinuous
transmission (DTX) mode is specified Another example is to address requirements which
may be relevant only for some regions. For example, the US Text Telephony (TTY), which

Generic Access Network: Extending the GSM Paradigm
477
can be implemented over the GAN voice channel, requires additional implementation work
compared to simple DTAP signaling-based SS message relaying over GAN.
15.7.2
SMS
SMS is always conveyed over GAN when the MS is in GAN mode. Typically the implemen-
tation of the application layer for SMS service in the mobile station remains intact. Also the
network side implementation is straightforward as the A interface carries the SMS traffi as
usual. In principle, also “SMS over GPRS (over GAN)” could be supported but this has not
been seen so far in practical implementations.
Furthermore, the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) can be supported as a combination
of SMS and packet data support over GAN. Packet data support is further explained in the
following section.
15.8
Packet Switched Data (GPRS) over GAN
Even if predominantly thought to carry voice, GAN also supports packet data (GPRS-like)
connections by default. The introduction of GPRS support over GAN in the network is quite
straightforward as the same GANC supports the standard Gb interface towards a 3GPP standard
SGSN network element, see Section 15.3.1. On the device side, there is practically no impact
on applications using GPRS normally as they can continue using any GPRS APN16 over GAN
access. The decision on whether to use the GSM or the GAN access parts is taken on the
(lower layer) access mode switch as already described in Figure 15.6.
It is worth noting that since the early days of GPRS, the maximum bit rate of the Gb
interface has increased not only to benefi from the evolution of the underlying access, for
example higher WLAN bit rate in GAN, but also to prevent this interface from being a
bottleneck. The improved Gb interface can support up to 1000 times faster traffi than initially
defined In practice, it implies that Gb can accommodate more terminals with higher bitrates.
Earlier the maximum supported peak rate was 6 Mbit/s, that is supporting at most six mobile
stations with 1 Mbit/s each. Now it is up to 6 Gbit/s, so virtually any speed can be achieved,
that is the throughput is no longer limited by the capacity of the Gb interface.
So where are the throughput limits of the GAN PS connectivity set then? If the radio access
used in GAN is, for example, IEEE 802.11g, it can accommodate an air interface throughput
of around 25 Mbit/s (theoretical maximum of 54 Mbit/s) which is thus definitel
not the
limiting factor in this case either. With GAN, the GPRS upper layer frames are packed on top
of UDP frames which then are carried through the IPsec tunnel over the 802.11g access. This
multilayered protocol stack cuts some of the perceived end user performance but is typically
at least on a par with the best case EGPRS or WCDMA perceived throughputs, in the order of
a few hundreds of kbit/s.
A typical operator requirement for GAN today is 256–600 kbit/s. A GAN MS can easily
reach 1 Mbit/s and actually even 2 Mbit/s is feasible with the current even mid-priced mobile
engines. Some further throughput improvements are expected with GAN Release 8 adding
UTRAN Iu-interface support (with a slightly thinner UMTS-PS protocol stack).

15.9
Emergency Call Support in GAN
There is an operator-selectable option to prefer emergency calls either over GAN or over
GERAN/UTRAN access. If the access network preference is GERAN/UTRAN, the mobile
station must switch to GERAN/UTRAN mode when attempting to place an emergency call.
This is in order to provide also the location information data of the terminal through the
GERAN/UTRAN network.
Even if the network preference for emergency call is GAN, it is recommended but not
mandatory to switch to GERAN/UTRAN mode if there is not sufficien location information
available via GAN. The GAN location information can be based on A-GPS17 location infor-
mation or on the location information associated with the point of IP network attachment (e.g.
at the accuracy of BSSID18 of the used access point). This latter method, however, requires
an information database maintained by the GAN operator in question, for example to map the
BSSID with given locations.
There are also region-specifi rules such as E911 from the US authority FCC which need
to be taken into account when implementing an emergency call in GAN terminal as well.
15.10
GAN in 3GPP Releases
15.10.1
GAN in Release 6
GAN was initially introduced in 3GPP Release 6 [1, 2] after adoption of UMA work to 3GPP.
In practice, the firs Release 6 GAN corresponds to the very last UMA Consortium release
1.0.4. Although not part of UMA Release 1.0.4, GAN Release 6 supports also Cell Broadcast.
15.10.2
GAN in Release 7
GAN was expanded in Release 7 mainly by the addition of circuit-switched video telephony
and packet-switched handover. The support in GAN of the same 64 kbit/s CS video telephony
bearer as used in for example UMTS is emulated over similar RTP/UDP over IP methods as
used for a voice call, and as described earlier in Section 15.3.3. In practice, however, a native
IP-based video calling application could, of course, be better suited for GAN which is an
IP-based system.
GAN mobility procedures in active mode are also complemented by the addition of packet-
switched handover. Similar to CS handover, PS handover allows seamless mobility between
cellular access and GAN for packet data services with tight delay requirements.
Also, as previously mentioned, the definitio of the “Gigabit Gb interface” (between a BSC
or a GANC and an SGSN), see section 15.8, means that the achievable data rates over the
radio access are no longer limited by the capacity of the Gb interface. It also means that more
mobiles can be supported. For GAN, this means that more mobiles can use better data rates
over the generic IP network for packet data transmission.

15.10.3
GAN in Release 8
The major addition to GAN in Release 8 is that of the Iu interface, that is “GAN Iu”, enabling
the expansion of GAN within UMTS, using the same principles as when GAN was introduced
in GSM. It also offers full (Iu) mobility procedures with UTRAN. With GAN Iu, GAN has also
been promoted as a “femto” technology while it fulfill an essential requirement of attachment
to the core network in a standardized, secure and easily scalable manner.
Beneficia to GAN network implementation, the specificatio of IP transport for the user-
plane traffi
over the A interface (complementing that of the control plane specifie
in
Release 7), as seen in Chapter 3, means it is also better suited to carry GAN user plane
AMR/UDP/IP packets.
15.11
Implementation Aspects for a GAN-enabled Device
Whereas the GAN impact in the network side can be isolated almost to one new network
element (GANC), the impact on the MS can be listed as follows:
r Off-the-shelf type of features or components like a (standard) WLAN radio, TCP/IP stack,
IPsec tunneling with IKEv2, etc. which in most cases can already be present but that may
require some further tweaking because of the real-time and mobility aspects of the services
running over GAN.
r A few fairly simple protocols and functionalities accommodating the signaling between the
3GPP core and the “IP world”.
r Complementary parts for the product creation such as user-interface menus related to GAN
and WLAN, new icons to distinguish GAN access from cellular access (e.g. a “house”
symbol indicating all incoming and outgoing traffi goes through GAN), and also items
related to out-of-the-box experiences such as provisioning for the service or any kind of
tutorial when putting it into use.
15.12
Considerations for GAN Deployment
15.12.1
Systematic Approach to GAN Set-up
The system is as strong as its weakest link is a rule that applies also to telecommunication
systems such as GAN. The high quality implementation of both the GANC network entity as
well as its sub-entity SEGW is highly significant given the deployment of GAN within an
existing system.
Going towards the MS, there needs to be an IP network providing sufficien bandwidth for
the GAN operation. In practice, the minimum throughput for the bidirectional voice over GAN
service is in the range of 100 kbps, whereas for packet data over GAN the throughput of the
used IP network should be at a minimum 350–400 kbps to accommodate the typically required
256 kbps user perceived data speed for GAN. Normally the throughput of the IP network is
not an issue as even the lowest fi ed-line broadband connections are sufficient A more severe
impact, however, can be noted in the voice quality if the IP network is badly congested. In
this case there can be gaps in the voice which even a good jitter buffer implementation cannot

480
GSM/EDGE
cope with. As stated earlier, there are ways in the mobile station to detect such an abnormal
situation and make a request for handover to GSM.
In most GAN implementations so far, the dominant radio access technology used between
the IP broadband network (such as ADSL) and the mobile station is based on 802.11 WLAN.
802.11 WLAN is specifie under the IEEE regime but in addition the Wi-Fi Association has
define additional feature sets and is also facilitating testing plug-fests for those feature sets.
It is highly recommended to follow these definition and to conduct the necessary testing for
them. Indeed, there is quite a lot of variance in the performance of different WLAN chipset
products which means that, if not carefully verified the WLAN “cell” range may be shorter
than planned. Also the parameterization of handovers between cellular and GAN must be done
properly to exploit the WLAN range, while avoiding the increase of handover failures and call
drops.
The MS supporting GAN at the end of production line is not ready for GAN service at start-
up for the firs time unless it is provisioned with operator-specifi settings (e.g. provisioning
GANC contact details including SEGW) and a certificat from a (trusted) Certificat Authority
for security reasons. However, these can also be provided over-the-air at a later phase (e.g. the
CA certificat can be securely located with the help of a mobile browser). Assuming that there
is no additional operator-specifi feature needed, this is in principle sufficien to start GAN
service with the mobile.
