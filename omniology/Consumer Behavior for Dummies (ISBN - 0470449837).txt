About the Author
Laura A. Lake has been involved in the marketing industry since 1997. 
She brings a fresh, easy-to-understand perspective to consumer behavior. 
Despite popular belief, the understanding of consumer behavior can even 
benefi t small companies, because it enables them to market more effectively 
by meeting the needs of the buyers in the marketplace. The end result is a 
higher rate of success; this is where Laura fi nds her passion.
Laura has helped many companies understand consumer behavior and the 
management and implementation of the fi ndings within. Understanding why 
consumers purchase, consume, or dispose of products is invaluable as the 
battle for customers intensifi es day by day. Laura consults with companies 
to emphasize the importance of investing in research to determine why cus-
tomers think, feel, reason, and ultimately purchase from among alternative 
products or services.
Laura serves as the current marketing columnist at About.com, a New York 
Times Company. She shares her extensive marketing knowledge in more than 
600 articles published on some 4,000 Web sites and in various publications. 
She’s also a featured writer in several magazines. As if that weren’t enough 
to keep her busy, Laura has served in director and vice president positions 
for well-known advertising agencies in previous years. In 2008, she founded 
her own successful marketing agency and sales training company. She now 
advises companies on how to create and implement effective marketing strat-
egies that help them grow their businesses.

Dedication
As most authors will tell you, it takes much more than just them to write a 
book. It’s a collaborative effort between you and those who encourage you 
to do the work it takes to get the book done. I had several people by my side 
along the way, and without them the possibility of fi nishing would have been 
impossible.
First and foremost I must thank my mom and dad, Jack and Jill Brown, for 
pushing me to live my dreams and follow my heart. Even if it seemed at times 
I wouldn’t make it, you always believed.
A special thanks goes to my son Taylor. You’ve always believed and stood 
by me, even when change was diffi cult. You are my daily inspiration and 
the person who creates the drive to keep me moving forward. You never 
complain when it comes to the long hours that I work, and throughout the 
entire process of writing this book you were patient and understanding. 
We’ve come a long way, and your sacrifi ces have not gone unnoticed. Your 
patience, your love, your hugs, and your encouragement made the long hours 
spent in the offi ce a little easier to bear.
Also, a big thanks goes to Abby. You made me smile when you understood 
that the hours locked away in the offi ce would one day produce a book that 
you would see in the stores. Here it is! Thank you to my business partner 
Jamie Verkamp as well. You held down the fort and made things happen 
when my attention was elsewhere. You kept our business going and growing 
without skipping a beat. You were always encouraging during sharp dead-
lines, and you never complained when you had to pick up the slack. I couldn’t 
have picked a better partner. To you I am grateful, and I couldn’t think of a 
better person to share success with.
Last, but not least, thank you to my circle of friends: Hilda, Lori, Vicky, 
Kay, Rhonda, and Angel. You have pushed me through the trying times and 
encouraged me to keep moving forward. Your words of encouragement, 
e-mails, and telephone calls always came at the right times. Thank you for 
sharing your knowledge, your experiences, and your lives with me over the 
years.
To those who were affected by my crankiness, absenteeism, and requests for 
silence: I fi nally did it! Thank you all. You will never know the impact you had 
and the important roles that you played in the completion of this project. Not 
even words could express my gratitude.

Author’s Acknowledgments
I must acknowledge the people who made this book possible and who made 
writing easier. Of course, no one ever said this would be easy.
Huge thanks goes to my project editor, Kristin DeMint, from Wiley Publishing. 
Thank you for the support, encouragement, guidance, and patience during 
the course of this project. Just the mere fact that you had to read every 
page of this book and make sense of it in its initial draft form means that you 
deserve a Medal of Honor!
And to my literary agent, Barbara Doyen, thank you for keeping me on track, 
answering my questions, and guiding me through the process of writing this 
book. I couldn’t have done it without you!

Consumer Behavior For Dummies 
xviii

Introduction
C
onsumer behavior is way more than just a guessing game; it’s crucial 
to a successful marketing plan. A clear understanding of the consumer 
usually makes the difference between companies that succeed and those 
that fail. By understanding the behaviors of consumers, you can make more 
informed business decisions; these decisions alone can raise bottom-line 
revenues, lower customer acquisition costs, and increase customer retention 
and profitability.
The study of consumer behavior tells you why consumers act the way they 
do, why they buy what they buy, and why they buy from who they buy from. 
It’s the study of the external and internal influences that affect consumers 
in purchasing decisions. Consumer behavior also shows the marketing influ-
ence that businesses have on consumers.
Consumer behavior is a subjective topic, so there are no absolutes. The only 
absolute is the fact that consumers are influenced by psychological and 
sociocultural factors. However, not all consumers are affected in the same 
capacity. Luckily, by understanding a few processes, you can gain the type of 
insight about consumers that helps your business market succeed and stand 
out from the competition.
If you want to succeed in your marketing, you have to understand why a par-
ticular consumer thinks, acts, and responds in the way that he does. Then 
you create an effective marketing strategy that accommodates those feelings, 
actions, and responses.
When you hear of consumer behavior, you probably begin thinking of big 
words, hard-to-understand formulas, and dry explanations of research meth-
ods. My approach is different. I show you how to take a look at a consumer 
as an individual and evaluate the influences he may be experiencing. I then 
teach you how to direct your marketing strategy so it’s effectively based on 
the influence the consumer may be experiencing. Plenty of books on con-
sumer behavior are available, but they’re written in textbook style. My goal 
with Consumer Behavior For Dummies is to bring consumer behavior to you 
on a level that’s easy to understand and applicable to your business. I don’t 
talk theories. I talk actionable items that you can put into place today.
This book can be used as a tool to not only gain the knowledge of consumer 
behavior, but also to better understand and “speak” to your customer.

  Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
The gray-shaded text boxes throughout this book are what the For Dummies 
folks affectionately refer to as sidebars, and they contain helpful or inter-
esting information that you don’t need to know in order to understand the 
important concepts at hand. I wrote them, of course, so I recommend that 
you do read them. But if you’re pressed for time or just not in the mood for 
extras, feel free to skip on over them.
Foolish Assumptions
When I was writing this book, I kept a few assumptions in mind about you, 
the reader. These assumptions kept me on track so that I provided the most 
useful and pertinent information. Here’s what I assume about you:
 
✓ You have an interest in why consumers behave the way they do, and 
you have a desire to understand the influences that affect consumers 
when it comes to their purchase patterns.
 
✓ You want to use that knowledge to influence consumers in an ethical 
way to purchase from you or the business you work for.
 
✓ You have an interest in marketing because you have your own business, 
you’re studying marketing in school, you work in a marketing depart-
ment at a company, or you desire a career change where you will have 
the ability to influence consumers.
 
✓ You have an interest in psychology either to understand your own pur-
chasing behavior or to people watch and understand why consumers 
act the way they do.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is chock-full of information, research techniques, marketing tips, and 
easy-to-understand advice that helps you understand the power of consumer 
behavior and how you can use it to not only better understand your market 
but to better market your own business. The six parts in this book are orga-
nized so you can find the information you need quickly. Determine what you 
need to know and head to that part. Here’s a rundown of the different parts.
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior
Part I fills you in on the basics of consumer behavior. I outline the consumer 
decision-making process and show you why consumer behavior is important

Consumer Behavior For Dummies 
to your marketing strategy. You find out how to use the knowledge of con-
sumer behavior to determine your ideal segments and target market. I also 
explore the different research methods with you.
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology 
of the Individual Consumer
In this part, you take a deeper look into the individual customer. You get the 
scoop on the internal influences that affect the way consumers behave, and 
you discover how to work with those influences. I show you the power of 
perception and motivation and explain how attitude and intentions affect the 
purchasing decision. You can even read about how self-concepts, situation 
influences, and lifestyle change the behavior of your customer.
Part III: Consumers in Their Social  
and Cultural Settings
Social and cultural settings have an effect on your customer. So in this part, 
I discuss the external influences that affect consumers and their purchasing 
patterns. These influences include those from cultures, subcultures, groups, 
family life cycles, and household structures. I also delve into the misbehav-
iors of consumers and show you what you can do to protect yourself against 
those misbehaviors.
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy
In Part IV, you get to make your consumer knowledge applicable to your 
business. This is the part where you put the knowledge you’ve gained regard-
ing the influences of consumers to work. I show you how to focus on the 
core pieces of your marketing strategy by taking a peek at market research, 
identifying your key segments, and successfully finding and launching into 
untapped markets.
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy 
with a Marketing Plan
In this part, I help you put all the pieces together. You create your marketing 
plan by using the consumer behavior knowledge that you’ve discovered. This 
isn’t just any ordinary marketing plan, however. This is a plan that’s created 

5
  Introduction
by understanding your customer more than you ever have before. You find 
out how to influence the perception of your consumers, educate your con-
sumers, and create positioning strategies that are effective and successful. I 
also show you the process of new product adoption and help you encourage 
your customers be loyal and to come back often. Finally, I round out this part 
with some information on marketing ethics.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part are short, but full of great info. For example, because 
customer communication is key when it comes to consumer loyalty and repeat 
buying, I give you ten easy ways to communicate with your customers and 
ensure their satisfaction. These tips won’t require much time to implement, 
but they will definitely bring an increase in business if you follow through. In 
another chapter, I explain the ten considerations you should keep in mind for 
business-to-business marketing.
Don’t forget to take a look at the glossary at the back of the book, just before 
the index. It helps you find definitions for key marketing and consumer-
behavior-related terms.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I highlight specific types of information with pictures 
called icons; the icons flag information so you can more easily access it if you 
want to flip back to it. They also help you to know what’s crucial to remem-
ber and what isn’t. Here’s what each one means:
 
I use this icon when I want to remind you of essential and critical information 
regarding consumer behavior and its effect on your business.
 
This icon flags advice that can make a task easier or more successful.
 
This icon warns you of things that can cause you trouble.

Consumer Behavior For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
The great thing about Consumer Behavior For Dummies is that you can thumb 
through it and read the chapters that interest you. You can go through it at 
your own pace in whatever order you desire. It’s easy to use as a reference as 
you’re beginning to explore consumer behavior in your own daily situations. 
I suggest that you start with the basics of Part I to gain a general understand-
ing of consumer behavior. These chapters give you a foundation that you can 
use when thumbing through the other chapters.
If you want to focus on how consumers are influenced internally and exter-
nally, check out Parts II and III. With the chapters in these parts, you’ll gain a 
greater understanding of why consumers behave the way they do when faced 
with particular influences.
Parts IV and V provide you with information regarding your marketing strat-
egy, but without reading Parts II and III you won’t gain the knowledge you 
need to create an effective marketing strategy and implementation process.
This book equips you with the knowledge and information that you need to 
create a consumer-generated marketing plan. It’s like getting an MBA in a 
book. Okay, maybe not, but you will feel confident when it comes to under-
standing your customer and putting together a marketing plan that focuses 
on that customer.

Behavior

In this part . . .
H
ere I uncover the mystery behind consumer behav-
ior and why it’s important for you to understand. 
Consumer behavior is no longer just for the sophisticated 
corporations and multimillion-dollar businesses. Small- to 
medium-sized businesses will find the knowledge in this 
part just as useful.
By understanding consumer behavior, you can better 
understand your customers and gain insight into how 
they make decisions to purchase products. In this part, I 
give you an overview of the many variables involved in 
the study of consumer behavior. Then I walk you step-by-
step through the consumer’s decision-making process 
and show you how to help customers if they become 
stalled. If you can help your customers this way, you’re 
more than one step ahead of most of your competition.
In this part, you also discover why incorporating the 
knowledge of consumer behavior is important to your 
marketing strategy. I discuss the different pieces of prod-
uct strategy, placement strategy, pricing strategy, and 
promotion strategy. Adding the knowledge of consumer 
behavior to your marketing strategy sets your business 
up for success.

C
onsumer behavior is often misconceived as only useful to the sophisti-
cated and bigger corporations. Nothing could be farther from the truth. 
After all, consumer behavior can teach companies of all sizes about the con-
sumption patterns of their consumers as well as the internal and external 
influences that affect those customers.
When you understand the behavior of consumers, you can create products 
and services that provide the consumers with more value. And then you can 
market those products and services in ways that the consumers understand. 
The whole point of studying consumer behavior is to motivate customers to 
purchase.
In this chapter, I explain the basics of consumer behavior and show you how 
you can use it to better your marketability, explain your value, and increase 
your sales.
What Is Consumer Behavior, 
and Why Is It Important?
Consumer behavior represents the study of individuals and the activities 
that take place to satisfy their realized needs. That satisfaction comes from 
the processes used in selecting, securing, and using products or services 
when the benefits received from those processes meet or exceed consumers’ 
expectations. In other words, when an individual realizes that he has a need, 
the psychological process starts the consumer decision process. Through 
this process, the individual sets out to find ways to fulfill the need he has 

10
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
identified. That process includes the individual’s thoughts, feelings, and 
behavior. When the process is complete, the consumer is faced with the task 
of analyzing and digesting all the information, which determines the actions 
he will take to fulfill the need.
 
To simplify the explanation even further, you can think of consumer behavior 
as the process that determines the why, what, who, when, and how of what a 
consumer purchases. Consumer behavior answers the following questions:
 
✓ Why do consumers buy? Consumers make purchases for a variety of 
reasons. These reasons include the following:
 
• To reinforce self-concepts
 
• To maintain their lifestyles
 
• To become part of a group or gain acceptance in a group they 
already belong to
 
• To express their cultural identity
 
✓ What internal and external factors influence their purchases? Each 
consumer is influenced internally by his own attitudes, personality, per-
ceptions, self-concepts, and emotions. He also must deal with external 
influences, such as household structure, group association, and cultural 
beliefs.
 
✓ Who do they buy from? Consumers purchase from businesses that ful-
fill their psychological needs by making them feel welcome, understood, 
important, and comfortable.
 
✓ When do they buy? Consumers buy based on their consumption pat-
terns, which are determined by their family life cycles and household 
structures.
 
✓ How do they purchase? Consumers go through a decision-making 
process that guides them in their purchases. This process takes into 
account both internal and external influences of the consumer.
Consumer behavior provides a wealth of information about the individuals 
that purchase your products and services. When you understand a con-
sumer, you can speak directly to him and his needs. This special communi-
cation not only increases the consumer’s ability to understand the value in 
your product, but it also increases sales. Consumers buy what they under-
stand and what they see value in. Consumer behavior also provides you with 
insight on how to create an effective marketing strategy. After all, if you don’t 
understand your consumers, how can you market to them?
 
Companies often fail to gain an understanding of what their consumers want 
and need before they actually create their marketing strategies. They lack 
knowledge of what influences their consumers. So remember that evaluation 
and understanding of consumer behavior should always come before the 
development of a marketing strategy or plan.

11
 Chapter 1: Consumer Behavior: The Basics
Today consumers are faced with an array of product selection, and competi-
tion is fierce among companies. This is why your understanding of consumer 
behavior is vital to the success of your business. When you understand your 
consumers better than your competition, you have a greater chance of win-
ning their business.
When you’re equipped to speak and market directly to consumers and the 
needs they’re facing, you can help walk them through the decision-making 
processes and counteract any negative influences they may encounter in the 
process. Throughout this chapter, I explain both the processes and the influ-
ences that affect individuals when it comes to consumer behavior.
Getting a Glimpse of the Consumer’s 
Decision-Making Process
The consumer decision-making process consists of five steps. I focus on this 
process in detail in Chapter 2, but I want to give you a brief overview here. 
This overview will help you understand how consumer behavior impacts the 
decision a consumer makes on purchasing a product or service. Here are the 
steps in a nutshell:
 
1. A consumer becomes aware of a need. This need is triggered either 
internally or externally.
 
2. After the need is identified, the consumer goes through a process to 
search for solutions that will fulfill that need. This search involves 
identifying criteria that’s important to her. Then she begins to search for 
a location where she can find her solution.
 
3. The consumer evaluates the alternatives or options. She takes the 
information she collected in Step 2 and processes that information in 
order to evaluate her options and arrive at a decision.
 
4. The consumer makes the purchase based on the information pro-
cessed in Step 3. In this step, the consumer determines where to pur-
chase and how to purchase as well as when she should purchase.
 
5. The consumer evaluates the purchase. This step focuses on the psycho-
logical response of the buyer regarding the purchase. It’s in this phase 
that buyer’s remorse often pops up.
 
Many factors can influence the individual throughout this process. But by 
understanding consumer behavior, you can help a consumer move through 
this process smoothly. You can even assist the consumer if for some reason a 
step keeps her from making a decision. As a business owner or marketer, you 
can influence the entire process and not just the purchasing decision.

12
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Recognizing Factors that Influence 
the Purchase Decision
Consumer behavior is subjective. Even though you won’t find many absolutes, 
one thing always remains true: When it comes to the consumer decision-
making process, many factors play a part. There are two categories of personal 
influence regarding the purchase decision. They include the following:
 
✓ Internal influences: These influences include perceptions, attitude, life-
style, and roles.
 
✓ External influences: These influences include cultures, subcultures, 
household structures, and groups that have an effect on the individual.
 
Every situation and influence is different. You can change some influences and 
others you can only deal with as they happen. Sometimes you’ll even find that 
you can counteract the way the influences affect a consumer. It’s important 
to understand that while you can categorize internal and external influences 
of consumers into two groups, they’re actually interconnected and work 
together to assist the consumer in making a purchasing decision.
Throughout this book, I dig deep into how consumers are influenced, why 
they behave the ways that they do, and how you can use these influences to 
work to your advantage. For now, in the following sections, I give you a peek 
at each category and show you how they can affect your consumer.
Internal influences
Internal influences come from inside the consumer. They’re the personal 
thoughts and feelings, including perception, self-concepts, lifestyle, motiva-
tion, emotion, attitudes, and intentions. You could call these the psychologi-
cal influences. These influences describe the ways consumers interact with 
the world around them, recognize their feelings, gather and analyze informa-
tion, formulate thoughts and opinions, and take action. You can use con-
sumer internal influences to better understand the why and how of specific 
behaviors. The following sections help you gain a better understanding of 
each of these influences.
Motivation and emotion
Motivation and emotions serve as the emerging forces within consumers that 
activate certain behaviors. Motivation is the persistent need that stirs up and 
stimulates long-term goals within a consumer. Emotions are temporary states 
that reflect current changes in motivation. They also often trigger changes in 
behavior.

13
 Chapter 1: Consumer Behavior: The Basics
Motivation and emotion often work together to impact consumer behavior. 
Motivation drives a consumer through the consumer buying process, 
and emotion drives that motivation. You can apply your knowledge of moti-
vation and emotion to your marketing strategy by finding ways to stimulate 
consumers’ emotions and motivate consumers to fill the need aroused by 
those emotions.
Perception
Perception is representative of how a consumer processes and interprets 
information. You could describe perception as the way that consumers see 
the world around them — the world that includes your products and ser-
vices. Perceptions are unique and determine purchasing behavior in every 
consumer differently.
Perception is important to you because it represents the way the consumer 
views your product or service. You can influence the perception of your 
consumer by understanding the current perception consumers have of your 
product and making changes so your product is recognized, interpreted, and 
stored in their memory (rather than simply ignored). See Chapter 5 for the 
basics on consumer perception.
 
Familiarize yourself with perception, sensory thresholds, and the process that 
consumers go through to construct their perception. You can then use this 
information to tailor your marketing stimulus — such as ads, packaging, and 
pricing — for each particular segment that you’re trying to attract.
Perception is such an important part of getting consumers to purchase your 
product or service that I’ve dedicated Chapter 16 to explaining how you can 
influence perception of whatever it is that you’re selling while educating con-
sumers about your particular offering.
Attitude
Attitude is that lasting general evaluation of something. It represents how con-
sumers feel about products, services, and companies. Attitudes can tell you a 
lot about your consumers and how well you’re accepted in the marketplace. 
Just remember that consumers easily screen information that conflicts with 
their own attitudes.
 
A consumer’s attitudes are learned. They’re formed by direct personal experi-
ences, and they’re influenced by the individual’s ideas and personality, the 
experiences of friends and family members, and media exposure. The good 
news is that you can influence attitudes. In fact, when you combine knowledge 
with a positive or negative attitude about a specific object or product, you 
drive the perception of that consumer. In Chapter 6, I share with you the atti-
tude models and their functions and strategies. These models can help you 
influence and change the attitudes of your consumers.

14
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Self-concept and lifestyle
A self-concept represents how an individual sees herself. Four self-concepts 
typically impact individuals and their consumer behavior. Here they are:
 
✓ Actual self, which is reflective of how the individual actually is today
 
✓ Ideal self, which represents how the individual would like to be
 
✓ Private self, which is the self that’s intentionally hidden from others
 
✓ Public self, which is the self that’s exposed to the public
Self-concepts explain why consumers wear certain fashions, purchase par-
ticular products, and drive specific cars. They determine a consumer’s 
behavior, because they represent how a consumer sees herself and how she 
thinks other people see her. When you understand the roles of self-concepts, 
you can use them to better target your marketing message and advertising to 
reach potential customers. In Chapter 7, I explore self-concepts in detail.
Self-concepts often translate themselves into a person’s lifestyle, which is 
why I discuss them together here. Technically, a person’s lifestyle is deter-
mined by a mixture of both internal and external influences; it’s a function 
of her motivations, learning, attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, opinions, demo-
graphic factors, and personality. Lifestyle also represents a consumer’s 
income level, culture, social class, and buying power.
Lifestyle is reflected by the outward appearance of both internal and external 
influences of consumers. When you look at all the factors to gain a greater 
grasp of the lifestyles of your consumers, you can target promotional plans 
to those consumers. You also can identify market opportunities.
External influences
Consumers are faced with many external influences, including an individual’s 
culture, subculture, household structure, and groups that he associates 
with. Marketers and business owners call these external influences because 
the source of the influence comes from outside the person rather than from 
inside (which would be internal, or psychological, influences). You also could 
refer to them as sociocultural influences, because they evolve from the formal 
and informal relationships the individual has with other people. In the follow-
ing sections, I introduce you to each of the external influences and show you 
how and why they affect consumers.
Culture and subculture
The culture of an individual shapes her values, beliefs, attitudes, and opin-
ions, which in turn shape her attitude toward products and buying decisions. 

15
 Chapter 1: Consumer Behavior: The Basics
Culture also meets many of the emotional needs of individuals, so they strive 
to protect the beliefs and values of their cultures. This protection is reflected 
in their behavior as consumers.
In fact, culture can create a consumer need, influence the satisfaction of 
needs, and dictate how an individual meets that need. Products and services 
that resonate with the priorities of a specific culture have a much better 
chance of being accepted by consumers. Cultural values are transmitted 
through the family, religious organizations, and education institutions. You 
can use this information to gain a better understanding of the values that 
specific cultures teach.
Subculture represents a group of individuals within a culture that have uni-
fying characteristics. A subculture is often representative of a particular 
nationality, religion, racial group, or geographic group. You can use these 
unifying characteristics to market directly to a subculture. You can target 
consumers more directly with your marketing and create messages that 
are more appealing and enticing when you understand the subcultures of 
consumers. In Chapter 8, I show you why it’s possible that a subculture can 
create a distinctive market segment on its own.
Groups
Groups represent two or more individuals who share a set of norms, values, 
or beliefs. Examples include peer groups, school groups, business groups, 
and clubs. Individuals identify with groups to the extent that they take on the 
values, attitudes, and behaviors of that group. You need to understand the 
groups that consumers belong to because groups carry significant weight 
when it comes to the influence they have on consumers. You can also benefit 
from identifying the opinion leaders within groups and informing them of 
the products you offer. By gaining their support, you market to the mass of a 
group by using the leader’s endorsement.
Chapter 10 walks you through the reasons that people are attracted to 
groups and tells you everything you need to know in order to market effec-
tively to them.
Household structures
Household structure represents how many live in a home, what the ages of the 
occupants are, and what the household income is. Household structure is 
important to consumer behavior because the structure affects the consump-
tion and purchasing patterns of the individuals within the home. Each member 
of the household structure also has a role in the decision-making process, and 
when you understand those roles, you can be more effective in helping those 
consumers make decisions on whether to purchase your product.

16
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
It’s also important to understand the difference between traditional and 
non-traditional households. Doing so helps you determine each household’s 
needs, thereby marketing to those needs in a way that’s appealing to the con-
sumers. Finally, you need to take into account family life cycles, because they 
too have an effect on consumers and their consumption patterns and needs.
 
Marketing to families isn’t as easy as it use to be, because there are a variety 
of situations and changing roles that need to be considered. However, consid-
eration of these issues puts you ahead of your competitors and enables you to 
gain sales that you may be missing out on.
Chapter 9 walks you through the various types of households as they apply 
to marketing strategy. I describe in depth the ways that these households 
affect purchasing behavior and how you can target particular individuals 
within a household.
Accounting for the Unpleasant: 
Consumer Misbehavior
Consumer misbehavior is behavior that violates laws and generally accepted 
norms of conduct in today’s society. Examples include shoplifting, fraud, and 
abusive consumer behavior. Consumer misbehavior can disrupt consump-
tion activities and can cause loss to your business both in revenue and in the 
loss of other consumers. All businesses are at risk of experiencing consumer 
misbehavior.
 
By being aware of consumer misbehavior, you can watch for the warning signs 
and be proactive at protecting your business. Just as you can use your mar-
keting strategy to gain consumers, you can also use it to detour those consum-
ers who are involved in misbehavior.
In Chapter 11, I discuss the effect that consumer misbehavior has on busi-
nesses. I share with you the warning signs and the reasons behind the behav-
ior. I also provide you with ways to detour misbehavior by using proactive 
steps and your own marketing strategy.
Seeing How Consumer Behavior Can 
Guide Your Marketing Strategy
Many components come into play with consumer behavior, but the power is 
in knowing how to understand and influence that behavior. The knowledge of 
consumer behavior actually allows you to improve your marketing strategy. 

17
 Chapter 1: Consumer Behavior: The Basics
It helps you understand the way your consumer thinks, feels, reasons, and 
selects between alternatives. You can use the knowledge you gain from study-
ing consumer behavior to create effective marketing campaigns that speak 
directly to specific consumers. In this book, I show you how to do just that. By 
the time you’re finished, you’ll see the works behind a consumer’s decision 
process, buying behaviors, and consumption patterns.
In the following sections, I outline the major steps involved in creating a mar-
keting strategy, and I show you how to use your understanding of consumer 
behavior to work through each phase.
Researching the market 
to find commonalities
Market research is the key to understanding your consumers and their behav-
ior. It’s the systematic collection, recording, analyzing, and distributing of 
marketing data. It ensures that you produce what your consumers really 
want and need — not just what you think they need. Market research is the 
function that links the consumer and the public to the marketer. You use the 
information that you gather in research to identify marketing opportunities 
as well as problems.
In Chapter 12, I help you evaluate the different marketing research options 
and determine whether primary or secondary research is best for you. I 
discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and by the end of the chapter, 
you’ll have a good grasp on where to begin your market research. I also 
give you an in-depth look at how market research helps you identify new 
trends, develop long-running marketing strategies, identify external threats 
and opportunities, evaluate the potential of diverse markets, select a target 
market, establish realistic goals, and formulate a strategic plan. Finally, I look 
at the process of market research from defining a problem to analyzing your 
findings and presenting them in a report.
Breaking the overall market into 
the segments you’ll target
Segments are market groups within the total market that are made up of 
people who have similar needs. When you can recognize a segmented group, 
your marketing opportunities increase and you gain the highest return on 
your marketing. That’s because segmenting enables you to focus on the cus-
tomers that are most likely to purchase your products or services — those 
individuals that are most interested in what you have to offer.

18
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
 
Segmenting, which is cost-effective and makes your marketing easier, allows 
you to delve into the behavior of consumers. It also assists you in identifying 
their needs. In turn, you can position your product in a way that shows them 
how you fulfill an unmet need that they have. Chapter 3 covers the segmenting 
process and shows you how to better position your product so your offer is 
attractive to your determined segments.
Uncovering the untapped markets
Determining new marketing opportunities and identifying untapped markets 
can help you grow your business. Untapped markets represent markets that 
you haven’t yet entered and that your competitors may not be aware of. 
When you get into untapped markets, you identify new ways to grow your 
business by opening up doors for consumers who may not be familiar with 
you yet. You can identify untapped markets by taking the time to examine 
your consumer base and understand your market.
In Chapter 14, I show you how to recognize untapped markets that you may 
be missing. I also help you identify product offerings. Finally, I also provide 
steps you can take to protect your current market share.
Creating a Consumer-Driven 
Marketing Plan
Marketing isn’t just about flashy advertisements and fancy commercials. And 
it isn’t just about creating awareness; it’s about gaining new customers. The 
only way that you gain new customers is by creating a marketing plan that’s 
intentionally consumer driven.
A consumer-driven marketing plan is developed and created and then prac-
ticed with integrity in mind. With a consumer-driven marketing plan, you do 
all the following:
 
✓ Listen and speak directly to consumers and tell them that you under-
stand their needs.
 
✓ Position your products in a way that shows them that you fulfill their 
unmet needs.
 
✓ Gain their attention by providing them with the education they need to 
make good purchasing decisions.
 
✓ Share with them the reasons they should adopt new products and 
accept the changes that you make to existing products.
 
✓ Gain their committed loyalty and make them want to be a customer for life.

19
 Chapter 1: Consumer Behavior: The Basics
All of these tasks help you create a marketing plan that not only benefits your 
business but benefits the consumer by creating an awareness that causes 
them to want to purchase your product. In this section, I show you how to 
use your knowledge of consumer behavior to market to consumers in a way 
that they understand and are attracted to.
Practicing integrity
Marketing ethics impact both the consumer and your business. When it 
comes to marketing, you must build trust with your consumers. It’s your 
responsibility to embrace, communicate, and practice ethical values that 
improve the confidence of your consumers. You need to understand the 
importance of marketing ethics, because deceptive marketing practices can 
affect consumer behavior.
Unethical marketing behavior affects the emotions, attitudes, and percep-
tions of consumers — whether it happens to them directly or they just hear 
about it. In Chapter 15, I discuss the different types of unethical marketing 
practices and share with you the importance of having your own code of 
ethics and how to go about creating one. Your integrity is not only what gains 
new customers; it’s also what helps you keep them.
Inducing need awareness 
through positioning
Positioning is the act of creating a unique identity for whatever it is that 
you’re selling and then targeting a segment of the broader market by fitting 
your product or service to that segment’s wants and needs. In order to get 
consumers to recognize that your product fits their needs, you must figure 
out what the consumers in your target market need and want, what you have 
to offer them, what your benefits are, and who your competitors are (includ-
ing how you’re different from them). You use this information to create a 
positioning strategy and statement. These tools help you reach out to your 
targeted consumers. They communicate, identify your company, and differ-
entiate it and its products from the competition.
 
When positioning your product or service, you proceed through two separate 
steps. First you have to differentiate your product or service from its competi-
tion, and then you address the consumer’s need or desire. These steps form 
the basis for the articulation of what your product does, which is also known 
as your positioning statement. Within each of the two steps are three strategies 
you can use to reach out to your target market. I explain them all in Chapter 
16, where I also guide you in creating your positioning statement.

20
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Engaging consumers’ attention and 
leading them to purchase
At this point in the process, you really begin working with the influence of 
perception in order to engage your consumers’ five senses and draw their 
attention to your product or service. In order to do so, you must create value 
for your consumers to shape and cultivate their perceptions. You create 
value by focusing on what your consumers believe is essential.
It isn’t enough to get consumers to notice whatever you’re selling; you must 
educate them about the value and benefits of your offering in order to over-
come any objections regarding the purchase of it. In Chapter 16, you discover 
how to effectively educate your consumers about your product or service. 
Successful marketing counters any objections to the prospective purchase.
 
The key is to present the benefits of your product in a way that consumers 
understand. You also need to develop a unique selling proposition (or USP). A 
USP is a statement that sets you apart from the competition. It paves the way 
for your positioning strategy and statement. When you identify your USP, you 
find something meaningful and unique to say about your product that com-
petitors either can’t or won’t say. Several core steps help you to identify and 
develop your USP. After you’ve proceeded through the steps, you can work 
on drafting a marketing message that will grab their attention. (Check out 
Chapter 16 for more on USPs.)
Convincing customers to adopt new 
products and changes in terms
Do you ever wonder why so many new products fail? Well, the truth is that  
it’s often because business owners don’t understand the adoption process. 
They don’t know what it takes for a consumer to adopt a new product.
So you aren’t in the same position as those business owners, here’s the 
scoop: Consumers go through a series of evaluation steps when adopting 
new products. This process often involves the give and take. In other words, 
they determine what they have to give up in order to take in the benefits of a 
new product.
 
Consumers are inundated with new products every day. So when trying to 
get consumers to adopt a new product, it helps to understand the product 
life cycle and to identify what phase your products are in. You also need to 
be able to identify characteristics of the different adopter categories that 

21
 Chapter 1: Consumer Behavior: The Basics
consumers fall into. This way you can speak directly to any apprehensions 
they may have and gain a better understanding of their readiness to purchase. 
Just remember that you can influence new product adoption by simply under-
standing the adoption process that consumers go through.
Consumers also face a great deal of challenge when it comes to accepting 
changes in the terms of your existing product. Term changes can be any 
change that you make to your current products. Examples include a change 
in benefits, a change in price, or a change in distribution. You can help con-
sumers in the transition of change. One way is to take into account how your 
consumers will view the change and whether they will see it as a “gain” or a 
“loss.” Then you can develop a marketing strategy that speaks directly to the 
challenges the consumer may be feeling. This strategy helps to increase the 
rate of adoption to the change and save you the loss of customers who other-
wise may stop buying your product.
In Chapter 18, I show you what it takes to get consumers to adopt your new 
products and how to overcome adoption challenges. I explain the reasons 
that consumers are apprehensive to adopt new products and what you can 
do to soothe those concerns. I also take a look at the challenges that consum-
ers face when being presented with changes to your current products and 
how you can help them in the transition of accepting those changes.
Encouraging customer loyalty
Success is about getting consumers to continually buy from you, because 
it’s easier to gain loyalty from a current customer than it is to gain a new 
customer. You can gain consumer loyalty by understanding how consum-
ers learn and by using techniques that help them remember you. Consumer 
loyalty really comes from meeting the emotional needs of consumers. Those 
needs include the need to be understood, feel important, feel welcomed, and 
feel comfortable. You can meet these needs and encourage consumer loyalty 
by providing consumers with expertise, attention, friendliness, flexibility, 
patience, and superiority in your products and your services. This is done by 
communicating and creating relationships with consumers.
 
Customers carry a great deal of value when they’re loyal to you. So it’s impor-
tant to be able to gauge and nurture the relationship that you have with your 
consumers and to be able to turn satisfied customers into loyal customers. In 
Chapter 19, I talk about the different kinds of consumer loyalty, and I tell you 
how to turn your customers into repeat buyers.

Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
The answers
 
1. D
 
 Cultural beliefs, social groups, and household structure are all factors 
that may influence a person’s perception of your product, service, or 
company. All three of these have an external influence on the consumer 
and provide them with a reference point when it comes to the values and 
beliefs that they hold. Refer to Chapter 8 for more information on culture, 
Chapter 10 for social groups, and Chapter 9 for household structures.
 
2. B
 
 The desire to be accepted by peers is a motivating force that a con-
sumer might experience. Motivation comes from an emotion that a con-
sumer may be experiencing, so an emotion to be accepted will provide 
a motivating force to consumers to make a purchase. See Chapter 4 for 
more information on motivation and emotions that affect consumers.
 
3. B
 
 The consumer misbehavior of shoplifting is often a deep-rooted prob-
lem caused by compulsive buying/overspending. The need to satisfy 
their compulsive disorders often causes consumers to shoplift. Flip to 
Chapter 11 for more information on consumer misbehaviors.
 
4. A
 
 Consumption factors that change when it comes to the family life cycle 
include the number of people in a family, the ages of the family mem-
bers, and the number of employed adults. Consumption patterns change 
because there may be more people to buy for. Also, the different age 
groups need different necessity items. Finally, the number of employed 
adults in the home determines how much money a family has to spend. 
Visit Chapter 9 for more information on household structures.
 
5. A
 
 External influences are called external because they’re outside influ-
ences. External influences come from the outside and don’t pertain 
to the internal or psychological influences of a consumer. Refer to 
Chapters 8, 9, and 10 for more information on external influences.
 
6. C
 
 When a consumer considers a purchase, he enters the decision-making 
process. In the decision-making process, he decides to call a best friend 
or text his spouse, but first he must acknowledge that he has an unmet 
need (the first step in the decision-making process). Check out Chapter 
2 for more information on the decision-making process of consumers.

25
 Chapter 1: Consumer Behavior: The Basics
 
7. C
 
 You can use six strategies to change the attitudes of consumers. These 
strategies include changing the basic motivational function, associating 
your products with different groups, relating to a conflicting attitude, 
altering components in your product attributes, changing beliefs about 
competing brands, and using the elaboration likelihood model. Chapter 
6 provides more information on changing consumer attitudes.
 
8. C
 
 A consumer’s actual self refers to the self that’s a realistic perception of 
the individual at that moment. To read more information on self-concepts 
and their impacts on consumers, refer to Chapter 7.
 
9. B
 
 When a consumer changes her marital status, she will change her spend-
ing patterns. When a consumer’s consumption patterns change, her 
spending patterns also change. See Chapter 9 for more information on 
household structure and its affect on consumers.
 
10. A
 
 You can encourage consumer loyalty and repeat buying by creating an 
emotional connection with your customers. The emotional connection 
is what creates committed loyalty from consumers. Chapter 19 explains 
how to cultivate customer loyalty.

Understanding How Consumers 
Make Purchase Decisions
In This Chapter
▶ Walking through the consumer decision-making process
▶ Understanding how each step works
▶ Determining how to use knowledge of the process to your advantage
W
hen consumers buy your products or services, they engage in a decision-
making process. By taking the time to understand your customer’s 
needs and concerns as they move through that decision-making process, you 
increase your chances of winning their business. Market research shows that 
one of the major problems businesses face is that they fail to support the 
customer in that process.
In this chapter, I help you understand the process of how a customer moves 
from looking to purchase to the actual purchase itself and thereafter. I also 
show you how to help customers move through that process and increase 
your chances of gaining their business.
Outlining the Decision-Making Process
Research shows that customers go through a five-stage decision-making 
process in any purchase, whether it’s a product or a service. Because the 
decision-making process is a cognitive one, it’s more psychological in nature. 
So you won’t necessarily see the process. Instead, you infer that the decision-
making process is in place by careful observation.
Here’s a quick look at the five phases that a consumer goes through when 
making a purchase decision — Figure 2-1 lays them out for you visually:

 Chapter 2: Understanding How Consumers Make Purchase Decisions
Phase 1: Need recognition and awareness: In this phase, the consumer 
recognizes and becomes aware that she has a need.
Phase 2: Searching for information: In this phase, the consumer begins 
to search for information regarding a solution for the need she has identi-
fied. The intensity of the search depends on whether the purchase is a 
big deal to the consumer (or not so big of a deal).
Phase 3: Evaluating the alternatives: In this phase, the consumer evalu-
ates each alternative solution to determine which one is best for her.
Phase 4: Purchase: In this phase, the consumer evaluates where and 
when to purchase and makes the purchase. If the need isn’t great and 
the solutions the consumer finds aren’t desirable enough to motivate a 
purchase, the consumer may postpone the purchase until a satisfactory 
opportunity presents itself.
Phase 5: Post-purchase evaluation: In this phase, the consumer evalu-
ates her purchase and decides whether she’s happy with the purchase. 
She may also experience buyer’s remorse in this phase.
 
As a marketer or business owner, it’s important that you understand this pro-
cess. By doing so, you’ll not only enhance the customer’s experience, but you’ll 
be able to walk her through the process and increase your chances of gaining 
business. Understanding the decision-making process can help to drive your 
business goals, your marketing message, and your marketing decisions.
Phase 1: Recognizing a Need or Desire
During the first phase of the decision-making process, a consumer recog-
nizes that he has a need. The buyer recognizes and senses a gap between his 
actual state and his desired state. The consumer’s actual state is his percep-
tion of his feelings and situation at the time. His desired state is the way he 
wants to feel or be at that time.
A need can be triggered by internal stimuli or external stimuli. What are these 
stimuli? Take a look:
 
✓ Internal stimuli are those things from within that get the consumer to 
do or buy something. For example, an internal stimulus might be feeling 
sleepy and wanting rest, being hungry and wanting food, or feeling your 
allergies kick in and wanting your allergy medicine.
 
✓ External stimuli are the outside influences that get you to do or buy 
something. For example, external stimuli include such things as seeing 
the sign for your favorite restaurant and feeling hunger pangs or seeing 
an advertisement for new shoes and remembering that your shoes are 
worn out and need to be replaced with a new pair.

30
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Consumers recognize needs in the following three ways, two of which you 
can influence:
 
✓ Advertisements or conversation with friends that cause an awareness of 
a need. (These are external stimuli.)
 
✓ Consultative selling, which is the seller’s ability to uncover a need. (This 
is an external stimulus.)
 
✓ The consumer’s evaluation of his current situation, which causes him 
to detect an area of dissatisfaction. (This is an internal stimulus, so you 
can’t influence it.)
 
In this phase, you as a marketer can cater your message to a potential need. 
One way to do this is to identify the need that your potential customer has 
and speak to that need in your advertising and marketing messages (see 
Chapter 16, which walks you through the process of positioning). You can’t 
create an internal need, but you can create awareness by triggering a need 
with external stimuli.
An example of this type of influence would be the pizza shop that advertises 
by using commercial advertisements at 11 p.m. The shop is targeting its 
potential consumers with external stimuli (their commercial). This triggers 
an awareness of a need. The shop’s commercial advertisements have made 
consumers think that they’re hungry. Because the consumers are hungry 
and now know that the pizza shop is open late, the shop has increased its 
chances that consumers will call and place an order to fulfill their need.
After a consumer realizes he has a need or a problem, he must find a solu-
tion. So, in Phase 2, he begins to search for information that will fulfill his 
need or solve the problem he has identified. However, the need sometimes 
can rise so high that it becomes a driving force in the individual, and he 
doesn’t spend much or any time searching for a solution. He never reaches 
Phase 2.
For example, suppose that a guy named John is watching a football game at a 
friend’s house. All the guys have gathered to enjoy the 52-inch plasma televi-
sion that John’s friend has just purchased. John is envious of the television 
and the attention that the friend is receiving. He decides that he too needs 
a 52-inch plasma television in order to entertain and be more accepted by 
his friends. The desire is created, and he’s feeling the impulse need to make 
the purchase. When John leaves his friend’s house, he decides to stop off at 
the electronic store. The salesperson shows him the different models and 
explains the one-day sale the store is having. John’s desire is so strong that 
instead of going home and evaluating and researching the different models 
and prices, he makes the purchase without spending money or time to 
research the solution to fulfill his desire.

31
 Chapter 2: Understanding How Consumers Make Purchase Decisions
Phase 2: Seeking and Researching 
Possible Solutions
Consumers begin the information search process by conducting an internal 
search of what they’re looking for and what will fulfill their need and desire 
on a personal level. Then they follow up with an external search for informa-
tion from friends, family members, salespeople, and advertisements. This 
phase provides consumers with criteria for assessing product alternatives 
and results in a set of potential choices.
 
It’s important to understand that although Phase 2 is represented as the 
information-gathering phase, it isn’t uncommon for anxious buyers not to 
search for information. If a consumer’s need is so severe that her purchasing 
drive is strong and she sees a product that satisfies her need or solves her 
problem (and is close at hand), she may skip this information-gathering phase 
and purchase the product or service on the spot. If the drive isn’t significant, 
the need may be filed in the consumer’s memory, and then she will begin 
searching for information but not act so impulsively.
How this phase works
As a consumer begins to gather information, the intensity of her search is 
easily categorized into one of two levels. The level in which the consumer 
starts depends on the urgency and intensity of the need. The two levels of 
the search phase are as follows:
 
✓ Heightened attention: In this phase, the consumer is more open to 
receiving information regarding the item she has determined as a need. 
She will go online to search for information, look through magazines, 
and read advertisements to gain the information she’s looking for to 
make a decision — but her search isn’t intense; she won’t scour for the 
solution just yet.
 
✓ Active information search: When a consumer’s need becomes more 
intense, she enters the active search phase and really invests in the 
search process. The consumer will begin to gather information by read-
ing material and asking friends.
The amount of research a consumer does depends on the strength of the 
need and the drive that it creates. Each consumer has a certain level of basic 
information stored in memory; the amount of research she does depends on 
the ease of acquiring new information, the value placed on that information, 
and the satisfaction she gets from the research.

32
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
 
When you understand the phase that a particular consumer is in, you can 
better serve her. You can use both of these scenarios to your advantage. For 
the consumer who’s in the heightened attention phase, it’s about educating 
her on why she needs your product. On the other hand, if you’re dealing with 
a consumer who’s actively searching, you want to focus on why you’re better 
than your competitors and why she should choose your product over the 
competition’s product.
For example, if you meet a consumer at a trade show and she has happened 
upon your product and is open to receiving information about your product, 
you can determine that she’s in a heightened attention phase. Even though 
she hasn’t actually sought you out, she’s still receptive to the push of your 
information, and she’s probably not aware of your competitors at this time. If 
another consumer at the same trade show visits your booth and has sought 
you out because she’s been researching the service or product that you have 
to offer, she’s probably educated about what you’re offering and has knowl-
edge regarding your competitors.
Consumers often use several sources for information, including the following:
 
✓ Personal sources: Family, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances
 
✓ Commercial sources: Advertising, salespeople, dealers, product packag-
ing, retail displays, and the Internet
 
✓ Public sources: Editorial media coverage and consumer rating 
organizations
 
✓ Experiential sources: Handling, examining, and using the product — 
perhaps on a trial basis 
How you use this knowledge 
in your marketing
As consumers gather more information, they increase their awareness and 
knowledge of available brands and features. So as a marketer or business 
owner, you must identify the information sources that are most important 
and influential to your potential buyer — and then you must make sure the 
information is available there. Refer to Chapter 17 for more on identifying 
your potential buyer and the marketing options available to you.
For example, you may find that advertising in the Sunday paper is the most 
influential source that your target market responds to. If so, put an ad there. 
Or you may find that your target market depends most on the Internet. If 
that’s the case, make your information available there.

33
 Chapter 2: Understanding How Consumers Make Purchase Decisions
Phase 3: Evaluating the Alternatives
During this phase, the consumer processes information and arrives at his 
decision. He does so by evaluating, identifying, and assessing the value of the 
alternatives. The consumer looks at the features that he wants. The depth 
of evaluation often depends on the individual consumer and the importance 
attached to the specific buying situation. When it comes to purchasing, situa-
tions not only vary from consumer to consumer, but they also can vary from 
product to product.
For example, a consumer may be making a purchase that he has put a lot of 
thought into and researched thoroughly; or the purchase may be made on 
impulse with little or no thought. These situations can determine how much 
evaluation is put on the alternatives that are available.
How this phase works
If attractive alternatives are available, a consumer will work to determine 
which criteria to evaluate and will judge each alternative’s relative impor-
tance when it comes to making the final decision. Criteria for making that 
decision can include one or more of the following:
✓ Color
✓ Durability
✓ Options
✓ Price
✓ Quality
✓ Safety
✓ Status
✓ Style
✓ Warranty
 
In some situations a consumer will use careful calculations and logical think-
ing. In other situations, however, a consumer may do little or no evaluating; 
she will rely more on impulse and intuition. Consumers use the following three 
types of choice processes when deciding between products and services:
 
✓ Affective choice: This choice is based on an emotional “it feels right” 
factor. A consumer will make a decision based not on the fact that it 
follows decision rules but that it feels right to make that purchase. This 
may mean that the consumer doesn’t go through the research process 
or that she purchases a product or service even though it doesn’t con-
tain all the features she’s looking for. The purchase just feels right or 
makes the consumer feel good.
 
✓ Attitude-based choice: This is a systematic, rules-based process. The 
consumer will go through the entire process from need to research to 
evaluation, and she will make sure that the product meets each and 
every need she has identified.

34
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
 
 For example, a consumer may decide to purchase a new refrigerator 
to go with her newly remodeled kitchen. She used to own a Maytag 
refrigerator. Not only did the refrigerator work well, but she also liked 
the appearance. Her parents had a Whirlpool model that worked just 
as well, but she didn’t think it had the same sleek appearance that 
the Maytag did. So, she goes to the appliance store and sees both the 
Maytag and the Whirlpool models and discovers that they’re both the 
same price, so she purchases the Maytag.
 
✓ Attribute choice: This choice is strictly based on benefit and feature-
by-feature comparisons across specific brands or products. You can 
imagine this consumer sitting down and going through each feature or 
benefit one by one and crossing a product off when one doesn’t fit the 
bill. The product that’s left is the one the consumer purchases.
The choice process that a consumer uses depends on whether she feels the 
purchase is extremely relevant and personally important. Take a look at the 
two types of purchases consumers make:
 
✓ High-involvement purchases: This type of purchase includes products 
or services that involve a high expenditure or a great deal of personal 
risk. Examples of high-involvement purchases are buying a car or home 
or making investments.
 
 When a purchase is highly involving, a consumer goes through a more 
in-depth evaluation process. She puts more time, attention, and energy 
into the research phase of the buying process. She’s making a value 
decision by weighing several equivalent products and trying to make the 
best decision she can based on her individual criteria.
 
✓ Low-involvement purchases: This type of purchase includes products 
or services that involve a lower expenditure and less personal risk. 
Examples of low-involvement purchases are buying a soda, choosing a 
hair shampoo, or deciding whether it’s beef or chicken for dinner.
 
 Low-involvement purchases are less about value and more often about 
convenience, which is why they require a simple evaluation process.
If after evaluating options a consumer finds what she wants, she moves on 
to the next step, where she decides who to buy from and when to buy. If she 
doesn’t find what she wants, she either delays the purchase or resumes her 
search and returns to Phase 2.
How you use this knowledge 
in your marketing
If you know and understand the evaluation process your consumers go 
through, you can take steps to influence the buyer’s decision. For instance, 
when it comes to high-involvement purchases, it’s important to provide 

35
 Chapter 2: Understanding How Consumers Make Purchase Decisions
your consumer with information that reaffirms the positive consequences 
of buying. As a marketer you want to stress the important features of your 
product and the advantages compared to your competitors. This emphasis 
is extremely important to the consumer in a high-involvement purchase, 
because it allows him to see value in the purchase.
On the other hand, when it comes to low-involvement purchases, you can 
generally provide less information and still move the consumer past the eval-
uation process. He spends less time and attention on research because he’s 
making a decision that’s more than likely based on impulse. This is why you 
often see low-involvement purchase items in checkout lines of major retail 
chains or on the counters at the local gas stations.
In situations where the consumer can’t find acceptable alternatives, a deci-
sion to delay or not make a purchase is often made. The best way to avoid 
this situation is by providing the consumer with all the information he needs, 
including a list of features that compare your product or service with that of 
your competitors. This information can make the consumer feel more at ease 
about the purchase decision, and it often helps him to move forward in the 
purchase.
 
Purchase stalls are most common when the consumer is lacking the informa-
tion that he needs to make a decision. If you find that providing additional 
information doesn’t help, you may try asking the consumer what information 
he needs from you in order to make a decision today.
Phase 4: Assessing the Value of the 
Chosen Product or Service
After a consumer evaluates and selects the best alternative, she’s ready to 
purchase. However, the consumer isn’t done flowing through the process 
just yet. She must now determine whether she feels that she’s buying a prod-
uct or service that has value. Buying value is the perception of the worth the 
customer is getting by purchasing your product. Buying value isn’t just about 
price; it’s also about service, quality, and experience. A consumer wants the 
most bang for her buck.
How this phase works
 
The two factors that come into play when determining buying value is the 
quality and the customer service the consumer receives. Two questions 
receive the most attention during Phase 4: “Who will I buy from?” and “When 
will I buy?” These questions help the consumer determine what your actual 
buying value is.

36
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Who will I buy from?
The consumer considers the following three things when determining who to 
buy from:
 
✓ Terms of the sale: The consumer will evaluate not only the purchase 
price, but the terms of the sale. For instance, if payments are involved, 
he has to determine whether he can afford those payments. He also has 
to decide whether he agrees with the length of those payments. Terms 
of the sale include delivery and warranties as well. All these terms can 
affect whether the consumer purchases a product or service from you.
 
✓ Past experience from the seller: If the consumer has purchased from 
you before, he will evaluate the service you provided in the past. If 
the consumer was satisfied with the past experience, your chances 
are high that he will be a repeat buyer because that experience built 
trust. However, if the consumer wasn’t happy with the past service, it’s 
easier for him to continue searching for someone else to buy from — 
unless, of course, you can convince him that you have improved your 
service level or product quality and now have the ability to meet (or 
exceed) expectations.
 
✓ Return policy: A return policy should be clear to your consumer. A 
concise and clear return policy gives a consumer a sense of security. It 
can make him feel that what he’s buying is guaranteed to be what you 
have represented it to be. When you don’t give the consumer a return 
policy, he has a reason to be suspicious and may avoid purchasing 
your product.
When will I buy?
The following factors help a consumer determine when to buy a product or 
service from you:
 
✓ Store atmosphere: Does your store provide the consumer with a “feel 
good” atmosphere? You better hope so, because the atmosphere that 
you create can move the consumer into a comfort zone that encourages 
her to move through the steps of purchasing. The atmosphere includes 
the design of your building, interior space, layout of aisles, texture of 
carpet and walls, scents, colors, and the shapes and sounds experienced 
by the consumer.
 
✓ Presence of time pressure: Is the consumer being pressured regarding 
the timing of the purchase? A consumer’s availability when it comes 
to timing is crucial for how she forms her life and how she acts when 
choosing, buying, and using products in the marketplace. Your con-
sumer is either time-rich, meaning she isn’t in a time crunch; or she’s 
time-poor, meaning she needed your product yesterday.

37
 Chapter 2: Understanding How Consumers Make Purchase Decisions
 
✓ Specials or sales on products or services: Are you running a special or 
a sale on the item the consumer wants to purchase? Specials and sales 
create a strong consumer demand and increase the consumer’s urgency 
to purchase (so they get the item before the sale is over).
 
✓ Pleasantness of the overall shopping experience: How does the con-
sumer rate the overall shopping experience? It’s important to realize 
that the shopping experience plays a core part in the decision-making 
process. It’s similar to the element of store atmosphere. You must 
always make the shopping experience rewarding to the consumer; doing 
so not only moves the consumer to make a purchase, but it also brings 
her back to your store.
How you use this knowledge 
in your marketing
As you can see from the previous sections, the “who” and “when” become 
vital in the purchasing decision. The more you can help the consumer, the 
better off you will be. If the consumer is satisfied with your service, experi-
ence, and shopping atmosphere, the purchase is made. If he’s dissatisfied, 
however, he may delay the purchase or end up not buying from you at all.
 
Keep the following tips in mind when working with your customers in this 
phase:
 
✓ Make sure the store atmosphere and experience is what your cus-
tomer is looking for. How do you do this? Survey current customers. 
Some stores already do this. Take, for example, the credit card terminals 
at the checkout lane that ask you whether your cashier was friendly or 
whether your shopping experience was pleasant. Retail stores survey 
customers in order to ensure that the customer is having a positive 
experience. Other questions you may want to ask include the following:
 
• If you’re the manager of a candle shop, you may want to ask if cus-
tomers liked the scent of the candle you were burning in the store 
that day.
 
• If you own an art gallery, you may want to ask about the lighting. 
For instance, you may want to find out whether it was suitable for 
viewing the pieces of art in the gallery.
 
• If you play music in your store, you may want to ask whether the 
music is pleasant and whether it enhances the shopping experience.
 
✓ Save the customer time. If the customer is feeling time pressure, he 
needs to save time. You can help with this by being clear upfront with 
your terms of sale and return policy. Saving your customer time can 
increase the chances of him purchasing your product or service.

38
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
 
✓ Have a sale. Sales promotions and specials are effective when trying to 
keep existing consumers or gain new consumers. Having a sale or a spe-
cial can often increase sales more than any other type of marketing.
 
✓ Pay attention to your customer service. Experience can be created by 
providing incredible customer service and competitive prices and by 
making the shopping process easier with consistency in service. Also, 
be sure to ask the consumer questions throughout the sales process to 
ensure that anything that may delay or stall the sale is addressed.
If you can equip yourself to ensure that the preceding items are clear to the 
customer and that he’s in agreement with them, you’ll save yourself from 
delaying or losing the sale.
Phase 5: Evaluating the Purchase 
after the Deed is Done
After the purchase is complete, your job is done, correct? Wrong. Remember 
that the end of the sale isn’t always the end of the buying process. In fact, it 
could be the beginning of another sale if you follow the process through to 
completion and satisfaction.
 
This phase in the buying process focuses on the psychological response of the 
buyer to her purchase decision. It’s at this phase that your customer will often 
undergo a degree of reflection about her purchase decision. She may wonder 
whether she made the right choice. She also may be considering the effort she 
put into this purchase and the worth of the initial expense. The consumer who 
has made a high-involvement purchase will spend the most time in this phase. 
When it comes to low-involvement purchases, this phase is often nonexistent. 
(See the section on Phase 3 earlier in the chapter for an explanation of high- 
and low-involvement purchases.)
How this phase works
You can categorize post-purchase outcomes in one of the following three 
categories:
 
✓ Outcome 1: Purchase is below expectation. The chances of this cus-
tomer returning and asking for a refund or exchange are high. He has 
evaluated his purchase and he isn’t happy. The purchase didn’t meet 
his expectations. This unhappy consumer will return and expect you to 
make the situation right. The chances of him recommending your prod-
uct to any of his friends, family, or associates are slim to none.

39
 Chapter 2: Understanding How Consumers Make Purchase Decisions
 
 When a consumer doesn’t return to your business because he’s unsatis-
fied, this can spur negative word-of-mouth advertising. Here’s why: even 
though you may not be aware of his dissatisfaction, the chances are that 
his friends, family, and associates will be.
 
✓ Outcome 2: Purchase matches expectation. The purchase the customer 
has made matches the expectation that he had. In the post-purchase 
phase, you probably won’t hear back from this customer. You only hear 
from him if he begins to doubt the ability to afford the purchase or if he 
feels that he didn’t gain value through pricing or the terms of sale.
 
✓ Outcome 3: Purchase exceeds expectation. If you achieve this outcome, 
you’ve reached what all businesses hope to reach: You have exceeded 
the expectations of your customer. Congratulations! The chances that 
you will hear from the customer (except for repeat business) are slim to 
none. Your customer feels that he has received value from the purchase 
and that you provided top-notch service. This customer will likely be a 
repeat customer and will send new buyers your way with word-of-mouth 
marketing. For more on encouraging repeat buying, flip to Chapter 19.
In this phase, the consumer is comparing his level of satisfaction or dissat-
isfaction by comparing his expectations with his perceptions of what he has 
received from the purchase. It isn’t uncommon for consumers to experience 
concerns after making a purchase. These concerns arise from the concept 
known as cognitive dissonance, an uncomfortable feeling or stress caused by 
two contradicting ideas simultaneously. In this case, it’s the battle between 
whether he should have or should not have purchased the product.
 
All purchase decisions produce some degree of conflict. If the consumer expe-
riences cognitive dissonance, he will begin to search for more information to 
reinforce his purchase decision. If you haven’t provided the customer with 
information to combat the internal struggle, he can move into a deeper guilt, 
which is known as buyer’s remorse. This feeling creates regret for the purchase.
How you use this knowledge 
in your marketing
Why do you care how a customer reacts to a purchase? Good question. By 
understanding post-purchase behavior, you can understand the influence 
and the likelihood of whether a buyer will repurchase the product (and 
whether she will keep it or return it). You’ll also determine whether the 
buyer will encourage others to purchase the product from you.
Satisfied customers can become unpaid ambassadors for your business, so 
customer satisfaction should be on the top of your to-do list. People tend to 
believe the opinions of people they know. People trust friends over adver-
tisements any day. They know that advertisements are paid to tell the “good 

40
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
side” and that they’re used to persuade them to purchase products and ser-
vices. By continually monitoring your customer’s satisfaction after the sale, 
you have the ability to avoid negative word-of-mouth advertising.
Avoiding dissatisfaction before and during the sale
 
You can help your customers remain happy with their purchases by
 
✓ Making sure your products and services deliver on their promises. 
Offer quality products and services, and market them in a way that will 
meet the expectation of the customer. For example, if you know a prod-
uct isn’t meant for children, don’t market it as a product for children. If 
you know the product will only last 60 days, don’t market it as if it will 
last 90 days. And if you know a product has an unfavorable flavor, don’t 
fool folks and say it tastes great.
 
 Set the expectation in the way you market as well as in your marketing 
message. Refer to Chapter 15 for more on drafting your marketing 
message.
 
✓ Mitigating cognitive dissonance. You mitigate cognitive dissonance by 
 
• Summarizing the product’s benefits after the purchase
 
• Repeating to the customer why the product is better than the 
alternatives
 
• Emphasizing how satisfied the customer will be
 
• Providing toll-free numbers to encourage communication after the 
sale
 
• Offering liberalized return and refund polices and making your 
customer aware of them
Following up after the sale and handling dissatisfaction
After the sale or provision of service, it’s important as a businessperson that 
you help customers deal with post-purchase discomfort. As part of your cus-
tomer’s purchase analysis, she’s trying to reassure herself that her choice 
was the wise one. The more you’re able to show her that you’re available, 
the less remorse she’ll feel. She’ll feel value by your attentiveness after the 
sale rather than just during it. This decreases the chance for buyer’s remorse 
and increases the chances of her recommending you to others. This situation 
happens even more when you’re in the business of selling high-involvement 
products (see the section on Phase 3, earlier in this chapter, for a discussion 
of high- and low-involvement purchases).
To ensure overall satisfaction and a repeat purchase, train your staff on how 
to deal with customer complaints, and implement a follow-up program that 
includes a post-purchase evaluation. This assessment, which is performed on 
customers after they’ve purchased from you, helps to gauge their satisfaction 

41
 Chapter 2: Understanding How Consumers Make Purchase Decisions
with not only the product, but their overall shopping experience with you. 
The evaluation can be done electronically, by mail, or by telephone.
 
By developing post-purchase activities and services, you have the ability to 
reduce a customer’s anxiety, build goodwill, and lay the groundwork for future 
sales. A post-purchase evaluation reduces any uncertainty or doubt within 
your customers by assuring them that you’re there to make sure they’re 
happy and their needs have been met by their purchases.
You conduct a post-purchase evaluation by
 
✓ Using customer-satisfaction surveys
 
✓ Making follow-up phone calls
 
✓ Mailing cards or letters
 
✓ Sending e-mail follow-ups
Sometimes a customer is dissatisfied with her purchase despite your best 
efforts to satisfy her, and she may ultimately return the product or demand 
a refund for the service you provided. What do you do in this situation? 
The good news is that you can turn the situation around by viewing it as an 
opportunity to satisfy the consumer’s need rather than viewing it as a loss. 
Then you try to meet that need. Be grateful that the consumer brought the 
problem to your attention for resolution.
 
If your customer isn’t satisfied, you must evaluate whether the product you 
sold her was deficient or whether the customer’s expectations were too high. 
To do this, examine the quality of the product and how you marketed the 
product, and then gauge how often a customer complains about the product. 
Are you receiving multiple complaints? If so, tally those complaints to deter-
mine the root of the problem. If you have only received a few complaints, 
determine whether the complaints are the same. If they are, the problem 
could be with the product rather than with the customer’s expectations or 
experience.

W
hen you understand consumer behavior, you can improve your 
marketing strategy. This knowledge of consumer behavior helps 
you understand issues such as how the consumer thinks, feels, reasons, and 
selects between alternatives. You can use this knowledge to create effective 
marketing campaigns.
A lot of components go into creating your marketing strategy. If done cor-
rectly, your marketing strategy can be used as a detailed road map that com-
bines your consumer behavior knowledge with your marketing initiatives to 
achieve your business goals.
Consumer behavior allows you to understand your customers and stay close 
to them, and your marketing strategy helps you to effectively reach out to 
them. In this chapter, you explore how to apply consumer behavior to your 
own marketing strategy.
Knowing Where You’re Going: Defining 
Your Marketing Objectives
Marketing objectives, which are goals that you have set to accomplish by 
using your marketing program, are put into place with the hopes that your 
marketing leads to sales. Your marketing objectives help you to identify 
the goals and then create the process and initiatives you put into place to 
achieve those goals.

44
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
It’s crucial that your entire marketing strategy supports your marketing 
objectives, because your strategy is used to guide you step by step to the 
success of those objectives. Marketing objectives should be in line with your 
company’s growth and sales goals as well. You define the growth that you 
want to occur and then you determine what goals you will set that correlate 
with the marketing of your company.
 
Your marketing strategy is wholly based on your predictions and assessment 
of your customers’ behavior, so before you even start strategizing, you need 
to get your marketing objectives in place. Your objectives need to be
 
✓ Clear: Your objectives must be easy to understand and specific. Can you 
look at your objective with clarity? Is it clear to you what that objective 
means to you and your company?
 
✓ Measurable: You must be able to measure your objectives by percent-
age, quantity, or revenue. How much do you want to sell? What percent-
age do you want to grow?
 
✓ Time specific: An objective that isn’t time specific will never occur, 
because it will always be seen as a future objective rather than a goal 
with a timeline.
Here are a few examples of marketing objectives that meet the previous criteria:
Increase product awareness by 20 percent in the next six months.
Educate my target audience about the benefits, features, and functionality 
of my product and by doing so increase my sales by 35 percent in the next 
year.
Increase our database by 15,000 names in the next 90 days.
 
If you have more than one marketing objective, it’s important that they not 
conflict with one another. They should all be working toward the same goal. 
For example, you don’t want to set a marketing objective to promote a prod-
uct or service that you plan to phase out. If you have an objective that’s in 
conflict with other objectives, you will likely hinder the success of your mar-
keting strategy and plan.
As you implement your marketing strategy, consistently gauge these objec-
tives over time to ensure that you’re moving in the right direction and that 
your marketing is achieving your goals.

 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
Understanding How You Get There: 
The Four Ps of Marketing Strategy
Before I can discuss the components of your marketing strategy and how you 
can use market research to form each part of your strategic marketing plan, I 
must first explain the four main areas of interest in marketing (called the four 
Ps) and note why each one is an important part of your overall plan.
The four Ps (product, promotion, price, placement) provide you with the 
foundation that your marketing plan is built around. You could almost 
describe them as the skeletal system that supports your plan. Your products 
represent what your target market is looking for. The price of the product 
gauges what your products will sell for in the marketplace based on your 
selected target market and what that market can afford. Place refers to how 
you distribute your products, and, of course, promotion is how you promote 
products to your target market.
 
If one of your four Ps isn’t defined, it’s nearly impossible to create an effective 
marketing strategy. Say, for example, that you have the perfect place in mind 
and you have terrific ideas on how to promote, but you really haven’t defined 
the price at which you’ll offer your products. In this case, you’ll be able to dis-
tribute your products and promote them, but how will consumers know what 
they have to pay to purchase them? I know this is an extreme example, but it 
shows you why having all four Ps clearly defined can help in creating a suc-
cessful strategy.
Take a look at this rundown of all the components that make up the four Ps 
of marketing strategy:
 
✓ Product: Your product strategy works to define your products and 
determine who they’re targeted to and what benefits they offer to 
consumers. It also singles out the differences between your products 
and those of your competitors. When I speak of product, I’m referring 
to something that’s marketed to consumers in exchange for money or 
another unit of value.
 
 In the case of consumer packaged goods, retail, and business-to-business 
companies, the product is a tangible object. When it comes to a service 
business, however, the product takes the form of an intangible offering, 
such as a true benefit or future promise. All products are offerings to the 
consumer, but remember that there’s an inherent difference between 
what’s sold by a retailer and what’s sold by a service firm, and the way 
you present that offering depends in part on whether it’s a tangible 
object or an intangible service.
 
 When selling a product that a consumer can touch and feel, you must 
focus on the benefits, features, and customer service that you offer 
surrounding that product. When selling a service, you must sell on the 

46
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
perceived value because a consumer can’t touch, see, or feel the prod-
uct that you’re offering. Instead, your strategy must be centered on 
testimonials or recent work you’ve completed. It’s vital to focus on how 
your service can help consumers achieve their desired results. You can 
still find strength in focusing on the benefits of the service you offer, but 
you must have something to back your claims. After all, the consumers 
aren’t walking out with something tangible, and really their purchase is 
only as good as your word.
 
✓ Promotion: The promotion element of your marketing mix consists of 
two-way communication that’s used to inform, persuade, and remind 
consumers. Your promotion strategy outlines the promotion tools that 
you plan to use to accomplish your marketing goals, from advertising to 
public relations and everything in between.
 
 Promotion strategy is an important part of the overall marketing mix 
because it defines how you’ll promote your products and what methods 
you’ll use for the different products you offer and the different market 
segments you’re trying to reach. You could almost call it your “commu-
nication plan” because it really does define how you will communicate 
your product to your target market.
 
 Many new business owners or inexperienced marketers tend to think 
that a promotion plan is the only plan needed in your marketing strat-
egy. However, promotion is only one piece to the puzzle. If you haven’t 
defined your products, prices, or placement, how can you promote what 
you’re offering?
 
✓ Price: Price always seems to be one area that business owners struggle 
with. And why not? Price is one of the most important business deci-
sions you make. You must set a price that allows your target market to 
afford your product and what you have to offer, but at the same time 
you need to produce a profit for your company.
 
✓ Placement: Placement is often known as distribution and refers to how 
you get your products or services from your hands to the hands of your 
customers — that is, it determines which distribution channels you’ll use. 
Distribution channels fall into one of two camps: direct and indirect. 
Direct channels go straight from you to the end consumer. Indirect chan-
nels go from you to an agent that sells the product or service to the end 
consumer (or to another agent, who then sells to the end consumer).
 
 When creating your placement market strategy, you have to define the 
best way for a transaction to transpire and then determine what medi-
ums you’ll use to get it done. When you look at product, price, and pro-
motion, it’s always important to consider placement, because without 
it you haven’t defined the means in which you pass on the product. So 
your market strategy wouldn’t be complete.

47
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
Product: Developing and Selling 
a Marketable Product or Service
Your product strategy lays the groundwork that your other Ps of marketing 
will work around. You can’t determine price, placement, or promotion with-
out first identifying the details around your products.
The focus of your product strategy is on the goods or services that you 
offer to your consumers. A thorough product strategy includes information 
regarding features, benefits, customer service, and warranty details. It also 
defines the target market for each product that you offer and who that prod-
uct appeals to.
Assembling the components 
of your product strategy
In order to have a clear definition of your products and an understanding of 
who you’re targeting with your products, your product strategy must do the 
following:
 
✓ Clearly identify and define the offering.
 
✓ Describe the offering.
 
✓ Label the offering with a memorable name.
 
✓ Describe the offering’s functionality, features, and benefits.
 
✓ Evaluate the offering’s adaptability — that is, the measurement of accep-
tance in the current marketplace, gauging the ease of change if the mar-
ketplace is to experience a change in demand or benefits and features
In the following sections, I give you an overview of what each of those tasks 
entails.
Product or product line identification and definition
Your product is the item or service you’ll be offering to your customers. You 
need to identify and explain your product from the customer point of view in 
order to really focus on the benefits and features that your product offers.
You also must determine whether you’re offering one product or a line of 
products. After you’ve made that decision, create a product definition, which 
explains the purpose of your product and how it serves your consumers. I 
know what you’re thinking: “Why do I need to have a product definition?” 
Here’s why: Most business success or failure is determined by its product 
definition.

48
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
 
Your product definition serves as the explanation of “why” behind the con-
sumer purchase. Why should consumers choose your product? What benefits 
and features are you offering that they need? Your product definition should 
answer these questions. A clear definition also helps you with the other com-
ponents in your product strategy.
Product name
Your product name helps consumers recognize your product in the market-
place. Name recognition is important to standing out from among your com-
petitors. Keep in mind that even though your name doesn’t have to be flashy, 
it does need to be memorable. When naming your product, also take into 
consideration who your consumers are and what will appeal to them.
The name that you choose will follow your product throughout its lifetime 
and can impact the perception consumers have regarding your product, so 
this isn’t a step you want to rush through. Brainstorm, gather ideas, ask for 
opinions, and then test the name you’ve chosen. You want to be happy with 
your first choice, because it’s extremely difficult to go through a product 
name change and come out successful.
 
If you’re offering your product in foreign countries, make sure that the prod-
uct name is translated correctly and that the name of your product doesn’t 
carry negative connotations.
Product description
Your customers obviously need to know what you want to sell them. So 
that’s where the product description comes in. To create a product descrip-
tion, you simply state what your product is in one sentence.
 
This step should be a little easier than the development of your definition, 
because your definition actually helps you in this phase. You use your prod-
uct description to explain the details of why your product works to fulfill the 
product definition you’ve created.
For example, if your product is a dish soap, your product definition may look 
like this:
DW Dish Soap washes dishes.
Your product description, on the other hand, may look like this:
DW Dish Soap washes dishes in 1/3 of the time when compared to other 
leading brands, and it leaves hands smooth at the same time.
While your product definition is the why, your description incorporates the 
benefits of the product and describes the product in a way that makes con-
sumers want to purchase your product rather than a competitor’s.

49
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
Description of functionality and list of features and benefits
In order to begin to understand the product from your consumer’s viewpoint, 
you need to list and identify the functionality, features, and benefits of your 
product. You want this to be a detailed description of not only current func-
tions, benefits, and features but also of future enhancements that you’re 
considering. The benefit of this consideration is that it helps you keep tabs 
on the pulse of your industry and your competitors. By the way, a feature rep-
resents what a product has. A benefit, on the other hand, is what a product 
does. Functionality describes how the product works.
When positioning your product, you’ll use this list of features, benefits, and 
functionality extensively, so don’t skip this step. You can read more about 
positioning in Chapter 16.
Evaluation of product adaptability
The more adaptable your product is to consumers, the easier it will be to sell 
in a competitive market. The point of this step is to enable you to sit down 
and not only evaluate the current market that you’re selling your product to, 
but also to evaluate and anticipate change that may happen in the market-
place in the future.
 
Product adaptability is about forecasting the market for your product in 
the future and gauging your ability to meet anticipated changes when they 
happen. Why is this important to your marketing strategy? If you can antici-
pate change before your competitors and take action first, you’re a step ahead 
of the game. If your competitors do this and you don’t, you’ll always be one 
step behind. If you find that your product or service isn’t as adaptable as it 
needs to be, you may want to consider ways you can increase its adaptability 
in the marketplace.
Seeing how consumer behavior 
affects your product strategy
When you have an understanding of consumer behavior — specifically the 
behavior of your potential consumers — you can accurately determine what 
products your customers are looking for. You can then use that knowledge 
to create a product strategy that will enhance the chances of your products 
being successful in the marketplace. You can do this because you have an 
understanding of what the consumer is looking for and what benefits and fea-
tures will move them to purchase from you and not from your competitors.
Companies that have a grasp on consumer behavior more often develop 
products that contain the features and benefits that the market demands, 
and they almost always come out ahead of their competition. The following 
sections show you how to use consumer behavior research as you craft each 
part of your own product strategy.

50
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Consumer behavior and your product identification
You want to analyze and define objectively what you’re selling, based on why 
people want to buy it. It’s important to remember that consumers purchase 
because of needs and desires. When you can take a step into their shoes and 
view your product in the same way they will, you can better entice them to 
make a purchase.
Consumers go through a series of steps before making a purchase; you can 
guide them through each one of those steps by not only objectively looking 
at your product and pointing out features and benefits, but also by counter-
acting any negative feelings a consumer may have about your product. (Refer 
to Chapter 2 to gain a better understanding regarding the decision-making 
process.)
 
You want your product definition to be:
 
✓ Specific: It must be easy to understand and clearly identifiable by the 
consumer.
 
✓ Marketable: It must carry marketing value. In other words, you need to 
determine why consumers should pay attention to your product.
 
✓ Profitable: Obviously the goal of the product definition is to make a con-
sumer want to purchase that product and provide you with a profit.
 
✓ Achievable: Your definition must be true and the consumer who pur-
chases your product must be able to see the truth. For example, you 
don’t want to say that your dish soap softens hands when it doesn’t 
actually do so.
 
✓ Vision matching: Your product must meet the vision you’ve created in 
your product definition.
 
✓ Easily understood: Flashy or wordy definitions often only confuse con-
sumers, so make sure yours is easily understood. Would a fifth-grade 
student understand your product definition? If not, it may be time to 
reconsider a rewrite.
 
✓ Easily communicated: Can your definition be easily communicated or 
are consumers stumbling over your message and having to review it sev-
eral times to get your point? The goal is to be able to use your product 
definition in a way that consumers have an understanding of that prod-
uct within 30 seconds.
An example of a product definition might be “one-of-a-kind, hand-crafted 
engagement rings for women.” You can see how this example fits each of the 
previous requirements:
 
✓ Specific: It tells the consumer exactly what the product is.
 
✓ Marketable: The rings are one-of-a-kind and hand-crafted.

51
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
 
✓ Profitable: A consumer would want to make a purchase based on this 
definition if she were looking for a one-of-a-kind ring.
 
✓ Achievable: If the consumer purchases the ring, it will be one-of-a-kind 
and no one else will have one like it.
 
✓ Vision matching: If the consumer is looking for a one-of-a-kind, 
hand-crafted ring (and that’s what she visualizes when reading your 
product description), she can in fact purchase a ring that meets that 
visualization.
 
✓ Easy to understand: When a consumer reads this description, she will 
know exactly what she is getting.
 
✓ Easily communicated: You can explain what the product is in 30 sec-
onds or less and the consumer walks away with a clear understanding.
Consumer behavior and your product name
Creating a product name is the fun phase of product strategy. However, keep 
in mind that when crafting your product name, it’s more important to be 
descriptive than creative. Often people try to be so creative that their prod-
uct names hide the messages of what their products do. And make sure that 
your name is memorable, relevant, and of course, easy to pronounce. It’s 
important to understand that if your product name is difficult to pronounce 
or spell, consumers will have trouble finding your product or asking for it by 
name.
Consumers often purchase based on emotion, and studies have shown that 
product names that focus on emotions tend to sell better than those that 
simply focus on function. So if you really want to be creative when develop-
ing your product name, concentrate more on creating a descriptive product 
name that focuses on emotion rather than a function. An example of this is 
the fragrance put out by Clinique called Happy. Consumers have the percep-
tion that if they wear this fragrance they will be happy. So clearly this influ-
ences their decision to purchase the fragrance.
Your product name is dependent on who your target market is as well. If your 
target is edgy and more alternative, you need to create a name that attracts 
them. If you’re dealing more with seniors, however, your name will be very 
different. You know your target market more than anyone else (or at least 
you should!), so choose a name that appeals to that market.
One of the best ways to determine a name for a product is to spend a few 
moments brainstorming. However, you need to follow these rules:
 
✓ You can’t reject or criticize any idea.
 
✓ Consider this free-form brain dump. In other words, write down any-
thing that comes to mind. Write down a few adjectives, and then grab a 
thesaurus and let your mind wander.

52
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
 
✓ Keep a written record of everything. Keeping your thoughts locked up in 
your brain isn’t enough — you’re human, so you’ll forget things.
 
✓ When you have a list of ideas, rank them one by one.
 
✓ Evaluate pros and cons for each idea.
 
✓ Get the opinion of trusted external sources.
 
If your product is an extension of a product line, be sure the name fits in with 
brand structure of that product line and offers you the possibility for product 
add-ons.
Consumer behavior and your product description
When crafting a product or service description, your goal is to address your 
chosen consumers specifically and tell them in one sentence what the prod-
uct or service can do for them. To do so, you need to determine whether 
your offering is a product, a service, a solution, a feature, an accessory, a 
tool, or some other thing. Come up with a noun that describes your item.
Now use this formula as a guideline when creating your own description, 
plugging the noun into the (Product) slot:
(Target Audience), (Product Name) is the type of (Product) that 
(Performs this Task).
If the formula doesn’t fit your product, don’t worry. It’s just a tool you can 
use if you choose to.
 
It’s critical that you explain in only one clear sentence why your product is 
perfect for a specific buyer and what it does best. The reason this is so impor-
tant is because clarity and the ability to communicate the purpose of the 
product is crucial. If you’re using more than one sentence, the description can 
become difficult to understand, and worse yet difficult to remember. The more 
sentences and words used, the less clarity in the description. I know it seems 
like a mouthful, but you can do it.
Here are a few examples of what a good product description looks like:
Kids, Icy Milk is the type of beverage that quenches your thirst in an instant.
Moms, Quicky Detergent is the type of simple laundry detergent that gets all 
stains out in the first wash.
As you can see, these examples aren’t long. They’re to the point, but they 
address your audience and get right to the benefits of the product.

53
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
Consumer behavior and your description of functionality, 
features, and benefits
The idea of consumer behavior is that you can take the knowledge of why 
your consumers behave the way they do and use that information to increase 
the chances of them purchasing from you. In order to do this, you must 
define the target market that you’re aiming toward and single out the benefits 
and features that matter to that specific target market.
The following steps help you identify functionality, features, and benefits of 
your product:
 
1. Evaluate each feature, benefit, and function to determine how your 
consumer will see that the product has value.
 
 List each one by one on a piece of paper. Doing so will help you recog-
nize the consumer’s need or want that you’re satisfying. And remember 
that purchases are made based on a need or want that a consumer feels.
 
2. Investigate the product by asking current customers how they use it 
and what they like about it.
 
 This investigation can help you identify whether you need to make any 
product changes to enhance the experience your consumer is having 
with your product. Seeing how consumers are using your product can 
make you aware of any unusual usages, thereby inspiring you with new 
product ideas.
 
3. Evaluate whether your product delivers true benefits, features, and 
functionality.
 
 The more a product brings to the table, the more the importance of 
price diminishes. Consumers don’t purchase based on price; they pur-
chase based on benefits. So by evaluating the benefits, you can analyze 
whether your product is delivering in the way that you intended it to. It 
also allows you to see changes or enhancements that you need to make 
in order to create customer loyalty.
 
Keep in mind that all products and services have obvious benefits to your 
consumers, such as price and convenience of distribution, but there are also 
hidden benefits like customer service and guarantees. Don’t forget these. By 
finding these hidden benefits and bringing them to the forefront, you have the 
ability to make your product more valuable in the mind of your consumers. 
For example, a consumer may walk into your place of business to purchase 
your product because of the convenience and price that you offer, but when 
you share with him the exceptional customer service that he will receive or 
the guarantee surrounding your product, he will have a higher perceived 
value of purchasing from you.

54
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
After you’ve identified each feature, function, or benefit, prioritize them 
according to your market segments and the target markets within that seg-
ment that you want to reach. This prioritization can help you determine 
development of the product going forward.
Consumer behavior and your product’s adaptability
When evaluating product adaptability, you’re assessing the flexibility that 
your product has to adjust to market demands and changes. When consum-
ers purchase a product, they often evaluate the value of that product and 
whether it’s adaptable to their lifestyle. Lack of adaptability can detour a con-
sumer from the purchase.
For example, consider the VCR. This dinosaur of the electronic world is an 
item that few consumers purchase. That’s because they can now purchase a 
DVD player, which provides a much better picture. Companies that manufac-
tured VCRs began to evaluate the adaptability and realized that soon there 
wouldn’t be a market for these electronics. Many of them moved right into 
manufacturing DVD players so they wouldn’t lose the market share they had 
gained with the VCRs.
The following five factors help you measure the adaptability of your product:
 
✓ Attractiveness: It’s important that you can entice consumers to try your 
product and allow them to experience it before purchasing. Samples 
and trials are great for this, because they allow consumers to begin the 
adaptation process of changing products without financial risk. It also 
shows that you believe so much in your product that you’re willing to let 
consumers “try before they buy.”
 
✓ Compatibility: You want your product to fit the usage of consumers 
today. If it doesn’t, consumers simply won’t purchase from you.
 
✓ Complexity: You must offer a product that consumers understand. Even 
though you may feel that your product is innovative and presents a 
new way of doing things, your consumers may not necessarily see it the 
same way. And then they won’t make the purchase. It’s vital that con-
sumers understand not only the benefits, but the purpose behind your 
product.
 
✓ Product advantage: You want to be able to stand against your competi-
tors and be the product that consumers choose. If you can’t identify an 
advantage, consumers won’t be able to either.
 
✓ Visibility: It’s easier for consumers to adapt to a new product when they 
see others using the product successfully. You want your product to be 
visible to consumers, because the visibility diminishes the fear of the 
unknown.

55
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
 
By evaluating the adaptability of your product, you can see how flexible your 
product is and how flexible your consumers believe it to be. Consumers don’t 
particularly embrace change, so if they can view a product as easy to use, you 
will decrease their anxiety about making the purchase. Evaluating adaptabil-
ity helps when creating your marketing plan, because if your product proves 
to be adaptable in the marketplace, you can use that as a benefit to your 
product. If you find that your product isn’t as adaptable as it needs to be, you 
can begin to make the necessary changes to appeal to consumers. When you 
attain an appropriate level of adaptability, you create a stability that allows 
you to adapt without shaking the core of what your product represents.
Promotion: Deciding How You’ll 
Spread the Word
Your promotion strategy is the part of your marketing strategy that explains 
how you’ll bridge the gap between the places where you’re selling your prod-
uct or service and the places and ways your customers gather and absorb 
information. A complete promotion strategy contains a description of the 
promotion methods you’ll use in your marketing plan. The following sections 
highlight those methods and explain how consumer behavior knowledge 
affects their presence in your marketing mix.
Perusing the possibilities
You can promote your products in a variety of ways. In fact, it’s always good 
to use a mixture of methods that can help you reach your target market. In 
this section, I show you the different methods of promotion. To give you an 
overview, here are the methods I cover:
✓ Advertising
✓ Marketing collateral
✓  Media relations 
campaigns
✓ Promotional activities
✓ Publications
✓  Public speaking and 
conferences
Advertising
Advertising is the impersonal form of promotion. It’s considered impersonal 
because it deals with general messages that aren’t directed at one specific 
person. Instead, it’s delivered to a variety of media outlets and is directed at 
an entire target market. The objective of advertising is to saturate your target 
market with your name. You typically use advertising to reach mass amounts 
of people at one time.

56
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Examples of advertising include the following:
 
✓ Print advertising: Programs for events, trade journals, magazines, and 
newspapers
 
✓ Direct mail: Postcards, special offer letters, and coupons
 
✓ Outdoor advertising: Billboards and bus boards
 
✓ Broadcast advertising: Radio, television, and podcast
Marketing collateral
Marketing collateral is promotional material such as a brochure, newsletter, 
flyer, or poster. It’s a great tool for informing consumers of your products 
and services — even when you aren’t around. Marketing collateral is that 
memorable piece that consumers take with them in order to remember to 
contact you. You can create your marketing piece in a way that answers the 
questions of consumers and speaks directly to them. It lasts longer than a 
30-second advertisement and can be designed to explain your product or ser-
vice in detail.
Media relations campaign
A media relations campaign is about contacting and staying in touch with 
targeted members of the media. This type of promotional activity is great if 
you think your company would benefit from being mentioned in a newspaper, 
magazine, or a television broadcast. A great way to get started in a media 
campaign is by writing press releases and developing a press kit that you can 
send to media outlets.
 
Your story must be newsworthy if you’re going to be picked up by the media. 
They received hundreds of submissions daily, so make your pitch interesting 
and unique.
Promotional activities
Promotional activities generate awareness and recognition in the market. In 
other words, they’re great for letting people know that your company exists. 
With these activities, consumers gain a deeper understanding of who you are 
and what you do. You can participate in a variety of promotional activities. 
Here are a few examples:
✓ Community projects
✓ Contests or sweepstakes
✓  Coupons and product 
samples
✓ Fairs or festivals
✓ Giveaways
✓  Sponsorships for special 
events
✓ Trade shows

57
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
You can find promotional activities to participate in no matter what your 
marketing budget is. The best way to find these activities is to find com-
panies that serve the same target market as you, and then research where 
they’re speaking, what trade shows they’re attending, and which commu-
nity projects they’re involved in. (Refer to Chapter 12 for more information 
regarding market research.)
Publications
Publications are similar to public speaking and conferences, because by 
being published in trade publications you’re projecting yourself as a cred-
ible source and expert in your industry. A publication can be anything from a 
newsletter or magazine to a trade journal or book.
 
Don’t confuse publications with media relations campaigns, however. Being 
published in publications is about providing education without the idea of 
promotion behind it.
Public speaking and conferences
Making speeches at conferences, professional association meetings, and 
other events position you and your company as experts in the field. This 
form of promotion is also a fantastic way to make new contacts that can 
eventually lead to sales. You’ll find that this activity increases your cred-
ibility within your target market, and in return, the credibility will drive your 
sales up. As with publications, this method is less about advertising and 
more about educating.
Developing a consumer-centric 
promotion strategy
Consumer behavior explains the “why” behind a consumer’s purchase. When 
you understand the “why,” you can create a promotion strategy that speaks 
directly to that consumer. In other words, understanding your consumers 
enables you to recognize their needs, motivations, attitudes, and intentions 
to buy. Then you can create a promotion strategy that supports those behav-
iors and moves consumers to purchase directly from you.
Knowledge of your customers’ behavior affects the various components of 
your promotion strategy in many ways. I explain in the following list:
 
✓ Advertising: Advertising doesn’t drive an immediate purchase. That’s 
because customers can’t quickly purchase a product when they see it 
advertised. Think about it this way: You post a billboard and your tar-
geted consumer is driving 75 mph down the freeway to get to work on 
time (or to get home for the night). The chances of that person being 
able to immediately purchase your product are slim to none. However, 

58
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
with that mind, remember that the billboard may trigger a need or serve 
as a reminder to consumers that they need to make a purchase. This 
reminder may then entice them to contact you when they’re ready to 
make the purchase.
 
 Some methods of advertising are easing the ability for consumers to 
quickly react to an advertisement. An example is online advertisements. 
Say that a consumer is browsing her favorite news portal and your ad is 
displayed. She can quickly (and simply) click on that ad and be immedi-
ately driven to a Web site where she can purchase your product.
 
✓ Marketing collateral: You normally won’t see an immediate purchase 
from these promotional tools. They’re created to serve as a reminder to 
your consumer, because typically the consumer takes the marketing col-
lateral home to evaluate and contemplate the purchase. Your collateral 
can be used to identify, recognize, and speak directly to the needs of 
your consumers. In doing so, it also presents to them the benefits they 
receive when they purchase your product. If your collateral is created 
in an effective way, it’s like sending a member of your sales team home 
with your consumer.
 
✓ Media relations campaign: Media relations campaigns don’t carry as 
much credibility as public speaking, conferences, and publications, 
but there’s something to be said for creating media campaigns that 
are informative and educational. Most consumers must see a message 
approximately seven times before making a purchase, so media relations 
campaigns are one way to achieve that goal.
 
 The important thing to remember with media relations campaigns is not 
to make them sales oriented. Instead, give the consumers something of 
value — something that educates them so they walk away with a per-
ceived value that makes you memorable to them.
 
✓ Promotional activities: Promotional activities create not only awareness 
about your company and products, but they also create a trust around 
your company. This trust eases the mind of your consumer when she’s 
making a purchase. In other words, she won’t have to fear that you’re 
here today and gone tomorrow.
 
✓ Publications: Publications are similar to public speaking and conferences; 
the difference is that with publications, you can often reach a broader 
audience to share your knowledge with. When you have been published 
in a trade magazine or a journal that your target reads, you have created 
almost instant credibility and trust with potential consumers.
 
✓ Public speaking and conferences: Public speaking and conferences 
tend to carry the most weight in light of consumer behavior. That’s 
because you’re presenting to an audience that contains your target 
market. You’re sharing with them a topic that they’re interested in, and 
they can see your knowledge firsthand. These activities also create a 
level of trust and enhance your credibility as the expert in the market. 
This type of promotion is most beneficial if you’re a company that offers 
more service-oriented products.

59
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
Pricing: Offering Deals That Goldilocks 
Would Find Enticing
Your price strategy helps you determine and set the prices for your product 
or service. It’s important to your marketing strategy because it can often 
mean the difference between success and failure. Your price depends a lot on 
who your target market is and the prices that your competitors set.
For instance, you can’t succeed when you offer a product that your target 
market can’t afford. Similarly, you won’t survive if your competitors are 
underpricing you and your consumers can’t see the value of spending more 
to buy your product.
 
An effective price strategy takes into account the cost of production, the 
demand, the target market, and the necessary revenue needed to keep your 
businesses alive and thriving.
Creating a marketing budget
Business owners often ask how much they 
should spend on their marketing budget. You 
can choose from different methods to deter-
mine your budget; it really comes down to your 
business and what works for you. You can 
determine your budget by:
 ✓ Allocating a percentage of your revenue
 ✓ Allocating a percentage of your net sales
 ✓ Allocating all profits back into your busi-
ness for marketing
Allocating a percentage of your revenue is one 
of the most popular ways to determine your 
budget. The formula is easy. You simply take a 
fixed percentage of everything that your com-
pany brings in and allocate that amount for 
marketing. Common percentages are anywhere 
from 5 to 10 percent for big businesses, approxi-
mately 20 percent for smaller businesses, and 2 
to 5 percent for larger businesses that are pull-
ing in millions of dollars worth of revenue.
Allocating a percentage of your net sales is a 
method that’s similar to the previous one. The 
difference is that you’re only allocating a fixed 
percentage of your net sales. This method isn’t 
as aggressive as the previous method, because 
you’ll be excluding expenses from your revenue.
Allocating all profits back into your business 
for marketing is a more aggressive approach, 
especially for small businesses. You’ll find 
that there’s a little more risk involved with this 
method. You take the revenue that you make, 
subtract the expenses that keep the business 
alive, and put the remainder right back into 
marketing. The trick to this method is having a 
backup source of revenue.
It’s important to remember that a marketing 
budget is only a projection or an estimate of 
what you will spend in marketing. Sometimes 
your spending will be more or less than your 
estimated budget. By having a budget, you have 
something to work from. With no budget, you’re 
simply setting yourself up for marketing failure.

60
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Evaluating the factors of pricing strategy
Your pricing strategy offers a lot of flexibility. It isn’t just about the price tag 
of your product; the perks and payment options that you offer to your con-
sumers are also important. Here’s a rundown of these factors, which I explain 
in more detail in the following sections:
 
✓ Your price is what you sell your product for. You could call this the prod-
uct price. It’s the price that your market can pay for a specific product.
 
✓ Perks include discounts, rebates, or incentives that you offer when a 
consumer purchases your product.
 
✓ Payment options represent the different ways a consumer can pay for 
your product. Those options may include cash, check, credit card, 
financing deferred payments, or payment plans.
Pricing (cost-based and value-based)
When deciding on pricing for your product, you have to compare the two 
different methods before making any solid decisions: cost-based pricing and 
value-based pricing. Cost-based pricing is a method of pricing in which you 
determine a fixed sum or percentage that’s added to the cost of the product. 
This sum or percentage represents the profit your company makes when the 
product is purchased by a consumer. Value-based pricing, on the other hand, 
is a method of pricing that’s determined by the price you believe that your 
consumers will pay for the product.
 
Which method is best for you? It depends on the type of business you run, the 
market influence you carry, and the competition that surrounds you. Cost-
based pricing works well for companies that deal with the sale of large quanti-
ties and whose markets are saturated with competitive pricing. Value-based 
pricing works well for companies that have strong benefits and can prove 
their advantage over competitors because they carry a higher perceived value 
that consumers can see and are willing to pay. By understanding what your 
customers perceive as value, you can begin to understand the maximum price 
they will pay for your product or service.
Some examples of cost-based pricing strategies are as follows:
 
✓ Initial profit strategy: With this strategy, you establish a higher price 
to make a profit initially. Typically you would use this strategy to cover 
costs of research and development time. You may also use this method 
to maximize your profits before competitors hit your market.
 
✓ Quick sales strategy: To apply this strategy, set a low price on one or 
more of your products. This helps to drive in revenue by using a quick-
sale method. You can then use this revenue to support other products 
and developments in progress.

61
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
 
✓ Profit goal strategy: For this strategy, you create a profit goal and then 
set your prices to meet that goal. For example, say you have a goal to 
reach a 35 percent profit per unit and you’re selling your units for $10. 
You can increase that unit price to $13.50 to achieve the goal.
Here are a few strategies you can use to determine what your consumer 
views as value pricing:
 
✓ Same price strategy: When applying this strategy, you price your prod-
uct the same as your competitors. However, with this strategy, you need 
to spend some time evaluating how you can lower your production cost 
in order to increase your profit margin.
 
✓ Go low strategy: With this strategy, you set a low price initially to cap-
ture a large number of customers in the marketplace. You can use this 
strategy to increase product awareness or to create an image of being 
the low-cost option. In order to use this strategy effectively, however, 
you have to maintain profitability at a lower price.
 
✓ Prestige pricing strategy: That’s right. This strategy has you marking that 
price up. You can get away with this method if your product carries a cer-
tain uniqueness or if you’re catering to an affluent market. By pricing your 
product on the high end, you create a certain “prestige” with its purchase.
 
 This is a risky strategy, so you must stay aware and be willing to lower 
your price if your consumers start thinking that you’re making too much 
of a profit.
Perks
Consumers like to know they got a deal. In fact, sometimes they’ll even pay 
more money if they can walk away feeling like they were the ones who ben-
efited. To give your consumers that feeling, try using the following perks:
 
✓ Discounts: A discount represents a reduction in the regular price of a 
product. If you aren’t rewarding your customers with discounts, you’re 
missing out. They tend to give customers a sense of loyalty and a desire 
to be a returning customer.
 
✓ Bundling: Bundling is a marketing strategy that combines several prod-
ucts as one combined product at a discounted price. Bundling enhances 
your offering, and it takes the thinking out of ordering. Bundling is ben-
eficial because you can increase the initial price tag and get consumers 
trying more of your products — while at the same time providing them 
with the feeling that they’re gaining value. It’s often seen as the win-win 
from both the company’s and the consumers’ perspectives.
 
 Bundling works. If you don’t believe me, ask the cable companies who 
now provide cable, Internet, and telephone at a bundled price. I guar-
antee you that by bundling, companies have increased their add-on 
sales. And what about those fast-food restaurants that now offer you the 
combo or meal deal? These are other bundling techniques.

Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
Payment options
In order for your business to be successful, you need to offer your customers 
convenient and easy ways to pay for your products and services. In fact, did 
you know that by offering several payment options, you can increase your sales?
Consider, for example, these recent statistics put out by the Federal Reserve: 
34 percent of consumers use credit or debit cards and 55 percent use cash or 
checks. So, if you don’t offer both credit and cash options, you could lose a 
significant amount of business. By offering several different payment options, 
you’re showing your customers that you’re flexible and willing to cater to 
their needs.
You can choose from many different payment options, including cash, check, 
credit cards, financing, deferred payment, and in-store payment plans. 
Choose the options that work best not only for your consumer but also for 
your business.
Linking consumer behavior 
to pricing strategy
Consumers don’t base their decisions solely on price, but price obviously 
does play a role. If the price is too high, consumers may not even take the 
time to learn more about the benefits that drive the price up. If a price is too 
low, they may not perceive any value in the product and will go for the com-
petitor’s product instead.
Pricing is always about value. If consumers see a higher value, paying the 
extra few dollars may not be an issue. But if they don’t see value in a product, 
it’s easier for them to walk away. It’s important to price within the value zone 
of consumers. In other words, if your price is higher than your competitor’s 
price, you must be able to explain why in order for a consumer to be willing 
to pay the extra money. If it’s less than your competition, you need to be able 
to explain why you’re able to sell the product for less while still providing a 
highly valuable product.
 
Before you can even begin to think about how to price your product, you need 
to know how much it costs you to produce and sell. Your break-even point is 
the point at which you’re neither making money nor losing it. Your break-even 
unit is how many units you must produce or sell to break even. The break-
even point and break-even unit are important to consumer behavior, because 
they allow you to see the room that you have to move in order to offer dis-
counts or free trials to potential new consumers. Check out the nearby side-
bar, “Calculating your break-even point and unit,” for more information.
The following sections provide information showing how consumer behavior 
can affect each component of your pricing strategy.

 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
Choosing your pricing method
Pricing can be considered one of the most difficult of the four Ps of marketing 
strategy. The reason for this is because there’s no single “right” method to 
pricing your product. You have to consider many things when pricing your 
product, including your position in the marketplace, the demand for your 
product, and the cost to produce your product.
You also have to determine the goal you’re trying to achieve in pricing. It 
isn’t always just to sell a product. For example, your goals may be any of the 
following:
 
✓ You may be looking for short-term revenue.
 
✓ You may want to price in order to sell in large quantities.
 
✓ You may want to maximize your profit margin.
 
✓ You may be looking to differentiate yourself in the marketplace.
Calculating your break-even point and unit
To determine your break-even point, you need 
to know what your fixed costs and variable 
costs are. Then you can simply plug these num-
bers into a formula. I start off by explaining both 
of these costs:
 ✓ Fixed costs: These costs make up your 
overhead. They’re expenses that don’t vary 
according to production rates. Examples 
of fixed costs are rent, office equipment, 
insurance, and utilities.
 ✓ Variable costs: These are the expenses 
that do vary with the amount of service 
provided or goods produced. Your variable 
costs include costs such as hourly pay and 
raw materials. Other variable costs include 
promotion and advertising expenses.
Here’s what the break-even formula looks like: 
(Fixed Costs) / (1 – (Variable cost per unit / 
Selling Price Per Unit)). To see how this for-
mula works, suppose you’re running a service 
business. Your fixed costs total $60,000. Your 
variable costs total $50 (you pay your consul-
tant $50 per hour). You sell consulting services 
at $125 per hour. So your formula to determine 
your break-even point looks like this:
 
 $60,000 / (1 – (50/125)) = $100,000
If you aren’t making $100,000, you can’t cover 
your costs. If you make more than $100,000, 
you’re making a profit.
After you figure out what you need when it 
comes to revenue for your business to survive, 
you need to determine how many units you must 
produce and sell to break even. In the previous 
example, your consultant makes $50 per hour. 
Your company bills out $125 per hour, so how 
many hours do you need to spend consulting in 
order to break even?
Your formula looks like this: (Fixed Costs) / (Unit 
Contribution Margin) = Number of Units Needed 
to Break Even. The Unit Contribution Margin is 
your selling price per unit minus your variable 
cost per unit. So here’s how it looks when you 
plug in the numbers:
 
 $60,000 / (125 – 50) = 800 units (hours per 
year)

Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
After you’ve considered the components of pricing and have determined the 
goal you’re trying to achieve, you have to align your findings with the behav-
ior of your consumers. Will they see value in the price you’ve chosen? How 
does your price compare to the prices of your competitors? Can you quantify 
the benefits of your product in order to show value to consumers? These 
questions are important to consider, because consumers don’t base their 
purchases on price alone; they base them on the value that the products 
bring to their needs or wants.
Dealing with discounts
Discounts work well when enticing consumers to try your product or to gain 
repeat business from consumers who have already purchased your product 
in the past but haven’t returned in a while. They’re also great when you’re 
looking for quick ways to achieve sales targets or short-term market gain.
 
Be careful not to overuse discounts, because overuse can diminish perceived 
value over time with consumers.
Say that you’re a business owner who’s running on a thin margin. You just 
don’t have a lot of profit margin to spare. How can you afford to offer dis-
counts to your consumers? Here are a few strategies that won’t make you dig 
too deep in your profit pocket:
 
✓ Prompt pay discount strategy: Offer cash discounts for customers who 
pay promptly. This strategy helps you maintain a steady cash flow and 
reduce what you may end up spending in collection costs.
 
✓ Quantity discount strategy: Offer a discount for customers who order a 
large number of products at a time. Typically the cost-per-unit declines 
as the quantity increases.
 
✓ ’Tis the season strategy: Offer seasonal discounts to customers who 
purchase items in the slow season, such as a lawn mower when it’s 
snowing. This type of discount helps you balance your cash flow and 
meet your production demands.
Evaluate the previous strategies and decide which ones work best for you. 
Keep in mind that value is important to consumers. So no matter what dis-
count strategy you choose, you must ensure that consumers see value in 
your offer.
Bundling products or services as a package deal
How can you create your own bundle? Think about the products that you offer 
that complement one another. Then take a look at your past sales reports, 
keeping consumer behavior in mind. What have your customers purchased 
from you in the past? What items do they typically purchase together? For 
example, if you’re selling toothpaste, how about adding a toothbrush to it — 
now you have a bundle.

65
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
 
If you still aren’t sure what bundles your customers would be interested in, 
ask them. You’d be surprised at what customers will tell you when you ask.
Offering various payment options
You not only want to offer the different payment options, but you also want 
to make sure that your customers are aware that you offer them. You can 
inform customers of payment options by mentioning the options in your mar-
keting collateral or by using signage where customers make their purchases.
You can offer payment plans if you sell high-priced items. These plans allow 
your consumers to pay over time rather than right away. The flexibility of 
payment plans often increases the sales of high-ticket items that consumers 
have trouble paying cash for upfront.
 
Payment options are often seen as positive by consumers, because you’re 
giving them options to obtain a product they need or want. Just make sure 
that consumers understand the terms of the payment options you offer. You 
don’t want to them to be disgruntled and feel that you talked them into terms 
that they didn’t agree to.
Placement: Getting Your Goods 
from Point A to Point Z
Your placement strategy defines how you distribute your product and what 
vehicles you use to do so. It also defines the locations where you’ll make 
your products available. When developing your placement strategy, it’s 
important to keep in mind that not all consumers shop the same way, so 
product placement is your key to getting your products in front of the right 
consumers at the right time.
You have several options to choose from when it comes to placements and 
distribution channels of your products. By placement, I mean how you get 
your products or services to your customers. You can select many methods, 
not just one. It simply depends on what works best for you and your place-
ment objectives.
Methods of distribution take three different forms — direct sales, indirect 
sales, or both. Here’s a rundown of these forms:
 
✓ Direct sales: When using the direct sales method, you’re selling directly 
to the customer or end-user. No one facilitates the sale between you and 
the customer. Examples of direct sales include catalog or Internet sales.

66
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
 
✓ Indirect sales: With the indirect sales method, you’re selling to someone 
who then sells your product or service to the end-user or distributes it 
to others who sell to the end-user. Indirect sales occur in two different 
outlets:
 
• Retail: When using the retail method, you’re selling to a retailer, 
which turns around and sells to the customer. An example of the 
retail method would include a farmer who sells his vegetables to 
the local grocery.
 
• Wholesale: When you use the wholesale method, you sell to a 
wholesaler or an agent, who in turn sells to a retailer. Typically the 
wholesaler or agent represents several companies, not just one. An 
example of this method would include a jewelry dealer who resells 
your product to several jewelry stores.
 
✓ Multilevel marketing: With multilevel marketing, you sell both directly 
to the customer or end-user and to other people who distribute and sell 
your product. An example of this method would include vitamins that 
are sold directly to consumers and to distributing partners that sell the 
vitamins to their consumers.
You can use many channels to sell your product, but you want to select chan-
nels that appeal to your target market. For example, if you’re selling software 
to teenagers, you may want to focus on the marketing channel that uses the 
Internet. This method would clearly target those who are interested in pur-
chasing your product. In other words, use your placement strategy to break 
down the distribution channels in accordance to where your consumers 
shop and where they’re most likely to look for your specific product offering.
Evaluating your options: 
Distribution channels
Most businesses find that by selecting multiple distribution channels they 
can make more sales and attract more consumers than when they select only 
one. Having multiple distribution channels allows you the opportunity to 
gauge what channels work best for your specific product. Here’s a rundown 
of the different channels you can choose from:
 
✓ Retail: Using retail stores that sell to the final consumer. This is a direct 
channel because you’re in touch directly with the consumer.
 
✓ Wholesale: Working with wholesale dealers that act as the go-between 
for you and retail stores. This would be considered an indirect channel, 
because you aren’t in direct contact with your consumer; you’re more 
than likely selling to the middleman.

67
 Chapter 3: Applying Consumer Behavior to Marketing Strategy
 
✓ Direct mail: Selling directly to consumers through catalog merchants 
at retail prices (plus shipping). This would be considered a direct sales 
channel, because you’re reaching out directly to the consumer with no 
go-between.
 
✓ Telemarketing: Selling directly to consumers via the telephone. This can 
be considered either direct or indirect marketing, depending on whether 
you did the telemarketing within your company or you outsourced it to 
another company.
 
✓ Internet marketing: Selling directly to consumers at retail prices or 
wholesales prices (plus shipping) via the Internet. This channel can be 
considered direct, indirect, or multilevel marketing, depending on what 
sources you use to sell your products online.
 
✓ Outside sales force: Using salaried employees or independent commis-
sion contractors who sell your products to either the consumer or to 
wholesale dealers. This can be considered a direct channel or an indi-
rect channel, depending on whether your sales force was employed by 
you or outsourced to contractors.
 
Distribution channels can have significant implications on the following:
 
✓ Product margins and profits: The channel you use to sell your products 
will determine the amount of profit you make. If you choose an indirect 
sales method, you have to pay the middleman for selling your product.
 
✓ Your marketing budget: Outsourcing sales often can save on your mar-
keting budget, because the middleman does the product marketing for 
you in order to meet their own sales goals.
 
✓ Final retail pricing: Direct and indirect sales channels will determine 
your final product pricing differently. If you use indirect sales chan-
nels, they’re allowed to price the product at the price they choose. 
Otherwise, you may need to increase the price in order to cover their 
commission or fee.
 
✓ Your sales management practices: The control you have over your 
sales management practices is solely dependent on whether you out-
source or sell directly. When outsourcing, you’ll often use some percent-
age of that control.
Observing how consumer behavior 
affects your placement strategy
To determine your placement objectives, you need to get a handle on your 
placement strategy. By answering the following questions, you can identify 
the objectives in your strategy and determine the best methods to use to ful-
fill your placement goals:

68
Part I: Introduction to Consumer Behavior 
 
✓ What are the characteristics of your target market and how large is 
your market for this product? If you carry a high-priced item that typi-
cally has a small number of buyers, you may want to focus on the direct 
sales approach, which provides plenty of customer service. If you’re 
selling a lower-priced item that appeals to a large market, such as paper 
clips, you could apply an indirect distribution approach by using adver-
tising and placement in retail stores so customers could easily find that 
item.
 
✓ Where are your customers located? Location is important when it 
comes to placement. If you have a large number of customers in your 
local area, you could sell through local retail outlets. If your customers 
are located in multiple geographic locations, you may want to consider 
distribution through agents, wholesalers, or Internet methods.
 
✓ How large are the orders? You can use the size of your average order 
to segment your customers according to their order size. You could 
sell directly to customers purchasing large orders and use an indirect 
method for smaller orders.
 
You should choose more than one distribution channel in order to evaluate the 
one that works best for your company and the distribution of your product.

Part II
Delving Into the 
Psychology of 
the Individual 
Consumer

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I explain why it’s important to understand 
the psychology of your consumers and show how to 
gain an in-depth grasp of the internal workings that make 
consumers think and act the way they do. For instance, I 
look at the motivation of consumers and how it relates to 
the consumers’ desires to achieve certain outcomes. I dis-
cuss the emotions that consumers go through and how 
they work with motivation to move toward a purchase.
I also evaluate the perception process and the interpreta-
tions of consumers. I help you find out how you’re per-
ceived by your consumer, how you can make use of those 
perceptions, and how to reshape them if necessary. As if 
that weren’t enough, I also explain how to use consumer 
attitudes to predict and change intentions.
Consumers are affected internally not only by emotion 
but also by their self-concepts. Self-concept often trans-
lates into a person’s lifestyle, or the way that he lives his 
life, which he creates by spending (or not spending) 
money. So I delve into this topic as well.
You’ll walk away from this part of the book with a solid 
feel for how the internal psychology of individuals 
impacts them as consumers. Having a better understand-
ing helps you communicate with consumers and move 
them toward a purchase.

Chapter 4
Recognizing Need and Desire: 
Motivation and Emotion
In This Chapter
▶ Uncovering the motivations behind consumer action
▶ Tapping into your customers’ emotions
▶ Using marketing to appeal to consumers’ emotions and motivations
W
hen you understand how specific situations influence certain motives 
and emotions in your consumers, you enter the sales situation with 
the upper hand. Motivation and emotion are energizing forces within the 
consumer that invoke certain behaviors and can make those behaviors pur-
poseful and directed. Understanding the desire components of consumer 
behavior can help you in product positioning, sales, and advertising.
When you understand motivation and emotions, it’s easier to speak directly 
to consumers in a way that moves them to action. This chapter draws you 
into the depths of consumer psychology, helping you understand why con-
sumers make purchases in the first place as well as what prompts them to do 
so. Throughout the chapter, I also help you to identify with your customers 
on an emotional level and appeal to the emotions that spark motivation and 
spawn action. The following chapters show you how to get your customers 
to act by purchasing your product or service; this chapter helps you awaken 
their needs or desires.
What Moves Consumers to Action: 
Factors of Motivation
Motivation is the persistent need that stirs up and energizes long-term goals 
within a consumer, and it plays a serious role in consumer behavior. In order 
to understand the motivation of your consumers, you must understand what 
it is that motivates them in general. That task can seem complex, so my goal 
in this section is to simplify it for you.

72
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Exploring the major motivators
Motivation can be hunger, sex, curiosity, security, power, and so on, and it 
begins with the presence of a stimulus that triggers the recognition of a need. 
Motivators for consumption include status, social acceptance, security, or 
individuality. These and other motivations are subconscious and can be trig-
gered or reinforced by your marketing message.
 
When thinking about what motivates your customer, consider the five main 
motivators that consumers experience and react to:
 
✓ Basic needs: Basic needs are easy motivators to understand because 
they’re the things that everybody needs to survive; examples are food, 
shelter, and water. Consumers don’t want to pay extra for basic needs. If 
your customer is motivated by a basic need, price will be a major factor 
in the purchase.
 
✓ Convenience: As a motivator, convenience is all about saving time, 
effort, and money. For example, someone looking for a housekeeper 
may be motivated by convenience, because the act of hiring a house-
keeper indicates that the person is interested in saving time and easing 
day-to-day life. Paying for convenience is common in today’s society. 
Convenience provides people with the opportunity to spend less time 
on the things they dislike doing and to spend time, money, and effort on 
the things they enjoy.
 
✓ Security/safety: This powerful motivator is about peace of mind; it’s 
triggered by fear of the unknown and the uncontrollable things in life. 
Everyone’s looking to feel safe and secure. This motivator is what drives 
consumers to purchase insurance, fire sprinklers, smoke detectors, or 
security alarms.
 
✓ Self-image/ego: Although no one likes to admit it, everyone has an ego. 
People love to look good, feel good, and be envied by others. This moti-
vator is strongly driven by emotions, and purchase decisions triggered 
by this motivator aren’t logical decisions — they’re based on emotion. 
The self-image motivator always brings with it a feeling; it makes the 
consumer look good, which in return makes him or her feel good. For 
example, you may purchase a car that you know will gain the attention 
of other drivers, or you may purchase a house in a specific neighbor-
hood because it shows that you’re doing well for yourself. This motiva-
tor can be very strong.
 
✓ Fun: Ahhhh . . . fun! What more is there to say? The multimillion dollar 
entertainment industry should be proof enough that fun can be a strong 
motivator. Fun is about leisure, relaxation, and enjoyment. This motivator 
pushes someone to buy the pool table, the big-screen television, and that 
Jacuzzi for the deck out back. These purchases contain no real practical 
purpose, but they’re a source of guaranteed fun and enjoyment.

73
 Chapter 4: Recognizing Need and Desire: Motivation and Emotion
 
Motivation affects both the level of importance the product has to the con-
sumer as well as how much interest the consumer has in the product. Having 
this understanding enables you to focus more on the desired emotional state 
that the consumer is trying to achieve.
In addition to the various types of motivators, motivation can be either posi-
tive or negative. Here are examples of each type:
 
✓ Positive motivation: This type of motivation leads to the purchase of a 
sports car. The consumer is motivated by the ride and the way it makes 
him look and feel.
 
✓ Negative motivation: This type of motivation leads to the purchase of 
life insurance. The consumer is motivated to purchase because he’s 
worried and uncertain about how a family member would handle the 
expense of a funeral and burial if he were to pass away. The consumer 
purchases this insurance to help handle his affairs after his death. This 
isn’t a pleasant motivation; it’s actually rather unpleasant, which is why 
it’s considered a negative motivation.
Motivation consists of drives, urges, wishes, or desires that initiate an 
uncomfortable tension within the consumer that remains until that need 
is satisfied. The motivation drives them continually through the consumer 
buying process, so your goal as a marketer is to identify and awaken your 
customers’ underlying motivation; after you do that, you can implement 
other facets of marketing strategy to promote your product or service.
An example of marketing-driven 
motivation in action
Consider the following example from Hair-For-Hunks, which clarifies the 
effect your marketing messages can have on consumers.
Hair-For-Hunks is a fictitious hair replacement manufacturer that boasts the 
highest sales in its industry. Entering the marketplace with a bang, the com-
pany’s newest product, Coverage, is a hair product that targets men in their 
mid- to late-40s who are experiencing hair loss. In marketing its product, 
Hair-For-Hunks accepts the significance of consumer motivation and uses 
popular motivation theories of a respected psychologist when creating its 
marketing campaigns. The company used a combination of both unconscious 
and functional marketing tactics to motivate men to buy Coverage.
Hair-For-Hunks acknowledges that men in the target segment want to be 
viewed as athletic and attractive; they struggle with the fact that they’re 
losing their hair at such an early age. In light of this information, the com-
pany decides not to use a traditional male model in advertisements, instead 
opting to make the potential customer the model and capture his response to 

74
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
the product. Hair-For-Hunks puts the potential consumer in the starring role 
as the attention getter, not some 20-something model with a full head of hair. 
This advertising allows men who are potential consumers of Coverage to 
experience what using the product may be like from a purely egotistical point 
of view. While starring in the advertisement, these men experience glances 
from attractive women in their 20s to mid-30s and even enjoyed smiles and 
envious looks from other men.
Hair-For-Hunks is able to create the illusion that the unconscious desire of its 
target segment — a full head of hair and attention from others — is fulfilled 
by using the new Coverage product. The company realizes that its customer 
base has an unspoken fear of becoming old and bald, and Coverage promises 
to conquer that fear and rid them of the uncomfortable tension. Pledging to 
turn back the clock and create the illusion of youth and a full head of hair 
attracts the attention of other consumers. Hair-For-Hunks has developed a 
marketing concept that motivates its customers to not only purchase the 
Coverage product but also to become loyal customers.
In essence, the consumers who purchase Coverage aren’t really purchasing 
the hair product but rather the concept of youth and masculinity produced 
by the product marketing campaign. By not using a traditional model, the 
potential consumer becomes the model and therefore the face of the product.
 
Motivation isn’t the only factor at work in this example, though. As you see in 
this chapter, human needs motivate consumers to buy, and as a marketer, you 
can bring out specific emotions to sell your products and services.
Energizing Motivation: 
The Role of Emotion
Emotions influence every decision your consumers make. They shape memo-
ries and influence perceptions, dreams, thoughts, and judgments. Emotion 
drives motivation and triggers the motivation to do something in response to 
a feeling. Emotions include the gain of power, loss of power, anticipated gain, 
and anticipated loss. Emotions aren’t easy to define, and they don’t operate 
alone.
 
Think of emotions as first impressions: They’re important because they influ-
ence a response and behavior. In truth, a consumer’s emotions may determine 
whether any action follows at all.
Emotions move consumers to purchase, revisit a place of business, and 
decide whether the price for a product or service is worth it. The bottom 
line is that specific emotions trigger a consumer to purchase. And emotional 
experiences with products and services can often lead to building consumer 

75
 Chapter 4: Recognizing Need and Desire: Motivation and Emotion
loyalty. So emotions are important in understanding why consumers buy 
what they do. Engaging your customer in your advertising and marketing and 
gaining a favorable emotional response is the beginning of the motivational 
process.
Understanding how emotions 
affect purchasing behavior
Consumers purchase products and services to experience certain emotional 
states or to achieve emotional goals in a process called emotional arousal. 
Emotions can create a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction, but they also can 
give the consumer the perception that their purchase will help them avoid a 
feeling of displeasure or pain. Emotions are the commonality behind decision 
making.
No matter what the purchase is, consumers must somehow associate a posi-
tive emotional connection between your product and themselves. Positive 
emotions can include the fulfillment of a desire, the support of values, or the 
feelings of safety and protection. Can you identify which role your product 
fits into?
Similar to motivations, consumers can have both positive and negative 
emotions that affect their purchasing decisions. They also have both nonex-
pressed (insecurity and depression) and expressed emotions (excitement, 
joy, and happiness). It’s important to understand the difference between 
expressed and nonexpressed emotions because if a consumer is purchasing 
but isn’t expressing any emotions toward the product, you may be required 
to ask more questions in order to understand the end state she’s trying to 
achieve.
 
Consumers can struggle with conflicts in the decision-making process, 
because oftentimes they’re trying to rationalize their emotions. You often 
see this as double talk from consumers. They’ll express one thing and a few 
minutes later express something contradictory to their initial statement. This 
double talk is caused by a conflict when choosing between a product that’s 
rational and a product that’s pleasurable.
For example, say that a successful businesswoman walks into a car dealer-
ship. She explains that she wants a car that gets attention and goes fast. She 
selects the car that she wants. It’s a flashy sports car that seats two. The 
longer she sits in the dealership, the more she tries to rationalize the pur-
chase. She’s feeling unsure; even though her purchase is pleasurable, she 
wonders whether it’s rational. The double talk begins. How does the sales-
person handle this? In order to complete the sale, it’s his job to remind her of 
what she asked for when she came in and the reasoning she gave him for the 
car she was looking for.

76
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
In the following list, I show you the emotional cycle associated with con-
sumption, and to illustrate my points, I use examples that go back to the ear-
lier Hair-for-Hunks scenario:
 
1. Dissatisfaction: The consumer feels a need that isn’t satisfied.
 
 For example, Joey, a 36-year-old, is unhappy that he has experienced 
hair loss at such an early age.
 
2. Discomfort and tension: The need causes the consumer to feel tension 
that makes him uncomfortable.
 
 Joey wants to be viewed as athletic and attractive, but he doesn’t feel 
that way because of his hair loss.
 
3. Drive to satisfy the uncomfortable tension: The consumer is driven to 
satisfy the tension making him feel uncomfortable.
 
 Joey begins looking for a solution for his hair loss in hopes that he may 
be viewed as athletic and attractive.
 
4. Satisfaction and reduction of tension: The consumer satisfies his need 
by making a purchase.
 
 Joey discovers Hair-For-Hunks and purchases the company’s Coverage 
product.
 
5. Reduction of tension: With the need satisfied, the consumer’s tension 
dissipates and he once again feels comfortable.
 
 Joey uses the Coverage product and once again feels confident that he’s 
reflecting a younger, athletic, and more attractive appearance.
Linking marketing efforts  
to consumers’ emotions
As a marketer, you can use knowledge of motivation and emotions to move 
beyond basic advertising into the realm of the unconscious and conscious 
desires, fears, and needs in order to successfully market your products and 
services to consumers. It’s simply not enough to promote your products as 
just filling a functional need; you must touch customers on a deeper level. 
Doing so helps the consumer feel that she’s somehow linked to your product 
and that it produces the favorable image of her and who she wants to be. 
This reaction evokes consumer identification with your product and moti-
vates her to buy — and keep buying — your product.
 
You can use marketing activities as a way to stimulate emotions and satisfy 
motivation. If you accept that emotions influence consumers’ desires, motiva-
tions, and behaviors, it makes sense to consider the role of emotions in your 
marketing and advertising. After all, the purpose of most advertising and mar-
keting is to persuade, motivate, and sell. Creating the appropriate emotions 

77
 Chapter 4: Recognizing Need and Desire: Motivation and Emotion
in advertising increases the chances that the advertising will have a positive 
effect on persuading consumers to purchase your product. By creating mar-
keting materials and advertisements that trigger or reinforce the emotions 
your consumers are feeling, you see an increased number of consumers inter-
ested in buying your product. Figure 4-1 shows a flowchart of the emotional 
and motivational factors leading up to a purchase.

Need Is Identiﬁed
Consumer becomes consciously aware of
what that need is
Consumer Feels Motivated
Consumer is motivated to fulﬁll the need in
order to rid herself of the discomfort the
emotion has brought on
Purchase Is Made
As I mention earlier in this chapter, emotion jump-starts a consumer’s moti-
vation to purchase, but how can you use that information in your own mar-
keting strategy? You can use emotion in two ways:
 
✓ You can use emotional arousal as a benefit of your product. For exam-
ple, does your product enhance a consumer’s life by giving her more 
energy, more joy, or overall happiness? If so, use that as a benefit in 
your product positioning, sales presentations, and advertising.
 
✓ You can also use the reduction of an emotion as a benefit. For exam-
ple, does your product relieve stress, save time, or reduce anxiety? If so, 
you can use that relief as a benefit.
The idea is to look at the emotional benefits that your product carries for 
consumers so that when marketing you can use those benefits to trigger the 
motivation for them to buy your product.

Consider the Hair-for-Hunks example from earlier in the chapter. In this 
example, the men that Hair-For-Hunks was targeting felt unattractive and less 
youthful looking than they once did when they had full heads of hair. In order 
to awaken consumers’ motivations, the marketers in this example appealed 
to the negative emotions that the men were feeling. Then the company 
bundled its emotional benefits in its marketing message in order to entice the 
men to purchase the Coverage product.
A real-life example of how consumer motivation and emotions can produce 
action is the bottled water industry. This industry has become extremely 
profitable over the past ten years, but when bottled water was first pro-
duced, consumers laughed at the concept. Why would they want to buy 
water in a bottle when they could drink it from the kitchen tap? That’s when 
the marketing message changed: People weren’t buying bottled water for 
convenience but rather for their health. By drinking bottled water, they felt 
they were protecting themselves from the impurities of tap water. A wariness 
of drinking tap water developed during this time. Impurities? What would 
they do to people? Could they be harmful? Now people are sold on the idea 
of bottled water.
Here’s the breakdown of this bottled water example in terms of motivations 
and emotions:
 
✓ The motivators were personal safety and security of one’s health.
 
✓ The emotion of fear moved consumers into action. They began to drink 
bottled water that they had to pay for in order to avoid drinking tap 
water.
The marketing message changed consumer behavior by touching consum-
ers and making the issue personal. In return, consumers wanted to feel safe, 
so they opened their wallets and spent (and continue to spend) money on 
bottled water.
Evoking Emotion and Spurring 
Motivation through Marketing
When consumers are motivated by an emotion, they’re looking to either 
satisfy an emotion or get rid of it, so you have to figure out how to influence 
their response. To spur the emotions that trigger consumers’ motivations 
to purchase your product, make sure they see the emotional benefits of the 
purchase. You can then use that information in your marketing strategy and 
speak directly to the emotions of your consumers.

79
 Chapter 4: Recognizing Need and Desire: Motivation and Emotion
Identifying your customers’ 
underlying motivations
The best way to use emotion in your marketing strategy is to start out by 
looking at the major motivators that consumers experience and then deter-
mine which motivators your products address. Do you add convenience to 
their lives? Do you provide them with a basic need? Do you provide them 
with fun? What about providing them with peace of mind or security? Keep in 
mind that it’s possible to fit into more than one of the motivator categories.
After you identify what motivators your products address, you can use this 
information as you draft your marketing messages and advertisements. Your 
objective is to use the motivators that you’ve identified to speak directly to 
consumers. The emotional benefits that you offer to your consumers should 
be in your marketing and advertising message, and they also must be used to 
enhance the positioning of your product. (Refer to Chapter 16 for more infor-
mation on positioning.)
 
It’s important to take time to evaluate your consumers and determine what 
motivates them to buy from you. How do you know what they’re motivated 
by? Evaluate the problem that your product solves. If you sell security sys-
tems, for example, your product offers security. By taking the time to identify 
the motivators that your consumers experience and by speaking directly 
to them and providing a way to get rid of any uncomfortable tension, your 
consumers will quickly see that you offer them a satisfying solution that puts 
them back into the comfortable zone they desire.
Motivating action by tapping into emotions
Think back to the last election — national or local. It’s quite clear that politi-
cal marketers have mastered the art of tapping into emotions to sway voters. 
Believe it or not, you can apply the same principles to tap into the emotions 
of your customers to sway their purchase decisions. I show you how in the 
following sections.
Identifying which emotions to stimulate
The key to tapping into the emotions of your consumers is to help them feel 
what your product or service offers. What emotion does it serve — happi-
ness, fear, humor, warmth, or maybe even the resolution of anger? Get in 
touch with the emotions that consumers feel when they come looking for 
your product.
If your company sells security systems, for example, you know that your 
consumers are fearful that someone may try to break into their homes. 
They’re looking for a product that offers peace of mind and security. Fear is 

80
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
the emotion that triggers the motivation to purchase the security system, so 
that’s the one you want to address.
 
Fear can move a consumer to purchase for the feeling of security and peace of 
mind, but if you abuse this emotion, you risk running yourself out of business. 
You can use fear as a selling point, but you have to be careful to do so ethi-
cally. If your product or service can rid consumers of a fear, move forward. 
Educate them of the consequences if they don’t purchase your product. For 
example, if they don’t purchase your security system, you can tell them that 
they run the risk of having their homes broken into and of not feeling safe 
because they’re unprotected. Otherwise, don’t try to fake it; consumers will 
see through your ploy and head for your competitor.
Stimulating the intended emotion with marketing tactics
In order to be successful, your marketing tactics must stimulate an emotional 
need for your product or service. How do you do this? Use the following 
three methods for tapping into the emotions of your consumer:
 
✓ Get personal. Share personal stories of customers or people in your 
company. No fictional brochure or advertisement can create real-life 
excitement; you can only gain real consumer excitement and stimulate 
emotional buying by sharing personal stories. By getting personal, you 
create credibility for your product or service and give customers some-
thing to relate to. Refer to Chapter 5 to find out more on influencing a 
consumer’s perception.
 
✓ Bust out those benefits. Customers want to know what their purchases 
will do for them. Stop being wordy in your marketing message and give 
it to them straight. Point directly to the benefits of the product or ser-
vice; features are meaningless to your consumer unless they’re benefits. 
If you’re having trouble identifying your benefits, fill in the blanks: “What 
that means to you is _______________?” See Chapter 16 for more informa-
tion about educating consumers about your product.
 
✓ Prove it. In order to create emotions of excitement and trust, you must 
prove the benefits of your product. You can do so by using testimonials, 
providing demonstrations, or offering free trials and samples. At this 
point, you’re no longer actively selling your product or service because 
your customers are already willing to buy! Refer to Chapter 3 to find 
more about applying consumer behavior to your marketing strategy.
Suppose a family purchases a new home and has the desire to make sure that 
it’s protected and safe in that new home. The family has had an emotion of 
fear since moving into the new area, so it’s motivated to purchase a security 
system for protection. A company that sells security systems knows that 
the motivators behind their consumers are peace of mind and safety. These 
motivators enable the company to create marketing messages and advertise-
ments specially geared to this family.

81
 Chapter 4: Recognizing Need and Desire: Motivation and Emotion
As the family began to shop around for information regarding the different 
alarm systems available, many of the advertisements and marketing mes-
sages contained technical jargon that the family didn’t understand. However, 
when browsing the newspaper ads one morning, the family came across the 
security company I just mentioned. The advertisement spoke to the family 
and the fear that was motivating it to purchase. The family related to the 
company and felt understood, so one of the members made the call. The 
security company was able to provide the family with a solution to satisfy its 
need and provide peace of mind.
The company that used the high-tech words and technical jargon didn’t 
touch the family personally and didn’t relate to what was motivating it to pur-
chase, so that company lost out on a sale and the pleasure of bringing peace 
of mind to a new customer.
Recognizing and reconciling 
internal conflicts
 
When a consumer decides to make a purchase decision, she may have more 
than one source of motivation and be faced with a conflict. Consumers often 
find themselves in situations where different motives, both positive and nega-
tive, conflict with one another, and they must deal with the internal conflict. 
This section discusses each of the three types of motivation conflicts and tells 
you how you can recognize and help to reconcile them in your customers.
When the customer equally desires two options
In the approach-approach conflict, the consumer is struggling with two desir-
able alternatives. This conflict generates the least amount of anxiety of the 
three types of customer conflicts. Although the consumer must make a deci-
sion, each option is equally desirable and has attractive options.
For example, say a man is at an auto dealership and has decided that he likes 
two cars, but he only has enough money to buy one of them. Ultimately, the 
man will walk away from the dealership happy, but his initial need to choose 
creates an internal conflict and some anxiety about making the choice. 
Obviously, a consumer caught in an approach-approach conflict eventually 
will choose the most desirable option.
 
You can help your customers deal with the approach-approach conflict by 
informing them of the benefits and features of each product option and how 
they compare to each other. If a competitor offers the alternative option to 
your product or service, it’s important to offer a thorough comparison of pur-
chasing from you versus purchasing from your competitor. Emphasize prod-
uct features and benefits. If your item is identical to your competitor’s, focus 
on the strengths of your company; if the item is different, focus on the item 
you offer and how it compares to your competitor’s alternative.

82
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
The consumer’s path to the final decision involves thinking and rethinking 
the benefits of each option. As the consumer analyzes each option, the desire 
for one over the others becomes stronger. The closer the consumer gets to 
that one option, the stronger the drive becomes for that particular option. 
In other words, the benefits of that specific product become more desirable, 
leaving the other option less desirable.
Here’s an example to illustrate what I mean: Suppose a man walks into an 
auto dealership looking to purchase a minivan for his family. Two used mini-
vans are available. One has all the options, but the price tag is higher. The 
other is less expensive, but lacks many of the options that the first van does. 
The man debates with his family because either vehicle would work. After 
debating with one another and visiting with the salesperson, the man and his 
family decided that the more expensive option is the better choice. The less 
expensive minivan no longer captures their interest.
Even though the approach-approach conflict generates a minimal level of 
anxiety, the outcome is always positive. This is the easiest conflict to recog-
nize and resolve. After all, the consumer gets to choose between two good  
options. It’s just a matter of which one they think and feel is best for them.
When the customer feels a positive and 
negative response simultaneously
In the approach-avoidance conflict, the consumer is both attracted and 
repelled at the same time because the desired product may carry with it neg-
ative consequences. For instance, the consumer may experience guilt when 
buying a high-status or pleasurable product or service.
As an example, suppose that in order to purchase a sports car, a consumer 
must pay a large down payment in order to keep her monthly payments man-
ageable. She feels some resistance to purchasing the car unless the stress of 
the purchase is lessened.
How can you resolve this conflict through marketing and advertising? Focus 
on the pleasure of the purchase, namely the features of the selected car and 
the importance of those features to the consumer. If that doesn’t work, offer 
a model with fewer options (and therefore a lower price), or get creative in 
financing the purchase.
 
Your objective when faced with an approach-avoidance conflict is to draw 
attention to the pleasure of the product and take the attention away from the 
stress that’s halting the purchase by offering options that alleviate or lighten 
the consequences that are holding back the consumer.

83
 Chapter 4: Recognizing Need and Desire: Motivation and Emotion
When the customer faces two undesirable options
In the avoidance-avoidance conflict, the consumer is faced with two undesir-
able alternatives. Neither choice is pleasing, but he must select one. The 
options in this scenario don’t matter; what’s important is the fact that the 
consumer wasn’t looking to purchase a product. Instead he finds himself in 
the situation that it’s necessary to purchase, not pleasurable.
For example, say a consumer needs to repair a 20-year-old refrigerator or 
buy a new one. Both choices are undesirable because both involve spending 
a large sum of money. Consumers facing this type of conflict generally do an 
in-depth search for information and seek out ways to possibly avoid at least 
one option. How can you assist in resolving this conflict? Point out how pur-
chasing your product or service may save the customer money, or offer up 
payment option plans that can ease the burden of spending a large amount of 
money at one time.
 
The quicker you can ease the conflict, the easier it is to move the customer 
past the conflict and into the purchase. Your objective when your customer is 
in an avoidance-avoidance conflict is to turn a negative alternative into a posi-
tive one.

Supplying Information and 
Influencing Perception
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the value of perception and how it works
▶ Knowing how consumers form perceptions
▶ Influencing consumers’ perceptions so they do what you want
C
onsumers are faced with a wide variety of stimuli every day. They ana-
lyze and interpret each stimulus with their built-in screening systems. 
These systems help consumers select and recognize what information is rel-
evant to them and ignore what isn’t. Ultimately, this recognition leads to their 
purchasing decisions.
In this chapter, I explain what perception is and how a person’s perception 
forms. I also explain how perception influences purchasing behavior and how 
you can influence consumers’ perceptions of your products or services with 
your marketing efforts.
In the Eye of the Beholder: A Primer 
on Perception and Consumers
Ever wonder why people buy certain products? It’s all about perception. 
Perception is how consumers understand the world around them based on 
information received through their senses. In response to the stimuli, con-
sumers subconsciously evaluate their needs, values, and expectations, and 
then they use that evaluation to select, organize, and interpret the stimuli. 
This process of receiving and interpreting information is an internal one.

86
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
For example, suppose you’re throwing a dinner party and have two unlabeled 
bottles of wine available to your guests. One bottle carries a price tag of $75 
per bottle. The other you picked up at $12 per bottle. Your guests love the 
$12 bottle of wine and can’t rave enough about it. All evening you’re collect-
ing compliments for your wine selection. At the next gathering that you hold, 
you offer the same selection of wine to the same guests from the previous 
party, but just for experiment’s sake you left the labels and price tags on the 
wine. You notice through your experiment that the guests are drawn to and 
more impressed by the $75 bottle of wine. Because it tastes better? Nope. 
It’s because subconsciously your guests perceive the $75 bottle of wine as a 
higher quality wine that should taste better than the $12 bottle. That’s how 
the subconscious mind works with consumers.
 
Consumers make decisions based on what they perceive instead of on the 
basis of objective reality, so accounting for consumers’ perceptions of your 
business and product or service is a crucial part of devising your marketing 
strategy. Even though you can’t force a perception on a consumer, you can 
work hard to understand it. You can determine the factors that influence it 
and find out how that perception is processed. By knowing the general per-
ceptions that your consumers may carry, you can tailor your marketing and 
advertising messages specifically to them.
Understanding How Perception Forms
By understanding how consumers construct their perceptions, you can better 
influence consumers to do what you want: buy your product or service.
Perception takes place in three stages:
 
✓ Stage 1 — Selection: The selection stage of perception takes place when 
a person encounters a particular stimulus.
 
✓ Stage 2 — Cognitive organization: In this stage, the consumer organizes 
his thoughts about the stimulus. This is when the consumer shapes his 
response to the stimulus.
 
✓ Stage 3 — Interpretation: This is the stage in which the consumer solidi-
fies his perception and then executes a response. This response can be 
expressed physically or verbally.
Figure 5-1 shows a flowchart of the process and the influences that affect con-
sumers. The following sections expand on these three stages.

Selection: Letting in stimuli
Two categories of stimuli affect a person’s perception: sensory characteristics, 
which involve the senses, and structural characteristics, which are external 
elements.
 
It’s important to realize that consumers don’t select the stimuli that affect 
them. Stimuli response is automatic, because it provides them with an inter-
nal trigger. It acts as the red light or green light and then guides them in their 
response. For example, when I smell vanilla, the scent triggers my subcon-
scious and reminds me of the candles my mother used to light at dinnertime 
when I was a child. I have the green light to anything that smells like vanilla, 
because I like the memory it recalls for me.

88
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Sensory stimuli
Sensory characteristics affect a consumer’s senses. As a marketer, you can 
use your knowledge of the characteristics to stimulate the consumer’s per-
ception. Sensory characteristics include vision, taste, smell, sound, and feel. 
Here’s a rundown of these stimuli:
 
✓ Vision: Vision is the most dominant of the senses, so you’re probably 
more familiar with using it in marketing than with using any of the other 
senses. Vision is known to stimulate physiological changes. You can 
affect the perception of consumers by using color, shape, and size. For 
example:
 
• Warm colors, such as red and orange, increase blood pressure 
and heart rate. Orange is also often used in fast-food restaurants 
to stimulate diners’ appetites.
 
• Cool colors, such as blue and green, decrease blood pressure 
and heart rate. Blues and greens are often used in hospitals for 
their calming effect and to reduce patient anxiety.
 
• Unique size and/or shape: The size and shape of your packaging 
has the ability to attract new consumers to your products. For 
example, consider the last time you walked into a retail store and 
saw a uniquely shaped shampoo bottle. You more than likely were 
intrigued and picked up the bottle to have a second look.
 
✓ Taste: Culture plays a powerful role in perception, especially when 
determining taste. Taste affects the success of food and beverages. For 
example, European food tastes very different from Korean food. The 
two types carry different flavors, different appearances, and different 
textures. The difficulty of taste as a stimulus is that everyone likes some-
thing different, so what may taste good to one consumer may not taste 
good to another.
 
 If you depend on taste to sell consumers on your product, your best 
course of action to ensure success is to conduct taste tests with them. 
You won’t be able to please everyone, but try to provide items that 
appeal to the mass of your target market.
 
✓ Smell: Smell is the most direct of the senses for consumers. No other 
sense evokes memory more than smell. It’s proven that smelling scents 
remembered from childhood can result in moods like those experienced 
in the person’s younger years. Marketers have begun to understand this, 
so some are using smells to build mood effects into products. Marketers 
also know that using certain pleasant scents in a store increases the time 
consumers spend browsing. An example of the impact that smell carries 
is to think of the cinnamon roll shops located in malls or airports. The 
aroma of fresh-baked cinnamon rolls draws consumers in to purchase.
 
 While some smells work to your benefit, others that are too overpower-
ing can repel consumers. Consider the consumers who avoid the fra-
grance section of department stores because of the overpowering odor.

89
 Chapter 5: Supplying Information and Influencing Perception
 
✓ Sound: Sound, in the form of music and speech, can capture consumers’ 
attention quickly. Research has shown a positive connection between 
the use of popular songs in ads and consumers’ ability to recall those 
ads. It’s also proven that consumers react to what they hear in stores. 
Pleasant music results in increased store sales, and unpleasant noise 
results in lower store sales.
 
 In order to use sound to enhance consumers’ perceptions, consider 
your target market and what sounds appeal to them. If your business 
is a book store, classical music may encourage concentration. On the 
other hand, if your business is a clothing store for teenagers, you’ll likely 
want to focus on popular music that appeals to them.
 
✓ Feel: When a consumer can touch and feel a product, she obtains vital 
information that can have a positive or negative effect. Consider a 
pillow, for example. As the consumer touches and feels the pillow, its 
softness may remind her of the way her grandmother’s pillows used to 
feel. This creates a pleasant perception and moves the consumer to pur-
chase the pillow. However, the reverse also can happen. I may touch the 
pillow and be reminded of the itchy sweater my mother use to make me 
wear. This creates a negative perception that results in me not wanting 
to purchase the pillow.
 
You don’t have control over negative perceptions for any of the previous 
stimuli. You just can’t please everyone. What you can do, however, is ask the 
consumers what they don’t like about the product you have shown them, 
and then point them in the direction of different products that will hopefully 
produce a positive perception. In other words, try to find out why the product 
triggers a red light for them. That way you can move them on to something 
that will trigger a green light.
Structural (external) stimuli
Structural characteristics that affect a consumer’s perceptions are external, 
not internal. They deal less with the consumer’s senses, and yet they rely 
on visual elements to gain the consumer’s attention. (A lot of what follows 
relates to advertising; if you’d like more info on using advertising effectively, 
flip to Chapter 3.) Here are the structural stimuli that you might use:
 
✓ Intensity and size: These characteristics often are the first things to 
attract the consumer’s attention. Intensity refers to the number of times 
consumers see your product or advertisement. You can gain consumers’ 
attention by creating an advertisement that’s brighter and larger in size 
than average advertisements. An example would be a full-page newspa-
per ad.
 
 If you have a retail location and want to use intensity and size to your 
benefit in that location, consider the number of places you put your 
product and the sizes of the displays that house your products. If you 
place one display at the entrance of your store and then another one 
where a customer might check out, you have not only increased the 

90
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
number of times your product is seen, but you’ve created the percep-
tion that the product is important enough for you to put it in more than 
one place.
 
✓ Position: Whether a consumer sees an advertisement or product 
depends largely on where it’s positioned. This includes where an ad is 
placed on a newspaper page or where a product sits on the shelf.
 
✓ Contrast: When you employ contrast, you set off one thing against 
another. Consider grabbing a consumer’s attention by placing a black-
and-white advertisement in a colorful publication or creating a commer-
cial that plays softly during a television rock show.
 
 Placing an element where consumers don’t expect to see it attracts 
attention. You don’t always have to be the most colorful or the loudest; 
sometimes the contrast alone attracts more attention than the norm.
 
 In a retail setting, consider the colors you use in the displays that house 
your products. Also use lighting to really enhance and draw attention 
to your product. The objective is to make it stand out from among the 
other products available.
 
✓ Novelty: Most people love novelty, whether the uniqueness is a new 
look, sound, taste, smell, or feel. Your child may choose a particular 
candy because of the novelty packaging; he’s not especially concerned 
with what’s inside. Consumers don’t necessarily buy items because 
they’re the least expensive either — most of the time they aren’t. They 
buy the items because they’re different and stand out.
 
✓ Repetition: Repetition works. Advertisements often are repeated to help 
consumers recall a product and create a strong interest in that prod-
uct. You hope that the desire created by the ad translates into a sale. 
Repetition works extremely well with low-involvement purchases, which 
are purchases that are less involved and carry a lower expenditure and 
less personal risk. Examples of these products are shampoo, toothpaste, 
or laundry detergent.
 
 Because consumers use these products every day and they typically 
don’t cost much, consumers are more willing to take a risk in trying 
them out. When they see an advertisement that interests them or that 
sticks in their minds due to the repetition, they will often take mental 
note so that when they’re standing in the aisle to purchase the product, 
they recall your advertisement and choose to try it.
 
Knowing which stimulus is right for you depends on your target market. 
Market research and testing of the different structural stimuli for your specific 
product allows you to see which one works for your product. You also can 
watch competitors to see what they’re doing and then glean ideas from the 
information.

91
 Chapter 5: Supplying Information and Influencing Perception
Cognitive organization: Processing 
information
When it comes to developing a perception, the consumer must process the 
stimuli to interpret it and conclude the steps of perception development. 
The processing phase is extremely subjective and is based on the following 
things:
 
✓ What the consumer expects to see in light of her previous experience
 
✓ The number of explanations she can envision
 
✓ The motives and interests at the time of perception
 
✓ The clarity of the stimulus itself
In this stage, consumers compare the stimuli to their own beliefs, attitudes, 
and involvement. This is a mental process that’s affected by things such as 
race, color, religion, gender, or other past cultural experiences. In response 
to stimuli, consumers usually perceive things they need or want, and block 
unnecessary, unfavorable, or painful stimuli.
Consumer response to stimuli isn’t a proactive thought-out process. A 
stimulus triggers the beliefs and attitudes that are stored in the memory of 
the consumer. For instance, consider the fact that I like the smell of vanilla. 
I don’t sit down to process why — I just know that I do. I like it because it 
reminds me of dinner with my family when I was a child; vanilla was the scent 
of the candle my mother lit during our meals. Now, obviously, if I take time to 
analyze why I like the scent of vanilla I would remember, but the truth is that 
subconsciously I already remember.
The same is true for stimuli that trigger painful memories. For instance, when 
I walk down the grocery store aisle, the thought of peanut butter makes me 
sick. I know it’s because I choked on a peanut when I was younger, but I don’t 
stand there and ponder why I don’t like peanut butter. I just automatically 
know that I don’t.
The response to stimuli for each consumer is built in. If it isn’t, the opportu-
nity to create a positive experience to the stimuli is available, but the internal 
trigger won’t already be present.
How do you as a marketer handle a stimulus that creates either a positive or 
negative response? You do it by observing consumers and asking questions. 
Why do they like or dislike that smell? What is it that attracted them to that 
specific product? Was it the feeling it gave them when they touched it? Why 
was that consumer turned off by the spice in that entrée?

92
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
 
The truth is that there are some responses you can’t change no matter how 
you modify your marketing. But what you can do is get to know your consum-
ers, ask questions, and help them find what it is they need. Then find what 
product will give them the green light to purchase.
Interpretation: Giving meaning 
to the stimuli
Comprehension is the process in which consumers understand what a message 
is saying. Factors in comprehension of advertising and marketing messages 
include product development, existing expertise in the product area, expecta-
tions consumers already have of what they will learn, and individual differ-
ences across consumers.
The consumer’s interpretation gives meaning to the stimulation that the 
consumer has received. This meaning is based on internal and external fac-
tors. Interpretation then leads to action. After the consumer has received the 
stimuli and organized it, he interprets the information by using the following:
 
✓ Physical appearances: Consumers draw conclusions based on physical 
appearances. For example, when consumers see people they know, 
those who resemble them, or those whom they’d like to imitate, they 
recall the positive attributes of these people and make a positive 
interpretation.
 
 This is why attractive models are more persuasive for luxury products 
(think jewelry, expensive cars, high-end clothing). Consumers see these 
beautiful people and think that they’ll be beautiful too if they own that 
ring, SUV, or tux. But when marketers want to promote common prod-
ucts (cleaning supplies, computers, cellphones, and so on), they turn to 
the everyday man or woman — people “just like me” in the consumer’s 
mind.
 
✓ Stereotypes: Our own ideas, thoughts, and preconceived notions of how 
people should be influence how stimuli are perceived. Take for example 
the face you put with your customer service claim. Is it friendly? Is the 
person smiling? Does he look eager to help?
 
✓ First impressions: A consumer’s first impression determines which stim-
uli is relevant, important, or worthy of acting on. Your customer’s first 
impression is gauged on your eagerness to help him, the clarity in your 
offering, and whether you took the time to listen to his needs.
 
✓ Early information: People usually don’t listen to all the information 
that’s available before making a conclusion. So make sure you put the 
persuasive arguments first in your advertising and marketing message.

 Chapter 5: Supplying Information and Influencing Perception
 
✓ Halo effect: Consumers perceive and evaluate multiple objects based 
on just one factor. An example of this is a brand name or a company’s 
spokesperson of choice. Say a company that makes a popular athletic 
shoe breaks into the antiperspirant/deodorant market. If the consumers’ 
perception of the shoe is positive, they’re likely to have a positive per-
ception of the antiperspirant as well.
Cultivating and Shaping 
Consumer Perception
A common mistake that businesses make is in assuming that perception is 
built on the features and benefits of their product or service. The truth is that 
perception is built on the value that the consumer believes the product or 
service carries.
 
You must create value for your consumers to shape and cultivate their per-
ceptions. You create value by focusing on what your consumers believe is 
essential. Consumer perception depends on
 
✓ The stimuli to which consumers are exposed
 
✓ How that stimuli is presented to the consumer
 
✓ The quality of products and services that you offer
 
✓ Customer service and the support that you provide
 
✓ The deliverability of what you promise
Essentially, all consumers want a compelling return on their investment with 
you. That doesn’t just mean money; it means time too.
Identifying what’s important 
to your customers
Consumers’ perceptions of value are based on their individual sets of crite-
ria. However, consumers typically see value in some common ways, which I 
explain in the following sections.
Recognizing common factors in value assessment
Quality, service and support, and delivery contribute to the consumer’s per-
ception of value. Every point of contact with your customers is a potential 

94
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
moment of truth regarding your company’s value. If your customers experi-
ence a moment that isn’t positive, their perception of your value won’t be 
positive either.
 
When you constitute a good value with customers, I guarantee they’ll tell 
everyone they know. This is how potential customers begin to form a percep-
tion about your product or service, which of course means more business. 
When considering how to shape and cultivate perception, realize that nothing 
is a stronger influence than the endorsement of a satisfied customer.
Here’s how you can ensure that consumers place great value on your service 
or product:
 
✓ Quality of the product or service: Quality is the first and most impor-
tant component of value, and it encompasses quality in service and 
quality in product. Consumers see value when they see quality. As 
a business, do you work to improve your products consistently? 
Consumers judge quality by the improvement a company makes to its 
offerings.
 
 Quality boils down to the moment that your customer experiences a 
positive or a negative impression when interacting with a given product 
or service. You create value by providing quality.
 
✓ Service and support: The service and support that you provide must 
be top-notch in every way that you communicate with your customer. 
In other words, you need to uphold promises, take the time to listen to 
your customer, and stand behind your product. Service and support 
come from everyone that’s employed by your company, from the pro-
duction line to the receptionist that answers the phone. Every element 
within your business that supports the promise to service what you sell 
impacts the value that consumers perceive.
 
 It’s important to ensure that your customers receive exactly what your 
company has committed to deliver. If they don’t, their perception of your 
value will fall. Service and support includes everything from meeting cus-
tomer expectations to accurately filling orders. It’s the extension of your 
commitment to your consumer beyond the quality of your product.
 
 Every person and every department within your company must under-
stand the importance and contribute to the value that your customer 
buys — including service and support. Look for opportunities to delight 
your consumers, not only at the point of sale, but at the point in which a 
problem occurs. If you ignore service and support, you could risk losing 
the customer forever.
 
 Your customers will make it clear when they enjoy doing business with 
you. Not only will they tell you that they’re pleased, but they’ll tell 
everyone they know. People with professional and likeable personalities 
should have direct customer contact; they’re the front line to creating 
the perception of value.

95
 Chapter 5: Supplying Information and Influencing Perception
 
✓ Delivery: When it comes to satisfying consumers or exceeding their 
expectation as it relates to delivery, it depends entirely on the right 
time, right price, right destination, right condition, right quantity, right 
product, and right packaging.
 
 I like to call delivery the last mile of cultivating and shaping the percep-
tion that your consumers hold. Use this last mile to not only improve, 
but also to differentiate yourself from your competitors.
Accounting for individuality
Consumers see what they expect to see, and what they expect to see usually 
depends on their general beliefs and stereotypes. Because different groups of 
people have different beliefs and stereotypes, they tend to perceive stimuli in 
the marketing environment differently.
When crafting your marketing strategy, remember the following facts:
 
✓ Perception is unique to each consumer; no two people view the world 
exactly the same. As a result, you must look at each consumer as an 
individual and realize that not all consumer response will be the same.
 
✓ Perception is not necessarily as the world is in reality, but more often 
it is as we think of the world. Perception is the way a consumer “takes 
in” your message. As a result, individual consumers often behave differ-
ently to the same stimulus presented under the same conditions. Evaluate 
your marketing message, but realize that it may not always have the same 
effect on everyone. Just because a consumer doesn’t respond well to your 
product doesn’t mean that your message doesn’t work. Instead, it could 
just mean that the consumer wasn’t the right one for you.
As a marketer or business owner, you must be aware of this so you can tailor 
your marketing stimuli, such as ads, packaging, and pricing, for each segment 
you’re trying to attract.
You can target a positive perception within a specific group. With most pur-
chasing decisions, consumers usually can come up with one reason why they 
shouldn’t purchase a product or service. This is the misperception you need 
to control.
 
You must identify the single most important decision-making factor that is 
critical in bringing about the desired behavior from your consumers. This 
factor will vary from business to business. Why do consumers pick you? Are 
they most interested in the quality of your products, the service and sup-
port that you provide, or the delivery method you use? When you isolate that 
factor, you can focus on sales, product development, and creating a positive 
influence on the consumers’ perceptions of your product or service.

96
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Gaining attention with the use of stimuli
As a business owner, how do you ensure that the stimuli you’re placing in 
front of consumers aren’t ignored, but rather recognized, interpreted, and 
stored in their memories? Know how to recognize the three concepts of per-
ception, or processes that consumers go through. And depending on the 
process at hand, use specific stimuli to gain consumers’ attention so they can 
complete the purchase. The concepts of perception include the following:
 
✓ Selective exposure: Consumers are more likely to notice stimuli that 
relate to their immediate needs. Consumers in this phase seek out mes-
sages that are pleasant, that they can empathize with, and that reassure 
them of good purchases.
 
✓ Selective distortion: After the consumer has decided to purchase a 
product, he tends to only seek out information that reinforces that deci-
sion. At times this information can distort what’s true.
 
✓ Selective retention: Consumers remember more accurately messages 
that are favorable to their self-image than messages that are unfavor-
able. In other words, consumers tend to remember the good and forget 
the bad.
 
By understanding these concepts of perception, you have a better chance of 
ensuring that your marketing message isn’t ignored by your potential consum-
ers. When you understand which types of perception are associated with each 
stimulus, you can focus on a particular stimulus or combinations of stimuli 
that evoke the most favorable perception in your potential consumers. You 
can use the process that the consumer uses to direct your marketing message 
to them and trigger the stimuli that they need to get the green light for the 
purchase.
For example, if you’re finding that the majority of your consumers are in a 
selective retention process of perception, you want to draft your marketing 
message in a way that’s favorable to their self-image. Think of the cosmetic 
dentist down the street. He knows that his patients are mostly interested in 
teeth whitening, because it enhances their self-image, increases their confi-
dence, and makes them feel beautiful. He creates a marketing message that 
caters to potential patients and places the message in a magazine that’s dis-
tributed to 38- to 45-year-old successful women. Why? He knows they’re look-
ing for ways to enhance their self-image, they know that beauty is important 
to success, and his marketing message will reinforce their values and their 
decision to have their teeth whitened. They’ll then perceive him to be the 
dentist they contact for this service, because he understands them.

97
 Chapter 5: Supplying Information and Influencing Perception
Avoiding sensory overload
The sensory threshold of a consumer represents their sensitivity level to spe-
cific stimuli and how many stimuli they can take before they must respond. 
Consumers are exposed to different types of stimuli every day. The truth 
is, however, that consumers can’t process large quantities of stimuli at one 
time. They have been equipped with the natural ability to limit their sen-
sory processing; because of this limitation, some stimuli never enter the 
conscious awareness of consumers. So, because consumers have multiple 
encounters with stimuli on a daily basis, an individual stimulus must be ade-
quately intense in order for a consumer to perceive it.
 
Understanding sensory thresholds enables you to analyze the stimuli that 
you’re using and determine how they affect customers and the purchase of 
your product. In other words, you have to find out whether you’re reaching 
consumers at the correct sensory threshold.
Identifying the sensory thresholds
Consumers have different levels of sensory threshold, but they generally fit 
into one of the following categories:
 
✓ Absolute threshold: This is the lowest level at which you can experi-
ence a sensation. The point at which a consumer can detect a difference 
between something and nothing is that person’s absolute threshold for 
that stimulus. As exposure to the stimulus increases, you notice it less.
 
 For example, the point at which a driver can see a billboard is her abso-
lute threshold. After an hour of passing billboards on the highway, the 
person develops an internal blindness to the billboards, and it’s doubt-
ful that any of them will make an impression.
 
✓ Differential threshold: The minimal difference that can be detected 
between two stimuli is the differential threshold. A professional wine 
taster demonstrates differential threshold. The wine taster frequently 
perceives a difference between two bottles of wine, yet an amateur may 
find the wine identical.
 
✓ Subliminal threshold: This threshold is only recognized subconsciously 
by the consumer because of the shortness in duration and differences in 
messages. Suppose, for example, a teenager is watching a music video 
during which the word “fast” appears on the television for 5 seconds 
and then disappears; then 20 seconds later an image of a specific energy 
drink appears. Even though the teenager doesn’t consciously remember 
the message, in the subliminal threshold she has stored the word “fast” 
along with the image of the energy drink. The idea is that when she 
enters a store, she will associate “fast” with the energy drink and pur-
chase the drink when she needs a pick-me-up.

98
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
 
 Research suggests that subliminal perception has a limited effect on 
consumers, although evidence does show that the stimuli presented 
at the subliminal threshold can reach your sensory register. However, 
some believe that if the message is exposed to the consumer above the 
subliminal threshold, it should have the same impact. This makes the 
use of subliminal stimuli unnecessary.
 
 This threshold has generated a lot of controversy in the marketing 
industry. Some claim subliminal advertising is an act of marketers brain-
washing consumers, but marketers deny it. Consumers believe they’re 
being marketed to without their permission, which has raised concern 
regarding marketing ethics.
Using thresholds in your favor
The key is to understand the different sensory thresholds in order to use 
them in your favor. When it comes to consumers’ absolute threshold, you 
must create advertisements above this threshold. For example, say you’re 
advertising in an area that houses multiple advertisements or billboards. 
Because of these advertisements, your consumers are experiencing sensory 
overload and are unable to process the advertising messages. You may want 
to choose to advertise in another venue that isn’t so saturated. This way you 
can more easily gain the attention of consumers.
You often use the differential threshold when you don’t want your consum-
ers to sense a change, as when you need to raise your product’s price. In 
order to use the threshold in this way, you must focus on the benefits of the 
product to outweigh the differences. If a consumer is presented with both 
the positive and the negative, he can outweigh the negative perception with 
the positive. For example, suppose you raised the price but your lotion is the 
best on the market. In that case, you might advertise as being rated the #1 
lotion without focusing on the price increase.
At other times, though, you want your consumers to recognize the differ-
ential threshold, perhaps when you increase the size of your product. For 
example, consider the shampoo bottle that reads “25 percent more,” but yet 
remains the same price. In this situation, you want consumers to notice the 
difference, so you focus on both benefits, 25 percent more but for the same 
price.
The subliminal threshold is broken when a person is exposed to two differ-
ent messages, which are only shown for a short time. The messages are so 
short in time that the consumer isn’t consciously aware of them. Here’s an 
example of when you might use the subliminal threshold: You may advertise 
a 30-second spot that talks about the new sandwich that you have just intro-
duced, and then shortly thereafter you play a 30-second spot about being 
hungry. The consumer subconsciously stores both of these messages and 
perceives that he’s hungry and should purchase the new sandwich.

Uncovering Attitudes: General 
and Lasting Evaluations
In This Chapter
▶ Defining consumer attitude
▶ Considering how consumer attitudes are formed
▶ Walking through strategies that help change consumer attitudes
A
ttitudes can tell you a lot about your consumers as long as you’re 
paying attention. The consumer’s attitude is a general evaluation of 
something — it encompasses the consumer’s knowledge of that something, 
her liking or disliking of it, and the strength of her feelings regarding it.
Intent can be looked at as the result of the attitude. It’s the state of mind at 
the time the consumer carries out an action. You must work to change atti-
tude in order to produce change in the intention. Intention is usually one or 
two steps away from the actual purchase.
All the strategies used to change consumer attitudes take the traditional view 
that attitude precedes consumer behavior. So, in the marketing world, we use 
the relationship between attitude and behavior in order to create the change 
of intention if needed.
In this chapter, I give you an overview on attitude. I show you how attitudes 
are formed and how you can gauge the attitude and work to change it if 
necessary.
Nailing Down the Basics 
of Consumer Attitude
The attitude of a consumer refers to what that consumer feels or believes 
about a product or service. An attitude is a learned predisposition to behave 
in a consistently favorable or unfavorable way with respect to an object. In 

100
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
the realm of marketing, attitudes are the enduring feelings, evaluation, and 
tendency consumers have toward your product, service, or company.
Dissecting an attitude: The sum of its parts
An attitude can be defined as a relatively lasting cluster of feelings, beliefs, 
and behavioral tendencies that are directed toward a specific product, 
person, idea, object, or group. The three components of attitude come from 
this definition.
 
By understanding the components of the attitude, you can gain a better under-
standing of the consumer. The three components of attitude are beliefs (what 
a consumer thinks about a product), feelings (how a consumer feels about a 
product), and intentions (how a consumer is likely to act as a result of those 
beliefs and feelings). The following sections discuss these components in 
detail, and Figure 6-1 shows how they influence attitude formation and the 
purchase decision.

 Chapter 6: Uncovering Attitudes: General and Lasting Evaluations
Beliefs
This component is the cognitive component of consumer attitudes. It’s related 
to the general know-how of a person. To really grasp this component, you 
need to understand the difference between a belief and a feeling and how they 
both construct the attitude of the consumer. A belief is an opinion; an attitude 
is a point of view. So, in other words, belief represents the opinion or the 
way someone “thinks,” which helps that person form the point of view that’s 
reflected in his attitude toward a product.
Clear as mud, right? Well, here’s an example to help you along: Consider a 
person who says that smoking is bad for your health. This statement is the 
belief component of his attitude; it’s what he “thinks” about smoking. This 
belief works to create his attitude (or point of view), which states that he 
“doesn’t like” smoking and doesn’t think people should smoke.
Feelings
The feeling component is the emotive component of consumer attitudes, and 
it’s derived from emotions a consumer feels toward a product or service. 
This component of attitude is developed by past emotional association with 
a product and by emotional effect of belief.
Consumer purchases are influenced by feeling. How does your product make 
the consumer feel? How does she feel about the marketing messages you 
send out? The feeling component is comprised not only of the consumer’s 
knowledge of the product, but also of her internal emotional evaluation of the 
product — how she “feels” about the product.
The feeling component is the one that helps consumers reach purchase 
decisions by evaluating the functions of their attitudes. When consumers 
evaluate their feelings toward a product or service, they tend to evaluate 
the adjustment, ego, value, or knowledge function that it provides. (I discuss 
these functions later in the chapter.)
Intentions
This component is the behavior (intentions) component of consumer atti-
tudes. As with the feeling component, the intentions component is some-
times a logical consequence representing action. However, it can sometimes 
reflect other circumstances as well. For example, even though a consumer 
may not like a department store and believes that it isn’t good for the com-
munity, he may go there with a friend and end up purchasing a product.
In other words, intention is the component that creates the readiness to 
respond and the intent to either purchase or not purchase the product or 
service. The intentions component is a much stronger indicator of behavior 
than either beliefs or feelings, because it represents action.

102
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Seeing how attitude affects 
purchase decisions
Market research and behavioral science studies have shown that consumers’ 
attitudes toward a product influence their overall evaluation of whether to 
purchase that product. It also influences whether they relate positively or 
negatively toward that product.
 
Attitudes can help you gauge your acceptance into the marketplace. They tell 
you how well you’re meeting the needs of your consumer and show you how 
the consumer perceives your logo, endorsers, products, or marketing mes-
sages. As predictors of behavior, attitudes create the intentions of consumers.
 
Consumers screen information that conflicts with their attitudes. In their 
minds they change information to make it consistent with their beliefs and 
attitudes. They also selectively remember bits of information that reinforce 
their attitudes (and forget the rest). This is why working to change negative 
attitudes about your products is important; otherwise you’ll never reach the 
buying intention that you’re striving for.
Because attitudes are difficult to define, measure, and observe, you may need 
to do some research to fully understand the attitudes of your consumers. 
(Refer to Chapter 12 for more information on conducting market research.)
The interaction between beliefs and feelings and underlying values can make 
it difficult to understand the role of attitudes and how they affect consumers. 
Because they’re internal, it’s often not easy to gain a visual perspective of 
how the consumer is being affected by beliefs and feelings.
Attitudes have a level of consistency, but they can and do change. Changing 
them, however, isn’t always easy. Find out more in the later section 
“Marketing to Create Positive Attitudes and Influence Negative Ones.”
Understanding How Consumers 
Form Attitudes
Consumer attitudes develop over time from childhood. Consumers are con-
tinually subjected to new knowledge, input, experiences, and influences. The 
formation of an attitude is helped along by direct personal experience and is 
influenced by the ideas, personality, and experiences of friends, family mem-
bers, and the media.
Attitudes can change in response to the following:

103
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Attitudes: General and Lasting Evaluations
 
✓ The introduction of new or improved products by you or your 
competition
 
✓ The addition of new consumer experiences
 
✓ The marketing efforts of your competition
 
✓ The performance of the product after purchase
All these things can affect a consumer’s current attitude and her likelihood 
of attitude change. Attitudes that are relative to purchase behavior are often 
formed as a result of
 
✓ Direct experience with the product
 
✓ Word-of-mouth marketing
 
✓ Exposure to media advertising, the Internet, and direct marketing efforts
In the following sections, I discuss two important components that cause 
consumers to have the attitudes that they have. Attitudes are created by a 
consumer’s own internal power of reasoning, which I refer to in this section 
as internal assessment, but they’re also affected by outside pressures, which 
I refer to as external influences. When you can comprehend the cause of atti-
tude, you can gain a better understanding of the attitudes consumers pos-
sess and why those attitudes may exist. Understanding also enhances your 
chances of changing negative attitudes.
A preview of attitude models
Five categories of attitude models have received 
attention in the study of consumer attitudes:
 ✓ The tricomponent attitude model, which 
focuses on the cognitive (belief), affective 
(feeling), and conative (behavior) compo-
nents of attitude
 ✓ The multiattribute attitude models, which 
include the attitude-toward-object model 
and the attitude-toward-behavior model
 ✓ The trying-to-consume attitude model, which 
focuses on what consumers are trying to 
achieve by purchasing a product or service
 ✓ The attitude-toward-ad model, which focuses 
on how consumers respond to advertise-
ments
 ✓ The theory of reasoned action, which looks 
at both internal and external influencing 
factors that affect purchasing behavior
You can use these models to gain a better 
understanding of the role that attitudes play 
in consumer behavior. The models deal with 
the structure and composition of a developing 
attitude. Throughout this chapter, I cover the 
concepts you need to know; you can use the 
preceding list as a starting point if you’re inter-
ested in doing more research on these com-
monly used models.

104
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Perceiving a customer’s internal assessment
Because attitudes are difficult to measure, it’s useful to understand and 
measure the influence of product-purchase attitudes in terms that relate to 
the way a product functions in supporting the attitude that it causes. After 
becoming familiar with these functions, their roles, and how they affect 
consumers, you can use them to further understand the attitudes of your 
consumers. The four primary functions are adjustment, value, ego, and 
knowledge; I expand on each one in the following sections.
Adjustment function
The adjustment function gives a product the ability to help a consumer achieve 
a desired goal or avoid an undesired goal. An example of the adjustment func-
tion would be a consumer who finds a fantastic pizza shop; he repeatedly 
orders pizza from this restaurant in order to avoid the risk or dissatisfaction of 
another pizza shop.
How can this function work in your favor as a business owner? If you were 
the owner of another pizza shop, you could offer a money-back guarantee if 
the consumer wasn’t satisfied.
Value function
The value function gives a product consistency with the consumer’s cen-
tral values or self-image. After all, value, which is an expressive function of 
attitude, serves as a means of making a concrete expression about certain 
consumer values. An example of this function would include a consumer who 
only chooses to purchase American-made automobiles. This decision would 
be an expression of her value not to purchase foreign-made vehicles. In this 
case, the consumer feels that she’s portraying her values in the vehicle that 
she drives.
 
The value function is the most difficult one to deal with because it relates to 
personal values, and values tend to be something that most consumers hold 
onto as being important to who they are.
Ego function
The ego function gives a product the capability to defend the consumer’s 
self-image against internal or external threats. For example, consider the pur-
chase of designer-label clothing over nondesigner–label clothing. Some con-
sumers believe that their clothing is an extension and an expression of their 
self. The clothing conveys the consumer’s self-image.
 
Attitudes that are caused by the ego function often are used as a protection 
mechanism for consumers. The ego function is a function of internal assess-
ment that you must be careful of, because it’s working to protect consumers 
from feeling inferior. If you work to change the consumer’s attitude, he may do 
the opposite of what you want, which is reinforce his defenses. Instead, when 

105
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Attitudes: General and Lasting Evaluations
you come across the ego function, your course of action must focus on what 
rewards the consumer. You want to avoid a potential backfire that pushes the 
consumer to cling to the attitude rather than change it.
As an example, consider designer clothes again. If you’re a company that 
sells knockoffs, you may find it difficult to counteract the consumer who feels 
that he’s less inferior because of the designer labels he wears. You must find 
a way to reward the consumer, perhaps explaining that you can’t tell the dif-
ference between the two lines of clothing. Or you might remind the consumer 
that because of the decreased price he can purchase more items of clothing, 
which gives him a broader wardrobe without depleting his budget. Whatever 
you do, you must not criticize the consumer for his previous purchases of 
designer labels. Doing so will only make him cling to the previous attitude 
that he must have designer labels in order to not feel inferior.
Knowledge function
The knowledge function gives a product the ability to provide meaning to the 
consumer’s beliefs and experiences. In other words, it recognizes that people 
are driven by the need to gain information to organize and understand their 
environments. It fulfills the need for order, meaning, and structure.
An example of the knowledge function would be the consumer gaining infor-
mation about a new medical procedure through advertisements. Marketers 
often use the knowledge function by applying “need-to-know” strategies in 
their advertisements and marketing materials.
 
You can use the cognitive needs of a consumer to approach this function 
when trying to change an attitude. Provide the consumer with as much knowl-
edge and advice as possible. In this function, the consumer’s desire is to learn. 
She wants to feel like an expert and like she’s making an educated decision.
Accounting for external influences
External influences are the inputs from the outside world that consumers 
use to bring cause to their attitudes. These influences can be friends, family 
members, or peers. Because consumers are interested in what others have 
to say, they listen and use the information they receive as a cause for the 
attitudes they have. External influences have the ability to affect attitudes in 
both negative and positive ways. Following are the three general categories 
of influence on attitudes:
 
✓ Ideas: Ideas can be influenced by friends, family members, peers, and 
the media. For example, a consumer may gain the idea from some exter-
nal influence that in order to give off the impression of success, he must 
wear only tailor-made suits. This influences him to purchase only tailor-
made suits and causes a particular attitude that tailor-made suits con-
note success.

106
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
 
✓ Personality traits: A consumer’s personality traits represent how he 
responds to things around him. It isn’t uncommon for consumers to 
also be influenced by the personality traits of those closest to them. 
For example, suppose that a consumer has surrounded himself with 
people who stay on top of technology. They always purchase the newest 
gadget, and so because of the consumer’s association with this group, 
he also purchases the newest gadgets when they’re introduced.
 
✓ Experiences: The experiences of others affect consumers in their atti-
tudes toward products. For example, if your mother visits a new restau-
rant and tells you that the food was horrible, the chances of you visiting 
that restaurant are slim. However, if she purchases a product and can’t 
say enough good things about it, the chances of you purchasing that 
product are much higher.
You could almost look at external influences as being equivalent to peer pres-
sure. Consumers don’t always agree with those around them, but they do 
often listen to them to gain their point of view. In fact, after a span of time, 
they begin to understand or even accept those attitudes as correct, espe-
cially in specific situations.
 
However, do remember that the effect of attitudes on the behavior of con-
sumers depends on the situation in which the behavior occurs. A specific 
situation may cause consumers to behave in ways that aren’t consistent with 
their own attitudes. Consider the situation in which the behavior takes place; 
otherwise you may misinterpret the relationship between attitude and behav-
ior. (I discuss the consistency of attitudes in more detail in the later section 
“Understanding the roots of attitude inconsistencies.”)
Also keep in mind that the influences of family and friends have major 
impacts on a consumer’s values, beliefs, and attitudes. For this reason, most 
people carry over many of their attitudes from childhood into their adult 
lives. As you can imagine, these long-time attitudes can be difficult to directly 
influence; however, if the attitude is positive, you may be in luck. This source 
can be a great word-of-mouth referral for you. But, if the attitude is negative, 
it can have a detrimental effect on potential or current customers.

Consumers often behave inconsistently when it comes to the components of 
attitude. They are human, after all. Inconsistency happens for several reasons:
 
✓ The lack of ability: A consumer may want a new vehicle, but she may 
not be able to afford it. She lacks the ability to purchase the vehicle.

107
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Attitudes: General and Lasting Evaluations
 
✓ Competing demands for resources: A consumer may want a new vehicle 
and a new house. She can only afford one, so she has to make a decision 
about which item to purchase.
 
✓ Social influence: A consumer may enjoy gambling, but because she’s 
with friends who don’t agree with gambling, she chooses not to gamble. 
This type of influence can come from family, friends, co-workers, and 
any other social acquaintances.
 
✓ Attitude measurement problems: Consumers sometimes have difficulty 
measuring their own attitudes. In many situations, consumers don’t con-
sciously set out to specify how positively or negatively they feel about a 
certain product.
 
 For example, consider a hybrid car. A consumer doesn’t always give reli-
able answers when a market researcher asks her how she feels about 
hybrid cars, how important her beliefs are about the car, and what her 
overall evaluation is of the hybrid car. Consumers may not answer hon-
estly because they’re confused by the question or fear that the research 
may not agree with their point of view. Inaccurate answers often cause 
erroneous measurements, because the consumer may go on to act on 
her true attitudes.
Marketing to Create Positive Attitudes 
and Influence Negative Ones
It’s important to realize that you have the ability to shape and direct the atti-
tudes of prospective consumers. You also can reshape consumers’ attitudes. 
Obviously it’s easier to work to create a positive attitude or to confirm exist-
ing positive attitudes than it is to change an attitude. After an attitude has 
been formed, it’s difficult (but not impossible) to change. It simply takes a 
considerable amount of effort to change what a consumer believes to be true.
 
You can position your product or service by using messages that focus on cer-
tain beliefs and feelings of consumers. What belief do you want the consumer 
to have about your product? How do you want to make the consumer feel? 
These two things must drive the intent.
For example, a grocery store by the name of Food-4-Cheap, which is locally 
owned and interested in positioning itself by using a belief message that trig-
gers both a belief and feeling and drives intent, may run an advertisement that 
says, “Food-4-Cheap. Always Open. Always Less.” The grocery store in this 
example triggers all three components of attitude. The store gave consumers 
the belief that its products are cheap and its hours make shopping convenient. 
These two triggered the intent of the consumer to go to that grocery store.
In the following sections, I show you how you can influence consumers’ 
beliefs and feelings about your offering with your marketing mix.

Inducing positive attitudes
Creating a positive attitude in prospective consumers can be done by using 
your marketing efforts. You can use the following approaches to do so:
 
✓ Create a positive emotional connection. Focus your marketing mes-
sage so that you gain the consumer’s attention. After you have the con-
sumer’s attention, you want your message to create a positive emotional 
connection between him and your product.
 
✓ Create curiosity. Using your marketing message, arouse the curiosity of 
potential consumers. This curiosity will motivate them to contact you. 
When they do, you can help construct their positive attitude by giving 
them top-notch customer service.
 
✓ Consider a two-sided message. Consumers tend to have a natural level 
of skepticism when it comes to marketing messages, so using a two-
sided message often leads to them feeling as if you have more credibil-
ity. For example, consider the marketing of prescription drugs. They’re 
required by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to present 
both the positive effects of the drug as well as the side effects and dan-
gers of using it.
 
✓ Take advantage of comparative marketing. Don’t be afraid to compare 
your products to those of your competitors. Doing so creates credibility 
from the consumers’ point of view and can lead to a positive attitude 
toward your products. Just keep in mind that you must be able to back 
your comparison claims.
 
✓ Use credible sources. You have to focus not only on the message of 
your marketing, but also on where you advertise and put your message. 
Consumers pay attention to the source of the message; in fact, the source 
is often used in the development of their perceptions of a product.
Reshaping negative attitudes
Attitude changes are learned. They’re influenced by personal experiences 
and information gained from various personal and impersonal sources. 
Consumers also are affected by their own personalities. Personality affects 
both the consumers’ acceptance and the speed at which their attitudes can 
be changed.
If a consumer has a negative attitude toward a product, your challenge is to 
identify the key issues that are affecting the consumer’s attitude toward that 
product. Then you can adjust your marketing to make your consumer’s atti-
tude a more positive one. You can only ask people what their attitudes are or 
infer them, because it’s impossible to directly observe them.

109
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Attitudes: General and Lasting Evaluations
 
Even though attitudes can be changed, keep in mind that the task isn’t easy. In 
general, weak attitudes are easier to change than those that are strongly held. 
Consumers tend to develop strong attitudes when it comes to areas that they 
consider to be of great personal importance. Strong attitudes can be either 
negative or positive, however. In areas of limited importance, consumers tend 
to be ambivalent or neutral, so their attitudes are weaker and more vulnerable 
to change. It’s also easier to change attitudes that deal with low-involvement 
purchases (versus high-involvement purchases).
In this section, I help you recognize areas where negative attitudes are likely 
to be strong or weak, and I offer strategies to help you turn those frowns 
upside down, so to speak.
Assessing the strength of the attitude
When a consumer is highly involved in her purchase, she’s committed to the 
brand or the product. In this scenario, it’s often easier to change her beliefs 
about the product than it is to change her attitude. For example, consider 
a consumer who’s in the process of purchasing a car. She knows that a par-
ticular brand of a car shows people that she’s successful and has achieved 
a level of financial status. It would be difficult to persuade her that the spe-
cific brand she’s looking at doesn’t reflect that type of message. However, 
you could change her belief that perhaps the brand of vehicle you’re selling 
makes that same statement. You would do this by providing her with adver-
tising reports or statistics of sales that reflect the wealthy image.
When it comes to low-involvement purchases, such as toothpaste, deodorant, 
or laundry soap, it’s easier to change a consumer’s attitude. Why? Because in 
low-involvement purchases, consumers are less likely to be committed to the 
brand. They’re less self-identified with these products and services than they 
are when it comes to high-involvement purchases. They’re also more likely to 
accept messages that don’t conform to their beliefs.
Selecting your strategies
When you’re faced with stagnant or slipping market share or active competi-
tors, you need to develop strategies that attempt to change or intensify your 
consumers’ attitudes. Attitude change strategies can focus on one of the 
attitude components — beliefs, feelings, intentions — or a combination of 
all three. (Refer to the earlier section “Dissecting an attitude: The sum of its 
parts” for more on these components.)
 
The struggle that consumers face with the belief and feeling components of 
attitude is that they’re learned and sometimes consumers are unaware of 
where they were learned from. Similarly, you as a marketer may not know 
where consumers’ attitudes are generated. Their attitudes may have nothing 
at all to do with your product or service, so be sure to consider the following:

110
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
 
✓ A consumer may hold beliefs or feelings that aren’t accurate. Here’s 
an example of a consumer’s inaccurate belief: “If I let a doctor X-ray me, 
I will get cancer from the radiation.” In a case like this, you want to pro-
vide the individual with more information and show him how you can 
protect him from the radiation.
 
✓ A consumer can have multiple feelings and beliefs. In fact, some may 
even conflict with other beliefs and feelings. For example, a consumer 
might say, “I believe that going to the gym is important, but it takes 
away from my family time after work and that makes me feel guilty.” In 
this case, you want to relate to the consumer’s conflicting attitude. After 
summarizing the conflict, advise him that if he does go to the gym, he 
will lead a healthier lifestyle and live longer and in turn will actually be 
able to spend more time with his family.
 
✓ A consumer may have both positive and negative beliefs and feelings 
about a single product or service. Here’s an example: “I like red wine, 
but it stains my teeth.” When facing this scenario, both beliefs are true, 
so you want to focus on the attributes of your product. This way you get 
him to focus more on the positive rather than the negative.
 
When you face these struggles, you can only work to change consumers’ atti-
tudes. You can choose from any of the following six strategies:
 
✓ Change the basic motivational function. This strategy takes into 
account that attitudes serve four functions: adjustment, value, ego, and 
knowledge (see the earlier section “Perceiving a customer’s internal 
assessment” for more on these functions). By changing the basic motiva-
tional function of your product, the attitude toward your product can be 
changed. For example, you can offer free trials, money-back guarantees, 
and coupon promotions. Market in a way that drives consumers to try 
your product. The end result — with any luck — is that they develop a 
positive attitude toward it.
 
✓ Associate your product with a special group, event, or cause. Attitudes 
can be altered by indicating your product’s relationship to a particular 
group, event, or cause. Concern for the environment is a cause that has 
been used frequently. For example, an environmentally conscious con-
sumer may change his mind about a company when he finds out that it’s 
going green.
 
✓ Relate to conflicting attitudes. Consumers like harmony and shy away 
from conflict. If you can show that their attitudes toward your product are 
in conflict with other attitudes, they may be persuaded to change one of 
the attitudes. (Just hope they change the one that pertains to you!)
 
✓ Alter components in product attributes. You can use this strategy to 
change the evaluation of the features your product offers. You can do so 
by upgrading or downgrading significant features, changing consumer 
beliefs by introducing new information, adding features, or changing the 
overall product rating.

111
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Attitudes: General and Lasting Evaluations
 
✓ Change beliefs about competing brands. You can directly compare 
your product to competing brands in an attempt to change consumer 
beliefs about both products.
 
✓ Provide information at the right times. Consumer attitudes can be 
changed by either central or peripheral routes to persuasion. In other 
words, you need to give the consumer more information when he’s most 
receptive to that information. Sounds complicated doesn’t it? Here’s 
what I mean: In the central route, attitude changes occur because the 
consumer seeks and evaluates additional information about your prod-
uct. Motivation levels are high and the consumer is willing to invest the 
time and effort to gather and evaluate the information.

Defining the Role of Identity: 
Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the impact of identity on consumers
▶ Understanding and marketing to consumer self-concepts
▶ Evaluating lifestyle characteristics that affect consumer behavior
T
he self-concepts and lifestyles of consumers set up their identities. These 
two components show not only how consumers see themselves, but also 
how they portray themselves to others. They also affect consumer behavior 
and consumption patterns. When consumers identify a product as relating to 
their self-concepts and lifestyle, they often form an emotional identification 
with that product. This makes them feel as if the product was created just for 
them.
In this chapter, I explain the many different self-concepts and lifestyles and 
show how you can use your understanding of them to help consumers feel as 
if your product was created just for them.
Understanding the Dynamic Effect of 
Identity (Self-Concepts + Lifestyles)
Self-concept is a consumer’s perception of himself. It’s a collaboration of 
subjective thoughts and perceptions that he holds. In other words, it isn’t an 
objective evaluation. A self-concept is composed of multidimensional charac-
teristics, and it includes not only physical attributes, but psychological ones 
as well. Some attributes that are included are: personality attributes; knowl-
edge of skills, abilities, and talents; and occupation. A consumer’s perception 
is also intertwined with the various roles that he takes on, including family 
roles, personal roles, and professional roles.

114
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
 
Self-concept refers to how consumers see and feel about themselves; it’s the 
image of themselves that they have shaped and created. How does self-concept 
affect consumer behavior? Well, in order to reflect the image they have of them-
selves, consumers buy and use products that support that image.
At times, lifestyle is reflective of self-concepts. Lifestyle refers to the way a 
consumer lives. It represents the external characteristics that pertain to how 
a consumer lives: the activities he engages in, his habits and possessions, 
and the interests he expresses. In other words, lifestyle represents what he 
sees as value in his life. This value is reflected in the way that he spends his 
time and money. Lifestyle is the result of a consumer’s motivations, educa-
tion, attitudes, behaviors, beliefs and opinions, demographic factors, and 
personality. At the same time, lifestyle also represents a consumer’s income 
level, marital status, culture, social class, and buying power. These different 
roles all combine to reflect the consumer’s lifestyle.
Studying how identity affects 
purchasing behavior
Self-concept is an important determinant of consumer behavior, because it 
describes how consumers see themselves and how they think other people see 
them. Consumers define their sense of self at least partially from the products 
and services they consume. They attempt to support their self-concepts by 
using those products that communicate particular personal characteristics to 
themselves and those around them. For example, self-concept is the basis for 
why a consumer wears certain fashions, purchases particular products, and 
drives specific cars.
 
Products and brands are an important part of how an individual defines her-
self. In other words, products and brands help a consumer stay in line with 
the self-concept she has developed. The subjective meaning of a product ties 
in closely with one’s self-concept or image. A consumer will buy products that 
she feels reflect her established image.
Like self-concept, lifestyle determines what products consumers buy, how 
they use them, and how they feel about them. Consumers purchase products 
and services to support their lifestyles.
In essence, a person’s self-concepts influence her attitudes, interests, and 
opinions, which in turn influence her lifestyle; together these factors deter-
mine her identity. Figure 7-1 shows you how the concepts relate to one 
another.

A person’s self-concept can change over a period of time. This change most 
often happens during an identity crisis or traumatic experience. During this 
time an individual will often go through a reassessment and develop a new 
self-concept. When a person’s self-concept changes, her lifestyle may also 
change as a result of both internal and external factors. That’s because a con-
sumer’s lifestyle is reflective of her self-concepts; the corresponding consump-
tion patterns change as well.

116
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Seeing how identity factors into 
successful marketing plans
Advertising and marketing can influence consumers to buy products that 
symbolically represent the self-concept they’re attempting to achieve. When 
your advertisements and marketing messages are passed on to consumers 
by using reinforcement of their self-concepts, consumers are more inclined 
to purchase your products. On the other hand, if consumers feel that your 
advertisement doesn’t fit with their self-concepts, they’re less likely to accept 
the advertisement and purchase your product.
 
If you know the specifics of your consumers’ lifestyles, you can profile their 
patterns of acting and interacting with the world around them. And even 
better is the fact that you can develop marketing strategies targeted to 
common market segments based on similarities in lifestyle. You can then 
use this information to not only get the right message about your product in 
the right places for your intended consumers, but you also can develop your 
products to meet the lifestyle interests of your target markets.
For example, suppose I’m a home builder who’s looking to develop a new 
housing addition in a specific zip code. I decide to do a lifestyle assessment 
of people located in that zip code. The lifestyle assessment shows me that 
the median income is $450,000 annually and that most of the homeowners in 
the area are married and have two kids. The average home purchase price is 
$800,000. Because of this assessment, I now know that if I build my housing 
development in this area, the houses can range from $750,000 to $950,000 
and should sell with no problem. After I’ve selected my area and finalized the 
plan, I can then begin marketing to this zip code.
Identifying Consumer Self-Concepts 
and Then Marketing to Them
In the past, people believed that humans only had one self, but it has been 
proven that we actually have multiple selves. No, I don’t mean you’re schizo-
phrenic. I simply mean that individuals act differently with different people in 
different situations. Here are the four basic dimensions of self-concept:
 
✓ Actual self: The actual self reflects how an individual actually is at the 
present moment. A consumer’s actual self-concept can include social 
status, age, gender, occupation, and so on. For example, I’m a market-
ing consultant. This is a real perception of me, and it’s what I portray to 
others.

117
 Chapter 7: Defining the Role of Identity: Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
 
✓ Ideal self: The ideal self is a consumer’s perception of who he would like 
to be (but isn’t). As consumers, many people are in constant pursuit of 
bettering themselves, whether it’s through education, income, health, 
or occupation. Because they aspire to have the ideal life, they often pur-
chase products that make them feel closer to that ideal self-concept.
 
✓ Private self: The private self is one that isn’t intentionally revealed to 
others. The private self represents who a person is or would like to be 
to himself (versus who he wants to be to others). Private self-concept 
can represent how you believe that you act, such as friendly, creative, 
loving, or adventurous.
 
✓ Public self: The public self is revealed to others. The public (or social) 
self-concept is how a consumer wants to be seen by others — how 
he wants to fit into society. For example, consumers may want to feel 
attractive, intelligent, and successful.
 
Self-concepts work in two ways: They’re both dynamic and organized. Because 
self-concepts are dynamic, they provide consumers with direction in their 
lives. They view their actual self and take direction to achieve their ideal self. 
Self-concepts are also organized, and because of this, they provide consumers 
with a feeling of stability. This stability makes the consumer want to protect 
and support his concepts in order to maintain a feeling of stability, which comes 
from the consistency that is provided by self-concepts. Consumers maintain sta-
bility by purchasing products that are in line with their self-concepts.
Tracing the formation of self-concepts
Research shows that humans aren’t born with self-concepts. Instead, they 
begin to emerge in the early months of a person’s life. They’re shaped and 
reshaped through repeated experiences. Specifically, self-concepts are 
a product of interacting with others. Through these interactions, people 
develop perceptions of themselves, which become their self-concepts.
The following are the three distinctive ways that self-concepts are developed 
in individuals:
 
✓ Received messages: Self-concepts are a reflection of a person’s interac-
tion with others. As the person takes in messages (both positive and 
negative) that are received throughout his life, he begins to construct 
the image he has of himself. These messages are not just verbal; they 
can be nonverbal as well. Here’s a verbal example: If an individual’s 
mother tells him every day that he will be successful, that message 
becomes a part of his self-concept (as his ideal self). He will work every 
day to better himself and reach toward that success.

118
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
 
✓ Social comparisons: When a person evaluates himself and compares 
that evaluation to someone else, he forms a self-concept (his actual self). 
An important factor to take into consideration when it comes to social 
comparison is who the individual is comparing himself to. For example, 
a 37-year-old man would likely compare himself regularly to other 
37-year-old men.
 
✓ Culture: The culture an individual was raised in contributes to self-
concepts as well. (Refer to Chapter 8 to read more about how culture 
affects consumers.) For example, an individual who was raised in a very 
loving home would have a private self-concept that causes him to act 
loving to everyone he meets.
An individual arrives at a self-concept by taking all three of these things into 
account. It’s important to realize that because self-concepts are a part of a 
person’s identity, they’re fairly stable and difficult to change, especially as 
the individual gets older. Often the only way for a self-concept to be changed 
is through a new life experience or drastic life change.
 
Because self-concept isn’t instinctive (but rather a product of interaction with 
others), it has limitless potential for development and achievement. In other 
words, consumers are always in the development phase of their self-concepts. 
And you can help them achieve those concepts by providing products that 
work to support and protect the self-concepts that are important to them.
Understanding how self-concepts 
affect the individual
By understanding self-concepts and how they affect consumers, you can use 
the knowledge to position your products in a way that’s attractive to consum-
ers, thereby causing them the desire to purchase. The following list provides 
you with information on how self-concepts affect consumer behavior:
 
✓ Individuals perceive themselves differently than others because of 
previous experiences and present perceptions. You must understand 
how your consumers see themselves, which is often based on the mes-
sages they have received throughout life. Do they perceive themselves 
as successful? If so, position your product in a way that makes them feel 
successful.
 
✓ Individuals perceive different aspects of themselves at different times 
with varying degrees of clarity. Understand the perception of your 
consumers. Are they focused on their families or careers? For example, 
if your consumers are focused on family, it probably isn’t a good idea to 
try and sell them a sports car that only has two seats.
 
✓ Any experience that an individual perceives as inconsistent with her 
self-concept can be perceived as a threat. Consumers purchase products 

119
 Chapter 7: Defining the Role of Identity: Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
that support their self-concepts, so if your consumer feels that your prod-
uct is in conflict with her self-concept she may not purchase it in fear that 
it will threaten her feeling of stability.
 
✓ Consumers tend to resist change to their self-concepts. When you 
understand the purpose of self-concepts to consumers (to provide sta-
bility and consistency), it’s easier to support those concepts rather than 
to try and change them. So make sure your product supports your con-
sumer’s self-concept.
 
✓ The more central a particular belief is regarding an individual’s self-
concept, the more resistant she will be to changing that belief. Drastic 
life changes or experiences are usually the only times that consumers 
change their self-concepts. This is particularly true in older consum-
ers. If you have a consumer who believes that buying your product is 
frivolous and a waste of money, you’ll find it nearly impossible to sell 
her that product — unless, of course, you can find a way to relate it to 
another self-concept that the consumer holds.
 
 For example, if I’m an elderly woman and you’re trying to sell me a 
security system, I may see it as frivolous and a waste of money — until 
you explain to me how it will keep me safe and protect me from intrud-
ers. The consumer’s belief that it is a waste of money is in line with her 
actual self, but safety is in line with her ideal self, which is being safe 
and secure in her own home.
 
✓ Perceived success and failure impact self-concept. Failure in a highly 
regarded area lowers evaluations in all other areas. Success in a prized 
area raises evaluations. Understand where your consumer is. Is she in 
a place of feeling success or failure? For example, if you ask her about 
her job and she tells you she was just laid off, it probably isn’t the time 
to show her your most expensive item. However, if she tells you she just 
opened up her third business, you can probably bring up that big-ticket 
item and close the deal.
 
✓ The world and the things in it aren’t simply perceived; they’re per-
ceived in relation to an individual’s self-concept. You must realize 
that consumers see things differently. The unfortunate thing is that self-
concepts aren’t visible to the eye. So you have to ask questions and really 
listen to your consumers in order to understand their perceptions of your 
product.
 
✓ The development of self-concept is an ongoing and continuous pro-
cess. The self-concepts of consumers are always developing and con-
sumers are always working to achieve them. So the positioning question 
that you must ask yourself to reach out to consumers is “How does my 
product help consumers achieve their self-concepts?”
 
✓ Individuals strive to behave in ways that are in line with their self-
concepts. It’s difficult for consumers to step outside of their self-concepts, 
because they’re sort of like comfort zones. So if your product pushes 
them outside of their self-concepts, you’ll find it difficult to get their atten-
tion. You must put your product in line with consumers’ self-concepts.

120
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
 
✓ Self-concept usually takes precedence over the physical body. In 
other words, individuals often sacrifice physical comfort and safety to 
achieve emotional satisfaction. When consumers are outside of their 
self-concepts, they experience discomfort, and so this is why they work 
hard to stay inside of them. If a consumer has the ideal self-concept that 
she wants to be in a beauty pageant and win, she’ll go out of her way 
to achieve that goal — even if it means getting to the gym by 4 a.m. As 
a marketer, show the benefit of what you offer and how you’ll help that 
consumer reach her ideal self.
 
✓ Self-concept continuously guards itself against self-esteem loss. Self-
concepts work to protect consumers. They evaluate the self-concept 
support that they gain from a product in order to make a decision 
on purchasing that product. If it’s in conflict with their self-concepts, 
including self-esteem, it’s easy for the consumer to walk away. So be 
sure you know how your product supports the self-concepts of your 
consumer.
 
Self-concept affects more than just the here-and-now, one-time purchase. It 
also affects the following:
 
✓ Memory: When your marketing message or advertisement relates to a 
consumer’s self-concept, she has a greater level of recall than she does 
with advertisements that don’t relate to the self-concept she strives to 
achieve. This is because of the dynamic component of self-concepts. A 
consumer is always developing and trying to achieve her ideal self-
concept, and memory often serves as a reminder of how to do that.
 
✓ Attitude and intention: A consumer’s self-concept affects product pref-
erence through the attitudes she forms when she sees your advertise-
ment. Advertisements or marketing messages that are congruent with 
the consumer’s self-concept can create a positive attitude toward your 
product. Similarly, when your advertisement is in line with the con-
sumer’s self-concept, her desire (intention) to purchase the product is 
strengthened. (Refer to Chapter 6 for more on attitudes and intentions.)
Directing your marketing strategy 
to engage consumer self-concepts
You can use your understanding of the four different dimensions of 
self-concept — actual self, ideal self, private self, and public self — to target 
your products to consumers. (I explain these dimensions earlier in the chap-
ter.) Here’s how you can effectively target consumers with each of the differ-
ent selves:
 
✓ Reinforce the actual self: Many products on the market attempt to rein-
force one’s actual self-concept (who a consumer is at the present time). 

121
 Chapter 7: Defining the Role of Identity: Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
So marketers target consumer segments based on that concept. Where 
do consumers live at the moment? What are their lifestyles like right 
now? How does your product work in those lifestyles? The idea is to find 
out where your consumers are right now, and then you can present your 
product in a way that supports the actual self-concept.
 
 For example, consider how minivans are marketed. They’re marketed as 
a product that’s intended to be driven by busy parents who constantly 
transport their children from place to place. Those who market mini-
vans know that parents see themselves as busy people who care about 
the safety of their children. Parents relate to this self-concept, so they 
have a desire to purchase a minivan.
 
✓ Convince consumers to make their ideal selves a reality: Consumers 
use their ideal self to compare the value of their actual self. They want 
their actual self to have similar characteristics to their ideal self. If these 
two concepts aren’t similar enough, they’ll attempt to achieve their ideal 
self by purchasing products that reinforce that self. So determine how 
your products help them get there. How do your products help support 
the ideal self of the consumer?
 
 Take for example a person who desires to be wealthy. He may not make 
enough money to be considered wealthy or upper class, but he aspires 
to be. This consumer may purchase certain things that make him feel 
like he belongs to the upper class. By purchasing an item that’s known 
to be affordable to the upper class, this consumer may feel closer to 
achieving his ideal self. He may lean toward buying a home in a specific 
neighborhood or a specific type of car.
 
✓ Evoke the behavior of the private self: You can use a consumer’s 
awareness of his private self to market your product. You can evoke pri-
vate self-concepts by using images in your marketing that portray inter-
nal self-concepts, such as happiness, joy, or health consciousness.
 
 A health food, for instance, may represent an image of living well and 
eating healthily. This image taps into the private self-concept of some-
one who feels that he’s health conscious. Consumers who see them-
selves as health conscious will buy products that reinforce their desire 
to be healthy.
 
✓ Encourage leadership of the public self: Physical attractiveness can be 
a public self-concept. In fact, it has become extremely important to many 
individuals in today’s society. Advertisements and the media enforce 
this importance by glamorizing popular role models, such as news 
anchors and celebrities. Consumers feel that physical attractiveness 
is a sign of social power, self-esteem, and wealth. So both males and 
females who value good looks feel they should emulate this attractive-
ness. Because consumers want to purchase products that make them 
feel attractive, they focus on specific clothing brands, fine jewelry, and 
sometimes even cosmetic surgery. As a marketer you want your market-
ing message to use images that are attractive and that portray the idea 
that by using your product or service the consumer is attractive as well.

Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
 
 Public self can also represent the desire to feel neighborly, friendly, 
successful, tasteful, and so on. So, for example, a consumer may buy a 
finer wine to serve at a dinner party in order to create the perception of 
having good taste.
 
It’s important to really evaluate your consumers and their lifestyles, because 
lifestyle is the reflection of self-concepts, and while self-concepts aren’t vis-
ible to the eye, you can gain a better understanding of them by viewing the 
lifestyles of your consumers. Do they enjoy fine wines and restaurants? What 
are their cars like? And how big are their houses? When you have found the 
lifestyle that your consumer represents, you’ll have a greater understanding of 
what marketing messages you should use to market your product.
 
You can effectively target your marketing message by including slogans, celeb-
rities, and product images that give consumers the idea that if they purchase 
something, it can help them create or maintain a certain dimension of self.
Reflecting on and Targeting 
Consumer Lifestyles
Lifestyle is reflective of the self-concepts that consumers hold. It’s what 
consumers put their time, money, and other resources into. It represents 
their values as well as their interests. So you can gain a wealth of information 
about your consumers by taking a deeper look into their lifestyles.
Lifestyle is technically measured by a technique known as psychographics, 
which involves measuring consumer responses to activities, interest, and 
opinions. This measurement process is known as an AIO. After gathering the 
responses, you combine them with demographic information and other fac-
tors. Next you analyze them to find distinctive lifestyle characteristics, and 
then put them into groups according to these characteristics. Finally, you 
segment the groups so the products can be positioned and the marketing 
campaigns can be created.
It’s difficult to perform an AIO without consumer data, so in this section, I 
spend some time explaining the different key lifestyle characteristics and 
help you increase your knowledge of how you can specifically use that infor-
mation to market to consumers with those characteristics.
Lifestyle characteristics and understanding how people live provides you 
with more usable information than personality assessments do. You can use 
these characteristics to develop and create marketing strategies that are 
positioned in a way that appeals to your consumers. That way your message 
relates to your consumer’s lifestyle. You also can use lifestyle characteristics 
to help select the right venues to display your advertising and marketing 
messages.

 Chapter 7: Defining the Role of Identity: Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
Recognizing lifestyle-determining factors
Consumers are affected by many factors pertaining to their lifestyles. These 
factors include income, marital status, culture, social class, and buying 
power, among others. All these factors determine the way of life for a con-
sumer. Some factors may be more important than others to some consumers, 
so you want to target those first. Targeting correctly really comes down to 
market research and what your consumers are looking for from you. (Refer to 
Chapter 12 for more information on market research.)
Income
A person’s disposable income is extremely important when it comes to con-
sumer patterns and consumption behavior. A consumer may aspire to buy 
certain goods and services, but her income may become a restriction. On the 
other hand, a consumer may have an unlimited amount of income, and so 
she may be able to buy whatever she wants. So, as you can see, income often 
determines what consumers purchase and when.
 
A consumer’s lifestyle can change if income increases or decreases. Market 
studies show that as a consumer’s spendable income increases, she’s more 
apt to spend money on her wants rather than her needs. She feels a sense 
of spending freedom. Consider, for example, lottery winners. Is a winner’s 
first purchase a loaf of bread? Typically not. It’s a new home, a luxury car, or 
an extravagant vacation. Specifically, when income increases, the following 
behaviors takes place:
 
✓ The percentage of money spent on basic necessities, such as food and 
clothing, increases. The reason for this is that consumers are now no 
longer worried about running out of money. Instead, they feel free to 
spend more.
 
✓ The percentage spent on housing remains constant, but utilities like gas 
and electricity decrease, because they’re now spending more money 
traveling and vacationing in the tropical islands and less time at home.
 
✓ The percentage spent on other items — such as recreation, education, 
self-help, and luxury items — increases.
Change of income for consumers often creates either freedom in spending 
or restraint in spending, depending on whether the income increases or 
decreases. What typically happens is that in the initial phase of an income 
increase, consumers spend money rapidly, because their income boundary 
feels lifted by more discretionary income. If a consumer’s income decreases, 
she will begin to look for ways to save money. In both of these scenarios, the 
consumer’s lifestyle is affected by the amount of income.

124
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Marital status
As you can imagine, consumer spending patterns change in direct proportion 
with marital status. For instance, when a couple marries, they have more dis-
posable income to spend. When a couple divorces, however, each party has 
less disposable income. The same is true for consumers who find themselves 
widowed. In each of these scenarios, incomes change and consumption pat-
terns are also affected.
Here’s an example: If you’re single, you’re more likely to purchase frozen 
dinners or eat out more often, because it’s difficult to cook for one. By doing 
so you save money as well. If you’re married, your grocery bill will likely 
increase, and your family will dine at home more often, because spending 
time at home is important and eating out is too expensive for a family.
 
The bottom line is that if your product is of benefit to singles, married 
couples, and divorcees or widows/widowers, you have to create three types 
of messages. You want to cater your message specifically to each of those 
groups and their lifestyles so you don’t turn off one group.
Culture
A culture is a segment of society that shares the same beliefs, learned values, 
and attitudes. It isn’t uncommon for a culture to share similar history, reli-
gion, language, thoughts, knowledge, and morals as well. All these factors 
affect consumer lifestyle and consumer beliefs. (Refer to Chapter 8 for more 
information on how culture affects consumers.)
Culture is part of the external impact that influences the consumer. It repre-
sents the pressure that’s put on him by others within his culture. Here are 
some of the ways that culture affects consumers and purchasing:
 
✓ It affects prepurchase and purchase activities as well as consumption 
patterns.
 
✓ It affects consumers’ buying habits by impacting how they perceive a 
specific product.
 
✓ It can determine which purchases consumers view as frivolous.
 
✓ It affects the way consumers search for information.
 
✓ It determines the importance placed on specific features of a product 
and product alternatives.
 
✓ It impacts the amount negotiated during the purchasing process.
 
✓ It impacts consumption — how consumers use and consume products.
 
✓ It can influence how individuals dispose of products. They may resell 
them after use, give them away to others, or recycle them.

125
 Chapter 7: Defining the Role of Identity: Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
Culture influences the following lifestyle characteristics as well:
 
✓ Communication and language: The way consumers communicate and 
the language they use often affect their lifestyle by who they associate 
with, what neighborhoods they live in, and at times what social classes 
they participate in. Keep in mind that this doesn’t just include verbal 
communication. Nonverbal communication, such as hand gestures and 
facial expressions, also affect lifestyle. As a marketer, you must respect 
the way your consumers communicate and the language they use — not 
only for clarity, but so you don’t offend.
 
✓ Dress and appearance: In many cultures, consumers dress differently. 
In some cultures, consumers wear more clothes and in others they wear 
less. This affects consumers’ behavior because it dictates what clothing 
they wear as well as what they deem appropriate or offensive.
 
✓ Food and eating habits: Cultures often determine how, what, and when 
consumers eat. Eating habits affect consumers because they influence 
the food that they buy as well as what restaurants they go to.
 
✓ Time and time consciousness: Culture affects time because in some 
cultures time is more flexible. The lifestyles of some consumers may be 
more lax when it comes to timing and appointments; others will be more 
prompt. You want to be sure that you understand this so you don’t 
offend (or become offended) when dealing with certain consumers.
 
✓ Relationships: Different cultures look at relationships with different 
importance levels. Some hold them with great respect and others see 
relationships as less formal. When working with consumers, you want to 
have an understanding of the relationships in their lifestyles so you can 
appeal to their needs.
 
✓ Values and norms: This is the most common factor of lifestyle when it 
comes to culture. Cultures carry different values and norms, so if you’re 
serving a specific culture, you need to be familiar with these values and 
norms in order to avoid being offensive.
 
✓ Beliefs and attitudes: Cultures carry different beliefs and attitudes 
toward lifestyle. Some think it’s okay to have an abundance of money, 
while others find it a blessing to live in poverty. So, obviously, these 
types of beliefs affect consumers’ lifestyles and buying habits.
 
✓ Mental process and learning: Each consumer learns and processes 
things differently, so this often has an effect on lifestyle. For example, it 
may determine where consumers send their children to school or what 
language they speak.
 
✓ Work habits and practices: Work habits and practices are affected by 
culture and they also affect lifestyle. A consumer may work 15 hours a 
day because it’s what he was taught from his culture. Or a consumer may 
only work three hours a day and then take a nap. It’s important to under-
stand how this differs from culture to culture in order to understand the 

126
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
lifestyle of the consumer you’re trying to reach out to. Here’s another 
issue to consider: Is it okay to call your consumers on Sunday to discuss 
business? Some consumers would see that practice as disrespectful and 
therefore wouldn’t do business with you.
 
As a marketer or business owner, it’s your responsibility to know the cul-
ture of your target market. If you aren’t familiar with the culture that you’re 
marketing to, you may make a huge marketing blunder that could be to the 
detriment of your business. In fact, if an advertisement is offensive or puts off 
a consumer and his culture, you’ll have a tough time gaining traction within 
the market of that culture. After all, certain acts in different cultures are con-
sidered disrespectful, and after you’ve disrespected them they may no longer 
do business with you. Even worse, they could share with everyone your dis-
respectful act, which would influence whether other people in that culture do 
business with you.
For example, in the French culture, people don’t smile when meeting strang-
ers. In fact, they don’t trust folks who smile at them before establishing a 
connection or relationship. So, if a company runs an advertisement in France 
where two strangers meet and smile, the consumers probably wouldn’t be 
receptive to that advertisement.
Social class
All societies possess a hierarchical structure that stratifies residents into 
classes of people called social classes. Groups and individuals are classified 
into this hierarchy on the basis of esteem and prestige. The groups differ in 
status, wealth, education, possession, values, occupation, lifestyles, friend-
ships, and manners of speaking. Consumers of the same social class tend 
to share the same values, beliefs, and behaviors that unite them. A person’s 
social class is relatively permanent. Members of social classes tend to social-
ize with each other rather than with members of other classes.
Here are the six social class divisions within the United States:
 
✓ Upper upper class, which represents those who have old money (money 
that has been passed up through the family). Consumer purchases in 
this class often focus more on economic status and behavioral stan-
dards in order to uphold their social status.
 
✓ Lower upper class, which represents the new rich. Consumer purchases 
in this class often focus more on upholding economic status, educa-
tional credentials, and behavioral standards in order to reach their 
desired social status.
 
✓ Upper middle class, which represents professionals or business owners. 
Consumer purchases in this class often focus more on educational cre-
dentials, increasing economic status, and behavioral standards in order 
to reach their desired social status.
 
✓ Lower middle class, which represents lower-paid white-collar workers 
and higher-paid blue-collar workers. Consumer purchases in this class 

127
 Chapter 7: Defining the Role of Identity: Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
are geared more toward behavioral standards; economic status is less 
important to them.
 
✓ Upper lower class, which represents the blue-collar worker. Consumer 
purchases in this class are geared more toward behavioral standards, 
but economic status isn’t important to them.
 
✓ Lower lower class, which represents the underemployed or unemployed. 
Consumer purchases are geared more toward behavioral standards; eco-
nomic status and educational credentials aren’t important to them.
The interesting thing about social classes is that both actual and perceptual 
factors distinguish the groups. Social class is the only lifestyle factor that 
deals with both the actual and the perceptual. In perceptual terms, individu-
als perceive that the many classes have different amounts of prestige, power, 
and privilege.
Social class tends to be a predictor of resources owned. Consumers often 
buy products and services to demonstrate their membership within a spe-
cific social class. Consumers also have been known to purchase goods and 
services to help advance their social standing within a specific class, because 
a membership in a higher social class leads to greater influence within the 
workplace, organization, and society as a whole.
 
It’s common for social class to be erroneously confused with income. But 
the fact is that social class captures those lifestyle differences that income 
ignores. For example, different social classes
 
✓ Value education differently. Consumers who value education will spend 
more on higher education, self-improvement, and workshops. Those 
who value it less will conversely spend less.
 
✓ Have different attitudes toward family life, raising children, the role 
of the women, and so on. Consumer attitudes regarding family life affect 
consumers because they have a great effect on consumption patterns. If 
a consumer believes that the role of women is to stay home, this situa-
tion often creates less discretionary income for the family. If she works 
outside of the home, however, the family will be more apt to purchase 
convenience products, such as day care, dinners out, housekeepers, and 
so on.
 
✓ Exhibit different lifestyles. The importance that consumers put on 
their public lifestyle affects their consumption patterns. If perception of 
others doesn’t matter, they’ll pay less than those who find the exhibition 
of their lifestyle a definition of their social class.
 
✓ Have different activities outside the home. A consumer who partici-
pates in multiple activities outside of the home will spend more on con-
venience items in order to accommodate that lifestyle of activities. On 
the other hand, the consumer who stays at home will have fewer outside 
expenditures.

128
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Buying power
Buying power is often referred to as a consumer’s purchasing power — the 
consumer’s ability to use the cash she has to purchase products to meet her 
current wants and needs. Buying power, which is based on the consumer’s 
income level and credit, allows her to change her lifestyle characteristics.
Buying power gives the consumer the power of choice, meaning that when 
consumers have unlimited buying power, there are no limits to what they 
can purchase to meet their needs. However, if a consumer has limited buying 
power, her purchasing decisions may not be as uninhibited.
Manufacturers often analyze the buying power of specific market segments, 
which allows them to design products and services that are a good match 
with the average amount of disposable income that a consumer within a 
specific income bracket is expected to use. As a marketer, it’s important to 
understand the buying power of your consumers, because if you have some-
thing to sell, you must have people who have money to buy.
 
It isn’t uncommon for consumer groups that share some of the same lifestyle 
factors to gather and create buying power by purchasing in quantities. How 
can you use this to your benefit? Consider tapping into groups that have the 
buying power to purchase in quantities. You can often find this by evaluating 
lifestyle. An example would be a group of attorneys who purchase legal jour-
nals at a discounted price because they purchase them in a quantity. This isn’t 
to say that you can’t target individual consumers who have a large capacity of 
buying power; they’re just typically a little harder to reach than groups. Keep 
in mind that this also can be true for services that are purchased. Consider, 
for example, the corporation that offers a discounted rate at a local gym to its 
employees. The gym offers the discount because it’s reaching consumers in 
masses rather than individually.
In order to determine buying power for consumers within your market, you 
must gather the spending data of targeted consumers, which can be obtained 
from third-party market research companies. (Refer to Chapter 12 for more 
information.) You can take this information to target specific consumer groups 
with your offer. (Chapter 10 discusses group influences of consumers.)
Working lifestyle factors 
into your marketing mix
When it comes to focusing your marketing on lifestyle factors, you must first 
understand what lifestyle factors are common within your target market. Are 
the majority of your consumers married? Are they professionals? Do they 

129
 Chapter 7: Defining the Role of Identity: Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
belong to specific social classes or cultures? You gain this information from 
market research, and then use the information to segment your market 
and identify the lifestyle commonalities. Use these commonalities to draft a 
marketing message that appeals to your target market. (Visit Chapter 13 for 
more information on identifying your target market.) In the following sec-
tions, I show you how to successfully market with each of the lifestyle factors 
in mind.
Income
Products that are considered to be luxury items are more income sensitive 
than products that consumers consider necessities. So if your product is 
considered more of a luxury, you want to go after consumers who have more 
disposable income or buying power — or at least be able to show consumers 
who have a limited amount of disposable income why your product is impor-
tant to them and why they should purchase it.
 
If your product is a luxury item, you need to keep a close eye on income and 
saving trends to avoid a decrease in sales due to a weak economy or reces-
sion. Research has shown that during slow economic times consumers tend to 
hold on tighter to their pocket books, especially when it means buying items 
of luxury. If your product is a necessity, however, you need to focus on the 
value of your product compared to your competitor’s. You need to prove why 
consumers should spend their hard-earned money to purchase your product 
rather than your competitor’s.
Marital status
In order to market your product or service to individuals based on marital 
status, ask yourself how your product or service enhances the lifestyle of 
that group, whether single, married, or divorced. Then craft your message 
directly to those consumers so it attracts and appeals to them.
For example, travel agents, homebuilders, and health clubs have recently 
recognized the purchasing power of single individuals, so they have begun to 
market to this important segment of the population.
Culture
When marketing to consumers in specific cultures, it’s important to adhere to 
their values and beliefs. When you do so, you have a better chance of causing 
those consumers to be receptive to your marketing. If you fail to adhere to 
their values, you take the risk of offending them to the point that they never 
purchase your product. (Check out Chapter 8 for more information on the 
influence of culture on marketing.)

130
Part II: Delving Into the Psychology of the Individual Consumer 
Social class
You can use social class distinctions to separate marketing programs and 
strategies in terms of product and service development as well as in terms of 
advertising and communication. To be positioned in the best possible way, 
manufacturers and retailers need to familiarize themselves with the class 
membership of their target markets and the members’ needs, wants, purchas-
ing motives, and requirements in terms of product features and benefits.
 
As a marketer or business owner, you can use social class to increase product 
influences by:
 
✓ Creating different products, services, and product/service lines 
intended for different social classes: For example, try offering your 
top-of-the-line product to those in the upper class (who can afford it and 
view it as a product that sets them apart in social status), but then also 
take the time to create products that are specific to young profession-
als in the middle class. Even though they can’t afford the top-of-the-line 
products, they’ll still have an option of purchasing a product from you. 
For example, consider the BMW 1 series that was created for the middle 
class individual who couldn’t afford to purchase the BMW 7 series.
 
✓ Marketing the types of products you offer to the social class whose 
members typically buy them: For instance, upper class is a good market 
for real estate, prestigious cars, designer clothes, foreign wines, expen-
sive hobbies, posh restaurants, and so on.
 
✓ Selling items of status, or conspicuous items, which are products that 
social classes are likely to talk about and compare among themselves: 
Fashion, jewelry, or flashy automobiles are all visible items that create 
status for consumers. They’re items that others will talk about. These 
items often make consumers feel important and be perceived as being in 
a higher social class than their peers (which is often the reason behind 
purchasing these products).
 
✓ Aiming your promotional messages to appeal to a specific social class: 
For example, the promotional messages directed to the upper class con-
sumers have to stress status, style, taste, and sophistication. These mes-
sages must also show these high-end consumers what they can do with 
the product to express themselves.
Different products and stores are perceived by consumers to be appropriate 
to certain social classes. For instance, working classes tend to evaluate prod-
ucts in more utilitarian terms and more affluent consumers tend to evaluate 
products based on appearance and body image. So when you evaluate social 
classes, you can evaluate the opportunities to create products and marketing 
strategies that enable you to go upmarket, by appealing to high-income con-
sumers, or down-market, by appealing to low-income consumers.

131
 Chapter 7: Defining the Role of Identity: Self-Concepts and Lifestyle
Buying power
You want to be sure that the market you’re targeting has the buying power 
to purchase your product. If it doesn’t, you could very well be wasting your 
marketing dollars. When evaluating buying power within your target market, 
consider providing several quality levels of the same types of products that 
match the buying power and the demand in a given sector of the market.
For example, if you’re marketing $1.5 million houses to consumers who can 
only afford $950,000 houses, you’re missing the market. If you want to create 
diversity in your product, consider creating products in the price range 
that’s within your target market’s buying power.

Cultural Settings

In this part . . .
A
s if internal influences weren’t enough to under-
stand, you also must consider the external influ-
ences that have an impact on your consumers and their 
purchasing patterns. In this part, I help you explore those 
influences. I examine cultures and subcultures and 
explain how they affect your marketing strategy.
Also, because families go through stages as well as change 
household structures, I explore the family life cycle. In 
this discussion, I include some information on why the 
roles of men and women have changed over the years. All 
this information will help you understand how each stage 
creates different consumer demands. Knowing the phase 
each of your consumers is in enables you to help them in 
the decision-making process.
Consumers also identify with social groups. In the discus-
sion regarding social group influences, I show you how to 
identify social groups and understand their influences. I 
also provide you with steps that you can take to locate 
the group leader. Knowing the group leader helps you 
have an even greater impact when marketing to social 
groups.
Finally, an interesting segment you’ll find in this part of 
the book is on consumer misbehavior. I explain to you the 
different categories of misbehavior as well as give you 
insight on what motivates it and how to detour it from 
happening in your place of business.

Cultural Influences
In This Chapter
▶ Harnessing the power of culture on purchasing decisions
▶ Getting to the root of cultural conditioning
▶ Letting consumer culture guide your marketing strategy
M
any factors leverage consumer behavior, including the disposition 
of a consumer toward a specific product. Culture is one of the most 
basic external influences on a consumer’s needs, wants, and behavior, 
because all facets of life are carried out against the background of the society 
in which a consumer lives. Culture is the all-encompassing force that helps 
to form an individual’s personality, which in turn is the key determinant of 
consumer behavior. The culture of a consumer affects her everyday behav-
ior, and there’s experiential support for the concept that culture determines 
what a consumer purchases and when she purchases it.
When you understand the culture of your consumers, you have a better con-
cept of how to serve them and guide them toward purchasing your product 
or service. This chapter looks at the power of culture, how consumers pick it 
up, and what you can do with your knowledge of culture to better serve your 
customers.
Defining Culture
The two basic things to understand about culture are that
 
✓ Culture is a standard of excellence within its own society. To partici-
pate in a given culture, you must hold the standards of that culture in 
high regard. Individuals are held to a standard that’s deemed accept-
able, and they must follow these standards in order to uphold the beliefs 
and values of that culture. This means that when purchasing your prod-
uct, the consumers must evaluate whether your product supports or 
opposes the beliefs and values of their culture.

136
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
 
✓ Culture is a way of life. You must live it as a way of life in which you 
share common experiences, a common language, and values with others 
in the culture. Individuals as consumers are very protective of their cul-
ture. Their culture is what forms their beliefs and values and is reflected 
in the way they live their lives, including purchases and consumption 
patterns. Culture is often as natural to consumers as breathing.
The three major parts of culture — beliefs, values, and norms — have dis-
tinct and powerful effects on consumers (see Figure 8-1), and you can tap 
into these elements in order to market your product in a way that’s more 
effective and appealing to consumers:
 
✓ Norms: These are rules within a culture that designate forms of accept-
able and unacceptable behavior. In short, they’re the way a culture does 
things. Norms aren’t statistical averages; they’re linked with acceptable 
social standards of appropriate behavior within a culture. They may 
or may not coincide with laws and policies; for example, it’s a common 
norm to drive 5 miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
 
 Norms have different strengths, and the consequences for violating a 
norm can vary. Cultural norms often are so strongly ingrained in an 
individual’s life that he is unaware of certain behaviors until they’re con-
trasted with a different culture that has different norms.
 
✓ Beliefs: These are mental and verbal statements that reflect a con-
sumer’s particular knowledge and assessment of something and that 
affect an individual’s behavior. The belief system of a culture is created 
through stories or myths whose interpretations can give consumers 
insight into how they should look, feel, think, and behave. The most 
prominent systems of beliefs tend to be associated with formal religion.
 
✓ Values: Values are based on the beliefs of a consumer. What a consumer 
believes is what he sees as valuable. Consumer values are deep-seated 
motivations that are instilled into the consumer from culture. The values 
of a culture differentiate right feelings, thoughts, and behaviors from 
wrong feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. An individual’s set of values 
plays an important role in consumption activities, because in many 
cases, people purchase products and services that they believe will help 
them attain a value-related goal. Every culture has a set of values that it 
imparts to members.
 
 It’s important to understand the following specific characteristics of 
value, because values are often used to guide consumers in their pur-
chasing behavior as well as in their consumption patterns:
 
• Values are few in number.
 
• Values are difficult to change.
 
• Values aren’t linked to specific objects or situations.
 
• Values are widely accepted by members within a cultural society.

A couple of examples of different cultures and their effects on individuals 
include the following:
 
✓ American culture: In America, consumers have a way of life that they 
try to uphold according to beliefs, values, and norms. What people in 
this culture may consider acceptable may not be seen as acceptable in 
other cultures.
 
✓ Generational culture: Each generation carries its own beliefs, values, and 
norms. For example, my mother’s generation didn’t necessarily believe 
the same things that my generation believes. The things that I see as 
acceptable probably aren’t acceptable for her generation. I will experience 
the same generation gap as my son grows older. His generation will have 
different beliefs, values, and norms than my generation does.
Breaking Culture into Subcultures
Each culture contains subcultures, or groups of people who share values. 
Subcultures can include nationalities, religious sects, racial groups, or groups 
of people sharing the same geographical location. Hobbies or activities can 
even create subcultures.
 
Think of a subculture as a subdivision of a national culture, based on unifying 
characteristics. Members of a subculture share similar behavioral patterns 
that are distinct from those within the national culture.
Ethnicity or nationality
Ethnicity, or nationality, defines a group bound by similar values, customs, 
dress, religion, and language. You can use this information to create market-
ing messages that are specific to the culture you’re targeting. For example, 

138
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
when researching an ethnic subculture that you are interested in marketing 
to, keep in mind that consumers strive to purchase products that support 
their heritage and appeal directly to the identity they associate with. I would 
create my marketing message in order to get the consumer’s attention and 
gain her interest in my product.
Here’s a look at examples of consumer subcultures based on ethnicity and 
nationality:
 
✓ Hispanic consumers: This subculture represents Americans of Cuban, 
Mexican, Central American, South American, and Puerto Rican descent. 
They buy approximately $425 billion in goods and services each year 
and have long been a target of marketing for food, beverage, and house-
hold products in the United States.
 
✓ African American consumers: Although this subculture has proven to 
be more price conscious than other segments of the American consumer 
population, members are strongly motivated by quality and selection. 
They display strong brand loyalty and do less shopping around.
 
✓ Asian American consumers: This segment is the fastest growing con-
sumer subculture and the most affluent one in the U.S. The group now 
numbers more than 10 million and has a disposable income of $229 bil-
lion per year.
Religion
Religion is important to people, because it provides them with a set of 
beliefs. Identifying subcultures based on religion allows you to create mes-
sages that identify with the beliefs and values of specific religious groups. 
Religion and the rules and guidelines it establishes can prevent the consump-
tion of certain products, making it even more important to understand the 
subcultures you’re marketing to. As with most cultures, you must be cautious 
not to offend or contradict the beliefs and values of those in that culture.
You can segment the market by focusing on religious affiliations, delivery, 
targeted messages, and promotions using certain media that will reach each 
segment.
Here are some examples of religious subcultures:
 
✓ Islam: Followers don’t believe in extravagance, and they wear modest 
clothing. They discourage the use of alcohol, the charging of interest, 
and the participation in anything that offends the Koran (their holy 
book).
 
✓ Jehovah’s Witnesses: Followers use conventional foods, including the 
modest use of alcohol. They’re prohibited from celebrating birthdays, 
Christmas, and Easter.

139
 Chapter 8: Cultural Influences
 
✓ Mormonism: Followers participate in mainstream society within reason, 
but they’re discouraged from using alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and caf-
feine. They’re also discouraged from eating excessive amounts of meat. 
They’re prohibited to gamble.
 
✓ Fundamentalist Christianity: Followers are encouraged to listen to vari-
ous religious broadcasts, read religious books, and attend Christian 
schools. Alcohol is commonly prohibited, and followers are also dis-
couraged from viewing entertainment that’s inconsistent with their 
values.
 
✓ Buddhism: Followers are encouraged to fulfill their essential needs in 
life, but they also are taught to keep life simple and free of attachments 
to things. It’s acceptable for Buddhists to keep replicas of religious 
objects, and they’re discouraged from consuming meat under certain 
circumstances.
 
An understanding of these religious subcultures and others should guide you 
in creating marketing messages. You don’t want to make a cultural faux pas in 
your advertising, for example, by marketing your latest hamburger to a con-
gregation of Buddhists.
Age or gender
Consumers undergo predictable changes in values, lifestyle, and consump-
tion patterns as they move through their life cycles. You can identify a sub-
culture within a culture by segmenting consumers according to age and/or 
gender.
When you understand the different age and gender subcultures, you can use 
that information to cater your marketing message and advertising to draw in 
their attention and gain their business.
For example, consider the four major age groups in the U.S. and the charac-
teristics of each group:
 
✓ Baby boomers: Represent approximately 77 million people born in the 
U.S. between 1946 and 1964 who share lifestyle similarities. They’re the 
largest and most affluent age group in history, and they have the stron-
gest impact on the housing and car markets.
 
✓ Generation X: Represents a younger crowd than the baby boomers that’s 
known for valuing religion, formal rituals, and materialism. They were 
born between 1965 and 1977. This group is smaller in number than the 
baby boomers but possesses $125 billion in discretionary income. The 
members of Generation X have a more negative attitude when it comes to 
work and getting ahead than baby boomers had at the same age.

140
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
 
✓ Generation Y: Represents the 72 million children of the baby boomer 
generation. This generation is more mixed in racial and socioeconomic 
terms than the baby boomers.
 
✓ The elderly: Represents Americans over age 55 that, by 2020, will out-
number teenagers two to one. This generation tends to process informa-
tion differently from the other groups. When it comes to comprehending 
marketing messages and advertisements, members of this group have 
difficulty with fast talking. They have an easier time with written text, 
which is the opposite of the other age groups.
 
When it comes to subcultures based on gender, it’s important to realize that 
traditional sex roles have changed and continue to change (see Chapter 9 for 
more). However, the specifics of these roles tend to depend on the culture. 
For example, the majority of women in the U.S. are in the workforce, some-
times at the cost of delaying marriage and children. However, this may not be 
the norm in other cultures.
Understanding the Power of Culture
Although every individual is different, the culture that the individual grows 
up in and lives in shapes the person’s values, beliefs, attitudes, and opinions 
toward people, things, and events in life.
The impact of culture is so natural and automatic that its influence on behav-
ior is usually taken for granted. As a result, consumers often make subcon-
scious decisions when it comes to purchases. With an understanding of the 
power and history of cultures, you’re able to cater your marketing messages 
and advertisement to specific cultures, enhancing your positive effect on con-
sumers and diminishing negative attitudes that they may carry toward your 
products.
How culture affects people and 
their purchasing behavior
The culture of a consumer not only shapes his attitude toward products and 
buying decisions, but it also creates many detriments that are behind the 
buying behavior and consumption patterns of that consumer. Here’s what I 
mean: Culture often causes uncertainty avoidance in consumers — the avoid-
ance of products that are unknown to them or that they consider to be uncer-
tain. Culture can also be a detriment if you aren’t careful to understand the 
values and beliefs of the cultures you’re marketing to. Some cultures can be 
easily offended.

141
 Chapter 8: Cultural Influences
The behaviors of different cultures at first may seem somewhat strange to 
anyone outside of the culture, but obviously they make sense to those within 
the culture. A consumer’s needs and culture are closely linked and can create 
a consumer need, either directly or indirectly. Culture also can influence the 
satisfaction of needs and the manner in which the need is met.
Culture serves the following functions:
 
✓ It promotes social system stability and facilitates collective 
commitment.
 
✓ It provides individuals with a feeling of belonging and positive 
self-esteem.
 
✓ It helps individuals create their own identities by situating themselves in 
a historical itinerary shared with others.
 
✓ It helps individuals make sense of their surroundings, particularly in 
attempting to answer the question, “What is the meaning of life?”
 
In other words, culture gives individuals a road map and directions to follow 
during times of uncertainty. It can provide a feeling of psychological security 
and can contribute to a clearer understanding of why society functions as it 
does and how it pertains to their futures.
As you can see in the preceding list, culture meets many of the emotional 
needs of individuals. Because of this, individuals strive to protect the beliefs 
and values of their cultures, which are in turn reflected in their behavior as 
consumers. Here’s how culture specifically impacts consumer behavior:
 
✓ It serves as the lens through which consumers view products as well as 
your company.
 
✓ It impacts the consumers’ values, attitudes, motives, and goal-directed 
behavior as well as their personalities.
 
✓ It influences the overall priorities that consumers attach to different 
activities and products.
Culture is often expressed in material objects such as clothing, jewelry, cars, 
computers, and music systems. Consumers are always working to uphold the 
values and beliefs of their culture and not to violate the norms. Consider, for 
example, the generation of kids who enjoy hip-hop music. This culture influ-
ences the clothes they wear, the places they hang out, and the music they 
listen to. You could also look at religion and the attire that some cultures 
require. For example, in the Islamic religion, women are required to cover all 
areas of their bodies, except the front part of their face and their hands. This 
affects the clothes that they purchase.
Culture has a stronger impact on impulsive purchases than on planned pur-
chases. Marketing experiments show that culture-based differences tend to 
show up when information is processed in a quick and spontaneous manner. 

142
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
When consumers have more time to deliberate on a purchase, cultural fac-
tors tend to have less effect on the decision.
 
Culture changes continuously, so as a marketer you should be aware of what’s 
happening all the time. Cultural shifts are important environmental changes 
that can make your marketing strategy obsolete. So, it’s important to always 
keep your eyes and ears open for cultural shifts that can point to new prod-
ucts that consumers may want or to the possibility of an increase in demand 
for existing products. When you notice a shift, you need to change your mar-
keting tactics in order to meet the needs of the culture.
For example, a cultural shift toward greater concern about health and fitness 
has created opportunities and even new industries that service consumers 
who want to buy
 
✓ Low-calorie food
 
✓ Health and gym memberships
 
✓ Exercise equipment
 
✓ Activity or health-related vacation packages
Another fantastic example is the increased desire for leisure time. This has 
resulted in an increased demand for convenience products and services, 
such as microwave ovens, oven-ready meals, telephone banking, and online 
bill pay.
How cultural understanding increases 
marketing effectiveness
When you understand the basics of why consumers are affected by culture, 
you can take a deeper look at the components that make up culture. You 
then use those components to understand the different cultures. This pro-
cess enables you to make your marketing more effective and appealing to the 
culture you’ve targeted.
Understanding how culture influences consumer purchasing leads you to the 
issue of how consumers from different cultures can behave in radically differ-
ent ways and yet be completely convinced that they’re right.
For example, when you consider different religious cultures, you may find 
one that believes you shouldn’t work on Sunday while the other believes it’s 
okay to do so. Both groups believe they’re right, and the truth is that neither 
is wrong because the belief is held within the norms of their own culture. By 
understanding these cultural differences, you would know that marketing to 
the consumer who doesn’t work on Sunday could be a waste of your market-
ing dollars.

143
 Chapter 8: Cultural Influences
Culture is the broadest of social influences that marketers and business 
owners have to deal with. Products and services that resonate with the 
priorities of a culture at any given time have a much better chance of being 
accepted by consumers. Here’s why:
 
✓ Consumption choices don’t make sense without considering and 
understanding the cultural context in which they’re made. Before a 
consumer can make a purchase, she must validate the purchase with 
her culture’s values and beliefs to ensure it supports and doesn’t violate 
them.
 
✓ Culture determines the success or failure of your specific product 
or service. If your product or service offends core beliefs and values 
that a culture supports, your chances of selling within that culture are 
decreased. However, if your product supports the culture, consumers 
are more likely to purchase from you. The same can be said of your mar-
keting communications.
Sometimes a subculture creates a substantial and distinctive market segment 
on its own. For example, in the previous section, I show you two different 
examples of culture: American culture and generational culture. In each of 
these cultures, you can segment subcultures in order to create marketing 
materials that appeal to the different segments. You can use age groups in 
each of these cultures, or you can use gender or nationality. If I specifically 
target my marketing message to women in the American culture that are 
between the ages of 30 and 35, I have the ability to speak directly to their 
needs based on their beliefs, values, and norms.
 
Marketing strategies are ineffective when they don’t adapt to the specific cul-
ture that’s predominant in your target market segment. Potential customers 
will respond to advertising messages that are congruent with their culture, 
rewarding you — through purchasing — for understanding their culture and 
tailoring your advertisements and marketing messages to them and their 
needs.
Seeing Cultural Conditioning 
in Action and in Effect
Consumers acquire their culture through cultural conditioning. Cultural con-
ditioning not only produces certain behaviors but also affects the values and 
beliefs behind those behaviors.
Culture is acquired at a very young age through

144
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
Each of these influences plays a role in how culture is acquired and learned. 
It’s difficult to distinguish whether one is more important than another, 
because the influence is really dependent on the culture itself. The different 
parts of culture — including beliefs, values, and norms — are often learned 
and processed differently as you see in the following sections.
Conditioned behavior: Norms
Culture is present in three distinct learning forms:
 
✓ Formal learning: When parents teach children how to behave
 
✓ Informal learning: When a child imitates the behavior of others
 
✓ Technical learning: When a child learns from teachers and instructors
 
Although cultural conditioning occurs mostly in early childhood, adults con-
tinue to be conditioned as they acquire new behaviors throughout their lives.
Following are the five phases in the process of cultural conditioning. Pay 
attention to these phases when you’re researching cultures that you want to 
market to; then you can see specific ways the consumers in that culture have 
been conditioned by that culture and how you can appeal to them with your 
marketing message.
 
1. Observation/instruction
 
 An individual is only beginning to become aware of a particular behavior 
or activity and hasn’t tried to perform it yet. For example, in some cul-
tures it’s customary to eat with your hands rather than with utensils. In 
this phase, you may be observing or being instructed on how to eat with 
your hands, but you haven’t yet tried to do it.
 
2. Imitation
 
 An individual tries to carry out the behavior or activity being learned. 
For example, you sit down and begin to imitate those within the culture 
by eating with your hands, no matter how awkward the activity.
 
3. Reinforcement
 
 An individual is encouraged by those within the culture to continue the 
cultural norm. For example, you receive encouragement to continue 
trying to eat with your hands.
✓ Playing
✓ Schooling
✓ Sports participation
✓ Family and home life
✓ Media

145
 Chapter 8: Cultural Influences
 
4. Internalization
 
 An individual begins to internalize the cultural norm, leading it to feel 
like a natural behavior or activity. For example, it begins to feel natural 
to eat with your hands rather than use utensils.
 
5. Spontaneous manifestation
 
 An individual is no longer conscious of performing the behavior or 
activity and does it without paying attention because it’s not strange or 
unusual. For example, you’re no longer conscious of the fact that you’re 
eating with your hands and don’t notice the absence of utensils.
Conditioned beliefs and values
Three basic organizations transmit culture values; if you understand the 
influence these organizations have and have had on the consumers in your 
target market, you can use those organizations to assist you in speaking 
directly to those consumers in a way that they will understand and relate to. 
The three organizations are
 
✓ Family: The family is the first to instill a child’s belief system, attitudes, 
and values. It also teaches the language of the culture, and language is 
the fundamental facet of culture because it binds members of the cul-
ture together through basic communication. The family is the primary 
agent for teaching consumer-related values and skills that are in line 
with cultural teachings.
 
✓ Religious organizations: Religious organizations are responsible for 
reinforcing the belief systems that a family instills in a child. A child who 
grows up within a religious organization is continually taught the values 
and belief systems of the culture. Religious organizations continue to 
nurture cultural values throughout the life of an individual, providing 
religious consciousness, spiritual guidance, and moral training.
 
✓ Educational institutions: Within a culture, educational institutions work 
to instill skills, ideas, attitudes, and training in particular disciplines that 
fit into the cultural setting. Charged with imparting basic learning skills, 
history, patriotism, citizenship, and technical training, educational insti-
tutions transmit cultural norms and values to each new generation.
Applying Cultural Perspective 
to Your Marketing Strategy
It’s important to realize the impact that culture has on how you market to 
consumers in different cultures. Consumers uphold the beliefs, values, and 
norms of their cultures. This affects what they buy, how they buy it, and 

146
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
often who they buy it from. When consumers go to purchase an item, they 
take the information about that product or your marketing message and sub-
consciously compare it to the values and beliefs of their cultures. This com-
parison happens immediately.
Identifying common cultural factors 
among your consumers
When marketing to a specific culture, you want to be sure that you have all 
aspects of that culture in mind. This means looking at how the culture affects 
the members’ lifestyles, the way they talk, and even the rituals they participate 
in. As I mention earlier, you can do more damage than good by marketing to a 
culture that you aren’t familiar with. So you must take extra steps to make sure 
that your message isn’t only pertinent to your consumer, but that it supports 
their beliefs and values as well. You need to take some time to gather more 
information in order to successfully market to a culture segment.
Where and how to gather the info needed
A culture’s values are the fundamental force that drives markets. Look at 
indications of how people within a specific culture want to live and how they 
express that desire in the marketplace.
 
When evaluating specific cultures and working to market to those cultures, 
ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Why are customers doing what they’re doing?
 
✓ Who are the customers?
 
✓ When do customers purchase your products?
 
✓ How and where can the media reach customers?
 
✓ What’s new on the product front that you can present to customers?
 
When you’re evaluating the values within a culture, it’s important to under-
stand why consumers behave a specific way. The reasons behind behaviors 
and actions can predict the products consumers will use. They also can pre-
dict the marketing channel that will be most effective in reaching that culture.
You can find out these reasons by doing some fieldwork. Chapter 12 instructs 
you in market research, but here are my top suggestions:
 
✓ Monitor a small sampling of consumers in their natural environments. 
Focus on their behavior and find the answers to the preceding ques-
tions. However, remember that it’s important that consumers aren’t 
aware that you’re monitoring them.
 
✓ Use focus groups and interviews.

147
 Chapter 8: Cultural Influences
What to look for
It’s important to understand how the culture you’re trying to reach communi-
cates through language, symbols, and rituals. This way you can communicate 
with them in a way that they understand.
 
✓ Language: Consumers use language as an expression of culture. The lan-
guage of a culture creates a shared meaning. As a marketer, you should 
focus not necessarily on what is said but rather on how it’s said. For 
example, you don’t want to use words that have a different meaning in 
one culture than they do in yours. You also don’t want to communicate 
in a way that’s considered offensive to those that you’re marketing to.
 
✓ Symbols: Cultures use symbols to communicate ideas, emotions, and 
thoughts. Keep in mind that your brand also can be seen as a symbol. 
Different types of symbols include numbers, colors, gestures, animate 
objects, and inanimate objects.
 
✓ Rituals: Rituals are symbolic activities that consist of a series of steps 
occurring in a fixed sequence and repeated over time. Cultures use them 
to uphold their beliefs and values in ceremonial ways. Rituals can be 
both public and private and are often formal and scripted. Examples of 
different types of rituals include
 
• Religious rituals, such as baptism, meditation, and religious services
 
• Rites of passage, such as graduation and marriage
 
• Cultural rituals, such as festivals and holidays
 
• Civic rituals, such as parades, elections, and trials
 
• Family rituals, such as mealtimes and birthdays
 
• Personal rituals, such as personal grooming and housekeeping.
You can use language, symbols, and rituals to gain a better understanding of 
how specific cultures communicate and behave. This information can then be 
used to communicate with them and market to them in a way that they will 
understand and be receptive to.
Appealing to your target audience’s 
cultural background
Consumers are overloaded with advertising and marketing messages each 
day, so it takes something personally appealing to get their attention on you 
and your product. When you can appeal to a consumer’s cultural background 
and support his values and beliefs, he takes an interest in what you have to 
say. In fact, consumers will go out of their way to support businesses that 
support them, their culture, and the things that they hold dear. To gain this 
attention, use messages that consumers can relate to and images that reflect 
their cultural heritage.

148
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
For example, suppose you’re trying to appeal to the Hispanic market, but 
you don’t speak the language of that culture or understand what they value 
and believe in. How do you market to this group in a way that the members 
understand? You can appeal to this market by constructing a radio spot that 
broadcasts on a Spanish-speaking radio station or creating television com-
mercials to air on a Spanish-speaking television station. You also could put 
an ad in a magazine that’s specifically geared toward Hispanic culture.
 
The key is this: Before you do any of these things, it’s your job and duty to 
gain the information necessary to understand a consumer’s culture. It’s a 
mistake to think you can enter into any culture and market to them without 
researching first.

Chapter 9
The Influences of Household 
Structure and Role
In This Chapter
▶ Examining home life, including household structures and roles
▶ Taking a look at traditional and nontraditional households
▶ Using household information to market successfully
P
eople grow and develop as individuals and as consumers. Over the 
course of a lifetime a family will go through many stages of develop-
ment, and with each stage comes an entirely new set of consumer develop-
ments. So you must determine the marketing campaigns that will work best 
not only in targeting the family, but in specifically targeting the structure that 
the family has.
Looking at Home Life
In today’s society, we have traditional households as well as nontraditional 
households, so instead of using the older term family life cycle, we now use 
the more modern term household structure. Household structure represents 
the number of people living in a home, the ages of those occupants, and the 
household income. Household structure is important because it affects the 
consumption and purchasing patterns of those living in the home. It also has 
an effect on the roles that individuals in the household play. These roles are 
used in the decision-making process.
A primer on household structures
The term family can be defined many different ways. So in order to take full 
advantage of marketing directly to families, it’s important to understand the 
different structures that they can have. Consider the following terms:

150
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
 
✓ Family: A group of two or more people related by blood, marriage, or 
adoption who reside in the same home
 
✓ Nuclear family: The immediate group consisting of a father, mother, and 
a child or children that live together
 
✓ Extended family: The nuclear family plus other relatives, such as grand-
parents, uncles and aunts, cousins, and parents-in-law
 
✓ Family of orientation: The family into which a person is born
 
✓ Family of procreation: The family that’s established by marriage
As you study households, you may also notice that some include pets as 
important parts of the family. So, when I speak of families, I’m not only talking 
about a family in a traditional sense. Instead, I’m referring to the representa-
tion of families in many walks of a consumer’s life.
 
Different households have different needs, so by understanding the different 
categories of households, you can create effective marketing messages that 
appeal to the different categories. Households are grouped into the following 
two categories:
 
✓ Family households: The family household represents groups or persons 
that are related by blood or marriage. The following four types of family 
households are the most common:
 
• Married couple that lives alone
 
• Married couple with children
 
• Single parent with children
 
• Extended family, which may include parents, children’s spouses, 
grandchildren, and occasionally cousins
 
✓ Nonfamily households: The nonfamily household is a household that 
consists of nonfamily members. Nonfamily households include the 
following:
 
• A single person living alone in a dwelling unit
 
• Roommates living together
 
• Persons living in boarding houses
 
• Elderly persons living with nonfamily members
 
• Persons of the opposite sex sharing living quarters
 
• Same-sex couples
 
Family households are most common, but recently there has been a rapid rise 
in the number of nonfamily households. This means that it isn’t enough to 
just market to the traditional households. You must also look to see how your 
products can fill the needs of the nontraditional households by creating mar-
keting messages that they can relate to.

151
 Chapter 9: The Influences of Household Structure and Role
Defining an individual’s household role
Household decision making is much different than individual decision 
making. That’s because you have input from more people. Individual house-
hold members often serve different roles in decisions that ultimately draw on 
shared family resources. Just like you have roles in the household, you also 
have roles when it comes to the decision-making process for the household. 
Each role is important in the family decision-making process. These house-
hold roles include the following:
 
✓ Influencer: The person in this role is responsible for influencing the pur-
chase decision. This person doesn’t necessarily have the power to make 
the ultimate decision between alternatives, but he makes his wishes 
known by asking for specific products or acting out if the demands 
aren’t met. Example: The child who screams throughout the discount 
store because he wants a particular color bicycle.
 
✓ Gatekeeper: The person in this role is responsible for controlling the 
flow of information to the other family members. Example: The mother 
updates everyone on the purchase information and decision as well as 
when the purchase will be completed.
 
✓ Decider: The person in this role is the family member who makes the 
final decision regarding the purchase. The decider evaluates whether 
to buy, which product to buy, which brand to buy, where to buy it, and 
when to buy it. Ultimately this person has the power of decision over 
each of these issues. Example: The father who decides which bicycle to 
purchase after reviewing the features and costs of two different bicycles.
 
✓ Buyer: The person in this role is responsible for engaging in the actual 
transaction or purchase. Example: The mother who goes to the discount 
store to purchase the desired bicycle.
 
✓ Preparer: The person in this role is responsible for preparing the goods 
for use. Example: The dad who puts the bicycle together so the child can 
ride it.
 
✓ User: The person in this role is responsible for using the product that 
has been purchased. Example: The child who rides the bicycle.
 
✓ Maintainer: The person in this role is responsible for maintaining the 
purchased product. Example: The child who puts air in the tires of the 
bicycle or cleans it after running it through mud puddles.
 
✓ Disposer: The person in this role chooses when and how to dispose of 
the product. Example: The dad who’s cleaning out the garage and real-
izes that the child has finally outgrown the bicycle. He may choose to 
put the bike in the trash, or he may donate it.
 
It isn’t uncommon for family or household members to play multiple roles in 
the decision-making process. And these roles can also often break tradition. 
For instance, dad isn’t always the decider. Mom and child can also play the 
role of the decider.

152
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
Recognizing how household structure 
and role affect purchasing behavior
It’s important to realize that consumer purchase patterns can be determined 
by the household structure. Various stages in family life — that is, the house-
hold structure at a given time — result in different buying patterns. At each 
stage, the person plays a different household role and buys symbols of that 
particular role at that time. For example, when a couple marries in a tradi-
tional household, the man buys the woman a ring. Then when the couple has 
a baby, they buy furniture to prepare for the new addition.
Household roles also play a part in consumption patterns and buying habits. 
For example, it’s the role of the decision maker to decide to buy, what prod-
uct to buy, what brand to select, when to buy, and where to buy it from. 
Figure 9-1 shows how all the factors fit together.
Factors that affect a household’s purchasing behavior
Consumption factors within the family are determined by the following:
 
✓ Number of people within the family: This factor affects consumption 
because with more people in the family, the more products you need to 
care for the family.
 
✓ Ages of the family members: This factor affects consumption because 
it determines what types of items you need. If you have infants, you will 
need diapers, baby formula, and other items. If the family members are 
older, you may need other types of products to care for the family.
 
✓ Number of employed adults: The main reason this factor affects con-
sumption is because it affects income. The more income a family makes, 
the more they’re likely to spend.
Variables that change the household structure
Five structural variables can change the household structure. The five vari-
ables include
 
✓ Age of head of household or family
 
✓ Marital status
 
✓ Employment status
 
✓ Disposable income
 
✓ Discretionary income
 
✓ Presence or absence of children
Children dramatically change how the family functions in terms of relation-
ships, employment, and purchases. For example, children often reduce 

153
 Chapter 9: The Influences of Household Structure and Role
parents’ participation in the labor force. This change alone affects how families 
spend money, and it reduces the amount of time and money available to the 
family for leisure activities.
You may be shocked to know that children influence approximately $1.88 tril-
lion dollars in purchases globally each year. You may wonder how these little 
tykes can do this. Here’s how: Children exert direct influence over parents 
when they request specific products and brands. They also can exert indirect 
influence when parents buy products and brands that they know their chil-
dren prefer without being asked or told to make a specific purchase.
Parents aren’t the only ones making purchases; children also make their own 
purchases with family money or with their own money. Children like to shop 
for toys, candy, clothing, school supplies, and other personal items. Retailers 
spend exorbitant amounts of money to adapt specific departments to these 
young, but significant consumers.
Understanding how you can market 
to the many household influences
Common household structures and roles help explain how families change 
over time. You can use them to identify core target markets and use that data 
to modify your marketing message. These influences are great predictors of 
family and household spending.
When you understand the common household structures a family can have, 
you can better understand the products that consumers use as the structure 
changes. You can find information through market research that shows you 
what interests and motivates them and what kind of financial status the aver-
age person has. Doing so helps you create a marketing message that’s appeal-
ing and enticing to them. You also can use the household variables to monitor, 
measure, and predict changes in demand for specific product categories.
Household structure serves as a more accurate tool than chronological 
age because there are significant differences in consumer spending habits. 
Differences include consumption patterns, the amount of money spent, the 
products purchased, and the products that are of interest to the consumer.
 
The decision-making process within families is crucial to your business. When 
you understand the structure and lifestyle of the household you advertise in, 
you can cater your message to meet its needs. This increases your chance of 
drawing the household into your business, purchasing your products, and 
using your services. If you aren’t catering your advertising in this way, you’re 
missing what could potentially be a large market.

Examining Traditional Household Stages 
and Their Buying Influences
Every household goes through stages over time. During these stages, the 
household’s basic structure changes. Nine primary stages have been identi-
fied, but not all households go through all the stages. The number of stages 
that a family goes through depends in part on the family’s lifestyle choices. In 

155
 Chapter 9: The Influences of Household Structure and Role
the following sections, I show you the different stages within the traditional 
family household structure.
The term traditional family has been used since the 1950s when TV shows 
portrayed the ideal family as a husband who was the breadwinner and the 
wife who stayed home to take care of the two children who were under the 
age of 18.
In this section, traditional refers to a husband and a wife that have children. 
The reason it’s important to distinguish between traditional and nontradi-
tional families is that it plays a large part in how you market your products.
 
Market research shows that in today’s world of families, less that 6 percent 
of American families fit into the traditional role. You want to be able to dis-
tinguish between the two so that neither the traditional nor nontraditional 
household takes offense to your marketing message. For example, if you have 
a commercial that appeals to the wives that do stay home and take care of 
their children, are you losing the other 74 percent that don’t?
 
It’s possible for individuals to repeat family stages if their family situations 
change, or if they find themselves in stages that are different from most 
people their own age.
Young singles
The young singles stage is often referred to as the bachelor stage. It’s repre-
sentative of both male and female individuals. In this stage, the consumers 
don’t live at home with their parents; they have branched out on their own.
Young singles are new in their careers and usually have the income level 
of an entry-level employee. They have few financial burdens. They lead the 
fashion world with their opinions, and they’re recreation oriented. They tend 
to spend money on basic kitchen equipment, furniture, entertainment, vaca-
tions, dating, and clothing.
Newly married couples
Newly married couples are typically young with no children. They typically 
have two incomes, and they tend to be better off financially than they are in 
later stages. They’re present and future oriented.
Newly married couples have the highest overall purchase rate and the highest 
rate of purchasing durable products, which are products that are purchased 
infrequently, such as appliances, furniture, and consumer electronics. They 
buy automobiles, refrigerators, stoves, and sensible and durable furniture. Like 

156
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
young singles, they still spend money on entertainment, and they like to spend 
money on vacations.
Full nest I
The consumers in the full nest I stage are married, and their youngest child 
is under the age of 6. They have one to one and half income sources. Home 
purchases peak in this stage. These consumers have low liquid assets, and 
they’re future oriented.
In this stage, most consumers are dissatisfied with their finances. They’re 
interested in newly advertised products, and they buy washers, dryers, tele-
visions, baby food, vitamins, and children’s toys.
Full nest II
In the full nest II stage, consumers are married, and their youngest child is 6 
years or older but still dependent on them. They’re in a better financial posi-
tion than they were in the previous stage, and they’re future oriented.
These consumers have one to two sources of income. One of the spouses 
is established in a career at this stage. The other spouse may work or may 
stay home to take care of the children. The consumers in this group are less 
influenced by advertising. They buy larger automobiles, larger cars, a variety 
of foods, bicycles, and music lessons. They enjoy luxury and comfort. They 
tend to put more money in savings than in other stages.
Full nest III
The married couple in the full nest III stage is typically older with older 
dependent children who are typically in their teenage years. These consum-
ers are still in a better financial position and are considering retirement.
More income is available because many times both spouses and even the 
children have jobs. Advertising has even less of an influence at this stage. 
Couples in this stage have a high average rate of purchasing durable prod-
ucts, buy more tasteful furniture, travel more by car, and purchase nones-
sentials like appliances, boats, dental services, and magazines. They enjoy 
comfort and luxury.

157
 Chapter 9: The Influences of Household Structure and Role
Empty nest I
The empty nest I stage represents an older married couple with no children 
living at home with them. The head of the household is still in the labor force. 
Home ownership is at its peak. Some of the couples have even purchased the 
homes they will retire in. These consumers have a good income and are satis-
fied with their finances. They’re considering retirement.
Consumers in this stage have an interest in travel, recreation, and self-
education. They make gifts and contributions to charities and organizations 
that they support. They buy vacations, luxuries, and home improvements.
Empty nest II
The consumers who are in the empty nest II stage are usually older married 
couples with no children at home. The head of the household has retired, 
and so they’ve experienced a drastic income cut. They’re present oriented.
The consumers in this group tend to keep their homes. They enjoy travel, 
recreation, and sometimes a new home to better suit their lifestyle. They buy 
medical appliances and medical-care products that aid their health, sleep, 
and digestion. Their interest is comfort at a fair price.
Solitary survivor
In this stage, one spouse is still alive, and the other is deceased. The living 
spouse is typically employed. That spouse has a good income and is present 
oriented.
Solitary survivors enjoy their jobs and friends. They like to travel, buy cloth-
ing, enjoy recreation, and spend money to take care of their health. They’re 
likely to sell their homes in order to find new homes that better suit their 
lifestyles.
Retired solitary survivor
In the retired solitary survivor stage, one spouse is still alive, and that 
spouse has retired. The spouse has a low source of income due to a drastic 
income cut.
Retired solitary survivors enjoy traveling, social activity, and recreation. 
They have special needs for medical products, attentions, affection, and 
security. They have concern for their security and the economy.

Familiarizing Yourself with Common 
Stage Variations
The stages I introduce you to in the previous sections represent the tradi-
tional stages. But you have to keep in mind that our society has changed, 
causing variations within today’s families and households. In order to incor-
porate the variations into your marketing strategy, you have to expand your 
view of the household stages.
 
Certain stages don’t necessarily fit into the traditional stages. For example, 
consider single parents, married couples with no children, and older singles. 
These consumers represent a large percentage of our society today. So when 
you leave one of them out of your marketing mix, you’re missing a selling 
opportunity. So be sure to create messages that appeal to the market you’re 
specifically targeting. Sometimes this may mean having more than one market-
ing message.
In the following sections, I give you an in-depth look at the recent trends and 
how they’re affecting household structures and gender roles.
Exploring the changes and trends
In today’s society, households are changing. A larger market share is con-
tinually growing outside of the traditional household structure. You have to 
evaluate the changes in order to understand how they can and do affect your 
marketing strategy. These changes affect the various stages of the consumer 
decision-making process and can provide more marketing opportunities if 
you better understand them. I introduce some of the more recent trends in 
the following sections.
Trends in marriage
Many consumers today are delaying the age at which they get married. So 
you’ll see more consumers cohabitating rather than saying “I do.” The unfor-
tunate truth is that in today’s society more than 50 percent of marriages end 
in divorce, so it isn’t uncommon for consumers to shift between married and 
single status. These shifts change consumption patterns and spending habits. 
The changes have been so significant that often divorce is called the “new 
marriage.” These trends are changing the spending habits on household 
products, homes, therapy, travel, and more.
Trend in singles
In recent years our society has seen an increase in single households. Singles 
that are cohabitating with other singles is the fastest-growing segment of 
the singles market. It isn’t just younger singles either. The mature singles 

159
 Chapter 9: The Influences of Household Structure and Role
population is growing as well. The median age of singles is 66 and most of 
them are women. These women make up 61 percent of the singles market in 
the United States. The majority of these women are widowed. The facts are 
different when it comes to single men. The men are usually divorced or have 
just never married.
If you haven’t tapped into this market share you could be missing out on a 
large opportunity. This market is most often targeted with travel, financial 
services, entertainment, and social recreation.
Trends in the gay and lesbian population
The increased gay and lesbian population is a prime example of why you can 
no longer depend on the traditional household structures when it comes to 
your marketing. Many companies are now targeting the gay community, and 
they’re finding that there’s money to be made from this consumer group. A 
recent study by public relations and marketing firm Witeck-Combs reported 
that by the year 2011, the buying power of this consumer group will be more 
than $800 billion in the United States alone.
 
The key is to understand how you can reach this market. You’ll have more 
success reaching this market by creating market activities that build relation-
ships with the members of the group. Marketers have found success in spon-
soring gay-oriented events and creating advertising that specifically targets 
the gay consumer group.
Considering trends in gift giving
It’s important to consider rituals within a family 
structure. Consider, for example, gift giving. Gift 
giving occurs through family traditions, rituals, 
and celebrations. When you’re familiar with 
the gift-giving seasons, you can gear up and 
market your products heavily during that time 
to increase sales. Take, for example, Christmas. 
Many people purchase gifts around this time. If 
your product isn’t out there or you aren’t mar-
keting during that time, you could lose out on a 
great deal of market share.
Gift giving and the celebration of holidays within 
families are increasing in importance. You can 
tell this by the number of holiday employees 
that stores hire to accommodate consumers 
as well as the increased rate of travel during 
the holidays. In fact, traditional holiday spending 
and promotions have shifted to other holidays 
throughout the year, and more retailers are 
marketing on other holidays throughout the 
year rather than just during Christmas. Physical 
movement of large gifts has become difficult, 
which has lead to an increase of gift certifi-
cates, gift cards, and Internet gift purchases.
To take advantage of the gift-giving seasons, 
create a holiday marketing calendar and use 
specific holiday marketing techniques to attract 
consumers to do their holiday shopping with 
you. You also can market by reminding consum-
ers of holidays coming up that they may forgot-
ten. Think of all the husbands that purchase a 
Saint Valentine’s Day gift because a promo-
tional marketing piece reminded them that the 
holiday was coming up.

Identifying new structures 
that have emerged
Our society is changing. What we used to consider abnormal is now consid-
ered normal. We’ve seen the acceptance of couples that live together but 
don’t marry. We’ve seen the couples that decide they don’t want to have chil-
dren. We’ve also witnessed the rise of gay and lesbian couples as well as indi-
viduals that decide to live alone by choice. Changes will continue to happen 
in our society that will reflect in the acceptable and changing lifestyle struc-
ture. By continually being aware of the new trends within household struc-
tures, you can understand how they’re affecting the current marketplace.
 
Nonfamily households and the trends within the household structure that 
I explain earlier in the chapter are expected to grow more rapidly than tra-
ditional families over the next two decades. However, with that in mind, 
remember that the highest incomes today are still within the traditional family 
households.
The following sections explore the newest structures that have emerged as a 
result of recent trends.
Single parents
Single parenthood can result from either divorce or from the death of a 
spouse. Divorce usually entails a significant change in the relative wealth 
of each spouse. In some cases, the noncustodial parent may not pay the 
required child support. Even if the child support is paid, however, the custo-
dial parent and children still may not be as well off as they were during the 
marriage. On the flip side of that situation is the situation where the noncus-
todial parent is called to pay a large portion of her income as child support. 
This situation is particularly problematic when the noncustodial parent 
remarries and has additional children in the subsequent marriage.
Single parenthood generally results in the purchase of low-cost furniture 
and household items. However, the purchases increase when it comes to 
time-saving goods and services. If you’re marketing to single parents, keep 
this in mind and make special note of how your products fit into the lives of 
single parents. Do you have low-cost solutions that you can market directly 
to them? Do you have a service that can enhance and make their lives a little 
easier at an affordable price? Really think about how your product benefits 
single parents, and then market those benefits directly to them.
Married couple with no children
It’s common in today’s society for a married couple to decide that they don’t 
want to have children. This decision may be a personal choice or may come 
as a result of complications in having children.

161
 Chapter 9: The Influences of Household Structure and Role
In this household structure, the couple bypasses the full nest cycles (shown 
in the earlier section “Examining Traditional Household Stages and Their 
Buying Influences”) and moves forward in the solitary phases. The couple’s 
priorities are different than they would be if they had children. They tend to 
spend more money on luxury and comfort. They also travel more and enjoy 
more leisure activities. They’re able to save more and spend more on the 
finer things in life. They’re focused on the future, but enjoying the present. 
This couple is generally supported by two income sources, because they’re 
typically both established in their careers.
Older singles
A person settles into this structure either because of the death of a spouse or 
the desire to never marry. This group doesn’t fit easily into any of the other 
household structures, so it’s rarely the focus of marketing or advertising mes-
sages. And rarely will you find market research on this growing demographic.
 
This doesn’t mean they can’t be reached, however. It’s actually a market that 
isn’t acknowledged and that is somewhat untapped. So determine how your 
products fit into the lifestyle of older singles. If you believe your products 
offer this group a benefit, sit down and clarify those benefits and put your 
marketing message out there to them. I think you’ll be surprised at the results, 
because they, too, are consumers.
In the past, this group has been known to have low levels of income and not 
much wealth. However, times are changing and the status of being an older 
single has become even more common in today’s society.
Seeing how the trends affect gender roles
In today’s society, the old stereotypes surrounding the gender roles in a 
household are no longer one-size-fits-all. The roles that each gender fills are 
diversified and sometimes even unique. Some would even say their gender 
roles have become more balanced over time.
Obviously the importance of masculinity and femininity isn’t going away any 
time soon, but as a society we’ve become comfortable with roles that are less 
centered on what sex we are and centered more on our lifestyle and house-
hold structure.
When you market your products, you need to know who you’re marketing to 
in order to give consumers a message that grabs their attention and entices 
them to purchase from you. Keep in mind that sometimes focusing more on 
the lifestyle of your targeted consumers produces better results.

162
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
The changing roles of women
The number of female consumers now outweighs the number of male con-
sumers. This imbalance is mostly due to the fact that women tend to outlive 
men. Also, over the years, women have improved their purchasing abilities 
and have established a greater importance within the workplace. In fact, the 
employment of women has increased and is continuing to increase around 
the world. It has increased household incomes and family buying power, but 
it has also increased family expenditures. Families are spending more money 
on child care, clothing, dining out, and gasoline.
These changes have had an effect on women and the amount of time they 
have for leisure activities. As their roles outside of the home increase, their 
leisure time decreases. In turn, their interest and desire for time-saving 
products, such as eating out, has increased as well. The demands outside of 
the home have put a greater demand on the women, so they’re often unable 
to perform the tasks women once did when they traditionally worked only 
within the home. As women find themselves contributing more to the family 
income, they’re expecting in return that other household members pitch in 
and assist with the household responsibilities.
 
How do you reach women now that they have gone through this metamorphic 
change? Well, women are still sensitive to the marketing messages and adver-
tisements that appeal to the “mother” category. However, keep in mind that 
different segments exist within the demographic of women — even more so 
than in the past — so you must create your marketing messages and adver-
tisements specifically for the different segments. Each segment looks at adver-
tising, the Internet, products, time, and brands differently. (Refer to Chapter 
13 for more information on how to identify key segments within your market.)
As you can see, women face different challenges today than they did in previ-
ous years. So depending on the career orientation and responsibilities in and 
out of the home, time pressure, and society pressures, you need to adapt 
your ads in order to reach women and grab their attention. For example, a 
retail shop may advertise special services, such as a personal shopper, or 
may extend its hours in order to accommodate a woman’s work schedule.
 
Marketing to women isn’t a difficult task, but to be successful at it, you must 
identify the needs that your product provides a solution to and then create 
that message in a way that will appeal to them directly.
The changing roles of men
Today the roles of men are changing. They’re becoming more involved in 
family activities, social functions, and household duties. In fact, today men 
often go to the store to purchase products for the family.
Men are also experiencing a gender role transcendence and are beginning 
to use products previously seen as feminine and only used by women. This 
explains the “retro,” “uber,” and “metro” descriptions recently created for 

163
 Chapter 9: The Influences of Household Structure and Role
men. For example, companies now frequently use the following terms as mar-
keting tools:
 
✓ Metrosexual: This term is used to encourage men to take an interest in 
their personal appearance. This tactic has had great success, and the 
market of personal-care products is a great example. The increased 
attention to their personal appearance has had a positive effect on mar-
kets such as men’s clothing, accessories, and toiletries.
 
✓ Ubersexual: This term indicates that the male is still macho but also in 
touch with his feminine side.
 
✓ Retrosexual: This term has been used to refer to men who reject metro-
sexuality and prefer to stay with the old-school style. They can be distin-
guished by their classical masculine identity.
As a society, we have caused a major shift in the perceptions of men, and 
because of that we have created different market shares for the changing 
roles.
It’s also becoming increasingly common for men to stay at home with the 
children while the woman focuses on her career. Similarly, our society has 
seen an increase in single dads having custodial care of their children when 
marriages end in divorce.
An increase in the number of males with the caregiver role has had implica-
tions in terms of widening the range of products that men regard as accept-
able. Consider, for example, the commercials that now show men making 
dinner. Also present is a shift in the number of household products and 
children’s products that target their market messages to the male market. I’m 
sure you’ve also seen commercials in which the father is changing a baby’s 
diapers or giving a child a bath.
Targeting Your Marketing to Specific 
Household Types and Roles
When you understand the common household structures and stages and 
keep on top of the current trends, you can use the information to create your 
marketing strategy and advertising messages. In other words, you need to 
define your product as it relates to each household structure and stage, and 
then you can create a marketing or advertising message to reach out to each.
I’ve talked about the household structure both from a traditional and nontradi-
tional perspective. I’ve also spent some time on the different role changes that 
are occurring for consumers. You must take all these things into account when 
marketing to consumers. When you make your message more appealing to the 

164
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
market you’re targeting, you can entice them to buy and use your products. If 
you don’t do this, you could be missing out on gaining a larger market share. 
Marketing messages also must be sensitive to the consumer and their needs in 
order to be effective.
In this section, I show you how to take the information you’ve gained and 
create a marketing message that not only gets the attention of consumers 
that you’re targeting, but increases your sales by doing so.
Assessing your consumers’ 
household income
Knowing the income of your consumers helps to ensure that you’re actually 
marketing to people that have the means to buy your product. For example, 
if you’re selling a car that’s $75,000, you don’t want to market it to a single 
parent who’s only making $12,000 per year. You can also use this information 
to gauge the lifestyle of the consumers you’re interested in. Refer to Chapter 
7 for more information on the lifestyle of consumers.
 
Three types of income exist:
 
✓ Disposable income: This is the take-home pay of the consumer. It’s the 
income the consumer brings home after deductions for taxes, social 
security, and insurance are taken out.
 
✓ Real income: This is the consumer purchasing power. It’s the income 
after adjusting for inflation.
 
✓ Discretionary income: This is the consumer’s disposable income that’s 
left over after regular commitments, such as mortgage or rent and pay-
ment of utilities, are deducted.
It’s important to recognize the difference in income so you gain a true picture 
of the consumer’s spendable income.
Factoring in family dynamics 
and disagreements
Every consumer goes through a decision-making process, and household 
structure plays an important part in this process. Because you’re more than 
likely dealing with more than one consumer that has input into the decision-
making process, you may find that the process is more difficult. You may 
even encounter conflict. When you understand the process, you can step in 
and help guide the consumers by answering questions, reassuring, and guid-
ing them into the purchase.

165
 Chapter 9: The Influences of Household Structure and Role
When families are making decisions, they come to one of two conclusions:
 
✓ Agreement: This conclusion, which is called the consensual decision, is 
where the family agrees on the purchase and the only thing that may 
differ among family members is how the purchase will be achieved. 
They may not yet have a decision on the terms of the purchase or on the 
purchase place.
 
 A great example of a consensual decision within the family is the pur-
chase of a pet. All family members have decided that they want to add 
a dog to the family, but they may not know where to get Rover or what 
kind of dog he will be.
 
✓ Disagreement: This conclusion, the accommodative decision, is where 
family members may have different preferences and can’t agree on a 
purchase that will satisfy everyone within the family.
 
 Take, for example, the purchase of a movie. Children in the family may 
want to purchase a cartoon; dad may want a suspense movie; and mom 
prefers a drama flick. Not everyone in this situation will be satisfied, so 
the decision will accommodate only one or some of the family members.
 
Family decisions in particular are often subject to a great deal of conflict. 
Conflict occurs where there isn’t a clear understanding of the needs and pref-
erences of each family member. However, by understanding the two types of 
conflict, you can position yourself to solve these conflicts. The conflict is caused 
by either logical or social factors. You can use your knowledge of the degree of 
conflict to help in the resolution. Involve all family members in the process. And 
remember that in order to be successful in helping in the decision-making pro-
cess, you must be able to identify the roles of each family member and under-
stand the conflicts each may be encountering. By understanding and being able 
to identify the level of conflict, you can step in and address the family’s con-
cerns and needs.
Logistical factors
Specific factors dealing with logistics determine the degree of conflict in the 
decision-making process. These factors include the following:
 
✓ Interpersonal need: This factor deals with a family or household mem-
ber’s level of investment within the group. Conflict can arise when mem-
bers of the family have different levels of participation in the investment.
 
✓ Product involvement and utility: This factor pertains to the degree to 
which the product in question will be used or how successful it will be 
in satisfying a need. Consider, for example, when a family purchases a 
washer and dryer. Conflict can come up because perhaps the person 
responsible for doing the laundry feels as if he should have more say in 
the purchase because he will be the one using the washer and dryer the 
most.

166
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
 
✓ Responsibility: This factor refers to the person responsible for procure-
ment, maintenance, and payment of the purchase. Consider the pur-
chase of a car. Conflict may come up when there isn’t an agreement on 
who will take responsibility for that car.
 
✓ Power: This factor represents the power that one family member may 
have over the others in making a decision. For example, a parent may 
express power over the children by making a decision and saying to 
them “because I said so.”
Social factors
Certain social factors affect families and households as well. These factors 
deal with the way the members of the family socialize and relate with one 
another. Consider the following:
 
✓ Cohesion: This factor refers to the emotional bonding between family 
members. Conflict can come up when a family member feels that she 
isn’t being heard or that her opinion is being overlooked because she 
isn’t as close to a family member as another member is.
 
✓ Adaptability: This factor pertains to the ability of a family to change its 
power structure, role relationships, and relationship rules in response 
to situational and developmental stress. Conflict can arise when new 
members enter the family structure and the other family members can’t 
adapt to the change.
 
✓ Communication: This factor pertains to the ability that a family has to 
communicate, specifically regarding communication about a purchase. 
Conflict can happen when not all family members feel like they’re being 
equally communicated with about a purchase.
Dealing with interests and responsibilities
All consumers have different interests and responsibilities that they have 
to take care of. When marketing to consumers, take into consideration what 
they’re interested in and what their responsibilities are. For example, if 
you’re dealing with a father who’s interested in golf, perhaps you want to 
market a family golf trip to him. If your consumer is a mother who works 
outside of the home and has three children, you probably want to take into 
account the workload that she carries and how your product can help her in 
feeling less tired and stressed.
 
As you know, consumers see hundreds of marketing messages daily, so you 
need to stand out from the crowd. Use the interests and responsibilities of the 
consumers to attract them to your product by appealing to those components 
in your message. Doing so helps them feel as if you have a genuine interest in 
their needs and are willing to help. It also makes them feel like you have really 
taken the time to find out more about them before releasing another market-
ing message.

In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the different types of groups
▶ Exploring consumers’ reactions to groups

I
ndividuals identify with groups to the extent that they can take on the 
values, attitudes, and behaviors of a particular group. Consumers who 
belong to different groups often have similar tastes, traditions, likes, and dis-
likes of others within the group.
In this chapter, I take you through an in-depth look at the different types 
of groups that typically affect consumer behavior, how they impact it, and 
how you can adapt your marketing strategies to target particular groups of 
like-minded people. I also delve into the psychology behind the formation of 
those groups, as well as their communal behavior, so you can better under-
stand the folks you’re targeting with your marketing efforts.
Getting a Glimpse of the
Strength in Numbers
Consumers are social creatures who want contact with others. As a 
result, consumers often belong to a number of formal and informal groups. 
A group represents two or more individuals who share a set of norms, values, 
or beliefs. The group members have certain relationships that make their 
behavior interdependent. A group also has a collective identity; the members 
interact with one another, and they have a shared goal or interest.
When it comes to marketing, groups are referred to as reference groups 
because they provide consumers with a point of reference. This reference 

168
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
point explains a consumer’s behavior. An individual uses the reference 
group’s perspective or values as the basis for his behavior. The reference group 
provides an individual with a point of comparison for personal attitudes, 
behaviors, and performance. Major consumer reference groups include 
family, friends, social class, selected subculture, one’s own culture, and 
other cultures.
In the following sections, I identify three categories of groups, explain how 
consumers behave in response to groups, and reveal the marketing opportu-
nities that groups offer you.
Recognizing the major types of groups
There are three types of groups, which can be broken down into more spe-
cific groups. Knowing what types of groups a consumer belongs to can tell 
you how much influence the groups have in a consumer’s lifestyle and over 
the consumer’s decisions. The types of groups include
 
✓ Primary groups: These groups are intimate, face-to face groups, such 
as family or peer groups. Family and peer groups are considered infor-
mal groups within the primary group category. Formal groups are highly 
defined in their structure, and they tend to interact less frequently. 
School groups, business groups, or work groups are examples of formal 
groups within the primary category. Examples of primary groups include 
the following:
 
• Peer group: This is a group of individuals who share the same age, 
social status, and sometimes interests. In this group, individuals 
are relatively equal in terms of power when they interact with each 
other.
 
• Clique: You can usually find these informal, tightknit groups 
in high school or college settings. The members seem to share 
common interests. This group establishes power among its mem-
bers, but it can shift.
 
• Household: This group represents all individuals who live 
together. This category can include traditional families, blended 
families, roommates, or people living in group homes.
 
✓ Secondary groups: These are groups that are seen less frequently; 
they’re considered more impersonal than primary groups because they 
interact only occasionally. Examples include shopping groups, sports 
groups, alumni organizations, and technical associations. Here are some 
examples of secondary groups:
 
• Club: A club can be dedicated to a particular activity, such as a 
car club or sports club. You usually have to apply to become a 
member.

169
 Chapter 10: The Power of the Masses: Group Influences
 
• Community: This group represents individuals that develop a rela-
tionship based on a shared interest. They often have group leaders 
and a well-organized structure.
 
• Gang: A gang is usually an urban group that gathers in a particular 
area. They are similar to clubs, but they tend to be less formal.
 
• Mob: This is a group of individuals who have taken the law into 
their own hands. They usually gather temporarily for a particular 
reason.
 
• Squad: This is a small group, usually comprised of three to eight 
people. They work as a team to accomplish a shared goal.
 
• Team: This group is similar to a squad, but is typically made up of 
more people. The members work together to accomplish shared 
goals.
 
✓ Symbolic groups: These are groups that you never join, but you try to 
take on their values. Your favorite football team, basketball team, or 
baseball team would be considered symbolic groups.
 
By understanding the different types of groups and the extent of the influ-
ences they have on consumers, you can better understand your consumers.
Seeing how groups influence 
consumer behavior
Groups carry significant weight when it comes to the influence they have on 
consumers. Consumers often believe that others hold a great deal of power 
over their own behavior. Because of this belief, social power can greatly influ-
ence the types of products that consumers buy, the attitudes they hold, and 
the activities they choose to participate in.
Groups influence consumers and buying patterns in two ways:
 
✓ Individual decisions: Groups can affect an individual’s buying habits 
and purchases. Individuals often evaluate themselves by comparing 
themselves to others. Groups provide a reference point that consumers 
use to measure their behaviors, opinions, abilities, and possessions.
 
✓ Collective decisions: Group members sometimes make a decision as 
a group, usually as a result of discussion. The majority often rules, so 
even if an individual in the group disagrees with the group decision, the 
individual will often still side with the group.
By knowing how a group makes its decisions, you can determine where to 
focus your marketing efforts in order to have the best chance of influencing that 
group decision. For example, if you know a group focuses more on making 

170
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
collective decisions than individual decisions, you should focus on the 
group leaders in order to have a greater impact and influence on the group’s 
decision. If the group is more focused on individual decisions, focus on the 
impact and influence you have one on one with the individuals.
 
Group influence doesn’t just affect buying behavior. Consumer attitudes, opin-
ions, and values are heavily influenced by reference groups, even if a specific 
purchase doesn’t directly result. Groups that consumers belong to, want to 
belong to, or want to avoid provide them with information, rewards, and pun-
ishments that they use to shape their behavior and identity. This, in turn, 
influences purchases, consumption, and communication.
What groups do
Reference groups influence behavior in three general ways:
 
✓ Groups provide information needed to make decisions. Informational 
influence gives consumers the information they seek and the advice 
that pertains to their purchases. Consumers use the reference group’s 
behavior and attitudes to help them to make their own decisions, 
because they view the group as a reliable source of information.
 
 Informational influence can result from an explicit search for facts, but 
it’s also present when a consumer isn’t searching for information. For 
example, if a consumer is looking for a physician, she often asks friends 
for suggestions and recommendations. When a consumer isn’t seeking 
information, her friend’s behavior may influence her actions. For exam-
ple, a consumer may see a friend drinking a new beverage and decide to 
try one.
 
 If the group has a negative perception of your product or service, you 
need to change that perception at the group level in order to gain a 
positive outcome from the individual consumers in the group.
 
✓ Groups reward or punish behavior to encourage compliance. Normative 
influence occurs when consumers conform to a group’s expectations to 
receive a reward or avoid punishment. Compliance with these expecta-
tions often leads to valued rewards. For example, when a teenager wears 
clothing that her peer group approves of, she feels accepted, or rewarded. 
If she wears clothing that isn’t accepted, she may feel shunned by the 
group; she considers this rejection a punishment.
 
 It’s important to understand the standards of compliance within a group 
in order to ensure that you’re providing the individuals in that group 
with products they’ll be rewarded for; otherwise, the consumers within 
the group will avoid your product in order to avoid group punishment.
 
✓ Groups project shared values to influence members to behave similarly. 
Value-expressive influence refers to how consumers internalize a group’s 
values or why an individual joins a group to express her own values and 
beliefs. Individuals seek membership into groups that hold values that 

171
 Chapter 10: The Power of the Masses: Group Influences
are similar to their own. Also, they often choose to adopt the values 
that are held by the group.
 
 Because consumers internalize the group’s values, if your products or 
your marketing message doesn’t support those values, you’ll lose con-
sumers in that specific group rather than gain them.
 
Many groups influence consumer behavior, but not all groups have the same 
influence. It depends on how much contact an individual has with a group. 
The degree to which a reference group affects a purchase decision depends 
on an individual’s susceptibility to the group’s influence and how involved she 
is with the group.
How consumers respond
Individual consumers can react to groups in different ways. In other words, 
they can go through three processes of social influences. They can
 
✓ Comply with the group’s expectation. When it comes to compliance, 
it’s not uncommon for individuals to do something overtly, even though 
they don’t necessarily believe in it. For example, someone may arrive 
to work on time, even though he’d rather sleep in an extra hour. But he 
arrives when he’s scheduled to because, within the work group, it’s a 
compliance issue. He complies to fulfill his role within the group.
 
✓ Conform to the group’s way of thinking, believing, and behaving. 
Sometimes consumers find satisfaction from conforming. An individual 
conforms to the group by changing his behavior, views, and attitudes 
to fit in with the group’s views. This often helps an individual find his 
identification within that group. That is why you often find that individu-
als dress like members of a group that they admire. Take a look at the 
students at your local high school and notice how they all tend to have 
the same style and fashion sense. This is one way students identify with 
their peers as a group. They conform to the style of the majority to fit in. 
(I discuss conforming in further detail later in this chapter in the section 
entitled “Why customers succumb to group influence.”)
 
✓ Internalize attitudes and behaviors that agree with their own values. 
Group members internalize the group’s teachings, particularly if the 
person teaching is viewed as an expert. Parents, teachers, and ministers 
are great examples of people within groups who can teach attitudes and 
behavior. An individual internalizes the information that’s presented 
because of the respect he has for the person doing the teaching.
These processes help develop a consumer’s attitude, which influences how 
an individual thinks and why he acts and responds as he does (see Chapter 6 
for more on consumer attitudes). All three reactions can in some cases be 
prompted by a single reference group. The way that a consumer reacts or 
responds to group influences is really determined by the type of group, type 
of influence it has, and the amount of influence it has on the consumer. Figure 
10-1 shows the influencing factors and possible purchasing behavior outcomes.

Identifying the marketing 
opportunities groups provide
By understanding the influences that a group has on the consumers you’re 
targeting, you can adapt your marketing strategy to influence a number of 
people simultaneously. You can market to the group’s commonalities as well 
as to their leadership. You also can influence the purchasing behavior of that 
group so it turns to you when it needs to purchase items and services for the 
group itself.
Information within groups often spreads by word of mouth. Individuals hear 
about what others are doing, what they are using, and whether they like 
certain products. Consumers share all kinds of information — both positive 
and negative — about purchases, services, experiences, and more. This infor-
mation can have a major impact on consumer behavior. As I explain in the 
earlier “What groups do” section, individuals find out about new products 
from friends and reference groups by observing or participating with them as 
they use the product, or by seeking and receiving advice or information from 
members of the group.
 
When it comes to your marketing strategy, word-of-mouth information 
exchange can have a positive or negative effect (or both), depending on how a 
group feels about your product. If a group supports your product, selling it to 
the individuals in that group is much easier; if the group doesn’t like your 
product, you’ll have a tough time gaining market share from that group. 
Opinion leaders within groups have a great deal of influence over how a group 
feels about your product. (Refer to the later section “Targeting the leader of 
the pack” for more on opinion leaders.)
Gaining a Deeper Understanding 
of Group Influence
It isn’t uncommon for reference groups to change as situations change for 
individuals. For example, a college student’s reference groups change during 
her years in college. Before a student begins college, her strongest reference 
group is her family. She relies on the values, beliefs, and attitudes that her 
family instilled in her while growing up. During her college years, however, 
her strongest reference group changes to her peers. This is especially true 
for students who attend college outside of their hometowns. Even though 
both of these groups can work simultaneously, one may carry more influence 
over an individual at certain times.

174
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
In the following sections, I explain how groups affect a consumer’s behavior 
and why individuals follow the herd. I also discuss the amount of influence 
that groups have over their members.
Where a group gets its power of influence
Groups carry a level of social power with them. Social power is the ability of 
an individual or a group to alter the actions of others. Groups get their power 
because consumers respond to the following:
 
✓ People they admire: When consumers imitate qualities by copying 
behavior of a prominent person they admire, this is called reference 
power. Consumers are often persuaded by groups that are either similar 
to or represent someone they want to be like. Belonging to such groups 
allows consumers to feel as though they fit in.
 
✓ People with information: A group or individual can influence a con-
sumer through knowledge of or experience with a specific subject. This 
is called information power (or sometimes expert power). Consumers 
may alter their behavior based on the perceived expertise of the source 
of information. When a group provides superior expertise to consumers, 
it often increases the group’s trustworthiness.
 
✓ People with authority: Groups gain legitimate power by granting people 
authority, which is sometimes conferred by a uniform. In this scenario, 
the group has a legitimate right to try to influence the individual. Take, 
for example, religious leaders. An individual gives a rabbi or a priest the 
right to influence him.
 
• Ability to reward: A person within a group can use reward power 
to provide positive reinforcement. Parents and supervisors often 
use rewards. Advertisements use reward power to attract con-
sumer groups. Groups frequently have the power to reward mem-
bers for compliance with expectations.
 
• Ability to punish: A group can use social or physical intimida-
tion to give the perception that a consumer will be punished if he 
doesn’t do what the group wants. This is called coercive power. 
When consumers fail to give in to a group’s expectations or rules, 
disapproval can be harsh and may even result in the loss of 
membership.
 
It’s important to understand the social power that groups have on consumers 
in order to gauge the type and amount of influence they have on their members. 
This tells you how you can use the social power of the group to influence con-
sumers. If the group has a great deal of influence, you need the support and 
backing of the group in order for the consumer to purchase your product; if 
their influence is minimal, the support of the group may be less important.

175
 Chapter 10: The Power of the Masses: Group Influences
Why customers succumb 
to group influence
A group meets certain internal needs for its member individuals, including 
the following:
 
✓ Desire for reward or fear of punishment: When a group carries the per-
ception that it can give rewards and punishment based on compliance, 
the group’s influence on an individual is strong. Consumers usually 
comply with the group to receive a benefit; sometimes people do what 
the group wants to avoid negative consequences.
 
✓ Need to protect or modify their self-image: Group members often use 
their membership to protect their own self-image or self-concept. For 
example, an individual may join a group that represents a specific cause 
because she feels strongly about that cause. After she has joined, she 
begins to project the group’s values as well.
 
✓ Desire for social acceptance: This type of influence comes into play 
when a consumer conforms to the group’s expectations. Real or per-
ceived pressures from a group on an individual can change the indi-
vidual’s beliefs or actions. To be accepted in the group, a person may 
conform to the group’s wishes without necessarily accepting all of its 
beliefs or behaviors.
In order to become or remain part of a group, consumers oblige the group’s 
expectations in order to meet their own internal needs; this outcome applies 
to the way they behave as consumers — what products they buy and where 
they buy from.
What determines the strength 
of a group’s influence
Individual loyalty and dedication to a group determines the strength of a 
group’s influence in terms of the number of people it influences as well as the 
level of control it has over those people. By understanding how strong of an 
influence a particular group has over its members, you can identify whether 
you’ll market to the group or to its individual members. The following sections 
show you how to assess the strength of a group’s influence on its members.
Members’ attraction and commitment to the group
When you classify groups, you understand why consumers are attracted to 
the group, which helps to measure the depth of influence that group has on 
its members. Groups can be classified in three ways:

176
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
 
✓ Nature of association: This area of classification considers how consum-
ers are connected to the group; this information helps you determine 
its members’ dedication and loyalty to the group. For example, does the 
group require a paid membership? Is it a group of family members or 
peers? Groups within this category can be further separated into the 
following subcategories:
 
• Membership groups: These are groups that individuals already 
belong to. An example is a local gym that an individual belongs to.
 
• Aspirational groups: These are often nonmembership groups. 
Individuals have a strong, positive attraction to these groups and 
an interest in joining them. Aspirational groups can have a strong 
influence on the purchase and support of products. An example of 
an aspirational group is the Olympic team. An individual aspires to 
be a part of that group.
 
• Associative groups: These groups include people who represent 
the individual’s peers. Examples would be co-workers, neighbors, 
and members of a church, club, or organization to which the 
person belongs.
 
• Dissociative groups: These groups have values that an individual 
rejects or doesn’t agree with. Individuals have a negative attraction 
to them and don’t want to join them. People often go out of their 
way to avoid these groups or the products they promote.
 
• Virtual groups: These groups are based on virtual communities 
rather than geographic communities. Examples are social network-
ing groups such as online forums, Twitter, or Facebook.
 
 You want to associate your products with aspirational groups, and you 
need to accurately represent associative groups in your marketing 
pieces. You should try to avoid referencing dissociative groups in your 
marketing materials and advertisements so you don’t turn consumers 
off to your product.
 
✓ Frequency of contact: The frequency that group members have contact 
with one another often determines depth of information that they share 
and the amount of influence the group has on them. Members of primary 
groups generally have frequent interpersonal contact, while people in 
secondary groups generally have limited interpersonal contact. Larger 
groups tend to have less contact.
 
✓ Attractiveness: Attraction refers to how appealing (or unappealing) 
a group is to an individual. Individuals can be interested in specific 
groups for different reasons. When you understand why individuals are 
attracted to a group, you can use the information to market to those 
members with specific interests.
 
 For example, suppose a young professional is attracted to a group that 
has an interest in wine. He feels that this group is a great source of wine 
education and assists him in donning sophisticated social graces in 

177
 Chapter 10: The Power of the Masses: Group Influences
situations where wine is served. You know that he’s attracted to sophis-
tication; knowing that, you can research the group more in order to 
home in on his personality and find out what attracts his interest. If this 
is a group that you see as having an interest in your product, you want 
to take these personality cues to create your marketing message. In 
other words, your marketing message must carry a sophisticated, upper-
class, graceful tone in order to gain the attention of the group members.
Need or desire that a product or service fulfills
The influence that reference groups have on a consumer to purchase a spe-
cific product varies. There are four categories of influence, which involve 
product and brand, and you can put each purchase of an item or service into 
at least one of these categories. The categories are as follows:
 
✓ Public necessity: These are products that are a necessity to the con-
sumer and easily seen by the public. Examples of a public necessity 
purchase include a wristwatch, automobile, or man’s suit. With a public 
necessity, the influence a group has is weak for the product, but strong 
when it comes to the brand.
 
✓ Private necessity: These are products that are a necessity to the con-
sumer, but not easily seen by the public. Examples of a private necessity 
purchase include a mattress, floor lamp, or refrigerator. With a private 
necessity, the influence is both weak for the product and weak for the 
brand.
 
✓ Public luxury: These are products that the consumer feels are a luxury 
and are often in view of the public. Examples of a public luxury purchase 
include golf clubs, skis, or a speedboat. The influence of a group on the 
purchase of public luxuries is both strong for the brand and strong for 
the product.
 
✓ Private luxury: These are products that the consumer views as a luxury, 
but they aren’t often seen by the public. Examples may include a video 
game, an undercounter wine cooler, or an icemaker. The influence of a 
group on the purchase of private luxury items is strong for the product, 
but not for the brand.
 
When you understand these categories and can place your product into one of 
them, you can measure how much influence a reference group carries and 
how you should cast your marketing message to reach the consumer. You can 
cater your marketing message by classifying your product and gauging how 
much influence reference groups have on the purchase of your product. This 
information tells you whether you need to be concerned with the reference 
groups your consumers belong to.

178
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
Tailoring Your Marketing 
Strategy to Groups
When you understand the factors that groups implement to encourage like-
mindedness, you can better understand your consumers’ preferences and 
allegiances as well as the amount of influence the group has on them. By 
implementing into your own marketing strategy the same tactics that the 
group does, you can often see great results — especially when reaching out 
to specific groups and understanding how they appealed to an individual to 
join them in the first place.
The following sections help you pinpoint the group concerns and interests 
that your marketing strategy should focus on. I also reveal how you can best 
appeal to those groups.
Identifying what group members 
have in common
Groups have core characteristics that help you understand the individuals 
within a group. These core characteristics hold the group together. The char-
acteristics not only tell you the influence the group has on its members, but 
it also can provide you with a basis of the members’ belief systems, norms, 
and habits. Core characteristics include
 
✓ Social status of group’s members: Have the members attained a certain 
status level? Are they wealthy or poor? Do they believe in luxury or 
necessity only? When you evaluate status within a group, you can 
identify what the individual members value. For example, if a group 
is wealthy and belongs to a specific country club, you can market golf 
clubs to their higher-end tastes.
 
✓ Common values, attitudes, and behaviors among group members: 
Members within a group develop particular ways of interacting with 
each other. They develop norms within the group. Norms are considered 
to be the rules that a group uses to determine appropriate and inappro-
priate values, behaviors, and attitudes. Are you violating norms within a 
group you’re trying to reach? When you evaluate a group’s norms, you 
can identify their traditions and habits.
 
✓ The role the group fills for its members: What is the role of the group 
to its members? Every member within a group has a role, in the same 
way the group plays a role in the consumption patterns of individuals. 
For example, some roles within the group relate to task aspect of the 
group; others may relate to social interaction. When you evaluate 
a group’s role, you can identify what is important to its members.

179
 Chapter 10: The Power of the Masses: Group Influences
 
✓ Nature of social interactions among group members: How do group 
members get along with each other? Where can they be reached? When 
you evaluate the social interactions of a group, you can identify how 
they communicate with one another.
 
✓ Amount of social power the group holds over its members: The 
amount of social power that a group carries measures its capacity to 
alter the actions of its members, who can sometimes influence those 
outside of the group.
 
You can use a group’s characteristics to tailor your message. Making your 
message specific to the group members helps you speak their language. When 
you know how a group encourages conformity, you can use that information 
to help encourage conformity around your product.
Assessing the strength of the group to 
understand its influence
An individual is attracted to a group based on the group’s ability to satisfy 
the individual’s internal needs. An individual looks for positive ways to 
conform with the group consciously and subconsciously. When working to 
create a marketing strategy toward a specific group, it helps to understand 
the group characteristics that an individual looks for, because then you can 
understand why the group appealed to the individual and focus on those 
appealing characteristics in your marketing strategy. Characteristics that 
affect the strength of a group’s influence include
 
✓ Attractiveness: How interesting and engaging the group is for its 
members
 
✓ Expertise: How much individuals rely on the group for information and 
expertise about a specific area of interest
 
✓ Credibility: Whether and how much reliable insight the group gives 
individuals
 
✓ Past success: Whether and how much hope and trust the group gives 
individuals that they can claim the group’s past successes as their own
 
✓ Clarity of group goals: Whether the group gives its members a feeling of 
accomplishment
 
If you aren’t sure what groups to target, you can look at your individual con-
sumers and the groups to which they belong. You can then determine whether 
that group is worth going after with your marketing strategy and, if so, how 
you can best do so.

180
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
Determining how you can 
appeal to the group
You can gain a lot of information about consumers when it comes to the way 
that groups appeal to them. A group can encourage conformity by following 
these steps:
 
1. Raise awareness of a specific brand, product, or service. You can try 
several strategies to increase a group’s awareness of your product or 
service:
 
• Target groups of interest for market research. By doing this you 
can make sure that your marketing message accounts for the influ-
ence of reference groups within that target market.
 
• Offer product samplings and free trials to groups. By offering 
free trials and samplings to groups, you can enhance the chances 
of positive word-of-mouth marketing that spreads throughout the 
group.
 
• Identify the opinion leader and use your advertising to motivate 
her to purchase your product or service. Opinion leaders within 
groups carry a great deal of influence; sometimes you need only 
reach one opinion leader and sell her on your product, and then 
she’ll turn around and sell your product to the entire group. This 
tactic is often a great way to reach the masses in a short amount 
of time.
 
2. Provide the individual with the opportunity to compare her thinking 
with the group’s attitudes and behaviors.
 
3. Encourage the individual to adopt attitudes and behaviors that are 
consistent with the norms of the group.
 
4. Legitimize the decision to use the same products as the group.
How do you appeal to the group to gain an interest in your product? You can 
appeal to consumers with their reference groups by using
 
✓ Celebrities
 
✓ Experts
 
✓ The “common man”
 
✓ An executive or employee spokesperson
 
✓ A trade or spokes-character
 
✓ Other reference group appeals that consumers may be affiliated with

181
 Chapter 10: The Power of the Masses: Group Influences
You often find that it is not only the messenger that’s important in a refer-
ence group; sometimes it’s also the message you share and how you share it 
that is of interest. You also can use different types of appeals by celebrities 
to attract group members’ attention. Examples include the following:
 
✓ Testimonials: A celebrity attests to the quality of the product or service 
based on personal use.
 
✓ Endorsement: A celebrity lends her name and appears on behalf of a 
product or service for which she may not be an expert.
 
✓ Actor: A celebrity presents a product or service as part of a character 
endorsement.
 
✓ Spokesperson: A celebrity represents the brand or company over an 
extended period of time.
The way that you get your message to a group depends on the group itself 
and the target market you’re trying to reach. You must do your market 
research to be effective and understand the group. (Refer to Chapter 12 for 
more information on market research.)
When you have the information that you need to gain a better understanding 
of who you’re marketing to, you then need to create a marketing message 
that’s specific and appealing to that group. (Refer to Chapter 16 for more 
information on drafting your marketing message.)
 
You can also locate group leaders or other prominent members to ask for 
advice on marketing specifically to their group. Opinion leaders are well 
respected in their groups, and many times they will accept promotional 
opportunities and act as a spokesperson for your product. (See the following 
section for more on opinion leaders.)
Targeting the leader of the pack
An opinion leader can hold great sway over the members of his group. The 
opinion leader is the gatekeeper of the group; he is a knowledgeable, acces-
sible individual who provides information about a specific sphere of interest 
to his followers. This person can be very persuasive.
Here are some characteristics of an opinion leader
 
✓ Knowledgeable about products
 
✓ Heavy user of mass media

182
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
 
✓ Early adopter of new products; he buys products when they’re first 
introduced into the marketplace
 
✓ Self-confident and sociable
 
✓ Willing to share product information
For these reasons, you want the opinion leader to focus his attention on your 
product or service. Opinion leadership happens in a two-step process:
 
1. The mass media delivers the message to the opinion leader.
 
2. The opinion leader delivers the message to the group.
You must specifically target opinion leaders, use them in your marketing 
communication, and refer consumers to them. In other cases, you can use 
buzz marketing by enlisting or even creating opinion leaders to spread the 
word about your brand.
As a marketer or business owner in need of a strong group influence, you 
must figure out how to reach opinion leaders. In order to find an opinion 
leader in a group, look for the top influencer — the person that everyone 
knows. This person may have written articles or books or may have spoken 
or held training sessions and seminars. You can find this information by con-
ducting your own marketing research on the targeted group. The answer may 
even be as close as a search on the Internet. (Refer to Chapter 12 for more 
information on market research.)
 
When you’ve found the opinion leader, it’s time to reach out. But I caution you: 
Reach out to this person tactfully and professionally. The majority of the time, 
opinion leaders — especially those of large groups — are bombarded with 
companies trying to sell products, so make sure you reach out and just have a 
conversation to see if in some way your product can benefit the group. If so, 
then you can take the next step forward, but don’t do so without permission — 
if you do, you could start a negative word-of-mouth marketing campaign that 
you wish you hadn’t.

I
n this chapter, I focus on consumer misbehavior, which is behavior that 
violates laws and generally accepted norms of conduct in today’s society. 
It’s important to be familiar with consumer misbehavior because it disrupts 
the flow of consumption activities. And this disrupted flow can cause loss 
to your business by the way of time and money. This loss can be caused by 
theft or by distractions or disturbances that chase consumers away.
Consumer misbehavior is a big problem nowadays. More than $13 billion 
worth of merchandise is shoplifted from retailers each year. And more than 
10 million people have been caught shoplifting in the last five years. The 
software industry alone loses billions of dollars annually due to pirating of 
licensed material, both software and entertainment media. Identity theft has 
become a huge problem as well. More than 15 million individuals were vic-
tims of identity theft in 2006 alone. Even though lawmakers have begun to 
combat the problem with laws created to protect individuals from identity 
theft, it hasn’t slowed this category of consumer misbehavior. In fact, it’s 
growing annually. I share these alarming statistics with you in order to put 
consumer misbehavior in perspective and so you can see the importance of 
marketing your intolerance of consumer misbehavior.
Understanding the motives behind consumer misbehavior can be difficult. This 
chapter is designed to help. In it, I explain the different types of misbehavior 
and discuss the common motives that cause those behaviors. I also discuss 
how the morals and beliefs of consumers influence the choice of whether to 
engage in consumer misbehavior. Finally, I show you how you can adapt your 
marketing strategy to aid in minimizing the occurrence and effects of consumer 
misbehavior — at least, as far as they affect your business.

Discovering What Consumer 
Misbehavior Is All About
Consumer behavior is all about value; the ironic thing is that consumer mis-
behavior is also based on value. The difference is the way that consumers 
attempt to obtain that value: morally or immorally.
For instance, consumers who shoplift or keep excess change that’s acciden-
tally given to them, think they’re receiving value. (They’re getting something 
for nothing after all!) Consumers who purchase items with bad checks also 
feel they’re getting value. The truth is that other consumers suffer because of 
these consumers who are exhibiting misbehavior in exchange for what they 
consider value. Consumers who break societal norms and laws usually have 
no remorse for how it affects other consumers.
Some folks consider consumer misbehavior to be a division of human devi-
ance, which is behavior that’s considered unacceptable and not in line with 
accepted social standards. This classification is often due to the fact that 
human deviance has a long history of research behind it and consumer mis-
behavior has only begun to be recognized, making the research on this topic 
difficult to find. You’ll notice that throughout this chapter, the topics that I 
discuss are similar to the topics studied in sociology and human deviance 
research.
Recognizing the difference between 
misbehavior and problem behavior
To get a complete grasp on consumer misbehavior, it’s important to note 
that misbehavior isn’t the same as problem behavior. Misbehavior describes 
behavior deliberately harmful to another party in the consumption process; 
problem behavior refers to behaviors that are outside of the consumer’s 
control. Even though the line of misbehavior and problem behavior can be 
blurred, the deciding line has to do with the issue of self-control.
 
This difference is important to recognize because if it’s a problem outside of 
the consumer’s control, there isn’t much you can do to prevent it. These are 
problems that individuals would like to stop, but they find difficult to do so. 
Examples include drug addiction, compulsive shopping, and alcohol prob-
lems. You can’t do much to detour these situations; it takes professional help 
to intervene. However, you can take some preventive measures to stop the 
misbehavior — or at least lessen the effect it has on your business.

Understanding the common forms 
of misbehavior and their effects
 
Consumer misbehavior disrupts the consumption process. In order for the 
process to occur in an orderly fashion, the expectations of the consumers, 
marketers, business owners, and other consumers must coincide with one 
another. If they don’t, conflicts can occur between the parties involved. These 
conflicts can often cause frustration and sometimes even the loss of a sale.
For example, when you go shopping the day after Christmas, you expect 
to wait in line to make your purchases. You hope that your wait won’t be 
a lengthy one and that management does all it can to ensure that the wait 
isn’t long. Management expects customers to conduct themselves in an 
orderly fashion, keep their places in line, and wait their turns to check out. 
Customers expect the same from each other. When you see consumers 
become disruptive and abusive by cutting in line or exhibiting rude behav-
ior, it makes you feel uncomfortable — the nice, tidy process is disrupted. 
Similarly, the process is disrupted by shoplifters and consumers that write 
bad checks, because these behaviors increase your costs.
Some of the most common acts of consumer misbehavior include the ones I 
explain in the following sections.

186
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
Shoplifting
Shoplifting is officially understood to be theft of goods from a brick-and-
mortar store. Thousands of dollars are lost daily from the act of shoplifting. 
This misbehavior affects all consumers because it increases the prices to 
cover store losses.
Computer fraud
Computer fraud refers to any activity conducted illegally by using a computer 
and Internet technology. Here are some of the main forms of computer fraud:
 
✓ Identity theft: This is the theft of another person’s name and private 
information by another individual for the sole purpose of stealing their 
identity to open credit card accounts or other financial accounts. The 
increased reliance on the Internet and technology has contributed to the 
rapid spread of identity theft. This type of fraud costs businesses thou-
sands of dollars. Businesses also suffer because of liability suits, fines, 
and the loss of clientele that occurs when their security is breached.
 
✓ Illegal downloading of electronic material: Improvements in technolo-
gies have enhanced the ability for consumers to participate in the shar-
ing of illegal software, video games, and music. Consumers often can 
illicitly download electronic material from a number of sources, such 
as peer-to-peer networks. Consumers have been provided with alterna-
tives to purchase immediate downloads, but they still continue to share 
music and software in illicit and illegal ways.
 
 This misbehavior costs businesses thousands of dollars in theft. They 
not only lose money from the direct sale of the product, but they also 
lose money from the product being passed on from consumer to con-
sumer for free. This sharing obviously decreases the demand for the 
purchase of the product.
 
✓ Computer hacking and virus spreading: Literally thousands of com-
puter viruses are circulated from computer to computer. Unfortunately, 
viruses range from being mildly annoying to devastating for individuals 
and businesses. Hacking and virus spreading are devastating because 
they affect critical daily business functions, thereby drastically affecting 
the business’s bottom line.
Consumer fraud
Consumer fraud is a deceptive practice or scam that results in financial loss 
for innocent consumers. Examples of consumer fraud include fraudulently 
obtaining credit cards, opening fraudulent bank accounts, using someone’s 
identity, and submitting bogus insurance claims. It’s extremely difficult to 
estimate exactly how much consumer fraud ends up costing innocent con-
sumers. The price of this misbehavior is the price of trust for consumers. 

187
 Chapter 11: Defying Legislated or Moral Laws: Consumer Misbehavior
Consumer fraud has made consumers cautious and leery to make purchases 
over the Internet or sometimes even over the telephone.
Hostile behavior
Some consumers become so incredibly upset when they don’t get their way 
that they become obnoxious and belligerent. When you encounter rude or 
aggressive consumers, they’re usually abusive. They may be
 
✓ Verbally or physically abusive
 
✓ Uncooperative
 
✓ Drunk
 
✓ The type of customer who breaks company policy with no regard to how 
it may affect others
Abusive behavior often has a negative effect on employees. It affects their 
self-esteem and morale. It can do the same to other consumers. For example, 
if an individual comes into your store upset about a specific situation and 
they’re loud and belligerent around other consumers, those consumers may 
feel uncomfortable and leave without purchasing. In fact, those consumers 
may not return because of the emotional impact it has had on them.
Alteration and destruction of marketing materials
I’ve seen an increase in what’s called culture jamming, an attempt by individu-
als to disrupt advertisements and marketing campaigns by altering messages 
put out by marketers. Defacement of billboards is one example. The deface-
ment changes the message and delivers it in a way that’s different than it was 
intended. This can cause negative reactions by consumers, especially if the 
defacement is vulgar, if it offends consumers’ cultural beliefs and heritage, or 
if the changed message attacks specific groups of consumers. This can cause 
consumers to be turned off by your message and not purchase from you, 
even though you had nothing to do with it.
Unfounded complaints
Consumers complain about products and services even when there isn’t a 
problem. You can do everything imaginable to meet their needs and they still 
complain. This has an obvious effect on other consumers; when they hear 
negative word-of-mouth marketing from consumers that spew unfounded 
complaints, they may be inclined to not purchase from you because they may 
believe those complaints.
Product misuse
Consumers often try to use products in ways they weren’t meant to be used, 
and when the use doesn’t work out you have a situation on your hands. 

188
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
Consumers become injured and sometimes die due to misuse. These injuries 
can be costly to the economy and the companies that produce the products.
The motivation behind the misuse of products is simply not as cut and dried 
as it is with other misbehaviors. It can be the result of ignorance, ego, thrill, 
or just plain deviance.
Compulsive buying or shopping
Compulsive buying can be defined as chronic and repetitive purchasing 
behaviors that are often the result of negative events or feelings. Consumers 
use the act of buying to rid themselves of the feelings associated with nega-
tive events. A compulsive buyer usually suffers from low self-esteem and 
feelings of inadequacy. He may suffer from obsessive-compulsive tendencies, 
fantasy-seeking motivations, and materialism. The sad fact about compulsive 
buying is that the individual experiences the same feelings before and after 
purchases are made. The results of compulsive buying include high levels of 
debt, domestic problems, and feelings of frustration. Compulsive buying is 
truly a vicious circle.
Compulsive shopping is a manifestation of compulsive consumption that is 
related to compulsive buying, but it isn’t the same thing. When it comes
to compulsive shopping, consumers are more drawn to the function of 
shopping — anything that will provide them with a mental high or escape in 
regard to the hunt. They frequently shop four to seven days per week and 
they often think about shopping nearly nine hours per day. They will typically 
spend two or more hours shopping during each trip. Compulsive shopping is 
not only a problem for women consumers, but recent studies also show that 
it affects men.
 
Regardless of whether a consumer is a compulsive buyer or shopper, the 
effect of the misbehavior is the same: He will likely face buyer’s remorse on a 
regular basis. When this happens he usually will bring the product back to the 
store. The problem with this is that there are times when you can’t resell the 
product or you must mark it down and take a significant loss due to the prod-
uct being opened. This can end up costing you a lot of money. These two 
behaviors are the reasons that many stores set very strict return policies.
Seeing how marketing efforts 
can derail misbehavior
If you take the time to understand the motivations behind consumer mis-
behavior, you still may not be able to avoid all the misbehaviors that affect 
your business. However, you can avoid some. Most of the time, misbehaviors 
aren’t personal; usually they’re internal issues that consumers deal with. At 
times, these issues come with no explanation.

189
 Chapter 11: Defying Legislated or Moral Laws: Consumer Misbehavior
 
Use the information and knowledge that you’ve gained from studying your 
consumers to better understand and deter their misbehaviors. Just as you 
market great prices and products, you must market the fact that you won’t tol-
erate misbehavior. Do so by applying deterrents such as signs and policies. If 
you don’t have a no-tolerance policy that’s public, some consumers may think 
that misbehavior won’t be punished.
For example, if you want to deter shoplifting, you not only have to be aware 
of the signs of a shoplifter, but you must show that you have a no-tolerance 
shoplifting policy. You show off your policy by having security cameras and 
signs within your store that state you won’t tolerate shoplifting. If you own a 
large store, you may even want to consider a security guard.
Just as you can classify behavior into areas of consumer misbehavior or prob-
lem behavior, you can do the same by categorizing them into immoral and ille-
gal categories. Behaviors that are considered immoral — but not illegal — limit 
the action that you can take against the individual involved. It’s important to 
understand the differences between these categories, because the knowledge 
can help guide your response when encountering such behaviors.
For example, shoplifting is considered illegal and almost always considered 
immoral. Speeding, on the other hand, is illegal, but it’s often considered 
an acceptable behavior. Keeping excess change that a retail employee has 
mistakenly given you isn’t illegal but is viewed as immoral. As you can see, 
consumer misbehavior can be illegal and immoral (or one or the other), but 
it can also be viewed differently by individuals and society.
Many behaviors can be considered misbehaviors, but it’s important to real-
ize that what one person or culture views as a misbehavior may be seen as 
perfectly fine to other individuals or cultures. The term can be somewhat 
subjective based on your own moral standards and what society consid-
ers acceptable conduct. Behaviors are often cautiously classified because 
opinions regarding what’s acceptable or normal depend on individual ethical 
beliefs and ideologies. Keep this in mind as you handle certain behaviors, 
because while you may not see a behavior as appropriate, it could be very 
normal to the person that was involved in the behavior.
Examining the Tale behind the Act
It’s difficult to avoid consumer misbehavior altogether, but you can be aware 
of it and know it when you see it. Each misbehavior reflects specific signs and 
activities that you can watch for. Consumers also conduct misbehavior due 
to internal reasons, and that’s what I take a look at in this section.

190
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
Why do they do it? Considering 
the underlying motivations
There are many motivating factors behind consumer misbehavior, and the 
fact is that a consumer can be motivated by more than one reason.
 
Understanding the motivation doesn’t necessarily make the misbehavior 
easier to handle or avoid, but it does provide you with the knowledge that 
helps to make sense of the behavior. This knowledge, in turn, helps you to be 
aware and take preventive measures to avoid the misbehavior when possible.
In the following sections, I discuss several common motives to give you an 
understanding of the reasons behind the actions.
Unfulfilled aspirations
Unfulfilled aspirations are often the influence behind consumer misbehavior. 
Consumers experience anomie, which is the state that occurs when a discon-
nect exists between cultural goals and norms and the capacity of society 
members to act within the norms to achieve those goals.
Consider, for example, the emphasis that the United States puts on attaining 
material possessions and getting ahead in life. You could argue that not all 
society members have the necessary tools, skills, and resources to get ahead 
and enjoy the things that we as a society deem as important. As a result, 
these consumers turn to deviance in order to achieve what society sees as 
important and teaches them that they should enjoy. They might write bad 
checks or shoplift to get what they want. They believe that it’s the only way 
to acquire the products they desire.
 
Anomie doesn’t mean that all consumers turn to illegal acts when they feel 
deprived, but it does help to explain some of the misbehavior exhibited by 
consumers.
Thrill seeking
Even though it seems absurd, some consumers misbehave just for the simple 
thrill of the action. For example, some consumers may shoplift items even 
though they don’t need or want them. They do it just for the excitement. Yes, 
that’s right. Individuals may steal for the excitement associated with the activ-
ity. Typically, most of the individuals that consider thrill seeking a motivation 
are adolescents. They’re especially susceptible to the influence that gives them 
a level of excitement in performing this behavior.
Emotions and feelings play a large role in shoplifting as well. The fear of being 
caught plays an important role in the ability to predict shoplifting inten-
tions. There are often signs you can watch for in the actions of a shoplifter. 
She often will watch you, at first, more than you watch her. She also will be 

191
 Chapter 11: Defying Legislated or Moral Laws: Consumer Misbehavior
obscure and even have a difficult time looking you in the eye or carrying on 
a conversation. These actions are especially true of first-time shoplifters, 
though seasoned shoplifters may display them as well. The truth is that shop-
lifting intentions — especially among young consumers — are more heavily 
influenced by emotions than moral beliefs. The opposite is true for older indi-
viduals, however. It’s also not uncommon for shoplifters to be acting from 
repressed feelings of stress and anger.
Lack of learned moral constraints
Some consumers simply don’t have a set of moral beliefs or even a con-
science that keeps them from performing immoral acts. They’re so disillu-
sioned that they see no problem at all with their misbehavior. This is often 
true for younger individuals who haven’t been taught anything different than 
to live by doing what feels good to them with no regard to moral beliefs, laws, 
or concern for others.
Differential association
Differential association is the explanation of why groups of people replace 
one set of acceptable norms with another set that only a few others view 
as acceptable. By acting in opposition to the prevailing acceptable stan-
dards, group members can forge their own identities, and by doing so they 
strengthen their own sense of group unity. When differential association 
serves as the motivation behind consumer misbehavior, the consumer can 
view the deviate behavior as a way to belong to a specific group.
An example of differential association is gang members who often accept 
behaviors and ideals that other members of society would find unacceptable. 
Adolescents also often use this motivation. They steal to show off and gain 
acceptance into a particular group. They see shoplifting as a way to fit in, 
because the group they’re involved with may see it as funny or cool.
Pathological socialization
Pathological socialization refers to consumers that deviate from those in own-
ership or control as way of “getting back” at their success. These consumers 
have a desire to harm you as a service provider or company. This motivation 
occurs when a consumer sees misbehavior as way to get revenge against big 
companies. The sheer size of major companies sometimes produces feelings 
of resentment, and so some consumers view the misbehavior as a method to 
get back at big businesses.
An example of this motivation is when consumers justify shoplifting as a way 
of getting back at a bigger company, because they see the loss as being insig-
nificant. They believe that the company can absorb the loss. These consum-
ers are less likely to perform the misbehavior against a small, local company, 
because they feel it would in fact hurt the local company more so than the 
larger corporation.

192
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
Situational factors
Factors like retail crowding, flight delays, excessive heat, or noise can all 
contribute to consumer misbehavior. These types of situational factors play 
important roles in guiding consumer behavior. For example, normally well-
mannered, quiet people may lose their cool after having to wait in line for 20 
minutes at a retail store. They may end up taking out their frustrations on the 
employees.
The best way to understand this motivation is to remember that although the 
behavior is deemed unacceptable, it’s also seemingly beyond the control of 
the consumer as well.
Another situational factor example would be the consumer who’s tempted 
because retailers present merchandise in an enticing way, and the consumer 
is then willing to steal to obtain the merchandise.
Opportunism
Misbehavior can be the outcome of a deliberate, rational decision-making 
process that weighs the risk and rewards of the behaviors. Consumers may 
simply believe that the rewards associated with the behavior outweigh the 
risks or consequences. Opportunism focuses specifically on self-interest 
when weighed against all other consequences.
 
Consumers often believe that only a small portion of offenders actually get 
caught, so they feel safe performing the act (which is most often shoplifting). 
They strike when stores are busy and crowded so they won’t be noticed.
Research reveals that how consumers view illegal downloading depends on 
the motivation behind the consumer. Motivation is primarily based on utili-
tarian value, or for personal gain. When a consumer views the motivation as 
morally ethical, justified, or socially acceptable, they find the behavior easier 
to be a part of than if the behavior was occurring just for fun.
When consumers make unfounded complaints, for the sole purpose of mon-
etary gain, it’s often because they’re looking for discounts or perhaps free 
products as a resolution to their complaints. This is also a way for them to 
evade personal responsibility for the misuse of the product you sold them.
Compulsion
Compulsive consumptions aren’t the same as addictive consumptions. 
Addictive consumption has to do more with physiological dependency, 
whereas compulsive consumption refers more to repetitive and excessive 
behavior that’s performed in order to avoid internal anxiety.
An individual who’s addicted to a product physically needs that product or 
the body will suffer from withdrawal effects. When an individual has a com-

193
 Chapter 11: Defying Legislated or Moral Laws: Consumer Misbehavior
pulsive need, it’s more psychological. However, keep in mind that a compul-
sive need can be just as controlling as an addictive need. So both addiction 
and compulsion can be problematic to consumers. When you recognize the 
differences in individuals, you can better understand the reasoning behind 
the behavior and possibly assist them in getting the help that they need.
The decision-making process 
that leads to misbehavior
Consumer behavior is guided by ethical decision making. In other words, 
consumers are influenced by their moral beliefs and how they evaluate those 
beliefs. This influence guides them in the decision-making process. When you 
understand the components of moral beliefs, you have a better chance of 
marketing your intolerance of misbehaviors in a way that can appeal to 
consumers’ morals. A consumer’s moral beliefs contain three components:
 
✓ Fairness: An individual’s moral equity represents beliefs regarding an 
act’s fairness or justness. For example, he may ask, “Is it fair that I write 
this check even though I know the money isn’t in the bank and the store 
will never collect?”
 
✓ Contractualism: Contractualism deals with the beliefs an individual has 
regarding the violation of written or unwritten laws. He may ask, “Does 
my action break a law? Does it violate an unwritten promise of how I 
should act? Is writing this check really illegal?”
 
✓ Relativism: Relativism is representative of beliefs about the social 
acceptability of an action. For example, an individual may wonder, “Is 
writing a bad check acceptable in this culture? Does it matter to me if 
the action is socially acceptable or not?”
 
As consumers consider each of the alternative courses they can take in their 
actions, they bounce the decisions against their moral beliefs. Then they go 
through a two-step evaluation process. Just like understanding the decision-
making process and being able to use that in your marketing strategy, you can 
do the same when it comes to misbehavior and how a consumer acts. The 
idea is to be able to recognize these phases in order to deter the consumer 
from the activity. Here’s the process:
 
1. Go through the deontological evaluation.
 
 This evaluation focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of a 
consumer’s anticipated action. It focuses on how he will accomplish his 
goal. The anticipation of “how” he’ll accomplish a goal is actually more 
important than achieving the goal.

194
Part III: Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings 
 
2. Proceed through the teleological evaluation.
 
 This evaluation focuses on the consequences of the behavior and the 
individual’s assessment of those consequences. In this phase, the con-
sumer considers four major issues:
 
 What are the perceived consequences of the action for those 
involved?
 
 What’s the probability that the consequences will occur?
 
 What’s the desirability of the consequences of those involved?
 
 Are the people involved important to me?
Here’s an example showing a consumer proceeding through the process: 
Suppose an individual is considering shoplifting in your store. You realize 
that in the first step he has evaluated whether the act is right or wrong. He 
then enters into the second step in order to decide whether to proceed with 
the misbehavior or to walk away from the situation. If you have signs within 
your store that remind him that the misbehavior is wrong and that punish-
ment will follow the behavior, he may be encouraged to forgo the shoplifting.
Minimizing Consumer Misbehavior
Everyone is affected by consumer misbehavior. In order to protect your regu-
lar customers, it’s your job to be aware of the misbehaviors and do what you 
can to deter and avoid them when possible. This section offers some tips for 
minimizing misbehavior:
Exercising an ounce of prevention
Stay in tune with the consumers that enter your store. Recognize the warn-
ings signs of misbehavior and apply strategies and techniques that deter that 
behavior.
For example, shoplifters often come in with large bags or oversized coats in 
order to hide the merchandise they’re lifting. They also may work in pairs. 
One person distracts store personnel while the other lifts the merchandise.
 
Use strategies that deter shoplifting. Set up cameras in the building, post signs 
informing consumers of the prosecution of shoplifters, require receipts for 
merchandise returns where the customer wants cash, and encourage employ-
ees to check consumers’ parcels when they enter your store. You want con-
sumers to know that you’re watching them, but you must check on them in a 
way that doesn’t make your behaving consumers feel uncomfortable.

195
 Chapter 11: Defying Legislated or Moral Laws: Consumer Misbehavior
Setting up policies and consequences
If consumers can continually get away with misbehaviors at your store, they 
will continue to visit and misbehave — your business becomes a delinquent’s 
buffet. Instead, be sure to have consequences in place for when misbehavior 
occurs.
For example, if you have a consumer who continually writes bad checks, it’s 
time to stop taking those checks. Make sure that other personnel are aware 
that you won’t accept checks from that specific consumer. Employ services 
that provide you with information on bad-check writers so you have the right 
to refuse a check from a habitual bad-check writer. Also avoid taking checks 
without first seeing photo identification. You can even consider not taking 
low-numbered checks from consumers you aren’t familiar with. And be sure 
to post notification that you prosecute those who write bad checks.
 
Similarly, set up policies and consequences to take control of abusive con-
sumer behavior. Make sure that customers know you won’t tolerate abuse. If 
a customer is reeling out of control, using obscene language, or threatening 
employees or other customers, ask her to leave. If the customer won’t leave, 
call the police and have her escorted out. Tell the customer she’s no longer 
welcome in your store.

onsumers all have different tastes and ideas as to what’s important in 
their lives. And they have different abilities to pay a particular price for 
what they want. So the days of relying on your gut instincts and intuition are

tance of market research and the knowledge you gain from using it, but I also 
explain how to conduct market research. I show you the different methods of 
market research and the benefits and difficulties surrounding each method.
Recognizing the Vital Role 
of Market Research
In this day and age, most businesses can’t afford to take chances on ideas 
without getting more information about what consumers want and what 
they’re willing to pay to get it. Market research can provide you with that 
information. Market research is the systematic collection, recording, analyz-
ing, and distributing of marketing data.

200
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
Market research consists of a plan that charts how data is to be collected and 
analyzed so the results are useful and relevant for making marketing decisions. 
The research helps you create marketing campaigns that are sturdy and effec-
tive. When you use research to develop your marketing campaigns, they’ll be 
more effective because they’ll be viewed more favorably by consumers 
(because you’ve done your homework first). Market research serves as the 
foundation of all areas of marketing, so all decisions should be supported by 
some level of research.
Examining the purpose of market research
Regardless of the industry that you’re in, market research provides the infor-
mation that you need to make sound business decisions. Market research 
plays the following three functional roles for every business:
 
✓ Provides a picture of what’s occurring: This is the descriptive function. 
It involves gathering and presenting statements of fact. In particular, 
good market research will inform you of
 
• The preferences of your consumer
 
• Information regarding your competition and what it’s doing
 
✓ Enables you to figure out the reasons behind what’s occurring: This is 
the diagnostic function. It involves taking the descriptive information and 
explaining the data so that it makes sense and is clear.
 
✓ Helps you identify what’s likely to occur in the future: This is the pre-
dictive function. It involves the implementation of what your research 
has shown you. Market research encompasses all methods of gathering 
information to determine which markets have the best potential.
 
When research is done well, it offers you alternative choices. For example, 
good research might suggest multiple options for introducing new products 
or entering new markets. You use the information gained to determine which 
products and services to offer and which products would be profitable to 
introduce into your market. Good research also does the following:
 
✓ Determines whether you’ve been able to satisfy customer needs and 
whether any changes need to be made to packaging, delivery, or the 
product itself
 
✓ Allows you to formulate a valuable and effective marketing plan and 
measure the success of that plan

201
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
Understanding how market research 
affects your marketing success
As I explain in the preceding section, market research is your key to market-
ing success. Specifically, market research
 
✓ Reduces your chances of making costly mistakes in marketing, stra-
tegic planning, and even product design: When you conduct market 
research, you gain a deeper grasp of what your target market is looking 
for. Then you can create a marketing message that pertains and appeals 
to that market.
 
✓ Makes maintaining your customer base easier: Gaining and maintain-
ing consumers takes a lot of money, so understanding what makes some 
loyal and others not can contribute to the success of your business. 
When you ask questions, you increase your knowledge of your current 
customers. You gather that information to help in the development of 
loyalty programs that will actually work with your current customer 
base.
 
✓ Uncovers gaps in services or product capabilities, which leads to new 
business ideas: Market research allows you to ask consumers what 
they’re looking for, enabling you to discover current gaps that consumers 
feel — even if you don’t see them. Discovering these gaps puts you 
ahead of the competition because you’re better able to serve the needs 
of consumers.
 
✓ Helps you anticipate changes in the marketplace: You can anticipate 
changes in the marketplace by conducting market research that gauges 
trends in the general population of your customer base. Gauging trends 
allows you to prepare for change and make any modifications necessary 
to keep your product viable in the marketplace.
 
✓ Helps you assess whether your business is delivering on its promises: 
You can use market research to effectively measure the satisfaction of 
your customers and determine whether they’re happy with the products 
and services you’re providing them.
 
✓ Determines whether your advertising is effective: You can use 
research to determine whether your advertising messages are attracting 
your target market to purchase your products. If not, the research will 
provide you with the information that you need in order to change the 
message and make it more effective.

Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
Using market research to your 
marketing advantage
 
Market research is the core of a great marketing strategy. You wouldn’t take 
off on a cross-country trip without a road map, so why would you spend hun-
dreds or even thousands of dollars on marketing without the tool that guides 
you in creating a successful marketing strategy? Market research brings to 
light the unknowns about the consumers you’re trying to market to. You can 
use your marketing research to do the following:
 
✓ Identify newly emerging trends in economic, social, and competi-
tive environments and alter your marketing mix to fit them. Market 
research enables you to gauge the needs of the consumers you’re 
marketing to, which in turn allows you to target your message with the 
correct marketing vehicle. Sometimes consumers aren’t vocal in their 
needs, but market research will help open them up.
 
✓ Develop a long-run marketing strategy. Research helps you create 
longer campaigns in order to get your message in front of your consum-
ers multiple times. It has been proven that a consumer must see your 
message seven to eight times before deciding to make the purchase.
 
✓ Identify external threats and opportunities. Market research can 
inform you of competitors or other products that may prove to be a 
threat to the sale or acceptance of your own products.
 
✓ Compare the potential of diverse markets. You can use market 
research to evaluate opportunities that you may have in other markets.
 
✓ Select target markets. Market research provides you with the informa-
tion to help select the group you will target.
 
✓ Establish realistic missions and goals. You can use market research to 
set financial and forecasting goals for your product.
 
✓ Formulate and implement goal-oriented strategic plans. Market 
research gives you the information you need to create a road map that 
helps formulate a marketing strategy that’s successful in meeting the 
goals that you set.
 
✓ Control market performance. Market research helps you create market-
ing plans that provide you with predictions of how they should perform.
 
✓ Identify and define marketing opportunities and problems. You can 
use the knowledge that you gain from market research to help define 
where you should market and also to identify problems you may 
encounter when marketing there.
 
✓ Generate, refine, evaluate, and monitor your marketing efforts. 
Research helps you create a marketing plan that takes everything into 
account, allowing you to make the best of all your marketing efforts.

203
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
 
✓ Improve your understanding of the marketing process as it pertains to 
your consumers. You can use market research to understand the ways 
that your consumers think and the reasons they purchase specific prod-
ucts. Then you use this information in your marketing strategy.
 
✓ Find where your products are most likely to sell. Market research 
can show you the behavior of consumers, including where they make 
purchases.
 
✓ Identify market segments and niches. It’s important to identify seg-
ments that you can market to in order to create pertinent messages that 
appeal and entice consumers; market research can help.
 
✓ Determine who your competitors are. With market research, you can ask 
consumers about competitors of your products. Doing so helps identify 
competitors and gain information on why consumers purchase from them.
 
✓ Discover how to overcome barriers to market entry. Market research 
allows you to gauge product apprehension from consumers. This 
enables you to create a plan to overcome those barriers that may hurt 
the sale of your product.
 
✓ Establish fair market pricing for your products. You can use market 
research to help gauge the market value of your product to consumers. 
Doing so ensures that you don’t overprice or underprice your product.
 
Market research doesn’t have to be elaborate to be effective. It can actually be 
quite simple and still provide you with usable and valuable information. Later 
in this chapter, I discuss the different methods of research and how to deter-
mine which ones fit your needs.
Getting an Overview of 
the Research Process
Market research can sometimes seem daunting to marketers, but the key is 
to work through the steps of the process. Following the steps enables you to 
be clear about the information you’re looking for. Here’s how to make your 
way through the research process:
 
1. Define the problem.
 
 You never want to conduct research on things that you would like to 
know. Instead, make sure you’re conducting research for the things 
you need to know. Use the earlier section “Understanding how market 
research affects your marketing success” to identify what it is that you 
want to gain from your market research. Identify the problem and make 
that the core focus of your research.

204
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
2. Determine the research design.
 
 In this step, you identify what data you will collect and analyze to solve 
the problem. First you determine the information that you’re seeking 
(whatever kind best supports your objective). Then you choose your data 
collection approach. You have two main options when collecting data:
 
• Acquire third-party research, which comes from companies that 
specialize in market research. They sell this research data for a 
price.
 
• Conduct new research (either conduct it yourself or outsource the 
research to a market research firm).
 
3. Gather third-party data if you’re using it.
 
 Third-party data may not be specific to the group you’re targeting, but 
you still can glean information from it that’s helpful in guiding you in 
your marketing strategy. The best part is that this type of research 
comes at a lower cost than primary research. Later in this chapter, I 
show you where to find the data and how to evaluate whether it meets 
your needs.
 
4. Create a plan for original research if you’re doing it.
 
 This step is the most intensive. In it, you do the following:
 
• Determine your methods of collecting data. Will you interview 
various individuals? Will you observe behaviors without direct 
interaction with the individuals?
 
• Design data collection forms and questionnaires. You want 
your forms and questionnaires to ask for the information that will 
provide you with the data that will help solve the problem you 
identified in the first step of the process. A questionnaire only has 
validity when the questions asked measure what was intended to 
be measured. Your data collection forms and questionnaires also 
must be properly written, formatted, and administered in order for 
them to be valid and reliable.
 
5. Determine sample plan and size.
 
 A sample plan identifies how you’ll conduct your market research, what 
questionnaires or forms you’ll use, and what you’ll do with the analysis. 
A sample size is the number of people you need to interview in order to 
get the results that reflect the target population as precisely as needed 
for an accurate sampling.
 
6. Collect the data.
 
 All you’re doing in this step is implementing the plan, which you don’t 
need me to tell you how to do — hence the lack of coverage on this 
topic.

205
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
 
7. Present, interpret, and report the data.
 
 After you’ve collected all your data, it’s time to make sense of it. Before 
you can gain a clear understanding, you must examine the raw data to 
make sure that the information you need in order to conduct an accu-
rate analysis exists as required.
 
 After you have put the data in a form that’s useful, you can begin the 
process of analyzing the data to determine what you’ve discovered. The 
method you use to analyze the data will depend on the approach you 
used to collect the data.
 
 Finally you report your findings. The effort you put into your report will 
depend on whether you need a formal or informal report.
 
The remaining sections in this chapter detail what you need to know about 
each of the preceding steps.
Clarifying the Problem at Hand
The problem you’ve chosen to focus your research on must be translated 
into a market research problem. In other words, you must set up the ques-
tion in a way that can be observed and measured. You do this by formulat-
ing the problem into questions and analyzing what the resulting information 
means. Then you can use this information to determine the method you’ll use 
to collect the data. Doing so allows you to translate the decision problem into 
a research problem. For example, a decision problem may be whether or not 
to launch a new line of products. The corresponding research problem might 
be to assess whether the market would need and accept the product line.
 
To ensure that the true decision problem is addressed, outline possible sce-
narios of the research results, and then formulate plans of action under each 
scenario. The use of such scenarios ensures that the purpose of the research 
is agreed upon before it begins.
Settling on the Research Design
Determining how you’ll design the research you’re about to collect is really 
about selecting the method that works best for you. In order for the research 
to be accurate and efficient and provide you with the information you need, 
your design must reflect the problem you want to define and solve. It must 
also provide the details on how you’ll obtain and gather the information 
that’s needed.

206
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
Classifying the focus of the research
By taking the time to classify what type of research you’re looking for, you’re 
better equipped to make a determination on whether to conduct the research 
yourself or use a research company that has already collected the data. 
Classifying helps in selecting not only how to do the research, but also in 
selecting what method will be most effective.
Market research can be classified in one of the following categories:
 
✓ Exploratory research: This is the classification of research that’s used 
when a problem hasn’t been clearly identified. It helps determine the 
best research design, data collection method, and selection of respon-
dents. Exploratory research classification often relies on secondary 
research (research from an outside source, including research reports 
that are already finished, newspapers, magazines, journal content, and 
government and nongovernment organization statistics.)
 
 Exploratory research allows you to gain a greater understanding of 
something that you don’t know enough about. The design of exploratory 
research is much more flexible and dynamic than the other classes of 
research, because the research you’re doing is more general and not 
necessarily focused on specific statistics.
 
✓ Descriptive research: This class of research is also known as statistical 
research. It’s used to describe the data and characteristics of the popula-
tion that you’re studying. It’s often done in order to identify a problem 
or to study frequencies, averages, and other statistical calculations. You 
often use descriptive research to test a hypothesis and answer ques-
tions concerning the current status of the respondents involved in the 
research. It won’t gather the causes behind your situation, however.
 
 In order to obtain the most useful and accurate results possible, descrip-
tive research must comply with strict research requirements. In other 
words, you need to figure out who you’re gathering your data from and 
where those subjects are located. In order for the results to be accurate, 
you must use the same sampling. For example, if you’re trying to test 
pricing of your product, your sampling needs to be aligned with who 
you would be selling your product to. After all, what a consumer may 
pay for your product on the West Coast isn’t necessarily what she’d pay 
on the East Coast. So, because the variables are too different to provide 
you with accurate results, you don’t want to do market research using 
the East Coast price if you’re selling on the West Coast.
 
 You can use two basic types of descriptive research:
 
• Longitudinal studies: These studies make repeated measurements 
of the same subjects. They allow you to measure and monitor 
behaviors such as brand switching. Longitudinal studies are 

207
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
somewhat difficult to conduct, because they require your subjects 
to make a time commitment. This commitment is often a deterrent 
to participation.
 
• Cross-sectional studies: These studies focus on a sampling of the 
population to make measurements at specific points in time. A 
special type of cross-sectional study is called cohort analysis; this 
analysis tracks a collection of individuals who experience the same 
event within the same time frame. This analysis is useful for long-
term forecasting of product demand.
 
✓ Causal research: This classification explores the effect of one thing on 
another — more specifically the effect of one variable on another. You 
can use this class of research to measure the impact a specific change 
will have on existing norms. It allows you to predict hypothetical sce-
narios, and it’s designed to identify a cause-and-effect relationship.
These classifications are made according to the objective of the research. 
For example, it’s possible that in some cases the research will fall into one of 
these categories, but in other cases different phases of the same project may 
fall into different categories.
Deciding what type of info 
best supports your focus
 
Before you collect data, you need to decide what kind of data you need. Doing 
so will assist in accomplishing the goal you have set to achieve with your 
market research. Information types for market research are divided into quan-
titative and qualitative methods. I break down these methods for you here:
 
✓ Quantitative methods use mathematical analysis, which identifies dif-
ferences that are statistically significant. The sample size used is quite 
large. This method relies less on interviews, observations, question-
naires, focus groups, subjective reports, and case studies, and focuses 
more on the collection and analysis of numeric data and statistics. 
Because it relies on precise measurement and analysis of identified and 
target concepts, it’s the more objective method.
 
 This data is more efficient and allows you to test hypotheses, but you 
unfortunately may miss contextual detail with this method. Because 
this research is presented in the form of numbers and statistics, it’s less 
descriptive. The researcher in this role can remain detached, impartial, 
and objective.
 
✓ Qualitative methods are used to provide a base for quantitative research 
and help in quantitative research design development, because this type 
of research provides more descriptive information that can help you 

208
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
in determining the statistical data that you need. These methods help 
define problems, generate hypotheses, and identify determinants. They 
consist of one-on-one interviews to probe for personal opinion, beliefs, 
and values, and they serve to uncover hidden issues. The sample size 
used for this method is small. Qualitative methods rely less on numeric 
data and statistics and more on interviews, observations, focus groups, 
subjective reports, and case studies. This method is more subjective 
because it depends on the interpretation of the data.
 
 If you use this method, your data will be richer, more time consuming, 
and less able to be generalized. Data is in the form of words, pictures, or 
objects. The researcher in this role is personally involved and may have 
some partiality. He may also portray an empathetic understanding to 
the subject.
Determining the nature of 
your research methods
The nature of research — that is, whether it’s brand new and tailored to 
your audience or current but not specific for your business — falls into two 
categories: primary research and secondary research. Your research could 
involve one or it could involve both; it simply depends on the needs of your 
business. Here’s the lowdown on both types:
 
✓ Primary research involves collecting original data about the prefer-
ences, buying habits, and opinions and attitudes of current or prospec-
tive customers. Primary research can be costly, ranging anywhere from 
$3,000 to millions of dollars. This data can be gathered by using focus 
groups, surveys, and field tests.
 
 Primary research can be done by your business, but it’s also common 
for companies to hire a firm to assist with the research. If you want to 
conduct the research on your own, try using online survey tools; these 
services usually charge you a setup fee plus a one-time fee, but they’re 
well worth the money.
 
✓ Secondary research is data that a company collects indirectly from vari-
ous sources, such as reference books, magazines, newspapers, industry 
publications, chambers of commerce, government agencies, and trade 
associations. Secondary research provides information regarding indus-
try sales and trends as well as growth rates. It also can provide you with 
demographic profiles and regional business statistics.
 
 The unfortunate thing about secondary information is that it isn’t 
uncommon for researchers to find that the information presented as a 
teaser is in fact the only information the research contains. You’ll often 
come across this situation when a sample report is presented at no cost 
but the full report must be purchased. And usually the full report is 
extremely expensive to obtain.

209
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
 
Primary research isn’t conducted as often as secondary research, but it still 
represents a significant part of overall marketing research. Secondary research 
provides you with a good starting place, and it’s obtained at a fraction of the 
cost of primary research. It lays the groundwork and primary research fills in 
the gaps. In fact, some businesses first conduct secondary research, and then 
they fine-tune their findings with primary research methods. The use of both 
types of market research can give you a well-rounded view of the market. This 
balanced view provides even more detailed information that enables you to 
make important business decisions.
You also can use secondary research data to clarify questions you have 
before actually conducting the primary research. For example, if you aren’t 
sure who your competitors are, you can use secondary data to gain that 
information. If you’re using secondary research in order to gain more 
information on conducting your primary research, you may find that your 
question has already been answered. It’s likely that you can find the exact 
information you were looking for, eliminating your need for primary research. 
It’s also possible that secondary research can show you that conducting pri-
mary research may be difficult. How? Secondary research often shows you 
how data was collected, so this information could include discussions of the 
difficulties that were encountered when conducting the research.
Both types of research have their pros and cons. By being familiar with both 
of them, you can make an educated decision on which type of research works 
best for you and your situation. Table 12-1 outlines the advantages and dis-
advantages of both primary and secondary market research. Because sec-
ondary research is often the first method used, I cover it in the next section, 
before delving into the details of conducting primary research.

competitors; rarely gives you 
an information advantage
Obtaining Existing Data
Using existing data is often quicker and less expensive, which is why many 
businesses opt to go this route. You want to get the best data available, so 
it’s important to be equipped with the knowledge you need to do so. You 
need to know where to find the information and how to evaluate whether the 
data is useful to you and your business needs. In this section, I cover both 
of these tasks. By the time you finish this section, you’ll know how to get the 
most use out of secondary data.

211
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
Knowing where to find secondary data
You can obtain secondary research from either internal or external sources. 
The majority of businesses and organizations collect information from their 
day-to-day operations. This information is considered your internal sources of 
secondary market research. This type of research includes sales data, finan-
cial data, transport data, and storage data.
You also can gain secondary research from external sources, such as the 
Internet, government statistics, trade associations and publications, commercial 
market research companies, and national as well as international institutions.
Here are some common sources you can use:
 
✓ The Internet: Many Web sites share product descriptions, summaries of 
services offered, locations, revenue information, and company specifica-
tions. Similarly, digital dossiers provide you with company profiles on 
public corporations, income statements, and balance sheets. You can 
use this information to research how your competitors are doing busi-
ness and how successful their businesses are. You can even find out 
what products are selling best.
 
✓ U.S. and state government sources: You can gain statistical data and 
information from government sources. This type of data will help you 
gauge product sales and determine how your competitors are doing in 
the marketplace. This data often includes the following:
 
• Economic news
 
• Export information
 
• Industry trends
 
• Legislative trends
 
• Market trends
 
• Population demographics
 
• Product specifications
 
 Data collected by U.S. government agencies also can be accessed for 
free (or for a minimal cost), using the Internet. You can use this informa-
tion to conduct your own research, which helps you make determina-
tions about the previous data.
 
✓ Specialized research companies: These companies sell information that 
contains
 
• Business data
 
• Census information
 
• Consumer classification reports

212
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
• Consumer purchase information
 
• Demographic data
 
• Five-year forecasts
 
 Syndication services often make this information available in both print 
and electronic formats.
 
✓ Business publications and trade organizations: Nationwide and state-
wide trade associations often publish secondary research data in 
articles, reports, and books. You can use these publications and organi-
zations to gather existing data.
Evaluating the usefulness and 
accuracy of the data you find
The problem with secondary data is that you don’t control the research, so 
it may not have the information that you’re looking for. Or it could contain 
errors or be unreliable. So, when you use secondary data, it’s important to 
evaluate the information for accuracy and the sources for reliability.
When evaluating secondary data, consider the following questions:
 
✓ Is the data useful in your research study?
 
✓ How current is the data and does it apply to the time period you’re inter-
ested in?
 
✓ Is the data dependable and verified?
 
✓ Is there any bias in the data that can alter the quality of use for your 
research?
 
✓ What were the specifications and the methods used in collecting the 
data? What was the response rate? What was the quality of the analysis 
of the data? What was the sample size and sampling technique? How 
was the questionnaire designed?
 
✓ What was the object of the original data collection?
 
✓ What’s the nature of the data? What was the definition of the variables? 
What units were used to measure the data? What categories were 
used? What relationships between the subjects and variables were 
measured?
 
If, after reviewing the information, you find that the secondary research won’t 
provide you with the answers you need, it may be time to evaluate whether 
primary research is necessary to complete your research. See the following 
section for details.

213
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
Creating a Data Collection Plan 
for Original Research
When acquiring original data, you can either do the research yourself or hire 
someone to do it for you. If you decide on the latter, you have several differ-
ent types of firms you can use to outsource your primary research, and the 
level of services they offer can and do vary. These firms include:
 
✓ Full-service marketing research firms: These firms develop and carry 
out the full research plan for their clients.
 
✓ Partial-service market research firms: This type of firm offers expertise 
that addresses a specific part of the research plan, such as develop-
ing methods to collect data and design surveys. If you’re willing to pay, 
they’ll even go as far as to locate research participants and undertake 
the data analysis.
 
✓ Research tool supplier: This firm provides the tools used by research-
ers, including data collection tools such as surveys, data analysis soft-
ware, and report presentation products.
If you go it alone, be prepared for some hard work — but remember that 
you’re saving big bucks this way. The following sections outline what to do 
and provide guidance to help you along the way.
 
Even if you decide to hire the work out, you still want to be aware of the pro-
cess in order to ensure that you’re getting the information that you need from 
the research. While the company you hire knows market research, only you 
know your business in the way that you do.
Picking your collection methods
Primary research can be collected using two different methods: survey and 
observation. You can use a variety of tools to gather that data. For instance, 
you can gather primary market research by using the following:
 
✓ Case studies
 
✓ Contacts with representatives, buyers and resellers, and end-users
 
✓ Field tests
 
✓ Focus groups
 
✓ Interviews

214
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
Surveying select people
The survey method is a research technique in which information is gathered 
from people through the use of surveys and questionnaires. It’s the most 
frequently used method of collecting primary data. Survey research can be 
conducted in person, by phone, by mail, or over the Internet:
 
✓ Personal interviews can be conducted in focus groups, door-to-door, or 
randomly in central locations. A major advantage when it comes to per-
sonal interviews is they get much better responses than mail, phone, or 
Internet surveys do. However, telephone interviews do serve as a quick 
and relatively inexpensive way to conduct an interview.
 
 Focus groups typically involve 8 to 12 people that are brought together to 
evaluate advertising, a product, a design, or a marketing strategy under 
a skilled moderator.
 
✓ While mailed surveys tend to have a low response rate, a successful 
survey can get a 10 percent response when you offer some type of incen-
tive to complete the survey and return it. Incentives help convince more 
individuals to respond.
 
✓ Internet-based surveys are quick, and they eliminate the need for data 
entry, which is in itself a timesaver. A draw to using the Internet is that 
the surveys are limited to individuals that have access to the Web; how-
ever, this number is growing annually. Another drawback is that people 
dislike receiving uninvited e-mail surveys.
 
When you decide how to collect the information and conduct the survey, you 
then write the questions according to the specific needs of that type of survey. 
You need to carefully construct, format, and administer your questionnaires 
and collection forms because doing so allows you to obtain unbiased data and 
increase your response rate. (See the later section “Crafting and presenting 
questions effectively” for guidance in this task.)
Your administration of a questionnaire must be structured and planned. You 
must select participants in an unbiased way, and you need to explain the sur-
vey’s purpose either in person or on the questionnaire. If you make a mistake 
in the way that the questionnaire is structured or administered, you may 
come up with inaccurate and unreliable results.
Gathering information through observation
The observation method is a research method in which the actions of people 
are watched and recorded either by cameras or by observers. A mystery shop-
per is an effective observation method. A mystery shopper is a researcher 
who poses as a customer or client. The shopper observes the interactions 
between customers and salespeople to evaluate the effectiveness of sales 
staff. The mystery shopper concept is becoming popular among service 
offices such as physician and attorney offices as well.

215
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
One disadvantage to the observation method is that it can’t measure atti-
tudes or motivation. However, this method has two significant advantages:
 
✓ It’s more time efficient than personal interviews.
 
✓ People are unaware they’re being observed, so they act as they normally 
would. This candid behavior provides a clear picture of the interaction 
that takes place.
When using the observation method, you want to watch behaviors and take 
careful notes. For example, be sure to note the following:
 
✓ What are the participants saying and how are they reacting to the prod-
uct or the situation?
 
✓ What type of language are participants using to express themselves, and 
what is their mood?
 
✓ How are the participants thinking and feeling during the process?
 
Sometimes these things are easier to observe in an interview process, so it’s 
best to conduct on-site interviews whenever possible. Interviewing helps to 
put the participant in an environment where he can discuss the preceding 
items, thereby helping you gather additional data that may be needed in the 
research process.
Point of sale research is a form of research that combines natural observa-
tion with personal interviews to get people to explain buying behavior. 
Researchers observe shoppers to decide which ones to choose as research 
subjects. After observation, researchers approach the selected shoppers and 
ask them questions. This method of research provides fresh and accurate 
information from the consumer because the purchase has just been made.
The experimental method is an observation technique in which a researcher 
observes what happens when he changes one or more marketing variables 
while keeping the others constant under controlled conditions. This method 
isn’t used as frequently because of the inaccuracy of the responses and the 
cost of setting up the research conditions.
Crafting and presenting 
questions effectively
The way that you present or word a question can impact the way that it’s 
interpreted by the participant. For this reason, it’s important to make sure that 
you craft your questions so they’re simple and easy to understand. It’s also 
important not to use questions that lead a participant in a specific direction. 

216
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
You want to craft your questions in such a way that if a question doesn’t apply 
to the participants, they can choose not to answer. The following sections list 
some guidelines to help you in crafting your questions correctly.
Selecting your question type carefully
You can choose from a variety of question types. For example, you can use 
any of the following:
 
✓ Open-ended questions: These questions ask respondents to construct 
their own responses. These questions are good for gathering opinions 
from participants and gaining a wider range of knowledge than you 
would when using a question that has fixed answers.
 
✓ Forced-choice questions: These questions make the respondent choose 
answers only from the possibilities presented on the questionnaire. 
Force-choice questions can be used to rate a product or service based 
on a scale.
 
✓ Yes/no questions: This type of question allows the participant to select 
only “yes” or “no” as a response. You only want to use yes/no questions 
when asking for a response on one issue. When you use yes/no ques-
tions that ask about more than one issue, the reliability and validity of 
the answer is decreased. That’s because this type of question doesn’t 
allow for a gray area with the participant. If they’re in the middle on 
whether they would choose “yes” or “no,” they must select one or the 
other, because there’s no in-between answer.
 
✓ Multiple-choice questions: These questions give the respondent several 
choices. When you construct multiple-choice questions, it’s vital that 
you make the options mutually exclusive and comprehensive enough to 
include every possible response.
 
 If you offer the choice of “other,” you increase the reliability of the 
multiple-choice question. Why? Because, participants are able to make a 
selection that isn’t necessarily listed. If the “other” answer isn’t pre-
sented, they will only select one because they have to. Multiple-choice 
questions are great to use when asking about benefits they’re interested 
in or regarding the competitor that they would select when faced with 
the decision.
 
✓ Level-of-agreement questions: These questions make statements and 
ask your subjects for their level of agreement regarding those state-
ments. The commonly used options for these types of questions include 
strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree.
 
 Answers to level-of-agreement questions can vary and cloud results, 
because they aren’t absolute and they’re based on attitudes and emo-
tions rather than on statistical data. These questions are good when 
you’re looking to offer a forced-choice question, such as asking them to 
rate the product or service you’ve provided them.

217
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
 
You need to be careful of the structure you choose for specific questions, 
because the way that you format or structure a question can lead participants 
in how they answer. Each question on your questionnaire must have a specific 
purpose or it shouldn’t be included. The goal of the question is to obtain some 
piece of required information.
Following basic guidelines
Here are some basic guidelines to follow when creating your collection forms 
and questionnaires:
 
✓ Each question must be written so it’s clear and as brief as possible. 
It’s important to choose questions that all participants can understand, 
because misunderstood questions produce unreliable and inaccurate 
results.
 
✓ You want to use a consistent ranking scale for all similar questions. 
Using an inconsistent ranking scale can be confusing to the participant 
and can lead to unreliable and inaccurate results.
 
✓ Always avoid leading questions or introducing biases. If you lead 
a participant to answer in one way or another, you don’t know if she 
selected the answer based on her own viewpoint or if she selected it 
because she was led in that direction.
 
✓ Don’t use questions that make your respondent guess. If your partici-
pants are guessing and not providing you with accurate answers, your 
results will be skewed and may not necessarily represent the true pic-
ture when analyzed.
 
You can use questions to establish rapport with your subjects, especially if 
you’re seeking sensitive information. You position the sensitive questions in 
ways that increase the likelihood of an honest response. Consider the follow-
ing techniques:
 
✓ Place the question in a series of questions that are less personal. This 
technique allows the participant to answer honestly without feeling like 
she’s being personally attacked or judged.
 
✓ State that the behavior or attitude isn’t so unusual. Participants often 
answer in ways that protect their own attitudes or viewpoints. By stating 
that a behavior or attitude isn’t unusual, you make them feel more com-
fortable to provide a true answer, even if they feel that answer is against 
the norms of society.
 
✓ Phrase the question in terms of other people, not your subject. When 
you do this, you help the participants not feel as if they’re being person-
ally interrogated or judged by their answers.

218
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
✓ Provide response choices that specify ranges, not exact numbers. This 
helps the participant to feel as if they’re still maintaining a sense of pri-
vacy. For example, instead of saying “I make $15,000 annually,” it’s easier 
for participants to say “I make between $15,000 and $20,000 annually.” 
It helps them keep a level of anonymity but still provides you with the 
information that you need.
Presenting questions effectively
When formatting your collection forms and questionnaires, be sure to use a 
dark ink on light paper and a font that’s easy for your subjects to read. And 
use good-quality paper stock, which projects to the subjects that your ques-
tionnaire is important. Number the questionnaires in order to keep track of 
them. This way, you know if one has been lost.
 
Positioning and the order of questions can affect response. Here are some 
general suggestions to guide you:
 
✓ Make your forms and questionnaires short enough that your subject 
doesn’t get frustrated or tired while answering. Try to keep your form 
or questionnaire under two pages. Beyond that you begin to lose the 
interest of your participant.
 
✓ Use section headings and numbers on all individual survey sections, 
and number each question. Doing so makes the organization and layout 
of the form or questionnaire easy for your subject to navigate and 
understand.
 
✓ Group questions that pertain to demographics, such as age, gender, 
ethnicity, and education, together at the end of the survey. This orga-
nization is effective because subjects are more likely to answer personal 
questions after completing other questions.
 
✓ Place neutral questions at the beginning of your questionnaire to 
establish rapport and put your subject at ease. These opening ques-
tions should be simple and nonthreatening.
Choosing Your Sampling Group
Determining who you’ll use as your sample group in your market research is 
crucial. If you don’t take the time to identify the target market that will give 
you the answers you’re looking for, you run the risk of introducing bias into 
the results. As a result, your data may be misleading and devalued. In this 
section, I discuss the steps in selecting a sample group and the things you 
should look for and be aware of when making your selection.
Not only do you have to evaluate the sample group in primary research, but 
you also need to evaluate the sample group used in secondary research. 

219
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
Doing so helps you determine whether the research pertains to the target 
market you’re focusing on.
Your sampling group is the pool from which your subjects are chosen — for 
example, from the telephone book, organization member lists, universities, 
or lists of past customers. You could use a telephone book as the sampling 
group from which you choose subjects, but there would be some shortcom-
ings with this pool. Telephone books exclude those subjects who don’t have 
home telephones or who have chosen not to be listed. It’s also important to 
spend time evaluating the size of your sample group, because this too can 
skew research results.
 
No standards exist as to who you should include in your sampling group. And 
your sample size is subjective to your preference, your budget, and the conse-
quences of your findings.
Establishing a sample size
Your sample size depends on your trade, budget, and tolerance for error 
(which I talk about in the following section). Cost is an important factor when 
it comes to determining your sample size. If the ideal sample size and design 
methodology don’t fit your budget, you’ll have to make some trade-off deci-
sions. However, it’s possible that some of the trade-offs may compromise 
the quality and scope of your research. It’s best to select a sample size that 
will provide you with as much accuracy in your results as possible. However, 
remember that even if you do find the need to compromise to stay within 
your budget, it’s better to do so than to do no research at all.
Businesses make important, tactical, and strategic decisions based on 
research data that covers only 100, 50, or even 30 people. Even a small 
sampling of 1 percent can provide you with an accurate representation of a 
particular market. The sample size that you use is determined by the type of 
research you’re doing.
 
Sample size is very subjective and I don’t know the specifics of your market, 
so I can’t tell you how large yours should be. If you need help determining 
your sample size, I’d suggest doing an Internet search for “sample size calcula-
tors.” These calculators help you determine how big your sample size needs 
to be by taking into account specific variables of your market.
Planning ahead for possible 
sampling errors
When choosing your sample group, you need to take into account the pos-
sibility of sampling errors. Sampling errors are due to the fact that data 

220
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
collected is from a part of rather than the whole of the population. There’s 
a trade-off between sample size and cost. The larger the sample size, the 
smaller the sampling error, but the higher the cost. After a certain point, the 
smaller sampling error can’t be justified by the cost.
 
While a larger sample size may reduce sampling error, it actually may increase 
the total error. A larger size sampling may reduce the ability to follow up on 
nonresponses. And even if you have a sufficient number of follow-up inter-
views, a larger number of interviews may result in a less uniform interview 
process, which could increase biases.
Your sample size is subjective based on your own market, the type of 
research you’re doing, and the information you’re trying to gain from that 
research. There are no absolutes — only the very general guidelines I pro-
vide in this section.
Presenting, Interpreting, 
and Reporting Data
The information that you gain from market research can only be used if you 
put it in a format that really represents and interprets the data in a way that’s 
useful to your business practices and operations. Formatting information 
properly allows you to take the information that you’ve collected and view it 
in a way that’s useful to your own business and marketing strategy. Having 
this information in a way that’s easy to understand enables you to make 
smart business decisions and forecast the future of where your business is 
going. It also makes you aware of issues that may need to be fixed or cor-
rected and provides you with information about product changes or innova-
tions that need to take place.
Presenting the data
Descriptive data analysis is used to describe the results you’ve obtained. In 
most cases, the results are merely used to provide a summary of the infor-
mation that has been gathered without making a statement on whether the 
results hold up to a statistical evaluation.
You present quantitative data (data that reflects numerical or statistical 
values) by using visual formats such as charts, tables, or the measurement of 
central tendencies. If you’ve collected qualitative data (data reflecting charac-
teristics, opinions, and other consumer behavior attributes), you present the 
information with coded or summarized grouping categories.

221
 Chapter 12: Conducting Market Research
Sometimes data may not be in the format that you need for further analysis, 
in which case you need to “clean” the data. This may require you to drop 
problematic data altogether or in part by excluding a specific question, 
depending on what depth the unclean data skews the research results.
 
You must also take into account sampling errors that occur. In the preced-
ing section, I discuss how to avoid sampling errors. However, they still often 
occur, so in this section I show you how to recognize and handle those errors 
so that they don’t affect the outcome of your market research. A few of the 
reasons data may be problematic include
 
✓ Incomplete responses: This error often occurs when the method of 
data collection isn’t fully completed. For example, your subject may 
have skipped some questions or failed to provide you with necessary 
information.
 
✓ Data entry error: This error occurs when the information isn’t recorded 
properly. For example, your subject may have marked “disagree” but 
it could have been entered as “strongly agree.” These errors also can 
happen when data entry operators are fatigued or just careless in their 
entries. You must be aware of these not only with in-house staff, but 
also with market research companies that you outsource to. Data entry 
errors are difficult to catch. They’re typically caught by supervising the 
entry at periodic times or watching for inconsistencies within the data.
 
✓ Questionable entry: These errors appear when there’s an inconsistency 
in the subject’s responses. You often see this when your subject doesn’t 
answer honestly or doesn’t understand the question.
Interpreting the data and 
devising solutions
Inferential data is used when you want to move beyond simply describing the 
results and begin making judgments about specific issues. For instance, infer-
ential data analysis allows you to use the information you’ve obtained from a 
small group to make judgments about a larger group. You can use this type of 
analysis to compare groups and see whether there’s a difference in how they 
responded to an issue. You also can use this type of analysis to forecast what 
may happen based on the information you’ve collected.
In order to use inferential data effectively, you need a well-structured 
research plan that follows the scientific method. You’ll benefit more by using 
the quantitative data collection method rather than the qualitative method.

222
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
Your solution recommendations must be clear and well supported by the 
research data. If you’ve done the research yourself, you’re more than likely safe 
when following solution recommendations. However, when you use secondary 
data and base businesses decision on that data, you can run into problems. So 
you want to ensure that the secondary data you have collected is reliable and 
of good quality. You also want to make sure that it’s collected from the same 
target market that you’ll be providing your solutions and marketing to.
Preparing a formal report
If you need to prepare a formal report, you must prepare a written report 
that outlines what was researched and what resulted from the research. In 
a formal situation, you’ll likely be required to prepare an oral presentation 
as well.
A typical formal research report includes the following elements:
 
✓ Title page
 
✓ Acknowledgements of people who assisted
 
✓ Table of contents
 
✓ List of tables, figures, charts, and graphs
When recommending solutions to the problem, be sure to include the follow-
ing contents:
 
✓ Introduction
 
✓ Review of the research information
 
✓ Procedures used
 
✓ Findings of your research
 
✓ Recommendations
 
✓ Summary and conclusions
 
✓ Appendixes
 
✓ Bibliography
 
If you’ve created an effective research report, you’ll be able to use the report 
to make decisions about marketing strategies to address the researched prob-
lem or issue. And after the research is completed, you can implement changes 
that need to be made, and then you can carefully monitor and track the results 
in order to evaluate whether the changes you’ve made are a success.

In This Chapter
▶ Breaking your market into segments
▶ Walking through the segmentation process step by step
T
he term market segmentation often scares business owners. They some-
times feel that if they segment their market, they’re narrowing their 
chances for sales. This thought couldn’t be farther from the truth. Instead, 
segmentation enables you to create specific market strategies that are geared 
toward specific markets. You’ll find that by using segmentation, you can gain 
the highest return on your marketing and sales efforts. Developing a solid 
understanding of the purposes and processes behind market segmentation 
can go a long way toward positively changing the way you approach your 
marketing program.
In this chapter, I help you get a solid handle on market segmentation. I start 
out by explaining the basics of segmentation, clarifying what it is and why 
it’s such an important part of a successful marketing plan. I also walk you, 
step by step, through the segmentation process, showing you how to apply 
knowledge of consumer behavior in order to narrow the range of customers 
you focus on.
An Introduction to Market Segmentation
In simple terms, market segmentation is the process of dividing a total market 
into market groups that consist of people who have similar needs and 
desires. The process of segmentation purposely focuses on creating market-
ing strategies for consumers that have similar interest and needs, instead of 
the opposite, which is mass marketing and creating campaigns that treat con-
sumers with a “one-size-fits-all” marketing approach. Segmentation enables 
you to target customers most effectively.

224
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
Your core market is the largest market that your business reaches. For exam-
ple, say you have a golf course; your core market would be golf enthusiasts. If 
the customers within your core market have differences that require different 
target messages, you need to create a variety of small submarkets that you 
address individually.
The best way to gauge whether you should break your core market into sub-
markets is to evaluate whether certain groups within your core would have 
an interest in specific products or services that you offer. In the case of the 
golf example, your submarkets may include those interested in equipment, 
those interested in using your golf course, and those interested in golf camps 
or lessons. So your target market — the one you pitch your product or service 
to — can be either your core market or a subset of your core market.
Later in this chapter, I walk you through the details of applying market seg-
mentation; for now, in the following sections, I explain why segmentation is 
a vital part of marketing efforts and provide you with a quick preview of the 
process.
Understanding why segmentation 
is important
If you expect to use marketing segmentation properly, you must first 
understand why it’s so important and how it affects your marketing efforts. 
Marketing segmentation has several main advantages:
 
✓ You save time and money by focusing your efforts on the right cus-
tomers. When you segment properly, you ensure the highest return on 
your marketing investment, because you only market to those consum-
ers who are interested in what you’re offering and are, therefore, most 
likely to purchase your products or services.
 
 Segmentation allows you to personally address the needs and expecta-
tions of that clearly defined group of consumers with a marketing mix 
that consists of product characteristics, price, promotional activities, 
and places to present the product. (For more on the four Ps of market-
ing, head to Chapter 3.) You will find that not only is segmenting your 
markets cost-effective, but it also actually makes your marketing easier.
 
✓ Your marketing messages are more focused and, therefore, more effec-
tive. When you create market segments, you can create different mes-
sages that cater to each individual segment. These messages are what 
the marketing world refers to as positioning messages. With these mes-
sages, you communicate your unique selling advantage or proposition in 
a targeted message to your segments. You must use positioning in every 
aspect of business, including in marketing, sales, and customer service.

225
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
 
 If you accurately position your product or service, it should answer the 
following question: Why will someone in my selected segment buy my 
product or service rather than my competition’s product or service? 
Additionally, the consistency of your marketing message helps your 
customer remember you.
 
✓ You may be inspired with new product ideas. By identifying and recog-
nizing potential customer needs, you become equipped with information 
that you can use to create additional products and services that would 
be of interest to your customer.
To help solidify your understanding of market segmentation, take a look at 
the following scenario, which is an example of effective segmentation:
You’re thumbing through a high-end fashion magazine. You run across 
an advertisement for a vacation broker that features trips to New York, 
Paris, and Los Angeles. The advertisement appeals to fashion-centric 
individuals. You expect to see this type of ad in a high-end fashion maga-
zine because, if a woman is interested in fashion, these advertisements 
may catch her attention and move her to book a vacation to view a fash-
ion show.
The next day you find yourself browsing through a magazine created 
for men who enjoy playing golf (you have eclectic reading habits, don’t 
you?). You stumble across an advertisement from the same vacation 
broker, only this time it highlights vacation packages containing trips to 
some of the most exquisite golf courses in Las Vegas, Phoenix, and the 
Carolinas. This magazine caters to a different group of people, but the 
same broker is doing the advertising.
On the third day, you’re at the garage having your oil changed, and you 
pick up a magazine that discusses the latest cars. While perusing the 
articles, you come across an advertisement by the same vacation broker. 
It’s a little different from the first two. This time the ad showcases vaca-
tion packages to Monte Carlo, Berlin, and Le Mans — destinations that 
are home to many exotic races.
Clearly this vacation broker is using market segmentation. It’s advertising in 
three different magazines with three different messages. The company offers 
the same core product in each advertisement — the ability to put together a 
comprehensive vacation package — but it focuses its marketing messages in 
ways that best appeal to target markets that it has identified.
 
By creating these types of segments, you can speak directly to your custom-
ers’ varied interests and needs. Would the vacation advertisements have 
worked just as well if the company had placed the fashion advertisement in all 
three magazines? The answer is no.

226
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
Figuring out how segmentation works
The basic criteria that you use for segmentation are universal. So before 
you can start working through the segmentation process, you need to get 
a handle on those criteria, which are referred to as variables. Marketers 
use variables as guidance throughout the segmentation process. You could 
almost look at variables as the “qualifiers” of specific targeted markets that 
are identified.
The variables
The key task is to find the variables that split the market into actionable seg-
ments. You generally use two sets of segmentation variables to split your 
market:
 
✓ Customer needs: Customer needs represent the needs that your customer 
has that your product or service meets. They’re the most basic means of 
segmenting your market. In this case, you identify a product benefit that 
satisfies the needs of a particular group (or groups) of customers.
 
 For example, if you run a golf course and are segmenting according to 
customer needs, you could create three groups: Those who are inter-
ested in using the golf course services, those who are interested in pur-
chasing equipment, and those who are interested in lessons.
 
✓ Profiler bases: Profiler bases are profiles you’ve created that contain 
commonalities that potential customers may have. When you use pro-
files to segment your market, you forgo customer needs and instead use 
more descriptive and measurable consumer characteristics, including 
demographic, psychographic, geographic, and behavioral bases.
 
 For example, if you’re the golf course owner, you have to figure out 
whether you have customers that live in a specific region and whether 
they have specific demographics or behaviors in common. Here’s why 
profiler bases work well: If you do own the golf course (and let’s say you 
have multiple locations), you could segment your market by the area 
that the customers are located in. This would work especially well if you 
were marketing a special event in the same area that a group of your 
customers lives in.
 
To properly segment your market you want to look at both variables — 
consumer needs and profiler bases — in order to identify specific segments 
in your market. Say, for instance, you’re having a special golf lesson event at 
a specific location. You can now use both variables to create your marketing 
message and identify where that message needs to be delivered. You want to 
segment using the customer needs to identify which customers are interested 
in lessons, and then you want to use the profiler base in order to identify 
which of those customers are in the location of your special golf lesson event.

227
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
The process
 
To make your way through the process of segmentation, you follow these 
steps:
 
1. Identify your core market.
 
 This step is vital because it’s the foundation of creating your segments.
 
2. Determine whether your core market qualifies for segmentation.
 
 You must follow through with this step to identify whether your core 
market fits in with segmentation criteria.
 
3. Evaluate your core market for potential success.
 
 The idea of segmentation is to create marketing messages that perform 
better, so in this step you evaluate that potential.
 
4. Identify potential customer needs.
 
 In order to speak directly with your marketing message, you must iden-
tify the needs of your customers.
 
5. Identify submarkets within your core market.
 
 In this step, you determine whether you have small groups within your 
core market that would benefit from segmentation.
 
6. Identify segment dimensions.
 
 In Steps 4 and 5 you identify the variables that you use in the segmen-
tation process; you use those variables to identify your target market, 
which represents your core market as well as submarkets within that 
group. Within these groups the customers will have similarities as well 
as differences. So within your core group, you can have different target 
messages.
 
7. Evaluate the market segments.
 
 At this point, your segmentation is already complete, and you’re now 
evaluating the segments you’ve identified. Consumers don’t always 
share the same reaction to marketing messages, so you first want to 
identify the behavior of each segment. This way you can create a mar-
keting message that appeals and attracts them.
 
 Then you estimate the size and revenue potential of your market seg-
ments. Doing so is important because you want to gauge the size of a 
marketing segment before investing time, money, and resources that 
you may not get back.
In the remaining sections of this chapter, I explain the nuts and bolts of each 
step in the segmentation process. So read on for more details.

Step 1: Identify Your Core Market 
by Using Profiler Bases
The process of identifying a core market can sometimes be easier for a busi-
ness that’s already in existence, because you can look at the data from your 
company’s history and identify the most common customer needs and pro-
filer base variables. However, if you’re a new company, the process can be 
somewhat more difficult — but not impossible.
With a new business, the historical data to use when identifying your core 
market will not be available, so you need to use your own expertise in your 
business to determine which consumers will represent your core market. 
You identify your core market by using the profiler bases I mention in the 
“Figuring out how segmentation works” section, earlier in this chapter.
Deciding which profiler bases to use
There are four basic criteria you can use to create your profiles: demograph-
ics, psychographics, geographics, and behaviors. Even though I explain only 
four basic profiles in the following sections, you may have unique bases 
that you want to use when segmenting your core market. Additionally, when 
segmenting with profiler bases, it’s possible to use more than one profile in 
order to narrow down segments of your market and gain a better perspective 
of the commonalities in that core market.
The easiest way to determine what profile to use is to sit down and evaluate 
the consumers you’re selling your products to. Are their commonalities sur-
rounded by geographic data, behavior data, psychographic data, or demo-
graphic data? If you don’t have a current market, your profiler base will focus 
on the commonalities of your ideal market.
 
When selecting a profiler base to segment your target market, keep in mind 
that demographic and geographic bases aren’t as useful as psychographic or 
behavior bases in determining what actually motivates people to buy prod-
ucts or use services. The demographic and geographic bases are less subjec-
tive (or more objective). If you do use these objective bases, use them when 
you first start segmenting, and then develop a marketing mix that triggers 
motivation by using the psychographic and behavior bases.
 
I find it easiest to identify a core market by making a list of customer groups 
on a piece of paper and then identifying their common traits in one column 
and differences in another. You can also then create submarkets with that 
same list. For example, in Table 13-1, I’ve created a list for a core market 

229
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
called “golf enthusiasts.” As you apply the profiler bases to identify your core 
market, make a list like the one in Table 13-1 so you can see your consumers’ 
differences and similarities at a glance.
Table 13-1 Common Traits among Core Market of Golf Enthusiasts
Differences
Similarities
Age
Enjoy golf
Location
Median income of $80,000 annually
Ethnicity
When you try this exercise, you may only have two groups or you may have 
several. There are no right or wrong answers, because the number of sub-
groups is dependent on your business.
 
During the beginning stages of the segmentation of your market, it’s important 
that you not make general assumptions or start with narrow-minded thoughts 
about who represents your core market. There are many variables to consider 
in the segmentation process, and uncovering all the dimensions takes cre-
ativity and methodology. You want to use your knowledge, experience, and 
common sense in determining these variables.
Applying the demographic base
The demographic base attempts to segment your market with descriptive char-
acteristics such as gender, age, ethnicity, education, occupation, life cycle, and 
income level. For example, in evaluating demographics, perhaps you find that 
the majority of consumers that purchase from you work as physicians. You can 
use this as a profiler base and create a segment of physicians that buy from 
you. This allows you to create a targeted marketing message to physicians that 
purchase your product or that are potential consumers of future purchases of 
your product.
 
The demographic base is the largest of the four segmentation bases used 
by marketers. It’s also the easiest to quantify and understand. However, the 
byproduct of all this simplicity is that demographics aren’t all that useful in 
predicting specific buyer behaviors. Demographics rarely allow you to predict 
buyer behavior because the characteristics are often so similar that it’s dif-
ficult to differentiate the needs of each segment. You’ll often find that the seg-
ments within this base have similar brand preferences, consumption patterns, 
and media exposure patterns. So the segments aren’t of much predictive use if 
most folks behave similarly.

230
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
Marketers use this base as a way to create a cut-and-dried method of segmen-
tation that’s less subjective than the other bases. You can always identify age 
and gender, which helps when fine-tuning your marketing message. That’s 
because what may appeal to a man may not appeal to a woman, and in the 
same fashion what may appeal to someone who’s 65 may not appeal to some-
one who’s 21.
To determine the demographic base of a given population, all you need to do 
is get the answers to the following 13 standard questions:
 
✓ What is your age?
 
✓ What is your gender?
 
✓ What is your primary language?
 
✓ What is the highest level of education you have completed?
 
✓ What ethnicity group would you classify yourself with?
 
✓ What country do you currently live in?
 
✓ How long have you lived there?
 
✓ What is your current household income?
 
✓ Do you rent or own your home?
 
✓ How many children under 16 live in your household?
 
✓ What is your current employment status?
 
✓ What is your individual annual income?
 
✓ What is your religious affiliation?
 
You can use the answers to these questions in order to create an in-depth 
report on the demographics that your core market represents. You then use 
that data to focus on deeper submarkets that you can market specifically 
to, using the absolute data you’ve gathered. For guidance in soliciting the 
answers to these questions from the right people, head to Chapter 12.
Applying the psychographic base
The psychographic base focuses on the customer’s state of mind and its direct 
influence on buyer behavior. Characteristics that are included in the psycho-
graphic base are social class, values, personality, and lifestyle. For instance, 
perhaps you find that a large percentage of those that purchase from you are 
in the upper social class and live a wealthy lifestyle. You could segment this 
group and create a message that specifically pertains to its lifestyle and why 
those that live that lifestyle purchase your product. Doing so would help you 
create a message that was targeted toward that specific social class and life-
style, making your message personally appealing and enticing to them.

231
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
 
The psychographic base is more subjective than objective. So your answers 
aren’t as cut and dried as they would be with the demographic base. Because 
this area of creating a segment will be more subjective, you want to make 
yourself more aware of the attitudes that surround the psychographic base 
that you decide to market to. Refer to Chapter 6 for more information on con-
sumer attitudes.
The characteristics of psychological bases are measured by Attitude, Interest, 
Opinion surveys, or AIO surveys. AIO surveys are designed and implemented 
by outsourced market research companies. These companies ask customers 
if they agree or disagree with a series of statements describing various activi-
ties, interests, and opinions. The data from these surveys allow companies 
to develop lifestyle profiles, which are representative of your core market 
and what interests that market has. It also helps in identifying the subjective 
behavior that your consumers represent. You can then use this information to 
create marketing messages that appeal to the motivations of your consumers.
 
Because the psychographic base can be costly to implement, most small busi-
nesses avoid using it.
Applying the geographic base
The geographic base focuses on the location of prospective target markets 
and distinguishes characteristics associated with each location. The geo-
graphic base looks at characteristics such as region, climate, population 
density, and population growth rate. You can use this information to create 
marketing messages that appeal to consumers in specific geographical areas.
For example, let’s say that you realize that the majority of your customers 
that purchase are in a warm climate. In other words, you realize that you 
actually sell more to the people of the West Coast than to those on the East 
Coast. Your product may not even be seasonal, but for some reason it’s 
receipted more in warmer climates. So you make the decision to create a 
marketing strategy specifically for those climate areas.
As you can see with the example, this base of segmentation allows companies 
to focus on a single area, a few areas, or many areas depending on certain con-
siderations, such as the size of each geographic area and the cost of serving 
it. It’s possible to serve many geographic locations with success. You can use 
the geographic segments to tailor to different natures and needs in each area.
 
Consider again the warmer climate scenario I mention earlier. If you were 
in this situation, you would take a deeper look into your product to find out 
why that product sells to a client in a warmer area. Create some bullet points 
that represent why your product sells in those warmer climates and create a 
marketing message around those bullet points. This exercise can help you in 
tailoring your message directly to those climates.

232
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
Applying the behavior base
The behavior base defines a target market by how a group behaves, as con-
sumers, toward a seller’s offering. The behavior base looks at characteristics 
such as usage rate and patterns, price sensitivity, brand loyalty, and benefits 
sought. An example of the behavior base would be how often customers use 
a product or service, how loyal they are to it, and what benefits they seek 
from it.
The behavior base isn’t as absolute as the geographic or demographic base, 
but it does provide you with useful information. You can use the behavior 
base to determine the following:
 
✓ The benefits that consumers are interested in
 
✓ How much they use your products or your competitor’s products
 
✓ What their readiness to buy is
 
✓ The occasions that stimulate the purchase of your products
This information is helpful in creating marketing messages that appeal to the 
motivations of your consumers and that trigger positive consumer behavior 
toward your product.
Step 2: Determine Whether Your Core 
Market Qualifies for Segmentation
After you identify your core market (see the previous sections for details), 
it’s important to find out whether your core group qualifies for the segmen-
tation process (because not all do!). To find out whether your core market 
qualifies, ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Is your core market group large enough to support your objective? 
This is a crucial question. It’s especially important if you find that you’re 
serving a competitive market. That’s because you’ll have competition 
in gaining market share. You answer this question by measuring the 
potential of that market (based on those consumers’ buying behaviors) 
and identifying the size of your core market to ensure that it can support 
you, even if you experience a large volume of competition.
 
✓ Does your core market group show signs of growth? You don’t want 
to enter a market that’s flat or declining, especially if you’re going 
head-to-head with other competitors.

233
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
 
✓ Does your company have the necessary skills, knowledge, and exper-
tise to serve this core market group? A company’s skills, knowledge, 
and expertise sell a product to consumers. Make sure that you can 
communicate with your customers in the segment; otherwise you may 
find yourself facing a learning curve in understanding how to effectively 
market to a particular segment. Evaluate and take note of not only your 
own knowledge, skills, and expertise, but also that of your competitors.
 
✓ Does serving the needs of the group that you identified meet the mis-
sion of your company? You don’t want your segment to extend too far 
beyond the direction that your company has chosen to take.
Were you able to answer yes to all the previous questions? If so, congratula-
tions! You’re ready for the next step in segmentation. If not, take a look and 
evaluate what areas you’re lacking in. Then make a plan to rectify those areas 
so you can either make a determination that the core market isn’t right for 
you or create a plan to bring the company up to par when it comes to serving 
the core market you’ve identified.
 
Keep in mind that while the questions and research are important, it’s equally 
important to go by your own intuition and judgment — you know your com-
pany better than anyone.
Step 3: Evaluate Your Core Market 
for Potential Success
During this step, you determine whether the core market you have chosen 
is a successful market for you. After all, you never want to choose a core 
market that runs a risk of going flat or that shows no sign of upward growth. 
The ideal core market
 
✓ Is strong and showing signs of growth
 
✓ Is static and financially holding its own
 
✓ Has a high product demand and isn’t showing signs of decreasing
If your target market meets these criteria, you’re set. You have the ability to 
reach your business and financial goals by going after this core market.
 
The biggest challenge in this step is making sure that the breadth of your core 
is appropriate — not too narrow and not too broad for your business.

234
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
The following five questions can help you determine whether you’ve selected 
a core market that can be successful for you. When answering these ques-
tions, take into consideration your experience, your knowledge, and your 
common sense.
 
✓ What’s the potential of increased profit in this target market?
 
✓ What are the similar needs of potential customers in this segment?
 
✓ What are the different needs of potential customers in this segment?
 
✓ What’s the ability to attain consumer purchase action by marketing to 
this segment?
 
✓ How difficult will it be to get buyers in this market?
The answers to the preceding questions will help you in determining the 
viability of the core market you’re looking at going after. I call these the “hard” 
questions because they require more than a yes or no answer. Businesses 
often pick a target market without analyzing the “hard” questions. Big mistake. 
After answering the questions, you’ll have a clear picture of current and future 
potential for the core market you’ve selected. Without that information, you 
could end up losing out on some big business and big bucks.
 
If you find that the core market you’ve decided on has potential, keep moving 
through the following steps. If you’ve found that the core market doesn’t carry 
enough potential for success, spend some time going back and evaluating the 
variables of segmentation.
Step 4: Identify Potential 
Customer Needs
Consumers make purchases on the basis of benefits and how a product helps 
them either by making their life easier or solving a need that they have identi-
fied. If you don’t understand that need, you can’t use it in a marketing mes-
sage that will speak directly to consumers and motivate them to purchase.
You have to do some brainstorming in this step. I want you to switch places 
with your consumer and think about what you need. Right now, you’re no 
longer the business owner; you’re a consumer in your core market. The more 
needs you can come up with here, the better. When you started your busi-
ness, you likely had ideas of what your customers needed. Do you remember 
what those needs were? If you’ve been in business for any amount of time, 
I’m sure that you’ve become even more aware of needs that you didn’t know 
of in the beginning.

235
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
In Step 1, you focus on the profiler bases where you identified your core 
market. With that core market in mind, answer the following questions:
 
✓ Why should your customer buy from you?
 
✓ What is it that you offer that should persuade your customer to make a 
buying decision?
 
✓ What benefits and features that you offer appeal to your customer?
You can use the answers to these questions to help construct your marketing 
message in a way that helps consumers relate to the message. (Chapter 16 
helps you create a targeted marketing message.)
Step 5: Segment Your Core 
Market into Submarkets
In this step, you come up with ideas for any submarkets that represent 
groups within the core market or segment you’ve identified. Just remember 
to segment smaller markets only when you have the ability to satisfy each 
group’s needs by using the same marketing mix.
 
The best way to work through this step is to use the core market that you 
identified in Step 1. Really spend some time focusing on the characteristics of 
the customers that are within that core group — specifically on a major need 
that they have. After that, it’s time to think outside your “core” box. What 
needs do they have in common? Are there specific benefits they all look for 
when evaluating your product? The idea is to begin to evaluate submarkets 
within your core market so that you can create specific marketing messages 
based on their needs (rather than an “all-for-one” marketing message).
Try creating a new list that consists of customer-related benefits that you 
offer with your products or services in order to help consumers see value in 
your product or service. An example may be that you offer car wash services, 
but you’re a traveling business. You go to the location of the customers to 
wash their cars while they’re at work. This setup saves your customers time. 
You benefit by being able to charge a premium because of the convenience 
that you offer. Your demographics for this car wash service include:
 
✓ Professionals who work a minimum of 65 hours per week.
 
✓ Owners of swanky cars. (Maybe most cars that you wash have a value of 
$50,000 or more.)

236
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
You may have initially targeted investment firms as a submarket. One of your 
major resources of clients has over 150 employees with a median salary of 
$90,000 per year. Now, consider where else you can find a company with 
more than 150 employees with that kind of median salary: I’d say that leading 
law firms may be the next submarket for you to explore.
Step 6: Identify Segment Dimensions
Consumers view specific dimensions of a product as important to them when 
purchasing. They place varying levels of importance on the dimensions that 
carry more value for them. When you understand the dimensions that your 
target market views with a higher level of importance, you can better posi-
tion your product when marketing it to them. In other words, you can craft 
your message to the specific dimensions. Ideally, a product market will be 
described in terms of customer behavior, customer urgency to satisfy his or 
her needs, and customer geographic location.
 
Segmenting by using dimensions as a way to target multiple submarkets with 
different marketing messages can help in guiding your marketing mix planning. 
You can use the different dimensions to focus on four key factors when mar-
keting to specific submarkets and segments that you’ve identified, including:
 
✓ Purchase behavior that’s relevant to your product
 
✓ Consumer types that are relevant to your product
 
✓ Purchase influences that are specific to your product
 
✓ Attraction that’s relevant to your product and to your brand
Recognizing the two main 
types of dimensions
Different dimensions are available for you to use when segmenting your 
markets. There are actually two dimensions; however, those dimensions 
can encompass different factors, but they fit into only one of the following 
categories:
 
✓ Qualifying dimensions: Qualifying dimensions are those dimensions 
that are required in order to include a specific customer in a product 
market. For example, customers must have enough money to afford a 
specific product in order to qualify as a potential market or submarket 
member. Qualifying dimensions help identify the core features that must 
be offered to everyone in a product market.

237
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
 
✓ Determining dimensions: Determining dimensions are those dimensions 
that actually affect the customer’s purchase of a specific product or 
brand in a product market. For example, customers in need of something 
in a general product category can be further segmented into groups 
depending on which features are most important to their needs. In the 
car market, for instance, “sporty” and “economical” may be different 
determining dimensions for different consumers.
Calling out category-specific dimensions
 
You must take two categories into consideration when dealing with dimen-
sions: the consumer market category and the business market category. In 
other words, is your market a business-to-consumer market or is it a business-
to-business market? It’s important to identify which market you’re selling to, 
because the needs and determining dimensions for each group are different. 
Consumer and business markets differ in two very distinctive ways:
 
✓ Business markets are more likely to be price driven than brand 
driven, which means that your marketing message must focus on the 
sensitivity of price in order to attract the business market.
 
✓ Demand in business markets tends to be more volatile than in con-
sumer markets, which means that your competition can be tough. 
You must create a message that’s consistent and really focuses on the 
dimensions of interest in your target market in order to gain the atten-
tion you need to sell your product.
Each dimension refers to what marketers must evaluate when marketing 
to specific segments. These are the dimensions consumers often use to 
make the determination to purchase or not to purchase. Flip to Chapter 21 
for more on the differences between business-to-business markets and 
business-to-consumer markets.
The consumer market
In the consumer market, you need to take the following dimensions into 
consideration:
 
✓ Attitudes: Consumers have attitudes about specific products and 
brands, so it’s important to understand the dimension that they have 
about your product or what type of attitude you would like to create 
about your product when marketing to them.
 
✓ Brand familiarity: Consumers often buy products they’re familiar with, 
so you can use this dimension when marketing your product. The more 
you create familiarity, the more apt consumers are to remember and 
buy your product.

238
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
✓ Geographic location: Consumers look for convenience and whether 
your product is available in specific locations. Use this dimension when 
marketing in order to make consumers aware that your product is avail-
able to them at convenient locations.
 
✓ Income: It’s important to consider this dimension when marketing your 
product, because you don’t want to select a specific segment if your 
product is out of that segment’s price range.
 
✓ Needs: Consumers buy on the basis of benefits and needs. So, when mar-
keting, you can use this dimension to make consumers aware of what 
need you solve for them.
 
✓ Purchase relationships: Consumers buy on the basis of relationships. So 
when evaluating this dimension, you want to weigh the importance of a 
relationship with the segment you’ve selected. This way you create rela-
tionships through marketing with the segments that find this dimension 
important.
The business market
In the business market, pay attention to these dimensions:
 
✓ Buying situation: Business consumers purchase based on need and 
convenience. You want to evaluate whether you’re providing them with 
a convenient buying situation; if so, you want to focus on this when mar-
keting to them.
 
✓ Closeness of relationship with customer: Business consumers find 
that relationships are important to them when they purchase. So, if this 
dimension is of high priority to them, you must work to create a rela-
tionship, using your marketing message in order to encourage them to 
purchase from you.
 
✓ Geographic location: Businesses, just like consumers, look for conve-
nience. So if your product is available in specific locations, you want to 
use this dimension when marketing. This way you know the business is 
aware that your product is available to them at a convenient location.
 
✓ North American Industry Classification System codes (NAICS): 
Businesses often evaluate the NAICS in order to determine who they’ll 
purchase from. If this is a dimension that’s important to your potential 
business consumer, you want to market your participation and industry 
classification.
 
✓ Reciprocity: Business consumers strive to work with companies that 
reciprocate in purchases or send referral business, so you need to evalu-
ate the importance of this dimension.

239
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
 
✓ Size: Business consumers often look at the size of a business they’re 
purchasing from. So be prepared to explain the size of your business in 
a positive and optimistic manner. Be sure to emphasize the benefits of 
working with a company your size.
 
✓ Source loyalty: Business consumers like to work with companies that 
are loyal to them. If this is a strong dimension for your prospective busi-
ness consumer, be prepared to explain your view on loyalty and how 
your company works to keep that loyalty.
 
✓ Type of organization: Business consumers often like to do business with 
specific types of organizations, so be well versed on the stance of the 
segment you’re selling to when it comes to dealing with this dimension.
 
✓ Type of product: When purchasing, business consumers often evaluate 
the types of products as well as the quality of them. Evaluate this dimen-
sion to make a determination of the different types of products that you 
offer that will be of interest to your potential business consumer.
Step 7: Evaluate Your Market Segments
It’s time to determine which of your segments have the greatest potential to 
fulfill your overall business goals. Your goals probably include revenue, prof-
its, and cash flow — as most business goals do.
 
Not all of your segments will satisfy these goals. Instead, when evaluating your 
segments, you’ll more than likely come to the conclusion that some of them 
may be money drains at the present time. They’ll cost the company more 
money to service and support than the segment actually makes in revenue. 
This doesn’t mean that the segments won’t be prosperous later; so even 
though you may put them on the back burner for now, always remember to 
evaluate them for future potential.
Predicting consumer behavior 
within a specific segment
The best way to evaluate the behavior of a specific segment is to gather 
enough information about the segment that you can create a clear picture of 
a typical member within the segment. Then create a buyer profile. A buyer 
profile paints the picture of the buyer’s motivation, location, and buying 
habits. It does this by exploring the following questions:

240
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
✓ How do they buy?
 
✓ Why do they buy?
 
✓ When do they buy?
 
✓ Where do they buy?
When reviewing the typical buyer’s buying habits, also consider past and 
potential future economic issues and how they might affect the frequency 
and value a consumer places on the purchases of your products and ser-
vices. When you’re determining the segment you want to target, first look 
at the economic stability of that segment. You do this in order to ensure 
that you aren’t entering into a dead end that will cost you resources with no 
return. If you do find that there are economic issues, such as layoffs, bank-
ruptcies due to an economic downturn, or low economic resources, take 
some time to research how those issues could affect your business if you 
do decide to proceed into the segment anyway. You always want to make an 
educated and well-informed decision.
 
Considering these economic issues gives you a greater grasp on evaluating 
the success of a specific market segment and how the buyers within it will 
respond to your offer. When evaluating market segment behavior, know that 
it takes three to four weeks to build a buyer profile of a particular segment’s 
behavior toward a particular product. And keep in mind that research shows 
that customer behavior tends to shift over a three-month period. This is 
important to remember because you want to have three months of data in 
order to accurately evaluate the segment.
The truth is, you really can’t predict the buying behavior of your customers. 
However, you can gather as much information as possible to lower the risk in 
specific segments by evaluating the segments before entering them. Because 
there are so many unknowns to new markets, it’s important to evaluate every 
angle — from buying behavior and consumption patterns to economic issues 
and difficulties you may not have considered.
Estimating segment size 
and revenue potential
It’s important when evaluating and developing segments that you take a hard 
look at the size and revenue potential of that segment. In this section, I dis-
cuss how to evaluate and estimate the segment’s value as it pertains to time 
and money.

241
 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
Using the market segmentation estimation 
formula, the preferred method
The market segmentation estimation method is useful when you have general 
data about the segment you’re entering. I always advise using this method, 
because with general data, you’re gaining a clear and accurate estimation; 
with the other formulas, you’ll spend a lot of time guessing and estimating 
figures that you’ll more than likely not have access to. The market segment 
estimation method seems to be the quickest and easiest one to use. The 
formula is as follows — all the numbers pertain specifically to the segment 
demographic:
Estimated population
× % of people in target gender
× % of people in target age group
# of consumers in your segment demographic 
After you calculate the number of consumers in your segment, you can calcu-
late the potential revenue you’ll earn from that segment by using this formula:
# of consumers in your segment demographic
× % of people that will use your product
× price (in dollars) of product or service that you’re selling
potential revenue (in dollars) from that segment demographic 
To use this evaluation method, you need the following figures, which you 
gather by conducting market research:
 
✓ Estimate of population within your segment demographic
 
✓ Estimated number of consumers that match the gender of your segment
 
✓ Estimated number of consumers that match the age of your segment
 
✓ Price that you will sell your product for (or the price that your competi-
tors are selling similar products for if you haven’t yet determined your 
price)
 
Estimate the numbers to the best of your ability; the more specific your data, 
the better the accuracy of the estimate you will have.
Use those figures as you work through the following steps to estimate the 
potential of your market segment:

242
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
1. Estimate the population of your segment demographic.
 
 This is the population that you have estimated that represents the seg-
ment demographic that you have identified and will be marketing to. 
Suppose I’m selling lipstick and I know that within my demographic 
there are 52,000 people in my segment area.
 
2. Multiply the number from Step 1 by the percentage of the gender of 
segment you will be marketing to.
 
 This will tell you the number of consumers within that segment that are 
the gender you’ll be marketing to. For example, if you’re marketing to 
only women in that population, you want to take the percentage of the 
population that is women and multiply that by the population estimate 
in order to gain the number of consumers in that area that are women. 
Of those 52,000 people, 35 percent of them are women. So the math goes 
like this: 52,000 × 0.35 = 18,200. In the segment area, 18,200 people are 
female.
 
3. Multiply the number from Step 2 by the percentage of the consumers 
in the age group that you’re targeting.
 
 This will tell you the number of consumers within that segment that rep-
resent the age group that you’re targeting. My segment market includes 
women who are from 18 to 25 years old. Of the 18,200 women in my 
demographic only 15 percent of them are 18 to 25 years old. The math is 
as follows: 18,200 × 0.15 = 2,730. Of the number of females in my segment 
area, 2,730 are in the age group I’m targeting.
 
4. Multiply the number you get in Step 3 by the percentage of those con-
sumers that you think will purchase your product.
 
 Of the 2,730 females between the ages of 18 and 25 in my demographic 
area, I estimate that 65 percent wear lipstick. I have a potential audience 
of 1,174 consumers (2,730 × 0.65 = 1,774).
 
5. Multiply the number you get in Step 4 by the price that you’ll sell it for.
 
 You have determined that you’ll have a potential customer base of 1,774 
in Step 4, and you know that you’ll sell your product for $11.50. The 
potential revenue is $20,401 (1,774 x $11.50 = $20,401)
 
 This will give you an estimation of sales revenue that you can gain from 
that segment. Last year in my area approximately 30,000 tubes of lipstick 
were sold at an average price of $13.50. My current competition has 
about 33 percent of the market share. Based on my features and benefits 
and consumer market feedback, I estimated a total unit sales potential 
of 12,000 tubes of lipstick at a retail price of $11.50. 12,000 × $11.50 = 
$138,000. I can estimate that this segment will bring in $138,000.

 Chapter 13: Identifying Target Markets through Segmentation
I can now use this information to determine whether I have selected a seg-
ment that has enough people and revenue to be worth my time to enter. If it 
does, I can begin to position my product specifically to this market by tailor-
ing my marketing message to appeal and entice them to purchase from me.
Resorting to other methods
 
Suppose there’s very little information available for you to determine the size 
of a selected market segment. If that’s the case, how can you estimate the rev-
enue potential? You can use secondary research to gather specific information 
(see Chapter 12 for an explanation of research types), but if you’re trying to 
keep cost down there are a few alternatives that you can use to estimate the 
market segment size:
 
✓ Total the sales revenue of your competitors in the segment. You can 
use this method to gain a general idea of how many products you should 
sell based on the sales of your competitors.
 
✓ Total the purchase dollars spent by the customers in your segment. 
This method is good to use when you know how many purchases con-
sumers in that identified segment made when purchasing like products.
 
✓ Take your estimated number of sales in the segment, estimate your 
share, and then multiply. If you can accurately estimate how many 
products you’ll sell and the percentage of the market share you’ll own, 
this is a great method to use in order to gain a clear picture.
 
✓ Total the sales number of key suppliers into the segment and estimate 
the sales revenue this represents. If you have access to supplier infor-
mation and can get the sales revenue for the segment you’ve identified, 
this is a good method to estimate the potential sales of your product in 
the area because it isn’t limited to one supplier.

Unearthing New Market 
Opportunities
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding areas for new market opportunities
▶ Searching for untapped markets
▶ Evaluating whether to go ahead with a market entry
N
othing is more important to businesses than finding and exploiting 
untapped markets and opportunities. Gaining market share and creat-
ing stability by not having all your eggs in one basket, so to speak, is crucial 
for success. Sure, efforts to take advantage of untapped opportunities come 
with increased investment and risk, but the long-term benefits can outweigh 
any temporary setbacks that you encounter. When done correctly, entering 
into untapped markets or creating new ones can help you experience sales 
growth, increased reputation, and bargaining power.
When exploring new market opportunities, your goal is to identify what 
opportunities are out there and then figure out how you can take advantage 
of them. And last — but definitely not least — you need to evaluate what the 
opportunity means to you in terms of value to your company. In this chapter, 
I show you how to do all three, using your consumer behavior knowledge as 
a guide during your strategic planning phase.
 
It’s important to remember that your ultimate goal when it comes to market-
ing is to not only grow your business by attracting new customers, but also to 
use it to discover untapped marketing opportunities that will help you retain 
your current customers. So in this chapter, I also provide insight on finding 
opportunities to protect your current market share.

246
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
Finding and Recognizing Areas of 
Opportunity: A How-To Overview
Although opportunities in and of themselves are endless, they generally fall 
into three categories. Because the categories focus on different aspects of 
business, it’s helpful to conduct your search with an eye toward one at a 
time; otherwise, your mind may very well spontaneously combust, because 
you’ve cast your search over far too wide a terrain.
When seeking out opportunities in these categories, you should certainly 
conduct market research, but rely on internal resources as well — these 
resources offer a different perspective of the opportunities, because they 
help you examine the behaviors of your current customers.
What to look for: Opportunity types
 
New market opportunities come in three forms: marketplace, product/service 
offerings, and marketing activities. Here’s the rundown on each:
 
✓ Marketplace opportunities are opportunities to change where or how 
consumers can purchase your products or services. An example of 
a new marketplace opportunity may be offering your product online 
rather than just in physical store locations. These opportunities don’t 
arise out of luck. Instead, you discover them by recognizing the various 
forces that change the way a marketplace is governed. These forces 
include additional competition, laws and regulations, economy cycles, 
and social change. In order to identify these opportunities, you must 
understand what’s possible based on resources of both your company 
and the market itself.
 
✓ Product/service opportunities are opportunities that you can use to add 
new features or benefits to your current products or services. These also 
can represent opportunities for new products or services that you can 
offer to an existing customer base. You can often find opportunities in 
product offerings by evaluating your current consumers and the circum-
stances that surround them. Your objective is to determine the types of 
opportunities that exist within your products only. Your business may 
need to add, modify, or eliminate product features or even products.
 
 For instance, I can create a product and offer it to my consumers. It offers 
them an added convenience and in return increases my revenue by being 
able to sell the new product to existing and new customers alike.

247
 Chapter 14: Unearthing New Market Opportunities
 
✓ Marketing opportunities are simply new ways that you can reach an 
untapped market simply by crafting your message to different groups 
and evaluating different placements of your marketing message. For 
instance, you may want to create a new marketing message specifically 
showcasing your product benefits for a group that hasn’t yet used your 
product. Or you may want to place your current marketing message in a 
different marketing vehicle. An example of this would be advertising in a 
different magazine or newspaper that reaches a new market.
Where to look: Information sources
When searching for opportunities, you can find the information you need 
from the following sources:
 
✓ Consumer knowledge and feedback: The best way to find untapped 
markets or identify whether a market idea has potential is by using the 
knowledge of your current consumer base. You can ask your consumers 
questions regarding the products they’re using or about needs that they 
feel aren’t being met with the current product. Their answers give you 
the information you need to understand whether the development of 
more features or benefits in your current product would be beneficial or 
if you need to evaluate the creation of a new product to fulfill an unmet 
need that your consumers are experiencing.
 
✓ Market research: If you don’t have a consumer base, you need to con-
duct some market research in order to find untapped markets and iden-
tify whether your idea has merit. In other words, you want to make sure 
that it isn’t just a no-brain whim you thought up in the middle of the night.
 
✓ Sales team knowledge: It’s also important to use the knowledge of your 
sales force. Salespeople are normally the first to know about new prod-
ucts that are needed or solutions that your consumers may be looking for.
 
 You don’t need a huge sales team to do this. In fact, you can probably 
do it yourself by simply listening to your consumers. Find out what they 
need that you can provide.
Use these sources and the information throughout this chapter to help find 
opportunities in your marketing that not only reach untapped markets, but 
allow you to monitor your marketing initiatives, awaken customers that 
haven’t used your product in a while, and gain new business by trying new 
marketing methods.

248
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
Conducting the Search
In order to find available opportunities, you must conduct a search that’s 
detailed and informational. By detailed, I mean evaluate all three opportunity 
types in your search. This way you’ll walk away with a clear understanding 
of which opportunity will be the strongest for you when it comes to finding 
new customers. By informational, I mean a search that provides you with the 
knowledge you need in order to assess the opportunities by evaluating the 
needs and exploring how you can fulfill those needs. This evaluation will help 
you determine whether the opportunity is in fact viable and worth pursuing 
from a business standpoint.
Seeking out unmet needs 
in the marketplace
It’s easy to make finding marketplace opportunities more difficult than it 
should be. When evaluating opportunities within the marketplace, you simply 
need to assess whether an opportunity to enter that market exists right now. 
You can do this by walking through the following process:
 
1. Identify the marketplace opportunity.
 
 Look for opportunities that will help you gain the competitive edge 
against competitors.
 
2. Focus on the consumers in that marketplace.
 
 Identify the typical consumers in that marketplace and evaluate their 
consumption patterns for the product you’re offering.
 
3. Assess the current competition in that marketplace.
 
 Identify the competition that already exists in the marketplace. 
Determine why your products are different from your competitor’s and 
why a consumer should purchase from you instead.
When looking for new market opportunities, you must focus primarily on 
patterns and trends within that marketplace. And you want to evaluate pat-
terns and trends not only of present customers, but also of previous and 
future customers as well. You’ll be looking at the consumption patterns, sales 
patterns, customer satisfaction, and the trends of similar products within 
the marketplace. Usually with this information, you can discover whether a 
customer need exists because the customer isn’t being satisfied by current 
products offered by the competition.

249
 Chapter 14: Unearthing New Market Opportunities
 
You can use the information from this process to determine whether entering 
into a specific marketplace opportunity would bring the potential of success. 
It will either cause you to feel comfortable about entering a marketplace or it 
will make you feel uncomfortable because the data doesn’t prove that you’ll 
have success. If you look at this information and don’t see a need, it’s proba-
bly wise to seek out other opportunities.
Here’s an example to help you understand marketplace needs. Say that my 
marketplace is the university campus. I’ve looked at patterns and trends and 
have determined that the students order pizza from one business but are 
frustrated with the wait. I’ve also found that they would be willing to pay a 
little more for the convenience of quick delivery time. Here’s the breakdown 
of the marketplace info:
 
✓ Opportunity type: I’ve identified an opportunity for a pizza shop located 
close to a university. The closest pizza shop is 45 minutes away. The 
business will deliver to the university, but the pizza is subpar and 
it takes nearly two hours for delivery. This information came from a 
survey I conducted with the potential customers that I identified.
 
✓ Consumer: My consumers are university students. With this group, I 
know that my prices must be competitive and that I’ll need to keep the 
shop open late in order to serve the students’ needs. I also gathered this 
information from the informal survey that I conducted.
 
✓ Competition: I’ve evaluated the competition and found that the closest 
shop is 45 minutes away. None of the other shops will deliver to the uni-
versity due to the distance. This information came from market research 
that I conducted concerning my competition in the area.
As you can see, I’ve identified a marketplace opportunity. I can open a pizza 
shop near the university campus, provide the students with competitive 
prices, and deliver directly to the university. I will acquire business from my 
competitors, because I’ll meet a need that they aren’t meeting. Because this 
information shows me that my opportunity has potential for success, I can 
now begin to take steps in seizing this opportunity.
Looking at your products for new 
or improved product ideas
You can expand your market by finding new users of your current product, 
new uses for your current product, or ways for consumers to use more of 
your current product.

250
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
For example, think of all the different uses of baking soda: cooking, cleaning, 
deodorizing, and so on. You can use each of these functions to market baking 
soda in a different way. You haven’t changed the product; you’ve simply cre-
ated the awareness by marketing the benefits of baking soda to showcase the 
multiple ways that consumers can use the product. You could market baking 
soda in a cooking magazine by showing the benefits of its uses when cook-
ing. You also could market baking soda in a commercial that shows how to 
use it to clean stains out of a porcelain bathtub. Finally, you could market the 
benefits of using baking soda to deodorize a refrigerator. Marketing in this 
way increases the value perception as well as sales, because now consumers 
understand all the ways that this universal product can be used.
When you evaluate a product opportunity, you want to evaluate the following 
in order to validate the opportunity as credible and assess the potential suc-
cess of that opportunity:
 
✓ Product features: You want to identify the features of the product that 
make the opportunity of interest to your customers. A product feature is 
what a product does. In a competitive market, when a consumer needs to 
make a decision between two comparable alternatives that provide the 
same benefits, he will base his decision on the features of the product.
 
✓ Product benefits: It’s important that you identify the product benefits 
that will be of interest to the consumers. Then you can make a decision 
on whether they would purchase based on that benefit.
 
After evaluating the product features and benefits, you’ll have the informa-
tion you need to determine whether this opportunity holds merit for you and 
whether your customers would really see the value. In other words, you’ll 
have the answer on whether you should pursue the opportunity.
As an example, say I own a jewelry store and I recognize an opportunity to 
offer an add-on product that will benefit my consumers. The customers who 
come to my store to have their jewelry cleaned always comment on how my 
jewelry cleaner enhances the appearance of their jewelry. I know they can’t 
afford my high-tech machinery to clean their jewelry, but what if I could pro-
vide them with a solution that would make their jewelry sparkle? And what 
if that solution allowed them to clean their jewelry at home when they’re 
unable to make it to my store?
I gained the knowledge of this opportunity from the many times my custom-
ers came in to have their rings cleaned. The comments they made after I 
had cleaned their rings helped me identify an unmet need. Here’s where the 
evaluation comes in:
 
✓ Product feature: My customers could use this product to keep their jew-
elry clean and shiny. I recognized that the innovation of jewelry cleaner 
would meet a need that currently was unmet for my customers. I knew 
my consumers would enjoy a product that was cost-effective, portable, 
and as effective as if they had it done professionally.

251
 Chapter 14: Unearthing New Market Opportunities
 
✓ Product benefit: Customers can use this product in the comfort of their 
own homes when they can’t make it to the jewelry shop. I knew that by 
providing my customers with the benefit of convenience and the ability 
to keep their jewelry looking its best, they would see this as a valued 
benefit and purchase the product.
When you evaluate a product opportunity, you get the full view of the poten-
tial that the product opportunity carries with it. In the preceding example, I 
recognized a need and, within that need, an opportunity. I created the prod-
uct, satisfied the need of my customers, and increased my bottom line by 
generating additional sales of the jewelry cleaner.
Assessing whether new marketing 
activities will reach more folks
In order to seek out new marketing opportunities, you need to consider who 
you will market to and what methods will best reach your customers. Begin 
by identifying the opportunity as usual. Then evaluate the opportunity by 
assessing the following three factors:
 
✓ The external point of view, which is your consumer base: Identify the 
consumer that you’ll be marketing to. If you were to create a profile 
of this consumer, what would she look like? Also be sure that you can 
explain her buying patterns when it comes to your product.
 
✓ The internal point of view, which comprises product features and 
product types: Identify the product you’ll market and the features you’ll 
focus on in your marketing message to attract the consumer you’ve 
identified.
 
✓ Marketing operations: Identify the marketing methods and initiatives 
you’ll use to reach this consumer, and then determine how you’ll sched-
ule those initiatives.
 
You use the information you gather to determine whether you’ve identified a 
marketing opportunity that has potential for success. You use it not only to 
evaluate the consumer and the product you’re marketing, but also to deter-
mine the features the potential consumers will be interested in and the meth-
ods you’ll use to share your marketing message with them. You can use all 
this information to decide whether the product opportunity carries merit and, 
if so, how you should move forward in seizing that opportunity.
For example, suppose I have a lawn care company. I want to reach a new 
market, so I’ve gone through the process to identify who I’m going after and 
what initiatives I will use. I have a client base of more than 1,000 customers 
who I’m either servicing now or I have serviced in the past. I’ve never entered 
my customers’ information in a database, but if I did I could continually 

252
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
market to them. So, I’m going to create a database to house customer informa-
tion. This way I can stay in touch with my customers and remind them of my 
business, causing them to contact me for additional services. The opportunity 
I’ve identified is that by consistently marketing to my consumers, they’ll be 
informed of additional services that I offer and be reminded of when their 
maintenance services are due.
I evaluate the opportunity by assessing the factors as follows:
 
✓ External: After I create my database, I’ll send out postcards reminding 
my customers of the services that I offer during the winter — such as 
snow removal. Snow removal is an added service that many of my cus-
tomers would enjoy if only they knew about it. I can use the database to 
continue to market to my existing consumer base and gain more recur-
ring and additional business from them.
 
✓ Internal: I can monitor my marketing efforts internally by tracking who 
contacts me. Doing so allows me to determine whether the postcard 
method of marketing produces new business. If my postcard method 
works, I can use this to gauge what services my current consumer base 
is interested in. It will also help me in determining whether I should con-
sider additional services.
 
✓ Marketing operations: By implementing a new database, I can determine 
peaks of growth in my business and evaluate whether any of my market-
ing initiatives are working better than others. I can use this information 
to gauge the peak times of specific services that I offer. I also can use 
this information in the future to market to new consumers during those 
peak times.
When identifying new opportunities in marketing, I can gauge not only where 
and to what my consumers are most likely to respond but also when my ser-
vices are needed most. The benefit of this opportunity is that it keeps me in 
front of my current customers and enables me to remind them of additional 
services at the appropriate times. Even though I didn’t enter into a new 
market, I did introduce my consumers to products or services I provide that 
they may not have been aware of. The goal is that this marketing opportunity 
will increase my business with my current customer base and will hopefully 
help with my referral business as well.
Determining Whether a New Opportunity 
Is Worth Pursuing
After you discover a new opportunity that you may be able to tap into, you 
must assess whether there’s a need for that specific product or service in 
your marketplace. It doesn’t matter whether you’re contemplating a new 

253
 Chapter 14: Unearthing New Market Opportunities
product or a current product; when entering a new market, you must ensure 
that you’re launching into an untapped market with little or no risk.
 
You need to consider attributes to each market segment that you’re contem-
plating. Entering a new market sometimes can seem like a no-brainer, but it’s 
still always a good idea to weigh the risks with the perceived benefits. In this 
section, I show you how to do just that.
Evaluating an opportunity’s 
chance of success
Before entering a new market, you need to assess the opportunity’s chance 
of success. Luckily, you can follow a simple process to determine approxi-
mately how successful you’ll be when entering a new market. You can mea-
sure the potential success of an opportunity and how solid the opportunity 
is by looking at the needs the opportunity meets and the problem the oppor-
tunity solves, and identifying those who would be interested in the solution 
that the opportunity provides. All three of these things are important when 
analyzing and measuring the strength and potential success that the opportu-
nity presents.
To assess the opportunity, answer the following questions and then number 
them in order of importance. The importance is ranked according to which 
answers give the opportunity strength.
 
✓ What are the needs within the opportunity?
 
✓ What is the problem that creates the opportunity?
 
✓ What is the opportunity for you based on the needs and the problem?
After you answer the questions, weigh them by what’s most important 
when evaluating the opportunity. If the problem is stronger than the need, 
the opportunity can still represent strength. That’s because it could simply 
represent that consumers aren’t aware of the need; they just know that they 
have a problem that they aren’t sure how to solve. The ultimate goal in this 
exercise is to be able to walk away with a clear understanding of the viability 
of success when it comes to the opportunity you’ve selected.
Weighing the costs against 
the potential rewards
Moving into untapped markets means that you must make some business 
evaluations to ensure that you’ve done your homework. Doing so ensures 
that you’re prepared to take on the extra work and competition in order 

254
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
to make the opportunity a success. After you determine whether your new 
market is a viable source for your business, you need to consider whether 
you can fulfill — and will benefit from fulfilling — the needs of that market. 
You need to evaluate the following:
 
✓ Your competitive advantage: Make sure that you have the competitive 
advantage in cost, growth, and price.
 
✓ Internal company functions and procedures: Make sure that your com-
pany house is in order. You need to be able to handle the new functions 
and procedures that entering this marketing will entail.
 
✓ The characteristics of the new market you’re targeting: These charac-
teristics may differ greatly from your current market, so make sure you 
take the time to evaluate and understand the characteristics within that 
new market.
 
These are business evaluations that you must make in order to determine 
whether you’re ready to enter the market from a business perspective. The 
following sections tell you exactly what to evaluate. Use this information to 
tie up any loose ends and take note of what it is that you need to do to be pre-
pared before entering the market; otherwise you may experience devastation 
from an operation standpoint.
Sizing up the competition you’re working against
If you can be first into an untapped market, opportunity can easily abound. 
On the other hand, if you find current competitors in the market you’re con-
sidering, you’ll have more issues to evaluate.
 
If you enter a new market unaware of the competition that will greet you, 
you’re asking for sudden death of your business. Before entering a new 
market, evaluate the following:
 
✓ Number of competitors: If you find only a few competitors, it may more 
than rationalize your market entry. You may also find that it can be less 
expensive to steal existing consumers than to try a new approach.
 
 If, on the other hand, you find that a large pool of competitors exists in 
the market that you’re entering, it’s extremely important to have ben-
efits that will stand out to consumers and persuade them to purchase 
from you. If they can’t distinguish a difference between you and the com-
petition, success won’t come easy in this market. Differentiation is key 
when it comes to competition.
 
✓ Number of products and services that will be required to effectively 
compete in the market: If you’re adding a new product to serve a need, 
remember that consumers love one-stop shopping and the value of full 
service — those features create loyalty with consumers. The same is true 

255
 Chapter 14: Unearthing New Market Opportunities
when it comes to services: The more that consumers can do in one place, 
the more consumer loyalty you’ll gain. Consider the retail stores that 
have now added groceries. They moved into this niche to create not only 
increased sales but also loyalty from the consumers that shop with them.
 
✓ Competitors’ marketing techniques: It’s not uncommon for new 
entrants into a current market to be greeted with competitive marketing 
tactics by businesses that are already established in the marketplace. 
For example, be aware of pricing levels when you enter the market and 
then continually monitor price changes. You may come across competi-
tors who drop their prices in order to keep consumers away from the 
new competitor in the marketplace.
 
✓ The amount of time it will take you to get into the new market: 
Product life cycles represent a sequence of stages that a product fol-
lows, starting with the introduction of the product to the time that sales 
of the product begin to decline. It’s important to understand timing 
because life cycles can sometimes last only a few months and then the 
demand for the product begins to decline. (Flip to Chapter 18 for more 
on product life cycles.)
 
If you’ve found an untapped market, it won’t be long until one of your competi-
tors also notices the opportunity. One more thing: Untapped markets gener-
ally don’t go unnoticed. The fact is that some companies just won’t take the 
risk to enter them, because when they do it can often take too long and some-
one else breaks into the market. So be sure to evaluate the time it will take you 
to enter the market, and then decide if it’s soon enough to gain market share 
within the market.
Speculating about the effects on your business
Just because you’re entering a new market doesn’t mean you’re free to 
neglect the current bread and butter of your business. Be sure to find out 
how the new market will correspond with your current business resources. 
Then determine whether you can absorb the additional costs to effectively 
compete within the new market. You must be able to use current resources 
without putting your current business at risk.
When you’re studying the effects that entering a new market would have on 
your current business, be sure to keep the following issues in mind:
 
✓ Money: When entering new markets, you need money in order to com-
pete successfully. You need funds to develop, market, and launch your 
product or service. It isn’t uncommon for businesses to enter new mar-
kets and promptly go bankrupt because they didn’t keep their costs in 
mind. So be sure you know your costs before you even begin to count on 
the revenue the new market may produce.

256
Part IV: Crafting Your Marketing Strategy 
 
 Have a clear picture of each of the following costs to ensure that you 
can cover the extra weight until the revenue of the new market begins to 
trickle in:
 
• Product development costs
 
• Marketing costs
 
• Operations costs
 
• Customer service costs
 
✓ Relative profitability: You have to run the numbers in order to deter-
mine the profitability of your new venture. Determine whether your 
return on the investment of entering the new market will be greater than 
your initial cost.
 
 It’s proven to be less costly to grow profits from customers within an 
existing market than it is to pursue new customers in new markets.
 
✓ Ease of distribution: You need to consider whether your potential 
market will fit with your current distribution structure. If not, you may 
face additional costs. Consider whether you’ll need a different location 
and how you’ll deliver products to your new market.
Eyeing consumer tendencies within the market
You must evaluate how your current consumer base will perceive your new 
market entry. You don’t want to give up your current market share, so you 
must protect it. To begin, define and evaluate your existing consumer base 
and its perceptions on all strategic moves. Then you can protect market 
share by developing new products, improving your customer services and 
distribution effectiveness, and reducing prices.
 
It’s also important to evaluate consumer loyalty. However, don’t focus solely 
on consumers’ loyalty to you. Consider also their loyalty to the competitors 
within the new market. Every market has a varying degree of consumer loy-
alty, often depending on the number and quality of the competitor products 
and services. So be sure to determine whether consumers within the market 
that you’re evaluating have well-established relationships with current com-
petitors. If you find that they do, create a plan to gain their loyalty.

Part V
Implementing Your 
Strategy with a 
Marketing Plan

In this part . . .
I
n this part’s chapters, you embark on a journey 
through the implementation process. I begin by taking 
a look at marketing ethics and explaining what your 
responsibility is when it comes to upholding those ethics. 
Then you dive in, discovering how to get consumers’ 
attention by effectively positioning your product or ser-
vice to your target market. I help you create positioning 
strategies and draft your positioning statement so you get 
your message across to your consumers.
The second piece of the implementation process is under-
standing how to educate your consumers about your 
products and services. Your goal is to persuade your con-
sumers to choose your product or service over others. 
You do this by drafting your marketing message and 
choosing the right marketing vehicles to reach your target 
market.
The third part of the process is new product adoption. I 
show you how to increase your chances of consumers 
adopting the new products that you introduce as well as 
any changes to your current offerings. You find out what 
holds consumers back and how you can drive them for-
ward in adopting change. Last but not least, I show you 
how to encourage repeat buying and customer loyalty — 
not just customer satisfaction.

M
arketing ethics impact both the consumer and your business. So you 
must build trust with your consumers in the marketing system. In 
other words, you need to market your products appropriately and for their 
intended and promoted uses. Ethically, your responsibility is to use adver-
tising that isn’t deceptive or misleading. You’re expected to embrace, com-
municate, and practice ethical values that improve the confidence of your 
consumers.
In this chapter, I help you understand the importance of marketing ethics and 
explain how deceptive marketing practices affect consumer behavior. I also 
show you your ethical responsibilities and how to create your own code of 
ethics.
A Primer on the Role of 
Ethics in Marketing
Having a set of ethical standards in marketing helps you do the right thing 
regardless of your product or market sector. You use these standards to 
identify acceptable practices, foster internal control, and deal honestly and 
fairly with consumers. Ethical marketing is an approach to marketing in which 
businesses set high ethical standards and communicate those standards 
positively.

Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
As a marketer or business owner, it’s your responsibility to accept the conse-
quences of your marketing activities and make sure that the decisions you 
make and actions you take in marketing satisfy the needs of your consumer 
and the needs of society.
Exploring the fluidity of marketing ethics
Ultimately, you must follow your own code of ethics and gut instincts on 
many issues. There’s a list of issues marketers are legally responsible 
for abiding by (I discuss them in the “Recognizing a Marketer’s Ethical 
Responsibilities” section, later in the chapter). Two of them, however, create 
the most criticism from the public and possible legal action: product harmful-
ness and consumer vulnerability. These two issues are often intertwined.
When it comes to ethics, most public criticism occurs when marketing strate-
gies target vulnerable consumer groups with harmful products. For example, 
a brewery targeting segments that have a large proportion of consumers with 
alcohol addiction and problems might be considered unethical.
However, the definitions of “harmful” and “vulnerable” are up to the interpre-
tation of the individual. For instance, one person may think that by market-
ing fast food, companies are simply increasing the obesity problem that we 
face in the United States. However, that school of thought is arguable. After 
all, other folks feel that fast food is less harmful when not consumed in large 
quantities and when individuals exercise regularly.
Similarly, most people would agree that children, undereducated consum-
ers, and elderly consumers would be considered vulnerable. But at the same 
time, others would disagree with these categorizations. There are now laws 
that affect children and marketing, whereas with seniors that isn’t the case. 
As you can see, it’s difficult to come to a complete agreement on both prod-
uct harmfulness and consumer vulnerability.
As if the explanation of what is and isn’t ethical weren’t fluid enough, it’s 
important to also remember the importance of intent when settling on a ver-
dict of “ethical” or “unethical” behavior. There’s a difference between simple 
marketing mistakes and truly unethical behavior.
 
Unethical marketers intend to act negligent, manipulate consumers, and gen-
erally do harm to others. Average marketers, on the other hand, may simply 
make an innocent mistake that only appears unethical. For example, consider 
a company that produces children’s toys. It releases a toy, markets it, and 
introduces it to consumers. The consumers love it and begin to purchase the 
toy. After two months of being on the market, however, a defect is noticed and 

261
 Chapter 15: Understanding Marketing Ethics
the company recalls the toy. In this case, the company didn’t intentionally put 
this toy onto the market knowing it was defective and could cause harm to 
the consumer. Instead, it was an innocent mistake. But if this company knew 
that a defect was present in the product and it still introduced the product, it 
would have an unethical case against it.
In order for a business to cross the boundaries from ethical into unethical 
behavior, it must be aware that an action will be considered unethical. Then 
it must act with deviance to cover the true intent of the action. In other 
words, the business doing the marketing must know that the actions are 
considered inappropriate and carry through with them anyway. However, in 
order to prove that an action is unethical, it must be proved that there was 
intent to mislead the consumer. Proving intent isn’t an easy thing to do.
 
There’s a difference between marketing ethics and actual laws. Marketing 
ethics represent rules of conduct that have been put into place to protect the 
interests of consumers. However, if you market in a way that breaks actual 
laws, you’re in for legal issues. These written laws have been approved and 
are enforced by the government in order to protect consumers. The labels of 
right and wrong are dependent on personal perspectives, morals, ideals, and 
cultures. It’s a different story when a company breaks laws and violates the 
trust of the consumer, however.
Understanding how unethical marketing 
affects consumer behavior
Unethical marketing behavior affects the emotions, attitudes, and percep-
tions of consumers, whether it happens to them directly or they just hear 
about it. Consumers often feel the impact when they experience a lack of 
trust or a feeling of disbelief in regard to marketing. Then they’re hesitant 
to purchase. You’ve probably heard the phrase “If it’s too good to be true, it 
probably is.” Well, it’s just my guess, but you have to wonder whether a con-
sumer who had experienced unethical marketing coined that phrase.
When businesses begin to take advantage of consumers, consumers lose, 
businesses lose, and society as whole eventually loses. Many people believe 
that the ethical treatment of consumers is the basis of a fair and just market-
place. After all, when trust is violated, value perceptions held by consumers 
are harmed, and they may stop making purchases. And when a business 
misrepresents a product, consumers are led to expect more than is actually 
delivered. At that point, an unfair exchange results. A fair value exchange, on 
the other hand, results when consumers, business owners, and marketers act 
with good faith, complete disclosure, and trust.

262
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Consider an example where a business knowingly deceives a consumer. In 
this example, a water filtration company salesperson knowingly contaminates 
a water purity test by adding certain minerals to a water sample. The con-
sumer is alarmed by the poor quality of his water and the harm it may cause 
to his family, so he decides to buy a filtration system from that company.
The act of this one salesperson could have a detrimental effect on consum-
ers, other employees, the business’s hometown, and even the employee 
herself. For example, consider what would happen if that consumer later 
discovered that the water test was knowingly tainted. He would complain not 
only to the company but also to the Better Business Bureau. If the word got 
out that the salesperson acted unethically, the company could go out of busi-
ness. Employees would lose their jobs, storefronts would suddenly become 
vacant, and consumers would be left with unnecessary products.
Discovering how ethics affect the 
four Ps of the marketing mix
Because all areas of the marketing mix can be brought into question and 
construed as unethical by consumer groups, it’s important that you use the 
tools in your marketing mix carefully. Marketing practices that potentially 
raise problems of ethics are associated with all four of the marketing mix 
variables: pricing, product management, promotion, and placement. (If you 
need a refresher, you can read more about the four Ps of marketing strategy 
in Chapter 3.) You can counteract the predisposed problems consumers may 
have by using these variables to identify and educate consumers, thereby 
building their trust and confidence in you. In this section, I examine each of 
these areas separately.
Pricing
Pricing is one of the most visible elements of the marketing mix, and so pric-
ing policies are constantly questioned by consumers. And when a consumer 
believes that prices are unfair, she’s likely to leave the business and spread 
negative information to other consumers regarding that business.
It’s also common for consumers to complain about marketing efforts that 
lead to overall higher prices. For instance, a company that pays millions of 
dollars for a Super Bowl commercial will often face criticism from consumers 
and push back on price. Marketers use the “price” as a statement of value 
received from an offering that may or may not be monetary; it’s important 
that consumers see that same value.
 
An unethical use of pricing is to state that a regular price is a sales price. This 
practice is actually prohibited by law as well.

263
 Chapter 15: Understanding Marketing Ethics
Products
The largest ethical concern regarding the product portion of the marketing 
mix is whether the products are harmful to the consumer or to society as a 
whole. Products can often lead to short-term consumer satisfaction, but they 
also may lead to long-term problems for both the consumer and society.
 
The failure to disclose that a product won’t function properly without neces-
sary components is unethical.
Generally, products fall into four categories pertaining to social responsibil-
ity; these categories represent how long a consumer expects the benefits of 
the product to last:
 
✓ Deficient products: These products have little to no potential to create 
value of any type. An example might be a faulty appliance. Obviously 
you want to avoid offering products that are considered deficient.
 
✓ Salutary product: These products are good for both consumers and 
society in the long run. Salutary products offer practical value, but they 
don’t provide pleasure value. For example, vehicle air bags have great 
value, but they don’t necessarily provide pleasure or entertainment.
 
✓ Pleasing products: These products provide pleasure value to consum-
ers, but they can be harmful in the long run. For example, consumers 
enjoy cigarettes and alcohol, but these products obviously can be harm-
ful to your health and the health of others.
 
 The pleasing products category is usually the one where ethical issues 
come up. But it’s important to realize that individual responsibility and 
freedom are important factors when it comes to the consumer’s deci-
sion to use these products.
 
✓ Desirable products: These products deliver high practical value along 
with pleasurable value. Plus they help consumers immediately and have 
long-running benefits. An example is weight-loss products, which give 
consumers immediate results by curbing their appetites. When used cor-
rectly, these products have the long-run benefit to consumers of losing 
weight.
Promotion
As marketers we use promotion to communicate a product’s value through 
techniques such as advertising, sales promotion, and word-of-mouth market-
ing. Unfortunately, many times consumers believe that products are pro-
moted in ways that are “too good to be true.” This creates skepticism and a 
decline in trust toward the promotional message.
 
Promoting an item as being on sale and then informing the consumer that the 
product is out of stock and that a more expensive item should be bought is 
unethical. This practice, which is known as the bait-and-switch method, is pro-
hibited by law.

264
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Placement
Placement refers to how you distribute a product through the various chan-
nels of delivery. Placement becomes a concern to consumers when they’re 
worried about how or where they’ll get their product.
 
If you limit product availability in certain markets as a means of raising prices, 
you would be acting unethically.
Recognizing a Marketer’s 
Ethical Responsibilities
Marketing ethics consist of societal and professional standards of right and 
fair practices. These standards are expected of marketing professionals as 
they develop and implement marketing strategies. The problem with ethics 
as it pertains to consumer behavior is that not everyone agrees on what 
behaviors should be considered unethical.
Some ethical marketing issues lend themselves to strict law and are now 
cut-and-dried legal obligations; other issues, however, aren’t so clear-cut. 
The broad definition of marketing ethics leaves a lot of room for subjective 
interpretation. In fact, you can define marketing ethics as the determination 
of how much tolerance one has for actions that take advantage of others. 
Because this represents a gray line, it’s important to adhere to sound ethical 
principles.
 
Some issues crop up time and time again in the marketing industry, so I rec-
ommend that you avoid those issues entirely — even if they aren’t legislated 
and enforceable. Consumer perceptions of questionable incidents are impor-
tant; bad events can mean disaster for a business in terms of lost business, 
Theodore Levitt’s marketing contribution
In the 1960s, Theodore Levitt developed a mar-
keting concept, called marketing myopia, that 
brought a new marketing perspective to busi-
nesses. Levitt believed that businesses should 
define themselves in terms of the consumer 
needs that they solved rather than the products 
that they made. In other words, businesses 
should stop thinking of themselves as produc-
ing products and services and instead start 
doing things that would make consumers want 
to do business with them. This concept is still 
taught today and used by businesses. However, 
Levitt’s marketing concept has raised a problem 
for companies that produce such products as 
fast food, tobacco, alcohol, and gambling sup-
plies. Many people target these companies and 
criticize them for marketing products that some 
consider harmful.

customer boycotts, and bad publicity. In this section, I fill you in on your legal 
liabilities as well as the gray areas I recommend you do everything in your 
power to avoid.
Examining the requirements
Many years ago, companies simply didn’t listen to the voice of the consumer, 
especially in the early days of mass production. Instead, the focus was put 
on production efficiencies and cost per unit. In the 20th century, consum-
ers began to see a change, however. The collective consumer voice grew 
steadily, and the adoption of the Consumer Bill of Rights helped this con-
sumer movement even further. Various groups began to develop for the sole 
purpose of protecting basic consumer rights and focusing on consumerism.
The Consumer Bill of Rights, which dramatically changed how businesses 
viewed consumers, was introduced in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy 
and still stands today as the foundation of the consumerism movement. 
When President Kennedy introduced the consumer rights bill in a speech 
addressed to Congress, there were only four basic rights. In 1985, how-
ever, the United Nations endorsed Kennedy’s Consumer Bill of Rights and 
expanded it to represent eight consumer rights.
 
Consumers are legally protected by the Consumer Bill of Rights, and if they 
feel they’ve been violated, they can sue the company that violated them. The 
Consumer Bill of Rights includes the following rights:
 
✓ The Right to Satisfaction of Basic Needs: Consumers have the right to 
have access to goods and services that satisfy their basic needs, including 
food, water, public utilities, shelter, clothing, health care, and education. 
 
✓ The Right to Be Informed: Consumers have the right to information 
regarding your product. This information must be adequate enough for 
a consumer to make a knowledgeable and intelligent decision regarding 
the purchase and use of your product. Your product and service market-
ing communication must not be deceptive.
 
✓ The Right to Redress and Be Heard: Consumers expect to have the 
right to voice their opinions and complaints and be heard in order to 
have an issue resolved efficiently and in a responsive manner. So you 
need to have the appropriate process in place to address any com-
plaints. You also must be able to redress any grievances your consum-
ers may have about their purchases and receive a fair settlement. Your 
contracts should be written in good faith and should be honored.
 
✓ The Right to Choice: Consumers have the right to free choice, so they 
expect to have a variety of options available to them from different sources. 
They want to be able to select who they want to purchase from. This means 
you can’t force a consumer to purchase from you; they have the right to 
look elsewhere and buy elsewhere without being harassed or harmed.

266
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
✓ The Right to Education: Consumers have the right to obtain knowledge 
and skills that helps them make better purchasing decisions. You can’t 
withhold this important information from consumers.
 
✓ The Right to Service: Consumers have a right to expect that they’ll be 
treated with respect and courtesy and that they’ll be provided an appro-
priate response to any needs they have and any problems that they 
encounter from a product they’ve purchased from you. You can’t refuse 
a service to a consumer who has purchased something from you.
 
✓ The Right to Safety: Consumers can expect to be protected from hazard-
ous products or services that they purchase from you, particularly if 
they have used the products and services as they were intended to be 
used. You can’t sell or distribute dangerous products and services.
 
✓ The Right to Environmental Health: Consumers should be protected 
from devastating and harmful effects, such as air and water pollutants, 
that may be a result of marketplace operations. They have the right to 
live and work in an environment that doesn’t threaten their well-being. 
You must provide a safe environment for your customers to be in.
 
By fulfilling these rights and duties and using them as guidelines in your busi-
ness practices, you ensure that your business doesn’t engage in unintentional 
unethical practices. I suggest that you create a policy that represents these 
duties and rights, and then place this policy where it can be reviewed by con-
sumers and staff. The section “Developing Your Marketing Code of Ethics: Some 
Simple Guidelines,” later in this chapter, provides some guidelines to help.
Considering the gray areas
Many marketing practices are serious infractions and are legislated against in 
order to protect consumers (see the preceding section for more). Obviously 
these practices would be considered unethical. However, some issues aren’t 
universally labeled as unethical or illegal, but they commonly draw a lot of 
public scrutiny. Some may consider this type of marketing unethical, but is 
it? It’s a line that can become blurred very quickly. I explain some of these 
practices in the following sections.
Misleading with deceptive marketing
Deceptive marketing, also known as false or misleading marketing, tops the 
list of dishonest practices that aren’t illegal. Deceptive advertising is advertis-
ing that either contains or omits information that’s important in influencing 
consumers to purchase your product. If the advertisement is likely to mislead 
consumers, it’s also considered deceptive advertising.

267
 Chapter 15: Understanding Marketing Ethics
 
It’s important to understand the difference between deceptive marketing and 
puffery. Puffery is the practice of making exaggerated claims about a product 
and its superiority in the marketplace. Puffery differs from deceptive market-
ing in that there’s no overt attempt to deceive a consumer. Instead, it’s an 
exaggeration about your product that’s purely false and represents an out-
right misrepresentation of your product. Puffery isn’t illegal, but it will dimin-
ish the trust consumers have in you. This loss of trust can haunt you in the 
future and affect the perception consumers have of you.
A popular tactic that marketers use is to advertise a product as being the 
“best” available. These claims are generally puffery. Are you concerned that 
you’re engaged in puffery? This general guideline may help you decide: The 
more detailed a claim is regarding your product, the more it must be sup-
ported by practical evidence. For example if you claim that “consumers 
prefer your restaurant two-to-one over the competition” you would need to 
be able to support that claim with evidence. If you can provide the data to 
back up the claim, you’re not engaged in puffery. If you can’t and the state-
ment is untrue, you’re guilty of puffing up your product.
Marketing to children (and other vulnerable consumers)
Children are considered to be vulnerable consumers because they lack the 
knowledge to behave as responsible consumers. As a marketer or business 
owner, you need to consider two issues when marketing to children:
 
✓ Children generally don’t understand that some marketing messages offer 
a less-than-literal interpretation of the world.
 
✓ The sheer quantity of marketing messages that children are exposed to 
can be called into question.
These are important issues to understand when it comes to how children are 
affected by marketing, because you can use them as guidelines when crafting 
an ethical marketing strategy directed toward children.
In October 1990, legislators passed the Children’s Television Act of 1990 to 
limit the amount of advertising to which children are exposed. The act limits 
the amount of commercial airtime during children’s programming to 10.5 
minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes on weekdays.
Some people argue that children today are growing up in a society that’s 
far too commercialized and that the messages children receive harm their 
psychological development and lead them to focus too heavily on material 
goods. Others, however, believe that advertising and marketing messages 
simply add to the socialization process in which children learn marketplace 
skills that enable them to function properly as consumers later.

268
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Expiring a product prematurely
Planned obsolescence is the intentional phasing out of a product before its 
usefulness truly wears out. The purpose behind planned obsolescence is 
to guarantee that consumers are forced to purchase the product multiple 
times. Obviously, this increases the demand for the product. Take, for 
example, video game consoles. The manufacturers of these products have 
been criticized for releasing new and improved systems even when older 
models haven’t been on the market for very long. The same is true for cellu-
lar phones.
Critics believe that it’s both wasteful and greedy for marketers to engage in 
planned obsolescence. By participating in this practice, you run the risk of 
irritating consumers and developing a bad reputation. Both can affect future 
sales of your product with consumers. Consumers often feel as if they’ve 
been burned if they’re required to make multiple purchases they didn’t plan 
for. In my opinion, participating in planned obsolescence isn’t worth the risk 
of losing customers or developing a bad word-of-mouth reputation, because 
these damages often can’t be undone.
What about social responsibility?
As a business owner, practicing social responsi-
bility is one way you can attempt to gain respect 
from your consumers. Your social responsibil-
ity is defined as your organization’s activities 
and status as it relates to societal obligations. 
In other words, your social responsibility is to 
make good decisions and do the right thing. 
You can use social responsibility to increase 
consumer awareness regarding not only your 
stance on ethics, but also your commitment to 
society. This leads to a positive perception on 
the behalf of consumers.
In recent years, businesses have experienced 
an increased pressure from consumer and 
media groups to be socially responsible in their 
activities. A few activities you can engage in to 
fulfill this obligation include:
 ✓ Making donations to causes of interest
 ✓ Supporting minority programs
 ✓ Ensuring responsible manufacturing pro-
cesses to protect the environment
 ✓ Taking action quickly when product defects 
are detected
 ✓ Focusing on employee safety
 ✓ Encouraging employees to volunteer for 
local causes
What does social responsibility have to do with 
consumer behavior and ethics? Socially respon-
sible marketing creates positive outcomes and 
is associated with more favorable consumer 
evaluations, increased consumer satisfaction, 
and the likelihood of more sales. This is espe-
cially true when a consumer identifies with the 
company and the causes it contributes to.

269
 Chapter 15: Understanding Marketing Ethics
Forcing artificial needs on consumers
It isn’t uncommon for marketers to be criticized for imposing what are called 
artificial needs on consumers. These so-called needs are discussed in ways 
that make consumers feel that they must have a certain product in order to 
feel or look a certain way. In the end, however, the real issue is that busi-
nesses cause people to want a product, even if they don’t truly need it.
In other words, many folks feel as if marketers and advertisements are 
responsible for leading consumers to confuse wants with needs. For example, 
does a consumer really need a 52-inch plasma, high-definition television? 
What about $175 tennis shoes when she can purchase a pair for $30?
 
The confusion between wants and needs is often brought on from marketing 
messages. Usually it’s because marketing campaigns make consumers feel 
inadequate if they don’t have a certain product. Instead of allowing the mar-
keting message to focus on the benefits to sell the product, it works to manip-
ulate the consumer into buying the product. Using these types of manipulative 
messages is unethical and causes the consumer to be confused and often 
regretful after making the purchase.
Developing Your Marketing Code of 
Ethics: Some Simple Guidelines
Finding the balance between consumer protection and market freedom can be 
difficult. So how can you put your marketing ethics to the test and ensure that 
you’re doing what’s best for the consumer as well as what’s best for growing 
your company? It’s tough, but it can be done by creating a marketing code of 
ethics, which is simply a list of explicitly stated rules and codes of conduct 
when it comes to the ethics of marketing. Many organizations have a code of 
ethics; one such organization is the American Marketing Association (AMA).
 
The following guidelines are standard marketing ethics that can be used to 
help you make socially responsible decisions as you market and grow your 
business:
 
✓ Put your consumers first and consider the effects of their actions on all 
involved when using your product and services.
 
✓ Base your marketing standards on actions and go beyond the required 
laws and regulations to uphold those standards.

270
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
✓ Be responsible for the means and marketing vehicles that you use to 
achieve your desired goal. It isn’t enough to simply focus on profit and 
motivation alone.
 
✓ Invest the time to focus on training your employees in ethical decision 
making.
 
✓ Embrace and publicize a core set of ethical principles that you will 
uphold as a business.
 
✓ Adopt an orientation and training program that leads to an appreciation 
of how marketing decisions affect all appropriate parties.
 
✓ Specify the protocols for ethical decision making within your business.
 
✓ Determine your company’s policy toward attack advertisements and 
confrontational marketing.
 
✓ Stay clear of state and federal pricing guidelines by limiting price guar-
antees in your advertisements.
 
✓ Consider attaching legal requirements for disclaimers to your business 
ethics policy as you develop marketing campaigns.
 
✓ Detail permissions of marketing material that targets vulnerable popula-
tions in your ethics policy.
 
✓ Submit every piece of marketing copy for an extensive editing process to 
avoid breaking your ethics policy.
 
For businesses that want to gain an edge on their competition, marketing 
ethics can be difficult to stick to. With that said, however, you need to protect 
your business and your products by developing a marketing ethics policy. The 
previous guidelines can help. This policy can help you avoid ethics issues and 
keep the business of loyal customers.

Chapter 16
Evoking Awareness 
through Positioning
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know the basics of positioning
▶ Putting together your positioning strategy
▶ Creating a positioning statement
A
 challenge related to consumer behavior is the perceived value of your 
products and services to your customers. Consumers don’t always 
accurately perceive the value that’s being offered. And when a consumer 
doesn’t believe that the product will deliver the value she desires or doesn’t 
perceive the product in the way it’s intended, she won’t make the purchase. 
Your job, then, is to figure out what the consumers in your target market 
need and want and then determine what you have to offer, what benefits you 
provide, who your competitors are, and how you’re different from those com-
petitors. You use this information to create a positioning strategy and state-
ment, which are tools you can use to reach out to your targeted consumers, 
identifying, communicating, and differentiating your company and products 
from your competition.
In this chapter, I show you how the concepts I cover in Parts II and III begin 
factoring into your marketing strategy. I begin by explaining what the process 
of positioning entails. Then I introduce you to some time-tested positioning 
strategies and guide you in figuring out which one is best for you. I cap off the 
chapter with guidance on putting your strategy into a concise statement that 
guides the rest of your marketing strategy.
A Primer on Positioning
Positioning is the act of creating a unique identity for whatever it is that you’re 
selling and then targeting a segment of the broader market by fitting your 
product or service to that segment’s wants and needs. Positioning works for 
anything you’re promoting, whether it be a product, service, or company.

272
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
The act of positioning requires a two-part process: devising a positioning 
strategy and creating a positioning statement. The positioning strategy is a tool 
that guides all your marketing communication, ensuring that you’re integrat-
ing your position in all the parts of your marketing strategy. Positioning allows 
you to create a market-focused statement of value, otherwise known as your 
positioning statement — a simple, clear statement of why your target market 
should buy your product.
Understanding the importance 
of positioning
Positioning represents the way you present your company and your products 
to your consumers. It works to create a perception within your consumers 
regarding who you are and what you offer. Positioning gives the consumer 
a unique statement of value that he can consider when it comes to making 
a purchase decision; without this statement of value a consumer can only 
judge what you offer by the price tag your product or service carries.
 
The goal of positioning, then, is to design products and services and present 
them to consumers in a way that occupies a meaningful and distinctive com-
petitive position in your consumer’s mind.
Knowing what you’re positioning
Generally speaking, there are two things you can position: your product and 
your company. Here’s a quick explanation of each:
 
✓ Product positioning is the straight comparison of the features of a prod-
uct. When working to position your product, you need to base that posi-
tioning on what the product can actually do for the consumer. This type 
of positioning also goes for services.
 
✓ Company positioning, on the other hand, deals with the perception a 
consumer has in regard to the entire company. It’s similar to product 
positioning, but the objective is to create and transfer an image of the 
entire company rather than of one product.
When positioning a company, you have less control over the outcome, 
because you can’t provide immediate influence to your consumers like you 
can with your product and its benefits. Instead, you have to work harder 
to create the desired perception of your company and what your company 
stands for. If you position your product for the consumer — and you do it 

273
 Chapter 16: Evoking Awareness through Positioning
correctly — your consumer likely will decide to purchase your product. In 
that case, you will have done all the company positioning that you need to 
do. For that reason, I recommend that most readers stick to product position-
ing and let the company positioning happen naturally.
 
Company positioning becomes extremely important when a company is trying 
to go public or position itself for acquisition. While the value of corporate mar-
keting is perception, it’s important to keep in mind that most companies are 
judged by their products, not necessarily by their name recognition.
 
You use different tools depending on whether you’re positioning your com-
pany or a product. When positioning your product, you use marketing through 
various channels, including advertising, personal selling, and sales promo-
tions; when you’re focusing on positioning your company, you use publicity 
efforts and public relations. Just remember that positioning is really the same 
discipline either way. The difference is in “what” you’re positioning rather 
than “how” you’re positioning it.
Getting a glimpse of the 
positioning process
In order to successfully position your product or service to your target 
market, you must do two things:
 
✓ Identify your target consumer as precisely as possible.
 
✓ Understand how that target consumer makes her buying decisions. For 
example, are her decisions based on frustrations, attitudes, values, chal-
lenges, likes, or dislikes?
These two things help you guide consumers (through both your positioning 
strategy and statement) to relate the benefits of your product or service to 
their needs. After you have a handle on the preceding two concepts, you begin 
the positioning process. The positioning process involves these three steps:
 
1. Differentiate your product from its competition by crafting a unique 
selling proposition (USP).
 
 Before you can position your product or service to your target market, 
you need to have a solid handle on what that product or service offers 
to the folks who buy it. Identifying your unique selling proposition means 
finding something meaningful and unique to say about your product 
offer that competitors either can’t or won’t say — and then presenting 
this difference to the consumer in the form of a proposition. Your USP

Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
represents the very core of what it is that you’re offering; it can be an 
actual fact or just a perceived difference or specialty. It focuses on the 
key benefits or attributes of your product, service, or company.
 
 You can have different USPs for products, but you should only have one 
USP for your company.
 
2. Use your USP to address a common problem among consumers.
 
 Consumers purchase solution-positioned products. So, determine how 
your product or service solves their problem, makes their life easier, 
and saves them money.
 
3. Articulate the solution and the value of your product to the consumers 
by creating your positioning statement.
 
 When a consumer tries to derive meaning from your message, com-
prehension occurs. Comprehension is the process where meanings are 
assigned to the stimuli. Of course, you want consumers to comprehend 
and interpret the information in the way you intended, but this isn’t 
always the case. A consumer can encounter the same stimuli, but yet 
comprehend it in different ways. So, articulation of your position is 
crucial — it’s your job to help consumers understand what you’re offer-
ing to them and why they should care.
 
A positioning map, or what some call a perceptual map, is a useful tool for plan-
ning your position relative to your competitor’s position (see Figure 16-1). It 
helps you map key attributes of your and your competitor’s product, service, 
or business. Start out with a basic positioning map containing a graph that 
has two points: one being high quality and the other on the opposite side of 
the graph representing low quality. Rank yourself and your competitors on 
the graph based on the perception of consumers. Doing so enables you to see 
where you stand with your competitors from a positioning standpoint. If you 
want to get more detailed, which I often suggest, list in the graph the benefits 
and features that your product contains. Then rank your competition by doing 
a comparison of how your competitors are viewed and how you’re viewed by 
consumers.
As you can see in Figure 16-1, Competitor A provides a high-quality product, 
but at a high price. Competitor B offers a product that is of lower cost and of 
lower quality than Competitor A, and Competitor C ranks the lowest on all 
points. Compared to the competitors’ products, yours is of high quality — 
not the highest, but it does rank above two of your competitors — and you’re 
able to offer it at a lower price, giving your consumers a better value than the 
competitors. These factors enable you to position better quality above two 
competitors and a better price above your third competitor.

Developing a Unique Selling Proposition
As I mention in the preceding section, a USP is the one statement that singles 
you out from the competition — it identifies the benefits your product or 
service offers. Why is it important to know the benefits of your products and 
services? Consumers buy based on how the product or service benefits them. 
So if they aren’t educated in the benefits you offer, they won’t buy from you. 
As such, your USP should be emotional; it must link your consumer to a uni-
versal motivator whenever possible. You can do this by making an offer or a 
proposition to the consumer, stating what benefit he will obtain if he engages 
in some type of action with you, such as a trial or purchasing your product. 
Think of your USP as the philosophical foundation of your business — don’t 
market without it!
 
You can incorporate your USP into your slogan, but the USP doesn’t neces-
sarily serve as your slogan. It’s helpful to create your slogan by using your 
USP, because the USP solidifies your position in the marketplace. Remember, 
though, a slogan and a USP have slightly different goals: Your slogan simply 
needs to be memorable, but a USP must clearly differentiate you from your 
competition.
This USP development process takes time, but it also saves you time in the 
future and gives you a statement that you can build your business around. 
The fantastic news is that after you’ve written your USP, your advertising and 
marketing copy will practically write itself. Think of all the time you will save 
in the future!

276
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Starting with the fundamentals: 
Features versus benefits
Before you create your USP, it’s important to understand the difference between 
a feature and a benefit. A feature is a product or service characteristic; a benefit 
is an outcome or result associated with using the product.
 
The easiest way to identify the benefit of your product is to take a feature 
from your product and extract the benefit to the consumer. A great test is to 
ask yourself what the product means to the consumer. If you can’t come up 
with an answer, it’s a feature. If you do find an answer, you’ve just identified 
a benefit.
As you can see from the following list, the features attract consumers, but the 
benefits “sell” consumers and get them to purchase your product.
 
Product 
Features 
Benefits
 
Lotion 
Moisturizes skin 
Stops the itching and discomfort
 
Toothpaste 
Tastes great 
Stops cavities and whitens teeth
 
Internet service 
Reliable 
You’re always connected with no 
 
 
 
downtime
The features of a product appeal to the logical side of the consumer; your 
benefits appeal to the emotional side of the consumer. And here’s how they 
work together: Consumers make an emotional decision, and then they create 
a logical argument in order to justify that decision. However, with that being 
said, keep in mind that in a business-to-business relationship, consumers 
focus more on the features than the benefits. That’s because the purchase is 
made more in response to logic than emotion. (Refer to Chapter 21 for more 
tips on business-to-business marketing.)
 
When creating your USP, remember that consumers are sold by the benefits of 
a product. If you sell them on benefits, you can worry less about the price.
Previewing the process
When creating your USP, you need to keep two things in mind. First, you 
must identify your consumers’ pain point — their unfulfilled need — in 
order to create an emotional connection with them. Second, it’s important 
to remind them that your product or service eases that pain for them. In 
this section, I walk you through both steps in order to help you create a USP 
that’s effective and gets the consumer’s attention.

277
 Chapter 16: Evoking Awareness through Positioning
Step 1: Touch the pain point
In touching a consumer’s pain point, you’re lending urgency to your market-
ing message. Consumers won’t act unless they feel an urgent pain that they 
need to remedy. So, as bad as it sounds, you have to use your marketing mes-
sage to rub salt into the wound before presenting your unique solution.
Suppose my target market wants to lose weight. The pain point in this situa-
tion is the feeling of frustration with their current state of being and the expe-
rience of failing to find a sufficient remedy to fix the problem once and for 
all. Individuals who have tried weight-loss programs without success feel like 
they have failed. Additionally, many people are embarrassed about starting a 
new program in public. In my USP, I address that need, and in my marketing 
efforts, I’ll find a way to touch the pain point to awaken consumers’ attention.
Some of you may be thinking, “I just sell lip balm. I can’t make anything of 
all this pain talk.” Think about this way: If you’ve ever had chapped lips, you 
know that it’s a painful experience. You keep licking them, it’s difficult to eat, 
and it feels like the skin on your lips is being stretched to capacity. Your con-
sumers must feel the pain in order to make the purchase. It can be a physical 
pain, an emotional pain, or even a pain because they continually run out of 
time. You must look at your product from the perspective of your potential 
consumer. Why do they care about your product?
Step 2: Explain how your product or service eases the pain
If you identified your market’s pain point or problem, but your product or 
service doesn’t provide a solution to that problem, you may as well find a 
new business or target market. If your product or service does provide a solu-
tion, your task is to present that solution in simple but compelling terms.
 
You must identify the benefits of your solution, and determine how those 
benefits will improve your consumers’ lives and situations. Reflect on how the 
benefits of your product relieve the pain and suffering they’re experiencing. 
Consumers don’t know your product like you do. So, you must tell them what 
your product will do for them and why they should buy it.
Say, for example, that your target market consists of folks who want to lose 
weight, and that you’re offering an innovative online weight-loss program 
they can use in the privacy of their own homes. You even offer a money-back 
guarantee if consumers aren’t satisfied. Your top three benefits in this situa-
tion are as follows:
 
✓ You’re providing your target market with a weight-loss program that 
provides hope and diminishes the pain of being overweight.
 
✓ Your buyers can use the program within the privacy of their own homes, 
which diminishes the embarrassment pain point.
 
✓ Your buyers get a win-win incentive — they either achieve satisfaction 
or get their money back.

278
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
All the benefits that you claim regarding your product must be 100 percent 
true. You must be able to prove any statement you make about a product ben-
efit to your consumer. If you can’t, ditch the benefit, because it will only create 
future mistrust in consumers and risk of negative word-of-mouth marketing 
that will be difficult to recover from.
Making sure your USP is effective
In the previous section, I walk you through the steps of developing your own 
USP. Now I want to share with you a few examples of effective USPs:
 
✓ Dominos Pizza: “We deliver hot, fresh pizza in 30 minutes or less or 
it’s free.”
 
✓ M&Ms: “Melts in your mouth, not in your hands.”
 
✓ Burger King: “Have it your way.”
These USPs are concise, specific, descriptive, and easy to remember. Can you 
create a USP that’s just as effective? To create your own effective USP, follow 
these guidelines:
 
✓ Be unique. If your USP is unique, it will set you apart from your 
competitors.
 
✓ Be specific. You want your USP to be specific enough that consumers 
understand it and the benefits you’re offering. If your USP isn’t specific, 
you run the risk of consumers not being clear on what your proposition is.
 
✓ Be succinct. One of the biggest mistakes companies make when develop-
ing their USPs is that they’re too wordy. Your USP must be a concise, 
one-sentence statement. In fact, the best USPs are so perfectly written 
that you can’t change or move even a single word. Each word in your 
USP should sell your product or your service.
 
✓ Make sure you can deliver on your promise. If you can’t deliver on 
your promise, don’t risk your reputation on it — it isn’t worth it. Instead, 
develop a USP that you can deliver, and be sure to stand behind it.
 
✓ Offer proof. Your consumers are already skeptical of the claims that 
businesses make, so by providing them with proof to back your prom-
ise, you’re ahead of your competition. Proof can be testimonials, white 
papers, or success stories of past customers. (Refer to Chapter 17 for 
more information on using testimonials in your marketing message.) For 
example, it’s a great idea to offer a guarantee to your consumers to sup-
port your claims.

279
 Chapter 16: Evoking Awareness through Positioning
Using Your USP to Develop 
a Positioning Strategy
The key to positioning is understanding the factors that consumers use to 
compare you against your competitors and then make a purchase decision. 
After you have a handle on consumer perceptions, you need to select the 
best positioning based on the benefits that you offer consumers and then 
take steps to align the marketing program behind this positioning choice.
You can manage positioning by focusing your marketing activities on a posi-
tioning strategy. Pricing, promotion, channels of distribution, and advertising 
should all maximize the positioning strategy of your company and product.
Positioning is represented by what the consumer believes about your prod-
uct’s value, features, and benefits. The trick is to identify key attributes of 
your company, product, or service to show its value, features, and benefits. 
This section helps you do that.
Positioning your product or service 
relative to its competition
Positioning with differentiating characteristics of your product will help you 
to stand out from the crowd of products that are similar to yours. You can 
differentiate your product or service in three ways:
 
✓ You can position directly against a competitor. You do this by claiming 
that your product is better than your competitor’s. In today’s market 
an effective positioning strategy focuses on specific competitors. This 
approach is similar to positioning according to product benefit, but in 
this case the competition is within the same product category.
 
✓ You can position yourself away from the competition. This strategy is 
useful if you can’t compete with the competition because it’s a strong 
and well-established player. To position away from the competition, 
look for consumer needs or market niches that position you elsewhere. 
Doing so helps position you away from the competing noise.
 
✓ You can position yourself according to type of benefit. This strategy of 
positioning has to do with positioning your product against others. The 
product categories aren’t exactly the same, but the products all provide 
the same class of benefits. An example would be the positioning of air-
lines, trains, and buses. They don’t provide the same means of transpor-
tation, but they do provide the same service — transportation.

280
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Different differentiation strategy options allow you to create a variety of 
approaches geared toward targeted consumers. These approaches can be 
based on specific characteristics of each targeted group. For example, you 
have different differentiation strategies for specific demographics, house-
hold structures, or cultures. The strategies you create could focus on what’s 
important to each group instead of having a “one-size-fits-all” strategy.
 
The best way to determine how many strategies you need is to evaluate who 
you’re targeting and what’s most important to them. If you find that your con-
sumers have different pain points or unfulfilled needs, it may be best to try 
different differentiation strategies. If your targeted consumers have the same 
needs, you can simply focus on one differentiation strategy.
In the following sections, I focus on the process of creating a differentiation 
strategy as well as on what factors you can use to differentiate your product 
or service.
The process
You need to do the following in order to make the development of your differ-
entiating strategy go smoothly:
 
✓ Define the criteria your consumers use to evaluate products that they 
buy. This will help you in knowing what criteria are important to your 
consumers and how you can use those criteria to differentiate your 
product or service.
 
✓ Identify your product’s key benefits in customer terms. Consumers 
make purchases based on benefits, so it’s important that they can iden-
tify what your benefits are and that they have the information necessary 
to differentiate you from your competitors. Do you offer a better price, 
better customer service, or a better product? If so, you want to be clear 
about that with your consumers.
 
✓ Identify your competitor’s position. You can’t differentiate from your 
competitors if you don’t have a clear understanding of their position in 
the marketplace. Evaluate where they stand on quality of product, price, 
and service and then determine where you’re different.
 
✓ Identify your competitive strengths. It’s important to have an under-
standing of your competitors’ strengths so you can be aware of where 
they may stand out or fall behind in comparison to you. Doing so allows 
you to be prepared.
 
✓ Select a position that gives you a unique and sustainable competitive 
edge. You can use all the preceding information to determine the posi-
tion you must create with your consumers and against your competi-
tors. You must then take that information and create a statement that 
stands out to your consumers and gives you the competitive edge.

281
 Chapter 16: Evoking Awareness through Positioning
The factors you can differentiate with
Differentiate yourself by identifying what your product does that others can’t 
or don’t. You’re looking for the most persuasive, meaningful, and unique dif-
ference that your competitors can’t claim. You can differentiate yourself by 
using these four factors:
 
✓ Price: You want to evaluate what your price is compared to your com-
petitors. Is it higher or lower? One risk you take when differentiating 
due to price is that price isn’t difficult to change. Plus, while some con-
sumers will purchase based on price, most spend more time evaluating 
other differentiating factors such as benefits or service.
 
✓ Focus: You can differentiate yourself by using your focus. For example, 
are you specialized in a particular area? Are you viewed as one of the 
experts in an industry? Consumers often purchase from companies that 
they feel are experts or specialized in an industry rather than companies 
that are more generalized.
 
✓ Product/service: You can differentiate by using your quality of product 
or the benefits that you offer. How do they stand out from among your 
competitors? What benefits do you offer that they don’t? Why is your 
product of better quality? These are the things that a consumer pays 
attention to before they look at a price tag. Differentiating a product 
from its competition is a bit different from differentiating a service. For 
example, if you’re differentiating a product, you may want to focus on 
these common factors:
 
• Design
 
• Durability
 
• Reliability
 
• Reparability
 
• Style
 
• Customer 
consulting
 
• Customer 
training
 
• Delivery
 
• Installation
 
• Ordering ease
 
 On the other hand, suppose you’re marketing a service. You may want 
to focus on the following common factors:
 
✓ Customer service: You can differentiate by the customer service that 
you provide. How does it compare to the competition? Do you promise 
service within a certain span of time? How do you follow up with con-
sumers? Consumers take service very seriously and if you can show 
them how you stand out from among your competition, they will pay 
attention.

282
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
You can certainly differentiate yourself in more than one category, but you 
need to make sure that you focus on the one that contains the most compel-
ling benefit for your targeted consumers. The best way to differentiate 
between you and your competition is to know your target and pick a blend of 
differentiation categories that truly sets you apart. And remember that your 
differentiation is about the consumer, so speak in terms that show the benefit 
to them.
Addressing the need your product fulfills
After you’ve differentiated yourself, you must use the information you gained 
in the differentiation process to address the concerns and needs of the con-
sumer. Determine what problems your product or service addresses: Are you 
saving consumers money, time, or energy, for example? They don’t care if 
you have the best packaging or if they can find you in every discount store. 
They want to know what you can do for them personally.
 
This step is truly all about the consumer. It’s about first positioning your prod-
uct by addressing a problem and then being the solution to that problem. You 
can focus on one of the following factors as a positioning strategy in this step:
 
✓ Product attributes: Attributes often include price, quality, features, style, 
and design of your product. The attributes are specific to consumers and 
are often the basis for making a purchase decision. Many times a product 
can be positioned in terms of two or more attributes simultaneously.
 
✓ Usage occasion: When using this strategy, you work to position your 
product with a specific use or application. For example, you might say 
something like “This stain stick can be used when trying to get a stain 
out of clothes.”
 
✓ Users: With this strategy, you associate your product with a particu-
lar user or group of users. For example, “This hands-free headset is 
designed for users of cellular phones.”
In order for your positioning strategy to be effective, you must bring an ele-
ment of differentiation to the table when you’re clarifying how your product 
or service meets consumers’ needs. The following positioning strategy guide-
lines will help you address the needs of your consumers most effectively:
 
✓ Important to the consumer: It must deliver a high-valued benefit to a 
sufficient number of consumers.
 
✓ Distinctive: Ideally your product isn’t offered by a competitor. If it 
already is, at least ensure that the product is offered in a way that’s 
extremely distinctive so it stands out.

283
 Chapter 16: Evoking Awareness through Positioning
 
✓ Superior: Show what makes your product superior when compared to 
the competition. In other words, show consumers that you help them 
obtain not only the same benefits as the competition, but also even more.
 
✓ Communicable: The difference between your product and your com-
petitor’s must be communicated and visible to the consumers.
 
✓ Preemptive: The difference can’t be easily copied by your competitors.
 
✓ Affordable: Your consumers must be able to afford your product and be 
able and willing to increase their cost if your product is more expensive 
than your competitor’s.
 
✓ Profitable: You must be able to make a profit by introducing this 
difference.
In order to gain competitive advantage, you want to use the strategy that 
proves true with the majority of the preceding factors.
Avoiding common mistakes
 
You want to avoid the following common positioning errors, because they can 
cause consumer confusion and cause a negative perception of your company 
and the products that you offer:
 
✓ Underpositioning: You know that you haven’t positioned enough 
when your target market only has a vague idea of the product you’re 
promoting.
 
✓ Overpositioning: When you position too much, only a narrow group of 
consumers can identify with the product.
 
✓ Confused positioning: If you haven’t been clear in your positioning, 
consumers can have a confused image of the product. It may claim too 
many benefits or the benefit claim may be changed too often.
 
✓ Doubtful positioning: Doubtful positioning occurs when consumers 
don’t believe the product’s claims in view of the product’s features, 
price, or manufacturing company.
You can take the following measures in order to avoid the errors I just 
discussed:
 
✓ Do clearly communicate that the product attribute you’re positioning is 
a benefit. Otherwise, it isn’t a benefit.
 
✓ Do make sure that the benefit you’re highlighting is important to the 
consumer. Otherwise, it isn’t important.

284
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
✓ Do help your consumers perceive that your company and your product 
deliver the benefit. Otherwise, it isn’t delivered.
 
✓ Do precisely define your target consumers. Otherwise, you could miss 
them completely and they won’t know that the message is meant for them.
 
✓ Do include the reason that consumers should believe the benefit prom-
ise. Otherwise, it may not be clear to them what benefit you’re promis-
ing them.
 
✓ Don’t attack the leaders of competing companies. This only distracts 
from your message and the value that you bring to the consumer.
 
✓ Don’t fall into the “everything” trap. In other words, don’t try to be all 
things to all people. Doing so only waters down your message and dimin-
ishes its strength.
 
✓ Don’t forget what has made you successful. Consumers love to hear suc-
cess stories and endorsements that they can depend on.
 
✓ Don’t position by using attributes that lack work or are unimportant. 
This will only take away from those important attributes that you want 
to be known for.
 
✓ Don’t position by mimicking equality with your competitors. You must 
stand out in order to be remembered and to make consumers want to 
purchase from you. Equality isn’t enough; you must offer them more to 
gain their interest and appeal directly to them.
 
✓ Don’t list multiple differentiators and benefits. You want your benefit 
statement to be singular. Otherwise, it may confuse your consumers.
 
✓ Don’t develop benefits that aren’t unique or sustainable. It’s the benefits 
that sell a consumer. If you don’t offer them anything unique or sustain-
able, they’ll see no reason to purchase your product.
Crafting a Strong Positioning Statement
After you develop a positioning strategy and determine the problem that 
needs to be addressed, you have to take all that information and create your 
positioning statement. This is simply a no-nonsense statement of how you 
want your products to be perceived in the minds of your target market. Your 
positioning statement provides direction, and it focuses on your products 
and their position in the marketplace.
 
Your positioning statement is a great tool that can be used when you need a 
short description of who your company is or what products you offer. I like to 
think of it as a “fingerprint” that creates a perception in consumers, because 
it informs them of your company and products. It informs consumers of who 
you are, what you do, and why you’re different and beneficial to them.

285
 Chapter 16: Evoking Awareness through Positioning
Using a simple but effective formula
The key to creating an effective positioning statement is to remember that 
it isn’t about what you do, but rather it’s about the benefit you offer to your 
target market and the difference between you and your competitors.
When it comes to positioning statements, I like to use a special formula. It 
looks like this:
(Product, company, service, person) is the one (category of your product) 
that provides (the target customer) with (product’s key benefit) because 
(reason they should believe that your company can deliver the benefit).
Here’s a positioning statement that’s created from the previous formula:
Dazzling Toothpaste is the only toothpaste that provides kids with a fruity 
flavor that protects them from cavities because it was specifically formulated 
by the #1 rated pediatric dentist.
 
Do you feel that creating this statement is difficult? It’s okay. The truth is that 
positioning statements are rarely correct the first time. You must create and 
then rework them to ensure their effectiveness. You may also want to solicit 
the help of others to brainstorm your positioning statement. These sessions 
are especially helpful if you’re feeling stuck.
Paying attention to word choice and focus
Because your success depends on your positioning statement, you shouldn’t 
take lightly the task of creating one. Your statement should
 
✓ Be short and to the point: By short, I mean your statement should be 
12 words or less. However, you don’t have to count the product name. 
Using concise words helps keep your word count down.
 
✓ Use simple and clear language: You want to use simple and clear 
language so that your statement is understood by consumers with no 
chance of misunderstanding. It’s especially important to avoid jargon.
 
✓ Be adaptable to various media types: You must be able to use your 
statement in different forms of media, such as Web, radio, television, or 
print, in order maintain consistency.
 
✓ Be a compelling statement of one important benefit that your product 
presents: Benefits sell consumers, so your positioning statement is more 
powerful when it represents an important benefit that your product 
offers to consumers when they use it.

286
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
✓ Serve as a conceptual statement, not necessarily a copy from a com-
petitor that didn’t put in much consideration or thought: Your posi-
tioning statement must be powerful. If you create one without much 
thought, you won’t receive the perception you desire.
 
✓ Satisfy four evaluation criteria: It should be unique, believable, impor-
tant, and useable. Why? Because these are the things consumers use to 
evaluate and create perceptions of companies and products.
Testing your positioning statement
After you create a positioning statement, you need to put it to the test. You 
test the statements to ensure that they make sense to your target market and 
will create the desired perception within your consumers. You also want to 
make sure that they will ultimately help in selling your product.
 
I like to test positioning statements by reading them out loud and then asking 
myself the following questions:
 
✓ Does my positioning statement contain a promise of an important con-
sumer buying advantage?
 
✓ Does my statement give a clear differentiation between my product and 
my competitor’s product?
 
✓ Is my company name or the name of my product ingrained in my posi-
tioning statement?
 
✓ Is there an inherent understanding of what my statement is saying to my 
consumer?
How did you do? If you answered “no” to any of the previous questions, you 
need to go back and rework the statement. If you answered “yes” to all of 
them, your statement is all set to be put in motion — you can now use it in 
your marketing message. It is also a great tool that you can use when creating 
your marketing collateral and campaigns in order to ensure that all market-
ing messages are consistent and effective. You will also want to share it with 
others within your company so that everyone understands it and is able to 
share it with potential customers.

B
efore you can persuade a person to purchase whatever you’re selling, 
you have to get that person’s attention. You attract attention to your 
product or service just like you attract attention to anything else — by engag-
ing any one or more of your target consumer’s five senses: sight, smell, taste, 
touch, or sound. When you place a stimulus along your target’s path, you 
engage a sensation that requires the consumer’s immediate response to the 
information he has just encountered.
After you grab the consumer’s attention, you then have to educate him about 
your product by sharing with him information and advice on how your prod-
uct or service can help him save money, find more time, and improve his 
daily life. You educate consumers by using brochures, pamphlets, seminars, 
or other publicity events. Any time you can provide consumers with infor-
mation on how your product fulfills their needs can be seen as an educating 
opportunity.
You must understand your consumers in order to reach and educate them 
effectively. So in this chapter, I show you how to present your products to 
consumers and educate them at the same time. I also help you decide where 
to put your message so it reaches your target market. I have found that if you 
look at marketing as a tool to educate your consumers, you can actually end up 
answering their objections as well as increasing their chances of purchasing.

Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Getting Consumers’ Attention 
with Compelling Stimuli
Consumers can be motivated by marketing stimuli, such as product, price, place, 
or promotion. However, sometimes your stimuli may need to go a little deeper to 
gain a response, such as psychological, personal, social, or cultural stimuli.
 
Just because a consumer is exposed to any old stimulus doesn’t guarantee 
that she’ll pay attention — after all, a consumer can’t pay attention to all the 
stimuli she’s exposed to! For this reason, positioning (see Chapter 16) is key 
when it comes to consumer perception. You have to use the stimuli that con-
sumers in your target market will notice and respond to. The stimuli that will 
work depend on what your consumers need and what they want. (Chapter 5 
talks all about perception and stimuli you can use.)
To determine which stimuli to use and how to get your desired response, you 
really have to dig into the makeup of your targeted consumer and her indi-
vidual behavior. The consumer you’re targeting in one culture may not have 
the same needs as another consumer in another culture. The same goes for 
consumers in different household structures.
Marketing research can show you what motivates your consumer and can 
assist you in deciding what stimuli to use. To find out what it is that triggers a 
response from the consumers that you’re targeting, you have to take the time 
to do the following:
 
✓ Ask your consumers questions to elicit the information you need.
 
✓ Study your competitors to determine what they’re doing.
 
✓ Delve into the consumption patterns of the consumers you’re targeting.
Delivering an Action-Inspiring Message
The stimulus that you use grabs the attention of potential customers, but 
your marketing message educates them on your product. Your message 
allows you to present your unique selling proposition, or USP, and any addi-
tional benefits in a way that consumers can understand. In fact, your mar-
keting message is critical to all your marketing efforts. An effective message 
combined with promotion draws in new customers. (Check out Chapter 16 
for more information on creating a USP.)
When drafting a marketing message, I think of it as a note on a piece of scrap 
paper. You must grab a customer’s attention quick — and hold it long enough 
to educate him with your message — or he’s likely to wad it up and toss it 

289
 Chapter 17: Leading Customers from Attention to Action
in the trash can. Your marketing message should speak to that prospective 
customer personally. You have to appeal to his hot buttons by understanding 
his wants and needs. His hot buttons trigger an emotional decision. And after 
a consumer makes an emotional decision, he justifies it by logic.
 
You need to create urgency in your marketing message. A consumer won’t act 
unless he feels an urgent pain that he needs to remedy. You have to use your 
marketing message to emphasize the pain and then present the solution. That 
solution must be backed not just by you but by former or current customers.
You also need to use your message to reverse any perceived risk that your 
potential consumer may feel regarding your solution. You must also position 
your solution as something that’s easily implemented and that will provide 
immediate relief. Creating and delivering an effective marketing message is a 
crucial step — so really spend some time on it.
Educating consumers with 
a marketing message
Education is seen as a value-add by most consumers. Taking the time and initia-
tive to objectively educate your consumers about the products or services that 
you offer builds trust and confidence. Consumers want to make informed buying 
decisions, so they need guidance on how to purchase your product or service.
You educate consumers by providing them with information about not only 
who your company is and how your products benefit them, but also by shar-
ing with them useful and easy-to-understand news about your industry. So be 
sure to stay informed and stay on top of trends. The key is to inform consum-
ers about why they need your product and how it benefits them. Then you 
can guide your consumers into the action they need to take to obtain your 
product or service.
 
Consumers want and have a need for information that helps them. If you can 
give them this information, you’ll create customers for life. The more informa-
tion you can provide consumers — without selling to them — the deeper the 
emotional connection you will make with them. They’ll feel that you genuinely 
care about their needs and that you want what’s best for them. They’ll believe 
that you aren’t just interested in making a sale.
You’re faced with opportunities to educate consumers on a daily basis. But 
don’t worry; educating them is easy. You can create informative articles and 
how-to brochures, conduct seminars, send out informative newsletters, or 
simply have a conversation with a consumer. I suggest that you create an 
education piece by answering the one question you’re always asked. Write 
about that question, providing information and guidance in an article, a 
brochure, or any other medium that educates your consumers in a way that 
builds the trust and rapport that eventually “sells” them.

290
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
When creating your educational marketing piece, it’s important to refer to 
your USP and your positioning statement as a guideline for the message. Even 
though you’re educating your consumers, it’s important to still share why 
you’re different from your competitors and why they need your products to 
fill their unmet needs. (Refer to Chapter 16 for more information on the cre-
ation of your USP and positioning statement.)
Providing proof customers trust
Consumers expect companies to be able to support and prove their claims. 
After all, providing proof creates a level of credibility. When a company can’t 
or doesn’t provide proof, a consumer may become mistrustful of the claim 
and the company, often causing the consumer not to purchase from that 
company. In order to avoid this situation, it’s important to have an arsenal of 
proof that supports your claims. This arsenal can include reviews, testimoni-
als, and case studies. I explain each in the following sections. Evaluate the 
information to decide which works best for you and your consumers.
Reviews by a third party
Reviews can be very useful in proving your claims, because third parties are 
the ones evaluating and reviewing your product or service. If your product 
or service stands up to the review process with raving results, you can show 
consumers that you have an outside party recommending it. A positive prod-
uct review can increase sales and build consumer trust. Reviews are often 
published on the Internet or TV or in newspapers or magazines.
 
Here’s the downside of reviews: If the product doesn’t stand up to your 
claims, you’ll have to activate immediate damage control in order to minimize 
negative publicity. Negative product reviews can diminish sales and create 
mistrust.
Reviews work well for products or services that provide immediate results 
that are visible to the consumer eye, because that’s what reviewers are look-
ing for.
Testimonials
Great components to your marketing message are accolades or testimonials 
from current or past customers you’ve helped in similar situations. Telling 
potential customers that you have a solution simply isn’t enough; you have 
to prove to them that your solution works. And the best way to do that is to 
use the voice of other customers who have achieved positive results by using 
your product. Consumers believe people who are similar to themselves.

291
 Chapter 17: Leading Customers from Attention to Action
The best testimonial is one that paints a before and after picture. A great 
product testimony follows this order:
 
1. Introduction of the problem
 
2. Presentation of the solution (your product)
 
3. Explanation of the result
A testimony following the previous formula may look like this:
While skiing in Colorado on vacation, I was hit with a severe case of 
chapped lips. It was difficult to eat or drink, and when the wind would hit 
my lips while skiing down the slopes the pain was excruciating. I purchased 
the L2 Lip Balm and experienced immediate relief. The pain disappeared 
immediately, and I was able to enjoy the rest of my vacation.
Case studies
A case study can demonstrate your benefits as well as illustrate proof of 
your claims. It does this by showing a detailed account of how your product 
or service solved a problem for a customer. Your case study should go into 
detail about your company, the industry you’re involved in, the key people 
within the company, and an account of a project over time that benefits from 
the product or service that you offer. Case studies are great for service-
oriented businesses or products that are used over time.
In order to use a case study to provide proof to a consumer, you need to 
thoroughly cover the project by discussing the objective of the project, the 
strategy you used, the challenges you faced, and the results you achieved. 
You also need to include in the study any recommendations you had during 
the project.
 
The problem with case studies is that they require a lot of upfront work. And 
while they can be beneficial, it’s often difficult to get consumers to take the 
time to read through them. Usually only very analytical thinkers who need to 
view a product or service from a methodological approach read case studies.
Perusing Your Options for Marketing 
Message Placement
After you have your marketing message drafted, you must decide what 
marketing media you should use. The marketing option that’s best for you 
will depend on the target market you’re trying to reach. After all, successful 

292
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
marketing is all about the needs of the consumer. For example, younger gen-
erations are generally more likely to appreciate marketing messages that are 
delivered via the Internet, radio, or television, while older generations may 
rely more on the telephone book and local newspaper.
Because you have many options to consider, the following sections give you 
a look at the pros and cons of each type: traditional and interactive. This way 
you have a greater understanding of which options may work best for you.
Traditional marketing options
Marketers consider the options in this category to be traditional because 
they use traditional forms of media, such as television, radio, and print 
advertisements. New ways of marketing have been discovered, but many 
companies swear that the traditional ways still produce the best results. In 
the following sections, I explore the pros and cons of the different traditional 
marketing methods.
Television
Television has been a popular method of advertising for large retailers since 
the TV set began appearing in living rooms. Because television allows busi-
nesses to reach smaller and more targeted markets, it has become a viable 
option for small and mid-size businesses as well the larger ones. Table 17-1 
shows the pros and cons you can expect from television advertising.
Table 17-1 
The Pros and Cons of Television Advertising
Pros
Cons
Reaches a larger audience in a shorter 
period of time than newspapers and 
radio.
Producing and airing television market-
ing can be expensive and eats up your 
marketing budget quickly.
Reaches viewers when they’re most 
attentive.
Quick changes are difficult; updating 
requires changing scripts and reshooting.
Allows you to use the benefits of 
sound, sight, and motion, giving your 
business a personality and instant 
credibility.
New technology allows consumers to 
fast-forward through advertisements, 
causing target consumers to miss your 
commercial.
Phone book
There was a day when everyone went to the phone book — specifically the 
Yellow Pages — to find vendors and service providers. Some consumer mar-
kets still go that route, but the number is diminishing. Many folks in today’s 

293
 Chapter 17: Leading Customers from Attention to Action
society are trying to be more environmentally friendly, and just about everyone 
else likes instant access, so most people tend to use the Internet more often 
than the phone book. Check out Table 17-2 for the pros and cons of using the 
Yellow Pages of the phone book to advertise.
Table 17-2 
Pros and Cons of Phone Book Advertising
Pros
Cons
Considered to be the complete sour-
cebook for business listings with 
telephone numbers.
Ads are listed among competitors, so pro-
spective consumers may be distracted by 
other companies in the same category.
Depending on the efficiency of your 
ad, consumers can learn a lot about 
your company.
Changing your ad is impossible; if it 
doesn’t work, you’re still stuck paying for 
the next 12 months.
Ads are generally listed by seniority 
in each category, so you can work 
your way up to a forward position.
Seniority can be trumped by bigger ads, 
so you may end up at the end of the line 
even if your company has been around 
a while.
Radio
Come on, who doesn’t love radio? Many people still listen to the radio on 
their way to and from work or errands even though cars are equipped with 
other audio devices. Radio advertising won’t be going by the wayside any-
time soon, but it still has some cons. Refer to Table 17-3 to discover both the 
pros and cons of taking advantage of radio advertising.
Table 17-3 
Pros and Cons of Radio Advertising
Pros
Cons
Quickly reaches a large number of 
people and allows you to narrowly 
define segments of your market.
Limits you to audio because visuals 
are obviously impossible.
Ads are easy to develop and relatively 
inexpensive (compared to television).
Listeners tend to scan stations in 
order to avoid commercials.
Enables you to reach additional audi-
ence segments and test new target mar-
kets rather quickly.
Requires multiple exposure spots in 
order to gain retention and exposure; 
consumers must hear a message 2 to 
6 times to remember it.
Can make you look bigger than you are 
when you consistently run ads during a 
concentrated period of time.
The clutter of advertisements on the 
radio can be high and your message 
may get lost.

Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Table 17-3 (continued)
Pros
Cons
Because station personalities have 
great rapport with their audiences, they 
can give you an implied endorsement by 
announcing your commercial.
Exposure is short; you have 30 sec-
onds to grab a consumer’s attention.
Can support your printed advertise-
ments, making them twice as effective; 
for example, you may say something like 
“Find our coupon in the Wednesday edi-
tion of the newspaper.”
Can’t be rewound or paused if mes-
sage is missed.
Allows the use of music and sound 
effects, which create a personality 
behind the message; this personality 
helps make your company memorable.
Radio stations typically cater to a 
much more selective audience than 
other mediums, such as television, 
because they exhibit a much more 
unique and tailored personality.
Billboards
Billboards and other outdoor advertising are viable for businesses looking 
to send a simple visual message that can be read in a matter of seconds. 
Because most billboards are concentrated in heavily populated areas with 
high traffic flows, your company or product is sure to be seen. Take a look at 
Table 17-4 to find out the pros and cons of advertising with billboards.
Table 17-4 
Pros and Cons of Billboard Advertising
Pros
Cons
Achieves extensive coverage of the 
market with high frequency.
Makes conveying your message diffi-
cult; it must be brief and simple enough 
to fit in large letters on a billboard.
Offers the largest print ad available 
and generates attention-getting power.
Prime outdoor locations are often 
controlled by long-time advertisers.
Provides around-the-clock exposure.
Becomes background “noise” to con-
sumers after they see the ad several 
times; they essentially become blind to 
it until a new ad is placed.
Allows you to target specific areas 
with your message by using different 
forms of outdoor advertising.
Creates great exposure but isn’t gener-
ally very memorable.

295
 Chapter 17: Leading Customers from Attention to Action
Interactive methods
Interactive methods of marketing involve the Internet. These methods allow 
you to interact with your potential consumer in real time, which supports 
the “right-now” mentality that has been created in our society. Consumers 
no longer like to wait; they want what they want when they want it. These 
methods also allow you to change a marketing method on the fly within a 
matter of minutes. You can track your potential consumer with greater detail 
than when using traditional methods of marketing. In the following sections, I 
explain each of the interactive methods you have to choose from.
Internet
If you ask me, I think all businesses need to have some type of online 
presence. After all, the Internet is becoming the Yellow Pages of today. 
Consumers use the Internet every day. So if you don’t have an online pres-
ence, potential consumers may be turned off by your absence and will find 
your competitor instead. Internet marketing has pros and cons just as any 
other method. See Table 17-5 for a list.
 
An Internet presence or Web site paired side by side with more traditional 
means of marketing can show consumers that you’re “with the times” and not 
stuck in the Dark Ages.
Table 17-5 
Pros and Cons of Internet Marketing
Pros
Cons
Acts as a low-cost promotional 
strategy.
Doesn’t build trust instantly; consumers 
have to rely on your message rather 
than physical evidence of your business.
Offers the ability to market globally 
because you aren’t limited to a par-
ticular location.
Puts you in tough competition with busi-
nesses and prices worldwide; you won’t 
be competing with your neighbor.
Reaches your target market quickly 
and easily (much faster than tradi-
tional marketing).
Allows you to use audio and visual 
tools to create an unlimited amount 
of information regarding your product 
or service.

Search engine marketing
If you want to be found online, you must participate in search engine mar-
keting. Search engine marketing, also known as SEM, is a form of marketing 
that uses the Internet to promote Web sites and increase visibility in search 
engine results so that online users can find you when searching for specific 
services or products. Search engine marketing is the process of getting your 
potential consumers to see your marketing message by driving them to your 
Web site or advertisement. If your services or your products aren’t found in 
the search engine results, online users won’t find you. It’s really that simple.
You can choose from two types of search engine marketing, including organic 
search engine marketing and pay-per-click search engine marketing.
Organic search engine marketing
Organic search engine marketing is natural visibility in search engine results; 
in other words, it doesn’t require you to pay per click to be listed. This type 
of search engine marketing makes your site popular with search engines like 
Google. When focusing on organic search engine marketing, you work your 
Web site in such a way that consumers find it on the first pages of search 
results rather than in the later pages.
In order to boost your ranking in the results, you have to pay attention to 
search engine optimization, which is a set of guidelines that helps you create 
the best chance of your Web site being found in the search engine results. 
You can find many books and Web sites to help you with this task.
 
Organic search engine marketing is theoretically free, and it sounds easy, 
right? Well, not exactly. If you aren’t familiar with search engine marketing 
from an organic perspective, you’re better off hiring a company that can take 
on the task for you. (But, of course, that costs money!) Organic search engine 
optimization takes a lot of skill and talent in order to get the results you 
desire. And unfortunately, search engine optimization can’t be guaranteed.
Check out Table 17-6 to see the pros and cons of organic search engine 
marketing.
Table 17-6 
Pros and Cons of Organic Search Engine Marketing
Pros
Cons
Delivers free traffic; because you aren’t 
paying a bounty for each click, visitors 
cost you nothing.
Takes time (at least 3 months) to start 
seeing results that are even close to 
the first page.
Provides long-lasting results; after 
achieving a certain ranking, it isn’t dif-
ficult to keep it (as long as you follow 
search engine optimization guidelines 
ethically).
Requires professional skill and tech-
nological expertise, and therefore 
costs money to get top rankings.

297
 Chapter 17: Leading Customers from Attention to Action
Pay-per-click search engine marketing
When you market using pay-per-click search engine marketing, you pay when 
a consumer clicks on your advertisements. This payment could be any-
where from $0.05 to $25, depending on the audience you’re marketing to and 
how strong the competition for that market is. This method is targeted and 
focused, but as you can see, it will cost you money — and possibly lots of it. 
Table 17-7 shows the pros and cons of this marketing method.
Table 17-7 
Pros and Cons of Pay-Per-Click 
 
Search Engine Marketing
Pros
Cons
Provides fast results — sometimes 
within an hour — for those who are in a 
hurry to be found in the search results.
Competition is tough, and as people 
catch on to this method, prices will 
go up.
Allows you to change things on the fly 
to cater your message to your target 
market; even though this method is labor 
intensive, you get up-to-the-second 
results of how your ad is doing.
Requires a steep learning curve, so 
you must gain as much knowledge as 
possible before starting out; or you 
may need to hire an agency that can 
help you or train you in the basics.
Makes creating a marketing campaign 
that gives you every chance at success 
easy; no guessing is required because 
you can use online tools to estimate your 
traffic and calculate how much you want 
to spend.
Affiliate / strategic marketing partnerships
Affiliate marketing partnerships and strategic marketing partnerships help 
you align yourself with businesses or individuals that serve the same target 
market that you do. These partnerships are popular online. To take advan-
tage of this method, you find a business that has a Web site that serves your 
target market, and then you pay that company a flat rate or a percentage of 
revenue that’s produced by a sale initiated by the business. Check out Table 
17-8 to see the pros and cons of these partnerships.

298
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Table 17-8 
Pros and Cons of Affiliate / Strategic 
 
Marketing Partnerships
Pros
Cons
Offers you a wider place to sell your 
products and services; the more 
Web sites that promote your prod-
uct, the more sales you’ll create.
Makes protecting your brand difficult; 
partners may not represent your brand 
correctly or in the way you’d like it to be 
represented.
Works as a low-risk, cost-effective 
method; if sales aren’t made, you 
don’t pay for the advertisement or 
marketing.
Causes you to lose control of your mar-
keting message and sometimes brand; 
you can monitor your affiliates and part-
ners, but doing so takes time that compa-
nies often don’t have.
Social media
Social media marketing is a fairly new method of interactive marketing, but 
it’s doing wonders for many companies. Social media marketing is the use 
of low-cost tools — typically Internet or mobile based — that are used to 
combine technology and interaction with the use of words and/or video to 
promote your products or services.
Social media is a great way to get to know your consumers; and even better, 
it enables them to get to know you. A few examples of these tools include 
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Digg. There are new social media marketing 
tools being introduced daily. The best thing is that the majority of them cost 
little to nothing to use. Table 17-9 shows the pros and cons of using social 
media as a marketing method.
 
Social media can serve as a product marketing channel, but it must be done 
properly. It’s all about the interaction — not only sharing but also listening. If 
your only interest is to market your product and not to interact with others 
involved in the social media marketing circle, I wouldn’t suggest that you use 
this method, because you may actually lose consumers rather than gain them. 
The effectiveness of social media marketing is based on your involvement and 
interaction.
Table 17-9 
Pros and Cons of Social Media Marketing
Pros
Cons
Provides you with great (uncensored) 
insight into what consumers really feel 
about your product or service.
Requires you to participate every day 
(and sometimes more depending on 
the topic of the day).
Builds your brand and visibility and 
allows you to provide information to 
potential consumers.
Results aren’t immediate because you 
have to build relationships first.

299
 Chapter 17: Leading Customers from Attention to Action
Pros
Cons
Requires no specialized technical skill, 
so it’s easy to use.
Brand control is lax; you can’t always 
control what is said about your brand, 
product, or service.
Costs you nothing but the time it takes 
to participate.
Choosing the Best Media Outlets for You
In today’s world of marketing, you have many media outlets to choose from. 
I always suggest choosing two forms of marketing: one traditional method 
and one interactive (or online) method. (You can read all about the many 
methods in the earlier section “Perusing Your Options for Marketing Message 
Placement.”) Mix it up and find what works for you in reaching your target 
market. If you drafted your message and know where to find your target 
market, you’ll see success. Benefit from trial and error, and then stick with 
what works for you.
Before you try an outlet, you need to determine which of your options meet 
your objectives. To know which outlets meet your objectives, you obviously 
have to know what your objectives are. For example, do you want to create 
awareness, gain new customers, or promote an event? You first need to 
determine your objective and then make a decision as to whether the market-
ing option you’re considering can achieve that objective. Choose only the 
marketing outlets that can meet your objectives. Doing so helps you narrow 
down your best marketing options. (Refer to Chapter 3 for more information 
on determining your marketing objectives.)
When selecting a marketing outlet, you want to evaluate how easy it will be 
for you to measure the results from that option. After all, it’s your return on 
investment that will be crucial when determining and spending your market-
ing budget. You never want to select a marketing outlet that doesn’t provide 
you with the capabilities to precisely track and calculate your results.
 
After you’ve rolled out your marketing campaign, you’ll know whether the 
outlet you have chosen is successful by the response that you receive from 
consumers. If consumers aren’t responding to your chosen media outlet, it 
may be time to revise your strategy or try a different outlet. Evaluate your 
message and make sure that the consumers you’ve targeted can relate to the 
message you’re sending them. Tweak the message if necessary to see whether 
you can get an increase in responses; if that doesn’t work, it may just be the 
wrong outlet. In that case, it may be time to try a new one.

After you determine which marketing options work best for you and give you 
the best return on your marketing investment, you can increase your invest-
ment and maximize your returns.

Chapter 18
Convincing Consumers to 
Adopt New Products 
or Changes in Terms
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the reasons consumers avoid change
▶ Understanding the product life cycle
▶ Helping consumers adopt new products or changes to products
W
hen you introduce new products or ideas to the marketplace, they’re 
initially only adopted by a small group of people. Only later are those 
innovations spread to other people — and even then not all of them survive. 
Some cultures tend to adopt new products more quickly than others. If con-
sumers don’t adopt your new products or the changes you make to existing 
ones, your sales will diminish and eventually you’ll no longer be in business. 
Growth only comes from consumer adoption. So in this chapter, I provide 
you with a deeper understanding of the adoption process and the product 
life cycle.
Realizing the Challenge: 
Aversion to Change
As you may know, 80 to 90 percent of new products fail. But why is that? The 
lack of new product adoption by consumers always has been blamed on price, 
but the truth is that consumers reject new products for many other reasons 
as well. New products often fail because of
 
✓ Failure to meet customer needs
 
✓ Poor timing

302
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
✓ Market conditions
 
✓ Ineffectiveness or inconsistent branding
 
✓ Technical or design problems
 
✓ Overestimation of market size
 
✓ Poor promotion
 
✓ Insufficient distribution
 
If the new product or service you’re selling offers significant improvement 
over its competition, or if a product or service you’ve changed (either in form 
or in terms) is an improvement over what’s been on the market until now, 
your task is to understand why consumers often reject new offerings that 
clearly provide them greater benefits than they’re currently enjoying. I help 
you understand the relationship between consumers and change in the follow-
ing sections.
How change affects consumers 
and their behavior
New products — or even just changes to a current product you’re selling — 
force consumers to change the way they do things, whether the change be an 
actual external behavior modification or an internal adjustment in attitude, 
intention, or motivation. (These internal changes are at times more difficult 
than a simple change of procedure.) Changes on the seller’s part often rep-
resent more than just changes in cost; they also include gains and losses for 
the consumer. If a new product has any chance at success, it must offer gains 
to the consumers; these gains include new benefits to be obtained or existing 
costs that can be avoided.
However, the problem with most new products is that while they may offer 
gains to the consumer, they also come with losses, which represent opportu-
nity costs of switching. The losses are often viewed by customers as existing 
benefits that they must give up or new costs that must be incurred.
 
These gains and losses represent a significant psychological switching cost for 
the consumer, and the majority of consumers are opposed to undertaking that 
type of switch. (Refer to the later section “Addressing issues consumers face 
during the adoption process” for more information on handling opposition.)

303
 Chapter 18: Convincing Consumers to Adopt New Products or Terms
What affects a consumer’s 
acceptance of change
Why are consumers hesitant to give up old benefits and often resistant to 
incur new costs when they’re either retaining the benefits they currently 
enjoy or gaining new benefits? The answer, like all things related to psychol-
ogy, is fluid. However, the influences that lead to resistance generally boil 
down to the following few fundamental truths:
 
✓ Humans are sensitive creatures. Chalk it up to the law of survival — 
people are poignantly aware of the concept of give-and-take. You can see 
this sensitivity clearly in almost any toddler; even though adults aren’t 
so uninhibited, the sensitivity remains — humans don’t like to lose 
things, and they sure do like to gain things. As a result, the greater the 
required changes, the greater the potential of resistance.
 
✓ What people perceive in the world is a response to individual refer-
ence points they hold. These reference points often come from culture 
influence or social groups that people surround themselves with.
 
✓ The bad outweighs the good. As individuals, people often focus more 
on the negatives of change than they do on the benefits that come with 
that change. It’s easier to remain the same than it is to modify behavior.
When you look at these three components you can see that the adoption of 
a new product is more about the adjustment a consumer has to make in the 
gains and losses of abandoning the current product that she’s using.
Say, for example, that I have a company called Grocery-Overnight, which sells 
groceries online. Leslie, who has been a consumer of mine for years, loves 
the convenience of shopping online and has enjoyed my company’s service. 
Unfortunately due to the higher cost of shipping, I must increase my shipping 
charge from $2.95 per order to $10.95. In order to absorb these costs for my 
consumers, I expedite shipping. Most consumers find this benefit worth the 
extra cost, but Leslie is a single businesswoman who doesn’t need the expe-
dited shipping because she plans her weekly menus in advance. The expe-
dited shipping is intended to be a benefit, but Leslie views it as a loss, and 
so I may lose her as a customer. She simply can’t justify the extra $8 to place 
her grocery order online — it doesn’t make economic sense to her. Going to 
the grocery store will be an inconvenience for her, but paying the $8 is an 
inconvenience that she sees as a bigger loss. So, Leslie won’t adopt my new 
enhanced product.
In the following sections, I expand on the three factors that lead to consum-
ers’ aversion to change.

Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
The human sensitivity to gains and losses
When you provide a consumer with a new benefit, it will be perceived as a 
gain; take away an existing benefit, and it will be viewed as a painful loss. The 
same is true for cost. If you reduce a current cost, it will be perceived as a 
gain; and if you impose a higher cost, it will be treated as a loss.
Suppose, for example, that a consumer finds a new dry cleaning service near 
his home. Not only is the service convenient, but it costs less than it did pre-
viously, when he had to drive 15 minutes to reach the nearest dry cleaner. He 
experiences a great deal of happiness, because the costs he’s used to paying 
for have decreased — therefore, he considers the change as gain.
Another man, however, has received notice that his television cable company 
will be increasing his cable rate and raising his monthly bill. His costs for the 
very thing he’s been purchasing for years have increased, so he counts the 
change a loss and experiences displeasure.
 
Regardless of the degree of change, the simple factor of whether a person per-
ceives the change as a gain or as a loss plays a big role in how he’ll respond 
to that change. The perception that a consumer has concerning a change in 
the product or service that you offer determines whether he will adapt to that 
change and often whether he will continue paying for your product or service. 
When you present your consumers with what they can view as a potential 
loss, you must balance it with something that they can see as a gain; otherwise 
you run the risk of losing their business, because the feeling of loss wins out.
One change, many interpretations: The role of reference points
The gains and losses a consumer experiences are evaluated with respect to a 
relevant reference point. Typically that reference point is represented by the 
individual’s status quo or current state of being. Additions to that individu-
al’s status quo are seen as gains, and subtractions from that state are viewed 
as losses.
Here’s an example: If status quo is represented by a consumer’s current 
state, and she goes out one Saturday to purchase a new car that’s an upgrade 
from her current vehicle, she’ll have a sense of gain. However, say that on 
the same Saturday, the consumer doesn’t purchase a new car. Instead she’s 
involved in an accident that destroys her current car. In this case she’ll feel a 
loss that she didn’t earlier that day before the accident.
 
It’s important to realize, however, that status quo isn’t the same across all 
individuals. Status quo comes from individual situations and perceptions. 
This is important to recognize because what one consumer may see as a gain 
another consumer may see as a loss.

305
 Chapter 18: Convincing Consumers to Adopt New Products or Terms
For example, take a look at the price of gasoline around the world. In France, 
I may pay $4 per gallon, and in the United States I may pay $2 per gallon. If 
the price of gasoline were to change to a universal $3 around the world, the 
French people would be ecstatic, while those located in the U.S. would see 
the change as a huge loss. People use the prices that they’re currently used 
to paying for their gasoline as reference points to determine whether the 
price of gasoline is a gain or loss to their status quos as a consumer.
The scales are tipped: Loss is heavier than gain
Consumers don’t treat comparable size gains and losses the same. Instead, 
losses seem to loom larger than gains. At times, losses outweigh the gains 
when it comes to adopting a new product. In other words, when a consumer 
is forced to give up a specific benefit, the loss creates significantly more pain 
than the pleasure that’s gained from a new benefit.
 
Research shows that losses are two to three times more painful than compara-
bly sized pleasurable gains. Why the imbalance? The reason boils down to an 
issue of value: Consumers value items that are in their possession more than 
they value items that aren’t in their possession. Behavior economist Richard 
Thaler labeled this theory as the endowment effect.
The idea behind Thaler’s theory is that when a person has possession of 
something (meaning he owns it), he tends to value it more. In fact, he may 
value it so much that if he were required to sell it, he would want to ask the 
buyer to pay more than it’s worth. For example, consider the vehicle that you 
own, and then ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ How much would you sell it for?
 
✓ How much do you think people would pay for it?
 
✓ How much would you pay for it if you saw it for sale at a car lot?
If the endowment theory is true, you would see your vehicle as being more 
valuable to you than it is to other people — that is, the amount you would 
want to sell it for is higher than the amount you would be willing to pay for it.
Tracing the Typical Life Cycle 
of a New Product
All new products — whether they’re original products, product improve-
ments, or product modifications — go through the product life cycle. You 
can apply the product life cycle to analyze product class, product form, and 
brands of product.

306
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
 
Fads, style, and fashion are three product areas that don’t necessarily follow 
the product life cycle. The reason they don’t follow this cycle is because they 
start off with a great deal of momentum, but then the interest of the consumer 
often diminishes just as quickly.
The product life cycle consists of the following four stages; however, remem-
ber that not all products go through each stage:
 
1. Introduction: During this stage of the product life cycle, a business 
seeks to build product awareness and develop a market for the product 
by using promotion. The need for immediate profit isn’t of concern in 
this stage.
 
2. Growth: The focus in this stage is on building a brand preference and 
increasing and stabilizing the market share. Competitors are attracted to 
the market, and they begin to offer similar products. At this point, prod-
ucts become more profitable because of the growth in sales and because 
companies form alliances and strategic partnerships to take each other 
over. Advertising and marketing spending is high during this stage.
 
3. Maturity: The growth in sales begins to diminish during this stage. A 
product that survived the first stages tends to spend the longest time 
in this stage. Sales are still growing, but at a much slower rate. Because 
more competition begins to appear in this stage, it’s extremely impor-
tant to differentiate your product. You may begin to notice that the 
market is saturated and that price wars and intense competition begin 
to occur. It’s common to begin to see businesses leave the market due to 
poor margins.
 
4. Decline: In this stage, you often see a decline in the market of the prod-
uct. This decline is often caused by the introduction of more innovative 
products. It also can be due to the changing tastes of consumers. You 
often see intense price cutting in this stage, and even more products are 
withdrawn from the market.
The product life cycle represents not only the life of a product, but it also can 
offer guidance in the way that you market, affecting sometimes differences in 
strategy and the method of marketing that you use. Sometimes a new market-
ing approach can breathe new life into your product life cycle. For instance, 
you may notice a breath of fresh air when you begin to evaluate your target 
market and consider entering a different segment with your marketing. Or, 
your marketing may be reenergized after implementing a new method, per-
haps going from television commercials to radio spots or going from a more 
traditional method to a more nontraditional method, such as interactive mar-
keting or social media marketing. These are all things to evaluate throughout 
the life cycle of your product. (Refer to Chapter 16 for more information on 
marketing methods that you can use.)

307
 Chapter 18: Convincing Consumers to Adopt New Products or Terms
Encouraging Consumer Adoption 
throughout a Product’s Life Cycle
As a business owner, it’s important for you to understand the adoption 
process that consumers go through when purchasing new products and ser-
vices. The adoption process is the psychological process that a consumer 
goes through to make a determination on whether to adopt a product. After 
you understand this process, you can help the consumer work through each 
phase, moving her closer to the final phase — adoption of your product. 
There are things you can do in each phase to increase the chances of con-
sumers adopting your products.
Consumers don’t adopt change at the same rate, so you use the five adopter 
categories to understand how and why consumers adopt innovations at dif-
ferent rates. In the last half of this section, I introduce the five categories as 
well as help you explore the characteristics of each category.
 
When a consumer evaluates a product, she’s confronted with an overabun-
dance of product attributes and choices. Her decision of whether to adopt a 
new product or a change in terms is based on the following:
 
✓ Level of prior use: This involves how much a consumer has used the 
product before the changes and how much she’ll use a new product 
after. The consumer evaluates the usability of the product that meets her 
needs. For example, if she’s evaluating a new shampoo, she would realize 
that she’d use this product daily. If the product is new or has changed, 
she’ll determine how that will affect her use and satisfaction with it.
 
✓ Involvement with the product: With this factor, consumers evaluate 
their involvement with the product. Their involvement either serves 
as a motivator or it acts as a deterrent in their adoption of the new or 
changed product.
 
✓ Understanding of the product offering: A consumer purchases products 
based on the benefits they offer. So, when evaluating a new or changed 
product, she must understand what benefits that product offers her.
Addressing issues consumers face 
during the adoption process
For consumers, deciding whether to adopt a new product is a process. A 
series of factors prompt them to consider their current condition and the 

308
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
alternatives that will improve it. You can use these factors to guide your con-
sumers to adopt your product by simply alleviating the roadblocks that may 
stop them from moving through the process.
You also have to provide information that meets their needs. The more 
helpful information they receive, the more inclined they are to adopt a new 
product. Lack of information, on the other hand, will detour adoption. Just 
remember that successful adoption of your new product depends on your 
ability to help consumers move through the process.
 
The rate of adoption can differ significantly among products. The rate often 
depends on five characteristic factors of the product. These factors determine 
how quickly a product is accepted by consumers:
 
✓ Communicability: One characteristic of quickly adopted products is a 
high rate of communicability. In other words, their benefits are easily 
communicated and understood by consumers. The best way to create 
communicability with your product is to make sure that its benefits are 
well known and easy to see. This communicability helps consumers 
understand why they need your product and makes them want to pur-
chase it.
 
✓ Compatibility: In order to get consumers to adopt a product, you first 
have to find out how well your innovation fits with existing traditions, 
cultures, values, needs, and past experiences. A product that’s compat-
ible with existing values of consumers will be adopted more quickly than 
one that isn’t. Take Quaker Oats, for example. When the company first 
introduced oatmeal, consumers were skeptical because they thought 
oats were for horses. (Refer to Chapter 13 for more information on seg-
menting your target market and identifying its needs and values.)
 
✓ Complexity: If a product is perceived as being complicated, consumer 
acceptance will be delayed. Consider computers, for example. When 
they were first introduced, they were perceived as complex and consum-
ers didn’t adopt them quickly. So, be sure to take the time to simplify 
your product in terms that consumers can understand. And remember 
that the more difficult a consumer thinks a product is, the slower the 
adoption rate will be. (Refer to Chapter 16 for more information on prod-
uct positioning.)
 
✓ Divisibility: Consumers prefer to try things on a smaller scale when 
they’re new. They want to be able to purchase a trial product before 
purchasing the full product. So, if at all possible, ensure that your poten-
tial consumers can try your products before buying. For instance, con-
sider the car dealer who allows consumers to test-drive cars over the 
weekend before making a decision to purchase.
 
✓ Relative advantage: Products that offer a significant advantage over the 
products they replace are often adopted more readily. A digital camera, 
for example, has a significant advantage over a disposable camera.

309
 Chapter 18: Convincing Consumers to Adopt New Products or Terms
 
All these characteristic factors play a part in whether your product is ever 
adopted and how quickly it is adopted. The more characteristics you can 
include in your product, the better your chance of success. Compare your 
product against each characteristic and evaluate how well it fulfills that char-
acteristic. If it’s missing the mark, it’s worth taking the time to evaluate how 
you can fulfill that characteristic better. After all, it really means success or 
failure when it comes to adoption.
Reaching the right consumers 
within your target market
Consumers generally fall into five categories according to how quickly they 
adopt new products and other changes. These categories are largely based 
on the personalities of consumers. You can use the adopter categories to 
understand that the customers who buy first are likely to be significantly 
different from those who buy the product much later. You can then use this 
information when working to develop your marketing mix.
Table 18-1 shows the five categories, along with a description of each and the 
percentage of the target market that they typically comprise.

Last to purchase; some never adopt the products at

The key point in how to use this information is this: You must know which 
category you’re targeting so you can understand that category’s needs. Even 
though you can’t cause a consumer to switch from one category to another 
(you certainly have the power to influence consumers, but you simply don’t 
have the power to change their personalities!), you can market to the specific 
needs of consumers in each category. You’ll find that you benefit the most by 
viewing each category as a static category that doesn’t change; however, what 
does change is their needs and how you can market to them.
 
People in each of these categories have different personality characteris-
tics, and each personality is comprised of the attitude that the person holds 
toward the adoption of a specific innovation. This attitude is what you want to 
use to gauge how to market to each category specifically. Here are some gen-
eral guidelines:
 
✓ Invite a select few innovators to participate in the development of 
your product, perhaps as a focus group. The reasoning behind this is 
twofold: First you develop a relationship with the innovators, and then 
as a result they will endorse your product.
 
✓ Involve early adopters by recruiting a few of them as trial partners. 
It’s important that in doing so you pay attention to the adopters’ feed-
back; be sure to evaluate and implement their suggestions. You also 
need to take time to reward these early adopters. Promote them as 
leaders and provide them with ego strokes; you can do so with media 
coverage or publicity. It’s important that throughout this process you 
maintain your relationship with these adopters, both by listening and 
providing feedback.

311
 Chapter 18: Convincing Consumers to Adopt New Products or Terms
 
✓ Attract members of the early majority with giveaways, lower costs, 
or performance guarantees. To do so, use only mainstream marketing 
and media publicity, because consumers in this group tend to associate 
those marketing methods with credibility. Also, keep in mind that you 
must keep things simple for these consumers. The benefits of your prod-
uct must be clearly communicated in order for them to purchase.
 
✓ To gain adoption from the late majority, focus your marketing mes-
sage on social norms rather than benefits. That is, show them how 
adoption of your offering enables them to identify with whatever group 
they’re in or desire to be in — their motivator for purchasing is a fear 
that they won’t fit in and that they’ll be left behind if they don’t pur-
chase. (See Chapter 16 for lots of group-specific guidance.)
 
✓ Give laggards a high level of control when it comes to the adoption 
process, meaning that they control when, where, how, and why they 
adopt your product. For this group, you must use your marketing mes-
sage to create a familiarity with the new product. It helps if they can see 
other laggards adopting your product.
 
 Turn your attention to the laggards only after you have hit the late 
majority category. The reason being that the consumers in the late 
majority category share many of their fears and often listen and respond 
to the criticism of the laggards when it comes to product adoption.
Working to create a marketing strategy that reaches out to each of these cat-
egories creates stability in the adoption of your product. Your product will 
mature just as your consumers and their behaviors will. For this reason, you 
must understand what category of consumers you’re marketing to in order to 
understand their needs and create a marketing message that appeals to them 
and causes them to adopt your product.
Offering strategic incentives according 
to the life-cycle stage at hand
The product life cycle provides a great timeline that you can go through 
when evaluating the growth of your products; your marketing efforts will 
be much more effective if you adapt them to the needs particular to the life-
cycle stage that your offering is in. For example, if your product or service 
is new, you need to consider what ways you can advertise or promote your 
product in order to gain awareness, which is the first stage. If your consum-
ers have an interest in a trial or desire to sample your product, how will you 
facilitate that?

312
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
If you’re changing a product or service you currently sell or are changing the 
terms associated with it (such as shipping costs), you need to consider how 
your customers will view that change. Then you use that information to create 
marketing strategies that address the concerns and challenges your custom-
ers may have with the changes. Your goal is to use these marketing strategies 
to help consumers with the gain or loss trade-off they may be feeling.
Figure 18-1 shows you a general representation of the merger of the product 
life cycle and the five adopter categories. The percentages shown in this 
figure reflect the approximate market size of each adopter group. Remember, 
though, that the product life cycle is just a guideline, not an absolute depic-
tion of every product’s popularity path. Not only can the length of each stage 
vary dramatically, but also the marketing actions you take can change the 
stage at hand. For example, you may go from the growth stage to the decline 
stage by hiking the price of your product when the market isn’t ready. So 
be sure to use the product life cycle in combination with your own market 
knowledge and intuition. (You can read more about the product life cycle in 
the earlier section “Tracing the Typical Life Cycle of a New Product.”)
Stage 1: Introduction
Your goal in the introduction stage is to establish your market and create a 
demand for your product. If you’re introducing a product in this stage that 
has no or few competitors, you’ll likely implement a price skimming strategy. 
With this strategy, a marketer sets a relatively high price for a product or ser-
vice at first, and then lowers the price over time. If your product does have 
competitors, you need to ensure that consumers can understand what dif-
ferentiates you from your competitor. You can adjust your marketing mix so 
that consumers are clear on the differentiation.
Consider the impact on the marketing mix during this stage:
 
✓ Product: Branding and quality level is established during this stage. 
Intellectual property protection, such as patents and trademarks, should 
be obtained now.
 
✓ Pricing: In this stage, you may use a low penetration price in order to 
build market share rapidly. Then you might use high skimming pricing 
to recover any development costs.
 
✓ Distribution: The product is only distributed selectively, which allows 
you to measure the acceptance of the product from consumers.
 
✓ Promotion: In this stage, promotion is aimed toward innovators and 
early adopters. (See the earlier section “Reaching the right consumers 
within your target market” for more on these consumers.) Marketing 
is used to communicate and build product awareness and to educate 
potential consumers about your product.

Stage 2: Growth
Your goal in the growth stage is to increase product sales and become the 
first choice of your customers. This is the stage where you’ll more than likely 
see a period of rapid growth. Consumers become more aware of your prod-
uct and as a result your sales increase. You want to make changes to your 
marketing mix to accommodate this growth.
Here are the impacts on the marketing mix during this stage:
 
✓ Product: The quality from the previous stage is maintained, though 
additional features and support service may be added.
 
✓ Pricing: The pricing strategy from Stage 1 is maintained during this 
stage because typically the demand is increasing and competition is low.
 
✓ Distribution: Distribution channels are added in this stage as demand 
increases and more and more consumers begin to accept the product.
 
✓ Promotion: Promotion and marketing are now focused on a broader 
audience.
Stage 3: Maturity
The primary objective during the maturity stage is to defend your market 
share, extend the product life cycle, and maximize your profit. To do so, 

314
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
your promotion becomes more widespread and you begin to use a variety of 
media in order to get your message out.
Consider the impacts on the marketing mix during this stage:
 
✓ Product: During this stage, you’ll likely enhance features to differentiate 
your product from the competition.
 
✓ Pricing: Pricing may be lowered because of new competition.
 
✓ Distribution: Distribution becomes more intensive, and you may offer 
incentives to encourage preference for your product over competing 
products.
 
✓ Promotion: Promotion during this phase emphasizes differentiation 
among competitors.
Stage 4: Decline
The primary objective of the decline stage is survival or coasting until you 
run out of revenue. This is a tough stage to be in because you’ll have to make 
some tough decisions. Make a decision on how you’ll proceed with your 
product and then create a plan to act on.
Profit can often be saved or improved by reducing marketing and by cutting 
costs in other ways, such as reducing overhead costs that come from the 
development of the product. Your marketing mix is less important in this 
stage because your goal is to cut costs to survive. Your marketing mix would 
only apply if you had found new features or new uses for your product. And if 
that is the case, you would actually find yourself back in Stage 1 of the prod-
uct life cycle.
Your action item during this stage is to make a decision. You have three main 
options, and in order for a company to stay on top, it must choose one and 
act on it:
 
✓ Maintain and revitalize the product: With this option, you keep the 
product going as is. You may enhance the product by adding new fea-
tures or finding new uses.
 
✓ Harvest the product: You harvest a product by reducing costs and con-
tinuing to offer it, but you generally focus on loyal niche segments only.
 
✓ Discontinue the product: If you discontinue a product, you liquidate the 
remaining inventory or sell it to a company that’s willing to continue the 
product.

Chapter 19
Cultivating Customer Loyalty
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding consumer-business relationships
▶ Evaluating the different loyalty types
▶ Encouraging customer loyalty with a few strategies and methods
C
onsumers have to make choices every day; if you want to be the busi-
ness they’re loyal to, you must give them a reason to choose you. An 
enjoyable experience and exceptional service set the stage for customer 
loyalty, and an emotional connection and authentic relationship will seal the 
deal every time.
Creating loyalty within your customers isn’t difficult, but it does take effort 
on your part. You must be able to provide your consumers with what they 
feel is that emotional connection; that connection comes from providing 
them with the best value, having the ability to satisfy their needs and desires, 
and taking the time to make them feel good about who they are. When you’ve 
done these things, you’ve laid the groundwork and cultivated the relation-
ship that leads to the committed consumer loyalty that you’re looking for.
In this chapter, I discuss consumer-business relationships as well as cus-
tomer loyalty. Specifically, I show you how to recognize and foster loyalty 
from your customers.
Waxing Romantic: A Primer on 
Consumer-Business Relationships
As a marketing manager, your goal is twofold: attracting new customers 
and retaining your existing ones. Getting business from current customers 
is easier and much less expensive than gaining a new customer. A regular 
consumer that’s committed to your products doesn’t have to be resold, so 
you save time, money, and effort. Marketing is a great tool that can be used 
to develop, nurture, retain, and maintain relationships with your customers. 
Marketers call this customer relationship management.

316
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
Business is based on relationships, and relationships are based on qualities 
such as trust, respect, appreciation, understanding, generosity, and open and 
honest communication. True customer loyalty is a continuing series of inter-
actions and feelings of attachment between you and the customer. I provide 
the basics on customer loyalty in the followings sections.
The difference between repeat 
buying and customer loyalty
There’s a difference between a satisfied customer and a loyal customer. A 
satisfied customer is simply happy with the service and products that a com-
pany offers at the moment. If something better comes along, however, that 
customer could be lured away. Loyalty, on the other hand, develops when 
consumers get involved with the company beyond the normal transaction. 
Customer loyalty usually develops when a customer has a problem and the 
company solves that problem by going out of its way to take care of the cus-
tomer. This individual care causes the customer to feel an emotional connec-
tion to the company.
 
It’s important to understand the differences between satisfied customers and 
loyal customers because then you can use that information to be proactive in 
switching satisfied customers to loyal customers. Table 19-1 shows you the 
characteristics of both loyal customers and satisfied customers.

317
 Chapter 19: Cultivating Customer Loyalty
Here’s a personal example that will give you a clear picture of how customer 
loyalty works. One hot summer day, I accidentally locked myself out of my 
home. I had recently become a patron of a wine bar that’s located not far 
from my house, so I decided to go there to see if I could use the phone to 
call a locksmith. When I walked in, the owner immediately knew that I was 
stressed. I explained the situation, and she let me use her laptop to locate 
a locksmith. The locksmith couldn’t be at my house for 45 minutes, so the 
owner of the wine bar poured me a glass of white wine and invited me to wait 
it out there.
When it was time to leave the bar, I asked for my tab. The owner hadn’t 
charged me for the glass of wine. As you can imagine, I have become a loyal 
customer of that bar. Even though a variety of wine bars are in my area and 
new ones are opening frequently, that one wine bar has become my “home.” 
I not only visit there, but I also recommend the bar to others. When I have 
lunch meetings, I often take my guests there so they can experience the atmo-
sphere and extraordinary care that the owners of this wine bar give their 
customers.
Why loyalty is important for business
When a relationship between a business and a consumer is of high quality, 
the chance for ongoing business is increased, because both see value and 
mutual benefits in the exchanges. In other words, a high-quality relation-
ship benefits both your business and the customer. Customers, for instance, 
have an easier time making decisions and their perception of practical value 
is enhanced. Your company benefits by not having to resell the customer. 
The pleasant nature of the exchanges between you and the customer are 
agreeable to both parties. You’ll know when the relationship between you 
and your customer is strong, because you’ll act as partners. Additionally, 
relationship building and staying in touch with your customers serves as a 
reminder of why they should buy from you and not your competitor.
Before you spend your time and money going after new customers that you 
aren’t currently in a relationship with, consider the following statistics:
 
✓ Loyal customers spend 33 percent more than new customers.
 
✓ Referrals among loyal customers are 107 percent greater than among 
non-customers.
 
✓ It costs six times more to sell something to a prospect than to sell that 
same item to a loyal customer.

As you can see, your marketing dollars go farther when you use them to build, 
nurture, and develop your customer relationships and develop the loyalty of 
your customers.
Customer loyalty provides you with many benefits. For instance, loyal cus-
tomers do the following:
 
✓ Purchase your products over and over again throughout time.
 
✓ Increase the volume of their purchases with you.
 
✓ Buy across product lines.
 
✓ Refer others to you with word-of-mouth marketing.
 
✓ Avoid being lured by your competition.
 
✓ Give your company the benefit of the doubt when something goes wrong.
Digging Up the Roots of Loyalty
You may be surprised to find that there are different types of customer loy-
alty. General customer loyalty can create a certain level of stability, but com-
mitted loyalty is what creates business success — it’s the type that doesn’t 
build false hope in success but instead builds a strong commitment from 
your customers.
 
Consumers become loyal to businesses that meet their needs, both internal 
and external, but they become committed in loyalty when businesses meet 
their psychological needs. In this section, I discuss the different types of loy-
alty so you can gain an understanding of the type of loyalty that you desire. I 
also show you how to attract that loyalty by being able to recognize and meet 
the psychological needs of your customer.
Why consumers are loyal: Five 
very different reasons
By understanding the following five types of loyalty, you can easily identify 
your customers accordingly:
 
✓ Committed loyalty: This is the type of loyalty that you want to achieve. 
Consumers in this category have a positive commitment to your business 
and are devoted to purchasing from you. No matter how strong the pull 
is, they won’t be swayed by your competition. That’s because these con-
sumers have a deliberate, emotionally based commitment to you, your 
product, your brand, or whatever it is that they’re loyal to. This com-
mitted loyalty has been created by the service they’ve received and the 

319
 Chapter 19: Cultivating Customer Loyalty
extraordinary experience they get every time they visit your business. 
These consumers know they don’t get this from every business they 
patronize, but they can always count on getting it from yours. Your goal 
is to strive to achieve this level of loyalty from all of your consumers.
 
 An example is a customer who goes to a restaurant every week, not 
because it’s close to his house but because the service is phenomenal, 
the food is excellent, and he feels like part of the restaurant family.
 
✓ Cost of change loyalty: In some situations, the cost, difficulty, or hassle 
involved in changing companies is so great that consumers change only 
as a last resort — even when other solid competitors are available. An 
example would be a customer who has a mortgage but isn’t happy with 
the service of his current mortgage company. He won’t switch compa-
nies because the cost would be high and the hassle would be great.
 
✓ Habitual loyalty: This repeat business is the most common. As time 
becomes scarce for consumers, familiar routines that can be quickly 
accomplished with minimal thought become part of their lifestyle. 
Businesses with high levels of consumers who have the habitual type of 
loyalty may feel a misleading sense of security. The commitment con-
sumers feel to these businesses can be quite low. An example is a con-
sumer who uses a dry cleaning service that’s a block from his house. He 
isn’t happy with the prices and the service in his opinion isn’t the best, 
but he’ll continue to use the service because it’s convenient and fits into 
his daily routine and habits.
 
✓ Incentivized loyalty: This type of loyalty represents customers who are 
incentivized for their loyalty to a business through points programs, 
percentages off, or cash-back options. They see the loyalty program as 
something that’s important, and because of this perk they continue to 
shop at the store that offers the program. An example would be a cus-
tomer who has a credit card that offers him points for every dollar he 
spends at a certain store. Even though the store’s service is subpar, the 
customer won’t switch because the incentive to stay is too great.
 
✓ Monopoly loyalty: This is the type of loyalty where customers have little 
or no choice in where they shop. Their “loyalty” is far from devoted. 
Instead, it’s often resentful. Unfortunately, customers who have little or 
no choice and have monopoly loyalty are often dissatisfied. An example 
of monopoly loyalty would be a utility company that has gained govern-
ment legislation to be the only one who provides service in a specific 
area. The customer has no choice but to use them.
Understanding what committed loyalty — 
the one you want — is based on
Consumer loyalty is strengthened when a company makes an emotional con-
nection with its customers. Recent research indicates that when a consumer 

320
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
connects emotionally with a product, a segment of her brain lights up — and 
that’s a good thing. After those emotional connections are made, consumers 
become loyal and go from being just a “customer” to being a “repeat buyer.”
 
The main reason that customers leave companies that they’ve been doing 
business with is because they perceive that the companies don’t care about 
them or their needs. When customers are asked why they remain loyal to a 
particular company, the top answer is “because the company cared about 
me.” This perception of being cared for is the emotional bridge between 
customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. In other words, loyalty is an 
emotional attachment that a consumer has with a company based on the con-
sumer’s subjective perception that the company is delivering the value she 
desires or needs at the right time and in the right form.
Creating the kind of loyalty that you desire from consumers takes meeting their 
psychological needs. It’s about service and creating extraordinary experiences, 
but it’s also about providing consumers with the interaction that they need to 
solidify the relationship — and that starts with the first purchase they make 
from you. I explain all this in the following sections.
Starting with the psychology behind the initial purchase
In today’s world, consumers want choices. But they also want those choices 
to be relevant to what they need to accomplish. Even though the reasons 
consumers buy vary from one consumer to another, they’re all derived from 
four psychological needs. This is true for all businesses and industries.
As you know, in Step 1 of the decision-making process, the consumers 
identify a need (see Chapter 2 for more on this process). When it comes to 
developing the committed loyalty that you want from consumers, it’s about 
meeting those internal psychological needs that really creates the emotional 
connection that consumers are looking for. Meeting a need is one thing; 
meeting an emotional need at the same time is what creates loyalty. (Refer to 
Chapter 4 for more information on meeting the emotional needs of consum-
ers.) When you meet one of the following needs, it causes the consumer to 
make the initial purchase:
 
✓ The need to be understood
 
✓ The need to feel welcome
 
✓ The need to feel important
 
✓ The need for comfort
 
Even after the initial purchase has been made, true loyalty to you requires 
commitment from the consumer, because that consumer must make a con-
scious decision and effort to purchase from you. Customers who feel a true 
commitment to you are an asset to the company, because as long as you 
always take care of them, they will always be your customer.

321
 Chapter 19: Cultivating Customer Loyalty
Moving from psychology to relationship (in effect, loyalty)
A consumer’s initial purchase is his first interaction with you. This interaction 
determines whether he’ll return. Even though he may not become a commit-
ted loyal customer on the first visit, it definitely sets the stage for whether 
he’ll ever become a committed loyal customer of yours in the future. A com-
mitted relationship with consumers is based on the following building blocks:
 
✓ Communication: You and the consumers “speak the same language” and 
are able to understand one another. Communication is key; if consumers 
feel that you don’t understand them or that you aren’t listening to them, 
it could detour them from ever coming back.
 
✓ Competence: Consumers view your company as knowledgeable and 
capable. They want to be able to trust your expertise and know that 
what you’re telling them is true.
 
✓ Customer orientation: The strong relationships with your customers 
have filtered down to other staff members. You can be the owner of the 
company and treat every customer with respect and great service, but 
if your staff members don’t, they can do damage to the work that you’ve 
done. Their lack of respect can even sever the relationship. You can’t be 
the only one in your company who understands the importance of cus-
tomer loyalty, so hire carefully and provide training.
 
✓ Equity: You and the consumers both see equity in your exchanges, and 
you’re also able to equitably resolve conflicts. Consumers want to know 
that you value them as much as they value you. They also want to feel as 
if you have the same interest in resolving their problems as they do.
 
✓ Personalization: You treat the customers as individuals. You may even 
know their names. Even if you don’t know their names, they want to feel 
as if they’re important to you. They don’t want to just be another sale. 
Consumers enter businesses daily where no one pays attention to them. 
It’s out of the norm for someone to give them the attention they’re look-
ing for, so if you can do that, you’ll make them want to be loyal to you.
 
✓ Trust: You and the consumers both depend on each other. Consumers 
love to purchase from people that they can trust. If they can trust you, 
they will feel safe in taking your advice and getting your feedback.
Creating a Committed Loyal Customer
Encouraging customer loyalty is a complex task. But with a few methods, you 
can successfully build loyalty among your customers. Success in customer 
loyalty is usually achieved with a combination of marketing initiatives and 
excellent customer service. The success formula varies from one business to 
another, however.

322
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
The foundations of customer loyalty are universal, so in this section, I begin 
with the basic relationship-building blocks you should start with as well as 
offer a macro perspective on the ins and outs of loyalty programs. I then 
discuss ways to customize your tactics to your particular target market, 
which you can do to make your efforts resonate even more deeply with your 
customers.
 
If you build customer loyalty that’s based on your company, you’ll find it 
easier to gain loyalty for your products. If you only build loyalty with a certain 
product, you risk losing business when you decide to discontinue that prod-
uct. Loyalty to the company creates a forever customer; loyalty to a product 
creates a customer for the life of the product. So I always suggest creating loy-
alty from the bottom up.
Establishing a relationship: The basics
Building relationships with your customers isn’t as difficult as you may think. 
You simply have to treat your customers as if they truly are your strategic 
partners. You also need to show them that you truly care about them. You 
can do both of these things by focusing your efforts on developing and exem-
plifying the following qualities:
 
✓ Expertise: Be able to answer the questions that your customers have. 
Consumers don’t want to buy from just anyone — they want to know 
that they can count on you to give them good solid advice and feedback.
 
✓ Attention: Pay attention to your customers; listen to what they want and 
what they have to say. By listening to what they say, you can identify 
their needs and hopefully provide a solution for those needs.
 
✓ Friendliness: Reflect a great attitude. Customers are attracted to busi-
nesses that contain happy and helpful people. Be sure to hire those staff 
members who can exude friendliness to your customers.
 
✓ Flexibility: Be flexible in order to fulfill the needs of your customers. If 
customers think that doing business with you is a risk, they’ll reach out 
to your competitors.
 
✓ Patience: Customers don’t like being pressured to purchase, so show 
them options and educate them, but then be patient while they make a 
decision.
 
✓ Superiority: Offer products that are of excellent quality. Do what you do, 
and do it well. Be superior in both products and service. Customers hate 
to feel like they were scammed or taken advantage of. When purchas-
ing from you, they want to be confident that you will provide them with 
quality products and will back those products with superior service.

323
 Chapter 19: Cultivating Customer Loyalty
 
Don’t just satisfy your customers. Instead, blow them away with your service. 
Do whatever it takes to make them happy. The out-of-the-way service may 
cost you in the short term, but it will pay off in the long run. Also, be aggres-
sive but not intrusive. Be friendly, go out of your way, and put an emphasis on 
forming a relationship with each customer. Whatever you do, don’t simply 
focus on sales. Sales always follow relationships.
Adding loyalty programs to the repertoire 
(but not as a solo act!)
Many businesses have experimented with loyalty cards and programs as a 
way of increasing customer loyalty. A loyalty card or program keeps track of 
the purchases that a customer has made with your business. These programs 
differ somewhat, depending on the business that offers them. Most of the 
time, however, these programs offer on-the-spot discounts on selected items. 
The business also may offer the customer with the loyalty card a lesser price 
than the customer who doesn’t have a loyalty card.
Here are a few of the pros of loyalty programs:
 
✓ They keep your name in front of the customer.
 
✓ They encourage increased sales and return business.
 
✓ They can provide you with valuable customer demographic information 
if you collect the data on purchases.
 
But, of course, there are cons as well. Here they are:
 
✓ Unless the reward is significant, your program may not stand out among 
other programs.
 
✓ Unique offers can backfire. For example, some business owners may 
avoid punch cards and club cards altogether and instead opt for spe-
cial sales and offers for their most loyal customers. This can be a great 
approach, but there’s always the unfortunate risk of offending custom-
ers if your special sale or offer doesn’t apply to them.
 
✓ Loyalty cards and programs can seem invasive to some customers, 
especially if you’re tracking purchasing habits.
 
✓ Loyalty programs create a loyalty that’s based on your financial com-
mitment to the consumer. This type of loyalty lasts for a very brief time 
when compared to consumer loyalty that’s based on your product. 
Product-based loyalty is a much deeper commitment on the consumer’s 
behalf.

324
Part V: Implementing Your Strategy with a Marketing Plan 
The results of these programs are mixed. In fact, these programs can some-
times backfire by appealing too strongly to the bargain-hunting consumer. 
Consumers who are economically conscious often show a lower interest in 
incentivized programs because they prefer to purchase from the business 
that gives them the best offer instead of just being incentivized for the pur-
chase. So when using these programs, you must evaluate whether you’ve cre-
ated a reward for the loyalty of the customer or have attracted the bargain 
shopper instead.
 
If you’re going to develop a program that incentivizes customers, it’s a mistake 
to make that the only thing you do to capture customer loyalty. Incentivizing 
to gain customer loyalty can work in your favor, but it can also work against 
you by creating customers who are only loyal to you because of the incentives 
you give them. However, you can create an incentive program that you pair 
with other loyalty development initiatives, such as superior service and rela-
tionship building, and it will be a success.
Accounting for behavioral predispositions
Consumers are all different, but they carry around many of the same predis-
positions. So, in order to create the customer loyalty that you desire, you 
must create an emotional connection with them. An emotional connection 
develops when the consumer becomes more involved with your business in a 
way that’s over and beyond the normal daily transaction.
You create customer loyalty by understanding what’s important to your 
consumers and by going out of your way to use that understanding to pro-
vide them with an extraordinary experience every time they encounter your 
business — whether they’re purchasing a product at the time or not.

C
onsumers are affected by external and internal influences that can 
sometimes determine how they receive you, but you can also provide 
a marketing influence by communicating with them. They must feel as if you 
have a genuine interest in them when you communicate with them. Reception 
can depend a lot on your approach as well as on the manner in which you do 
it. You won’t always understand the influences that affect every consumer, 
but by understanding the reasons consumers behave the way they do, you 
can take measures to communicate with them in ways that foster a positive 
consumer-supplier relationship.
As you can see, long-term success in business is about developing and main-
taining good customer relationships and loyalty, but who has the time? Don’t 
worry! In this chapter, I show you ten easy ways that you can better commu-
nicate with your customers.
Acknowledge Customers Right Away
You’d be amazed at the number of businesses you can walk into without 
being acknowledged. No one says hello. Your presence goes unnoticed. Don’t 
be one of those businesses; acknowledge everyone who steps foot into your 
business. Greet them and move from behind the desk or counter to shake 
their hands. Create that first impression, because you only get one chance 
to do it.

328
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Conduct Customer Surveys
The most important tasks that customer surveys assist with are finding out 
what your customers want and discovering how they feel about the service 
they’ve received from you. Customer surveys also help you
 
✓ Stay innovative in product development.
 
✓ Receive external feedback about the customer service you provide.
 
✓ Increase customer retention by showing customers that you care what 
they think.
 
✓ Recover customers you’ve lost by finding out why they left and encour-
aging them to return by showing that you’ve fixed the problem.
 
✓ Obtain an advanced warning by identifying upcoming trends, perfor-
mance issues, or marketing opportunities that you may be missing.
Follow Up to Inquire about Satisfaction
When was the last time you called a customer to find out about his experi-
ence with your business? I’m not talking about telemarketing to sell some-
thing. I’m talking about a genuine telephone call that has no motive other 
than to talk to the customer and find out how he felt about his experience 
with your business. Or, if he purchased a big-ticket item, you find out how 
the item is working. This tip is as easy as picking up the phone. Just remem-
ber that it isn’t a sales call; it’s a courtesy call that carries with it a genuine 
interest in the satisfaction of a customer.
Listen Intently
Talk to your customers, but don’t stop there. Also be sure to listen to them. 
Listen intently — hear what they have to say. Your customers’ opinions are 
valuable. By listening to them, you often can find out what they’re looking for 
and what type of services they enjoy. You can even get to know them person-
ally. It’s important to remember that customer loyalty is created by the emo-
tional experience they have with your business, and if you aren’t listening, 
the emotional connection will never transpire. Strive for customer loyalty, 
not just customer satisfaction.

329
 Chapter 20: Ten Easy Ways to Enhance Customer Satisfaction
Build an Online Presence
If you aren’t online, your customers will have trouble finding you. And I’m not 
just talking about new customers. Your current customers need information 
too. You would be surprised at how many consumers use the Internet to find 
addresses, telephone numbers, or special items they’d like to purchase. With 
today’s technology, it isn’t enough to be in the phone book — most folks 
aren’t using those anymore.
 
It’s best to have a Web site that will provide consumers with information 
about you and the services and products that you offer. If this approach isn’t 
feasible, at least make sure you’re listed in online directories so consumers 
can find you when browsing the Internet.
Keep in Touch with E-Newsletters
More than 70 percent of individuals have e-mail addresses. Are you collecting 
these valuable gems? If not, it’s a good time to start. When you ask customers 
for their e-mail addresses, tell them you’re collecting the addresses so you 
can inform them of upcoming events, specials, or new item introductions. 
You’d be surprised how many customers are willing to share their e-mail 
addresses with you.
 
Don’t bombard customers with daily e-mail messages. If you become a nui-
sance, your customers may lose trust in you and your products and services.
Instead, send out quarterly or monthly updates letting customers know 
what’s going on at your business. Keep your promise and use the newsletters 
to keep them informed. You may even want to include a special coupon every 
once in a while as a thank you.
Make the Purchasing Process 
an Experience
Go out of your way to create an experience for your customers. Too many 
businesses today feel that they deserve to have customers served up on a 
silver platter. The truth is that you must earn those customers by creating an 
extraordinary experience for them every time.

330
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The experience comes from the atmosphere and the friendliness of your 
business. You want your consumers to notice that your business is willing 
to go out of the way to help without making them feel as if they’re a burden. 
Test your place of business by walking through it and experiencing what your 
customers experience. Make sure you’re creating an experience that keeps 
them coming back.
Offer Birthday Specials
Everyone loves birthday gifts, right? Of course. Consider starting a birthday 
program that you can use to send that special birthday offer to your custom-
ers. The offer needs to be worth their visit to your business, so make sure it 
has value to them. Consider offering them a discount or a free gift when they 
visit your business location.
Birthday programs, which are a great way to stay in touch with your custom-
ers, show that you’re thinking of them on their special day. This is the kind of 
program that creates loyalty with your customer base, so get started today.
Hold Special Events
If you want customers to continue coming to your business, consider holding 
special events; perhaps an open house, a special sale night, or a premiere of 
a new product. Customers love events that are designed around specific cele-
brations. It gives them a reason to visit your place of business and experience 
what you have to offer. Besides, who doesn’t enjoy a celebration? Consider 
your target market and then develop a calendar of special events that will 
keep your customers coming back over and over again.
Volunteer for a Good Cause
Besides seeing you when purchasing a product from you, customers want to 
see you doing good within the community. So get out there and volunteer for 
causes that you support. By doing so you reflect that you not only care about 
your business, but you care about the surrounding community. You’d be sur-
prised how many new customers you can gain by reaching out. People love 
to support the businesses that support the causes that they do. You’ll not 
only feel great about volunteering, but you can grow your business by doing 
it. Consider this growth an added benefit.

Chapter 21
Ten Special Considerations for 
Business-to-Business Marketing
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the core differences between marketing to businesses and to consumers
▶ Marketing successfully to businesses
P
eople often ask how business-to-business (B2B) marketing is different than 
business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing. After all, as most people would 
say, you’re still selling a product to a person. That’s a valid perspective, and 
one that’s shared by many, but experience shows that the differences between 
these two types of marketing run deep. And those differences are important.
 
In the B2B market, businesses try to streamline the purchasing process in 
order to not only save time but also save money. So when you’re dealing with 
businesses, you must take certain steps to move the decision-making process 
in your favor. By understanding what they’re looking for, you can create a plan 
to do this.
Value of a Sale
The cost of a sale when it comes to the business-to-business market is typi-
cally higher than with the business-to-customer market. Why? A business-to-
business transaction often requires more consideration. The cost pushes the 
business-to-business consumer to evaluate more options in order to evaluate 
price and value thoroughly.
An average sales call now costs $350 to $400 when you factor in all expenses. 
A complex transaction may require eight to ten calls to close a sale. Plus you 
have to add in the advertising and marketing expenses needed to generate 
inquiries and qualify leads. The initial transaction value is measured in hun-
dreds or thousands of dollars, and the likelihood of ongoing sales is quite 
high. As a result, the lifetime value of a B2B customer can span many years 
and add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars — if not millions.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Use this information to compute the true profitability of each of your B2B 
accounts. Doing so will assist you in determining the true profitability when all 
selling costs are factored in.
Size of Your Target Market
In a B2C market, you typically have a larger target market than you do when 
dealing with a B2B market. Your B2B target market is small and focused. 
You have less wiggle room, and you’re typically required to stay within that 
focused target market. Consumer markets are measured in the millions, but 
only a few B2B firms have customer bases in the thousands.
 
However, with that being said, don’t confuse potential revenue with the 
number of potential customers. B2B markets may be smaller and more con-
centrated in terms of number of prospective customers, but not necessarily in 
sales potential. Your marketing can be more condensed and better targeted, 
but your message needs to really appeal to the markets in order to gain their 
business. In other words, you’ll have less opportunity for trial and error of 
your marketing message.
Complexity of the Buying Process
With a business-to-consumer market, you’re typically dealing with a single-
step buying process. You’re trying to convince an individual — the same 
individual who considers the options, makes the decision, and pays the bill. 
The same isn’t true with most business-to-business transactions. You’re 
often dealing with multiple individuals and sometimes even large commit-
tees, which could mean that you have to deal with different personalities. 
B2B sales organizations are characterized by well-paid field sales people, dis-
tributors, and business partners or independent representatives who aren’t 
engaged only in the selling but in the fulfillment of the product or service.
As a result, B2B companies use marketing to educate various players in the 
target audience because the decision to purchase is usually a multistep pro-
cess involving more than one person. Marketing activities are usually the 
first step in a longer, integrated touch campaign that may include direct mail, 
telemarketing, webcasts, newsletters, and follow-up by sales representatives 
who will discuss the business’s requirements in more detail and move the 
prospect through the sales cycle.

333
 Chapter 21: Ten Special Considerations for Business-to-Business Marketing
Challenge of Identifying 
the Decision Maker
Ultimately, your goal is to get to the decision maker. If you don’t follow the 
chain of command within the business, you could lose the sale for not con-
sidering the proper people. Each person has a specific role in the decision-
making process and a duty to judiciously compare all the options. The selling 
proposition is complex and the risk of a wrong decision is high and long last-
ing. As the marketer you have the added responsibility of correctly identify-
ing the roles within that buying committee in order to identify the decision 
maker — and this is sometimes difficult to do.
Duration of the Sales Cycle
The sales cycle for a B2B transaction typically takes much longer than a B2C 
sale. It’s not unusual to have a six-to-nine month buying cycle involving five 
to ten people as both decision makers and influencers. A long sales cycle can 
cost you money, time, and effort before a sales is ever closed. It can some-
times cause frustration in the process as well. If a company isn’t prepared 
from a revenue standpoint, its success may be affected.
Importance of Reason 
in Decision Making
Purchase decisions within a business-to-business market are made rationally 
rather than emotionally. A business must evaluate the business value and 
make a determination on the purchase. So it’s rare to have an impulse pur-
chase within a B2B marketplace. On the other hand, emotions play a huge 
role in purchasing patterns during business-to-consumer transactions.
Take the decision-making process for example. Sure, most families consult on 
houses and cars, but no one ever gets fired for making an impulse buy while 
in the line at the grocery store. In fact, creating the interest that drives an 
impulse sale is one of the core tenants of B2C marketing. This isn’t the case 
in B2B marketing.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Motivation to Purchase
Fundamentally, B2B motivations to purchase are about addressing a point of 
pain and economic impact that will increase revenue or decrease costs. The 
consumer, on the other hand, is motivated to purchase by an emotion that’s 
triggered as a result of identifying a need.
 
The business buyer makes a logical decision to purchase; there’s little to no 
personal emotion involved. The organizational buying process is often driven 
by systematic procedures and purchasing systems that must be followed. The 
business buyer wants or needs to buy products or services to help her com-
pany stay profitable, competitive, and successful. As a marketer, you must 
understand that organizational buyers have to operate within the confines 
of their organizational procedures, so it’s your job to fully understand these 
procedures.
Distribution of Products
Consumers demand a variety of distribution channels for convenience. 
However, it’s unlikely that you’ll find business-to-business offerings in the 
local market. Convenience is of less importance in B2B transactions. In fact, 
most B2B products must be preordered and sometimes even produced spe-
cifically for a company. This process takes time, which means that the order 
must be preplanned. If you’re marketing to the B2B market, you must ensure 
that you’re getting the proper materials to businesses. This way, when they 
order your product, they know that you’re a supplier. After all, the chances 
of business owners browsing the local market are pretty slim.
Thirst for Knowledge
Consumers don’t like to be handed five-page pamphlets on your products, 
but B2B buyers are different in this respect. They have a thirst for knowl-
edge. They’re information seekers who are constantly looking for information 
or advice that will help them increase profitability and enhance their careers. 
So, obviously, when you’re creating your marketing collateral for B2B mar-
kets, you can be more in depth. If you provide them with information that’s 
helpful, interesting, and relevant to their concerns and needs, they’ll read 
it. Consumers are the exact opposite, however; they don’t want to work to 
understand your benefits. Instead, the benefits must be clearly pointed out.

 Chapter 21: Ten Special Considerations for Business-to-Business Marketing
Frequency of Negotiation
You can sell a consumer with little to no negotiation; as long as he feels like 
he’s getting value, you’re set. Consumers simply don’t like to haggle. When it 
comes to the B2B market, however, be prepared. You will negotiate on cost, 
service plans, and delivery of your product. The buyer in the B2B market 
isn’t the only one who needs to feel as if he has received the higher end of 
value from the deal; he also must prove it to the others in the chain of com-
mand. So be sure to go into a B2B market transaction prepared to negotiate. 
If you don’t, it’s very likely that you’ll lose the sale.

Glossary
M
arketing terms can seem confusing since so many look and sound 
alike but carry different meanings. So to help you get everything 
straight, in this glossary I combine some common terms used in consumer 
behavior and marketing. I also include some not-so-common terms that 
you’re likely to come across.
This glossary gives you a great reference as you read through the discus-
sions in this book. And even when you finish this book, I think you’ll find this 
to be a resource you refer to often.
actual self: Pertains to the self-concept that’s reflective of how an individual 
actually is today.
ad copy: The printed text or spoken words in an advertisement.
advertising allowance: Money provided by a manufacturer to a distributor 
for the purpose of advertising a specific product or brand.
advertising budget: Money set aside by the advertiser to pay for advertising. 
A variety of methods are available for determining the most desirable size of 
an advertising budget.

achieve. The plan also summarizes how to accomplish those goals and how 
to determine whether the campaign was successful in obtaining the goals.

tising. It may focus on a specific ad or campaign, or it may be directed at a 
more general understanding of how advertising works or how consumers use 
the information in advertising.

relationship. The affiliate gives wider distribution to the affiliate merchant’s 
products in return for compensation based on performance.

338

deceptive advertising: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) defines this as 
being a representation, omission, act, or practice that’s likely to mislead con-
sumers who are acting reasonably under the circumstances. To be regulated, 
however, a deceptive claim must also be material. See materiality.
demographics: Basic objective and descriptive classifications of consumers, 
such as their age, sex, income, education, size of household, and ownership 
of home. This doesn’t include classification by subjective attitudes or opin-
ions of consumers.
direct mail: Marketing communications delivered directly to a prospective 
purchaser via the U.S. Postal Service or a private delivery company.
