1.1
Introduction to linear equations
A linear equation in n unknowns x1, x2, · · · , xn is an equation of the form
a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn = b,
where a1, a2, . . . , an, b are given real numbers.
For example, with x and y instead of x1 and x2, the linear equation
2x + 3y = 6 describes the line passing through the points (3, 0) and (0, 2).
Similarly, with x, y and z instead of x1, x2 and x3, the linear equa-
tion 2x + 3y + 4z = 12 describes the plane passing through the points
(6, 0, 0), (0, 4, 0), (0, 0, 3).
A system of m linear equations in n unknowns x1, x2, · · · , xn is a family
of linear equations
a11x1 + a12x2 + · · · + a1nxn
=
b1
a21x1 + a22x2 + · · · + a2nxn
=
b2
...
am1x1 + am2x2 + · · · + amnxn
=
bm.
We wish to determine if such a system has a solution, that is to ﬁnd
out if there exist numbers x1, x2, · · · , xn which satisfy each of the equations
simultaneously. We say that the system is consistent if it has a solution.
Otherwise the system is called inconsistent.

is called the augmented matrix of the system.
Geometrically, solving a system of linear equations in two (or three)
unknowns is equivalent to determining whether or not a family of lines (or
planes) has a common point of intersection.
EXAMPLE 1.1.1 Solve the equation
2x + 3y = 6.
Solution.
The equation 2x + 3y = 6 is equivalent to 2x = 6 −3y or
x = 3 −3
2y, where y is arbitrary. So there are inﬁnitely many solutions.
EXAMPLE 1.1.2 Solve the system
x + y + z
=
1
x −y + z
=
0.
Solution. We subtract the second equation from the ﬁrst, to get 2y = 1
and y = 1
2. Then x = y −z = 1
2 −z, where z is arbitrary. Again there are
inﬁnitely many solutions.
EXAMPLE 1.1.3 Find a polynomial of the form y = a0+a1x+a2x2+a3x3
which passes through the points (−3, −2), (−1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 1).

1.1. INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR EQUATIONS

Solution. When x has the values −3, −1, 1, 2, then y takes corresponding
values −2, 2, 5, 1 and we get four equations in the unknowns a0, a1, a2, a3:
a0 −3a1 + 9a2 −27a3
=
−2
a0 −a1 + a2 −a3
=
2
a0 + a1 + a2 + a3
=
5
a0 + 2a1 + 4a2 + 8a3
=
1.
This system has the unique solution a0 = 93/20, a1 = 221/120, a2 =
−23/20,
a3 = −41/120. So the required polynomial is
y
=
93
20 + 221
120x −23
20x2 −41
120x3.
In [26, pages 33–35] there are examples of systems of linear equations
which arise from simple electrical networks using Kirchhoﬀ’s laws for elec-
trical circuits.
Solving a system consisting of a single linear equation is easy. However if
we are dealing with two or more equations, it is desirable to have a systematic
method of determining if the system is consistent and to ﬁnd all solutions.
Instead of restricting ourselves to linear equations with rational or real
coeﬃcients, our theory goes over to the more general case where the coef-
ﬁcients belong to an arbitrary ﬁeld. A ﬁeld F is a set F which possesses
operations of addition and multiplication which satisfy the familiar rules of
rational arithmetic. There are ten basic properties that a ﬁeld must have:
THE FIELD AXIOMS.
1. (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c in F;
2. (ab)c = a(bc) for all a, b, c in F;
3. a + b = b + a for all a, b in F;
4. ab = ba for all a, b in F;
5. there exists an element 0 in F such that 0 + a = a for all a in F;
6. there exists an element 1 in F such that 1a = a for all a in F;

4
CHAPTER 1. LINEAR EQUATIONS
7. to every a in F, there corresponds an additive inverse −a in F, satis-
fying
a + (−a) = 0;
8. to every non–zero a in F, there corresponds a multiplicative inverse
a−1 in F, satisfying
aa−1 = 1;
9. a(b + c) = ab + ac for all a, b, c in F;
10. 0 ̸= 1.
With standard deﬁnitions such as a −b = a + (−b) and a
b = ab−1 for
b ̸= 0, we have the following familiar rules:
−(a + b)
=
(−a) + (−b),
(ab)−1 = a−1b−1;
−(−a)
=
a,
(a−1)−1 = a;
−(a −b)

Fields which have only ﬁnitely many elements are of great interest in
many parts of mathematics and its applications, for example to coding the-
ory. It is easy to construct ﬁelds containing exactly p elements, where p is
a prime number. First we must explain the idea of modular addition and
modular multiplication. If a is an integer, we deﬁne a (mod p) to be the
least remainder on dividing a by p: That is, if a = bp + r, where b and r are
integers and 0 ≤r < p, then a (mod p) = r.
For example, −1 (mod 2) = 1, 3 (mod 3) = 0, 5 (mod 3) = 2.

Then addition and multiplication mod p are deﬁned by
a ⊕b
=
(a + b) (mod p)
a ⊗b
=
(ab) (mod p).
For example, with p = 7, we have 3 ⊕4 = 7 (mod 7) = 0 and 3 ⊗5 =
15 (mod 7) = 1. Here are the complete addition and multiplication tables

If we now let Zp = {0, 1, . . . , p −1}, then it can be proved that Zp forms
a ﬁeld under the operations of modular addition and multiplication mod p.
For example, the additive inverse of 3 in Z7 is 4, so we write −3 = 4 when
calculating in Z7. Also the multiplicative inverse of 3 in Z7 is 5 , so we write
3−1 = 5 when calculating in Z7.
In practice, we write a⊕b and a⊗b as a+b and ab or a×b when dealing
with linear equations over Zp.
The simplest ﬁeld is Z2, which consists of two elements 0, 1 with addition
satisfying 1+1 = 0. So in Z2, −1 = 1 and the arithmetic involved in solving
equations over Z2 is very simple.
EXAMPLE 1.1.4 Solve the following system over Z2:
x + y + z
=
0
x + z
=
1.
Solution. We add the ﬁrst equation to the second to get y = 1. Then x =
1 −z = 1 + z, with z arbitrary. Hence the solutions are (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 0)
and (0, 1, 1).
We use Q and R to denote the ﬁelds of rational and real numbers, re-
spectively. Unless otherwise stated, the ﬁeld used will be Q.

CHAPTER 1. LINEAR EQUATIONS
1.2
Solving linear equations
We show how to solve any system of linear equations over an arbitrary ﬁeld,
using the GAUSS–JORDAN algorithm. We ﬁrst need to deﬁne some terms.
DEFINITION 1.2.1 (Row–echelon form) A matrix is in row–echelon
form if
(i) all zero rows (if any) are at the bottom of the matrix and
(ii) if two successive rows are non–zero, the second row starts with more
zeros than the ﬁrst (moving from left to right).
For example, the matrix

The zero matrix of any size is always in row–echelon form.
DEFINITION 1.2.2 (Reduced row–echelon form) A matrix is in re-
duced row–echelon form if
1. it is in row–echelon form,
2. the leading (leftmost non–zero) entry in each non–zero row is 1,
3. all other elements of the column in which the leading entry 1 occurs
are zeros.

are not in reduced row–echelon form, but are in row–echelon form.
The zero matrix of any size is always in reduced row–echelon form.
Notation. If a matrix is in reduced row–echelon form, it is useful to denote
the column numbers in which the leading entries 1 occur, by c1, c2, . . . , cr,
with the remaining column numbers being denoted by cr+1, . . . , cn, where
r is the number of non–zero rows. For example, in the 4 × 6 matrix above,
we have r = 3, c1 = 2, c2 = 4, c3 = 5, c4 = 1, c5 = 3, c6 = 6.
The following operations are the ones used on systems of linear equations
and do not change the solutions.
DEFINITION 1.2.3 (Elementary row operations) There are three
types of elementary row operations that can be performed on matrices:
1. Interchanging two rows:
Ri ↔Rj interchanges rows i and j.
2. Multiplying a row by a non–zero scalar:
Ri →tRi multiplies row i by the non–zero scalar t.
3. Adding a multiple of one row to another row:
Rj →Rj + tRi adds t times row i to row j.
DEFINITION 1.2.4 [Row equivalence]Matrix A is row–equivalent to ma-
trix B if B is obtained from A by a sequence of elementary row operations.

CHAPTER 1. LINEAR EQUATIONS
Thus A is row–equivalent to B. Clearly B is also row–equivalent to A, by
performing the inverse row–operations R1 →1
2R1, R2 ↔R3, R2 →R2−2R3
on B.
It is not diﬃcult to prove that if A and B are row–equivalent augmented
matrices of two systems of linear equations, then the two systems have the
same solution sets – a solution of the one system is a solution of the other.
For example the systems whose augmented matrices are A and B in the
above example are respectively



x + 2y
=
0
2x + y
=

x −y
=

and



2x + 4y

x −y

and these systems have precisely the same solutions.
1.3
The Gauss–Jordan algorithm
We now describe the GAUSS–JORDAN ALGORITHM. This is a process
which starts with a given matrix A and produces a matrix B in reduced row–
echelon form, which is row–equivalent to A. If A is the augmented matrix
of a system of linear equations, then B will be a much simpler matrix than
A from which the consistency or inconsistency of the corresponding system
is immediately apparent and in fact the complete solution of the system can
be read oﬀ.
STEP 1.
Find the ﬁrst non–zero column moving from left to right, (column c1)
and select a non–zero entry from this column. By interchanging rows, if
necessary, ensure that the ﬁrst entry in this column is non–zero. Multiply
row 1 by the multiplicative inverse of a1c1 thereby converting a1c1 to 1. For
each non–zero element aic1, i > 1, (if any) in column c1, add −aic1 times
row 1 to row i, thereby ensuring that all elements in column c1, apart from
the ﬁrst, are zero.
STEP 2. If the matrix obtained at Step 1 has its 2nd, . . . , mth rows all
zero, the matrix is in reduced row–echelon form. Otherwise suppose that
the ﬁrst column which has a non–zero element in the rows below the ﬁrst is
column c2. Then c1 < c2. By interchanging rows below the ﬁrst, if necessary,
ensure that a2c2 is non–zero. Then convert a2c2 to 1 and by adding suitable
multiples of row 2 to the remaing rows, where necessary, ensure that all
remaining elements in column c2 are zero.

The process is repeated and will eventually stop after r steps, either
because we run out of rows, or because we run out of non–zero columns. In
general, the ﬁnal matrix will be in reduced row–echelon form and will have
r non–zero rows, with leading entries 1 in columns c1, . . . , cr, respectively.

REMARK 1.3.1 It is possible to show that a given matrix over an ar-
bitrary ﬁeld is row–equivalent to precisely one matrix which is in reduced
row–echelon form.

Systematic solution of linear systems.
Suppose a system of m linear equations in n unknowns x1, · · · , xn has aug-
mented matrix A and that A is row–equivalent to a matrix B which is in
reduced row–echelon form, via the Gauss–Jordan algorithm. Then A and B
are m × (n + 1). Suppose that B has r non–zero rows and that the leading
entry 1 in row i occurs in column number ci, for 1 ≤i ≤r. Then
1 ≤c1 < c2 < · · · , < cr ≤n + 1.

Also assume that the remaining column numbers are cr+1, · · · , cn+1, where
1 ≤cr+1 < cr+2 < · · · < cn ≤n + 1.
Case 1: cr = n + 1. The system is inconsistent. For the last non–zero
row of B is [0, 0, · · · , 1] and the corresponding equation is
0x1 + 0x2 + · · · + 0xn = 1,
which has no solutions. Consequently the original system has no solutions.
Case 2: cr ≤n. The system of equations corresponding to the non–zero
rows of B is consistent. First notice that r ≤n here.
If r = n, then c1 = 1, c2 = 2, · · · , cn = n and

There is a unique solution x1 = d1, x2 = d2, · · · , xn = dn.
If r < n, there will be more than one solution (inﬁnitely many if the
ﬁeld is inﬁnite).
For all solutions are obtained by taking the unknowns
xc1, · · · , xcr as dependent unknowns and using the r equations correspond-
ing to the non–zero rows of B to express these unknowns in terms of the
remaining independent unknowns xcr+1, . . . , xcn, which can take on arbi-
trary values:

=
b1 n+1 −b1cr+1xcr+1 −· · · −b1cnxcn

=

In particular, taking xcr+1 = 0, . . . , xcn−1 = 0 and xcn = 0, 1 respectively,
produces at least two solutions.

The last matrix is in reduced row–echelon form.
To solve the system of equations whose augmented matrix is the given
matrix over Z3, we see from the reduced row–echelon form that x = 1 and
y = 2 −2z = 2 + z, where z = 0, 1, 2. Hence there are three solutions
to the given system of linear equations: (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 0), (1, 0, 1) and
(1, 1, 2).
1.5
Homogeneous systems
A system of homogeneous linear equations is a system of the form
a11x1 + a12x2 + · · · + a1nxn
=
0
a21x1 + a22x2 + · · · + a2nxn
=
0
...
am1x1 + am2x2 + · · · + amnxn
=
0.
Such a system is always consistent as x1 = 0, · · · , xn = 0 is a solution.
This solution is called the trivial solution. Any other solution is called a
non–trivial solution.
For example the homogeneous system
x −y
=
0
x + y
=
0
has only the trivial solution, whereas the homogeneous system
x −y + z
=
0
x + y + z
=
0
has the complete solution x = −z, y = 0, z arbitrary. In particular, taking
z = 1 gives the non–trivial solution x = −1, y = 0, z = 1.
There is simple but fundamental theorem concerning homogeneous sys-
tems.
THEOREM 1.5.1 A homogeneous system of m linear equations in n un-
knowns always has a non–trivial solution if m < n.

1.6. PROBLEMS
17
Proof. Suppose that m < n and that the coeﬃcient matrix of the system
is row–equivalent to B, a matrix in reduced row–echelon form. Let r be the
number of non–zero rows in B. Then r ≤m < n and hence n −r > 0 and
so the number n −r of arbitrary unknowns is in fact positive. Taking one
of these unknowns to be 1 gives a non–trivial solution.
REMARK 1.5.1 Let two systems of homogeneous equations in n un-
knowns have coeﬃcient matrices A and B, respectively. If each row of B is
a linear combination of the rows of A (i.e. a sum of multiples of the rows
of A) and each row of A is a linear combination of the rows of B, then it is
easy to prove that the two systems have identical solutions. The converse is
true, but is not easy to prove. Similarly if A and B have the same reduced
row–echelon form, apart from possibly zero rows, then the two systems have
identical solutions and conversely.
There is a similar situation in the case of two systems of linear equations
(not necessarily homogeneous), with the proviso that in the statement of
the converse, the extra condition that both the systems are consistent, is
needed.

2.1
Matrix arithmetic
A matrix over a ﬁeld F is a rectangular array of elements from F. The sym-
bol Mm×n(F) denotes the collection of all m × n matrices over F. Matrices
will usually be denoted by capital letters and the equation A = [aij] means
that the element in the i–th row and j–th column of the matrix A equals
aij. It is also occasionally convenient to write aij = (A)ij. For the present,
all matrices will have rational entries, unless otherwise stated.
EXAMPLE 2.1.1 The formula aij = 1/(i + j) for 1 ≤i ≤3, 1 ≤j ≤4
deﬁnes a 3 × 4 matrix A = [aij], namely

DEFINITION 2.1.1 (Equality of matrices) Matrices A and B are said
to be equal if A and B have the same size and corresponding elements are
equal; that is A and B ∈Mm×n(F) and A = [aij], B = [bij], with aij = bij
for 1 ≤i ≤m, 1 ≤j ≤n.
DEFINITION 2.1.2 (Addition of matrices) Let A = [aij] and B =
[bij] be of the same size. Then A + B is the matrix obtained by adding
corresponding elements of A and B; that is
A + B = [aij] + [bij] = [aij + bij].

CHAPTER 2. MATRICES
DEFINITION 2.1.3 (Scalar multiple of a matrix) Let A = [aij] and
t ∈F (that is t is a scalar). Then tA is the matrix obtained by multiplying
all elements of A by t; that is
tA = t[aij] = [taij].
DEFINITION 2.1.4 (Additive inverse of a matrix) Let A = [aij] .
Then −A is the matrix obtained by replacing the elements of A by their
additive inverses; that is
−A = −[aij] = [−aij].
DEFINITION 2.1.5 (Subtraction of matrices) Matrix subtraction is
deﬁned for two matrices A = [aij] and B = [bij] of the same size, in the
usual way; that is
A −B = [aij] −[bij] = [aij −bij].
DEFINITION 2.1.6 (The zero matrix) For each m, n the matrix in
Mm×n(F), all of whose elements are zero, is called the zero matrix (of size
m × n) and is denoted by the symbol 0.
The matrix operations of addition, scalar multiplication, additive inverse
and subtraction satisfy the usual laws of arithmetic. (In what follows, s and
t will be arbitrary scalars and A, B, C are matrices of the same size.)
1. (A + B) + C = A + (B + C);
2. A + B = B + A;
3. 0 + A = A;
4. A + (−A) = 0;
5. (s + t)A = sA + tA,
(s −t)A = sA −tA;
6. t(A + B) = tA + tB,
t(A −B) = tA −tB;
7. s(tA) = (st)A;
8. 1A = A,
0A = 0,
(−1)A = −A;
9. tA = 0 ⇒t = 0 or A = 0.
Other similar properties will be used when needed.

DEFINITION 2.1.7 (Matrix product) Let A = [aij] be a matrix of
size m × n and B = [bjk] be a matrix of size n × p; (that is the number

matrix C = [cik] whose (i, k)–th element is deﬁned by the formula

Matrix multiplication obeys many of the familiar laws of arithmetic apart
from the commutative law.
1. (AB)C = A(BC) if A, B, C are m × n, n × p, p × q, respectively;
2. t(AB) = (tA)B = A(tB),
A(−B) = (−A)B = −(AB);
3. (A + B)C = AC + BC if A and B are m × n and C is n × p;
4. D(A + B) = DA + DB if A and B are m × n and D is p × m.
We prove the associative law only:
First observe that (AB)C and A(BC) are both of size m × q.
Let A = [aij], B = [bjk], C = [ckl]. Then

Linear transformations
An n–dimensional column vector is an n × 1 matrix over F. The collection
of all n–dimensional column vectors is denoted by F n.
Every matrix is associated with an important type of function called a
linear transformation.
DEFINITION 2.2.1 (Linear transformation) With A ∈Mm×n(F), we
associate the function TA : F n →F m deﬁned by TA(X) = AX for all
X ∈F n. More explicitly, using components, the above function takes the
form
y1
=
a11x1 + a12x2 + · · · + a1nxn
y2
=
a21x1 + a22x2 + · · · + a2nxn
...
ym
=
am1x1 + am2x2 + · · · + amnxn,
where y1, y2, · · · , ym are the components of the column vector TA(X).
The function just deﬁned has the property that
TA(sX + tY ) = sTA(X) + tTA(Y )
(2.1)
for all s, t ∈F and all n–dimensional column vectors X, Y . For
TA(sX + tY ) = A(sX + tY ) = s(AX) + t(AY ) = sTA(X) + tTA(Y ).

CHAPTER 2. MATRICES
REMARK 2.2.1 It is easy to prove that if T : F n →F m is a function
satisfying equation 2.1, then T = TA, where A is the m × n matrix whose
columns are T(E1), . . . , T(En), respectively, where E1, . . . , En are the n–
dimensional unit vectors deﬁned by

One well–known example of a linear transformation arises from rotating
the (x, y)–plane in 2-dimensional Euclidean space, anticlockwise through θ
radians.
Here a point (x, y) will be transformed into the point (x1, y1),
where
x1
=
x cos θ −y sin θ
y1
=
x sin θ + y cos θ.
In 3–dimensional Euclidean space, the equations
x1 = x cos θ −y sin θ, y1 = x sin θ + y cos θ, z1 = z;
x1 = x, y1 = y cos φ −z sin φ, z1 = y sin φ + z cos φ;
x1 = x cos ψ −z sin ψ, y1 = y, z1 = x sin ψ + z cos ψ;
correspond to rotations about the positive z, x, y–axes, anticlockwise through
θ, φ, ψ radians, respectively.
The product of two matrices is related to the product of the correspond-
ing linear transformations:
If A is m×n and B is n×p, then the function TATB : F p →F m, obtained
by ﬁrst performing TB, then TA is in fact equal to the linear transformation
TAB. For if X ∈F p, we have
TATB(X) = A(BX) = (AB)X = TAB(X).
The following example is useful for producing rotations in 3–dimensional
animated design. (See [27, pages 97–112].)
EXAMPLE 2.2.1 The linear transformation resulting from successively
rotating 3–dimensional space about the positive z, x, y–axes, anticlockwise
through θ, φ, ψ radians respectively, is equal to TABC, where

EXAMPLE 2.2.2 Another example of a linear transformation arising from
geometry is reﬂection of the plane in a line l inclined at an angle θ to the
positive x–axis.
We reduce the problem to the simpler case θ = 0, where the equations
of transformation are x1 = x, y1 = −y. First rotate the plane clockwise
through θ radians, thereby taking l into the x–axis; next reﬂect the plane in
the x–axis; then rotate the plane anticlockwise through θ radians, thereby
restoring l to its original position.

THEOREM 2.3.1 If A is m × n, then ImA = A = AIn.
DEFINITION 2.3.2 (k–th power of a matrix) If A is an n×n matrix,
we deﬁne Ak recursively as follows: A0 = In and Ak+1 = AkA for k ≥0.
For example A1 = A0A = InA = A and hence A2 = A1A = AA.
The usual index laws hold provided AB = BA:
1. AmAn = Am+n,
(Am)n = Amn;
2. (AB)n = AnBn;
3. AmBn = BnAm;

AXIOM 2.3.1 (PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION)
If for each n ≥1, Pn denotes a mathematical statement and
(i) P1 is true,

32

(ii) the truth of Pn implies that of Pn+1 for each n ≥1,
then Pn is true for all n ≥1.

Take Pn to be the statement
An =

Then P1 asserts that

which is true. Now let n ≥1 and assume that Pn is true. We have to deduce
that

and “the induction goes through”.
The last example has an application to the solution of a system of re-
currence relations:

2.4. PROBLEMS

EXAMPLE 2.3.2 The following system of recurrence relations holds for
all n ≥0:
xn+1
=
7xn + 4yn
yn+1

Solve the system for xn and yn in terms of x0 and y0.

We see that

Xn

(The truth of the equation Xn = AnX0 for n ≥1, strictly speaking
follows by mathematical induction; however for simple cases such as the
above, it is customary to omit the strict proof and supply instead a few
lines of motivation for the inductive statement.)
Hence the previous example gives

Non–singular matrices
DEFINITION 2.5.1 (Non–singular matrix)
A square matrix A ∈Mn×n(F) is called non–singular or invertible if
there exists a matrix B ∈Mn×n(F) such that
AB = In = BA.
Any matrix B with the above property is called an inverse of A. If A does
not have an inverse, A is called singular.

2.5. NON–SINGULAR MATRICES
37
THEOREM 2.5.1 (Inverses are unique)
If A has inverses B and C, then B = C.
Proof. Let B and C be inverses of A. Then AB = In = BA and AC =
In = CA. Then B(AC) = BIn = B and (BA)C = InC = C. Hence because
B(AC) = (BA)C, we deduce that B = C.
REMARK 2.5.1 If A has an inverse, it is denoted by A−1. So
AA−1 = In = A−1A.
Also if A is non–singular, it follows that A−1 is also non–singular and
(A−1)−1 = A.
THEOREM 2.5.2 If A and B are non–singular matrices of the same size,
then so is AB. Moreover
(AB)−1 = B−1A−1.
Proof.
(AB)(B−1A−1) = A(BB−1)A−1 = AInA−1 = AA−1 = In.
Similarly
(B−1A−1)(AB) = In.
REMARK 2.5.2 The above result generalizes to a product of m non–
singular matrices: If A1, . . . , Am are non–singular n × n matrices, then the
product A1 . . . Am is also non–singular. Moreover
(A1 . . . Am)−1 = A−1
m . . . A−1
1 .
(Thus the inverse of the product equals the product of the inverses in the
reverse order.)
EXAMPLE 2.5.1 If A and B are n × n matrices satisfying A2 = B2 =
(AB)2 = In, prove that AB = BA.
Solution. Assume A2 = B2 = (AB)2 = In. Then A, B, AB are non–
singular and A−1 = A, B−1 = B, (AB)−1 = AB.
But (AB)−1 = B−1A−1 and hence AB = BA.

THEOREM 2.5.6 Let A be a square matrix. If A is non–singular, the
homogeneous system AX = 0 has only the trivial solution. Equivalently,
if the homogenous system AX = 0 has a non–trivial solution, then A is
singular.
Proof. If A is non–singular and AX = 0, then X = A−10 = 0.
REMARK 2.5.4 If A∗1, . . . , A∗n denote the columns of A, then the equa-
tion

not all zero, such that
x1A∗1 + . . . + xnA∗n = 0,

2.5. NON–SINGULAR MATRICES

that is, if the columns of A are linearly dependent, then A is singular. An
equivalent way of saying that the columns of A are linearly dependent is that
one of the columns of A is expressible as a sum of certain scalar multiples
of the remaining columns of A; that is one column is a linear combination
of the remaining columns.

taining a zero row, then A is singular. For then the homogeneous system
AX = 0 has a non–trivial solution.
An important class of non–singular matrices is that of the elementary
row matrices.
DEFINITION 2.5.2 (Elementary row matrices) There are three types,
Eij, Ei(t), Eij(t), corresponding to the three kinds of elementary row oper-
ation:
1. Eij, (i ̸= j) is obtained from the identity matrix In by interchanging
rows i and j.
2. Ei(t), (t ̸= 0) is obtained by multiplying the i–th row of In by t.
3. Eij(t), (i ̸= j) is obtained from In by adding t times the j–th row of
In to the i–th row.

REMARK 2.5.6 Recall that A and B are row–equivalent if B is obtained
from A by a sequence of elementary row operations. If E1, . . . , Er are the
respective corresponding elementary row matrices, then
B = Er (. . . (E2(E1A)) . . .) = (Er . . . E1)A = PA,
where P = Er . . . E1 is non–singular. Conversely if B = PA, where P is
non–singular, then A is row–equivalent to B. For as we shall now see, P is
in fact a product of elementary row matrices.
THEOREM 2.5.8 Let A be non–singular n × n matrix. Then
(i) A is row–equivalent to In,
(ii) A is a product of elementary row matrices.
Proof. Assume that A is non–singular and let B be the reduced row–echelon
form of A. Then B has no zero rows, for otherwise the equation AX = 0
would have a non–trivial solution. Consequently B = In.
It follows that there exist elementary row matrices E1, . . . , Er such that
Er (. . . (E1A) . . .) = B = In and hence A = E−1

THEOREM 2.5.9 Let A be n × n and suppose that A is row–equivalent
to In. Then A is non–singular and A−1 can be found by performing the
same sequence of elementary row operations on In as were used to convert
A to In.
Proof. Suppose that Er . . . E1A = In. In other words BA = In, where
B = Er . . . E1 is non–singular. Then B−1(BA) = B−1In and so A = B−1,
which is non–singular.
Also A−1 =
¡
B−1¢−1 = B = Er ((. . . (E1In) . . .), which shows that A−1
is obtained from In by performing the same sequence of elementary row
operations as were used to convert A to In.

CHAPTER 2. MATRICES

express A as a product of elementary row matrices.
Solution. We form the partitioned matrix [A|I2] which consists of A followed
by I2. Then any sequence of elementary row operations which reduces A to
I2 will reduce I2 to A−1. Here
[A|I2] =

The next result is the converse of Theorem 2.5.6 and is useful for proving
the non–singularity of certain types of matrices.
THEOREM 2.5.10 Let A be an n × n matrix with the property that
the homogeneous system AX = 0 has only the trivial solution. Then A is
non–singular. Equivalently, if A is singular, then the homogeneous system
AX = 0 has a non–trivial solution.

2.5. NON–SINGULAR MATRICES
45
Proof. If A is n × n and the homogeneous system AX = 0 has only the
trivial solution, then it follows that the reduced row–echelon form B of A
cannot have zero rows and must therefore be In. Hence A is non–singular.
COROLLARY 2.5.3 Suppose that A and B are n × n and AB = In.
Then BA = In.
Proof. Let AB = In, where A and B are n × n. We ﬁrst show that B
is non–singular. Assume BX = 0. Then A(BX) = A0 = 0, so (AB)X =
0, InX = 0 and hence X = 0.
Then from AB = In we deduce (AB)B−1 = InB−1 and hence A = B−1.
The equation BB−1 = In then gives BA = In.
Before we give the next example of the above criterion for non-singularity,
we introduce an important matrix operation.
DEFINITION 2.5.3 (The transpose of a matrix) Let A be an m × n
matrix. Then At, the transpose of A, is the matrix obtained by interchanging
the rows and columns of A. In other words if A = [aij], then
¡
At¢
ji = aij.
Consequently At is n × m.
The transpose operation has the following properties:
1.
¡
At¢t = A;
2. (A ± B)t = At ± Bt if A and B are m × n;
3. (sA)t = sAt if s is a scalar;
4. (AB)t = BtAt if A is m × n and B is n × p;
5. If A is non–singular, then At is also non–singular and
¡
At¢−1 =
¡
A−1¢t ;
6. XtX = x2
1 + . . . + x2
n if X = [x1, . . . , xn]t is a column vector.
We prove only the fourth property. First check that both (AB)t and BtAt
have the same size (p × m).
Moreover, corresponding elements of both
matrices are equal. For if A = [aij] and B = [bjk], we have
¡

There are two important classes of matrices that can be deﬁned concisely
in terms of the transpose operation.
DEFINITION 2.5.4 (Symmetric matrix) A real matrix A is called sym-
metric if At = A. In other words A is square (n × n say) and aji = aij for
all 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤n. Hence
A =

is a general 2 × 2 symmetric matrix.
DEFINITION 2.5.5 (Skew–symmetric matrix) A real matrix A is called
skew–symmetric if At = −A. In other words A is square (n × n say) and
aji = −aij for all 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤n.
REMARK 2.5.8 Taking i = j in the deﬁnition of skew–symmetric matrix
gives aii = −aii and so aii = 0. Hence
A =

b
−b

is a general 2 × 2 skew–symmetric matrix.
We can now state a second application of the above criterion for non–
singularity.
COROLLARY 2.5.4 Let B be an n × n skew–symmetric matrix. Then
A = In −B is non–singular.
Proof. Let A = In −B, where Bt = −B. By Theorem 2.5.10 it suﬃces to
show that AX = 0 implies X = 0.
We have (In −B)X = 0, so X = BX. Hence XtX = XtBX.
Taking transposes of both sides gives
(XtBX)t
=
(XtX)t
XtBt(Xt)t
=
Xt(Xt)t
Xt(−B)X
=
XtX
−XtBX
=
XtX = XtBX.
Hence XtX = −XtX and XtX = 0. But if X = [x1, . . . , xn]t, then XtX =
x2
1 + . . . + x2
n = 0 and hence x1 = 0, . . . , xn = 0.

for i = 1, . . . , m. The equations represented by AtAX = AtB are called the
normal equations corresponding to the system AX = B and any solution
of the system of normal equations is called a least squares solution of the
original system.

SUBSPACES
3.1
Introduction
Throughout this chapter, we will be studying F n, the set of all n–dimensional
column vectors with components from a ﬁeld F. We continue our study of
matrices by considering an important class of subsets of F n called subspaces.
These arise naturally for example, when we solve a system of m linear ho-
mogeneous equations in n unknowns.
We also study the concept of linear dependence of a family of vectors.
This was introduced brieﬂy in Chapter 2, Remark 2.5.4. Other topics dis-
cussed are the row space, column space and null space of a matrix over F,
the dimension of a subspace, particular examples of the latter being the rank
and nullity of a matrix.
3.2
Subspaces of F n
DEFINITION 3.2.1 A subset S of F n is called a subspace of F n if
1. The zero vector belongs to S; (that is, 0 ∈S);
2. If u ∈S and v ∈S, then u + v ∈S; (S is said to be closed under
vector addition);
3. If u ∈S and t ∈F, then tu ∈S; (S is said to be closed under scalar
multiplication).
EXAMPLE 3.2.1 Let A ∈Mm×n(F). Then the set of vectors X ∈F n
satisfying AX = 0 is a subspace of F n called the null space of A and is
denoted here by N(A). (It is sometimes called the solution space of A.)
55

56
CHAPTER 3. SUBSPACES
Proof. (1) A0 = 0, so 0 ∈N(A); (2) If X, Y ∈N(A), then AX = 0 and
AY = 0, so A(X + Y ) = AX + AY = 0 + 0 = 0 and so X + Y ∈N(A); (3)
If X ∈N(A) and t ∈F, then A(tX) = t(AX) = t0 = 0, so tX ∈N(A).
For example, if A =
· 1
0
0
1
¸
, then N(A) = {0}, the set consisting of
just the zero vector. If A =
· 1
2
2
4
¸
, then N(A) is the set of all scalar
multiples of [−2, 1]t.
EXAMPLE 3.2.2 Let X1, . . . , Xm ∈F n. Then the set consisting of all
linear combinations x1X1 + · · · + xmXm, where x1, . . . , xm ∈F, is a sub-
space of F n. This subspace is called the subspace spanned or generated by
X1, . . . , Xm and is denoted here by ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩. We also call X1, . . . , Xm
a spanning family for S = ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩.
Proof.
(1) 0 = 0X1 + · · · + 0Xm, so 0 ∈⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩; (2) If X, Y ∈
⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩, then X = x1X1 + · · · + xmXm and Y = y1X1 + · · · + ymXm,
so
X + Y
=
(x1X1 + · · · + xmXm) + (y1X1 + · · · + ymXm)
=
(x1 + y1)X1 + · · · + (xm + ym)Xm ∈⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩.
(3) If X ∈⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩and t ∈F, then
X
=
x1X1 + · · · + xmXm
tX
=
t(x1X1 + · · · + xmXm)
=
(tx1)X1 + · · · + (txm)Xm ∈⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩.
For example, if A ∈Mm×n(F), the subspace generated by the columns of A
is an important subspace of F m and is called the column space of A. The
column space of A is denoted here by C(A). Also the subspace generated
by the rows of A is a subspace of F n and is called the row space of A and is
denoted by R(A).
EXAMPLE 3.2.3 For example F n = ⟨E1, . . . , En⟩, where E1, . . . , En are
the n–dimensional unit vectors. For if X = [x1, . . . , xn]t ∈F n, then X =
x1E1 + · · · + xnEn.
EXAMPLE 3.2.4 Find a spanning family for the subspace S of R3 deﬁned
by the equation 2x −3y + 5z = 0.

3.2. SUBSPACES OF F N
57
Solution. (S is in fact the null space of [2, −3, 5], so S is indeed a subspace
of R3.)
If [x, y, z]t ∈S, then x = 3

and conversely. Hence [ 3
2, 1, 0]t and [−5
2, 0, 1]t form a spanning family for
S.
The following result is easy to prove:
LEMMA 3.2.1 Suppose each of X1, . . . , Xr is a linear combination of
Y1, . . . , Ys. Then any linear combination of X1, . . . , Xr is a linear combi-
nation of Y1, . . . , Ys.
As a corollary we have
THEOREM 3.2.1 Subspaces ⟨X1, . . . , Xr⟩and ⟨Y1, . . . , Ys⟩are equal if
each of X1, . . . , Xr is a linear combination of Y1, . . . , Ys and each of Y1, . . . , Ys
is a linear combination of X1, . . . , Xr.
COROLLARY 3.2.1 Subspaces ⟨X1, . . . , Xr, Z1, . . . , Zt⟩and ⟨X1, . . . , Xr⟩
are equal if each of Z1, . . . , Zt is a linear combination of X1, . . . , Xr.
EXAMPLE 3.2.5 If X and Y are vectors in Rn, then
⟨X, Y ⟩= ⟨X + Y, X −Y ⟩.
Solution. Each of X + Y and X −Y is a linear combination of X and Y .
Also
X = 1
2(X + Y ) + 1
2(X −Y )
and
Y = 1
2(X + Y ) −1
2(X −Y ),
so each of X and Y is a linear combination of X + Y and X −Y .
There is an important application of Theorem 3.2.1 to row equivalent
matrices (see Deﬁnition 1.2.4):
THEOREM 3.2.2 If A is row equivalent to B, then R(A) = R(B).
Proof. Suppose that B is obtained from A by a sequence of elementary row
operations. Then it is easy to see that each row of B is a linear combination
of the rows of A. But A can be obtained from B by a sequence of elementary
operations, so each row of A is a linear combination of the rows of B. Hence
by Theorem 3.2.1, R(A) = R(B).

58

3.3
Linear dependence
We now recall the deﬁnition of linear dependence and independence of a
family of vectors in F n given in Chapter 2.
DEFINITION 3.3.1 Vectors X1, . . . , Xm in F n are said to be linearly
dependent if there exist scalars x1, . . . , xm, not all zero, such that
x1X1 + · · · + xmXm = 0.
In other words, X1, . . . , Xm are linearly dependent if some Xi is expressible
as a linear combination of the remaining vectors.
X1, . . . , Xm are called linearly independent if they are not linearly depen-
dent. Hence X1, . . . , Xm are linearly independent if and only if the equation
x1X1 + · · · + xmXm = 0
has only the trivial solution x1 = 0, . . . , xm = 0.

REMARK 3.3.1 If X1, . . . , Xm are linearly independent and
x1X1 + · · · + xmXm = y1X1 + · · · + ymXm,
then x1 = y1, . . . , xm = ym. For the equation can be rewritten as
(x1 −y1)X1 + · · · + (xm −ym)Xm = 0
and so x1 −y1 = 0, . . . , xm −ym = 0.
THEOREM 3.3.1 A family of m vectors in F n will be linearly dependent
if m > n. Equivalently, any linearly independent family of m vectors in F n
must satisfy m ≤n.
Proof. The equation
x1X1 + · · · + xmXm = 0
is equivalent to n homogeneous equations in m unknowns. By Theorem 1.5.1,
such a system has a non–trivial solution if m > n.
The following theorem is an important generalization of the last result
and is left as an exercise for the interested student:
THEOREM 3.3.2 A family of s vectors in ⟨X1, . . . , Xr⟩will be linearly
dependent if s > r. Equivalently, a linearly independent family of s vectors
in ⟨X1, . . . , Xr⟩must have s ≤r.
Here is a useful criterion for linear independence which is sometimes
called the left–to–right test:
THEOREM 3.3.3 Vectors X1, . . . , Xm in F n are linearly independent if
(a) X1 ̸= 0;
(b) For each k with 1 < k ≤m, Xk is not a linear combination of
X1, . . . , Xk−1.
One application of this criterion is the following result:
THEOREM 3.3.4 Every subspace S of F n can be represented in the form
S = ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩, where m ≤n.

60
CHAPTER 3. SUBSPACES
Proof. If S = {0}, there is nothing to prove – we take X1 = 0 and m = 1.
So we assume S contains a non–zero vector X1; then ⟨X1⟩⊆S as S is a
subspace. If S = ⟨X1⟩, we are ﬁnished. If not, S will contain a vector X2,
not a linear combination of X1; then ⟨X1, X2⟩⊆S as S is a subspace. If
S = ⟨X1, X2⟩, we are ﬁnished. If not, S will contain a vector X3 which is
not a linear combination of X1 and X2. This process must eventually stop,
for at stage k we have constructed a family of k linearly independent vectors
X1, . . . , Xk, all lying in F n and hence k ≤n.
There is an important relationship between the columns of A and B, if
A is row–equivalent to B.
THEOREM 3.3.5 Suppose that A is row equivalent to B and let c1, . . . , cr
be distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ci ≤n. Then
(a) Columns A∗c1, . . . , A∗cr of A are linearly dependent if and only if the
corresponding columns of B are linearly dependent; indeed more is
true:
x1A∗c1 + · · · + xrA∗cr = 0 ⇔x1B∗c1 + · · · + xrB∗cr = 0.
(b) Columns A∗c1, . . . , A∗cr of A are linearly independent if and only if the
corresponding columns of B are linearly independent.
(c) If 1 ≤cr+1 ≤n and cr+1 is distinct from c1, . . . , cr, then
A∗cr+1 = z1A∗c1 + · · · + zrA∗cr ⇔B∗cr+1 = z1B∗c1 + · · · + zrB∗cr.
Proof. First observe that if Y = [y1, . . . , yn]t is an n–dimensional column
vector and A is m × n, then
AY = y1A∗1 + · · · + ynA∗n.
Also AY = 0 ⇔BY = 0, if B is row equivalent to A. Then (a) follows by
taking yi = xcj if i = cj and yi = 0 otherwise.
(b) is logically equivalent to (a), while (c) follows from (a) as
A∗cr+1 = z1A∗c1 + · · · + zrA∗cr
⇔
z1A∗c1 + · · · + zrA∗cr + (−1)A∗cr+1 = 0
⇔
z1B∗c1 + · · · + zrB∗cr + (−1)B∗cr+1 = 0
⇔
B∗cr+1 = z1B∗c1 + · · · + zrB∗cr.

Basis of a subspace
We now come to the important concept of basis of a vector subspace.
DEFINITION 3.4.1 Vectors X1, . . . , Xm belonging to a subspace S are
said to form a basis of S if
(a) Every vector in S is a linear combination of X1, . . . , Xm;
(b) X1, . . . , Xm are linearly independent.
Note that (a) is equivalent to the statement that S = ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩as we
automatically have ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩⊆S. Also, in view of Remark 3.3.1 above,
(a) and (b) are equivalent to the statement that every vector in S is uniquely
expressible as a linear combination of X1, . . . , Xm.
EXAMPLE 3.4.1 The unit vectors E1, . . . , En form a basis for F n.

62
CHAPTER 3. SUBSPACES
REMARK 3.4.1 The subspace {0}, consisting of the zero vector alone,
does not have a basis. For every vector in a linearly independent family
must necessarily be non–zero. (For example, if X1 = 0, then we have the
non–trivial linear relation
1X1 + 0X2 + · · · + 0Xm = 0
and X1, . . . , Xm would be linearly dependent.)
However if we exclude this case, every other subspace of F n has a basis:
THEOREM 3.4.1 A subspace of the form ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩, where at least
one of X1, . . . , Xm is non–zero, has a basis Xc1, . . . , Xcr, where 1 ≤c1 <
· · · < cr ≤m.
Proof. (The left–to–right algorithm). Let c1 be the least index k for which
Xk is non–zero. If c1 = m or if all the vectors Xk with k > c1 are linear
combinations of Xc1, terminate the algorithm and let r = 1. Otherwise let
c2 be the least integer k > c1 such that Xk is not a linear combination of
Xc1.
If c2 = m or if all the vectors Xk with k > c2 are linear combinations
of Xc1 and Xc2, terminate the algorithm and let r = 2.
Eventually the
algorithm will terminate at the r–th stage, either because cr = m, or because
all vectors Xk with k > cr are linear combinations of Xc1, . . . , Xcr.
Then it is clear by the construction of Xc1, . . . , Xcr, using Corollary 3.2.1
that
(a) ⟨Xc1, . . . , Xcr⟩= ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩;
(b) the vectors Xc1, . . . , Xcr are linearly independent by the left–to–right
test.
Consequently Xc1, . . . , Xcr form a basis (called the left–to–right basis) for
the subspace ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩.
EXAMPLE 3.4.2 Let X and Y be linearly independent vectors in Rn.
Then the subspace ⟨0, 2X, X, −Y, X +Y ⟩has left–to–right basis consisting
of 2X, −Y .
A subspace S will in general have more than one basis. For example, any
permutation of the vectors in a basis will yield another basis. Given one
particular basis, one can determine all bases for S using a simple formula.
This is left as one of the problems at the end of this chapter.
We settle for the following important fact about bases:

3.4. BASIS OF A SUBSPACE
63
THEOREM 3.4.2 Any two bases for a subspace S must contain the same
number of elements.
Proof.
For if X1, . . . , Xr and Y1, . . . , Ys are bases for S, then Y1, . . . , Ys
form a linearly independent family in S = ⟨X1, . . . , Xr⟩and hence s ≤r by
Theorem 3.3.2. Similarly r ≤s and hence r = s.
DEFINITION 3.4.2 This number is called the dimension of S and is
written dim S. Naturally we deﬁne dim {0} = 0.
It follows from Theorem 3.3.1 that for any subspace S of F n, we must have
dim S ≤n.
EXAMPLE 3.4.3 If E1, . . . , En denote the n–dimensional unit vectors in
F n, then dim ⟨E1, . . . , Ei⟩= i for 1 ≤i ≤n.
The following result gives a useful way of exhibiting a basis.
THEOREM 3.4.3 A linearly independent family of m vectors in a sub-
space S, with dim S = m, must be a basis for S.
Proof.
Let X1, . . . , Xm be a linearly independent family of vectors in a
subspace S, where dim S = m. We have to show that every vector X ∈S is
expressible as a linear combination of X1, . . . , Xm. We consider the following
family of vectors in S: X1, . . . , Xm, X. This family contains m+1 elements
and is consequently linearly dependent by Theorem 3.3.2. Hence we have
x1X1 + · · · + xmXm + xm+1X = 0,
(3.1)
where not all of x1, . . . , xm+1 are zero. Now if xm+1 = 0, we would have
x1X1 + · · · + xmXm = 0,
with not all of x1, . . . , xm zero, contradictiong the assumption that X1 . . . , Xm
are linearly independent. Hence xm+1 ̸= 0 and we can use equation 3.1 to
express X as a linear combination of X1, . . . , Xm:
X = −x1
xm+1
X1 + · · · + −xm
xm+1
Xm.

3.5
Rank and nullity of a matrix
We can now deﬁne three important integers associated with a matrix.
DEFINITION 3.5.1 Let A ∈Mm×n(F). Then
(a) column rank A = dim C(A);
(b) row rank A = dim R(A);
(c) nullity A = dim N(A).
We will now see that the reduced row–echelon form B of a matrix A allows
us to exhibit bases for the row space, column space and null space of A.
Moreover, an examination of the number of elements in each of these bases
will immediately result in the following theorem:
THEOREM 3.5.1 Let A ∈Mm×n(F). Then
(a) column rank A = row rank A;
(b) column rank A+ nullity A = n.
Finding a basis for R(A): The r non–zero rows of B form a basis for R(A)
and hence row rank A = r.
For we have seen earlier that R(A) = R(B). Also
R(B)
=
⟨B1∗, . . . , Bm∗⟩
=
⟨B1∗, . . . , Br∗, 0 . . . , 0⟩
=
⟨B1∗, . . . , Br∗⟩.
The linear independence of the non–zero rows of B is proved as follows: Let
the leading entries of rows 1, . . . , r of B occur in columns c1, . . . , cr. Suppose
that
x1B1∗+ · · · + xrBr∗= 0.
Then equating components c1, . . . , cr of both sides of the last equation, gives
x1 = 0, . . . , xr = 0, in view of the fact that B is in reduced row– echelon
form.
Finding a basis for C(A): The r columns A∗c1, . . . , A∗cr form a basis for
C(A) and hence column rank A = r. For it is clear that columns c1, . . . , cr
of B form the left–to–right basis for C(B) and consequently from parts (b)
and (c) of Theorem 3.3.5, it follows that columns c1, . . . , cr of A form the
left–to–right basis for C(A).

3.5. RANK AND NULLITY OF A MATRIX
65
Finding a basis for N(A): For notational simplicity, let us suppose that c1 =
1, . . . , cr = r. Then B has the form
B =

Then N(B) and hence N(A) are determined by the equations

...
xr
=
(−brr+1)xr+1 + · · · + (−brn)xn,

xr+1X1 + · · · + xnXn−r.
Hence N(A) is spanned by X1, . . . , Xn−r, as xr+1, . . . , xn are arbitrary. Also
X1, . . . , Xn−r are linearly independent. For equating the right hand side of
equation 3.2 to 0 and then equating components r + 1, . . . , n of both sides
of the resulting equation, gives xr+1 = 0, . . . , xn = 0.
Consequently X1, . . . , Xn−r form a basis for N(A).
Theorem 3.5.1 now follows. For we have
row rank A
=
dim R(A) = r
column rank A
=
dim C(A) = r.
Hence
row rank A = column rank A.

66
CHAPTER 3. SUBSPACES
Also
column rank A + nullity A = r + dim N(A) = r + (n −r) = n.
DEFINITION 3.5.2 The common value of column rank A and row rank A
is called the rank of A and is denoted by rank A.

We conclude this introduction to vector spaces with a result of great
theoretical importance.
THEOREM 3.5.2 Every linearly independent family of vectors in a sub-
space S can be extended to a basis of S.
Proof. Suppose S has basis X1, . . . , Xm and that Y1, . . . , Yr is a linearly
independent family of vectors in S. Then
S = ⟨X1, . . . , Xm⟩= ⟨Y1, . . . , Yr, X1, . . . , Xm⟩,
as each of Y1, . . . , Yr is a linear combination of X1, . . . , Xm.
Then applying the left–to–right algorithm to the second spanning family
for S will yield a basis for S which includes Y1, . . . , Yr.

For a general triangle P1P2P3, with Pi = (xi, yi), i = 1, 2, 3, we can
take P1 as the origin. Then the above formula gives

according as vertices P1P2P3 are anti–clockwise or clockwise oriented.
We now give a recursive deﬁnition of the determinant of an n×n matrix
A = [aij], n ≥3.
DEFINITION 4.0.2 (Minor) Let Mij(A) (or simply Mij if there is no
ambiguity) denote the determinant of the (n −1) × (n −1) submatrix of A
formed by deleting the i–th row and j–th column of A. (Mij(A) is called
the (i, j) minor of A.)
Assume that the determinant function has been deﬁned for matrices of
size (n−1)×(n−1). Then det A is deﬁned by the so–called ﬁrst–row Laplace

73
expansion:
det A
=
a11M11(A) −a12M12(A) + . . . + (−1)1+nM1n(A)
=
n
X
j=1
(−1)1+ja1jM1j(A).
For example, if A = [aij] is a 3 × 3 matrix, the Laplace expansion gives
det A = a11M11(A) −a12M12(A) + a13M13(A)
=

=
a11a22a33 −a11a23a32 −a12a21a33 + a12a23a31 + a13a21a32 −a13a22a31.
(The recursive deﬁnition also works for 2 × 2 determinants, if we deﬁne the
determinant of a 1 × 1 matrix [t] to be the scalar t:
det A = a11M11(A) −a12M12(A) = a11a22 −a12a21.)

One property of determinants that follows immediately from the deﬁni-
tion is the following:
THEOREM 4.0.1 If a row of a matrix is zero, then the value of the de-
terminant is zero.

74
CHAPTER 4. DETERMINANTS
(The corresponding result for columns also holds, but here a simple proof
by induction is needed.)
One of the simplest determinants to evaluate is that of a lower triangular
matrix.
THEOREM 4.0.2 Let A = [aij], where aij = 0 if i < j. Then
det A = a11a22 . . . ann.
(4.1)
An important special case is when A is a diagonal matrix.
If A =diag (a1, . . . , an) then det A = a1 . . . an. In particular, for a scalar
matrix tIn, we have det (tIn) = tn.
Proof. Use induction on the size n of the matrix.
The result is true for n = 2. Now let n > 2 and assume the result true
for matrices of size n −1. If A is n × n, then expanding det A along row 1
gives
det A
=

a33

...
an1
an2
. . .
ann
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
=
a11(a22 . . . ann)
by the induction hypothesis.
If A is upper triangular, equation 4.1 remains true and the proof is again
an exercise in induction, with the slight diﬀerence that the column version
of theorem 4.0.1 is needed.
REMARK 4.0.1 It can be shown that the expanded form of the determi-
nant of an n × n matrix A consists of n! signed products ±a1i1a2i2 . . . anin,
where (i1, i2, . . . , in) is a permutation of (1, 2, . . . , n), the sign being 1 or
−1, according as the number of inversions of (i1, i2, . . . , in) is even or odd.
An inversion occurs when ir > is but r < s. (The proof is not easy and is
omitted.)
The deﬁnition of the determinant of an n × n matrix was given in terms
of the ﬁrst–row expansion.
The next theorem says that we can expand
the determinant along any row or column. (The proof is not easy and is
omitted.)

75
THEOREM 4.0.3
det A =
n
X
j=1
(−1)i+jaijMij(A)
for i = 1, . . . , n (the so–called i–th row expansion) and
det A =
n
X
i=1
(−1)i+jaijMij(A)
for j = 1, . . . , n (the so–called j–th column expansion).
REMARK 4.0.2 The expression (−1)i+j obeys the chess–board pattern
of signs:

The following theorems can be proved by straightforward inductions on
the size of the matrix:
THEOREM 4.0.4 A matrix and its transpose have equal determinants;
that is
det At = det A.
THEOREM 4.0.5 If two rows of a matrix are equal, the determinant is
zero. Similarly for columns.
THEOREM 4.0.6 If two rows of a matrix are interchanged, the determi-
nant changes sign.
EXAMPLE 4.0.2 If P1 = (x1, y1) and P2 = (x2, y2) are distinct points,
then the line through P1 and P2 has equation
¯¯¯¯¯¯
x
y

x1
y1

¯¯¯¯¯¯
= 0.

76
CHAPTER 4. DETERMINANTS
For, expanding the determinant along row 1, the equation becomes
ax + by + c = 0,
where
a =

y1

y2

¯¯¯¯ = y1 −y2 and b = −
¯¯¯¯
x1

x2

¯¯¯¯ = x2 −x1.
This represents a line, as not both a and b can be zero. Also this line passes
through Pi, i = 1, 2. For the determinant has its ﬁrst and i–th rows equal
if x = xi and y = yi and is consequently zero.
There is a corresponding formula in three–dimensional geometry.
If
P1, P2, P3 are non–collinear points in three–dimensional space, with Pi =
(xi, yi, zi), i = 1, 2, 3, then the equation

represents the plane through P1, P2, P3. For, expanding the determinant
along row 1, the equation becomes ax + by + cz + d = 0, where
a =

.
As we shall see in chapter 6, this represents a plane if at least one of a, b, c
is non–zero.
However, apart from sign and a factor
1
2, the determinant
expressions for a, b, c give the values of the areas of projections of triangle
P1P2P3 on the (y, z), (x, z) and (x, y) planes, respectively. Geometrically,
it is then clear that at least one of a, b, c is non–zero. It is also possible to
give an algebraic proof of this fact.
Finally, the plane passes through Pi, i = 1, 2, 3 as the determinant has
its ﬁrst and i–th rows equal if x = xi, y = yi, z = zi and is consequently
zero. We now work towards proving that a matrix is non–singular if its
determinant is non–zero.
DEFINITION 4.0.3 (Cofactor) The (i, j) cofactor of A, denoted by
Cij(A) (or Cij if there is no ambiguity) is deﬁned by
Cij(A) = (−1)i+jMij(A).

77
REMARK 4.0.3 It is important to notice that Cij(A), like Mij(A), does
not depend on aij. Use will be made of this observation presently.
In terms of the cofactor notation, Theorem 4.0.3 takes the form
THEOREM 4.0.7
det A =
n
X
j=1
aijCij(A)
for i = 1, . . . , n and
det A =
n
X
i=1
aijCij(A)
for j = 1, . . . , n.
Another result involving cofactors is
THEOREM 4.0.8 Let A be an n × n matrix. Then
(a)
n
X
j=1
aijCkj(A) = 0
if i ̸= k.
Also
(b)
n
X
i=1
aijCik(A) = 0
if j ̸= k.
Proof.
If A is n×n and i ̸= k, let B be the matrix obtained from A by replacing
row k by row i. Then det B = 0 as B has two identical rows.
Now expand det B along row k. We get
0 = det B
=
n
X
j=1
bkjCkj(B)

in view of Remark 4.0.3.

CHAPTER 4. DETERMINANTS
DEFINITION 4.0.4 (Adjoint) If A = [aij] is an n × n matrix, the ad-
joint of A, denoted by adj A, is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors.
Hence

Theorems 4.0.7 and 4.0.8 may be combined to give
THEOREM 4.0.9 Let A be an n × n matrix. Then
A(adj A) = (det A)In = (adj A)A.
Proof.
(A adj A)ik

j=1
aij(adj A)jk

Hence A(adj A) = (det A)In. The other equation is proved similarly.

REMARK 4.0.4 From theorems 4.0.6, 4.0.10 and corollary 4.0.2, we de-
duce
(a) det (EijA) = −det A,
(b) det (Ei(t)A) = t det A, if t ̸= 0,

82
CHAPTER 4. DETERMINANTS
(c) det (Eij(t)A) =det A.
It follows that if A is row–equivalent to B, then det B = c det A, where c ̸= 0.
Hence det B ̸= 0 ⇔det A ̸= 0 and det B = 0 ⇔det A = 0. Consequently
from theorem 2.5.8 and remark 2.5.7, we have the following important result:
THEOREM 4.0.11 Let A be an n × n matrix. Then
(i) A is non–singular if and only if det A ̸= 0;
(ii) A is singular if and only if det A = 0;
(iii) the homogeneous system AX = 0 has a non–trivial solution if and
only if det A = 0.
EXAMPLE 4.0.7 Find the rational numbers a for which the following
homogeneous system has a non–trivial solution and solve the system for
these values of a:
x −2y + 3z
=
0
ax + 3y + 2z
=
0
6x + y + az
=
0.
Solution. The coeﬃcient determinant of the system is

=
2a2 + 6a −80 = 2(a + 8)(a −5).
So ∆= 0 ⇔a = −8 or a = 5 and these values of a are the only values for
which the given homogeneous system has a non–trivial solution.
If a = −8, the coeﬃcient matrix has reduced row–echelon form equal to

consistent and solve the system in each case:
x + y

following homogeneous system

tx + y + tz
=

(1 + t)x + 2y + 3z

x = x0,
y = y0,
z = −1.
Hence the coeﬃcient determinant ∆is zero. However

which has the unique solution x = 1, y = 0.
To ﬁnish this section, we present an old (1750) method of solving a
system of n equations in n unknowns called Cramer’s rule . The method is
not used in practice. However it has a theoretical use as it reveals explicitly
how the solution depends on the coeﬃcients of the augmented matrix.
THEOREM 4.0.12 (Cramer’s rule) The system of n linear equations
in n unknowns x1, . . . , xn

x1 = ∆1
∆, x2 = ∆2
∆, . . . , xn = ∆n
∆,
where ∆i is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the i–th
column of the coeﬃcient matrix A by the entries b1, b2, . . . , bn.
Proof. Suppose the coeﬃcient determinant ∆̸= 0. Then by corollary 4.0.1,
A−1 exists and is given by A−1 =

CHAPTER 5. COMPLEX NUMBERS
Complex numbers of the form i{y}, where y is a non–zero real number, are
called imaginary numbers.
If two complex numbers are equal, we can equate their real and imaginary
parts:
{x1} + i{y1} = {x2} + i{y2} ⇒x1 = x2 and y1 = y2,
if x1, x2, y1, y2 are real numbers. Noting that {0} + i{0} = {0}, gives the
useful special case is
{x} + i{y} = {0} ⇒x = 0 and y = 0,
if x and y are real numbers.
The sum and product of two real complex numbers are also real complex
numbers:
{x} + {y} = {x + y},
{x}{y} = {xy}.
Also, as real complex numbers are scalar matrices, their arithmetic is very
simple.
They form a ﬁeld under the operations of matrix addition and
multiplication. The additive identity is {0}, the additive inverse of {x} is
{−x}, the multiplicative identity is {1} and the multiplicative inverse of {x}
is {x−1}. Consequently
{x} −{y} = {x} + (−{y}) = {x} + {−y} = {x −y},
{x}
{y} = {x}{y}−1 = {x}{y−1} = {xy−1} =
½x
y
¾
.
It is customary to blur the distinction between the real complex number
{x} and the real number x and write {x} as x. Thus we write the complex
number {x} + i{y} simply as x + iy.
More generally, the sum of two complex numbers is a complex number:
(x1 + iy1) + (x2 + iy2) = (x1 + x2) + i(y1 + y2);
(5.1)
and (using the fact that scalar matrices commute with all matrices under
matrix multiplication and {−1}A = −A if A is a matrix), the product of
two complex numbers is a complex number:
(x1 + iy1)(x2 + iy2) = x1(x2 + iy2) + (iy1)(x2 + iy2)
= x1x2 + x1(iy2) + (iy1)x2 + (iy1)(iy2)
= x1x2 + ix1y2 + iy1x2 + i2y1y2
= (x1x2 + {−1}y1y2) + i(x1y2 + y1x2)
= (x1x2 −y1y2) + i(x1y2 + y1x2),
(5.2)

5.2. CALCULATING WITH COMPLEX NUMBERS
91
The set C of complex numbers forms a ﬁeld under the operations of
matrix addition and multiplication. The additive identity is 0, the additive
inverse of x + iy is the complex number (−x) + i(−y), the multiplicative
identity is 1 and the multiplicative inverse of the non–zero complex number
x + iy is the complex number u + iv, where
u =
x
x2 + y2 and v =
−y
x2 + y2 .
(If x + iy ̸= 0, then x ̸= 0 or y ̸= 0, so x2 + y2 ̸= 0.)
From equations 5.1 and 5.2, we observe that addition and multiplication
of complex numbers is performed just as for real numbers, replacing i2 by
−1, whenever it occurs.
A useful identity satisﬁed by complex numbers is
r2 + s2 = (r + is)(r −is).
This leads to a method of expressing the ratio of two complex numbers in
the form x + iy, where x and y are real complex numbers.
x1 + iy1
x2 + iy2
=
(x1 + iy1)(x2 −iy2)
(x2 + iy2)(x2 −iy2)
=
(x1x2 + y1y2) + i(−x1y2 + y1x2)
x2
2 + y2
2
.
The process is known as rationalization of the denominator.
5.2
Calculating with complex numbers
We can now do all the standard linear algebra calculations over the ﬁeld of
complex numbers – ﬁnd the reduced row–echelon form of an matrix whose el-
ements are complex numbers, solve systems of linear equations, ﬁnd inverses
and calculate determinants.
For example,

Then by Cramer’s rule, the linear system

=

and similarly w = −698

185i.
An important property enjoyed by complex numbers is that every com-
plex number has a square root:
THEOREM 5.2.1
If w is a non–zero complex number, then the equation z2 = w has a so-
lution z ∈C.
Proof. Let w = a + ib, a, b ∈R.
Case 1. Suppose b = 0. Then if a > 0, z = √a is a solution, while if
a < 0, i√−a is a solution.
Case 2. Suppose b ̸= 0. Let z = x + iy, x, y ∈R. Then the equation
z2 = w becomes
(x + iy)2 = x2 −y2 + 2xyi = a + ib,

5.2. CALCULATING WITH COMPLEX NUMBERS

so equating real and imaginary parts gives
x2 −y2 = a
and
2xy = b.
Hence x ̸= 0 and y = b/(2x). Consequently
x2 −

¶
2 = a,
so 4x4 −4ax2 −b2 = 0 and 4(x2)2 −4a(x2) −b2 = 0. Hence

However x2 > 0, so we must take the + sign, as a −

Then y is determined by y = b/(2x).
EXAMPLE 5.2.1 Solve the equation z2 = 1 + i.
Solution. Put z = x + iy. Then the equation becomes
(x + iy)2 = x2 −y2 + 2xyi = 1 + i,
so equating real and imaginary parts gives
x2 −y2 = 1 and 2xy = 1.
Hence x ̸= 0 and y = b/(2x). Consequently

Solution.
We have to solve the equation z3 = 1, or z3 −1 = 0.
Now
z3 −1 = (z −1)(z2 + z + 1). So z3 −1 = 0 ⇒z −1 = 0 or z2 + z + 1 = 0.
But
z2 + z + 1 = 0 ⇒z = −1 ±

So there are 3 cube roots of 1, namely 1 and (−1 ±

We state the next theorem without proof.
It states that every non–
constant polynomial with complex number coeﬃcients has a root in the
ﬁeld of complex numbers.
THEOREM 5.2.2 (Gauss) If f(z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0,
where an ̸= 0 and n ≥1, then f(z) = 0 for some z ∈C.
It follows that in view of the factor theorem, which states that if a ∈F is
a root of a polynomial f(z) with coeﬃcients from a ﬁeld F, then z −a is a
factor of f(z), that is f(z) = (z −a)g(z), where the coeﬃcients of g(z) also
belong to F. By repeated application of this result, we can factorize any
polynomial with complex coeﬃcients into a product of linear factors with
complex coeﬃcients:
f(z) = an(z −z1)(z −z2) · · · (z −zn).
There are available a number of computational algorithms for ﬁnding good
approximations to the roots of a polynomial with complex coeﬃcients.
5.3
Geometric representation of C
Complex numbers can be represented as points in the plane, using the cor-
respondence x + iy ↔(x, y). The representation is known as the Argand
diagram or complex plane.
The real complex numbers lie on the x–axis,
which is then called the real axis, while the imaginary numbers lie on the
y–axis, which is known as the imaginary axis. The complex numbers with
positive imaginary part lie in the upper half plane, while those with negative
imaginary part lie in the lower half plane.
Because of the equation
(x1 + iy1) + (x2 + iy2) = (x1 + x2) + i(y1 + y2),
complex numbers add vectorially, using the parallellogram law. Similarly,
the complex number z1 −z2 can be represented by the vector from (x2, y2)
to (x1, y1), where z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2. (See Figure 5.1.)

The geometrical representation of complex numbers can be very useful
when complex number methods are used to investigate properties of triangles
and circles. It is very important in the branch of calculus known as Complex
Function theory, where geometric methods play an important role.
We mention that the line through two distinct points P1 = (x1, y1) and
P2 = (x2, y2) has the form z = (1 −t)z1 + tz2, t ∈R, where z = x + iy is
any point on the line and zi = xi + iyi, i = 1, 2. For the line has parametric
equations
x = (1 −t)x1 + tx2,
y = (1 −t)y1 + ty2
and these can be combined into a single equation z = (1 −t)z1 + tz2.
Circles have various equation representations in terms of complex num-
bers, as will be seen later.

Complex conjugate
DEFINITION 5.4.1 (Complex conjugate) If z = x + iy, the complex
conjugate of z is the complex number deﬁned by z = x −iy. Geometrically,
the complex conjugate of z is obtained by reﬂecting z in the real axis (see
Figure 5.2).
The following properties of the complex conjugate are easy to verify:

7. z is real if and only if z = z;

denoted by Re z and Im z, we have

9. If z = x + iy, then zz = x2 + y2.
THEOREM 5.4.1 If f(z) is a polynomial with real coeﬃcients, then its
non–real roots occur in complex–conjugate pairs, i.e.
if f(z) = 0, then
f(z) = 0.
Proof.
Suppose f(z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0 = 0, where
an, . . . , a0 are real. Then
0 = 0 = f(z)
=
anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0
=
an zn + an−1 zn−1 + · · · + a1 z + a0
=

CHAPTER 5. COMPLEX NUMBERS
EXAMPLE 5.4.1 Discuss the position of the roots of the equation
z4 = −1
in the complex plane.
Solution. The equation z4 = −1 has real coeﬃcients and so its roots come
in complex conjugate pairs. Also if z is a root, so is −z. Also there are
clearly no real roots and no imaginary roots. So there must be one root w
in the ﬁrst quadrant, with all remaining roots being given by w, −w and
−w. In fact, as we shall soon see, the roots lie evenly spaced on the unit
circle.
The following theorem is useful in deciding if a polynomial f(z) has a
multiple root a; that is if (z −a)m divides f(z) for some m ≥2. (The proof
is left as an exercise.)
THEOREM 5.4.2 If f(z) = (z −a)mg(z), where m ≥2 and g(z) is a
polynomial, then f ′(a) = 0 and the polynomial and its derivative have a
common root.
From theorem 5.4.1 we obtain a result which is very useful in the explicit
integration of rational functions (i.e. ratios of polynomials) with real coeﬃ-
cients.
THEOREM 5.4.3 If f(z) is a non–constant polynomial with real coeﬃ-
cients, then f(z) can be factorized as a product of real linear factors and
real quadratic factors.
Proof. In general f(z) will have r real roots z1, . . . , zr and 2s non–real
roots zr+1, zr+1, . . . , zr+s, zr+s, occurring in complex–conjugate pairs by
theorem 5.4.1. Then if an is the coeﬃcient of highest degree in f(z), we
have the factorization
f(z)
=
an(z −z1) · · · (z −zr) ×
×(z −zr+1)(z −zr+1) · · · (z −zr+s)(z −zr+s).
We then use the following identity for j = r + 1, . . . , r + s which in turn
shows that paired terms give rise to real quadratic factors:
(z −zj)(z −zj)
=
z2 −(zj + zj)z + zjzj
=
z2 −2Re zj + (x2
j + y2
j ),
where zj = xj + iyj.
A well–known example of such a factorization is the following:

EXAMPLE 5.4.2 Find a factorization of z4+1 into real linear and quadratic
factors.
Solution. Clearly there are no real roots. Also we have the preliminary
factorization z4 + 1 = (z2 −i)(z2 + i). Now the roots of z2 −i are easily
veriﬁed to be ±(1 + i)/
√
2, so the roots of z2 + i must be ±(1 −i)/
√
2.
In other words the roots are w = (1 + i)/
√
2 and w, −w, −w. Grouping
conjugate–complex terms gives the factorization

(z −w)(z −w)(z + w)(z + w)

Modulus of a complex number
DEFINITION 5.5.1 (Modulus) If z = x + iy, the modulus of z is the
non–negative real number |z| deﬁned by |z| =
p
x2 + y2. Geometrically, the
modulus of z is the distance from z to 0 (see Figure 5.3).
More generally, |z1−z2| is the distance between z1 and z2 in the complex
plane. For
|z1 −z2| = |(x1 + iy1) −(x2 + iy2)|
=
|(x1 −x2) + i(y1 −y2)|
=
p
(x1 −x2)2 + (y1 −y2)2.
The following properties of the modulus are easy to verify, using the identity
|z|2 = zz:

|z1z2| = |z1||z2|;

where a and b are distinct complex numbers and λ is a positive real number,
λ ̸= 1. (If λ = 1, the above equation represents the perpendicular bisector

The last equation represents a circle centre z0, radius r, where

|1 −λ2|.
There are two special points on the circle of Apollonius, the points z1 and
z2 deﬁned by

and
z2 −a
z2 −b = −λ,
or
z1 = a −λb
1 −λ
and
z2 = a + λb

(5.3)
It is easy to verify that z1 and z2 are distinct points on the line through a
and b and that z0 = z1+z2
2
. Hence the circle of Apollonius is the circle based
on the segment z1, z2 as diameter.
EXAMPLE 5.5.2 Find the centre and radius of the circle
|z −1 −i| = 2|z −5 −2i|.
Solution. Method 1. Proceed algebraically and simplify the equation
|x + iy −1 −i| = 2|x + iy −5 −2i|
or
|x −1 + i(y −1)| = 2|x −5 + i(y −2)|.
Squaring both sides gives
(x −1)2 + (y −1)2 = 4((x −5)2 + (y −2)2),
which reduces to the circle equation
x2 + y2 −38

Argument of a complex number
Let z = x + iy be a non–zero complex number, r = |z| =
p
x2 + y2. Then
we have x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, where θ is the angle made by z with the
positive x–axis. So θ is unique up to addition of a multiple of 2π radians.
DEFINITION 5.6.1 (Argument) Any number θ satisfying the above
pair of equations is called an argument of z and is denoted by arg z. The
particular argument of z lying in the range −π < θ ≤π is called the principal
argument of z and is denoted by Arg z (see Figure 5.5).
We have z = r cos θ + ir sin θ = r(cos θ + i sin θ) and this representation
of z is called the polar representation or modulus–argument form of z.
EXAMPLE 5.6.1 Arg 1 = 0, Arg (−1) = π, Arg i = π
2 , Arg (−i) = −π
2 .
We note that y/x = tan θ if x ̸= 0, so θ is determined by this equation up
to a multiple of π. In fact
Arg z = tan−1 y
x + kπ,

where k = 0 if x > 0; k = 1 if x < 0, y > 0; k = −1 if x < 0, y < 0.
To determine Arg z graphically, it is simplest to draw the triangle formed
by the points 0, x, z on the complex plane, mark in the positive acute angle
α between the rays 0, x and 0, z and determine Arg z geometrically, using
the fact that α = tan−1(|y|/|x|), as in the following examples:
EXAMPLE 5.6.2 Determine the principal argument of z for the followig
complex numbers:
z = 4 + 3i, −4 + 3i, −4 −3i, 4 −3i.
Solution. Referring to Figure 5.6, we see that Arg z has the values
α, π −α, −π + α, −α,
where α = tan−1 3
4.
An important property of the argument of a complex number states that
the sum of the arguments of two non–zero complex numbers is an argument
of their product:
THEOREM 5.6.1 If θ1 and θ2 are arguments of z1 and z2, then θ1 + θ2
is an argument of z1z2.
Proof. Let z1 and z2 have polar representations z1 = r1(cos θ1 + i sin θ1)
and z2 = r2(cos θ2 + i sin θ2). Then
z1z2
=
r1(cos θ1 + i sin θ1)r2(cos θ2 + i sin θ2)
=
r1r2(cos θ1 cos θ2 −sin θ1 sin θ2 + i(cos θ1 sin θ2 + sin θ1 cos θ2))
=
r1r2(cos (θ1 + θ2) + i sin (θ1 + θ2)),

which is the polar representation of z1z2, as r1r2 = |z1||z2| = |z1z2|. Hence
θ1 + θ2 is an argument of z1z2.
An easy induction gives the following generalization to a product of n
complex numbers:
COROLLARY 5.6.1 If θ1, . . . , θn are arguments for z1, . . . , zn respectively,
then θ1 + · · · + θn is an argument for z1 · · · zn.
Taking θ1 = · · · = θn = θ in the previous corollary gives
COROLLARY 5.6.2 If θ is an argument of z, then nθ is an argument for
zn.
THEOREM 5.6.2 If θ is an argument of the non–zero complex number
z, then −θ is an argument of z−1.
Proof. Let θ be an argument of z. Then z = r(cos θ+i sin θ), where r = |z|.
Hence
z−1
=
r−1(cos θ + i sin θ)−1
=
r−1(cos θ −i sin θ)
=
r−1(cos(−θ) + i sin(−θ)).

CHAPTER 5. COMPLEX NUMBERS
Now r−1 = |z|−1 = |z−1|, so −θ is an argument of z−1.
COROLLARY 5.6.3 If θ1 and θ2 are arguments of z1 and z2, then θ1 −θ2
is an argument of z1/z2.
In terms of principal arguments, we have the following equations:
(i)
Arg (z1z2)

Proof. First we observe that
e2kπi = cos (2kπ) + i sin (2kπ) = 1.
Conversely, suppose ez = 1, z = x + iy. Then ex(cos y + i sin y) = 1. Hence
ex cos y = 1 and ex sin y = 0. Hence sin y = 0 and so y = nπ, n ∈Z. Then
ex cos (nπ) = 1, so ex(−1)n = 1, from which follows (−1)n = 1 as ex > 0.
Hence n = 2k, k ∈Z and ex = 1. Hence x = 0 and z = 2kπi.

De Moivre’s theorem
The next theorem has many uses and is a special case of theorem 5.6.3(ii).
Alternatively it can be proved directly by induction on n.
THEOREM 5.7.1 (De Moivre) If n is a positive integer, then
(cos θ + i sin θ)n = cos nθ + i sin nθ.
As a ﬁrst application, we consider the equation zn = 1.
THEOREM 5.7.2 The equation zn = 1 has n distinct solutions, namely
the complex numbers ζk = e
2kπi
n , k = 0, 1, . . . , n −1.
These lie equally
spaced on the unit circle |z| = 1 and are obtained by starting at 1, moving
round the circle anti–clockwise, incrementing the argument in steps of 2π
n .
(See Figure 5.7)
We notice that the roots are the powers of the special root ζ = e
2πi
n .

Consequently these numbers must be precisely all the roots of zn −1. For
the polynomial zn −1, being of degree n over a ﬁeld, can have at most n
distinct roots in that ﬁeld.
The more general equation zn = a, where a ∈, C, a ̸= 0, can be reduced
to the previous case:
Let α be argument of z, so that a = |a|eiα. Then if w = |a|1/ne

Motivation
We motivate the chapter on eigenvalues by discussing the equation
ax2 + 2hxy + by2 = c,
where not all of a, h, b are zero. The expression ax2 + 2hxy + by2 is called
a quadratic form in x and y and we have the identity
ax2 + 2hxy + by2 =

and A =

¸
. A is called the matrix of the quadratic
form.
We now rotate the x, y axes anticlockwise through θ radians to new
x1, y1 axes. The equations describing the rotation of axes are derived as
follows:
Let P have coordinates (x, y) relative to the x, y axes and coordinates
(x1, y1) relative to the x1, y1 axes. Then referring to Figure 6.1:

x1 cos θ −y1 sin θ.
Similarly y = x1 sin θ + y1 cos θ.
We can combine these transformation equations into the single matrix
equation:

and P =

.
We note that the columns of P give the directions of the positive x1 and y1
axes. Also P is an orthogonal matrix – we have PP t = I2 and so P −1 = P t.
The matrix P has the special property that det P = 1.
A matrix of the type P =
· cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ
¸
is called a rotation matrix.
We shall show soon that any 2 × 2 real orthogonal matrix with determinant

equal to 1 is a rotation matrix.
We can also solve for the new coordinates in terms of the old ones:
· x1

¸

,
so x1 = x cos θ + y sin θ and y1 = −x sin θ + y cos θ. Then
XtAX = (PY )tA(PY ) = Y t(P tAP)Y.
Now suppose, as we later show, that it is possible to choose an angle θ so
that P tAP is a diagonal matrix, say diag(λ1, λ2). Then
XtAX =

(6.1)
and relative to the new axes, the equation ax2 + 2hxy + by2 = c becomes
λ1x2
1 + λ2y2
1 = c, which is quite easy to sketch. This curve is symmetrical
about the x1 and y1 axes, with P1 and P2, the respective columns of P,
giving the directions of the axes of symmetry.
Also it can be veriﬁed that P1 and P2 satisfy the equations
AP1 = λ1P1 and AP2 = λ2P2.
These equations force a restriction on λ1 and λ2. For if P1 =
· u1
v1
¸
, the
ﬁrst equation becomes
· a
h

¸ · u1

or
· a −λ1

=

.
Hence we are dealing with a homogeneous system of two linear equations in
two unknowns, having a non–trivial solution (u1, v1). Hence
¯¯¯¯
a −λ1
h
h
b −λ1
¯¯¯¯ = 0.
Similarly, λ2 satisﬁes the same equation.
In expanded form, λ1 and λ2
satisfy
λ2 −(a + b)λ + ab −h2 = 0.
This equation has real roots
λ = a + b ±
p
(a + b)2 −4(ab −h2)

(a −b)2 + 4h2

(6.2)
(The roots are distinct if a ̸= b or h ̸= 0. The case a = b and h = 0 needs
no investigation, as it gives an equation of a circle.)
The equation λ2 −(a+b)λ+ab−h2 = 0 is called the eigenvalue equation
of the matrix A.

Deﬁnitions and examples
DEFINITION 6.2.1 (Eigenvalue, eigenvector)
Let A be a complex square matrix. Then if λ is a complex number and
X a non–zero complex column vector satisfying AX = λX, we call X an
eigenvector of A, while λ is called an eigenvalue of A. We also say that X
is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ.
So in the above example P1 and P2 are eigenvectors corresponding to λ1
and λ2, respectively.
We shall give an algorithm which starts from the
eigenvalues of A =
· a
h
h
b
¸
and constructs a rotation matrix P such that
P tAP is diagonal.
As noted above, if λ is an eigenvalue of an n × n matrix A, with
corresponding eigenvector X, then (A −λIn)X = 0, with X ̸= 0, so
det (A −λIn) = 0 and there are at most n distinct eigenvalues of A.
Conversely if det (A −λIn) = 0, then (A −λIn)X = 0 has a non–trivial
solution X and so λ is an eigenvalue of A with X a corresponding eigenvector.
DEFINITION 6.2.2 (Characteristic equation, polynomial)
The equation det (A −λIn) = 0 is called the characteristic equation of A,
while the polynomial det (A −λIn) is called the characteristic polynomial of
A. The characteristic polynomial of A is often denoted by chA(λ).
Hence the eigenvalues of A are the roots of the characteristic polynomial
of A.
For a 2 × 2 matrix A =
· a
b
c
d
¸
, it is easily veriﬁed that the character-
istic polynomial is λ2 −(trace A)λ + det A, where trace A = a + d is the sum
of the diagonal elements of A.
EXAMPLE 6.2.1 Find the eigenvalues of A =
· 2

and ﬁnd all eigen-
vectors.
Solution. The characteristic equation of A is λ2 −4λ + 3 = 0, or
(λ −1)(λ −3) = 0.
Hence λ = 1 or 3. The eigenvector equation (A −λIn)X = 0 reduces to

Taking λ = 1 gives
x + y

x + y

0,
which has solution x = −y, y arbitrary.
Consequently the eigenvectors
corresponding to λ = 1 are the vectors
· −y

, with y ̸= 0.
Taking λ = 3 gives
−x + y

x −y
=
0,
which has solution x = y, y arbitrary. Consequently the eigenvectors corre-
sponding to λ = 3 are the vectors
· y

¸
, with y ̸= 0.
Our next result has wide applicability:
THEOREM 6.2.1 Let A be a 2 × 2 matrix having distinct eigenvalues λ1
and λ2 and corresponding eigenvectors X1 and X2. Let P be the matrix
whose columns are X1 and X2, respectively. Then P is non–singular and
P −1AP =
· λ1
0
0
λ2
¸
.
Proof. Suppose AX1 = λ1X1 and AX2 = λ2X2. We show that the system
of homogeneous equations
xX1 + yX2 = 0
has only the trivial solution.
Then by theorem 2.5.10 the matrix P =
[X1|X2] is non–singular. So assume
xX1 + yX2 = 0.
(6.3)
Then A(xX1 + yX2) = A0 = 0, so x(AX1) + y(AX2) = 0. Hence
xλ1X1 + yλ2X2 = 0.
(6.4)

120
CHAPTER 6. EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS
Multiplying equation 6.3 by λ1 and subtracting from equation 6.4 gives
(λ2 −λ1)yX2 = 0.
Hence y = 0, as (λ2−λ1) ̸= 0 and X2 ̸= 0. Then from equation 6.3, xX1 = 0
and hence x = 0.
Then the equations AX1 = λ1X1 and AX2 = λ2X2 give
AP = A[X1|X2] = [AX1|AX2]

There are two immediate applications of theorem 6.2.1. The ﬁrst is to the
calculation of An: If P −1AP = diag (λ1, λ2), then A = Pdiag (λ1, λ2)P −1

is a matrix of real or complex numbers and x and y

and ˙X =

6.2. DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES
121
We make the substitution X = PY , where Y =

. Then x1 and y1
are also functions of t and
˙X = P ˙Y = AX = A(PY ), so ˙Y = (P −1AP)Y =
· λ1

λ2
¸
Y.
Hence ˙x1 = λ1x1 and ˙y1 = λ2y1.
These diﬀerential equations are well–known to have the solutions x1 =
x1(0)eλ1t and y1 = y1(0)eλ2t, where x1(0) is the value of x1 when t = 0.
[If dx

However

, so this determines x1(0) and y1(0) in
terms of x(0) and y(0). Hence ultimately x and y are determined as explicit
functions of t, using the equation X = PY .

To solve the diﬀerential equation system, make the substitution X =
PY . Then x = x1 + 3y1, y = x1 + 4y1. The system then becomes
˙x1
=
−x1
˙y1

so x1 = x1(0)e−t, y1 = y1(0)e−2t. Now

,
so x1 = −11e−t and y1 = 6e−2t. Hence x = −11e−t + 3(6e−2t) = −11e−t +
18e−2t, y = −11e−t + 4(6e−2t) = −11e−t + 24e−2t.
For a more complicated example we solve a system of inhomogeneous
recurrence relations.
EXAMPLE 6.2.4 Solve the system of recurrence relations
xn+1

2xn −yn −1
yn+1

−xn + 2yn + 2,

Xn+1 = AXn + B,
where
A =

It is then an easy induction to prove that
Xn = AnX0 + (An−1 + · · · + A + I2)B.

REMARK 6.2.1 If (A −I2)−1 existed (that is, if det (A −I2) ̸= 0, or
equivalently, if 1 is not an eigenvalue of A), then we could have used the
formula
An−1 + · · · + A + I2 = (An −I2)(A −I2)−1.
(6.6)
However the eigenvalues of A are 1 and 3 in the above problem, so formula 6.6
cannot be used there.
Our discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors has been limited to 2 × 2
matrices. The discussion is more complicated for matrices of size greater
than two and is best left to a second course in linear algebra. Nevertheless
the following result is a useful generalization of theorem 6.2.1. The reader
is referred to [28, page 350] for a proof.

Chapter 7
Identifying second degree
equations
7.1
The eigenvalue method
In this section we apply eigenvalue methods to determine the geometrical
nature of the second degree equation
ax2 + 2hxy + by2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0,
(7.1)
where not all of a, h, b are zero.
Let A =
· a
h
h
b
¸
be the matrix of the quadratic form ax2 +2hxy +by2.
We saw in section 6.1, equation 6.2 that A has real eigenvalues λ1 and λ2,
given by
λ1 = a + b −
p
(a −b)2 + 4h2
2
, λ2 = a + b +
p
(a −b)2 + 4h2
2
.
We show that it is always possible to rotate the x, y axes to x1, x2 axes whose
positive directions are determined by eigenvectors X1 and X2 corresponding
to λ1and λ2 in such a way that relative to the x1, y1 axes, equation 7.1 takes
the form
a′x2 + b′y2 + 2g′x + 2f ′y + c = 0.
(7.2)
Then by completing the square and suitably translating the x1, y1 axes,
to new x2, y2 axes, equation 7.2 can be reduced to one of several standard
forms, each of which is easy to sketch. We need some preliminary deﬁnitions.

CHAPTER 7. IDENTIFYING SECOND DEGREE EQUATIONS
DEFINITION 7.1.1 (Orthogonal matrix) An n × n real matrix P is
called orthogonal if
P tP = In.
It follows that if P is orthogonal, then det P = ±1. For
det (P tP) = det P t det P = ( det P)2,
so (det P)2 = det In = 1. Hence det P = ±1.
If P is an orthogonal matrix with det P = 1, then P is called a proper
orthogonal matrix.
THEOREM 7.1.1 If P is a 2 × 2 orthogonal matrix with det P = 1, then
P =
· cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ
¸
for some θ.
REMARK 7.1.1 Hence, by the discusssion at the beginning of Chapter
6, if P is a proper orthogonal matrix, the coordinate transformation
· x
y
¸
= P
· x1
y1
¸
represents a rotation of the axes, with new x1 and y1 axes given by the
repective columns of P.
Proof. Suppose that P tP = I2, where ∆= det P = 1. Let
P =
· a
b
c
d
¸
.
Then the equation
P t = P −1 = 1
∆adj P
gives
· a

d
¸
=
·

−b
−c
a
¸
Hence a = d, b = −c and so
P =
· a
−c
c
a
¸
,
where a2 + c2 = 1.
But then the point (a, c) lies on the unit circle, so
a = cos θ and c = sin θ, where θ is uniquely determined up to multiples of
2π.

7.1. THE EIGENVALUE METHOD
131
DEFINITION 7.1.2 (Dot product). If X =
· a
b
¸
and Y =
· c
d
¸
, then
X · Y , the dot product of X and Y , is deﬁned by
X · Y = ac + bd.
The dot product has the following properties:
(i) X · (Y + Z) = X · Y + X · Z;
(ii) X · Y = Y · X;
(iii) (tX) · Y = t(X · Y );
(iv) X · X = a2 + b2 if X =
· a
b
¸
;
(v) X · Y = XtY .
The length of X is deﬁned by
||X|| =
p
a2 + b2 = (X · X)1/2.
We see that ||X|| is the distance between the origin O = (0, 0) and the point
(a, b).
THEOREM 7.1.2 (Geometrical interpretation of the dot product)
Let A = (x1, y1) and B = (x2, y2) be points, each distinct from the origin
O = (0, 0). Then if X =
· x1
y1
¸
and Y =
· x2
y2
¸
, we have
X · Y = OA · OB cos θ,
where θ is the angle between the rays OA and OB.
Proof. By the cosine law applied to triangle OAB, we have
AB2 = OA2 + OB2 −2OA · OB cos θ.
(7.3)
Now AB2 = (x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2, OA2 = x2
1 + y2
1, OB2 = x2
2 + y2
2.
Substituting in equation 7.3 then gives
(x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2 = (x2
1 + y2
1) + (x2
2 + y2
2) −2OA · OB cos θ,

132
CHAPTER 7. IDENTIFYING SECOND DEGREE EQUATIONS
which simpliﬁes to give
OA · OB cos θ = x1x2 + y1y2 = X · Y.
It follows from theorem 7.1.2 that if A = (x1, y1) and B = (x2, y2) are
points distinct from O = (0, 0) and X =
· x1
y1
¸
and Y =
· x2
y2
¸
, then
X · Y = 0 means that the rays OA and OB are perpendicular. This is the
reason for the following deﬁnition:
DEFINITION 7.1.3 (Orthogonal vectors) Vectors X and Y are called
orthogonal if
X · Y = 0.
There is also a connection with orthogonal matrices:
THEOREM 7.1.3 Let P be a 2 × 2 real matrix. Then P is an orthogonal
matrix if and only if the columns of P are orthogonal and have unit length.
Proof. P is orthogonal if and only if P tP = I2. Now if P = [X1|X2], the
matrix P tP is an important matrix called the Gram matrix of the column
vectors X1 and X2. It is easy to prove that
P tP = [Xi · Xj] =
· X1 · X1
X1 · X2
X2 · X1
X2 · X2
¸
.
Hence the equation P tP = I2 is equivalent to
· X1 · X1
X1 · X2
X2 · X1
X2 · X2
¸
=
· 1
0
0
1
¸
,
or, equating corresponding elements of both sides:
X1 · X1 = 1, X1 · X2 = 0, X2 · X2 = 1,
which says that the columns of P are orthogonal and of unit length.
The next theorem describes a fundamental property of real symmetric
matrices and the proof generalizes to symmetric matrices of any size.
THEOREM 7.1.4 If X1 and X2 are eigenvectors corresponding to distinct
eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 of a real symmetric matrix A, then X1 and X2 are
orthogonal vectors.

7.1. THE EIGENVALUE METHOD
133
Proof. Suppose
AX1 = λ1X1, AX2 = λ2X2,
(7.4)
where X1 and X2 are non–zero column vectors, At = A and λ1 ̸= λ2.
We have to prove that Xt
1X2 = 0. From equation 7.4,
Xt
2AX1 = λ1Xt
2X1
(7.5)
and
Xt
1AX2 = λ2Xt
1X2.
(7.6)
From equation 7.5, taking transposes,
(Xt
2AX1)t = (λ1Xt
2X1)t
so
Xt
1AtX2 = λ1Xt
1X2.
Hence
Xt
1AX2 = λ1Xt
1X2.
(7.7)
Finally, subtracting equation 7.6 from equation 7.7, we have
(λ1 −λ2)Xt
1X2 = 0
and hence, since λ1 ̸= λ2,
Xt
1X2 = 0.
THEOREM 7.1.5 Let A be a real 2 × 2 symmetric matrix with distinct
eigenvalues λ1 and λ2. Then a proper orthogonal 2×2 matrix P exists such
that
P tAP = diag (λ1, λ2).
Also the rotation of axes
· x

· x1
y1
¸
“diagonalizes” the quadratic form corresponding to A:
XtAX = λ1x2
1 + λ2y2
1.

134
CHAPTER 7. IDENTIFYING SECOND DEGREE EQUATIONS
Proof. Let X1 and X2 be eigenvectors corresponding to λ1 and λ2. Then
by theorem 7.1.4, X1 and X2 are orthogonal. By dividing X1 and X2 by
their lengths (i.e. normalizing X1 and X2) if necessary, we can assume that
X1 and X2 have unit length. Then by theorem 7.1.1, P = [X1|X2] is an
orthogonal matrix. By replacing X1 by −X1, if necessary, we can assume
that det P = 1. Then by theorem 6.2.1, we have
P tAP = P −1AP =
· λ1
0

Also under the rotation X = PY ,

EXAMPLE 7.1.1 Let A be the symmetric matrix
A =

.
Find a proper orthogonal matrix P such that P tAP is diagonal.
Solution. The characteristic equation of A is λ2 −19λ + 48 = 0, or
(λ −16)(λ −3) = 0.
Hence A has distinct eigenvalues λ1 = 16 and λ2 = 3. We ﬁnd corresponding
eigenvectors
X1 =
· −3

¸
and X2 =
· 2

Now ||X1|| = ||X2|| =

Then if P = [X1|X2], the proof of theorem 7.1.5 shows that
P tAP =

However det P = −1, so replacing X1 by −X1 will give det P = 1.

We now apply the above ideas to determine the geometric nature of

will rotate the x, y axes to positions given by the respective columns of P.
(More generally, we can always arrange for the x1 axis to point either into
the ﬁrst or fourth quadrant.)
Now A =

so we have, by Theorem 7.1.5
12x2 −12xy + 7y2 = 16x2

symmetry lie along the x2, y2 axes. In terms of the original x, y coordinates,
we ﬁnd that the centre is (x, y) = (−2, 1). Also Y = P tX, so equations 7.8

A classiﬁcation algorithm
There are several possible degenerate cases that can arise from the general
second degree equation. For example x2 +y2 = 0 represents the point (0, 0);
x2 + y2 = −1 deﬁnes the empty set, as does x2 = −1 or y2 = −1; x2 = 0
deﬁnes the line x = 0; (x + y)2 = 0 deﬁnes the line x + y = 0; x2 −y2 = 0
deﬁnes the lines x −y = 0, x + y = 0; x2 = 1 deﬁnes the parallel lines
x = ±1; (x + y)2 = 1 likewise deﬁnes two parallel lines x + y = ±1.
We state without proof a complete classiﬁcation 1 of the various cases

the diagrams in this chapter. I am grateful to Peter Adams for his programming assistance.

Then equating the coeﬃcients of x1 and y1 to 0 gives the same equation
2α + 2β + 2 = 0.
Take α = 0, β = −1. Then equation 7.17 simpliﬁes to
x2

THREE–DIMENSIONAL
GEOMETRY

Introduction
In this chapter we present a vector–algebra approach to three–dimensional
geometry. The aim is to present standard properties of lines and planes,
with minimum use of complicated three–dimensional diagrams such as those
involving similar triangles. We summarize the chapter:
Points are deﬁned as ordered triples of real numbers and the distance
between points P1 = (x1, y1, z1) and P2 = (x2, y2, z2) is deﬁned by the
formula
P1P2 =
p
(x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2 + (z2 −z1)2.
Directed line segments
-
AB are introduced as three–dimensional column
vectors: If A = (x1, y1, z1) and B = (x2, y2, z2), then
-
AB=


x2 −x1
y2 −y1
z2 −z1

.
If P is a point, we let P =
-
OP and call P the position vector of P.
With suitable deﬁnitions of lines, parallel lines, there are important ge-
ometrical interpretations of equality, addition and scalar multiplication of
vectors.
(i) Equality of vectors: Suppose A, B, C, D are distinct points such that
no three are collinear. Then
-
AB=
-
CD if and only if
-
AB ∥
-
CD and
-
AC ∥
-
BD (See Figure 8.1.)

where D is the point such that

distinct points. Then P is on the line AB,
AP
AB = |t|
and
(a) P = A if t = 0, P = B if t = 1;
(b) P is between A and B if 0 < t < 1;
(c) B is between A and P if 1 < t;
(d) A is between P and B if t < 0.
(See Figure 8.2.)

by
X · Y = a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2.
The length ||X|| of a vector X is deﬁned by
||X|| = (X · X)1/2
and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality holds:
|X · Y | ≤||X|| · ||Y ||.
The triangle inequality for vector length now follows as a simple deduction:
||X + Y || ≤||X|| + ||Y ||.
Using the equation
AB = ||
-
AB ||,
we deduce the corresponding familiar triangle inequality for distance:
AB ≤AC + CB.

152
CHAPTER 8. THREE–DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY
The angle θ between two non–zero vectors X and Y is then deﬁned by
cos θ =
X · Y
||X|| · ||Y ||,
0 ≤θ ≤π.
This deﬁnition makes sense. For by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,
−1 ≤
X · Y
||X|| · ||Y || ≤1.
Vectors X and Y are said to be perpendicular or orthogonal if X ·Y = 0.
Vectors of unit length are called unit vectors. The vectors
i =

j =

are unit vectors and every vector is a linear combination of i, j and k:


a
b
c

= ai + bj + ck.
Non–zero vectors X and Y are parallel or proportional if the angle be-
tween X and Y equals 0 or π; equivalently if X = tY for some real number
t. Vectors X and Y are then said to have the same or opposite direction,
according as t > 0 or t < 0.
We are then led to study straight lines. If A and B are distinct points,
it is easy to show that AP + PB = AB holds if and only if
-
AP = t
-
AB, where 0 ≤t ≤1.
A line is deﬁned as a set consisting of all points P satisfying
P = P0 + tX,
t ∈R
or equivalently
-
P0P= tX,
for some ﬁxed point P0 and ﬁxed non–zero vector X called a direction vector
for the line.
Equivalently, in terms of coordinates,
x = x0 + ta, y = y0 + tb, z = z0 + tc,
where P0 = (x0, y0, z0) and not all of a, b, c are zero.

8.1. INTRODUCTION
153
There is then one and only one line passing passing through two distinct
points A and B. It consists of the points P satisfying
-
AP = t
-
AB,
where t is a real number.
The cross–product X×Y provides us with a vector which is perpendicular
to both X and Y . It is deﬁned in terms of the components of X and Y :
Let X = a1i + b1j + c1k and Y = a2i + b2j + c2k. Then
X × Y = ai + bj + ck,
where
a =

b = −

The cross–product enables us to derive elegant formulae for the distance
from a point to a line, the area of a triangle and the distance between two
skew lines.
Finally we turn to the geometrical concept of a plane in three–dimensional
space.
A plane is a set of points P satisfying an equation of the form
P = P0 + sX + tY, s, t ∈R,
(8.1)
where X and Y are non–zero, non–parallel vectors.
In terms of coordinates, equation 8.1 takes the form
x
=
x0 + sa1 + ta2
y
=
y0 + sb1 + tb2
z
=
z0 + sc1 + tc2,
where P0 = (x0, y0, z0).
There is then one and only one plane passing passing through three
non–collinear points A, B, C. It consists of the points P satisfying
-
AP = s
-
AB +t
-
AC,
where s and t are real numbers.
The cross–product enables us to derive a concise equation for the plane
through three non–collinear points A, B, C, namely
-
AP ·(
-
AB ×
-
AC) = 0.

154
CHAPTER 8. THREE–DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY
When expanded, this equation has the form
ax + by + cz = d,
where ai + bj + ck is a non–zero vector which is perpendicular to
-
P1P2 for
all points P1, P2 lying in the plane. Any vector with this property is said to
be a normal to the plane.
It is then easy to prove that two planes with non–parallel normal vectors
must intersect in a line.
We conclude the chapter by deriving a formula for the distance from a
point to a plane.
8.2
Three–dimensional space
DEFINITION 8.2.1 Three–dimensional space is the set E3 of ordered
triples (x, y, z), where x, y, z are real numbers. The triple (x, y, z) is called
a point P in E3 and we write P = (x, y, z). The numbers x, y, z are called,
respectively, the x, y, z coordinates of P.
The coordinate axes are the sets of points:
{(x, 0, 0)}
(x–axis), {(0, y, 0)}
(y–axis), {(0, 0, z)}
(z–axis).
The only point common to all three axes is the origin O = (0, 0, 0).
The coordinate planes are the sets of points:
{(x, y, 0)}
(xy–plane), {(0, y, z)}
(yz–plane), {(x, 0, z)}
(xz–plane).
The positive octant consists of the points (x, y, z), where x > 0, y >
0, z > 0.
We think of the points (x, y, z) with z > 0 as lying above the xy–plane,
and those with z < 0 as lying beneath the xy–plane. A point P = (x, y, z)
will be represented as in Figure 8.3. The point illustrated lies in the positive
octant.
DEFINITION 8.2.2 The distance P1P2 between points P1 = (x1, y1, z1)
and P2 = (x2, y2, z2) is deﬁned by the formula
P1P2 =
p
(x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2 + (z2 −z1)2.
For example, if P = (x, y, z),
OP =
p
x2 + y2 + z2.

CHAPTER 8. THREE–DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY
DEFINITION 8.2.3 If A = (x1, y1, z1) and B = (x2, y2, z2) we deﬁne
the symbol
-
AB to be the column vector
-
AB=


x2 −x1
y2 −y1
z2 −z1

.
We let P =
-
OP and call P the position vector of P.
The components of
-
AB are the coordinates of B when the axes are
translated to A as origin of coordinates.
We think of
-
AB as being represented by the directed line segment from
A to B and think of it as an arrow whose tail is at A and whose head is at
B. (See Figure 8.4.)
Some mathematicians think of
-
AB as representing the translation of
space which takes A into B.
The following simple properties of
-
AB are easily veriﬁed and correspond
to how we intuitively think of directed line segments:
(i)
-
AB= 0 ⇔A = B;
(ii)
-
BA= −

(See Figure 8.7.)
It is easy to prove that
||tX|| = |t| · ||X||,
if t is a real number. Hence if X is a non–zero vector, the vectors
±

||X||X
are unit vectors.
A useful property of the length of a vector is
||X ± Y ||2 = ||X||2 ± 2X · Y + ||Y ||2.
(8.2)

8.3. DOT PRODUCT
159
The following important property of the dot product is widely used in
mathematics:
THEOREM 8.3.1 (The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality)
If X and Y are vectors in R3, then
|X · Y | ≤||X|| · ||Y ||.
(8.3)
Moreover if X ̸= 0 and Y ̸= 0, then
X · Y = ||X|| · ||Y ||
⇔
Y = tX, t > 0,
X · Y = −||X|| · ||Y ||
⇔
Y = tX, t < 0.
Proof. If X = 0, then inequality 8.3 is trivially true. So assume X ̸= 0.
Now if t is any real number, by equation 8.2,
0 ≤||tX −Y ||2
=
||tX||2 −2(tX) · Y + ||Y ||2
=
t2||X||2 −2(X · Y )t + ||Y ||2
=
at2 −2bt + c,
where a = ||X||2 > 0, b = X · Y, c = ||Y ||2.
Hence
a(t2 −2b
a t + c
a)
≥0
µ
t −b
a
¶2
+ ca −b2
a2
≥0
.
Substituting t = b/a in the last inequality then gives
ac −b2
a2
≥0,
so
|b| ≤√ac = √a√c
and hence inequality 8.3 follows.
To discuss equality in the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, assume X ̸= 0
and Y ̸= 0.
Then if X · Y = ||X|| · ||Y ||, we have for all t
||tX −Y ||2
=
t2||X||2 −2tX · Y + ||Y ||2
=
t2||X||2 −2t||X|| · ||Y || + ||Y ||2
=
||tX −Y ||2.

160
CHAPTER 8. THREE–DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY
Taking t = ||X||/||Y || then gives ||tX −Y ||2 = 0 and hence tX −Y = 0.
Hence Y = tX, where t > 0. The case X · Y = −||X|| · ||Y || is proved
similarly.
COROLLARY 8.3.1 (The triangle inequality for vectors)
If X and Y are vectors, then
||X + Y || ≤||X|| + ||Y ||.
(8.4)
Moreover if X ̸= 0 and Y ̸= 0, then equality occurs in inequality 8.4 if and
only if Y = tX, where t > 0.
Proof.
||X + Y ||2
=
||X||2 + 2X · Y + ||Y ||2
≤
||X||2 + 2||X|| · ||Y || + ||Y ||2
=
(||X|| + ||Y ||)2
and inequality 8.4 follows.
If ||X + Y || = ||X|| + ||Y ||, then the above proof shows that
X · Y = ||X|| · ||Y ||.
Hence if X ̸= 0 and Y ̸= 0, the ﬁrst case of equality in the Cauchy–Schwarz
inequality shows that Y = tX with t > 0.
The triangle inequality for vectors gives rise to a corresponding inequality
for the distance function:
THEOREM 8.3.2 (The triangle inequality for distance)
If A, B, C are points, then
AC ≤AB + BC.
(8.5)
Moreover if B ̸= A and B ̸= C, then equality occurs in inequality 8.5 if and
only if
-
AB= r
-
AC, where 0 < r < 1.
Proof.
AC = ||
-
AC ||
=
||
-
AB +
-
BC ||
≤
||
-
AB || + ||
-
BC ||
=
AB + BC.

8.4. LINES
161
Moreover if equality occurs in inequality 8.5 and B ̸= A and B ̸= C, then
X =
-
AB̸= 0 and Y =
-
BC̸= 0 and the equation AC = AB + BC becomes
||X + Y || = ||X|| + ||Y ||. Hence the case of equality in the vector triangle
inequality gives
Y =
-
BC= tX = t
-
AB, where t > 0.
Then
-
BC
=
-
AC −
-
AB= t
-
AB
-
AC

(1 + t)
-
AB
-
AB

-
AC,
where r = 1/(t + 1) satisﬁes 0 < r < 1.
8.4
Lines
DEFINITION 8.4.1 A line in E3 is the set L(P0, X) consisting of all
points P satisfying
P = P0 + tX,
t ∈R
or equivalently
-
P0P= tX,
(8.6)
for some ﬁxed point P0 and ﬁxed non–zero vector X. (See Figure 8.8.)
Equivalently, in terms of coordinates, equation 8.6 becomes
x = x0 + ta, y = y0 + tb, z = z0 + tc,
where not all of a, b, c are zero.
The following familiar property of straight lines is easily veriﬁed.
THEOREM 8.4.1 If A and B are distinct points, there is one and only
one line containing A and B, namely L(A,
-
AB) or more explicitly the line
deﬁned by
-
AP = t
-
AB, or equivalently, in terms of position vectors:
P = (1 −t)A + tB
or
P = A + t
-
AB .
(8.7)
Equations 8.7 may be expressed in terms of coordinates: if A = (x1, y1, z1)
and B = (x2, y2, z2), then
x = (1 −t)x1 + tx2, y = (1 −t)y1 + ty2, z = (1 −t)z1 + tz2.

There is an important geometric signiﬁcance in the number t of the above
equation of the line through A and B. The proof is left as an exercise:
THEOREM 8.4.2 (Joachimsthal’s ratio formulae)
If t is the parameter occurring in theorem 8.4.1, then
(i)
|t| = AP
AB ;
(ii)
¯¯¯¯
t
1 −t
¯¯¯¯ = AP
PB
if P ̸= B.
Also
(iii) P is between A and B if 0 < t < 1;
(iv) B is between A and P if 1 < t;
(v) A is between P and B if t < 0.
(See Figure 8.9.)
For example, t = 1
2 gives the mid–point P of the segment AB:
P = 1
2(A + B).
EXAMPLE 8.4.1 L is the line AB, where A = (−4, 3, 1), B = (1, 1, 0);
M is the line CD, where C = (2, 0, 2), D = (−1, 3, −2); N is the line EF,
where E = (1, 4, 7), F = (−4, −3, −13). Find which pairs of lines intersect
and also the points of intersection.
Solution. In fact only L and N intersect, in the point (−2
3, 5
3, 1
3). For
example, to determine if L and N meet, we start with vector equations for
L and N:
P = A + t
-
AB,
Q = E + s
-
EF,
equate P and Q and solve for s and t:
(−4i + 3j + k) + t(5i −2j −k) = (i + 4j + 7k) + s(−5i −7j −20k),
which on simplifying, gives
5t + 5s
=
5
−2t + 7s
=
1
−t + 20s
=
6
This system has the unique solution t = 2
3, s = 1
3 and this determines a
corresponding point P where the lines meet, namely P = (−2
3, 5
3, 1
3).
The same method yields inconsistent systems when applied to the other
pairs of lines.

164
CHAPTER 8. THREE–DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY
EXAMPLE 8.4.2 If A = (5, 0, 7) and B = (2, −3, 6), ﬁnd the points P
on the line AB which satisfy AP/PB = 3.
Solution. Use the formulae
P = A + t
-
AB
and
¯¯¯¯
t
1 −t
¯¯¯¯ = AP
PB = 3.
Then
t
1 −t = 3 or −3,
so t = 3
4 or t = 3
2. The corresponding points are ( 11
4 , 9
4, 25
4 ) and ( 1
2, 9
2, 11
2 ).
DEFINITION 8.4.2 Let X and Y be non–zero vectors. Then X is parallel
or proportional to Y if X = tY for some t ∈R. We write X∥Y if X is parallel
to Y . If X = tY , we say that X and Y have the same or opposite direction,
according as t > 0 or t < 0.
DEFINITION 8.4.3 if A and B are distinct points on a line L, the non–
zero vector
-
AB is called a direction vector for L.
It is easy to prove that any two direction vectors for a line are parallel.
DEFINITION 8.4.4 Let L and M be lines having direction vectors X
and Y , respectively. Then L is parallel to M if X is parallel to Y . Clearly
any line is parallel to itself.
It is easy to prove that the line through a given point A and parallel to a
given line CD has an equation P = A + t
-
CD.
THEOREM 8.4.3 Let X = a1i + b1j + c1k and Y = a2i + b2j + c2k be
non–zero vectors. Then X is parallel to Y if and only if
¯¯¯¯
a1

¯¯¯¯ =
¯¯¯¯
b1
c1
b2
c2
¯¯¯¯ =
¯¯¯¯
a1
c1
a2
c2
¯¯¯¯ = 0.
(8.8)
Proof. The case of equality in the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality (theorem 8.3.1)
shows that X and Y are parallel if and only if
|X · Y | = ||X|| · ||Y ||.
Squaring gives the equivalent equality
(a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2)2 = (a2
1 + b2
1 + c2
1)(a2
2 + b2
2 + c2
2),

8.4. LINES
165
which simpliﬁes to
(a1b2 −a2b1)2 + (b1c2 −b2c1)2 + (a1c2 −a2c1)2 = 0,
which is equivalent to
a1b2 −a2b1 = 0, b1c2 −b2c1 = 0, a1c2 −a2c1 = 0,
which is equation 8.8.
Equality of geometrical vectors has a fundamental geometrical interpre-
tation:
THEOREM 8.4.4 Suppose A, B, C, D are distinct points such that no
three are collinear. Then
-
AB=
-
CD if and only if
-
AB ∥
-
CD and
-
AC ∥
-
BD
(See Figure 8.1.)
Proof. If
-
AB=
-
CD then
B −A
=
D −C,
C −A
=
D −B
and so
-
AC=
-
BD. Hence
-
AB ∥
-
CD and
-
AC ∥
-
BD.
Conversely, suppose that
-
AB ∥
-
CD and
-
AC ∥
-
BD. Then
-
AB= s
-
CD
and
-
AC= t
-
BD,
or
B −A = s(D −C)
and
C −A = tD −B.
We have to prove s = 1 or equivalently, t = 1.
Now subtracting the second equation above from the ﬁrst, gives
B −C = s(D −C) −t(D −B),
so
(1 −t)B = (1 −s)C + (s −t)D.
If t ̸= 1, then
B = 1 −s
1 −t C + s −t
1 −tD
and B would lie on the line CD. Hence t = 1.

The angle between two vectors
DEFINITION 8.5.1 Let X and Y be non–zero vectors. Then the angle
between X and Y is the unique value of θ deﬁned by
cos θ =
X · Y
||X|| · ||Y ||,
0 ≤θ ≤π.
REMARK 8.5.1 By Cauchy’s inequality, we have
−1 ≤
X · Y
||X|| · ||Y || ≤1,
so the above equation does deﬁne an angle θ.
In terms of components, if X = [a1, b1, c1]t and Y = [a2, b2, c2]t, then
cos θ =

(See Figure 8.10.)
Proof. Let A = (x1, y1, z1), B = (x2, y2, z2), C = (x3, y3, z3). Then
-

We also note that BC ≥AB and BC ≥AC follow from equation 8.11. (See
Figure 8.11.)

Solution.

AC= (4i −5j −10k) · (5i + 6j −k) = 20 −30 + 10 = 0.
Hence
-
AB and

clearly has to satisfy the equation

BD=

AC, or equivalently D −B =

Hence
D = B+
-
AC= (6i + 4j −2k) + (5i + 6j −k) = 11i + 10j −3k,
so D = (11, 10, −3).
THEOREM 8.5.2 (Distance from a point to a line) If C is a point
and L is the line through A and B, then there is exactly one point P on L
such that
-
CP is perpendicular to

AB, namely
P = A + t
-
AB,
t =

(8.12)
Moreover if Q is any point on L, then CQ ≥CP and hence P is the point
on L closest to C.

Inequality 8.14 then follows from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality 8.3.
DEFINITION 8.5.3 Two non–intersecting lines are called skew if they
have non–parallel direction vectors.
Theorem 8.5.3 has an application to the problem of showing that two skew
lines have a shortest distance between them.
(The reader is referred to
problem 16 at the end of the chapter.)
Before we turn to the study of planes, it is convenient to introduce the
cross–product of two vectors.
8.6
The cross–product of two vectors
DEFINITION 8.6.1 Let X = a1i + b1j + c1k and Y = a2i + b2j + c2k.
Then X × Y , the cross–product of X and Y , is deﬁned by
X × Y = ai + bj + ck,
where
a =

b = −
¯¯¯¯
a1

c2
¯¯¯¯ ,
c =

a2
b2
¯¯¯¯ .
The vector cross–product has the following properties which follow from
properties of 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 determinants:
(i) i × j = k,
j × k = i,
k × i = j;

8.6. THE CROSS–PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS
173
(ii) X × X = 0;
(iii) Y × X = −X × Y ;
(iv) X × (Y + Z) = X × Y + X × Z;
(v) (tX) × Y = t(X × Y );
(vi) (Scalar triple product formula) if Z = a3i + b3j + c3k, then
X · (Y × Z) =
¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯
= (X × Y ) · Z;
(vii) X · (X × Y ) = 0 = Y · (X × Y );
(viii) ||X × Y || =
p
||X||2||Y ||2 −(X · Y )2;
(ix) if X and Y are non–zero vectors and θ is the angle between X and Y ,
then
||X × Y || = ||X|| · ||Y || sin θ.
(See Figure 8.14.)
From theorem 8.4.3 and the deﬁnition of cross–product, it follows that
non–zero vectors X and Y are parallel if and only if X × Y = 0; hence by
(vii), the cross–product of two non–parallel, non–zero vectors X and Y , is
a non–zero vector perpendicular to both X and Y .
LEMMA 8.6.1 Let X and Y be non–zero, non–parallel vectors.
(i) Z is a linear combination of X and Y , if and only if Z is perpendicular
to X × Y ;
(ii) Z is perpendicular to X and Y , if and only if Z is parallel to X × Y .
Proof. Let X and Y be non–zero, non–parallel vectors. Then
X × Y ̸= 0.
Then if X × Y = ai + bj + ck, we have

Hence the matrix [X × Y |X|Y ] is non–singular. Consequently the linear
system
r(X × Y ) + sX + tY = Z
(8.15)
has a unique solution r, s, t.
(i) Suppose Z = sX + tY . Then
Z · (X × Y ) = sX · (X × Y ) + tY · (X × Y ) = s0 + t0 = 0.
Conversely, suppose that
Z · (X × Y ) = 0.
(8.16)
Now from equation 8.15, r, s, t exist satisfying
Z = r(X × Y ) + sX + tY.
Then equation 8.16 gives
0
=
(r(X × Y ) + sX + tY ) · (X × Y )
=
r||X × Y ||2 + sX · (X × Y ) + tY · (Y × X)
=
r||X × Y ||2.
Hence r = 0 and Z = sX + tY , as required.
(ii) Suppose Z = λ(X × Y ). Then clearly Z is perpendicular to X and Y .

8.6. THE CROSS–PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS
175
Conversely suppose that Z is perpendicular to X and Y .
Now from equation 8.15, r, s, t exist satisfying
Z = r(X × Y ) + sX + tY.
Then
sX · X + tX · Y
=
X · Z = 0
sY · X + tY · Y
=
Y · Z = 0,
from which it follows that
(sX + tY ) · (sX + tY ) = 0.
Hence sX + tY = 0 and so s = 0, t = 0. Consequently Z = r(X × Y ), as
required.
The cross–product gives a compact formula for the distance from a point
to a line, as well as the area of a triangle.
THEOREM 8.6.1 (Area of a triangle)

(i) the distance d from C to the line AB is given by

(8.18)

8.7
Planes
DEFINITION 8.7.1 A plane is a set of points P satisfying an equation
of the form
P = P0 + sX + tY, s, t ∈R,
(8.19)
where X and Y are non–zero, non–parallel vectors.
For example, the xy–plane consists of the points P = (x, y, 0) and corre-
sponds to the plane equation
P = xi + yj = O + xi + yj.
In terms of coordinates, equation 8.19 takes the form
x
=
x0 + sa1 + ta2
y
=
y0 + sb1 + tb2
z
=
z0 + sc1 + tc2,
where P0 = (x0, y0, z0) and (a1, b1, c1) and (a2, b2, c2) are non–zero and
non–proportional.
THEOREM 8.7.1 Let A, B, C be three non–collinear points. Then there
is one and only one plane through these points, namely the plane given by
the equation
P = A + s
-
AB +t
-
AC,
(8.20)
or equivalently
-
AP= s

Figure 8.15: Vector equation for the plane ABC.
Proof.
First note that equation 8.20 is indeed the equation of a plane
through A, B and C, as
-
AB and
-
AC are non–zero and non–parallel and
(s, t) = (0, 0), (1, 0) and (0, 1) give P = A, B and C, respectively. Call
this plane P.
Conversely, suppose P = P0 + sX + tY is the equation of a plane Q
passing through A, B, C. Then A = P0 + s0X + t0Y , so the equation for
Q may be written
P = A + (s −s0)X + (t −t0)Y = A + s′X + t′Y ;
so in eﬀect we can take P0 = A in the equation of Q. Then the fact that B
and C lie on Q gives equations
B = A + s1X + t1Y,
C = A + s2X + t2Y,
or
-
AB= s1X + t1Y,
-
AC= s2X + t2Y.
(8.22)
Then equations 8.22 and equation 8.20 show that
P ⊆Q.
Conversely, it is straightforward to show that because
-
AB and
-
AC are not
parallel, we have

Hence
Q = P.
THEOREM 8.7.2 (Normal equation for a plane) Let

have P ∈P if and only if

AP is a linear combination of

AB and

by lemma 8.6.1(i), using the fact that
-

-
AC̸= 0 here, if and only if

Equation 8.24 is the scalar triple product version of equation 8.23, taking
into account the equations

But a, b, c are the components of

A, B, C are non–collinear here.
Conversely if ai + bj + ck ̸= 0, the equation

where P0 = (−d

ai + k are evidently
non–parallel vectors.
REMARK 8.7.3 The plane equation ax+by +cz = d is called the normal
form, as it is easy to prove that if P1 and P2 are two points in the plane,
then ai + bj + ck is perpendicular to
-
P1P2. Any non–zero vector with this
property is called a normal to the plane. (See Figure 8.17.)

8.7. PLANES
181
By lemma 8.6.1(ii), it follows that every vector X normal to a plane
through three non–collinear points A, B, C is parallel to
-
AB ×
-
AC, since
X is perpendicular to
-
AB and
-
AC.
EXAMPLE 8.7.1 Show that the planes
x + y −2z = 1
and
x + 3y −z = 4
intersect in a line and ﬁnd the distance from the point C = (1, 0, 1) to this
line.
Solution. Solving the two equations simultaneously gives
x = −1

y = 3

(8.27)
where z is arbitrary. Hence
xi + yj + zk = −1
2i −3
2j + z(5

2j + k),
which is the equation of a line L through A = (−1
2, −3
2, 0) and having
direction vector 5
2i −1
2j + k.
We can now proceed in one of three ways to ﬁnd the closest point on L
to A.
One way is to use equation 8.17 with B deﬁned by
-
AB= 5
2i −1
2j + k.
Another method minimizes the distance CP, where P ranges over L.
A third way is to ﬁnd an equation for the plane through C, having
5
2i −1
2j + k as a normal. Such a plane has equation
5x −y + 2z = d,
where d is found by substituting the coordinates of C in the last equation.
d = 5 × 1 −0 + 2 × 1 = 7.
We now ﬁnd the point P where the plane intersects the line L. Then
-
CP
will be perpendicular to L and CP will be the required shortest distance
from C to L. We ﬁnd using equations 8.27 that
5(−1

so z = 11
15. Hence P = ( 4
3, 17
15, 11
15).
It is clear that through a given line and a point not on that line, there
passes exactly one plane. If the line is given as the intersection of two planes,
each in normal form, there is a simple way of ﬁnding an equation for this
plane. More explicitly we have the following result:
THEOREM 8.7.3 Suppose the planes
a1x + b1y + c1z
=
d1
(8.28)
a2x + b2y + c2z
=
d2
(8.29)
have non–parallel normals. Then the planes intersect in a line L.
Moreover the equation
λ(a1x + b1y + c1z −d1) + µ(a2x + b2y + c2z −d2) = 0,
(8.30)
where λ and µ are not both zero, gives all planes through L.
(See Figure 8.18.)
Proof. Assume that the normals a1i + b1j + c1k and a2i + b2j + c2k are
non–parallel. Then by theorem 8.4.3, not all of
∆1 =

are zero. If say ∆1 ̸= 0, we can solve equations 8.28 and 8.29 for x and y in
terms of z, as we did in the previous example, to show that the intersection
forms a line L.
We next have to check that if λ and µ are not both zero, then equa-
tion 8.30 represents a plane. (Whatever set of points equation 8.30 repre-
sents, this set certainly contains L.)
(λa1 + µa2)x + (λb1 + µb2)y + (λc1 + µc2)z −(λd1 + µd2) = 0.
Then we clearly cannot have all the coeﬃcients
λa1 + µa2,
λb1 + µb2,
λc1 + µc2
zero, as otherwise the vectors a1i + b1j + c1k and a2i + b2j + c2k would be
parallel.
Finally, if P is a plane containing L, let P0 = (x0, y0, z0) be a point not
on L. Then if we deﬁne λ and µ by
λ = −(a2x0 + b2y0 + c2z0 −d2),
µ = a1x0 + b1y0 + c1z0 −d1,
then at least one of λ and µ is non–zero. Then the coordinates of P0 satisfy
equation 8.30, which therefore represents a plane passing through L and P0
and hence identical with P.
EXAMPLE 8.7.2 Find an equation for the plane through P0 = (1, 0, 1)
and passing through the line of intersection of the planes
x + y −2z = 1
and
x + 3y −z = 4.
Solution. The required plane has the form
λ(x + y −2z −1) + µ(x + 3y −z −4) = 0,
where not both of λ and µ are zero. Substituting the coordinates of P0 into
this equation gives
−2λ + µ(−4) = 0,
λ = −2µ.
So the required equation is
−2µ(x + y −2z −1) + µ(x + 3y −z −4) = 0,
or
−x + y + 3z −2 = 0.
Our ﬁnal result is a formula for the distance from a point to a plane.

THEOREM 8.7.4 (Distance from a point to a plane)
Let P0 = (x0, y0, z0) and P be the plane

P = P0 + t(ai + bj + ck),
or in terms of coordinates
x = x0 + at,

z = z0 + ct.
Substituting these formulae in equation 8.32 gives
