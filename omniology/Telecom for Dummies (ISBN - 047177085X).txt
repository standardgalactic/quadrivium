About the Author
Stephen Olejniczak (pronounced ole-en-ee-check) is the Director of Operations
for ATI Communications, and has over ten years of telecom experience under
his belt. His initial job in telecom was provisioning data services, eventually
taking a position as the customer service manager for a small long-distance
company, and finally as its manager of dedicated provisioning.
Stephen did not start out in life as a techie, only falling prey to the glamour
and easy money after failing to find a career that enabled him to use his
Bachelors degree in Cultural Anthropology.  He currently lives in the quaint
hamlet of Laguna Beach, California, with his wife, Kayley, and a collection of
fountain pens.
Dedication
This book is dedicated to the entire telecom industry. From the CEOs of large
carriers to everyone that supplies, sells, or uses phone service (I guess that
is everyone in the world), I give you this tome of information. The primary
group in the industry to whom I dedicate this book are those new employees
who have just entered the wild world of telecom. The learning curve in tele-
com is vertical for at least the first six months, and it is easy to feel over-
whelmed. Don’t let anyone talk down to you, because we all started out
knowing nothing.


Author’s Acknowledgments
The greatest motivation and support for this book came from my beautiful
wife, Kayley. I am glad that it is complete and we can now travel again.
This book would not be completed if it weren’t for the guidance of my Wiley
editor, Nicole Haims, who took through the entire process. I must also
acknowledge the great work put forward by my technical editor, Frank
Piotrowski, who validated everything I wrote, down to the molecular level.
Additional props to Kezia Endsley for copyediting assistance. I also received
invaluable input from Brady Kirby, of Atlas VoIP Communications, as well as
my friends, Chris Lynch and Carl, who kept me on track and running in the
data sections. These are only a handful of the brilliant people I have spoken
with over the years, from whom I have extracted valuable information that
was quickly used to mentor my employees and customers.
Finally, I must give thanks to every customer, salesperson, and coworker who
asked me the same questions over and over (and over) again. I wasn’t prais-
ing you after we chatted at 3:30 a.m. on a Saturday because you wanted to
know the country code for Sierra Leone, but now I realize you have given me
the depth and breadth of information necessary to write this book.

Introduction
W
elcome to Telecom For Dummies, a book for people who work in tele-
com (99 percent of whom come into the industry through no fault of
their own). You’re probably a very smart person, and so your boss decided
to give you the responsibility of handling that expensive communication net-
work that keeps the company in business. Don’t worry! This book can help
you work through almost any question you have about telecom. In the end,
you will be very comfortable with your new environment and you will con-
tinue to impress others as the wonder kid they always believed you to be.
This book contains everything you need to know to order, maintain, and trou-
bleshoot basic phone service. It covers the nuts and bolts of how phone sys-
tems work, why they work, and why it sometimes takes so long for them to
work. When you have questions, simply track down the chapter and subsec-
tion that covers the issue in question, and after a little reading, you will be
able to talk to any technician with confidence.
About This Book
This book was not intended for bedtime reading from cover to cover. It is a
very helpful reference for telecom products, applications, and troubleshoot-
ing. The first few parts cover finding a phone service that best suits your
business needs. Another part provides the ins and outs of ordering what 
you need. If you already have a phone system set up, move to the part that
covers what you need to know to troubleshoot the circuits and systems
you’ve installed.
Every chapter has been written with you, not an MIT technician, in mind. The
information is easy to understand and digest, even if you have absolutely no
prior telecom knowledge. If additional information might be helpful, I refer
you to another chapter for more information. 
Telecom For Dummies is applicable to almost all phone service in North
America, including Canada, many of the Caribbean countries and Guam. The
regulations and infrastructure for telecom vary between most countries, and
although some aspects may be applicable in Europe and Asia, the steps for
ordering and testing systems vary.

Conventions Used in This Book
We’ve used a few conventions in this book to make it easier for you to spot
special information. Here are those conventions:
 New terms are identified by using italic and followed by a short 
definition.
 Web site addresses (URLs) are designated by using a monospace font.
 If I tell you to dial a number or type a specific command, the command
appears in boldface. 
What You Don’t Have to Read
You don’t have to read anything that doesn’t apply to your needs. If you don’t
have a phone system, or dedicated circuits, or place any international calls,
for example, you can ignore the sections that cover them. The book contains
enough great information that you won’t hurt my feelings by jumping from
chapter to chapter (or even from section to section). 
Icons Used in This Book
Telecom For Dummies includes icons that point out special information. Here
are the icons I use and what they mean:
This icon makes you feel like a real telecom pro. It highlights special tricks
and shortcuts that make understanding and maneuvering within the vast tele-
com world even easier. Don’t skip this information!
This icon reminds you of important information that can be far too easy to
forget and which can cause a lot of frustration when you do forget. 
Be careful when you see this icon. It points out an area where you’ll want to
be extra cautious so that you don’t cause yourself problems. It also tells you
how to avoid the problems.
Technical Stuff is information for folks who want to know all the geeky
details.

Telecom For Dummies 

Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you have seen a phone, dialed a phone, and have had a conver-
sation on a phone before. In addition to that, your job is somehow linked to
buying, selling, using, or supporting some kind of telecommunications ser-
vice. I assume the following about your everyday contact with telecom tools
and systems (perhaps you don’t fit in every one of these scenarios, but you
recognize yourself in at least a few of them):
 You have to make decisions on buying or upgrading phone services. 
 You have had problems ordering phone service in the past and want to
know some tips on how to keep moving forward without unnecessary
delays.
 You have an inventory of toll-free numbers that you must manage.
 You want to find the most efficient way to speak to your carriers and
hardware vendors so they understand your needs and expectations.
 You would like to have the power to troubleshoot issues, such as failed
calls and quality issues, without relying on someone else for answers.
How This Book Is Organized
Telecom For Dummies has six parts. Each part is self-contained, but all the
content is somewhat interconnected. That way you’ll see the most useful
information without a lot of boring repetition.
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Services
This part explains the landscape of telecom, the key players, and how they
work together. I describe the differences in responsibilities between local,
long-distance, and wireless carriers. I also include information that intro-
duces the basic telecom features and options.
Part II: Reviewing Telecom 
Products and Prices
Not every telecom product is right for every customer. Part II reviews the
most common telecom products so that you can evaluate which of them are
right for your business. This part covers a wide range of services, and helps
you analyze whether you should jump from regular (switched) phone service
3
Introduction

to dedicated phone service. It also gives you the lay of the toll-free land and
helps you maneuver through your phone bill, looking for areas that are cost-
ing you more money than they should. Stop the bleeding in this part, and
figure out which of your potential telecom investments will give you the best
return.
Part III: Ordering and Setting 
Up Telecom Service
The second most painful aspect of telecom is ordering new service (see Part
IV for the most painful aspect of telecom). This part guides you through the
ordering process for all services, from regular (switched) phone lines to dedi-
cated circuits, to toll-free service. Because dedicated and toll-free services are
complicated, I include a chapter in this part that goes the extra mile, showing
you how to activate these services after you order them. All along the way, I
tell you about potential pitfalls so that you can successfully avoid them. 
Part IV: Taking Care of 
Your Telecom System
The most painful aspect of telecom is troubleshooting problems. The issue
afflicting your system may be huge or microscopic, but you still need to fix it.
Part IV covers troubleshooting switched phone lines, dedicated phone lines,
and toll-free service in a step-by-step manner that enables you to make quick
work of almost any problem. By following the rules I set out for you in this
part, you can systematically identify problems and keep your technicians
from going on a wild goose chase.
Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) 
in the Telecom World
The chapters in Part V cover the world of telecom — beyond voice phone
calls. I cover the basics of data transfer technologies, and the hottest buzz-
word in telecom right now, VoIP. Part V won’t show you how to write the code
to transfer the data, but it does give you an overview of the newest and great-
est technology, gives you some hints on pricing, and tells you about the hard-
ware required to create a data-transfer interface with your carrier.

Telecom For Dummies 

Part VI: The Part of Tens
Part VI covers industry buzzwords, personality disorders, and where to go for
help. How’s that for a mélange? When you use common acronyms casually
when speaking to your carrier reps and technicians, they know that you’re not
clueless about telecom. The section on telecom traits provides behavior to
look out for and hints on how to avoid it. Finally, the last chapter lists
resources to tap into when you are at your wit’s end.
At the end of the Part of Tens is an appendix I tacked on to show you how 
to make male and female loopback plugs. These little gadgets are simple 
and small, but they are invaluable to troubleshooting phone systems.
Where to Go from Here
The best place to start on this book is the Table of Contents or Index if you
want to key in on information about a specific topic. Not sure whether you
have a dedicated circuit or what your local carrier’s responsibilities are?
Chapter 1 can help you get your bearings. 
Depending on the specific aspect of telecom you need to research, you may
want to jump to Chapter 6 to find out about what’s going on with your phone
bill, or if you’re experiencing a major malfunction right now, skip to Chapter
13 to figure out how to troubleshoot your dedicated circuit. This is your buffet
of telecom goodies; check out the entire offering and dive into the sections
you think are tasty.

E
very business in the world either uses or could benefit from using phone
service. Even if your business deals directly with the public, you still
need to call your manufacturer for updates on shipments, check on the ads
you have going out, and make sure your accountant has all of your financial
information. As your business grows, so does your need for phone lines, not
just to enable you to speak to your customers and suppliers, but also to
transmit data between offices, and possibly even maintain a Web site to
receive and track orders.
Growth in business is great, but you may easily find yourself overwhelmed by
the logistics involved in all the changes. The phone system you had 2 years
ago may have been perfect for you at the time, but today you have 20 new
employees in house, 5 new outside sales reps, and the Web site for Internet
orders is being released next week. If that is the case, you have probably out-
grown your old telephone system. The important thing to know is how to
gauge the technology you have, where you are going, and what technology
you need to get there. In this chapter, I help you figure out what you’re deal-
ing with and get you started on your quest to improve your telecommunica-
tion, or telecom system.

Assessing Your Telecom Services 
As They Are Now
At the most basic level, telecom refers to any service that is provided over
phone lines. Included in this definition are
 Internet connections over dedicated circuits or dial-up modems
 Regular phone lines used to place and receive calls to your mom
 High-speed data links used for transmitting information 
When you boil things down, all phone service can be reduced to the same
basic principles of transmitting and receiving signals over fiberoptic or
copper wire.
For example, if a backhoe cuts through a fiberoptic cable that supplies your
Internet connection, along with the service from your local carrier, your only
connection to the outside world becomes your mobile phone. If your mobile
phone provider also uses that link to complete calls, you still may not have a
connection to the outside world. With the increase in redundancy being built
into the local and long-distance networks, you shouldn’t have an outage that
completely shuts down your service. If you have a good telecom system,
when (not if) a breakdown in the network occurs, stopping calls from passing
through the east side of town, your system can automatically route calls to
an alternative network on the west side. 
Many companies rely heavily upon their phone service, and any outage, no
matter how small, has a large impact. Sometimes the problem is an act of 
God, (say your carrier’s switch is struck by a bolt of lightening, reducing it to a
smoldering brick of silicon and steel valuable only as a piece of modern art).
Other issues may be the result of bottlenecks in your own phone system, or
just a need for more phone lines. The first step to taking care of these issues is
to assess the phone service you need right now.
Identifying Your Carriers
A telecom carrier is an entity that provides and bills for phone service. It
would be convenient if I could classify a carrier based on the fact that it owns
a large fiberoptic network and multimillion-dollar phone switches, but not all
of them do. Some carriers own no hardware and simply contract with other
companies that have sophisticated hardware networks. 
10
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

Actually, all carriers have contracts with other carriers to sublet space on
their networks. Subletting enables them to build more redundancy into their
systems (which is good thing for customers). In some areas, subcontracting
also helps carriers get substantial price breaks when they try to negotiate
new contracts to gain entrance into a specific market. 
In fact, the best way to understand carriers is based on their functions.
Carriers treat local networks, long-distance networks, mobile networks, 
and more.
Looking locally
Local carriers provide local service. If you call from your office to the building
next door, your local carrier receives the call and completes it to the other
building. In addition to providing local calling services, local carriers also pro-
vide you with dial tone on your residential or simple business phone lines,
assign your phone number, provide 911 (emergency service), 411 (informa-
tion), toll-free service and a host of other features like call waiting, caller ID,
and sometimes even voicemail. One of the most important functions of the
local carrier is to identify every call you make as being local, long distance, or
toll free, and then to route it to the appropriate carrier to complete.
The industry refers to local carriers primarily as local exchange carriers (LECs).
When you think of LECs, names like Bell Atlantic, Bell South, Ameritech, or
Verizon come to mind. These are all companies that were lucky enough to be
given the limited monopoly to provide local service to a specific geographic
area. America was carved up based on local population statistics and state bor-
ders when the Ma Bell monopoly got broken up in the 1980s. 
LECs are also known by other names. The LECs that were part of the initial
monopolies given by the U.S. government and generally have the word Bell
in their names are sometimes grouped as RBOCs (pronounced ahrr-boks). An
RBOC is a Regional Bell Operating Company. At times, RBOCs are also referred
to as ILECs (pronounced eye-leks). The ILEC designation identifies a carrier as
being the senior LEC in the area, specifically, the incumbent local exchange car-
rier. Throughout this book, I avoid using too much jargon by simply referring
to the carrier that supplies your local telecom service as your local carrier.
Introducing competing local 
exchange carriers
A competing local exchange carrier (CLEC) does the same work as other local
carriers. The special name simply signifies that these carriers arrived on the
scene later than the baby Bells referred to in the previous section, “Looking
locally.”
11
Chapter 1: A Buyer’s Scoop on Telecom

Any company that can assign you a phone number, but was not given the
monopoly for the area by the government, is technically a CLEC. This cate-
gory includes wireless providers, VoIP (Voice over IP) providers, and the true
CLECs whose sole goal, in the spirit of free-market economics, is to compete
with (and eventually replace) the Verizons and Ameritechs of America. 
Going for long distance
Long-distance carriers receive and complete calls that terminate outside of the
U.S., across a state border, or across a geographically defined border within
the state called a LATA (Local Access Transport Area). Long-distance func-
tions were specifically denied to the local carriers during deregulation and
spawned the growth of the long-distance industry. 
You can break long-distance carriers into two categories:
 Facilities-based long-distance carriers: The first companies that come to
mind when you think of long-distance carriers are AT&T, Sprint, and MCI.
These are companies that own huge telecom networks, million-dollar
telephony routing switches, and enough cabling to tie us to the moon 
ten times. All the equipment and stuff — the hardware and cabling —
that these companies own establish these carriers as facilities-based
providers. Generally, only large companies worth hundreds of millions of
dollars fall into this category, but ever since the long-distance industry
was born, the number of facilities-based long-distance carriers has been
growing. 
 Switchless resellers: Along with the AT&Ts and MCIs of the U.S. came a
new breed of long-distance carrier. These companies don’t own any
12
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 
Understanding how CLECs got a piece of the pie
There were two basic ways the CLECs gained the
ability to provide local service to their customers.
They either spent millions of dollars on cabling
and hardware to replace the networks of the
ILECS or they contracted with the ILECs to resell
ILEC services at discounted rates. Companies like
ICG Communications and XO Communications
spent millions of dollars building their infrastruc-
tures and securing contracts in the local area to
allow them to compete with the ILECs. 
All this work was done in an attempt to gain
access to the businesses and residences in the
CLEC’s target market. The advent of functional
Voice over IP (VoIP) enables CLECs to use the
existing copper wires that connect networks 
to the Internet so that they can also carry phone
calls. Making phone calls online greatly increases
the number of potential customers for the CLECs
and reduces the overhead required to connect to
them. I discuss VoIP in Chapter 15. 

hardware or network facilities, but simply resell existing services from
the larger facilities-based carriers like Sprint or Qwest. So-called switch-
less resellers sign contracts with large carriers for a specific per-minute
rate and then resell the service to companies and residences for a profit. 
Generally, switchless resellers are much smaller companies and fit a
niche market of customers who want to mix the personal service typi-
cally available from a smaller company with the stability and network
functions that only a large company can provide. In return for an inex-
pensive per-minute rate from the carrier, the switchless reseller takes
over the job of providing all customer service functions and billing ser-
vices to customers. Switchless resellers can be your business’s best
friend, and save you quite a bit of money; or they can be a nightmare
and cost you a lot. If you’re considering using a switchless reseller, you
should research the company and its management team. Ask for some
references before you jump into a contract with any switchless reseller.
Working with wireless providers
Wireless communication is a method of transporting a call more than it is a
standard division of labor within the telecom world. The wireless industry
was born after the telecom industry was deregulated and as a result, the
industry enjoys all the benefits of the breakup. The wireless companies func-
tion just as CLECs do, but can also provide long-distance service. 
Wireless providers have the benefit of much lower start-up costs than other
telecom providers, because they simply install hardware to transmit and
receive wireless calls where the hardware is needed instead of digging up end-
less miles of roads to lay down new cabling. Today, technology has evolved 
to the point that you can send and receive e-mail and text messages, surf the
Internet, and download video — all with your wireless phone. This is the one
part of telecom that enables you to have it all in one device.
Knowing Why Your Company 
Needs Telecom
The first question you need to ask yourself is, “What do I want telecom to do
for me?” The answer to this question depends on several factors, including
the following:
 Your industry
 The type of business you have
 The size of your business
13
Chapter 1: A Buyer’s Scoop on Telecom

If your business is in the car rental industry and all of your competitors have
toll-free numbers, then you probably need to keep up with the Joneses. If
your business deals only with exotic car rentals, a toll-free number may not
be mandatory, but a Web site displaying the Porsches and Ferraris may be a
must. A national car rental chain may need an extensive data network to keep
everyone informed about which cars are available at all locations. Take a
moment to look at your company and your competitors to find out where you
want to be in your industry. The services you and your customers demand
will fall into five categories:
 Voice service: This is standard phone service that you have been using
since the first time you called your Grandma to thank her for a birthday
present. You need voice service (and you probably already have it), so a
bigger question is whether most of your calls are outbound, inbound, or
a relatively even combination of outbound and inbound calls. If most of
your calls are outbound, and you only receive a few inbound calls a
week, then standard voice service may be all your business needs. 
 Toll-free service: A toll-free number is a special number that enables
calls to come in from anywhere without the caller incurring a charge.
The called party pays all the charges for the call. How much the called
party pays for a call depends on the arrangements made with the long-
distance carrier. If you look at all of your voice calls and find that the
majority of them are inbound from customers, you could probably bene-
fit from toll-free service. For many companies, not having a toll-free
number is disastrous. If your car breaks down and you have to call for
assistance from a pay phone, would you rather pay 50 cents to contact
the answering machine of a tow truck or taxi company, or would you
rather call for free? If you’re on hold for a couple of minutes on a toll-free
call, at least you’re not paying for it. Toll-free service is more complex
than regular outbound service, and is covered in detail in Chapter 5.
People prefer to dial 800 numbers when they are going to order some-
thing, be it Diamonique jewelry or towing service. If you have to pay $75
to tow your car (and goodness knows how much to repair it), at least
you can rest easy knowing that your phone call to the towing agency is
the only part of the experience that doesn’t cost a thing.
 Data services: The term data services usually refers to non-voice com-
munications such as e-mail, text messaging, and fax services that are
transmitted over a private network. In every company, information
needs to travel from one side of the office to another side of the office.
The sales team closes the order and relays it to the order-entry depart-
ment. The order-entry department logs the order and sends it to the
manufacturing department; the manufacturing department builds and
tracks the order; and the shipping department sends the order to the
customer. For smaller companies, all these steps may be taken care of
14
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

with an Excel spreadsheet or an industry-specific software package. As
your company grows, however, more people in more offices need the
same information, and the physical location of the offices is farther and
farther apart. Last year, your business’s second location may have been
across the hall in the same building, but today you could have a London
office that generates information that comes to you in Los Angeles
before you send it off to your Tokyo division. Data transmission can be
done in many ways, and your decision will be based on the physical
location of your offices, the frequency of data transmissions, and the
amount of data being transmitted. The up-and-coming data service tech-
nologies, as well as the old standbys, are covered in greater detail in
Chapter 14.
 Internet Service: Every office needs a connection to the Internet, if for
no other reason than to enable employees to send and receive e-mail
and while away the hours Googling their names. Many companies use
the Internet to research their competitors, or they may use the Internet
to visit suppliers’ Web sites to place orders, review shipments, and
request services. I can safely say that this portion of your telecom needs
will not decrease in the future — it will increase incrementally. Many
companies integrate the private networks transmitting their data ser-
vices and their need to access the Internet on the public network.
 Wireless service: Wireless service can encompass all the other cate-
gories in this list, but because wireless service is usually provided by a
different company than the one that provides your land lines, you need
to view it as a separate telecom service. If you have an external sales
force or a 24-hour service department that makes house calls, wireless
service is an essential part of your business.
Introducing Dedicated 
Long-Distance Circuits
There is one big hurdle in telecom, and after you jump this barrier you move
from Junior Varsity to Varsity. That transition is the jump from regular phone
lines (what the industry calls switched lines) for long-distance use to dedi-
cated long-distance circuits.
You probably use regular switched phone lines at home every day. Many
small businesses have them, and even large businesses have a handful of
switched lines for backup purposes, to run security services, or to handle
overflow phone calls. Switched lines are wonderful because you can do
everything with them: You can call 411 or 911, dial a toll-free number, call
your brother next door, or your aunt on vacation in Istanbul. What is even
better is that other people can easily call you. 
15
Chapter 1: A Buyer’s Scoop on Telecom

Dedicated long-distance circuits are good only for long-distance calls, whether
they are to another state or another country. However, dedicated long-distance
circuits do have some downsides. Several of the features that you take for
granted are not provided on them. Services that are not available on dedicated
long-distance circuits are:
 Access to 911 emergency service.
 Access to 411 information service.
 Access to 611 telephone repair service.
 The ability to dial toll-free numbers.
 The ability to dial long-distance bypass codes for your calls. These are
the 10-10 codes you may have heard about on TV.
 The ability to receive calls by any means other than a toll-free number.
Actually, no dedicated circuit has a phone number naturally built into it. You
can receive inbound calls on your dedicated circuit, but only with a toll-free
number pointed to your circuit or special Direct-Inward Dialing (DID) service
from a carrier. DIDs only allow you to receive calls, and act like toll-free num-
bers, sending calls into your dedicated circuit, but not being listed on your
caller ID when you dial out from it. DIDs are generally only available on cir-
cuits set up by your local carrier, and not for long-distance circuits.
16
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 
Getting dedicated locally
Dedicated circuits are classified by the carrier
to which they terminate. A dedicated circuit that
ends at your long-distance carrier is a dedi-
cated long-distance circuit. A dedicated circuit
that ends at your local carrier is a dedicated
local circuit. Local circuits can be filled with
phone numbers that act just like switched lines. 
Those businesses with dedicated local services
have several phone numbers for each local cir-
cuit, probably 24 (one for each usable channel).
The only problem you may have with dedicated
local circuits is that your long-distance carrier
sees the outbound calls coming from your local
circuit as originating from a phone number and
not a circuit. Your dedicated long-distance rates
are only applied on calls that originate on a ded-
icated long-distance circuit. Calls originating from
a local circuit appear as coming from a regular
switched phone line, and as a result, your long-
distance carrier rates these calls at a higher
switched rate. There are instances where the
benefits of a local circuit outweigh the increased
per-minute cost you will see from your long-
distance carrier, but you should keep the finan-
cial consequences in mind when you decide to
make the leap to a dedicated local circuit.

With all these limitations on long-distance circuits, you might wonder why
anyone orders them. The reasons add up quickly in per-minute cost savings.
Just as you get a better deal when you buy anything in bulk, you receive a
better per-minute rate on a dedicated circuit. 
If you’re pushing enough long-distance minutes through your existing phone
lines, you simply have to add up the numbers to see whether jumping to a
dedicated circuit will benefit your business in the short and long term. 
The leap from switched service to dedicated circuits is the only significant
jump to be made in telecom. The industry recognizes two categories of pric-
ing: one for switched phone lines and the second for service provided via
dedicated circuits. Unless you elect to become a carrier and become eligible
for dedicated carrier pricing, there isn’t another plateau in the industry avail-
able capable of reducing your per-minute cost by 40 percent. The moment
you install additional dedicated circuits you are not guaranteed a better rate,
but you do have more leverage when you renegotiate your contract. The cost
justification for dedicated service is covered in detail in Chapter 2 with some
real-world numbers that can guide you to see if it is right for your business. 
Finding People to Help You 
Make the Right Choices
The one thing I can guarantee about telecom is that it is always changing. The
hot technology of today will be replaced by the hot technology of six months
from now. Unless you work in the telecom industry, it is very difficult to keep
up on the changes and figure out how your company can best use them. You
need a support team. In telecom, just as in life, everyone is a potential source
of information. Keep that in mind when it comes to your phone service. Some
of the people to whom you have access could save you thousands or millions
of dollars on your phone bill over the course of a year. The following sections
point out the important people you need to know and trust if you want to use
the best technology at the lowest rates.
Meeting the sales rep
Every carrier has a sales force whose members would love to meet you if
they haven’t already. The sales people come in two flavors, the carrier sales
rep, and the independent sales agent. They are distinctly separate creatures
and should be treated as such.
17
Chapter 1: A Buyer’s Scoop on Telecom

 The carrier sales rep works solely for, and is paid by, one carrier
(whether a long-distance carrier, a local carrier, a wireless service
provider, or another carrier). Whatever your application is, the rep 
finds some solution, based on the technology the carrier has available.
Remember, this solution may not be the best solution for you, but it is
the best solution the carrier can offer. For example, maybe you need a
low-cost calling option for your sales force in Germany. Instead of offer-
ing you international toll-free numbers, the carrier sales rep may offer
calling cards with international origination.
 The independent sales agent is generally a better person to chat with.
She probably represents four or five different carriers, all with different
strengths, weaknesses, and support levels. The best thing about an inde-
pendent sales agent is that the agent doesn’t have any allegiance to any
one of the networks. The agent will sell you toll-free numbers from MCI
just as quickly as she’ll offer outbound dedicated circuits from Qwest
and calling cards from Broadwing. The independent sales agent really
doesn’t care which options you choose, just as long as you’re happy 
and you renew your contracts.
If you’re not sure what you want to do, talk to your carrier sales rep first.
This person is outstanding if you’re fishing for new ideas. Start your conver-
sation by asking the rep to go over your existing telecom services; then dis-
cuss what you want telecom to do for you. Ask what alternatives the carrier
has for accomplishing those goals. I promise that if you present a salesperson
with a telecom problem, he or she will come back with at least one solution,
even if it’s not the best one. If you don’t have an existing long-distance carrier
sales rep, you can have one assigned to you by calling the customer service
department and asking to speak to someone. 
Seeking out a hardware vendor
If you have anything more complicated than single-line local carrier services,
you need a hardware vendor. If you have a phone system, you may already
have a hardware vendor that you call when you need service. 
The technician that actually services your hardware probably loves all things
complex and convoluted. Reps and techies for hardware vendors are out-
standing individuals to chat with when you are about to make any change to
your phone service. Your vendor rep or technician probably knows the latest
technology on the market and would love to tell you about it — you may even
get more information than you ever asked for or wanted. The best thing is
that your hardware vendor already knows what kind of phone system you
have — and whether the latest gadget can actually be installed with it.

Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

It is wonderful that VoIP is the darling of the telecom world today, but if you
have to completely rip out $35,000 in phones and equipment and shell out
$100,000 for new hardware, this technology may not be such a great deal
after all. Your hardware vendor can alert you of this fact immediately. 
Begin your quest for new and better solutions with a carrier sales rep or 
independent sales agent, and then circle back to your hardware vendor to
confirm that your plans won’t require a complete overhaul of your existing
system. If you don’t have a vendor, check out the following sections, “Finding
a hardware vendor from your sales agent” and “Finding a hardware vendor
from the manufacturer.”
Finding a hardware vendor from your sales agent
If you inherited your phone system, you may not know where it was pur-
chased. Likewise, if you don’t have any phone system to speak of, you 
need to find a vendor on your own. 
You’re better off finding a vendor today than waiting until your system goes
down or you’re ready for an upgrade. Finding a new vendor who can give 
you an accurate assessment of your current telecom system can take three
months or more. Your sales agent is generally a good person to ask for refer-
ences on hardware vendors. Over the course of a career in telecom, sales
agents bump into good vendors and bad vendors. Your agent can happily
refer you to a competent and professional company, often offering testimoni-
als about how this or that person helped the agent or a colleague out of a
tight spot. 
Ask for at least two different companies, just so you have some options.
Hardware vendors generally specialize on certain makes or models of specific
phone systems, so your first question should be, “Which phone systems are
your specialties?” If a vendor only handles Newbridge channel banks and you
have an Avaya system, you need to keep searching. Honest vendors have no
problem referring you to a business in the industry that specializes in the
hardware you have. 
Finding a hardware vendor from the manufacturer
If you strike out with your sales agent and their referrals (see “Finding a hard-
ware vendor from your sales agent”), don’t give up; contact the manufacturer
of your hardware. 
Not sure who made your hardware? Take a small walk to your phone closet.
No idea where your phone closet is? Follow these steps to find out more
about your system and use the info to track down a vendor:
1. Track all of your phone lines to the place in your office where they
converge into one large plastic or metal box. 
19
Chapter 1: A Buyer’s Scoop on Telecom

That’s your phone closet. On the outside of the box, you see a manufac-
turer name and model. For example, the outside of the box might say
something like ADTRAN TSU600 or Newbridge 3624 Mainstreet. 
2. Write down the names on all the boxes your phone lines go through
before they leave the phone closet.
Be especially careful to note anything that has the words MUX, multi-
plexer, PBX, or key system. The more information you have the better. 
3. After you acquire information about the manufacturer, track down
the companies on the Internet. 
Somewhere on the manufacturer’s Web site you will see a section for ser-
vice. Many manufacturers even include vendor locators. 
4. Track down two or three of the nearest service companies and ask to
conduct a phone interview. 
You are looking for a rep that is professional, responsive, and knowl-
edgeable. If you’re not filled with confidence when you chat with a rep,
you probably won’t be filled with much confidence when you see the
company’s techs stumbling through your equipment. 
When you’ve settled on a vendor, you need to have a rep come to your site to
give your hardware a once-over. This meeting gets the vendor familiar with
your system — and you familiar with the technicians. 
Use this little meet and greet to have the talk about how your system is 
serving your company’s needs. The manufacturer may have released a new
card that gives your system twice its current capacity, three times the cur-
rent number of features, and costs half what you would spend to repair the
system in the event of its impending meltdown. You won’t know this informa-
tion until you ask — this is definitely a conversation worth having. See the
next section, “Planning for Growth,” for more information.
Planning for Growth
No company stands still. Your business is either expanding or (I hope not)
contracting. If your company is bursting at the seams, you need to begin
chatting with both your hardware vendor and your carrier sales agent today.
To service the new employees, new departments, and changing requirements
of the company, you may need to upgrade your phone system, add more
phone lines, install dedicated circuits, or possibly start over with a brand-
new phone system (if your current system has no room left for expansion). 
20
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

When you’re ready to make changes to your system, and after you’ve estab-
lished a relationship with your carrier sales agent or independent sales rep,
as well as with your hardware vendor, you need to bring everyone together at
your office for a chat so that you can determine the best strategy for chang-
ing your phone service to respond to your business’s growth.
Having a conversation with your hardware vendor is very simple. Your ques-
tions are:
 How many more telephones can I install on my system as it is right now?
 How many more lines can my system handle from the carrier as it is
right now?
 If I buy additional cards for my current phone system, how many phones
for employees can I add before I max out the system? 
 How long does it take to receive and install the new cards? 
 How much do cards cost to buy and install? Are there any other fees I
should know about?
 What are my options when I have no more capacity on the existing
phone system?
Getting answers to these questions gives you a sense for the system’s current
limitations, a rough timeline for adding capacity to your system, and the gen-
eral cost for the various upgrade options. 
On the carrier side, the questions are even fewer. If you are adding individual
phone lines, you need to contact your local carrier to find out the installation
and monthly cost to add lines, as well as the standard interval to have the
lines brought to your phone room and installed. If you’re adding dedicated
service from your long-distance carrier, your questions are essentially the
same. The basic information you need has to do with 
 Timelines for installing new circuits.
 Charges, both monthly recurring charges (MRCs) and installation charges
and other one-time costs (also known as nonrecurring charges — NRCs). 
When you have all the information you need, you can plan accordingly so
that expansion is methodical and planned, as opposed to being anxiety
ridden and reactionary. The specific charges associated with dedicated cir-
cuits are covered in Chapter 2.

Chapter 1: A Buyer’s Scoop on Telecom

Troubleshooting All Things Telecom
There are three groups of telecom people you need to have on your speed
dial before you have a crisis. These are the individuals who troubleshoot and
repair your phone system problems when you cannot dial out, have static on
the line, are dealing with echo (echo, echo), or any issue that prevents you
from completing a call. Although I offer extensive troubleshooting informa-
tion in this book that you can use to isolate problems, you still need the right
company to correct problems. These are not DIY tasks. Be prepared to call
the following individuals:
 The customer care center for your long-distance carrier(s): These people
can help you troubleshoot and repair anything that is the responsibility 
of your long-distance carrier. Not every problem belongs to your long-
distance carrier, but when you identify a long-distance telecom issue, you
need to call the long-distance carrier. In the event of a serious problem,
keep a full phone list that escalates all the way to the vice-president level.
Nothing feels worse than having a contact number for the lowest end of
the support spectrum, and no way to escalate. 
 The trouble reporting center for your local carrier: Generally, you can
reach this office by dialing 611 from your phone, but if your phone lines
are completely out, you may have to use a cellphone. Unfortunately, dial-
ing 611 from your cellphone won’t do you any good at all. Instead, find
the customer service number on an old phone bill or search the Web for
the customer service number, and keep the number handy. As with your
long-distance carrier, have an escalating list of phone numbers so that if
you don’t receive immediate resolution you can talk to someone with
more authority.
 The service number for your hardware vendor: Keep the number of
your hardware vendor close at hand. Sometimes phone issues are hard-
ware related, and in those situations, your long-distance or local carrier
can do nothing to resolve them.

T
he good news about the world of telecom is that it is always changing.
The other good news about telecom is that it stays the same. You can buy
a cellphone right now that can surf the Internet, access your e-mail, and send
pictures and video. You can also buy a vintage rotary-dial phone from 1935,
plug it into the wall jack in your house, and it will work just as well as the day
it was built. So even though telecom is in a constant state of expansion, the
continuity enables almost every era of the technology to remain in use today.
As new services are released, they fit within the existing infrastructure, but
never replace it. 
An old phone system is not necessarily worthless, and a new system is not
always mandatory. The changes you make to your telecom system depend on
your company’s needs. As carriers roll out more services, you may find your-
self overwhelmed by all the hardware and service choices that appear on
your invoice, and the basic tenets of how to decide what to do next. Don’t
worry. This chapter gives you an understanding to deal with all of it.

24
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 
Analyzing How Many Phone 
Lines You Need
Your decision about the number of phone lines your business needs will vary
based on the specific profile of your company. Don’t be snowed into believing
that you need one line for every employee. On the other hand, you shouldn’t
cut corners. Here are a couple of scenarios to help you understand what you
should consider in your decision:
 Tons of employees in the field: Say you run a construction company
with 50 employees. Four of your employees work in the office and the
rest of the crew is out on job sites. You don’t need 50 phone lines. You
might purchase four lines for your in-house employees, one spare line
for employees to pick up voicemail, and a line or two for your fax
machines and be fine. You can noodle around with the configuration if
you want. Maybe your construction company is very busy. You may
need three or four lines for faxes. 
 Tons of calls coming in and going out all day: You own a telemarketing
company with 25 people who make calls 8 hours a day. Your employees
also need to connect customers to a conference call with a verification
service. You may need 35 or 40 lines just for the calls your employees
make, and then 2 lines for faxes. 
As a basic rule, you should have one phone line for every employee who
makes calls in your office — up to about 15 employees. If you have more than
15 employees, the least expensive option is to jump to a dedicated circuit
that contains 24 phone lines. See the section later in this chapter, called,
“Deciding whether to Get Dedicated or Stay Switched.”
If your business is growing, here’s an interesting fact. You will need fewer
lines per employee as you increase the number of employees in a standard
office environment, not because employees will make and receive fewer calls
(you can expect that they’ll probably make more calls), but because the sta-
tistical probability that everyone will be on the phone at the exact same time
is pretty slim. You face a greater likelihood that one person will be hanging
up and doing work as someone else picks up the phone to start another call.
To get a handle on your business’s actual call volume, you could pore over
the itemized list of your phone calls to calculate the total number of calls
active during peak times. Have fun — not! A more realistic exercise is to scan
your phone bill and determine whether every phone number is being used. If
you have several phone numbers that are not designated as inbound faxes or
are lines for your security system and they have no usage, you probably have
too many lines. 

On the other side of the equation, if anyone (customers, employees, associ-
ates) ever complains of hearing a recording from the phone system that says
that the “service is unavailable,” you probably need to open some more lines.
Before you run out and buy a bunch of new phone lines, first ensure that the
bottleneck in your phone system isn’t caused by another problem (maybe a
card failed and you lost ten lines in your phone system because of it). 
After validating your hardware, order additional lines to match the number of
people affected by the shortage of lines. The Human Resources department
may have hired on 20 more people you didn’t even know about. If 10 people
in your office can’t get outside lines during peak times, order 12 more lines.
Locating Your Phone System: 
What’s in Your Closet?
Before you can maintain, upgrade, or replace your phone system, you need to
find it. If you are in charge of the phones in your office, take a field trip to get
to know your phone system. Or talk to the hardware vendor that takes care
of your phone system and find out where the system lives. 
Phone systems are generally shoehorned into a small broom closet some-
where in the office, or possibly even farther afield. You should know how to
get to the phone closet by using the most direct route possible in the event of
a telecommunications crisis. If you have a larger company, the phone system
may even be sitting comfortably in a corner of the room that houses the com-
pany’s computer servers. 
If nobody has any clue where your phone system is stashed, you need to
follow the cabling from your phone to the point where it meets up with all 
the other phone lines and becomes an indistinguishable mass of wires. That
mass ties into a large panel or a large plastic or metal box with pretty green
and yellow lights flashing on it. When you see this, you have probably arrived
at your phone closet.
Phone rooms are frequently locked to prevent corporate espionage or some-
one from backing up into the wiring blocks with a wrench, taking out ten
people’s lines in the process. If your company does lock the phone closet,
make sure you know where the key is so that you won’t be scrambling when
you need to get into it to check things out.

Chapter 2: Making (And Living with) Telecom Decisions

Putting a Name with a Face: 
Identifying Your System
Before you can do much, you need to determine the type of phone system
you have. Fortunately for all of us, there are only a handful of types of phone
systems. Each type is easy to identify by its features and requirements. The
following sections give you the lowdown on the pros and cons of each type.
No phone system
The bottom end of the food chain is to not have a phone system at all. Small
businesses that only have one or two lines, but no central room that pulls all
the phone lines into a control box of any kind, have no phone system. If you
follow your phone lines across the wall, eventually they pass through the wall
to a gray or brown metal box outside the building, and then off to a telephone
pole. 
If you have no system, the phone on your desk, whether it’s a single-line
phone or a multiple-line phone, has the same phone number. If someone is on
line one, everyone else can see it lit and knows not to push that button and
start dialing. These phones are simple to use and you do not generally have
to dial 9 for an outside line.
Pros
The greatest thing about not having a phone system is that if anyone ever 
has a problem dialing out, there is a 99 percent chance that the problem has
nothing to do with you. This fact makes troubleshooting problems a breeze.
Simply plug in a phone that you know works into a jack that you suspect is
bad. If you still can’t dial out, you now move to 99.999 percent certainty that
the problem has nothing to do with your phones. Having no system involves
the least hassle and lowest maintenance cost.
If you decide to upgrade at any time, you don’t have to worry about the limi-
tations of your existing system or the money you have already invested in it,
because you don’t have an existing system and have made no investment. It
is financially and technically easier to start from scratch, installing a brand-
new system, than having to deal with limitations of an outdated and costly
system that can’t be expanded any more. 
Cons
If you lack a phone system, you either have to rely on an answering machine
to take your messages or sign up for a voicemail service provided by your
local carrier. If your business is more of a hobby, or has a Bohemian twist to
26
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

it, that may be fine, but you need to have a voicemail service of some sort if
you want to project a professional image. Along with the lack of voicemail,
you may not have conference call or call-forwarding services (call forwarding
can be great, especially after hours). Many local carries do offer packages
that include voicemail, conference calling, and call-forwarding services.
Your decision
If you’re reading this book, chances are you’re ready to upgrade to a phone
system. If you’re still on the fence, ask yourself whether you plan to add two
more employees in the next six months. Now think about whether you will
add employees in the next five years. The next ten years? Do you need a pro-
fessional phone image so that potential customers get the impression that
your business is larger?
Centrex or Centranet
If you don’t have a phone system and you don’t want to pay to buy and main-
tain one, you do have an option. Most local carriers have a business service
option. The Baby Bell companies like Bell Atlantic or Pacific Bell call the ser-
vice Centrex. Verizon calls its service Centranet. Whatever it’s called, the
product is essentially the same.
The local carrier offers Centrex (or Centranet) lines that enable the features
of a phone system without all the hassle of having one. You probably have 
to dial 9 for an outside line, you can have voicemail, conference calling up to
two calls, and a whole list of other features that you may never need or want.
If you are concerned about projecting a professional business image, but do
not want to pay for a phone system, this option may be your best bet.
Pros
You don’t have to buy any additional hardware and you can pick and choose
the features you want and will use. These services also prevent you from
having to buy and maintain hardware. Local carriers usually start businesses
out with at least three phone lines, and reserve four or five more lines so that
you can quickly add new numbers if you decide you need more. If your main
line ends in -3450, and you have -3451, -3452 and -3453, you will probably have
-3454, -3455, and -3456 waiting in the wings for you to activate when you need
them. Because the numbers are already on reserve for you, it makes it easy
to quickly add more lines in your office.
Cons
As your company grows, you will need more services. Eventually, you will
want the hardware in your building so that you can repair and modify the
system yourself. Paying your local carrier for the services every month will
eventually be more expensive than buying a phone system and providing
27
Chapter 2: Making (And Living with) Telecom Decisions

them yourself. Installing a phone system allows you to select as many fea-
tures as you like and only pay for them once.
Your decision
If you don’t believe that you will ever have more than 15 employees, and you
really hate to deal with phone systems, stick with Centrex or Centranet ser-
vice. If your business bounces up and you double in size, you can always buy
a phone system without losing money on incompatible hardware. Eventually,
you will need to bite the bullet and make the jump to a phone system because
the cost of paying for individual phone lines and Centrex/Centranet features is
higher than buying a system and getting a dedicated circuit.
The key system
If you have a key system, you have a phone closet with a metal or plastic box
in it that all the phone lines in your office connect into. One feature that iden-
tifies a key system is that you don’t need to dial 9 for an outside line. Some
larger non-key systems dial the 9 for you with a feature called assumed dial 9,
but the key system is the only one that doesn’t require it at all. 
Although key systems may have features like voicemail and conference call-
ing, they’re still fairly basic systems. 
28
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 
Old phone systems don’t die; they just get resold
If you’re buying your first phone system or
replacing an existing phone system, your hard-
ware vendor can help reduce costs. The tech-
nology won’t be cutting edge, but then again,
you may not need a system that can scale up to
672 phone lines. If you don’t foresee that you will
ever grow to need more than 48 lines, your
hardware vendor may have a used or refur-
bished system that works just fine for you.
Before you buy a used or refurbished system,
you need to ensure the following:
 The hardware vendor can and will maintain
the system.
 You can still easily purchase parts for the
system.
 The expansion cards or the phones that con-
nect into it (yes, you may have to buy new
phones) don’t cost so much that buying new
phones is cheaper.
Along the same line, if you are completely replac-
ing your phone system, call your phone vendor to
see whether you can trade in your old system. For
every business moving to a 200-station system,
there is some little start-up in need of a system for
20 people. Your hardware vendor may be able to
help you sell your old system, or may buy it from
you for a fraction of what you paid for it (but still
more than you would get if you threw it away). If
you can buy a system for half the retail cost and
sell it for a third of what you paid for it, that’s smart
business.

Key systems, as well as all telephones, phone systems, and wiring that reside
at your office are referred to as Customer Premise Equipment or CPE. The term
CPE may be thrown around when you are chatting with your local or long-
distance carrier, so don’t let it shake you. The term refers to the hardware at
your building that you are responsible for. This is generally the last piece of
hardware that is thoroughly worked through when troubleshooting an issue.
When you hear the sentence, “Everything is clean here; we have isolated the
issue to your CPE,” that means you need to call out your hardware vendor to
test your phone system.
If you have a key system, the dial tone you hear when you pick up a line is
sent to you directly from your local carrier. If you ever have a problem with
your phones (say you pick up the handset and you hear nothing but dead
air), the issue is probably caused by your local carrier.
Pros
You own your own phone system and don’t have to wait for anyone else to
repair your issues on their timetable. 
The main benefit of a key system is that it enables the telephone at your desk
to access a larger pool of phone lines. If you have a three-line telephone with-
out a key system that goes directly to your local carrier, you can only access
the three lines plugged directly into that phone. If the lines in your stand-
alone three-line phone are 206-XXX-1200, -1201, and -1202, for example, you
can’t receive a call on that phone from someone calling on line -1204. 
A key system enables you to access all the phone lines for your company. You
can program the key system to automatically route a received call to an opera-
tor phone or directly to a desk. Calls can also be transferred between phones
connected to the key system, freeing up the initial phone that transferred it 
to receive another call. Even a small key system enables you to manage more
lines and have increased functionality when compared to multiple-line phones
used without a phone system. Owning your own key system prevents you
from paying a monthly charge for Centrex or Centranet features.
Cons
Key systems are generally not very robust and may not have all the features
you require. If you want to set up elaborate time-of-day routing features to
automatically route calls to voicemail after hours, or if you want to have large-
party conference calling, you may not get what you need from a key system.
Because key systems are on the lower end of the telecom spectrum, you may
not have a ton of room for expansion before you end up having to upgrade to
a larger system. 
29
Chapter 2: Making (And Living with) Telecom Decisions

Your decision
Take a look at your business and try to determine how many more phone
lines you will need in the next 12 months, 5 years, and 10 years. When you
have a rough idea of your needs, call your hardware vendor for a consulta-
tion. If your return on investment is more than six months, you may want to
look for other options. If you suddenly hit an unexpected growth spurt and
are forced into a larger system, you may have enough revenue coming in to
buy that new phone system you really want.
The Post Branch Exchange: PBX
A Post Branch Exchange is more robust than a key system and can handle any
quantity of phone lines. You can drop in 24 phone lines, or 672, or more. It
really doesn’t pay to use a PBX for fewer than 24 phone lines unless you love
to buy high-tech gadgets with more features than you will use. The most dis-
tinctive feature of a PBX system is that you have to dial 9 for an outside line.
PBX systems also have more functions available in them than the average key
system. 
You may be able to connect phone lines from different carriers into the system
and have the PBX choose which carrier to send each call to depending on the
area code and phone number being dialing. If you have a better international
rate on your MCI line, for example, you can have calls that start with 011 sent
over your MCI lines. If your cost for calls in state is lower through AT&T, you
can program all the area codes in your state into the PBX system so that those
calls are sent over your AT&T lines. This feature is actually called least cost
routing (LCR) and can be built into some phone systems. Talk to your hard-
ware vendor if you think your company can use LCR.
Pros
PBX systems have features that may be desirable for your office for one
reason or another. Aside from the usual LCR features, routing features, voice-
mail and three-way calling, your PBX system may also be able to use account
codes or call blocking features:
 Account codes: Have you ever wanted to know who in your office made
a specific call? Have you ever wanted to track the calls you make on
behalf of a specific client or project? Well, some PBX systems enable 
you to do it. The system prompts you for a code whenever you dial out.
Generally, the code is a two- to four-digit number that the PBX stores 
in its memory so you can run a report later. If everyone in the Sales
Department uses the 2211 code when they dial out, you can group all 
of their calls to see where they are focusing their efforts. If you are an
30
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

attorney and bill your clients for all expenses on their case, you can
easily assign a code for each client and tally up the total you need to
tack onto the bill at the end of the month. This feature is quite popular,
and if your PBX system doesn’t supply it, your local or long-distance car-
riers probably offer similar services.
 Call blocking: With this feature, you can use the LCR feature to route
outgoing calls to a dead line. For example, if someone dials a number in
the 900 or 976 area codes, you can block the calls from being completed.
Local carriers offer 900 and 976 blocking, as well as international block-
ing, but this may not be enough protection for you. Your company may
also want to prevent people from dialing the 1010 codes advertised on
TV for the dime-a-minute rate, or you may want to block outbound call-
ing to countries like Canada or the Caribbean, which aren’t covered in a
standard international block offered by your local carrier.
International blocks placed on your service by either a local or long-distance
carrier only cover calls that are preceded with 011. This standard interna-
tional block works fine if you are trying to prevent calls being made to places
like Europe, Asia, and South America. If you want to block all calls made to
anyplace other than the 50 U.S. states, you need to install additional safe-
guards in your PBX system. Countries like Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam,
Jamaica, Barbados and most of the Caribbean can be reached by just dialing
1 and the area code for the country.
Cons
PBX systems may be very costly. The specific telephones that are required to
work with them also cost a pretty penny. Also, expansion can be very costly,
and finding parts or qualified service technicians for older models isn’t
always a snap.
Another consideration is that if you have a PBX system, the dial tone you
hear is generated by your phone system. If your building loses power and
you have a PBX system, all the phone lines that feed into the PBX system go
down. Unless you have a battery-backup system on your phone system, you
can’t accept calls or dial out until the power returns and your PBX system
has the time to boot up. 
The solution to this problem is to keep a cheap, single-line phone in the office
and ensure that you have at least one phone line that doesn’t go through
your PBX. Your fax line doesn’t need to access voicemail or transfer calls, so
it makes a great candidate for doing double duty. Simply plug that single-line
phone into your fax line and at least make calls outbound until the power
returns.

Your decision
If you’re looking to buy a PBX system or want to upgrade your existing PBX
unit, call a few hardware vendors for feedback. Your vendor may have a
sweet spot in his heart for the make and model you own, but everyone else
might see it as an expensive and brittle dinosaur. Before you go and throw
down $15,000 or more on a PBX system and the accompanying phones, do
some research and ensure that it matches your growth projections for the
near and long term.
Multiplexers
A multiplexer is a device that receives a dedicated circuit from your carrier
and breaks the circuit into individual lines that you can use to send to your
desk phones.
In simpler terms, your carrier will charge you less to pull one fat cable into
your building than it charges to pull 24 regular-sized phone lines. When the
fat cable is in your office, you need a piece of hardware to break it down into
24 smaller lines that you can actually use. Multiplexers (also called MUXes or
channel banks) are identified by the size of circuit they receive in from your
carrier, and can vary from a single T-1 with 24 phone lines to a DS-3 with 672
phone lines. Some multiplexers handle circuits that contain thousands or
tens of thousands of phone lines.
A multiplexer is a piece of hardware you may have in addition to your phone
system. The MUX doesn’t have any three-way calling features or voicemail; all
it does is break down the dedicated circuit into phone lines. Any features that
you need on your phones are still supplied by your PBX. 
Pros
You can now use a dedicated circuit and save on the monthly charge to bring
in all those individual phone lines. (See the section, “Making the final cost
comparison,” later in this chapter.)

Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 
Test-driving a hybrid
In telecom parlance, a hybrid isn’t an awkward-
looking car that runs on both gas and electricity.
But it is a combination of two systems. Hybrid
phone systems merge together the functionality
of a key system and a PBX system. Companies
that don’t want to make the jump to a full PBX,
because of either the cost or complexity, but
want the luxury of dialing 9 before every call, can
buy a hybrid and get the best of both worlds. 

Cons
The MUX is one of the first pieces of hardware into which your dedicated cir-
cuit connects. It is a potential point of failure that can take down all service
riding through it if either the dedicated circuit or the MUX crashes. Without
the MUX, you can’t access any of the individual phone lines from your dedi-
cated circuit, and all the phone service provided on the dedicated circuit is
lost.
Your decision
Do you go dedicated or stay switched? To find out the answer, you have to
crunch the numbers. Keep reading.
Getting the Least You Need to Know
about Your Phone System
You should have enough information about your phone system so that you
can perform basic troubleshooting functions. The more you know, the fewer
the crisis situations you’ll face. You don’t want to have to call out your hard-
ware vendor and pay the hourly rate of a Ferrari mechanic for some minor
issue. Instead, invite the tech to visit once, and take very good notes in the
following areas:
 What are the different devices in the phone closet and what do they do?
 How do you power up and power down each of the devices in the phone
closet? What is the worst thing that can happen if you suddenly turn on
or off the devices in the phone closet? Perhaps a sudden power outage
returns all the settings to the factory default, which means that you have
to reprogram everything!
 What does turning one piece of hardware off and back on do to the rest
of the system? Is there a certain sequence for rebooting devices in the
system?
 What do the lights on the equipment mean? You probably see green,
yellow, red, and possibly blue lights on telecom equipment. A brief
course in what red lights flashing on the channel bank mean will go a
long way in shortening your troubleshooting.
 Is there a button on the channel service unit (CSU) or phone system that
you can push to generate a loop on the system? You really don’t even
need to know what a loop is; just note the button you need to push to
make it happen. I cover loops in great detail in Chapter 14.
33
Chapter 2: Making (And Living with) Telecom Decisions

Deciding whether to Get Dedicated 
or Stay Switched
The one decision in telecom that can impact your bottom line the quickest is
the decision to replace some of your regular business lines from your local
carrier with a single, large dedicated circuit from your long-distance carrier.
This decision has such a profound impact on your phone bill because the
per-minute rate for calls on a dedicated circuit may make up half the price
you are currently paying for regular phone lines. 
Understanding switched system costs
In order to make the comparison easy to understand, here’s a look at the
standard costs you can expect to pay to set up a switched (that is regular)
phone system. For the purpose of comparison, I assume that you have 24
phone lines and already have a phone system that can receive calls from a
dedicated circuit and are adding one piece of hardware (either a free-stand-
ing multiplexer or a multiplexer card). To add phone lines to an existing
phone system that meet these criteria, you can expect to pay the following
charges:
 A monthly recurring charge of approximately $35 per phone line:
This is your standard monthly invoice that comes from your local car-
rier for the 24 phone lines. Any additional services on the line would, of
course, cost extra. For now, I assume that all the enhanced features you
need are going to be taken care of by your on-site phone system. Check
your local carrier’s Web site or talk to a friendly customer service rep 
to get exact pricing. The monthly recurring charge for the 24 phone lines
is $840.
 A per-line installation fee of approximately $100 (one-time fee): Your
local carrier is going to run wires to your office and drop them in your
phone room, and that means you’re going to pay a charge for that work.
This fee could be waived, slightly less, or considerably more, depending
on your local carrier and the type of phone lines that you buy. Your
budget should be about $2,400 for installation of 24 lines.
Verify the cost of installation with your local carrier before this work is
done!
 Your per-minute cost multiplied by the average number of minutes
you talk every month: A small business with good activity may use an
average of 40,000 minutes per month, so I use that number as the base-
line in this example. For the sake of simplicity, I also estimate that you
are paying an average of five cents per minute for your calls. You should
34
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

check your current long-distance contract or just divide the total cost by
total minutes on your invoice to get your true estimate of the blended
cost per minute. The minutes and the cost per minute give you an
expected average of $2,000.
 PICC fee: The primary interexchange carrier charge, or PICC fee, is a gov-
ernment tariff that is assessed to business and residential phone lines.
The charge is applied on a per-line basis and can vary from $1.25 per
line for residential lines to $4.75 per line for some business lines. Every
local carrier has its own rate schedule, so I can’t give you a fair sense of
the standard rate. You have to research this fee on your phone bill and
apply the correct amount when you calculate the cost. For the sake of
this example and for ease of calculation, I am making the PICC fee a flat
$2 per line per month; so if you have 24 lines, that’s an extra $48 per
month.
Aside from these charges, the regular taxes you pay remain a fixed percent-
age of your usage. You may incur some additional maintenance fees for the
hardware you need to buy, but as long as you buy quality equipment, it
should be negligible in the overall scheme of things.
Understanding dedicated system costs
The costs you incur to install one dedicated circuit (such as a T-1 line) to
replace the 24 phone lines of a switched system consist of the following:
 Monthly cost for the dedicated circuit: In order to get those rock-
bottom prices for long distance, you need to be directly connected to
your long-distance carrier’s network. Your long-distance carrier proba-
bly doesn’t live next door to you, and the monthly cost of your dedi-
cated circuit is based on how many miles of wiring needs to be used to
get to you. The cost of the access varies from about $150 if you are a few
miles away to possibly as much as $5,000 per month if you live far away
from civilization. On the whole, a common access fee, commonly called
a local loop fee, for the circuit is about $250 per month.
You need to request a quote for the cost of this connection from your
long-distance carrier. Simply provide your phone number and address 
to your long-distance carrier.
 Installation cost for the dedicated circuit (one-time fee): The copper
wires that you rent from your long-distance carrier have to be designed,
assembled, and manually connected. Sounds expensive, doesn’t it? It is,
and guess what! The cost is rolled up and passed on to your business in
the form of an installation fee. The installation costs vary from carrier to
carrier, but on average they run about $1,250 per dedicated circuit. 
35
Chapter 2: Making (And Living with) Telecom Decisions

 Additional hardware required (one-time fee): The installation of a dedi-
cated circuit requires you to purchase a multiplexer and a device called
a channel service unit (CSU) that boosts the signal on your dedicated cir-
cuit and acts as a testing device. Chat with your hardware vendor to find
a good deal on this hardware and to ensure that it’s compatible with
your existing phone system. If you’re lucky, all you need to do is buy a
special card for your phone system — everything else is automatically
taken care of. Multiplexers range greatly in price from $5,000 to $6,000
for a Coastcom brand channel bank set up for voice calls, to a less
expensive Carrier Access channel bank (you can find those on eBay for 
a Buy It Now price of $300). Whatever you buy, ensure that you have a
hardware vendor who can install it and will service it. For this example, 
I assume that you got a good deal on a used multiplexer and had to pay
only $1,500.
 Installation and programming of new hardware: When you buy the
hardware, you still have to contract a hardware vendor to install it. As
an average cost, I estimate that you’ll spend $450 to install, test, and
turn on the new equipment.
Get a quote before you hire a company to do this work.
 Your dedicated rate per minute: I am giving a conservative estimate on
this one by saying that you will be charged 2.5 cents per minute for out-
bound calls on your dedicated circuit with the exact same call volume of
40,000 minutes per month.
Making the final cost comparison
Table 2-1 includes all the charges I’ve mentioned in the previous section,
listed as either monthly charges or installation fees. For example, in the first
and second columns, I show what you will pay for switched service. In the
third and fourth columns, I list the monthly charges and installation fees for 
a dedicated circuit.

After reviewing the two sides of the chart, you can see that adding a dedi-
cated circuit costs $800 more to install than a switched system, but saves
$1,638 every month in fees. In my example, the answer is simple; you can
eventually recover the additional up-front cost in the very first month and
still end up saving $838. The decision to move to a dedicated circuit is still a
good idea even if you won’t recover your upfront costs until six months after
installation. If you won’t reach a break-even point for a year or so, you may
decide to stick with what you have. 
Dedicated circuits are available in packages of 24 phone lines called a T-1 or
DS-1, but it may be financially advantageous to order a T-1 line even if you
use fewer than 24 switched lines. There is generally a break-even point at
about 17 phone lines where it is better to buy a T-1 line than to stick with 
a switched system. Of course, every business scenario is different, so you
should enter all the relevant information into Table 2-1 to see what works 
for your company.
Understanding and Preventing Fraud
The intent of telecom fraud is to gain access to a long-distance carrier’s net-
work by using your connection. After a fraudulent company is on the inside,
it sells minutes to people at a discounted rate. The scenario is generally a
call-sell operation. In this scenario, anyone on the street can pay $20 to call
anywhere in the world for as long as they want. Because the person giving
access to the call isn’t paying for it, any money received is pure profit. There
are many types of telecom fraud that can affect your business, but two vari-
eties are more common and more costly than all the others. 
Fraud is a concern in all aspects of life, but in the realm of telecom, a single
episode can quickly cost you tens — or hundreds of thousands of dollars. No
joke! The worst aspect of fraud is that even if nobody in your company made
the illegal calls, you still have a legal obligation to pay for them. When you
alert your carrier to the fact that your phone system or calling cards have
been compromised, the carrier can help you identify and stop the current
37
Chapter 2: Making (And Living with) Telecom Decisions

breach, but it has no obligation to credit you any money for the calls you
claim are fraudulent. Any financial leniency you are given by a carrier is a
professional courtesy unless your carrier has offered fraud protection within
your contract for service. Always check your phone bill for international
calls, because they are the largest targets for people committing fraud.
Finding international calls to countries you can’t find on a map at hours 
you are not even open for business is a huge red flag. 
Stopping PBX hacks
As you read this, people all over the world are dialing toll-free numbers with
their computers. When the toll-free number connects to a phone system, it
begins hacking around to see whether it can access an outside line. If it can
access an outside line, the computer then makes a test call to an international
phone number. If the call completes fine, the series of codes and prompts
used to access the outside line is recorded and sold on the streets by garden-
variety thieves and organized criminals. This process of connecting into your
phone system by way of a toll-free number and then dialing out is called PBX
hacking.
The first thing to do to prevent your PBX system from being hacked is to
eliminate your phone system’s ability to reoriginate dial tone. That is, you
want to prevent a scenario in which you receive an inbound toll-free call that
can seize an outside line and receive dial tone. Obviously, accepting incoming
calls is fine, but you don’t want an inbound call to find its way to a dial tone. 
If it’s impossible to dial out of your system after a toll-free number accesses
the system, you’re in pretty good shape. Before the widespread use of cell-
phones, re-originating dial tone from a phone system was a great feature 
used by sales staff while on the road. They could use a special company 800
number to call in for messages, and then press a code to dial out and return
their calls — all without having to rack up expensive long-distance charges.
But nowadays you have better options, such as using company-distributed
mobile phones.
I strongly advise that you hunt down the toll-free dial tone reorigination
option in your phone system and disable it. If you absolutely must keep it, at
least have your phone system block international calls. The real money in
telecom fraud is when you can sell minutes to locations that are expensive to
call. Nobody is going to pay you $20 to talk to Mom in South Carolina, where
the rate is usually about 7 cents a minute. The real market for telecom fraud
is for people who want to call friends, relatives, and business associates in
Afghanistan or the Kuala Lumpur, where the cost may be $2 per minute.
38
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

Cracking down on calling card fraud
Calling cards are being used less and less because mobile phones are now
widely available at a low cost. However, calling cards are still a major source
of fraud. The calling cards I am talking about are not the prepaid calling cards
that you buy at the convenience store when you are traveling; I am speaking
about the calling cards you receive from your local or long-distance carrier.
Prepaid calling cards are set up to only allow a fixed amount of usage before
they are disabled, so there isn’t much fraud exposure with them. For exam-
ple, if you use a prepaid card to make a call in a phone booth and you acci-
dentally leave the card in the booth, you lose the amount of money left on 
the card — no more, no less. 
The calling cards that you receive from your long-distance carrier, on the
other hand, have a preset limit based on a daily balance, weekly balance, or
monthly balance. If the credit limit is set at $100 per day, you have a potential
$3,000 exposure per month on that card if the wrong person gets his or her
hands onto it. Most people do not use their calling cards very often and you
may not notice that the card has been compromised until two months later
when your carrier generates an invoice and mails it to you. 
Calling cards used for fraud are acquired in many ways. The most common way
that calling card information is gathered is at airports with a little trick called
shoulder surfing. Shoulder surfing is a technique whereby someone looks over
your shoulder at a pay phone and makes note of the toll-free access number 
for your calling card platform and your PIN number. The person watching you
may be in the next phone booth over or on an observation deck with a pair of
binoculars, calling off the numbers to a partner who writes them down. Some
criminals are more ingenious and place tape recorders under pay phones to
record the sound of the digits you dial, and disreputable hotel staff may record
the same information as you call from your room and it is processed through
the hotel phone system. Regardless of how the information is gathered, your
card information is then either sold on the street until your card’s limit is hit 
or it is used by career criminals to cover their tracks and make phone calls to
people they do not want to be linked to.
This fraudulent activity can add up to be quite a bit of money rather quickly.
Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself from calling card fraud:
 Call your carrier and find out the credit limit and term on your calling
card. Is it a set amount per day, week, or month?
 Have the limit set at $50 per month. Most people with calling cards make
between $15 and $25 in calls per month, so this $50 shouldn’t leave you
stuck without any minutes when you need them most. 
39
Chapter 2: Making (And Living with) Telecom Decisions

 Figure out how to quickly raise the credit limit on your calling card in
the event of an emergency. The moment you need to raise the limit on
your card will probably be a stressful one, so you should know your
expectation level before you have to make the call. If you are at the hos-
pital because your wife is having a baby, or someone was in an accident
and you need to call people from the lobby phone, you will need the
limit raised in a very short amount of time and as painlessly as possible.
Calls from your calling cards are charged a higher per-minute rate than calls
from your home or office. In fact, the rates you’re charged may be two or
three times what you would pay if you call the same place from your office.
Check your rates before you go on that long trip to avoid an unpleasant sur-
prise when you get your next invoice.
Negotiating the Best Telecom Deal
The one constant in the world of telecom is that everything is negotiable. If
you plan to spend $100,000 in usage every month, you can probably press 
to get installation fees, as well as small monthly recurring charges, waived.
Thousands of carriers out there want your business, so check out a handful
of them to see what kind of a bidding war you can start. Here are some tips 
to help you on your way to finding the right telecom fit for your company.
Getting the timing right
The landscape of telecom has been getting more and more competitive, with
rates dropping, so don’t get stuck in a lifetime commitment. Opt for a con-
tract that lasts only 12 months. With that in mind, the best time to start look-
ing at a new carrier is probably about eight months before your contract is
up. That may seem like a lot of time to kill, but investigating a new carrier and
determining whether it has the pricing, service, and support that you require
can take a bit of time. 
If you have dedicated circuits, it will take almost two months to install the
replacement circuits on the new carrier. It will also take a month or two to
work through the wording and negotiate the contracts. This is especially true
if you are a busy company and cannot devote all the required personnel in
your company to focus on this one task. The four months it takes to actually
make the move to activate service is probably the same amount of time you
will spend looking at new companies and weeding them down to the one that
interests you. 
40
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

Of course, these are ballpark time frames that can vary quite a bit. The point
is to allow more (not less) time. If your company is growing and has little time
to meet on issues like this, it may take eight months to get everyone together
who has to approve the change to meet enough to make a decision. You could
also be in a remote location where dedicated circuits may take three months
to install. You will have to crunch the numbers and see whether the savings
are worth the effort. If you are only looking at a $200 savings per month on a
$5,000 bill you can probably renegotiate that with your existing carrier. If it is 
a $10,000 savings on a $120,000 monthly invoice, you will probably want to
pursue the new carrier.
Dealing with least cost routing 
over several carriers
If your company is large and can use several dedicated circuits, you can max-
imize your savings by adding on more long-distance carriers. The wonderful
thing about long-distance carriers is the fact that they are like snow flakes; no
two are exactly the same. 
This rule also applies to their pricing plans. Every carrier has areas in the
U.S. and internationally where calls are inexpensive and other areas where
they are not so competitive. If you currently have two or three dedicated cir-
cuits and a good phone system, you can build a least cost routing (LCR) table
into it that identifies which carrier has the best rate. Then route those calls
by using the appropriate carrier. There are two main things to bear in mind
when you are going to activate an additional carrier to use in this kind of
routing:
 Make sure you will meet your commitment levels on the old carrier.
Most long-distance contracts for dedicated service give you a great per-
minute rate, but they require a monthly minimum usage from you. After
a ramp-up period of 30 or 60 days, you have to bill out $2,000 in usage 
per month to get your 2.5 cents per minute rate to Texas (or wherever).
If you don’t make enough calls, something bad might happen. 
Carriers don’t make a habit of charging shortfalls, but shortfalls could
invalidate your contract. The carrier is within its rights to assess the
shortfall to your company or raise your rates. If you bring in a second
carrier to save some money on your international calls as well as select
areas in the U.S., you need to be sure that when that traffic is moved,
you can still hit your commitment level with your primary carrier. Can
you imagine telling your employees to make more calls?
41
Chapter 2: Making (And Living with) Telecom Decisions

 Ensure that you set up the LCR table correctly. Long-distance carriers
have many different breakouts for pricing. Some may charge you a flat
rate for all calls within your state, and another flat rate for all calls out of
state. Regardless of where you dial, what time of day you dial, what day
of the week you dial, and so on, the rate is always the same. Other carri-
ers may break down the pricing per state, or base it upon smaller geo-
graphic regions within each state called a Local Access Transport Area
(LATA), or even base it on the specific local carrier that receives your
call. You want to make sure that you understand the level at which each
carrier bases its rate so that you can build your LCR table accordingly.
For more information on how long-distance carriers determine the per-
minute rate, check out Chapter 6.

 Making out-of-state calls
 Making calls in outlying areas and internationally
You use terms like local call and long-distance call all the time, but you
may not know what differentiates a local call from a long-distance call.
The federal government sets strict guidelines to stipulate when a local carrier
can complete a call, and when the carrier must send it to a long-distance car-
rier. The need for these distinctions began a long time ago, when each state
was broken down into small, geographic neighborhoods called LATAs (Local
Access Transport Areas). Put simply, a LATA is the local region that makes up
local telephone service area.
When you understand how LATAs function, the rest of it comes naturally.
This chapter helps you understand the structure of the world of telecom so
that you can make informed decisions on what you need from your carrier. 

Identifying Your Telecom Neighborhood
Your telecom neighborhood is defined by the LATA, or Local Access Transport
Area, from which you’re calling. Although LATAs are regional designations,
they were initially drawn up based on total population for the geographic
area. This is the reason that states like Texas and California with higher popu-
lation densities have 10 or 15 LATAs apiece, and the entire state of Wyoming
makes up a single LATA.
Understanding the role of local carriers
and long-distance carriers in LATAs
No phone call can legally cross a LATA border unless a long-distance carrier
is handling it. Your local carrier, be it Ameritech, Bell South, or some other
company, must transfer the call to a long-distance company like MCI, Sprint,
or AT&T in order to complete the call. Figure 3-1 gives you a general idea of
how the LATAs are set up in your state.
LATAs are not area codes and don’t make up any part of a telephone number.
The geographic area of LATAs is much larger than the area covered by area
codes. In many instances, area codes exist in more than one LATA.
LATA numbering and borders
Every LATA has a specific three-digit number to make it identifiable. Say
you’re talking about calls that are failing in Oklahoma, for example. You could
ask whether the problem appears to be happening more in LATA 536 than in
LATA 538 or whether the issue is restricted to just LATA 538. LATA numbers
are generally lower in the Northeast, and the numbering increases as you
move west across the U.S. toward California. As populations explode in North
America, new LATAs are constructed. You can easily find newer LATAs
because they are all numbered in the 900s, like LATA 961 in Texas. 
LATAs generally end at the state border, but there are many LATAs that cover
more than one state. For example, half of LATA 956 is in Virginia and the other
half is in Tennessee. The LATAs are not usually spit 50-50, but it is not that
uncommon for a LATA to bleed over into a small section of a neighboring
state.

Understanding Your Call Types
The phone calls you make fall into six categories: 
 Local
 Local toll or intraLATA
 Intrastate
 Interstate
 Outlying area
 International
There is some uniformity to how the calls are grouped, but the individual car-
riers have their own ways to determine what they charge for calls within
each category.
Making a local call
Any call that terminates less than 13 miles from where it originates is gener-
ally considered a local call. These are calls that your local carrier completes
and, for residences, you may never see them individually listed on your
phone bill. The front part of your telephone directory lists area codes and
prefixes (your area code and the first three digits of a phone number) in your
local calling area. If you call any phone number with the area code and first
three digits of the phone number listed, you can rest assured you are dialing
a local number. 
46
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 
Remembering what Stevie Mnemonic 
says about inter  versus intra
Intrastate calls are local, toll, and long-distance
calls that occur within the same state. Interstate
calls are local, toll, and long-distance calls that
occur between two states. 
The prefix intra stands for within, and the prefix
inter stands for between. If you have a difficult
time remembering what is inter and what is intra,
just think of the Internet. You can hop on the
Internet and go to a Web site in South Africa,
Japan, or anywhere else in the world, because
the Internet crosses all borders. With that in mind,
any call that crosses a border is an interstate or
interLATA call, and any call that remains within
the borders is an intrastate or intraLATA call.

Your local calling area is determined by your local carrier, and only covers an
area within a 13-mile radius of you. This area doesn’t include your entire
LATA, which is how you get to make intraLATA calls.
Local calls for businesses are generally not free. The rate your business is
being charged may be a penny per minute or less, but that little pittance adds
up over time. Unless you’re using residential lines for your business, expect
to be charged for every call you make, even if you’re just calling down the
street to order pizza.
Introducing the LERG database
In case you are wondering how the local carrier can determine whether
you’re calling 13 miles or more away in about 100 milliseconds, I have a logi-
cal answer for you. The Local Exchange Routing Guide, or LERG, is a nation-
ally updated database that receives information from and sends information
to every local carrier in the U.S. 
The LERG database takes the area code, along with the first three digits of
every phone number and geographically links this data to the phone
number’s local carrier. (The combination of the area code and first three
digits of the phone number is referred to as an NPA-NXX.)
The LERG database links this data to the physical location of the office that
supplies service for that NPA-NXX. Whenever you make a phone call, your
local carrier identifies the number you are dialing, checks its copy of the
LERG database, and routes your call accordingly. 
If you want a small look at a section of the LERG, see Table 3-1. As you can
see in the table, every NPA-NXX is identified by city, state, and LATA. Each
NPA-NXX is also identified by vertical and horizontal positions that act like
GPS coordinates. The vertical and horizontal information is used by carriers
to determine the distance between phone numbers. This is how your local
carrier knows whether someone you are dialing is within the 13-mile radius
for a local call, or whether you’re placing an intraLATA call.

Making local toll calls
Calls that you make to locations more than 13 miles away, but which are still
within your LATA are called local toll calls or intraLATA calls. For years, in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, these were some of the most expensive calls you
could make. The local carriers were being forced to allow competition into
their markets and they held on to this section of telephone traffic the longest.
Most local carriers rated local toll calls by increasing the cost of a call
depending on the geographic distance between the origination and termina-
tion point, so a call that only traveled 10 miles was cheaper than one that
crossed 200 miles. Okay, that makes sense. But that local toll call to a termi-
nation point 200 miles away cost a whole lot more than the local toll call to
the next town over. How much is a whole lot more? Well, let me put it this
way: You could call London, U.K., for less than it cost you to call to the far-
thest reaches of your LATA. In the mid-1990s, all local carriers finally allowed
the option of having long-distance carriers automatically complete local toll
calls. They generally have better rates than you would receive from your
local carrier in this area, unless you are on some special promotional rate
plan.
Making an intrastate call
An intrastate call terminates within the same state it originates, but it may not
terminate within the same LATA. If you call from Dallas, Texas, to Houston,
Texas, for example, you cross out of LATA 552 without calling outside the
state of Texas.
The instant a call leaves a LATA, the call becomes a long-distance call — even
if that call begins and ends within the same state. In the eyes and ears of the
telecommunications industry, LATA borders are of greater significance than
state borders. 
48
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

Some long-distance carriers only have two general categories for pricing calls,
intrastate and interstate. If this is the case with your carrier, your intraLATA,
local toll, and intrastate calls are all charged at the same per-minute rate. The
difference between intrastate long-distance costs from state to state is amaz-
ing. States like California may have an average intrastate rate of 5 cents per
minute, but if you want to call from Miami, Florida, to Tallahassee, Florida, 
you can expect to pay about 15 cents per minute.
Making an interstate call
Any call that originates in one state and terminates in another is an interstate
call. In general, the cost for interstate calling is less than the cost of intrastate
calling.
If your main customer base is located in the same state your company is
located, you may be better off financially if you relocate your office to
another state! Making interstate calls can easily reduce your bill by up to 50
percent (and perhaps even more) of what you currently pay in intrastate
charges.
Dealing with calls to outlying areas
Most long-distance companies in the U.S. have a gray area in their rates when
it comes to interstate calls to Alaska and Hawaii. These states are frequently
not included in domestic pricing, even though they are part of the domestic
U.S. Along with Alaska and Hawaii, other U.S. principalities like the U.S. Virgin

Chapter 3: Getting Around the Telecom Neighborhood
A phone number by ANI other name . . .
In an industry that has an acronym for every-
thing, you may not be surprised to discover that
telecom community has even renamed your
phone number. Your number is not just your
number, or even your phone number, but an ANI
(pronounced either Annie or ay-enn-eye). 
ANI stands for Automatic Number Identification,
and represents the entire ten digits of your phone
number. You can use the term ANI rather than
the phone number in any conversation with a
representative at your carrier and the rep will
automatically understand that you mean phone
number. 
If you want, the next time you chat with some-
one at the phone company, just throw in the
term ANI so that the customer service agent
knows you did your research and aren’t some-
one to be trifled with.

Islands, Guam, and Puerto Rico are generally also put into this nebulous cate-
gory, although they are technically international areas. Because none of these
areas is directly attached to the lower 48 U.S. states, special carriers have to
be contracted to transport the calls over the Pacific ocean, the Caribbean
Sea, or through Canada. The markets in these areas are not large enough to
bring in competition to drive the costs down, so the carriers that service
these areas have to pay a little more overhead.
If you do business in any of the outlying areas, you should call your long-
distance carrier and confirm your rates for calls both to and from these areas.
Your outbound rate to call someone in Hilo, Hawaii, may not be that expen-
sive, but the cost for someone there to call your toll-free number could cost
your business twice as much. It is well worth making the call to prevent being
hit with hundreds of dollars more in charges than you were expecting.
Making bona fide international calls
International calls are, technically, any call that terminates in a country other
than the U.S. That being said, international calls come in two flavors, those
that you have to start with 011, and those that you dial just like they were in
the U.S.
Many countries can be reached by simply dialing 1+ area code + phone
number. Countries like Canada, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, St. Kitts, and many 
of the Caribbean nations are in the North American dialing plan. You can 
call individuals and businesses in these countries just as you call the rest 
of the U.S.
Of course, the rates are different than if you were calling domestically, but at
least you don’t need to dial 011.
Countries that are not in the North American dialing plan require you to dial:
011 + Country Code + City Code (if applicable) + phone number. There is
unfortunately no international standard for phone numbers. They could have
a one-, two-, or three-digit country code, and possibly a one-, two-, or three-
digit city code, before you get to the local phone number. Even the length of
local phone numbers varies; they have six to eight digits. For example, call
someone in the Seychelles Islands (located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast
of Africa, in case you’re not a geography whiz), you have to dial 011-248-XX-
XXXX; to call London, U.K., you have to dial three more digits, even though
the U.K. has a shorter country code and only a two-digit city code.
50
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 

You can find a comprehensive list of all the country codes in the world at
www.countrycallingcodes.com or look in the front of your local tele-
phone directory. 
The cost to call international destinations varies based on the following 
factors:
 Which country you’re calling: The greater the price charged by the gov-
ernment or local carriers to terminate calls in a particular country, the
more likely you will be to pay a king’s ransom. If the foreign government
decides it is a great source of revenue to pull money from these calls,
you can expect excessive rates.
 The geographic area within the country: If you call a remote area in any
country, you are going to pay more. As a basic rule, competition drives
down the cost of international long-distance calls. For example, it’s
cheaper on some networks to call Manila, Philippines, than any other
area in that country, because Manila, the capital city, is the most densely
populated area of the country.
 Whether you’re calling a cellphone or special service number: A spe-
cial service number is a telephone number used for an entertainment
purpose (see the sidebar, elsewhere in this chapter, “The secret’s in the
special service”). The reason these numbers cost a pretty penny is
because companies built them specifically so they could inflate the cost
as their source or revenue.
International price lists from long-distance carriers offer different rates
based on these factors. For example, you may pay one rate to call 
the country in general, a different rate for calling a cellphone within 
the country, and still another rate if you call someone who lives in 
one of the major cities in the country.
Dialing internationally for the first time
Placing an international call based on what’s printed on someone’s business
card isn’t always the easiest thing in the world — especially if you don’t do it
every day. Companies print up business cards for domestic or regional use. 
If you travel to Europe for business and pick up someone’s card, you may
notice that European city codes look something like (071) or (045). You must
dial 0 and then 71 before you dial the phone number. The actual city code
may be 71 or 45, but in Europe the numeral 0 acts like 1 in the U.S., which 
you must enter before dialing an area code. 
51
Chapter 3: Getting Around the Telecom Neighborhood

If you’re calling a business associate in London and his or her business card
says (071), you drop the 0 in front of the city code and dial 011 + 44 + 71 +
phone number. But if you called that same individual from a phone in London,
you’d dial 071 + phone number.
Blocking International Calls
If you contact your carrier to have a standard international block placed on
your phone lines, you must remember that the block covers only outbound
calls that require the user to dial 011. International blocks don’t block calls to
Canada, the Caribbean, or any other locations in the North American dialing
plan. If you see calls to Trinidad or St. Kitts, please do not get upset with your
carrier; it’s not your long-distance carrier’s fault that international calls are
still being completed by your employees. You should program your phone
system to block the area codes you don’t want contacted. If you do not have
a phone system, you can always ask your carrier to assign account codes to
your phone line so you can at least identify who in your office is making the
calls. (See Chapter 1 if you are wondering about account codes.)
52
Part I: The ABCs of Telecom Service 
Playing the international dialing trivia game
The only two countries in the world with a one-
digit country code are the United States (with
country code 1), and Russia (with country code
7). If you call the U.S. from London, Paris, or
Tokyo, you must dial the country’s international
dialing prefix (which, of course, changes by
country), and then 1+area code+555-5555.
Most international city codes do not begin with
a 0. The exception (there’s always an exception)
occurs in a few cities in Italy.
Mexico is the only country that’s been broken up
by long-distance carriers into seven different
pricing bands. It is now more common to rate
calls to Mexico by city, cellphone, and special
service. Imagine dropping a stone into a pond;
each ripple is farther from the center than the
one inside it. This is how Mexico was initially set
up, but in reverse. The geographic areas that are
easiest to reach, like Tijuana, and the border
towns by Texas are Band 1. As you go farther
inland, the band numbers increase, along with
the cost to complete the calls.
The most expensive international calls you can
make are ship-to-shore calls and shore-to-ship
calls. Both types of calls are equally pricey.
These calls are also commonly called Inmarsat
(International Maritime Satellite Organization)
calls. The rate for these calls can top $25 per
minute (no, I’m not kidding) to reach a ship in the
Pacific. For that price, you would expect at least
a rundown of your horoscope for the week or
some lucky numbers you can choose for the
lotto! Or you could save your money and just
take that cruise instead!

D
edicated service is telecom service provided through a dedicated circuit
that only you have access to, spanning from your physical location to
your carrier’s network. It used to be a relatively rare telecom option, but it’s
becoming more common as hardware prices continue to drop and per-minute
costs decline. If you’re thinking about making the change to dedicated ser-
vice, you should do a little research. Dedicated service requires you to take
on a new series of responsibilities. For one thing, you’ll be dealing with a
whole new set of hardware. That means (ka-ching) buying the right equip-
ment and making sure that you maintain it, as well. 
This chapter goes over the details so that you know what’s required of your
company, as well as the carrier, when you order up a new dedicated circuit.

Understanding the Language 
of Dedicated Service
Before you can have a conversation about dedicated service, you have to
understand the language. When you have the lingo down, the rest all falls into
place. Here’s the lowdown on the basic terminology:
 Local loop: The copper wire or fiberoptic cable that spans from your
carrier to your office. Your carrier charges you a rental fee for the local
loop every month and a one-time fee when it’s installed.
 Central Office or CO: The building where your local carrier houses a
large piece of hardware called a Class 5 (local services) switch, which
routes calls, provides dial tone, and all the other telecom services you
know and love. Also in this building are several tons of batteries to sus-
tain the Class 5 switch in the case of a large-scale power outage.
 Point of Presence or POP: The building where your long-distance car-
rier houses a large piece of hardware called a Class 4 (long-distance)
switch, which routes calls and provides all the long-distance services
you know and love. 
 T-1 or DS-1: A dedicated circuit that can be broken down into 24 individ-
ual channels, each of which can support a call. The T-1 circuit is also
called a DS-1, and is the basis of all dedicated circuits; all voice circuits
are broken down to T-1 level. 
 DS-3: A dedicated circuit that holds 28 T-1s. This is a big cable. In fact, it
doesn’t even resemble a standard phone line that you plug into your
phone; it looks more like the big, fat, round cable that connects into
your television.
 OC-3: A dedicated circuit that holds three DS-3s. This is an even bigger
big cable. It’s a fiberoptic circuit and requires an optical multiplexer (or
optical MUX) to receive it. An optical multiplexer is a device that puts
the electrical DS-3 circuits into a fiberoptic cable. Optical multiplexers
use light rather than electricity for signaling.
 DS-0: The atomic unit of telecommunications. A DS-0 represents the
single channel necessary to carry one phone conversation. You need 24
DS-0 circuits to make up a T-1 or DS-1. That makes DS-0 the primary unit
of measure for dedicated circuits in the United States. 
 E-1: Outside the U.S., the basic unit for dedicated services. E-1 circuits
carry 32 DS-0 circuits, 30 call channels, plus one channel for timing and
one channel for signaling. The European standard was developed after
the American DS-1 standard was set up.
56
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

Understanding Your Responsibilities
When You Get a Dedicated Circuit
Because dedicated circuits are more complex than switched phone lines, they
require more hardware to construct them. You don’t just drop a dedicated
phone circuit into your business without a bit of logistical planning. Your car-
rier only terminates circuits in accordance with industry standards — you
can’t get a partial T-1 circuit or half a DS-3 circuit. 
The problem is that you can’t make a phone call with a full T-1 dedicated cir-
cuit because the telephony network in the U.S. is set up for calls to be either
56KB (kilobytes) or 64KB. Trying to make a phone call with all 1.544 Mbps
(megabits per second) of a T-1 circuit is like trying to take a drink of water
out of a fire hose. You need to break down the flow of bits into smaller
chunks so that your phone system can handle them.
The tool you use to break the large pipe into smaller pieces is a multiplexer,
which connects into your existing phone system. 
Getting all the equipment you need 
to make your dedicated circuit go
Here’s a list of the equipment you need to make and receive calls on a dedi-
cated circuit:
 Phones: You may already have these in place, or you may not need that
many of them. Business models that provide calling card platforms or
telemarketing services via an automated dialer handle most of the dial-
ing with automated computer programs. These businesses may have
three employees in the office, but the phone system may process thou-
sands of calls an hour from customers calling in with calling cards or
accessing prerecorded messages. 
 Breakout board or punch-down block: These are plastic trays or racks
that allow you to connect individual phone lines from your MUX or PBX
to individual phones. Wiring and rewiring directly into a phone system
presents the danger of damaging the connectors. These external racks
allow changes to be made when one of your employees moves to a new
desk or when a new fax line is installed, without having to continually
press new wires into the PBX. Instead of destroying the port on an
expensive phone system, it is better to short out a section on a cheap
plastic breakout board. 
57
Chapter 4: Understanding Dedicated Service Requirements

 Cabling to connect your phones to your phone system: Unless you
have some magic wireless setup in your office, you need to have some-
one physically run the cables from your phones back to the phone
closet. From there, the cables connect either to a punch-down block
(see previous bullet) or tap directly into the phone system. If you’re
adding a dedicated circuit to your existing system, you already have 
the wiring out to your phones in place.
 A phone system — preferably a PBX system: Smaller phone systems
may not be able to handle dedicated circuits or may quickly hit their
limit after they receive one dedicated circuit. A post branch exchange
(PBX) system picks up where these smaller phone systems leave off. If
you don’t have a phone system yet, I recommend that you get a PBX
system.
If you already have a phone system but have never added a dedicated
circuit to it, call your hardware vendor to ensure that your system can
even handle the upgrade without additional hardware. Your phone
system may have limitations or requirements that require a multiplexer.
You simply need to know this information before you buy one.
 A MUX or channel bank: The MUX is a piece of hardware that receives
the circuit from the carrier and parses it out into a smaller, usable size.
Most MUXes break the circuit down one level, but some powerful MUXes
can break the data all the way down to individual channels. For example,
a T-1 MUX breaks the T-1 circuit down into 24 DS-0 circuits that you can
use to make phone calls. 
A DS-3 MUX generally breaks a circuit down from DS-3 level to 28 T-1 cir-
cuits but goes no farther. You need an additional piece of hardware to
break the T-1s down to DS-0 circuits so that you can actually use the cir-
cuit to make calls. This may seem like a pain, but if you have a DS-3 cir-
cuit, you may want some of your T-1 circuits to be used for an Internet
circuit. With the two different MUXes, you can mix voice and data over
your same dedicated circuit to your carrier. Several T-1 circuits could
provide your office with Internet services and the others could go
through a T-1 MUX to provide DS-0 circuits to your phone system for
voice service.
 Cabling from your phone system to your multiplexer: This cabling may
take the form of a single cable that connects from the phone system to
the multiplexer (MUX), or it may consist of 24 sets of wires running from
the MUX to a white rack called a breakout board or punch-down block.
The breakout board is then wired into your PBX system or key system as
individual phone lines.
58
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

 Channel service unit (CSU): The CSU acts as a testing point for any ded-
icated circuit and can be a stand-alone unit or a card that is integrated
into your MUX.
Although you can have a circuit without a CSU, I don’t recommend it.
The CSU is very helpful if your local carrier drops off your circuit on one
end of your building and your phone system is five floors up and across
the building (a likely scenario). The signal strength on a circuit does
degrade the farther it has to be pushed, and the CSU’s job is to boost 
the strength of the signal. When you buy a MUX, make sure it has a CSU;
otherwise, you need to buy one to sit in front of the MUX. Adtran, Inc.
(www.adtran.com) and Kentrox (www.kentrox.com) are manufactur-
ers that make very nice CSUs. Remember that any time you buy a new
piece of hardware, you also need cabling on the front and back end to
connect it to your system.
 Inside wiring: The final thing you are responsible for is the wiring from
your last piece of hardware, whether it’s the CSU or the MUX, to the last
piece of hardware from your carrier. This section of wiring, generally
from the NIU (network interface unit) to your CSU, is commonly referred
to as inside wiring, and it can be a point of contention when you negoti-
ate with your carrier. Who is responsible for installing and maintaining
inside wiring varies depending on how you set up your circuit. Your car-
rier may offer to provide the inside wiring or it may refuse to do so. Your
responsibility depends entirely upon what the carrier is willing to do 
for you. 
 Network interface unit (NIU): The network interface unit (NIU) is a
small device that has a few pretty lights on it. It boosts the signal of a
circuit and acts as a device for testing. The lights on the NIU tell you
whether the circuit is in service, in alarm, or being tested. You should
know where your NIU is and what it looks like because a time could
come when your circuit is down when you may need to validate what’s
happening on the NIU. Chapter 13 discusses troubleshooting dedicated
circuits.
The NIU is the last piece of hardware that your carrier can easily test
from a remote location. When a circuit reaches the NIU from the CSU, it
continues on without much assistance until it terminates on the other
side in your carrier’s switch.
To help put all of this in context, Figure 4-1 shows how everything is 
connected.
59
Chapter 4: Understanding Dedicated Service Requirements

Handling building-specific issues
If your business is housed in a new construction or in a very old building,
your carrier may require you to provide logistical access and support. Be
warned, trenching and plywood may be required:
 If your building is brand new: Your carrier may ask you to install a
backer board in the main phone room. It sounds technical and complex,
but the backer board is generally just a large piece of plywood attached
to the wall that allows the carrier to secure its network interface unit
(NIU) and any other hardware. 
 If your building is older and has many tenants with large telecom
needs: The conduit that brings all the wires and cables for phone service
into your building may be full. You may have to install a new conduit so
that your carrier can bring the circuit into your building. Although adding
a new circuit doesn’t sound that bad on the surface, it may be costly and
time consuming, because your carrier may also require you to have the
conduit buried from the edge of your building to the edge of your prop-
erty. Although you won’t personally have to dig the trench that goes 
from your building to wherever your carrier specifies (if you do dig that
trench, you deserve a major raise), you will have to pay someone else to
do it. In the best case, you have to dig a path through 10 feet of loose soil;
in the worst case, you have to cut a path through 30 feet of asphalt in
your parking lot.

Taking Responsibility for 
the Inside Wiring
In the previous section, “Getting all the equipment you need to make your
dedicated circuit go,” I make a passing mention of the inside wiring contro-
versy. This section gives you the ins and outs of dealing with your carrier
over this contentious issue. In the simplest terms, inside wiring is the wiring
that goes between the network interface unit (NIU) to the channel service
unit (CSU). 
Knowing the facts about local 
carriers and inside wiring
To understand who is responsible when it comes to inside wiring, you need
to understand the different methods of completing this connection. Then you
need to accept that some things are out of your hands. The local carrier lays
out what it believes its responsibilities are in terms of setting up the circuits,
and although you might like to think that you can negotiate, the fact is that
you may have to accept responsibilities (and the accompanying headaches)
that you would really rather not deal with. The controversy over inside
wiring stems from two important facts:
 Fact 1: The two most important physical locations in your building
(from a telecom perspective, that is) aren’t in the same place. You see,
there’s something called the MPOE, which is the carrier’s initial entrance
to your building. The MPOE is almost never in the same place in the
building where you keep your equipment. 
61
Chapter 4: Understanding Dedicated Service Requirements
Making sure your new CSU can 
be looped before you buy
The testing function of a CSU is solely dependent
on it being loopable. This means that an electric
current can be received by the CSU and sent
back to the origination point. If your CSU is not
loopable, you need to know that before there’s a
problem so that you can work around it. 
If you ever have a problem with your dedicated
circuit, one of the first things your carrier tries
is looping your CSU. If the loop fails, the techni-
cian is likely to think he’s isolated the problem
to a defective CSU, when really the CSU is not
capable of being looped. How embarrassing!
Read the fine print before you buy a CSU.

Demarc (pronounced dee-mark) stands for demarcation point, and the
MPOE (pronounced em-pow) is short for minimum point of entry. There
is usually a piece of hardware at the demarc that is installed by your car-
rier and represents the end of the carrier’s domain. Your ultimate goal is
to get your carrier to place the demarc in your phone room only a few
feet away from your phone system. By wiring to your phone room, your
carrier is providing you with an extended demarc, extending the carrier’s
responsibility only feet away from your hardware. The cable you plug
into the demarc is your responsibility, along with everything else in your
phone closet and all the wiring that runs into your office. The dictates of
the local loop provider identify where it is allowed to drop the demarc. It
may be at the MPOE, in your phone room, or anywhere in between. 
The MPOE is usually a phone room or utility closet where your carrier
drops a circuit if you do not specifically tell the carrier to put the circuit
somewhere else (like, say, the demarc point). The MPOE is a room where
all phone service enters your building. It is frequently locked, with only
your local carrier or building management having the key. Representatives
of local carriers commonly say that they will only drop a circuit at the
MPOE, and that you are responsible for doing the rest of the connecting.
You want to avoid hearing these words if you can (see Fact 2).
 Fact 2: The carrier is responsible for everything it installs. If your carrier
agrees to go past the MPOE, then it is responsible for maintaining all the
work it does past that point. That’s better for you.
To give you an understanding of the significance of these facts, here’s a sce-
nario to consider:
Your carrier wires a circuit into the basement of your building and your hard-
ware vendor takes care of the wiring in your office on the second floor, run-
ning cable from the phone closet in Suite 1 to your equipment in Suite 5.
Sounds great, right? Well, not really. You still don’t have a complete circuit.
You can easily overlook all the bits and pieces of this job because it all falls
into the category of inside wiring. The person who wired from Suite 1 to Suite
5 on the second floor may say to you, “I finished the inside wiring,” and you
may perceive that to mean that he connected into the circuit in the basement
when in reality he didn’t. There is a lot of gray area in inside wiring, so make
sure you are thorough when following up on it. You need to know which spe-
cific locations have been wired by each contingent of this massive project.
Someone must tie into the cable in the basement and then pull the cable up
to connect the other end into the phone closet for your floor in Suite 1. That
someone is determined through a series of negotiations, planning, pleas,
prayers, and luck. If your carrier doesn’t provide the wiring, your only option
is contracting your hardware vendor to complete the connection. This isn’t
undesirable; it simply makes the vendor, rather than your carrier, responsible
62
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

for the wiring. Confirming with your carrier that all the wiring connections
have been completed will set your mind at ease. Most of the time, wiring is
completed to your phone room without any problems. The challenge arrives
if your building management is difficult and isn’t working with your carrier. In
this case, be prepared for weeks of negotiating the install of your circuit.
Addressing your options honestly
You only have three flavors of inside wiring options to choose from, depend-
ing on what your carrier either can or will provide:
 Worst-case scenario — carrier wires to the MPOE only: This is where
your carrier, for one reason or another, will only install your circuit in
the MPOE. The technician installs the circuit on the NIU (network inter-
face unit), labels it with your circuit ID that acts as an inventory number
with your carrier, or some kind of identifier, and then promptly leaves. If
this is the case, you have to contract with your hardware vendor to wire
into the NIU and run cable to the room with your phone equipment. You
need to coordinate this effort with the office management because the
MPOE may be locked. 
After the cable is run into your phone room, your hardware vendor
should terminate the circuit on a phone jack (connector) of some sort.
The circuit could possibly be wired directly into your CSU, but a direct
connection of this nature makes replacing the CSU and troubleshooting
the circuit a tad more difficult. You will have a much easier time if you
can simply unplug the cable instead of unscrewing every wire from a
piece of hardware.
 Could-be-much-worse-case scenario — carrier installs an extended
demarc: In this scenario, your carrier does not drop the circuit at the
MPOE, but actually moves the NIU to the phone room on your floor of
the building, possibly even into your suite next to your CSU. This sce-
nario gives you a great deal of protection against inside wiring issues
because your carrier is now responsible for everything that is installed
to your phone room. The circuit is still dropped and tagged with your
circuit IDs so that you can identify them. 
If you already have an extended demarc in your suite, you may see 
other circuits listed on the hardware from other carriers. If you have an
extended demarc, your hardware vendor needs to provide a small piece
of cable from the extended demarc to a phone jack. Make sure the jack is
also listed with the circuit ID; it connects into the NIU. Then all you need
is a cable to connect from the jack to your CSU and you are ready to test.
63
Chapter 4: Understanding Dedicated Service Requirements

 Best-case scenario — carrier provides inside wiring to RJ-45 jack (T-1)
or coax (DS-3) cable: This scenario rocks because it places the greatest
responsibility for maintenance on the carrier. The only piece of cable
that is under your care is the section that plugs into your CSU on your
hardware side and the phone jack on the carrier side.
64
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 
Getting tips and reminders from the pros
So many factors are involved in who does the
installation of all the inside wiring, and how you’re
charged for labor, materials, and maintenance.
Here are a couple of reminders from the insiders:
 Maybe it’s out of your hands anyway. Some
buildings have very strict rules on wiring
and have set up contracts with a company
that handles all inside wiring issues. Other
buildings are a bit more flexible and allow
other companies to do the work as long as
they have the proper clearance and are suf-
ficiently bonded in case something goes
horribly wrong. If this is the case with your
building, your local carrier is probably
already authorized to pull the cable to your
phone room. If by some fluke they aren’t,
your building management will gladly refer
you to a company that is authorized.
 Consider all the costs. Inside wiring is not
free and can cost more money to install. If
your carrier provides the wiring, you may
have to pay out twice the amount of what
you would pay your hardware vendor, but
then your carrier is responsible for the
wiring. If your hardware vendor runs the
wiring, you may pay less now, but you will
definitely feel the pain later, if the vendor
has to come out six months later to fix it.
 Find out your carrier’s inside wiring policy.
Some carriers charge you to install it, but
only claim any responsibility for mainte-
nance if a problem occurs within 24 hours of
installation. Some carriers give you free
maintenance on it for 30 days. One constant
in the inside wiring game is that if your car-
rier orders the inside wiring, it is responsible
to fix it if a problem develops. They may be
charging for the repair, but it’s still their
responsibility to initiate trouble reports with
the local loop provider and press through to
resolution.
Shh . . . Check the bill. All carriers have very
complicated billing systems. Sometimes
that can work in your favor. A carrier may
very well have difficulty tracking things 
like inside wiring charges. Although you
shouldn’t count on not getting charged, the
bottom line is that the fee you were sup-
posed to get hit with for installation or main-
tenance may never show up on your bill.

T
oll-free numbers are everywhere today: You see 1-800-FLOWERS adver-
tised on television or 1-888-GON-REFI popping up on the Web to entice
surfers to call for mortgage refinancing. Heck, you can’t pick up a can of soda
without reading, COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS, CALL 1-800-555-XXXX.
These are just a few examples of how a toll-free number can be used to help
you take orders or provide customer service. The basic concept behind toll-
free service is that the business that owns the 800 number pays for the calls
that it receives; the toll-free part applies to the caller, not to the company.
You may wonder how a company can afford to pay for so many incoming
long-distance calls. Well, the widespread use of toll-free numbers shows that,
despite the cost, companies believe these numbers add value to their busi-
ness. In this chapter, I introduce you to the ins and outs of toll-free service,
including the fees involved. I tell you how to go about discussing options with
your carrier, explain how toll-free numbers interface with your other telecom
services, and show you where you may run into potential toll-free pitfalls.
Taking a Peak at Toll-Free Service Basics
You know that toll-free numbers put the financial burden on the receiving end
of a phone call, rather than on the calling end. Often referred to as reverse
billing, toll-free numbers are convenient for customers and also enable busi-
nesses to build name (and number recognition). The following sections give
you some general info about how toll-free numbers function.

Understanding the physical properties 
of a toll-free number
A toll-free number is not like your home or office phone number. The line for
that number doesn’t physically exist anywhere. If your business has a toll-
free number and you dial out from a line that receives those calls, the person
receiving your call sees your business’s local phone number, not the toll-free
number, in his or her Caller ID window. This happens because toll-free num-
bers are an inbound service riding over your existing phone line, and must
have a local phone number or dedicated circuit to be routed over to allow
them to work.
Toll-free numbers sometimes do appear in the Caller ID window, however.
This doesn’t mean that everything I just said is a lie, just that when a toll-free
number appears in your Caller ID window you’re experiencing a little telecom
sleight of hand. Telemarketing companies are required by law to display a
legitimate Caller ID phone number. To accomplish this for all of their cus-
tomers across the U.S., telemarketers use their dialing software to insert a
simulated Caller ID number. What you see could be a local phone number of
the order or customer service department, or it could be the toll-free number
used for accepting orders. The number you see in your Caller ID isn’t legiti-
mate, because it doesn’t physically exist on a phone line, but that’s just a
technicality. The main thing is that you can use the number to call the tele-
marketer and buy products or to tell the business to stop calling you. The
industry term for this simulated phone number is pseudo ANI (the ANI part
stands for Automatic Number Identification — telecom-speak for a phone
number). If your dedicated circuit uses the ISDN protocol, your hardware
may be able to input the pseudo ANI on the calls for you. All other protocols
require your carrier to assign the pseudo ANI to your circuit through their
normal order process. Turn to Chapter 8 for more information regarding dedi-
cated circuit protocols.
Understanding the ring-to factor
Toll-free numbers are linked to ring-to numbers. Although toll-free numbers
aren’t physically associated with particular phones connected with a phone
jack into the wall, you do receive the toll-free calls with a traditional tele-
phone. Incoming calls get sent to your office or your home when your carrier
directs the calls to either a ring-to number or a dedicated circuit.
A ring-to number is the regular phone line that is tied to a phone jack on your
wall. Your carrier has a database that tells it how to route calls so that they
end up in your office. If you have a ring-to number configuration, you need 
to know the phone number your toll free rings to in case you have to trou-
bleshoot it, or order more toll-free numbers. 
66
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

Dedicated circuits use trunk groups to receive toll-free calls instead of ring-to
numbers. Your carrier designs your dedicated toll-free number to route to a
trunk group specifying channels on your circuit that are to receive the incom-
ing calls. Trunk groups can be limited to a single channel on a circuit, or may
include several T-1s. Chapter 8 covers this information in detail.
Understanding the role of a RespOrg
The term RespOrg is an industry buzzword that refers to several pieces of
toll-free-related minutiae. For example, a company that controls a toll-free
number is called a RespOrg. The name is actually a reduction of the words
responsible organization. 
In the strictest sense, the company that holds RespOrg of a toll-free number
is the only entity that can change and manipulate the setup of the number 
in the national database. A RespOrg document, more accurately called a
RespOrg Letter of Authorization or RespOrg LOA is the paperwork you need to
fill out in order to transfer a toll-free number to a new carrier. If you’re speak-
ing about the RespOrg department, then you’re talking about the overworked
group of people who work for a carrier. The people who work for the RespOrg
department of a carrier live in a room insulated from the outside world by 
6-foot thick walls of rebar-reinforced concrete and have only one phone line
tied to a fax machine. Their sole job is the migration, design, and activation of
toll-free numbers. Wild times. If you’re interested in the RespOrg department
or the RespOrg LOA, please hop over to Chapter 9, where you can find out all
the nuances of both. If you want even more information, you can explore the
800 Service Management System (SMS/800) Web site (www.sms800.com).
This site is the heart of all toll-free service in the U.S. and Canada.
67
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom
Discovering toll-free numbers in their natural 
habitat: The SMS database
Because toll-free numbers aren’t tied to copper
wires in someone’s home or business, you prob-
ably wonder where they do live. All the toll-free
numbers in the U.S. live as data in a series of
computers that make up a huge national net-
work called the Service Management System
(SMS) database. This national archive lists
every toll-free number in the U.S. and directs
every call made to a toll-free number to the cor-
rect network to complete the call. In addition to
the basic routing information, the database con-
tains very specific information about individual
toll-free numbers.

Accepting Financial Responsibility 
for Wrong Numbers
A toll-free number is not a miraculous filter that instinctively blocks incoming
calls you would prefer not to take. Unfortunately, you have to pay for all
incoming calls within the geographical region you specified when you set up
the toll-free number, including the calls from people who mistakenly dial 
your toll-free number. Just as old homes bring unwanted mail, every toll-free
number has a history that can affect how many mistaken calls you get. The
longer a toll-free number has been active for another company, the more
people will still have the number listed on the five-year-old letterhead or the
ten-year-old business cards.
You can also get calls that are simply misdialed. The caller may have entered
800 rather than 888, or transposed some digits. Generally, these calls are only
a handful per month and amount to a few pennies, hardly worth doing any-
thing about them. However, the calls appear on your invoice and you are
expected to pay for them.
Because the true 800 numbers have been around the longest, they have the
most baggage in terms of potential carry-over calls from previous owners. If
you order a toll-free number that begins with 800, you can expect calls from
people trying to get life insurance quotes, make payments on their cars, or
ask for technical help on the turbo engine they just bought for their new
scooter. If you really have a problem with these calls, you should request an
877 or 866 number for your toll-free service. They are newer and generally
have less baggage.
68
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 
This isn’t your daddy’s 800 number
A long time ago (you know, back in your daddy’s
day), all toll-free numbers started with 800. Now
times have changed. With cheap long-distance
calling, as well as a huge population of fax
machines and cellphones, everyone (including
your daddy) can have his own 800 number. And
it seems like everyone decided to get one.
When the supply of 800 numbers ran out, a new
888 exchange was released for toll-free calls.
People loved the 888 numbers so much that in a
few years the 888 inventory was running thin as
well. So 877 and 866 were released as the new
toll-free numbers, with plans to open 855 in the
future. These new number exchanges mess up
the old nickname for toll-free numbers. You
can’t really call them 800 numbers because toll-
free numbers may have any number of configu-
rations. To avoid confusion and avert disaster in
the world of telecom, the generally accepted
practice is to refer to the whole bunch of num-
bers — 800, 888, 877, 866, and even the yet-to-
be-released 855 — as 8XX numbers, or as I do
in this book, just toll-free numbers. 

If a business accidentally lists your toll-free number, or one that people easily
confuse for your number, in their latest marketing blitz, you could end up
receiving thousands of misdialed calls per day. Every one of these calls takes
time to answer and resolve, even if all your employees say is, “Sorry, wrong
number.” A month later, when you receive your invoice you will also remem-
ber that you have to pay for them. If you see the handwriting on the wall that
the wrong-number calls are going to eat up your time or your budget, you
have two choices:
 Block your toll-free number from the geographic area the calls origi-
nate. If your business is in Seattle, Washington, and all your calls are
coming from people trying to win a sweepstakes from a local radio sta-
tion in Cincinnati, Ohio, just block access to your toll-free number from
Ohio. As long as you don’t have any existing or potential customers in
the area you are blocking, you have nothing to fear. And you can always
reinstate access from Ohio callers when the buzz dies down.
 Cancel the toll-free number and get a new one. I know it sounds brutal,
but you may have no choice. You can’t easily filter the wanted from the
unwanted calls. In the end, you will have to make a business decision
whether to keep the toll-free number and live with the added time and
expense, or make a clean break and get a new number.
Coming to Terms with the 
Toll-Free Life Cycle
Toll-free numbers can be an immense source of frustration if you do not know
where they are in their life. Here are just a few of the scenarios that you could
be dealing with in regard to toll-free telephone service:
 You reserve a number and fail to use it during the time it is in reserved
status, thereby losing access to the number, and enabling it to fall back
to the rest of the world. Keep reading.
 You want to use a toll-free number has been cancelled and released to
the world the same day. This is not good. Very bad things can happen.
The following sections are for you.
 You already have toll-free numbers and don’t plan on canceling them,
but are changing carriers. If you fit this scenario, you should jump over
to Chapter 9 to find out about ordering toll-free numbers. You face spe-
cific pitfalls in that task that you need to know about now.
69
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom

 If you’re not moving your numbers, but they’re just not working for one
reason or another, Chapter 14 is your destination. 
 Finally, if you are planning on ordering new toll-free numbers or cancel-
ing old numbers, you are in the right place.
Conception
In the beginning, thousands of toll-free numbers wander spare around the
national SMS database. As long as they are spare, anyone can decide to
secure them by placing them in a reserved status. Now the reserved status
isn’t forever; actually, it only lasts 45 days. If your carrier doesn’t activate the
number before the 45th day, the toll-free number is released back into the
spare pool and it becomes free game for anyone else. The good news is that
for the 45 days the number is in reserved status, no other carrier can touch it
in any way. No one can attempt to migrate the number away either through
the usual channels or by force. The number simply exists in limbo until you
activate it or let it go.
If you are ordering new toll-free numbers, don’t be in a hurry to publish them.
The reality is that we live in an imperfect world, and sometimes people trans-
pose digits, advertising your number instead of theirs. Or maybe you wrote
down the wrong number? (Never!) A frazzled business owner may have for-
gotten that a number that he reserved 45 days ago (and is currently printing
a million business cards to promote) has moved back to the spare pool and
(oh, horror) been picked up by you. Or maybe it was you who thought you
took that number out of reserve? (Never!) In either case, the toll-free num-
bers you believe in your heart are yours may not be there (or you may decide
you don’t want them). Many people believe that the second they receive a 
fax about their new number they have received a guarantee of the number’s
availability, but that is not true. A number isn’t yours until you can receive
calls from it. Never publish a toll-free number until you have activated it,
made a test call to it, and ensured that it rings through to the correct number!
I cannot stress this point enough. 
Birth
After your carrier finds your favorite toll-free number, you have to activate 
it. This is usually an easy task for your carrier and if the toll-free number is
going to ring into a typical, everyday phone line, the process should take 
no more than about 24 hours. During that time frame, your carrier simply
updates the national SMS database so that every carrier in the U.S. knows
70
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

how to route the call. Anyone in the order-entry or provisioning department
at your carrier can send the order off through an automated system to the
national SMS database.
When your carrier updates the national database, it also updates its network
to route the call to your home, office, cellphone, or wherever else you
requested that the calls be sent. When all the systems are updated, presto!
You can receive calls.
Adulthood
After a toll-free number is active, it goes to work. During this time, you can
move the number to another carrier, point it to another location, or make any
variety of adds, changes, or moves on it. Toll-free numbers don’t wear down
or become brittle with age; they just keep on working as long as you do. Only
when a company goes out of business or is significantly reorganized, nullify-
ing the number’s purpose in life, is a toll-free number deactivated. 
Demise
There is a standard procedure in the industry for decommissioning a toll-free
number, and the next person who picks up the toll-free number would like
you to follow it. When you shut down a toll-free number give it a proper
burial by blocking the number and then canceling it.
Your toll-free number can bypass the three-month hold time for a cancel
order and be immediately released into the spare pool. If your carrier issues
a cancel order on your toll-free numbers and does not block it for three
months first, very bad things can happen: 
 Gone is gone! If you send the order to your carrier to take down the
wrong toll-free number and the number becomes born again immedi-
ately, you may have no logistical or legal way to get it back. 
When you give up a number, it’s gone forever. If someone else picks the
number and it sits in protective reserve limbo for 45 days before activa-
tion, you can’t try to break the reserve and migrate the number back to
your company. The other company legally acquired the number. Your
only hope of reclaiming the number in this case is through diplomatic
negotiation with its new owner.
 Chaos ensues! If you just want to be rid of a number and release it with-
out following the protocol, you’re potentially setting a stable world on a
path to destruction. The system works because everyone plays by the
same rules. When rules are broken, the whole telecommunications uni-
verse falls apart. Okay, I may be overstating things just a tad, but the
point is that with toll-free numbers, patience is essential.
71
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom

If, for any reason, you’re done with a toll-free number, you must follow a
pretty standard procedure. Give it a proper goodbye now so that it can be
reborn later. Here’s how the process should work:
1. You contact your carrier with an order to take down a toll-free number.
2. The carrier places a block on the number. 
Placing a block on a toll-free number simply prevents calls from complet-
ing to it. 
3. Your carrier still has total control of the number for the 90 days the
number stays in blocked status.
Aside for ensuring that the block order shifts to a cancel order (see Step
4), for all intents and purposes, you’re done.
This is an important step, because if you sent the wrong number to be
taken down by your carrier or you changed your mind for some other
reason, you can still have it reactivated quickly and easily during that 90-
day window. 
4. After 90 days the block order automatically turns into a cancel order. 
5. The toll-free number sits in a cancel status for another 90 days.
6. After these 90 days in limbo, it is reborn, becoming spare again. It’s
released for someone else to reserve and activate. 
The intention of this process is to give you three months to find your
mistake if you cancelled the wrong number, as well as to allow a six-
month cool-down before someone else can activate it. During that time,
the people who have been calling the number for four years will realize
that the number is out of service and will stop calling. 
Following this professional courtesy prevents the next business that reserves
the number from receiving wrong-number calls from people who wanted to
speak to representatives of your business. Obviously, this is the protocol you
hope the previous owner of your toll-free number followed, so be sure that
you follow the golden rule.
Evaluating Your Business’s 
Toll-Free Needs
Every business has its own, particular toll-free requirements, aspirations, and
dreams. Your business must have certain features; other features would be
nice, as long as they don’t break the bank; and finally there are the features
that you would love to have but may only exist in your dreams. The best way
to ensure that you get everything you want is to list all of your preferences
(and rank them accordingly) before you make the first call to your carrier. Or
72
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

at least find out if what you want is available. The good news is that all carri-
ers provide the same basic toll-free features. Not sure what you want, or even
what’s available? Read the following sections, which break down features
based on business size and profile.
Small to midsize businesses 
Business Profile: Companies in this category have 15 or fewer employees
and fewer than 10 phone lines in the office. The main function of the business
isn’t telecom related and the level of service they provide is basic. 
Recommendations: Regular, plain-vanilla toll-free service with no features
may be all you need. You probably want your toll-free number to roll over to
a group of lines set up by your local carrier so that when two people call in,
the second person doesn’t get a busy signal. 
If you have a service business, you may need to make sure that the phones
are answered after hours. You can get something called Time-of-Day routing.
This service sends calls to voicemail after you close shop at night. If your
existing phone system doesn’t pick up calls after you close your shop, you
can have your long-distance carrier send your toll-free calls to a different
location, based on the time of day and day of week. What this means is that
you can set up the toll-free number from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., Monday
through Friday to ring into your office, but at 5:01 p.m. you may want it to be
pointed to an after-hours answering service, or to the cellphone of a desig-
nated on-call employee. You need to tell the carrier where to repoint calls
from 5:01 p.m. to 7:59 a.m. every morning during the week and all day on the
weekends. You also need to confirm your company’s holiday schedule with
your carrier so that you are all in agreement when your office will be closed.
You may work a half-day on Christmas Eve, or the factory may shut down
between Christmas and New Years: In either case, you need to cover all of
your standard days off to make sure you are all on the same sheet of music.
Of course, your phone system or local carrier may already cover this service,
so make sure you know what features you already have before opting for
more.
Small to midsize service businesses 
with several locations 
Business Profile: Companies in this category provide a very high level of ser-
vice within an industry that demands quick response times. These busi-
nesses have fewer than 20 employees per location. Cab companies, tow truck
services, and plumbing/electrical repair companies are businesses that you
might expect to find in this category. 
73
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom

Recommendations: Geographic routing (sometimes called just geo routing) is
a great feature for small service-oriented businesses with multiple locations
because it enables you to list a single toll-free number for all of your cus-
tomers even though calls are routed to various office locations, depending 
on where your customer is calling from. For example, if you have a regional
towing company with two locations in the Northwest and someone calls you
from Sutherlin, Oregon, the call is routed to your office in Medford, Oregon. If
someone else dials the exact same toll-free number from Seattle, Washington,
the call is routed to your Tacoma, Washington, office. Geographic routing
uses technology to project the same sense of continuity you get from a large
business while also offering the personalized customer care you expect from
a smaller company.
Depending on your business, you may set up geographic routing so that
anyone who calls from a state in the eastern time zone rings to your Florida
office. If someone calls the same toll-free number in the central time zone
states, the call can be sent to your Colorado office, while calls in the pacific
time zone ring to your Oregon location. 
In addition to the geographic routing, you may also want Time-of-Day routing
(see the previous section, “Small to midsize businesses”) so that calls can roll
over to the cellphones or pagers of your after-hours staff.
Telecom-centered businesses 
Business Profile: Companies that fall into this category sell telecom products
or services (calling cards, telemarketing services, and so on) as their primary
or secondary product. If you find yourself ordering toll-free numbers in quan-
tities of 100 at a time, or if your company’s phone bill is 50 percent or more of
your operating expense, your business falls into this group. 
Typically, telecom-centered companies use a large quantity of toll-free num-
bers with basic features, although they may have a bunch of toll-free num-
bers with advanced features. The bottom line with these companies is that
their toll-free numbers are their lifeblood, and without them they do not
make any money. These companies generally have a complex phone switch
that works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year processing and
tracking all calls. This consistency of service prevents any need for Time-of-
Day or geographic routing, because telecom companies always want calls to
come to one place — the switch. Your main concerns if you work in this type
of business are pay phone surcharges and redundancy.
74
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

If telecom is your business, you can understand why making your toll-free
numbers work for you is essential. You can also understand why I can’t give
you all the information on this massive topic in one place. The following sec-
tions offer basic recommendations and tell you generally what you need to
do to protect your business from catastrophic charges and network failures.
Recommendation 1: Factor in pay phone surcharges
Pay phone surcharges are federally mandated fees of 55 cents per call. The
surcharges are assessed by pay phone owners (also called a pay phone ser-
vice providers or PSPs) to the recipients of all toll-free calls made from pay
phones. 
Your company may need pay phone blocking if your hardware can’t detect the
information embedded in each call that identifies where it originated. If your
business sells calling cards and you charge customers ten cents a minute to
use one of your calling cards, that’s one thing. But if a customer makes a two-
minute call from a pay phone with a calling card, your business loses money —
35 cents, to be precise. That’s not including the per-minute rate your carrier
charges you for the call, or your overhead in printing, marketing, and cus-
tomer service. In this situation, you have two possible solutions:
 Get the infodigits. You need to upgrade your phone system with a piece
of hardware that can detect infodigits embedded in the call so that you
can pass that 55-cent surcharge on to the caller. When choosing this
route, remember to add some fine print on your calling cards alerting
your customers to the additional fee from pay phones.
 Block toll-free calls from pay phones. You can tell your long-distance
carrier to block access to your toll-free numbers from all pay phones.
This option eliminates the surcharge problem entirely, but it also limits
customer access to your service. 
75
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom
Understanding the origins 
of pay phone surcharges
Toll-free numbers are free for callers to use, but
20 years ago they were even more free. If you
dialed a toll-free number from a pay phone, the
call completed and the PSP didn’t receive or
expect any money for the call. PSPs didn’t see a
need to add the charge because cellphones
were not common, and enough people were
dropping 25 cents into pay phones that the PSPs
were happy and rich. In the last 20 years,
though, everything has changed and now fewer
calls are made from pay phones. A larger per-
centage of those calls are made to toll-free
numbers than to regular numbers. The PSPs
realized this and lobbied Congress for a sur-
charge so they can stay in business. The fee
started out as 23 cents, grew to 35 cents, and is
now 55 cents per call.

If most of your customers don’t use pay phones, paying an additional fee
to block toll-free pay phone calls may be overkill. On the other hand, if
most of your customers do call from pay phones, not using this option
could kill your company. Take a look at your customer base and deter-
mine what you need to do.
The pay phone indicator that is embedded in each call is referred to in the
industry as the ANI II (pronounced ann-EE-eye-eye) or ANI Infodigits. ANI
Infodigits are two-digit numbers that identify the origin of a call, be it a pay
phone, jail, or operator assisted. Table 5-1 lists a few ANI IIs, as well as their
descriptions. The ANI Infodigits are present in the overhead of every call, but
only visible to you when using a dedicated circuit. Even then you will need
the appropriate hardware with the correct protocol to identify and process
the calls accordingly.

detention facilities all fall into this category.
The information in Table 5-1 is only available to your phone system if you
have the following:
 A dedicated circuit from a carrier’s hardware that provides ANI
Infodigits.
 A dedicated circuit using either ISDN or Feature Group D protocol.
76
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

Please check out Chapter 8 if you want more information about these proto-
cols and how they work.
If you provide a service to the PSPs, such as operator service, you may be
able to qualify for a pay phone waiver to exempt you from paying the sur-
charge. It doesn’t make any sense for a PSP to contract with your business
and then charge you 55 cents per call. You’ll just turn around and charge that
amount back to the PSP to cover your costs, and the employees in your
accounts payable and accounts receivable departments will go on strike.
Your carrier may make you sign a legal statement to protect itself from
recriminations, but as long as your business has a contract with the PSPs
authorizing that the fee is waived, you’re in a good place.
Recommendation 2: Add redundancy
If toll-free numbers are the lifeblood of your business, you have them coming
in on a dedicated circuit from your carrier so that you can maximize your
profit (see Chapter 9), but what happens if your carrier has an outage and
your circuit fails? If you don’t have a solid disaster recovery plan, your busi-
ness could be shut down for hours or days while network technicians repair
the issue. 
The best way to protect yourself against an outage is to have dedicated cir-
cuits from two different carriers, and have complete ownership (RespOrg) of
your toll-free numbers. With this kind of power, you can redirect your toll-free
numbers to your second carrier in a matter of minutes if lines from the first
carrier fail. How you accomplish this is by becoming your own RespOrg.
Becoming your own RespOrg
If your business relies on toll-free numbers, you own hundreds of them, and
you have dedicated circuits with more that one carrier, you should probably
go one final step and make your company a RespOrg. Any company can
become a recognized RespOrg and gain access to the national SMS database.
This decision does require a bit of financial commitment, but it’s worth it if
toll-free numbers are a main part of your business.
To make your business a RespOrg, you must pay the $4,000 initial fee and pay
for (and attend) mandatory training. After you pay the fees and complete the
training, you get your very own RespOrg ID code, just like every other carrier,
and you’re off and running. You also have to pay a monthly fee for each toll-
free number you have, as well as a fee whenever you touch a toll-free number
to activate, cancel, migrate, or release it. If you’re interested in making your
business into a RespOrg, please check out the 800 Service Management
System (www.sms800.com) for all the details, fees, and procedures.
77
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom

If all this expense and training is a bit over your head, you can have almost all
the benefits of a direct RespOrg relationship at a fraction of the cost by hiring
a third-party RespOrg company. Third-party organizations have gone through
the SMS training and are full-fledged RespOrgs that create a subaccount for
your business. You still have your very own RespOrg ID code, but you do not
have to go through any training because you don’t have direct access to the
national SMS database. Whenever you want to activate a toll-free number,
simply contact the third-party RespOrg company and everything is taken
care of for you. Using a third-party RespOrg is a great idea for people who
make fewer than 2,500 additions, changes, or deletions per month to their
toll-free numbers. If you’re looking to go this route for your toll-free numbers,
you can check out my favorite third-party RespOrg company, ATL Telecom
Services (www.atlc.com).
Here are some of the benefits of becoming your own RespOrg:
 You have direct access into the national SMS database 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week. You don’t have to wait for a change order to move
through the order system in your carrier. Rather than a 1-to-7-day time
frame to make changes to your toll-free numbers, you can make changes
in about 15 minutes. 
 You can use multiple long-distance carriers for all of your toll-free 
traffic. All long-distance carriers are limited to routing calls over their
own individual networks. Qwest won’t send calls over AT&T lines for
you, and MCI won’t send calls to Sprint for you. Billing would be impos-
sible, and no carrier wants to be responsible for troubleshooting calls
that fail over another carrier’s network. If you want to exploit the bene-
fits of more than one carrier, your business must do it without the 
carriers’ help. 
As your own RespOrg, you can choose which areas in the U.S. you want
to route over which carrier. If you have dedicated circuits with both
Sprint and MCI, and Sprint has a better rate for calls from Texas, you can
point all calls from Texas over your Sprint circuit. At the same time, you
can have all the calls from California route over the MCI circuit if MCI
offers the best rates. 
 You can use a secondary carrier for redundancy. If lightning strikes the
switch for your long-distance carrier and turns it into a molten block of
silicon and steel, that carrier is essentially worthless for a period of days
or weeks when it comes to toll-free coverage from the affected area. If
you have two long-distance carriers and both of them have your num-
bers set up to route into you, this catastrophe is a 15-minute inconve-
nience. All you need to do is go into the SMS database and update it so
that all your toll-free traffic is routed through your other carrier. 
78
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

 Your numbers cannot be held hostage. When you move your toll-free
numbers from one carrier to another, your old carrier can reject your
request to release them if you’re in the middle of a billing dispute or
because you are under contract. The carrier may hold onto your toll-free
numbers and even take them out of service to force you to pay your bill.
It sounds a lot like extortion, but these stipulations are generally written
into any contract you sign for service. If your business is also a RespOrg,
you own your numbers and control the carrier you send the traffic to. If
you have service with both MCI and Sprint, and MCI shuts down your
numbers down in the MCI network for any reason, you simply update
the SMS database and send all the traffic to Sprint. In 15 minutes or so
your toll-free numbers are back up and MCI can’t use your toll-free num-
bers as a pawn against your business.
Large businesses with heavy usage 
and multiple locations
Business Profile: Companies with over 100 employees that spend more than
$5,000 per month on toll-free phone service have a heightened need for
redundancy, service, and disaster recovery. These companies have at least
one dedicated circuit, and possibly several per location. Each regional office
may have multiple customer service and sales support departments at vari-
ous locations working in tandem.
Recommendation 1: Divide your calls in a percentage allocation
A percentage allocation enables you to split up where toll-free calls are sent
based on a set percentage. If you have two offices that can take incoming
phone orders, but one is twice as large as the other, you might want to have
your toll-free number routed to the larger office 67 percent of the time and to
the smaller office 33 percent of the time. Why not use your carrier to help
you maximize your workforce? This solution works for almost any scenario
where you have duplicate departments across locations.
Recommendation 2: Get geographic routing
Any business with several locations, big or small, needs geographic routing.
Geographic routing enables you to provide localized service to your cus-
tomers. For larger, national business, this solution is even more useful. If you
have to service customers in all time zones, instead of having one office that
works from 8 a.m. EST to 6 p.m. PST, you can run shifts that make sense.
Nobody has to wake up at 5 a.m. PST or stay at work till 9 p.m. EST.
79
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom

Recommendation 3: Become your own RespOrg
The control over your toll-free numbers and protection against having them
held hostage is reason enough for any large company to become its own
RespOrg. See the section, earlier in this chapter, called “Understanding the
role of a RespOrg,” for more information.
Recommendation 4: Get DNIS
DNIS (pronounced dee-niss) stands for Dialed Number Identification Service,
and it is a feature available only on toll-free and 900 (9XX) numbers that ter-
minate to dedicated circuits. The feature is actually a numeric code from two
to ten digits embedded in your toll-free calls. The code enables your business
to maintain a large number of toll-free numbers ringing into a single dedi-
cated circuit. If you have 100 or 1,000 toll-free numbers that all receive only a
handful of calls a day, you can program them into your phone system running
over one dedicated circuit with only 24 available phone lines. The DNIS digits
enable you to program a database that can automatically direct any inbound
call to the appropriate department. As long as you don’t have more than 24
calls active on your toll-free numbers at any given time, nobody receives a
busy signal.
Here’s how DNIS works. Say you have five toll-free numbers that your office
has set up for specific departments:
800-555-3333 for Accounting, with a DNIS of 3333
800-555-4444 for Sales, with a DNIS of 4444
800-555-7777 for Customer Service, with a DNIS of 7777
800-555-8888 for Investor Relations, with a DNIS of 8888
800-555-5555 for the fax machine, with a DNIS of 5555
When you order dedicated toll-free numbers from your carrier, you tell the
carrier the exact DNIS number you need assigned to every toll-free number.
Check out Chapter 9 for all the specifics on ordering dedicated toll-free 
numbers.
You can choose any quantity and series of numbers for the DNIS, but you
may want to make things easy on yourself. Common practice is to use a four-
digit DNIS, and to base the DNIS on the last four digits of the toll-free number,
as in the five examples I list in this section. If you have over a thousand toll-
free numbers, you’re more likely to have several numbers with the same last
four digits. You may want to move to a seven- or ten-digit DNIS, possibly
using the entire toll-free number as the DNIS or simply creating a unique DNIS
for every toll-free number, with the DNIS and phone numbers having no
80
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

resemblance to each other. The main reason to use part of the toll-free
number as the DNIS is to make things easy. Someone has to program all 
the toll-free numbers and their associated DNIS numbers into your phone
system. You cut down on possible programming errors if your technician
does not have to cross-reference every toll-free number with a unique DNIS
number.
Putting DNIS to work
This is what happens to an incoming call on 800-555-7777 for your Customer
Service department when it hits your phone system:
1. Your carrier receives a call for 800-555-7777 and sends it to your dedi-
cated circuit.
2, Your phone system sees the incoming call and sends a tone to your car-
rier to identify the DNIS of the toll-free number.
3. Your carrier sends the DNIS digits of 7777 to your phone system. 
4. Your phone system checks the programming it has for DNIS 7777 and
routes the call to the extension for Customer Service.
5. Your Customer Service department receives the call and your customer
is taken care of.
DNIS is only available on dedicated circuits that use either E&M Wink or ISDN
protocol. Some older phone systems may not be able to handle DNIS and 
you will have to partition your dedicated circuits and send calls for specific
departments over specific channels. In this scenario, you will know that calls
that come in on Channels 1 through 14 are for Customer Service; calls that
come in on Channel 15 are for the fax; Channels 16 through 23 are for Sales,
and Channel 24 is for Investor Relations. This partitioning limits the number
of toll-free calls you can automatically route to a maximum of one for every
channel. If you want to set up individual route paths for 50 employees in
Sales, and you only have 24 channels available on your circuit, you are S.O.L
(simply out of luck).
Recommendation 5: Get Caller ID (ANI delivery) 
If you have toll-free numbers coming in on dedicated circuits and want to
track the effectiveness of your marketing, or to have customers’ account
information available when they call in (even before your rep has a chance to
say hello), you need ANI delivery. In the simplest terms, ANI delivery is Caller
ID for dedicated circuits. The phone number that originates a toll-free call
isn’t always sent, and you will have to order the ANI delivery if you want to
receive it. When you have this information coming into your phone system,
you can begin tracking incoming calls. If you have just released a marketing
blitz in Charlotte, North Carolina, you can then track all incoming calls from
that area for the next seven to ten days. If you see a huge spike in incoming
calls, and an associated percentage of sales, you know your marketing plan
was a good investment. 
81
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom

If your phone system is a bit more advanced, you may be able to take the ANI
delivery information and link it up to customers’ accounts (as long as they
are calling from their home or business). Using ANI delivery in this way
enables your customer-care representatives to simply validate account infor-
mation on-screen instead of spending time tracking it down or unintention-
ally introducing error by incorrectly reentering account information. 
Just as with DNIS, ANI delivery is only available if your phone system is using
either E&M Wink or ISDN protocols. If this is a feature you can use, reconfig-
uring your hardware or buying new hardware may be a cost-effective option
if your existing system doesn’t support either of these protocols. Call your
hardware vendor for a quote and a timeline on how long it takes to bring this
type of system together; determine the benefit to your company, and make
your decision.
Recommendation 6: Get ANI Infodigits
If you have dedicated circuits and your customers frequently use pay phones
to call your toll-free numbers, tracking the ANI Infodigits of the calls may be
very beneficial to your business. You could be spending thousands of dollars
per month in fees that are not accounted for in your business model. In the
best-case scenario, you pay $5 or $10 more per month out of your profit. 
In the worst-case scenario, you are being hit for more money in pay phone
fees every month than you are making in profit. If you’re interested in ANI
Infodigits, check out the recommendations I offer earlier in this chapter for
telecom businesses.
Recommendation 7: Handle overflow
If you have multiple locations that perform the same functions (order taking,
customer service, and so on), you will want to have your toll-free system 
set up to send overflow calls from one office to the next. If one office is 
inundated with calls, the calls overflow to the next office, which picks up 
the slack. This is also a very helpful solution if your hardware fails at one
location; the overflow system automatically routes the calls to your next
office without missing a beat. 
Every carrier has different features and limitations when it comes to over-
flow, so you need to shop around. No industry standard is in place regarding
overflow, and every network is built differently. So what you can do with a
toll-free overflow plan from a carrier like WilTel you can’t do with an overflow
plan from MCI. Some of the limitations of overflow you can expect to find are:
 You can only overflow between dedicated circuits that are installed in
a geographically confined region. All of your circuits must connect
together in your carrier’s network in the same location. If you have a cir-
cuit in Chicago, Illinois, and another circuit in Rockford, Illinois, you may
be able to overflow between them. However, your carrier may not enable
you to overflow calls between Rockford, Illinois, and Richmond, Virginia.
82
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

 Yes, but you can overflow lots. A variation of this limitation enables 
you to overflow between as many locations as your heart desires. So
although you’re confined to overflow within a geographic area, you can
have two offices overflowing, or seven, or anything in between, without
a problem. 
 Or you can’t overflow much at all, but you can do so everywhere. In
yet another variation on this theme, you can overflow from an office in
Miami, Florida, to an office in Seattle, Washington, but after overflowing
two times (three locations, total), you may not be able to route the traf-
fic to any other dedicated circuits. 
Be sure to collect all of your information before you base your business
on a service that may not be available. Read the fine print!
After you run out of dedicated circuits to overflow, you need to find some-
place else to route your calls. Toll-free numbers that ring into dedicated cir-
cuits can only occupy as many lines as are in the circuit. If you have a T-1
circuit, you only have 24 phone lines before the next caller receives a busy
signal. Regardless of how large your dedicated circuits are, each of them has
a finite number of channels available. If you have any regular, nondedicated
phone lines in your office, have the calls spill over to them in the event that
you run out of room on your dedicated circuits. 
Overflowing toll-free numbers from a dedicated circuit to regular phone
nondedicated lines probably costs more, so you should only set up this con-
tingency if you expect this scenario to happen rarely. For example, your rate
for calls that ring into nondedicated phone lines is generally more expensive
than the rate for calls that go over dedicated circuits. If your dedicated rate
for toll-free numbers is two and one-half cents per minute, your rate to have
the calls come into a regular phone line may be five cents per minute. If you
begin receiving a large phone bill for toll-free numbers overflowing to regular
phone lines, you have a good reason to believe that your incoming call
volume has begun to outgrow your current system. Start planning — you
need to install another dedicated circuit!
Overflow for dedicated toll-free numbers is referred to by several names. If
you want to sound like a pro, you can ask your carrier to have your calls hunt
from one dedicated circuit to another. Everyone should understand what you
are asking for. You also hear references to dedicated trunk overflow, or just
DTO. Same thing.
Identifying Your Carrier’s Available 
Toll-Free Services
When you’ve determined what your toll-free numbers must do to make your
business work, call your carrier’s sales rep and ask what’s available. Your rep
83
Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom

should have all the services suggested in this chapter, and probably a few
more that the whizzes in Research and Development just created. When you
have the features locked in, go deeper to determine what else your carrier
can do for you. Some things you should ask about are:
 Is redundancy for built in? Your numbers may play a supporting role in
your business, or they may be your business. If you have one toll-free
number that receives four or five calls a day, redundancy may not be
much of a concern. Ask your carrier how long it may take to send your
calls to your cellphone or to another phone number if the phone lines
currently receiving your toll-free calls fail. If you have more that one toll-
free number, but fewer than 500, talk to your carrier about what kinds of
disaster recovery and backup options are available. Redirecting your
toll-free numbers to another office or to a cellphone may be your only
option if your dedicated circuit dies, or your local carrier is experiencing
an outage. 
 How long does reserving a toll-free number take? As long as you’re not
ordering more than 500 toll-free numbers at a time, you should be able to
reserve a toll-free number in 24 hours. If you need numbers quicker, pro-
ject the quantity of numbers you will need for the next 30 days and order
them in advance. You can keep them in your inventory by activating them
with your carrier and pointing them to a phone line that nobody uses. If
you need a toll-free number that spells something like 1-800-4MY-TAXI,
you may have to wait 24 to 48 hours for responses (if the number is even
available). Everything depends on how your carrier is set up to handle
these requests. You may just call a customer service number (toll free, of
course) to instantly reserve numbers — that’s that.
 How quickly can a toll-free number be activated? Again, your business
model drives what length of time you deem acceptable. Companies that
plan for product launches 30 to 45 days out may not worry about this as
much as those that need fast turnaround times. If you have a pager com-
pany that assigns and activates toll-free numbers for every pager you sell,
you can’t wait a month. If you need your toll-free numbers up in hours
rather than days, you need to confirm that your carrier can comply. Toll-
free numbers assigned to regular, nondedicated phone lines generally take
about 24 hours to activate, but setting up a dedicated circuit for toll-free
calls may take 30 days. Know your time frame.
 What is the carrier’s response time if there is an outage? It is never too
early to meet the people who take care of your toll-free numbers when
there is a problem. A day will come when your toll-free services don’t
perform to your standards. Your may have echo, static, or calls to your
toll-free numbers may just fail to connect, leaving callers hearing a fast
busy signal. Now is the best time to request the phone numbers for your
support, as well as standard response times for your carrier. You can
avoid frustration in the future if you know that they have a two-hour
response time for a number that has 100 percent failure and an eight-
hour response time for toll-free numbers with static or echo.
84
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

 What online tools are available to customers? Most carriers have
secure Web sites that enable corporate customers to add, change, and
block toll-free numbers. If your business is big enough, you can use the
Web to get direct access. Using the Web can help you cut costs, manage
your usage better, and even give you a competitive advantage on the ser-
vice you can provide to your customers. 
Online tools are great and a lot of fun, but they also represent a consid-
erable amount of investment from your carrier. If you have access to an
online tool, you may be required to sign a large monthly commitment
with your carrier, or the per-minute rate you pay may be a few pennies
more. If the features are fun, but not integral to your business, you
should weigh their benefits against the cost savings. I know that it is
nice to see the number of calls and total minutes of those calls hitting
each of your dedicated circuits, but so is staying in business, right? Such
features can cost as much as $50,000 more per month. 
 What are the toll-free directory assistance options? This is a very good
question and most people do not choose to be listed in the National Toll-
Free Directory Assistance database. Most people don’t know how to
access this directory, and if people don’t know how to reach the service,
why would you want to pay AT&T the $45 per month (or whatever AT&T
is charging today) to be listed? Incidentally, if you want to access
National Toll-Free Directory Assistance, the number is 800-555-1212.
Realizing the Cost of Enhanced 
Toll-Free Services
Toll-free numbers have the greatest variety of add-on services available, and
every carrier assesses the fee in a different way. One carrier may charge a
one-time installation fee when you activate a number, and another may acti-
vate numbers for free but collect a monthly recurring charge (MRC). Any fea-
ture you add onto your toll-free numbers may have a one-time nonrecurring
charge (NRC) on it or a continual MRC, but is rarely free unless you negotiate
to have the fees waived.
There are exceptions to every rule, but the two fees that you can always
expect to see in relation to your toll-free numbers are:
 The standard per-minute charge for usage. Just like you pay a per-
minute fee for your outbound calls, every toll-free call is charged for the
time the call is active. The rate is generally a little more than what you
pay for standard outbound calls. The only way you can avoid the per-
minute fee for toll-free calls is if you have a package deal with a flat rate
for all of your services. I can guarantee you that even if you have a pack-
age deal like that, somewhere in your contract or the contract of your
carrier is a calculation for usage based on a per-minute cost.

Chapter 5: Meeting Toll-Free Service, the Red-Headed Stepchild of Telecom

Charges for toll-free calls vary! Your contract for toll-free service proba-
bly has a standard set rate plan for calls that only originate from the
lower 48 states. If you are about to begin a campaign in Alaska, Hawaii,
Canada, or any part of the Caribbean, check your rates before you send
out the fliers. These areas may only cost 5 or 10 cents per minute to call
out to, but inbound calls on your toll-free number may easily be 25 to 50
cents per minute. Ouch! Call your carrier to confirm the rates in writing
before you receive a $5,000 phone bill for calls on your toll-free number
from Puerto Rico.
 Pay phone surcharges always apply. Unless you have a contract with a
pay phone provider, you will be required to pay the 55-cent pay phone
surcharge on all calls to your toll-free number from pay phones. 
Aside from these two fees that 99 percent of businesses find on their phone
bill, there are other ways that carriers charge you for toll-free service. No two
carriers are the same, so you will have to extract from them all the charges
and fees that are in their ancillary fees list. They may also be buried in your
contract, but it is worth the hour to read through all the sections. Some of
the more common fees to ask about are:
 Toll-free activation fee: This may be a charge of a few dollars per toll-
free number to build the routing plan and activate your number. If you
have less than 20 toll-free numbers, you may be able to negotiate this 
fee to be waived. If you have more than 50 numbers, ask your carrier
whether you can send the numbers over as a bulk load (you just list 
the phone numbers in an Excel spreadsheet or Word document instead
of filling out the same information on multiple paper order forms) to
reduce the charge. The bulk load process is probably automated and is
definitely quicker.
 Monthly recurring fee per toll-free number: Even if you don’t have any
calls on a toll-free number you may be charged for simply having the
number active. All the carriers are charged about 20 cents (the rate fluc-
tuates) per number by the National SMS database for maintaining the
records on each toll-free number.
 Fees for enhanced routing features: If you have Time-of-Day, or geo-
graphic routing on your toll-free numbers, you may be assessed a fee for
that feature. There is, of course, no industry standard for this fee, but
you should ask to see if there are any of the following fees on your
enhanced toll-free features:
• One-time installation fee per toll-free number: This may be as
little as $1 per number or $10 per number. It is generally not a mas-
sive fee, but if you have thousands of numbers, the cost adds up
quickly.
86
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

• One-time installation fee per dedicated circuit/order/trunk
group: Sometimes a feature for dedicated toll-free numbers is not
actually built on the individual toll-free number, but actually built
on the circuit that receives the number. When you are looking at
rebuilding or adding features to a dedicated circuit, the fees can be
anywhere from $100 to $700 per circuit. The fee may be assigned,
not per circuit, but per order or per trunk group that is a parti-
tioned section of a dedicated circuit. Be sure to know at what level
the fee is assessed.
• Monthly recurring fee per toll-free number/circuit/trunk group:
Your carrier may charge you a one-time installation and a monthly
recurring fee for enhanced features. The monthly fees may quickly
add up to more than you are willing to pay for the service. You
really need to know what the fee is based upon to know what you
will be paying for it every month. It is better to pay $50 per month
to set up DNIS on one circuit than to pay $50 per toll-free number
for the 500 numbers that ring into the circuit.
 Release fee when your toll-free number leaves your carrier: Some 
carriers get you coming and going in the toll-free world. They not only
charge you to set up the new number, but they also charge you when
they release the number to your new carrier if you change carriers.
There is some work required to release a toll-free number, so carriers
that are looking for that extra sliver of profit margin may charge you 
to release the number as well.
 Monthly fees to access Web tools: Carriers that have Web portals may
not simply inflate their per-minute charges to provide the service. They
may actually recover what they spend in development and maintenance
by assessing a monthly fee or per-transaction cost. These fees may not
be immediately visible to you until you use the portal for a month or two
and determine how much you use and need the service. I suggest that
you see how quickly you can cancel the tool if you want to and if there is
any contract term on it. If you find the feature is nice, but too expensive,
it is better to cancel it in 30 days than to be locked into it for another 10
months.

Guide to Your Phone Bill
In This Chapter
 Checking out your summary pages
 Determining your best per-minute cost
 Decimal rounding
 Choosing your invoice type
 Identifying common billing issues
 Monitoring dispute progress
Your phone bill is probably wrong. Please, don’t take it personally; these
things happen. In fact, the problem is so common that some companies
exist for the sole purpose of looking at your phone bill and finding the errors
so that they can switch you over to a new carrier with a slightly more accu-
rate billing system. Some errors are huge and jump right out at you, and
some are small but can cost you thousands of dollars over the course of a
year. 
These problems plague all carriers, but long-distance carriers seem to have
the greatest trouble keeping everything straight. Depending on the complex-
ity of your telecom needs, you may receive phone bills from several different
companies, so check them all. In this chapter, I go over the key items to 
look at in your invoice to ensure you are being billed correctly. I also cover
common billing trouble areas, and give you direction on issuing disputes to
your carrier to get credits.
Relying on Your Contract
Before you can begin checking anything on your invoice, you need to know
what your correct charges should be. Find a copy of your contract for service. 

Along with the contract, you should also grab a copy of any amendments
your company has signed, any rate notifications that may have landed on
your desk, or any correspondence from your carrier that refers to any
monthly recurring fees, installation charges, or per-minute costs. 
If you don’t have all this information handy, you can always contact your car-
rier and request copies of these files; however, oddly enough, sometimes the
special breaks you negotiate don’t always make it into your file at the carrier.
Funny how that works. 
Keep a file of all paperwork and forms you receive from your carrier, espe-
cially those that contain any reference to fees or charges. It is better to keep
ten pieces of worthless paperwork than lose one that could save you a lot of
money every month. If you lose a document that reduces your cost, your 
carrier may not have it on file either and you will have to start over at 
square one.
Reviewing the Summary Pages
Every good invoice has a summary section. It is generally on the first or last
few pages of your invoice. The section lists aggregate costs for everything on
your invoice. The summary is the best place to start reviewing invoices from
all of your carriers because it enables you to see the view from 30,000 feet
before you focus on each area at ground level.
If you have never reviewed your invoice, you will most likely need a guide. I
suggest calling the customer service number on your invoice to find a helpful
person to navigate and explain the terrain. Virtually every major carrier has
an online presence. You can often answer basic questions by visiting the car-
rier Web site and looking for a Billing FAQ link. 
Regardless of whether you’re trekking out on your own, or you have some
help, you should start your journey in the summary section. Check out the
following sections to find out what kind of information is included in the 
summary.
Previous balance, payments, and credits
This small section of the summary is a snapshot of your financial state of
affairs with your carrier. It is helpful to check this area to confirm that your
last payment was received and posted. If your last check was lost in the 
mail, you immediately see late charges growing on your account. If you 
90
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

don’t identify whether your carrier has received your last payment, late
charges can build up for several months until you get a call from an accounts
receivable representative. After that, you may spend another 30 to 60 days to
unraveling the situation. 
Here’s what you’re likely to see: 
Your Company Name
Previous Balance:
$1,875.23
Payments/Credits:
$1,800.00
Past Due Balance:
$75.23
Current Charges:
$2,314.57
Late Fee:
$.83
Total Due:
$2,390.63
In this example, the previous invoice was underpaid by $75.23, so a late fee
was assessed on the remaining balance. The remaining balance is added onto
the new charges that reveal the balance due when the next payment is made. 
If you made a payment but it wasn’t received, finding out what went wrong
may take a bit of time. When the payment is reapplied, you should receive a
credit for the late fees. Do not take anyone’s word for it that a credit will be
issued. If you do not see the credit noted on your account summary, it hasn’t
been posted. 
Checking aggregate costs and minutes 
per phone number or circuit
The summary area of your invoice includes several sections devoted to rep-
resenting your phone usage in a meaningful way. One part may show all out-
going calls based on the phone number or circuit that originated them;
another section may break out all outgoing calls based on whether they were
interstate, intrastate, or international; another may lump all outgoing calls
together based on the time of day the calls were made. (If you have questions
about these call types, please visit Chapter 3 for a full explanation.) 
You need to review your contract to see how you are supposed to be billed to
determine which summary is the best to use. If you have one rate for in-state
calls and another rate for out-of-state calls, a summary by type may be all
you need. Divide the total number of minutes by the total charge, and you
have your blended per-minute cost for that call type. If the rate is two cents
higher than your contract stipulates it should be, you need to do some
deeper investigating at the individual call level.
91
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

Addressing monthly recurring 
charges for dedicated circuits
When you activate or deactivate a dedicated circuit, you need to pay close
attention to your invoice. If the circuit comes up on August 28, you see a pro-
rated charge for the four days in August that the circuit was active; you’re not
charged for the entire month. 
Understanding that all charges of this nature are prorates is even more
important when you are canceling a circuit. You need to confirm that the cir-
cuit is end-dated in billing so you receive a prorated charge until the circuit 
is deactivated. The fee should not appear on future invoices. If the people
responsible for processing the cancellation order and physically tearing
down the circuit aren’t talking to the people responsible for billing the 
circuit, you could continue to be charged for the circuit. 
Understanding installation charges 
for dedicated circuits
When you activate (turn up) a dedicated circuit, you usually are charged for
installation. You may see other nonrecurring charges associated with the
turn up. Keep your quotes, correspondence, and amendments that you have
signed to validate that they correspond with what you are actually charged.
These charges should appear on your invoice once and only once.
Try to get the installation fees waived if possible, or order your circuit when
the carrier is running a free installation promotion. 
Dealing with monthly recurring charges
for features and services 
This part of your invoice can drive you insane quicker than any other, whether
you have dedicated circuits or not. This section lists all the special features you
have on your phone lines or circuits. You may or may not even know that you
have these features, but you are paying for them. If there is anything in the sec-
tion that isn’t immediately obvious to you, do not feel bashful about asking your
carrier for an explanation of the charges and services. 
92
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

Check your contract to validate what recurring charges you should expect
and how they are to be assessed. If you paid $75 for DNIS fees on your dedi-
cated toll-free numbers, you may not remember that the fee was supposed to
be per circuit, not per order, per toll-free number, or per location. These tiny
distinctions can make a huge difference on your bottom line. 
Don’t continue to pay the $5.75 per month per phone line for the voicemail
service you canceled six month ago; open a dispute and stop the bleeding.
Price quotes for the access portions of dedicated circuits (also called local
loops) are generally only valid for 30 or 45 days. If you spend two or three
months negotiating the finer points of a contract, you may lose the pricing
you were quoted. Always get a new quote about the fees for your local loop
before you sign a contract for service. The new price may be lower, and you
could be pleasantly surprised. It is also possible that your carrier decommis-
sioned some of its hardware and the price jumped up by $150. Better to know
that now before you commit your business to a 12-month contract. If you
don’t know what a local loop is, see Chapter 8. For information about finan-
cial issues related to local loops, Chapter 2 is your destination.
Handling installation charges 
for features and services
When you add services, you probably have to pay a one-time installation fee.
Services that go along with toll-free numbers and dedicated circuits are the
most common to include installation fees, which can range from $1 per toll-
free number to $1,500 per circuit, and everything in between. You need to
confirm that all these charges match up with your contract to ensure there
hasn’t been a breakdown in communication or a typo. This is another section
of your invoice where you need your carrier on the phone to discuss what
you are paying for and how it matches your quotes. And these charges are
nonrecurring. After you pay them, they should go away.
Confirming that all the numbers 
listed are yours
While you are running down your phone bill, you should confirm that all the
phone numbers listed as the source of your outbound calls actually belong to
your business. The same goes for toll-free numbers on your invoice as well. 
93
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

You may think this isn’t much of a problem, but number confusion can
happen easily. All regular phone numbers and toll-free numbers have about 
a six-month cooling off period after they’re cancelled before they can be 
reissued. After that, a number can easily be reactivated. If the new customer 
uses the same long-distance carrier you had with that number, things can get
tricky, because your carrier may not have the number listed as blocked or
inactive in its billing system. The carrier sees new calls coming onto its net-
work from the number, so the carrier references it to your account and bills
you for the usage. Oops. Computer error!
Of course, the carrier isn’t in too much of a hurry to fix things. After all, at
least someone’s being charged for the calls. If you see old phone numbers on
your invoice, make a list of all the numbers that are not yours and dispute all
the usage. Taking swift, assertive action may motivate your carrier to correct
the issue quickly.
Analyzing other charges and discounts
If your business is a large telecom customer, you may have negotiated a
volume discount based upon your usage. Good job! Unfortunately, the down
side of this discount is the volume part. In order to receive the volume dis-
count, you’re contractually bound to make a certain number of calls per
month. 
Usually, you’re given a ramp-up period of 30 to 90 days so that you can get 
up and running. Consider this a grace period. After this period ends, you’re
charged a shortfall every month if you don’t meet your monthly commitment. 
If you have a volume commitment based on the aggregate usage for all of your
locations and your carrier doesn’t link them together in its billing system, you
could see a shortfall charge on the primary billing account. Alternatively, if
you meet the volume requirements, make sure that volume discount applies;
also make sure the discount corresponds with your contract.
Taking taxes into account
Everyone agrees that taxes need to be paid, but nobody can tell you with 100
percent certainty how much tax should be assessed on your phone bill. By
everyone and nobody, I mean all the people whose job it is to assess and col-
lect taxes for the federal, state, or local government. 
94
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

There are so many gray areas about what charges apply to what type of ser-
vice that we’re all functioning under a best-efforts environment. Everyone
tries hard to do the right thing, and most everyone has a headache. Here are
some general statements about taxes:
 Federal taxes apply to interstate and international calls.
 State and local taxes apply to local or intraLATA calls.
 Some taxes are based solely on the usage of a specific type of call. The
Poison control tax may only be charged on intrastate toll-free calls, but
the new city tax may only apply to outbound intrastate calls.
 Some taxes are based on a percentage of usage plus other taxes (yes, tax
on tax). Local taxes assessed on intrastate outbound calls may be
charged based on both the usage and (some or all of) the state taxes
assessed for the call.
 In some states, Internet ports aren’t taxed, but the dedicated circuit to
reach the port is assessed tax.
 . . . And it gets more confusing from there.
Ask your carrier for a list of the taxes it charges customers, as well as the
percentage used to assess each tax. 
Some cities and states are more heavily taxed, like Los Angeles, California;
some, like Las Vegas, Nevada, are taxed less. If you have a high phone bill,
shop around for different states where you can set up shop. If your business
pays $15,000 or $20,000 in taxes, and you can cut that cost in half, it may
make sense to move to the desert, especially if you’re in the business of sell-
ing air conditioning systems.
Negotiating the Best Makeup 
for Your Per-Minute Cost
You may be able to save a healthy percentage on your phone bill without
even changing the rate your carrier charges. All it takes is to tighten up the
accounting. To find this savings, you must first determine the following: 
 The minimum duration your carrier charges per call
 The number of digits in the rounding
 Whether you’re on a flat or tiered rate plan
95
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

The more you pay for your phone service, the more important it is for your
carrier to be exact when tabulating charges in these three areas. They may
seem like trivial details, but they make a huge difference on what you pay per
month.
Understanding call duration 
and incremental billing
Telecom uses two main call durations: whole-minute increments, or six-
second increments. The whole-minute increments are simple and make recon-
ciling your invoice simple. Every call is be rounded up to the next full minute
and charged at the rate you agreed to. Because there are no fractions of a
minute, there is no rounding, and all of your calls divide out to your exact con-
tracted rate. The downside of whole-minute increments is that most calls do
not end at exactly a full minute. For example, a call lasting a minute and three
seconds is billed out as a two-minute call. If you’re happy paying for 57 sec-
onds of a call you didn’t make, then whole-minute increments are for you. If
you work for a telemarketing company and most of your calls are 30 seconds
long, with each call being rounded up to one minute, you’re paying twice the
amount that you should.
The best option is negotiating with your carrier for six-second billing incre-
ments. This option breaks every call down to tenths of a minute and prevents
you from paying for an excessive amount of time that you didn’t use. You still
have a few seconds on each call that are added, but the net effect is minimal. 
96
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 
Telecom two-digit rounding may 
not be mathematical rounding
The world of telecom doesn’t always use stan-
dard mathematical rounding when rating phone
calls. If you should be charged $1.011 on a call,
your 5th grade math teacher would tell you to
round to the nearest penny, so the cost is $1.01.
The reality of it is that many telecom companies
with two-digit billing charge $1.02 for that call. 
Here’s the rationale for increasing what you pay
by a penny: No one can expect you to pay a half
of a penny for a call, and so why not simply
round the fee to the next penny?
If you only make five calls a month, this creative
math is not a problem. If you make 500,000 calls
a month, however, the pennies add up quickly.
If you cannot get four-decimal rounding from
your carrier, at least negotiate standard mathe-
matical rounding until you can find a carrier that
will give you four-decimal rounding.

Beware of the lure of billing units. Some carriers do not charge you in incre-
ments of seconds or minutes, but in billing units that do not correlate easily
into reality. If your salesman cannot explain the rates of your calls in one sen-
tence, avoid it.
One-second billing units aren’t necessarily better than six-second units. It
does seem logical that the more accurate your duration is recorded, the more
accurate your invoice will be. That is, unfortunately, only half of the equation.
In the end, your rate also depends on your decimal rounding. See the follow-
ing section, “Dealing with decimal rounding.”
Dealing with decimal rounding
If, as in the previous section, “Understanding call duration and incremental
billing,” you run a telemarketing business that makes many short phone calls,
you may want to negotiate a six-second billing plan so that your invoice is
more manageable. 
But wait — there’s more. You need four-decimal rounding. Many companies in
America have two-decimal rounding — every call is individually rated to the
nearest penny. If you have a dedicated circuit with a rate of three cents per
minute on calls and you make a six-second call, you should legitimately be
charged $0.003 — three-tenths of a cent — for the call. If you have only two-
digit rounding, you’re going to be charged a penny for the call. This does not
seem like much, but $0.01 for a0.1-minute duration call gives you a per-
minute rate of 10 cents. 
If most of your calls are of short duration, two-digit rounding can easily raise
the average rate you pay. Consider three- or four-digit rounding if you have
the option. If your calls are rounded to three decimals in a six-second call at
three cents a minute, you’re charged the correct cost at three-tenths of a
penny. Sounds good? The only problem with that is that most long-distance
rates are not in full-penny increments. Competition has pushed rates down so
that your contract for dedicated circuits may have a rate of 2.9 or 2.2 cents
per minute. When you’re dealing with 300,000 minutes per month, the differ-
ence in your phone bill between the two rates is $2,100. The only way to
effectively capture your rate of 2.9 cents per minute is to have every call
rated to the fourth decimal point. In this case, a 12-second call (0.2 minutes)
costs $0.0058, and your per-minute rate is intact. If this amount is rounded to
two decimal points, you pay about double for the same call. If you have a
small number of calls per month, and they are all of long duration, the digits
in rounding don’t affect your bill too much. But if you have a high volume of
calls under a minute, the cost savings through this one change could be 50
percent.
97
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

The savings you see don’t increase if you secure five- or six-digit rounding. At
that level, the amount of money is so small that it would take hundreds of
thousands of calls to add up to a dime of savings. If a carrier sales rep claims
that the carrier’s billing plan will save you money because it has five-digit
rounding, have the rep crunch the numbers to prove it to you.
Figuring out flat and tiered rates
Setting call durations to full-minute or six-second increments, as well as
ensuring that call rates are rounded to four digits can make a huge difference
to your phone bill, without technically changing the rate you pay per minute.
Well, you can negotiate your per-minute rate, as well. In the realm of call
rates, there are two methods: the flat, and the tiered.
 Flat rates: Simple call rates (also called flat rates) break your calls down
by type (intraLATA, interLATA, intrastate, interstate, and international),
and charge you a set rate for each category. The breakdown may even
be simpler, with one set rate for your in-state calls, and a different rate
for your out-of-state calls. If you have a flat rate of six cents per minute
for all in-state calls and three cents for all calls that terminate out of
state, you have nothing to confuse you. Whether you call a cellphone, a
phone number that belongs to the local Bell carrier in your area, a VoIP
phone or any other type of phone in your state, you’re charged six cents
per minute. This system makes life easy, but you may be paying more
than you need to for these calls. Flat rates are relatively uncontroversial.
 Tiered rates: Complex rates (also called tiered rates) are becoming
more and more common with carriers. Competition has forced the per-
minute rates for calls down, so the carriers have reevaluated how they
charge for calls. Every long-distance carrier has a contract with every
local carrier in the U.S. It may cost seven cents per minute to terminate
a call to a cellphone company, but it may cost one cent per minute to
complete to your local Bell carrier (Pacific Bell, Bell Atlantic, Bell South),
and maybe four cents to complete to a company that provides VoIP ser-
vice. Long-distance carriers now tier their prices accordingly. If most of
your traffic terminates to the local carriers with better rates, you could
save some money by going to a tiered rate plan. Conversely, if most of
your calls end up going to cellphone providers or competing local carri-
ers (CLECs) like MPower or Vonage, your costs could go up substan-
tially. Deciding on a tiered plan can be an arduous task. The following
sections give you more information to make your decision a bit easier.
Always check over your first invoice from any new carrier with a fine-toothed
comb. You may have spent a lot of time negotiating a better rate for an area
you call frequently, only to discover that the rate was never sent on to the
billing department. 
98
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

Knowing your tiered plan do’s and don’ts
Tiered rates sound great in theory, but the devil’s always in the details.
Before you sign on the dotted line, consider the following do’s and don’ts:
 Don’t get a tiered plan if you call a lot cellphones or CLECs. Tiered
pricing contracts commonly require users to pay a premium to termi-
nate calls to cellphones and competing local carriers.
 Do get a tiered plan if you call a lot of the local Bells. Tiered plans
commonly require users to have a high percentage of calls terminate 
to the local Bell carriers like Bell Atlantic, Nynex, Bell South, Qwest
(local), and Pacific Bell. Great, right? Well . . . read the next item in this
list.
 Don’t get a tiered plan if you don’t call enough local Bells. If you ter-
minate fewer calls to these carriers than the required percentage (which
varies from around 65 to 80 percent), you may face a substantial per-
minute or per-call penalty.
Do review your calls before you make a decision. Before you agree to a
tiered pricing plan for your company, make sure that you look at all of
your outgoing calls for a few months. Better yet, ask your carrier to ana-
lyze your traffic and determine what the net result will be. Ask for a
report showing the percentage of calls that fall into each tier, and your
aggregate cost per minute. It would be horrible to go into a tiered pric-
ing contract, only to find out three months later that your average cost
per minute went up five cents.
99
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill
Why tiered rates have become 
popular so fast (if you care)
Telecom customers have become very sophisti-
cated in the past ten years. Some customers
have advanced routing tables that look at every
outgoing call and send it out over the cheapest
route. This idea may sound great, but as these
new, technically advanced customers have
entered the market, they exploit any carrier they
can find with a flat-rate pricing schedule. As
carriers began charging anywhere between 3
and 9 cents to complete calls to cellphones or
competing local carriers (CLECs), these uber-
customers routed those calls to carriers with 21⁄2
cent per-minute flat rates. After a few months,
the flat-rate carrier would see a dramatic spike
in traffic to the expensive terminations and
would have to correct the problem or face
bankruptcy — and so all the carriers eventually
created their own tiered rate plans to stay alive.

 Do know the intrastate rates on calls. Around the year 2000, carriers
began to notice that their customers with dedicated circuits were
inputting origination phone numbers on their calls. If a telemarketing com-
pany in Texas was working a project for a customer in Florida, they would
list the client’s Florida phone number as their caller ID. This enabled the
people who received the telemarketing calls to contact the Florida busi-
ness that hired the telemarketing company in Texas. A good idea, really —
it made the Florida business look really snazzy. The only problem was
that the local carrier in Florida saw the calls as having Florida origina-
tion numbers, and Florida termination numbers. In the eyes of Bell South,
that made it an intrastate call, so they charged the carrier 14 cents per
minute to terminate the call. Usually, interstate calls cost two cents per
minute. As the carriers realized they were losing money, they put mea-
sures in place to pass on the cost to their customers. 
The moral of this story is that if your business has a direct contract with
a carrier and your phone system inputs a Caller ID number on your dedi-
cated circuit that does not represent your business’s physical location,
you need to check your phone bill. If you see summary sections for
intrastate calls in areas where your business cannot originate a call, you
need to take swift action to correct your billing. Your carrier may have
another billing plan available, or you may need to find another carrier
altogether.
Introducing OCN, the Rosetta Stone for tiers
Every carrier has its own system of grouping the local carriers into tiers. One
carrier may place Verizon in tier 3, while another may place them in tier 1.
Some carriers also assign tiers to each LATA, and some assign tiers only at
state level. One unifying thread enables you to make sense in a world that
lacks uniformity. 
An Operating Company Number, or OCN, is a four-digit number that the tele-
com world uses to identify a local carrier. Your carrier can provide you with 
a list of OCNs and their associated tiers. Of course, this information still 
doesn’t tell you how much money placing a call to a number in Maine at
207-224-XXXX will cost. To determine per-minute costs, look at the OCN tier
list provided by your carrier; find the OCN of the local carrier that provides
service to the number you’re dialing and identify the tier of the call. Then you
can determine the LATA of the same phone number, and then you are ready
to dive into the LATA-tier price list provided by your carrier. Clear as mud?
Your carrier should be able to provide a list of every area code and prefix
(that’s the first six digits in any domestic phone number) in the U.S., along
with their associated OCNs. If you have a large analysis you are crunching,
you need this information in a database or a text format. 
100
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

The OCN-to-tier list that your carrier gives you doesn’t include all the OCNs
in the U.S. If an OCN doesn’t appear on a carrier’s list of tiers, the general rule
is that the OCN is in the most expensive tier. Some carriers offer a disclaimer
to this effect. 
If you want to spot-check a few rates, you can visit a Web site to check indi-
vidual phone numbers. Follow these instructions:
1. Visit the Local Calling Guide at the Outsider’s Report Web site.
The Web address is www.localcallingguide.com. The Outsider’s
Report is a Web site that has provided telecom information in one form
or another since 1994. 
2. Scroll down to the middle of the page and click the Search AreaCode/
Prefix/OCN link.
The Area Code/Prefix Search page appears. 
3. Enter the area code in the text box marked NPA. Enter the first three
digits of the phone number into the text box marked NXX.
You can leave the other boxes blank.
4. Click the Submit button. 
The next screen lists all the information you need. The four-digit OCN is
cramped right before the name of the local carrier, but is easily visible. 
5. Write down the OCN and LATA for the phone number.
Be sure to cross-reference the OCN to the appropriate carrier tier with
the spreadsheet your carrier provided.
6. Write down the tier for the OCN and identify the correct rate per
minute you should be assessed. 
Quickly dividing the cost of the call by the total number of minutes gives
you the contracted rate. If the numbers don’t match, call your carrier to
determine why.
Receiving Your Invoice Your Way
You can receive your invoice in any number of ways, and as your company
and your phone bill grow, you need to ask for your invoice your way. Most
carriers have at least two options for billing, and sometimes more.
101
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

Going old school with paper invoices
Most people and many businesses still receive their phone bill in the form of
a paper invoice that arrives in the mail with a remit envelope enclosed. The
bulk of your invoice consists of the itemization of every call made during the
invoice period. The itemization includes
 The time and date every call was made
 The phone number that received the call
 The duration of the call
 The cost of the call
The lines of data that describe the specifics of your calls are referred to in
the telecom world as your call detail record, or CDR. 
Having the best of both worlds 
with CD-ROM billing
When your phone bill has so many pages to it that it is thicker than an
unabridged dictionary, you should ask to have the section of your invoice
that individually lists your phone calls removed from the printed invoice and
sent to you on a CD-ROM. This format is better for large companies because
you can import the call detail from the CD-ROM to a Microsoft Excel spread-
sheet or Access database. Plus, it saves paper. 
After you’ve entered all the call information into a database, you can manipu-
late the calls to find a cost per minute on each call, sort the calls by area
code, cost, date, time, or view the information however you choose. 
CD-ROM billing isn’t a free service with all carriers. The fee is generally not
that expensive, and well worth the benefit of having all the data of your
phone bill at your fingertips.
Getting digital with online billing
Many new carriers have elaborate Web sites that enable you to sign up for
new services, make changes to your account, and see your invoice. If you’re 
a techie-minded person, this may be your dream come true. Some carriers
even have real-time invoice posting so you can see what your balance is,
including the call you just finished making two minutes ago. If this is some-
thing that excites you, you can easily find out whether carriers offer such 
102
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

services by checking the Web. Printing your invoice, or at least a summary
page, allows you to keep a record for posterity. Many companies provide PDF
versions of your invoice to download and save on your computer as well.
Knowing about Billing Issues
No billing system in the world is infallible. A billing system isn’t just the com-
puter that rates your calls and prints up your invoice. If you want to account
for every variable, you have to include every switch in your carrier’s network
that logs in calls and send them to be billed, as well as all the switches of the
companies your carrier contracts with around the world that do the same
thing. That’s not so easy. With that said, here are some specific annoyances
you should prepare for that won’t be very visible in the summary section of
your invoices.
Keeping an eye out for long-duration calls
Once in every ten million calls or so, a call doesn’t hang up just right. You
called a client and spoke to her for ten minutes, but the switch that recorded
the duration of your call never realized that you hung up. The industry refers
to calls that don’t complete properly as hung calls. They are generally very
easy to identify because they last, not hundreds, but actually thousands of
minutes. 
Some legitimate calls can last 400 or 500 minutes, but any long-duration call
needs to be investigated internally before you dispute it with your carrier.
Here are some legitimately long calls:
 The line may be used to transmit data for days on end with a dialup
modem. 
 You may have a problem with your automated phone system or calling
card platform that actually keeps calls open for thousands of minutes.
Unfortunately, that’s not a hung call — it’s your responsibility to both
pay for the call and fix the problem with your phone system.
The easiest way to tell a real, carrier hung call from a call that was legiti-
mately open for 1,000 minute or more is to check how many suspiciously long
calls you’re billed for in a six-month period. If you have two hung calls in the
same month, the problem is probably with your phone system, or the phone
system of whomever you are calling. It is statistically improbable that the
one-in-ten-million event will occur to you twice in the same month. You need
have your hardware vendor investigate your long-call phenomenon.
103
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

If you notice long-duration calls on your phone bill to people you don’t know,
this is a red flag that you may have fraud on your phone line. If you have a
very basic phone system, or none at all, someone may be tapping into your
line directly. If you have a dedicated circuit and a phone system with every
feature known to man, your whole system may be compromised. If this is a
concern for you, please check out the fraud section in Chapter 2.
Making note of duplicate calls
Duplicate calls are exactly what they sound like they are. The exact same call
is billed to your business twice. It takes a bit of skill to find out whether a
duplicate call is a legitimate charge or not, because most carriers have a
checking system to route out duplicate calls before they make it onto your
invoice. In order to have legitimate duplicate calls you must have two or
more calls that share exact matches on all the following:
 Date of call
 Start time of call
 Phone number originating the call
 Phone number called
 Duration of call
Just because you have two calls to the same number with the same start time
does not guarantee that you have duplicate calls, especially if both calls are
less than a minute in duration. Start times on calls rarely show the seconds,
so it’s technically possible to make two calls of eight seconds in length to the
same phone number within the same minute. 
The calls look like duplicates, but really, your employee got the voicemail 
of the person he intended to call, hung up, and absently pressed the redial
button when he meant to press another button on his phone. Realizing his
mistake, he hung up again when he received the voicemail a second time.
Presto! You have two legitimate calls in the same minute. 
Genuine duplicates usually appear in bulk. You generally won’t see only one
call affected, but an entire section of calls. Duplicates usually occur within a
date range or even within a few hours of the day, and you may see as many as
50 percent of the calls duplicated. You can easily identify duplicates because
calls of all lengths are affected. The moment you look at your bill and see two
calls that started at the same time, and each lasted an unusual length of time
(35.4 minutes, for instance), you know you have probably found a legitimate
problem. You should issue a dispute with your carrier. 
104
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

Handling overlapping calls
Overlapping calls are like duplicate calls in the fact that they can be legiti-
mate. If you notice that one of your phone numbers has a call that started 
at 12:10 p.m. and lasted five minutes, and the same phone number made
another call at 12:11 p.m. that lasted three minutes, you could have a 
problem. 
Your carrier will probably assert that you have three-way calling and that the
person who made both calls simply made a conference call. If that is true,
please pay your invoice and chalk up another important learning experience.
If your employees generally don’t use conference calling, you need to issue a
dispute and have the carrier look into the calls a little deeper.
Almost every phone in America has the ability to make a three-way confer-
ence call. If you ever hang up one call and immediately dial out again, you
may hear a special dial tone that is broken at the beginning called a stutter
dial tone. This is your local carrier alerting you to the fact that the next call
you make can be linked up to the last call you just finished. If you see over-
lapping calls on your invoice and they are legitimate, remember the sound of
the stutter dial tone. If you hear it, hang up and wait three seconds before
you dial again. After a few seconds, you hear the normal dial tone and you
have no chance for overlapping calls.
Watching for connect signal issues 
(especially on international calls)
A connect signal is a message sent through your carrier’s network when your
call is answered. A live person doesn’t have to pick up the phone for the call
to be answered; any answering machine or voicemail system will do. The
moment the receiving phone accepts the call, the connect signal is sent, and
when the signal is received by the network, your carrier begins tracking the
duration of your call so that you can be charged for it. Some carriers don’t
begin billing when the connect signal is sent through the network, but
instead begin the clock as soon as you dial into the network. On a dedicated
call, you can begin to incur per-minute charges even if no one answers the
call. If your carrier seems to be charging your business for calls the instant
you enter into its network, you need to speak to your carrier and see whether
you can change your platform or move to a part of the network that bills your
business only at time of connection.
Incorrectly starting the duration clock on a call is more common on interna-
tional calls where your carrier has little leverage to correct or regulate when
105
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

the clock begins billing. Unfortunately, if your carrier cannot force the case
with whatever carrier it uses to make international calls, you have two
chances of receiving a credit for the 30 seconds extra: slim and none. This sit-
uation is only visible when you receive your phone bill a month after franti-
cally trying to reach someone overseas whose phone system is down (maybe
there was a big storm or some other natural disaster that affected phone sys-
tems). If you’re billed for the 15 calls you made for 3 days when the phone
lines were down in that country, you know that the phone company has been
skimming a little off the top.
Facing facts about old calls
Finding calls on your phone bill from a few days prior to your billing period is
pretty common. In fact, this is a normal occurrence, and usually you’re just
charged for the calls once. You can check your previous invoice and look for
the specific calls to be sure, however. If the exact calls also appear on your
previous invoice, dispute the charges. 
106
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 
Understanding why cross talk 
causes strange billing
Cross talk is the industry term for that weird
moment when you’re on a phone call and sud-
denly hear another conversation on the line.
Frequently, the other people cannot hear you,
even though you can hear them. This is the only
way you can legitimately have someone else’s
phone calls on your invoice without fraud being
the cause. Cross talk from your carrier is a result
of the insulation around the wires on your phone
line becoming thin, or missing completely, and
touching the bare copper wires of another phone
line. Along with hearing the conversations of
others, your phone may also ring even though no
one is calling you. 
What is essentially happening is you are (or 
the other person is) receiving the dial tone
transmitted for the other person’s phone line
when you make an outbound call. The dial tone
you hear is attributed to a specific phone
number within your local carrier, so by access-
ing someone else’s dial tone, the local carrier
bills the call to the other phone number. If the
cross talk gives someone else access to your
phone line, your long-distance carrier won’t be
able to prove it. Your carrier sees this call as a
normal, legitimate call from your phone. Take
care of this problem immediately with your car-
rier because it skews everything in the billing
world. Cross talk is very rare and your carrier
will not give you a credit for the calls unless you
can reference a trouble ticket you opened with
their repair department for the problem. 

Every evening at a predetermined time, every routing computer in every car-
rier network sends data for completed calls in the past 24 hours to a billing
computer. Domestically, this happens with monotonous regularity. If you
have calls that go to the Caribbean, Guam, or to another international desti-
nation, another day or two may pass before the record of your call is finally
sent to the billing center. This delay in relaying the call detail is what causes
old calls from up to seven days before your billing cycle to appear on your
invoice.
According to U.S. federal law, your carrier can’t legally invoice you for calls
older than 90 days. If your carrier forgets to invoice you for calls on a new cir-
cuit or toll-free number that you have owned for 6 months, the carrier can
only legally back-bill you for 90 days. Even if you receive an invoice with six
months of old calls on it that you have never seen before, you only have to
pay for the last three months. This three-month shelf life is known in the
industry, but because the carrier has nothing to lose by asking you to pay for
all the back traffic, the billing department will do what it can to get as much
money from you as it can. 
Handling Your Billing Disputes
When you review your invoice, you may find a few issues that don’t add up
right. Maybe that rate reduction for calls to Canada you negotiated didn’t
take effect last month like it was supposed to, or perhaps your carrier is still
billing you for the dedicated circuit you cancelled four months ago. Before
you rush to issue a dispute with your carrier, you need to know what, and
how, you can dispute.
Understanding your carrier’s process
Every carrier has its own process for addressing billing disputes. Before filing
a dispute, find out the procedure. Before submitting the dispute on the cor-
rect form and to the right e-mail address, ask about the timeline for resolu-
tion. The standard turnaround time on billing disputes is 30 to 60 days. I
would like to say this is a clean and efficient process, but I have seen the
process take over six months.
You can call a customer service representative at your carrier, but often all
you need to do is check your paperwork. Every contract for long-distance ser-
vice has a section regarding billing disputes. If you don’t have a contract for
107
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

phone service, you can usually find a similar section embedded within your
phone bill. And the general policy is often listed online, as well. Regardless of
where it lives, the section tells you all the logistics of the dispute process. In
particular, the information covered includes the following:
 The method for issuing disputes: Some carriers require you to submit a
dispute in writing, while others begin working on a dispute from a phone
call. Your contract may also stipulate the required supporting documen-
tation you need to supply before the carrier begins working on your
issue. Only after you supply the information can you get your dispute
into the system and get your credit rolling.
 A time frame for you to dispute charges: As a general rule, carriers only
allow a 30- to 45-day window to dispute any charges on your invoice.
After that time frame, the carrier can (and will) summarily reject any dis-
pute you submit, regardless of its validity.
 Info on whether you must pay a disputed charge: Your contract stipu-
lates whether you must pay disputed charges while the amount is in dis-
pute. This is an important detail, because you will be charged late fees
on the disputed portion of the bill if you withhold money when you’re
not authorized to do so.
Working the appeals process
If your dispute is legitimate and has been denied for some unfounded reason,
resubmit the dispute. The carrier surely has an appeals process, so if you feel
unjustly rejected, restate your case. Accepting the fact that some of your dis-
putes will be rejected is healthy, because you may be unaware of contract
details hammered out, or overlooked by, your boss. Graciously understand-
ing the disputes that are denied also generates a good rapport with the dis-
pute department and ensures that credits flow smoother when they are
granted.
No matter what your carrier requires, however, you should always send dis-
putes in writing. You don’t have to use fancy calligraphy and secure the enve-
lope with a wax seal, but you need a paper trail if the dispute ever gets to the
point of mediation. When you document the dispute, listing as much informa-
tion as possible is important; detailed information can prevent delays, and, of
course, delays just perpetuate problems.
Instead of writing a letter of dispute, you could call your representative and
say that you think your interstate rates to Montana are wrong; the carrier
may make a good-faith effort to fix the problem, checking all your outbound
calls to Montana. Two or three months later, the rep may call you back and
108
Part II: Reviewing Telecom Products and Prices 

say that he or she couldn’t find anything wrong. That’s when you review your
notes and say, that it was toll-free calls from Montana that have the wrong
rate. Get all the information in one place, in writing, the first time to prevent a
mountain of frustration later.
Tracking your disputes
Of course, I hope you don’t have multiple disputes with your carrier (if you
do, you need to start shopping for a new carrier), but it could happen, espe-
cially if you have complicated services and a large phone system. If you have
more than one dispute in process, you need to track them carefully. The car-
rier may aggregate disputes for the same issues that appear over several
invoices, or it may lump them together by month. The carrier may also lose
disputes that you submit. In the end, it is your business’s money at stake, so I
don’t suggest you rely on someone else to manage it.
Use Excel Workbook to track your disputes for the year. Make the first tab a
summary by month with cells aggregating the total dollar amount for dis-
putes by month. Itemize all of your disputes chronologically on the second
tab. The columns of information on the second tab should include: 
 Invoice date for the dispute: If you dispute rates on the July invoice and
your carrier checks the June invoice, well . . . that’s not very good.
 Dollar amount in dispute: The carrier needs to know the bottom line
you are expecting as a credit. Determine this amount on your own —
don’t wait for your carrier to calculate it for you.
 Specifics of the dispute: In a sentence or two, give the gist of the 
dispute for easy reference. For example, you might say, “Acme Corp. was
charged 14 cents a minute in July for outbound calls to Canada even
though the contract stipulates that all outbound calls to Canada will be
charged at a rate of 8 cents a minute.”
Keep this info short and simple. You have other documentation if you
really need to go into specifics, but on a tracking spreadsheet, you
simply need enough to jog your memory. 
 The date the dispute was submitted: Having this information in a sepa-
rate tracking document validates that you submitted the dispute within
the time frame required by your contract.
 Whether the dispute has been approved, denied, or remains pending:
You need to track the results of the process so you know which issues
are still open.
 Credit amount, if approved: A full credit is not always given, so you
need to track the actual credit amounts along with the amount in dis-
pute. Having this information in one place reminds you that you need to
pay the remainder that was not credited.
109
Chapter 6: Getting the Non-Accountant’s Guide to Your Phone Bill

Most carriers are relatively reasonable, even if the process is a bit arduous. If
your dispute is valid, you should receive a credit. If your dispute is valid but
it goes back farther than 30 days, your carrier has the discretion to ignore
the claim. Carriers often offer courtesy credits for issues that may not have
been their problem. They want to hang on to their business, and the best way
to do so is to keep customers happy. Keep this information in mind and you
will appreciate it all the more when a carrier bends the rules for you and
credits your account for the past six months; likewise, you will understand all
the better why sometimes a carrier has to hold firm and deny your claim.

M
ost of us don’t order new phone lines every month. They are generally
a lot like pieces of luggage in that way: you get some, you use them,
and you only buy more when it is painfully obvious that your current supply
isn’t cutting it. This isn’t very helpful because by the time you need more,
you will probably have forgotten what you did to order them the last time.
To avoid that stress, you need to understand how long it takes to activate a
new phone number, add or change the long-distance carrier on it, validate
the long-distance carrier you have on your lines, and cancel lines or service
when you’re done with them. This chapter guides you through the steps nec-
essary to do all of that, informs you about how to avoid pitfalls during the
process, and tells some other fun things you can do with long-distance car-
ries. If you have concerns that you have too many — or not enough — phone
lines, please take a trip to Chapter 2 for information on how to determine
what you need; otherwise, you’re free to forge ahead in this chapter.
Ordering a Phone Line
The world of telecom has two types of service, switched and dedicated.
Switched service is what you probably have at your house. If you don’t have
a phone system, but just have a jack in the wall and a phone number that is
assigned to it, you have switched service. These are the regular phone lines

(sometimes called POTS, or plain old telephone service) you use every day.
Switched service is so commonplace that when you think about phone lines,
you think about POTS. 
Ordering a switched phone line seems like a simple task. All you need to do is
pick up the phone and call your carrier to order one, right? Well, not exactly.
Not every carrier can give you a phone number. 
Need a line? Calling a LEC
You can only order a phone line from a local exchange carrier (LEC) like
Qwest, Bell South, or Verizon; competing local exchange carrier (CLEC)
such as Mpower; or a cellphone company. These companies have been
authorized by the U.S. government to distribute phone numbers. You can’t
order a phone line from your long-distance carrier because the long-distance
divisions of MCI, AT&T and Sprint are only authorized to complete calls sent
to them. The U.S. government has not given them the authority to deal in the
collection or distribution of phone numbers for their customers.
Calling your local carrier
If you have any phone service at all, you receive an invoice from your local
carrier every month for it. Having local services makes life easy when you
want to order more phone lines because you just have to call the customer
service number listed on your invoice and order them. 
If you have just paid your local phone bill and don’t have one handy, don’t
worry, there is still a way to find their phone number. If you have a regular
local carrier, like Qwest, Bell South, or Verizon, you can simply dial 611 to
reach customer service. Usually, this number is used for reporting trouble
on your line, but many local carriers have adapted it for general use. If you
call 611 and don’t reach an automated attendant system, asking you to
“please select from the following menu options” but instead reach a live
human, the rep who answers the phone will be more than happy to transfer
you to customer service.
If you do not have a standard local carrier like Bell South or Verizon, but
instead have a CLEC, you may hear any variety of recordings or responses.
In this case, you have about five minutes more research before you can call
them. Go to the next section and walk through the steps to find and contact
your local carrier.
114
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Finding out who your local carrier is 
If you don’t have a phone bill handy, and, for some reason, dialing 611 doesn’t
work, you can always dial the operator by pressing 0. Listen carefully, because
the operator will probably identify the name of your local carrier. The only
problem with this technique is that some local carriers contract out operator
services, so instead of reaching a local operator in your city, you may be
transferred to someone in the Philippines who works for a company that pro-
vides operator service to many local carriers. It’s possible that your operator
has no idea what the name of your local carrier is.
Don’t worry. If all else fails, there is a foolproof way to get a phone number
for your local carrier; it’s called the Internet. This is a simple process after
you connect to the Internet:
1. Visit www.localcallingguide.com.
2. Scroll down to the middle of the page and click the Search Area
Code/Prefix/OCN link.
The Area Code/Prefix Search page appears.
3. Type your company’s area code in the box marked NPA. Type the first
three digits of your company’s phone number in to the box marked
NXX.
4. Click the Submit button. 
The Search page refreshes and lists your company’s city, state, and local
phone carrier. 
When you know the name of your local carrier, you can find a phone number
for it by starting a search from www.google.com or www.yahoo.com. When
you visit your local carrier’s home page, you won’t have to look too hard to
find a Contact Us section and a phone number for customer service.
115
Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service
Getting local versions of long-distance companies
MCI, AT&T, and Sprint do have divisions that
provide local service that can give you a phone
line. You would call MCI local, AT&T local, or the
local division of Sprint in Las Vegas, Nevada.
This being said, unless your business has been
targeted by one of these companies, or you live
in Las Vegas, these companies probably can’t
provide you with anything other than long-
distance service.

If you move to another town, or across the country, you probably won’t know
who the local carrier is for your new house or business. No problem. All you
need is a phone number for any home or business within a five-mile radius 
of your new location. Plug the area code and prefix into the www.local
callingguide.com site and you can find out their local carrier. Because
local carriers generally don’t change within the same town, you have all the
information you need to order your new phone lines. 
Placing the order
When you call your local carrier to place an order for new service, you have
to navigatge through the maze of prompts. Eventually, you reach a nice
person whose job it is to take your order. If you have existing phone service,
this is generally a painless procedure. You’re asked to confirm your identity,
your address, and the billing name on your invoice. When the preliminaries
are over, you’re asked how many new phone lines you need, and then to vali-
date the address, the features, configuration (is the new number going to be
in a hunt group with your other lines or not?), long-distance carrier, and area
of coverage for your long-distance carrier. If you’re adding to existing service,
you should tell the agent to duplicate what you have on your existing lines.
Securing your phone lines 
with a PIC freeze
A PIC (primary interexchange carrier) freeze is a logistical security device. If you
tell your local carrier to place a PIC freeze on your phone lines, the carrier locks
your long-distance carrier on your lines and never changes it — until you per-
sonally call your local carrier, identify yourself, and have the freeze removed. 
Depending on the procedures your local carrier has set up for activating and
removing PIC freezes, you many be able to simply call your local carrier, or
you may have to fax the carrier an authorization. After the PIC freeze is
removed, your new long-distance carrier can send the local carrier another
order to convert your lines. I am sure you’re wondering why you would want
to go through all this effort whenever you want to change long-distance carri-
ers. Glad you asked.
The benefit of a PIC freeze is that it protects your lines from having the long-
distance carrier changed on it without your knowledge. In the industry, slam-
ming occurs when a customer gets a new long-distance carrier that was never
requested. PIC freezes are generally available for free from your local carrier,
and automatically reject any attempt to change the long-distance carrier
assigned to the protected phone lines. Carriers don’t offer account-level PIC
freezes, so your local carrier has to place a freeze on each individual phone
line you have to ensure that they are all protected.
116
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

You may have to place PIC freezes on both intraLATA and interLATA lines,
because carriers usually handle them seperately. If you place a freeze on
only interLATA long-distance lines, you could have a long-distance carrier
slam your intraLATA calls. Getting the freeze is fast, free, and easy, so place a
freeze on all of your lines, and both the intraLATA and the interLATA options.
Understanding and recovering 
from being slammed
When your phone line is slammed, it is not always done intentionally. Quite
often, it is the result of a typo on the part of someone at the carrier or one
of the carrier’s customers. Many companies have so many phone lines that
they don’t have a solid accounting of them. They may have 20 numbers in
sequence and think their last number ends at -2328. In reality, the group of
numbers may end at -2327. If the long distance carrier sends an order to
your local carrier for the complete range of numbers, including the extra
number (-2328), the actual owner of the phone number receives an order
for a new long-distance carrier. 
A similar typo could be made by an eyesore data entry employee in the provi-
sioning department at a carrier where the number -2341 was entered rather
than -2431. The advent of antislamming laws in the U.S. has created a large dis-
incentive for unscrupulous long-distance companies who used these tactics to
bring on new customers in the past. Now that sufficient legislation is in place,
the percentage of people intentionally slammed is very small, with the vast
majority being the unintended result of human error somewhere in the system.
117
Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service
Understanding your long-distance options
Your local carrier identifies two areas of cover-
age available for your long-distance carrier:
intraLATA and interLATA. IntraLATA calls, also
known as local toll calls or Zone 3 calls, cover
any phone number you dial that is over (roughly)
13 miles away but still located within your local
access transport area (LATA). InterLATA calls
cover any calls you make to phone numbers
outside your LATA. It is usually a better option to
have your long-distance carrier pick up both
areas of traffic, because your local carrier gen-
erally charges for the intraLATA calls based on
mileage. In other words, if you call to a phone
number 100 miles away, but the number is still
within your LATA, your local carrier may charge
you more than it would if you called someone 20
miles away. As a general rule, long-distance
carriers charge you a flat per-minute rate,
regardless of where you call in your LATA. If you
don’t make these calls often, how you’re
charged may not be much of an issue. Check
your last phone bill to see what your average
rate per minute is for these calls, and then
decide which carrier is better. If all this talk
about LATAs is making your head spin because
you don’t know what one is, please jump over to
Chapter 3 for a crash course.

You probably won’t simply wake up one day with an epiphany from the uni-
verse telling you that your long-distance carrier has changed. Most people
figure it out by either receiving an invoice from a new long-distance carrier or
discovering that all of their long-distance calls are suddenly blocked. As soon
as you realize something is drastically wrong, call your local carrier. When you
have a customer service agent on the phone, you should do the following:
1. Find out the name and contact number for the carrier that 
slammed you. 
This information is necessary so that you can call the offending carrier
and research what happened.
2. Switch your long-distance back to your old carrier. 
Your local carrier is the only company that can do this, but it doesn’t
keep a record of previous long-distance carriers on phone lines. If you
had a mainstream carrier like Sprint or MCI, tell your local carrier to
switch your phone lines back and you won’t have any more problems.
If you used a reseller or lesser-known carrier, you may need to call your
old long-distance carrier to send in another order to switch your lines
back.
3. After your phone lines are switched back, place a PIC freeze on all
your lines. 
Just because it has already happened once doesn’t mean it can’t happen
again. You don’t need the hassle — again.
4. Dispute all charges for calls that went across slammed lines with your
local carrier. 
In short order, the second you start the dispute process, you will proba-
bly be chatting with a representative of the carrier that slammed you.
This conversation will either occur because the carrier is responding to
your dispute of the charges, or because you directly tracked the carrier
down to discuss the matter. Unless the new long-distance carrier can
confirm (by confirm I mean prove) that you, or some authorized person
at your organization, requested that your phone lines be changed, the
slammer should credit your charges for long-distance service. 
The cost of paying for slamming fees for violating FCC regulations is
more than a few dollars, so it is in the best interest of the offending car-
rier to credit any charges and make the problem go away. If you have
1,000 minutes of usage to Dussledorf, Germany, or some other overseas
location, you may hear some resistance when you ask for a credit. The
truth of the matter is that you did make the calls, and they did complete
them. A strong argument could be made that they should receive some-
thing for the service they provided. In this case, the very minimum you
should negotiate from them is to receive a credit to adjust the rate they
charged to what you would have paid on your old carrier. 
118
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

5. Request a credit for the change charges. 
Your local carrier is going to charge you a few dollars every time it
changes your long-distance carrier. If the fee is $4.50 for every carrier
change, you may be hit with an $18.00 charge per line. That’s because
you have to pay four times; once to switch for your intraLATA calls to
the new carrier ($4.50), once to switch your interLATA calls to the new
carrier (another $4.50), two more times for moving them both back
(another $9.00). If you have ten lines or more that were slammed, you
should demand a credit for the change charges.
Planning for inside wiring
Your local carrier is only responsible for bringing your phone lines to the
minimum point of entry or MPOE (pronounced em-poh). If the main phone
closet is at one end of your building and the new phone lines for your fax
machines need to be run to the other end of it, someone needs to connect
the phone lines from the MPOE to the room where your fax machines 
are sitting. The section of wiring that runs from the MPOE to your phone
system or telephone is called your inside wiring. Your local carrier has a
set policy that stipulates whether it provides inside wiring, and how much
installing inside wiring costs. The local carrier may be more than happy to
provide the inside wiring, or it may have a blanket policy to only drop phone
lines at the MPOE. 
If you are a thrifty shopper, you should call your hardware vendor to install
the inside wiring and not use your local carrier. Your hardware vendor is
probably cheaper and more flexible, and it may be willing to do the work
when the timing is most convenient for you and your business (something a
local carrier cares very little about). If you do not have a hardware vendor,
look in your phone book under Telephone Equipment & Systems–Installation–
Repairing & Service. You can do an online search with these terms, along
with your city, to find a vendor. For example, if you’re looking for a vendor
in the Los Angeles area, open your Web browser and browse your way to the
Google home page. Type telephone equipment systems installation repair
service los angles and click the Google Search button. Any business listed
in the results should be able to give you a quote for running wire from the
MPOE to anywhere in your office.
If you aren’t a thrifty shopper, but like security, it is better to pay a little more
and let your local carrier run the inside wiring if that option is available. If
the local carrier installs the inside wiring, it probably also offers inside wiring
insurance. For a nominal fee per month, this insurance can save you money if
a technician has to be dispatched to your office on a trouble issue. If you’re
generally resistant to having your local carrier dispatch a technician to your
site because the fee the local carrier charges is about the same hourly rate as
a Ferrari mechanic, remember that having inside wiring insurance means you
shouldn’t care — the site visit is free.

Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service

Adding a new phone line to 
your long-distance carrier
At some time during the call to add your new phone line, you find out your
new phone number(s). Write down the number and then immediately give it
to your long-distance carrier. Although it seems logical that your local carrier
will tell your long-distance carrier about your new phone line, that is not
always what happens. 
Despite the fact that all carriers make their money by facilitating communica-
tion, you should never assume that your local carrier and long-distance carrier
have great communication with each other. Many scenarios could prevent your
long-distance carrier from knowing about a new phone line. If the number
assigned to your company isn’t in sequence with your other lines, the long-
distance carrier may not notice the addition. Or perhaps the new line is for a
new office down the road from your main office. If the new office receives its
own bill, the person doing data entry for your local carrier may not make the
connection. Or maybe Mercury is in retrograde and the information just isn’t
flowing like it should. Blame astrological events. Blame the ironic forces that
make it possible for these companies to have vast communications networks
and still function in silos. Whoever or whatever you blame, just make the call
to your long-distance carier and tie up the loose ends.
Dealing with a screw-up between the 
local and long-distance carriers
If your long-distance carrier doesn’t receive the information to add phone
lines to your account, you will suffer one of the following fates. Both fates are
equally painful, but easily fixed (they both — shock — involve calling your
long-distance carrier):
Fate number 1 — outrageous billing: If a long-distance carrier receives
calls from a phone number it doesn’t recognize, the carrier charges the
highest rate possible. You read that right. The dime-a-minute rate it took
you two months to negotiate isn’t applied to that new phone line. Instead,
your local carrier can bill you at the highest rate on record for the long-
distance carrier you selected. 
Symptoms: When you receive your invoice, you see that you are paying
75 cents per minute with a $2.50 connect fee.
Solution: Call your long-distance carrier and have it place that phone line
on your account. The problem is that the long-distance carrier may not
be able to make the rate retroactive and credit you for the difference on
the calls that have already been billed. You may be able to negotiate for
a credit, and if the contested amount of the bill is $5 or less, the carrier
120
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

may be agreeable. If you are asking for a rerate credit of $600 and you bill
out an average of $10 per month, you can expect some resistance. You
may be able to get some relief by escalating the issue to the supervisor at
your long-distance carrier, but be prepared for the long-distance carrier
to stick to its guns.
Fate number 2 — fraud block: Long-distance cariers have either an open
network or a closed network. If the network is open, anyone can complete
calls on the network, even if the caller doesn’t have a service contract
with the carrier. Without a contract, individuals are billed at the highest
rate possible, but the network will complete any call it receives. A closed
network is the opposite; it does not accept calls from just anyone. 
Symptoms: The only way you can complete a call on a closed network is
if your phone number has been placed into the long-distance company’s
system prior to making your first call. If you attempt to place a call on a
closed network, your call is rejected and your phone number is logged
into the system as a number that is restricted. Because the closed net-
work doesn’t have a billing reference or account set up for you, the car-
rier is concerned that you are going to run up a phone bill of thousands,
or hundreds of thousands of dollars, and then disappear. These preemp-
tive blocks, called fraud blocks, prevent this problem. Open networks also
have triggers for fraud blocks. You may be able to dial phone numbers in
the U.S. for months, never setting up a formal account, without having
any problems completing calls. Whenyou make two calls to any interna-
tional destination, however, your second call is blocked, and suddenly
you won’t even be able to make domestic calls. 
Solution: To remove a fraud block, call your long-distance carrier and
make sure that it has an account for the phone number that’s experienc-
ing the problem. After the account is updated to include the new number,
tell the service agent to remove the fraud block.
Changing Your Long-Distance Carrier
if You Have Regular Phone Lines
When you have established the phone service for your home or office, the most
common change is replacing the long-distance carrier. The long-distance per-
minute rate you signed up for years ago is probably higher than you can get
today, and so moving your service every few years can definitely save money.
For the sake of simplicity, I group all nondedicated phone lines into the category
of regular phone lines because the process to change long-distance carriers is
the same on all of them. Any phone line that doesn’t arrive into your office on
one big cable that your hardware splits out into some multiple of 24 phone
lines is, by this definition, a regular phone line. Regular phone lines have lots
of different names, according to your local carrier:
121
Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service

 Residential lines: This is more of a billing designation, but is a basic
phone line that terminates to a residence.
 POTS lines: I am not lying to you when I say that POTS means plain old
telephone service. It is a generic term for a regular phone line.
 1MB: This is a 1 Measured Business line. This term is virtually syn-
onomous with POTS, except that POTS refers to any regular line and
1MB refers to lines that specifically terminate at a business.
 Centrex/Centranet:These are special business lines with a wealth of 
features available on them.
 Switched lines: This is a generic term, like POTS, that referrs to any
phone line that isn’t running over a dedicated circuit.
No matter what you call them, the industry has a standard way of changing
the long-distance carrier on regular phone lines. 
Beginning the process
The first step in ordering long-distance service is filling out an application
for service with the carrier. The application includes a section that acts as a
Letter of Authorization (LOA). The LOA is the legalese that allows your long-
distance carrier to send an order to your local carrier to point all of your
long-distance calls to its long-distance network. In most parts of the U.S., the
moment an authorized person signs his or her name to the application or is
recorded on tape as agreeing to the service, the order is set and begins run-
ning through the system.
But if you’re a residential customer in California or Georgia, you must, by law,
complete a third-party verification (TPV) before your order can be processed.
TPV is an automated system that verifies new long-distance orders. Customers
must call the toll-free number, access the verification system, and give their
name, address, the carrier you want to change to, and phone number. 
Every carrier that provides residential service in California and Georgia may
have its own twist on TPV services, so you may be asked additional questions.
However, the general format is the same. As you are reciting your information,
the system tapes everything you say and sends the verification to your new
carrier so your order can be processed. In these states, this is a process that
every carrier must follow, regardless of their size or track record.
Understanding the timeline
When all the paperwork is complete and you are through the legal hurdles,
your new long-distance carrier has to submit the order to your local carrier
and then wait for a response. Your local carrier is the company that controls
122
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

all calls on regular phone lines, routing them to your assigned long-distance
carrier, so making sure the local carrier is in the loop is essential. You have
to wait about three to five business days for the local carrier to process or
reject your order. For information on rejection, see “Explaining your rejec-
tions,” later in this chapter. 
When the order is accepted, your local carrier assigns your new long-distance
carrier to your phone lines. From this point forward, your long-distance calls
are routed using the long-distance company’s network.
Explaining your rejections
If your order for long distance is rejected by your local carrier, all is not lost.
There is an industry standard for this process and some general guidelines to
prevent orders from dropping off the face of the earth. 
An order can be rejected for many reasons, and the industry has created a
series of four-digit codes called Transaction Code Status Indicators or TCSI
codes, to help relay the status of your order, including information about
whether it is confirmed (which means it was completed), or rejected (and
why it was rejected). Every local carrier has its own spin on the TCSI codes,
but some of the numbers are standard in the industry. Table 7-1 shows a
small section of TCSI codes and gives you a sample of what they look like.
The first two digits give you a general idea of the status of the order, and the
last two digits give you the specifics.
Table 7-1

Confirmed 
20-05

21-66
PIC Restricted (PIC Freeze)
22-15
Disconnected — Working Telephone Number Only
23-28
All Customer Information Changed
Table 7-1 represents an extremely small sampling of the codes that can
appear on a migration request for a new long-distance carrier. As you can 
see, the codes that start with 20 are completed; codes that start with 21
are simple rejections. Your order could be delayed or rejected for any of 
several thousand reasons. If your carrier already sees your phone line as 
disconnected (TCSI code 22-15) the carrier won’t change the long-distance
carrier. Similarly, if your company just merged with another company, and
123
Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service

your billing address and company name changed (TCSI code 23-28), the
order is rejected. 
When your long-distance carrier receives the TCSI codes, you may get a call
to confirm that the number is active, that there haven’t been any changes
placed on the order, or to ask you to remove the PIC freeze from your line.
Any rejections that occur delay the migration to your new carrier at least
three to five more business days.
Completing the move without 
rejections and other hassles
The easiest way to change long-distance providers is to call your local carrier
and request the new carrier. The process is called self-PICing your line because
you’re personally calling in to have your local carrier change your PIC (primary
interexchange carrier or long-distance carrier). 
The PIC, and sometimes called the CIC, for carrier identification code, is the
four-digit number that your local carrier uses to identify your long-distance
network. Table 7-2 gives you a glimpse at some PIC codes and the carriers
they represent.
Table 7-2

Call your long-distance carrier and ask for its PIC code before you self-PIC.
Every long-distance carrier has at least one PIC code, and you need to know it,
especially if you are changing to a lesser-known carrier. This isn’t because
changing your long-distance service to a lesser-known carrier is particularly
difficult for your local carrier than changing it to Sprint, AT&T, or MCI. The
issue is that the smaller companies evolve over time and are more likely to be
bought, sold, merged with other companies, and experience name changes.
Keeping information up-to-date isn’t always a local carrier’s first priority. 
If you call Verizon to self-PIC to Broadwing with a PIC code of 0948, for exam-
ple, your local provider may have the company name listed by its former
124
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

name, IXC Communications. Or if your local carrier was Bell South, Bell
South may have Broadwing (also known by its previous incarnation, IXC
Communications) listed as Switched Services. All three entities have the
same PIC code, but the list used by the local carriers to cross-reference the
code with the name may be years out of date, hundreds of companies long,
and sorted by company name, not PIC code. Knowing the right code prevents
most local carriers from searching for the PIC code on your behalf, and reduces
the possibility of errors. You can also give the local carrier options on names
so that it can validate the four-digit PIC. In the end, the incarnation of the
name they have listed doesn’t matter, as long as the PIC code is correct.
Some local carriers ask for a five-digit rather than a four-digit PIC code. If this
question is posed to you, don’t worry. Simply add 1 to the PIC code your car-
rier gave. For example, if you’re switching to AT&T, instead of telling your
local carrier the PIC of 0288, simply say that it’s 10288.
Keeping bills within reason 
when you self-PIC
You need to be aware of a couple of potential problems so that you avoid sky-
high phone bills when you self-PIC:
 If you give your local carrier the wrong information, you risk being
blocked for long-distance service or being billed at very high rates.
If you make a mistake, the erroneous carrier you request will have no
record of the order and will charge you as much as it can. And because
you made the change yourself (you decided to self-PIC; the company
didn’t slam you), you don’t have much leverage to ask for a credit or
any leniency. The worst part about this potential problem is that you
will probably not see your first invoice from the new carrier for about a
month, by which time the damages could be substantial.
 Before you self-PIC to your new long-distance carrier, confirm that the
long-distance company’s network is set up to receive calls from you.
The exact same problems could crop up if you are self-PICing to your
long-distance carrier or if somehow you are sent to the wrong network.
The only benefit you have if you are billed at the maximum rates from
your carrier is that the long-distance carrier has a vested interest in
keeping you happy. If you chat with a representative of the new com-
pany, you may be offered a courtesy credit or a rerate.
Confirming your long-distance carrier
After you sign the contract with your new carrier, your contact at the new
long-distance carrier will certainly attempt to reassure you that in about
125
Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service

seven business days you will be enjoying the new lower rate. That is great,
but the timeline may not be met for one of a variety of reasons. Because you
don’t work for a carrier, you will not get to see the TCSI codes to check on
whether the order was rejected or completed. The good news is that you can
test your phone lines to confirm your long-distance carrier any time of the
day or night. 
A 700 test is an industry term that refers to dialing 1-700-555-4141 on your
touch-tone phone to determine long-distance carrier. The 700 test number is
a free call that directs you to a recording set up by your long-distance carrier
that simply says something like, “Thank you for using AT&T.” The test is 99
percent accurate. 
The 700 test only validates the long-distance carrier for the individual phone
line being dialed on. If you have 70 phone lines you want to check, you have
to manually seize each phone line and dial the 700 test number. There isn’t a
way to check a group of phone lines with this test. If you had an open order
to add voicemail to your main phone line, or to change the contact name on
the account, or any activity on any of your phone lines, the open order would
have blocked your line from being changed. This scenario is much more
common than you might expect, especially for large customers, to find a hand-
ful of lines that didn’t migrate to your new carrier for one reason or another.
The 700 test only validates the PIC your local carrier has listed for your
interLATA long-distance traffic. Some local carriers offer a 700 test for your
intraLATA PIC of 1-700-(your area code)-4141, but generally, you can only con-
firm the long-distance carrier for your interLATA calling. If you aren’t really
sure what intraLATA calls are versus interLATA calls, check out Chapter 3 for
the specifics.
Sometimes 700 tests do fail, but for the majority of people they work perfectly.
Some competing local exchange carriers (CLECs) like PAETEC or Mpower may
not provide the feature, but may instead send you to an automated voice that
recites the phone number you are dialing from. It is uncommon, but some-
times carriers that provide 700 tests may have conflicting information in their
systems; the 700 test may not be routed anywhere. When in doubt, call your
local carrier. Your rep should be able to validate everything you want to know.
Cancelling service with your old carrier
You have confirmed your lines are set up with your new carrier, and the 700
test says that you are on the new carrier, so you are done, right? Well, no. Now
you have to call your old long-distance carrier and cancel your existing service.
One section of the long-distance company may receive a report from your local
carrier that explains that you have changed carriers, but that doesn’t mean
that your old carrier has any incentive to stop charging you, unless you call in
and cancel the service. 
126
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

It is unlikely that your long-distance will change from your old carrier to your
new carrier at the exact moment that your billing cycle ends. You will receive
an invoice from both carriers for the same month you transition to the new car-
rier. It is important to check this invoice to ensure all of your lines in all of your
areas of coverage (intraLATA and/or interLATA) have moved to the new carrier.
You may receive invoices from your old and new carriers for the same month
at about the same time. Don’t worry; you are not being double-billed. Check 
the detail sections of each bill to see whether any of the calls overlap. There
should be a date when calls stop on your old carrier and start on your new car-
rier. If you see no obvious sign that the calls stop with the old carrier and begin
with the new one at around the same time, call your new carrier for help. 
Casual Dialing
The PIC code you give to your local carrier when you self-PIC also has
another use in the world of telecom. It acts as the basis of the dial-around
code you can use to force your call onto the long-distance provider’s network. 
Dial-around codes are the best gadgets in your telecom toolbox for switched
phone lines. They allow you to use a long distance carrier’s network even if
your local carrier doesn’t send your calls there by default. Dial-around codes
also provide you with alternatives if your primary carrier is having a network
failure. Dial-around code features do come with potential dangers, so read
the following section to understand the pros and cons of using them, and
then determine who in your office needs to know how (and when) to use
them. If information about the existence of dial-around codes falls into the
wrong hands, your business could lose a lot of money when the phone bill
arrives. But in the right hands, they can save your company a bundle.
Dial-around codes became popular in the 1990s when companies began mar-
keting that customers can simply dial 10-10-321 plus 1, and then the area code
and number to make calls at ten cents per minute, anywhere in the continental
U.S. As a result, dial-around codes are also known as 10-10 (referred to as ten-
ten) codes or trick codes. 
Casual dialing allows you to have all of your outgoing calls process by using
your normal long-distance carrier by default, except for the calls that you dial
with the corresponding 10-10 code. 
Understanding how 10-10 codes work
Dial-around codes override the routing with your local carrier. Usually, when
you dial a long-distance number, the call is transmitted to your local carrier;
the local carrier identifies the long-distance carrier for your phone line, and
127
Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service

sends the call off to the long-distance network. The 10-10 code stops that
process short. When your local carrier receives a call that begins with a 10-
10 code, it understands that to mean “do not pay any attention to the long-
distance carrier that is set up on this phone line; simply place the call on the
network with the last four digits of this 10-10 code.” If you dial 10-10-288 and
then a phone number, your local carrier ignores your chosen long-distance
service provider and sends the call by using the carrier with PIC 0288 (which
happens to be AT&T, in case you were wondering). A comprehensive list of
the PIC codes — how they look as dial-around codes can be found at Discount
Long Distance Digest, the Internet Journal of the Long Distance Industry (www.
thedigest.com/faq/picodes.html).
Calls placed with 10-10 codes are billed by your local carrier and itemized in
the long-distance section of your phone bill. If you casual dial using several
carriers, your phone bill will have sections for each casual dialing carrier, list-
ing some general contact information for the carriers and an itemized list of
individual calls made with each carrier in their network.
Benefits of casual dialing
Because casual dialing enables you to have calls routed to the long-distance
carrier of your choice, it gives you a lot of freedom. Some of the benefits of
using a casual dialing code are:
 You’re never without long-distance service. If you have a dial tone on
your phone, and your local carrier hasn’t placed any restrictions or blocks
on your line, you can use any carrier with an open network whenever you
want. When a large earthquake hit Northridge, California, in 1994, most of
the major carriers’ networks went down. Survivors of the quake who had
long-distance service with MCI or AT&T were out of luck — all outbound
calls failed to a fast-busy signal. On the other hand, the Sprint network
was still working fine. Individuals who dialed 10-10-333 for Sprint and then
dialed 1+ area code+ telephone number were able to contact loved ones
without a problem. Of course, those people may have been charged $3 per
minute for the call, but at least family members knew that all was well. 
Obviously, the practical applications of the 10-10 codes goes beyond nat-
ural disasters. You can always make calls on another network like AT&T
(10-10-288) or MCI (10-10-222) if your current carrier is failing. You will
pay more for the call, but at least you can make the call.
 No default taxes per phone line are charged to you by the 10-10 car-
rier. Because you’re using the service only when you want to, and on
only the calls you want, the standard fees assessed for having a phone
line assigned to a long-distance carrier don’t apply.

 Your local carrier doesn’t charge you to change carriers. You have the
benefit of placing calls by using another carrier, but don’t have to wait
for your local carrier to change the PIC on your phone line, and you
don’t have to pay your local carrier for the privilege.
 You can try it before you buy it. If you would like to move to another
long-distance carrier, but you have reservations about the quality of its
network, have the carrier set up your lines for casual dialing before you
authorize a full-fledged PIC. (The carrier’s technicians open the network
to receive and process calls from your phone numbers, but don’t send
an order to your local carrier to make any changes.) During that time,
you can make calls with their 10-10 code to your normal calling areas to
ensure that the quality is sufficient. This is a very useful suggestion if
your organization makes a lot of international calls. The international
platforms that carriers use can vary quite a bit, and you don’t want to
jump to a new carrier if there is so much static on the lines when you do
get through to Asia that it negates any financial savings you might gain.
 You can set up your phone line on more than one carrier. If you have a
great deal on your domestic calls with Qwest, but its international rates
are less than stellar, you can use another carrier for those calls. You need
to ensure that your backup carrier is okay being set up for casual dialing
only; but assuming that the second carrier doesn’t have an issue with it,
you can get the best of both worlds. After the carrier tells you the 10-10
code you need to use, and opens up its network to receive your calls, you
can instantly begin on the network. All of your domestic long-distance
calls are sent as usual with your primary long-distance carrier’s network.
If you want to make a call overseas, say to Germany, you simply dial
10-10-321 (or whatever the access code is) +011 49 and the rest of the
number, and the call completes by using your casual dialing carrier.
Making sure your casual dialing 
carrier is designated as no-PIC
When you speak to the carrier you want to use for casual dialing, you must
confirm that your system will be set up correctly. You don’t want an order sent
to your local carrier to change the long-distance on all of your phone lines. 
The casual dialing partner’s system must designate your numbers as no-PICs.
As long as the carrier you are speaking to provides casual dialing, the agent
you speak to should recognize the term no-PIC when you throw it around,
and understand that you don’t want your local carrier to have any formal
relationship with this carrier. Specifying the status of your relationship as no-
PIC ensures that your lines are open on the casual dialing carrier’s network,
but that they don’t disturb the configuration with your local carrier.

Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service

Avoiding the downside of casual dialing
Casual dialing offers quite a few benefits if you plan it out, research it well,
and use it wisely; but casual dialing comes with some challenges as well:
 You may forget to dial the 10-10 code before you dial the phone number.
The 10-10 code only works if you dial it before every call you want to make
on the casual dialing network. If you forget to dial the 10-10 code before the
phone number, the call defaults to your standard long-distance carrier.
 You may forget the 10-10 code and dial the wrong digits. If the 10-10
code you use is 10-10-345 and instead you dial 10-10-543, your call is sent
to another carrier. If the other carrier’s network is closed, your call fails.
If the other carrier’s network is open, the call goes through, but your bill
may be much higher for the call than you were expecting.
 You may have little (if any) customer service access. If you use a 10-10
code that was advertized on TV or the Web, you won’t have access to a
large support network. Who do you report trouble to if you dial the 10-10
code and your call fails, or has static, or you heard so much echo that you
have to hang up and call back using your regular carrier? Who do you call
to dispute your invoice if there is a 3-hour call listed on it from your phone
that overlaps 15 calls you made on the same line by using your primary
carrier? The support networks for companies that only provide casual
dialing access, and no other telecom services, is generally not as robust
as you will find with a mainstream carrier that also offers the service
along with other calling services.
Moving Your Phone Number
LNP stands for local number portability, and it is a procedure that enables you
to move your phone number from one local carrier to another. The procedure
came into being because people hated getting new numbers every time they
switched cellphone providers. After enough people got irritated, the U.S.
Congress forced the development of the LNP system. Now if you switch wire-
less providers, you can take your phone number with you to the new one. 
In the context of wireless providers, the LNP system seems like small pota-
toes. Now consider the fact that wireless providers also function as local car-
riers; you can move your phone number from local carrier to local carrier,
which is actually, well, big potatoes. 
Here is a real-world scenario that could happen today: You live in Charlotte,
North Carolina. You’re a busy executive, so on any given day you may be in
the office, on the road, or working remotely from home. You don’t want your
staff or associates to be forced to dial three different phone numbers to
reach you, so you decide to port your phone line to a competing local
130
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

exchange carrier (CLEC) that uses VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) tech-
nology to provide a find-me-follow-me service, completing calls dialed to one
phone number to multiple destinations. (I discuss porting in the following
section.) The increased functionality may motivate you to move your phone
line to the new carrier, and you may not even have to upgrade to VoIP phones
at your office. If you are interested in VoIP, please read more about it in
Chapter 15.
Understanding the Porting Process
Cellphone and wireless providers have been porting phone numbers for
years. In most cases, the process has become an efficient transaction that
may take as little as a few hours. However, it is by no means a seamless
process, and not without its limitations. If you want to port your phone
number from one local carrier to another, you need to bear these facts in
mind and adjust your expectations accordingly. Porting a phone number is
not always seamless, and you may have days, or weeks, during which your
phone number is completely inoperable. There are systems in place to
reduce the downtime, but downtime is always a possibility.
Porting your phone number is a lot like ordering new long-distance phone
service. You fill out an order form, agree to the terms and conditions, and
then sign a Letter of Authoriztion (LOA) to enable the new local carrier to
begin the porting process on your phone line. From that point forward, 
nothing is standard. Some of the issues you may face are:
 Your phone number is not actually portable. If the local carrier to
which you request to port your number has not been authorized to be
a CLEC in your state, it can’t port the number onto its network. Or, if the
local carrier to which you request the number be ported doesn’t have a
porting relationship with your existing local carrier, it can’t port the
number. Most carriers ask you to validate that your number is portable
before you begin the process so that you don’t find out this information
a week into the process.
 The time frame for completing the port varies. If the local carrier you
are moving to has forged a strong relationship with your old carrier, you
may have your number moved over in two weeks, with negligible down-
time. If your current local carrier is obstinate and doesn’t play well with
others, the process may take six weeks, and you may not have phone
access for three days of that time.
 You may experience an unfortunate name mismatch. If you submit a
request to port a number, and you list the name on the account as Bob
Smith, but your local carrier has the number listed under your wife’s
name Mary Mahoney, the porting request is rejected. You may need to
resubmit the port request under the name Mary Mahoney, or, if the
131
Chapter 7: Ordering Regular Phone Lines and New Long-Distance Service

name on your local carrier invoice is Bob Smith, send in a copy of the
bill to dispute the rejection. 
 The port request may be rejected because of a pending order on your
phone lines. If you ordered voicemail from your local carrier months ago,
and the order was never completed for one reason or another, any port
request is automatically rejected. Voicemail isn’t the only source for this
glitch; any open orders on your local service to add, change, or disconnect
a service, prevent your lines from porting. If the service is unnecessary, or
simply got lodged in the order system with your local carrier, a quick call to
cancel or accept the new feature is all it generally takes to cross this hurdle.
 The port request is rejected because you have a Centrex/Centranet
system. If you have any packaged business features from your local 
carrier, there may be limitations on what can be ported. Centrex and
Centranet products generally have a requirement that three lines must
remain active on your account for you to be offered the packaged busi-
ness services. You may be required to port all the lines in the Centrex or
Centranet group, or you may be able to port some of them — as long as
you leave three lines active on your old local carrier. You need to dis-
cuss the possibilities with your current and future local carrier.
 The port request may be rejected because you have nonportable 
services on your line. DSL is the main culprit in this group. If you port a
phone line that has DSL, either the port is rejected, or the port completes
but you lose your DSL service. You will have to call your local carrier to
separate your phone line from your DSL. Local carriers commonly allo-
cate a small section of their bandwidth available on the cable that sup-
plies DSL to be used for regular phone lines. Because your phone line
and DSL cable are connected on the same piece of copper wire, remov-
ing one of them potentially cancels the other service. Splitting the ser-
vices onto individual copper wires prevents the loss of Internet service
when your voice line ports away. If you have a distinctive ring, or some
other feature that may not be available with your new carrier, you will
have to decide to either lose the service or abandon the move.

You can use dedicated circuits for many things, including to aggregate
standard voice lines and to provide the access for your Internet connec-
tion. Similarly, dedicated circuits can terminate to your local carrier (for a
local dedicated circuit) or to your long-distance carrier (in the case of a long-
distance dedicated circuit). The process of ordering a dedicated circuit is
generally complex, but you can offload much of the process to your carrier
and hardware vendor. Even then, the process can be frustrating if you don’t
understand the steps involved.
Every carrier has its own timelines for ordering dedicated circuits, and delays
aren’t uncommon. Simple problems may slow you down by 24 hours, and large
problems can set you back several months. This chapter covers everything
you need to know when you order a dedicated T-1 circuit, and helps you know
what to expect so you won’t be surprised when your carrier quotes you 30 to
45 days to install a small circuit. You may need to order a circuit larger than 
a T-1 to meet your telecom needs, but in the end it all boils down to the T-1 
(DS-1) level circuit and the 24 individual voice channels (DS-0s) that allow
you to have a conversation. If you aren’t sure a dedicated circuit is for you,
brush up on the financial justifications for a dedicated circuit in Chapter 2.

Ordering the Circuit’s Configuration
Before you can begin to order your circuit, you need to know your circuit’s
configuration. A dedicated circuit must be built the same on your phone
system that it is on your carrier’s hardware in order to function properly. If
your hardware is set up to speak B8ZS/ESF line coding and your carrier is set
up for AMI/D4, you won’t be able to communicate. This is similar to a person
who only speaks Swahili trying to talk to a person who only understands
Russian. Until they are conversing in the same language, nobody will under-
stand anything. In the telecom world, you have to worry about the protocol
used to set up and tear down calls as well as the location of these messages
to allow your hardware to communicate effectively with the network.
To avoid having to understand this entire section on configuration, ask your
hardware vendor to fill out the technical part of your carrier’s order form. It’s
better to have someone who knows your hardware to fill out the form, than
to try to figure out the techie stuff and do it yourself. If you are replacing
existing circuits, ask your current carrier for your circuit’s configuration. If
you’re coming to the end of your term with the carrier and you’ve had consis-
tent problems for the past six months, the carrier might be suspicious that
you’re thinking of switching services, but the carrier should still give you the
information. Use the following sections to familiarize yourself with the infor-
mation your new carrier will need. After you have a general grasp of what the
new carrier needs, go through the technical worksheet and fill out what you
can. When you find a section you’re unclear about, ask the carrier for clarifi-
cation, and then pull the information from your hardware or your current car-
rier to fill out the section.
Every bit of the configuration is crucial when ordering a dedicated circuit.
The greatest challenge is that there aren’t standard package configurations
that everyone uses. The way your phone system is set up is uniquely tailored
to meet your company’s needs and limitations, the features of your phone
system, and the options available from your carrier. 
Speak with your hardware vendor whenever you think about changing your
carrier or your phone system. The hardware vendor can be a tremendous
help in determining the costs, timelines, and limitations of your system. 
Time division multiplexing 
and clock source
Time division multiplexing, or TDM, is a technology that enables you to take a
T-1 circuit that passes 1.54 Mbps and parse it out into 24 individual channels
of 56 or 64 kbps. TDM does this in a methodical and controlled manner so
that your carrier can decode and recombine data, using the same methodical
134
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

and controlled manner. This technology is quite complex, and makes up the
protocol for the vast majority of dedicated circuits used for voice calls in the
world. Fortunately, you only need to know the basics to use it effectively.
TDM is based on sampling small sections of phone calls very often. The easi-
est analogy to imagine is that there are 12 sets of people who want to have
conversations on the same phone line. In order to make sure everyone
receives equal time, a stopwatch dictates when each pair is given its turn to
speak. Because 12 pairs of people are speaking, each group can speak for only
five seconds every minute. As the hand of the stopwatch passes from 12 to 1,
the first couple has five seconds to speak. When the second hand passes 
from 1 to 2, the second couple has five seconds, and so on, down the line.
After you speak for 5 seconds, your phone goes dead until everyone else has
had their time, and then 55 seconds later, you can speak for another 5 sec-
onds. Figure 8-1 shows the five seconds you have to speak, before you have to
wait for the clock to return to the 12, at which point you get your time again. 
Asking people to speak for only five seconds per minute is impractical, so
the world of telecom speeds the process up. Imagine the stopwatch moving
faster. Instead of the second hand passing around once a minute, imagine the
stopwatch sped up to complete an entire cycle once a second. Now you have
to wait only a fraction of a second before you can speak again. The problem
is that you still only have 1⁄12 of a second to say anything, so your conversa-
tion would be very choppy and generally incomprehensible. The beauty of
TDM is that your conversation isn’t sampled only one time a second, but
3,000 times per second, so you have to wait only a few milliseconds before
it’s your time to speak. Because what you’re saying is being sampled and
transmitted so often, you don’t even know that 23 other conversations are
going on around you on the same T-1 circuit. However, both phone systems
still know who gets the correct timeslots; your hardware packages your call
in the correct timeslot and sends the call down the line to your carrier, who

Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

uses the same system to unpackage and combine your call on the other end.
This system allows everything to flow down the line without information
being mixed up or lost.
With a TDM system, your hardware has a clock, and so does your carrier.
The two clocks are perfectly synchronized (like two dancers) so that they
can both know when to begin and end a call’s timeslot. The system functions
like a synchronized waltz between the two pieces of hardware, and just as
with dancing, someone has to lead. Your carrier should always be configured
to lead, — to be the primary clock source — that dictates what the exact time is.
If you have multiple circuits from different carriers, you must confirm that
your hardware is capable of assigning the primary clock source individually,
on a per-circuit basis. Maybe your hardware is designed to handle multiple 
T-1 lines, but if it can’t identify more than one primary clock source for the
group of circuits, you face some pitfalls. If all of your circuits are coming from
the same carrier, this software configuration is fine, because all the circuits
will probably use the same clock source from the group. If you have circuits
from four carriers, each circuit needs to use the clock source from its own
carrier. If your card handles four circuits, yet pulls clocking from one circuit
and applies it to the remaining three, you will experience cumulative frame
slips and errors on the other circuits. The frame slips represent your hard-
ware failing to synch up with your carrier; this situation may cause echo or
static on your calls, or it may have no effect until the circuit is so far behind
the carrier clock source that the whole system crashes. After you restart
your hardware, everything will work just fine — for a while, until your system
falls behind and everything crashes again. The bottom line is that your hard-
ware must be able to handle a primary clocking source for every carrier. If it
doesn’t, and you want to use TDM, you’ll need to upgrade your hardware.
Line coding and framing
The line coding and framing of a T-1 define the overhead and useable band-
width available for each of the 24 channels. The overhead of a channel works
with the clocking and is responsible for the maintenance and housekeeping
on a call, including the call setup and tear down, ringing, and those fun
recordings that you get sometimes that tell you the number you have dialed
is disconnected or is no longer in service. The useable bandwidth is every-
thing left on the dedicated channel that isn’t overhead and is used to trans-
mit the speech in the conversation. There are only two options when it
comes to line coding and framing. You can have 
 B8ZS/ESF (which stands for Binary 8 Zero Suppression/Extended Super
Frame — say that five times fast). Traditionally, data transmissions are
passed across B8ZS/ESF circuits. These circuits have more useable
bandwidth and less overhead.
136
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

 AMI/SF (which stands for Alternative Mark Inversion/Super Frame,
sometimes also called D4/SF). Voice transmissions are traditionally
passed across AMI/D4 circuits. These circuits have less useable band-
width and more overhead.
As you can see in Figure 8-2, both T-1s have 24 channels, with the top shaded
portion identifying the overhead for the circuits.
The increased overhead on the AMI circuit allows for more of the bandwidth
to synchronize voice transmissions. Circuits that are used to transmit data
need less overhead, because any problem in transmission can be overcome
by resending the data. 
Ensure that you order the correct line coding and framing on your circuits.
If you are ordering a long-distance T-1 and AMI/SF is delivered instead of
B8ZS/ESF, correcting the mistake can easily take about two weeks. This is
because the local carrier that delivers the circuit has to physically show up
at your office to reconfigure their hardware. As long as the line coding and
framing are correct, you can generally change the lower-level protocols, such
as the outpulse signal and start on the fly when you activate your circuit. This
is generally not the procedure for most carriers, but, as long as you get a warm-
hearted installation technician on the line, you’ll be well taken care of.
Outpulse signal and start
The outpulse signal and start are two protocols working together to identify
how calls are initiated and terminated. The outpulse signal is used to set up
and tear down calls. The start dictates the required sequence of events. For
example, the start determines whether your carrier needs to wait to send
users a dial tone, or whether the carrier needs to send you a signal first to
acknowledge that users want to hear a dial tone. When you want to make a
call from your home, you pick up your phone, at which point a signal is sent

Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

to your local carrier to send you a dial tone. A few milliseconds later, you
hear a dial tone, press seven or ten digits, and your call is processed. 
In the world of dedicated circuits, you have options about how you request a
dial tone, and whether the overhead consists of a one-way or a two-way con-
versation. There are only three options for line coding and framing. See the
following sections for more information.
Loopstart
Loopstart is a protocol whereby the carrier is always waiting for you to make
a call. Loopstart is essentially a one-way conversation, but it’s an effective
and simple protocol.
Groundstart
Groundstart is another one-way conversation, but from the opposite end of
the circuit. In this case, you tell the network when you want to make a call.
It’s more of a command from your hardware telling the carrier “Hey, I’m
making a call, process it!”
E&M Wink or E&M Immediate
E&M is an old telecom protocol that stands for ear and mouth. It’s the only
bidirectional protocol of the group and has its niche in the telecom world.
Instead of receiving orders like groundstart or waiting for calls like loopstart,
the E&M protocol is like a constant conversation between your hardware and
the hardware of your carrier. It looks something like this:
Your hardware: “I’m going to make a call; give me dial tone.”
Carrier: “Okay, here is a dial tone.”
Your hardware: “I’m sending the phone number; do you have it?”
Carrier: “I got the phone number and I am processing it.”
Carrier: “The call reached the final office; I am sending you a ring tone now.”
Your hardware: “Okay, I got the ring tone.”
Carrier: “Someone answered the call; I will stop sending the ring.”
Your hardware: “Okay, the ring has stopped.”
Carrier: “I am sending you the conversation now . . .”
E&M protocol comes in two flavors, E&M Wink and E&M Immediate. 
 E&M Wink: You have the full conversation with E&M Wink. This might
seem chatty, but if you have toll-free numbers that are riding on your 
circuit, you might need E&M Wink in order to use all the information and
features sent in the call’s overhead. 
138
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

 E&M Immediate: If you aren’t using toll-free numbers, E&M Immediate
might be a faster and more efficient protocol. 
If your circuit will be processing calls for toll-free numbers that require
DNIS or ANI delivery, you must use E&M Wink. Groundstart, Loopstart,
and E&M Immediate don’t provide the bidirectional protocol required
to use these dedicated toll-free features. Other out-of-band signaling 
protocols provide DNIS and ANI delivery, but they have to be offered
as options on your hardware. Skip ahead to the section called “Feature
Group D” if you are interested in these other protocols. If you aren’t sure
what DNIS or ANI delivery is, Chapter 5 gives you all the info you need. 
Introducing trunk groups
Trunk groups are the contiguous channels within your dedicated circuits
that are partitioned off from the rest of your T-1. The trunk groups can split
a single T-1 into smaller sections, or they can combine several T-1s into one
large group. If you combine three circuits into one trunk group, you can then
receive calls on your toll-free number on all 72 channels just as you would
with one large circuit. If each T-1 has its own trunk group, your toll-free calls
can come in on only 24 channels; otherwise, you have to set up overflow to
the other trunk groups, which might cost more. 
Trunk groups only affect how your carrier sends calls to your circuit. If your
carrier splits your T-1 into 4 trunk groups of 6 channels each, your phone
system can still dial out on all 24 lines, in any order you want, without any
concerns. Because your phone system determines the channel you dial out
on, it isn’t bound by trunking parameters set up by your carrier. It simply
seizes whatever channel it wants and dials.
Because some trunk groups are large and cover multiple T-1s, there are 
standard ways you receive the calls within a trunk group. Your options are
as follows:
 Least Idle: In this case, the channel that has been active the longest
receives the next call. Call centers typically use this feature because
their fastest employees get more of the calls. Generally, this option can
overload a single port on your hardware and might result in failures, so I
don’t recommend it.
 Most Idle: This is a better scenario; the system sends the call to the
phone line that has been idle for the longest time. This type of routing
distributes calls evenly across all your channels, without burning out
one specific channel.
 Ascending: Calls are sent into your system in sequential order, starting
at channel 1, and going up to channel 24 (or the end of the trunk group).
The first channel on your circuit will probably always be active, because
139
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

this option continues to backfill the lower channels when they become
available.
 Descending: The opposite of ascending, calls are sent to your circuit in
sequential order, but this time starting with channel 24 (or the top end
of your trunk group) and on down. 
Try setting up your inbound calls by using descending and configuring your
phone system to use ascending for outbound calls. In this scenario, your
inbound calls are working down from channel 24 and your outbound calls are
hunting up from channel 1. This reduces your chances of glare, which is an
undesirable condition that occurs when an inbound call and an outbound call
attempt to seize the same channel.
Evaluating Out-of-Band Signaling
All the protocols mentioned previously are classified as in-band signaling,
because the overhead used to manage the call is located within the same
timeslot as the voice portion of the call. Refer to Figure 8-2 to see how each
channel has a section of usable bandwidth and a section devoted to the over-
head and maintenance of the call. 
Out-of-band signaling takes the overhead of each call, and, instead of using
space on the same channel as the voice portion of the call, it aggregates the
overhead on a single channel that might not be attached to your circuit. Out-
of-band protocols allow your phone system to receive additional information
on each call, or they may simply shorten the amount of time it takes to con-
nect a call. The information you require from your telecom service, the limita-
tions of your existing hardware, and the amount of money you can spend for
the features all define the best protocol for your company.
You have three basic options for out-of-band signaling in the TDM world,
each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Review them before you chat
with your hardware vendor to find out what it takes to integrate them in your
phone system.
Integrated Services Digital Network: ISDN
The Integrated Services Digital Network protocol, commonly referred to as
ISDN, is the most common out-of-band signaling option used at the T-1 level.
The protocol is standard on many new multiplexers and MUXing cards (such
as those made by Dialogic) that can be installed in a PC environment to per-
form the functions of a channel bank. The ISDN protocol provides a wealth of
140
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

information available on inbound calls, as well as detailed information for
your carrier on outbound calls. DNIS, ANI delivery, and ANI Infodigits are
standard features on most ISDN circuits. The reason that ISDN can provide
all this additional information on each call is because it uses an entire chan-
nel for overhead. Figure 8-3 shows you what the overhead looks like on a T-1
with 24 channels, one of which is reserved for overhead and identified by
shading in the figure.
All ISDN circuits should be provisioned as B8ZS/ESF at the line coding and
framing level, to allow you 64 kbps useable bandwidth for each channel. Most
carriers require you to order the circuit as B8ZS/ESF. It might be technically
possible to use the ISDN protocol with AMI/SF circuits, but it just isn’t done.
Understanding B and D channels
ISDN circuits consist of channels that transmit the voice portion of the call,
called bearer (or B) channels, and channels that just handle the overhead,
called data (or D) channels. In Figure 8-3, the 23 channels that are white are
the B channels; they transmit only the voice portion of calls. The shaded
channel is the D channel; it transmits the overhead for those 23 B channels.
This is a standard configuration for ISDN, with one D channel on the 24th
timeslot of every T-1 in the system. Sometimes people like to mix things up
and place the D channel on the first timeslot rather than the last one, but it’s
generally on one end of the circuit.
There is a lot of space on the D channel — actually more than enough space
to handle the 23 calls on a single T-1. To use the D channel’s space more effi-
ciently, you can use a single D channel to service multiple T-1s. Some compa-
nies hate losing an entire channel just for the sake of having a more advanced
protocol. If you can use that one channel for more than one circuit, the loss

seems somehow more palatable. You need to remember a few things if you
use one D channel for multiple T-1s:
 All the T-1s must be from the same carrier. You can’t bring in a pair of
T-1s from Sprint and another pair from Qwest and expect one D channel
to handle them both. 
 You need to confirm that your hardware and your carrier’s hardware
can handle the configuration. Talk to your vendor before you make big
plans.
 You can experience problems during peak calling times. Just because
the hardware says you can use one D channel for up to seven T-1s doesn’t
mean that doing so gives your system optimum performance. When you
push the limits of your hardware and try to handle too many circuits with
one D channel, your channels can lock up or disconnect, or you can
experience other quality and completion issues.
Choosing your favorite ISDN flavor
All carriers offer a handful of options when it comes to ISDN. Some call them
protocols, and some call them switch types. The bottom line is that you have
to set your hardware to speak the same ISDN language as your carrier. Some
of your domestic ISDN choices are:
 NI1: National ISDN 1 (Bellcore standard)
 NI2: National ISDN 2 (Bellcore standard)
 5ESS: AT&T standard
 DMS100: Northern Telecom standard
Your carrier might not provide every ISDN protocol listed here. If there is a
nuance that makes NI2 perfect for your business, be sure to confirm that
your carrier can provide it. Some carriers only offer NI1, and they won’t pay
to upgrade all of their switches when they are really waiting for NI3 to arrive.
You really need to conform to the preferred protocol of your carrier with
ISDN if possible, or choose a different carrier. The problems you encounter
if your carrier is using a less-preferable protocol may be much more
troubling than if you simply used your second- or third-choice hardware.
The ten-millisecond reduction in call setup or tear down time isn’t worth the
increased percentage of timing related call failures.
Using ISDN for telemarketing
You will want to change to ISDN protocol if your primary business is telemar-
keting. Recent federal regulations require telemarketing businesses to pre-
sent a valid Caller ID number when placing telemarketing calls. The ISDN
protocol enables you to select a phone number to use as your company’s
Caller ID. You can change the Caller ID number based on the calling cam-
paign, and can even display a toll-free number. 
142
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Currently, you can input only numbers, not letters, into the Caller ID field.
Federal law states that you must also list the company name, if your carrier
supports the service. The only problem is that no long-distance carrier can
support alpha characters (letters) in the Caller ID field. Anything the long-
distance carrier receives that isn’t a number is stripped when the call is sent
to the destination. 
ISDN users are frequently charged monthly fees based on the number of D
channels used. Every carrier offers different pricing, but watch for hidden
costs when using ISDN. Many carriers charge an installation fee and a
monthly rate for D channel cards. Ostensibly, the monthly charge is used
to recover your carrier’s cost to purchase D channel cards for its network,
but it seems more like a profit center. To give you an idea of what kinds of
charges you might see, your company can conceivably be charged $250 for
installation and $200 per month per D channel. If you have 28 T-1s, each with
their own D channels, you are looking at an installation fee of $7,000 and a
monthly recurring charge of $5,600. Um, did someone say ouch? Before you
order your ISDN circuits, check with your carrier about additional fees. 
Signaling System Seven: SS7
The Signaling System Seven, or SS7, protocol is the epitome of out-of-band 
signaling. The SS7 configuration is even more removed than ISDN, because
143
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service
A note if you already have ISDN service
ISDN was initially released, not in the full T-1
variety called PRI (Primary Rate Interface),
which is discussed previously, but as a smaller
service called Basic Rate Interface (BRI). The
service was developed and released to handle
the massive demand for desktop videoconfer-
encing features. The BRI service was much
smaller than the full T-1 version and consisted
of one D channel and two B channels. The ser-
vice was initially problematic, because the
available hardware was not very compatible
and installation was troublesome. The key sell-
ing point of the BRI was a feature called bond-
ing, which allowed users to combine both B
channels into a single 128KB path, instead of
existing as two individual channels with 64KB of
bandwidth. Users could even bond together
several BRI circuits to create a 256kbps con-
nection as well. Unfortunately, not many people
wanted to videoconference, and as DSL and
other technologies were released, BRI lines
became less popular. If you have a BRI line, you
need to know that most long-distance carriers
don’t support bonding; AT&T, MCI, and possibly
Sprint still offer this support, but who knows for
how long? If you have two BRIs and use your
256 kbps connection to transmit CD-quality
music from a microphone in Hawaii to a record-
ing studio in New York, that is great, but don’t
change your long-distance carrier unless you
know it also supports bonding. 

the SS7 link that handles the overhead is on a completely separate and
noncontiguous circuit. Figure 8-4 shows how the SS7 link is positioned in 
comparison to the circuit whose calls it manages. 
The main reason businesses use the SS7 protocol is because they need a very
quick connect time for all of their calls. In fact, telecom carriers and large
telecom customers often use SS7. If your business experiences an unaccept-
able level of latency on domestic calls, and you spend more than $50,000 on
your long-distance every month, it’s time to look into SS7.
Understanding how SS7 functions
The SS7 protocol is like having a scout when you are on safari. The protocol
reads the phone number you have dialed and runs out ahead of the body of
the call, checking the possible routes to get you to your destination. If it dis-
covers an outage in Dallas, Texas, the SS7 link finds an open path through
Chicago, Illinois. After it finds an open path, the SS7 signal secures the path by
reserving timeslots for the voice path to travel. After SS7 establishes the path,
your call takes the road that was built, and the call is completed quickly.
All the work that SS7 does prevents your call from having to worm its way to
the destination through primary and secondary route paths, so your connect
time is much faster. The SS7 protocol also shortens the time required to tear
down the call after you hang up, so it’s more efficient on the front and back
end of the call. Did I mention that it’s fast?
Ordering up SS7 service
If you are interested in ordering SS7, you should first call your hardware
vendor to determine what it takes to integrate your system into an SS7 envi-
ronment. You then need to find an SS7 provider. Your carrier can give you an
SS7 connection to its network, and order the SS7 link to make it all happen,
but you still have to be able to accept the SS7 configuration on your phone
system. Unless you want to order more than $20,000 in hardware and keep an
SS7 tech on staff at all times, you’ll need to hire an outside company to care
for your SS7 connection. It’s best to begin the search for an SS7 provider by
getting suggestions from your carrier.

Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

After you find an SS7 provider, the SS7 provider needs to give you some infor-
mation so that you can pass it on to your carrier and complete the order:
 The name of your SS7 provider: In order to coordinate your order for
the SS7 link, your carrier needs to know who you are doing business with.
This should be the easiest piece of information you have to provide. 
 The CLLI code of your SS7 provider: The CLLI (pronounced silly) code identifies
the physical address (in telecom terms) of the building that holds the SS7
provider’s hardware. For example, a CLLI code of LSANCA01 indicates
that your SS7 provider’s hardware is located in the 1 Wilshire Building in
Los Angeles, California. The SS7 provider should have no problem pro-
viding the information.
 The point code of your SS7 provider: Your SS7 carrier’s point code spec-
ifies the piece of hardware that will be receiving the SS7 signaling infor-
mation. Again, this is information that is readily available to the SS7.
 The TCIC range to use: The TCICs (pronounced tea-kicks; stands for
Trunk Circuit Identification Codes) range identifies the individual 
channels of your T-1 or DS-3 that will be using the SS7 link. 
After you have this information, you can submit your order, wait for your SS7
provider to install and test the SS7 link with your carrier, and then cut the
service onto your circuit. There are mountains of information printed about
SS7 and the specifics of the signaling protocol, but as long as you know the
previous information, you can order the circuit. After it’s installed, just keep
the SS7 provider’s number handy in case there is a problem and you need to
troubleshoot.
SS7 is a mature protocol used within the world of telecom and has evolved as
a very stable and dependable way to transmit calls. If you would like more
information about SS7 signaling, please check out en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
SS7 for an in-depth review of the protocol and additional links to even more
information. 
Feature Group D
Feature Group D (FGD) is an older protocol that is generally used only when 
a hardware limitation prevents a business from receiving ANI Infodigits on
inbound toll-free calls. (Please scan the section in Chapter 5 regarding pay
phone surcharges if you are scratching your head about the true identity of
ANI Infodigits.) Your phone system might not be able to handle ISDN, or your
carrier might have a limitation in its overhead that prevents it from sending
ANI Infodigits. This is the only benefit of FGD, because it’s an older protocol
than ISDN, and it doesn’t use the standard touch-tone DTMF (Dual-Tone
Multi-Frequency) tones to send information. Instead, it uses an older 
145
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

multi-frequency (MF) signaling that takes longer to send and decode. A
simple domestic outbound call is sent through the FGD protocol as:
KP + II + ANI + ST + KP + 7/10 Dig + ST
In this equation, the abbreviations represent:
 KP: Kick pulse that initiates an FGD transmission.
 II: Infodigits (identifies the origination type of the call, such as pay
phone, hospital, prison, and so on).
 ANI: The origination’s phone number.
 ST: Stop tone that acts as an end notification in FGD.
 7/10 Dig: The phone number you dialed.
The sequence and length of the individual sections of the transmission can
vary, along with the sequencing of some portions of the information stream.
The MF signaling requires more time, so a simple domestic call might take
two or three times longer to send and connect using FGD than when using
loopstart. 
The overall age of the protocol and the many variations possible make FGD
a challenge. The sequencing for inbound calls on toll-free numbers can also
vary, so your hardware vendor must be familiar with your equipment before
you begin using FGD. Problems can persist on your circuit for days and weeks
if your hardware vendor is trying to solve the problem and master the proto-
col at the same time.
Feature Group D is a useful protocol because it allows you to receive ANI
Infodigits, but it’s more difficult to work on and it’s slower, so I wouldn’t 
recommend picking it as an option, and if you already have it, I would 
recommend moving on to something a little less cumbersome. I suggest
you use ISDN if you need to capture the ANI Infodigits on your inbound toll-
free calls. The hardware is easier to come by, as are technicians well versed
in the protocol.
Understanding Local Loop Pricing
After you have all the configuration information to order your circuit, you
should turn your attention to your local loop. The term local loop refers to
the copper wire or fiberoptic cable connecting your building to the switching
hardware of your carrier. The reason it’s called the local loop is because a
local carrier almost always delivers it. Even if you order a dedicated circuit
from your long-distance carrier, the carrier will still subcontract with a local
carrier to deliver the circuit to your hardware because it saves lots of money
by doing so. 
146
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Even the biggest carriers don’t have a battalion of technicians in every town
in the U.S. They also don’t have an existing network of cabling that connects
every business and home in every city. The good news is that the local carri-
ers are perfectly set up with the network and technicians to install local loops.
Because the long-distance carriers don’t want to rebuild the wheel when it
comes to local service, they simply contract with the people who are already
established.
A POP, or Point of Presence, is a building, or a suite in a building, where your
long-distance carrier houses its network hardware. If you wanted to physi-
cally lay your hands on the massive computer system that routes your calls
and generates call logs that spawn your billing, you need to visit a POP. A CO,
or central office, is the local carrier’s POP equivalent. The local loop of your
dedicated circuit terminates at the POP of your long-distance carrier (if
you’re ordering a long-distance circuit) or at the CO of your local carrier
(if you’re ordering a local circuit).
The first point to determine about the local loop is its cost. Your carrier should
provide you with a price quote for the loop, typically when you negotiate the
contract. If the contract procedure takes more than 30 days, be sure to get a
new price quote before you place the order. The cost for local loops fluctuates
over time and you might be looking at a loop that is $10 to $20 less than the
price you negotiated, or $100 more. It’s best to validate the price before you
get locked into a contract for 12 months. If the local loop is too expensive,
there are cheaper alternatives. 
Understanding the elements 
of local loop pricing
The cost of a local loop is based on three primary elements:
 The cost to terminate the circuit into your carrier’s network: This is
frequently called a chan term, short for channel termination. Basically,
you pay for the connection between your long-distance carrier and the
local carrier. If you order a circuit to your local carrier, you still pay for a
chan term, even though your local carrier is just terminating the circuit
to itself. Blame it on the profit assurance department working overtime.
 The mileage between the POP or CO and your building: Carriers use
this equation to determine this charge:
Rate x Mileage per channel x 24 = Local loop mileage
per T-1
Basically, the rate is determined by the mileage and based on an individ-
ual phone line. Because most people buy T-1s, the mileage then has to
be multiplied by 24 because a T-1 is equivalent to 24 individual phone
lines. The mileage is calculated based on airline miles (your sales rep
147
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

may say that the distance is measured as the crow flies) between your
building and the carrier’s POP, not based on the distance it takes to
drive between the two locations. That’s nice if there’s a big, impassable
mountain between your corporate headquarters and the POP.
 The cost to terminate the circuit into your building: This is the second
chan term that you are charged for. Whenever a dedicated circuit con-
nects into a carrier, either the company delivering your circuit into your
carrier, or your carrier who contracted with someone to pull the cable
from your office, is going to charge a monthly fee for the connection.
Investigating your pricing options
If you receive local loop pricing for a dedicated circuit that seems a bit high,
you have other options. You need to keep the local loop fee in mind when
you make your decision about which carrier to use. If one carrier charges an
average of 2.5 cents per minute for your calls, but its local loop fee is $1,250
per month, it might be cheaper to use another carrier that charges you 3.5
cents per minute but charges $250 monthly for its local loop. You simply have
to crunch the numbers to determine which scenario is cheaper. If you make
100,000 minutes worth of calls, you will save the extra $1,000 on the differ-
ence between the two rates. If the scenario is different and you only have
40,000 minutes, the $1,250 local loop fee ends up costing you $600 more at
the end of the month. 
When it comes to local loops, you do have a few options to reduce the cost:
 Find a closer Point of Presence (POP): Not only does your physical 
location affect the cost of the local loop, but so does the physical location
of the connection to your carrier. If your business is located in a big city,
there might be multiple POPs into which your local loop can terminate.
Usually, the automated pricing system for your carrier chooses the closest
POP, but it isn’t 100 percent accurate. If you have a ridiculous quote from
your carrier, you can ask the carrier to check out other POPs in the area. 
 Order the local loop yourself: You can call your local carrier, or other
competing local carriers, to receive quotes for the local loop. Your long-
distance carrier negotiated local loop pricing with the local carriers
quite a while ago. If your local carrier is running a promotion or special
deal on local loops, you might get a better deal if you order the local
loop yourself. You have to coordinate the connection between your 
local carrier and your long-distance carrier’s network, but this little bit
of extra work can save you money in the long run.
 Move your office closer to your carrier’s POP: This might sound like
an extreme measure, but if the main expense for your business is your
long-distance bill, it might be worth it. Depending on the nature of your
business, you could even go so far as to rent a suite in the same building
as the local carrier’s POP.
148
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Evaluating Your Local Loop Choices
You have three basic options for how you order the local loop portion of a
dedicated circuit. Each option has different benefits and drawbacks. The
best choice for your company depends on how much your business is based
on phone service, and the level of responsibility you want for ordering and
troubleshooting your circuit.
The three basic options for your local loop are:
 Have your carrier order the local loop. If you don’t have an in-house
technician and aren’t very comfortable with telecom, this is your best
choice. Having your carrier order the loop reduces your responsibility
for coordinating the order and troubleshooting the circuit. 
 Order the local loop yourself. If you are technically sharp and want to
be responsible for all aspects of the local loop, this is your best choice.
 Eliminate the local loop by collocating to the same building as your
carrier. Companies typically take this option when telecom is their 
business, and their employees work to take care of their phone system,
rather than vice versa.
Your interaction in the order process and the average time to completion
will vary depending on the option you choose. The same steps happen
during every ordering process, even though some of them may happen with-
out you knowing about it.
149
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service
Understanding the complexities 
of type 2 (and type 3) circuits
In a perfect world, you order a dedicated circuit
from your long-distance carrier, the long-dis-
tance carrier contracts with the local carrier in
your area, and the circuit is delivered. Local
loops set up like this, with only one local carrier,
are called type 1 circuits. Unfortunately, this isn’t
always how things play out. Sometimes, the ter-
ritory for your local carrier stops short of the POP
where your long-distance carrier is located. Your
local carrier then must contract with the neigh-
boring local carrier to connect to the POP in
what’s called a type 2 circuit. It can get even
worse if your long-distance carrier doesn’t have
the facilities available to receive the local loop
from the second local carrier, and has to contract
with a third local carrier (type 3 circuit). 
All these circuit types are relevant to you
because every time you add another local car-
rier to the loop, you can expect to add 15 days to
the installation date of your circuit. Every car-
rier adds more possibility for error in provision-
ing the circuit, because the order now must run
through another company’s order system. And,
of course, there’s always the ka-ching factor: a
higher local loop cost per month, and more dif-
ficulty if you ever have to troubleshoot the cir-
cuit. If you can avoid a type 2 or 3 circuit, it’s in
your best interest to do so.

Speeding Up Order Processing?
If your order is moving slowly, or if you’re under a time constraint, you might
be tempted to ask the carrier to expedite your order. Although this idea seems
good in theory, you need to ask two questions before you commit to expedit-
ing an order:
 How much is the expedite fee? The cost to speed things up can be any-
where from $500 to $5,000 per order, or per circuit. After you know what
the expedite fee is and the daily savings you expect when it’s installed,
you can ask the second question.
 What exactly do you get when the carrier expedites the order? Many
carriers won’t guarantee you anything more than increased visibility on
an expedited order. The manager or director of the provisioning depart-
ment is now aware of the order’s existence, and may move it to the top
of the pile for provisioning and design, but that’s hardly worth $5,000. If
you have no guarantee that the circuit will be installed any quicker than
it would be if you simply pick up the phone and make a nagging phone
call to the carrier every two days, don’t spend the money. A little diplo-
macy and persistence on your part can give the order the same visibility
by the upper management, without paying the expedite fee.
If you are ordering a long-distance circuit, the fee for expediting an order
doesn’t generally cover expediting the process at the local carrier level.
If you want a circuit expedited at that level, you have to open up your
checkbook — wide. Fees for expediting the process with local carriers
are generally much higher than those charged by long-distance carriers;
some carriers even ask for a blank check so they can tell you the fee
after the work is done. Like long-distance carriers, you’re given a rather
flimsy guarantee that the order will be pushed along, but you won’t see 
a commitment that your circuit will be installed a week, a day, or an hour
earlier than the carrier’s original estimate. 
The one point that both local and long-distance carriers commit to when
you ask for an expedited order is the fact that you will be charged for it.
Will the order actually be done faster? Who knows? All bets are off.
Ordering a Carrier-Provided Loop Circuit
The simplest order you can place for a dedicated circuit is one where your
carrier orders the local loop. After you fill out all the technical paperwork
and submit it, on average, the circuit is available for use about 30 to 45 days
later. Allow the order to chug through the system for three days before you
call your carrier to get an order number for the circuits. If, after three days,
the local carrier hasn’t generated an order number, the order might have
150
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

gone astray. You should correct this problem now instead of starting the
process over on day 25. 
Getting realistic when your 
order becomes a project
Set realistic expectations, and the second you hear someone say the word
project, take a deep breath. All local and long-distance carriers have cate-
gories for their orders. As an order becomes more complex — see the side-
bar, earlier in this chapter, “Understanding the complexities of type 2 (and
type 3) circuits” — it can be classified as a project. When an order becomes
a project, this is a Bad Thing, because the new title places the order under
greater scrutiny. More scrutiny means more layers, and more layers mean
more processes. More processes mean more time. If your order ends up
being handled as project, add 15 days to your expected due date.
Receiving a Firm Order Commitment
After you receive your order number, you should check on the order about
once a week to make sure that it’s on track. At this point, you are waiting for
the Firm Order Commitment (FOC) document; it tells you when your local
loop will be installed at your office and tested between your carrier and the
local loop provider. There is no industry standard for the design of the FOC
(pronounced either eff-oh-see or fawk) document, but it should list most of
the following information:
 The long-distance carrier circuit ID: This is the circuit ID written on
the circuit after the cables for it are installed at your building. This
number is the one piece of information that will be logged in at your 
carrier’s customer care center. If your circuit has a problem, you need
this number so that you can identify your circuit and troubleshoot it.
Keep this information readily available.
 The order number used by your long-distance carrier: After the wiring
installed at your office is connected and you activate the circuit, you
should mention this order number to cross-reference the circuit ID and
make sure everyone is working on the right T-1s. 
 The trunk group name(s) for your dedicated circuit: You need to know
this information if you ever add toll-free numbers to your circuit. Many
toll-free features are commonly installed in the trunk group, so your 
carrier won’t care about the circuit ID when you are adding toll-free
numbers. This info is also good backup to help your carrier find your
circuit if no one can find the circuit ID. 
151
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

 The billing ID code for your dedicated circuit (this may be your trunk
group name, or referred to as an Auth Code, CLLI CDR, or DL value):
Keep a list of these codes; if one appears on your bill that you don’t rec-
ognize, call the carrier to check on it.
 The name of the local carrier: Because your local carrier was con-
tracted by your long-distance carrier to help out, you should determine
who did the work in case you have a problem with your circuit. If your
long-distance carrier says it has isolated the issue to your local carrier
and has opened a trouble ticket with Bell South, but your FOC document
says the local carrier is Time-Warner, you can correct this issue quickly.
It’s better to validate this information five minutes into a trouble ticket
rather than after you have lost five hours.
 The local carrier circuit ID: Match up every local carrier circuit ID with
every circuit ID from your long-distance carrier. If the local carrier has to
be dispatched to work on your T-1s, the technician can instantly know
whether he or she is looking at the right one. 
 The plant test date (PTD): The plant test date, or PTD, represents the
date on which the local carrier plans to test the continuity of the circuit
with your long-distance carrier. This is generally about 24 hours before
the committed due date.
 The committed due date: This is the date on which the local carrier
agrees to have the circuit released to you for testing.
The date you receive the FOC document can be anywhere from two to ten
days before the wiring for the local loop is actually installed at your office
and tested for continuity. The term FOC is used so casually in the world of
telecom that people have blurred its meaning. Don’t expect to get your cir-
cuit on the date you expect the FOC document to be delivered. It can happen,
but it isn’t the industry standard.
Ordering a Customer-Provided Loop Circuit
A customer-provided loop identifies a dedicated circuit where you order the
local loop instead of having the carrier do it. You might have found a better
rate for the local loop through your sales rep, or you may simply want more
control over the order and the troubleshooting process. As you fill out the
order form for your carrier, you need to note the section devoted to the local
loop because it has about four questions that you need to answer. Your car-
rier needs to know the following:
 The name of the local carrier you are using: The local carrier you
choose might not have an existing relationship with your long-distance
carrier at the POP specified. Every long-distance carrier has only a 
152
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

limited number of cables allocated for connections with each local 
carrier. Your long-distance carrier could be out of available cable pairs 
for your proposed local carrier. You need to wait for new cables to be
installed or choose another local carrier to connect into your long-
distance provider.
Your long-distance carrier might not be able to use the local carrier you
have chosen. If you aren’t using a Baby Bell company or a standard
local carrier, your long-distance carrier might not have any contracts,
arrangements, or facilities allocated for the company you want to use.
Before you set your heart on using a local carrier to make the connec-
tion into the long-distance network, confirm that your long-distance car-
rier can use this company.
 Contact person at the local carrier: Someone at your long-distance
provider may want to chat with someone at the local carrier you chose
to work out the finer details of the circuit. Long-distance networks 
generally make you do all the coordination, because, after all, this is 
a customer-provided loop.
 Contact phone number for your local carrier: If your long-distance 
carrier is going to contact your local carrier for any reason, it needs a
phone number. Don’t expect the carrier to use it and cut you out of the
process (see “Ordering a local loop makes you responsible for it,” later
in this chapter). The long-distance carrier probably wants the number
on file if there is ever any trouble on the circuit.
 POP address or CLLI code: This is very important information. Carriers
have POPs throughout the U.S., and some urban areas have multiple
POPs. If you’re looking for a Qwest POP in Atlanta, Georgia, for example,
there are at least two locations you can use. 
When you list the physical location where your office is located, your
carrier provisions the loop out of the POP closest to that premises.
If two POPs are of equal distance from your office, you have a 50-50
chance that each carrier will choose a different location. The next
thing you know, your long-distance carrier has built a nice new circuit
from the Atlanta 2 switch and patched it into its network; meanwhile,
your local carrier has installed a nifty circuit to the Atlanta 1 switch.
The disjuncture can eventually be corrected, but you will have lost 
several weeks of provisioning time.
Request a POP list from your long-distance carrier before you order, or ask for
a price quote for your local loop. The document lists every POP your carrier
has, along with its physical location and the industry CLLI code. The CLLI
code is telecom shorthand for the physical location of the POP — every car-
rier can identify the POP by this code. Along with the address and CLLI code,
the list should also have a phone number for each POP that your local carrier
can use to determine the cost of the loop.

Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

Ordering a local loop makes 
you responsible for it
Only the company that is the end user of record is authorized to initiate trou-
ble reports on a dedicated circuit. If you order a local loop, your long-distance
carrier can’t (legally) initiate trouble reports with your local carrier for your
circuit, or speak to your local carrier directly about the specifics of your cir-
cuit. For this reason, you should order the local loop only if it makes a large
financial difference, or you are technically savvy. 
At the end of a frustrating day, a carrier may abuse the fact that it isn’t the
end user of record to pawn off a problem to you. This can devolve into child-
ish finger-pointing as each carrier maintains that a problem is someone else’s
responsibility to fix. For this reason, it’s easier to pay a little more money and
have your long-distance carrier order the local loop. Then if there is ever a
problem on the circuit, it doesn’t matter where the problem is located; your
long-distance carrier still has to fix it because it is the end user of record.
If you’re still reading this section, then you haven’t taken my advice and are
ordering your own local loop. That’s fine, too. After you have filled out and
submitted the order forms for your long-distance and your local carriers, you
have to let them do their work. Give them both about three days before you
follow up and ask for order numbers. As long as they each have order num-
bers for your job, everything should be flowing fine. 
Understanding the CFA
About 15 to 25 days after you place an order for a local loop, you should
receive the Carrier Facilities Assignment, (CFA) document from your long-
distance carrier. This document identifies the exact piece of hardware to
which your local carrier is to deliver your circuit.
The document your long-distance carrier sends you should actually be an
LOA CFA (Letter of Authorization Carrier Facilities Assignment). This document
doesn’t just tell you the specific piece of hardware to which your local carrier
is going to connect, but also authorizes your local carrier to enter the POP to
leave cables for your long-distance carrier to complete the final connection
into their hardware. The CFA lists the following information:
 The local carrier to which it has assigned the CFA: Look at this
section closely. If your long-distance carrier has the CFA directed to
ICG Communications and you are using Verizon, you might need to go
back and ask for a new CFA.
154
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

 The physical location of the POP, or the POP CLLI: This address or
CLLI code should match the address you sent to your local carrier when
you ordered the loop. If the address isn’t an exact match, have both car-
riers clarify the location. 
 The circuit ID of the circuit: The circuit ID on your CFA is the number
that your long-distance carrier will use to reference this circuit for as
long as you have it. You need this number if you make any changes to
the circuit, or if you have to open a trouble ticket on it. Keep this infor-
mation handy at all times. 
 The bay, panel, and jack into which your circuit will connect: This line
item of the CFA is the most important. As long as you have this line item
of text, you can send the order to the next step with the local carrier.
The specific information may look like gibberish to you, but to a techni-
cian with your local carrier it functions like a set of GPS coordinates.
 A small disclaimer that the CFA will expire in 30 days if it’s not used:
Nothing is forever, and the saying holds true in telecom as well. If you
don’t use your CFA in 30 days, it might expire and be offered to someone
else. This is important to remember when your local carrier is pulling
cable or installing new hardware before they can make the connection,
causing delays in your order. If you’re approaching the 30-day mark, try
asking your carrier for a few more days. If you’re looking at a problem
that is going to take 60 days or more to correct, you have to request a
new CFA when it’s closer to your expected resolution.
The CFA is sent to you only if you ordered the local loop. After you
receive the CFA, you should check it out, make a copy, and forward the
document on to your local carrier immediately unless there’s a problem.
The local carrier uses the information in the CFA to design its portion
of the circuit. Your local carrier can’t do any design work on the circuit
until it receives the CFA, so it’s important to get the CFA to the local 
carrier as quickly as possible. 
Understanding the Design 
Layout Record (DLR)
Your local carrier will take 2 to 15 days to design and construct its portion of
the circuit from the CFA you supplied. The time frame varies quite a bit with
all carriers. Smaller carriers can finish a design within 48 hours, but larger
companies have set procedures that lengthen the time it takes to do the same
thing. After the circuit is designed, your local carrier will send you a Design
Layout Record (DLR) document that outlines the circuit and all the pertinent
technical information about the local loop. 
155
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

At first glance, the entire DLR document might look like nonsense. If you look
hard enough, though, you find at least the following information scattered
somewhere on the DLR:
 The order number used internally by your local carrier: Your local
carrier generates its own internal order number for your local loop for
tracking purposes. The local carrier might also list the long-distance 
carrier’s order number, but that is simply as a cross-reference.
 The circuit ID used internally by your local carrier: This is the code by
which your local carrier refers to your circuit from the day you receive
your DLR until the day the circuit is cancelled. You need to keep this
number handy in case you change the circuit or have trouble with it.
The local carrier’s customer care rep will ask you for the circuit ID in
order to open up a trouble ticket.
 The CLLI code for the first local carrier CO to which your circuit ter-
minates: This code identifies the physical location of the local carrier
Central Office of your circuit before it reaches the POP of your long-
distance carrier. This enables your long-distance carrier to identify
with greater accuracy the cables that are placed at the CFA location.
 The CLLI code for your long-distance carrier’s POP: Confirm that the
CLLI is correct and that your local carrier hasn’t decided to take your
local loop somewhere it was not invited.
 The bay, panel, and jack from which the cabling will leave your local
carrier’s network: This is important information, because your long-
distance carrier may need to validate the cabling provided by your
local carrier to ensure it is plugging into the right CFA point.
 The plant test date (PTD): This is the date your local carrier is planning
to test the circuit with your long-distance carrier. 
 The committed due date: This is the date your local carrier expects to
have the circuit complete and ready for you to activate.
After you receive the DLR from your local carrier, you need to forward it to
your long-distance carrier. The long-distance carrier uses the information to
identify when your local carrier is going to finish its end of the circuit and
gives the long-distance carrier some indication of how the order numbers,
circuit IDs, or customer name may be written on the cabling provided by the
local carrier.
Using a meet-me room (MMR)
All large carrier hotels have a meet-me room that is either a suite or a com-
plete floor in the building. Abbreviated as MMR, this room acts as a general
156
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

cross-connect area for all carriers. The meet-me room looks like a zoo for
computer equipment with rows of locked cages containing servers and
switches of every carrier (local and long distance) as well as every colloca-
tion provider in the building, all flashing green, yellow, and red lights. If your
carrier is on the 13th floor and your collocation provider is on the 2nd floor,
you may be able to avoid paying for a zero-mile loop if both companies also
have a cage in the meet-me room. In this case, you should request a CFA from
your carrier at the meet-me room and let your collocation provider finish the
cross-connect. These are frequently the easiest and quickest connections you
can make to install a circuit.
The final connection of your circuit between your carriers is completed in
steps:
1. The technician from your local carrier physically drops 6 to 9 feet of
cable to the CFA point. 
2. The technician locates the cage identified in the CFA document, writes
down the circuit ID or customer name on the cable to tag it, and then
feeds down enough cable for the long-distance carrier to finish the 
connection. 
3. The technician from your long-distance carrier looks for the cable in its
cage based upon the information on the DLR and connects the circuit
into the assigned CFA point. 
Ordering a Circuit Without a Local Loop
If your business provides calling card services or telemarkets customers by
leaving a prerecorded sales pitch that sounds like a personal message on
people’s answering machines, you’re a great candidate for a direct connec-
tion into your long-distance network. The greatest portion of the monthly
recurring charge on a local loop is the mileage fee. To reduce the cost, you
can try to find a POP closer to your office, or you can move your office closer
to the POP. The ultimate cost saver would be to move your office into the
same building as your carrier so you don’t have to pay for any mileage. 
You don’t need to move all of your staff into your carrier’s POP — just your
phone system. As long as you can access your hardware remotely through
either an Internet connection or a simple modem dialup, and your business
model can support this scenario, you can save money every month in local
loop fees. Maybe once every few months you’ll need to visit your phone
system to give it a software upgrade or some maintenance, but as long as
you don’t need to have access to it every day, this is a great option.
Fortunately for you, there is an entire industry created to help you.
157
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

Introducing the carrier hotel
Every large, metropolitan area has a carrier hotel that houses POPs and
COs for almost all carriers, both long-distance and local. These buildings
are meeting centers for telecom connections; hundreds of thousands of inter-
carrier connections are made in them. Larger cities have several smaller car-
rier hotels in close proximity to the established primary building. The carrier
hotels not only house carriers, they also are the home of collocation companies
(also called colo providers), which exist only to give cheap carrier access to
companies like yours. 
It isn’t a good business decision to rent out an entire suite in a carrier hotel.
You don’t need all the space and you will still have to run cables to the floor
of your carrier, build a temperature-regulated server room, and install secu-
rity measures so people can’t access your hardware. In the end, all you need
is about 9 feet of rack space and some electricity, not 800 square feet and a
key to the washroom. The colo provider’s job is to provide electrical power
and enough floor space in their suite to install your hardware. The colo
provider probably provides you with either a secure cage or cabinet for
your hardware. This is the bare minimum that colo providers offer. Some
may provide maintenance contracts for your hardware, cabling service to
connect you to your carrier, and varying levels of climate control and battery
backup for whatever you install.
If you are planning on moving your phone system to a carrier hotel, think
nationally and factor in your rates and the taxes. A colo provider in Alabama
may have a better rate and the same access to your carrier that a carrier
hotel in Las Vegas offers. If most of your calls don’t terminate in Alabama,
you could save a lot of money as you are now charged an interstate rate that
is generally cheaper. You may also look at the tax rates assessed in different
states. The state tax on a colo space in Las Vegas, Nevada, is considerably
less than on a colo space in Los Angeles, California. 
Selecting a colo provider
After you settle on the carrier hotel to which you want to move your telecom
hardware, you need to find a colo provider in the carrier hotel that will house
the hardware. If you haven’t been working in telecom at that specific carrier
hotel, you probably don’t have any idea which colo provider is the best.
There are two resources that can help you with this quest: your hardware
vendor and your long-distance carrier. 
Your hardware vendor may have worked in the building before and has con-
tact with specific colo providers. If the rep from your vendor doesn’t know
of a colo provider there, perhaps you can ask the rep for referrals from other
vendors. If you are using a carrier hotel outside your state, your hardware
vendor might not have any leads for you. Before you turn to the Internet and
158
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

begin searching for colo providers, you should call your long-distance carrier,
who can also provide some referrals from its technicians who work at the
carrier hotel. A preexisting relationship between your carrier and the colo
provider makes the move that much smoother.
Every colo provider doesn’t have direct access to every long-distance and
local carrier. Some may specialize in connections to MCI and Broadwing only,
or a handful of local carriers. If you were referred to a company by anyone
other than your long-distance carrier, confirm that the colo provider can con-
nect you to the right network.
Colo providers have a variety of charges they can assess to you, aside from
rack space and power. You will see fees for any maintenance or troubleshoot-
ing that you want the provider to perform. Generally, the fee increases for
after-hours service, so the midnight installation you have planned on Saturday
(to keep your business running seamlessly) will cost twice as much as it would
if you did it at noon during a business day. Of course, if you lose three times
as much business because your system is down in the middle of a busy 
workday, you may be more than happy to pay the increased fee for after-
hours work. Check the complete list of charges for all of your prospective
colo providers before you decide on one.
Ordering the cross-connect
A cross-connect is the wiring that joins one carrier to another. If you are located
with a colo provider in the same carrier hotel that your long-distance carrier
provided CFA for, you don’t have a traditional local loop spanning between
your multiplexer and the switch of your long-distance carrier. All you have
to worry about is having the cross-connect installed. The process for order-
ing a circuit without a local loop is almost identical to ordering a circuit with
a customer-provided loop (see “Ordering a Customer-Provided Loop Circuit,”
earlier in this chapter). The main difference is that instead of passing CFA
information to a local carrier, you send it to your colo provider. 
Your long-distance carrier still needs to give you a CFA that references a sec-
tion of their hardware allocated for your local carrier. If your colo provider
provides the cross-connect, you may not be allowed access to the main suite
of your long-distance carrier, and the connection has to be made in a meet-
me room in the building. If the CFA provided was on the tenth floor of your
long-distance carrier’s POP, and now must move to the fourth floor meet-me
room, you may see some challenges. The cost of the cross-connect fee may
be more for a meet-me room than it is in the long-distance carrier’s suite.
You may experience a delay while the circuit is being designed with a new
CFA on the fourth floor. This effort may all be for nothing in the end because
your long-distance carrier may not have the CFA at the circuit level you require.
You may need a pair of T-1s, but your carrier can only provide DS-3 or OC-3
connections. 
159
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

Because colo providers are smaller than local carriers, they can usually act
on your CFA and return a design layout record (DLR) in about 24 to 48 hours.
That’s a pretty short time frame when you consider that a larger local carrier
can take weeks to dispatch a technician to your building to install the circuit.
If you have a long-standing relationship with the people who establish orders
at your long-distance carrier, you might be able to install a dedicated circuit
to a colo provider in as little as two weeks. 
Understanding the zero-mile loop
The entry points to a carrier’s network are very specific. Instead of going by
the street address of the building, the entry point is narrowed down by the
floor and suite within the building. For example, if your colo provider (on the
2nd floor) doesn’t have access to your carrier (on the 13th floor), someone is
going to pull cable 11 floors and into the suites. Your carrier can run the
wiring for you. All you have to do is ask for CFA on the second floor in your
colo provider’s suite. Because your carrier is coming to the colo provider,
and not the other way around, the carrier charges you an installation fee and
a monthly maintenance fee, just as if it were pulling cable to a building across
the street or 10 miles away. When cable is installed within such a small space,
it’s called a zero-mile loop. A zero-mile loop is a local loop that doesn’t leave
the building. 
If you set up a zero-mile loop, I recommend that you ask for a CFA from your
carrier and pay your colo provider to run the cabling; this option is generally
cheaper and quicker. 
Preparing for the Installation
Before your circuit is released to you, your long-distance carrier has to test it
to confirm that none of the wiring or cross-connects were forgotten when the
circuit was being installed. The final test ensures electrical continuity on the
circuit from the long-distance carrier’s hardware to the end of the local loop
where your CSU or multiplexer is plugged into it. After the carrier signs off,
you need to schedule installation of the circuits. However, before you do that,
there are two other issues you need to address: the inside wiring and your
cut sheet.
Inside wiring is just as important on a dedicated circuit as it is with a single
fax line. You need to ensure that all the required cables and wiring are pulled
to the room that holds your phone system. If you have any doubt about what
needs to be done to complete the inside wiring of your circuit, check out the
inside wiring section of Chapter 4.
160
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Creating a Technical Cut Sheet
Information is rarely where you want it when you need it the most during an
emergency. This is why you should draw up a technical cut sheet for every
dedicated circuit before it is installed. One week after the circuit is activated,
your CFAs, DLRs, and FOCs might end up in the basement of your building. If
the circuit fails, you have to run down and dig through the files to find the
information. 
The Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book contains a starter cut sheet to
help you organize the volumes of information about your dedicated service,
installation, features, hardware, and contacts.
Wouldn’t you rather have all this information gathered in one document so
you don’t have any confusion over who to call or what your circuit IDs are?
The cut sheet is typically a simple Excel spreadsheet with the following infor-
mation listed:
 Physical location of the circuit: You might have hardware in multiple
locations that you are responsible for maintaining. Without having the
address, you can end up spending two days troubleshooting the wrong
circuit.
 Carrier: You may have multiple carriers, as well as local and long-distance
circuits. An accurate report of which carriers you have for each circuit
prevents confusion when you issue change orders or open trouble tickets.
 Trouble reporting number for your carrier: Every carrier has its
own toll-free number for trouble reporting. If you don’t have to call the
number every few days, you will forget it when you need it the most. If
you keep the number on your cut sheet along with the other informa-
tion, you won’t have to chase it down.
 Circuit ID(s): These are the most important pieces of information you
are given. Any activity that needs to be done on your circuits will be 
referenced to either the circuit ID or trunk group name.
 Trunk group name: If your carrier is having difficulty finding the circuit
ID in its system, the trunk group name is the next best piece of information
available to clarify things. Not every document is 100 percent accurate,
and if your FOC or CFA was transposed when it was given to you, the
trunk group name can help your carrier find your circuit when you are
adding service or troubleshooting. 
 Account number: Some carriers require you to submit your account
number on any document you send that requests a change to your 
service. Some carriers issue unique account numbers depending on
the service you order from them, so you may have multiple account
numbers for a single carrier. Whatever the case may be, make sure
that you list all account numbers (associated with specific services, 
of course) in one place.
161
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

 Order number: If you are trying to place an order for a change of service
a circuit and your carrier can’t find the order by either the circuit ID 
or the trunk group number, try using the order number of the initial
installation — it’s a pretty solid backup for tracking down the circuit. 
I would like to say that you’ll never have to go this far to help a carrier
find your circuit, but it does happen at times.
 Local carrier circuit ID: You should be able to link every circuit ID from
the local carrier that installed your loop to the associated circuit ID for
your long-distance carrier. This is an especially important thing to do
when you have an issue with your long-distance dedicated circuit and a
technician from the local carrier is dispatched to correct it. The circuits
at your office may only be tagged with the local carrier circuit IDs. If this
is true, you need to know which local-circuit ID matches up with which
long-distance circuit ID or you might spend time working on the wrong
circuit.
 Local carrier trouble reporting numbers (611, toll free, and local
number) if you ordered the local loop: If you are the one who ordered
the local loop portion of your dedicated circuit, you need this number.
Ask for a toll-free number and a direct number for the repair department
of your local carrier. The division of your local carrier that handles the
troubleshooting of dedicated circuits isn’t a standard option in the car-
rier’s general directory. You may need to speak to someone in a special
division of business service, so you should get the number before you
install your circuit. 
If your long-distance carrier ordered the local portion of the circuit, the
local carrier won’t speak to you about troubleshooting issues. 
 Configuration (line coding/framing/outpulse signal and start): When
you test a dedicated circuit, you should, of course, identify it by its cir-
cuit ID and trunk group, but also by its configuration. If you have two 
circuits that use ISDN, and two that are plain-vanilla in-band E&M Wink,
you want to mention which protocol is associated with which dedicated
circuit.
 Trunk group configuration: Identify the hunting sequence of your
incoming calls, and how many T-1s or individual channels are in each
trunk group. The configuration of your circuits may change over time
as you upgrade your hardware, add more toll-free numbers, and your
company evolves. You should know the most recent incarnation of your
circuit so you don’t submit change orders based on a configuration that
was changed six months ago.
Of course, this means that you need to update your cut sheet every time
service, configurations, and protocols change.
 Provisioning contact names and phone numbers: If you need to correct
a provisioning error during the installation process or have to submit a
change order, these numbers are essential. The provisioning staff is also
162
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

useful if you have a trouble issue that you need to escalate to a higher
management level.
 Any special features on a trunk group: If you have a block on your 
dedicated circuit to prevent outgoing international calls, or if your car-
rier has applied special routing features on a specific trunk group, you
need to identify the trunk group with the special features. Later, if you
need to place an order to remove the international block or other fea-
ture, you won’t want to spend five days tracking down which trunk
group has to be opened.
 The date the local loop was installed and completed by the local car-
rier: This date tracks the life of your circuit so you know when the con-
tract term expires. The gestation period of a dedicated circuit may be
45 to 60 days before it is ready to process calls. This time is factored
into most contracts for dedicated service so that the 12- or 24-month
term actually begins on the date the local loop is installed and is ready
to activate, not on the date the contract is signed. Circuits could be
delayed by six months before they are installed, and your long-distance
carrier doesn’t want to be halfway through a contract period before
seeing any traffic on the circuit.
 The date the circuit was installed and accepted: This date tracks
the circuit and helps identify the date on which your calls should start
appearing on bills from your new carrier. If you have outbound calls on
your new dedicated circuit prior to that, you need to investigate further.
 A list of any toll-free numbers on the circuit: Be sure to keep a complete
list of all toll-free numbers, and make sure the list links the toll-free num-
bers with the trunk group (or circuit ID) to which they terminate. Also
have information about any overflow configurations that you’ve set up
for them.
 A list of special features on toll-free numbers, such as DNIS, ANI
Infodigits, and ANI delivery: If you order another circuit to add on to
your existing trunk group, you need to know the configuration so that
you can ensure the toll-free numbers coming in on the new span receive
the same treatment.
 The fees for your local loop or cross-connect: These fess include both
monthly recurring charges (MRCs) and installation fees. When you recon-
cile the invoice from your carrier for your circuit, you need to validate
everything you’re being charged. It is much easier to enter a list of fees
into one central document than to try and track them down 45 days
later when you receive an invoice.
 The hardware vendor’s name and contact information: Any changes
you make to your circuit may require your hardware to be reprogrammed.
You may also need to contact your hardware vendor if your carrier has
isolated an issue to your phone system. There are some phone numbers
that you can’t have listed on too many pieces of paper, and this is one
of them.
163
Chapter 8: Ordering Dedicated Service

 A section for notes: Every circuit has its idiosyncrasies. Be sure to make
note of anything that you believe might helpful at a later date. This sec-
tion might include the name and phone number of the technician at the
carrier that installed the circuit, or any confirmation numbers associated
with the installation. If anything was done out of procedure, note it here.
For example, maybe a protocol setting or other configuration change
(which would normally require a change order and ten days to process)
was made on the fly because your carrier was nice enough to make the
fix at the time of the installation. If something like this happens, by all
means, write it down in your notes. Sometimes special favors aren’t
completely documented by the long-distance carrier, and the “corrected”
(read “wrong”) configuration may be reset to the requirements listed on
the “initial” (read “wrong”) order. Making note of who helped you and
what was done will reduce circuit downtime later.
After you have transferred all the required information from the CFA and
DLR documents (if you ordered your own local loop) or the FOC document
(if your long-distance carrier ordered the local loop), your cut sheet is com-
plete, and you are ready to schedule the installation of your circuit. If any
of the information is missing from these documents, contact the appropriate
carrier to fill out the information. Any information missing in their documen-
tation may indicate that a portion of the circuit that is not complete, so vali-
date everything.
Every carrier has its own procedure for installing circuits, from allowing
you to dial up on the fly, to requiring you to schedule 48 hours or more in
advance to secure a timeslot. The entire installation process is covered in
detail in Chapter 10.

oll-free numbers are so familiar that we take them for granted. The truth
is that even though you may use them every day, you may not know how
they work and how they flow through the world of telecom. That’s okay. You
don’t need to know everything about how they work, but you do need to
know a few things if you want to install toll-free service for your business.
A dedicated toll-free number points into a dedicated circuit at your office,
whereas a switched toll-free number rings into a normal phone line like you
have at your house. You go through the same steps to reserve or migrate 
toll-free numbers from one carrier to another. 
The two toll-free phone options differ when it comes to the ordering process
and the available features. This chapter covers everything you need to know
about ordering dedicated and switched toll-free numbers; it also covers
migrating toll-free numbers from one carrier to another, and addresses the
interesting nuances of toll-free features. If you have general questions about
what a specific toll-free feature is, or if it’s something you might be interested
in using, please check out Chapter 5.

Reserving New Toll-Free Numbers
Requesting a new toll-free number from your carrier is typically a quick
and painless procedure. It might involve some very basic paperwork, or an
e-mail might suffice. Some carriers have a reservation desk you can call into
to reserve numbers. Regardless of the method for requesting new toll-free
numbers, the carrier will ask you for a couple of details. Specifically, carriers
want to know:
 How many toll-free numbers you want, and whether multiple numbers
should be in sequence (1-800-SMILEY1, 1-800-SMILEY2, and so on).
 Whether you have special requests. If you need a special prefix (800,
888, 877, or 866?) or a vanity number (1-866-SMILEYS?), speak up now. 
Requesting random toll-free numbers
Most carriers give you the option of requesting toll-free numbers by the first
three digits, so if you do have a preference, you can specify whether you want
an 800, 888, 877, or 866 number. After you place your request, your carrier
dips into the national 800 SMS (Service Management System) database and
reserve as many toll-free numbers as you need. (I talk about the SMS data-
base in Chapter 5.) It’s possible that some of your toll-free numbers will be in
sequence, but it isn’t very common. If you need a block of 10 or 15 consecutive
toll-free numbers, you are more likely to find them in the 877 or 866 prefixes.
After your reservation is complete, the carrier sends you a list of the toll-free
numbers assigned. You then have 30 days to activate those toll-free numbers
before they are released back into the spare pool in the SMS database.
Requesting a vanity number
A vanity number is a lot like a vanity license plate: You know it when you see it.
Any toll-free number that prevents you from simply requesting a random toll-
free number is a vanity number. Often, vanity numbers have repeating num-
bers, a special number sequence, or spell out a product or company name. 
Finding the right vanity number isn’t always easy. Understandably, the best
vanity numbers are already taken, so you may request a number only to find
out that it’s not available. In fact, all the good numbers in the 800, 888, and
probably 877 are taken. The likelihood that you’ll find an open number such
as TAX-1040, FLO-WERS, REFI-NOW, or any other buzzword is very small.
Because carriers have to check a national database before awarding you a
number (and this is a time-consuming process), some carriers limit the 
quantity of vanity numbers you can request to search per day.

Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Following basic vanity do’s and don’ts
If you are interested in a vanity number that spells something, here are some
helpful do’s and don’ts for finding an open number:
 Don’t try to fill all seven digits of the number with your keyword. You
have a better chance of finding a number if you have at least two digits
left as unrelated numbers. Instead of looking for PRODUCE, try a search
for corn, beets, or any four- or five-letter word that means the same
thing. There is only one toll-free number in each prefix that spells 
PRODUCE, and the likelihood is that someone already reserved it.
Don’t lose sight of the big picture. You can liken the craze for vanity
numbers to the frenzy for distinctive URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
during the dot-com boom of the 1990s. Companies dedicated entire
departments to finding catchy Web addresses that weren’t already in
use. Maybe if they’d spent as much time on making their businesses
viable, they would have survived. Keep this little anecdote in mind if you
have your heart set on a vanity number. People will call you (no matter
what your number) if you have something for sale that they want to buy.
 Do convert your letters to numbers before you send the request. If
you’re looking for the number that corresponds with PRODUCE, and you

Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service
Dealing delicately with RespOrg departments
The people who work in a carrier’s RespOrg
department are generally well insulated from
the rest of the world, and you may never speak
to anyone who actually works in this depart-
ment. I believe that many RespOrg departments
were born out of reaction and quickly thrown
together. Imagine the scenario: The carrier’s
executives are sitting around the boardroom
one day, thinking talking about their rate plans
and advanced data services when suddenly
someone asks, “What about the toll-free stuff?”
The room falls silent and the executives eye
each other. Quickly, they elect someone who
didn’t make it to the meeting (or worse yet, they
name the poor fool who asked the question) as
the new Director of RespOrg and then call the
meeting complete before breaking for lunch. 
I can’t say whether or not this scenario has
actually taken place, but I can tell you that the
infrastructure and flexibility you find in your car-
rier’s other departments is generally less robust
when you get to the RespOrg department.
Escalation is your best friend when you have a
problem with the RespOrg department. That is,
if you don’t get resolution to a problem, you take
your concern to a higher power. And on, and on,
and on, until you get the answers you need. As
you push up the chain of command, you will
eventually find someone who can either solve
your problem or who knows someone who can
solve your problem. Be mindful when you esca-
late your complaint that some people respond
better to kindness, and some only respond to
increasing levels of pressure. You may need
these bridges into the RespOrg department
again some day, so it is best not to burn them.

don’t care if it is an 800, 888, 877, or 866 number, you should send of
the request as 8XX-776-3823, not as 8XX-PRODUCE. There is always the
potential for human error when converting letters to numbers from a
telephone keypad. Don’t leave it to your carrier to make a mistake and
end up giving you a toll-free number that spells PRODUCK. If you con-
vert the letters to numbers, and check your work before you send the
request, you reduce the chance for errors.
 Do provide concise search criteria. Don’t send a vanity request, with 
no number listed, and just a note at the bottom of the form asking the
carrier to “please reserve a number that is easy to remember.” This
statement is very problematic. The main issue with this request is that
the national SMS database can’t be searched for 8XX-something-easy-to-
remember. Even if the carrier finds a number that is sing-songy or repeti-
tive, the number might be undesirable for other reasons. For example,
your carrier might think that the number 888-444-8244 is a great number
and easy to remember. That might be true, but if you are using the number
to market to the Japanese community, where the number 4 represents
death, it might not be well received. Similarly, a phone number that
starts with 666 might be easy to remember, but it’s not a good number
for a church’s 24-hour confession line.
 Do list your search as many ways possible. If you are looking for a
vanity number with the word corn in it, send the request as follows:
• 8XX-267-6XXX
• 8XX-X26-76XX
• 8XX-XX2-676X
• 8XX-XXX-2676
These options cover every possible configuration a toll-free number can
have with the word corn in it. You might receive a list of three or four
reservations for your number. After you review them, you can activate
the best one. This query method allows your carrier to execute a con-
cise search for your number, and gives you the greatest potential for
success.
After you have reserved your toll-free number, do not publish it until the
number is active and you have successfully completed a call on it! I cannot
stress this point enough. Everyone who handles your toll-free reservation
request has the potential to make a typo. If you haven’t released the number
to the public when you discover it isn’t working because someone trans-
posed a few digits, it isn’t a big problem. If you have the number printed on
50,000 calling cards and sitting in gas stations from Miami to Manhattan when
you discover the number was transposed, it’s a catastrophe.

Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Migrating a Toll-Free Number
Most companies do not order new toll-free numbers very often. If you are in
an established company, you might interact with your toll-free numbers only
when you move them from one carrier to another for one of the following 
reasons:
 To get a more attractive per-minute rate 
 To flee from bad service from your current carrier
 To gain access to more available features
The migration process is the same, regardless of the carrier you’re leaving
behind, the carrier you’re moving to, and whether the number is dedicated
or switched. It’s also a potentially frustrating and confusing time for every-
one, and not without its dangers. The following sections lead you through
the migration process.
Filling out the RespOrg LOA
The RespOrg LOA (Letter of Authorization) document, generally referred to
as just a RespOrg, is the most important piece of paperwork you need when
you migrate a toll-free number from one carrier to another. This form identi-
fies the toll-free number and all the pertinent information your new carrier
needs to request the number be released from your current carrier. Figure 9-1
shows a standard RespOrg form.
The RespOrg LOA form is very important; fill it out completely. There are key
areas of the form that need to be accurate; otherwise, you risk having your
release request rejected. Every RespOrg LOA form has the same basic sec-
tions, although some carriers don’t require you to list the ring-to number,
area of service, or if the number is switched or dedicated. The sections that
appear on every RespOrg LOA are as follows:
 Toll-free number: Simply list the number you want to move to your new
carrier. Be sure to use the correct prefix, such as 800, 888, 877, or 866.
 Current RespOrg ID: The RespOrg LOA document almost always has
an ID number on it, but it’s really not that important. The first thing your
new carrier will do when it receives the document is validate the current
RespOrg ID through the SMS database. If you know the RespOrg ID for
your current carrier, great; if you don’t, you can leave this one blank.
 Legal mumbo-jumbo: Every RespOrg form has its required quantity of
legal gibberish to protect your carrier if you try to take someone else’s
toll-free number or if the migration goes horribly wrong and the universe
implodes.
169
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

 Signature and date: This is probably the most important section of the
document. The name on the signature must match the contact name on
the invoice from your current carrier. If John Smith signs the RespOrg
and Mary Jones is the person your old carrier deals with, the release
request might be rejected. 
The date is also very important, because RespOrgs are good for only 30
days from the date they are signed. 
 Company name: This is the company name as it appears on the invoice
you currently receive from your carrier. If you have changed your name

from John’s Produce to Anderson Family Co-op, yet your carrier still
invoices you as John’s Produce, you need to fill out the RespOrg as
John’s Produce. It doesn’t matter that your company’s name has legally
changed. Until your name has changed in the eyes of your carrier, the
carrier will reject any release request from a company name other than
John’s Produce.
 Company address: If your company has moved yet your current carrier
is still sending your invoice to the old address, you need to list the old
address on your RespOrg. Whatever you send on the form must exactly
match what your carrier has listed for your billing address, even if the
information is wrong. Consistency is more important than accuracy.
Scheduling your migrations
It’s very important to schedule the migration of your dedicated toll-free num-
bers. The migration process is usually seamless for regular toll-free numbers
that don’t terminate to a dedicated circuit. As your new carrier updates the
national SMS database, all calls from that moment on are routed to the new 
carrier to terminate to your phone number. You won’t even know that anything
has changed. When migrating toll-free service for a dedicated toll-free number,
you have to be aware that the dedicated circuit must be installed before calls
can be directed to the number. You don’t want to put the cart before the horse. 
If you begin the migration process too late, the numbers can be rejected and
not be available when your circuit is activated. The industry standard for
migrating toll-free numbers is seven to ten days. This means that from the
day your RespOrg LOA is sent to your old carrier, the carrier has a maximum
of ten days to either release or reject the migration request. You may want to
pad that time frame by a day or two, if you have less confidence in your new
carrier and want to give the carrier some time to process the request before
it is sent to your old carrier. 
Submit RespOrg forms to your carrier on Wednesday or Thursday of the
week if you have any anxiety about your numbers being released. If you
submit the forms on Wednesday or Thursday, the seven to ten day comple-
tion time happens between Monday and Thursday. There is nothing worse
than finding a problem at 5 p.m. on Friday when the carrier’s support staff
has already gone home for the weekend. If there’s any potential for disaster
with your toll-free number migration, you want to schedule it when there is
the greatest number of support staff at your immediate disposal. 
Migrating too early
Don’t migrate toll-free numbers before they can be used! If you migrate toll-
free numbers when you begin your order for a dedicated circuit, they could
be released to you in seven days and then sit idle. While you wait for your
dedicated circuit to be completed (which might take over a month), the 
171
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

traffic for your toll-free numbers is still being sent over your old carrier. This
is potentially dangerous, because carriers commonly check their networks
once a month and disconnect any toll-free numbers for which they are receiv-
ing traffic, but don’t have RespOrg control of. If your dedicated circuit instal-
lation is delayed, and you wake up one morning to find that your old carrier
has canceled all of your toll-free numbers, you can ask your old carrier to
allow you to send traffic for another few days, or you can ask your new car-
rier to point the toll-free numbers to a regular phone line until your dedicated
circuits are tested and ready to go. 
Migrating too late
If you attempt to migrate your numbers too late, your dedicated circuit may
be ready for activation, but you can’t install it until your toll-free numbers are
released. If migrating the numbers slipped your mind, you have to wait an
additional seven to ten days before you can activate both your dedicated 
circuit and your toll-free numbers. If the initial migration attempt fails, you
will need that time to resolve the rejection and resubmit the RespOrg. 
Every time you submit a release request for a toll-free number, the clock starts
all over again. Even if you only have three days before your old carrier is sup-
posed to disconnect your dedicated circuit, releasing the numbers takes a
week or more.
172
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 
Understanding the migration process
In order to consider the RespOrg document in
context, you need to see how it flows through
the telecom universe to make everything
happen. Say you’re currently with MCI for your
long distance, and you are moving your toll-free
numbers to your new carrier, AT&T. 
 AT&T sends you a RespOrg LOA with its
company logo on it and legal mumbo-jumbo
that says you are moving to its RespOrg
code ATX01. You fill out the RespOrg form,
sign it, date it, and fax it back to AT&T.
 AT&T receives the RespOrg form, logs it into
the system, and then faxes it to the RespOrg
department at MCI.
 MCI receives the RespOrg form and checks
out all the information to validate the toll-
free number, the company name, address,
contact name, and signature. The good
people at MCI also ensure that the date on
the form is not more than 30 days old. If
there are no problems, MCI releases the
number to AT&T.
 AT&T now has RespOrg control of the
number in the national SMS database, but all
the calls to your toll-free number still route
through MCI. The calls won’t be sent through
the AT&T network until AT&T updates the
national SMS database to direct all calls for
your toll-free numbers onto its network. 
 AT&T updates the national SMS database.
All calls to the toll-free number now route to
the AT&T network and are directed to the
phone line at your office that you’ve speci-
fied should receive the calls. AT&T may
associate the toll-free number to a regular
phone line at your office, or to a dedicated
circuit you have ordered for the sole pur-
pose of receiving these calls.

Before you migrate a toll-free number to a new carrier, call your old carrier’s
customer service department and explain that you’re leaving. The carrier will
respect the heads up and the rep with whom you speak can let you know if
anything could hinder the release of the number. A good relationship as you
are leaving is helpful for everyone, because the world of telecom is very
small. In a few years, you might be using your old carrier again. 
Handling Toll-Free Rejection
Just because you submit a migration request doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed
that the number will be released. Carriers have your best interest in mind when
they scrutinize your RespOrg. For example, a company trying to migrate a toll-
free number to a new carrier might have written down your toll-free number in
error. It’s your carrier’s responsibility to protect your toll-free number from
being migrated against your will. Carriers also use the power to reject toll-free
migrations to hold your numbers hostage if you have a large unpaid balance.
A rejected toll-free migration forces you to begin the entire process over
again from scratch. When you receive a rejection, you must take corrective
action to resolve the issue, resubmit all the required documentation, and
wait another seven to ten days for the number to be released or rejected
again. The following sections list the common reasons for rejection, along
with some resolutions.
All-data mismatch
An all-data mismatch occurs when the company name, address, and contact
person listed on the RespOrg don’t match what the releasing carrier has
on file for the toll-free number. An all-data mismatch rejection is generally
caused by writing down the toll-free number incorrectly; it is much less
common for someone to list nothing but incorrect customer information. 
To fix the problem, check the toll-free number listed and match the company
name and address with what you have on the invoice from your carrier. After
you have confirmed all the information, refax the RespOrg LOA to your new
long-distance carrier along with an invoice from your current carrier that
shows the company billing name (with address) and the toll-free numbers you
are migrating (this might require sending two pages of your current invoice).
RespOrg illegible
When a RespOrg is illegible, you can usually blame the quality of the fax,
which degrades the more often it’s faxed from place to place (to your new
carrier, and again to your current carrier). 
173
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

You only need to fax your documents to your new carrier. It is the new car-
rier’s job to negotiate the release of your toll-free numbers from your old car-
rier. If any of the information on your RespOrg LOA is difficult to read when
your new carrier receives it, the form might be completely illegible by the
time it arrives at the final destination. If your toll-free numbers are rejected
because the RespOrg is illegible, complete the document again and print out
all the information. When you have a beautiful copy, fax it, using the highest
quality settings on your fax machine.
LOA is expired
If your RespOrg LOA was signed over 30 days before the date it is submitted,
you have to fill out a new form with a fresh signature and date. If you submit
a RespOrg form that is almost out of date, your current carrier might wait
for your LOA to expire before rejecting it. For example, if it arrives with 4
days before it expires, and the carrier has 5 days to respond, the carrier
can let the LOA sit for an additional 24 hours and then kick it back to you.
To avoid this problem, always submit a RespOrg LOA that’s fewer than five
days old.
Name/number or address mismatch
A name/number or address mismatch indicates that the carrier is rejecting
your RespOrg because the name and address don’t match, even though your
carrier has confirmed that the toll-free number belongs to your company.
How’s that for frustrating?
To correct this problem, check the address and contact person on the invoice
for the toll-free number and resubmit the RespOrg with a copy of your invoice
to validate what you have listed. You will probably need to send two pages of
your invoice to prove the address and contact name listed, as well as the fact
that the toll-free number is on that invoice.
Forging legal documents is a bad thing and can lead to time in jail. I haven’t
heard of anyone doing hard time from forging a name or changing a date on
a RespOrg LOA, but just because nobody has been convicted doesn’t mean
it can’t happen. Some companies forge the signature of a person who left the
company but who is listed as a contact on the carrier invoice. I suppose they
think that’s easier than changing the contact name with the current carrier
before trying to have the numbers released again. Forging isn’t a good idea,
but some people do find it effective as a short-term solution.
174
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Number under contract
If you have signed a term agreement with your carrier, the carrier can reject
any attempt to migrate a toll-free number until the term is complete. 
Your contract might state that you will have service with the carrier for a
specific duration of time, and it may state a revenue commitment, but if 
nothing in the contract links your toll-free numbers to the contract, call
your current carrier to negotiate the release of your toll-free numbers. If,
even after the release of the toll-free numbers, your company will still have
enough usage on the carrier’s network to fulfill your contract requirements,
the carrier probably won’t hold on to your toll-free numbers. After your car-
rier gives you the green light to migrate your toll-free numbers, you have to
resubmit the RespOrg to the new carrier.
Unsatisfactory business relationship
A rejection based on unsatisfactory business relationship (UBR) means only
one thing: your carrier thinks you owe money. The only way to work through
a UBR rejection is with a few phone calls and a checkbook. If you have with-
held payment because of a billing dispute with your carrier, you might be in
for a bitter battle over your toll-free numbers. 
Keep a clear head when you talk to your carrier, because if you tell the rep
that you won’t pay your invoice, you might find that the next thing you know
your toll-free numbers have been immediately taken down. Diplomacy is cru-
cial to settling a UBR. If all else fails, you may need to resort to diplomacy by
other means, as discussed in the following sections that cover NASCing.
NASCing (Migration by Other Means)
Carl Von Clausewitz once referred to war as “the conduct of diplomacy by
other means.” Along the same lines, NASCing can be considered toll-free
migration by other means because it bypasses the normal process and
forcibly extracts the number from the carrier. The term NASC doesn’t have
to do with the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. It is derived
from the 800 Number Administration and Service Center (NASC), which nego-
tiates the release of a toll-free number. In telecom parlance, the process of
breaking your bond with your current toll-free carrier is called NASCing
(nask-ing). NASCing comes in handy in any of the following situations: 
175
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

 You have a small quantity of toll-free numbers: There is a one-time
fee of about $40 per toll-free number to NASC. If you have 500 toll-free
numbers that you want to NASC, changing carriers had better be worth
$20,000 to you.
 Your initial toll-free migration has been rejected for any reason: You
can only NASC a toll-free number if the migration attempt has been
rejected. If the migration attempt is simply taking too much time, your
carrier will require you to wait for the number to be rejected before you
can NASC it. 
 Your numbers are in jeopardy of being disconnected: If you are in a
billing dispute with your carrier and the carrier rejects your RespOrg
LOA request because you have an unsatisfactory business relationship
(UBR), you may be in a situation where disconnection is imminent. If you
are in an intractable mess, your only choice might be to bite the bullet,
pay the NASC fees, and take your numbers. Consider this option if your
carrier’s collections department is playing hardball and isn’t validating
with the billing department the unresolved disputes. 
If your carrier blocks all your toll-free numbers for nonpay, you only
have two options to choose. You can suck it up and pay the balance, or
you can suck it up and pay the fee to NASC for all of your toll-free num-
bers. In any case, you’re not getting out of this situation without forking
over some money, so do your company a favor and choose the option
that costs the least amount of money, even if that means paying money
you don’t think you really should have to pay. In other words, you may
have to swallow your pride. On the other hand, if phones are integral to
your profits, there is one benefit to spending more money to NASC your
toll-free numbers than you would pay to your current carrier to end a
billing dispute; if the numbers have been blocked and you need them in
working order immediately, the turnaround time from when you submit
the NASC request is generally 24 hours or less. 
Understanding that NASCing 
is a temporary solution
Just as you can NASC a toll-free number from a carrier, a carrier can NASC
that number right back again. And so, like the products of any unhappy 
marriage, your toll-free numbers are the victims of your custody battle.
Let me be clear: As long as the carrier submits the required paperwork, you
and the carrier can play this NASC game indefinitely. The ownership of toll-
free numbers doesn’t usually degenerate to NASCing wars, but it isn’t
unheard of if the amount of money at stake is large enough.
176
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Check all of your documents several times before you submit a toll-free
number to NASC. If you mistakenly NASC someone else’s number, you can
expect bad things to happen. At a very minimum, you will get a screaming
call from the number’s rightful owner. If you take down the main order
number of a huge company, you might hear terms like civil suit and punitive
damages bandied about in the very near future. Carriers that NASC numbers
with reckless abandon have been fined millions of dollars and required to
follow stricter quality-assurance policies.
Following best NASCing practices
The industry standard timeline for NASCing is 24 hours if the toll-free number
is blocked and nonoperational, and the standard 7 to 10 days if it’s active.
Aside from the timeline based on the number’s disposition, the paperwork
you must submit to make the NASC happen is the same (that is, you fill out a
RespOrg LOA). To NASC a number, your initial migration has to have been
rejected, and your new long-distance carrier will most likely ask you to
submit the following:
 A new RespOrg LOA form filled out completely, with a current signature
and date
 Pages of the most recent invoice for the toll-free number that validate
both the number and the company information
After your new long-distance carrier receives your fax of the documents and
you explain the urgency of the NASC (is your number active or down?), the
carrier validates that the number has a current rejection file and begins the
NASCing process. 
Your new long-distance carrier sometimes calls the number before beginning
the process in order to validate the company listed on the RespOrg. This is
helpful only if the number you are NASCing isn’t down or a fax line, because
you can’t validate the company on the end from either call treatment. If you
are trying to NASC a number that belongs to a subsidiary of your company,
or that’s used for a specific project and you fear that the call won’t be answered
with a clear reference to your company’s name, you should alert your new
long-distance carrier. If your new long-distance carrier makes a test call to the
number and the name of the company answering the phone doesn’t match, it
may not execute the NASC until you can explain the disparity. You can bypass
this potential problem by reviewing your invoice with your carrier. 
If your carrier is required to make the test call before NASCing because of
the results of a federal lawsuit (possibly because of reckless NASCing in its
recent past), the carrier might resist going to the extra work. If you need to,
call your new long-distance carrier and set up a conference call with some-
one in your office who answers toll-free calls. After everyone is on the line,
177
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

tell your carrier to call the number and have your co-worker answer it by
identifying your company by name (“Thank you for calling Acme. This is
Mark. Can I help you?”). Making one clean call takes only five seconds, and
then everyone will be happy. Let the NASC begin.
Ordering Switched Toll-Free Numbers
All the information in this chapter up to this point applies to all toll-free 
numbers, whether they ring to a switched phone number or into a dedicated
circuit. Now I focus on switched toll-free service. Ordering a switched toll-free
number without any advanced features is so basic that everything you need
to include is usually added onto the standard RespOrg LOA document (refer
to Figure 9-1). The only information your carrier needs to activate a switched
toll-free number is the toll-free number, the ring-to number, and the area of
coverage:
 The ring-to number receives the calls from your toll-free number: If
you have five phone numbers that roll over to each other (what the tele-
com world refers to as a hunt group, because the calls hunt from one line
to the next), you point your toll-free number to that first phone line so
you can take calls on all five lines. The first number in the hunt group is
your ring-to number. 
 The area of coverage specifies the geographic area that your toll-free
number serves: You can have one default area of coverage, or these
options:
• U.S. 48 states only
• U.S. 48 states and Canada
• U.S. 48 states, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands
• U.S. 48 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands
• U.S. 50 states only
• U.S. 50 states and Canada
• U.S. 50 states, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands
• U.S. 50 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands
Rates for toll-free calls from any area outside the 48 contiguous states are
typically higher than domestic rates. Check the costs to determine whether
it’s worth it to allow them access. If you have questions about the pricing for
toll-free numbers, please visit the section about the costs of enhanced toll-
free service in Chapter 5. While you’re there, you can read up on the enhanced
toll-free features that might be useful for your business as well.

Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

After you reserve a new toll-free number or successfully migrate an existing
toll-free number to a new carrier, activating the number takes about 24 hours.
The actual process of updating the national database to point the traffic from
the toll-free number to the new carrier takes about 15 minutes, but your car-
rier is busy processing hundreds (maybe thousands) of orders, so you can
wait a day, can’t you?
Ordering Dedicated Toll-Free Numbers
Dedicated toll-free numbers are inherently more complex because the toll-
free number isn’t simply being pointed to a phone number and sent off to
your local carrier to complete. The number is instead being designed to
follow a predetermined route within your carrier, terminating at your
specific dedicated trunk group. That’s what the dedicated in dedicated 
toll-free service means.
Dedicated toll-free ordering timelines
There aren’t any industry standards for activating dedicated toll-free num-
bers, and the time frames vary greatly from carrier to carrier. One carrier
might activate a new dedicated toll-free number in 24 hours, whereas another
carrier takes 10 to 15 business days to do the same thing. 
You need to call your carrier to find out its standard timeline so that you can
plan accordingly. Be prepared to see longer timelines for toll-free numbers
that must be migrated from another carrier or for change orders.
When you have an order for more than 100 toll-free numbers, you can usually
go through a special bulk-load or bulk-ordering process that shortens the
overall activation time. Instead of having to schedule time for someone to
design all the toll-free numbers individually, bulk loading can cut the time in
half. Your carrier might have a minimum quantity of toll-free numbers before
it allows bulk-load activation; check into this option if this factor might affect
your decision about how many lines to order.
Giving general information about the order
Before you can add any enhanced features to your dedicated toll-free num-
bers, you need to fill out a standard order form for dedicated toll-free service.
If you are unfamiliar with the standard features on dedicated toll-free num-
bers, check out Chapter 5, where I cover them in depth. The order form for a
basic dedicated toll-free number asks you for accounting information, such
179
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

as your company’s name, account number, and contact information, as well
as the following technical info:
 The toll-free number: You gotta know that much!
 The required coverage area: Specify whether you want to receive calls
from mainland U.S. states, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, or any combination of these geographic locations.
 The dedicated trunk group to receive the toll-free number: Every car-
rier has its own requirements and terminology for toll-free numbers. It’s
more common for carriers to require you to list the trunk group that
they should terminate into than to list the circuit ID. Trunk groups are
configured to designate how your carrier sends calls, and a single trunk
group may include multiple circuits or only a few channels on a single 
T-1 circuit. Check out Chapter 8 for more information about trunk groups.
Ordering DNIS digits
Most people in telecom use the last four digits of the toll-free number as their
DNIS digits. If you have several vanity numbers whereby the last four digits of
the toll-free are the same and you need to differentiate where the numbers
are directed by your phone system, you can’t use this method. Instead, you
can assign random DNIS digits to your toll-free numbers. 
180
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 
A matter of routing
The reason for this huge disparity in time — from
1 to 15 days — is all because of how your carrier
builds your toll-free numbers. Most carriers that
take more than 24 hours to activate a dedicated
toll-free number build individual route paths for
them. This is a manual process whereby every
toll-free number is keyed in by a technician. 
If your carrier builds a single routing pattern for
all toll-free numbers on your circuit, it can prob-
ably turn up new numbers in 24 hours. In this
case, all the technicians have to do is link the
new toll-free number to that generic route.
Check with your carrier to determine which 
procedure it uses, because each option has 
limitations. 
Waiting 10 to 15 days is certainly not desirable.
However, if your carrier builds a boiler-plate
route for your company, there might be DNIS
limitations that prevent you from using the last
four digits of your toll-free number as the DNIS
on your phone system. This problem is common
when the last four digits of the toll-free number
start with a 0, because some phone systems
can’t process a DNIS with a leading 0. Because
you now have a toll-free number that doesn’t
adhere to the profile used for the rest of your
toll-free numbers, you need to speak to your
long-distance carrier to find a workaround. If
you have questions about DNIS, check out
Chapter 5.

If you go for a unique DNIS setup, keep a log that explains which DNIS digits
correspond to which toll-free numbers. It’s easy to become confused if you
have to troubleshoot your phone system, and a simple spreadsheet can be a
lifesaver.
Configurations for DNIS can vary within your phone system, so you might
end up searching for the correct DNIS option. If you have a long-distance T-1
with DNIS, and are having a difficult time finding the correct configuration in
your phone system, try the option for Local DID; these settings are generally
compatible.
Setting up ANI delivery
If you need to display the phone number of the person originating calls to
your toll-free number, you need to order ANI delivery. Some phone systems
can be configured to capture this information and list where your calls are
coming from on a specific toll-free number. If you launch a marketing cam-
paign in Chicago, you can get an idea of how effective it is by determining
how many people in Chicago called in on your toll-free numbers. 
Your carrier might not be able to provide ANI delivery if you also need a ten-
digit DNIS. Many carrier switches have limitations on the number of digits
they can input in the DNIS stream. If the switch is restricted to 20 digits and
you need ANI delivery, your DNIS can’t be longer than 7 digits, because the
rest of the available slots are taken up with asterisks (*). The information is
sent in the DNIS stream in this scenario as:
*(10 Digit) ANI*(7 Digit)DNIS*
The only time you need all ten digits for DNIS is if you literally have thousands
of toll-free numbers — say you own 1-800-FLOWERS, 1-888-FLOWERS, and
1-877-FLOWERS. Because the last seven digits of the toll-free number are all
the same, the easiest thing is to simply use a ten-digit DNIS. A ten-digit DNIS
prevents you from maintaining a spreadsheet of all your toll-free numbers
and the unique DNIS digits for each of them.
Setting up ANI Infodigits
If your business plan requires you to identify the type of phone originating
calls to your toll-free number, you must use ANI Infodigits (ANI II). ANI II is
generally used for companies that provide calling-card service and must
account for surcharges applied to calls made from pay phones (infodigits
27, 70, and sometimes 07).
181
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

ANI Infodigits aren’t available on all circuit protocols. Unless you are using
ISDN or Feature Group D, you cannot use ANI Infodigits. Please review the
sections in Chapter 8 that cover protocols.
Overflow routing to another 
dedicated circuit
Dedicated toll-free order forms allow you to list the primary trunk group that
receives the traffic for the toll-free number, as well as a secondary trunk
group. If you want the calls to roll over to more than one more trunk group,
you can squeeze all the trunk groups in sequence onto the form, or simply list
the overflow routing sequence in the notes section at the bottom of the form.
Overflow routing to a switched phone line
It’s very common to set up overflow routing to a switched phone line, and
this configuration is always the final route (the end of the line, so to speak)
for a dedicated toll-free number. After a dedicated toll-free number overflows
to a switched phone line, the network doesn’t route the call any farther. The
only way to give the toll-free number more life when it hits a switched phone
182
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 
What DNIS actually looks like
Dialed Number Identification Service, or DNIS,
involves a challenge and a password between
your long-distance carrier and your PBX. The
whole process is accomplished by the use of
dial tone and DTMF digits (the standard tones
you hear when you press the button on a touch-
tone phone). Your phone system is alerted to the
fact that a toll-free call is coming in and con-
nects the call. Your phone system then sends a
signal back to your carrier, which, for all intents
and purposes, sounds just like a dial tone. Your
long-distance carrier receives the dial tone and
understands that you want the carrier to send
the DNIS information, at which time the carrier
sends you this:
**DNIS*
Each asterisk is actually the same touch-tone
sound that you hear when you press the * key
on your phone. The DNIS is made up of the two
to ten digits you ordered to be associated with
that specific toll-free number. This configuration
isn’t an absolute in telecom, because all carri-
ers are different, but it’s the most common you
will encounter. 

line is to point it to the first number in a multiple-line hunt group. See the sec-
tion “Ordering Switched Toll-Free Numbers,” earlier in this chapter, for more
on hunt groups.
Identifying new or migrated numbers
Carriers have different requirements for orders that are new toll-free numbers
that are reserved, as opposed to toll-free numbers that are being migrated
from another carrier. Carriers can process new toll-free numbers at any time
without any concern. If the new toll-free numbers are activated and begin
ringing into your phone system at 2:00 a.m., there is no real downside.
On the other hand, if you’re moving all your toll-free numbers from another
carrier to a dedicated circuit that isn’t yet installed, pointing the numbers to
the new (inactive) trunk group will effectively bring down your phone num-
bers and have them ring to busy signals until you fix the problem. 
Using a Hot Cut to Activate Your
Dedicated Toll-Free Numbers
You can choose to let your carrier activate your toll-free numbers at will, or
you might need to have it done in a very controlled manner. If you are order-
ing a handful of new toll-free numbers for your circuit and you haven’t pub-
lished them, there isn’t much threat of disaster if they aren’t working right
away. If the numbers are failing, you can always troubleshoot them in a rela-
tively calm environment. 
183
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service
Understanding trunk group level features
DNIS, ANI, and ANI Infodigits are generally built
at a trunk group level. If you set up your trunk
group to use the last four digits of your toll-free
numbers for DNIS, you can’t request to have a
toll-free number pointed there that uses a
seven-digit DNIS. This rule is the same if your
trunk group is set up to deliver ANI or ANI
Infodigits, but for a select group of the toll-free
numbers, you don’t need the additional infor-
mation you get from ANI or ANI Infodigits. You
must either change the toll-free numbers so that
they match the trunk group or build a new trunk
group for these special cases. 

On the other hand, your business may depend on toll-free service. If you have
an existing toll-free number that handles 90 percent of your inbound orders
every day, having the system down for even a minute is simply not an option.
You certainly don’t have the luxury of waiting for someone to tell you that
your toll-free service isn’t working, tracking down the carrier’s number, open-
ing a trouble ticket, and then waiting for two to four hours for a call back (all
while your boss is screaming at you to get it fixed). 
So what can you do? Glad you asked! A hot cut is a scheduled activation
whereby your carrier walks you through the activation process via confer-
ence call. A hot cut allows you to identify any problems immediately, and
quickly correct them while you have a technician on the line. If your carrier
cannot fix the problem immediately, let the troubleshooting begin. 
Making sure the right people are 
invited to the hot cut party
You have to determine who should participate in the hot cut phone call and
ensure that a conference bridge is available if you need one. The conference
bridge enables many people to dial into a system where they can be placed
on one large conference call. This is ideal for hot cuts because you need
to have several people on the call who are geographically separated. In 
addition to the technician at your carrier, you may consider inviting the 
following individuals:
 The provisioner at the carrier: If you have requested any special rout-
ing features on your toll-free numbers, you might want to include your
provisioner, who is the individual at your long-distance carrier who
receives and processes your orders, in the call as well. In the event
that there has been a miscommunication and your special features
have not been added, the technician activating your number might be
able to build them at the time of the hot cut. Your long-distance carrier
will require you to send an order through the provisioning system after
the fact, to complete the paper trail. When you include the provisioner,
that person can validate anything that might not have translated through
the provisioning system and place the backup orders if something was
missed.
 The hardware vendor: If you are migrating existing, active toll-free num-
bers to a new phone system, your hardware vendor has to program each
toll-free number into your new PBX, Key System, or whatever constitutes
your new phone system, before the toll-free numbers will work. The vendor
needs to build the routing plans on the DNIS (if you are using it) for each
toll-free number, as well as a default path in case you are sent a call with
an unknown DNIS. If you don’t have a default path, and the DNIS isn’t
set up for a number, your phone system will reject calls. Similarly, if the
DNIS stream isn’t sent completely, your phone system will reject calls. If
184
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

you have existing toll-free numbers from the carrier working on your
phone system and your hardware is already set up to receive the new
number, you only need yourself and the provisioner and the carrier’s
technician on the hot cut.
Accomplishing the perfect hot cut
(Timing is everything)
The key to success in telecom is planning. If you are activating new circuits,
here’s the perfect timeline. 
 One week or so after you submit the order for your dedicated circuit:
Send the RespOrgs for your dedicated toll-free numbers.
 After you receive confirmation that the circuit order is flowing through
the system: Send the order for your dedicated toll-free numbers and the
RespOrgs. 
 The day you send the RespOrg LOA paperwork: Schedule a follow-up
call eight days later. By then, you should know the status of the RespOrg
and can handle a rejection or celebrate a release with plenty of time
before your circuit is ready. 
 About two weeks before you expect to activate your circuits: Issue the
disconnect order with your old carrier and request the circuits be taken
down in 30 days. This request gives you about two weeks of overlap just
in case an unforeseen problem crops up. 
It’s also very helpful to remain on friendly terms with your old carrier,
just in case you need to make an 11th-hour call to extend the due date of
your circuits.
 Two or three days prior to activating your new circuits: Call your new
long-distance carrier and confirm the order details. Confirm the quantity
of toll-free numbers pending, as well as the RespOrg of all the numbers.
If any numbers are still not with new long-distance carrier, you might
still have time to push them through the system.
 On the day of the hot cut: Have everyone at your disposal. Be sure the
new long-distance carrier’s installation technician is on the line, along
with your hardware vendor. You also want to have the person who takes
your orders for the new long-distance carrier available for verification of
orders or if you need to push a straggling order through. Refer to your
escalation list so you know who should be present if the person who took
your order is not in the office for the hot cut. As long as your new carrier
has RespOrg of your numbers, and you have competent technicians, both
at the carrier and hardware levels, there isn’t much that can stop you from
a successful activation.
185
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

Resolving Activation Issues on 
Migrated Toll-Free Numbers
In a perfect world, there are no problems. All toll-free numbers are released
to the new carrier on time and are seamlessly transitioned onto your new 
circuits. In reality, this isn’t the case. Toll-free hot cuts fall into four basic 
scenarios; the scenarios range in type from the highly desirable to varying
degrees of undesirable.
Before you can fully understand the complexities of the hot cut, you must
know two important things. 
 Which carrier has RespOrg ownership of the toll-free number: This
carrier has the power to manipulate the toll-free number in the national
SMS database, and can change the long-distance carrier that receives
the calls for the toll-free number, as well as the location into which the
toll-free number rings. After your old carrier releases RespOrg owner-
ship of the number, the old carrier can no longer update the national
SMS database to change where calls for the number are sent. 
This means that the old carrier hands off the power over your toll-free
number while all of your traffic is still running over its network.
 What carrier is actually handling the traffic and completing the calls
for the toll-free number: The traffic for your toll-free number continues
to run over your old carrier’s network until either your new carrier updates
the SMS database to send the calls to the new network, or your old car-
rier blocks your toll-free numbers on its network.
For example, if your old carrier, AT&T, released your toll-free number to
your new carrier, Qwest, Qwest has RespOrg control; all calls are still
processed by AT&T until Qwest updates the national database to have
the calls sent to the Qwest network.
Your new carrier should have a handful of toll-free numbers that are used for
testing the inbound routing on dedicated circuits. Have your new carrier set
up one of these numbers exactly as if it were your toll-free number. That way,
technicians can validate the routing and configuration before they close out
the order and update the national SMS database. If, for example, your main
toll-free number has ANI delivery and the four-digit DNIS of 8899, ask the car-
rier to replicate that setting so that some calls are sent to the circuit. If your
phone system doesn’t respond to the calls, or if the calls simply fail, you can
use the test toll-free number to work out the kinks. Your new carrier should
update the SMS database only after all the issues on the test toll-free number
are resolved. You should make more test calls to your numbers after the SMS
database is updated, too. When your calls complete over the network and all
the test calls are good, you are done.
186
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Resolving Common Dedicated 
Toll-Free Migration Scenarios
It’s much easier to understand the possible pitfalls of dedicated toll-free num-
bers if you consider a real-world scenario. For this example, your fictitious
company’s current long-distance carrier is AT&T, but it’s moving all of its 
services to Qwest. 
You have 
 Completed the dedicated order forms with Qwest for the T-1s that will
replace your AT&T circuits
 Filled out the RespOrg LOAs to move all of your toll-free numbers
 Noted that all of your toll-free numbers must be activated in conjunction
with your new Qwest circuits
 Requested a hot cut for activation
In the following sections, feel free to replace the main characters AT&T and
Qwest your actual carriers. 
With this as the starting point for your RespOrg one-act play, the following
sections reveal the possible issues that could arise, as well as offer the reso-
lutions that will make things right again. (You can substitute any two carriers
for this example, because the scenarios could just as easily happen between
any two other carriers.)
Activation without a hot cut
In this scenario, your toll-free numbers are released from AT&T to Qwest
without a problem, and Qwest now has RespOrg and activates the toll-free
numbers to your circuits immediately. Now your circuits won’t be active for
another two to three weeks. All calls to your toll-free numbers fail to a fast
busy signal. 
Now you need to fix the problem, but you don’t know who to call. Don’t
panic; you can resolve this problem in short order. Your first call is into the
person at Qwest handling the order for your toll-free numbers to confirm the
following details: 
 Who has the RespOrg
 Which carrier is receiving the traffic
187
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

When you confirm it’s Qwest in both cases, you now know that Qwest jumped
the gun and is routing calls to your dedicated circuits that are not yet active.
AT&T can’t do anything to help you because it doesn’t have RespOrg control
of your toll-free numbers anymore, and you need to bring your toll-free number
back to life. 
You have two options to resolve the situation and get you back up and run-
ning until your circuit is activated.
Solution 1: Talk to whoever’s in charge of toll-free routing or SMS
database updates
Have your order person at Qwest connect you to a manager or the most skilled
person in the RespOrg or toll-free routing department. Don’t be concerned
about what titles; as long as the person you talk to is responsible for updat-
ing the SMS database, you are talking to the right person. Tell this person
that you need to send the traffic back to the previous route. Because you
know your old carrier is AT&T, you can have Qwest update the SMS database
to route all of your calls over the AT&T network. This is the preferred solution
and generally the most difficult to accomplish, because only a handful of people
in the toll-free department at any carrier know how to make this change to
the national SMS database.
After the national database is updated, your toll-free calls for that number go
back to being handled by AT&T. Calls are routed to AT&T networks until you
have Qwest update the numbers to point back to Qwest when you finally
complete the testing and activation of your dedicated circuit. 
Whoever holds the RespOrg control of a toll-free number can send the calls
over any long distance carrier in North America, Canada, and parts of the
Caribbean. If your old carrier (in this case AT&T) still has an active route
built for the number, your current carrier can update the database to send
calls to the old carrier, and your calls will complete just fine. 
Be sure to tell the RespOrg person to send the traffic back to the previous
route and not to release the RespOrg to the previous carrier. These are two
completely different things. As long as Qwest simply updates the national
SMS database so that your toll-free calls ride AT&T’s network, Qwest retains
the ability to point your calls to the Qwest network when the time comes. If
Qwest misunderstands you and thinks you want to give the RespOrg control
back to AT&T, everyone will become very frustrated, because you need an
immediate fix, and the process of switch RespOrg ownership of a toll-free
number takes seven to ten days. 
It seems logical that Qwest could simply give the RespOrg back to AT&T and
avoid the seven-to-ten-day process. That is a bad idea, because without a
RespOrg LOA telling Qwest who to give the RespOrg to, Qwest might make a
mistake.
188
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

In order to make such a move work, you would have to call AT&T, have a rep
fax you a RespOrg LOA form, fill it out, fax it back to AT&T, and have AT&T
send the form to Qwest again. All of this takes time that you don’t have, and
even if you could do it, you don’t want to. The solution I’ve offered here is a
temporary fix to make sure that you get calls (through AT&T) while the dedi-
cated circuits (with Qwest) are being prepared. Therefore, if you were to start
all over again with the LOA, as soon as the number is sent back to AT&T, your
dedicated circuits will probably be ready with Qwest, and you will have to
start the whole process over again to pull the numbers back to Qwest. 
Solution 2: Call customer service to report trouble with the 
toll-free number
After you get off the phone with the person at Qwest who handles your
orders, call the Qwest customer service department to report trouble with
the toll-free number. When you reach a Qwest customer service rep, tell
him or her what happened and that you need to have an emergency alt route 
(telecom code for emergency alternative route) to a switched number for your
dedicated toll-free number. The rep will ask you where you want the toll-free
number pointed, so you need to have a phone number in mind that you can
dedicate to temporarily receiving the toll-free calls. The phone number you
give can be any regular switched phone line in your office, as long as it’s a
working number that someone will actually answer.
If you are in transition and you don’t have any active phone lines in your
office, ask your carrier to send the calls to your cellphone until you have a
better option. No, I’m not kidding. This isn’t the best solution, but it will allow
you to continue receiving calls until your dedicated circuit is running. After
your T-1s are active, call the Qwest customer care department to have the
calls sent back to the dedicated circuit. The installation technicians might
not be able to tell that your toll-free numbers are on an emergency alt route,
so you need to inform them.
Cancellation before activation
In this scenario, your toll-free numbers are released by AT&T to Qwest with-
out any problem, and Qwest remembers that you need a hot cut. In light of
your request, Qwest holds the RespOrg for the numbers but doesn’t cut over
the traffic, and for a while everything looks wonderful. 
Then something happens. Possibly the installation of your Qwest circuits is
delayed, or maybe your relationship with AT&T goes sour. Whatever the situ-
ation, AT&T blocks your toll-free numbers on their network before your cir-
cuit with Qwest is active and can receive the calls. This scenario is common
when there’s an issue with the new circuits that pushes out the schedule for
activation on the Qwest network. 
189
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

Many carriers have an automated system to clean up unwanted toll-free num-
bers from their network. Basically, a computer program polls every toll-free
number passing traffic on the network. If the toll-free number has a different
RespOrg (one that doesn’t belong to the carrier or any of its subsidiaries — a
situation that occurs if you’ve transferred the number to a new carrier), the
automated system blocks the toll-free number from passing traffic over its
network. All the calls will either fail to a fast busy signal or will be sent to a
recording that says something like, “This number has been disconnected.
Please contact our customer care department if you have any questions.” 
If this happens to your toll-free numbers, your first call is to the person at
Qwest who handles your toll-free orders. Ask 
 Who has the RespOrg control of your toll-free numbers?
 Which network is receiving the traffic at this time?
When the Qwest rep tells you Qwest owns the RespOrg, but the traffic is still
running over AT&T, you know why the calls are failing. Because the national
database is sending all of your calls to the AT&T network and nobody else
has made any changes, the problem lies with AT&T.
You have two solution options.
Solution 1: Ask for the blocks to be removed
Ask your AT&T account rep, in your nicest voice, to remove the blocks on
your toll-free numbers. If the rep is in a good mood, he or she will realize that
opening your toll-free numbers will get AT&T some more revenue before you
leave, as well as garnering good will. 
It might take AT&T anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours, but as long as
the carrier is working with you (and not against you), the numbers will be
active again soon. Chat with the rep about the progress of your new circuits,
especially if you have hit substantial delays. This is your preferred solution
to the problem because you maintain the status quo.
If it’s going to take 30 or 60 more days before you can activate your toll-free
numbers on your new circuits, you might choose to change the RespOrg 
ownership of the numbers back to your old carrier in the meantime. Say
AT&T has an automated system that takes down your numbers every 30
days; if you have to go through a fire drill to have them reactivated once a
month, it’s better to simply send the numbers back and start the process
over again after your new circuits are ready to test. 
Solution 2: Call the toll-free order people at Qwest to have them 
activate your toll-free numbers. 
If AT&T blocked your toll-free numbers because your relationship turned
sour, you can’t likely rely on AT&T to bail you out of this problem. The only
190
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

lines the Qwest reps can use to send your calls is your dedicated circuit
(which hasn’t been installed yet), but as long as they can update the national
SMS database to point all calls to the Qwest network, you are halfway home. 
You might need to escalate the issue if you feel it isn’t being handled with
enough urgency, but in a pinch, every carrier will do what it takes to restore
your service. 
After the national SMS database is updated, you simply have to call the
Qwest customer care department to perform an emergency alt route to a
switched phone number. About 15 minutes after you give Qwest the number
to a switched phone in your office, you should start to receive toll-free calls
to the switched line. I do realize that your toll-free number might have had 24
or 48 phone lines to ring into before, but you will be able to get by until your
circuit is installed and you can swing the numbers onto your new dedicated
circuits. If you have four or five lines that roll over to each other, you can
send your toll-free number to the first number in the group, and at least not
be limited to receiving one call before people get a busy signal.
Negotiating a hot cut without RespOrg
Say you submit the RespOrg LOA documents 30 days before your circuit is
ready to activate, but your toll-free numbers are still not released to your new
carrier by the time the circuit is ready to activate. Qwest might have forgot-
ten to submit the RespOrg documents to AT&T, or Qwest may have sent them
but the LOA was rejected and never resolved.
This situation (essentially that your new carrier, Qwest, hasn’t got official
status as the RespOrg owner of your toll-free numbers) is generally revealed
as you are installing the dedicated circuits. You might have spent an hour or
so testing the outbound calls on your new circuits before you decide to test
the toll-free numbers. As you casually ask your installation technician for
Qwest to check out the toll-free numbers, she responds, “Hmmm, I don’t see
any setup for this circuit.” Ten minutes later, you find out the location of your
toll-free numbers — with AT&T. Regardless of the source of the problem, the
end result is that Qwest doesn’t have RespOrg of your toll-free numbers and
you cannot migrate the numbers. The really painful part of the situation is
that you only have seven days (or fewer) before your AT&T circuits are
slated to be disconnected.
Don’t panic yet. Here are some solutions if you find yourself in this situation:
Solution 1: Push out the cancellation date
Call your contacts at AT&T and push out the cancellation date of your cir-
cuits by another week or two. If the reps are nice, you can buy yourself
enough time to migrate your toll-free numbers to Qwest. If the reps are not
inclined to help you, opt for Solution 2.
191
Chapter 9: Ordering Toll-Free Service

Solution 2: Submit the migration request — yesterday
If the migration request hasn’t been submitted to AT&T yet, have it submitted
immediately. If the RespOrg has already been rejected once, you can address
the reason for rejection and resubmit the migration request, or simply NASC
the numbers. If you have a large quantity of toll-free numbers, you need to
perform a little telecom triage to determine which numbers are the most
important and cannot go down (as I explain earlier in this chapter, NASCing is
rather expensive if you have many lines). Some of your numbers might have
limited use, and so it might be just fine to wait for the seven to ten days, even
if the lines aren’t working for three of those days. Not ideal, but it’ll work.

f you’re setting up a dedicated circuit for your toll-free numbers, the most
critical time in the process is the moment you unplug your old circuits and
plug in your toll-free numbers to your new carrier. During this time, you have
no phone service. You won’t know if your new circuits function until your car-
rier activates the numbers on the circuit and you successfully transmit your
first call through the new network. 
There are a handful of variables that can influence how long the installation
takes (and, consequently, how frustrating it can be). During the installation,
all focus is on the hardware at your end, the hardware at your carrier’s end,
and all the hardware in between. Your greatest allies (and, potentially, your
greatest sources of frustration) during the installation are the technicians at
your disposal. You must learn to love your hardware vendor and the installa-
tion technician at your carrier. 
For basic information about your toll-free options, check out Chapter 8.
For introductory information about all the stuff you need to do to order 
your toll-free dedicated service, move to Chapter 9. This chapter walks
you through a typical installation of a dedicated circuit that can be used
for your toll-free lines, or strictly for outbound calling, and ensures that
you have access to all the right people. This is the chapter you should read
if you’re about to activate any dedicated service.

This chapter covers installing brand-new toll-free numbers on brand-new
dedicated circuits with a brand-new carrier. If you’re setting up a new dedi-
cated circuit with a carrier and migrating existing toll-free numbers from your
old carrier to the new circuit, flip back to Chapter 9 and look for information
about hot cuts. Go ahead. I won’t be mad.
Requesting a Hot Cut or Parallel Cut
A hot cut on a dedicated circuit entails the same type of risk as a hot cut on a
dedicated toll-free number. Your active dedicated circuit is taken down and
replaced with a new dedicated circuit. Until the new circuit is fully activated,
you can’t use any phone service that depends on the dedicated circuit. This
type of a circuit installation should be conducted after the close of business
or during off-peak calling times.
A parallel cut on a dedicated circuit involves the activation of a dedicated 
circuit that is to be used in addition to your existing service. None of your
current phone service is in jeopardy of being disturbed, so this type of circuit
activation can occur at any convenient time during regular business hours.
Regardless of whether you’re replacing your existing dedicated circuits on a
hot cut, or whether you’re simply adding additional circuits on a parallel cut,
the same rules apply to both.
Inviting the Right People to the
Installation
There are only a handful of people you want on the call while you are activat-
ing a circuit. These people can be grouped into two categories: the people
you must have and the people you may need. Of course, there’s also a third
category — the people you definitely do not want. Check out the following
sections for more information on which people are in each group.
Getting your A-list together: Mandatory
participants in your activation party
Here’s a list of people who must be present when you activate your toll-free
dedicated circuit:
194
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

 Your carrier’s installation technician: Your carrier has to individually
activate every DS-3, DS-1, and lower-level DS-0 on your circuit. If the
technician doesn’t show up, all bets are off; you can’t install the circuit. 
 A technician from your hardware vendor: You must have someone
technically capable on your end to validate settings on your hardware
and to perform simple testing. If you do not have a hardware vendor,
hire one for this event. An installation tech that can bring your circuits
up without any problem is well worth the investment. 
 You: Someone needs to write down everything that happens during
the installation. That someone is you, unless you can think of someone
more trustworthy and knowledgeable than you (in that case, I still think
you should be there, along with this other ace). You won’t be activating
any circuits. You’re there to witness and record all the vital information
about the birth of your beautiful new dedicated circuit. Bring a pen and
paper (see “Writing an Installation Journal,” later in this chapter), and
record the name of the technicians present, along with the general
sequence of events. Try to make your notes as specific as possible 
without going overboard. 
I suppose you could sit in your office instead of being present for this
technical achievement, but it’s really not a good idea. For one thing, if
you are not involved in the installation, there may be very little motiva-
tion to successfully complete it. For another thing, you may actually be
useful. And finally, you could save your company a lot of money by being
there. Your hardware vendor is probably charging you by the hour, so
even though he has other work to do he’s not necessarily going to work
at breakneck speed. Likewise, the technician at your carrier may not feel
the need to push through simple issues without proper motivation. Issues
that have financial implications can come up during an installation
process. The only way to avoid being told that the installation went fine,
and then realizing a month later (when the bill arrives) that something
costly has occurred, is to be there when it happens. Say your hardware
vendor changes the configuration on the five T-1s you installed from
loopstart to ISDN. Although this change enables additional information
to be transmitted in the call stream (which may be useful for your busi-
ness), it may also cause you to incur additional charges. If you’re not
there to say “Heck, no,” your carrier may charge you $250 for the
change, $250 apiece to install the five D channel cards, and $150 per
month for the cards. The installation technician can’t waive those fees,
and you will have a difficult time renegotiating the price with your sales-
person on a feature that has already been installed. 
 Your local carrier’s installation technician: If you ordered a local loop
(see Chapter 8), you’re responsible for coordinating the testing between
your long-distance carrier and your local carrier. If your long-distance
carrier ordered the local loop, don’t worry, the long-distance carrier will
have already done its testing before even allowing you to schedule the
installation.
195
Chapter 10: Activating Your Dedicated Circuit and Toll-Free Numbers

Do not try to install new circuits on new hardware yourself. Unless you are
comfortable enough with your phone system and can confidently configure,
test, and confirm settings within it, you need to hire someone who can. Every
phone system’s configurations are set up a bit differently; some have dip
switches, some require you to use a laptop to connect into them, and some
can be set by prompts given on an LCD screen on the face of the unit. If you
don’t know what you’re doing, you could to waste four or five hours figuring
things out through trial and error.
Bringing in the B-list: Optional guests 
Here’s a list of people who you should welcome to your installation party. If
these people are there, they can make things go smoothly if something goes
wrong. But if they regretfully decline to attend, you shouldn’t hold up the
installation process on their account. Invite the following people with fingers
crossed:
 A rep from your carrier, specifically, the person who handled your
order: If there is a problem during the installation where an order was
either not placed correctly or not completed correctly, you need the rep
on the line to correct the issue. If the issue is small, it may be resolved
during the installation and paperwork can be sent in after the fact to tidy
up the accounting. If there is a large problem, your provisioner may have
to take the issue to his or her manager to clear it in a timely manner. If
your carrier rep isn’t on the line during the installation, he or she should
at least be available by phone during that time.
 Another hardware vendor: If your hardware vendor is technically inca-
pable of performing the tests and setting confirmations that are required
during the installation, you should consider replacing the vendor before
the process even begins. If the installation is going south, a backup tech-
nician may be very useful.
 Building management: If the installation has problems, your hardware
vendor may need to gain access to the main phone room for the build-
ing. This room is generally locked and on the first floor of the building,
or possibly even in the basement. If you’re activating a circuit after
normal business hours, you should arrange for access to this room if
necessary. 
Banning participants: You definitely don’t
want to see these faces
Here’s a list of people you definitely don’t want to come to your installation
party. If these people are there, they can hinder productivity, cause confusion,
196
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

and make things go very, very badly. Send the following people out for a
Starbucks run:
 Your sales agent: The main function of a salesperson is to sell, not to trou-
bleshoot issues. Sales staff may have a general idea of how telecom works,
but technical details are frequently not their strong suit. Having a sales-
person on the line during a circuit installation generally causes everything
to take longer and runs the process off on tangents. You should greatly
discourage the person who sold you the service from being on the call for
the installation. Your sales rep has better things to do, and everything will
move much smoother without his or her presence.
197
Chapter 10: Activating Your Dedicated Circuit and Toll-Free Numbers
Working the diplomacy angle to 
resolve handshaking issues
There are issues that occur, not because of a
hardware fault at either end of the circuit, but
actually as a result of the interaction between
your carrier’s hardware and your phone system.
These handshaking issues can generally be
resolved by validating all the line coding, fram-
ing, and configuration information seen by both
your carrier and your hardware vendor. If that
information checks out, the issue could be of 
a more granular nature that needs more 
troubleshooting. 
It is at this time of mounting frustration that you
must be your most diplomatic. The hardware at
your carrier’s end may pass self-diagnostic
tests with flying colors. In fact, your phone
system may also pass self-diagnostic tests,
giving both your vendor and your carrier valida-
tion for feeling like it’s the other guy’s fault if the
system fails. Technicians for both pieces of
hardware can claim that whatever is causing
the problem is not their issue. At this point, only
their respect for you, your skills as a diplomat,
and their commitment to the job (in that order)
will allow you to push through to resolution.
If you are in the middle of an installation that
begins to degenerate, you may have to separate
your hardware vendor from the installation
technician at your carrier. This may be the best
way to get everyone to do what they need to do
without anyone feeling threatened. Until you
have been there, you won’t believe how easily
things can move to problem solving to a sys-
tematic game of trying to prove the issue is
someone else’s fault. Meanwhile, of course, the
technicians ignore you, your phone system, the
configuration process, and so on. On your dime.
If you are 99 percent sure you know where the
problem is, there is a way to get Sam the tech
to do additional testing, even if Sam’s irritated
and emotional because he has been attacked
for the past three hours. The technique begins
when you calm down and call him up, without
anyone else on the line. In your most under-
standing voice, say, “I know the problem is not
on your end, but my hardware vendor is flipping
out and I just want to shut him up. Can you do
this one test, just to prove, beyond the shadow
of a doubt, that it is not in your network? Then I
can make the vendor fix his end of this.” The
technician will run the test, or even replace the
faulty hardware. If the problem resolves itself,
then you know he found the issue and fixed it. If
the problem persists, at least you have one part
of the troubleshooting done. Now it’s time to call
the technician on the other side of the circuit.

 Any nontechnical people with strong opinions: This category of people
includes managers, directors, vice-presidents, and CEOs of your company.
The installation of a circuit is an event that requires a great deal of diplo-
macy on all sides. If someone on the call begins attacking one of the
technicians on the line because of a problem, the technician may quickly
(and conveniently) prove the issue is not within the carrier’s network
and cease to troubleshoot the problem at that time. Only technical
people with a calm demeanor should be allowed on an activation confer-
ence call. The emotional and uninformed will make the process take
twice as long and not engender any good will with your carrier. And we
can all use more good will.
Preparing for the Installation
The urgency of an installation dictates how much effort you put into prepar-
ing for it. In the perfect world, you prepare for every contingency as if the
life of your company were riding on it. You probably don’t have a ton of time
to devote to planning. If you’re replacing the dedicated circuits that are cur-
rently connected into your phone system with dedicated circuits from a new
carrier, you must coordinate the hot cut thoroughly. If you are activating an
additional circuit in a parallel cut, you don’t have as much to fear.
From the moment you unplug your old carrier’s circuits from your phone
system until your new carrier activates your phone lines and you have clean
calls passing back and forth on the lines, you have no phone service. I recom-
mend that you do hot cuts like this after-hours to avoid negatively impacting
your business. To prevent the hot cut from turning into a fiasco, you should
work through the following checklist at least 24 hours before your scheduled
installation:
1. Confirm your installation time and date with your carrier. 
Many carriers require you to schedule installation 24 to 48 hours in
advance, just like you would schedule an appointment with your doctor.
You can request a specific time, but if it is not available you may be
given the next available time slot. This is an important detail, because
you should schedule your hardware vendor based on the time you
receive, not based on the time you originally had in mind. 
You carrier may be in a different time zone than you are, so you will
need to confirm the time zone listed for your installation. If you are on
the West coast and the installation department for your carrier is on the
East coast, you could easily show up for your installation three hours
late and be forced to reschedule. To make matters worse, some carriers
send a confirmation e-mail with the date and time, but list the installa-
tion time based on Greenwich mean time (GMT), not a domestic time
zone. You can use the Time and Date Web site to help if you need assis-
tance (www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html).
198
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

2. Confirm your installation time with your hardware vendor. 
Hardware vendors have to conduct telecom triage just like everyone
else in the industry. If the vendor is dealing with a huge customer whose
system is completely down, its technicians may be occupied for a day or
two bringing the service back to life. It’s always good to confirm that the
appointment is still on a day in advance, as well as confirm that you
have the correct cellphone number and any other contact information
you may need.
3. Confirm that the local loop has been dropped, tested, and that you
can find it. 
Just because your local carrier dropped a new T-1 jack on the wall 
doesn’t mean that the circuit is ready to install. The wiring from your
building through the local network, and on to your long-distance carrier
has to be completed and tested before you can schedule your activation.
You should also confirm that the T-1 jacks are on the wall where you
need them and that the circuit IDs for each jack match the confirmation
documents you received from your long-distance carrier. 
If your long-distance carrier claims that the circuits have been dropped
to your office, but you can’t find them, jacks may have been placed in
the MPOE (main point of entry) for your building. Your hardware vendor
will need to extend the circuits into your phone room, so you will have
to ask your local carrier to come and extend that wiring to your phone
room. (For more about MPOEs and carrier responsibilities, please check
out Chapter 4.) 
4. Confirm the order number and specifics with your carrier. 
The order you initially sent to your carrier may have little resemblance
to what was eventually delivered to your office. It is not unheard of to
have the quantity of circuits, as well as their configuration, modified
before the circuits are installed. You may have determined that you
needed one more circuit or a different protocol would serve you better
between the time the initial order was sent and the circuits were slated
for installation. Quickly confirm the quantity of circuits that are to be
turned up, as well as their general configuration.
5. Confirm that your toll-free numbers are ready. 
If you have any toll-free numbers that are being activated on the new cir-
cuits, you will need to confirm:
• The RespOrgs have been released to your new carrier for existing
numbers.
• All new numbers you have are still on reserve.
• The quantity of toll-free numbers to be activated to your circuit is
the quantity you asked for.
• The DNIS, ANI, and ANI Infodigits are ordered properly.
199
Chapter 10: Activating Your Dedicated Circuit and Toll-Free Numbers

6. Confirm that a conference bridge has been set up.
Don’t take it for granted that someone is going to set up a conference
bridge. A conference bridge is simply a setup that enables everyone to
participate in a conference call. Bridges usually require a dial-in number
and password. For simple installations that only include your hardware
vendor, your carrier, and you, you can probably bring everyone together
by using your phone system’s conference-calling features. If you need
another person on the line, your carrier or hardware vendor may be able
to conference on another person. If you have more than three people
required on an installation, it is best to have your carrier set up a confer-
ence call so everyone can dial in. In any event, everyone should know
who is calling whom.
Writing an Installation Journal
A lot of things happen at the same time when a dedicated circuit is being set
up. Technicians conduct tests, and nitty-gritty specifics of the circuit are dis-
cussed. I recommend keeping a journal of everything that takes place during
the installation of your circuits. You may need to refer to it at some future
date to clarify what really happened and refresh the memory of a forgetful,
finger-pointing carrier or hardware vendor. Be sure to include the following:
 Date and time of the installation.
 The name, contact information, and title of everyone involved in the call,
along with the contact’s company affiliation.
 A running chronology of events. Include what each individual said or
did. For example:
• When each specific circuit was fully activated and ready to send
and receive calls. You know your circuits are at that state if your
carrier’s installation technician tells you he has effectively idled up
the circuits.
• When each test call was attempted.
• The results of each test call. 
• Specific troubleshooting tests that were attempted.
• The results of the troubleshooting tests.
• The moment each circuit was accepted.
• The moment the installation was abandoned and rescheduled (and
of course the reason for the abandonment).
200
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Installing the Circuit
There is a standard procedure for activating a circuit. Every carrier has its
own twist on how they do each step, but essentially, every dedicated circuit
installation follows a normal progression.
Before everyone arrives on the conference call to activate your circuit, you
are probably not connected to the new phone jacks, and your carrier will
have the T-1 level of your circuit busied out (that means that if you connect to
the jacks and try to call out over the circuit, you can’t complete a phone call,
or even receive dial tone). The technical term for the disposition of a dedi-
cated circuit prior to installation is IMB, or installation made busy state — see
the accompanying sidebar for more information about IMBs. So, you can’t
make any test calls until your carrier manually activates both the T-1s and
the individual channels, called DS-0s.
Step 1: Introducing and reviewing
After everyone is on the conference bridge, the first thing you need to do is
some general accounting and review. Some of the people on the call may be
calling in on their cellphones and working in a wireless-unfriendly environ-
ment (most phone closets or server rooms are wireless vacuums), so you will
need to write down everyone’s name, company name, and phone number so
you can call them back in case they get disconnected. 
If I haven’t already implied this throughout the chapter, let me be very clear:
you are running this conference call; you need to take the lead by running
through the details and getting the information you need. You’re essentially
coordinating the situation, so with your leadership (and barring any major
technological glitches that are outside your control) the situation is likely to
go smoothly. Or you could let the installation become a free-for-all or a circus
by not being in charge. Your choice.
When everyone is accounted for, review the specifics of the order you are
installing. This process should take no more than 30 seconds; run down 
 The number of circuits you’re about to install
 Their line coding and framing
 Their outpulse signal and start
 Their trunk group configuration
 The quantity of toll-free numbers 
 The DNIS configuration 
201
Chapter 10: Activating Your Dedicated Circuit and Toll-Free Numbers

You can rattle this information off just like a laundry list (check out Chapter 8
if you have questions about line coding, framing, and outpulse signal and
start peruse Chapter 9 for information about the RespOrg LOA, which
includes trunk group information and DNIS), but the idea is that you give
everyone a chance to validate what you are activating. If your carrier has
only two circuits listed for installation (and you’ve got eight), or a different
outpulse signal and start, it is better to find it now than after an hour and a
half of testing. 
Step 2: Connecting your hardware 
to your carrier
When everyone agrees on what’s being installed, and nobody is confused
about the order, connect your phone system to the new T-1 jack on the wall,
listed with the circuit ID for your new long-distance carrier. After you plug the
202
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 
Welcome to your own private 
Bermuda Triangle: IMB
Prior to installation, every dedicated circuit will
be in an installation made busy or IMB state.
Busying out the circuits in the IMB state pre-
vents the circuits from accessing your carrier’s
network and causing it to show alarms on your
circuits. All carriers monitor circuits, and if your
hardware isn’t installed, your carrier’s monitors
see the circuit open and alarms are activated in
your carrier’s network. By placing your circuits
in an IMB state, the network blocks your
access, your circuits aren’t seen as open, there-
by stopping those alarms from blaring. 
Whenever your carrier sees that your hardware
is disconnected from the dedicated circuits on
its network, an alarm sounds. Carriers hate
alarms. The official, consistent response to an
alarm is to place the circuit in an IMB state.
That means that if you disconnect your circuits
on Friday night to move some hardware from
one phone room to another, and you plug them
back in on Monday morning, you can expect to
be blocked from your carrier’s network. You will
have to arrive on Monday and open up a trou-
ble ticket with the carrier to have the dedicated
circuits taken out of IMB. It doesn’t matter if
your circuit has been up for six days or six
years; your carrier will eventually block your cir-
cuits and put them in IMB if you have them
unplugged for any significant amount of time. Of
course, the definition of significant varies from
carrier to carrier and day to day. Sometimes you
can go 12 hours before the IMB state is insti-
tuted. Other times you’re sent into limbo after
just two hours. You can call your carrier’s cus-
tomer service department on Friday and open a
tech assist trouble ticket for Monday morning
so that a technician is available to reactivate or
correct any circuits that don’t want to come
back to life. Your circuit stills end up in IMB, but
the trouble ticket provides someone to reacti-
vate the circuit before you need it. I cover set-
ting up tech assist tickets in greater detail in
Chapter 13.

cable into the jack, connecting your phone system to the local loop, your car-
rier should activate the circuit by bringing it out of IMB. Your circuit is now
live at the T-1 level, a fact that your carrier will confirm if your hardware
appears on the network radar.
Your carrier will always turn up the highest level circuit first, and work his
way down to the T-1 and the DS-0 level. If you ordered an OC-3, he will acti-
vate and test the OC-3 level first, and then the DS-3 level, the T-1 level, and
finally the individual channel or DS-0 level. You can’t activate the lower-level
circuits until the upper-level circuits are running clean. The DS-0s will not
come up if you are having problems at the T-1 level. 
Step 3: Activating the individual channels
The individual DS-0s will be activated after the T-1 level is working fine. At
this time, you know exactly how your installation is progressing. If the rep
from your carrier tells you he sees all of your channels up and idle, you
should be looking at a simple installation and you will be done soon. If your
carrier is having problems either at the T-1 or DS-0 level, it may take a few
hours to work through all the issues.
If problems arise, don’t forget to write down what the problems are, what
tests are run to resolve them, and so on.
Step 4: Making test calls
After the DS-0s are activated and everyone sees them in an idle state, you
can make some test calls. This is simply a fancy telecom way of saying make
a phone call. It is easier for everyone if you can isolate the exact channel you
are dialing out on for your test calls, because it allows the installation tech at
your carrier to monitor that circuit and watch you dial out. If your phone
system doesn’t allow you to designate a specific DS-0 to send out your call,
that isn’t a problem because your carrier can find the record of the call after
it is made. 
As long as you can grab one of the individual DS-0s, dial out, and the call
completes without any static, echo, or being sent to a recorded message
telling you that your call can’t be completed as dialed, you have a successful
test call. 
Test every T-1 circuit you have, just to ensure that all lines are working prop-
erly. When all of your test calls complete fine, you can accept the circuit from
your carrier and the carrier closes the dedicated circuit orders. 
203
Chapter 10: Activating Your Dedicated Circuit and Toll-Free Numbers

Step 5: Testing the toll-free numbers
Testing the inbound calls on a dedicated circuit is always done last. It would
be a catastrophe if you had moved over all of your toll-free numbers on to
your dedicated circuit only to find out that the circuit was configured incor-
rectly by your local carrier and won’t be fixed for 48 hours. Toll-free numbers
are very delicate creatures, and after you move them someplace they aren’t
supposed to be, it may take quite a bit of effort to move them back as they
were intended.
If you’re migrating existing toll-free numbers 
to a new circuit with a new carrier
If you’re activating existing toll-free numbers that were migrated from another
carrier, you need to have your carrier build a test toll-free number before you
do anything. Your carrier should have an inventory of toll-free numbers for
this very purpose. Together, you and the installation technician need to do
the following:
1. Technician configures one of the carrier’s test toll-free numbers with
the same DNIS digits, ANI delivery, and ANI Infodigits requirements
that you’re using for your toll-free numbers. 
2. Technician points this fake number to your new circuit. 
3. You call the test toll-free number.
4. You and the technician confirm that the test number is hitting your
phone system, that the DNIS is being accepted, and that the call is
being sent to the correct extension within your office. 
5. If a problem is discovered, the technician makes corrections and you
go back to Step 1 of this list before the toll-free numbers are updated
to the route path. 
Potential problems include incorrect information being sent in the DNIS
stream, or an incorrect routing (meaning that the call isn’t hitting your
circuit).
At the time of installation, your new carrier must be in RespOrg control of
the toll-free numbers; however, the carrier won’t be receiving the traffic on
its network yet. Only after the calls on the test toll-free number successfully
complete should the carrier update the SMS database and have the calls
routed onto its network. If the installation technician routes the calls onto
the carrier’s network before the test calls are terminating properly, he may
not be able to send the calls back to route over the previous carrier in the
event of a problem, essentially endangering your ability to accept calls
from your toll-free numbers. At that time you would either have to accept
that your toll-free numbers are down until your carrier can repair the prob-
lem, or escalate with your carrier to find someone in either the RespOrg
204
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

department or toll-free routing department that can send the traffic for your
toll-free numbers back to the previous carrier. During this process, it’s very
important for you to listen to the sequence of events so that you don’t inad-
vertently let something happen that could prevent you from using your
phone lines. If something bad happens to your toll-free numbers at this
point, go to Chapter 9 for assistance and options for resolution.
If you’re activating new toll-free numbers to a new dedicated circuit
If you are activating brand-new toll-free numbers, you can use one of your
numbers as your test number because if the numbers are down for another
24 or 48 hours, it shouldn’t really matter (the loss of toll-free number access
that heretofore hadn’t existed is inconvenient but doesn’t threaten your 
business). 
Your carrier’s installation technician and your hardware vendor should be
able to see the exact DNIS stream being sent back and forth. As long as the
call is hitting your circuit, the technician should be able to correct the rest of
the handshaking issues (issues that affect how your phone hardware and you
carrier’s hardware play well together).
Identifying Installation Problems
There are three general problems you may experience during an installation.
The first problem stems from a lack of connectivity, the second stems from
failing hardware, and the third stems from an issue with configuration. 
Issues of connectivity
Connectivity issues are usually caused by problems with the physical wiring.
If the wiring doesn’t run without any gaps from your long-distance carrier
(on a long-distance circuit), through your local carrier, and end up in your
building, you will have a problem. There may be a dozen points between
your carrier and your phone system where the wiring is cross-connected
onto new circuits or through new hardware. If any of those connections
were not completed, you will have an opening on your circuit. It is as if you
have a broken water line. You may have good pipes at your home, and they
have good pipes leaving the water company, but somewhere in the middle,
things aren’t connected. 
Connectivity issues affect the entire circuit. If your T-1 is not cross-connected
somewhere in the system, your carrier will not be able to detect your hard-
ware, and you will not be able to see them either. 
205
Chapter 10: Activating Your Dedicated Circuit and Toll-Free Numbers

Issues of hardware failure
If a piece of hardware is failing somewhere in the system, you will be able to
see your carrier, and they will be able to see you, but there will be errors on
the circuit. These errors may result in you hearing static on all of your calls,
the calls may disconnect prematurely, or you may not be able to complete a
call. Fortunately, the same troubleshooting for continuity also works to iso-
late issues where someone’s hardware is generating errors.
Configuration issues
Configuration issues are simple for a competent vendor to detect. As long as
you are configured the same as your carrier, everything should work fine.
The problem comes in when you have a vendor that does not know your
hardware. If you ordered your circuit as B8ZS/ESF Loopstart, and your hard-
ware vendor cannot confirm that your Newbridge 3624 Mainstreet (or what-
ever hardware you have) is configured that way, you need a new hardware
vendor. If your technician is nice, he or she will slowly change all the settings
to see what works for your channel bank, but that may take hours to reconfig-
ure for each protocol. To avoid configuration issues, ensure that your hard-
ware vendor can positively confirm all aspects of your hardware and change
them if necessary.
Troubleshooting Continuity Issues
Before we begin troubleshooting, we should look at a standard hardware
design for a dedicated circuit and see who is responsible for what section of
the circuit.
Figure 10-1 shows the standard layout for a dedicated long-distance circuit,
regardless of who ordered the local loop. The only variations you may have
from this would be the location of your CSU (it may be inside your multiplexer).
Also, the responsibility of the circuit from your local carrier may include an
extended demarc point or jack in your phone room if the local carrier pro-
vided the inside wiring and not just the network interface unit (NIU).
You’re responsible for all issues within your phone system through all the hard-
ware and wiring to the NIU dropped by your local carrier. The local carrier is
responsible from the NIU to the location where the local carrier hands off the
circuit to your long-distance carrier at the Carrier Facilities Assignment (CFA)
point, and your long-distance carrier is responsible for everything beyond that
point. If you have any questions about the NIU, CFA, or POP listed in the dia-
gram, check out your dedicated circuit options in Chapter 8 and look for hard-
ware details (such as info on CSUs and multiplexers) in Chapter 4.
206
Part III: Ordering and Setting Up Telecom Service 

Any continuity issue or problem where you are taking errors on a circuit
must be isolated down to the piece of hardware or carrier responsible for 
the issue. The standard procedure is to have your carrier test to the farthest
point on the circuit, and then slowly step back until a point is reached where
there is continuity without errors.

Chapter 10: Activating Your Dedicated Circuit and Toll-Free Numbers
Asking for installation trouble resolution timelines
Trouble is handled with a bit more urgency
during an installation. It may be handled more
efficiently because the installation techs have
more time to focus on pushing the repair than
the customer care techs (who are handling mul-
tiple trouble tickets and are overloaded with
escalations) usually have. If there is an issue
with the local loop, you can expect some action
to be taken in about three hours. If it is some-
thing within your carrier’s network, they may be
able to resolve it in 60 to 90 minutes. 
Always ask for an approximate repair time
frame for any issue you have during a dedicated
circuit installation, because you may have dis-
connected your old carrier from your hardware
and have no phone service until the issue is
fixed. If the problem is going to take more than
a few hours to resolve, you will have to decide
whether you need to take your phone service
back to your old carrier in the meantime. This is
the only difference when troubleshooting a new
circuit versus troubleshooting an active circuit.
Skip to Chapter 13 for basics on troubleshooting
dedicated outbound call issues.

elecom is a club fight, and this maxim is most evident
in troubleshooting. Carriers and vendors commonly
become agitated and pass the buck. Unless you know
more than the people you’re talking to, you may end up
accepting what you’re told and run off to troubleshoot
your issue down a blind alley.  
By getting a methodical system for troubleshooting any
phone service you may have, you can prevent yourself
from being misled. Take the keys to the telecom kingdom!
Part IV takes the essential pieces of all previous chapters
and reassembles them so that you can resolve outbound
and toll-free trouble issues. Starting with the basics of
troubleshooting and the isolation of the variables in any
phone call, you break down outbound and toll-free calls
from a standard phone line. The final chapter covers the
step-by-step troubleshooting of dedicated circuits, and
toll-free calls that terminate on your dedicated circuits.

T
he one thing I can guarantee about your phone service is that there
will be a day when it won’t work. The problem might be minor and
short lived, or all encompassing and last for days. If the problem doesn’t
affect everyone in your area, the speed at which it’s resolved is based on
how quickly you provide accurate information to your carrier. The carrier
might be unaware of any problem in your area until you report it. 
This chapter covers the structure of the trouble-reporting network within
your carrier, to help you understand what information the carrier needs.
I also walk you through the basic information that telecom companies
use to isolate problems, including a general overview of all the responsible
parties handling a call. I explain how to determine whether you should
report a problem as a dedicated or switched issue. Finally, I cover some
tips on managing and tracking your issues.

Understanding Troubleshooting Basics
When you begin troubleshooting a problem, you are under the assumption
that something in your phone system isn’t performing at an acceptable level.
For example, you might have echo when you call your grandmother or static
when you call work. You might not be able to get through to your girlfriend
because someone in the world of telecom thinks that her number has been
disconnected or is no longer in service. The issue can affect all of your calls,
both inbound and outbound, or just outbound calls to a specific city or state.
Before you can begin testing a specific issue, you have to narrow down the
problem. 
When troubleshooting your issues, it’s not your responsibility to correct the
problem. Your main responsibility is to accurately report the issue. You can
speed the process along by doing some troubleshooting yourself, but gener-
ally only your carriers or your hardware vendor can fix a problem. By isolat-
ing the issue to a single source, either a carrier or a piece of hardware, you
can reduce the troubleshooting time by hours or possibly days.
The first step in troubleshooting is to systematically isolate the potential
causes and eliminate them one by one. You are aided in this process by
simply observing whether the issue affects a variety of calls or just a small
group of them. Every type of call, whether it’s inbound to your toll-free
number or outbound to a local business, is handled by a different group of
carriers. Any issue that isn’t intermittent is easy to track down and trou-
bleshoot by checking a handful of call types. There are only six varieties of
call, so by figuring out the characteristics of the issue, you can either elimi-
nate or indicate the source of the problem. 
212
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 
Using good troubleshooting etiquette
If you aren’t used to dealing with phone prob-
lems, it can be a very stressful and frustrating
process. These conditions sometimes make
people aggressive and emotional, two traits that
don’t help you as you resolve these issues with
your carrier. As you go through the trou-
bleshooting process, try to build goodwill with
the carrier’s representatives. They might run
you through an automated system that takes
two hours before you get to speak to a techni-
cian, but if the technician likes you when you
finally do get to chat, he or she might let you call
directly the next time. On the other hand, if you
call the carrier with an attitude and venom in
every word, the representative might be less
than compassionate or concerned about the
outcome of your problem.

Switched outbound long-distance call
A switched outbound long-distance call is one of the most basic calls that
people make every day. You make this call from a regular phone line, just like
the one at your house, to a phone number that is outside of your LATA (Local
Access Transport Area), state, or country. The distilled version of the call is
represented in Figure 11-1.
You can see in Figure 11-1 how the call starts with your phone system (your
phone system may be as simple as a single phone attached to a jack), and
then progresses from your local carrier, to your long-distance carrier, to the
local carrier that handles the service for the person you are calling, and
finally to the phone you are actually calling. This is one of the most basic
calls that you make, and probably the type of call that experiences the
greatest quantity of issues.
Before you can pinpoint a problem to any variable in the diagram, you need
to compare the call to at least one of the remaining five call types.
The public switched telephone network, or PSTN, is a generic term for all the
long-distance carrier (Points of Presence) POPs, and hardware that routes
and directs phone calls, as well as the local carrier central offices (COs), and
all of their hardware that routes and directs phone calls. While a call is being
sent through the PSTN, it is aggregated onto circuits with other calls for part
of the path it takes from origin to termination. Imagine the PSTN is like a huge
freeway for phone calls. All calls use the same roads, sometimes only until
the nearest offramp, and sometimes for hundreds of miles. If a problem on a
call happens while it’s being routed through the PSTN, the issue is said to be
in the switched network, even if the call originally started, or ended, on a dedi-
cated circuit.

Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

Switched inbound long-distance call
A switched inbound long-distance call is a very helpful call type because it
eliminates your long-distance carrier as a potential cause of any issue. The
long-distance portion of the PSTN is filled with hardware that routes and
maintains the quality of your call. The greater the distance the call must
travel through the PSTN, the more hardware is required to maintain the call.
More hardware, of course, means that there are more potential points of fail-
ure, and so you are more likely to encounter a problem in the 28 or 2,800
miles where your long-distance carrier is handling your call. 
As you can see in Figure 11-2, when someone calls directly into your phone
system (not using a toll-free number), the caller doesn’t use your long-distance
carrier. If you have a problem on both outbound long-distance calls and
inbound long-distance calls, you can eliminate your long-distance carrier as
the source.
Switched local call (inbound or outbound)
A switched local call uses the same carrier and interacts with the same
hardware (carrier hardware and your phone system) for both outbound and
inbound calls. It doesn’t matter if you call your friend across the street or if
someone calls you; the only carrier that generally ever sees your call is the
local carrier you both use. Figure 11-3 offers a visual representation of this
call type.

Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

You can see in Figure 11-3 that the call barely enters the PSTN and might pass
through only one central office. If you have a problem with a local call, the
possible sources are your phone system and the local carrier.
Dialing someone else’s toll-free number
When you dial someone else’s toll-free number, the only piece of the call that
you have any responsibility for is your phone system. Your local carrier is
responsible for identifying the carrier that receives the traffic, and then your
local carrier forwards the call to that network. Figure 11-4 shows the path the
call takes when you dial someone else’s toll-free number.
If you have a problem calling someone else’s toll-free number, but all of your
other calls work fine, the problem probably has something to do with either
the carrier that handles the traffic of the toll-free number, or the local carrier
that terminates the call. Identifying which carrier is the problem is covered in
the step-by-step troubleshooting section for toll-free numbers in Chapter 12.
Many companies use the same long-distance carriers. If you use Sprint for
your long distance and you dial the toll-free number of a company that also
uses Sprint for long distance, you can possibly see a similar problem on your
outbound calls. In this case, you should focus on troubleshooting your out-
bound long-distance calls on the Sprint network. When Sprint resolves your
outbound issue, the toll-free problem for the company you are dialing to will
probably also be fixed. 
Someone is dialing your switched 
toll-free number
The last switched call type is an inbound call to your toll-free number. The
diagram for this call, shown in Figure 11-5, looks quite a bit like Figure 11-1. It
includes the same path.

Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

The main aspect that separates a toll-free issue from a regular outbound
issue is the fact that the call is being sent to your long-distance carrier based
on a database check done by the originating local carrier. Aside from how the
call is sent to your long-distance carrier, the path the call takes encountersall
the same carriers and hardware it would if you had made an outbound call to
the origination number. 
Dedicated calling
You can compare calls over your dedicated circuits with switched calls in
order to eliminate your local carrier as a possible source of the problem.
Figure 11-6 shows how the local loop of your dedicated circuit passes
through your local carrier, but doesn’t really interact with it.

Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 
Keeping the switched network in mind when you
have a problem on a dedicated circuit
When you report trouble on your dedicated cir-
cuit, keep in mind that the local loop is the dedi-
cated section your calls pass through. If you have
constant echo, static, dropped calls, or if the
entire circuit is completely down, you should
refer to your circuit when you open the trouble
ticket. If you have any problems that you can
duplicate by dialing out on a regular phone line
over your carrier’s switched network, such as
calls failing to a certain area code, fax comple-
tion problems, static, or echo, you should open a
trouble ticket with your carrier based on the call
from your regular phone line. If the problem exists
on both your switched and dedicated calls, but
you open the ticket as a dedicated issue, the
problem will be harder to diagnose. 
Carriers do assign greater priority to dedicated
circuits, but they also push to intrusively test
your circuit as the first step in troubleshooting.
The intrusive testing process prevents you from
using any channel on your circuit during the
testing. If you can open the trouble ticket on a
call from a regular phone line, your carrier won’t
be distracted by your T-1 and waste time test-
ing your local loop.

There are only three elements that interact at the individual channel (DS-0)
level on a dedicated circuit:
 Your channel bank or multiplexer: This is the piece of hardware at
your office that breaks the dedicated T-1 circuit down into 24 useable
DS-0 circuits that transmit and receive your phone calls.
 Your carrier’s switch: The one piece of hardware in your carrier’s
switch that you should be concerned with is the section that functions
like your multiplexer.
 Echo cancellers: These pieces of hardware eliminate the echo on your
phone calls. They may be in your long-distance carrier’s network between
the POP and the local carrier, or within the local carrier network.
The next important area to note in the diagram is the point where the call
enters your carrier’s network to the point where it’s delivered to the recipi-
ent’s phone. Figure 11-7 shows an expanded view of a dedicated call.

Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

In Figure 11-7, you can now see that the local loop begins at your building and
ends at the CFA (Carrier Facilities Assignment) point where the local loop
enters your long-distance carrier’s network within their POP. (Check out
Chapter 8 if you have any question about the CFA point.) The majority of a
dedicated call actually isn’t dedicated at all, but is handled by the PSTN,
where it’s routed and handled with every other call in your carrier’s network. 
Comparing call types 
Call type diagrams are great tools when you are troubleshooting. You should
record the types of calls you have made and note whether they experienced
the problem. Then you can refer to the diagrams and begin eliminating vari-
ables. For example, if you have static on local calls and inbound calls, but not
on dedicated calls, you can distill the variables in the following manner, as
shown in Figure 11-8.

Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

When troubleshooting, look for similar paths. For example, when you compare
the diagrams of the inbound calls and the local calls, you see that there are
only two variables in common: your phone system and the network of your
local carrier. Local calls are commonly handled by your phone system,
your local carrier, and the phone system of whomever you are calling. If you
simply call another person in your local area and have the same problem,
you can eliminate the hardware of the first person you called as the potential
problem. The only two variables left for you to investigate are your phone
system and your local carrier.
Every inbound long-distance call that comes from various companies in dif-
ferent sections of the world has its own local and long-distance carrier.
Therefore, you can quickly eliminate the other long-distance carrier and the
other phone system. The only variables that can possibly be causing a prob-
lem are either your phone system or your local carrier. 
After you consider the call from your dedicated circuit that did not have the
problem, you can eliminate your phone system as a possible source of the
issue. As long as you are dialing out from the same phone system over both
your dedicated circuit and your switched lines, it’s very unlikely that your
phone system is the source of the problem. You have now reduced the possible
sources of the problem to just one entity (your local carrier). The next step is
to call the local carrier and open a trouble ticket. It’s helpful to let the local
carrier know about the tests you have done and that the problem doesn’t
affect calls on your dedicated circuit, where they don’t interact at DS-0 level. 
Narrowing down carrier-level problems
If your problem persists on all your calls, but you’ve narrowed down the
source to one of your carriers (eliminating hardware as a source), you can
219
Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services
Keeping an open mind to the information
The speed at which a problem is resolved is
directly related to how well you accept the
results of your testing. It’s not uncommon for
people to place the calls side by side and have a
good indication of where a problem is, but not
troubleshoot that section first. This is very
common when all the signs indicate that the
issue is with your hardware. Open a technician
assistance ticket (also called a tech assist ticket)
with your carrier to schedule a time with their
technician to walk you through testing and work
with your hardware vendor. The help of your car-
rier’s technician aids your hardware vendor in
isolating issues within your phone system, but
your first call should be to your hardware vendor
if you suspect that is the site of your issue.

easily locate the issue and make sure that it gets repaired. If the problem
doesn’t affect all of your calls, you might need to focus more on the pattern
of failures within the carrier. 
There are three additional bits of information that can help save time when
you open your trouble ticket. Ask the following questions:
 Is the issue specific to a time of day? Your carrier might be sending your
calls over an overflow route that isn’t very stable at peak network times
between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. If this is the case, the issue might be with a
route that isn’t used or monitored very often. If the problem happens
intermittently during your peak times and not the peak times of your car-
rier, you might have a bottleneck in your own phone system. Time-of-day
issues typically indicate a problem based on the volume of calls passing
over a network, and identifying a problem this way can steer the techni-
cians to a faster resolution. Share the information; it’s good for everyone.
 Is the issue geographically specific? If you can call everywhere in
America except the West coast, the state of South Carolina, LATA 730,
the 305 area code, or any geographic region that you can identify in a
telecom-based group, note this information to your carrier. If there has
been a large outage affecting all calls to the West coast, your carrier
might not know this until you call.
 Is the issue intermittent? If the problem occurs randomly, regardless of
time of day or geography, get ready to settle in for a long troubleshooting
process. The first thing to do about intermittent issues is determine the
percentage of calls affected. Issues that affect about 50 percent of your
calls are not that difficult to find, because if your carrier watches 10 test
calls, the problem is bound to show up in around half of them, making it
easier to research and repair. If the problem affects 5 or 10 percent of your
calls, you may make 10 or 20 test calls before one call is affected. When
less than 10 percent of your calls are affected by a problem, you enter the
world of the needle in the haystack. As long as both you and your carrier
stay focused and have the time to devote to troubleshooting, you will
eventually find the problem. If the issue is low on your priority list, it
might persist for weeks or months. 
Getting the Most from Your Carrier’s
Troubleshooting Department
Most carriers have a two-tier structure for handling problems. The first tier of
people you meet are the entry-level customer service folks. These people
generally work from a script that asks you specific questions to qualify your
issue. After a customer service agent has all the information he or she needs,
you’re given a trouble ticket number for tracking purposes. 
220
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

If the first tier of customer service can’t resolve the problem, the trouble
ticket is sent to the network technicians, who make up the next level of sup-
port. These people can manipulate the network, update switches, perform
tests, and are empowered to fix the complex things that go wrong. These are
the people you want to speak with when you have a complex issue. 
If you have a difficult and intricate issue, give the first-level customer service
people just enough information to open the ticket and ask to chat with a tech-
nician. If you begin trying to tell the customer service rep all the minutiae of
the problem, it might get lost in translation from you, to them, to the notes,
to the tech. It’s always safer to simply get the ticket open, press for a tech,
and then explain it all to the tech.
There are three points to keep in mind when chatting with the first-tier cus-
tomer service staff:
 The rep you talk to is probably working off a script that has required
information. You can’t proceed without going through this stuff. If you
don’t have all the information you need, things won’t go very far, so
make sure you gather as many details as you can before you pick up the
phone. For example, if you have a problem dialing a phone number in
Alaska, but you don’t know the number you dialed because you lost
your notes, the carrier can’t open the trouble ticket. 
 All the information you give guides how your problem is handled. If
you tell the customer care rep that your dedicated circuit can’t dial to
area code 414, the ticket will be sent to the dedicated department to test
your T-1 lines. If the same problem happens when dialing phone numbers
in the 414 area code from your switched phone lines, the trouble ticket is
sent to the department in your carrier devoted to handling calls from the
PSTN in the 414 area code to determine why that area code is failing. 
It is always preferable to open a trouble ticket as an outbound switched
problem if it affects that call type. This option is always the most direct
route to resolution and prevents your carrier from being distracted by
inconsequential aspects of the problem. The same holds true for an
issue that affects both your inbound and outbound toll-free calls to a
specific area. Opening a trouble ticket as a toll-free problem focuses
your carrier on the toll-free aspect of the call (SMS database construc-
tion, areas of coverage, and nuances that are particular to toll-free num-
bers), and not  on the overall network (which is actually the source of
the problem). 
 The person who opens your ticket is one of your greatest allies. He or
she can escalate the ticket on your behalf, monitor its progress, and call
in favors to resolve your issue. Because the customer service rep is
capable of doing so much for you (and has the power to do nothing at
all), always be nice. If the customer service person you are chatting with
doesn’t understand what you are saying, graciously ask for a supervisor. 
221
Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

Identifying your call treatment
When you call to report a problem with your phone service, the rep at your
carrier asks you to describe it. The more specifically you can describe the
issue, the easier it is to find and repair. The rep might directly ask you for the
call treatment, or the symptoms of the failed, or substandard call. This is where
telecom can seem like a foreign language. You know what is happening, but
putting it into words that can be understood might not be that simple. The
main call treatments you will encounter are listed in the following sections.
Understanding why “your call cannot be completed as dialed”
If you hear a recording that tells you that your call can’t be completed as
dialed, you may have misdialed the number, the area code of the number you
are dialing having changed, or a translation problem may have occurred in a
carrier network somewhere along the line. This recording generally indicates
that the problem affects an individual phone number. Your ability to dial
other numbers in the state, town, or country is usually not impacted. Try the
number again, check the digits and the area code, and then make the call to
your carrier’s customer service.
222
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 
Understanding the translating and routing of calls
Every carrier receiving a call must determine
where to send the call; then it must send it. These
two activities represent two of the most common
areas causing the failure of calls. Translation is
the process a carrier undertakes to identify the
destination of the network that must receive the
call. Long-distance networks don’t send calls all
the way to the end telephone receiving the call;
the local carrier handles that job. The long-dis-
tance carrier sends the call to the local carrier’s
specified central office (CO). If the local carrier
decides to use a different CO to ring your phone,
but your long-distance carrier is not aware of the
change, your long-distance carrier sends the call
to the wrong CO and the call fails. This problem is
corrected by the translations department at your
long-distance carrier, because the translations of
the number you dialed to the correct CO must be
resolved.
When a carrier’s network determines where to
terminate a call (by choosing the correct local
carrier CO) the carrier has to deliver the call to
that location. The route is the path the call takes
from the moment it enters the carrier’s network
to the point it leaves the carrier’s network. The
routing department within each carrier monitors
these routes and prevents them from being con-
gested. If one main circuit fails, calls proceed
through a secondary or tertiary route set up by
the routing department. If a large outage
occurs, or calls fail on their way to the correct
local carrier CO, the routing department identi-
fies the fault in the network and repairs it.

Understanding why “the number you have called has been 
disconnected or is no longer in service”
A recording that says that the number has been disconnected or is no longer
in service might be legitimate; the number has simply been disconnected. If
you know it’s not disconnected, either you misdialed the number, or there is
a translation issue somewhere.
Handling an “all circuits are busy” message
On rare occasions you may hear a recording that tells you that all circuits are
busy. This recording rarely means that all the circuits available in your carrier’s
network are occupied, unless you are trying to call your Mom at 9 a.m. on
Mother’s Day, along with everyone else in the world. This recording is generally
played when your carrier has an outage of some sort and a portion of their net-
work is down. If a backhoe accidentally cuts through a phone line, thereby
taking down phone service for the entire city, you will probably hear this
recording when you try to dial out (the carrier unfortunately doesn’t have a
sorry, but our main phone line has been cut by a backhoe recording).
Listening for tones and tags
Tones and tags are supplemental sounds or recordings and are generally
attached to a standard recording. Listen for tri-tones that are played before
recordings by a local carrier. They are generally three ascending notes that
sound like they come from a cheap synthesizer — very shrill and high pitched.
The tags are more important because they frequently list the switch that is
playing the message. If you hear a recording of your call cannot be completed
as dialed — fifteen dash two, you know that switch 15 on your carrier’s net-
work probably has a problem. If you hear tones and tags during a recording,
be sure to note them, because alerting a technician to the specific tags can
shorten the amount of time it takes to solve your problem. Instead of tracking
down the failed call, the technicians can go directly to switch 15 and analyze
it. The number after the dash may correspond to the recording played (for
example, the two in this example may mean cannot be completed as dialed).
On the other hand, the number may have no significance at all. Every carrier
has its own system for the tags played. The tags may mean nothing to some
carriers, but to others they can be significant. I say you should always have
more information than less.
Understanding the fast busy signal
A fast busy signal is a busy signal that sounds twice as fast as the normal busy
signal. You will probably hear a fast busy signal when part of your carrier’s
network is down (the pesky backhoe again — see “Handling an ‘all circuits are
busy’ message,” earlier in this chapter), so your call can’t be completed.
223
Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

Handling echo, echo, echo
Usually, only one person on a call hears an echo. Carriers have specific pieces
of hardware installed throughout their network called echo cancellers (or echo
cans) to eliminate echoes on calls. These devices can fail over time, be mis-
optioned, or mistakenly installed backwards. The interesting thing is that if
one person hears an echo on a call, it’s probably the result of a bad echo can
on the other side of the call. Sometimes, both people can hear the echo, but
it’s not as common.
Echo doesn’t manifest itself in a way that’s immediately visible to the techni-
cians at your carrier. If your call fails to a fast busy signal, your carrier can
pull the call record and find the switch that killed the call. Some issues, such
as dropped calls or static, are visible in a circuit’s performance report, which
indicates that there has been an electrical or protocol-related anomaly. Echo
on a call, however, doesn’t leave a trail of breadcrumbs and is therefore a dif-
ficult issue to isolate and repair.
The reverberation of voice that people hear and classify as echo might also
be the result of something other than a failing or mis-optioned echo can. This
other type of echo is referred to as hot levels, and is the result of the over-
amplification of a voice in the transmission of the call. If you didn’t have an
equalizer in your stereo and you cranked the volume up as far as it could go,
your sound quality would be horrible and you would experience reverbera-
tion (or what you might call echo). To compensate for volume loss as calls
are transmitted across hundreds of miles over circuits within the network,
the switches in the POPs will boost the sound a fraction of a decibel, what is
called padding the call, to keep the signal strong. The problem is that if the
carrier amplifies the sound too much, you will hear echo. What is worse is
that hot levels have cumulative effects.
If a call travels 15 miles and is padded 0.4 decibels in the two pieces of hard-
ware it encounters, you won’t hear echo. In fact, as long as the call has fewer
than two decibels of padding from start to finish, you won’t have a problem.
If the call is traveling from coast to coast and each of the six long-distance
POPs bumps the volume up 0.4 decibels, the call now has 3.2 additional deci-
bels in padding. You can bet you will hear echo. The cumulative nature of hot
levels makes it difficult to find and correct. In situations like this, the issue
might persist for weeks before the carrier finds all the offending switches and
reduces the padding.
Standing up to static
Only one side of a call usually hears static, but it does affect both incoming
and outgoing calls. It’s generally caused by a piece of hardware slowly dying
in the network. The static can be very minor to begin with, but grows over
time until you can’t hear the person you’re calling, or they can’t hear you. As
224
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

the issue evolves, the piece of hardware will eventually die and all of your
calls will fail. Don’t feel bad; the bigger the issue, the easier it is to find. When
the static is noticeable on every call, it becomes simple to track it down and
replace the affected hardware.
Echo might be invisible to the technicians monitoring a network, but gener-
ally static isn’t. Almost all circuits in the U.S. are capable of being monitored
for quality. This doesn’t mean someone from your phone company is listen-
ing in on calls to ensure that they sound clean, but computer files can cap-
ture any unexpected electronic or protocol activity on a circuit. Static can be
classified as unexpected electric activity, as it’s some device experiencing an
electrical short. The performance monitors (PMs) are diagnostic files for a cir-
cuit that record the electric and protocol anomalies. The challenge with
static is finding the correct span causing the problem. If you’re dealing with
an intermittent issue affecting five percent of your calls somewhere in the
switched network for your carrier, the possible locations of the failing hard-
ware can seem endless.
Dealing with dead air
Dead air is a term that refers to the phenomenon when you hear nothing on
the other end after you dial a phone number. You don’t hear the dial tone
anymore, but you also don’t hear any ringing; you just hear nothing. When
you hear dead air, stay on the call for 30 to 60 seconds; you’ll probably hear a
fast busy signal if you wait long enough. Dead air is generally caused by a
translation or routing problem that caused your call to be transferred to a
piece of hardware or a circuit that no longer exists. Because the hardware no
longer exists, nothing is there to send you a polite recording, busy signal, or
anything. All you get is dead air.
Dead air isn’t the same thing as post dial delay (PDD). PDD is the silence you
hear for a few seconds before you hear the ringing. Every call has some PDD,
albeit it might last only one second. International calls are notorious for long
PDD; anywhere from 15to 30 seconds may pass before you hear the phone
ring on the other end.
Getting around clipping 
Clipping is the technical opposite of echo. With echo, a voice is repeated;
with clipping, sections of the voice transmission are lost. Instead of hearing
the conversation in full, you hear only sections of each word, because a
few milliseconds are lost every second. This problem is solved just like echo
or hot levels, but instead of having too much volume on the call, you have
insufficient volume. The troubleshooting process for clipping is the same
as any quality issue and requires both patience and a large quantity of call
examples. 
225
Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

Dancing around dropped calls 
Phone calls that are disconnected before either person hangs up are deemed
dropped calls. If your phone system loses power while you are talking, it will
drop your call. The same thing happens if you are calling over a dedicated cir-
cuit that suddenly fails or takes an electrical hit. Dropped calls are researched
by your carrier and the exact cause of the disconnection is identified by a dis-
connect code passed through the network when the call ends. The disconnect
code identifies whether the call was dropped by the origination side of the
call, the termination side of the call, or an unknown event in the carrier’s net-
work. Dropped calls are generally the result of a failing piece of hardware and
typically become more frequent until the source of the problem is evident. If
your carrier is causing the disconnections, its technicians will find the failing
hardware by protocol failures in the protocol monitors of the circuit.
Handling aberrant recordings
Each carrier has a few standard recordings; you don’t hear a ton of variety.
Any other recordings you hear probably come from your phone system. Your
carrier doesn’t have any recordings on file that say, “We regret that you were
unable to access an outside line,” or “Your long-distance carrier is currently
rejecting your call.” 
If you receive any recording that refers to your carrier, it probably was not
made by the carrier’s network. You might want to check with the carrier first to
ensure the message isn’t in its play list, but then you need to investigate, either
with your phone system, or with the phone system of the number you dialed. 
Working around incomplete dialing sequences
If you dial a long-distance phone number and the call is dropped after you
press six or seven of the digits, you have two possible sources to check: 
 Incomplete dialing sequence caused by local carrier: If your local carrier
perceives that the number you are dialing is a local call, it might try to
complete it after the seventh digit. If the call is actually a long-distance
one, you need to take this issue up with your local carrier immediately. 
 Incomplete dialing sequence caused by your phone system: This situa-
tion can also occur on some phone systems when international numbers
are dialed. Your phone system might limit you to dialing ten digits.
Because the international prefix of 011 already takes up three digits, and
then possibly two to six digits for just the country and city code, you
can easily reach the limit set by your phone system. Your call is dropped
even before it leaves the office. You need to talk to your hardware
vendor so that your phone configuration can be changed.
226
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

If you are dialing from a switched phone line, you must be able to com-
plete dialing all the digits of a phone number before your local carrier
processes your call and sends it to your long-distance carrier. If you
have a dedicated circuit, check your phone system and then contact
your long-distance carrier. The long-distance carrier can watch you dial
the phone number and see every digit you enter. More important, the
technician can determine whether the hang up on the call is being initi-
ated by your phone system or by the network. When you know the
cause of the disconnection, you know where to turn to resolve it.
Providing a call example
A call example contains detailed information that allows your carrier to
follow the call’s path from the moment you first dialed the number to the
point the call failed. As technical as the idea sounds, a call example is just the
information you write down about a failed call. After you dial out and get a
cannot be completed as dialed recording, dial the number again and write
down the necessary information (see the following sections for more informa-
tion about what to include in your notes). When the carrier finds the call’s
end point, the technician can begin correcting the issue.
Call examples function to not only tell the technicians where to look for the
problem, but also to allow the customer service rep to categorize the issue.
Depending on the information you provide, the customer service rep will
send your issue to a specific department for repair.
Call examples might not be easy to come by in some instances. If you are call-
ing a number you dial often and the call fails, you will know all the information
required to open a trouble ticket. The challenge comes in when customers
dialing in on your toll-free number have an issue. Customers might not have
your direct phone line to tell you that they couldn’t get through and report the
issue. Even if they do get through to you, it’s not common to begin your con-
versation with a quiz about the specifics of a failed call attempt. As a result,
you might have to ask one of your customers to make test calls for you. The
specific information your carrier needs is listed in the following sections.
Call examples have a shelf life of about 24 hours. The specific information
about how a call is routed is kept in your carrier’s switches for a finite amount
of time before it’s overwritten with new, more recent calls. If an issue crops up
on Friday at 5 p.m., you need your carrier immediately. If you try to provide
the call example from Friday when you come into the office on Monday, your
carrier will probably reject it and ask you to give them a newer one.
227
Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

The date and time of call
Every call is logged into your carrier’s switches by the origination time. If
you made four calls to a phone number and only two of them failed, be sure
to give your technician as much information as possible to help differentiate
the completed calls from the failed ones. If you provide one call example and
don’t mention the other three attempts, the technician might find one of the
completed calls and close the ticket because their research indicated that
the call didn’t fail. 
There are four time zones in North America, plus Alaska and Hawaii, so be
sure to identify the time zone when you provide a call example. If you don’t
tell your carrier that the call was made at 8 a.m. eastern standard time, the
customer service person might record the time by using a local time zone.
The origination phone number
You might be one of 10,000 people who call a specific phone number every
day. The only way to isolate your call from all the others is by referencing it
back to your phone number. 
If you are calling from a phone system that randomly assigns a line as you
dial out, you might not know the originating phone number. This isn’t a prob-
lem. Generally, the outbound phone lines you dial from are provided in
sequence, so simply use any of the numbers as your origination, and then tell
your technician that you are dialing from a phone system. The technician will
note this fact in the ticket. When the call examples are found, the technician
can trace the call back to your office by matching the area code and the first
three digits of your phone number.
The number you dialed and the call treatment
If you made 5,000 calls in the past three hours, and one of them failed, your
carrier needs to know which one out of the 5,000 numbers you dialed was the
problem child. Seems reasonable, yes? The phone number you dialed gives
your carrier an idea of the geographic area you are dialing into and is essen-
tial for tracking down the problem.
See “Identifying your call treatment,” earlier in this chapter, for more on what
information you should include when you describe the call treatment. Saying
that the phone call “just didn’t work” . . . just doesn’t work.
Understanding when to provide 
multiple call examples
A phone call has many paths it can take to reach its destination. Depending
on fluctuations in the capacity of the network between the two points, you
could make 10 calls to the same number in 15 minutes and your calls may
228
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

never take the exact same route twice. Understanding the complexities of the
phone systems is the key to resolving intermittent issues. The larger a prob-
lem, the easier it is to track down and repair. If you hear dead air, static, or
echo on 5 percent of all your calls, you need to provide as many call exam-
ples as possible.
Whenever you have an intermittent issue, it’s very helpful to provide to your
carrier clean call examples in addition to problem calls. This will allow the
technician to review all the calls and begin comparing the individual circuits
the calls took. After the technician eliminates all the circuits on the clean
calls and isolates any remaining similar circuits on the affected calls, he or
she will be more than halfway through troubleshooting your problem.
Managing Your Trouble Tickets
Many carriers are efficient, but the reality is that you are one of the tens, hun-
dreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of customers the carrier has. It’s
common to have a 2,000-to-1 ratio of customers to customer service reps at a
carrier. If you have dedicated circuits and bill several thousand dollars a
month, you might receive some added support, but the ratio is rarely much
better for big-time customers than it is for individuals or small businesses.
With this information in mind, you can easily understand that your trouble
tickets will get quicker resolution if you manage them yourself. 
The format you use to manage your trouble tickets can be as complex and
structured as you want. You can build a large relational database that tracks
trouble tickets by carrier, issue type, start date, mean time to repair, and res-
olution, or you can go for something less structured. The least-technical way
to manage your trouble tickets is to simply write down your call example and
all the information you need to open the ticket on a piece of paper, and
update it with times you called in and the status you were given. This infor-
mation allows you to track how long the ticket has been open, and to track its
progress. Of course, you might want to type this information and save it elec-
tronically just in case it gets thrown away with the other scraps on your desk.
If telecom isn’t your main job, you might only open one trouble ticket a year,
but if you expect to open one trouble ticket every month or week, consider
creating your own trouble ticket form. In fact, I have included a really cool
trouble ticket form in the Cheat Sheet of this book to get you started.
Understanding the timelines
Carriers have their own standard timelines for responding to issues, based
on the severity of the issue. If you have one phone number in Minnesota that
you can’t get through to, the carrier’s internal policy may be to provide you
229
Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

with a callback on the status of the issue within four hours. If the DS-3 circuit
is down and you have no phone service, the standard time for a callback
might be two hours. 
Carriers typically won’t give you an escalation until they have failed to
respond to you in the standard interval, although local carriers are much
stricter on these timelines than long-distance carriers.
That doesn’t mean that your carrier will solve your problem in two to four
hours; it simply means that you will receive a callback from a technician in
that amount of time. I do recommend escalating trouble tickets if they don’t
experience any progress. If you have additional information about a problem,
you can always call back into your carrier and update the ticket with the new
call example or results of a test. This is a very good way to ask for updates
without sounding pushy. 
Coping with large outages
There isn’t a network in North America that has not had a substantial outage.
The source might be a fiber cut, a computer virus, or simply the growing pains
of integrating a new technology like VoIP into their POPs. (By the way, a fiber
cut is exactly what it sounds like — a cut cable causes a catastrophic loss of
phone service.) When these problems hit, they are big, fast, and will generally
take at least five hours to fix. Software issues that clog a carrier’s internal net-
work can take anywhere from one hour to five days to completely fix and are
difficult to pin down. The mercurial nature of software issues makes any esti-
mated time to repair dodgy, at best. Your best bet in these scenarios is simply
to call in every hour or so for updates. The story can and will change as it goes
along, and you will at least be informed about the progress.
230
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 
A day in the life of a fiber cut
Fiber cuts are more tangible than other issues, so
carriers can typically provide realistic timelines
for repair. The greatest anxiety is waiting for the
technicians to be dispatched and find the cut. If
the cut occurred close to a large town, the tech-
nicians might be on site in 30 minutes. If it was in
a rural area, it might take three hours. After tech-
nicians are on site, your carrier should be able to
give you an estimate on the time to repair. For a
simple fiber cut, the technicians have to trace the
cables back from the split and dig down to find an
undamaged section of the fiber to splice on a new
section of cable. When one side is connected to
the new cable, the technicians then have to dig
another trench on the other side of the cut to
expose the fiber and then begin splicing the new
section of cable onto it. If you estimate one or two
hours per side to dig each trench and splice the
new cable, you should be in the right ballpark.
Now, if there are extenuating circumstances and
the fiber cut is the result of flooding that eroded a
hillside, which exposed and shredded a mile-long
section of fiber, you can expect a much greater
time for repair. 

Troubleshooting International Calls
From your perspective, troubleshooting an international call is just like 
troubleshooting a domestic call. You can run through the switched outbound
troubleshooting steps in Chapter 12 and isolate the issue just as if you were
calling Newark, New Jersey. The only twist to troubleshooting international
calls is that you might find some interesting similarities when you try 
your call over other carriers. 
The reason for call treatment similarities is because your long-distance car-
rier doesn’t use its own network to complete calls to every country in the
world. I can guarantee you that MCI, Sprint, and AT&T don’t own all the
cables, hardware, and have a staff of technicians around the world to connect
your calls into Senegal, Papua New Guinea, and India. Your long-distance
provider uses an underlying carrier, a company specifically designed for deliv-
ering international calls from the U.S. to a specific country or region in the
world. The interesting thing is that there are only so many underlying carri-
ers that provide service into each country, and every large domestic long-
distance carrier probably has a contract for service with every large under-
lying carrier. In other words, more than one long-distance carrier is using 
the same path to complete calls to Gifu, Japan, or Prague, Czech Republic.
Carriers monitor their completion rates daily to every country in the world. If
you try hard enough, your long-distance carrier might even send you the list
of what they consider acceptable completion rates. Don’t be shocked if you
see that a completion rate of 60 percent to Western Europe is acceptable; the
rate drops to around 7 percent or less for some African countries.
Your long-distance carrier can route your international calls over several
underlying carriers. The choice of underlying carrier depends on the underly-
ing carrier’s completion ratios compared with all the other carrier choices at
that time, as well as the price you are paying for your international calls.
Some carriers have a premium group of underlying carriers available for
international calls, but they can’t place you on that group of carriers because
they would lose money. If your business is focused on international calling,
you might be better served by paying a few pennies more per minute for your
calls, if you can realize a better call quality or completion rate. If you are
opening more than one trouble ticket every few months on international
issues, speak to your carrier about a better route.
Resolving International Fax Issues
International calls are prone to having quality and completion issues. You
might have to wait 45 seconds before you hear the phone ring on the far end.
When someone picks up the call, you might hear static, echo, or low volume on
231
Chapter 11: Maintaining Your Telecom Services

the call, making it difficult to hear what the other person is saying. You can still
have a conversation, but it becomes a bit more challenging than you might
want. It’s not fun.
If a fax machine experiences any of these issues, the fax will probably fail. Any
issue that prevents the clean transmission of data in a timely manner typically
kills a fax transmission.
There are four main reasons international faxes fail, and unfortunately, there
isn’t a lot you can do to change them. They are:
 Antiquated network in the destination country: If you are trying to fax
to a company in rural China or a small village in Africa, for example, the
network might be old, outdated, and inherently prone to dropping calls.
The company might be maxing out its bandwidth, and without enough
bandwidth to allow the fax machines to synch up after the call connects,
your fax will fail. Solution: Make multiple attempts at a lower baud rate
in order to complete your fax. 
 Receiving fax can’t increase baud rate fast enough: If your fax is trans-
mitting at 64 kbps, and the receiving fax is 20 years old and has a maxi-
mum throughput of 1200 baud, there might not been enough time for your
fax machine to slow down and the remote fax to speed up before your fax
machine loses synch and drops the call. Solution: Your best bet is to
lower the speed of your fax machine and keep trying the call. Eventually,
it should complete.
 Fax machines time out before connection: Every fax machine has a timer
on it that disconnects a call if it’s not answered. The factory default on
this timer is about 30 seconds, and for domestic calls, that is acceptable.
The problem is that international calls take more time to set up. There can
be a 30- to 45-second PDD on an international call. If the fax machine you
are dialing to picks up on the second ring, it might be a full minute before
your fax machine receives a connection. Solution: The easiest fix is to
simply set the wait for connect timer on your fax machine to 2 minutes,
or at least to 90 seconds.
 Carrier compression techniques on international calls: Some underly-
ing carriers work so hard to maximize their profits that they squeeze
every call going over their network to tenuous levels. This isn’t much
of a problem on voice calls, but fax machines need enough bandwidth
to allow them to synch up after the call connects. If there is too much
latency on the call, the fax machines won’t synch up and the call will
fail. Solution: There might be nothing you can do to resolve this problem,
except to open up trouble tickets and push your carrier to move the
traffic to another underlying carrier.

horoughly troubleshooting any problem before you call your carrier or
hardware vendor greatly reduces the time repairing issues takes. You
might already have a general indication as to the source of the problem by
simply comparing the types of calls affected, but the tests in this chapter
allow you to pinpoint the source of the problem. 
The tests in this chapter are the same ones your carrier uses, or asks you to
try, when you call to open a trouble ticket. Your carrier can quickly bring the
troubleshooting process to greater focus when you have already eliminated
most of the variables and isolated the source of the problem. This chapter
covers switched troubleshooting on both outbound and inbound toll-free
calls. You will probably refer to this chapter several times a year, so keep a
bookmark here.
If the problem affects different types of calls, it’s always best to open your
trouble ticket as a switched outbound call. A single problem in the switched
network affects all calls that pass through the affected switch or area of your
carrier’s network, including toll-free calls and calls that originate or terminate

on your dedicated circuit. By opening the ticket as anything but a switched
outbound issue, you can delay the repair process by temporarily diverting
your network’s attention to your circuit or your toll-free number.
Troubleshooting an outbound call doesn’t require many steps, but each step
is very important. After you become comfortable with the entire troubleshoot-
ing process, from comparing the call types to using the tests to isolate or
bypass the individual variables, you can identify problems in a few seconds. 
Doing Background Work Before
You Begin Troubleshooting
The key to good troubleshooting is being systematic. That means you have to
do some preliminary work and get yourself organized before jumping in and
making a bunch of random test calls. Read the following instructions for more
information about what to do before you begin troubleshooting.
Determining whether the problem 
is a provisioning issue
Before you start testing calls, begin troubleshooting the issue by asking your-
self whether the feature or problem area ever worked. If so, when did it
change and why? These are important questions because the process you
follow for fixing provisioning issues is different than the process for trou-
bleshooting trouble issues. Your carrier’s order entry (or provisioning)
department handles provisioning issues, whereas the trouble repair people
work on a service after it’s installed. 
If you have problems with a service that never worked, it’s worth your while to
place a 60-second call to the provisioning team at your carrier to ensure that
your order was completed. After you confirm that the order has been com-
pleted, you can perform the testing in this chapter and call the customer ser-
vice department to open a trouble ticket. Alternatively, if you are in doubt and
don’t want to waste time, you can have the provisioning department research
the issue while you simultaneously report it to the customer service depart-
ment. Simply leave a message for your provisioner and then call customer ser-
vice to open a trouble ticket. This way, you don’t lose any time and you cover
all of your bases.

Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Talking to your staff
If your service has been working fine for over a week before you start having
problems, you can begin the troubleshooting process. Well, sort of. Before
you get started, follow these steps:
1. Take a quick survey of the people in your office to find out who else
experiences the problem.
2. Note the types of calls that seem to be affected the most. 
3. Seek out individuals whose calls were most affected and ask specific
questions:
• Were they inbound local calls? 
• Outbound long-distance? 
• Inbound toll-free calls? 
• Outbound toll-free calls? 
• Did they happen at certain times of day?
By comparing the call types (see Chapter 11 for help), you can get a gen-
eral idea of where the problem resides. 
If the problem is pretty consistent, you will have an easier time troubleshoot-
ing it.
Starting the Troubleshooting Process
Use the sections that follow to easily isolate any issue that isn’t intermittent,
including call-quality issues such as static and echo, as well as call-comple-
tion issues such as recordings or fast busy signals. If your issue is intermit-
tent, you might need to repeat the tests 10 or 20 times before you can
confirm the results.
When you are having a problem on an outbound local call, it can affect all of
your calls because all call types will route into or out of your local carrier. To
troubleshoot this type of problem, skip to Step 5 and then open a trouble
ticket as necessary based on your results.
235
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

Step 1: Redialing the number
If you are having a completion issue (say calls fail to a recording or a fast
busy signal) you may have misdialed. Try calling back, even if you dial the
number all the time and are sure you couldn’t have misdialed. It’s common to
transpose a digit or press an incorrect key. If you confirm that you misdialed,
you can go on about your day. 
If pressing the Redial button on your phone completes your call, you should
be aware of the fact that there might have been an intermittent issue you
stumbled across, or an outage that just cleared up on its own. If the call still
fails or has quality issues when you redial it, move to Step 2.
The key to doing bad troubleshooting is to make assumptions. Even the most
basic assumptions (of course I dialed right!) can lead to wasted time.
If you have call quality issues, write down the information about all of your
call examples (see Chapter 11 for the specifics of what you need) and try the
number again. Call quality issues only affect calls that pass over the affected
circuits or through the affected hardware. If the problem is deep enough into
your carrier’s network, the static or echo may be intermittent; if your call is
sent over a different circuit to reach its destination, you might not have any
problems. If the problem affects all of your calls, proceed to Step 2 to con-
tinue troubleshooting.
If you can’t finish dialing the entire phone number before the call fails, or if
you have a line-quality issue before you finish dialing the phone number, the
problem is either with your hardware or your local carrier. Your call won’t
make it to your long-distance carrier’s network until after the last digit is
dialed and your local carrier identifies it as a long-distance call. If you have
static on the line after you dial three or four digits, but before you finish dial-
ing the phone number, the issue is probably with your local carrier. If you
have a PBX phone system that performs any type of least-cost routing, your
local carrier won’t see the call until after you enter the last digit and your
PBX decides where to route it. In this case, any static or issues that occur
before you finish the dialing sequence are the result of hardware problems
within your phone system. There might be a bad port or line in the phone
system that is causing it. Because the tests indicate it’s your hardware, you
need to dispatch your hardware vendor to fix it. 
Step 2: Validating your 
long-distance carrier
If you think the problem is with your long-distance carrier, you need to con-
firm that your calls are actually going to the carrier. It’s possible that some
236
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

other long-distance carrier accidentally changed your phone line over to its
network, and then blocked your access to its network after realizing the mis-
take. In this case, the reason your long-distance calls aren’t completing is
because your calls aren’t running over the correct network. Of course, that’s
an assumption — you don’t know for sure until you check. You need to test
part of the call that moves from your local carrier to the long-distance carrier
(see Figure 12-1).
The industry standard test for validating your long-distance carrier is called a
700 test. The 700 test got its name because you dial 1-700-555-4141 from your
touch-tone phone (rotary dial phones may not have access to the service). The
700 test is a free local call and is routed by your local carrier to a recording that
identifies your interLATA long-distance carrier. If your long-distance carrier is
AT&T, for example, the recording says, “Thank you for using AT&T.” This test is
almost always accurate, so investigate anything that doesn’t sound correct.
Performing a 700 test now, before you have a problem, can help you avoid
possible confusion in the future. Your phone bill might come from one car-
rier, but if the carrier uses a subsidiary to provide your service, the 700 test
could lead to a confusing message. The number of switchless resellers contin-
ues to increase; additionally, carriers are often bought, sold, and renamed, so
knowing who your carrier is can be a lot more confusing than it seems. For
example, maybe your local carrier doesn’t know that IXC Communications
purchased Cincinnati Bell and is now Broadwing, which is why you don’t hear
the new Broadwing recording that you should hear. If your 700 test lists a car-
rier you don’t recognize, call your long-distance provider for validation. If you
are wondering what a switchless reseller is, I suggest checking out Chapter 1
for a crash course. 
Some competing local exchange carriers (commonly called CLECs), such as
PAETEC and Mpower, might not provide the 700 testing feature, but might
instead send you to an automated voice reciting the phone number you are
dialing from. In this case, the only way to determine where your local carrier
is routing your long-distance calls is by calling your local carrier.

Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

The 700 test only validates the long-distance carrier for an individual phone
line. If you want to check multiple phone lines, you have to test them all manu-
ally, one by one. 
The 700 test only validates the primary interexchange carrier (PIC) your local
carrier has listed for your interLATA long-distance traffic. Some local carriers
offer a 700 test for your intraLATA PIC of 1-700-your area code-4141, but gener-
ally, you can only confirm the long-distance carrier for your interLATA calling.
If you aren’t sure what the difference is between intraLATA and interLATA
calls, please check out Chapter 3 for the specifics.
Step 3: Forcing the call over 
your long-distance carrier
Even if the 700 test claims that your long-distance carrier is set up on your
phone line, you haven’t unequivocally proven that your calls are being routed
to there. Local carriers use many internal tracking databases, and only one
of them handles 700 tests. As I said in the previous section, 700 tests are
usually correct, but a totally different system deeper in the computer switch
(a switch that is always accurate) actually routes all of your long-distance
calls.
Being both persistent and polite, ask the customer service representative
at your local carrier to do a conference call, or simply ask to have a switch
technician validate your long-distance carrier. If the switch identifies the
long-distance carrier as MCI, but the 700 test says your long-distance carrier
is Sprint, the 700 recording is wrong — your calls are transmitted across
the MCI network. The switch is always right, because the switch is the piece
of hardware that actually sends your call to your long-distance carrier.
Figure 12-2 shows that the area tested is still within the realm of the local
carrier (refer to Figure 12-1). The difference is that in this test the focus is
on a section of your local carrier’s network a little farther downstream.
You may have noticed something peculiar about Figures 12-1 and 12-2. The
pictures are exactly the same, it’s true. Both Step 2 and Step 3 involve vali-
dating the routing by your local carrier. However, Step 2 (represented in
Figure 12-1) tests to ensure that the call is being sent to the correct carrier;
the second test (Step 3, represented in Figure 12-2) affects the circuits used
to reach that local carrier. I know, I know, I’m splitting hairs, but the point is
to help you identify that you need to talk to your local carrier in each of these
instances, even though at first blush it looks like you’re dealing with a long-
distance problem. 
238
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

You do have the power to force calls onto your long-distance carrier. All it takes
is the dial-around code for your long-distance carrier and the capability to dial
seven more digits. Every long-distance carrier has a dial-around code, and if
you have any switched phone lines, you should know the one that belongs to
your carrier. When you ask for the code, the carrier gives you a number that
begins with 10-10 (pronounced ten-ten) and ends in three more digits. For exam-
ple, the dial-around code for AT&T is 10-10-288; for MCI, it’s 10-10-222, and for
Sprint it’s 10-10-333. If you want to find out more about dial-around codes, you
can meander over to Chapter 7 and read the section on casual dialing.
Performing the 700 test validates only one part of your local carrier’s net-
work, the section that identifies the carrier to receive your long-distance
calls. The other part of the local carrier’s network that you need to be con-
cerned about is how the local carrier actually routes your calls to your long-
distance carrier after the local carrier’s network determines the correct route
to the correct long-distance carrier. If the circuits making up the route to your
long-distance carrier aren’t functioning correctly, your call fails, even though
the 700 test has correctly identified the long-distance carrier. Forcing a call
over your long-distance network bypasses the first step and can result in
your call taking a different path to your long-distance network.

Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues
How dial-around codes work
A dial-around code tells your local carrier to
immediately route your call onto the long-dis-
tance network associated with that particular
code. Dialing a phone number with one of these
10-10 codes bypasses the local carrier process
that determines whether your call is local or
long distance, and identifies which carrier is
assigned to your phone line for long distance.
Your local carrier simply throws your call to the
network attributed to that dial-around code.
Keep the 10-10 dial-around code for your car-
rier someplace where you can’t lose it. If you
have to print it on an adhesive label and stick it
to the underside of your phone, or on the wall
next to your phone system, do it.

Making a dial-around test call
After you determine the dial-around code for your long-distance carrier, try
your problem call again by dialing the 10-10 code and the phone number. If
your carrier is Sprint and you are having problems dialing someone in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, dial
10-10-333 + 1 + 414+ the phone number
Always dial 1 between the dial-around code for your carrier and the phone
number that is giving you problems. The call won’t work without it.
Some phone systems purposely block your ability to use dial-around codes. If
the call fails before you finish dialing all the digits for the phone number, your
phone system is probably the cause. Either call your hardware vendor and find
out whether you can use a bypass code, or locate a phone line that doesn’t 
go through your phone system and try the 10-10 code from there. Fax and
modem lines are frequently left out of phone systems, so you may be able to
use them for testing. If you do receive a bypass code for your phone system,
it will probably be complex, convoluted, and might require several steps
before you reach a dial tone from your local carrier. 
If the call still fails in Step 3
If the call still fails in the same way it did before, the good news is that your
local carrier is sending the call to your long-distance carrier just as it should.
The bad news is that you still have the problem, so proceed to Step 4.
If Step 3 resolves the problem
If the call doesn’t fail when you dial using the dial-around code for your car-
rier, but it does fail when you call out directly, your local carrier is the most
likely source of the problem. If you have a standard local carrier like Bell
Atlantic or Verizon, you can just dial 611 on your phone and follow the voice
prompts to be directed to the repair department. If you have a competing
local exchange carrier (CLEC) such as Mpower, PAETEC, or US LEC, you have
to find their phone number. If you are having problems finding their phone
number, check out the section about finding and contacting your local carrier
in Chapter 7.
International calls generally have a post dial delay (PDD) of 15 to 30 seconds.
The PDD is the time after you finish dialing the phone number but before you
hear the phone ring on the other side. You can generally reduce the PDD by
as much as 12 seconds by using your carrier’s dial-around code. If you have
international fax problems caused by the PDD, this might solve them. 
240
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Step 4: Dialing over another 
long-distance carrier
If you suspect that you have a long-distance issue, Step 4 enables you to
redeem or condemn the long-distance carrier. Up until this point, you have
simply validated that the call is reaching the correct long-distance network;
now, you can remove your long-distance network from the call entirely and
replace it with another carrier. You accomplish this task the same way you
forced the call onto your long-distance carrier’s network (see Step 3, earlier
in this chapter); this time, however, you use the dial-around code of another
long-distance carrier. The section of a call isolated by this step is shown in
Figure 12-3.

Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues
Keeping your local carrier from passing the buck
When you tell your local carrier that you have
problems dialing a long-distance number, the
customer service rep will quickly try to end the
conversation and direct you to your long-dis-
tance provider. Typically, the local carrier’s rep
is right to direct you to the long-distance carrier. 
You can easily clarify the situation by telling the
person that you dialed the number with the dial-
around code and it completed, but that when
you dial it without the code, the call fails. The
customer service rep will then know that you
have tested the issue and you know what you
are talking about. As long as you continue to
press this point, the rep will open a ticket for you
and repair the issue. If you want to really
impress the rep, tell him or her you completed a
700 test before you used the dial-around code.

You can choose among the following carriers:
 10-10-288: AT&T
 10-10-222: MCI
 10-10-333: Sprint
If you want to validate your carrier by sending your call over another net-
work, try your calls over the strongest networks you can find. Sprint and
AT&T have outstanding networks, as does MCI. If your call fails over Sprint,
make two more test calls (one using MCI and the other using AT&T), just to
confirm the local carrier that owns the phone number you are dialing is actu-
ally the problem and not your long-distance carrier’s network.
Making a dial-around test call with a different carrier
If you’re a Sprint user and you want to test a number in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, to determine whether the call might work on the AT&T network
(thereby proving that Sprint carrier is the source of your problem), dial
10-10-288+ 1 + 414 + the phone number
If the call completes when you are trying it over one of these carriers, be
aware of the fact that unless you are set up for casual dialing over this long-
distance carrier’s network, you might be charged $0.55 per minute, with a
$3.75 connection fee, or more. By all means, make that call if it’s important;
just make it quick.
If the call still fails in Step 4
If you try to use one or more other long-distance carriers and the calls still
fail, I can guarantee you that your long-distance carrier isn’t the problem. You
still have three other areas left to troubleshoot, and Step 5 can possibly elimi-
nate two of them.
242
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 
Using 10-10 codes for international issues
There is strange magic in the world of telecom
that doesn’t make much sense to the logically
minded. You use the dial-around code to reach
the same entrance point into your long-distance
carrier that your local carrier uses. For some
reason, using the dial-around code seems to
speed the connection of international calls. 

If Step 4 allows you to complete your call
Completing your call over another long-distance carrier confirms that the
source of the failure is within your long-distance network. Call your carrier
and list all the tests you have tried, and their results. The representative you
talk to might have to follow a troubleshooting script with prompts to ask for
some of this information, but be sure to report your specific test information:
 The results of your 700 test
 The results of dialing out, using the 10-10 dial-around code
 The date, time, origination number, termination number, and call treat-
ment of your failed call, as well as the call you made with the 10-10 dial-
around code
 The name of the carrier whose network you used to complete the call
Take notes, and be sure to write down the trouble ticket number and contact
name and extension for the person you talk to. Follow up with the carrier
every two hours to see how the situation is coming along.
Using Step 4 for international issues
Dialing out over another carrier is very helpful in troubleshooting international
issues. If you can tell your carrier’s rep that the call is completing over AT&T
and Sprint, he or she won’t worry that the problem originates in a foreign
country. 
Some long-distance carriers have triggers in their networks to prevent fraud;
frequently, those triggers involve international calls. I have never encoun-
tered a fraud block dialing out over Sprint, MCI, or AT&T, but if you use
Qwest (its dial-around code is 10-10-432) to make an international test call,
your call will probably be blocked from the Qwest network. The only way to
remove the fraud block is to open an account with Qwest and sign up the
specific phone number that is blocked. That’s a lot of work just to do a trou-
bleshooting test that your long-distance carrier will probably do anyway. 
The long-distance carrier whose 10-10 code you use will charge you quite a
bit of money for completed calls. If you have to make an international call
over another carrier, keep it short, or expect to pay the consequences. 
Step 5: Dialing from another local carrier
The tests in the previous sections validate some of the handoff between your
local and long-distance carrier, as well as the entire path of the call through
your long-distance network. Although a handful of potential issues remain, only
two of them are issues that you can take control of: they are your hardware and
243
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

your local carrier. Unless you have been using the bypass code for your hard-
ware to make the 10-10 calls, or you don’t have a phone system, your local
carrier is still a possible source of the failure. By using a different local carrier,
you can confirm or disprove whether your local carrier is routing your calls
correctly. Figure 12-4 identifies the section of the call we are isolating during
Step 5 of testing.
Making the test call over another local carrier
You can make this test as complex or a simple as you want. If you want to make
it difficult, ask someone in another state to make the test call for you. If you
want to make it easy, just grab a cellphone and dial the phone number you
want to test. Technically, wireless providers are competing local exchange car-
riers (CLECs) and provide the same service as your local carrier. Unless you
somehow have the same local carrier for your cellphone and your land lines,
this test gives you a lot of information.
If Step 5 allows you to complete your call
If the call completes from your cellphone, your local carrier or your phone
system is the cause of the problem. If you don’t have a phone system, or if
you were bypassing all the routing within it for your test calls, the issue is
probably with your local carrier. Even if you haven’t bypassed your phone
system and you haven’t ruled it out as a source for the problem, open a trou-
ble ticket with your local carrier anyway, providing the following information:
 The results of your 700 test
 The results of your dial-around tests, using your carrier’s code, and
using the codes of other networks
 The time of your failed calls, the origination phone number, termination
phone number, and call treatment
 The fact that you can complete the call from a telephone outside your
phone system

Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

If your local carrier doesn’t find any problems on your phone line, can access
a dial tone from its central office switch, and can complete a call, the problem
lies with your phone system. It’s time to call your hardware vendor.
Keep the trouble ticket open with your local carrier so that when your 
hardware vendor arrives, he or she can conduct a head-to-head test with the
carrier. In a head-to-head test, the hardware vendor can make test calls, and
your local carrier can watch each digit come across the network as the tech-
nician dials them. Between these two people, your problem will be fixed.
If your call still fails in Step 5
If you have the same failure when you dial from a different local carrier, you
know that nothing from your phone to the end of your long-distance network
is causing the problem. In this case, there are only two potential trouble areas
left: the local carrier that provides a dial tone to the phone number you are
dialing and the phone system that receives your call. If you know that the
person you are calling doesn’t have a phone system like a PBX or Key system
handling their calls and providing features like voicemail (he or she uses plain
old telephone service), the problem is most likely with his or her local carrier.
If you aren’t sure what constitutes a phone system, you can find out more in
Chapter 2. Consider any phone system other than a single-line phone plugged
into the wall (or two tin cans connected by a piece of twine) as a phone
system.
This is when you have to decide exactly how much you want to make this
call. If it’s not that important, try calling back in two or three days. The local
carrier on the other end will eventually identify and repair the problem.
Getting Switched Toll-Free
Troubleshooting Basics
Toll-free troubleshooting is slightly more complex than standard outbound
troubleshooting because handling of toll-free numbers can vary by state, LATA,
area code, or by area code and the next three digits in the phone number.
There are also the dual concerns of who the RespOrg is and who carries the
traffic. Finally, problems with toll-free numbers might not initiate from the toll-
free number at all, but can be a problem with the regular phone number it rings
into, or just a systemic network issue affecting all calls that run through the
point of failure.
245
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

Before you begin troubleshooting your toll-free number, it’s important to vali-
date the toll-free number’s basic information.
 The toll-free number or feature: Has it been working in the past? If you
are in the process of moving your toll-free number from one carrier to
another, or adding a new service, you can have any number of provision-
ing problems that prevent the service from being activated. Provisioning
issues are handled by your carrier’s order-entry department; see
Chapter 9.
 The ring-to number: If you ordered the toll-free number to ring to your
fax machine rather than the main phone line for your customer service
department, that might be why everyone who calls receives an unpleas-
ant squeal in the ear. Check the phone number to which the toll-free
number points. If your order is wrong, possibly that is the source of the
problem. If nothing else, you need to know the ring-to number of your
toll-free number for the testing process.
 The area of coverage: If you ordered only U.S. 48 states coverage and
calls are from Alaska and Hawaii fail, the source of your problem lies
with the fact that you didn’t request access from those areas. Coverage
on toll-free numbers can be delivered in many different levels, and your
available options are dependent on what your carrier provides. Some
carriers offer many options that include or exclude Canada, Alaska,
Hawaii, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and/or Puerto Rico, whereas other car-
riers give access to all these options by default. 
You can troubleshoot any issues, either quality- or completion-related, with
the steps in the following sections. If you have quality issues, you need to
gather as many call examples as possible, both affected calls and clean calls,
so that your carrier can isolate the issue (see “Talking to your staff,” earlier in
this chapter). Completion issues are much easier to find, because they have a
definite failure point that technicians can duplicate and find.
Step 1: Dialing the number yourself
When a customer calls in to your direct phone number to report that your
toll-free number is failing, first make sure you find out the following informa-
tion from your customer before you hang up the phone:
 The phone number and location from which your customer is calling
 What time the customer’s call failed
 The call treatment
246
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Then try to dial the number yourself. It’s more common for a toll-free number
to fail from all locations than from only a specific geographic area, such as a
LATA or a state. If your call fails when you dial the toll-free number, all
inbound calls are probably failing, regardless of the location of the caller.
If your call to your toll-free number completes, there is always the possibility
that the problem is restricted to the area your customer is calling from,
which is why you need to know the phone number and location of the caller.
You can ask the customer to help you troubleshoot the number, or you can
call your toll-free carrier to open a trouble ticket.
You should also ask your customer to place you on hold so you can try to call
the toll-free number again. The customer could have dialed the number incor-
rectly. If the customer can complete the call, there’s a very strong chance that
he or she simply misdialed the number the first time. If the call fails again,
there’s an equally strong chance that the problem is of a geographical nature.
Until you receive additional reports of problems from your customers, or you
get feedback from your carrier, you won’t know how large the affected area is. 
Write down all of your call examples and call your carrier. When you open
your trouble ticket, be sure to write down the date and time, as well as the
customer service rep’s name. After the ticket is open, follow up on it every
two to four hours until the issue is resolved.
If the call fails when you dial your own toll-free number, the outage might be
affecting everyone calling, but at least you have the ability to troubleshoot
the issue. In this case, clear off a page in your notebook for test calls and pro-
ceed to Step 2.
Always try to find someone in an affected area to retest to your toll-free
number. Long-standing customers or vendors will generally be more than
happy to spend five minutes making test calls. If your toll-free number always
completes when you call it, you don’t assume the issue is fixed until you
receive a call from the area that was previously blocked. 
Step 2: Dialing the ring-to number locally
Calling the ring-to number directly can identify whether the problem is within
the toll-free routing portion of the call or is caused by local carrier problems
reaching your regular phone line. Figure 12-5 shows the area of your local car-
rier’s network that we are validating in this step.
If you are calling from the same office that receives the toll-free number, you
place a local call to validate the ring-to number. Local calls pass through your
phone system and your local carrier, so if you can complete this call, you
know these two portions of the system are working. 
247
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

If the local call to the ring-to number fails in Step 2
If your local call fails, the issue has little to do with the toll-free number. You
can’t complete a toll-free call if your local carrier can’t complete their portion
of the inbound call. You can’t be positive at this time whether the problem is 
 Caused by your local carrier being unable to route calls to your office
 Within your phone system
If you don’t have a phone system, the only possible source of the issue is
your local carrier. 
In this case, collect all the information about your inbound local call exam-
ples, and dial 611 to reach your local carrier to open a trouble ticket. Write
down the trouble ticket number, whom you spoke with, the time and date,
and then you should follow up periodically until the problem is resolved.
Don’t mention anything about your toll-free number to your local carrier when
you open your trouble ticket. If you try to explain that you have a toll-free
number that isn’t working and that you have been troubleshooting it, the local
carrier will identify the number’s RespOrg and direct you to call your long-
distance carrier. Instead, open the trouble ticket on a call example that shows
that you can’t receive a local inbound call. That way, the carrier knows the
issue exists within its own network. As long as your local carrier isn’t confused
by stories of toll-free numbers, the issue will repaired in short order.
If your call completes in Step 2
If your call fails when you dial the toll-free number and completes when you
dial the ring-to number, you can rest assured that neither your phone system
nor your local carrier are the source of the problem. In order to resolve the
problem, move on to Step 3.

Step 3: Dialing the ring-to number through
your long-distance carrier
Your next step is to determine whether the issue is legitimately in the toll-free
handling of the call, or if it’s simply a larger network issue within your long-
distance carrier. In order to truly validate how your long-distance carrier is
sending calls to your phone number, you need to have a call placed over the
long-distance carrier’s network to your ring-to number. The specific area of
the call you’re focusing on in Step 3 is shown in Figure 12-6.
If your local carrier provides your toll-free number, the carrier has a comple-
mentary carrier that provides the long-distance service. In this case, you
need to know the 10-10 dial-around code for your long-distance carrier so you
can make the test call. 
Test calling the ring-to number on your long-distance carrier’s network
Even though calling from one line in your office to another line in the same
office is a local call, you can force the call to be routed over your long-distance
carrier and back in through your local carrier. If you preface your call with
the 10-10 dial-around code of your long-distance carrier, the call will be sent
from your local carrier to your long-distance carrier, and then forwarded
back to your local carrier to ring to your office. It’s a short loop, but even a
short loop can indicate the general health of your long-distance network. If
your long-distance carrier is Sprint, dial your phone number like this:
10-10-333 + 1 + area code + your phone number
Use 10-10-288 if your carrier is AT&T; use 10-10-222 is your carrier is MCI.

Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

If the test call completes in Step 3
If your call to the ring-to number, using your long-distance carrier, completes
without any problem, you have validated that at least a portion of the
switched network is working. Carriers commonly route toll-free calls differ-
ently than direct-dial calls. Regardless, you must accomplish your next level
of research with the help of the customer service reps at your long-distance
carrier, so skip the next test and jump to Step 5.
If the test call in Step 3 fails 
If your call to the ring-to number over your long-distance carrier fails, you
might have an issue with your long-distance carrier’s switched network. The
good news is that your toll-free number isn’t the source of the problem. The
bad news is that your long-distance carrier hasn’t updated the latest LERG
database and is routing your calls to the incorrect central office (CO) of your
local carrier (if you are having call completion issues) or the carrier is send-
ing the call over a defective route path (if you have quality issues). What you
need to determine next is whether any long-distance carrier can complete a
phone call to you. To find out, move on to Step 4.
Step 4: Dialing the ring-to number over
another carrier
So far, if you’ve been following all the preceding steps, you have isolated the
problem with your toll-free number to the path your call is taking through your
long-distance carrier to your ring-to number. If your local carrier is servicing
250
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 
Understanding inbound routing
The most important piece of information in the
world of telecom isn’t the physical location of
the phone, but the physical location of the cen-
tral office that provides your dial tone from the
local carrier. Every call you receive is sent to
that central office and forwarded to you.
Periodically, your local carrier might decide that
it has too many calls running through one cen-
tral office, so it moves a group of phone num-
bers to a different central office in the area. The
local carrier then updates the national Local
Exchange Routing Guide, or LERG database
(which I explain in Chapter 3) to inform every
telecom company about the change. However,
if your long-distance carrier is slow to imple-
ment the change, it might continue to send calls
to the old central office, causing them to fail.
If your carrier is handling your toll-free calls,
those calls will also fail. The repair can take as
little as 15 minutes if your carrier can identify the
issue, or it can drag on for days. If you are aware
of any changes your local carrier has made to
your service, you should let your carrier know,
because it can reduce your repair time.

your phone number out of a different central office, it’s possible that only your
local carrier knows where to find you. Figure 12-7 shows the area of a toll-free
call you are isolating by performing the test in Step 4.
Use a different long-distance carrier to validate the inbound route path. That
is, if you use Sprint, use the dial-around number for AT&T. In this case, the
test call would look like this:
10-10-288 + 1 + area code + your number
If the call completes, AT&T charges you for the call, at any per-minute rate it
chooses. If the call doesn’t connect, you won’t be charged for the call. If your
test call completes, keep the conversation short to prevent being shocked
when your invoice arrives.
If the call in Step 4 fails
Try a few other long-distance carriers, such as MCI (10-10-222) and Qwest
(10-10-432). If these calls fail, as well, your local carrier has hidden the
inbound path to your phone from all long-distance carriers. In this case, take
all the call examples for the multiple carriers you have tried and dial 611 to
open a trouble ticket with your local carrier. Just as with all trouble tickets,
you need to write down the trouble ticket number on the paper alongside
your call examples and follow up every few hours.
If the call in Step 4 completes
If the test call to your ring-to number completes over another carrier, your
testing is over. This test only changes the long-distance carrier used, and
every other variable remains the same. Because the results changed when you
changed the long-distance carrier, the problem has to be with that carrier. 
When speaking to your carrier, open your trouble ticket as an outbound call
issue and don’t mention your toll-free number if you can avoid it. Instead of
telling the carrier that someone unsuccessfully tried to dial in on your toll-
free number, tell the carrier that someone with the same long-distance carrier

Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

tried to call you and they failed, so you did a test call that failed. If you begin
talking about your toll-free number, the carrier might open the trouble ticket
on the toll-free number instead, which will delay everything.
When you open the trouble ticket, be sure to tell the technician that you
forced the call from your office to the other phone number in your office by
dialing the 10-10 dial-around code. Then, as usual, write down the trouble
ticket number, the name of the person you spoke with, and the time you
called; also make note of any additional testing that was attempted and
changes made to the toll-free number or the network. Then set up a schedule
to call back every few hours for updates.
Step 5: Validating the ring-to number
and RespOrg
If you end up at this step, you have eliminated all the other steps that can
possibly be causing this problem, except for the processes and mechanisms
that make toll-free routing unique to outbound calling. You should also log
some failed call examples to your toll-free number and some completed call
examples to your ring-to number. 
After you reach a customer service representative, you need to validate two
more pieces of information before you open a trouble ticket:
 Confirm the ring-to number. This number might have been updated or
input incorrectly. If your area code is 206 and the ring-to number is going
to area code 602, you have found your problem. In about 15 minutes,
your carrier can point your toll-free number where it needs to go and it
will be working fine.
 Confirm the RespOrg. It’s uncommon for a working number to suddenly
be moved from one long-distance carrier to another, but it does happen. If
your toll-free number somehow migrated to another carrier by accident,
someone at the new carrier might have later realized it didn’t belong to
that carrier and blocked it. If the RespOrg isn’t your carrier, you have
to begin the process to move it back. Please take two aspirin and go to the
section in Chapter 9 about activation issues. Unfortunately, your problem
is considered a provisioning issue and not a trouble reporting issue. This
means that carriers deal with it with less urgency; the timeline to repair
can be 7 to 10 days, as opposed to 15 minutes to 3 hours. 
This is the one time when screaming might pay off, as long as you are scream-
ing at people who can actually help you, and that they are people you will
never speak to again. I am mainly talking about the conversation you will have
with the carrier that somehow is now in RespOrg control of your toll-free
252
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

number. If you add emotional urgency to your discussion with the representa-
tive you speak to, he or she might not hide behind the normal 7- to 10-day time
frame for migrations. Before you have this emotionally charged conversation,
however, chat with your carrier first to make sure it wasn’t the carrier’s fault
for letting go of the number. Also, at this time, you might choose to NASC your
toll-free number back if the carriers involved are moving slower than you
require (see Chapter 9).
If the ring-to number and the RespOrg match up fine, proceed with the trou-
ble ticket. Make note of the trouble ticket number, the person you spoke with,
the time and date you chatted (in case the problem takes more than one day
to repair), and some brief notes that you have checked RespOrg, and the
ring-to-number. Then, set your alarm clock to ring every two or three hours
so that you can follow up and keep the ticket moving forward.
Troubleshooting Toll-Free Issues from
Canada, Alaska, and Hawaii
Troubleshooting toll-free issues is difficult enough, but it gets even worse
when the problematic calls are unique to areas outside of the lower 48 U.S.
states. Your first order of business is to confirm that the toll-free number
covers the areas in question. When your business was started, maybe
Canada or Hawaii weren’t part of your target market. As your company
grows, you find a demographic in one of these areas that is a perfect fit with
your company’s business plan. Contact your long-distance carrier to validate
the area of coverage on your toll-free numbers and open up the coverage to
the area as soon as you identify the need.
The process of adding coverage to your toll-free service takes as long as
three to five days, so it is best to deal with it immediately, before you have a
squad of executives at a hotel in Victoria, British Columbia, wondering why
they can’t call back into the office. If the execs are on a short business trip,
you might get the toll-free numbers working from Canada — just about the
time they land on their flight home.
This advice may seem simple, but don’t assume that your service coverage
includes calls outside the continental U.S. If you first confirm that your toll-
free numbers have been set up for calls from these outlying areas, you can
make things happen much quicker. 
To simplify the troubleshooting examples here, I use the scenario that one of
your toll-free numbers isn’t accepting calls from Canada. The troubleshooting
scenario is roughly the same for any of the other areas, including Alaska,
Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.
253
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

Getting a sample troubleshooting
scenario for outlying areas
Maybe your toll-free number was working before, or maybe it was set up to
receive calls from Canada a while ago but you never verified this access.
Whatever the issue, calls from Canada are not reaching your toll-free number.
Almost all the issues concerning outlying areas have the same profile, regard-
less of location:
 The toll-free number being dialed is supposed to be open for calls from
the area.
 The toll-free number works from everywhere in the lower 48 states.
 When calling the toll-free number from Canada, callers hear a recording
such as, “The number you have dialed is unavailable from your calling
area.”
 The person having the problem with the number is unavailable for
retesting.
 You have limited or no information about the dates, times, and phone
numbers of the calls that are failing from Canada. Your executives at
the trade show don’t care about the details; they just want the darn
thing fixed.
If you look at the situation from a troubleshooting standpoint, it might seem
like you’re in a hopeless situation. You have an irritable person in a remote
location on a tight timeline who can’t give you any details about the failed
call and who is essentially unavailable for scheduling any future testing. On
top of that, the person is probably in a position of power at the company and
your life may be affected in a direct (and negative) manner if you can’t fix the
problem. Your carrier wants specific call examples and call treatments, and
has questions in need of answers. After your customer service representative
realizes that you have none of this information, that will be the end of the
conversation.
Most long-distance carriers don’t directly handle coverage on their toll-free
numbers from outlying areas such as Alaska, Canada, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico. As a general rule, they use an underlying carrier who has
already made all the connections in those areas. This means that there are
two systems that need to be in synch: Your carrier must list the toll-free
number as having access from the outlying area, and the underlying carrier
for that outlying area must have your toll-free number listed for coverage in
the area and on the account for your long-distance carrier. If the underlying
carrier in Canada doesn’t have your number listed for service with your long-
distance carrier, calls to your toll-free number will fail in Canada and never
reach your carrier. 
254
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Fabricating a call example
What I am about to propose is top secret. The likelihood that there is one area
in Canada where the underlying carrier isn’t processing your toll-free calls is
quite slim. It’s much more common for the underlying carrier in Canada to
somehow drop your number from its records and now calls aren’t being sent
from anywhere in Canada to your long-distance carrier in the U.S. Fixing this
specific problem takes a few hours. Your carrier simply needs to send an
order to the underlying carrier in Canada to place the number back online. 
After the underlying carrier updates its system, the situation is resolved. The
only problem with this scenario is that if you try to ask someone in the order
entry department at your long-distance carrier to resend the order for Canada
coverage back to their underlying carrier, the carrier rep will see that it’s
already set up for Canada coverage. The rep might be unable, or unwilling, to
order service that already appears to be in place. In the eyes of the rep, the job
is done. At this point, the rep refers you to speak to a customer service agent
to open a trouble ticket. This is not what you need! In order to have your car-
rier do what needs to be done, you first need to fabricate a call example.
Don’t fabricate call examples under any other circumstances, because doing
so will only frustrate you and your carrier, delaying the repair of your prob-
lem! The only reason this strategy is acceptable is because:
 The carrier needs to get its records up to date. If you suspect the
underlying carrier simply has to update its records to bring the toll-free
number on to the account for your long-distance carrier, fabricate away.
 You can’t get a call example any other way. If the underlying carrier isn’t
routing the calls to your long-distance carrier, your long-distance carrier
won’t find a valid call example. If the call is stopped before it reaches your
long-distance carrier’s network, they have no way to trace it, which is the
conclusion you are leading them to by making up a fake call example.
 It’s standard procedure for most long-distance carriers to resend the
order for coverage to the underlying carrier in this instance. If there is
a trouble ticket on a toll-free number that can’t complete from an outly-
ing area, and the carrier can’t find the call example, the technicians will
suspect the underlying carrier.
If you’re ready to call your long-distance carrier and give the person you speak
with a falsified call example, you need to make the fake calls sound as legiti-
mate as possible. Your fictitious call example should look something like this:
 Say that the time of call is about 90 minutes ago. Give a distinct time,
like 11:27 a.m. or 1:35 p.m. The more precise you are, the more likely the
call example will go through unquestioned. 
255
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Switched Network Issues

 Say that the call treatment is “The number you are dialing is unavail-
able from your calling area.” Choose this recorded message to lead
the technician to the conclusion that the order to the underlying carrier
needs to be resent. Any other call treatment you give will focus attention
elsewhere.
 Use a plausible origination phone number. Whether you make up the
number or use one that is frequently dialed, this is the most crucial part
of your fictitious call example. Your carrier is going to search for calls
from that phone number, so if you give a completely bogus phone
number, you will hear back two hours later that your origination number
is invalid, and you will have lost time. You must have a legitimate origi-
nation phone number.
If you don’t have any reference number in Canada to use as an origina-
tion number, you need to find one. The easiest way to pull up a valid
phone number in Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, or any outlying area, is to
search the Internet. If you know the person is in Alberta, Canada, and
can’t reach your toll-free number, just search the Web for alberta canada
museums or alberta canada university. Eventually, you will find a home
page that displays a local number for either the museum gift shop or the
student housing coordinator of the university. It doesn’t matter who the
number belongs to, as long as it’s a valid number. 
After you have the phone number, write it in your call example, and dial your
long-distance carrier. If you want to add some spice to the story, you can
always tell the carrier that your CEO is the one who dialed from this number.
Say, “If you could move this along, I may be able to keep my job for a little
longer.”
In a few hours, your customer service technician calls back to tell you that he
or she couldn’t find your call example, but that the order has been resent to
the underlying carrier. In an hour or so after that, you can retest the toll-free
number from Canada.
At this time, you need to ask the executive in Alberta to try the call again. If it
fails again, tell the executive you need the origination phone number, the
time of the call, and the exact recording or call treatment. In the vast majority
of the cases, the fake call example solves this type of problem. If it doesn’t,
you need to gather legitimate information and push forward. As long as you
take good notes, follow up on the ticket, and have someone who can work
with you to make test calls in the affected area, there is no problem that can’t
be resolved.
256
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Troubleshooting International 
Toll-Free Issues
Every country has its own version of toll-free numbers. Many countries use
0800, whereas others use a variant of it that uses one 8, along with the coun-
try’s prefix. Some countries have a unique prefix; Japan uses 00531-12 as its
area code, for example. The prefix might also change, based upon the local
carrier or geographic region from which the call is being dialed. For example,
calling a toll-free number from Northern China requires you to dial 10-800-120
+ the local phone number, but if you dial from Southern China, you need to
dial the number as 10-800-712-XXXX. International toll-free numbers are
unique creatures in the world of telecom with a double layer of toll-free num-
bers built within them, as shown in Figure 12-8.
International toll-free service (ITFS) is actually made up of two toll-free num-
bers. The first number is the toll-free number in the foreign country. This is
the number that you dial in England, Tanzania, or some other country that is
recognized by their national phone system as being toll free. The second toll-
free number is here in the U.S. Its job is to receive calls from the foreign coun-
try and route them to your phone line here in America. The differences in
troubleshooting an international toll-free number when compared to a
domestic toll-free number are few:
 You can’t troubleshoot these numbers yourself.
 It generally takes twice as long to resolve the trouble ticket.

 You need to provide the call example with an origination number that
looks completely foreign to you. It might seem to have too many or too
few digits, but you will have to trust what the person in the foreign coun-
try is telling you and work with it.
 You have to refer to both the international toll-free number in the foreign
country as well as the domestic toll-free number it translates to.
Aside from these nuances, the rest of the procedure is essentially the same.
The carrier needs accurate and precise call examples, as always, and you
need to write down the trouble ticket number, take notes, and push the issue
through by calling for updates every couple of hours.

edicated circuits save your business money when they are working, but
if they fail, your company can come to a grinding halt. By identifying the
problem accurately and by working with the information you uncover, you
can greatly reduce your downtime.
Identifying the scope of a problem is always your first concern. When you
know the level at which the issue exists, you can evaluate all the hardware
and carriers that interact at that level and push forward with more tests. This
chapter walks you through all the troubleshooting techniques, shortcuts, and
pitfalls you might encounter with your dedicated circuits. 
Keeping your objectivity is crucial, because the moment you close your mind
to the possibility that the issue might be linked to a carrier or a piece of hard-
ware, you begin reducing your chances of success. In the court of telecom,
every variable is guilty until proven innocent. This philosophy should be the
foundation of your cross-examination in the coming pages.

Identifying the Level of Your Problem
Dedicated circuits come in many sizes, and the first order of business is to
isolate the level of the issue within the circuit. Here’s a rundown of the basic
levels of circuitry you might be dealing with:
 OC-12 or OC-3: Problems at these levels are usually related to large opti-
cal circuits. A problem at this level affects everything on the circuit.
Alternatively, you may have a problem that just affects part of the circuit
(one or two DS-1s on a specific DS-3), thus eliminating the OC-3 or the
larger OC-12 (in which the OC-3 rides) as the possible source of the
issue.
 DS-3: Problems at this level affect all the lower-level DS-1s and DS-0s. If
red lights or alarms are flashing on your DS-3 multiplexer where the coax
cable enters, and all of your DS-1s are down, you can trace the source to
the DS-3 level.
 DS-1 (also called T-1): Problems at this level affect the entire DS-1 circuit
and all the individual calls running on the circuit. If you have any individ-
ual DS-0 channel that is unaffected, your problem is not at the DS-1 level.
Don’t get tripped up if someone uses the term T-1. T-1s and DS-1s are
two names for exactly the same thing, like Bobby and Robert.
 DS-0: Problems at this level affect the individual call channel. These
problems are either isolated to individual DS-0 level interfaces on your
phone system, the DS-0 level hardware at your carrier, or somewhere
within the public switched telephone network (PSTN). You know you’re
dealing with a DS-0 problem if the problem only affects specific calls; it
won’t affect the entire DS-1 circuit.
The good news is that troubleshooting anything above the level of a T-1
(DS-1) circuit involves the same carriers and quantity of hardware. The
greatest change in variables occurs when troubleshooting issues at the
T-1 level and individual channel (DS-0) level. 
If your local carrier provides your dedicated circuit, be sure to include the
carrier in your troubleshooting process. Most dedicated circuits for voice
calls terminate at your long-distance carrier, and because of that, the local car-
rier has only a supporting role in the circuit. As you isolate dedicated circuits
from the DS-3 or DS-1 level down to the individual DS-0 channel level, take note
of the variables at work and who is responsible for each one.
260
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Identifying circuit variables in circuits
that are DS-3 or larger
Your multiplexer (MUX), the carrier’s multiplexer (at the level of your circuit —
DS-3 MUX for a DS-3 circuit, OC-12 MUX for an OC-12 circuit, and so on), and
the physical connection between the two pieces of hardware handled by the
provider of your local loop interact at the DS-3 level and higher.
If alarms ring on your DS-3 multiplexer, and the entire network span is down,
a DS-1-level issue is not bringing down your circuit. 
Similarly, if you have a problem with a T-1 circuit or on an individual channel
on a single T-1, the problem can’t be caused by the provider that supplies
your local loop or with the DS-3 MUX. This is because DS-3 and DS-1 circuit
problems don’t interact at the individual DS-0 channel level. If your entire DS-
3 has static on it, you must investigate the multiplexers on either end of your
local loop. If you have a continuity issue and the span is down, the problem
might lie with any of the cross-connects created by the local loop provider, or
it could be a defect in the multiplexer at either end.
261
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits
Beware the misdiagnosed problem
Begin troubleshooting your dedicated circuit
only after you confirm that your issue doesn’t
exist anywhere else. Use Chapters 11 and 12 to
compare call types and confirm the source of
your telecom problem. Your dedicated circuit
only involves a few miles of cabling and a few
pieces of hardware between your company and
your carrier. If calls that don’t use the dedicated
circuit also experience the same problem, you
need to report it to your carrier as a switched
problem. 
In fact, you may have a brand-new problem on
your hands if you open a trouble ticket for your
dedicated circuit and the problem could be
effectively resolved as a switched issue. Put
simply, troubleshooting the dedicated circuit
places your circuit at unnecessary risk; you may
end up taking down the circuit entirely, leaving
your business without phone service for the
duration of testing. 
If your issue affects a variety of your long-dis-
tance calls, from switched outbound calls to
dedicated inbound calls, I advise you (nay, I
entreat you) to open your trouble ticket on the
switched outbound issue, because it provides
the greatest focus for your carrier. 

Identifying DS-1-level circuit variables
The primary elements of hardware interacting at the DS-1 level that can nega-
tively affect the entire DS-1 circuit are 
 Your DS-1-level multiplexer.
 The echo cancellers within the circuit.
 The card that provides the DS-level multiplexing at your carrier.
 If you have individual local loops for each of your T-1 circuits, your local
loops are possible culprits. 
Just as you do when troubleshooting at the DS-3 level, you must consider
both the equipment that receives the circuit within your phone system and
your carrier’s hardware as the most likely culprits causing both quality and
continuity issues. The copper wire that makes up the local loop is also a pos-
sible source of DS-1-level problems. If someone cuts through the cable that
provides juice to your DS-1 circuit, everything riding through it is down hard.
At the DS-1 level of a circuit, you encounter your first increase in software
interaction.
If your local loop is a DS-3 circuit, or any circuit larger than the level of the
issue you have identified, the source of the problem is most likely not the
wiring or optical cable used to provide your local loop. If your DS-3 circuit
has continuity, it is a safe bet that the DS-1s within your DS-3 are safely being
received by your carrier and delivered to your phone system without inci-
dent. The local loop is essentially an empty pipe as far as your local loop
provider is concerned; the local loop provider interacts only at the highest
level of the circuit to maintain the clocking and keep the circuit stable. Your
local loop provider ignores the T-1s or individual channels (DS-0s) within the
local loop, except for the possible interaction of echo cancellers at the T-1 or
individual DS-0 level if the circuit is an ISDN circuit. 
Identifying DS-0 or individual 
channel issues
Individual channel issues generally indicate a problem with either your multi-
plexing hardware or the cards your carrier uses in its switch to perform the
multiplexing. You can identify a DS-0 issue pretty easily. If your DS-1 is work-
ing fine and many channels on the DS-1 can send and receive calls without
any problem, there are really only two main variables and one minor variable
to evaluate in determining the source of the problem. 
The main variables at the DS-0 level are the multiplexers on either side of the
circuit that break down the T-1 into individual channels. If your third DS-0 on
262
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

your T-1 has static, is unavailable, or if you can’t seize a dial tone on it, either
your hardware or your carrier’s hardware is failing for that channel. If you can
isolate both pieces of hardware and the problem doesn’t clear up, the only
other likely candidate is possibly an echo canceller somewhere in your circuit
that is malfunctioning or dying a slow death. The purpose of an echo canceller
(also referred to as an echo can) is to eliminate the echo heard on a call. If the
device is failing or was provisioned incorrectly, it can prevent your call from
completing with good quality, or at all.
You can also encounter problems at the individual call level caused by soft-
ware compatibility in the outpulse signaling and start. If your system is 
configured for loopstart and your carrier is set for E&M Immediate, you will
have problems making calls. This type of configuration issue causes calls to
suddenly disconnect, fail to connect at all, and otherwise fouls things up.
Configuration issues at the individual call level can also cause frame slip
errors and errors that can take down your entire circuit. Chapter 8 covers
line coding and framing in detail, as well as the symptoms you will encounter
due to frame slips and errors on your circuit.
Categorizing the Nature of Your Problem
Dedicated circuits can be intimidating because you are responsible for half of
the hardware that makes them work. On the other hand, the majority of prob-
lems you will likely encounter originate in your long-distance carrier’s
switched network, far beyond the end of your dedicated circuit. 
The same types of call quality and completion problems that you encounter
on switched calls can also affect the calls that pass through your dedicated
circuit. The joy of dedicated circuits is that you can test for either problem in
the exact same way: by isolating and eliminating each variable as you go
through your circuit. 
There might be other issues that are associated with your dedicated circuit,
such as dropped calls or intermittent echoes, that you troubleshoot based on
multiple call examples, but overall, the steps for resolution on dedicated cir-
cuits are the same. Chapter 11 covers the requirements for call examples and
why they are necessary in troubleshooting. 
Understanding dedicated 
call quality issues
If you have call quality issues that exist only on your dedicated circuit, you
can track down their sources much faster than you can call quality issues
that you notice in your carrier’s switched network. The calls running through
263
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

your carrier’s switched network may have 20 or 30 dedicated spans and
pieces of hardware associated with them, each one requiring tests and valida-
tion. If the quality issue is truly confined to your dedicated circuit, on the
other hand, your problem is confined to a finite space.
Quality issues such as static, low volume, clipping (where you hear continu-
ous split-second gaps in your conversation), and possibly even echo, leave a
trail of clues and evidence for you to follow as you troubleshoot. All these
issues can be the result of poorly provisioned hardware; maybe one section
of the circuit is set up for loopstart signaling and the rest of the circuit is set
up for E&M Wink signaling (read more about these settings in Chapter 8). A
piece of hardware wearing out and failing could also cause quality issues.
Confirming what’s what with defective hardware is not difficult because all
network switches in North America have computer files that can be activated
to collect performance data on the circuit. 
Files saved by computer software to monitor call performance are unorigi-
nally called performance monitors (PMs), and they collect information on the
quantity and type of errors on a dedicated circuit. Your phone system may
have a similar feature, allowing you to collect the errors experienced by your
hardware. If your hardware isn’t as advanced, you can request the informa-
tion from your carrier by calling to open a trouble ticket. PM software catego-
rizes errors in several categories. If there was no error on a circuit in a
particular category, the “0” error count is listed. The quantity of each type of
error guides you to other areas of inquiry when you see them. Here are some
common PM errors:
 Erred seconds: You find erred seconds on a circuit with a minor problem.
An erred second indicates that for the duration of one second, the com-
munication of the circuit was distorted. The overhead information may
have been lost for that specific second because some piece of hardware
experienced a low-level, intermittent electrical short. You might experi-
ence minor static or quality issues that are more of an annoyance than a
concern.
 Severely erred seconds: You can find severely erred seconds on a cir-
cuit with large issues. The severely erred seconds indicate a larger issue
whereby information was not only missing, but replaced with aberrant
data. These errors often cause static or line noise so severe that you
can’t hear the person you are calling. If your circuit has severely erred
seconds but you aren’t experiencing any regular quality issues, you
might instead notice that your calls disconnect prematurely or that your
entire circuit drops unexpectedly.
 Framing slip: Framing slips signal a configuration problem, generally a
timing issue where your hardware is attempting to correct a lag behind
264
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

the master clock of your carrier. If you aren’t clocking off your carrier
(see Chapter 8 if the term clocking isn’t clicking for you), or if your hard-
ware is set up for an outpulse signal and start that doesn’t match your
carrier, you can expect frame slips. 
The bad news about frame slips is that they may be small, minor, and go
unnoticed by you as they accumulate, until the point where they drop
your circuit. 
 Unavailable seconds: Unavailable seconds are just that, seconds of time
when the network thinks your circuit is unavailable. Unplugging your
hardware generates unavailable seconds in your carrier’s network as
easily as a fiber cut or an accidental removal of your cross-connect by
your local loop provider. 
One of the simplest things you can do to see whether a problem on your ded-
icated circuit can resolve itself is to reboot the whole system. Sometimes all
you need is PFM (pure friggin’ magic) to get everything to right itself. If you
decide to reboot your system, make sure that your carrier pulls the PMs
before you reboot your hardware; this way, you can prevent confusion. Even
if you have a clean circuit, as soon as you power down your channel bank
and reboot it, you create a handful of errors on the circuit. Even if you have a
legitimate issue on your circuit, rebooting has the potential to mask the true
issue and enlarge the number of errors your carrier finds. For more informa-
tion about PFM, check out Chapter 16.
Without controlled testing, your carrier won’t know which piece of hardware
is generating the errors, or when the errors were created. Errors that exist in
the PM files don’t have time stamps next to them, only total error counts for
a given period of time. If the PMs show your circuit received 176 erred sec-
onds and 56 severely erred seconds in the past 24 hours, you have no way of
identifying whether all the errors occurred in one group as your circuit took a
hit, or if they were generated periodically over the past 24 hours. The only
way to validate the frequency of errors is to purge the PM files and check it
every 15 minutes, in order to determine the rate at which the errors are 
generated.
Understanding circuit failure issues
The larger the problem, the easier it is to find. If your circuit is completely
down and alarms are sounding on your hardware, the bad news is that you
may have a large problem, but the good news is that finding its source is
pretty easy. 
265
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

Most dedicated circuits are only about 4 or 5 miles long and have a handful of
hardware interfaces in them from end to end. If any single piece of hardware
or cabling that handles your circuit fails, your circuit will fail along with it.
You know your circuit is in failure when
 Your multiplexer and/or CSU have active alarms. This can include
flashing red lights where there used to be solid green lights, and/or an
annoying beeping sound.
 You can’t make calls or receive toll-free calls on your circuit. On the
other hand, if outbound calls on your circuit are affected, but you can
receive dedicated toll-free calls, the problem is most likely with your
phone system, not the circuit. 
 Everyone in the office is yelling at you to fix the phones. A heightened
level of telecom awareness and irritation in your office is a strong indica-
tion that your dedicated circuit isn’t working right. In this case, just tell
everyone not to worry and show them your Telecom For Dummies book.
When they see it, they will be instantly calmed and realize that you are
in complete control of the situation. 
Even after you find the source of a problem, repairing it can take many more
hours. Dispatching a technician from your local loop provider requires coor-
dination to have someone at your office let the technician into the building.
Depending on the technician’s schedule and yours, the logistics of setting up
a dispatch might push the repair out to the next business day. To prevent
your problem from dragging on, the second you realize that you have a
system failure (whether it occasionally bounces back or not), push to get it
into the queue for a technician as quickly as you can.
266
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 
Got a headache? Then you must have 
a bouncing circuit
Circuits don’t always fail and stay down.
Sometimes a circuit may bounce, meaning that
it fails and then comes back to life, only to drop
again and repeat the cycle a few minutes later.
A bouncing circuit is problematic, because 
it requires you to make a decision: You must
either limp along and live with the circuit failing
every so often or you must let your carrier take
the circuit down for 30 to 60 minutes to test the
circuit and find the problem. You hardly have
any choice at all if the circuit drops so fre-
quently that it might as well be permanently
down. On the other hand, if you have just a few
hours to go before you can legitimately close
down business for the day, you might be better
off hanging in there and suffering through the
rest of a very long afternoon. Then after every-
one goes home, release the circuit for testing.

Opening a Trouble Ticket for 
Your Dedicated Circuit
After you have some preliminary information about the trouble with your cir-
cuit, you need to call your carrier and open a trouble ticket. It’s at this time
that you will realize the benefits of having a technical cut sheet. If you have
not made one yet, now is a great time to do so. Check out the Cheat Sheet at
the front of this book to set up a cut sheet today. 
Going through the basics
If you don’t have a cut sheet, you need to write down the circuit ID for every
circuit that is having problems, at a very minimum. Your carrier needs this
information to identify your circuit and begin the troubleshooting process. In
addition to your circuit ID, your carrier might also ask you the following
questions:
 Does your hardware show any alarms? If so, what color are they and
where are you seeing these alarms (CSU or multiplexer)? Both the
alarms and their location indicate to your carrier what kind of problems
your circuit is experiencing. If you have red alarms on your multiplexer,
the carrier knows that the circuit is down hard and that your business
has no phone service at all. On the other hand, if your CSU is experienc-
ing yellow alarms, your circuit could be intermittently down and bounc-
ing back. If you don’t know this information, you can simply tell your
carrier that you haven’t checked yet, but that you still want to open the
trouble ticket.
 Have you rebooted your multiplexer/CSU, and if so, how did it affect
the problem? You might temporarily resolve some problems by reboot-
ing your hardware. Rebooting enables your hardware to refresh the con-
nection to your carrier and synch up. The only variable you are testing
when you reboot is the multiplexer. If the problem clears when you
reboot, your hardware is probably the source of your issue. If it persists
without any change when you reboot, the source of the problem could
be within your carrier. 
 What are your hours of operation? In the event that a technician has to
be dispatched to your office to fix the problem, your carrier needs to
know when someone will be there to let in the technician. If you have 
an after-hours employee who will be on-site, be sure to provide that
employee’s name and phone number (if the system is down hard, pro-
vide a cellphone number). You don’t want the technician to arrive and
267
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

have no idea where to go. If the receptionist or building security has no
idea you have a technician on the way, but the technician says, “I was
told to ask for Janice Jackson,” he or she is more likely to get through
the front door.
 When did you first notice the problem? This information gives your
carrier direction in the search. If there was a large outage that hit your
area an hour ago, and that is roughly when you noticed the situation, the
carrier can easily combine your issue with the overarching trouble ticket
(sometimes called a master trouble ticket). Of course, your problem may
not be related to a larger issue, but offering a time frame does give your
carrier some indication of events that occurred that may have caused
your issue.
 Who is the site contact? Your carrier needs to know who to call for
updates. Please provide a direct phone number, a cellphone number, and
a secondary means of contact if your contact plans on being unavailable
at any time during the day. It’s painful to pick up a voicemail from your
cellphone after you have lost four hours because you ran into a meeting,
got busy, and didn’t have time to listen to it until the end of the day. 
 Is the circuit released for intrusive testing? Intrusive testing is the most
direct way your carrier can investigate an issue with a dedicated circuit.
The main downside of intrusive testing is that your circuit will be com-
pletely down while your carrier takes over every channel. Of course, if
the system is already down, you have nothing to lose. On the other
hand, if your circuit is active when you release it for intrusive testing,
any active calls will be disconnected when the carrier initiates the test.
See the section, later in this chapter, “Step 2: Intrusively testing: Looping
the CSU” for more information about timing your test.
Letting your channels be your guide
When you open a trouble ticket, it’s always helpful to ask the carrier for a cir-
cuit snapshot. A snapshot of the circuit is the disposition of each channel on
your circuit. Even if you think you have a DS-1 level issue, it’s always a good
practice to ask for this information. You might believe that your entire circuit
is being affected, but a snapshot could reveal that only half of the channels
are impaired. With basic facts from the PMs and a circuit snapshot, you can
begin setting realistic expectations for resolution of your service. Additionally,
you can isolate individual DS-0 issues to the specific channels experiencing
the problem. To solve your problem, you might be able to reboot your phone
system to bring the channels back into service, or have your phone system
deselect them as available lines. The key is using every available bit of infor-
mation your circuit provides. Taking in the disposition of your individual DS-0
channels on your DS-1 circuit is a quick and easy way to glean what is happen-
ing to your circuit.
268
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Idle: IDL
Your channels are in an idle state when they have access to your carrier’s
network, but don’t have an active call. This is the state you expect your chan-
nels to be in when everything is working fine and the circuit is waiting to
process a call.
The circuit must be considered idle by both your carrier’s technology and
your own phone system in order for a call to come through on the line. If,
according to your carrier, the channels are idle, but your hardware is unable
to seize the channels for some reason, one end of the circuit isn’t speaking to
the other. Open a trouble ticket. The problem might be between your phone
system and your multiplexer, or your multiplexer and your CSU. If your car-
rier sees the circuit as active and you can’t seize a channel, there must be a
piece of hardware interacting with your carrier to make the carrier think
everything is fine. 
Call processing busy: CPB
Call processing busy or CPB is the healthy state of a channel with an active
call on it. Under normal circumstances, your active circuit has several chan-
nels in the CPB state, indicating active calls on the specific DS-0s. The rest of
the channels are idle, waiting to accept a call. A circuit with channels in CPB
is obviously connected to the carrier, because only a call that is connected to
the network can establish the channel in this state.
Remote made busy: RMB
Remote made busy or RMB is a common disposition for a channel if you’re
dealing with hardware issues. The carrier may see a DS-0 in this state when
269
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits
Remembering the first rule of troubleshooting
The first rule of troubleshooting is to keep an
open mind. Suspecting that a problem can be
attributed to a particular source is fine, but don’t
be so sure you’re right that you lose perspec-
tive. All the circuit states I describe in the fol-
lowing sections do suggest a likely source for
the problem you’re experiencing with your ded-
icated circuit. Most of the time, for example, 
a channel in RMB (remote made busy) state is
having hardware troubles. However, there is
that tiny chance that a glitch within your carrier
is causing it to send the channel a message, or
triggering the channel to sit in RMB. Alternative
scenarios are always possible, not just for
channels in an RMB state, but for all the circuit
states listed in this chapter. Use the information
to guide your troubleshooting, but don’t be so
hung up on a single right answer that you dis-
count the possibility that something else is
causing the issue.

your hardware independently locks out the channel. Channels in an RMB
state can sometimes be corrected if your carrier takes down the specific
channel and resets it (this process is commonly called bouncing a channel). If
your carrier can’t bring the DS-0 back into service by bouncing it, the only
way to restore the channel is for you to reboot the hardware. If this condition
is chronic, contact your hardware vendor to test the hardware. It’s better to
find the problem when it’s minor, than to let it go until the point at which the
channel won’t come back to life after you reboot.
D channel made busy: DMB
The D channel made busy state is used only with ISDN circuits. Only ISDN cir-
cuits have D channels designated for signaling, and that is why non-ISDN cir-
cuits can’t have channels in this state. When the D channel made busy state
appears on an ISDN circuit, the entire circuit is down. The D channel handles
all the logistics of call setup and teardown on an ISDN circuit, and without the
overhead, the circuit can’t function. 
This condition can be the result of your hardware having issues (see the sec-
tion on RMB, earlier in this chapter), your carrier having issues, or an ISDN
protocol mismatch. 
Installation made busy: IMB
Installation made busy, or IMB, is a protected state that is usually imposed by
your carrier on an entire circuit to prevent it from generating alarms in the
carrier’s network. For example, if you unplug your hardware from the circuit,
your carrier immediately sees alarms at its end of the span. The technician
who is listening to the piercing screech of the alarm doesn’t have your con-
tact name and phone number, so he or she does the easiest thing to end the
maddening alarm. Usually, the easiest thing to do is to busy out the circuit, or
place the circuit into the IMB state. The bad news is that when you plug your
hardware back in, you won’t be able to use it because the carrier has been
busied it out. 
Every carrier has its own procedure for placing a circuit into the IMB state.
The process might be manual, with a policy to wait until the circuit has been
in alarm mode for eight or ten hours before busying out the circuit.
Sometimes, however, the process is automated; you may have as little as an
hour before the carrier automatically busies out your system.
Carrier failure: CFL
Carrier failure is like IMB, because it generally affects your entire circuit, 
and not just a few channels. The bad news about a circuit in carrier failure is
that this state commonly indicates a substantial problem that needs to be
addressed pronto by your carrier. If your CSU fails, or if someone accidentally
cuts through the wiring of your circuit with a backhoe, or if your carrier’s
switch sustains a direct lightning strike, your circuit is in carrier failure. 
270
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Carrier failure indicates a more serious issue and generally takes several
hours to diagnose. After the technician finds the source of the problem, it can
be another 4 to 24 hours before your circuit is back in service. Keep this in
mind when you set expectations. (In other words, it’s time to have a chat
with the head of your telemarketing department.)
Managing Your Dedicated Trouble Ticket
After you have opened your trouble ticket with your carrier, be sure to write
down all the following information to make it easier to manage the issue:
 The trouble ticket number.
 The name and contact information of the person at your carrier who
opened the ticket.
 The time and date the ticket was opened.
 The disposition of the DS-0s of your circuit (if available).
 The errors listed on the performance monitors, if any (if the customer
service representative can access the file).
 Any testing you completed and the results of the tests. (Did your carrier
bounce the circuit by taking the circuit out of service and restoring it?
Did that solve the problem?)
271
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits
Avoiding permanent IMB status
To prevent your circuit from spending more time
in IMB than it needs to, open an information-
only trouble ticket with your carrier before
unplugging your hardware for any reason. This
type of trouble ticket alerts the carrier to the
fact that you will be removing your hardware
from the circuit and gives you a trouble ticket
number to reference when you call into have
the circuit taken out of IMB. 
If you don’t want to go through this effort, simply
place a loopback plug in the T-1 jack of the 
circuit from which you’re disconnecting. This
simple action tricks your carrier into thinking
there is hardware connected on your end of the
circuit for as long as the loopback plug is in
place. This isn’t an option if you have ISDN cir-
cuits, because your carrier needs to chat with
your D channels to ensure that the hardware is
active. The ISDN protocol is generally intelligent
enough to know that it is speaking to itself and
eventually places the circuit in alarm.
Removing a circuit from IMB takes about five
minutes, after you reach a technician with the
required credentials to make the change. The
greatest potential delay comes from wading
through the customer service department and
waiting for the magic technician with the
access to the switch to call you back.

The final bit of information your carrier should provide to you is when you
can expect a call back on your ticket, and who will be calling. Regardless of
the time frame you’re given, write it down, and schedule to call the carrier
back at that time. If the technician calls you before the deadline, great, but if
he or she doesn’t, you need to call back in order to escalate your issue.
Getting the Basics of Dedicated
Outbound Troubleshooting
When you troubleshoot a dedicated circuit, you do it in the reverse order
that you troubleshoot switched phone lines. If you have a problem calling
Hoboken, New Jersey, on a switched phone line, for example, you should per-
form your troubleshooting before you call your carrier and open up a trouble
ticket. When it comes to dedicated circuits, however, you begin your trou-
bleshooting after you open the ticket. 
The reason you should open your trouble ticket forthwith is because you don’t
have many testing options on a circuit without the aid of a technician from
your carrier. You might know that your circuit isn’t working, but only your car-
rier can tell that 10 of your channels are in an RMB state and 14 are in IDL. Even
if you know the problem you are experiencing is caused by your hardware, you
should still open a trouble ticket to receive help validating the source. 
The troubleshooting steps in this chapter deal with a simple dedicated long-
distance voice circuit with one local loop provider. If you have a type 2 or
type 3 circuit that involves more than one carrier to deliver the local loop,
the troubleshooting process is more involved and beyond the scope of this
book. One thing I do suggest is that you put all the carriers involved in your
circuit on a conference call at the same time.
Step 1: Rebooting your hardware
If your circuit is down hard, either in an RMB or CFL state, it’s always good to
begin your troubleshooting by rebooting your multiplexer and/or CSU. 
The two pieces of hardware that are actually talking to each other on the cir-
cuit are your multiplexer and the computer card at your carrier that func-
tions like a multiplexer, so rebooting the hardware on your side may resolve
the issue. If rebooting brings your circuit back up, you should still follow up
with the trouble ticket to determine the root of the problem. Most problems
don’t happen once and then disappear forever. If troubleshooting indicates a
hardware problem, you ought to replace the faulty hardware while it’s still
limping along, instead of waiting for it to fail completely.
272
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

Rebooting your hardware isn’t helpful for troubleshooting call quality issues,
because they will generally be the result of something being set up wrong or
a progressive failure in a section of your hardware. The first problem could
be anything from a protocol mismatch to a configuration mismatch.
Here are some important rebooting do’s and don’ts:
 Do make sure more than one person knows how to reboot the phone
hardware. You and someone else in your office (your backup) should
know how to reboot every piece of your phone system. It’s a waste of
time and money to call out your hardware vendor to push one button. If
you don’t know how to reboot your hardware, ask your hardware vendor
to show you. If it’s a complicated procedure, have the vendor write it in
black pen on the wall of the phone room next to your hardware. It’s well
worth having graffiti on your wall to be able to confidently push a button
without worrying what will happen (besides, graffiti art is cool).
 Don’t be in the dark about whether your phone system will restore to
default settings. It’s uncommon, but not unheard of, for hardware to
restore to default settings after being rebooted. When you discuss recy-
cling the power of your PBX, multiplexer, and CSU (as well as any other
servers or devices attached to these three pieces of hardware) with
your vendor, be sure to ask about possible side effects of rebooting.
While you are at it, also ask about fixing these side effects if they come
up. The solution might be very simple, or it might be, “don’t touch any-
thing; just call me.” Either way, this information is good to know.
273
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits
Understanding your trouble ticket options
You can open special trouble tickets for specific
issues. Not only can you open a ticket for repair,
you an also open an information-only ticket, or
a tech assist ticket. Opening an information-only
ticket allows you to officially relay information
to your carrier. If you want to tell your carrier
that you will be disconnecting your hardware
for the weekend because you are moving your
phone closet to another suite, for example, the
informational trouble ticket relays the informa-
tion and gives you quicker access to a techni-
cian if you need one. 
Use a tech assist ticket to schedule nonemer-
gency testing between your carrier and your
hardware vendor. If you are replacing your hard-
ware, for instance, you should coordinate with
your carrier to be either on the phone with your
hardware vendor while making the change, or at
least to be immediately available to the vendor. 
The last thing you need when you encounter a
problem during such a change is to wait hours
to speak to a technician. You might not be incon-
venienced if the maintenance takes place after
normal business hours, but your wallet will still
be skinnier after you have to pay for your vendor
to sit around and wait for the call.

 Do make note of the frequency of your reboots. If your circuit drops on
a regular basis, be it once a month or once every three months, but
immediately comes back to life when you reboot your hardware, your
hardware might have a timing issue. A timing issue can be caused by
your hardware utilizing a clock for the point of reference on your TDM
circuit that doesn’t come from your carrier, or the section of your hard-
ware that handles the clocking on the circuit may be failing. In either
case, timing issues cause the phone system to accumulate small slips
within the circuit that eventually cause the circuit to fail. You might
ignore the problem because your circuit comes back to life as soon as
you reboot, but the issue isn’t solved. It will progress over time, and the
time it takes for your circuit to fail will gradually become shorter. If this
scenario sounds familiar, contact your hardware vendor to check your
phone equipment. If this doesn’t make a lot of sense to you, read up on
the clock source requirements of dedicated circuits in Chapter 8.
Step 2: Intrusively testing: 
Looping the CSU
Your carrier can intrusively test a circuit, which renders the circuit useless 
to you during the duration of the test. Every channel of the circuit being
tested must be engaged so you won’t have any room left to either make or
receive calls.
As soon as your carrier begins intrusive testing on your circuit, all the active
calls on your circuit will be disconnected. The testing environment usurps all
the bandwidth. Your hardware can’t grab any DS-0 to make or receive a call
during an intrusive test. If your circuit is already down, you should release it
for intrusive testing. If the circuit is bouncing, or only slightly impaired, you
need to make a judgment call. Can your business stand to have the circuit
down for 30 to 60 minutes now, or should you wait until after your office
closes to release it for intrusive testing? 
You don’t have to release your circuit for intrusive testing at your carrier’s
discretion when you open your trouble ticket. If your circuit is bouncing, ask
the carrier to do some preliminary work first (such as accessing the system’s
performance monitors). You can always release the circuit for testing after
hours, say at 7 p.m. central standard time. This way, you can get basic infor-
mation, and when you get in tomorrow morning, you can get more informa-
tion about what the carrier found during the intrusive test.
An intrusive test involves looping the CSU. Looping is a general term used in
telecom that describes the act of sending an electrical signal to a specific piece
274
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

of hardware where it’s bounced back to your carrier. Your carrier technicians
actually send a stream of data down the circuit, possibly consisting of all 1s
or all 0s. If every “1” the technician sends in a test effectively hits the desired
endpoint and comes back to your carrier, your circuit has solid continuity
from your carrier to that point. 
If the idea of looping doesn’t make sense to you, imagine it another way. If
you have a garden hose with leaks, the easiest way to find them is by placing
a spray nozzle on the end of the hose and closing it so no water can escape.
After the end is sealed off, you can check for leaks by turning on the faucet
and looking for any water springing out of it. Intrusive testing does the same
thing, but with data. If you send a series of 27 consecutive 1s down the circuit
and only 25 return, you know that a pair of your 1s were lost somewhere
between the point at which the data originated and the looped piece of hard-
ware that is sending it back to you. Losing data means that you have a prob-
lem in that section of your circuit.
There are many tests that your carrier can use when looping a piece of hard-
ware. They have names like QUAZI, 4 and 8, 6 and 2, and my personal
favorite, all 1s. Some tests are more rigorous on a circuit than others, so have
your carrier try a few of them if you don’t feel confident with the results of
the first test. 
Intrusively testing a dedicated circuit follows a very methodical sequence.
Your carrier’s first test is attempting to loop your CSU. If you don’t know
what a CSU is, please check out Chapter 4 for info on your hardware require-
ments for a dedicated circuit. If you are more concerned with how the CSU is
positioned in the circuit, check out Figure 13-1 to see where it lives in the
dedicated circuit landscape.

Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits
Dealing with synch issues 
caused by Dialogic cards
If you are using Dialogic cards as the multiplex-
ing interface on your side of the circuit, you may
have problems when you reboot your hardware.
There is a known issue that exists between
Dialogic cards and some switches that the car-
riers use. If you find that your Dialogic cards
don’t automatically synch up when you reboot,
or if individual channels lock up when you dial to
a bad phone number (where you receive a
recording or a fast busy signal), you need to
enable the CRC-6 setting on your Dialogic card
to resolve the issue. You might also need to
reboot your Dialogic card before the program-
ming change takes effect. After the setting is
enabled, your channels shouldn’t fall out of sync
with your carrier any more.

Figure 13-1 shows that the CSU is the first piece of hardware your carrier
identifies as your responsibility. There is a cable from the NIU to your CSU
that is also your responsibility, but it isn’t generally loopable, so the CSU is
the default piece of hardware used as the first point for testing.
Not all CSUs are identical. Your CSU might not be a free-standing piece of
hardware as portrayed in Figure 13-1, and might instead be an integrated card
housed within your multiplexer. It’s uncommon, but not unheard of, for a CSU
to not be loopable. This isn’t a huge stumbling block, but you simply need to
be aware of this bit of trivia. Your carrier might try to imply that your hard-
ware is defective, because the carrier can’t loop your CSU. 
If looping the CSU fails
Here are the possible meanings of a failure to loop the CSU:
 If you can’t loop the CSU, this is a strong indication that there are prob-
lems somewhere in your local loop. 
 If you are testing to identify the source of a circuit failure issue, and your
carrier can’t see the CSU to loop it, there’s a break in the circuit some-
where in the area being tested.

Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

 If you are troubleshooting for a call quality issue and you can loop the
CSU (indicating that you have electrical continuity) but you receive
errors, some piece of hardware within the testing area is probably dying
a slow death. 
These tests don’t indicate that your CSU is the problem; they simply indicate
that something between your CSU and the CFA point is the problem. The only
way to isolate the issue is to proceed to “Step 3: Looping the NIU.”
If looping the CSU is successful
If your carrier can loop your CSU without a problem (for circuit failure
issues) and can run test patterns to it without taking any errors (for circuit
quality issues), the entire section of the circuit you are testing is clean.
Looping your CSU generally causes the equipment on the other side of it, 
usually your multiplexer, to idle up all the channels. 
Looping the CSU not only bounces the circuit signal back to your carrier, but
also bounces the signal that it’s sending back to your multiplexer. If your
MUX doesn’t idle up to the back of the looped CSU, your next course of
action is to have your hardware vendor test your MUX to determine whether
it’s the point of failure. 
Looping a piece of hardware doesn’t confirm that everything is wired cor-
rectly to the device being tested; it simply confirms that you have electrical
continuity. See the following section to make sure your wires aren’t crossed.
Making sure your crossover cables aren’t straight-through cables
Dedicated circuits have designated wires to transmit and receive signals.
Even if these transmit and receive wires are crossed between the NIU and the
CSU, you can still loop the CSU; but in that case, the T-1 level of your circuit
won’t idle up. If this situation occurs, you need to check the configuration of
the cable you are using to connect your NIU to your CSU.
There are two main varieties of cables in telecom, straight-through cables, 
and crossover cables. The wires that make up cables are numbered for easy
reference, allowing you to understand why they have their specific label.
Figure 13-2 shows a four-wire circuit, with each wire identified by a number.
You can see how the black wire #1 on the straight-through cable remains 
wire #1 at the far end, whereas it ends up as wire #4 on the far end of the
crossover cable. Needless to say, it’s very easy to wire a cable incorrectly 
and end up using the wrong wires for transmit and receive.
277
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

If the CSU can be looped and you have checked the cabling, but you still
don’t have dial tone, you need to confirm the configuration of your circuit. In
spite of the fact that you may have confirmed the line coding and framing is
set for B8ZS/ESF on both ends of the loop, that still doesn’t prove that a piece
of hardware isn’t programmed incorrectly. Your carrier can validate that the
line is B8ZS/ESF by sending all 0s down the circuit. If the zeros come back
without errors, you can rest assured that all the hardware it’s hitting is con-
figured for B8ZS/ESF. Your carrier can run the same type of test for AMI/SF by
sending down all 1s. When you’ve validated the line coding, you should con-
firm the outpulse signal and start (E&M Wink or Immediate, loopstart, or
groundstart) on both your hardware and the carrier. If you want more infor-
mation about dedicated circuit line configuration options, like B8ZS/ESF, see
Chapter 8.
If the CSU can be looped, and the configuration has been confirmed, the next
variable to examine is the hardware on both ends of the circuit. Just as you
have a multiplexer that breaks down your T-1 into 24 individual channels,
your carrier has a card in its phone switch that does the same thing. 
It’s very unlikely that a T-1 level card in your carrier’s switch will fail, but it
does happen. If you have more than one circuit and only one of the circuits
has been acting up, ask your carrier to reassign one of the known bad circuits
to the card that is working on the good circuit. If your hardware instantly
comes to life when you are on the known good card, the other card is obvi-
ously bad (that was the only variable you changed). If you make the change
and your circuit is still down, your hardware is probably the source of the
trouble. Move on to the following section.
Using a T-1 test set
If all the previous tests don’t reveal the source of your problem, your next
step is to replace your hardware and see whether that brings the circuit up. If

Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

this doesn’t resolve your issue, you need to call out a hardware technician
with a portable T-1 test set, possibly a Phoenix test set model 5575 or a T-Berd
test set made by TTC. 
If you have a complex phone system, or if your business is in any way based
on providing phone service, whoever is servicing your phone system should
have a piece of testing hardware. Test sets look like a cross between a tool-
box and a 1930s lunch box. They range in price from a few hundred dollars
for a used Phoenix 5575A, to several thousand dollars for a fully fleshed out
TTC T-Berd or TTC FireBerd with all the available ISDN options. 
Having a test set for your dedicated circuit is very helpful, so chat with your
hardware provider and see what is the best test set for your application and
budget. A refurbished Phoenix 5575A might be all you will need and is well
worth the $200 you might end up spending for it on eBay.
If you don’t want to buy your own test set, you can always have a hardware
technician come out and do the work for you. Call your hardware vendor and
set up an appointment as soon as possible. 
With a test set, you can run the continuity tests that your carrier typically
performs. This allows you to begin testing as soon as you have a problem on
your circuit, without waiting for a technician to call you back. After you have
a technician on the line testing, you can validate his or her findings, and pro-
vide the technician with much greater information on your circuit. You can
plug the test set into your circuit between the NIU and your CSU for the great-
est vantage point. By placing the test set in your circuit at this location, you
bypass your entire phone system. This is a tremendous benefit because the
test set acts as an insulator between your hardware and your carrier. If 
your test set is monitoring the signal coming in from your carrier and it
shows that the carrier is sending B8ZS/ESF signaling rather than AMI/SF,
there is no way the problem can be related to your multiplexer. All the hard-
ware behind your test set is hidden by it and invisible to your carrier. The
minor investment will pay off, because it will no longer be possible for your
hardware vendor and your carrier to point fingers at each other. The test set
is an independent piece of hardware that you can use to replace your multi-
plexer in the circuit, and can allow you to dial out on an individual channel if
your test set has the correct options. If your problem clears when your car-
rier is connected to your test set rather than to your multiplexer, your hard-
ware is at fault and your next course of action is a detailed check of your
multiplexer and the network behind it.
Step 3: Looping the NIU
If your carrier can’t loop your CSU, the next step to attempt is to drop back
one step closer to the CFA point of your circuit and loop your NIU (or one
279
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

step closer to Nirvana, depending on your perspective). The NIU is the last
piece of hardware that your local carrier installed, as shown in Figure 13-3.
By looping the NIU, your carrier can test to the back end of the NIU where
your local carrier wires into it. Your goal when methodically validating
smaller sections of the circuit from the CSU back to your carrier is to find the
section that is without errors or problems. Stepping back your continuity
tests (for circuit failure issues) or error tests for a clean span (for quality
issues) to a section without issues gives you a starting point on the circuit
that you know is good. After you find that good section, you can focus your
efforts on the next variable, working your way closer to your CSU, which is
the hardware or the span of the circuit that’s most likely the source of the
issue.
If you can loop the NIU
If your carrier can loop the NIU but not the CSU, the problem lies somewhere
between the back end of the NIU and the front end of the CSU. The cabling or
the CSU has a break in the wiring (if your carrier is seeing a lack of continuity
on the line, often referred to as an open) or is shorting out (if the carrier sees
errors).
If you test the CSU and it can be looped, you need to ask whomever provided
the inside wiring to repair the trouble. If your local carrier pulled the inside
wiring, it might be quicker to have your hardware vendor validate or rerun
the cabling, instead of waiting the one to five days to have your local carrier
dispatch someone to your site. To test the inside wiring, proceed to “Step 4:
Looping to your T-1 jack.”

If you can’t loop the NIU
If you can’t loop the NIU, there is a problem in the local loop, or possibly
within your long-distance carrier’s network. The only way to isolate the issue
is to continue working back on the circuit towards the CFA point until you
find a good section that doesn’t have errors. In this case, proceed straight to
“Step 5: Looping the CFA point” for additional troubleshooting.
Step 4: Looping to your T-1 jack
It’s unlikely that your CSU is connected directly into your NIU. These two
pieces of hardware might be in different sections of your building, connected
by the inside wiring that ends next to your phone system in a small T-1 phone
jack (called an RJ-45 jack). Figure 13-4 shows how the RJ-45 jack sits between
your NIU and your CSU at the end of your inside wiring.

Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits
Getting the scoop on loops
There are two varieties of testing loops in the
world of telecom: soft loops and hard loops.
CSUs and NIUs generate soft loops, which use
software to bounce the signaling on a circuit
back to its point of origin. You create hard loops
by physically wiring together the transmit and
receive lines on a circuit. You typically place a
hard loop in a circuit by using a loopback plug,
but both loops perform the same function.

In order to test to the RJ-45 jack for continuity and errors, you have to plug
into it with a test set, or use a loopback plug, which is a much cheaper alter-
native. Loopback plugs are available in both male and female versions so that
you can test your cables and the T-1 jack on the wall. 
The appendix at the end of this book offers detailed descriptions of the loop-
back plugs. They are well worth the 50 cents of hardware it takes to make them
(although the crimper tool used to clamp down the pins may cost up to $50). 
When you place the loopback plug in the jack, you allow your carrier to con-
tinue to send signals through the NIU to the phone jack. If the carrier can see
the loopback plug and run test patterns without losing any data or receiving
errors, you know that the section of the cabling to that point is solid. If your
carrier can’t see the loopback plug, or is taking errors to it, but can loop the
NIU without a problem, your trouble lives in the wiring between the NIU and
that T-1 jack. Figure 13-5 illustrates the portion of the circuit you have to test
next. 
You can extend the test to the end of the cable that feeds into your CSU if you
have a female loopback plug to receive the T-1 cable that was plugged into
your CSU. 
If you can loop the T-1 jack
Successfully looping your T-1 jack or the end of the cabling that leads to your
CSU indicates that you have good physical continuity on your circuit to that
point. If you are troubleshooting an issue where your carrier can’t reach your

CSU, you probably have a defective CSU. If you had quality issues and the
loopback tests came back clean to the hard loop on the RJ-45 jack, you again
know that any static or frame slips you are experiencing aren’t being gener-
ated by the wiring. Your next phase of testing is asking your hardware vendor
to validate or replace your CSU, because that is the last possible variable
causing your issue.
If you can’t loop the T-1 jack
You are facing an interesting situation; you can loop the NIU but you can’t
loop the T-1 jack. There are only two variables between these two pieces of
hardware: 
 The first variable is the cabling that connects them. 
 The second variable is the T-1 jack on your NIU into which that cabling
is connected. 
Follow these steps:
1. Find your NIU (remember, it might be in a locked phone room some-
where else in your building).
2. Place your male loopback plug in the jack where the cabling for your
circuit begins. 
Depending on the results of the test, you have two scenarios:
If your carrier can see the loopback plug and the NIU is good, the
cabling is defective between it and your T-1 jack. In this case, you
need to have the person who pulled that cabling dispatched to
repair it. 
If your carrier can’t see that loopback plug, the jack you are
plugged into is defective and the local carrier needs to replace 
the NIU.
Step 5: Looping the CFA point
The CFA point is the physical point where your long-distance carrier connects
into the local carrier’s network. At this point in troubleshooting, you can’t
easily segment the circuit, so you need to determine whether the issue is
with your carrier or with your local loop provider.
Figure 13-6 shows how the CFA point acts as the demarcation point (or
demarc) between your carrier and the local loop provider.
283
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

If your carrier can loop its CFA point
If your carrier can loop the CFA point and run a clean test to it, but the car-
rier notes errors when running to the NIU, the problem is with the local car-
rier section of the circuit. If your long-distance carrier ordered the local loop,
then one of its representatives has to open a trouble ticket with the local loop
provider. (If you ordered the local loop, you have to open the trouble ticket
on your own). This process can take four or more hours before the local loop
provider responds to the problem and dispatches a technician. If the trouble
ticket is opened late in the day, a technician might not be available until the
following business day.
If you can’t loop the CFA
If your carrier can’t loop the CFA point, the issue lies within the carrier’s sec-
tion of the circuit. Because the problem is contained within one carrier, you
could see a much faster resolution. Simply call the technician every hour or
so to follow up until the situation is resolved. 
Following a Dedicated Troubleshooting
Shortcut
If your carrier asserts that a quality/continuity/protocol handshaking issue
on your dedicated circuit is the result of problem within your hardware, there
might be a very quick and easy way to confirm or deny that assertion. You

can try this test only when you have two or more circuits with the carrier
and only one of them is experiencing a problem. In this test, you unplug the
cables that connect the CSUs to the NIUs and exchange them, as shown in
Figure 13-7.
After reconnecting the cables to match the diagram, reboot your hardware
and assess the situation. If the problem ends up following the circuit from
your carrier, and the multiplexer that was working fine is now failing or expe-
riencing the issue, it’s obvious that your carrier is the source of the problem.
If the outage remains within the same multiplexer or CSU that was failing on
the other circuit, you have a problem with your hardware. 
This test is valid only when:
 Both circuits are configured exactly the same: Line coding/framing, out-
pulse signal/start
 Both circuits are on the same carrier (both the same long-distance car-
rier and the same local loop provider)
 Both multiplexers are the same make and model
 Both multiplexers are configured exactly the same (trunk groups, timer
settings, and all the hardware specific settings)
If any of these conditions aren’t met, the validity of this test disintegrates
instantly. There are too many variations between carriers, configuration, and
hardware manufacturers to say with conviction that if one set of your hard-
ware works on a carrier, a different set should work as well.

Validating the Circuit You Are Testing
Incredible, but true! People have tested for hours on a circuit, with conflicting
information coming from both the hardware vendor and the carrier, only to
eventually find out each test performed was on a different circuit. 
If your carrier sees the circuit up and you see it down, you may not be look-
ing at the same circuit. If your carrier takes down the circuit, but you still see
it running and passing calls, you definitely aren’t looking at the same circuit.
Having multiple carriers with several DS-1s per carrier might be great for
your least-cost routing, but all those DS-1s can add a degree of confusion
when you try to troubleshoot a single circuit.
Identifying a circuit is sometimes tough because you can make mistakes any-
where from the CFA point to the point the circuit enters your hardware.
Confirm the circuit IDs assigned by both your long-distance carrier and the
local loop provider. Then perform the following steps:
1. Unplug your hardware from the T-1 jack or reboot your CSU. 
Your carrier should see the circuit drop, bounce, or reset. If the carrier
sees nothing happen on its end, the carrier needs to begin looking at the
other circuits you have on its network. Perform the same test until
everyone is sure you’re dealing with the same circuit.
2. Follow the cabling from your multiplexer to the T-1 jack and all the
way to the NIU if you can. 
If nothing else, the circuit ID of the span should be written on the T-1
jack in your phone room. Validate that the circuit ID matches what you
have on file, and then proceed to the NIU for more investigation.
3. Check the NIU to see whether you are connected to the wrong jack. 
If the circuit you are working on was active and passing traffic at one
time, this is probably not the issue, but if this circuit was recently
installed, you may have discovered your problem.
4. Check the circuit IDs listed on the NIU. 
The NIU should list at least the local loop provider’s circuit ID. These
numbers should match the circuit ID listed on your T-1 jack in your
phone room.
5. Check the NIUs for changes when they are looped or sent into failure. 
NIUs have lights on them that identify the disposition of the circuit they
provide. A loopback light (LBK) is illuminated when your carrier is loop-
ing the NIU, and red lights are displayed when your carrier disables your
286
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

circuit. You might need to check all of your NIUs before you find the one
that reflects the work your carrier is doing on it, but this is the most
foolproof method of identifying your circuit.
If your carrier performs all these tests and none of your circuits respond
accordingly, the circuit you are working on either doesn’t belong to that
carrier, or is somehow absent from the carrier’s visible inventory. 
The Basics of Dedicated Toll-Free
Troubleshooting
Before you begin troubleshooting your dedicated toll-free number, you must
determine the extent of the problem. Opening a trouble ticket on your toll-
free number will delay the resolution of your issue if the problem is actually
with your entire circuit and also affects your outbound calling. 
Just as with troubleshooting a switched circuit, it’s always best to open a
trouble ticket with your carrier for the outbound issue instead of taking a toll-
free call that also has the problem and using that as the basis of your report.
If your entire circuit is down, all of your toll-free numbers that terminate into
that circuit will be affected. Check your circuit first, and only after you con-
firm that the problem doesn’t affect your outbound calls should you open the
ticket on your dedicated toll-free number.
The most common problems that plague dedicated toll-free numbers are
routing issues and DNIS configuration issues. These are the only two vari-
ables that really separate dedicated toll-free numbers from dedicated out-
bound calls. They share the same dedicated circuit as your outbound calls
and the same switched network as every other call you make. 
The limited number of variables makes dedicated toll-free numbers relatively
easy to troubleshoot. Quality issues that exist only on dedicated toll-free
numbers are quite rare, because the dedicated circuit and routing they travel
on are shared by outbound calls. The following sections only cover dedicated
toll-free completion issues. 
Step 1: Identifying a provisioning issue
Switched and dedicated toll-free numbers have inherent similarities. Either
variety can die or lose its way during the process of being activated by your
carrier. If a dedicated toll-free number is being migrated from another carrier,
287
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

or is new and is slated to be activated, and the line suddenly fails, your first
call is to the person at your carrier who handles your orders. You need to
speak to this person first to determine whether the toll-free number has fin-
ished the provisioning process and whether the carrier sees it as active. 
There are quite a few situations that can prevent a toll-free number from
being activated. Until the number shows completed in your carrier’s system,
the customer service and troubleshooting people can’t help you. Jump to
Chapter 9 to find out how to resolve activation issues and for more informa-
tion about the pitfalls and timelines for resolving provisioning issues.
Dedicated toll-free numbers must also be programmed in your PBX or phone
system, especially if you use DNIS to route your inbound calls. If you made
any upgrades to your phone system, the programming might have been lost.
Check your phone system and confirm that all the routing is intact there
before opening a ticket with your carrier. You might be able to find and
resolve the problem yourself. 
When you establish that the problem might be a provisioning issue, you need
to contact the provisioner. The provisioner can confirm whether the toll-free
number is still in the provisioning process. If the problem turns out to be a
provisioning issue, you will have to work through the issue with the provi-
sioner’s assistance.
If you can’t get ahold of the provisioner, do leave that person a voicemail
message that explains the situation. Make sure you remember to leave your
contact information. Then open a trouble ticket with the carrier’s customer
care department. You should have your provisioner check into the toll-free
number when he or she picks up the voicemail, because you might save a lot
of time. After you contact the provisioner, head to “Step 2: Redialing your
dedicated toll-free number.”
If your toll-free number had already been activated and was passing traffic
prior to the problem cropping up, you can proceed directly to Step 2, as well.
Step 2: Redialing your dedicated 
toll-free number
All toll-free troubleshooting beings with trying to dial the number again.
There is always the propensity to dial 800 rather than 888 or to transpose
some digits. If your call completes during the second try, ring your number
up again a few more times to make sure everything is fine before you con-
tinue with your day. If your call fails, write down the phone number you
288
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

dialed from, the time you placed the call, and the call treatment you received.
This information becomes your call example to share with your carrier when
you open your trouble ticket. Next, move on to Step 3.
You can’t dial a toll-free number from a dedicated circuit. This means 
that you can’t dial out from your dedicated circuit to your toll-free number.
When you are making test calls to a dedicated toll-free number, use a 
regular switched phone line (a nondedicated line) or a cellphone. 
Step 3: Validating your dedicated RespOrg
There are two key elements involved in routing calls to a toll-free number: the
RespOrg and the carrier receiving the traffic. Unless you have direct access
to the national SMS database (which I cover in detail in Chapter 5), you can’t
confirm any of this information by yourself. Your carrier has access to this
information. You must find out who controls the RespOrg status of your dedi-
cated toll-free number.
If your toll-free number has not finished the provisioning process, you will be
kicked back to the person who enters orders. Luckily, if you already left a
message for your provisioner before you called (see “Step 1: Identifying a pro-
visioning issue,” earlier in this chapter) the carrier is already working on
your issue by the time you call to follow up. 
If your provisioner has already confirmed that the order is complete, don’t 
let the customer service person off the phone! Request a conference call with
the customer service agent and your provisioner so that the issue can be
resolved immediately. It can take hours to get the service side and the provi-
sioning side of a company to view the status of an order from matching per-
spectives. If your provisioner is unavailable and the problem is an emergency,
ask the customer service rep to conference in the manager of provisioning.
Don’t be afraid to escalate the issue. As long as your issue is an emergency,
nobody should fault you for pushing up the chain of command.
If your number was working fine yesterday, it might have been migrated or
NASCed away. In either case, the RespOrg of your number may be some other
carrier with which you don’t have service. If the RespOrg of your number
belongs to your carrier, proceed to “Step 4: Validating the DNIS configura-
tion.” If the customer service rep at your carrier doesn’t recognize the com-
pany in RespOrg control of your toll-free number, you need to begin steps to
reclaim your number. Your customer service representative should be able to
tell you the following information about the company that has your toll-free
number:
289
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

 The company’s RespOrg ID code
 The company’s contact phone number for reporting trouble
This is all you need to begin your work. Your carrier can’t or won’t do much
in this instance without your direction. You need to call the other carrier and
require it to identify why and how it received the RespOrg for your toll-free
number. When you have that information, you can either leverage your posi-
tion against the carrier if it NASCed or migrated the number in error, or plead
for compassion if your carrier somehow released the number.
If your carrier released the number to the other carrier directly, or released it
into the pool of nationally available toll-free numbers, you are between a rock
and a hard place. Legally, the number belongs to the new carrier. The source
of your problem is with your old carrier, which released the number. Taking
legal action against your old carrier might make you feel good, but it does
nothing to get your toll-free number back. You’ll have better luck pleading
your case to the new carrier. Let the new carrier know about all the wrong-
number calls it is going to receive for the next six months because your cus-
tomers will continue to call. And don’t be too proud to beg.
Step 4: Validating the DNIS configuration
Most dedicated toll-free numbers are ordered with specific DNIS digits that
are sent during the call setup portion of the call. The stream of information in
which the DNIS is sent also includes the caller ID (what your carrier refers to
as ANI delivery) and possibly a two-digit code that identifies the type of
phone that initiated the toll-free call (such as a pay phone or prison phone),
called ANI Infodigits. If you have questions on what DNIS is, browse Chapter 5.
If you want to know more about how DNIS is ordered or provided, stroll to
Chapter 9.
Provide the exact DNIS setup to your customer service rep for validation. If
your toll-free number is 1-800-555-1234 and you ordered ANI delivery with a
four-digit DNIS that matches the last four digits of the phone number, tell the
agent that 800-555-1234 should have ANI delivery provided, and that the DNIS
is 1234. The agent should be able to tell you whether ANI delivery is being
sent, as well as the specific digits of the DNIS. 
Dealing with DNIS digits that don’t match your toll-free number
If your toll-free number was working fine yesterday, and suddenly the DNIS
configuration has changed, your carrier should be able to fix it quickly. The
carrier might have upgraded a switch and some of the programming might
have been lost. Depending on how your carrier is set up, the customer service
290
Part IV: Taking Care of Your Telecom System 

rep might be able to change the DNIS back and resolve your issue in moments.
Otherwise, the rep may have to open a trouble ticket (curses!) and a techni-
cian will resolve the issue in due time. If the rep has to open a trouble ticket,
take down the ticket number and follow up every hour or two until it’s
resolved.
Dealing with the situation if the DNIS digits do match
If the DNIS digits are correct, you need to press forward with a trouble ticket.
Write down that trouble ticket number. Now you will have to wait for a techni-
cian to call you back before you can begin head-to-head testing in “Step 5:
Head-to-head dedicated toll-free testing.” 
Using the old stare-and-compare method
If you have several dedicated toll-free numbers that are working fine and one
that is failing, inform your carrier of this information and give the representa-
tive one of the working toll-free numbers to use as a template. If any change
was made in the setup of your other toll-free number, it will be immediately
obvious after the carrier compares the routing and configuration of the two
numbers. Any variation in the setup of the two numbers is most likely the
source of the completion problem. 
This comparison works even better if you have another toll-free number that
shares the same DNIS digits. If you have three toll-free numbers with the last
four digits of 9876, all sending DNIS 9876, yet one of them is failing, a quick
comparison with one of the functional toll-free numbers should quickly iden-
tify the problem.
Step 5: Head-to-head dedicated 
toll-free testing
Head-to-head testing on dedicated toll-free numbers is less painful than intru-
sive testing on a dedicated circuit. The process doesn’t take down your dedi-
cated circuit or affect your other service in any way. Your carrier can set up a
test toll-free number in order to view and manipulate the DNIS stream, as well
as to identify the responses from your hardware. After you get to the point 
of head-to-head testing on a dedicated toll-free number, your issue is as good
as fixed.
Having your hardware vendor on-site or available during the head-to-head
testing with your carrier can expedite the resolution. Your carrier can view
and manipulate the call it’s sending you, having someone with more experi-
ence around to identify what you are seeing can be infinitely useful.
291
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Dedicated Circuits

Handling Dedicated Toll-Free 
Quality Issues
Static, echo, and low volume are examples of quality issues that sometimes
occur on dedicated toll-free numbers; these issues aren’t related to the dedi-
cated circuit. Try to duplicate any of these issues on outbound dedicated
calls to the same phone numbers that are trying to call your toll-free number. 
I recommend trying the calls over a switched phone line to make the test
even more effective and to help focus your carrier’s repair efforts. 
Generally, you can duplicate these quality issues and divert attention from
both your circuit and your toll-free numbers, but sometimes this isn’t an
option. Say a carrier routes a dedicated toll-free call through one section of
its network to arrive at the dedicated circuit without ever touching another
end of the network. Conversely, a return call from the destination phone
number to the originating dedicated toll-free phone number might take a
totally different route back. For example, if you’re calling from Charlotte,
North Carolina, to a dedicated toll-free number in San Francisco, California,
your call may be sent through the northern section of your carrier’s network,
running through Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington, before hitting the
dedicated circuit in San Francisco.
This is in contrast with the route assigned through the southern portion of
the network. A call from a switched phone line at your office in San Francisco
back to Charlotte would run through Phoenix, Arizona; Dallas, Texas; and
Miami, Florida, before hitting the network in Charlotte. Because these two
calls don’t share any similar routes, you can’t replicate a problem on your
toll-free number with an outbound call. In these rare instances, you need to
push forward with resolution on your toll-free issues just as if they were
switched quality issues. That means logging in all the affected and unaffected
call examples you can lay your hands on, and relaying the information to
your carrier. When the carrier has all the information, you simply have to
wait and let the carrier do the job. If you become too frustrated, my only
word of advice is to escalate the issue.

the technology, and also gives you a sense of the types of
charges you can expect to pay. Chapter 15 introduces you

elaying information is the basis of all business. You have to manage
your inventory coming and going, your cash flow, and all the fine details
to prevent vital information from falling through the cracks. Fifty years ago,
most information was passed along over a phone conversation or sent as a
handwritten ledger through the U.S. postal service. At that time, high-speed
data transfer would have meant sending mimeographed (or carbon-paper)
copies of spreadsheets across town with your accountant. 
Every company has data it needs to send within its company. The Internet
offers more options for data transfer and greater access to information for
customers and vendors. You can now make data downloadable in a PDF doc-
ument, create interactive customer Web sites, and transfer large files quickly
by using FTP sites. Of course, whenever data is being transferred, security is
a huge priority and should always be factored into your data decisions.
This chapter covers the main forms of data transfer you will encounter, from
modems to private lines, frame relay to MPLS. As you go through the options,
you discover how each type of data transfer has its niche.

Understanding Your Data 
Transfer Requirements
You must ask yourself three important questions when you look at your data
requirements are:
 How much data do you need to send and how quickly do you need it?
Your answer to this question will frame the parameters of the next two
questions. Say, for example, you have an inventory system containing 10
million items that are housed in 3 different warehouses and are sold
from 500 retail stores across the globe. You might need an accurate list-
ing of the entire inventory available to every one of your retail stores, in
real time. On the other hand, you might only send one large accounting
file to your main office once a week. The amount of data you need to
send shapes your choices for how you will send it.
 How many locations are involved in your data transfer? As the
number of sites you need to share data with increases, so do your
options. You can easily and cost effectively send data between two loca-
tions, but the methods you might use in such a scenario become prohib-
itive if you have more than three locations. The number of locations
involved, in addition to the quantity of data you need to send, deter-
mines your exact data requirements. 
When you answer this question, think not just of your business’s current
situation, but also of where your business is heading. If, for example,
your business is a mid-size regional company with plans to expand, your
data transfer plan must have room to grow.
 How much are you willing to pay to make this happen? You can pay as
much or as little as you want to transfer your data. Overbudgeting your
data transfer network might make everything move very quickly, but it
can also be very expensive. Telecom salespeople who aren’t familiar
with data applications often quote a wide range of capacity options,
hoping to offer one that fits your budget. The problem with this
approach is that you can easily end up buying too little bandwidth,
simply based on the price. The more money you pay, the more band-
width you should get. But, do you need all that bandwidth?
Transmitting Data the 
Old-Fashioned Way
Most data is transmitted by simply attaching a document to an e-mail mes-
sage and clicking the Send button. About 20 years ago, the same transfer
296
Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 

might have been made using a direct connection into the office server and
sent via modem. Modems do transmit and at very slow speeds when com-
pared to other forms of data transfer, but still exist today and are best used in
two niche markets: 
 Administration applications: Phone systems and local area networks
aren’t infallible. If your LAN is failing, you might not be able to access
your data. However, a technician can still dial into the router with a
modem and troubleshoot the system. The same scenario goes for dialing
into a PBX or channel bank for troubleshooting. As long as you are dial-
ing from your computer directly into your server or PBX, you have a
secure connection for as long as you need it.
 Older systems that require modem transfers: Not everyone has jumped
on the DSL, or cable modem, or T-1 bandwagon for their Internet con-
nection, and some large software systems were designed to use modems
to transfer data (such as many HR programs). In spite of the speed at
which technology advances, many systems and people have not
upgraded to faster connections. 
Aside from these two niche applications, there is little reason to use dialup
modems to transfer your data unless you like waiting.
Processing Constant Transmissions
between Locations
Setting up a private line, sometimes called a leased line, means actually rent-
ing the copper wire that connects two offices. If you use a long-distance modem
connection for eight hours a day, five days a week, in order to access some
information, it might be more cost-effective to simply rent the wire in between
the offices instead of paying the per-minute charge for modem transfers.
Businesses haven’t been dialing up with modems to transfer large amounts of
data for a while, so the primary use of leased lines today is to act as an exten-
sion of your local area network (LAN). You can order a private line as large as
you want, from a T-1 line capable of passing 1.54 Mbps (megabits per second);
you can also order a DS-3 line, which can pass 45 Mbps, or an OC-3 line, which
passes 155 Mbps. When you have the private line built, it is little more than a
large empty pipe. This fact gives you a couple of areas of flexibility:
 You can transmit any kind of data you want. A private line gives you a
link between two locations that can be used for anything from voice
phone calls to videoconferencing and data transfers.
 You can transmit data in whatever method that works for your network.
You can transmit voice calls via normal TDM (time division multiplexing)
technology, or maybe you want to use Voice over IP (VoIP) technology.
297
Chapter 14: Transferring Data, Not Just Voice Content

When you order your private line, your carrier will identify each end of the
circuit as either the A location or the Z location.
Private line pricing
Private line pricing increases as the distance between the two offices
increases. The size of the private line you request also determines pricing.
The price you receive for a private line includes the cost for local loops from
both ends to the nearest Point of Presence (POP) for your long distance car-
rier and the long-haul mileage between the POPs. 
The long-haul cost is generally based on a specific charge per mile per DS0. If
you have a 100-mile long haul for a T-1 circuit where the per-mile charge was
$0.20, you would expect this section of your circuit to cost $480.00 (0.20 x 24
channels in a T-1 x 100 miles). If the circuit was a DS-3 rather than a T-1 the
long-haul portion alone would be $13,440.00.
Figure 14-1 shows how a private line is built with two local loops that span
from the long-distance POP to the end locations, with the long-haul mileage in
the center. Because private line quotes only list two items, the installation fee
and the monthly charge, you won’t know how these totals are derived. If the
quote is excessively high, ask for quotes from other carriers. The local loop
fees vary from one carrier to another depending upon where their POPs are
located in relation to your office. The difference in this one element alone
could save you hundreds of dollars a month.

Private lines are a low-profit item for most carriers, so they often encourage
you to sign a longer contract by reducing the cost as the terms increase. The
difference between a 12- and a 36-month contract might be substantial, but
remember that you are on the hook for 2 more years than you might want to
be. The one guarantee I give you about telecom is that it’s always changing.
Any contract longer than 12 months might prevent you from upgrading to a
newer, better, less expensive alternative.
Drawbacks of private lines
The downside of private lines is their cost, and the fact that each private line
can connect only two sites. The farther a private line stretches, the more it
costs per month. A T-1 private line from Los Angeles to New York may cost
$6,000 per month, and if you don’t use it very often, it may not be worth the
monthly payment. Nowadays, businesses can send data in e-mails or across
the Internet. If you deem the level of security on the Internet acceptable for
your purposes, private lines might not be such a great deal.
The other problem with private lines occurs if you want to connect more
than two locations. You can connect more than two locations with private
lines, but this setup is anything but cost-effective. Figure 14-2 shows what it
would take to tie together offices in Seattle, Washington; San Diego, California;
Miami, Florida; and Boston, Massachusetts. Each line that spans from one
POP to another is a private line, with a total of six lines required to provide
complete redundancy. This type of setup is geared for security and invariably
builds a network with too much capacity, and a monthly cost that could
easily top $50,000. Yikes!

Chapter 14: Transferring Data, Not Just Voice Content

Understanding a Frame Relay Network
Frame relay is the next generation of data transfer solutions, and it was cre-
ated to replace private line networks that used to crisscross the nation, cost-
ing businesses too much money. Sometimes private lines are installed for
redundancy, but they are rarely used to their full potential because they exist
only as a safety net if another connection fails.
Frame relay takes information from the office, stuffs it in a nice little package,
places a destination and return address on it, and sends it on its way along
with all the other packages the carrier is processing. Figure 14-3 shows a typi-
cal, fully redundant setup for a frame relay network with four nodes (individ-
ual locations on the frame relay network).
Frame relay is a logical transition if you currently connect multiple offices
with private lines. It is also an option if you’re looking for a more secure way
to transmit data to many offices, because frame relay is more secure than the
public Internet. 
Drawbacks of frame relay networks
One of the drawbacks of frame relay is that you must order dedicated circuits
to connect each of your offices to your carrier’s frame relay network. These
dedicated circuits are shown as the triple lines in Figure 14-3, connecting
each location to a POP; they typically cost between $200 and $800 each for a
T-1 connection.
Frame relay technology was a great step forward when compared to private
lines. However, the cost of PVCs (permanent virtual circuits), and the limited
number of PVCs available, are issues that you can’t ignore. For more informa-
tion about PVCs (which are represented in Figure 14-3 with dashed lines),
check out the following section, “Frame relay element #3: The permanent vir-
tual circuit, or PVC.”
In addition to the PVC problem, frame relay networks are unable to route
calls around problem areas or prioritize them. These issues in particular
have spawned a new technology called Multi-Protocol Label Switching, or
MPLS. MPLS was designed to overcome the limitations of frame relay. For
more information about MPLS, see the section, later in this chapter, called
“New and Improved Transmission for Multiple Locations.”

Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 

The frame relay cloud in the center of Figure 14-3 makes setting up data trans-
fer between four distant locations more cost-effective than the same setup
with private lines. As you see, all the lines within the cloud are dashed, indi-
cating that the path your data travels isn’t a dedicated span that only you
alone can use, but is instead a virtual path between two points that many
customers share.
Frame relay has three main pieces that allow it to work, and each one is gen-
erally listed as a separate line item when you receive a quote for the service
from your carrier. These three charges apply to every site connected to the
frame relay network, and if any are missing when you receive your quote, you
should confirm that the locations are available through your carrier. 
You need to have some hardware if you’re going to have a frame relay net-
work. The following sections list all the elements you need to order. The ele-
ments are available in a variety of sizes to fit your exact requirements.
Frame relay element #1: The local loop
Just like the long-distance circuit needed for voice calls, you have to order a
local loop to connect the router at your office to your carrier’s frame relay

network. You can order a local loop only in standard dedicated loop incre-
ments: 64 kbps, full T-1, or full DS-3. Even if you only need 256 or 512 kbps,
you still have to order a full T-1 for your local loop. Your carrier might tell
you that it can provide a fractional T-1 (a portion of a full T-1) local loop, but
it will still charge you for the full bandwidth.
The cost of the frame relay local loop might be more than a local loop used
for a voice circuit, because your carrier has to receive the circuit in at a certain
place in the network where the carrier has access to the frame relay network.
Not every voice POP your carrier has can access the frame relay network.
Frame relay element #2: 
The frame relay port
The frame relay port is where your local loop terminates at the entrance
portal to your carrier’s frame relay network. The port can vary in size, based
on 64 kbps increments (just like the DS-0 channels on a T-1), depending on
how much bandwidth you need. This means that you can order a 256 kbps
port, but not a 220 kbps port.
Frame relay element #3: The permanent
virtual circuit, or PVC
The permanent virtual circuit, or PVC, is the dashed line within the frame relay
cloud that allows your data to travel from one frame relay node to another.
Your data doesn’t have exclusive rights to the path it takes between the nodes
as it does in a private line. Your data is instead packaged into a frame, num-
bered sequentially based on how it was made, and labeled with a destination
address in the header before it’s sent off into the frame cloud. When it’s in the
frame relay network, your data is routed along to the required destination at
the other end of your PVC.
You can purchase the PVC, just like the port and the local loop, in varying
sizes, depending on your requirements. Just like the frame relay port, you
can request the PVC in any standard telecom size in increments of 64 kbps
(sometimes even in 56 kbps increments).
PVCs are identified within the frame relay network by data-link connection
identifiers (DLCIs), which the frame relay provider assigns to each end of the
PVC. These DLCI numbers exist in a limited range from roughly 16 to 991 (the
available range of numbers has changed over time) and are only recognized
302
Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 

within the frame relay network. This limitation was overcome by an enhance-
ment including Local Management Interface (LMI) functionality, thus allowing
additional nodes to be attributed to a single DLCI known within the frame
relay network.
When you order a PVC, you are rarely given all the bandwidth you ordered.
When you order a 256 kbps PVC, for example, you might be guaranteed only 
a portion of that bandwidth. Figure 14-4 gives you a good idea of how a PVC 
is partitioned:
Understanding your virtual 
circuit’s bandwidth needs
Your frame relay network’s permanent virtual circuit (PVC) is actually com-
posed of several layers of bandwidth that you don’t have complete and con-
stant access to. The percentages of your total PVC that make up each layer
are sometimes set by your carrier, or you might be able to adjust the percent-
ages by paying more money for larger sections of guaranteed bandwidth. The
following sections identify your options.
Committed information rate: CIR
The committed information rate, or CIR, is the most important part of your PVC.
This is the amount of bandwidth you have guaranteed access to at all times. 
CIR sizes vary by carrier. Every carrier has a different policy on how it
assigns the CIR for its PVCs. Some carriers give you a CIR that is equal to the
size of the PVC you have ordered, and some guarantee you only a quarter of
the PVC bandwidth for your CIR. You might be able to pay more for a higher
level of CIR, so check with your carrier if necessary. As a standard rule, request
at least 50 percent of the total bandwidth of your PVC to be designated as
The final 64kbps is listed as your Excess Burst Size, or Be.
512 kbps PVC
An additional 192kbps is listed as your Committed Burst Rate, or Bc.
256kbps is listed as your Committed Information Rate, or CIR.

303
Chapter 14: Transferring Data, Not Just Voice Content

CIR; you don’t want to lose data because you are using too much of your
bursting bandwidth.
Committed burst rate: Bc
The committed burst rate is the additional bandwidth your carrier guarantees
you can burst to for short duration use. The carrier generally doesn’t tell you
how long you can burst and use this bandwidth; it only tells you that it’s for
bursting. This bandwidth is used during your peak times when you are send-
ing or receiving large quantities of data, but isn’t the average bandwidth used
during normal business hours. This extra burst of bandwidth is for instances
such as sending your weekly database file to the accounting office. It isn’t the
typical transmission level you work at on a day-to-day basis, but once a week
you may need the extra room.
Excess Burst Size: Be
The excess burst size is the additional bandwidth that you can use, as long as
nobody else is using it. Imagine that two PVCs built next to each other are
five lanes of a highway, with two lanes devoted to traffic in each direction and
the shared center lane to be used for passing. The center lane is your Be
bandwidth. 
Be is room that you can use, as long as nobody (that is, no data) is coming in
the opposite direction. The router sending packets into the PVC from your
side can monitor traffic it is sending, but can’t anticipate whether another
router in the frame relay network is sending any large files back over the PVC.
If you have two packets of data come into contact in the Be bandwidth sec-
tion of the PVC, both frames of data are blown away and sent into the bit
bucket. Luckily, the data is automatically sent again, so you don’t really lose
that much.
New and Improved Transmission 
for Multiple Locations
Multi-Protocol Label Switching, or MPLS, is a technology designed to overcome
the limitations of frame relay technology. To fully understand MPLS, you must
understand a tiny bit about networking standards. The seven layer Open
System Interconnection Reference Model (OSI model) is the networking stan-
dard that network engineers conform to when building networks. This model
creates a unique division of labor both within and between each of the seven
layers. Our discussion of MPLS only concerns the first three layers of the OSI
model, sometimes called the lower layers. The upper layers of the OSI model
304
Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 

aren’t covered in this book. If you’re interested in knowing how networks
work, check out Networking For Dummies, 7th Edition, by Doug Lowe (Wiley).
The seven layers of the OSI model are numbered from bottom to top, so the
lower layers are labeled like this:
 Layer 1: Physical Layer: This is the physical medium used to transmit
data across the network. Literally, it’s the cable through which data
moves; it could be made of Cat 5 (Ethernet) cable, coaxial (coax) cable,
twisted-pair shielded copper wire, or fiberoptic cable.
 Layer 2: Data Link Layer: This is the lowest layer at which software pro-
tocols work. The protocols that operate at this level include Ethernet,
frame relay, and ATM (which is kind of like frame relay — on steroids).
These protocols have relatively simple live data transfer schemes. Data
packets are sent through the network on predetermined routes from one
end of the network to the other. Because these paths are predetermined,
the hardware doesn’t have to decide the best path; data that is sent to a
specific DLCI on a frame connection can only be sent to the part of the
PVC to which the DLCI is assigned.
 Layer 3: Network Layer: The hardware at this level is more intelligent
and is where MPLS shines. MPLS enables carriers to create virtual pri-
vate networks (VPNs) similar to the frame relay networks of old. The
increased sophistication of this technology allows it much greater func-
tionality, and gives the network more resilience as it interacts at the
Layer 2 and Layer 3 level for specific tasks. 
Understanding why smarter is better
MPLS enables all the benefits of Layer 3 routing with the speed and security
of Layer 2 switching. The flexibility of MPLS allows it to interact with and
easily route data processed via Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols. 
The main benefit of having the Layer 2 protocols available with MPLS is that
you can keep your existing equipment, which uses old protocols and trans-
ports data between sites with some of the more advanced routing capability
available only via Internet Protocol. An MPLS VPN allows you to connect your
company’s old frame relay switches together or use Ethernet to tie your new
corporate e-mail server to T-1s at your remote office locations. The packets
in your MPLS VPN can also be prioritized so that your VoIP packets are
routed before the accounting file being sent to your boss. This capability to
avoid congestion and prioritize the different forms of data you are transmit-
ting, while still maintaining a high degree of security, makes MPLS a very
attractive data transfer method.
305
Chapter 14: Transferring Data, Not Just Voice Content

Figure 14-5 shows a standard setup of an MPLS network. Although MPLS
VPNs are different than basic IP, ATM, and frame relay networks, as a cus-
tomer, you don’t need to deal with those issues. Your IT department can con-
tinue to refer to the different sites on your network via IP addresses if your
organization had a standard IP network before. MPLS gives you the benefit of
IP with the comfort of the network your IT department is used to. The inter-
esting aspect to note is that there are no preset routes between any of the
endpoints. Because MPLS functions at a network level, the routers within
your carrier’s network can receive data packets and direct those packets
along dynamic paths to their final destinations.
The components that make up an MPLS network are similar to the pieces that
make up a frame relay network. 
Label Edge Router: LER
The Label Edge Router, or LER, is an important piece of hardware generally
provided by your carrier, and is necessary to establish an MPLS network. The
LER typically sits on the edge of your carrier’s network. Your router is con-
nected to the local loop that connects to the LER at your carrier. The main job
of the LER is to assign a label to every packet of data sent through the MPLS
network. This label determines the packet’s routing process and priority.
The following sections explain the materials you need to have in place to get
your MPLS configuration off the ground.

The local loop
Just like any dedicated service, you need to rent the copper wires or fiberop-
tic cable (depending on the size of circuit you require) from your office to the
nearest MPLS entry point for your carrier. The local loop’s cost is similar to
that of a voice circuit of the same bandwidth, with the price increasing as the
distance grows.
The MPLS port 
Your carrier’s Label Edge Router (LER) sits on the other side of your local
loop to receive your data. As the carrier’s LER receives each packet, it reads
its label and routes it accordingly. You have to pay for a port into the carrier’s
LER based on your required bandwidth. 
Bandwidth
The last item you have to pay your MPLS carrier for is the bandwidth
required to send data. Carriers charge for bandwidth in a variety of ways, so
speak to your carrier to decide what is the best billing choice for your spe-
cific application.

oice over Internet Protocol, more commonly referred to as VoIP, is the
hottest buzzword in telecom today. The downside of being on the cut-
ting edge, however, is that VoIP is still finding its place in the world. VoIP
technology has to be built into the infrastructure, and that takes money and
long-term planning. In many ways, the world just isn’t ready for VoIP, because
it creates new problems even though it successfully solves older ones.
This chapter covers the general environment of VoIP, its structures and
requirements. Figuring out how to program your Cisco router to convert VoIP
to Feature Group D protocol is not covered (so it’s cool if you don’t know
what I just said right there), but you do discover VoIP’s greatest strength —
its flexibility. The possible applications of VoIP are rapidly growing. The tech-
nology is used with everything from interactive Web sites to find-me-follow-me
phone services that allow one call to attempt to reach you at several phone
numbers before it is finally sent to voicemail. The ability to reinvite calls to
new destinations: your cellphone, your office number, your home phone
number, is one of the great benefits of VoIP, along with the limited govern-
ment regulation and taxing at this time.
If you want a more in-depth look at VoIP that’s written for real people, check
out VoIP For Dummies by Timothy V. Kelly (Wiley). 

Understanding VoIP Basics
At its most basic level, VoIP is a technology that allows you to place a voice
phone call over an Internet connection. It uses an Internet connection to pass
voice data, using the Internet Protocol (IP) rather than using POTS (plain old
telephone service). 
VoIP’s applications are endless. Remote employees can work just as if they
were hooked into your telephone system in-house, and because you’re using
your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to make VoIP calls, you’re not getting
charged by your long-distance carrier. Even though high-end VoIP setups cost
a bundle to install, the technology ultimately keeps corporate telephone
costs low, as long as your network is configured just right. 
VoIP technology was initially used by modern-day versions of ham radio
operators and computer geeks, who wanted to make free phone calls with
poor quality over dialup Internet connections (remember dialup?). The
processes and sophistication of VoIP has grown exponentially over the years,
to the point where most long-distance carriers now use VoIP technology to
transfer calls within their own networks, and large businesses are adopting
this newer, higher-quality VoIP for their day-to-day operations.
The VoIP protocol not only converts your words into digital code, but also
puts that code into packets for transmission across an Internet connection
(this process is referred to as packetization). Your call eventually connects to
another VoIP phone, or a piece of hardware called a gateway. At that point,
the call is translated from VoIP to TDM (time division multiplexing protocol),
a standard non-VoIP protocol that you can read more about in Chapter 8.
From there, it’s sent on to the destination phone. Gateways bridge the VoIP
and Non-VoIP worlds together by translating the protocols, allowing your call
to reach your grandma’s rotary-dial phone — which is definitely not using
VoIP.
Figure 15-1 shows how a call originates from your phone as VoIP and is trans-
mitted along your Internet connection until it is converted to TDM with a
VoIP gateway. Your call emerges from the gateway into the Public Switched
Telephone Network, or PSTN, and is routed to the phone you dialed. Read the
figure from right to left, rather than left to right, to see how calls originating
from non-VoIP phones are received with VoIP.

Understanding IP Protocols for VoIP
VoIP protocols come in several flavors, but two of them lead the pack in 
popularity. The H.323 protocol was established by the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU), and is geared for multimedia applications.
The Session Initiation Protocol (more commonly known as SIP) was estab-
lished by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and is quickly growing
as the preferred protocol of choice with many carriers. Both of these proto-
cols are used as a basis for transmitting VoIP calls and use the same coder-
decoders, such as G.711 or G.729, to transmit and receive the calls.
Comparing H.323 and SIP
Despite the fact that its name isn’t very user friendly, H.323 is the incumbent
protocol, gaining initial market share over SIP. In fact, the name isn’t the only
part of the protocol that’s hard to understand. Because H.323 is so complex,
many companies have turned to SIP, which is an easier protocol to administer
and manage. Looking at H.323 against SIP, we see that:

Chapter 15: Riding the Internet Wave: VoIP

 SIP is structurally faster than H.323. It uses less time setting up calls,
requiring only one invite message, versus the eight messages for H.323.
Speed of call setup is an important factor for companies that use VoIP
for telemarketing campaigns. If you place hundreds of thousands of calls
a day, and every call means revenue, every second counts. 
 SIP is made of an easy-to-read text-based protocol. H.323 is based on a
binary software code that is difficult to read and comprehend. The text-
based nature of SIP enables it to be easily dissected and analyzed,
directly as it is transmitted from your server.
If you have a choice when choosing a VoIP setup, then I recommend using SIP
over H.323. The industry is moving away from binary-based codes, so if you
were to use H.323, you might need to upgrade sooner rather than later.
Ethereal is an extremely helpful tool for troubleshooting VoIP issues, allowing
you to see every message sent through the hardware it is installed on. This
information includes the IP addresses being used for transmission, as well as
the call setup and teardown for easy troubleshooting. The software is avail-
able for free at www.ethereal.com.
Understanding the structure of a VoIP call
Every VoIP call consists of four completely separate data streams, each gov-
erned by the parent protocol, which is generally either H.323 or SIP (see
“Comparing H.323 and SIP”). You have four data streams, established in pairs,
with one pair at each end of the call. 
One transmission set handles the setup, maintenance, and teardown (signal-
ing) of the call, and the other set concerns itself with only the transport of
voice data. Here are the details:
 One pair of data streams handles signaling data to establish, maintain,
and tear down the call. H.245 is the most commonly used protocol for
H.323 and Session Description Protocol (SDP) is the favorite with SIP.
These protocols were designed to negotiate the signaling of a voice call
over VoIP. There are differences in how the signaling is managed in SIP
versus H.323, but by design, they are structured to keep the signaling
removed from the data stream that holds the voice portion of the call.
 The other set of data streams sends the voice data. The Real-Time
Transport Protocol (RTP) is the means by which your voice or video is
sent from the originating phone or videoconferencing system to the
system receiving the call. The signaling stream tells the VoIP equipment
how to package the data and converts it on the far end of the call. RTP is
the carrier pigeon that takes your message along the path determined
by the signaling protocols.
312
Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 

Figure 15-2 shows the four paths taken in a standard VoIP call. If any one of
the connections doesn’t terminate to the correct location, the call is
impaired. Terminating the signaling stream to the wrong IP address on an
unknown router prevents the call from being established, and terminating the
RTP at the wrong location either prevents any sound from being transmitted,
or results in one-way audio.
Figure 15-3 demonstrates the VoIP’s flexibility: When signaling and RTP
streams can operate independently, you have a whole lot of options. In the
figure, one phone (IP Phone A) is calling another phone (IP Phone B). The
RTP stream is being reinvited to the media server that provides voicemail for
IP Phone B. 
The interesting thing about this call is that the media portion of the call (that
is, the voice part) in the RTP stream is being sent to a media server, and the
signaling protocol doesn’t establish a connection between either of the
phones and the media server.

Chapter 15: Riding the Internet Wave: VoIP
Reading in the Ethereal world
Ethereal is a software package that enables
your VoIP switch to capture packets, as long as
the switch is using an OS (operating system)
into which Ethereal can be installed (Ethereal
runs on all popular platforms, including
Windows, Unix, and Linux systems). 
Ethereal only captures packets that flow
through the computer on which it is installed, 
so if you have Ethereal loaded on a server
behind your router, you will only be able to
record packets passed between your router to
your IP phones, and not the packets between
your router and your carrier.

You can configure VoIP protocols to try several different phones (a cellphone,
another office phone, or a home phone). For example, say you decide that
after five rings, if the call isn’t answered, the call is sent to the next phone on
the list. Such features are commonly referred to as reinvite features.
Data signals aren’t sent in constant streams; the signaling protocols instead
tend to transmit information on an as-needed basis. As long as the gateways
at either end of the call function properly, there is no need for the overhead
to baby-sit the call. After the call is established, the signaling handles the
maintenance and housekeeping of the call while it is active, but doesn’t 
transmit nearly as much information as is sent in the RTP stream.

Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 
Don’t go rogue on me
If the SDP portion of the call is incorrect, some-
one may end up sending the RTP stream to an
unknown IP address. A breakaway stream or
rogue RTP is sent to some unlucky IP address
in the world. The constant barrage of data may
not be dangerous to the server receiving the
rogue RTP, but it can be annoying. Performing
interoperability tests with your carrier is crucial
to working out configuration issues that would
otherwise make your calls go to dead air.

Understanding your voice choices
Both H.323 and SIP protocols use the same equipment called codecs (an abbre-
viated name for coder-decoder) to convert your voice into digital code so it
can be transmitted. Codecs are built into Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs),
such as the ones used with Internet VoIP services like Vonage, and in VoIP
gateways your standard phone service may connect to with your VoIP carrier.
Codecs use industry standard methods to convert voice signals into digital
data. Converting your voice to digital code is a delicate process, with three
primary concerns with data transmissions: 
 Compression ratio: This ratio identifies how much a codec can reduce
the volume of data sent to transmit the RTP stream of a VoIP call. The
goal is reducing the amount of bandwidth you use to transmit your VoIP
calls, enabling you to send more calls over the same bandwidth.
 Call quality: Calls can suffer from clipping, jitter, and latency to greater
or lesser degrees, depending on the compression ratio and packetization
process.
 Packetization delay: When a call is converted to or from VoIP, the
process causes a delay. The length of this delay affects call quality.
As you can see, these three elements are inextricably related. All codecs used
affect call quality and generate a packetization delay. As a result, when it
comes to choosing a codec, your options are much limited based on your
bandwidth and call quality requirements. 
After comparing these elements, and looking at all the codecs, a few proto-
cols stand out and are more commonly used than the other by carriers. I dis-
cuss them in the following sections. 
Using uncompressed VoIP with G.711
G.711 is the garden variety, uncompressed protocol for SIP. If you want to
send faxes or have poor line quality on another SIP protocol, G.711 is your
codec of choice. This codec protocol gives you the highest quality and is
most common in the industry.
This codec is the easiest to use, as the software is widely available on the
Internet for free and all carriers support it.
G.711 comes in both a domestic U.S. version and a European version. The differ-
ence between the versions is minimal, but they’re different enough to prevent
them from working together efficiently. The version use in the U.S. and Japan is
called G.711µ (referred to as G.711 mu-law, or sometimes called u-law) and the
European version, which is called G.711a (often referred to as G.711 a-law).
315
Chapter 15: Riding the Internet Wave: VoIP

The greatest drawback to this codec is the fact that, because the data isn’t
compressed, it uses up more bandwidth to transmit one voice call than you
would use if you sent it out using the traditional Time Division Multiplexing
(TDM) protocol. A non-VoIP call uses 64 kbps to transmit a single conversa-
tion, where the G.711 codec uses about 84 kbps. If you use this codec, your 
T-1 line, which in a non-VoIP scenario could handle 24 consecutive calls, is
maxed out at about 18 consecutive calls. Is this the price you pay for quality?
Maybe the benefits of VoIP outweigh the need for extra bandwidth, but you
should definitely bear this issue in mind.
Compressed VoIP with G.729
VoIP with the G.729 is a 5:1 compression codec that allows VoIP to shine. It
takes the 84 kbps required to handle a call with G.711 and reduces it down to
only 20 kbps. In spite of the fact that the signaling portion of the call is not
compressed, the voice portion is actually compressed to a ratio of 8:1. You
can make almost 77 calls on the same T-1 of bandwidth where you were
restricted to 18 with the uncompressed codec.
Faxes don’t work when sent over the G.729. The codec was designed to 
compress the audio portion for voice calls by removing the inaudible tones.
Unfortunately, inaudible tones are what make fax machines work. The tones
are used to transmit data over the wires. If the inaudible tones aren’t trans-
mitted, faxes are doomed to failure on this codec. Don’t fear; if you need to
send compressed faxes, the next codec is for you.
Compressing your fax calls
The T.38 codec was built to resolve the faxing problem found on G.729. The
T.38 Fax over IP (FoIP) protocol (oh, yes, there’s a cute acronym for every-
thing these days) doesn’t actually compress the audio at all. Instead it con-
verts the fax to a tagged image file format (TIFF) image and sends it, along
with its own description information. The transmission is less likely to fail
because the data can be re-sent if it gets lost. There may be provisions to
duplicate the information if you want to add a second layer of protection to
the transmission. 
The only shortcoming of this codec is that it’s pretty new. Not all carriers are
updated with it yet, so you may have to wait until it is provided. Until then,
you can always mix and match your codecs, sending faxes over G.711 and
using G.729 for voice calls only.
Ordering VoIP Service
When you order VoIP service for a business, you need to meet certain hardware
requirements, and the testing requirements for your VoIP system are similar to a
TDM voice installation. The residential VoIP offerings, on the other hand, are
316
Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 

designed to be as simple as possible, and they include plug-and-play hardware
and software installations. The basic hardware and service requirements for all
VoIP applications (whether for business or home use) are the same:
 You must have a dedicated Internet connection.
 You must have a VoIP phone system, or an adapter that can translate the
VoIP protocol to a protocol that your existing phone system can use. 
Larger applications for big businesses with hundreds of employees may
include data integration, videoconferencing, and Web conferencing — all on
the same Internet line. Of course, having these additional perks requires
more Internet bandwidth and more complex hardware to manage all the indi-
vidual pieces of the network. 
If you want to use VoIP technology on a small scale (for home use), you may
need to purchase an inexpensive VoIP adapter (it is actually a small VoIP-to-
TDM gateway) and a DSL or digital cable Internet connection. You can spend
as much, or as little, money as you want on your VoIP hardware. 
The key element to keep in mind is that generally the more complex your hard-
ware, the more features available to you. But also remember that with great
power comes great responsibility, and more advanced hardware also places a
greater burden on you for troubleshooting any issue you may encounter. 
Choosing your VoIP hardware
The hardware you need to buy for VoIP service depends on the complexity of
the VoIP network you create. If you have one phone, you need a single piece
317
Chapter 15: Riding the Internet Wave: VoIP
Capacity concerns are based on concurrent calls
VoIP is a very fluid and unstructured protocol
when it comes to bandwidth consumption.
When speaking about everyday TDM voice cir-
cuits, your biggest concern has to do with how
many minutes you plan to talk. With VoIP, the
question is more frequently about the number of
concurrent calls your system can accept. 
The TDM world is very structured; no matter
what you do, a normal voice T-1 line can only
handle a maximum of 24 phone calls at any one
time. VoIP is a completely different animal, and
depending on your codec, you may be limited to
a few as 15, or as many as 76 calls on the same
T-1 of bandwidth. Your carrier will assign ports
based on your needs. Telling your VoIP carrier
that you want to talk 100,000 minutes a month (as
you would with a TDM order) means nothing for
provisioning, but it may influence the per-minute
rate the carrier offers you. With VoIP it’s con-
ceivable (if unlikely in most situations) that you
could make 100,000 minutes of calls within a time
frame of 2 hours a day, over two T-1s using G.729.

of hardware. More likely, however, you want a complex network of voicemail
servers, additional end users, and a host of advanced features. If so, you need
a small squad of hardware to take care of all your requirements. 
Speak to your hardware vendor for assistance on setting up these more com-
plex systems, or for a referral to a business that specializes in VoIP technol-
ogy and hardware if your vendor isn’t familiar with the technology.
Here’s a list of hardware you can expect to purchase:
 An Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA): An ATA is the most basic level of
hardware required for home applications and is installed between the
wall jack for your dedicated Internet connection and your regular tele-
phone. ATAs convert the VoIP signal coming from your Internet connec-
tion into a signal your phone can use. After an ATA is in place, you dial
out and receive calls just as you did before you had VoIP. An ATA is a
common piece of hardware for home use; you will probably need some-
thing more complex for a business application with more features.
 A softphone: A softphone is a software program for your computer that
enables it to function like a phone. Softphones usually look like the
keypad for a cellphone and use the speakers and a microphone on your
computer to transmit and receive your conversation. I have used a few
of the softphones available, and I don’t think the quality is wonderful.
Usually, the biggest limitation to quality is the fact that if the speakers
and microphone for your computer are crummy, so is your VoIP conver-
sation. If you have a great computer and are comfortable with using your
computer to make calls, a softphone may be your phone of choice.
 A gateway: A gateway is a device that converts VoIP to TDM and TDM to
VoIP. If you are deploying VoIP service and have any non-VoIP phones
that need to use the service, you need a gateway.
 An Edge Proxy Server (EPS): An EPS is the first piece of hardware a
VoIP call comes into contact with on your network; it’s used for larger
VoIP applications. This server receives and routes the signaling and may
also route the RTP. Because the RTP and signaling are separate, the RTP
could be directed to another piece of hardware for voicemail, music on
hold, or handling by an automatic call distribution (ACD) program that
prompts you to “Press 1 for Sales, press 2 for Customer Service . . .”, 
and so on.
 A media server: Media servers are computer servers that receive and
process the RTP stream in a VoIP call. The media server may be a part of
the EPS, or it may be a completely separate device. 
318

Conserving bandwidth by controlling 
the RTP stream
The largest consumption of bandwidth on a VoIP call is the RTP stream,
because it has to house and transport 64 kbps of voice communication. The
signaling is very small in comparison and is the only real part of a VoIP call
that must be handled by the EPS. Figure 15-4 shows the bandwidth require-
ments for a VoIP call where the RTP is transmitted through the EPS. 
As you can see, both the 64 kbps RTP stream and the smaller overhead stream
are handled by your EPS. If the IP phone you are transferring the call to is not
part of your local area network (LAN), the call is sent back to your IP connec-
tion, and the RTP alone ends up using at least 128 kbps — for just one call.

Getting more information on VoIP protocols
I understand that VoIP isn’t for the faint of heart.
There’s a lot to know before you make a commit-
ment to tying your phone service to your Internet
connection. Perhaps because VoIP is so tied to
the Internet, I thought it might be good to give you
some Internet-based resources to answer your
questions. In addition to picking up a copy of
VoIP For Dummies, by Timothy V. Kelly (Wiley),
you can also find more information online:
 A good Web site for information about VoIP
protocols, H.323, and SIP is www2.rad.
com/networks/2001/voip/
prtcls.htm.
 If you’re looking for a good Web site with
information to answer your RTP-related
questions, visit www.cs.columbia.
edu/~hgs/rtp/faq.html.

Passing the Interoperability test
After you order an Internet connection and purchase the required hardware,
you may still have to pass an interoperability (InterOp) test. The only way you
should be allowed to skip the InterOp test is if you are ordering very basic,
preconfigured plug-and-play hardware from your carrier. If your carrier sends
you the hardware, you should receive instructions on setting it up. In such a
case, InterOp testing isn’t as crucial.
However, the InterOp test becomes very important when you have ordered
your own hardware and you are beginning a new VoIP relationship with a car-
rier. VoIP carriers have their own default transmission configurations, and
you will either be able to modify that default, or be forced to live with it,
depending on the construction of your carrier’s network. Your carrier’s
switch may have a global setting for features like SIP-T; SIP-T sends ANI
Infodigits, which identify whether a call was made from a pay phone, hospi-
tal, or a prison (to name a few locations). 
Before you can enter InterOp testing, you have to fill out an InterOp question-
naire. This document, supplied by your carrier, not only tells your carrier
important information about your network configuration and projected call
volume, but it also shows your level of knowledge of VoIP. A standard InterOp
questionnaire asks you for some of the following information:
 Your IP protocol (H.323 or SIP): Your carrier needs to know this info to
establish the most basic level of connectivity between your router and
your carrier. 
 The H.323 or SIP hardware, location, and IP address: The physical
location of your hardware may determine which Edge Proxy Server your
carrier uses. Most carriers don’t have thousands of servers to receive
customers across North America, so the location of your hardware
determines which regional server is assigned.
 RTP media gateway: If you’re using a separate media gateway to trans-
mit your RTP stream, your carrier needs to know where it is located, its
make and model, as well as its IP address. 
 Other SDP and/or RTP hardware: Many customers have a separate
server with Automatic Call Distribution features so you can “Press 1 
for Sales,” or “Press 2 for Customer Service.” If you’re planning to use
different pieces of hardware to provide additional features, your carrier
needs to know the function of each piece, as well as info about the 
make, model, and IP address. The information you provide about your
network design helps the carrier to troubleshoot complex issues you
may encounter later. 
320
Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 

 Codecs you want to use: Your carrier may not offer every codec you
want to use, so be sure to ask your carrier which codecs are available.
For example, the T.38 FoIP codec exists, but hasn’t been fully deployed
by all carriers. 
The InterOp questionnaire has even more questions on it, but its main pur-
pose is to communicate to your carrier your business model and the hard-
ware you are using to provide VoIP service. Many carriers also ask for a
diagram of your network and the hardware involved. 
InterOp testing for compatibility
VoIP has millions of options, variations, and nuances that can prevent you
from completing a successful call. The InterOp questionnaire allows your car-
rier to determine all the types of calls you will be making. The point is to test
every variety of call your hardware is capable of, preventing protracted trou-
bleshooting in the long run. Your carrier determines the criteria for your
InterOp testing and what decides when the test is completed.
This process can take as little as 30 minutes, or as long as months. The more
knowledgeable you are about your hardware, the less time consuming
InterOp testing is. 
If you aren’t required to complete an InterOp test and are using hardware
that wasn’t provided and configured by your carrier, you should ask for an
InterOp test. Just because your carrier thinks it isn’t necessary doesn’t mean
that you can’t require it. If the carrier doesn’t require an InterOp test, call the
carrier’s customer service department and open a technician assistance
(tech assist) ticket to schedule some testing time with a VoIP tech.
If you are new to VoIP, hire a qualified technician. You may be having a won-
derful time discovering the nuances of SIP, but eventually you will reach the
limits of your knowledge and begin grasping at straws. Simply pay someone
else with the experience to finish the job so that you can eliminate your frus-
tration with VoIP. 
Hearing VoIP Quality Issues
Like any other type of phone call, VoIP calls can experience problems, but the
two concerns that are more prevalent within VoIP are linked to the very
structure of VoIP. A plain-vanilla TDM (non-VoIP) call transmits sound on a
321
Chapter 15: Riding the Internet Wave: VoIP

circuit, with continuous, unimpeded information being sent in both direc-
tions. A VoIP call, however, transmits sound in small packets over an IP net-
work that also has millions of other packets within it that are traveling in
every direction. 
The very idea of a transmission network filled with VoIP packets that come
and go, finally arriving at the far end without losing any information, and in
the correct sequence, seems like an achievement. But this is exactly what is
expected of VoIP transmissions. As long as your LAN, your carrier’s network,
and the Internet aren’t congested, everything should work fine. If any of these
three elements do have congestion, your transmissions could arrive late, out
of sequence and minus a few packets. The following sections go into what 
to do.
Getting beyond latency
Latency is a delay in the transmission of your data. Even though voice data is
converted into digital packets, in order to be understood, it must come out
the other end as a continuous transmission of sound. If a second of the con-
versation drops because it arrived late or was lost along the way, your call
quality will quickly erode to static or sections of speech will be eliminated 
(a call treatment called clipping). 
Latency can be caused in the coding and decoding process of your RTP
stream, as well as the slowing down of a packet because of the geographic
distance it is being sent. Latency issues are generally intermittent and can be
caused by a variety of issues. In fact, a consistent latency problem is uncom-
mon; if you are so lucky, you can adjust your hardware to accommodate it.
Dealing with jitter
Jitter refers to the fluctuations in latency. VoIP packets may experience a 10
millisecond (ms) delay during off-peak times, but during peak traffic hours
for your carrier, your Internet provider, or your LAN, the delay may raise up
to 60 ms. Jitter could cause portions of your call to disappear. If you hear
short, split-second pulses of dead air in your conversations, these gaps are
places where packets of data were supposed to be.
This problem is even more noticeable if your VoIP service is integrated on
your LAN that also carries data, video, and Internet traffic. Your transmissions
may sound great at times, but when your co-worker decides to download War
and Peace, and your boss is videoconferencing with your New York office,
you will probably see an instant jump in latency. 
322
Part V: What’s Hot (Or Just Geeky) in the Telecom World 

If your network tries to accommodate for this fluctuation, it has to readjust
when the last page of War and Peace finishes downloading, and then again
when your boss’s videoconference ends. 
A jitter buffer is a function within your VoIP server that collects data packets,
prioritizes them, and sends them out in sequence. They can help reduce jitter
in VoIP transmissions, but excessive congestion will overload the buffer and
result in lost packets.
If you’re integrating VoIP into your existing LAN, hire an experienced profes-
sional to validate your design. The assignment of one piece of hardware in
the wrong place will cause you prolonged pain and suffering.
Moving your existing telephone 
number to VoIP
Local number portability is the government-sanctioned freedom you have to
move your phone number from one local exchange provider (like Bell South,
Verizon, or Qwest, for example) to another. In order to use VoIP on your old
phone number, your new VoIP carrier must have ownership of it. All carriers
in the U.S. hand off their calls to the local carrier that owns the dialed phone
number. This means that until your VoIP carrier is in charge of your number,
you won’t receive any inbound calls on VoIP. 
The process to migrate, or port your phone number from one carrier to
another can be tedious, time consuming, and supremely frustrating. The
requirement to handle the acquisition and release of local numbers is brand
new for most carriers, so they’re still building their processes and procedures. 
The migration of a normal, noncellular phone number may take anywhere
from 5 to 50 days, depending on the carriers you are porting to and from. If
you are beginning to port your phone number to a VoIP provider, keep an
open mind, a positive attitude, and follow up every week to see how it is
going. 
The current trend in the industry is to charge for the migration of telephone
numbers. Don’t be shocked if your carrier charges $20 or more per phone
number for a migration. The evolving migration process can include many
delays that must be resolved. Issue resolution requires manpower, and man-
power increases overhead. That means you have to pay more. As VoIP devel-
ops, expect more fees and charges to crop up as carriers respond to the
market and protect their profitability.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens contains three chapters of tens (I
guess that’s one part of 30?), each with ten snippets
you can use. Chapter 16 warms you up to telecom lingo,
while Chapter 17 cools you down by giving you some real-
istic expectations of how the telecom industry actually
muddles along. And Chapter 18 offers real-life bits of
wisdom and helps you find the people, Web sites, and
built-in safety nets that can make things work. In general,
if you keep in mind all the information you discover in
these three chapters you may just maintain some sem-
blance of sanity in an industry that can be a little on the
chaotic side. If all else fails, you can always turn to the
Magic 8 Ball for consultation.
The appendix ends the book with all the information you
need to build loopback plugs. These little guys are the best
testing equipment available; all the better, you can build
them for less than $10 and they’re simple to create. If you
have a dedicated circuit, you need to read this appendix;
in just a couple of pages you can make your life, and the
life of your carrier, at least 95 percent less stressful.

Ten Acronyms and What 
They Really Mean
In This Chapter
 Knowing your LEC from your ANI
 Sneaking around with NASC
 Getting explanations with an RFO
 Finding your CSU and ordering your CFA
 Making magic with PFM
T
he world of telecom can seem like an exclusive club at times, mainly
because its members throw around a lot of secret code words. If you
don’t use the right jargon, you are deemed an outsider and may not be
treated with the level of respect you deserve. 
The good news is that familiarity with just a handful of terms will get you into
a comfortable middle-class position in the pecking order, where you can get
both respect and help. The ten acronyms listed in this chapter are common
to telecom technocrats, so if you use them, your carrier’s technicians will
think you’re one of them.
Getting to Know Your LEC
The term LEC (pronounced lek) stands for local exchange carrier. LECs are
local phone carriers, such as Verizon, Bell South, Qwest, or Southern Bell
Company (SBC). If you are speaking to your long-distance carrier, you can
refer to the company that provides dial tone and phone numbers for you 
as a LEC.
When you call your long-distance carrier to chat about a new phone line that
needs long-distance service, simply say, “I just got a new phone number from
my LEC that you need to set up on your network.”

Understanding ANIs
You can either pronounce ANI as ay-en-eye or ann-ee, but in the end, your ANI
is a phone number. During trouble reporting, if a technician asks for the origi-
nation and termination ANI, you just need to provide the phone number that
originated the call and the phone number that was dialed (or where the call
was intended to terminate).
This term can be used very often. When you call your LEC, you could ask, “Are
all of my ANIs set up with AT&T for long distance?” If you have many phone
lines and a phone system that pulls them all together, you could use the term
when opening a trouble ticket with your long-distance carrier. Say, “We have
about 20 ANIs going through our phone system, so I don’t know which line
actually originated the call. But it was made to the term ANI at exactly 3:27 p.m.
today.” (Term ANI stands for terminating ANI or terminating phone number.)
Getting Firm with an FOC
The term FOC stands for Firm Order Commitment. You can pronounce it by its
individual letters (eff-oh-see) or call it a fawk. The FOC is the document that
tells you the date on which your order will be completed. This goes for all
orders in telecom, from the installation of huge dedicated circuits to the con-
version of a single phone line to a new long-distance carrier. 
Say, “Our order has been pending for a few days, do we have a FOC yet?” 
The same question is sometimes asked, “Did we get FOCed on the new T-1s
yet?” (This sentence is generally spoken using the second pronunciation.)
NASCing Your Numbers
A NASC (pronounced nask) is more than just an administrative group in tele-
com, it’s also a threat. NASCing is the act of using the Number Administration
and Service Center to forcibly extract a toll-free number from a carrier. If
you’re in the process of moving all your toll-free numbers to a new carrier,
and are met with resistance from your old carrier, you can eliminate the
childish bickering and rejections and just NASC your numbers. The luxury 
of NASCing costs about $40 per toll-free number.
After having your toll-free number migration rejected numerous times for
silly reasons, call your new carrier and say, “I am tired of this game of patty-
cake! Just NASC the numbers and be done with it.” As long as your old carrier
doesn’t want to NASC the numbers back and begin a game of tug of war,
NASCing is your quickest solution to toll-free migration problems.
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Getting an RFO
As in most industries, a problem found generally turns into a cover-up begun.
An RFO, Reason for Outage, is a document that provides the official Word on
the cause of a network issue that prevents your service from working. If your
carrier’s switch sustains a direct lightening strike, preventing you from using
your phone service for three days, it is acceptable to ask for an RFO. 
An RFO is a document that your carrier (rightfully) thinks may be used against
it in a court of law. Because of this, you have a very good chance of receiving a
document that is so watered down and vague that it has no real substance to
it. Any RFO you receive will only tell you what you already know.
Sound like a pro when you say to a representative at a carrier, “My boss is
steamed that our T-1 was down for five days; can you get me some sort of 
an RFO so that he knows I was pushing to get the issue addressed and
repaired?”
Getting Your Hands on a CSU
The Channel Service Unit (CSU, pronounced see-ess-you) is a little device
about the size of a cigar box that’s used on dedicated circuits. It is the first
piece of hardware you need to make your dedicated circuit work, and its
daily job is boosting the signal coming in from your carrier. The CSU is also
the first piece of hardware used to validate the continuity on a dedicated 
circuit. 
If you want to impress a technician without sounding obvious, say, “Wow, you
can test to my CSU without any problem? That’s great! I’ll call my hardware
vendor right now to fix my phone system and then cut out for lunch.” 
Making Sure You Get a CFA
CFA (pronounced see-eff-ay) stands for Carrier Facilities Agreement, and the
term is associated with ordering a dedicated circuit. It refers to the specific
location into which your circuit cable will be wired. The CFA actually lists the
physical location of your carrier’s point of presence (POP), as well as the bay,
panel, rack, and slot to which your circuit is assigned. It’s a brief, one-page
document, but it is very specific. The CFA is also one of the first benchmarks
in the process of setting up dedicated service. When you receive the CFA, you
can rest assured that you’re halfway to completion.
329
Chapter 16: Ten Acronyms and What They Really Mean

When you’re checking on the progress of your dedicated service, the next
time you talk to someone at your carrier, say, “It’s been three weeks since we
sent you the order for our new circuit in Dallas. Do we have a CFA yet?” 
Being a Part of the PFM
Pure Friggin’ Magic refers to the mysterious events that resolve a problem,
sometimes a huge outage, with no apparent action being taken by anyone. It
is as if someone’s fairy godmother came down and sprinkled pixie dust on
the network and suddenly it all returned to normal.
PFM may indicate that someone secretly repaired an issue that he or she
caused to begin with. This is actually more desirable than the other possible
cause of PFM — an intermittent issue that will come back again soon. If the
problem crops up again, deem it as an intermittent issue and troubleshoot it
vigorously.
Tell your boss the following, “I don’t know what happened! Our carrier and
our hardware vendor swear they didn’t touch a thing to fix our problem. We
seem to have had a case of PFM.”
If you work for a boss or organization that eschews swear words, don’t use
this expression.
Getting Your CICs
The CIC (pronounced kik) is the four-digit number that your local carrier
uses to identify your long distance network. This number is also part of the
code you can dial if you want to use another long-distance carrier to make a
call. For example, if you have MCI for long distance but want to use AT&T the
next time you call London (maybe you heard that AT&T has a great network
to the U.K.), you simply dial 10-10-288, plus the international phone number
to complete your call.
If you do make a call over AT&T to London, and the number you are dialing
from isn’t set up with AT&T, you may be charged a very extreme per-minute
rate for that call. Don’t use another carrier’s CIC unless you are willing to pay
up to $5 per minute for the luxury.
When speaking to your local carrier to change the long -distance on your
phone lines, say, “Please set up all of my lines to CIC 0333. I just signed up
with Sprint and I don’t want to wait for the time it takes them to send the
order to you.”

Ten Troublesome Telecom 
Traits to Avoid
In This Chapter
 Avoiding finger-pointing
 Dealing with outages and credits
 Dealing with fraud 
 Living with projects
 Dealing with dementia
 Calculating the cost of invoice inaccuracy
 Threatening to sue
E
very industry has its little list of pitfalls, and here are ten of the largest
ones that you may find yourself dealing with during your adventures in
telecom. They are all dangerous, painful, and surprisingly easy to find, so
keep your eyes open and try to avoid them.
Finger-Pointing Your Way into a Corner
You don’t like to be told you’re wrong. Heck, no one does — especially carri-
ers and hardware vendors. There are many variables in telecom, and although
you may think you’ve isolated a problem and can pinpoint its source, you may
want to avoid doing so. There is always a quirky possibility that a problem
you find in one location may be the result of something wrong in a seemingly
unrelated part of the network.
If you sound too sure that you know what a problem is, and who is to blame,
a tense situation can quickly deteriorate into a series of verbal attacks and
pointed words. If your troubleshooting team is at odds with each other, you
are doomed to either failure or a very dicey bit of diplomacy that makes the
Mid-East peace talks look like a cakewalk. 

If emotions run high, end the troubleshooting, separate the people that are
fighting and adopt a diplomatic stance. 
Expecting a Credit After an Outage
It has become very fashionable lately to believe that every inconvenience a
person suffers should be matched with an appropriate amount of monetary
compensation. This assumption, just like the societal acceptance of notched-
lapelled tuxedoes, is patently wrong. 
Most carriers have a clause in their service contracts that prevent customers
from requesting credits for outages suffered while using their service. Think
about it from the carriers’ standpoint; they have thousands of customers
without service during an outage, and the financial impact on carriers is
probably ten times the financial loss you are experiencing.
If you do receive a credit, be thankful. Understand that the credit is a cour-
tesy. The carrier isn’t recovering the money from someone else; it’s losing
money to keep you happy.
Ignoring the Facts: Fraud Is Not Free
If you are the victim of fraud on your phone system, you aren’t guaranteed
credit from your carrier. Legally, every call placed over your phone line is
legitimately your responsibility, and your carrier has every right to pursue
payment, even if no one at your company made the calls.
Some carriers are confident of their fraud departments and state that they
will credit the accounts of any customers that experience fraud, but that is
the exception and not the rule. Protect your phone system and watch your
usage, because in the end, you are still financially responsible for any fraud
that is generated from your phone lines.
Not Accepting Admitting Defeat When
an Order Turns into a Project
If anyone refers to your order as a project, you’re in trouble. The word is an
omen that signifies delays and complexities. 
332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If you are ordering five dedicated circuits and your carrier tells you that it is
being handled as a project, you should just tack on another 5 to 15 days to
your timeline without blinking. Adopting a Zen-like sense of peace and accep-
tance is a good move at this point.
There are generally signs that identify when an order is treated as a project,
like the quantity of circuits ordered. Trying to break an order of five circuits
down into an order of three circuits and another order of two circuits won’t
help you out. If all the circuits are going to the same building, the carrier will
aggregate them and still treat the order as a (dreaded) project.
Having Expectations That 
Go Beyond Reality
It happens every day. You tell a member of a carrier’s sales staff that you
need a dedicated circuit installed in the back hills of Alabama, with an inter-
active Web site allowing you to view the total calls being processed, the aver-
age call duration, connection time, and the ability to reprogram your circuit
to hunt in a different sequence depending on your call volume. You need this
perfect system in five days.
You hear in response, “Of course! No problem!” Salespeople are out of touch
with reality. The sad part about this person’s dementia is the fact that the
salesperson is trying to take you along with for the ride. You will abruptly
arrive at the off ramp to reality 10 days after you sign the contract, when you
are told by the provisioner that the carrier doesn’t offer interactive Web sites,
that the projected installation date is in 45 to 60 days, and that the reporting
you want isn’t available. 
If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Expecting Mother Theresa
There are no Calcutta nuns that I know of currently working in telecom in the
U.S. There’s also nobody like Special Agent Fox Mulder running around, work-
ing 24 hours a day to unravel the mystery of why you can’t call your Aunt
Maybell in Des Moines. 
333
Chapter 17: Ten Troublesome Telecom Traits to Avoid

The people who work at phone companies are just like you. They put in their
eight hours and gladly leave on time. You shouldn’t expect everyone you
speak to at your carrier to have an emotional connection and conviction to
resolve your issues. If you do have a pleasant interaction with someone who
is sharp and attentive, be sure to thank this wonderful person profusely while
you quietly write down his or her direct phone number. 
Great people can turn a three-day nightmare into a five-minute annoyance.
Send them a you’re so great letter, and they will probably make themselves
available for you when you need them later.
Not Paying Attention 
to Smaller Companies
If you want a stable relationship with a carrier, you may gravitate toward
well-established companies like AT&T, MCI, or Sprint. If service is what really
matters to you, you might need to refine your criteria. 
Large telecom companies that have been around forever are often disjointed
amalgamations of smaller companies they consumed, merged with, split off
for special projects, or inherited from companies they consumed, merged
with, or were split off for special projects. To avoid the incongruous workings
of the main company, find a smaller, more personal connection with a smaller
carrier. You could get lucky and end up with a less antiseptic version of cus-
tomer service. 
Either contract with a switchless reseller that uses one of these carriers to
handle its traffic or do some research to find any special division within the
big carrier that has been designed to interact with you on a human level.
Either way, you might just get the best of both worlds.
Forgetting to Do the Math
Generating a correct invoice is a monumental task for every carrier. The rates
could be wrong, the monthly charges could be double billed, or the carrier
could be billing you for features you never ordered. That list just covers some
of the aspects your carriers have control over. Taxes are another issue and
generally can’t be explained without some shades of gray, even by the gov-
ernment organizations that administer them. Check your phone bill every
month against your contract to ensure that every rate and charge is correct.
The likelihood is high that over the course of a year, you will find at least one
thing that is wrong.
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Falling for the Standard Interval Shield
You can always tell when technicians and provisioners are getting anxious,
because they begin to find ways to protect themselves. For example, if a trou-
ble ticket should reasonably be resolved by now, or if a project isn’t moving
forward, a technician might reference the standard interval assigned for the
project. 
Here’s an example: You call your carrier because you want to change the 
ring-to number on your toll-free number. You may hear, in response to your
request, “Our standard interval is 48 hours, so don’t ask me again until then.”
The task actually takes about five minutes to accomplish as soon as someone
begins working on it, but the carrier is probably too overloaded to get started
on the project. 
If you receive the standard interval line from your carrier, try to ask (in a non-
threatening and lighthearted way) why your order is being shot down. You
could phrase your question like this, “What kinds of fires are you dealing with
over there?” or “What are the other things on your plate?”
If you ask the right questions in the right way, you can get a better sense of
the pressure cooker in which your technician is currently working. Your car-
rier may have just laid off five people in the department and three more may
have left for better jobs at Krispy Kreme, so the people left are hopelessly
swamped. 
Understanding the environment of the people who actually do the work at
your carrier will make your life easier. They will be more comfortable telling
you the truth rather than the official corporate-authorized story, and you can
then adjust your expectations accordingly so everyone doesn’t feel crushed.
So the next time you hear someone give you the standard interval routine,
recognize it as the cry for help that it is.
Demanding to Sue or Take Legal Action
Nobody in telecom wants to receive ten faxes from midnight to 5 a.m. every
day from some spammer selling Viagra, but making it your mission to hunt
the perpetrator down and take legal action is counterproductive. 
Resolving a harassment call (like the repetitive fax call) can take as little as
about 24 hours if you simply report the offender to your local phone carrier
and let someone else do the hard work. Carriers can find the call, track it
back to the long-distance carrier that originated it, and have the long-distance
carrier force its customer to stop bugging you. 
335
Chapter 17: Ten Troublesome Telecom Traits to Avoid

You can prevent some of these calls from dialing your home by listing your
phone number in the National Do Not Call Registry. This is only an option for
residential phone numbers. You can find out more about it at www.donot
call.gov/default.aspx.
Your timeline is completely different if you decide to sue the person calling
you. It’s a long and painful process that may or may not yield results. Rather
than relying on the honor of the carriers to help you (which isn’t hard to
work with) you are investing yourself in a legal system that must allow for
due process and could take months to accomplish the same thing.

Ten Places to Go for 
Hints and Help
In This Chapter
 Talking to your long-distance carrier or salesperson
 Discussing things with your hardware vendor
 Getting local support 
 Visiting the Magic 8 Ball oracle
 Heading to the manufacturer 
 Searching the Internet
 Escalating through the ranks

 Going back to where you started
A
time will come when you will need more information than you currently
have. Troubleshooting an intermittent problem, validating your rates,
or investigating new technology to ensure that it’s a fit for your company can
all exhaust your telecom knowledge.
This chapter covers ten sources of information that can help you overcome
when you are working above your telecom comfort level. Use them, accept
them, and with perseverance, you can overcome any challenge.
Calling Your Long-Distance Carrier
If you are trying to find a new solution to your telecom needs, or are working
through a potential trouble issue, your long-distance carrier is a good place
to start. The only time a representative from your carrier isn’t a good

resource for you is when the information you seek relates strictly to your
local service (if you want information about directory listings or caller ID,
talk to your local carrier).
Long-distance carriers can even handle questions that relate to your phone
system. The carrier may be able to schedule some testing time by opening 
a tech-assist trouble ticket. The tech-assist trouble ticket enables the long-
distance carrier to work directly with your hardware vendor to resolve a
problem. 
Smooth Talking with Your 
Telecom Salesperson
Your telecom salesperson is helpful for both general technology questions
and trouble issues. This person may not have all the technical information,
but nevertheless the salesperson is often the most helpful person you know. 
That’s right. It’s the job of salespeople to make the seemingly impossible
happen. They have tough quotas to fill, and when you have to make things
happen, you get to know the names of the people who can help. So talk to
your salesperson for contacts and logistical information on getting some-
thing done. 
Your sales contact will direct your questions on new technology to a pre-
sales technical engineer, and your trouble issues can be escalated to a cus-
tomer service manager. The salesperson has massive incentive to help you,
because he or she gets paid based on what you buy. Even if the service you
are interested in won’t work for you, by tracking down information the sales-
person is hoping to retain you as a customer.
Talking to Your Hardware Vendor
Your hardware vendor has an incentive to tell you all about the latest new
technology. If, through the course of explaining a glitch with your frame relay
data transfer service, the vendor rep can convert you to MPLS (see Chapter
14), the vendor can get what he or she wants, too — to sell you hardware for
the transition. 
Vendors tend to have more hands-on experience with new technologies and
can give you an unbiased assessment of what works and fails in the world of
telecom. Troubleshooting should always include your hardware vendor if
your carrier suspects your hardware is involved in the problem. 
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Visiting the Local Calling 
Guide Industry Web Site
The industry Web site, Local Calling Guide (www.localcallingguide.com),
provides you with the identity of the local carrier, OCN number, and LATA by
simply inputting the area code and the first three digits of any phone number
in the U.S. This simple task can help to find your local carrier, or the local car-
rier of someone you are trying to call. The site also enables you to see a list of
area codes by local carrier or by LATA. You will actually be surprised how
helpful this Web site is.
Using the Magic 8 Ball
You may know the Magic 8 Ball as a small toy made by Tyco Toys (a sub-
sidiary of Mattel, Inc.), but to the universe of telecom, the Magic 8 Ball is the
oracle of the greatest possible likelihood. The little 20-sided die inside the
blue inky fluid may have a 50 percent representation of positive outcomes, but
it still is an enjoyable and quick answer for any question you have. Question:
Will my circuit be installed by Christmas? Answer: Outcome unclear.
Going to Manufacturer Web Sites
The vast majority of simple questions you have about your hardware can be
answered by visiting the manufacturer’s Web site. You can also find out about
hardware upgrades and options for the specific model of hardware you have,
expansion capabilities, and more.
Many Web sites provide a visual schematic to show you how everything in
your phone system connects together. If you are familiar with a manufac-
turer’s Web site, you can alert a carrier, who may be trying to troubleshoot
the hardware but is unfamiliar with the setup. 
Searching the Internet
The Internet is more than just a place to Google your own name, buy airline
tickets, or do your Christmas shopping; it can also provide you with much
needed information. There are numerous Web sites that discuss specific tele-
com hardware, technologies, and the problems related to each of them. Try
searching for a keyword that is specific to the technology you are using. For
339
Chapter 18: Ten Places to Go for Hints and Help

example, if you are looking for information about VoIP, search for the specific
codec that you are having difficulty with instead of just VoIP transmission
problems.
Check out Chapter 16 for a quick peak at some of the most common
acronyms in telecom. Here’s a quick search technique for finding telecom 
definitions on the fly. Visit Google and type define:keyword in the search
box. For example, if you want to know what LATA means, type define:LATA.
Try this technique the next time you’re on the phone with a technician and
he or she says something you’ve never heard of before. 
Using Your Escalation List
You should have an escalation list for all of your carriers for both provision-
ing and trouble reporting issues (these are generally different departments
within carriers and have unique escalation procedures). The escalation list is
a list of names and numbers. You start with the lowest person on the totem
pole and work your way through the list until you talk to someone who can
help you manage your problem. 
Carriers have a hierarchy of technicians that receive trouble issues as they
are escalated. I would like to say that this is the same with orders, but, unfor-
tunately, the opposite is true. Escalating up the chain of command in provi-
sioning will generally connect you with people that have more responsibility,
but less knowledge of how to actually get things done. In the end, they will
simply walk down the hall to the person you chatted with first. Of course,
sometimes raising the visibility of a problem is all you need to do to get it
worked at your desired level of urgency.
Taking Your Questions to Another
Hardware Vendor
If you’re looking for guidance on a new technology, or troubleshooting a
piece of hardware that your company inherited before you found a vendor,
the system in question may not be the strong suit for your current hardware
vendor. In this case, you need to find a new hardware vendor. The world of
telecom vendors isn’t that immense, and so your vendor may even refer you
to another vendor for information about your specific system. 
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If your hardware vendor doesn’t know anyone or is less than inclined to give
you a referral, contact the manufacturer directly for a list of authorized sales
and service companies. Hint: You can usually find such lists on manufacturer
Web sites.
Starting Over
Problems and inquiries grow like insulating foam, taking up space wherever
there is the less resistance. Checking all variables is wonderful, but if you’ve
ever lost your car keys, you know that the first place you looked (if stomping
your feet and throwing stuff around in a frenzy because you’re late consti-
tutes “looking”) is usually where you end up finding the keys. 
The point is that you can easily overlook something when you’re in a panic
that is clear as day when you’ve calmed down a bit. People commonly trou-
bleshoot a problem for days on end, only to find out that there was some-
thing as simple as a configuration issue to blame. 
When you are at your wit’s end, stop, bring all the key players together for a
conference call, and slowly go over all the information about your service.
Start with how the service is configured, move on to a discussion of the hard-
ware you are using, and move on from there by describing the specific issue
and sharing the most detailed information you have about the variables you
believe could be affecting the issue. Maybe it’ll be news to someone that you
changed your configuration from ISDN to loopstart last month — and that
breakthrough could be the spark that solves the issue.
This same approach also works when you are reviewing new technology.
Don’t try to make your application fit the new technology. Instead, objec-
tively see whether the technology can successfully fulfill your application
needs. You may think that some complex technology like MPLS or VoIP
sounds very high speed and sexy, but if neither option solves your problem,
it is just a burden.

Making a Loopback Plug
In This Appendix
 Introducing male loopback plugs
 Setting up female loopback plugs
A
loopback plug is the cheapest piece of test equipment you can own. It
consists of a small plastic connector and about 10 inches of wire. The
loopback plug assists in insolating problems within your circuit and provides
a device for your carrier to run to during intrusive testing. This appendix
gives you all the information you need in order to get a functioning loopback
plug. Check out Chapter 13 for more information on using a loopback plug to
facilitate troubleshooting.
Making a Male Loopback Plug
The male loopback plug for a T-1 circuit consists of an RJ-45 connector with
pin 1 connected to pin 4 and pin 2 connected to pin 5. You can easily make
your own male loopback plug — or have your hardware vendor make one 
for you.
The next time a technician from your hardware vendor is in your office, have
the technician make a loopback plug and leave it hanging on a nail in your
phone room. If the tech is feeling generous, he or she may even make both
male and female loopback plugs. 
Here’s what you need to make your own male loopback plug:
 RJ-45 connectors: You can buy packs of RJ-45 connectors from any 
electronics, hardware, or home improvement store for anywhere from 
$5 to $10. 

 Crimping device: This tool enables you to secure the wires into the RJ-
45 connector and costs between $20 and $55. Nicer crimping tools also
allow you to work on RJ-11 connectors, which are used for standard tele-
phones, fax machines, and analog modem lines. 
 Wires: You use wires to input into the connector. You can cut them from
any flat phone or modem cable. After you cut a 6-inch section of cable
and remove 2 wires, you need to insert them into the RJ-45 connector
(see Figure A-1).
This configuration allows you to connect the transmit wires 1 and 2 to the
receive wires 4 and 5. After inserting the wires into the slots, simply crimp
down the copper blades in the connector to secure the wires and complete
the connection. You now have a male loopback connector.
Making a Female Loopback Plug
To build a female loopback plug, you need to connect the terminal for pin 1
to pin 4 and pin 2 to pin 5. Here’s what else you need to make a female loop-
back plug for a T-1 level circuit:
 A standard category 5e (Cat 5e) jack: You can find Cat 5e jacks in the
same general area as the RJ-45 connectors at your local home improve-
ment or electronics store. Some Cat 5e jacks even come with their own
push-stick to secure the wiring. The pin locations are listed on the side
of the jack. After pushing the wires into place, simply cut off the excess
and close the jack. 
 Crimping device: Refer to the previous section for more information
about crimping devices. 
 Wires: Of course you need wires. 
Insert the RJ-45 connector into the CAT 5e jack to keep both of your valuable
pieces of test equipment together. If you leave enough extra wire on the RJ-45
loopback, you can use the loop on the wires to hold the plug on a hook,
screw, or nail in your phone room. This will ensure you have both connectors
available for use and at the ready for whenever you need them.

The loopback devices listed here are specifi-
cally used to test T-1 level voice circuits. The
same RJ-45 connector and Cat 5 jack can be
used to test other types of circuits, but the pin
configurations are different:
 Loopback wiring for a 56K CSU/DSU: Wire
to connect position 1 to position 7, and 
with the second wire, connect position 2 to
position 8.
 Loopback wiring for a FastE circuit: Wire 
to connect position 1 to position 3, and 
with the second wire, connect position 2 to
position 6.
