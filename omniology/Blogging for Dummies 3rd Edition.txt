About the Authors
Susannah Gardner is the co-founder and creative director of Hop Studios 
Internet Consultants (www.hopstudios.com), a Web design company spe-
cializing in custom Web solutions for content publishers.
Hop Studios brings an insightful concern for community building and edito-
rial workfl ow to bear on each project backed by solid design and interface 
interaction skills. The company builds many types of sites, but specializes 
in those with copious, rapidly changing content or with a strong journalism, 
education, or editorial component (like blogs!). 
Susannah is also a freelance writer and author; she is the author of Blogging 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, Buzz Marketing with Blogs For Dummies, co-author 
of BitTorrent For Dummies, Dreamweaver MX 2004 For Dummies, and Teach 
Yourself Visually: Dreamweaver MX 2004, all from Wiley Publishing.
Prior to running Hop Studios, Susannah worked in the Online Journalism and 
Communication Program at the University of Southern California, writing cur-
riculum, teaching, and conducting research at the intersection of technology 
and journalism. She was a senior editor of the Online Journalism Review, the 
media industry’s only Internet-focused journalism publication. Susannah also 
spent four years at The Los Angeles Times, one of six editors responsible for 
launching that newspaper’s Web site. During her time at LATimes.com she 
established the site’s multimedia lab, which produced ground-breaking Web 
audio, video, and animation. She also launched and edited MetaHollywood, 
an online-only publication that covered new Hollywood technology and was 
LATimes.com’s single largest revenue source in 1998.
Susannah earned bachelor’s degrees in Print Journalism and American 
literature at USC. To learn more about her Web design company, visit www.
hopstudios.com. 
Shane Birley is a Vancouver-based Web developer, creative writer, and blog 
consultant with more than 15 years of experience in developing Web sites. 
In January 2006, he cofounded Left Right Minds Initiatives with his partner 
Allyson McGrane.
Left Right Minds is a creative solutions company for nonprofi t societies, char-
ities, and businesses. The business evolved from Shane’s work with develop-
ing Web sites (through his previous company, Vicious Bunny Creative) and 
Allyson’s ongoing work with nonprofi t arts groups. Both partners have expe-
rience giving workshops about their areas of expertise and in training others 
to use new technology and business skills. In addition to Web development, 
the company manages and represents performing artists with the support of 
the Canada Council for The Arts.

As a partner in Left Right Minds, Shane is now working to develop Web sites 
using content management systems that enable his clients to edit and update 
their own Web content. He regularly gives workshops on blogging and did 
extensive research for BitTorrent For Dummies. Shane has a background in 
improvisational theatre and a B.A. in English — these qualifi cations enable 
him to translate diffi cult computing concepts into easy, plain language. To 
learn more about his Web company, visit www.leftrightminds.com. He 
also writes a personal blog at www.shanesworld.ca.

Acknowledgments
Susannah: As with every book I have worked on, I fi nd it unfair that my name 
is on the cover when so many people played such an important role in get-
ting this book fi nished.
Many grateful thanks go to Shane Birley, a good friend, who is my coauthor 
on this book. He met deadlines, turned in screenshots, and kept himself on 
top of both the technology he was writing about and the book production 
schedule as well. It has been wonderful to collaborate with him again. Thanks 
are due also to Shane’s life and business partner Allyson McGrane, who kept 
him fed and functioning during deadlines.
As always, I send a special shout out to Janine Warner, the long-time For 
Dummies author who gave me my start in the technical book business.
Rebecca Huehls, my editor, and acquisition editor Amy Fandrei at Wiley both 
deserve more credit than me for making this possible; without their behind-
the-stages work there would literally be no book. Of course, there are many 
more folks at Wiley Publishing that I should be thanking — and do. Someday 
I hope to meet some of you people in person and buy you a well-deserved 
beverage.
My technical editor, once again, is Paul Chaney. Paul is the Internet market-
ing director at Bizzuka, Inc., and an all-around nice guy. You couldn’t ask for 
a more conscientious, helpful and funny person to point out all your niggling 
little technical errors. 
Friends, family, colleagues and clients all cut me some slack while I was meet-
ing deadlines for this book. Special thanks go to Matt, Debbie, Jan, and Phil 
Gardner, Pat and Virginia Smith, and Degan Beley. Thanks for making me the 
person I am today.
My coworkers Rachael Ashe and Justin Crawford at Hop Studios picked up 
slack, held phone calls, made tea, and fi elded the occasional technical emer-
gency at deadline time, and I’m so appreciative of them and of the opportu-
nity I get each day to work with them.
That leaves my husband Travis Smith to thank, and there are neither words 
nor time enough to tell you what a gem he is. You’ll just have to trust me: no 
Travis, no book.
No acknowledgements in a book of mine would be complete without a few 
words about you, dear reader. You make this whole business worth doing. 
Thank you.

Shane: Since the previous edition of Blogging For Dummies was released, 
it is amazing how the landscape of the blogosphere has changed and yet 
how much of it has remained the same. I have to send out a huge thanks to 
Susannah for allowing me the opportunity to collaborate with her on this edi-
tion. She is an incredibly amazing person, and I am very thankful to count her 
as a good friend. 
Thanks to everyone who helped me on this edition or, at the very least, toler-
ated me when deadlines were approaching. Ken Driediger, who still keeps 
me sane even though he doesn’t know it, Robin Thompson who is always 
there to keep me grounded in my creative life. I also need to thank Kirstie 
McCallum and Victor Terzis — two of the coolest people I know and work 
with daily. They know me far too well.
As always, I appreciate the love and support of my family. To my mother — 
who bought me my fi rst TRS-80 computer, when I really wanted a Coleco 
video game console. To my father who taught me everything about life, love, 
and the pursuit of great beer. And to my sister, Kristen, who may be taller 
than me, still knows I am the bigger and older brother and I will always know 
more than her.
My biggest thanks goes to Allyson McGrane, my partner in crime, life, and 
just about everything else.  She was incredibly supportive in helping to proof-
read, listening to me report on all the latest blog technologies, and most of 
all walking our pugs Serendipity and Faith when I was focused on getting the 
next paragraph down on paper.
I am sure I have forgotten some people but you know who you are and I 
thank you.

Introduction
A
llow me to be the first to welcome you to the blogosphere, an exciting 
and energetic space online that people are using to reach out, build 
communities, and express themselves. Blogging For Dummies, 3rd Edition, 
is designed to help you through the process of starting a blog quickly, and 
it gives you the tools you need to make the most of your experience in the 
blogosphere. I’ve added a lot of new material since the last version of this 
book — keeping pace with the World Wide Web is a challenge!
This book is designed to be useful for all kinds of bloggers, whether you’re the 
CEO of a major corporation or a hobbyist with a passion for communicating. I 
focus on what makes a blog work — and how a blog can work for you. Also, 
I realize that not everyone has the technical skills necessary to start a blog 
themselves, so I provide options for all levels of experience.
This book is useful to you, whether you’re taking part in the conversations 
in the world of blogs or becoming a blogger yourself. I cover everything 
from technology to legal issues, so you can go forward knowing you have a 
resource that covers every aspect of this exciting medium.
About This Book
Whether you’re building a blog as a rank beginner or redesigning an existing 
blog to make it better, you can find everything you need in these pages. The 
fact that you’re holding this book very likely means you have some ideas 
about starting a blog — and I want to get you started right away! 
The first part of the book gets you blogging quickly and safely. Chapter 1 
introduces you to blogging, Chapter 2 walks you through the world that is 
the blogosphere, and Chapter 3 helps you choose the software and tools you 
need to get started. In Chapter 4, I show you the fastest and easiest way to 
get started immediately with your very own blog.
However, you don’t have to memorize this book or even read it in order. Feel 
free to skip straight to the chapter with the information you need and come 
back to the beginning later. Each chapter is designed to give you easy answers 
and guidance, accompanied by step-by-step instructions for specific tasks. 

2
Blogging For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
I include sidebars that give you more information, but you don’t need to read 
those sidebars if you’re short on time. Technical Stuff icons also indicate 
helpful extras that you can come back to when you have more time. 
Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book, 
those consistent elements are conventions. Notice how the word conventions 
is in italics? That’s a convention I use frequently. I put new terms in italics 
and then define them so that you know what they mean.
URLs (Web addresses) or e-mail addresses in text look like this: www.
bloggingfordummiesbook.com. Sometimes, however, I use the full URL, 
like this: http://traction.tractionsoftware.com/traction because 
the URL is unusual or lacks the www prefix.
Most Web browsers today don’t require the introductory http:// for Web 
addresses, though, so you don’t have to type it in.
Foolish Assumptions
Just because blogs have a funny name doesn’t mean they have to be written by 
funny people — or even humorous ones! If you can write an e-mail, you can 
write a blog. Have confidence in yourself and realize that blogs are an informal 
medium that forgives mistakes unless you try to hide them. In keeping with 
the philosophy behind the For Dummies series, this book is an easy-to-use 
guide designed for readers with a wide range of experience. Being interested 
in blogs is all that I expect from you.
If you’re new to blogs, this book gets you started and walks you step by step 
through all the skills and elements you need to create a successful Web log. If 
you’ve been reading and using blogs for some time now, this book is an ideal 
reference that can help you ensure that you’re doing the best job possible 
with any blog that you start or manage.
I do expect that you aren’t tackling starting a blog without having some basic 
computer knowledge under your belt, not to mention a computer on your desk. 
If you’re still figuring out how to use your computer or don’t have access to an 
Internet connection, keep this book for a time when you’re more able to put 
your computer and the Internet to work for you.

3
 Introduction
Having said that, you don’t need to know much more than how to use a Web 
browser, open and create files on your computer, and get connected to the 
Internet, so you don’t need to be a computer genius, either.
How This Book Is Organized
To ease you through the process of building a blog, I organized this book to be a 
handy reference. The following sections provide a breakdown of the parts of 
the book and what you can find in each one. Each chapter walks you through 
a different aspect of blogging, providing tips and helping you understand the 
vocabulary of Web logs.
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs
This part introduces you to the general concepts of blogging, including actu-
ally starting a blog today. In Chapter 1, I show you some good blogs and give 
you background about this young industry. You can find out what’s involved 
in creating a blog and take a quick tour of what works in a blog and what doesn’t.
While reading Chapter 2, you find guidance on how your friends, family, and 
business colleagues might react to your new blog. If you’re interested in blog-
ging frankly, you might want to read this chapter before you start criticizing 
your boss or writing about your personal life online.
In Chapter 3, you make a big decision: what blogging software you want to 
use. I explain what your options are and how to find blog software that has 
the features and extras you need. Also, choose a domain name and a Web 
host so that you can install your own blog software and control every aspect 
of the blogging experience.
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog
In Chapter 4, you can jump right in to a real blog and start a hosted Blogger 
blog. Sign up in ten minutes and have fun putting up text, links, and images. It 
really is that easy.
Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted to helping you start blogging in two other 
formats. Chapter 5 covers setting up and blogging with WordPress, a software 
application that you install on your own server. And Chapter 6 is all about 
the latest craze in the blogosphere: micro blogs.

4
Blogging For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Together, these chapters give you step-by-step instructions for both starting 
up a new blog and adding blog posts, images, and other fun stuff to the blog 
you start. If you read no other chapters in this book, read these!
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good
Part III is dedicated to making sure you know how to get the most out of your 
blog while meeting the needs of your audience. In Chapter 7, you can work on 
figuring out just what your topic is and how best to produce content around 
your subject. I even give you tips on dealing with writer’s block.
In Chapter 8, you can define your audience and work on targeting your blog 
to reach that group most effectively — and keep readers coming back for 
more.
Chapter 9 helps you avoid a common blog problem: spam. Discover the tricks 
every blogger must know to keep Viagra ads from dominating their comment 
areas. More than that, however, Chapter 9 tells you how to cultivate a 
community of interaction and conversation on your blog.
Part IV: Going Beyond Words
In Part IV, you find a series of chapters that help you dress up your blog with 
style and neat technological tools. In Chapter 10, you can find out how to 
make the most of photos and other graphics in your blog. Did you know that 
adding a photo to your blog post makes more people read it? It’s true!
If you can’t say it with a photo, say it with your mouth by creating a podcast 
in Chapter 11. Everyone, from the newest blogger to the seasoned profes-
sional, uses this exciting area of the blogosphere to make themselves heard.
Words and photos aren’t the whole story. A lot of bloggers are taking advan-
tage of better bandwidth and more powerful computers to create video blog 
posts. Find out more about working with video in Chapter 12.
Part V: Marketing and 
Promoting Your Blog
Make your blog and yourself known on the Internet and in the blogosphere 
by using the tools described in Part V. In Chapter 13, you can find out what 
the heck RSS is and how you can use it to build traffic to your blog. Not only 

5
 Introduction
that, you can use RSS yourself to read other blogs quickly and find out what 
others are saying about you.
Twitter is showing up everywhere, even in sitcoms. In Chapter 14, get familiar 
with this fun new tool for keeping in touch with friends, family, and even your 
colleagues. You can dive into the depths of social networking in Chapter 15. 
You may find more going on with Facebook than you think!
Chapter 16 helps you use statistics and traffic-tracking tools to discover more 
about your audience members and how they’re using your blog.
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It
If you’ve ever thought that you ought to be able to make a little money with 
your blog, then Chapter 17 is for you. Find out how to put ads on your blog, 
form relationships with sponsors, and use affiliate programs to make a buck.
If you’re a corporate CEO or small business owner, then Chapter 18 is a must-
read. In this chapter, I show you how businesses, nonprofit groups, and other 
organizations are making use of blogs to form relationships with clients and 
customers.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
In The Part of Tens, you can discover ten ways to increase the community 
interaction on your blog, ten cool tools that can make your blog even snazzier, 
and best of all, ten outstanding blogs that make the most of technology and the 
Internet.
Glossary
Blogs, sidebars, blogrolls, RSS — this medium has more jargon that you can 
shake a stick at. I define new terms in a chapter so that you know what’s 
going on when you start blogging, and you can always consult the glossary at 
the back of this book for definitions of all those weird blog terms that have 
sprung up in recent years. Don’t let a few acronyms keep you from enjoying 
the blogosphere!

HTML Guide
Get the goods on writing your own HTML code — happily, you don’t need to 
do much of that on a blog (unless you want to)!
Icons Used in This Book
Here’s a rundown of the icons I use in this book:
 
The Remember icon reminds you of an important concept or procedure to 
store away in your memory bank for future use.
 
The Technical Stuff icon signals technical stuff that you might find informa-
tive and interesting, but that you don’t need to know to develop the Web sites 
described in this book. Feel free to skip over these sections if you don’t like 
the techy stuff.
 
Tips indicate a trick or technique that can save you time and money — or 
possibly a headache.
 
The Warning icon warns you of any potential pitfalls — and gives you the all-
important information about how to avoid them.
Where to Go from Here
Turn to Chapter 1 to dive in and get started with an intro to blogs and an 
overview of why this new medium is so exciting for so many people. If you just 
want to get started blogging today, read over Chapter 4. Otherwise, spend 
some time thinking about the best blog software solution for your situation —
which you can read more about in Chapter 3. Already have a blog, but want 
to do more with it? I think Chapter 8’s coverage of great content might be a 
great place to dive in. Don’t forget to send me your efforts — I can’t wait to 
see your blog! Drop me an e-mail at susie@hopstudios.com.

In this part . . .
P
art I is your crash course in blogging, from finding 
out what the heck blogs are all about and why peo-
ple are bothering with them at all. It’s an exciting section, 
and you won’t want to miss a word! In Chapter 1, you find 
out why people are posting their most personal thoughts 
on the Web and why even businesses are getting involved. 
In Chapter 2, it’s all about the ethics — how you can start 
a blog and keep your job at the same time. Chapter 3 shows 
you the ins and outs of several blogging software applica-
tions and guides you through picking the right solution.

In This Chapter

▶ Blogging successfully
B
y now, you’ve probably heard the word blog tossed around by all kinds 
of people, seen it show up in news stories or cited on TV news broad-
casts, or heck, you may even have a child, friend, or coworker who has a 
blog. Bloggers are showing up inside businesses, and businesses are even 
using blogs to reach out to their customers. But what exactly do all these 
people mean when they say they have a blog? And what does a blog written 
by a teenager have in common with one written by a CEO?
Don’t be too hard on yourself if you aren’t exactly sure what a blog is. The 
word blog is actually a mash-up of two other words — Web and log — so 
if it sounds made up, that’s because it is. At its most basic level, a blog is a 
chronologically ordered series of Web site updates, written and organized 
much like a traditional diary, right down to the informal style of writing that 
characterizes personal communication.
In this chapter, you can find out just what makes a blog bloggy and why so 
many people are outfitting themselves with one like it’s the latest celebrity 
fashion trend. (Hint: It’s not just that we’re all narcissists!) You can get some 
ideas that you can use to start your own blog and become part of the blogo-
sphere (the community of blogs and bloggers around the world).
No matter what your teenager tells you, the blogosphere has absolutely no 
requirement that you must write your blog while wearing your pajamas. Also, 
you’re allowed to use a spellchecker.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Making Yourself Comfortable with Blogs
I talk to a lot of people about blogs, many of whom know that you can find a 
blog on the World Wide Web, but who also have the impression that all blogs 
are written by navel-gazing cranks with an axe to grind or by 12-year-old 
girls. Some blogs really are diaries in which the blogger records the minutiae 
of day-to-day life — but blogs can be much more than that, and all kinds of 
people write them.
One of my favorite blogs falls into the personal diary category: Mimi Smarty
pants (http://mimismartypants.com). A woman living in Chicago writes 
this blog, which records her thoughts and activities with such hilarious prose 
that I often find myself laughing out loud.
For contrast, visit Mäni’s Bakery Blog Café (www.manisbakery.com/
blogcafe), shown in Figure 1-1, a blog that the staff of Mäni’s Bakery in Los 
Angeles writes for the bakery’s customers. Mäni’s uses the blog to announce 
menu changes and weekly specials, offer coupons, and talk about the bakery 
products, such as vegan cake.

 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
Think of a blog this way: It’s a kind of Web site. All blogs are Web sites (the 
opposite isn’t true, though), and neither the content nor the creator makes 
a blog a blog — the presentation does. A blog can be many things: a diary, a 
news source, a photo gallery, or even a corporate marketing tool. Blog con-
tent can include text, photos, audio, and even video, and bloggers talk about 
nearly any subject that you can imagine.
 
One of the reasons blogs have become such a popular way of publishing a 
Web site is because they’re particularly good at generating high search-engine 
rankings. If you have a blog, it’s more likely than a standard Web site to come 
up high in lists of search results for the topics you discuss because your posts 
are fresh and current. Search engines give an extra boost to Web pages that 
have the most recently updated or created content related to the keywords 
that someone is searching for. And better search-engine listings mean more 
visitors, more readers, more comments, and a more vibrant community. 
Individuals and companies have taken advantage of the blog medium to reach 
out to Web users.
How people use blogs
With millions of blogs in the world — the blog search engine Technorati 
(http://technorati.com) has tracked more than 133 million blogs 
since 2002 — it’s obvious that blogging is a popular and successful format 
for publishing a Web site. But just what are people doing with blogs? They 
can’t all be talking about their cats!
And they aren’t. Bloggers are using the blog format to communicate effec-
tively in all kinds of information spheres, from the personal to the profes-
sional. In fact, many blogs serve multiple purposes at the same time, mixing 
posts about activities at home with news pertaining to work. Your blog can 
serve many purposes in your life.
Documenting your life
A lot of folks use blogs for the same reason they might keep a diary — to 
chronicle their lives and activities. This urge to communicate appears in all 
kinds of mediums, from scrapbooking to taking digital photographs, and if 
you’re interested in sharing these personal details with others, a blog gives 
you a fast, efficient way to do so.
If you send holiday newsletters every year or e-mail a group of friends and 
family to let them know about exciting events in your life, you can have a lot 
of fun with a blog. You can blog as often as you want, and your readers visit 
when they’re ready to get more information. Best of all, each blog post gives 
your friends and family a quick way to respond to you without having to find 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
the stamps; they only have to leave a comment on your blog post. You might 
find you’re talking more with your family than ever before!
 
You don’t have to find the postage stamps either, so keeping in touch 
through your blog is inexpensive and less time-consuming than snail mail. And 
no more envelopes to lick.
Of course, not all lives come up roses every day; they can’t all be wedding 
and travel blogs. Personal blogs can be intense when they document rough 
times. Derek Miller (www.penmachine.com), a Vancouver-based writer, has 
used his blog, shown in Figure 1-2, to document his experiences with cancer. 
He posted this blog entry on June 8, 2009:
“Sometimes, for a few days, it’s easy to forget how sick I am. But I found 
out I have cancer two and a half years ago, and I’ve been under some sort 
of treatment — chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or recovering from those 
things — the whole time. Tomorrow I’ll hear the results of my latest CT 
scan, good or bad. That will help determine what comes next.”
 
In your eagerness to let your friends know about what you’re up to, don’t 
forget that anyone in the world can access a blog (unlike a real diary or 
scrapbook), now and in the future. Don’t publish anything that you might find 
embarrassing in the future, and have the same consideration when you talk 
about others or use photographs.

 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
Exploring a hobby or passion
If you have a passion or hobby that you just love to talk about, consider 
doing so in a blog. Anyone who shares your interest is a potential reader and 
is bound to be looking for more information wherever he or she can find it.
You can detail your own experiences, offer advice to others, drum up sup-
port for whatever you like to do, or just talk about what you love. Best of all, 
you might be able to make connections with others who share your infatua-
tion, making friends and finding ways to get involved with your hobby more 
deeply.
Cybele May runs a blog about something she loves: candy. Candy Blog (www.
candyblog.net) is her personal labor of love and a great excuse to buy a 
lot of candy! Cybele reviews candies, writing extensive descriptions of taste, 
texture, and ingredients for fellow sugar enthusiasts. And they respond! 
Nearly every review garners comments from fans and critics of the candies 
that Cybele samples. Check out Candy Blog in Figure 1-3.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Sharing information
Sometimes, a blog is all about sharing information. Journalists use blogs to 
report on local, national, and international news; critics and commentators use 
the medium to state their opinions and predictions. Educators keep parents 
and students abreast of classroom happenings and dates. Coworkers let col-
leagues in geographically distant offices know what’s going on in relation to 
collaborative projects. The uses of the informational blog are really limitless.
The popular blog Boing Boing (www.boingboing.net) is a great example 
of an information-sharing blog. Self-described as a “directory of wonderful 
things,” Boing Boing’s several contributors are dedicated to keeping you up 
to date on all the weird and wonderful Web sites in the world. A selection 
of posts from August 2009 described the Nano Air Vehicle (it has wings, like 
insects do), a mouse who had made its home in an Oregon ATM, and a link 
to creating your own “Achingly Self-Referential Virtual Commodity Fetish 
Objects.” This site is truly a random collection of news and links, perfect for 
the eclectic consumer of trivia.
Another popular information blog is TechCrunch (www.techcrunch.com). 
This guide to everything Internet covers everything from new companies 
to the latest geek gadgets and, of course, offers a lot of information about 
software. You might not find every post useful, but if you’re trying to keep 
up with the breakneck pace of technological innovation on the Internet, you 
can find TechCrunch (shown in Figure 1-4) and blogs like it an invaluable 
resource.
Making money
You spend a lot of time producing your blog, and a lot of people read it. Why 
not turn those eyes into dollars? That’s a question many a popular blogger 
has asked, and you can make it happen in several ways.
The most common technique involves including advertisements on your 
blog pages. For example, Google AdSense (www.google.com/adsense) pro-
vides in-page advertising that’s designed to match the content of your blog 
and therefore be of interest to your readers. Each time a visitor to your blog 
clicks one of these advertising links, you earn money from Google. I talk more 
about making money from advertising programs, affiliate links, sponsorships, 
and more in Chapter 17.
Of course, companies haven’t missed out on the fact that blogs can help them 
drum up interest in their products and services, or inform and connect with 
consumers. Many companies, small and large, have added blogs to their Web 
sites, and they use the blogs to start conversations with their customers and 
potential customers. In many cases, taking on the informal voice of the blog 
medium has helped customers understand that real people work in these orga-
nizations. This personal connection gives the company better credibility and 
often adds to customers’ recognition of that company and its values in the 
marketplace.

General Motors, Google, and Sun Microsystems all have company blogs, giving 
readers a peek inside the corporate culture of what might otherwise be fairly 
faceless monoliths. 
Southwest has taken this approach (www.blogsouthwest.com). On the blog’s 
About page, Southwest says, “Our goal with the new Nuts About Southwest 
remains to give our readers the opportunity to take a look inside Southwest 
Airlines and to interact with us.” Southwest tries to make sure that the blog 
represents a lot of voices inside the company, from managers to captains — 
even the president of the company. Like with personal blogs, the tone is light 
and conversational, making the company seem friendly and accessible.
Recognizing a blog
You’ve probably seen a blog online already. Because the blogger isn’t required 
to put a big This Is a Blog! sticker at the top of the page, you might not have 
realized that you were looking at a blog. With a little practice and familiarity 
with standard blog elements, though, you can identify any blog in a snap.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Regardless of what the blog is about or who writes it, every blog features
 
✓ Frequent updates: Most bloggers update their blogs a few times a week; 
some bloggers even update them a few times a day. Blogs don’t have 
a schedule for publishing; the blogger simply updates the blog when it 
seems appropriate.
 
✓ Posts or entries: Each time a blogger updates the blog, he or she creates 
a blog post, or entry, that he or she then adds to the blog.
 
✓ Permalinks: Each time a blogger adds a post to his or her blog, that post 
appears on the blog’s home page. At the same time, blog software cre-
ates a permalink page to contain only that blog post and its comments. 
(The word permalink is short for “permanent link.”) Permalink pages 
are a big part of why blogs do so well with search engines — every post 
adds a new page to your Web site and provides another opportunity for 
your blog to come up as a search result.
 
✓ Chronological order: When a blogger writes a new blog post, that post 
appears at the top of the blog’s first page. The next time the blogger writes 
a post, it shows up at the top, and the older posts move down the page.
 
✓ Comments: Most (though not all) blogs allow readers to leave 
comments — short text messages — in response to blog posts. Comments 
really differentiate a blog from most Web sites by encouraging interaction 
and conversation.
 
✓ Archives: Because blogs are updated so frequently, bloggers often sort 
their blogs into a date-based archive so that readers can find older infor-
mation easily.
 
✓ Categories: Bloggers can also sort posts by subjects, or categories, 
which allows a blogger to blog about a number of different topics and 
lets readers focus in on the topics that most interest them.
Blog anatomy: Dissecting a typical blog
In this section, I give you a tour of the usual blog elements by using baker Rose 
Levy Beranbaum’s blog, Real Baking with Rose Levy Beranbaum (www.real
bakingwithrose.com). This blog is unusual because although Rose writes it 
herself, it’s sponsored by Gold Medal Flour, which paid for the blog to be built 
and handles any maintenance costs associated with running it. It still has all 
the usual features that I discuss in this section, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Rose’s sponsorship is unusual, but the format of her blog isn’t. In fact, most 
blogs — no matter what topic they cover — look quite similar because the 
elements of one blog are common to all blogs.

Blogging through the ages
The concept behind a blog isn’t new; after all, 
people have been keeping diaries and journals 
since the invention of the written word. Even on 
the Web, diary Web sites existed long before 
anyone used the word blog.
No one really knows when the first true blog 
was created, but estimates put the date around 
1994. The term weblog came into existence in 
1997, and it was quickly shortened to the more 
colloquial blog. If you want to read more about 
the history of blogging, read author Rebecca 
Blood’s essay on the early days of blogging 
at www.rebeccablood.net/essays/
weblog_history.html.
No one can really measure the number of blogs 
in the world, for a number of technical reasons 
and because blogs can be short-lived (acciden-
tally or deliberately), but all studies of numbers 
indicate that the number of blogs increases 
dramatically every month. For example, in May 
2007, the blog search engine Technorati (www.
technorati.com) was tracking 75 million 
blogs; by July 2007, that number was up to 94 
million. 

18
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Those common elements are:
 
✓ Branding/logo header: A header at the top of the blog displays the name 
of the blog, often including a logo or other visual element. This header 
is visible on every page of the blog, identifying it, even to a visitor who 
visits one of the interior pages without first going to the home page. 
In Figure 1-5, the header contains the name of the blog, a caricature of 
Rose, and the Gold Medal logo (indicating the blog’s sponsorship).
 
✓ Most recent posts: At the top of the blog’s home page, the most recent 
post appears. While you scroll down the home page, you see the next 
most recent post, and the next most recent post, and so on. New posts 
are always at the top, making it easy to find the latest, freshest infor-
mation when you visit. Most blogs display around a dozen recent blog 
posts on the first page of the blog, and to read older posts, you can visit 
the archives.
 
✓ Post information: Along with each entry, blog software displays infor-
mation about the post. This sort of post information typically appears —
but a blogger doesn’t have to include it. A blog might be missing an element 
or two that I list or have others that I don’t mention:
 
• The date and time the post was published.
 
• The name of the post’s author. On blogs that have multiple 
authors, the visitor may find this info especially important.
 
• The number of comments on the post. In Figure 1-5, you can see 
the first post hasn’t yet received any comments.
 
• A link to the permalink page, usually labeled Permalink. 
Sometimes, as in Figure 1-5, the link to the permalink page is 
labeled Post/Read Comments because you can both read and write 
comments on the permalink page.
 
• The category in which the blogger has placed the post. In Figure 1-5, 
the category of the top post is Announcements.
 
• Other links to bells and whistles unique to the blog, such as the 
links to Send to a Friend (which allows you to quickly e-mail the 
post to a friend) or Print, shown in Figure 1-5.
 
✓ Sidebar material: Most blogs are laid out in two or three columns, with 
the most real estate given to the column that contains the blog posts 
themselves. The second and/or third columns display organizational 
material for the blog and peripheral information. Some blogs don’t have 
sidebars at all, and on some blogs, you may see elements that I don’t 
mention in the following list of typical sidebar components:
 
• Date-based archives: Nearly every blog archives a post when the 
blogger publishes that post, both by date and by category. In the 

19
 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
sidebar of a blog, you can usually access both archive methods. 
Figure 1-6 shows the date-based archives of Rose’s blog, broken down 
by month. Date-based archives can also show weeks and years.
 
• Categorized archives: Figure 1-7 shows the category archives of 
Real Baking with Rose Levy Beranbaum. By sorting each post into a 
category at the time that she publishes it, Rose creates an archive 
organized by subject, making it easy for you to find the posts that 
most interest you. Clicking a category link displays only the posts 
in that subject area, organized in reverse chronological order.
 
• Blogroll: A blogroll is a list of other blogs that the blogger finds 
interesting or useful. By including the blogs and Web sites that 
Rose likes to read on her blog, she can direct her readers to other 
interesting Web sites (see Figure 1-8). And who knows, those sites 
may return the favor, sending their visitors to her site.

• Information about the author: Because blogs are so personal, some-
times you want to know more about who’s writing them. Many 
bloggers know their readers are curious, and those bloggers put 
together short bios and other information for readers. Bloggers 
sometimes display this information in the sidebar or link to it, like 
in Figure 1-9.
 
• RSS feed link: Readers can use RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, 
to subscribe to your blog by using a newsreader, such as Google 
Reader. After a reader subscribes via RSS, he or she can read the 
latest updates via the newsreader instead of visiting your blog. So, 
your readers don’t have to visit your blog several times a day to 
see whether you’ve updated it. A blog often includes an RSS link 
(identified by a small orange icon, as shown in Figure 1-10) near 
the bottom of the sidebar. I talk more about RSS in Chapter 13.

Getting a Blog Started
One of the reasons that so many blogs exist is that you can set them up and 
publish them so easily. The early days of the Internet were full of heady talk 
about the democratization of publishing; people discussed how absolutely 
anyone would have the power to publish because of the prevalence of 
personal computers. In fact, that idea wasn’t strictly true. A writer no longer 

21
 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
needed a printing press and a distribution method to get his or her work to 
people, but he or she still needed specialized skills and technology.
Unless the would-be publisher spent time figuring out how to use HTML, 
owned a computer that had an Internet connection, and understood how to 
put files onto a Web server, he or she was still pretty much in the same can’t-
get-published boat. You could acquire those skills and the tools to publish, 
but you couldn’t do so terribly easily.
The answer, as it turns out, comes down to technology — specifically, soft-
ware. I believe blogging goes a long way toward making that initial promise of 
the Web come true. If you can write an e-mail, you can figure out how to use 
the simple interfaces of blogging software without any of the muss of dealing 
with HTML, FTP, or any of those other awful Web acronyms everyone’s sup-
posed to understand these days.
Figure 1-11 shows the publishing interface of Blogger (www.blogger.com), 
a great blogging software tool. To write a new post, you simply log in to 
Blogger, fill in the blanks for a new post, and click the Publish Post button to 
put the entry on your blog.

Different blog software offer different feature sets. Like with all software, the 
tricky part is finding the right one to use for your situation and needs, but I can 
assure you, blogging software comes in all shapes, sizes, and price ranges. In 
Chapter 3, I talk extensively about choosing the right software solution for 
your blog. Chapter 4 shows you how to start a blog in about ten minutes by 
using Blogger, and Chapter 5 walks you through the details of using WordPress.
Choosing What to Blog About
You can find blog topics all over the map. If you haven’t already read a blog, 
follow these simple steps to find one and read it, which is the best possible 
way to become familiar with the medium:
 
1. Open your Web browser and go to www.technorati.com.
 
2. Type any search term that you’re interested in reading about into the 
search box at the top of the page.
 
 For example, you might enjoy reading a blog written by someone with 
whom you share a hobby, such as knitting or parasailing. Or try a search 
term that describes what you do for a living; if you’re an accountant, for 
example, you might search for tax regulations. You can also search for 
something that can help you accomplish a task, such as buying a house 
or finding out how to paint.
 
3. Click Search (the magnifying glass button to the right of the search box).
 
 Technorati returns a list of recent blog posts that used your search 
term. When I searched for knitting, for example, Technorati showed 
me a blog post by someone who just bought some new yarn for making 
socks, one about a recipe for a knitting-themed birthday cake, and 
another post by someone who was frustrated with a pattern.
 
4. Find a blog post that looks interesting and click the URL to visit the 
blog and read more.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4, as needed, until you find a blog that 
you enjoy!
You can find blogs on so many topics that you can’t keep from finding some-
thing interesting, whether it engages you professionally or personally. I read 
blogs on all kinds of topics that interest me, from (surprise) knitting to the 
arts to real estate.
The blog format is exceptionally well-suited to letting you explore an idea, 
a hobby, or a project — but don’t let that stop you from using it for other 
things. People have created blogs to pass along marketing expertise, sell 
shoes, cover the latest celebrity gossip, raise funds for bike rides, and even 
write books. The topic or topics that you write about should excite you and 
hold your interest, and they can be about absolutely anything.

23
 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
Having that much freedom can be a little scary and, if you’re like me, can leave 
you with an absolute blank in your mind. No problem; you can start a blog today 
about one topic, and when you actually figure out what you want to write about, 
change directions and go down another road. It’s a very flexible format!
 
Think about the following tips when you start a blog:
 
✓ Choose a subject that genuinely interests you. Don’t choose a topic 
because you think being interested in it makes you look good or you 
think that it’ll attract a lot of readers. You’re the one who has to do 
the writing for the blog, and you can do that writing a lot more easily if 
you’re enthusiastic about your subject. Your passion shines through to 
your readers and keeps them coming back.
 
✓ Decide whether any topics are off limits. Bloggers who keep personal 
diaries for their friends and families might decide to keep certain sub-
jects out of the public forum of the Internet. For example, do you really 
want your significant other reading a frank account of last night’s make-
out session? How about your mom or your boss?
 
✓ Think about your potential readers. Who are they? How can you appeal 
to them and get them to keep reading your blog? Do you even care about 
how many readers you have? If you do, what do you want to show, 
explain, or ask them?
Creating a Successful Blog
Blogs are so quick and easy to set up that you can start one without having 
much of a plan in place for what you want to blog about, why you’re blogging, 
or what you’re trying to accomplish. Some people thrive on this kind of wide-
open playing field, but others quickly become bored (or boring!).
To get your blog started on the right foot, think seriously about why you’re 
blogging and then make a commitment to attaining your goals. Don’t get me 
wrong — this isn’t a job! But, just as you wouldn’t expect good results from a 
dinner prepared without paying any attention to ingredients, you can’t start 
your blog without having a recipe for success.
Here’s my recipe for a good blog:
 
1. Preheat the oven by setting goals.
 
2. Measure out several cups of good writing.
 
3. Mix well with frequent updates.
 
4. Sprinkle in a lot of interaction with your readers.

24
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
 
Watching how someone else blogs is a great way of finding out how to be suc-
cessful yourself! Keep track of how the blogs you enjoy are keeping you interested: 
Take note of how often the blogger updates his or her blog, the writing style, 
and which posts you find most engaging and get you to leave a comment. 
Setting goals
Just like you have many different reasons to blog, you have many ways to 
create a successful blog. Don’t forget that your goals and plans might not be 
the same as another blogger’s. Do think about what your goals are and keep 
those goals in mind when you start your blog.
The following are ways that you might define a successful blog:
 
✓ Numbers: Many bloggers are eager to attract readers to their blogs, and 
they define success by the number people who visit every day.
 
✓ Comments: Some bloggers find the interaction with readers in the com-
ment area of the blog very gratifying. For these bloggers, getting a com-
ment every day or on every post might mean they’re successful.
 
✓ Results: Many bloggers start their blog in order to accomplish a task 
(such as raising money for a charity), to sell a product, or even to get a 
book contract (blogs have done all these things). When these bloggers 
meet their goal, they know they’ve succeeded!
When you start your blog, take time to think about how you define success. 
Do you want to help your entire family keep in touch? Do you want to let your 
friends back home know more about your college experience? Are you start-
ing a company and trying to get attention in the media? Consider writing your 
goals into your very first blog post and then returning to that post every few 
months to see whether your goals have changed and to remind yourself of 
what you’re trying to accomplish.
Writing well
Many people think that blogs are poorly written, misspelled, and full of gram-
matical no-no’s such as incomplete sentences. Most criticism has at least some 
basis in reality, and this case is no different. Many bloggers do write their blogs 
very casually, paying only cursory attention to spelling and grammar.
For many, this informality is part of the charm of the format. Readers find 
the colloquial, conversational tone accessible and easy to read, and bloggers 
who write informally seem approachable and friendly.

25
 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
I’m not making an excuse, however, for ignoring all the rules of writing. Well-
written and correctly spelled blogs attract readers just as often (perhaps 
more often) as those that aren’t. You can develop a friendly, personal way of 
writing without losing touch with the dictionary. I encourage the use of spell-
checking, even for very informal blogs intended for friends and family.
 
For a professional blog, don’t even consider writing without paying attention 
to spelling and grammar. Your readers will run the other way, and your com-
petitors will get a good snicker out of it.
 
Most importantly, however, think through your writing and consider your 
reader. Take the time to practice and develop a voice that sounds personal 
and conversational while still qualifying as good, engaging writing. Don’t let 
the chatty style of a blog fool you — the best bloggers spend just as much 
time writing a casual blog post as they would a work memo.
You can find tips on how to develop your voice in Chapter 7.
Posting frequently
Commit yourself to writing new posts on your blog frequently. Ah, frequently 
is such a deceptive little word — because really, what does it mean?
For some people, frequently means every day. For others, it means three 
times a day. If you want a blog that doesn’t eat up every spare moment in 
your life but that you still update enough to keep people interested, define 
the word frequently as at least two or three times a week. (If you want to blog 
more often than that, go to town.) This number of updates strikes a good bal-
ance for most blogs.
 
Many bloggers use a little trick to account for periods of writers block or for 
when they go on vacation: They write posts ahead of time and then save them 
for later. Using your blog software, you can schedule a date and time for a 
post to go live, making it possible for you keep your readers entertained, even 
while you’re having your appendix removed or sitting on a beach in Hawaii.
You also need to pace yourself. In the first heady days of having a blog, the 
posts flow freely and easily, but after a few months, you might find it difficult 
to be creative.
Interacting with comments
Comments make blogs really different from a Web site; the opportunity to 
interact and converse with the creator of a Web site and with other readers 

26
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
is almost unique to blogs. (Forums, also called bulletin boards, offer one way 
to engage in online conversation on the Web, but they aren’t as directed by 
regular posts as blogs. Everyone in the forum community is free to chime in 
with a topic or question.)
Visitors to a blog have the opportunity to leave a comment on each post. 
Sometimes, readers leave comments in reaction to what they read; other 
times, they might offer a suggestion or pose a question. Because any reader 
can leave a comment, readers may leave comments about other comments!
Blog posts often include a link directly below each post, indicating how many 
comments readers have left. Clicking this link takes you to a page that dis-
plays the post, any comments that readers have left about that post, and a 
form that you can use to leave your own comment.
After someone makes a comment, it appears in the Comments area of the 
blog, usually labeled with the comment writer’s name, along with the date 
and time that he or she left the comment. On some popular blogs, readers 
compete to see who can leave the first comment on a new blog post.
In Rose Levy Beranbaum’s blog Real Baking with Rose Levy Beranbaum 
(www.realbakingwithrose.com), Rose often responds to questions that 
readers ask by putting the answer in her blog post’s comments area. Rose’s 
comments have a shaded background that other comments don’t have (see 
Figure 1-12) and feature her personal avatar image.
Not every blog allows comments. Many popular bloggers find that they’re 
overwhelmed by the sheer volume of responses that they get and must turn 
off comments because they can’t keep up with them. We should all be so 
lucky to have that problem. For most bloggers, comments are an important 
way to develop a dialogue with readers.
 
I recommend you keep comments turned on in your blog. They’re an easy 
way to involve your audience in your topic and to get valuable feedback about 
what you’re doing with your blog.
 
Unfortunately, spammers can take advantage of comments as easily as they 
can send you unwanted e-mail. If you keep comments turned on, you get 
unwanted comments that have commercial messages, unless you take preven-
tative measures (which is becoming easier to do). You or your readers might 
even find some spam comments offensive, just like some kinds of spam e-mail. 
If you decide to allow comments on your blog, be sure to read them and delete 
inappropriate messages. Your readers will thank you. In Chapter 9, I talk at 
length about encouraging comments — and dealing with those comments that 
you don’t want.

Designing for Success
Blog design is a very personal experience. The decisions you make about 
how your blog looks are just as important as the technology that you choose 
to run your blog and what you choose to put on it. Because the Web is an 
ever-evolving medium, no solid rules exist that tell you what you should or 
shouldn’t do with your blog. But you can follow guidelines to keep your best 
foot forward.
The blog that you’re starting is a reflection of you and your professional life. 
Even if your blog is for personal expression, it represents who you are. So, 
make sure that you have a good handle on how you want to present yourself 
to the world. If pink bunnies say everything you need, you should have pink 
bunnies. And if you need to look more corporate, you should avoid the pink 
bunnies — unless you sell Easter baskets and egg dye.

28
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
If you’re blogging for business reasons, either on behalf of a company or to 
promote yourself, make sure that both the writing and design demonstrate 
the proper tone. Seek advice from bloggers like you and find out from friends 
and family just how they think your blog should look. Check out other blogs, 
especially blogs that reflect the same goals or tone you want to create. What 
does the design of those blogs say about the blogger and the blog content?
Whether you hire a designer for your blog, use a blog template, or try to 
make the design yourself, seek ways to make your blog stand out from the 
rest. If you’re a business, make sure that your logo appears on your blog. 
If you’re creating a personal blog, add your own photos. Even if you use a 
default template, you can often add an identifying graphic or element on the 
site that differentiates your blog from others.
 
Don’t be afraid to start small and plan to redesign later. You can grow into 
your big ideas when you’re sure that you know what you want, so take the 
time to look at what other blogs are doing while you make your plans.
Let your readers be your guide: If your mom visits your site and says that 
she can’t read it, find out why. If your friends start talking more about the 
annoying background color than your latest blog post, you have a problem. 
Just like you do with your content, keep the design focused on the readers to 
keep them coming back for more.
The average blog has four very distinct areas in which to place and customize 
content: logos, headers, sidebars, and footers. In a blog, each of these areas 
has a specific purpose. As more blogs have come into existence, these areas 
have developed in specific ways that can help you organize your content.
Here’s some detail about each of these customizable areas:
 
✓ Logos: Getting a visitor’s attention on the Internet is a science in itself, 
and clean, crisp logos can hold a visitor’s interest long enough to get 
him or her to read some of your blog. Typically, a logo appears near the 
top of each blog page. Many logos include an illustrated element and a 
special font treatment of the blog name.
 
✓ Headers: The header of any blog contains a few elements. The first 
element should be, of course, the name of your blog. The title should 
explain what your blog talks about or who you are as the main writer. 
You can also throw into the header some form of navigation that can help 
your visitors find their way around and provide them with quick links to 
special areas that you want highlighted on your site. On many blogs, the 
logo also appears in the header. Like the name suggests, headers appear 
at the top of blog pages.

29
 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
 
✓ Sidebars: Sidebars usually become a major focus for a blog site. Sidebars 
are columns to the right or left (or both) of the main content area, and 
they contain elements such as navigational links, special highlighting 
graphics that point to social networking sites, lists of blogs that you 
read (blogrolls), archive links, or anything that you want to share with 
your visitors outside the context of a blog post. Sidebars usually appear 
on every page of your blog and look consistent from page to page. I 
cover customizing your sidebars with fun applications and features in 
Chapter 20.
 
✓ Footers: Footers live at the bottom of each blog page, and sometimes 
they do nothing more than feature a copyright message. More advanced 
bloggers have expanded the use of footers to include a significant series 
of links to content within their sites. These links might lead to comments 
on the blog, recent posts, or posts that you particularly want to high-
light. The footer can feature parts of your blog that you want visitors to 
find easily.

I
f you put something on your blog, anyone can read it. Blogs, like all Web sites, 
are accessible anywhere in the world at any time, and anyone who can 
access a computer and understand the language the blog is written in can read 
it. (Some blog software does allow privacy settings or password protection — 
and if you use these options, you have more assurance of privacy.)
And, like with all Web sites, people can print, duplicate, and fax blog posts, 
tape them to lamp posts, distribute them to a class, or post them on social 
networking Web sites such as Facebook. A reader of your blog can even copy 
and paste the text of your blog posts into a text editor or e-mail message, 
sending that text buzzing around the world in the blink of an eye.
You can’t know who’s reading your blog, why they’re reading it, or what they 
might do with what you post. I often talk to bloggers who say, “Well, my only 
readers are my friends and family, so I don’t worry too much about what I write.” 
Your friends and family may very well be reading (in fact, I hope they do!), but 
they may not be the only readers. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that 
you know who is and isn’t reading your blog! I’m not saying that your readers 
aren’t only your friends and family, but you can’t know that for sure.
 
Some blog-hosting sites require you to register in order to use them, such as 
MySpace, and so they offer you a smaller potential audience. Not just anyone 
who has a computer and an Internet connection can read those blogs; anyone 
with a computer, an Internet connection, and an account on that service can 
read them. Those blogs might offer you more privacy, but generally the barri-
ers to registering for a service such as MySpace are very low: You just need an 
e-mail address. The blogs might as well be public.

32
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
In rare instances, an entire blog is password-protected and therefore read-
able only by visitors who know the login information for the site. As long as 
that login information stays private, the blog is private. All the points about 
people being able to copy and paste or print the post still apply, however.
In this chapter, I drive home the point that you shouldn’t post anything to your 
blog that you don’t want anyone in the world to read — and yes, that includes 
your best friend, your significant other, your mother, your co-workers, your 
boss, your landlord, your neighbor . . . you get the idea.
Assessing Your Involvement
Any productivity guru will tell you that individuals who are looking for advice 
think with their short-term brains. When you start a new project, you rarely 
think beyond the end of the calendar year — and even that could be a some-
what generous assumption. New bloggers aren’t any different.
Think about where you want the blog to be in five years. Will you still 
actively blog, or will this blogging thing last a few days, weeks, or months? 
Recognizing your level of commitment helps establish a clear vision about 
the resources that you should put into the blog.
 
Making decisions about the future of a blog can be a tricky business, but here 
are a few questions to answer (maybe in your new blog!) about where your 
blog will take you:
 
✓ What level of commitment are you willing to put toward your blog? 
Take a moment to visualize your level of commitment. If you’re wonder-
ing why the heck you thought you might want to blog in the first place, 
maybe blogging isn’t for you. On the other hand, if you’re thinking about 
how many ways you can use your blog to enhance your business visibility 
or to keep your family up to date about what you’re doing, you might 
want to try blogging.
 
 The best starting point in determining your commitment is how many 
posts you’re planning to write per day or week. Many popular blogs tend 
to post more than once per day, but at that stage, the blogs are usu-
ally making a little money, or the bloggers already have an established 
business (so the blog provides mainly a supplemental outlet for them). 
Posting once per week works for most personal blogs.
 
✓ Do you like writing? How’s your typing? Being able to write is one 
skill, but being able to write and make your writing interesting and fun is 
entirely different. You can’t pick up blogging overnight; you must figure 
out how to do it by practicing. A good way to do this would be to create 

33
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
a test blog on a free blogging service like Blogger.com and try posting 
for a period of time. If you have any distaste for writing or don’t know 
whether the writing on a regular basis will work for you, you don’t need 
to invest a lot of time and money until you know the answers to these 
questions.
 
 Knowing how to type is an important skill that some new bloggers might 
not be very good at. If you don’t like to write (or type!), consider a pod-
cast or a videoblog. I talk about those formats in Chapters 11 and 12.
 
✓ What will the blog be about? Is your blog personal or professional? 
If you think of your blog as a personal space, that purpose suggests an 
appropriate level of time and money for your individual financial situ-
ation. You can choose a design solution and write content to suit your 
budget and time.
 
 However, if you want the blog to serve a business purpose or promote 
your professional acumen, keep in mind that company or consultancy 
needs to present a polished, professional image online with a profes-
sional-looking design — ideally, one that’s integrated with any existing 
branding and logos. Also rather than squeeze in time for writing the 
blog, designate time for blogging just as you would for a meeting, project 
task, or other work-related responsibility.
 
✓ Do you think that your new blog might grow into a new career, lead 
to new clients and business, or help build connections with peers and 
colleagues? Web sites can really help you make connections (just like 
joining social networks and finding old classmates), and I presume that, 
in part, you’re starting a blog to reach out to a community. If the com-
munity is a professional one or a group whose respect you must earn, 
your blog can send unspoken messages about who you are and what 
you stand for. But you don’t need to get all corporate!
 
 Most popular bloggers have developed careers based on their blogs 
unintentionally, all thanks to the quality of the blog. Bloggers have used 
blogs as starting points for book deals, television shows, and even direct 
sources of revenue. Think about the needs of your audience members 
and how to appeal to them, even when you consider what software to 
use. If you want to build an empire, choose the software that has the 
bells and whistles necessary to make that empire possible. You find out 
more about software in Chapter 3.
 
✓ How comfortable are you with sharing information about yourself or 
about your business or industry? The Internet is a public space. Don’t 
forget that anyone can read what you reveal about yourself on your 
blog, not just the people you’re trying to reach. (See the next section 
for details.) Occasionally, bloggers find themselves the recipients of 
unwanted attention and discover that they need to blog more 
anonymously than they’d planned.

What Happens When You Publish?
Blogging is a very immediate medium — when you publish a post, it goes live 
on your blog right away. In fact, several things happen the moment you click 
the Publish button:
 
✓ The post appears at the top of your blog’s home page.
 
✓ The blogging software adds the post to your blog’s archive, usually 
by both date and subject, and to your RSS feed, which gets updated in 
newsreaders.
 
✓ Anyone who signed up for e-mail notifications receives an e-mail about 
your post.
 
✓ If your blog software pings blog search engines and services, those search 
engines and services receive a notice from your blog software that you’ve 
updated your blog. (A ping is simply an electronic notification.)
 
✓ A search-engine crawler indexes the post the next time it visits your blog.
All these changes happen whether or not you think about them. The fact that 
blog posts are quickly distributed with a minimum of effort on the part of the 
blogger is part of the beauty and effectiveness of this format. Blog software 
and services are designed to deliver your content quickly.
 
Of course, you can edit your blog posts after you post them, and many bloggers 
make changes when necessary (see the “Making mistakes” section, later in this 
chapter, for some suggestions about changing your blog posts appropriately). 
However, editing after you post gives you a pretty ineffective way to control 
your message, because visitors might read or e-mail the original post 
before you make your edits.
The content you publish on a blog or Web page can live on in other unin-
tended ways as well:
 
✓ Other bloggers might quote your post and expand on it on their blogs, 
creating partial copies of your deathless prose.
 
✓ Blog services might point to, and even partially excerpt, your blog post.
 
✓ Search engines might cache or otherwise archive the content temporar-
ily or permanently.
 
✓ An Internet archive, such as the Wayback Machine (www.archive.
org/web/web.php), might add your blog post to its database.

35
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
You can see these effects demonstrated in Figure 2-1; a Google search (www.
google.com) for the phrase what happens when you drink coke turns up 
not only a blog post, but several references to that same post on other blogs 
and Web sites, and on the news-sharing site Digg (http://digg.com). Google 
links to the original blog post, and you can also access a cached version 
archived by Google.
I don’t want to scare you — after all, publishing to your blog is a good thing! 
You want each of these processes to happen because they bring readers to 
your blog and present your content to potential readers. But be sure about 
what you’re posting before you do start the ball rolling.

Blogging Ethically
The best defense, as they say, is a good offense. As a blogger, you should 
think about what you write before you publish it, as well as afterwards.
What I’m about to say might shock you, so prepare yourself: Bloggers have a 
code of ethics.

36
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Okay, what I really mean is that some bloggers have a code of ethics. This 
loose set of ethics and standards, to which many serious bloggers adhere, 
developed as blogs matured from a new medium into a more established one. 
For most old-school bloggers, the word to think about is transparency, which 
represents a whole range of ideas. I introduce transparency here and explain 
in more detail in the following sections:
 
✓ Truth-telling and honesty: In keeping with the diary format of a blog, 
being transparent on your blog has a lot to do with telling the truth 
about who you are, why you’re blogging, and what you want to accom-
plish with your blog. You want to communicate openly and honestly on 
a blog, dealing straightforwardly with your topics and ideas, and with 
your readers. 
 
 This idea of honesty doesn’t mean you need to reveal information that 
you’re not comfortable disclosing online — quite the contrary. But it 
does mean you don’t intentionally mislead your readers, as I explain in 
the upcoming section, “Telling the truth.” 
 
✓ Admitting mistakes: No one’s perfect, and you’ll eventually make a mis-
take. Whether you post something that you heard, which turns out not 
to be true, or you blog angry, the real test is how you respond to making 
a mistake. In the blogosphere, you need to own up to your words, apolo-
gizing if you need to and making corrections when they’re necessary.
 
✓ Maintaining a dialogue: A good blogger is aware of, and responsive to, 
his or her readers via the comments that those readers leave on blog 
posts. A blog isn’t created in a vacuum. In fact, many bloggers feel that 
you can use a blog to build real relationships with people.
 
The idea that you can use a blog for meaningful interaction is revolutionary. 
At the core, blogging is about real people talking with each other and sharing 
real knowledge and experiences.
Of course, a blog isn’t necessarily great literature — and that’s fine. But 
transparency comprises worthy ideas, especially if you plan to blog about 
personal and sensitive topics. Read on for more details.
Telling the truth
Honesty in blogging is different from honesty in real-life relationships or even 
journalism or advertising, because knowing who someone is or what they 
represent online is complex. Consider the following: 
 
✓ Blogging anonymously: Blogging under a pen name is okay. For many 
bloggers, telling the truth is first about emotional honesty and second — 
or perhaps not at all — about revealing who you are. For example, a 

37
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
personal blogger may connect with a community over a sensitive topic 
and thus want to use a pen name. 
 
 The blogosphere doesn’t like poseurs. If you choose to blog about 
your life and do so anonymously, be prepared for readers to challenge 
whether you’re a real person. Know that your true identity may be 
revealed, either publicly or among people who know you in real life. Be 
prepared to defend your writing as your own, especially if your anony-
mous blog could create conflict in your offline life or career.
 
 A famous incident from 2001 concerning the blog of Kaycee Nicole, a 
young teenager who had just died of leukemia, demonstrates the kind of 
thing I’m talking about. People all over the world followed her blog, chat-
ted with her online, even spoke with her on the phone during her illness. 
In fact, the life and death of Kaycee was the product of imagination. After 
some suspicious anomalies surfaced, several savvy bloggers tracked 
down real-world evidence that she not only hadn’t died, but didn’t even 
exist.
 
✓ Blogging about products and services at the behest of the product or 
service provider: The online community has slammed bloggers for blog-
ging about products and services for money without revealing that they 
were paid to do so. A blog scandal in 2003 put Dr Pepper into the public 
eye for soliciting blog posts from a group of teenagers about a new prod-
uct called Raging Cow. The teens received trips, samples of the product, 
and gift certificates, and the company asked them to promote the drink 
on their personal blogs. Many of the teens did so without revealing that 
they basically received compensation for promoting the product, and 
when the arrangement became public, a blogosphere boycott of the 
company and a lot of anger against the bloggers ensued.
 
✓ Blogging as a fictional character: Interestingly, Dr Pepper also started 
a blog for the product that, ostensibly, the Raging Cow herself wrote 
during her travels around the country, as shown in Figure 2-2. Bloggers 
roundly criticized this blog at the time (for being fake, of course). But 
the idea of creating fictional characters that write blogs has stuck 
around, and many bloggers have used it successfully since then. The 
format is still controversial, but it’s also highly effective!
 
In general, I recommend following these rules about honesty in your blogging:
 
✓ Explain who you are and why you’re blogging.
 
✓ If you need to hide your identity or those of people you mention, indi-
cate that you’re doing so and why.
 
✓ If you start a fake blog, make sure that you disclose somewhere on the 
site that it is, in fact, fake. (You’d think that a blog written by a cow is 
obviously fake, but it doesn’t hurt to say so.)

Figure 2-2:
 The Raging 
Cow blog 
was an 
early 
example of 
a fake blog 
written by 
a fictional 
character.
 
 
✓ If you’re making money from your blog posts, explain the arrangement 
and how you’re allowing it to influence (or not influence) what you write.
 
✓ If you mention a fact or story that you got from someone else, explain 
who. If you can link to the source, do.
 
✓ Take responsibility for what’s on your blog, no matter where else you 
might have heard or read about what you write.
Making mistakes
If you make a mistake on your blog, admit it. Apologize, if necessary. Above 
all, don’t try to deny it or hide it.
 
Mistakes, big and little, are inevitable and upset people, but you can do a great 
deal to help yourself and your credibility by how you handle the mistake after 
you or your readers discover it.
In general, most bloggers try to avoid editing posts after they publish those 
posts, which is part of the transparency I discuss earlier in the section 

39
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
“Blogging Ethically.” Sometimes, however, you need to correct the original 
post when you make a factual or grammatical error. Fortunately, bloggers have 
evolved ways to indicate corrections in blog posts, such as using strikethrough 
text on the original error and following it with the correction, like this:
President Bill Clinton played his trumpet saxophone on The 
Arsenio Hall Show.
Blogger Darren Barefoot uses this technique on his blog (www.darren
barefoot.com). In Figure 2-3, he corrects a grammatical error that changes 
the meaning of a sentence. Other bloggers use italics or bold, or make notes 
at the top or bottom of the blog post, to make these kinds of corrections. The 
strikethrough style, however, has the advantage of letting you indicate the 
original error clearly.
 
Making a correction while retaining the error is best (unless the error was 
libelous or is causing legal trouble). Try to avoid simply changing the text like 
the mistake never existed.

On his blog, 
Darren 
Barefoot 
uses strike-
through text 
to cross out 
an error.
 

40
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
You can handle updates that you want to make to a blog post in two ways:
 
✓ Expand on your original post: If you change your mind about something, 
or simply need to expand on what you first said, you may want to do 
so in the original blog post, instead of starting a new post. Updating 
the original blog post ensures that readers see your original post at the 
same time as the update.
 
 For very important updates that change the intention or meaning of a 
post, Darren Barefoot (www.darrenbarefoot.com) posts the update 
at the end of the original post labeled UPDATE, as shown in Figure 2-4. In 
this case, the update expands on the original post by pointing out new 
resources. Some bloggers preface the new content with the acronym 
ETA (which stands for Edited to Add).

information 
to add to a 
blog post, 
Darren 
Barefoot 
adds an 
update to 
the bottom 
of the 
original 
post.
 
 
✓ Start a new post: When you really mess up, you might also choose to 
add a new blog post that explains what went wrong and how you might 
be able to avoid similar mistakes in the future (assuming that’s pos-
sible!) or that just clarifies the whole situation. You don’t always need 
to go this far, but if it helps clear the air, why not? Plus, you can use the 
extra post to apologize if you need to.
 
 If you start a new post to explain a mistake, link to the old post and also 
go into the old post to create a link to the new one, just so all your readers 
get a chance to see all the details.

41
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
Handling dialogue
You write your blog in hopes that people read it and (usually) respond and 
interact with you, as well. The mechanism for interacting with your readers 
involves blog post comments. Comments are both a boon and a bane for 
bloggers — they provide a source of much interesting dialogue, but they 
can also likely provide an area for people to post spam and other unwanted 
material.
A blogger who neglects to read comments and respond to them quickly loses 
the community of people who write those comments because they can get 
frustrated and leave. On the flip side, reading and replying to those same 
folks generally earns a blogger a larger and more engaged audience.
You don’t need to keep all the comments on a blog, however. Be sure to pay 
attention to the conversation others generate on your blog, and when neces-
sary, exercise your judgment about removing personal attacks, libel, obscen-
ity, spam, or other undesirable content.
In Chapter 9, I cover building a strong community dialogue by using the com-
ments on your blog.
Keeping Your Job While Blogging
You can blog about anything you want. And you spend a lot of time at work. 
So maybe you’re blogging about work. Work can certainly provide you with a 
great source of stories and jokes. In fact, at my office the other day, my partner 
did the stupidest thing. . . .
Ahem.
Anyway, blogging about work can get you in trouble. Your colleagues and 
your boss might not appreciate that you repeat water-cooler gossip on your 
blog, complain about the most boring meeting ever, or talk about how you 
photocopied inappropriate body parts when you were “working” late on 
Thursday.
 
If you choose to discuss people you work with on your blog and someone may 
be able to identify them (even if you don’t include your coworkers’ names), 
you can get yourself in hot water with both your coworkers and your boss.
And all that trouble comes before you reveal trade secrets or stock 
information!

42
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Some bloggers identify both themselves and their employers on their per-
sonal blogs. Doing so is certainly transparent — after all, work is a big part of 
your life — but it isn’t necessarily wise. For one thing, if you blog about your 
work place and you name your employer, readers might think that you’re 
blogging on behalf of your employer.
This perception isn’t fair, but a lot of readers have it. After all, if you blog on 
your own time (and you do blog on your own time, right?) and don’t use com-
pany blogging software, who can consider you a spokesperson for your 
company? Honestly, most people won’t think you’re a mouthpiece for 
your company, but they might associate your thoughts and opinions 
with your employer. Generally speaking, employers don’t want people to 
identify them by the political agendas, family relationships, or dating habits 
of their employees.
Most employers today know that blogs exist, and they’re fully capable of typing 
your name, their name, or the company name into a search engine and finding 
blogs that talk about them or their company. Blogging anonymously — 
although a good idea if you want to criticize your employer — doesn’t really 
guarantee that you won’t get caught, particularly if other people in your 
office know about your blog.
Employers who regard their employees as representatives of their busi-
nesses might even institute a company blogging policy that dictates whether 
you can identify your employer on your personal blog. This policy might 
even request that you not blog at all, especially if you are the visible face of 
the organization or speak for the company in other situations. 
 
I encourage you to blog about whatever floats your boat, but if you want to 
blog about work, you need to do so safely. Here are a few tips that you can use 
to stay on your employer’s good side:
 
✓ Regardless of what you blog about, don’t blog at work. Using company 
time and resources to write a personal blog is a clear violation of most 
employment contracts and can get you disciplined or fired, even if all 
you do on your blog is sing your boss’s praises.
 
✓ Find out whether your workplace has a blogging policy. If your boss 
doesn’t know, consult with the HR department. In some cases, a policy 
might be in place that makes certain requests of your blogging behavior, 
and you can choose whether to comply with them. Give some thought to 
complying with them and have good reasons if you choose not to.
 
✓ Ask questions about your employer’s blogging policy if it’s unclear 
or incomplete. Find out whether you can’t discuss certain subjects and 
whether you can identify yourself as an employee.

43
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
 
✓ Be smart about what you choose to say about your work and your col-
leagues. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable saying what you write in public, 
don’t put it on your blog. (Go back to the beginning of this chapter if 
you’re unclear on the idea that the Web is a public place.)
 
✓ Don’t reveal trade secrets. Trade secrets include confidential information 
about how your employer does business that can impact revenue or 
reputation. If you aren’t sure whether you can blog about something, 
run it by your boss first.
 
✓ Review other rules and regulations that might impact what you can 
blog about. For example, some employers have policies about taking 
photographs of the workplace, or revealing addresses or buildings. 
Those policies seem unrelated to blogging — until you put those photos 
or information on your blog.
 
✓ Consider including a disclosure statement on your blog that says 
you’re blogging for personal expression and not as a representative 
of your employer. Thomas Duff makes his blogging position clear in 
his very thorough disclosure statement on Duffbert’s Random Musings 
(www.duffbert.com/duffbert/blog.nsf/htdocs/TDUF63Z2TS.
htm), which is shown in Figure 2-5.
 
Figure 2-5:

statements, 
such as

clear that

not for your 
company.

Blogging without Embarrassing Your 
Mother or Losing Friends
You might think it goes without saying that if you can lose your job over 
opinions that you express on your blog, you can also damage your personal 
relationships with friends and family. I’m saying it anyway.
Many bloggers get caught up in the confessional mood and post content 
that they later regret — though perhaps not as much as a friend or relative 
regrets it.
Understanding what’s at stake
Successful blogger Heather Armstrong alienated her family early in her blog-
ging career when she posted her views on the religion in which she was 
raised. Her parents, who were still firm believers in that religion, read the 
post, which also hurt her extended family and the community in which they 
lived. (I’m sure she received plenty of e-mails from people outside of family 
who also felt strongly about their religion.) Heather calls herself a poster 
child for what not to do on a blog, though in fact, the process has resulted 
in Dooce (www.dooce.com), a blog that’s both well-known and profitable 
online today.
In an interview with Rebecca Blood (who studies blogs), Heather cautions 
that criticizing others might make great posts, but the chances are good that 
the person you criticize will read what you’ve written and feel hurt. You can 
read the full interview on Rebecca Blood’s Web site at www.rebeccablood.
net/bloggerson/heatherarmstrong.html.
Even if you never criticize others, you might possibly reveal information 
about others — their conversations with you, the date you had last night, 
the disappointing sexual encounter — that your friends and family may find 
disturbing.
Protecting others in your life
Call it the Mom test: Can your blog post get you in trouble with your mom? 
Sure, you’re an adult, and so is she — but she’s the most likely person to call 
you on an inappropriate blog post. Your coworkers might be appalled when 
they read about your love life, but they probably won’t ever tell you that your 
blog is a problem. Your mom will.

45
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
In some ways, all this advice is common sense:
 
✓ Don’t blog about topics that you think might hurt others.
 
✓ Don’t blog about others without their permission, even about topics that 
you consider inconsequential. Don’t identify friends and lovers by name 
without their permission.
 
✓ Remember that your blog software archives your blog posts, so some-
one might read what you say today at a later time. For instance, if you 
write a report on an unsuccessful relationship, the next person you want 
to date might read it.
 
Before you hit the Publish button, stop for a second and put yourself in the 
shoes of your reader: Are you writing for the reader, or are you writing for 
yourself? If your answer is the latter, you might be better off keeping a real 
diary in a format that the entire world can’t publicly access.
Protecting Your Privacy and Reputation
Your blog might not reflect your employer’s viewpoints or your family’s, but 
it certainly reflects your own. Don’t forget that what you put on your blog 
today might stick around for a long time to come and that the reader might 
not always have your best interests at heart.
 
Never put any personal identifying information online that exposes you to pos-
sible identity theft or physical confrontation: Don’t post your Social Security 
number, home address, birthdate or place, mother’s maiden name, pass-
words, bank account numbers, or any information that you use as password 
reminders or identifying information with financial institutions. Most bloggers 
prefer to keep phone numbers private, as well. Don’t reveal this information 
about the people you blog about, either.
Many bloggers solve the issues discussed in this chapter by choosing to blog 
anonymously or by using a handle — a phrase or moniker that doesn’t per-
sonally identify the writer.
Don’t forget that many of your online identities are linked. For example, if 
you use a nickname when you leave comments on other blogs, and then use 
that same nickname on a bulletin board or when you sign up for a social-
networking service, people can easily connect the dots. In fact, many of these 
services already work together.
For example, on one of my blogs, I display my Flickr photo stream, my blogroll 
maintained with Bloglines, and my latest Twitter messages. My Facebook 
profile pulls in my Amazon wish list, my music playlists, and my horoscope. 

46
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Here’s my point: If you identify yourself on any of these sites or tools, and 
then tie them together in some way, others can easily follow the trail to figure 
out who you are.
Anonymity gives you a great way to protect yourself on your own blog, but 
it doesn’t keep you from showing up in other people’s blogs or Flickr photo 
streams. If your friends and family have blogs, consider setting ground rules 
with them about situations and topics that you want excluded as subjects on 
their blogs. Be willing to accept the same kinds of requests about your own 
blog writing.
 
One of the best ways to take charge of your own online identity is to start a 
Web site or blog yourself. If other people are mentioning you online, having 
an official Web site that contains accurate information can help supplant or 
downplay less desirable material.
If you want to find out more about controlling your online identity or 
protecting your privacy, review some of these great online resources:

Blog Software
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing a domain name for your blog
▶ Identifying a good Web host
▶ Deciding between hosted and non-hosted software
▶ Getting your blog software in place
I
f you’re serious about turning your blog into a visual masterpiece, you’re 
likely to choose a blog software package that you install on your own Web 
server. Hosted solutions are great, but you run up against the limits of cus-
tomization quite quickly.
In this chapter, you can find information about choosing the right software 
for your situation. If you pick blog software that you need to install, you also 
need to get yourself a domain name and Web hosting where you can install 
your software.
Prepare yourself for strange new technology jargon while you explore what 
makes blogging exciting, frustrating, confusing, and rewarding — blogging 
software.
Having Your Own Domain Name
Of course, you want a blog — that’s why you’re reading this book, right? — 
but before you get too much further, you need to deal with the single most 
important decision of your blogging career: the name of your blog!
That name should tie closely into the domain name, or Web address, that your 
visitors use to access your blog. And if you have a domain name, you obviously 
need Web hosting so that your blog software has a place to live on the Internet. 
In the following sections, I walk you through domain names and Web hosting.

48
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
A domain is the address (or main URL) that people type in their Web brows-
ers to get to your Web site. Think of a domain like an address to your house. 
Each house on a street has an individual address. When someone looks for 
you in the phone book, he or she can find your address. If you search for 
a Web site by using your favorite search engine, you can find the Web site 
address.
Picking a domain name
You can use any word or phrase as your domain name (assuming no one else 
is using that domain name). You can make your domain name a company 
name, a nickname, or your favorite food group. For years, professional Web 
designers and developers have been saying that all the good domains are 
gone, which is far from the truth. After all, new Web sites and blogs are 
launched all the time, and many of them have great, memorable domains!
For an example of a great domain name, check out Vanessa Farquharson’s 
blog Green as a Thistle ( www.greenasathistle.com), which documents 
her effort to live a more sustainable lifestyle by doing something “green” 
every day (see Figure 3-1).

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
Think up a phrase or sentence that says something about you and your blog 
as a starting place. Write down your topic keywords onto sticky notes, and 
then move them around and see whether you can stumble on something great.
What exactly does a domain do for you? It has several plusses:
 
✓ Your readers can easily remember your site. Your mom can brag 
about you and send visitors to your blog.
 
✓ Having a domain of your own looks professional; it’s a nice marketing 
benefit at a small cost.
 
✓ You can change Web hosts or hosted blog solutions with impunity 
because your address is actually a separate service. If — or when — you 
move your blog, your Web host can help you use the same domain to 
get to your new server on the Web. 
Your domain should represent your blog’s name and purpose, although at 
the end of the day, there are no hard and fast rules. Here are a few quick 
guidelines that you might want to follow. Try to choose a domain that
 
✓ Matches your blog name
 
✓ Is based on your topic keywords
 
✓ Is a play on words or slang based around your topic
 
✓ Is humorous or memorable
 
If you’re having trouble coming up with a name idea, consider using your 
name. In fact, even if you ultimately want to use another domain for your blog 
address, owning the domain for your own name is a good idea. You can use 
several domain names to reach the same Web site or blog, too, so use your 
own name as a domain might help people find you in search engines.
 
Many online tools can help you choose a domain name if you’re having trouble. 
Domain-name-choosing Web sites help by suggesting word combinations and 
coming up with randomly generated choices. One good site to use for this pur-
pose is Bust a Name (www.bustaname.com), which is shown in Figure 3-2.
 
Even if you end up using a hosted blog solution and therefore don’t need to 
get Web hosting, you can buy a domain and forward the address to your blog. 
This is handy to do because it makes your blog’s address easier to remember. 
After you register your domain, check the Help text of the registrar to find out 
how to forward the domain to your blog’s Web address (URL). Instructions 
vary by registrar.

Registering a domain
Registering a domain is a straightforward process. First, use a domain regis-
trar to buy your name. After you own the name, you just need to point your 
new domain at your Web host. This process basically involves telling your 
domain registrar which Web server your Web site is on; your Web hosting 
company or domain registrar gives you the information and tools to make it 
all work.
You can use many domain registration services. The choice really comes down 
to the domain management interface — the tools that you get in order to manage 
your domain. Some management screens are incredibly difficult to work with. 
Finding a host that has a clean and easy-to-use interface makes a world of 
difference when you’re updating or making changes to your Web domain. Be 
sure to shop around, as well. The annual fee for domain registration varies 
widely, and for the most part, the price differences don’t equal a difference in 
what you’re getting.
You can choose to register for your domain for a single year or for multiple 
years at a time. Typically, registering for multiple years earns you a small 

51
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
discount. If you choose to register for only a year, you need to renew the 
domain in a year (assuming that you want to keep your Web site going). Many 
domain registration companies also offer Web-hosting and e-mail packages.
 
Make sure that you keep your domain registration up to date. If you have any 
changes to your domain or contact information, including your e-mail address, 
update your domain information immediately. If your information isn’t current, 
you could lose access to your domain or miss e-mail reminders to renew your 
domain. Make sure to print a copy of the login information and store it safely.
Visit any of the domain registrars in the following sections to check whether 
your domain is available, and then register it.
Go Daddy
www.godaddy.com
Go Daddy is a popular Web host and domain registrar that provides a long 
list of Web services, including domain hosting, Web hosting, and e-mail 
address hosting. It has a good reputation and is easy to contact if you require 
assistance. A .com domain is priced at $10.69 for a year’s registration.
To register a domain with Go Daddy, follow these steps:
 
1. Point your Web browser to www.godaddy.com.
 
2. Type the domain you’re interested in into the Start a Domain Name 
Search text box.
 
3. Select the suffix that you want to use from the drop-down menu, as 
shown in Figure 3-3.
 
4. Click the Go button.
 
 GoDaddy returns a page indicating whether your domain is available.
 
5. If your domain is available and you want to complete your purchase, 
click the Add and Proceed to Checkout button to add it to your shop-
ping cart.
 
 If your domain is unavailable, scroll down the page to the Search for 
Another Domain text box and try a new name.
 
6. Continue shopping for other domains on GoDaddy or follow the 
instructions for completing the credit card purchase of the domain 
you select.

Network Solutions
www.networksolutions.com
Network Solutions is one of the grand-daddies of all registrars. At one time, 
it was one of the few places you could register a domain. Services are varied 
and flexible, but domains are a little pricey. A .com domain is priced at 
$34.99 for one year of registration.
Domainsatcost.ca
www.domainsatcost.ca
This domain registrar, located in Canada, provides registrations for all major 
domains, including .com and .ca domains. They have a support number 
(long distance applies), and they do answer the telephone — a rarity among 
domain hosts. Domainsatcost.ca is reasonably priced at $12.95 CDN (that’s 
Canadian dollars!) a year.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
Finding Web Hosting
With a domain in hand, you can turn your attention to Web hosting.
If the domain is your address, Web hosting is your actual house on the Web. 
Web hosting provides the Web server where your software, graphics, and 
other files live online. When people use your address — the domain — the 
Web server gives them the pages that they want.
Doing your research
Your primary concern is to find a Web host that has everything your blog 
software needs to run. Because you want to use a blog software package, you 
might have more specific needs than are on offer for a typical Web site.
Most blog software uses a LAMP (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) Web server, 
a mix of several kinds of Web server technology that are ideal for running 
dynamic Web sites such as blogs:
 
✓ Linux: A very common Web server operating system. It’s very stable and 
considered a standard for Web servers. As a blogger, you probably don’t 
need to make too many changes to the operating system, as long as it’s 
in place for you.
 
✓ Apache: Apache is Web-page-serving software, which means it looks at 
what Web page is requested and then feeds the browser the appropriate
file. It does most of the hard work of serving Web pages to visitors 
coming to your Web site.
 
✓ MySQL: MySQL is the most popular database software for blogs. For any 
blogging package, you need some kind of database system to store all 
your blog posts and run the other functionality of the blog software, and 
MySQL is the standard database tool for most blog software.
 
✓ PHP: PHP is the programming language that a lot of blogging and content 
management systems use. It sits between the blogging software and the 
database, making sure all the parts work together.
The preceding four technologies are considered the bare minimum that 
most blogging packages need to function. But you should consider these 
requirements, as well:
 
✓ Disk space: For blogging, disk space is important if you decide to store 
a lot of images on your blog or upload audio and video files. Uploading 
images is relatively easy to do, but you need the space to store those 

54
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
images. For the average blog that has a few photos, you most likely 
want about 500 megabytes (MB). Blogs that have a lot of photos require 
several gigabytes (GB) of disk space. Video blogs need a whole lot more 
disk space (unless you use an online video-sharing service) than text or 
photo blogs, so you want more than 10GB — those files do take up a lot 
of space!
 
 Running out of disk space is an easily solved problem: Most Web hosts 
allow you to add disk space when you need it for an additional cost. Check 
with your Web host to find out what they charge for additional storage.
 
✓ E-mail management: You probably want an e-mail address with your 
new domain. If you want to use your blog for business purposes, having 
an e-mail address that matches your domain looks more professional. 
 
✓ Backups: Consider how you plan to back up your data (including your 
database content) and whether the Web host will also back up the files 
on your Web-hosting account. Knowing this information can save you 
from disaster and data loss in the future. Daily backups aren’t a bad idea!
 
✓ Bandwidth and CPU resources: Computers and networks can take only 
so many visitors and downloads, and hosts usually set a quota on how 
much bandwidth you can use for the particular Web-hosting package that 
you buy. Ask about what happens if you exceed your monthly allowance 
of bandwidth. (Usually, you have to pay for the extra resources.) For 
most bloggers, this won’t be an issue but if you develop a very popular 
blog with lots of visitors, or are serving very large files like videos, band-
width can become an additional cost.
Buying Web hosting
After you purchase your domain, you should be able to pick a Web host just 
as easily. But the reality is that Web host offerings are all over the map, so you 
need to do your research, ask for recommendations from friends and colleagues 
who have Web sites, and compare the details of what different hosts offer.
 
When comparing Web hosts, always confirm the numbers provided in sales 
materials. Here are the top questions to ask a prospective Web host about its 
Web-hosting packages:
 
✓ What’s your reliability and uptime guarantee? Most Web hosts will tell 
you the amount of time in a given month that they guarantee your Web 
site to be available given normal traffic loads — but none of them can 
absolutely guarantee 100% uptime.
 
✓ What’s your data transfer limit, and how much do you charge for addi-
tional bandwidth? Bandwidth/data transfer is used as visitors visit your 
Web site and download pages from your site in order to view them. If 

55
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
you have a lot of files being transferred, or a single file that thousands of 
visitors download, you may hit your limit and need to buy more.
 
✓ How much disk space does the package include, and what do you charge 
for additional space?
 
✓ What kind of technical support do you offer? What are your telephone 
hours? How do you handle e-mail support?
When you find a Web host that interests you, check out the packages on offer. 
Many Web hosts provide a handy comparison chart that you can use to 
quickly compare pricing and features, as Nexcess.net (www.nexcess.net) 
does in Figure 3-4.
The following sections help you get started with your Web-hosting search by 
discussing three top Web-hosting services.
Go Daddy
www.godaddy.com
Go Daddy is a popular Web host — and domain registrar — that provides a long 
list of Web services. Its smallest Web-hosting packages start at around $4.99 
a month.

56
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
For a new blogger just starting out, I recommend the Economy Plan, which 
includes 10GB of disk space and 300GB of bandwidth, in addition to daily 
backups and 24-hour phone and e-mail technical support. You can receive 
discounts if you sign up for a year or more at a time.
Doteasy
www.doteasy.com
Doteasy offers a wide range of Web-hosting solutions for bloggers, including 
hosting. Doteasy offers 24-hour e-mail technical support. Blog-friendly 
Web-hosting options start at $7.95 a month — the cost of the Ultra Hosting 
package, which includes 1000MB of disk space and 20GB of bandwidth per 
month.
Nexcess.net
www.nexcess.net
Nexcess.net is a popular Web-hosting company located in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan. It has quite a few packages and displays them in an easy-to-
compare format. Its e-mail support is extremely fast and effective. Web 
packages start at $9.95 a month.
The Mini Me package sets you up with 5GB of disk space and 15GB of band-
width, and includes daily backups.
Deciding on the Right Blogging Software
No matter where you take your blog, it all starts with one crucial decision: 
what blog software you want to use. Choose wisely, grasshopper, and watch 
your blog software grow while you add more bells and whistles. Pick poorly, 
and be faced with the ultimate chore: migrating your blog from one blog soft-
ware package to a better one. You can do this transfer, but you can’t do it 
easily. Spend the time to find out about the available blogging tools and 
the functionality they provide now so that you can save yourself a lot of 
headaches later.
First, you need to recognize that all blogging platforms aren’t created equal. 
Of course, blogging software packages, whether they’re managed by you or 
by paid Web-hosting technical staff, all share the same or similar functional-
ity that you need for a typical blog. But each software package was designed 
with very different goals in mind.

57
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
Unlike software that you install on a desktop or laptop computer, blogging 
software requires a server environment to function. What a challenge, for a 
non-technical blogger who just wants to start posting, to make a good deci-
sion about Web servers!
Bloggers can use either of two kinds of blogging platforms:
 
✓ Hosted blogs: Hosted blog services provide a unique situation in which 
you don’t need to worry about the software technology at all. You can 
concentrate on worrying about what your next blog post will be about, 
rather than how to configure a Web server. To use hosted blogging soft-
ware, you log in to the editing tool, write a post, click the Publish button, 
and log out.
 
 You don’t need to think about how the software is managed, just as long 
as it’s there the next time you want to post something. Many bloggers 
consider this setup the deal of the century. One popular hosted solution 
is Blogger.com, which I discuss in detail in Chapter 4.
 
 Extra bonus: If you choose hosted software, you don’t have to worry 
about Web hosting — the software company is providing that service for 
you! See the section “Understanding Hosted Blog Software,” later in this 
chapter, for a more in-depth discussion of this option. 
 
 Social networks allow you to connect with current friends and make new 
ones while sharing photos, videos, and text. They’ve exploded in popu-
larity in the last few years, and many of them have added a blogging 
tool. I cover how blogging fits into social networking in Chapter 15.
 
✓ Non-hosted blogs: You might want to run your own blogging system 
right from the beginning. This type of setup is known as non-hosted or 
installable blogging software. By installing blog software on your own 
Web server, you take on all responsibilities related to maintaining the 
blogging software and the data created when you blog. Strictly from a 
technical point of view, this type of setup for a new blog might be a little 
on the difficult side and cause more stress — especially for the nontechni-
cal folks who are figuring things out while they go — but you ultimately 
get more flexibility when you use a non-hosted setup. For example, 
Serious Eats (www.seriouseats.com), a blog that covers food news 
from all over the blogosphere, uses Movable Type, a blogging solution 
that you install on your own server.
 
 Okay, I lied. Hosting your own blog is a lot more difficult than the point-
and-click solution of hosted software. If you love a challenge or want all 
the bells and whistles, however, consider hosting your blog yourself. 
Later in this chapter, the section “Understanding Blog Software That 
You Install on Your Own Server” explains the details of how non-hosted 
blog software works.

58
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Budgeting for software
Many of the hosted services available to new bloggers usually don’t charge 
the user — at least, at the basic level of service. A great number of the non-
hosted blogging software packages are also free, but the Web server that 
you need to install them on most definitely isn’t. How much money you can 
commit to your new blog can help you figure out what platform you should 
acquire.
 
Consider how much financial commitment you want to dedicate to your new 
blogging life. Costs can be associated with
 
✓ Blogging software: Some packages are free; others aren’t. In some cases, 
the blogging software might be free for personal use but can cost money 
if you use it for commercial purposes.
 
✓ Upgrades: When you choose a software package that has a price tag, be 
sure to note the costs for upgrading that software down the line. Blog 
software is in flux, and you’ll need updates!
 
✓ A domain name: Regardless of whether you choose a hosted or non-
hosted solution, you can buy a domain name (also called a Web address) 
and point it at your blog.
 
✓ Web hosting: If you choose a blogging software package that needs to 
be installed on a Web server, you need to find Web hosting.
 
✓ Support costs: If you have questions about your blog software or Web 
hosting, getting answers might cost you. Find out what the support poli-
cies are for both software and hosting before you buy.
 
✓ Web designers: If you need to hire a Web designer or developer to 
produce a design, install the software, and get your blog started, you 
have to pay those folks.
 
✓ Special bells and whistles: You might find that you can purchase and 
use extra add-ons with your blog, from cool functionality to exciting 
designs.
Making sure you get the basics
Each blogging package has a great number of options to choose from. Some 
options are designed to trick out your ride, making your blog into a thing of 
beauty and delight. Some options you absolutely need to have. Good blog-
ging software must have the following features:
 
✓ A usable publishing interface or control panel: Check out how the 
control panel looks before you commit yourself. A good user interface 
is important, and if you can’t make sense of what you see, chances are 
good that you won’t enjoy using the software.

59
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
 
✓ Comments: A blog isn’t a blog unless your readers can leave comments 
on your posts. You don’t have to use the comments, but blogging soft-
ware without comments takes away a vital element of blogging — allow-
ing your readers to cultivate discussions.
 
✓ Spam deterrents: Spam comments are a part of every blog, but that 
doesn’t mean you have to live with them. Like e-mail spam, comment 
spam tends to be an automated process that posts on your blog useless 
information and includes links to all kinds of other sites. Look for blog-
ging software that has functionalities in place to help you moderate and 
block spam.
 
✓ Pinging: A blog software package that uses pinging services is a great 
idea. Pinging is an automated notification system for search engines and 
newsreaders, letting those services know that you’ve updated your blog. 
Because search engines tend to rank “fresh” content highly, letting them 
know when you have new content means that your blog may be more 
likely to appear, and appear higher, in search results. 
 
✓ RSS feeds: If your blog software doesn’t have an RSS feed, move on to dif-
ferent blog software. If you’re at all interested in building traffic to your 
blog, an RSS feed is the single best built-in software feature that you can 
use to meet that goal. An RSS feed is a computer-readable version of your 
blog, standardized so that it can appear in newsreaders and on Web sites 
and blogs. For more information about RSS, read Chapter 13.
I highly recommend two other features, although not all bloggers use them:
 
✓ Categories: Blogs often jump from topic to topic, and categorizing your 
posts gives your readers a quick and easy way to sort through your con-
tent, focusing on what most interests them. The Modern & Contemporary 
Design Blog — MoCo Loco — at www.mocoloco.com uses categories to 
sort blog posts; Figure 3-5 shows the categories in the sidebar to the right.
 
 Categories are high-level organizational tools. For example, a food blog 
might have posts sorted into categories like Vegetarian, Dessert, Main 
Dish, and so on.
 
✓ Tags: A tag is a term associated with a blog post. (For example, when 
I write a blog post about my new cat Maggie, I tag that entry “kitten.”) 
Tagging is a relatively new technology, but it has proven to be one of the 
best ways to sort through blog data quickly. The Cool Hunting blog (www.
coolhunting.com) uses tags in the left column, shown in Figure 3-6.
 
 Tags are like keywords you might use when doing a search on a search 
engine Web site, and they tend to be more specific than categories. A 
blog post on a food blog might use categories as I describe in the pre-
ceding bullet, and then tag individual posts with more specific terms, 
like chocolate, hazelnut, and brownie. To differentiate between catego-
ries and tags, think of categories as describing a group of blog posts, 
and tags as describing individual posts.

Upgrading with bells and whistles
You can implement a number of cool toys on your blog:
 
✓ Trackbacks: Trackbacks are a useful technology that allows bloggers to 
link to blog posts on related topics. If your blog software is trackback-
enabled, you can link to another blog simply by using the URL of the 
original posting. In this automatic process, your blog software lets 
another blogger’s software know that your blog has referenced a post so 
that the software can create a link on the original post.
 
 Trackbacks can also be a source of spam, and as a result, they’re not as 
important in the blogosphere as they used to be. So, although they’re 
nice to have, if the blog software package that you want to use doesn’t 
offer trackbacks, don’t automatically eliminate that software from 
consideration.
 
✓ News aggregation: One of the handiest features of blogging software is 
the ability to aggregate news by using RSS feeds. Having a news aggrega-
tor included with your blog package allows your site to pull in information 
from other blogs. You can then provide this information to your readers, 
offering them content from other sources.

✓ Spam blacklist: Most blogging packages have some kind of blacklist 
protection against spam comments. These blacklists are often central-
ized lists of e-mail addresses, URLs, and IP addresses that spammers 
use, which the blog software prevents from commenting in any blog 
post on your blog. With an up-to-date blacklist, you can stop a lot of 
spam before it becomes a comment.
 
✓ Spam whitelist: Some blogging software includes the ability to use a 
whitelist, in which you preselect the users that can comment. Spam-
filtering systems and blog user accounts are quickly replacing this type 
of system, however.
 
✓ CAPTCHAs: CAPTCHAs are images that display letters and/or numbers 
that a person can read but a machine can’t. When someone wants to 
leave a comment on a post, he or she must correctly type these letter/
number combinations into a comment field, which proves to the blog 
software that the commenter is indeed a human and not a computer 
spam system. This process blocks out the comment spam and lets through 
the valuable feedback. Variations on CAPTCHAs include simple math prob-
lems that a user needs to solve in order to post a comment. Jared Flood’s 
Brooklyn Tweed blog (http://brooklyntweed.blogspot.com) uses 
CAPTCHAs, as shown in Figure 3-7.

You can tie together more and more Web services these days, from your 
photos on Flickr, to your Twitter updates, to your . . . well, you have a lot of 
possibilities. Some blog software allows you to automate those kinds of con-
nections, so if that interests you, keep an eye out for software with these fea-
tures. I walk you through some possibilities in Chapter 15.
Understanding Hosted Blog Software
Hosted services take a whole lot of responsibility off the blogger. The blog 
software company manages the data, software, and Web hosting; the blog-
ger manages the content. Some services, such as Blogger, do it all for free, 
whereas other services, such as TypePad, charge a monthly fee to run your 
blog. Yet other services, such as WordPress, offer a level of free service 
with the option to upgrade when your blogging requires a little more power. 
Hosted blog software allows you to make someone responsible for the entire 
gauntlet of technical tasks that don’t excite you.
 
Seasoned blogging veterans recommend that new bloggers start by using a 
hosted service that’s free. The reason is simple: If you find the idea of having 
a blog appealing, but you haven’t ever tried blogging or played with blogging 
software, you might not like it all that much in reality. So, an expert — say, the 

63
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
one writing this book — tells newbie bloggers to take a free blogging service 
for a test drive before committing a lot of time or money.
After all, actually sitting down and running a full- or part-time blog is a whole 
lot of work. If writing turns out not to be your cup of tea, using a free service 
for a while means that you haven’t poured much money down the drain to 
find that out.
Reaping the benefits
An upfront cost of zero is very attractive to new bloggers. If you want access 
to blog technology and have a limited budget (not to mention all those other 
annoying budget commitments, such as food and rent), free looks just about 
perfect. Not all hosted software is free, but they generally have quite reason-
able costs. A hosted blog that charges a monthly fee is still cheaper than 
most monthly cell phone plans, about on par with a newspaper subscription.
But free or inexpensive isn’t the only upside to hosted blog services. They 
really take the complication out of starting a blog. For the technophobe, a 
hosted solution is ideal because you have very few technical issues to worry 
about. Hosted services take care of
 
✓ Web domains
 
✓ Software maintenance and updates
 
✓ Data storage and backup
 
✓ Template design and management
Hosted solutions are also generally quicker to set up than software you have 
to install on your own server, so you can start blogging sooner when you 
choose one of these solutions.
Updates are generally free, and the software is available to the enduser 24 
hours a day and seven days a week. Sounds like a really good deal, huh?
Living with the limitations
Before you sign yourself up, be sure you understand the tradeoffs that come 
with using a hosted blog service. Ultimately, you don’t control your own blog. 
If the company goes out of business, takes servers down for maintenance, or 
decides to change its offerings, you’re pretty much stuck with the results.
A free hosted solution, for example, might suddenly decide it should start 
charging; one that already charges can always raise its rates.

64
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Most hosted solutions let users make some modifications and tweaks, but 
you can’t install your own plug-ins and extras; in many cases, the level of 
customization is quite limited. With hosted blog software, that ubiquitous 
WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) acronym is a double-edged sword: 
You can’t actually do more with less.
 
If you blog on behalf of a company or business, you might want to cross a 
hosted solution off your list for a couple of reasons:
 
✓ You probably need to make your blog part of an existing Web site, inte-
grated into the look and feel of the company brand; hosted blogs don’t 
allow this customization or integration.
 
✓ With a business blog, you need control of the data. Putting the blog on 
your own server removes any doubts about security or data ownership.
 
When you think about whether to use a hosted solution, be sure you under-
stand the terms of service of that host. Some hosts reserve the right to cancel 
or remove your blog or blog posts.
Make sure to read all the fine print for the host that you want to use! You don’t 
want to run into legal restrictions that mean you can’t actually use your blog 
the way you want to, and you definitely don’t want to suddenly find your blog 
missing if the hosted software company decides you’re in violation of its rules.
Choosing hosted software
In the following sections, you can take a look at some of the most popular 
hosted platforms to see which might be the best fit for you and your new blog. 
These blogging software packages have been around for quite a while and are 
regarded as some of the best that the blogging community has to offer.
Blogger
www.blogger.com
Blogger is the quintessential hosted blogging platform. Started in 1999 at Pyra 
Labs, Blogger weathered the rough Internet waters at the turn of the century 
to become the most well-known hosted blogging platform. The Blogger ser-
vice became incredibly popular, and eventually, Google purchased it. Since 
then, Blogger has introduced many new features and remained one of the 
premier blogging platforms. Blogger has many features that allow bloggers to 
publish multiple blogs:
 
✓ All blogs are free and hosted for you, with no hassles and no mess.
 
✓ Blogger offers a wide variety of free templates to get you going, which 
you can customize in a number of ways.

65
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
 
✓ The publishing tool now has Google AdSense (a blog advertising program) 
and other neat elements, such as polls and lists, integrated into it, allowing 
you to add functionality to your blog.
 
✓ If you don’t want Blogger to host your files, you can save all your 
blogging files to another server.
 
I show you how to get Blogger set up in Chapter 4. Because you can use it so 
easily and set it up quickly (and because it’s free), I encourage all new blog-
gers to use Blogger as a learning tool, even if you plan to use other blog soft-
ware for your real blog.
WordPress.com
www.wordpress.com
In 2005, the popular WordPress blogging platform launched a hosted service, 
in addition to software that you can install on your own server. WordPress.
com, as shown in Figure 3-8, offers a clean, easy-to-use interface, and blog-
gers tend to see it as more flexible than anything else on the market. Now 
that WordPress.com has added new functionality and additional themes, you 
can set it up very quickly.
In short, Wordpress.com
 
✓ Is free to use
 
✓ Has many options for design templates, letting you choose a look that 
suits your content
 
✓ Includes features such as tags and categories, permitting easy organization 
of your posts
 
✓ Offers spellchecking, rich-text editing, and photo uploading
 
✓ Lets you measure your site traffic and statistics to help gauge your 
popularity
 
✓ Integrates an excellent spam-fighting tool, Akismet
TypePad

TypePad was launched in 2003 to great fanfare. It allows you to do more 
than just blog; it was one of the first blogging platforms to offer the ability 
to create static content pages. TypePad pricing starts at $4.95 a month and 
ranges upward, depending on the services that you want to include.

Understanding Blog Software That 
You Install on Your Own Server
If technology freaks you out, you can make life easier by using hosted solu-
tions, but bloggers who require more flexibility than hosted solutions offer 
may choose non-hosted blogging packages. Configuring software to your own 
tastes and requirements can really improve the overall quality of your blog, 
making it more attractive to readers and ultimately more successful.

67
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
 
Flexibility can make or break your blog. If you have the money and the skills to 
install your own blog software, doing so can give you better tools and control 
over your blog, enabling you to do things like customize the design, add third-
party widgets for serving ads, or dabble in customizing the publishing interface.
Choosing a non-hosted blog isn’t a plug-and-play solution. Unfortunately, choos-
ing to install blog software, rather than to use a hosted service, means that 
you need a whole bunch of other technical services to make it all work.
Reaping the benefits
If you use non-hosted blog software, you’re in full control — you can do just 
about anything to the software after you install it:
 
✓ Design personalization: For those who have Web design skills, stand-
alone blogs generally are very adaptable. Some blogs have incredibly 
diverse and clever designs, many created by the author of the blog 
to match the style and topic of the blog. Installing the software on 
your Web server gives you access to every part of the blog software’s 
innards, from templates to graphics, so you can make your blog as 
pretty as a picture. Or tough. Very tough.
 
✓ Customization: A lot of the blogging software available is open source 
(meaning the code for the software package is available to developers 
so that they can manipulate it). Programmers can add, remove, update, 
and improve functionality for each package. Some packages offer many 
different options, and independent programmers might also offer addi-
tional functionality either for free or a low cost.
 
✓ Looking smart: The blogging world has social divisions, just like any 
other, and at the top of the blogging heap, you find geeks. If you want 
to play with the cool nerds, you need to install your own blog software. 
Technical bloggers will recognize your prowess and give you props.
Living with the limitations
The first stumbling block you discover when installing your own blogging 
software, is . . . installing your own blogging software. Somehow, you have to 
get the software files onto your server, run the scripts, modify the code, and 
generally muck about in the ugly innards of the software. This process can 
either be simple or a complete nightmare, depending on your technical savvy 
and the complexity of the blog software package that you choose.

68
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
 
You can shortcut this issue by choosing a Web-hosting company that offers 
blogging software. Most blogging software companies provide a list of Web hosts 
who have in-house expertise in handling their software; just browse around on 
the software company’s Web site to find that list. You can also have the blogging 
software company install the software for you. For a fairly reasonable fee, you 
can put that job into the hands of an expert. This solution makes sense for one 
big reason: You need to install the software only once. If you don’t already know 
how to do it yourself, you don’t have to spend hours beating your head against a 
wall to obtain knowledge you’ll probably never need again.
Of course, all software requires some level of maintenance, and most Web 
hosts don’t handle software upgrades and tweaks; be prepared to handle 
those requirements when they come up by doing them yourself or finding an 
expert who can handle them for you.
Using non-hosted software has some other downsides, as well:
 
✓ Design personalization and code customization: Making your blog look 
pretty sounds great, but you need a cornucopia of associated skills to 
make that happen — everything from graphic design to HTML coding. If 
you don’t have these skills yourself or access to someone who does, you 
don’t actually have the ability to customize your blog, despite your 
software.
 
✓ Domain registration and Web hosting: Unlike the hosted systems, you 
can’t avoid spending money to host your own blog software. Several 
costs automatically kick in, such as domain name registration and Web 
hosting (explained in the sections “Registering a Domain” and “Finding 
Web Hosting,” earlier in this chapter).
 
✓ Technical support: Even if you pay to get the blog software installed for 
you or sign up with a Web host that does it automatically, if the software 
breaks (and doesn’t all software break at some point?), many Web hosts 
can’t or won’t fix it.
 
✓ Backing up: If you install your own software, you’re responsible for 
making sure that the software and data get backed up or for finding a 
Web host that includes backups as part of the hosting package.
Choosing non-hosted blogging software
If you’re ready to make the leap into the deep end of the blogging pool, the 
following sections give you recommendations for a range of well-respected 
non-hosted blogging tools.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
Movable Type
www.movabletype.com
Movable Type is the grandfather of all installable blogging platforms. Released 
in 2001, it quickly became one of the most popular blogging software pack-
ages, for geeks and pundits alike. Movable Type was the first blogging soft-
ware that permitted contributions by multiple authors, and bloggers highly 
regard it for the many ways that you can leverage it to create easily update-
able Web sites and blogs.
If you’re serious about looking at hosting your own installation, Moveable 
Type is a strong contender. Movable Type offers
 
✓ A WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing environment that 
saves you time and effort
 
✓ Easy tools for categorizing your posts, inserting photos and multimedia, 
and spellchecking
 
✓ Automatic generation of RSS feeds to give your blog longevity
 
✓ Searchable content, tags, and other cool tools
 
✓ A range of licensing options for personal, commercial, and educational use
Pricing varies, but the basic commercial installation is $395.95, and you may 
qualify to use the free Blogger license if you are an individual blogger and not 
setting up a blog for an organization or business.
WordPress
www.wordpress.org
Since 2003, WordPress has provided a solid platform for new and experienced 
bloggers who want the control of installing blog software on their own com-
puter. Many bloggers say that WordPress is the easiest blogging platform (aside 
from hosted blogging software) to set up and configure. I cover installing and 
using WordPress in Chapter 5.
 
The interface acts exactly the way the hosted WordPress.com system works, so 
if you’re considering using WordPress, sign up for a test blog on WordPress.
com to get a good preview of how WordPress works.
Here are some of the highlights:
 
✓ WordPress is free!
 
✓ It offers many, many user-submitted and -prepared designs, ready for use.

70
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
 
✓ It includes tags and categories, allowing you to organize your posts easily.
 
✓ It has editing tools (such as spellchecking), offers common text styles, 
and gives you easy ways to include photos, videos, and other media.
 
✓ It displays statistics about your visitors to help you understand the traf-
fic to your blog.
 
✓ It fights spam with a range of antispam tools.
ExpressionEngine
www.expressionengine.com
Back in 2001, a company called pMachine released a blogging software pack-
age called pMachine Pro. pMachine Pro quietly hatched a following based on 
pMachine’s clean interface, solid performance, and flexibility in both design 
and layout. From that success, pMachine built the content management 
system and blogging software ExpressionEngine, an exceptionally powerful 
platform.
Today, pMachine (now known as EllisLab) supports all kinds of sites by using 
ExpressionEngine, which it offers in both commercial and personal flavors. 
Like Movable Type, ExpressionEngine is highly regarded by Web developers 
because it offers great blogging tools, but it’s flexible enough to be used to 
develop all kinds of Web sites — not just blogs.
ExpressionEngine users have
 
✓ The ability to run multiple blogs that have many contributors
 
✓ A powerful templating engine
 
✓ Additional modules and community plug-ins, including mailing lists, 
forums, and photo galleries
 
✓ Strong comment moderation and prevention tools
 
✓ Different levels of user access, allowing administrators to control what 
blogs and templates users can edit
ExpressionEngine’s commercial license runs you $249.95, the non-profit/per-
sonal version is $99.95, and you can use a free option if you forego technical 
support.
Installing blog software
After you purchase your domain and Web hosting, you can get into the nitty 
gritty technical tasks: installing your blog software. To get started, look for 
installation instructions on your blog software company’s Web site. Each 

71
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
blogging package has a set of instructions for doing the job yourself and 
details about hiring company technical support to do the job for you.
 
Keep in mind that installing blog software is a one-time task! When you finish, 
you don’t ever need to do it again, and you probably don’t need the skills nec-
essary to install the software in order to use your blog.
Unfortunately, the steps that you need to take to install a particular blog 
application vary dramatically from software to software, so I can’t give you 
detailed step-by-step directions. Each blog software package has its own 
particular requirements for installation, but the general process follows 
these steps:
 
1. Download the latest version of your blogging software.
 
2. Uncompress the package and upload it to your new Web host by using 
FTP (file transfer protocol).
 
3. Execute the installation application associated with your software.
To make your installation experience as trouble-free as possible, watch out 
for the following common problems:
 
✓ File location: When you upload your blog package, make sure that you 
upload it to the correct location. All Web hosts tell you where to place 
your Web files and software so that visitors can find your blog. If you 
put your files in the wrong place, no one can access your blog.
 
✓ Database requirements: Sometimes, you need to create a database prior 
to installing your blog software. Each Web host has a different procedure 
for creating a database, so if your installation instructions mention this 
requirement, consult the Web host documentation or support materials 
to find out how to set things up properly.
Sound like gibberish? The truth is that almost anyone can use blogging 
software, but only quite technically advanced computer users can install it 
themselves. If you’re a Web designer or developer, you may be able to install 
the software yourself. If you aren’t technical but want to be, this project gives 
you the chance to really get your hands dirty.
However, if tech stuff makes you cringe, you can investigate having someone 
else install the software — my main advice is to find a professional:
 
✓ Web designers: Many people who build Web sites for a living can help 
would-be bloggers get blogging software installed and running. Of 
course, you need to pay these folks for their time, so shop around for 
several quotes to get the best deal.

72
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
 
✓ Blogging software companies: The best blogging software companies 
offer inexpensive solutions to this problem: They install the software for 
you on your own Web site. Check with the blogging software company 
to see whether it offers this service.
 
✓ Web-hosting companies: Some Web hosts install software for you if you 
ask (and pay them), and some even offer a one-click installation. These one-
click installations can save bloggers from headaches, pain, and midnight 
crying sessions. You just click a button to install the desired blogging 
software on your Web server. If this option sounds appealing, check 
with the Web host you’re eyeing before you sign up to see whether it 
offers one-click blog software installations.
 
Many of the blogging software companies have figured out that installing blog 
software creates a real barrier to the nontechnical customer. As a result, you 
can often go to a blogging software company’s Web site and find a list of 
Web-hosting companies that offer one-click installation for a particular 
blogging platform.

Part II

Your Blog

In this part . . .
E
nough chitchat? Ready to get going right now? I’m 
with you. Part II is all about getting your hands dirty, 
starting with Chapter 4, where I get you started with a tool 
called Blogger. I kid you not; you can set up a blog and 
start posting within about 10 minutes. Blogger isn’t the 
only tool around, of course. Chapter 5 introduces you to a 
great piece of blog software you install on your own Web 
server: WordPress. And in Chapter 6 you have fun with 
micro blogs — if you really, really don’t have much time 
to spend on a blog, this extremely short format style 
might be just the ticket.

Chapter 4
Starting a Blogger Blog
In This Chapter
▶ Signing up with Blogger to get started
▶ Writing, publishing, and viewing your first blog post
▶ Managing your blog settings
▶ Customizing your blog template to match your style
P
art of the beauty of a blog is how quickly and easily you can get going. 
You can go from zero to blog in about ten minutes by using good blog 
software, especially if you go with hosted blog software, such as Blogger, 
which is the focus of this chapter. I show you how to set up a blog with 
Blogger, write and publish blog posts by using its interface, manage your set-
tings, and customize your template to make your space on the Web unique.
If you’re unfamiliar with hosted blog software versus server-based software, 
flip to Chapter 3 for an introduction to blog software. In Chapter 5, you can 
find an introduction to WordPress, which offers both hosted and server-
based blogging software. And in Chapter 6 you can learn about micro blog-
ging, a short format blog style.
Starting a Blog with Blogger
You can’t find a better place to get introduced to blogging than Blogger 
(www.blogger.com). It’s free, fast, and easy to use. Because you can get 
started so easily, you can use Blogger to play with code and discover how 
blogging works without having to invest a lot of time and energy in Web serv-
ers and complicated installation processes.
Blogger promises to get you blogging in three steps: Create an account, name 
your blog, and choose a template.
 
Each hosted blog software platform has a different process for getting started, 
but each one requires the same kind of information: your contact information 
and a name for your blog.

76
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Creating an account
Before signing up with Blogger, you need login information (a username and 
password), which you can get in a couple of ways:
 
✓ Through a Google account: If you have an account with one of Google’s 
services, such as Gmail, you can log in to Blogger by using that account 
information. (Blogger was acquired by the popular search engine com-
pany Google in 2002.)
 
✓ Through Blogger: If you don’t have a Google account, you get one when 
you sign up with Blogger.
To sign up for Blogger when you don’t have a Google account, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create Your Blog Now button on the Blogger home page 
(www.blogger.com).
 
2. Type your e-mail address in the Email Address field.
 
3. Choose a password and type it in the Enter a Password field.
 
 When you type your password, Blogger indicates whether you need to 
increase the password strength — meaning how difficult it would be for 
someone to guess your password. Click the Password Strength link for 
more information about creating a more secure password.
 
4. Retype the password in the Retype Password field.
 
5. Type the name that you want to associate with your blog in the 
Display Name field.
 
6. Unselect the Email Notifications box if you don’t want to receive 
e-mails from Blogger.
 
 If you do want to receive these e-mails, leave the box checked.
 
7. Type in the Word Verification field the word shown as an image.
 
8. Select the Acceptance of Terms check box.
 
 You can read the Terms of Service to see what you’re agreeing to by 
clicking the Terms of Service link.
 
9. Click Continue and move on to the following section in this chapter.
To sign up for Blogger by using an existing Google account, follow these steps:
 
1. Type your Google account username and password into the appropri-
ate fields on the Blogger home page (www.blogger.com).

77
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
 
2. Click Sign In.
 
 The Blogger Dashboard appears.
 
3. Click the Create a Blog link in the Dashboard, and then check out the 
following section in this chapter.
Naming your blog
When you have a Blogger account set up, you can choose a name for your 
blog. If you’re creating a blog that you really plan to use (rather than just 
test, a topic that I discuss in Chapter 3), give a lot of thought to the name 
that you choose. Your blog name needs to accurately portray your blog’s 
tone and content. If you plan to use this blog as a test space, don’t worry 
too much about choosing a name that has a lot of meaning, but be sure you 
choose something that you can remember!
To name your Blogger blog, follow these steps:
 
1. Type the name of the blog in the Blog Title field.
 
 You can type about 50 characters in this field.
 
2. Decide what phrase you want to use in your URL and type it in the 
Blog Address field.
 
 A URL (uniform resource locator) is better known as a Web address. To 
open your blog, visitors type this address into the address bar of their 
Web browsers. You can use any work or phrase that you want as a URL, 
as long as someone else isn’t using it, but you probably want to keep it 
short, sweet, and memorable so that others can get to your blog quickly 
and easily. You can’t use spaces or punctuation, except dashes, in 
your URL.
 
 You can type about 35 characters in this field.
 
3. Click the Check Availability link to see whether the Web address you 
want to use is available. If it isn’t, type a new phrase into the Blog 
Address field and try again.
 
 You might have to make several tries to find an available blog address — 
Blogger is popular!
 
4. Type in the Word Verification field the word shown as an image.
 
5. Click Continue.
 
 You can now proceed to the Choose a Template phase of the setup, 
covered in the following section.

78
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Choosing a template
One of the fun features of Blogger allows you to choose from a number of 
templates for your blog. The template determines both the look and feel of 
your blog, and also how the blog elements appear on the page. Blogger has 
fun templates to choose from, and don’t forget that you can customize or 
change the template later if your first choice no longer looks as fresh in six 
months. (For more info, see the “Customizing Your Template” section, later 
in this chapter.)
To choose a template during the initial setup of your blog, follow these steps:
 
1. Use the scrollbar to scroll through the available templates in the 
Choose a Template screen (see Figure 4-1).
 
 These steps are a continuation from the preceding section. If you want 
to change your template without going through the preceding steps, you 
can pick a new template from the Layout area of the Blogger Dashboard.
 
 The previews on this page give you an idea of how your blog would look 
if you used the various templates.
 
Figure 4-1: 
You can 
preview 
the Blogger 
templates 
when you 
start a 
new blog.
 

79
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
 
2. When you find something intriguing, click the Preview Template link 
below the thumbnail.
 
 A larger image of the template opens in a new browser window so that 
you can take a closer look. Close the preview window when you finish.
 
 You can preview as many or as few templates as you want by using the 
corresponding Preview Template links.
 
3. After you decide on a template, select the radio button below the tem-
plate of your choice.
 
4. Click Continue.
 
 Blogger displays a screen confirming that it has created your blog, and 
it presents a Start Blogging link that you can click to add an entry to 
your blog.
 
After you complete this setup process, you don’t need to repeat it when you 
want to add a post to your blog. The next time you come to Blogger, simply 
use the login boxes in the top-right corner of the home page to log in and get 
started posting to your blog.
Writing a Post
You officially join the blogosphere by writing your very first blog post, an entry, 
for your new blog. (The blogosphere, by the way, is the semi-ironic way that 
bloggers refer to themselves, their blogs, and the phenomena that is blogging 
today. You’re a member of the blogosphere when you have a blog, regardless 
of whether you think it’s the dumbest word you’ve heard this year.)
The mechanics of writing a blog post aren’t much different from writing an 
e-mail. Bloggers usually make most posts quite short, and they write those 
posts directly and conversationally. Of course, you might decide to use your 
blog to write the next Great American Novel, in which case, your posts might 
be quite a bit longer than what’s standard! That’s fine, too. Every blog takes 
on a personality and life of its own. If you want to find your own narrative 
voice for your blog, go to Chapter 7.
 
If you’ve used a Web-based e-mail service such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo!, 
the Blogger software feels very familiar. To create the post, you simply have 
to fill in the appropriate fields in a form, format the text, and then send it off to 
its destination — in this case, to your blog, rather than a friend’s e-mail inbox.

80
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Follow these steps to write a blog post on Blogger:
 
1. Go to the publishing screen.
 
 If you just finished signing up for your blog, as described in the section 
“Starting a Blog with Blogger,” earlier in this chapter, click the Start 
Blogging link to start a blog post; the publishing screen appears, as 
shown in Figure 4-2.
 
 If you took a break and are coming back to Blogger, log in. After you do, 
Blogger takes you to the Dashboard — a kind of control panel showing you 
the blogs that you have set up and giving you access to tools that let you 
post, find help resources, or even create another blog. Click the New Post 
link on the Dashboard to get to the Publishing screen shown in Figure 4-2.

2. Enter a title for your post in the Title field.
 
 Titles are a lot like newspaper headlines: They should be catchy and 
informative, and they should encourage visitors to your blog to continue 
reading the rest of the post.
 
3. Write your post in the large field.
 
 Consider writing your blog posts in a standard word-processing program, 
such as Notepad or Microsoft Word — and then saving that post. Too 
many bloggers have spent hours composing right in the entry field of 
their blog software, only to find that their Internet connection has failed 
or another technical problem has occurred — which results in a lost 
post. You don’t want to lose all your carefully considered prose just 
because your cat pulled the cable modem out of the wall! Blogger does 
have an Auto Save feature installed, but it’s still safer to compose offline, 
and then simply copy and paste the text into the blog software.
 
4. Format your post.
 
 Blogger’s entry field includes icons across the top that let you change 
the font style and font size, apply bold and italic to text, and create 
common formatting styles, such as lists. To use these features, select 
the text in the field that you want to modify by clicking and dragging 
over the text; then, click the appropriate icon or select an option from 
the desired drop-down list.
 
If you know how to write HTML code, you can also try composing your post in 
the Edit HTML mode. Click the Edit HTML tab and include HTML tags in your 
text, as needed. If you want to find out more about coding HTML, I discuss 
common tags in Appendix B.
Adding a link
The Link icon — the small globe icon that has a link of chain on top of it 
(refer to Figure 4-2) — deserves special attention. You use this icon when-
ever you want to link to another blog, a news story, that embarrassing Web 
site that your best friend just created, or any other page on the Web.
When you want to create a clickable link in your blog post, follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the text that you want to make clickable by clicking and 
dragging.
 
2. Click the Link icon.
 
 A pop-up window appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
3. Enter the URL of the Web site to which you want to link and click OK.

82
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
Figure 4-3: 
Using the 
Link icon to 
create 
clickable 
text in your 
blog post.
 
 
 Include the full URL of the Web page in this field. Don’t delete the 
http:// that’s prefilled in the form for you. The URL you use should 
look like this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssinian_(cat)
 
 And not this:
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssinian_(cat)
 
 You can most easily make sure that you have the right link by going to 
the Web page to which you want to link, copy the URL from the address 
bar (press Ctrl+C to copy and then Ctrl+V to paste; on a Mac, use Ô 
rather than Ctrl).
 
 After you click OK, the linked text appears as underlined blue text in 
your post. But it doesn’t become clickable until you publish it.
 
Don’t forget that if you know HTML and would prefer to create the link 
manually by using HTML code, you can do so from the Edit HTML tab.
Spellchecking your text
Blogger provides a handy tool for anyone who needs help with spelling (and 
who doesn’t?). After you finish writing your post, click the Check Spelling 
icon. It’s the icon that shows the letters ABC with a checkmark below them 
(refer to Figure 4-2).
Blogger highlights incorrectly spelled words in yellow. Click any misspelled 
word to see a list of suggested alternatives, as shown in Figure 4-4. Select any 
suggestion from the list or simply type your own correction.

83
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
 
Figure 4-4: 
Blogs don’t 
have to be

(they just 
often are).
 
Including an image
You can make your blog post more appealing by including an image. Longtime 
bloggers can tell you that adding a photo or artwork encourages visitors 
to read more of the surrounding text. And, of course, everyone knows how 
many words that photo is worth!
Blogger has some good built-in tools that allow you to upload an image that’s 
already the right size and format for displaying on the Web. If you need help 
formatting photographs from a digital camera or another source, Chapter 10 
shows you how.
Follow these steps to upload an image from your computer and add it to your 
blog post:
 
1. Click the Add Image icon.
 
 It looks like a photograph (refer to Figure 4-2).
 
 The Upload Images window opens.
 
 Most Web browsers block pop-up browser windows from opening. If you 
click the Add Image icon and nothing happens, go into your browser 
settings to turn off this protection. In some browsers, you can block 
pop-ups from certain Web sites, rather than all sites, so you can choose 
to allow Blogger to open a particular pop-up window without subjecting 
yourself to other annoying pop-ups. Consult your browser’s Help menu 
if you need assistance with its pop-up–blocking feature.
 
2. Click the Browse button in the Add an Image from Your Computer 
section of the page.
 
 A File Upload dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-5.

84
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
3. Locate the image that you want to upload from your computer and 
select it.
 
4. Click Open.
 
 The location of the image is inserted into the image field.
 
Figure 4-5: 
Using 
Blogger, you 
can upload 
an image 
from your 
desktop and

5. Choose a layout and image size from the options provided.
 
 Here are the options you get:
 
• Layout: Determines how text wraps around the image. You can 
choose None, Left, Center, or Right.
 
• Image size: Determines how large the display of the image is in 
your blog post, regardless of the dimensions of the source image. 
You can choose Small, Medium, or Large.
 
6. Click the Upload Image button.
 
 Blogger uploads your image and inserts it into your blog post; the 
Upload Images window closes.
 
You can also add an image to your post from another Web site, as long as you 
have permission to use the image or it’s in the public domain. (Read more 
about copyright in Chapter 8.) You can add an image from a site easily by 
using Blogger. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Find an image or photo on the Web that you want to use.
 
 Make sure that you’re allowed to use it by checking copyright permission 
or asking the creator.

85

2. Right-click the image and select Copy Image Location from the menu 
that opens.
 
 Phrasing of this option may differ in different browsers. If you don’t see 
anything that looks right, choose Properties from the menu. A window 
opens that shows you the URL address, which you can then click and 
drag to highlight. Press Ctrl+C to copy the address (Ô+C on a Mac).
 
3. Head back to Blogger and start a new post, or open one that you’ve 
already created.
 
4. Click the Add Image icon.
 
 It looks like a photograph (refer to Figure 4-2).
 
 The Upload Images window opens.
 
5. Press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to paste the image address into the URL 
field on the right of the window.
 
6. Choose a layout and image size from the options provided.
 
 Here are the options you can choose from:
 
• Layout: Determines how text wraps around the image. You can 
choose None, Left, Center, or Right.
 
• Image size: Determines the dimensions of the image as it appears 
in your blog post, regardless of how big the source image is. You 
can choose Small, Medium, or Large.
 
7. Click the Upload Image button.
 
 Blogger uploads your image and inserts it into your blog post; the 
Upload Images window closes.
Publishing Your Post
When you’re satisfied with your blog post, you can publish it so that the 
world can admire your erudition. Publishing a post isn’t hard: Click the 
orange Publish Post button at the bottom of the page. Your post appears on 
your blog, making it available for others to read.
Before you publish, you can take advantage of three areas of the Blogger Publish 
page that I find very helpful: previewing, saving as a draft, and selecting post 
options.

86
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Previewing your post
Before you publish, you can preview what you’ve created by clicking the 
Preview link (found on the far right of the editing icons). This preview is 
WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), which means that it shows you 
the post exactly as you formatted it, including links, text colors, embedded 
images, and so on.
 
I like to preview my post before I publish because I can more easily read for 
meaning and content at this point. Think of the preview as a last chance to 
catch grammar problems or even to think twice about what you’re posting if 
it’s controversial. Of course, you can also see how the text and content flow 
around any images that you’ve added.
If you see changes that you want to make, simply click the Hide Preview link 
to go back to the editing screen.
Saving as a draft
Many bloggers like to create posts in advance of when they plan to publish 
them. For example, if you’re planning a vacation, you can write several posts 
before you leave. When you put them into Blogger, click the Save as Draft 
button, rather than the Publish button. Clicking the Save as Draft button sets 
the status of the post to draft, and even though you can access it via the 
Blogger Dashboard, it doesn’t appear on your blog until you go back into the 
post and click the Publish Post button.
 
When you create a post, Blogger automatically saves it once a minute, so 
you may not have to click Save as Draft if you want to keep a post as a draft. 
Clicking the Save as Draft button, however, ensures that the saved version is 
the latest one.
Setting post options
Below the entry text and just above the Publish Post button, you can see a 
Post Options link. Click this link to open a menu.
You can choose whether you want readers to be able to comment on your 
blog post by selecting the Allow or Don’t Allow radio button. You can actually 
choose from two Don’t Allow options: The first keeps already-posted comments 
visible, even though no one can add new comments; the second hides (but 
doesn’t delete) already-posted comments.

87
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
 
You can make the decision to turn off comments at any time, so if you decide 
later that you don’t want to receive further comments, you can always edit the 
entry and turn off this option then.
Most of the time, you want to allow comments; after all, part of what makes 
a blog exciting to read is the opportunity to interact with the blogger. 
Sometimes, though, you might write an entry that you don’t want to read 
discussion about, perhaps because you don’t want to start a long argument 
or because the entry has become a target of spammers. You can find more 
about interacting with your reading community and preventing spam in 
Chapter 9.
You can also set the publication date and time that appears on the post. By 
default, Blogger sets the publication date and time of the entry to the date 
and time that you began writing that entry. However, you have the power to 
alter the date and time.
You might choose to change the date or time for a number of reasons:
 
✓ Social or professional reasons:
 
• Create a blog post for a friend’s birthday and make the date match 
the time your friend was born.
 
• If you’re blogging at work, you might want to set your date and 
time to a period when you weren’t supposed to also be at your 
desk (ahem) working. Chapter 2 discusses blogging and workplace 
issues in detail (and recommends that you don’t blog at work, 
unless that’s part of your job responsibility).
 
✓ To work around your schedule:
 
• If you take a long time to write a post, by the time you’re ready to 
publish it, you might need to put a more realistic time on the entry.
 
• If you save your post as a draft and publish it later, you can update 
the date and time to accurately reflect the real publication date.
In Blogger, you can easily change the date and/or time by typing the new 
figures in the same format on the post publishing page.
 
If you’re writing a post that you want to publish in the future, simply set the 
date and time for that future. Even after you click the Publish Post button, 
Blogger doesn’t put the post on your blog until the date and time that you 
specified.

88
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Viewing Your Blog Post
After you publish, you can see how your post looks on the blog. You may find 
this step rewarding — and you definitely don’t want to skip it. Even if you 
preview your post before publishing, you haven’t seen your post in the way 
that your readers see it. You can do that only by actually going to your blog 
as it appears to everyone on the Web and taking a look.
You need to view your post for another reason, too: Computers can still make 
errors or fail between the moment you click Publish and when the entry 
shows up on the blog. I like to look at my blog every time I post a new entry 
to make sure that it actually looks right on the page and that the blog soft-
ware successfully processed it.
When you click Blogger’s Publish button, the system provides you with a 
handy link to view your blog. Click View Blog to head over to your blog and 
see your handiwork.
Of course, if you prefer taking the long way, you can always type the Web 
address (the one that you chose when you set up your blog) into the Web 
browser to see your blog without going through the Blogger Dashboard.
 
While you look at your blog, make sure the formatting, images, and text look 
the way that you want them to and click any links that you created. If anything 
doesn’t work quite properly, go back into Blogger and make changes to 
your entry.
Selecting the Dashboard Settings
Blog software, as a rule, is quite customizable. As the owner of the blog, you 
can decide a number of things about the way your blog looks and works, and 
you can control those elements from the control panel — called the Dashboard 
in Blogger — of your blog software.
Most blog software packages work quite similarly, and if you know how 
Blogger works, you can make the most of any other software.
Blogger divides its settings into several areas: Basic, Publishing, Formatting, 
Comments, Archiving, Site Feed, Email & Mobile, OpenID, and Permissions. I 
cover important highlights from the Settings in the following sections.

89
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
 
Figure 4-6: 
The Blogger 
Dashboard 
gives you 
quick 
access to 
layout and 
posting 
tools.
 
You access all the Blogger settings via the Blogger Dashboard. (In other blog 
software packages, this area is called the control panel, the admin panel, and 
so on.) To reach the Dashboard, just log in to the Blogger Web site. If you’re 
already logged in, look for a link to the Dashboard in the upper-right corner 
of any page and click it. My Dashboard is shown in Figure 4-6.
The Dashboard shows all the blogs that you’ve started with Blogger. For 
each blog, you can quickly start a new post or jump into editing older posts. 
Also, a click takes you into the blog settings, or to the template or layout that 
you’re using.
 
If you make changes to any of the Settings areas described in the following 
sections, be sure to click the Save Settings button at the bottom of each page 
to save your new settings.
Making basic changes
On the Basic Settings tab of the Dashboard, you can change the name of your 
blog (Blogger refers to this name as the blog title) and also give it a short 

90
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
description. Most of the Blogger templates display the description near the 
top of the page. If you change the title on your blog page, the URL that read-
ers type into a browser to visit your blog stays the same.
Follow these steps to change your blog’s name:
 
1. From the Dashboard, click the Settings link for the blog that you want 
to edit.
 
 The Basic Settings tab, shown in Figure 4-7, appears.
 
2. Edit the Title and/or Description.
 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click Save Settings.
 
 A Blogger page appears, displaying a confirmation message at the top 
that it saved your settings.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Use the 
Basic 
Settings tab 
to change 
the name 
of your blog 
or add a 
description.
 
The most interesting setting on the Basic Settings tab is Show Email Post 
Links. Setting this option to Yes adds a small e-mail icon to each post on your 
blog. This icon permits your blog visitors to e-mail the post to a friend or 
colleague who might find it interesting, which is a nice little service for your 
readers that might gain you a few more visitors.
 
At the top of the Basic Settings tab is a dangerous but important option: 
Delete Blog. If you ever decide to remove your words from the Web entirely, 
this button removes your blog — all your posts, images, and other files — 
from Blogger and from the Web. If you click it by mistake, don’t panic; Blogger 
asks you to confirm the deletion before going ahead.

91
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
Making publishing changes
The Publishing tab of the Dashboard is small but mighty! If you aren’t happy 
with the Web address for your blog, you can edit the address by changing 
the Blog*Spot Address setting. For instance, if you start a blog called My New 
Kitten Maggie and your cat grows up (they do that, I hear), you might want 
to edit both the name and the location of your blog. (You have to make the 
name change on the Basic Settings tab, which I describe in the preceding sec-
tion.) Use the Publishing tab to change the URL. For example, you can change
http://mynewkittenmaggie.blogspot.com
into
http://mygrownupcatmaggie.blogspot.com
 
You can change your address only to one that another Blogger member isn’t 
already using, so you may have to make several tries before you find one that’s 
available. Although you can make changes to the URL of your blog, remember 
that doing so means that no one can access your blog from the previous 
address, so anyone who has bookmarked your blog or memorized the address 
can’t reach you after you make the change.
 
Blogger has a great tool that allows you to export your blog as HTML pages 
to your own Web server. You can then display these HTML pages as part of a 
larger Web site. To configure Blogger to perform this function, look for infor-
mation on the Publishing tab about how to get started.
Making formatting changes
On the Formatting tab of the Dashboard, you can customize how your blog 
appears, from the format of the date and time to the number of posts on your 
blog home page. You can also set the language of your blog.
One neat setting in this tab is the Post Template setting at the bottom of 
the page. Many blogs follow a standard format. For instance, if you start a 
movie-review blog, you might choose to follow a similar way of reviewing 
each movie, perhaps by giving the name of the movie, the director, the lead 
actors’ names, a short review, and a numeric rating. No matter what movie 
you review, you provide the same information and use the same format each 
time your write a blog post.
The Post Template allows you to set up standard HTML code that formats 
your blog post. After you set up a Post Template, every time you start a blog 

92
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
post, that code automatically appears in the entry, and you can easily format 
your post by putting the information in the right spots.
I can’t cover this feature in depth because I don’t know just what kind of stan-
dard formatting you want to use, but the process of implementing a standard 
template works like this:
 
1. From the Dashboard, click the Settings link for the blog that you want 
to edit.
 
 The Basic Settings tab appears (refer to Figure 4-7).
 
2. Click the Formatting option in the Settings area.
 
 The Formatting tab opens.
 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and type or paste the text or HTML 
code that you want to use for every blog post into the Post Template 
field.
 
4. Click Save Settings.
 
 A Blogger page appears, displaying a confirmation message at the top 
that it saved your settings.
Making comment changes
Comments are both a strength and a weakness of the blog medium. Both 
readers and bloggers find the ability to leave a comment, which lets you 
interact or converse with a blogger, very attractive.
 
Commenting has a downside: Spammers have discovered the comment tech-
nology, as well. Just as with e-mail, you can expect some commenters to tell 
you about fabulous mortgage opportunities, Mexican pharmaceuticals, and 
other less-than-savory possibilities — information neither you nor your 
readers want.
The Comments Settings tab of the Dashboard provides settings to help you 
reduce spam on your blog. One of the best ways to reduce spam is to specify 
who can comment on your blog. From the Comments Settings tab, select an 
option from the Who Can Comment drop-down menu:
 
✓ Anyone: This option allows the widest possible audience, with no limita-
tions on who can comment. It provides no spam prevention, but it also 
imposes no barriers to leaving a comment to genuine commenters.
 
✓ Registered Users: Sets your blog to accept comments only from reg-
istered members of Blogger so that you can cut down on some spam. 
Don’t forget that not everyone has a Blogger account — or wants one — 
so you might lose some real comments.

93
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
 
✓ Users with Google Accounts: Because Google validates the accounts it 
creates, letting users who have Google accounts leave comments 
can help ensure that you get comments from humans, rather than 
spammers.
 
✓ Only Members of the Blog: Prevents anyone who isn’t a member of your 
blog from leaving a comment. No one you haven’t personally authorized 
as a member can leave a comment. This option creates a lot of work for 
you because you have to maintain the list of authorized members, but you 
don’t get any spam.
 
You can add members to your blog from the Permissions Settings tab.
You can implement two other important Comment settings if you have spam 
problems. On the Comments Settings tab, you can specify
 
✓ Comment moderation: Change the Enable Comment Moderation setting 
to Always. Turning on comment moderation prevents anyone from post-
ing a comment that you haven’t approved. When someone leaves a com-
ment, you get an e-mail that lets you know about the comment. From the 
Dashboard, you can authorize or reject the publication of the comment. 
You can also moderate comments via e-mail.
 
 Moderating comments is a lot of work for you, but it improves the quality 
and readability of comments on your blog for your readers, and it 
discourages spammers in the future.
 
✓ Word verification: Change the Show Word Verification for Comments 
setting to Yes. People who want to comment on blogs that have word 
verification turned on must type a word displayed in an image in order 
to submit a comment. Because many spammers use automated scripts 
to post spam on blogs, and only humans can read the text in an image, 
this verification cuts down significantly on the amount of spam.
 
At the bottom of the Comment Settings tab, you can enter an e-mail address in 
the Comment Notification Address field at which you want to receive notifica-
tion when someone leaves a comment on your blog. This setting helps you 
keep track of comments left on your blog, especially when you have a lot of 
old posts on which you might not see comments when you view your blog.
Making e-mail changes
On the Email & Mobile Settings tab of the Dashboard, you can turn on a cool 
feature that allows you to post to your blog by sending an e-mail message. 
When configured, you can simply send an e-mail to the address from any 
device capable of sending e-mail (such as your phone!). The subject of the 

94
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
e-mail becomes the title of the blog post, and the text of the e-mail is the 
entry body. It’s a very quick, easy way to publish to your blog, which makes 
it great for when you’re traveling.
To set up a Mail2Blogger address, visit the Email & Mobile Settings tab and 
fill out the Email Posting Address field. Be sure to save the settings and test 
to make sure that it works!
Making permission changes
On the Permissions tab of the Dashboard, you can add authors to your blog — 
people who can also contribute blog posts, creating a group blog. To add 
someone as an author, you simply need that person’s e-mail address. If the 
person you’re adding has a Blogger or Google account, I recommend using 
that address so that all his or her Blogger and Google account services are 
tied together.
To add an author, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Dashboard, click the Settings link for the blog that you want 
to edit.
 
 The Basic Settings tab appears (refer to Figure 4-7).
 
2. Click the Permissions option in the Settings area.
 
 The Permissions tab opens.
 
3. Click the Add Authors button.
 
 A field for e-mail addresses appears.
 
4. Type or paste the e-mail addresses of the authors you want to invite to 
post on your blog in the field.
 
5. Click Invite.
 
 A Blogger page appears, displaying the address and invitation date for 
the invited author.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3-5 to add additional authors.
You can also decide to allow anyone to view the blog, or you can choose to 
restrict viewers to only people you invite or the authors of the blog. If you want 
to blog only for your family, use the Permissions tab to invite them as readers, 
which blocks anyone else from even seeing the blog (much less leaving a 
comment!).

95
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
Customizing Your Template
The layout that you picked when you started your blog might look great to 
you, but many bloggers want to tweak and customize the look and feel of their 
blogs — I know I did when I started working on my blog. I was using personal 
words and pictures, and I wanted to make the rest of the site look more like 
my own Web site, rather than a Blogger design.
You can customize the design of a Blogger blog in three ways; you can 
accomplish all three by going to the Dashboard and clicking the Layout link 
underneath the name of the blog that you want to customize.
 
If you see the word Template, rather than Layout, underneath the name of 
your blog information in the Dashboard, you’re probably using a blog that was 
set up before Blogger added the Layout features. You need to upgrade your 
blog in order to use the new features. To do so, read the “Upgrading to tem-
plates” sidebar in this chapter. You may find the distinction extra confusing 
because the Dashboard refers to Layout, but after you click into the Layout 
area, you see a tab that refers to templates.
In Blogger, a single template controls the layout and design of your blog, 
from the size of the text to the color of the background. Changing the tem-
plate changes the design. In the past, changing the template required a fairly 
extensive knowledge of HTML and Blogger code, but now you can customize 
quite a bit without knowing code.
Editing templates old-skool: Using code
If you’re a Web designer or coder, and you 
want to sink your teeth into the Blogger tem-
plate itself, you can still do so. To get to the 
code from the Blogger Dashboard, choose 
Layout➪Edit HTML. You can edit the template 
in two ways:
 ✓ Edit the HTML template directly within the 
Blogger Dashboard. Preview and save the 
template while you go.
 ✓ Download the template to your computer. 
Edit it in your chosen HTML editor, and then 
upload the new template.
Both approaches require you to be proficient 
with HTML and CSS, and to know a certain 
amount of Blogger’s own coding language, to 
successfully edit these files.

96
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Editing page elements
When you click the Layout link, the Page Elements tab opens by default. 
The Page Elements tab of Blogger (see Figure 4-8) gives you, the blogger, a 
ground-breaking tool that allows you to have detailed control over the layout 
and look of your blog without requiring you to become an HTML guru and 
stay up late figuring out the intricacies of Web publishing. This kind of editing 
control reflects the growing do-it-yourself attitude found in the blogosphere: 
Bloggers want sites that reflect their own sensibilities, but not everyone has 
the time to become an expert or the budget to hire one.
This access also reflects the growing expertise of many computer users who 
can edit photographs and create graphics, and it gives them the ability to 
make the most of those skills.
In the Page Elements tab (see Figure 4-8), a wireframe of your blog template 
appears. A wireframe is a visual representation of the template layout that 
uses only outlines, or boxes, of the elements.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Use the 
Layout tab 
in Blogger 
to customize 
your blog 
layout.
 

97
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
The following list explains how you can use the wireframe features to 
customize your page:
 
✓ Edit page elements. Click the Edit link for any page element that is 
already being used to change its formatting. In most layouts, you can 
customize the navigation bar, blog header, blog posts, and sidebar 
elements, such as About Me and the Archive.
 
✓ Add a gadget. Click the Add a Gadget link to place in your sidebar polls, 
images, lists, advertising, and more from a library of Blogger-provided 
elements. You have many to choose from, but here’s a quick list to give 
you a feel for the options:
 
• Poll
 
• List
 
• Link List
 
• Picture
 
• Google AdSense (see Chapter 17)
 
• Text
 
• HTML/third-party functionality (see Chapter 20 for third-party 
tools that you might enjoy)
 
• RSS or Atom feed (more about RSS in Chapter 13)
 
• Video clips
 
• Logos
 
• Your profile
 
• Headlines
 
✓ Move page elements. Click and drag them to a new position.
 
✓ Preview edits that you’ve made. See how your changes look before you 
save them to your blog by clicking the Preview button.
 
✓ Revert to the original version of your template. Click the Clear Edits 
button.
Editing fonts and colors
If you like the customization possibilities discussed in the preceding section, 
I think you’ll like what you can do in the Fonts and Colors section of the 
Template tab, as well.

98
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
The Fonts and Colors screen gives you fine control over the colors of the 
following blog elements:
 
✓ Text
 
✓ Page header
 
✓ Dates
 
✓ Blog entry titles and footers
 
✓ Sidebar background, text, and titles
 
✓ Link color
You can also edit the fonts and size of the text on your blog. If all the colors 
of the rainbow get to be too much, click the Revert to Template Default link 
and start over with the template designer’s choices.
To edit a font color, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Fonts and Colors tab of the Layout area.
 
 The fonts and colors palette and selection options appear.
 
2. Select the item that you want to edit from the scrollable menu at the 
top-left of the page.
 
 In Figure 4-9, I selected the Post Title Color.
Upgrading to templates
If the first item on the Template tab isn’t Page 
Elements, you might need to upgrade your tem-
plate to the current format. Just follow these 
simple steps:
 1. Click the Customize Design tab.
 
 The Upgrade Your Template page appears.
 2. Click Upgrade Your Template.
 
 The Pick New Template page opens.
 3. Select a template to use.
 
 If you’re already using one of the existing 
Blogger designs, that design is preselected 
for you, so you can go to Step 4.
 
 To pick a new template, preview any tem-
plate by clicking the Preview Template 
link below the corresponding thumbnail. 
A larger image of the template opens in a 
new browser window so that you can take 
a closer look. Close the preview window 
when you finish. After you find a template 
that you want to use, select it.
 4. Click the Save Template button.
 
 Blogger implements the latest format of 
the template, which allows you to add 
or arrange layout elements in the Page 
Elements tab that becomes available after 
the upgrade.

99
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
 
3. Click a color box in any of the palettes on the right to select a new color.
 
 You can choose from these palettes:
 
• Colors from Your Blog: This palette shows the other colors that 
you’re using in your layout.
 
• Colors That Match Your Blog: This palette shows colors that Blogger 
thinks fit well with the colors already in use.
 
• More Colors: This palette shows a selection of other colors that you 
can play with.
 
• Edit Color Hex Code: If you know the hexadecimal code for the 
color that you want to use, you can type it into this text box. 
Hexadecimal code is a code that contains letters and numbers 
which equate to a color. Primarily, graphic and Web designers use 
hexadecimal code.
 
 When you click a color, Blogger shows a preview of how it looks on your 
blog in the lower half of the screen.
 
4. After you make your edits, click Save Changes.
 
 A Blogger page opens, displaying a confirmation that it has saved your 
edits.
 
Figure 4-9: 
Use Fonts 
and Colors 
to change 
the text 
colors on 
your blog.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Choosing a new template
When you want a fresh new look, sometimes no amount of tweaking is 
enough — you need an entirely new template design to work with. At any 
time, you can visit the Pick New Template section on the Template tab and 
look through the available Blogger templates, preview them, and select a new 
one to use on your blog. Click the Save Template button after you select a 
new template.
 
If you customize your template by using the Fonts and Colors section and then 
pick a new template, you lose all your edits and tweaks. If you want to imple-
ment those tweaks sometime in the future, print a copy of your blog and make 
notes about what colors you used for each element. Then, put your paper tem-
plate in a safe place!
Some of the available templates have multiple versions listed. The template 
designer has created variations on the main template that you might enjoy. 
To see a variation, simply select the radio button for one of the versions. The 
thumbnail loads, and when you preview the template, you can see a larger view.
 
Don’t forget that you can customize your new template by using the Page 
Elements and the Fonts and Colors sections.

f you spend much time looking at blogs or talking to bloggers, you can’t 
miss references to WordPress, one of the best-known and well-liked blog-
ging software options available today. WordPress comes in two flavors — 
hosted and installable — and in this chapter, I focus on working with the 
installable version that you place on your own Web server.
This chapter runs through an overview of how to install WordPress on your 
server, use the administration panel, play with themes and widgets, and find 
out where to connect with other WordPress users in your local community 
and online.
 
I can cover only so much detail in a single chapter, so if you want to dive into 
greater detail about WordPress and find out how you can keep your software 
installation healthy for a long time to come, invest in a copy of WordPress For 
Dummies, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson.
Choosing between WordPress.com 
and WordPress.org
Some blog software is available as both a hosted service and a version that 
you can download and install. WordPress is one of those packages. (For a 
refresher on hosted versus server-based blogging software, see Chapter 3.)

102
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
References to WordPress (Figure 5-1) are uniformly about the version of the 
software that you download and install on your own server. You can check it 
out online at www.wordpress.org. However, the option at WordPress.com is 
a hosted version. Fortunately, you can use both types of WordPress for free.
When WordPress.com was launched, many bloggers rejoiced because 
WordPress had reached the blogging mainstream. Bloggers could now create 
blogs with ease and use the tools that they had come to love without having 
to tinker in the background or stress over how to maintain those blogs.
Table 5-1 breaks down the pros and cons of each version of WordPress.
Table 5-1

Cons
WordPress.com
• A free and hosted service.
The WordPress.com service 
deals with daily maintenance, 
such as backups and soft-
ware updates.
• Security is a little better than 
some hosting services: Your 
blogs are replicated in three 
different locations, thus keep-
ing your blog posts safe. You 
also gain the benefits of the

Choosing a version of WordPress looks daunting, doesn’t it? It really isn’t. 
You just need to ask yourself these questions: How nerdy are you? Do you 
like fiddling with the dials? Jiggling the handle? If your answers are positive, 
then you should continue reading this chapter! If not, WordPress.com may be 
the WordPress for you.
 
Still stuck? You can find additional information about the two options at

You can find yet a third version of WordPress out there — WordPress MU 
(http://mu.wordpress.org). The MU stands for multiuser, and this flavor 
of WordPress can run thousands of blogs at the same time. Universities, news-
papers, and blog networks usually use this version of WordPress.
Installing WordPress
In this chapter, I focus on installing and using WordPress on your own Web 
server. (If you think the hosted version is what you need, just point your Web 
browser to www.wordpress.com and follow the simple signup instructions 
to get started.)
You can get your WordPress installation up and running without a huge 
amount of difficulty, but in order to get your site going, you need to follow 
some very important steps.
 
Although this chapter walks you through the process, you can also follow 
along with WordPress’s instructions, located at http://codex.wordpress.
org/Installing_WordPress.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Registering a domain
Do you know what you want to call your blog yet? Do you have a domain 
already? When you’re itching to get your blog online and want to control 
every aspect, the domain is the first thing that you need.
A domain is the name and brand of your blog, and the Web address (or URL). 
It gives visitors an idea of what your blog is about and who you are. You can 
have some fun getting creative with your blog name! Before committing to a 
blog name, why not see what others have done? The following list gives you a 
few examples of some of the world’s top blogs and their domains:
 
✓ Engadget (www.engadget.com): A technology blog that talks about 
gadgets
 
✓ Tech Crunch (www.techcrunch.com): A technology-industry blog
 
✓ Boing Boing (www.boingboing.net): A blog that talks about almost 
anything
 
✓ Lifehacker (www.lifehacker.com): A site that suggests ways that you 
can make your life better and more efficient
 
✓ ReadWriteWeb (www.readwriteweb.com): A site featuring several 
blogs that talk about Web technology
The domains in the preceding list make quite an impression, even if, at first 
glance, they don’t necessarily tell the visitor what they write about. If you 
find and bookmark a blog that you like, you keep going back for the great 
content, not the domain name. In Chapter 3, I talk about acquiring domains in 
detail, if you need a refresher about them.
Open source software
WordPress is open source software, which 
means that its source code — the programming 
that runs the application — is freely accessi-
ble to developers who want to customize it or 
create new software from or for it.
Also, you can freely distribute open source soft-
ware, and no one places restrictions on how 
you (or anyone else) can use it. In fact, one of 
the few terms of using open source software is 
that you can’t place restrictions on the use or 
distribution of what you create from it.

105
 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
Selecting Web hosting
After you choose an appropriate domain for your blog, you need somewhere 
for your WordPress install to live. In Chapter 3, I tell you what to look for in 
Web hosting and make some recommendations. Don’t forget that you can also 
ask other bloggers what host they use and what their experience has been.
If you’ve read Chapter 3 of this book, you already know that Web software 
such as WordPress has certain technical requirements. The requirements for 
WordPress are
 
✓ PHP 4.3 or greater
 
✓ MySQL 4.0 or greater
 
✓ The mod_rewrite Apache module
Most Web hosts have similar configurations and should be able to handle 
what you need, but you can review the official WordPress requirements 
page at http://wordpress.org/about/requirements. They also have 
a handy bit of text that you can copy and send to potential Web hosts to see 
whether their services can handle WordPress. How cool is that?
 
The WordPress community has already taken the question of Web hosting 
into its multitude of hands and come up with a list of recommended hosting 
companies. The community and WordPress developers voted these compa-
nies their top picks for providing everything that you need for WordPress:
 
✓ BlueHost (www.bluehost.com)
 
✓ DreamHost (www.dreamhost.com)
 
✓ Media Temple (www.mediatemple.com)
 
✓ Blogs About (www.blogs-about.com)
 
✓ Laughing Squid (www.laughingsquid.com)
Each of these companies offer well-known quality Web hosting, but if you 
want to continue looking, compare notes with other bloggers and make sure 
to refer back to Chapter 3 for good advice about choosing a Web host.
Getting the software
After you sort out your Web host and site domain, you next need to down-
load and extract the WordPress files from WordPress.org and put them on 

106
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
your computer. Choose a place you’ll remember, such as a documents or 
download directory. Follow these steps:
 
1. Point your Web browser to www.wordpress.org.
 
 The main WordPress page appears.
 
2. Click the red Download tab in the top-right corner.
 
 The site takes you to a short instructional page that has download infor-
mation on it.
 
3. Click the Download WordPress button.
 
 Your Web browser may ask you to select a location to place the files that 
are downloading. If it does, choose a place on your computer that you will 
remember. Your Desktop or Documents folder are decent choices.
 
4. After the compressed file downloads, double-click it to expand (or 
unzip) the files it contains on your computer.
 
 The files are saved on your computer, as shown in Figure 5-2.
 
WordPress.org provides the downloadable file in two compressed formats: 
GZip (.tar.gz) and ZIP (.zip) format. These days, most computer systems 
recognize the ZIP format, and you should be able to open it without installing 
any additional software. After you expand the .zip file, you can delete it from 
your computer.
 
Figure 5-2: 
After you 
extract the 
WordPress 
files to your 
hard drive, 
you should 
see a folder 
structure 
similar to 
this.
 

107
 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
Uploading the WordPress files
Do you have your files unzipped? Great! Now, the installation process gets a 
little more technical. You need to upload these unzipped files to your Web 
hosting space by using an FTP (file transfer protocol) client. If you don’t have 
an FTP client installed on your computer, you have plenty of free options that 
you can download and install.
The following list gives you my favorite FTP clients:
 
✓ FileZilla (www.filezilla-project.org): Available for all computer 
platforms (see Figure 5-3)
 
✓ Cyberduck (www.cyberduck.ch): Available only for Macintosh 
computers
Both of these programs have the ability to connect and transfer files to your new 
Web host. To place the WordPress files on your Web host, follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install the FTP client of your choice.
 
 Look for installation instructions on the FTP software Web site.
 
2. Start your FTP client.
 
3. Connect to your Web server by using the details that your Web host 
provided you for FTP access.
 
 These details usually include a URL, username, and password.
 
 The directory in which you store the WordPress files is normally the 
main directory that you see when you connect via FTP. Check with your 
Web host if you’re confused.
 
4. Using the FTP software, upload the WordPress files from your com-
puter to the server.
 
 In some FTP clients, you can drag and drop the WordPress files to the 
location on the Web host. Others use arrow interfaces.
 
5. When the files finish uploading, close your FTP client.
What is FTP?
FTP is a technology used to copy files from one 
computer to another by using the file transfer 
protocol. Simply put, FTP allows computers that 
are running different operating systems (such 
as Windows or Mac) to move files across the 
Internet without experiencing format difficul-
ties. It’s an old technology that people still use 
every day to move Web site files.

108

This FileZilla 
interface, 
which has 
the hard 
drive on the 
left and the 
Web server 
on the right, 
is similar to 
most FTP 
client 
interfaces.
 
 
At some point in the future, you may need to upload additional files (although 
WordPress is fairly good at doing most of its updates directly through the 
interface), so make sure to retain the information that you used to connect to 
your Web host.
Setting up the database
You’re doing great! But don’t rest on your laurels; this next step is probably 
the most technical. Take a deep breath and prepare to set up a database for 
your WordPress blog.
Arguably, setting up a database isn’t actually terribly difficult. However, each 
Web host handles databases in different ways, so I can’t give you straightforward 
instructions for accomplishing this task.
 
Your Web host is in the business of handling technical issues, and of course, 
they set up the environment in the first place. Don’t hesitate to request assis-
tance with your database setup.

109
 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
 
The database system that you need to use is called MySQL. (Without MySQL, 
you can’t use WordPress.) MySQL is a relational database management system. 
It can store all kinds of data for WordPress — from your blog posts to blogroll 
links, as well as all your WordPress settings. So, MySQL stores the blog posts 
that you write inside a database that’s fast, efficient, and flexible.
If you want to know more about MySQL, pick up a copy of PHP & MySQL For 
Dummies, by Janet Valade. But take my word that after you set up your data-
base, you won’t need to know any more about it for the purposes of using 
WordPress.
After you know how to access your database setup tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your Web host.
 
2. Create the database.
 
 You need to name your database something that makes sense. If you 
have a blog called Joe Smith’s Wondrous Adventures, you could name 
the database joesmith. The length of database names and database user-
names are normally limited, and you can’t include special characters in 
the names.
 
3. Create a database user.
 
 You can make the username anything, except the name that you used 
for your database. The same length and special character restrictions 
apply, though.
 
4. Assign a password to that user.
 
 Don’t forget to write this information down so that you can use it when 
you run the WordPress install script.
Because Web hosting companies can choose for themselves which MySQL 
database system to include in their hosting packages, I don’t know which of 
the following applies to your situation. But Web hosts commonly use one of 
the following management systems:
 
✓ phpMyAdmin: A database management tool (shown in Figure 5-4) that a 
lot of Web hosts provide to their clients. You can create and delete data-
bases, manage database users, and (depending on what permissions the 
Web host gives you) manipulate the data itself.
 
✓ cPanel: A common Web host interface that generally enables users to 
create and delete databases. You normally do any additional manipula-
tion by using phpMyAdmin.
 
✓ Plesk: Yet another Web host interface that allows users to create and 
delete databases and manage database users. You do any data 
manipulation by using phpMyAdmin.

110
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
Figure 5-4: 
phpMy
Admin is a 
tool that you 
can use to 
manage and 
create 
databases.
 
The Web host that you choose probably uses one of the interfaces in the 
preceding list. You can figure them out and use them fairly easily. If you’re 
running only one blog, you need only a single database. If you’re thinking 
of running more than one, you need to find out how to keep your databases 
healthy and separate by using tools that your Web host provides.
 
Some Web hosts have automated WordPress installation and allow you to 
bypass all the installation instructions in this chapter — the Web host takes 
care of it all. Ask your Web host whether they offer packages that include 
WordPress installation as part of the setup.
Running the install script
After you put the WordPress files in the directory your Web host recom-
mends and write down the database information, you only have to run the 
WordPress installer. The installer is super- simple. Things can go wrong, of 
course, but if the installer gets stuck, it does a very good job of letting you 
know exactly what you need to do.

111
 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
Follow these steps to install WordPress:
 
1. To run the installer, point your Internet browser to: 
www.yourwebdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php
 
 Remember to replace www.yourwebdomain.com with your domain name!
 
 The installer checks to see whether you’ve created or edited the con-
figuration file. If it doesn’t find one, it will create it for you.
 
2. Click Create a Configuration File.
 
 This creates your WordPress configuration file. Now all you need to do 
is enter the information the configuration file needs. 
 
3. Make sure you have the database name, username, password, and 
hostname. If you do, click Let’s Go!
 
4. Enter the database information (see Figure 5-5).
 
 You can usually leave the database host as localhost because most Web 
hosting environments use that host without complaint. You don’t have 
to change the table prefix, either.
 
5. Click Submit.
 
Figure 5-5: 
Provide the 
database 
informa-
tion to the 
WordPress 
installer.
 

112
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
6. Click Run the Install.
 
7. Enter a blog title and your e-mail address in the fields provided.
 
8. Click Install WordPress.
 
 If everything goes well, the installer displays the word Success on the 
screen. The username and password of the administration user also 
appear on the screen. Keep a record of this information in a safe loca-
tion because if your blog experiences any problems or you need to con-
duct any WordPress configuration or management you will need to log 
in using the admin account.
 
9. Click Log In.
 
 The log in page appears, where you can log in to your new installation.
 
 That’s it! You’ve done it! You can now log in to your new WordPress 
installation and get busy publishing.
 
The configuration file is named wp-config.php. If your installer can’t create 
the configuration file automatically, follow the instructions that WordPress 
provides at (http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_Word
Press#Setup_configuration_file) to create the file by hand.
Getting Familiar with Settings
After you have your new blog software installed and running, you can log in to 
your WordPress admin account and take a look around. The WordPress soft-
ware does a lot right out of the box to make your blogging life as simple as pos-
sible. You have the ability to create blog posts; create static pages; add images 
and multimedia files; connect to social networking sites, such as Flickr and 
Facebook; and chat with blog visitors by using the commenting system.
Either these functions come with the WordPress install or you can add them 
by using a plug-in that you download and install. Each of these plug-ins typi-
cally has an administration page.
In the following sections, I introduce you to the administration section of the 
blog itself.
Logging in
Before you can start posting, you need to head on over to the Log In page and 
enter the username and password that was provided to you during the instal-
lation process.

113
 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
In order to log in to your new Web site, you may want to bookmark the 
following link:
www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin/wp-login.php
Remember to replace www.yourwebdomain.com with your domain name!
Setting up an Editor account
WordPress allows you to set up and maintain several levels of user accounts 
in addition to the administrative account created during the setup process. 
These account types are called roles. They are:
 
✓ Administrator: Administrators have access to all features and areas of 
the blog software, from technical configuration to user accounts to con-
tent tools. This is the most powerful level of access on your blog; handle 
with care!
 
✓ Editor: This is a user that can publish posts, manage posts, and manage 
other account posts.
 
✓ Author: This is a user that can publish and manage his or her own posts.
 
✓ Contributor: This is a user role that allows someone to write and 
manage posts but not publish them live to the blog.
 
✓ Subscriber: This is a user that can read comments, post comments, and 
receive other private information.
 
If you are the only person blogging on your Web site, you should still go ahead 
and set up an Editor user account for creating blog posts. I recommend that 
you don’t use the administrative account created during installation as the 
account you use when you author blog posts. It’s a bit like driving a car by 
opening the hood and manipulating the engine directly; use the perfectly good 
steering wheel that comes with WordPress by setting up an Editor account.
Reserve the administrative account for administrative tasks like installing 
new themes, plugins, and any other general maintenance.
Set up your Editor account by following these steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress installation.
 
2. From the Dashboard, click Users.
 
 You see the full list of users and their roles.
 
3. Click Add New.
 
 WordPress loads the Add New User screen.

114
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
4. Fill out the user fields.
 
 You will see a listing of fields: username, first name, last name, e-mail, 
Web site, and password. Only three are required: username, password, 
and e-mail address. I also recommend filling in the first and last name.
 
5. Select the Editor role.
 
6. Click Add User.
 
 The user is created.
 
When you set up a new user, you can choose to send the account information 
to the new user’s e-mail address. In our case, this account is for yourself so 
you don’t need to select this checkbox. If you wish to have additional writers 
on your blog, consider setting them up as Authors — instead of Editors — and 
notifying them as you set up their accounts.
 
After you create your new Editor account, don’t forget to log out of the admin-
istrative account, and then log in again as an Editor!
Using the Dashboard
Each time you log in to your WordPress blog, you end up on the Dashboard 
page. Get to know this page well because you spend most of your blogging 
time here. You can configure the front Dashboard to your liking by moving 
panels around and turning panels on or off. You can see the Dashboard in 
Figure 5-6.
On the left side of the Dashboard, a series of menus point you to the various 
sections of the administration panel. You likely visit some of these menus on 
a daily basis and some only once in a while:
 
✓ Posts: Includes links that allow you to edit posts, add new posts, and 
manage categories and tags.
 
✓ Media: Provides you with a link to upload new media files to your media 
library or manage previously uploaded media.
 
✓ Links: Manage lists of links on your Web site. For example, group links 
together into categories and post them in sidebars as blogrolls or other 
link lists.
 
✓ Pages: Clicking Pages takes you to the Page Administration section. 
Pages in WordPress are considered static pieces of content (pages that 
change only once in a while) and aren’t blog posts. Use them for pretty 
much any section of your Web site, like a bio page or contact page. You 
can then link to these pages from a sidebar menu or via another blog 
post. Some themes may also provide you with menus that you can use 
to link to different sections of your blog. 

115

✓ Tools: Manage additional tools for improved speed by using Google Gears, 
import and export blog posts and comments, and conduct WordPress 
upgrades. Google Gears is an optional plugin for browsers like Firefox and 
Internet Explorer and adds functionality to your browser.
 
✓ Settings: Make all the general changes to the blog, such as the name of 
the site, your e-mail address, and the date and time-zone settings.
 
• Writing: Contains settings for the editor interface, as well as 
default settings for categories, RSS, and tags. You can also access 
settings to set up remote e-mail.

116
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
• Reading: Choose the number of blog posts that appear on the 
front page of your blog and the number of postings available in 
your RSS feed.
 
• Discussion Settings: Control what kinds of communication your 
blog sends out. For example, you can get the blog to notify you by 
e-mail when someone adds a new comment.
 
• Media: Upload and manage any of your media files. You can add 
titles and descriptions, organize images and audio, add captions to 
images, and make minor changes to image sizes.
 
• Privacy: Set your blog so that search engines ignore it. Use this 
option only if you have a private blog that you want to share with a 
small number of people.
 
• Permalinks: Permalinks are the permanent links to your individual 
posts. You can configure the format of the post URLs so that they 
contain both date information and keywords, or keywords only. 
You can also set default categories for posts and tags.
 
• Miscellaneous: Settings for uploads, URL paths to files, settings for 
folder organization, and link update tracking.
Checking out the panels
On the right side of the Dashboard, you see a series of panels. Each panel 
gives you access to parts of the administrative interface for WordPress. The 
default panels are
 
✓ Right Now: Contains a quick overview of what’s happening on your blog. 
The panel displays
 
• The number of posts on the blog
 
• The number of comments
 
• The spam count
 
• The number of categories and tags currently in use on the site
 
✓ Recent Comments: Lists the most recent comment activity on your blog 
and provides links that allow you to moderate and respond to comments 
without leaving the Dashboard.
 
✓ Incoming Links: Uses Google searches to show the sites that are send-
ing visitors to your blog.
 
✓ Plugins: Gives you a quick list of the newest, the most popular, and the 
most recently updated plug-ins. A plug-in is a small piece of program-
ming that you can attach to existing software to extend that software’s 
functionality.

117
 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
 
✓ QuickPress: Allows you to post a quick note on your blog right from the 
administration panel.
 
✓ Recent Drafts: Contains a listing of posts that you saved as drafts but 
haven’t yet published.
 
✓ WordPress Development Blog: The latest postings from the WordPress 
development blog, which announces security patches and any other 
important updates.
 
✓ Other WordPress News: Contains a listing of blog posts from other 
WordPress blogs that talk about WordPress.
Creating a Post
I’m sure you’re bursting at the seams to get your first blog post online. The 
process is quite simple in terms of using WordPress. The real challenge is 
coming up with good stuff to blog about! Jump to Chapter 8 for a lot of tips 
and ideas on writing for your blog.
To start a new blog post, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Posts menu in the Dashboard and select Add New.
 
 WordPress opens the Add New Post page, shown in Figure 5-7.
 
2. Give your post a title by entering it in the text box below Add New Post.
 
3. Add some text in the body text box.
 
 Use the formatting buttons if you want to change the style of your text, 
create a list, or otherwise add elements.
 
4. Use any of the other options that you want for this post.
 
 WordPress gives you the following options:
 
• Excerpt: If you want, you can write a short summary of your post 
for the Excerpt field. 
 
• Post Tags: Tags are keywords that describe the topic of your post. 
Tagging your posts lets search engines easily identify the subject 
material you discuss and means your post is likely to rank higher 
in search engine listings.
 
• Categories: Use the Add New Category link in the Categories box 
if you need to create a new category for your post. Categories are 
general groups that you can sort you blog posts into so that read-
ers can easily locate the content most interesting to them.

118
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
• Discussion: You can choose whether you want to allow readers to 
post comments on this posting and whether you want to permit 
trackbacks. I explain trackbacks in Chapter 3.
 
• Custom Fields: You can add custom fields to your posts, which 
you fully control. Custom fields are simply fields that appear in 
each blog post that you can display by altering the template for 
your blog. For example, if your blog is a restaurant-review blog, 
you might choose to add custom fields for the location or rating of 
each restaurant that you review.
 
5. Click Publish to save your blog post and check out your blog to see 
how it looks!
 
 If you’re not ready to post your blog entry to the public, you can save 
your posting as a draft or preview it before you post it. Also, you can set 
a particular date if you want to schedule your post for publication in the 
future.
 
 Look for a Visit Site link at the top of the Dashboard; the link takes you 
right to your blog.

 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
Customizing Your Design
After you play around with a few of the WordPress features, I know you’re 
thinking, “How do I make this new blog pretty?” The answer is as simple as a 
menu click. Just follow these steps:
 
1. From the menus on the left side of the Dashboard, click Appearance.
 
 The Manage Themes page opens, displaying a list of themes that you 
can install.
 
2. Search for themes based on color or keyword.
 
 WordPress returns a list of themes based on your search query.
 
3. Click Preview to see how a particular theme looks in a pop-up 
window. Close the pop-up to look at the list again.
 
4. After you find a theme that you like, click Install to load the theme 
onto your server.
 
5. Click Active to apply the theme to your blog.
You can install several themes all at the same time, and then take time to test 
which theme best suits your blog.
Now, do you want to get into the code even more? If so, get ready to dive 
into HTML. Only the brave venture into this territory because it does require 
knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and WordPress’s own markup language. The 
code editing for WordPress includes a little more than just plain old HTML.
Some bloggers love playing with HTML code, and some run away as fast as 
they can. If you have the chops, however, the developers of WordPress have 
made accessing and modifying the theme files a fairly easy task.
Select Editor from the Appearance menu to get at the editing interface for the 
currently installed theme. The editor is simply a text editor in which you can 
manipulate the files in your theme without using any other technology to access 
the files (such as FTP). It’s simple to use and doesn’t have too many frills.
The drawback to using the editor is that you really need to know your stuff 
when it comes to HTML code, CSS, and a little PHP thrown in for good mea-
sure. If you don’t know what these technologies do, I don’t recommend 
touching your theme without a little practice beforehand. Make backups!

Finding Out More about WordPress
You could spend a lot of time figuring out WordPress, and I just can’t fit it all 
into a single chapter. (I tried!) But you’re far from alone in your search for a 
better understanding of your new WordPress blog. A great many Web sites 
and blogs can help you further your WordPress education. Here are a few 
handy resources:
 
✓ WordPress For Dummies: You knew that For Dummies had a book on 
this topic, right? Of course, you did! Why not pick up a copy? You can 
dig deeper into the ins and outs of WordPress code, themes, and wid-
gets. This book can be your one-stop resource. Tell Lisa Sabin-Wilson 
that Blogging For Dummies sent you!
 
 http://justagirlintheworld.com/wordpressfordummies
 
✓ WordPress Community: The official WordPress documentation is avail-
able online and updated regularly. You can find out about the latest

✓ WordCamp: Over the last couple of years, camps have been popping up 
everywhere. Camps (also known as unconferences) are informal gather-
ings of people who love to get together and talk about their interests. If 
you love WordPress, then you need to go to a WordCamp in your area 
soon because you can find out a lot of things not covered anywhere else. 
What could be better than a bunch of people getting together to talk 
about everything WordPress? Maybe a bunch of people getting together 
to talk about everything WordPress who also have cupcakes? Visit the 
Web site to see whether a WordCamp is coming to your community. If 
not, you could start one!

D
o you think blogging might just be too much work? Before you dismiss 
my question as sarcastic, consider this: A 2008 study by Technorati 
indicated that most bloggers spend an average of ten hours a week on their 
blogs. That’s not an insignificant amount of time, and not everyone has 
that kind of time to devote to blogging. (Interestingly, most of the bloggers 
Technorati surveyed for this study indicated that they blog for fun and 
without any financial reward. Check out the full study online at www.
technorati.com/blogging/feature/state-of-the-blogosphere-
2008/.)
So, if you’re interested in blogging but worried about time, a micro blog might 
be an alternative you should consider. Micro blogging is pretty much what it 
sounds like — creating very short blog posts. But the micro blog may have all 
the other usual trappings of a blog, such as comments, RSS feeds, and so on.
In this chapter, I introduce you to micro blogging options and walk you 
through starting a micro blog of your own.
Introducing Micro Blogging
Micro blogging is characterized by very short blog posts, done quickly and 
frequently, and often from some nontraditional publishing tools, such as 
mobile phones, e-mail, instant messages, and text messages. However, you 
can still use a Web interface to produce a micro blog!

122
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Some micro bloggers use their blog as a mechanism to collect and archive 
interesting tidbits of information that they come across while they surf the 
Web. Many micro blogs contain very little personal content in the form of 
writing, but a lot of photos, snippets of video, and links. In fact, many micro 
bloggers don’t explain why they choose to include something in their blogs at 
all, and in this way, micro blogs can be much more idiosyncratic to the indi-
vidual blogger than a regular blog.
We Are the Weirdos (http://wearetheweirdos.tumblr.com) is a micro 
blog produced with Tumblr (you can read more about Tumblr in the follow-
ing sections). Created by Spencer, the blog (shown in Figure 6-1) is a motley 
collection of funny photos, screenshots, videos, audio files, and quotes.
Other micro blogging tools act a little differently. Facebook, LinkedIn, and 
MySpace — or any social network that allows you to post status updates — 
are technically micro blogging tools, as well. Status updates are very short text 
posts that are generally used to let others know what you’re thinking or doing.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Spencer’s 
We Are the 
Weirdos 
is a good 
example 
of a micro 
blog.
 
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is a micro blogging tool that broadcasts status 
updates. Degan Beley writes a restaurant review blog called Ethnic Eats 
(www.ethniceats.ca) and uses the micro blogging tool Twitter in combi-
nation with her regular blog to provide quick updates to her readers about 
where she’s eating that night — a preview of reviews to come — as well as to 

123
 Chapter 6: Starting a Micro Blog
cover topics that she might not put on the full blog. Her Twitter micro blog 
(www.twitter.com/ethniceats) is shown in Figure 6-2.
I spend more time covering the Twitter phenomenon in Chapter 14.
Some popular tools for micro blogging include
 
✓ Tumblr (www.tumblr.com)
 
✓ Posterous (www.posterous.com)
 
✓ Twitter (www.twitter.com)
 
✓ Plurk (www.plurk.com)
 
✓ Jaiku (www.jaiku.com)
 
✓ Identi.ca (www.identi.ca)

Starting a Micro Blog with Tumblr
In this section, I walk you through starting a micro blog by using Tumblr, one 
of the most popular micro blogging services out there.

124
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Tumblr (www.tumblr.com) is hosted blog software, which means that you 
don’t need to have Web hosting, a domain name, or anything more than the 
ability to access the Web site in order to get started.
 
I cover the differences between hosted and installable blog software in 
Chapter 3.
Signing up and getting started is a simple process. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Point your Web browser to www.tumblr.com.
 
 The main Tumblr page opens.
 
2. Type your e-mail address into the Email Address text box.
 
3. Type a password of your choice into the Password text box.
 
4. Type a URL (usually the name of the blog you’re creating) into the URL 
text box.
 
5. Click the Sign Up and Start Posting button, as shown in Figure 6-3.
 
 Tumblr checks to see whether the URL you requested is available. If it 
isn’t, go back to Step 4 and try again until you find an available URL.
 
 If the URL you want to use is available, Tumblr sets up your blog, and 
you’re ready to starting posting!

 Chapter 6: Starting a Micro Blog
Creating a Text Post
Tumblr allows you to create blog posts by using text, photos, quotes, links, 
chat excerpts, audio files, and video. I show you how to post entries that 
include these different elements in the following sections. For more on 
including audio and video in your blog posts, jump to Chapters 11 and 12.
Create a quick text post in your Tumblr blog by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Text Post icon (a capital T) on your Tumblr dashboard.
 
 Tumblr displays the Add a Text Post page.
 
2. (Optional) Give your blog post a title in the Title field.
 
3. Type the text of your blog post in the Post field.
 
 Use as much or as little text as you want.
If you’re ready, you can post to your blog right now by clicking Create post, 
or you can spend a little time making your post fancy. In the following sec-
tion, you can find out about the options.
Formatting your blog post
Tumblr, like most blog software, gives you the ability to format your blog post 
while you create it. The icons just above the Post field, shown in Figure 6-4, 
enable you to format what you’ve written.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Use the 
formatting 
tools in 
Tumblr to 
format your 
blog posts.
 

126
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Tumblr uses a WYSIWG (what you see is what you get) interface, which 
shows you the effect of a tool in your blog post right when you apply it. This 
list describes each of the available tools:
 
✓ Bold: Make any text in your blog post bold by clicking and dragging over 
the text that you want to affect, and then clicking the Bold icon. The 
selected text is made bold.
 
✓ Italic: Italicize any text in your blog post by clicking and dragging over 
the text that you want to affect, and then clicking the Italic icon. The 
selected text is then shown in italics.
 
✓ Strikethrough: This style is commonly applied to text that you need to 
correct. Click and drag over the text that you want to affect, and then click 
the Strikethrough icon. The selected text is then made strikethrough.
 
✓ Unordered List: In Web browsers, unordered lists are usually displayed 
as bulleted lists (like this list you’re reading right now). You can most 
easily use this tool by typing each list item into your blog post on a 
separate line. Click and drag to select all the items, and then click the 
Unordered List icon.
 
✓ Ordered List: In Web browsers, ordered lists usually appear as num-
bered lists. You can most easily use this tool by typing each list item 
into your blog post on a separate line. Click and drag to select all the 
items, and then click the Ordered List icon.
 
✓ Indent: Indent a line or paragraph of text by clicking anywhere in the 
line or paragraph of text that you want to affect, and then selecting the 
Indent icon. Your text moves to the right.
 
✓ Outdent: You can outdent only text that you’ve previously indented. 
Click anywhere in the line of text from which you want to remove indent-
ing, and then select the Outdent icon.
 
✓ Insert/Edit Photo: Add photos to your blog posts by linking to them on 
other Web sites. I give you step-by-step instructions for adding photos 
to your posts in the following section.
 
✓ Insert/Edit Link: Make any text or image in your blog a clickable link to 
any Web site. I give you step-by-step instructions for adding a link in the 
section “Adding links to your post,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Unlink: You can remove a link that you added by clicking the linked text 
or photo, and then clicking the Unlink icon.
 
✓ Toggle Spellchecks: Not a great speller? (You aren’t alone.) Click the 
Spellcheck icon to run a spellchecker on your text. If you click the small 
arrow to the right of the icon, you can choose another language for the 
spellcheck default.

127
 Chapter 6: Starting a Micro Blog
 
✓ Edit HTML Source: Are you an HTML guru? If you want to edit the 
source code of your blog post directly, click the Edit HTML Source icon 
and go to town.
 
Appendix B, at the end of this book, gives you some basic HTML editing code, 
if you’re starting to explore this area.
Use the tools described in the preceding list to format your text, and when you’re 
ready, move to the following section to add an image to your text blog post.
Adding an image to your post
Blog posts are more fun with photos! If you want to add an image to a text 
blog post on your Tumblr blog, you first need a photo on the Web. A lot of 
bloggers set up accounts with the photo-sharing site Flickr (www.flickr.
com), post their photos there, and then include the ones they want to share 
via their blog by using Tumblr. On Flickr, you can also republish many 
photos by others, but be sure to check the licensing restrictions so that you 
don’t inadvertently violate someone’s copyright.
To find out more about copyright and photos, jump to Chapter 10. For now, 
feel free to experiment with a photo that I took, which you can view at www.
flickr.com/photos/supersusie/3815946553.
Follow these steps to place an image from Flickr into your Tumblr text blog 
post:
 
1. Use a Web browser to go to a photo on Flickr, such as www.flickr.
com/photos/supersusie/3815946553.
 
2. Click the Add Sizes icon directly above the image.
 
 Flickr takes you to a Download page for the image.
 
3. Select whichever size you want to use from the Available Sizes row of 
links.
 
 Flickr displays the image at the dimensions you chose. In my example, I 
selected Small.
 
4. In the area labeled To Link to This Photo, click and drag to select the 
image URL in the photo URL box, as shown in Figure 6-5.
 
5. Press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) or select Copy from the browser Edit 
menu to copy the image URL.

6. In your Tumblr text blog post, click where you want to put your photo.
 
7. Click the Insert/Edit Photo icon.
 
 Tumblr opens the Insert/Edit Image window, shown in Figure 6-6.

window

129
 Chapter 6: Starting a Micro Blog
 
8. Click in the Image URL field and press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to 
paste the URL into the field.
 
 You can type a description into the Image Description field, but you 
don’t have to.
 
 Tumblr calculates the dimensions of the image that you’re using and 
places those values in the Dimensions fields after you provide the URL. 
Web images are measured in pixels. 
 
9. Select an option from the Alignment drop-down list.
 
 I chose Right because I want to put the image on the right side of the text.
 
10. Change the values in the Dimensions fields if you want to resize the 
image.
 
11. Click the Insert button to close the window and place the image in 
your blog post.
 
 Tumblr displays the image in your blog post.
Adding links to your post
Links add a lot of value to a blog post by giving your readers the resources 
to explore a topic further or find more information about your discussion or 
idea. As long as you link to useful information, don’t hesitate to add links to 
your posts.
You can add links to both text and images. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select text or click an image in your blog post.
 
2. Click the Insert/Edit formatting tool (it’s a small piece of chain).
 
 Tumblr opens the Insert/Edit Link window.
 
3. Type or paste a URL into the Link URL field.
 
 In this example, I’m linking to the image featured in the preceding sec-
tion, so I create a link back to Flickr by typing the following into the Link 
URL field: www.flickr.com/photos/supersusie/3815946553
 
 You can give a descriptive title to your link in the Title field, but you 
don’t have to.
 
 If you want to open the link in a new Web browser window, select Open 
Link in a New Window from the Target drop-down list. If you don’t select 
an option, the default behavior opens the link in the same window.

130
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
4. Click the Insert button to add the link to the text or photo in your blog 
post (shown in Figure 6-7).
 
 The image isn’t clickable in the editing screen because you’d have trou-
ble formatting or removing the link later if it was.
If you want to remove a link that you’ve created, you can easily do it. Simply 
click the text or photo on which you placed a link, and then click the Unlink tool.
Publishing your post
When you finish everything that you want to do to your blog post, it’s time 
to publish! Simply click the Create Post button, shown in Figure 6-8, and your 
post appears on your blog for others to view.
 
Click on the Advanced Options box (it’s in the upper-right of the Add a Text 
Post screen) to open the menu and type a date in the future for your blog post 
to publish if you want to plan ahead, instead of posting immediately.

Customizing Your Tumblr Blog
This section introduces you to the customization options for your Tumblr 
blog. You can change the look and feel of the blog, as well as some of the 
functionality. Adding your own touches really personalizes a blog and makes 
it feel more like home.
Get to the customization options by clicking the Customize link in the right 
column of your Tumblr Dashboard. A page that displays a preview of your 
blog opens, and the menu across the top enables you to adjust the following:
 
✓ Info: Update the following areas by using this option:
 
• Title: Give your Tumblr blog a name.
 
• Description: Some of the themes (discussed later in this list) dis-
play a short description text area. You can describe yourself, your 
blog, or whatever you think people might want to know about you 
and what you’re doing.
 
• Portrait Photo: Make your blog more your own by uploading a 
photo of yourself. Some themes display these images; some don’t.

132
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
 
• URL: If you want to change the URL of your blog at any point, you 
can take care of that here. Remember, you probably don’t want to 
change the URL of a blog that already has visitors because then 
they can’t find you easily anymore.
 
• Use a Custom Domain Name: If you buy your own custom domain 
name, you can tell Tumblr about it, and then use that domain to 
access your Tumblr blog. You can find information on buying 
domain names in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Theme: Change the appearance of your blog by choosing one of the 
design themes provided by Tumblr. Tumblr offers nearly 200 different 
options to choose from. If you’re good with HTML, you can also use this 
tab to create your own custom theme.
 
✓ Appearance: Even if you select a theme that you like, the Appearance 
tab allows you to further customize the colors. Clicking any color option 
displays a color picker, and from there, you can go crazy (or not).
 
✓ Feeds: If you have multiple blogs, or anything that provides an RSS feed, 
you can route those feeds into your Tumblr blog so that anything you 
post on those other blogs automatically becomes part of your Tumblr 
blog, too! Find more information on RSS in Chapter 13.
 
✓ Advanced: Anything you can customize that didn’t fit in the other cat-
egories seems to be available in the Advanced tab:
 
• Timezone: Set your time zone to match your geographic location 
(shown in Figure 6-9).
 
• Add Custom CSS: Some themes available on the Theme tab include 
custom Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) styles. If you’re not familiar 
with CSS, don’t worry about it. Custom CSS is part of creating 
advanced layouts.
 
Figure 6-9: 
You can 
customize 
your Tumblr 
blog without 
knowing a 
lot of code 
or technical 
stuff.
 

133
 Chapter 6: Starting a Micro Blog
 
• Post Count: Change the number of blog posts that appear on your 
blog’s home page.
 
• Options: Extend the functionality of your blog by adding some 
neat features, including enabling high-resolution photos, opening 
links in new windows, shortening RSS feed posts, adding descrip-
tive words to your URLs, enabling submissions from readers, and 
setting how you want search engines and Web site directories to 
handle your blog.
 
• Allow Search Engines to Index Your Tumblelog: Turning this 
option on means that your blog appears in the major search 
engines — a really good idea if you’re trying to build an audience!
 
• Ping the Blogosphere: This option notifies the blog search engines 
(Technorati, My Yahoo!, and others) when you add a post to 
your blog.
 
• Promote Me on Tumblr: Checking this option means your blog 
shows up on some Tumblr directory pages, making it accessible to 
those who visit the Tumblr Web site.
 
• Not Safe for Work (NSFW): If you’re blogging about sex-related or 
other workplace-sensitve topics, marking your blog NSFW alerts 
the directory and warns others.
 
✓ Location: Identify your geographic location so that people can discover 
your blog based on those coordinates in the Tumblr blog directory.
After you make updates in any of the customization tabs, be sure to click the 
Save Changes button at the top-right of the page. And then take a look at your 
blog so that you can be sure the changes were implemented correctly.
 
You can view your Tumblr blog at any time by pointing your Web browser 
to the URL that you chose when you signed up or by clicking the URL in the 
menu on the right side of the Dashboard, which you can see in Figure 6-10.

Exploring Tumblr Goodies
Tumblr offers fun extras for your blog on the Goodies page, accessible from 
the Account menu (see Figure 6-11).
 
Figure 6-11:

Goodies 
from the 
Account 
menu to 
play with

On the Goodies page, you can find information about posting to your blog by 
using your phone, instant messages, or e-mail and a third-party-applications 
directory that you can use to find applications that let you post photos, 
videos, and other content quickly. The directory also has extras that you can 
install on your blog itself to add — among other things — the ability to play 
your audio posts via a menu on the page.
 
My favorite addition available in the Goodies area is Call in Audio. It’s a really 
nice (and free) tool that you can use to call in and record audio posts by using 
a phone. You can create quick recordings on the go, and best of all, you don’t 
need to buy any extra equipment or software!

Part III
Fitting In and

In this part . . .
B
log in hand, you’re ready to join the ranks of the top 
bloggers in the world. This part helps you get there 
in style. Get to know your readers in detail, focusing on 
their likes and dislikes, and find out how to cultivate a fol-
lowing you can be proud of in Chapter 7. Even great blog-
gers have off days or need the occasional inspiration, so 
Chapter 8 walks you through developing great content 
and breaking through writer’s block. Also, discover how 
to build community, keep your blog spam-free, and gener-
ate interaction in Chapter 9.

Chapter 7
Finding Your Niche
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering blog genres
▶ Creating appealing blog posts
▶ Making connections with other bloggers
I
f you’re blogging only for your friends and family, you probably have a 
captive audience that stays interested, no matter what you choose to blog 
about on any given day. (Although, even your mom might get a little tired of 
hearing about what time you got up and what you had for lunch!)
Most bloggers, however, define blogging success as attracting, keeping, and 
growing an audience of interested readers who can’t wait for the next pearl of 
wisdom to leave their fingertips . . . preferably an audience that leaves com-
ments and interacts with the blogger and with other readers.
Creating this kind of blog is no small challenge: You’re in competition with 
every other source of news, information, and entertainment in your audience 
members’ lives (not to mention your own, if you have trouble finding time for 
blogging).
So, find a niche and exploit it fully. I have no way of knowing exactly what 
your niche is — that’s something for you to figure out — but I can give you 
ideas and suggestions to help you start turning your mental gears. This chap-
ter can help you find others blogging in your subject area, what they’re doing 
right, and how you can make the most of your subject.
Deciding What Belongs on Your Blog
You may find picking a niche and sticking with it tough to do. Fortunately, 
blogging gives you a lot of leeway in how you handle a subject, in evolving 
your own style, and in what you blog about. The medium allows for a lot of 
experimentation, and your readers likely welcome new approaches and ideas 
while you go.

138
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
For your own peace of mind, however, you probably want to pick a broad 
theme and then explore within that theme. Do you like books? Why not blog 
about what you’re reading and make recommendations? You can then take a 
natural leap to movies based on books, and to authors . . . even a simple idea 
can give you a lot of room to grow.
Some subject areas have worked as popular and successful blog topics 
already. You can take on the competition and start a blog about
 
✓ Your kids: Baby books might have gone out of style, but that doesn’t 
mean you can’t document your child’s growth in detail on a blog. 
Mommyblogging, as it’s called, is on the rise in a big way. Talk about a 
topic that has an infinite variety of discussions, products, problems, and 
cute photos!
 
✓ Your hobby or interest: Blogs are beautifully suited to help you make 
connections, so feel free to use yours to become part of a community 
of folks that shares your passion for knitting, sport fishing, geocaching, 
carpentry, or whatever your interest is.
 
✓ Technology: Many of the original bloggers chose technology as their 
focus — a great decision. People have a huge interest in technology 
and technology issues today. After all, more and more people have cell 
phones, personal computers, and MP3 players, and everyone has prob-
lems using them!
 
✓ Politics: Do I really need to point out that political commentary and criti-
cism can make a good blog? A number of popular political bloggers have 
turned their online punditry into thriving careers in traditional media.
 
✓ News of the weird: Some very popular blogs make the most of the many 
strange Web sites by posting links and quick summaries of the sites on 
their blogs. These blogs cater to the lazy man’s approach to surfing, and 
if you’re interested in sharing the quirky oddities that you find, you can 
definitely get an audience for them.
 
✓ Specialized news: Offer a service for your busy readers by aggregating all 
the news on a particular topic, including quick tidbits and links to sources. 
You can create this kind of blog for both serious and comic topics — cranial 
surgery techniques to coverage of the latest teen sensation.
 
✓ A personal diary: If you have enough going on in your life to keep you 
interested in it, you can stick with the tried and true blog. If you have a 
unique voice and great writing, you can attract readers who can become 
friends.
The following sections look at each of these topics in a little more detail.

 Chapter 7: Finding Your Niche
Mommyblogging
Generally speaking, mommyblogging is memoir-style blogging, detailing the 
trials, tribulations, and general hysteria of raising children.
 
Quite a few mommyblogs start before much mommying is going on — before 
or during pregnancy — and then proceed through infancy and upward. Don’t 
let the fact that you’re not quite a mommy yet deter you from starting a 
mommyblog.
They’re often hilarious, often heartbreaking, and so easy to identify with. If 
you don’t have children, you certainly were one once. Frankly, kids are funny.
You can find many great examples of mommyblogs out there; I had trouble 
picking just one to tell you about, but you can start exploring at the blog 
Woulda Coulda Shoulda (www.wouldashoulda.com). Mir, a mother of two, 
writes Woulda Coulda Shoulda, shown in Figure 7-1. Her blog has earned her
coverage in Parents Magazine, Redbook, and The Today Show; inclusion 
in an anthology; and gigs speaking about mommyblogging at the BlogHer 
Conference (www.blogher.com).

Turning your offline hobby into a blog
You probably already have offline hobbies that consume time and energy, 
and about which you have great passion. You also probably have plenty to 
say on the topic, but too few people are genuinely interested in hearing you 
expound about your hobby.
Find your compatriots online by starting a blog about your hobby and hooking 
into a community of people who share both your passion for the activity and 
also your passion for news and discussion about your hobby.
You can find many terrific hobby blogs out there; great blogs about everything 
from scrapbooking to jewelry-making to collecting airline safety cards.
One of my hobbies is knitting, and let me tell you, the knitters have caught onto 
blogging in a huge way! Bloggers who knit share stories about frustrating 
patterns, exciting yarns, sales, and more. I read knitting blogs because I can 
identify with what the blogger is describing, but also because I often find out 
something new.
One fun knitting blog is Yarn Harlot (www.yarnharlot.ca), written by a 
knitter living in Toronto named Stephanie Pearl-McPhee. Yarn Harlot (shown 
in Figure 7-2) is the online diary of a devoted knitter and author; Stephanie 
has also written six books of knitting humor. Her hilarious blog covers 
everything from knitting techniques to home renovations, and it never fails to 
entertain.

Talking technology
Can anyone ever know enough about technology to make everything he or 
she owns function? At least for me, the answer is no. Just when I start to feel 
reasonably competent with computers, a hard drive fails. And how often have 
I brought home a new cell phone, ripped open the box with great excitement, 
and then failed utterly to figure out how to get my contacts imported? It’s 
true — even I need technology help.
And I’m betting you do, too. Technology bloggers have figured this out, writ-
ing blogs that explain how to resolve common problems as well as blogs that 
whet your appetite for new gadgets. Don’t you always think that a new and 
better device can solve your problems with the one you have now?
You can find a number of highly successful technology blogs around the 
Web, including some that have been in existence for years and years. Some of 
these blogs are specialized to a particular kind of tool or software; some are 
just about conveying the latest and greatest across the field.
If you work in technology or just have a passion for it, you can start a blog 
around your enthusiasm. That’s what Dennis Lloyd did when he founded 
iLounge (www.ilounge.com).
iLounge, shown in Figure 7-3, covers anything and everything about Apple’s 
iPod and iPhone devices. Started in 2001, shortly after Dennis Lloyd first laid 
eyes on an iPod, it has grown from being a blog into a true community site, 
including forums and photo galleries, in addition to the news blogs.

Getting political with it
No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, you live in interesting 
political times. You’ll never be short of topics, from the latest political 
scandal to the next national election.
Some of the most popular political bloggers have turned their online musings 
into full-fledged careers in the media, from talk shows to newspaper columns. 
And some traditional journalists have bowed out of newspapers and television 
to move to a blog.
This niche has room for many kinds of blogs, from those criticizing national 
policy to those covering local school board and city elections. If you have 
a craving to get involved in politics but don’t want to run for office, a blog 
might be a great way to develop an effective voice. And if you’re a politician, 
you can follow the example of Barack Obama, who used a blog as part of his 
campaign strategy while running for the presidency of the United States (he 
won, by the way).
For some, the urge to sound off on politics has produced entirely new pub-
lications. Take, for example, Truthdig (www.truthdig.com), which won a 
2007 Webby Award in the Political Blog category. (The Webbys are the Web’s 
equivalent of the Oscars.) Shown in Figure 7-4, Truthdig was started by jour-
nalist Robert Scheer and publisher Zuade Kaufman to be a source for political 
commentary and news that challenges the “wisdom of the day.”

 Chapter 7: Finding Your Niche
Pointing out the strange
If it’s bizarre, you can probably find a Web site about it. Many bloggers make 
a blogging career out of pointing blog readers to the strangest of the strange 
Web sites. These blogs are often called link blogs, which consist primarily of 
short descriptions and links off into the wild world of the Web. Today’s blog-
ger, in an attempt to cultivate the perverse, hilarious, and just weird, often 
adds more commentary, but the effect is the same: The reader gets a daily 
dose of random tidbits to enjoy.
A good example of a blog in this area is The Obscure Store & Reading Room 
(www.obscurestore.typepad.com), which focuses on news stories that 
seem just too bizarre to be true — but actually are true. Postings on the day 
this chapter was written ranged from stories about a boy who reported his 
own mother to 911 from the car for her bad driving and a social networking 
community called Enemybook (see Figure 7-5).

Reporting news
The offline world is full of general news sources — the 200-page newspaper 
that struggles to appeal to all its readers or the broadcast news show that 
does local car chases and the weather well — and not much else. Specialized 
news sources are hard to come by.

144
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Online, the situation is a little different. Quite a few news outlets have opted 
to offer news personalization features, letting you customize the news that 
you consume by topics. But many folks who have specialized interests still 
have to look through a lot of news sources to find truly pertinent stories.
If you’re doing that kind of research for yourself, you can start a blog that 
shares your findings with others interested in the same topic. Are you an 
economist collecting stories about garbage production in North America? Or 
a marketing expert who keeps track of the latest guerilla marketing tactics in 
order to keep on your toes professionally? You can turn this research into a 
valuable blog for others who share your interest.
You can produce this format quite easily, as well, because posts are fre-
quently just pointers to a news story or article on another Web site — the 
value for readers in a blog of this kind is that someone else (the blogger) has 
already done the work of finding the news, so sending them to another site is 
actually an important part of the service you’re providing.
Quite a few bloggers have opted to develop blogs in a specialized news area 
and parlayed that success into a new revenue stream or sponsorship, so cre-
ating your own news blog might even prove to be a wise business move.
 
Even if you don’t put advertising on your specialized news blog, keeping a 
blog of this kind demonstrates that you’re on top of your field.
One journalist who left traditional media behind in order to serve as a clear-
inghouse of news about the media in Los Angeles is Kevin Roderick. His blog, 
LA Observed (www.laobserved.com), shown in Figure 7-6, is a must-read 
for journalists in Southern California and across the country. His blog is 
becoming quite a little empire while he expands into city hall and business 
coverage.
Revealing it all
If nothing in this chapter has appealed to you so far, perhaps you’re looking 
for the blog classic: a personal diary. Part memoir and part confessional, per-
sonal diaries on the Web cover every topic that life can serve up.
Personal diaries can be real snooze-fests or tearjerkers nonpareil. Much 
depends, of course, on the quality of the writing. But much also depends on 
what happens in the life being documented. Life bloggers, as they’re some-
times called, must deal with whatever comes up next for them, from wed-
dings to being fired or hired to being diagnosed with cancer.
These blogs are usually easy to relate to and easy to read; they’re also often 
humorous or heart-wrenching, and sometimes both. They take courage to 
write, whether read by millions or only five.

Learning from the Pros
After you choose a topic, you can work on producing a readable blog that 
you can be proud of. In the following sections, you get ideas for setting up a 
blog successfully by cultivating your own talents and observing what others 
are doing right.
When you blog, much depends on the quality of your writing and your ability 
to make a connection with your readers. Work on developing a dialogue with 
your readers. Life bloggers often create this connection by revealing common 
experiences that many people can identify with. Businesses can choose to 
start a blog that gives typically silent members of a company (such as high-
level executives or behind-the-scenes mechanics) a connection to customers.
 
Many blogs are maintained by more than one person; sometimes, contributions 
by several different people can enliven and enrich the conversation, as well as 
decrease the workload for any single blogger.
I cover creating great content in Chapter 8, and in that chapter, you can find 
out how to keep track of what’s working for other bloggers.
Lurking on other blogs
You can best figure out what will work on your blog by seeing what’s working 
on other blogs. If you aren’t a regular blog reader, find some blogs and start 
reading!
The old, old Internet term lurking describes Web users who look at blogs, 
mailing lists, online discussions, and forums, but don’t choose to participate 
in them. Lurking online doesn’t have any negative connotations, though the 
word does sound kind of sinister.
In truth, lurking can help you find out about what kinds of communication 
and interaction are appropriate when you’re new to a Web community or 
when you’re planning to start one yourself. The vast majority of Web users 
are actually lurkers; most people don’t do more than read or look at blogs.
Start your lurking career by finding a few blogs that you like, that you regard 
as competition, or that you find interesting for some reason. If you want to see 
a blog that has a very active, vocal audience, find one that has a lot of com-
ments and make sure that you read them all. Many of the blogs mentioned in 
this chapter fall smack into this category, so why not start with them?

147
 Chapter 7: Finding Your Niche
If you want to see how a blog evolves, find one that has been around awhile 
and look back through the site’s archives to see how it got started. Most of 
all, pay attention to what you find interesting about the blog.
 
Here are some issues that you can figure out from lurking on a blog:
 
✓ Posts: Watch what the blogger (or bloggers) posts about, how often they 
post, and what days and times attract readers. See whether you can 
understand what prompts a blogger to post.
 
✓ Interaction: Pay attention to the posts that get a lot of comments and 
responses, and try to understand what gets people talking.
 
✓ Resource use: Look for instances when the blogger chooses to include a 
link, a quote, or other resource, and what it adds to the conversation.
 
✓ Design: Keep an eye out for blog designs and styles that you might want 
to imitate on your own blog.
 
✓ Sidebar use: Look at the blog sidebars for cool technologies and tools 
that the blogger uses (and that you might be able use on your own blog).
 
You want interaction with your blog readers, but some comments can cause 
problems because they’re off topic or offensive, so you can use this opportu-
nity to see how other bloggers handle bad comments. Pay attention to whether 
a blog comment policy is in place and how the blogger enforces that policy. 
When does the blogger choose to remove or edit comments? Do you agree 
with his or her choices? How do you want to handle problem comments on your 
own blog? I talk more about handling spam and bad comments in Chapter 9.
While you lurk, keep a list of notes and ideas for reference later, especially 
for items that you think are good ideas but that you aren’t ready to imple-
ment quite yet. You can easily lose those first good ideas if you don’t keep 
track of them somehow.
 
What works for someone else might not work for you, and it doesn’t have to. 
The blogosphere is still young, and you have plenty of room and time to try 
new ideas. Rules and standards that others have adopted give you a good 
starting point, but you don’t have to use them if they don’t work for you.
Participating by commenting
When you’re comfortable, you can start participating in your favorite blogs. 
Leaving comments can start your interactions on a blog. You don’t have to 
take a long time to write comments, they help the blogger, and you might 
even further the conversation with your comment.

148
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Leaving comments gives you experience with participating in a blog audi-
ence, and when you have a blog of your own, you can comment on someone 
else’s blog to let others know about your own blog.
Many blog comment forms give you the chance to leave a URL when you post 
a comment, and the software often links your name to the URL. So, when you 
have a blog, leaving a comment that includes such a link is a bit like leaving 
a tiny, unobtrusive ad. When the blogger and other blog visitors read your 
comment, they might just choose to click the link and visit your blog, espe-
cially if they like what you had to say.
 
You might also get visitors who didn’t like what you say! You invite disagreement 
any time you put your opinion out into the world, but don’t let that stop you 
from doing it.
Some bloggers have made the mistake of abusing this little privilege, leaving 
comments that don’t add to the topic or say much, simply to get the links to 
their blogs on the other bloggers’ pages. Don’t make this mistake. Be a genuine 
member of the blogosphere and leave comments only when you truly have 
something to say. “Nice site” is neither interesting to read nor particularly 
helpful to anyone.
 
Leave comments that distinguish you as a thoughtful contributor to the topic. 
If you can answer a question posed by the blog post or provide information 
that seems to be missing, you really contribute value with your comment. But 
you can also just leave your own opinion, even if you completely disagree with 
what the blogger is saying.
Reaching Out to Other Bloggers
Don’t forget that other bloggers are your primary audience. These folks are 
online and already familiar with blogs, and you’re likely to find other bloggers 
with whom you have things in common — maybe even the subject of your blog.
Meeting with bloggers in person and communicating with them online are 
terrific ways to network and market your blog. A lot of bloggers list the blogs 
that they read right beside their blog posts in the sidebar called a blogroll, so 
you might be able to generate some additional readership if you create rela-
tionships with bloggers.
Meeting in person
This is going to sound really old school, but you can turn online acquain-
tances into offline friends. In fact, it can be pretty fun.

149
 Chapter 7: Finding Your Niche
For example, on a recent visit to Boston, I posted on the Rockin’ Sock Club 
blog asking for yarn store recommendations, and I offered to meet with any 
knitters in town who wanted to get together. (The Rockin’ Sock Club is a 
sock-knitting club put together by Blue Moon Fiber Arts. Only members of 
the sock club can post comments and blog posts.) As a result, I had a great 
afternoon with people I never would have met otherwise.
You don’t have to knit socks to get together with bloggers, though. Most 
cities have an active community of bloggers that you can cultivate:
 
✓ Be sure to include your e-mail address or even a cell phone number on 
your blog, and let people know that you want to make new friends. Look 
for similar information on the blogs that you read if you’re interested in 
getting in touch with a blogger.
 
✓ Look for bloggers who identify their location and get to know them on 
their blogs by posting comments.
 
✓ Visit Upcoming (http://upcoming.yahoo.com) or Meetup (www.meet
up.com), and search for blogger get-togethers in your area. Many bloggers 
network with other nearby bloggers on a regular basis. You can even 
look up get-togethers when you’re visiting a new place.
 
✓ Organize your own get-together and publicize it on your blog, Twitter, or 
on Upcoming or Meetup.
Using social networks
Social networking sites are designed to connect you with your current group 
of friends, and then extend those connections out to their friends. Each site 
that I mention in this section has a different mechanism for making that 
happen, and different types of community interaction occur. LinkedIn (www.
linkedin.com), for example, is a professional networking site designed to 
showcase your work background and interests so that you can make connec-
tions to others in your field.
You can make friends in social-networking online communities, such as Twitter, 
Friendster, LinkedIn, MySpace, and Facebook. Social networking sites usually 
give bloggers a way to link to blogs, or even to notify others about new blog 
posts via profile pages, so if you’re looking for online connections in the blog-
ging community, these communities are a great place to start.
 
In fact, a lot of bloggers regard their blogs as a form of networking, and they’re 
already looking to make these kinds of connections via social networking 
Web sites.

150
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Facebook (www.facebook.com) is more about cementing your social friend-
ships, even for tracking down old friends from high school with whom you 
might have lost touch. It has great additional applications and games that 
you can use to break the ice with a new friend.
Regardless of whether the folks in your social network have blogs, you can 
use the site to let them know about your blog, building up your audience and 
hopefully the participation on it by leveraging the goodwill of people you 
know and the people they know!

Chapter 8
Creating Great Content
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering who your audience is
▶ Getting words onto your blog
▶ Adding value by including links
▶ Planning for blogging dry spells
A
 lot of elements work together to make a blog work well, from a well-
designed layout to fancy technical widgets, but none of those things 
can substitute for good content aimed at the right audience. In fact, if you 
write (or podcast or take photos) well and you’re reaching readers who are 
engaged by your style and content, you can actually be successful without 
spending any time at all on how your blog looks. Good content can even make 
your readers forgive an awkward interface or missing bells and whistles, such 
as RSS feeds or categories.
So, if you do nothing else to make your blog succeed, focus on producing great 
writing, photos, audio, or videos. Know what your audience wants and deliver 
it. In fact, try slightly under-delivering it — keep your audience wanting more.
This chapter offers pointers on writing well for the Web and understanding 
what your audience expects from your blog.
 
In this chapter, I refer to competitors when I am describing other bloggers 
who are covering the same subject area as your blog, or trying to reach the 
same audience you want to attract. Remember that in the blogosphere the 
atmosphere is very collaborative; however, competitors can also be friends, 
contacts, occasional contributors to your blog, participants in your comments 
area, and good resources for information. So when I talk about competitors, I 
do so in the friendliest sense of the word!

152
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Knowing Your Audience
First things first: How well do you know your audience? Are you hitting the 
right notes to attract the readers you want in the quantity you want them?
 
Not all bloggers care about the number of readers they get, but they do care 
about getting the right eyes on their words. Regardless of whether you’re 
number-obsessed or just focused on your niche, you need to understand your 
audience and what your readers are looking for.
You can get an idea about your audience by
 
✓ Using statistics software to track the number of visitors to your blog and 
what links those visitors click
 
✓ Noting the content that elicits the biggest and best response from your 
readers (or the response that you want, even if it isn’t the biggest)
 
✓ Looking at the blogs of others in your subject area to see what you can 
find out from their comment activity, search engine rankings, and 
other data
You might have to wait awhile for statistics and comments, but you can 
easily look at others’ blogs, even if you’re still developing your own blog. I 
talk in detail about measuring site traffic and statistics in Chapter 16, so jump 
there if you want to find out more about the readers you already have.
Finding your competitors
To find your competitors, you must first define your own niche. Your niche 
consists of what you’re blogging about, the topics you cover, and what words 
you use most frequently in your posts. You use these keywords to describe 
yourself, and visitors use them to find you when they conduct a search on 
Google, Yahoo!, or another search engine.
Use these descriptive words (plus the word blog) to search for yourself on 
Google or another search engine. Investigate the results that come up and 
look for blogs that have content (never mind the look and feel of the blog for 
now) similar to the content you’re creating or want to create.
You can also use one of the blog search engines, such as Technorati (www.
technorati.com), Google Blogs search page (http://blogsearch.
google.com), or Icerocket (www.icerocket.com). Figure 8-1 shows the 
results of a search on Technorati that used the terms blogs, blogging, audi-
ence, niche, and success. These results show posts from blogs that talk about 
these topics.

153
 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
 
Figure 8-1: 
Use 
Technorati 
to find the

You want to find other blogs that inhabit your niche, and then spend a week 
or two investigating these blogs. Your mission: Find the secret of their suc-
cess, which I discuss in the following section. You want to know how those 
blogs get readers and how they keep those readers coming back for more.
Discovering the secrets of success
While you watch your competitors’ blogs, you have a chance to figure out 
what topics they blog about, of course, but also how they reach out to their 
audience.
 
Your competitors might not be blogging in the most effective way. While you 
look at these blogs, decide whether your competitors are actually reaching 
their audience successfully or whether they’re falling short. You can figure out 
as much from a failing blog as you can from a successful one.
While you visit these blogs, keep a journal of your impressions. Watch the 
following to investigate how these bloggers handle publishing and outreach:
 
✓ How frequently the blogger puts new posts on the blog: Frequency of 
blog posts is a big deal. Any blogger can tell you to post “frequently,” 
but almost none can tell you want that really means. I talk more about 
how often you should post in the section “Writing Well and Frequently,” 
later in this chapter, but you can explore this idea by noting how often 
your competitors choose to post to their blogs. Do they create new 
posts daily, or even multiple times a day? Or do they post a few times a 
week, or even once a week? When you become a reader of that blog, do 
you find yourself wanting more content or less?

154
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
 
✓ When the blogger publishes blog posts: Time of day can have a surpris-
ing impact on how readers receive a blog post. You need to reach your 
audience members when they’re likely to be sitting at their computers. 
If your audience consists of stockbrokers, time your posts so that new 
content becomes available just before business hours start on the East 
Coast, not during dinner time on the West Coast. If you’re targeting 
teens, try to publish before or after school hours, and not while they’re 
sitting in homeroom.
 
 Sure, your readers can visit your blog anytime and pick up content that 
you posted in the middle of the night, but you can impress them with a 
blog that always seems to have fresh content just when they want it.
 
✓ The length of posts on the blog: You might be surprised to know that the 
ideal length of a blog post is a hotly debated topic among experienced 
bloggers. Some bloggers swear by the short-and-sweet recipe that guides 
most Web writing: Blog posts should get to the point quickly and allow 
readers to get back to their busy days with the information that they 
need. Others find that longer posts — even essays — do the job, keeping 
readers on the site longer and providing more thoughtful commentary. 
The topic of your blog, as well as your audience’s appetite and available 
time, dictate the natural length of your blog posts. Looking at your com-
petitors’ blogs can tell you the number of words that they find optimal in 
a blog post, which you can use as a starting point for your blog.
 
✓ When the blogger links to outside Web sites: Linking to other blogs 
and Web sites is a great way to serve the reader. By pointing out other 
sources of information or even other blogs, you help them become more 
knowledgeable about your topic and keep them engaged with it. So, 
when do your competitors choose to link to other sites, and what sites 
do they link to? Are the links designed to entertain, educate, or inform? 
Are links included in the text of the post or broken out at the end? What 
makes you click a link yourself?
 
 I talk a lot more about linking other sites as a strategy for reaching your 
audience in the section “Linking to Serve the Reader,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ When the blogger addresses his or her audience directly: A lot of 
bloggers use a very personal writing style that directly acknowledges the 
reader, kind of like this book. You might enjoy being addressed directly by 
a blogger because the conversation feels more personal. Or, depending on 
the topic of the blog, perhaps a more formal, almost academic approach is 
more appropriate. Either way, check out how your competition is handling 
this issue. When do they ask the readers for input or feedback, and how do 
they phrase those requests? Do readers actually respond, and if so, to 
what kinds of approaches?
 
✓ Use of multimedia, such as photos, audio, and videos: Although the 
majority of blogs are made up of a whole lot of words, you can still throw 
in the occasional (or even frequent) picture or video. In fact, bloggers 

155
 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
do it all the time to dress things up visually and keep readers interested. 
Take a look at how your competitors handle including multimedia in 
their blogs. Do they use photos to illustrate the ideas in the posts or just 
to attract the eye? What about animation or video? Do posts that have 
these extras get more comments or fewer? Do you like getting informa-
tion in these other formats, or do you find it distracting?
 
✓ Posts that get a lot of comments and posts that get very few: A blog 
that gets a lot of comments signals that the blogger is resonating with 
his or her audience — even if just to make audience members mad. A 
blog that has no or few comments probably just leaves people flat (or 
maybe isn’t even read). Not all bloggers get hundreds of comments 
every time they post. Some blog posts just get better response than 
others, and part of what makes a blogger successful is being able to 
know what makes those posts really work so that they can repeat the 
success. Watch your competitors’ blogs to see when a post gets a big 
response and look at what kind of response it gets.
 
 Also, watch for the posts that don’t get any response — you want to 
figure out why those posts didn’t work so that you don’t make the same 
mistake!
 
✓ The writing style of the blogger: Bloggers need to have good content, 
and for most bloggers, that comes down to having an accessible and 
readable writing style. For those blogs in your niche that attract par-
ticipation and good press, what style does the blogger use? Personal? 
Professional? Humorous? What tone appeals to readers and makes them 
come back to the blog again and again? What approach do you find more 
readable and engaging?
You can use these same points of analysis on your own blog, too. After you 
have your blog up and running for awhile, take a look at your own content 
with the same critical eye that you use on your competitors. What are you 
doing right and wrong?
You may find this exercise hard to do. I’m sure you think everything on your 
blog is great — after all, no one sets out to write a bad blog post! Still, some 
of your posts are likely more popular with readers than others, and if you 
can figure out why certain posts work better than others, you can repeat 
that success again and again. In fact, developing a critical eye for your own 
content can really help you make your blog succeed: This medium doesn’t 
hold still, and you need to be able to adapt your style and content while your 
audience grows and changes. Consider conducting this kind of survey of your 
content a couple of times a year to make sure that you stay on track and topi-
cal to the folks you want to attract, even if you’re really aiming for just your 
immediate family.

156
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Profiling your audience
When you finish your competitive analysis (which I explain how to do in the 
preceding section) and after you review your own content successes and fail-
ures, picture your audience in your mind’s eye.
Create a clear picture for yourself of just who’s in your audience. If you don’t 
have the audience you’re targeting at this point, you can try to develop a pic-
ture of who you want in your audience.
You don’t actually have to draw a picture, though. You can create this profile 
in words that describe the characteristics of your ideal audience member. 
You can include anything that you want in this profile, from shoe size to per-
sonal hang-ups — any detail that helps you really know this person better 
and create content for this person on your blog.
 
Don’t just say, “My ideal audience is anybody who is interested in [insert your 
blog topic here].” You already know that — otherwise, this person wouldn’t be 
on your blog in the first place. You want to capture all the details that make 
this person different, unique, and interesting.
Take Gizmodo, as shown in Figure 8-2. Gizmodo (www.gizmodo.com) is 
a techie blog featuring information on gadgets and other nifty technical 
devices. The blog’s tagline is “Gizmodo, the gadget guide. So much in love 
with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural.” Right away, you know that the audience 
for Gizmodo is more that just those interested in gadgets — Gizmodo read-
ers adore gadgets, see them as playthings meant to entertain and amuse, and 
are perhaps unhealthily engaged by them (maybe at the expense of other 
hobbies and pursuits). And those audience members want their gadget news 
piping hot, fresh off the presses. Doesn’t that tell you more about what kinds 
of posts will work best to attract and keep these kinds of readers?
Some of the concepts and facts that you might want to explore for your pro-
file include
 
✓ Age
 
✓ Gender
 
✓ The nature of their interest in your topic (for example, familial, personal, 
emotional, or professional)
 
✓ Geographic location and proximity to you or to the topic of your blog
 
✓ Lifestyle (for example, workaholic, homebody, retired, world traveler, 
and so on)

157
 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
 
✓ Occupation
 
✓ Education level
 
✓ Marital status
 
✓ Interests and hobbies
 
✓ Income
 
✓ Political leanings
 
Heck, you might even think about what your ideal audience member reads, 
eats, or wears; his or her sleeping habits and style of personal hygiene; and 
so on. If a specific detail seems like it might inform your writing and content, 
throw it into the mix.
When you have a reader profile in hand, you can be more targeted about what 
you choose to write about and how you address that audience.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Writing Well and Frequently
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: The primary ingredients for a successful 
blog are
 
✓ Good content
 
✓ Frequently updated content
But what do I really mean by good and frequently?
Good content compels, satisfying the readers’ immediate interests but leaving 
them hungry for more. Think of a blog post like an appetizer: It should whet 
the appetite, pique the palette, and sustain the diner until the next course 
arrives. You don’t want to give your readers Thanksgiving dinner — you want 
them to come back, and come back soon.
As a general rule, blogging has evolved into quite a personal, conversational 
medium, and textual blogs have a strong feel of the author and his or her 
personality. The first blogs were actually online diaries, and even today, most 
bloggers choose to use words such as I or my in their blog posts, creating 
an intimate and open feel — even on corporate blogs. This first-person writ-
ing differs dramatically from most corporate communication, which at best 
refers to the company as our and at worst only refers to the company by its 
full and official name.
Respecting copyright
Anything and everything you see on the Internet 
is protected by copyright. Copyright is just what 
it sounds like: “the right to copy” an original 
creation. Copyright law protects authors by 
giving that right solely to him or her.
Unless the creator of an image or photo spe-
cifically licenses his or her copyright to you, 
you can’t reuse it, even if you give the author 
credit or link back to the original story. (This 
rule applies to text, photos, and videos, too.) But 
this rule has a few exceptions: You can quote 
a news story or a blog post on your blog if you 
use only part of it, and as long as you don’t take 
credit for the work. Commentary and critique 
also allow you to excerpt a piece of text or other 
work. But don’t think that just because you’re 
the subject of a story or blog post that you have 
the right to repost the entire article on your blog 
or Web site. You don’t. When in doubt, ask and 
get permission.
At www.copyright.gov get the goods on 
what you can use on your blog without running 
afoul of the law that protects other authors’ 
text. You might particularly want to read the 
areas around fair use, especially if you plan to 
write reviews.

 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
Take, for example, the McDonald’s blog, Open for Discussion (www.cr
mcdonalds.com/publish/csr/home/_blog.html), written by McDonald’s 
Vice President Bob Langert. In an August 20, 2007 post, Bob writes:
“We all have one — a pet peeve that we just can’t ditch. I was recently 
reminded of my #1 pet peeve while reading the latest account 
of McDonald’s Moms’ Quality Correspondents. They reported that 
McDonald’s beef is 100% pure USDA-inspected beef. Frankly, I don’t 
think this should be any kind of big ‘Aha’, and I am amazed that so many 
people question this established fact.”
Figure 8-3 shows this post.
Writing in the first person isn’t as easy as it looks (or reads); after all, most 
people spend years training to write more formally and commonly produce 
all kinds of documents in which first person writing is emphatically not suitable: 
memos, reports, new stories, invoices, and so on. You may have trouble find-
ing an authentic, genuine voice that really feels comfortable. My best advice 
is to just practice, practice, practice.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Think of your blog posts like letters or e-mails. Speak directly and simply, like 
you would in a personal note or letter. Try not to over-think your words, but 
don’t go right into stream of consciousness (fun to write, hard to read).
 
One of my favorite techniques for making my blog posts readable is to close 
the door of my office and read my post out loud. If it sounds close to something 
I might actually say in conversation, it hits the right tone for a blog post — at 
least, on my blog.
When it seems appropriate, try using humor and jokes, especially if you can 
be self-deprecating. People just love self-deprecating bloggers. Here’s an 
example from Stephanie Pearl-McPhee’s Yarn Harlot blog (www.yarn
harlot.ca):
“I think that I can’t be the only one who finds LA a little hard on the ol’ 
self esteem. There is an alarmingly high ratio of tall, beautiful people 
compared to us ordinary souls, and it usually doesn’t take long for me, 
the shabby and usually bra-less to feel out of place.”
Sometimes I find it difficult to write to some anonymous audience member 
and get a conversational tone, so I imagine that I’m writing to a good friend. If 
I can be interesting enough to hold her attention, it ought to do the trick for 
my readers, too!
 
If you make your blog informal and conversational, you still can’t completely 
ignore spelling, grammar, and sentence structure. Some bloggers do opt for 
a completely unedited approach, right down to not using capital letters, but 
keep in mind that people have more trouble reading poorly formulated writ-
ing, not less. If you have a business or professional blog, you definitely need 
to pay attention to spelling and grammar because these little details influence 
your credibility. Do your readers a favor — use the grammar and spellcheck 
functions of your word processor.
On the other hand, many blogs have made a reputation based on using 
incorrect spelling or grammar! An example is the funny blog I Can Has 
Cheezburger? (www.icanhascheezburger.com), which has built its popu-
larity largely on bad spelling in hilariously captioned photos of cats.
 
Many bloggers like to quote news articles and blog posts, and then expand on 
them. If you take this approach, make sure that you understand the rules of 
copyright law when you use someone else’s words — it’s always best to ask 
permission! For more, read the sidebar “Respecting copyright,” in this chapter.

 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
Linking to Serve the Reader
Links — you need ’em. You may worry that by providing a link to a news 
story or online article, you’re sending your readers away from your site into 
the black hole of the Internet, never to return. Your readers might, in fact, 
click the link and go read the article. But they probably won’t forget where 
they found the link.
On a blog, links are just as much a resource as any other information that you 
provide. In fact, many blogs actually consist of collections of links around a 
topic or theme, pulled together to inform or entertain the blog’s readers.
 
If you’re providing good content and expanding on that content by using links, 
you’re doing your readers a service that they won’t forget — one they likely 
come back to you for.
Joey deVilla doesn’t shy away from adding links to his blog posts on The 
Adventures of Accordion Guy in the 21st Century (www.joeydevilla.com), 
as shown in Figure 8-4.
 
Figure 8-4:

In a September 20, 2007 post about the Canadian dollar’s parity with the U.S. 
dollar, he included links to bios of the U.S. president and Canadian prime 
minister in office during the last time the currencies were equal, and he pro-
vided links to pop culture references current at that time. Also, he collected a 
list of news stories that cover the event.
Speaking of dollars, links are the currency of the blogosphere. A lot of blog-
gers point their readers to blog posts that they find especially interesting, 
even going so far as to quote the other blogger. In the sidebars of their blogs, 
bloggers regularly build lists of links to blogs that they read. These lists are 
called blogrolls (see Chapter 20).

162
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
In general, bloggers are generous about linking to other blogs and Web sites 
because the favor is frequently returned. As the saying goes, “You have to 
spend a little to make a little.”
 
Adding links to your posts is a good thing . . . unless you’re irresponsible 
about what you link to. Take your responsibility as a publisher seriously and 
don’t send people to suspect resources or throw them into an adult-oriented 
site without warning.
 
When you link to a blog post, be sure you link to the permalink URL, not the 
blog’s home page. A permalink is the unique Web address for an individual 
blog post — the permanent link to that page. You should use the permalink 
because the blogger might update the blog any time after you create the link, 
pushing the post that you mention down or even off the blog’s home page.
The Web Style Guide (www.webstyleguide.com) covers everything from 
good Web design standards to graphics production, but you can probably 
benefit most from Chapter 6 of the guide, which covers links, titles, and 
common online styles.
Breaking Through a Blank Screen
At times, even outstanding bloggers hit dry spells and can’t think of a word 
to write. You can safely anticipate a day sometime in the lifespan of your blog 
when you literally have nothing to say to your readers, no matter how much 
enthusiasm you have for your topic.
This phase will pass, but sometimes, you need a little help pushing back to a 
productive spot. Here are a few tips for making it through your dry spell:
 
✓ Stockpile a few evergreen posts. In newsrooms across the U.S., journal-
ists regularly create evergreen stories (stories that can be printed or tele-
vised at any time and still be interesting). You can also put together a 
few evergreen blog posts that you can keep on hand against a day when 
your creative juices temporarily dry up. You can also use these kinds 
of posts for days when you’re sick or on vacation, but still want to have 
something for your blog. A lot of blog software allows you to schedule a 
publication date for a blog post in the future, so you can even set these 
posts to go up automatically and take a well-deserved break.
 
✓ Ask a friend to guest blog for a few days. Bring some new perspective 
to your blog when you have none left yourself by asking a friend, colleague, 
fellow blogger, or even a critic to write some blog posts for you. Your 
readers might enjoy the change of style and tone (and if they don’t, you 

163
 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
make them that much happier when you come back!). Be sure to return 
the favor when your guest blogger has a dry spell of his or her own.
 
✓ Recycle an oldie but goodie. When you can’t think of exciting new con-
tent, bring out a great post from your archives. New readers appreciate 
seeing something they missed, and old readers might find new information 
in a second read. Professional blogger Darren Rowse points his readers 
to a list of best-of posts on ProBlogger (www.problogger.net). In fact, 
Darren pulls out the best posts of all time, for the month, for new read-
ers, and just some of his favorites (see Figure 8-5).
 
✓ Hold a contest. When the well has run dry, you can hold a contest. Ask 
your readers to submit funny photos or write a caption for one of your 
funny photos. Show them a bottle of jellybeans and ask for guesses 
about how many pieces of candy are in the bottle. You get the idea: 
Distract them with shiny, happy prizes! But make sure you’re fair and 
impartial in how you award prizes. If you say you plan to hold a raffle, be 
sure to actually do so!
 
✓ Post a photo. Rather than 1,000 words, put up a single photo. Take a pic-
ture of where you usually blog, show off your new laptop, or just take a 
walk in your neighborhood. You can dig out a photo of yourself as a kid 
or show that embarrassing haircut you had in the ’80s.
 
✓ Post about the books, movies, or television that you’re consuming. 
Tell folks about the other media you’re enjoying. You can even hook up 
an Amazon Associates account and earn a little money from your rec-
ommendations. (You can find out how to set up this kind of account in 
Chapter 17.)
 
✓ Give out your favorite recipe. Dig out the cookbook and find your 
grandmother’s fudge recipe or your mom’s apple pie recipe, and share it 
with your readers. Better yet, take a break from the computer and make 
the recipe yourself so that you can put up a photo with your post.

164
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
 
✓ Blog from a new location. Sometimes, breaking the routine can shake 
loose those recalcitrant brain cells. Try blogging from another room in 
your house, or head to the local Internet cafe or coffee shop.
 
✓ Record an audio podcast. If you can’t write, talk! Give the gift of your 
voice to your readers — listeners — by trying something new and differ-
ent. You might be pleasantly surprised and make podcasting a regular 
feature of your blog. Chapter 12 covers podcasting extensively.
 
✓ Do an interview. Ask a friend, colleague, neighbor, child, parent, boss, 
or public figure whether you can interview him or her for your blog. 
Type up a few questions, e-mail them off, and when the answers arrive in 
your inbox, a little copying and pasting should do the trick.
 
✓ Take a quiz. Let your readers know what superhero you are or what 
color your personality is by playing with some of the fun quizzes and 
polls online. The Superhero Quiz is at www.thesuperheroquiz.com 
(I’m Spider-Man), and you can find loads of others on blogthings (www.
blogthings.com) and Quiz Meme (www.quizmeme.com).
 
✓ Ask for suggestions from your readers. Appeal to your readers for help 
finding new topics to post about. Also, look through your old posts and 
see whether you can expand on a post that worked well; check out com-
ments and e-mails from readers, too!

Chapter 9
Building Community 
with Comments
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering what comments are and how to use them
▶ Maintaining and managing your blogging community
▶ Dealing with spammy comments on your blog
▶ Handling negative comments on other blogs
E
very blog should have comments. Love them or hate them, they’re an 
integral part of blogging. Comments provide the main source of inter-
action between you and your readership. Visitors to your blog can ask you 
questions, correct your writing, suggest your next blog topic, or leave a note 
to say hello.
Unfortunately, as interesting and thought-provoking as comment conver-
sations can be, they’re not without their challenges. Comment spam and 
negative commentary can take the joy out of blogging and make managing 
comments on your blog feel like a full-time job.
How you handle your blog community determines your level of stress and 
success. In this chapter, I talk about how you can set your own comment 
rules and monitor your community. I also give you some helpful hints about 
how to make your blog a positive place for conversation, as well as provide 
strategies for dealing with spammers and negativity.
Getting Interaction Going 
with Comments
Comments are an important part of a blog. When a blogger opts, through 
choice or necessity, to turn off commenting, the blogger loses some of what 

166
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
makes blogging such a dynamic, exciting medium: the interaction between 
blogger and readers. Not only the blogger loses out when he or she removes 
comments — most blog readers enjoy the comments left by others and often 
form a strong community feeling for fellow visitors.
A blogger may turn off comments when he or she simply doesn’t have the 
time or desire to read and respond to comments, or when the tenor of the 
comments becomes a problem. Popular blogger Heather Armstrong only 
selectively allows comments on her blog Dooce (www.dooce.com) because 
her religious views and style of blogging generate a lot of negative interaction 
with readers in the comments. Political bloggers often have similar problems.
For other bloggers, their main issue with comments is related to time. A pop-
ular blogger can get hundreds of comments on a single blog post, and it takes 
time to read and respond to those comments, much less remove any inappro-
priate comments. Spam can also lead a blogger to restrict comments. Just as 
with e-mail, spammers have discovered that they can throw their unwanted 
commercial messages (anyone need a refinance?) into blogs, and even with 
the best blog software, some spam messages end up on the blog.
Still, the vast majority of blogs allow comments, and those blogs benefit 
hugely from the interaction and fun that comments can generate. On a blog 
such as Grey Matter (www.greyswriters.com), from the writers of the TV 
show Grey’s Anatomy, readers really get involved with the show’s writers. In 
the comments, readers share their thoughts on the show, offering feedback 
and suggestions.
Getting involved
 
If you want to have a dialogue with your readers, you need to allow comments 
on your blog, whether you’re reaching out to your parents or to your customers.
Just because your blog posts have a comment form, though, people don’t 
necessarily just jump in and start commenting. You need to tailor your posts 
to elicit dialogue and feedback, perhaps even by going so far as to ask specifi-
cally for responses.
 
If the comment areas of your blog look a little bare, ask some friends to help 
by reading and commenting for a few weeks. Comments tend to generate more 
comments, if you can get the ball rolling.
Of course, the problem might lie with your content or approach, so don’t be 
afraid to experiment with your topic or style to try to get better results from 
your comment forms.

167
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
You want to be involved in your blogging community, right? If you don’t, then 
turn that comment function off. Here’s a quick checklist of tips for cultivating 
comments on your blog:
 
✓ Make it easy for your readers to comment. Sometimes, readers can 
have problems finding that Comment Now button or link. Keep your 
comment links visible to encourage people to comment.
 
✓ Ask questions of your readers. Get your readers to start participating 
by requesting advice, seeking out information, or asking for a recipe. 
The simple act of asking can do wonders for comments. Ask your visi-
tors to tell you stories, answer questions, or give advice. For instance, 
if you’re blogging about a frustrating travel experience, you might ask 
your readers for tips for the future. Or, if you’re looking for a new laptop 
bag, ask your readers to recommend bags that they like.
 
 Specific, rather than general, questions work best to start a conversation.
 
✓ Request topics or ideas. Requesting ideas about your blog topics can 
generate an amazing response. You may also invite readers to send in 
blog posts they write that could benefit the community of your site. (If 
you make this invitation, make sure that you’re clear about who owns 
the copyright! As the publisher of the content, you probably want to 
have the guest bloggers assign copyright to you.)
 
✓ Communicate with your readers. Make sure you’re actively talking to 
your readers by responding to the comments that they leave on your blog.
 
✓ Host comment-related contests. Think of ways that you can turn com-
ments into a contest. One common contest strategy involves asking 
people to leave a comment in order to enter a contest, and then drawing 
a winner randomly from those who participate. 
Also, get involved with your blogging community. Visit other blogs and use 
their comment systems to get involved with their readers. In return, if you’re 
active enough with your comments, those readers visit you, as well.
Enabling comments
Most modern blog software, regardless of whether it’s hosted or installed on 
your own Web server (see Chapter 3), has tools that allow your visitors to 
comment and tools that allow you to handle the comments you receive. Check 
your documentation to figure out what functionality the software you’re using 
offers — and don’t forget that you may be able to customize the way in which 
your comment tools are configured to better suit your preferences and 
audience.

168
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
If you find yourself in a situation in which you use software that doesn’t have 
that capability, and you can’t change software, you can find third-party solu-
tions. In fact, many bloggers who use top-of-the-line blog software opt to use 
another tool for comments because they want specific functionality.
One such tool is DISQUS (www.disqus.com), which offers a truly impressive 
range of functionality options — plus, it’s free! You can use it to
 
✓ Allow visitors to track comments via e-mail or RSS.
 
✓ Allow visitors to rank comments on the site or reply to a comment directly.
 
✓ Allow visitors to flag comments as inappropriate or spam.
 
✓ Sort how the comments appear, either by date or popularity.
 
✓ Moderate comments to remove, edit, and screen out unwanted content.
Managing Comments
Like all good things, comments require care and feeding. Although I believe 
the resulting community dialogue makes that effort worthwhile, I can’t deny 
that managing comments involves real work and time. In the following sections, 
I talk about ways you can set up your blog for comments, prevent possible 
problems, and deal with problems if they do crop up.
Establishing community guidelines
You want comments, but you want the right comments. Ideally, your visitors 
provide on-topic, interesting, and never ever profane feedback. Of course, we 
don’t actually live in an ideal world, so setting some community guidelines 
for participation on your site can help clarify your expectations to your read-
ers. Make those guidelines straightforward and clear. Your rules may exclude 
anything you want. Common blog rules outlaw comments that include
 
✓ Racist or bigoted speech
 
✓ Sexually explicit content
 
✓ Discussions or descriptions of violent or criminal acts
 
✓ Unlicensed copyrighted material
 
✓ Threats, harassment, or personal privacy violations
You have to enforce these rules, but simply having them in place can deter 
troublemakers from posting at all, particularly if you’re scrupulous in 
enforcing your guidelines quickly.

169
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
The blogging software solution that you use might also have a set of stan-
dards in place with which both you and your visitors must comply. For exam-
ple, Microsoft Windows Live Spaces (http://home.spaces.live.com), 
a hosted blogging solution, has a community code of conduct that you must 
enforce on your blog (shown in Figure 9-1). Every hosted blogging service has 
its own set of rules that you should be aware of. Don’t get caught breaking 
the rules!
 
You may need to adapt any guidelines that you create over time, especially while 
your blog grows in popularity or changes its focus. Be sure to set a time every so 
often to review your own guidelines and make changes. You might include your 
visitors in the development of the community guidelines, checking with your 
readers about what you do to protect them. They’ll love you for it.
Figure 9-2 shows the blog comment policy written by Kathryn Lord, who 
blogs about online dating and relationships on her Web site (www.find-a-
sweetheart.com). For Kathryn, it all comes down to having common cour-
tesy for her and for other readers — mud-slinging comments are history.

On Greg Mankiw’s blog for economics students, he asked his readers to simply 
treat each other with respect: “Please approach this blog with the civility you 
would bring to a college seminar. Don’t post anything here that you wouldn’t 
say to a fellow seminar participant face to face.” You can read Greg’s full blog 
comment policy at http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/09/
comments-policy.html. Unfortunately, Greg Mankiw couldn’t enforce his 
comments policy and decided to close comments entirely.
 
If you’re thinking about writing a blog comment policy, take a look at what 
other bloggers have done. A quick search on Google for blog comment policy 
turns up some well-done policies that might give you ideas. And remember, 
you can add a blog comment policy at any time and amend your policy as 
needed.
Editing comments
Sometimes, a reader posts a legitimate comment that you need to alter in 
some way. For example, you might prefer to remove profanity from other-
wise legit comments or edit a long Web link that’s breaking a page layout. 
Whatever the situation, edit a reader’s comments delicately.

171
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
Some of your readers might react poorly to having their words edited, and 
of course, the last thing you intend is to insult a reader by pointing out spell-
ing or grammar issues. Use a sensitive hand, but remember that a comment 
on your blog is as much a part of the conversational give and take as your 
original blog posts. Not only that, you’re also responsible for the words on 
your blog and may feel that you have a duty to remove hateful or offensive 
language, especially if young audiences read your blog.
 
Your blog is your domain, your kingdom, and your place in the world, so your 
word is final. 
Of course, when you do choose to edit a comment, you might want to alert 
readers that you have done so and why, as I’ve done in comment #7 on my 
own blog, shown in Figure 9-3. You may also want to lay out in your blog 
comment policy circumstances in which you’ll edit comments. Both these 
techniques can head off accusations of censorship.

Deleting comments
Unfortunately, not all the comments on your blog are fun to read, or are even 
remarks that should stay on your blog. When it comes right down to it, you 
control which comments appear on your blog, whether you moderate them 
ahead of time or afterward. You need to moderate comments because quite a 
few of your blog’s comments probably come from spammers and add nothing 
to the conversation. But sometimes, you may need to delete comments from 
real people that are even on topic. Every blogger has to make a choice about 
what kinds of comments he or she needs to delete.
Bloggers choose to delete comments for these kinds of reasons:
 
✓ Comments that are off-topic for the post to which they’re attached (a 
common issue with spam comments).
 
✓ Comments that make personal attacks on the blogger or other readers. 
For example, many bloggers draw the line at comments that contain 
racial slurs, name-calling, hate language, or speculation about things 
such as sexual orientation. People who leave these types of comments 
are often called trolls.
 
✓ Comments left anonymously or by using a fake name and e-mail address.
 
✓ Comments that feature a URL apparently included for marketing 
purposes.
 
✓ Comments that are libelous.
 
✓ Comments that are obscene.
 
✓ Comments that contain private information (which you don’t want to 
make public).
 
✓ Comments that contain plagiarized material.
 
In blogging terms, a troll is an individual who posts irrelevant and often inflam-
matory things in blog comments. Trolls try to get an emotional response out 
of people and can be quite disruptive. Most blogs won’t see any troll activity, 
but if you become popular, they will make an appearance from time to time.
 
Deleting comments is quite a personal decision, one that any good blogger 
runs into — after all, you want to get people talking, so you need to have opin-
ions that can start dialogue. A milquetoast approach doesn’t make an interest-
ing blog, even if it does prevent offensive comments.
Most blog readers can accept that you get to make the decisions about which 
comments stay and which get the heave-ho on your own blog. Nobody likes to 
have their comments deleted, however, and readers often criticize bloggers 

173
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
when those bloggers delete comments, especially when the readers don’t know 
why the bloggers deleted those comments. If you find yourself being ques-
tioned about deleted comments, you can always write a blog post about how 
you deal with comments and remind your readers about your blog’s comment 
policy, or refer them to your comment policy if you have one.
Moderating comments
The single best solution for keeping spam off your blog is to read each and 
every comment left on your blog individually, removing the comments that 
are spam or inappropriate. Sifting through your blog’s comments is called 
moderating. Moderating your blog comments can add overhead to your blog-
ging time, but if you’re dedicated to making your blog successful and useful 
to your readers, it’s time well spent.
You have several options for how you manage the time that you spend look-
ing through comment lists, but the method you choose as your primary line 
of defense depends on how your community grows.
You, your community, your software, or a combination of all three can mod-
erate your blog. Table 9-1 covers the pros and cons of three approaches that 
you can try. Some bloggers have strong preferences at the outset, but you 
can experiment with the best setup for your blog and readers.

through a lot of spam 
yourself.
You need to keep the 
software up to date 
because spammers 
always work out new 
ways to cheat the 
system, so budget time 
for behind-the-scenes 
technical work; ineffec-
tive against personal 
attacks or flames.
You can most easily maintain your sanity by using a combination of the meth-
ods in Table 9-1 to control spam. If your site becomes a popular location for 
online discussion, experiment with these methods to find one that suits you 
and your readers, while letting you keep enough time in your schedule for 
actually writing new blog posts!
 
Some blogs have communities that build quickly, whereas others take more 
time. You might need to change your spam prevention methods from time 
to time in order to take advantage of the community desire to help.
Recognizing Spam Comments
Spam! It’s everywhere, lurking in your e-mail inbox, waiting to pounce on an 
unsuspecting click. It also hangs out on your blog, hiding in the comments — 
you might never escape it! Fortunately, you can slow the stream of spam mes-
sages, and even block most of them from appearing on your blog.
I don’t recommend disabling comments just to keep out the spam. Blog com-
ments are crucial for the life and health of your blog; if you want to make 
your blog more than just another Web site by having real conversations with 
your readers, you simply can’t forego comments. You just have to take the 
good with the bad. And I won’t lie about the bad: Fighting spam can consume 
valuable time and energy. If you’re serious about blogging, you have to do it, 
no matter how unrewarding it feels. It’s like taking out the trash: no fun, but if 
you don’t do it, your house fills with garbage.
Any unwanted message that someone posts in the comment area of your 
blog is spam, especially those messages that include links to fabulous drug 
cocktails, unbelievable mortgage opportunities, and solutions to certain . . . 
ahem . . . anatomical size problems (which, naturally, you don’t have).

 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
The first time you see a spam comment on your blog, you might not recog-
nize it. Long ago, you could easily pick out the spam posts on blogs: They 
consisted of incomprehensible text, inappropriate images, and links to por-
nographic Web sites. But, while the blogs evolved, so did the spammers, and 
today’s spam comments might look like anything from a sincere compliment 
to a request for more information. Figure 9-4 shows a spam comment that 
was left on one of my blogs.
 
You — your brain and eyes — protect your blog from the outside world. If 
something looks suspicious to you, check it out so that you can protect 
yourself, your readers, and your search-engine ranking.
Because you’re the first line of defense, you need to get a feel for the com-
ments that are legitimately posted on your site. Take some time to see what 
your community is like. If your blog community needs time to grow, venture 
out onto other blogs and see what people are saying:
 
✓ Look at real comments and see how they’re written.
 
✓ Get involved and add your own commentary to other blogs. The more 
experience you have at posting comments, the better you can identify 
the spam on your site.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
When you take the time to read real comments, you can more easily spot 
the spam.
Spam has certain styles. Spammers attempt to weasel into your site by looking 
like they have personal or generally harmless content. Sometimes, you can’t 
tell a legitimate comment that has poor grammar and spelling from a spam 
comment that has similar attributes. Spammers count on this confusion. You 
may find sorting the wheat from the chaff a tricky bit of business, but by follow-
ing a few tips, you can get through the spam onslaught with as little frustration 
as possible. Examine the following types of comments with skepticism:
 
✓ Personalized and customized messages: A real human being creates 
this type of spam, as opposed to an automated bit of programming. 
Usually a human being, paid by a spam company, visits your blog, reads 
a few posts and a few comments, and then customizes messages that fit 
in with the tone and style of the site. Often, the spammers even direct 
these messages to you by name. You can easily miss these messages 
when you’re watching for spam comments.
 
 If the link that’s included with a comment isn’t related to the subject 
of the comment or the topics on your blog, the comment is probably a 
fake, no matter how on-topic it might seem.
 
✓ Generic commentary or questions: The generic message spam either 
requests that you do something or makes a very nonspecific remark. 
You often see comments such as, You’ve got the same name as I 
do, Have you seen the new video?, Check out my blog?, Need 
you to do something for me, or Your blog is broken you 
need to see this.
 
✓ Flattery: Finally, spammers use flattery. Spammers may send comments 
such as Your blog is awesome or I like your blog, click to 
read mine. As a general rule, regard these kinds of brief praise with 
suspicion (well, unless your blog really is awesome, of course!). Real 
fans usually elaborate more about what they like about your writing.
 
In general, a spam comment includes a link, usually to an advertising Web site 
or a site designed to look like a blog. The spammers hope that you or your 
blog visitors click the link, giving those spammers a traffic boost and poten-
tially allowing them to collect a fee based on the number of times users visit 
the site or click a link. Look closely at comments that include links.
Many comment spammers are annoyingly ingenious about finding ways to 
disguise their messages. (Some aren’t — you can easily recognize as spam 
the comments about Viagra or the ones that contain gibberish.) But the 
generic nature of comments gives them away. Keep your wits about you so 
that you can identify new trends and formats in comment spam techniques 
when they appear. The techniques described in this chapter can help you 

177
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
prevent or remove spam, but the human brain is endlessly inventive, which 
keeps the spammers a step ahead of any software solution to the problem.
 
Don’t just leave comment spam on your blog and let your readers sort 
through the mess. Spam attracts spam: If you don’t remove these kinds of 
comments, you actually end up with more spam on your site. And, when your 
readers click the spam links, spammers realize that you’re not tending your 
blog, so they flock to it. Delete your spam. Your readers will thank you.
Unfortunately, spam isn’t the only unwanted comment material you might 
deal with. Some of your legitimate commenters may use language that you 
don’t want on your blog or post personal, offensive flames (or attacks) aimed 
at you or other readers. You’re just as entitled to remove this kind of com-
ment as you are to remove spam. In most cases, you can use the techniques 
described in the following section to handle flames and spam comments alike.
Understanding why spam exists
Junk snail mail, e-mail spam, and blog spam all 
exist for the same reason: because someone, 
somewhere, makes money on them. You may 
find this fact hard to believe if you just look at 
spam comments — a lot of them don’t really 
make much sense, much less look like some-
thing you might click.
But spam comments aren’t necessarily 
designed to make you or your readers click 
them. Blog spammers usually just want to raise 
the search engine profile of a site that they 
link to in their comments. Search engines use 
secret formulas to determine the result listings 
that you see when you do a search. The formula 
works to determine and display the most rele-
vant results — the ones that best match your 
search terms — at the top of the list. One of the 
ingredients in this secret formula is the number 
of Web sites that link to a site, and another 
ingredient is the words used for that link.
So, when you write a blog post about a com-
pany that has a product you love and link to 
the company, you’re really doing it two favors: 
You’ve praised it publicly, and you’ve given 
it a little boost in the search engine rankings, 
which helps it come up a little higher the next 
time someone searches for the product you 
reviewed. Aren’t you nice? Now imagine that 
ten more customers do the same thing on their 
blogs. The company gets a lot of search engine 
love for all those different links.
Spammers are trying to scam this process by 
creating dozens, even hundreds, of links from 
many different Web pages to the Web site 
that they’re attempting to boost in the search 
engine rankings. When a site appears high in 
the search engine rankings, you know what 
happens: More people visit it more often.
Ultimately, comment spam might simply want to 
get people to visit a particular Web site, but it 
takes a fairly indirect path to that result. After 
someone opens the Web site, the unfortunate 
visitor might get a chance to buy a product, 
click a link, provide information that he or she 
shouldn’t about bank accounts, or view a page 
that has ads on it. And that’s where the spam-
mers make profit.

178
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
 
Don’t avoid blogging just because of the amount of spam you’re bound to get. 
After all, junk messages aren’t anything new. You see spam in your e-mail all 
the time; heck, you even see it in your snail mail box, and you probably aren’t 
about to stop getting mail delivered, right?
Fighting Spam with Software
Spam is a pain. But consider how much spam you really have to deal with: 
Do you get three spam messages every few weeks, or are you getting 500 
an hour? If you’re receiving only a few every month, you might not need to 
install any software because you can moderate the few problem comments 
yourself pretty easily. If your blog get dozens of comments every day, how-
ever, spam fighting can take up a lot of your time. The following sections 
explore some of the many blog software solutions available to make this task 
a little faster and easier.
Protecting your comment form
The tools described in the following sections are designed to give spammers 
trouble filling out the comment form on your blog. These tools try to prevent 
the spam from ever reaching your blog so that you don’t need to deal with 
reading and deleting it.
 
These tools do that job fairly well, but they also present something of a barrier 
to people who want to leave a legitimate comment; remember, you want to cut 
down on spam, not real comments! Keep your audience’s needs and abilities 
in mind when you implement any spam-fighting tools.
CAPTCHAs
A CAPTCHA (an acronym for something really long and boring) is a challenge-
response test, meaning it’s a question that your reader must answer cor-
rectly in order to post a comment. On a blog, CAPTCHAs are most commonly 
implemented in such a way that humans can complete them but comput-
ers can’t. A CAPTCHA on the World Hum travel site (www.worldhum.com) 
requires the would-be commenter to duplicate the letters and numbers 
shown in an image in order to submit a comment, as shown in Figure 9-5.
CAPTCHAs were created to stop spammers from adding comments to blogs 
by using automated scripts that try to fill out any Web form that they find, 
especially blog comment forms. But spammers are inventive: Some blog com-
ment scripts can now recognize letters and numbers in an image, so many 
sites that use CAPTCHAs distort the text by stretching it, or layering it with 
graphic random graphic elements.

179
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
 
Figure 9-5: 
On World 
Hum, the 
visual 
CAPTCHA is 
designed to 
let humans 
leave com-
ments and 
block spam 
scripts.
 
Other sites use CAPTCHA questions that are simple for humans to answer, 
such as trivia or mathematical questions. For example, “What color is a red 
balloon?” These kinds of CAPTCHAs are new and have yet to prove their 
effectiveness, but you might want to check into them and see for yourself 
how they work.
Your blog software may have CAPTCHA technology built in, or you might be 
able to add one by using a plug-in. Check your blog software’s documentation 
and support tools for suggestions on installing and configuring a CAPTCHA 
system.
User registration
Registration is a popular option with larger communities, especially online 
forums. The community requests or even requires that users who want to 
leave comments sign up for a user account. These accounts are typically free, 
but to complete the registration process, you must provide a name and valid 
e-mail address, thereby cutting down on the number of spam scripts that can 
create an account and therefore post comments. Sites that require registration 
actually prevent anyone who isn’t registered from leaving a comment; sites 
that simply request registration reward registering by recognizing members or 
by marking a registered user’s comments in some highlighted way.

180
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
This setup lets you keep a record of everything that a particular poster adds 
to the system, easily identifying your most frequent contributors and visitors. 
Also, if a poster gets out of hand, or an automated spam system acquires an 
account and posts by using that username, you can simply close the account 
and stop the poster from posting again by using that account.
Blog software is increasingly offering registration, so be sure to check your 
documentation. If your software doesn’t offer registration, look for a plug-in 
that does.
Screening for spam
Software that filters the incoming comments in various ways can provide a 
defense against spammers by identifying and removing comments that look 
like spam. These filters give a blogger great tools: They run all hours of the 
day and they don’t require any effort on your part. But an automated process 
is never as smart as a human, so you might occasionally lose a valid com-
ment if you use a filtering system.
A third-party software solution called Automattic Akismet (see the sidebar 
“Akismet,” in this chapter) is the clear leader when it comes to spam filtering, 
though many blogging software applications have added their own internal 
tools, as well. Check to see whether your blog software has any of these 
technologies in place for you to use — you can probably find some of them 
available. If you don’t, check http://akismet.com/development to see 
whether you can add Akismet to your blog.
Keyword filtering
Keyword filters can help you identify incoming comment spam. This kind of fil-
tering is probably the oldest type of protection for blog comments and might 
not work all the time because spammers have become much smarter since this 
technology was first used. Spam filtering usually works by comparing incom-
ing comments against lists of words and/or phrases associated with spam. 
Matches indicate spam, and the filter yanks those comments.
Keyword filters are typically updated frequently to keep up with the ploys 
that spammers use. Some of these lists contain Web addresses and other 
computer identification information, as well as keywords. Users also can 
submit and maintain their own lists in case custom spelling or other methods 
of tricking the anti-spam system come into use (for example, using V1agra, 
rather than Viagra).
Several services over the years have allowed different blog tools and 
platforms to take advantage of a central keyword listing. These lists are 

181
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
maintained and updated by a third-party company. Today’s most popular 
anti-spam system, Akismet (see the sidebar “Akismet,” in this chapter), falls 
into this category.
 
One problem with this kind of filter system is that some spammers leave nice 
messages that include bad links. These messages get past the filter because 
they aren’t offensive and don’t violate any rule that you have.
Blacklists and whitelists
A blog blacklist is a method of keeping spam off your Web site by prevent-
ing certain known spam systems from accessing your comment system or 
your Web site as a whole. By specifically identifying spammers from certain 
addresses, countries, or computers, or by using certain URLs, you can block 
those individual spammers, keeping your blog much safer.
Most blogging software comes with a blacklist system built in or a system 
that you can easily add by using a plug-in or third-party solution. Consult 
your blog software documentation to be sure that you understand how to 
keep your blacklist up to date and how you can contribute to the blacklist.
Whitelists perform the opposite action of a blacklist by specifically permit-
ting certain visitors or types of visitors. A whitelist is a preselected list of 
visitors whom you know won’t post spam on your blog. Bloggers use a 
whitelist in conjunction with a blacklist. Whitelists can allow you to accept 
comments from visitors who have been misidentified as spammers in the 
past. Essentially, you’re making your blog accessible to certain people or 
computer networks. If you want to guarantee that your mother, for instance, 
can always post to your blog — or even if you want to set it up so that she 
doesn’t have to comply with a CAPTCHA or other anti-spam techniques — 
add her to the whitelist so that she can post with impunity. Whitelists are 
uncommon, so if your blogging software doesn’t offer this functionality, you 
probably can’t find a good third-party solution.
IP banning
Similar to blacklists, IP banning prevents certain IP addresses or a range of 
IP networks from accessing your Web site. IP banning is probably the oldest 
method of protecting blogs.
 
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a series of numbers that identifies a net-
work, a computer, or any networked electronic device within a computer 
network. Devices such as printers, fax machines, desktop and laptop 
computers, and some telephones can have their own IP addresses.

182
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Many blog software solutions offer lists of banned IP addresses that they col-
lect from other users of the same software who have identified spammers, 
and you can automatically update your own list to prevent those spammers 
from posting to your site.
A potential problem with banning networks or certain IP addresses is that 
the offending poster may connect via a different IP address the next time 
that he or she posts something. Banning by IP address can work for known 
spam companies, but it’s highly fallible because so many computers regu-
larly obtain new IP addresses through their Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
IP banning can also affect people whom you don’t actually want to block. For 
instance, if you block a computer on a particular network, others who use the 
same network but are blameless might end up using the offending IP address 
at some point and be blocked. Many bloggers discount IP banning, saying 
that it has no real usefulness in today’s mobile world.
Dealing with Coverage on Other Blogs
You can’t do much about negative blog posts or comments about you on 
other blogs, although many a blogger has stayed awake all night worrying. (It 
doesn’t seem to help.) You can easily post a comment that responds, but you 
may not want to respond when you’re feeling angry and emotional because 
you may post something you would regret.
 
You’re taking part in a public conversation, and free speech means that 
people can openly express their opinions about you, your blog, your opinions, 
your business — you name it. You can find negative criticism hard to take, 
especially when you feel it’s unjustified. Before you send off an angry e-mail 
or post a vicious comment, sit back and take a little time to consider your 
options. If you can be objective, try to understand exactly what the other 
person is criticizing and whether the critic has a point.
Here are a few ways that you can handle a case in which another blogger 
posts a negative statement about you or your blog:
 
✓ Point to the negative coverage on your own blog and get some other 
opinions on the issue without taking a position yourself.
 
✓ Ignore the post and comment about it only when someone specifically 
requests your opinion.
 
✓ Post respectful comments on the blog in question and constructively 
add to the conversation there.
 
✓ Counter the criticism, in a respectful manner, on your own blog.

183
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
Whichever path you choose, make sure that you deal with the comment in a 
respectful manner. You can very easily escalate a conflict online because you 
don’t have to deal with people face to face. The anonymous feeling people 
get when they’re on the Internet can lead them to behave in ways that they 
wouldn’t in person. Try to take the high road as much as possible, if only 
because an uninvolved reader is more likely to see you as right if you handle 
things in a better way than your critic.
In some cases, criticism of an individual or business on a blog has led to legal 
ramifications, from copyright violation to libel. If you feel that the negative 
comments about you online might fall into the legal realm, consult with a 
lawyer about the best course of action.
 
You might not be the only target of criticism — some bloggers use their blogs 
as a way to publish attacks on everyone, from public figures to private indi-
viduals. Some other bloggers might even attack your readers and ignore you. 
Deal with these kinds of situations quickly and with as much care as you can 
provide. Think of yourself as the referee in a situation that involves personal 
attacks from one member of your audience to another, and look for ways to 
defuse the situation and prevent future occurrences.
Akismet
One anti-spam service is worth a special men-
tion: Automattic Akismet (www.akismet.
com). The Akismet service has been around 
since the latter half of 2005, and it’s one of the 
best spam-filtering systems in the world. Plus, 
it’s very easy to use. While you moderate your 
comments, a simple series of links and buttons 
helps you make quick choices about good and 
bad comments.
Akismet works by running your comments 
through a central data center. The Akismet 
system runs a number of tests each time a user 
submits a comment, and if the comment passes 
all the tests, Akismet automatically posts the 
comment to your site. It holds comments that 
fail the tests in a queue for your review so that 
you can identify any valid comments and post 
them. (Or you can just delete them all without 
going through them.)
The software updates itself and maintains the 
blacklist that it uses, so after you install it on 
your blog, you don’t have to do anything to keep 
it up and running. Akismet is free for personal 
use but requires a monthly fee for commercial 
use. Also, some deals are available for non-
profit organizations.

f you’ve mastered the basics, you can have some fun! 
In this part, you can try some of the truly cutting-edge 
tricks being used by successful bloggers. They say a pic-
ture is worth a thousand words, so photo blogs are going 
to repay your efforts in a big way. In Chapter 10, you find 
out how to make the most of photos and other graphics in 
your blog. Or, say it by simply speaking, as I describe in 
Chapter 11’s tour of the world of podcasting. I know you, 
though. You’re not satisfied with words and pictures — 
unless they are moving! Chapter 12 tackles the challenging 
world of video blogging, from hardware to software, and 
everything in between.

In This Chapter

▶ Making or collecting images to use on your blog
▶ Using Picasa to edit your photos
▶ Putting Flickr photos into your blog posts
I
t’s a fact: People love photos! You can increase your readership and decrease 
your writing time by including photos in your blog posts or putting photo 
badges (code you can place on your blog that shows off your photos) into your 
sidebar. Many bloggers have discovered that including a photo in a blog post, 
even if the photo is only tangentially related to the post, ensures that more 
people read the post than read entries without photos.
If you already have a digital camera and photo-editing software, you have the 
tools at hand to start putting photos into your blog quickly. But if you’re new 
to photography, this chapter also includes information about choosing a 
digital camera or software.
Putting graphics on the Web isn’t incredibly hard to do, and today’s wonderful 
photo-sharing Web sites make posting photos online both quick and easy. In 
fact, if you already have a Flickr account that you use to share your digital 
photos, you can jump right to the section “Inserting Photos into Blog Posts 
with Flickr,” later in this chapter — you’ll be pleased as punch to find out 
how easily you can do it.
Getting Equipped
Today, digital cameras are quite inexpensive, and using one can expedite the 
process of putting your photos online. Most digital cameras can take photo-
graphs in file formats that you can use on the Web with no further processing, 
but you can also pick up software that helps you convert your photos to the 

188
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
right format quite quickly. Some cameras shoot photos in particular formats, 
some of which are not Web-compatible, so you have to convert them into 
Web-friendly formats like JPG and GIF. (I cover the more nitty gritty details 
of Web-compatible file formats and photo editing in the section “Editing 
Photos,” later in this chapter; if you’re in the market for a camera, make sure 
that you know in what format or formats the camera captures pictures.)
The ingredients to getting photos onto your Web site are
 
✓ A camera, preferably a digital camera
 
✓ A way to get your photos from your camera onto your computer, such 
as a USB cable or scanner
 
✓ Image-editing software that can help you crop, resize, and touch up your 
photos
 
✓ A photo-sharing service or blog software that has file-upload tools
The following sections cover these items in detail.
Picking a digital camera
Digital cameras come in all kinds of price ranges and with tons of different 
features. When you take a photograph, the image is saved on a storage card 
or small hard drive, and many cameras have a nice preview screen that lets 
you see the results of your photography right away.
When you need your photos, you can remove the storage card from your 
camera, and then insert it into the card reader hooked to your computer, or 
even into a printer. You may want to have a removable storage card if you 
plan to take a lot of pictures because you can easily carry several cards with 
you, switching them out when you fill one. Some cameras can also connect 
directly to your computer.
 
Digital cameras usually come with several quality settings that determine the 
resolution of your image and the sizes that look good when you print your 
photograph. If you choose higher-quality settings, you can fit fewer images on 
your storage card, but the resulting files look better, print more sharply, and 
can be resized more easily than lower-quality images.
Today, even relatively inexpensive digital cameras can take high-quality 
images suitable for use in almost any medium, so the real challenge is to pick 
a camera that suits your picture-taking style.

189
 Chapter 10: Working with Photos
Be realistic about how you plan to use the camera and how comfortable you 
are with it when you look at the options:
 
✓ Digital SLRs: If you’re a professional photographer or a dedicated ama-
teur, you likely want a high-end dSLR camera. But these cameras are 
quite large, which makes them awkward to carry and use unobtrusively 
on a day-to-day basis.
 
✓ Low-end point-and-shoots: If you’re a photography amateur, super light-
weight cameras can get a lot of admiring glances. But they might lack 
important features, and their tiny size might also make them hard to use 
and hold steady.
 
✓ Mid-range: If you’re not a professional photographer but want more than 
just the basics that low-end cameras provide, look for a camera in the 
midprice range. These cameras come in a range of styles and sizes, and 
with a wide range of features designed for use by completely inexperienced 
to professional photographers.
 
✓ Mobile cameras (phone cameras): These days, most phones come with 
cameras built-in — convenient, but picture quality from camera phones 
can be quite low.
Start your search by visiting CNET (www.cnet.com) and looking at the 
product reviews written by CNET editors and readers. Reading through the 
reviews can really help you understand the options and features, and it can 
give you a feel for the price ranges that include the feature package you want.
With some CNET recommendations in mind, head for a camera or good elec-
tronics store to test-drive some cameras. You need to feel physically com-
fortable handling and using any camera that you purchase, regardless of how 
well it was reviewed online.
Another Web site I thought I should mention is DPReview (www.dpreview.
com), which highlights a collection of digital cameras with lots of detail about 
different brands and models. This site shows example photos from most of 
the cameras along with reviews from readers.
 
If you’re more comfortable using a film camera, rather than a digital one, 
you’re in luck! You can still use film photos by scanning the photos to create a 
digital file. Or ask your film processing shop to provide you with a CD of your 
photographs along with prints.
Choosing photo-editing software
You need to find a program to help you edit and organize your photos. You 
have loads of options, at all pricing levels. In fact, your computer might have 

190
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
come packaged with image-editing software, or the digital camera that you 
purchase might include software.
When you’re looking for image-editing software with the ultimate goal of 
getting your images online, consider these criteria:
 
✓ File formats: You need to be able to create images in the right format for 
display on the Web. These formats are JPG, GIF, and PNG. These formats 
also allow you compress the file size of your images for the Web.
 
✓ Standard editing tools: At a minimum, you need image-editing software 
that allows you to resize, crop, rotate, and adjust brightness and con-
trast in your photos. These tools should be quick and easy to use.
 
✓ Organizing tools: Look for software that helps you keep track of your 
images by using thumbnail previews, naming schemes, and search, 
especially if you take a lot of photos.
 
✓ Photo sharing: You don’t need a program that integrates with the blog-
ging tool that you use or with a photo-sharing service such as Flickr, but 
it can speed up the time it takes to post a photo online. I discuss inserting 
photos with Flickr in the section “Inserting Photos into Blog Posts with 
Flickr,” later in this chapter.
 
With these ideas in mind, don’t forget to think about whether you want an 
image editor that can do more than just get photos into shape for online pub-
lication. If you plan to print photographs, be sure you look for photo-editing 
software that has good tools for printing.
I cover two software programs (Picasa and iPhoto) in the following sections. 
Other image-editing programs also work well for touching up and formatting 
photographs:
 
✓ Adobe Photoshop Elements: Around $100; version 8 supports Windows 
and Mac (previous versions support only Windows); www.adobe.com/
products/photoshopelwin. This program is suitable for users who 
have the patience to figure out how to use a full-featured program but 
don’t need professional features, such as the ability to produce color 
separations for high-end professional printers. Photoshop Elements is a 
great compromise between basic and high-end software.
 
✓ Adobe Photoshop Lightroom: $299; Mac and Windows; www.adobe.
com/products/photoshoplightroom. This software is intended 
specifically for photography, and serious amateur photographers and 
professionals find this program valuable for managing large collections 
of photographs.
 
✓ Adobe Photoshop: $699; Mac and Windows; www.adobe.com/products/
photoshop. For anyone who isn’t a designer or very serious photographer, 
Adobe Photoshop can be overkill. But this program can really make your 

191
 Chapter 10: Working with Photos
photos look great if you are willing to pay the premium price. Advanced 
editing tools and more control over the quality of the images you are uti-
lizing for your blog puts this package heads and shoulders above Adobe 
Elements’ more basic toolset.
 
✓ Adobe Fireworks: $299; Mac and Windows; www.adobe.com/products/
fireworks. Although you can use Fireworks to process photos, it’s 
really intended to be a Web graphics production tool. If you have it 
already, go ahead and use it, but if you’re looking over your options, I 
recommend some of the other products on this list for photo editing.
Picasa
http://picasa.google.com
Picasa, from Google, is priced competitively (it’s free) and works especially 
well for photographers who want to put photos online. It has highly devel-
oped organizational tools, allowing you to do everything from automatically 
importing and naming photos from your camera when you hook it up to your 
computer, to quickly labeling and tagging your photos, to rating good photos, 
to creating photo albums.
Picasa has good editing tools, but they sacrifice some fine control in favor 
of being easy to use. You can crop, straighten horizons, fix red-eye issues, 
adjust color and contrast, and make other edits to your photos easily.
However, the photo-sharing tools really set Picasa apart. You can use tools 
to e-mail photos, get them onto the Web, create online slideshows, and put 
photo collections onto other devices. You can also print photos quite easily.
Picasa (shown in Figure 10-1) is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
In the section “Editing Photos,” later in this chapter, I walk you through using 
simple editing tools in Picasa.
iPhoto
www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto
If you’re a Mac user, you have a great image-editing program in Apple’s iPhoto 
(see Figure 10-2). It gives you all the basic tools for cropping, straightening, 
adjusting color and brightness, and resizing. Plus, you can dabble with fun 
effects, and increase or decrease highlights and shadows in your photos.
iPhoto also comes with excellent organizing tools: You can categorize, tag, 
caption, and title your photos quickly and easily, and the simple search inter-
face helps you find old photos.

 Chapter 10: Working with Photos
If you don’t want to publish photos only to your own blog, use iPhoto to pub-
lish to the MobileMe Web service, put up slideshows and albums, and share 
your photos with groups of friends and family.
You can also use iPhoto to print a real photo album, calendar, cards, and 
individual prints. iPhoto frequently comes packaged on new Macintosh com-
puters, but if you don’t have it, head to the Apple Store (http://store.
apple.com) and buy a copy of iLife, which includes iPhoto and other digital 
applications.
Choosing a photo-sharing tool
When you’re ready to put your photos online, regardless of whether you 
ultimately want to include images on your blog, you have plenty of options. 
Photo-sharing Web sites have become full-fledged members of the Web 2.0 
movement, offering friend lists, tagging, and other sophisticated tools.
The media darling of photo-sharing sites is definitely Flickr (www.flickr.
com). For avid photographers, Flickr has nearly replaced the need to have 
a blog at all because many of the best blogging tools are integrated into the 
Flickr service.
On Flickr, you can
 
✓ Create a list of friends whose photos you want to follow.
 
✓ Upload and organize photos by using tags (keywords), sets, and collections.
 
✓ Start groups around a visual theme and add your photos to other 
groups.
 
✓ Set privacy controls to dictate who can see your photos.
 
✓ Use your photos to create books, prints, calendars, business cards, 
DVDs, and stamps.
 
✓ Post photos in your account and receive comments (see Figure 10-3).
 
✓ Create slideshows of your photos.
 
✓ Browse other members’ photos and leave comments.
Basic Flickr accounts are free for 100MB worth of photos each month — you 
can display only your most recent 200 photos, though. Pro accounts cost $24.95 
a year and receive unlimited uploading and image display.
In the section “Inserting Photos into Blog Posts with Flickr,” later in this 
chapter, I show you how to put Flickr to work for you when you want to add 
images to blog posts.

Flickr isn’t alone in offering photo sharing online; it just happens to be my 
favorite. You can also upload your photos to Photobucket (www.photo
bucket.com), Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com), SmugMug (www.smugmug.
com), Snapfish (www.snapfish.com), and Webshots (www.webshots.com), 
among others.
 
Whatever service you choose, look for tools that can make your life easier when 
it comes to putting your photos on your blog. For example, look for services that
 
✓ Allow you to create a photo badge (a bit of code that displays your 
photos) to put in your blog’s sidebar. I talk more about using Flickr for 
this purpose in Chapter 20.
 
✓ Let you post a photo to your blog or give you code to put the photo in 
your blog post.
Choosing Visuals for Your Blog
Far be it from me to tell you how to take photographs — I’m a rank amateur 
when it comes to photography. But I can give you tips on taking photos that 
you can use for a new blog post, which I do in the following sections.

195
 Chapter 10: Working with Photos
Taking photos
Readers respond well to photos: Visitors are more likely to read posts that 
have photos than those that don’t. And, most of the time, your photos and 
images don’t have to have a strong relationship to what you’re blogging 
about. In fact, they can go off on a tangential topic or idea.
You can’t always throw unrelated images onto your blog, though. After all, 
if you’re blogging about your new mobile phone, go with a picture of that 
phone. And if you’re talking about your recent trip to Peru — well, you need 
some pictures from your trip. But if you’re just pontificating or talking about 
a favorite book, think about adding a photograph as more of an accessory.
Bloggers often add pictures to posts that just need a little zing, as Degan Beley 
does in her blog (www.ethniceats.ca) in the post shown in Figure 10-4. 
When she writes food and restaurant reviews, Degan always tries to include a 
photo of where she’s been and what she’s eaten as an illustration for her text 
descriptions.
 
Figure 10-4: 
Photos 
are an 
invaluable 
addition to a 
food blog.
 
If you want to take photographs to put on your blog, keep your eyes open all 
the time for visuals that inspire or interest you. You don’t have to be a rocket 

196
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
scientist to find good picture subjects, but you do need to be thinking about 
your blog and your camera more often than you might normally. In fact, some 
bloggers find that carrying a camera with them actually helps them find 
things to blog about and illustrate regular blog posts.
 
Here are a few tips for taking photos for your blog:
 
✓ Carry your camera with you when you leave the house, even if you’re 
just running down to the grocery store.
 
✓ Keep fresh batteries in your camera so that when you need to use it, 
it isn’t dead. If possible, keep a second set of batteries in your camera 
pouch. (By the way, digital cameras quickly suck up battery juice, so 
you really should buy rechargeable batteries, reducing the impact on 
both your pocketbook and the environment.)
 
✓ Don’t worry too much about taking the perfect picture. Just take the 
picture!
 
✓ Take photos of the people you meet and talk to, and your friends. Be 
sure to ask them whether you can use their photo on your blog. Then, 
when you blog about going to a movie with Sam, you have a photo of 
Sam to include.
Using art from other sources
One nice thing about the Web: You can find tons and tons of photos, images, 
graphics, and visuals out there to inspire you. Some bloggers have taken 
advantage of this vast offering by including some of those great visuals in 
their blog posts. Photos attract readers’ attention better than a few para-
graphs of text. You may decide to use photos on your blog, as long as you 
have the rights to republish those images. 
Here are some tips when you need images other than your own:
 
✓ Checking the public domain: Some materials are designated public domain 
works, which means anyone can use them for any purpose, although you 
must still give the author credit. If you’re interested in featuring public-
domain and licensed images on your blog, do a search for public domain 
photos on your favorite search engine. You can investigate a number of 
good resources.
 
 In the United States, anything published before 1923 is considered public 
domain, but other countries don’t necessarily have the same policy.
 
✓ Searching through Creative Commons: By using the Creative Commons 
licensing tool, you can look for works that authors have licensed for 
republication. To find additional works that you can use, visit http://
search.creativecommons.org and search by using keywords that 

197
 Chapter 10: Working with Photos
describe the material you’re looking for. (Creative Commons licenses 
allow the author of a blog to make known their copyright wishes for the 
copying of their blog content.)
 
✓ Asking for permission: If you see something that you like and want to 
use, but it’s protected by full copyright, consider just asking whether 
you can use it. Many photographers, especially those who don’t make a 
living selling their work, are willing to let you use their work, especially 
if you give them credit!
 
Many of the photos on the Flickr photo-sharing site (www.flickr.com) have 
been licensed for use on other Web sites and blogs. When you’re looking at a 
photo on Flickr, check the copyright information on the right side of the page.
Editing Photos
As long as you have the rights to do so, you can edit any photo. In general, 
you can do what you like to photos that you acquire from a public domain 
Web site or a picture that you take yourself. Photos that you obtain permis-
sion to use, or use under a special license, may have restrictions when it 
comes to making edits, so be sure you understand what you’re allowed to do. 
In the following sections, I show you how to do some of the most common 
photo-editing tasks by using Picasa.
Most of the edits that you want to make most frequently include resizing, 
cropping, adjusting lighting and contrast, and adjusting the color of a photo. 
For each of the following tasks, you should have Picasa running and have a 
photo available to edit.
 
When you edit a photo in Picasa, it doesn’t save any changes until you choose 
File➪Save. At the same time that it saves the changes, Picasa creates a copy of 
the original image, so if you ever need to start fresh, you can.
Getting photos into Picasa
Before you can edit a photo, you need to get it into Picasa. Follow these steps:
 
1. With Picasa installed on your computer, connect your camera to your 
computer.
 
 You can also put your camera’s storage card into a card reader or printer, 
if that’s how you usually move photos from your camera to your 
computer.
 
 Windows displays a pop-up window, asking what program you want to use.

198
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
 
2. Select Picasa from the available programs and click OK.
 
 Photos begin to load in Picasa’s Import Tray.
 
3. Click Import All to bring the photos into Picasa.
 
 The Finish Importing pop-up window opens.
 
4. Create or select a folder for the photos.
 
 You can use the Browse button to set a location where you want to save 
the photos. The default location is the My Pictures folder.
 
 You can also add where and when you took the photos, as well as give 
them a description, but this information is optional.
 
5. Click Finish.
 
 Picasa finishes importing the photos and returns you to the photo 
Library.
Cropping a photo
Cropping a photo allows you to remove unneeded or unattractive parts of an 
image. For example, if you take a picture of a group of friends and then want 
to include a photo of just one of the individuals in your blog post, you can 
crop out the other people in the image.
To crop a photo that you’ve imported into Picasa, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Picasa and, in the Picasa Library, double-click the photo that 
you want to edit.
 
 The Editing screen opens.
 
2. Click the Crop button at the top of the Basic Fixes tab.
 
3. Select whether you want to crop to a preset size or crop manually.
 
 If you’re cropping to a preset size, simply select the size that you want 
to use from the menu.
 
4. Use your mouse to click and drag over the area that you want to retain 
in your photo, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
 While you click and drag, the area that will be cropped out of your photo 
appears slightly grayed out, leaving the portion that will be retained at 
the original brightness.
 
 If you want to start over, click Reset to remove the cropping box that 
you created. If you don’t want to crop after all, click the Cancel button to 
exit the Crop tool.

Figure 10-5:

manually 
lets you 
choose a 
specific 
area that 
you want to 
keep in your 
photo.
 
 
5. Click the Preview button and check out how the cropped photo
will look.
 
6. Click the Apply button to crop your photo.
 
 Picasa displays the cropped photo.
Adjusting brightness and contrast
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, photos end up looking too dark or too 
light. By using photo-editing software such Picasa, you get a second chance 
because you can make adjustments to brightness and contrast.
To adjust the brightness and contrast, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Picasa and, in the Library, double-click the photo that you want 
to edit.
 
 The Editing screen opens.
 
2. Click the Tuning tab on the left side of the application.

200
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
 
3. On the Tuning tab, click and drag the slider bar below Highlights to 
adjust the brightness of the image.
 
 Picasa adjusts the image being displayed while you move the bar.
 
 If you’re lightening the photo, watch the brightest parts of your photo to 
make sure that they don’t get too bright, losing information you want in 
the photo. If you’re bringing down lightness, watch the darker areas of 
your photo so that you don’t end up with too much black in your photo. 
Let your eyes be the judge of a well-adjusted image.
 
You can have Picasa make an educated guess about the brightness settings 
that you need by clicking the Auto Contrast button in the Basic Fixes tab.
Click the Undo Auto Contrast button if you don’t like the results.
Adjusting color
Color in photos frequently needs a little adjusting. I’ve taken too many green-
ish photos in fluorescent lights! With a little help from photo-editing software 
such Picasa, I can turn my friends’ skin back to their normal colors.
To adjust the color of a photo, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Picasa and, in the Library, double-click the photo that you want 
to edit.
 
 The Editing screen opens.
 
2. Click the Tuning tab on the left side of the application.
 
3. On the Tuning tab, click and drag the slider bar below Color 
Temperature to adjust the color tone of the picture.
 
 Color can be tricky to adjust. As a good rule, look for an element in the 
photograph that you know should be a particular color, and then adjust 
the overall color to make that element look right. Then, look at the overall 
picture and adjust, if necessary. Elements that you can use for the purpose 
include eye color, skin color, sky, and other consistent elements.
 
You can have Picasa make an educated guess about the color settings that you 
need by clicking the Auto Color button in the Basic Fixes tab. Click the Undo 
Auto Color button if you don’t like the results.

 Chapter 10: Working with Photos
Optimizing a photo for the Web
Digital cameras commonly store photos as high-resolution files suitable for 
print, but that high-resolution is more than you need for display on a blog or 
Web site. And you probably don’t want to make your blog visitors download 
a great big image when they don’t need to. Usually, you compress the file size 
of your image when you plan to put it on your blog.
 
If you plan to upload your image to Flickr, don’t worry about compressing the 
image when you export. Flickr can handle large files and can resize the photo 
for you.
You may also need to change the image’s dimensions in order to fit it into 
your blog layout, or even create a thumbnail version.
In Picasa, compressing — also called setting the image quality — and resizing 
a photo actually occur when you export the image, so you don’t need to deal 
with these issues until after you do all your other edits. When you export, 
you’re creating a file that you can upload to your blog, so don’t skip this step!
To resize and export an image, select the photo in Picasa that you want to 
export and follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Export button at the bottom of the Picasa window.
 
 The Export to Folder dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
2. Click the Browse button and select the location on your computer 
where you want to save the file that you’re exporting.
 
3. To resize your image, click the Resize To radio button below Image 
Size Options and enter a pixel width that you want to use for your 
new image in the text box below Resize To.
 
 You may need to experiment to find the right pixel width for your partic-
ular blog design, but a good rule is to choose a pixel width of 400 pixels 
because many blog templates tend to hover around this width.
 
 You can also use the slider bar to the right of the pixel text box to 
change the width.
 
4. Select an Image Quality setting from the Image Quality drop-down list.
 
 For Web graphics, Normal is a good setting to choose because it has a 
good balance between image size and file size.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Picasa exports your image to the folder you chose in Step 2.

Inserting Photos into Blog 
Posts with Flickr
If you have a photo prepared for use on your blog, you’re ready to upload it 
to the Web. You can take two approaches to get your image online:
 
✓ Uploading directly to your blog: If your blog software supports it, you 
might be able to upload your image directly into your blog post. In Blogger, 
for instance, you can use the Image Upload button in the New Post 
interface to upload an image. You can read more about this process in 
Blogger in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Other online sharing sites: If your blog software doesn’t include an image-
uploading tool, you can upload your photos to an online sharing site, such 
as Flickr. You can then add your photo to your post from that site.
Follow these steps to add photos to Flickr:
 
1. Log in to your Flickr account and select Upload Photos & Video on the 
home page.
 
 Alternatively, click the arrow next to the You navigation button and 
select Upload Photos and Videos from the menu that appears.
 
 The Upload to Flickr page appears.

203
 Chapter 10: Working with Photos
 
2. Click the Choose photos and videos link.
 
 A Select File dialog box opens, showing files on your computer.
 
3. Navigate to the location of the photo that you want to upload, select 
the photo, and click Open.
 
 Your photo goes into an upload queue on the Flickr page.
 
 If you want to upload more photos, click the Add More link and add 
those photos to the queue, as well.
 
4. Make sure that your Privacy setting is Public so that readers can view 
your photo when you put it on your blog.
 
5. Click the Upload Photos and Videos button.
 
 Flickr displays a progress bar and notifies you when it has fully 
uploaded your photo.
 
6. Click the Add a Description link.
 
 The images you’ve just uploaded will appear and you can now enter in 
tags, descriptions, and titles.
 
7. Give your photo a title, description, and tags that describe it in the 
text boxes provided.
 
8. Click the Save button.
 
 Flickr adds your new photo(s) to your photo page. After you’ve com-
pleted your upload, you are sent back to your main photostream.
 
9. On your photo page, click the photo that you just uploaded.
 
10. Click the All Sizes icon above the photo, as shown in Figure 10-7.
 
 To post your photos directly from Flickr onto your blog and skip the 
rest of the steps, click the Blog This icon to the left of the All Sizes 
icon. Flickr shows you the starting point for configuring the connection 
between Flickr and your blog. Have the Web address for your blog’s 
publishing interface, your username, and password ready.
Flickr uploading tools
You have four ways to upload your photos to 
Flickr: You can use the method described in 
this chapter, download the Flickr Uploadr tool 
and install it on your computer, use a plug-in 
for iPhoto, or upload via e-mail. If you upload 
via e-mail, don’t forget that you can use your 
mobile phone to e-mail pictures directly onto 
your Flickr photostream.
To find out more about the Flickr uploading 
tools, go to www.flickr.com/tools.

In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out whether you want to create podcasts
▶ Evaluating the equipment and tools needed for podcasting
▶ Finding fun audio files to include in your podcast
▶ Getting your podcast onto the Web and promoting it
B
y adding podcasts — either video or audio files that you publish on the 
Internet for people to download and listen to or view — to your blog, 
you reach a wider audience and reach your audience in different locations: 
People might listen to you while they drive or commute, or they might watch 
your videos on their television or their hand-held iPod.
The production process for a podcast is (in theory) simple: You go out into 
the world, record a video or some audio, edit it on your computer, and then 
upload the files to your blog for release onto the Internet. Your blog’s readers 
then download the files, and they can still leave comments and interact with 
your blog in the usual way.
Intrigued? Podcasts are attracting a whole new audience to the blogosphere. 
With the creation of improved software and portable hardware units that can 
consume these kinds of media, you might want to seriously consider adding 
podcasting to your blog.

Deciding to Podcast
Podcasts come in all flavors. You can find personal podcasts, technical pod-
casts, sports reports, music samples, recorded social gatherings, previously 

206
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
recorded radio broadcasts, book reviews, and audio books. If you can think 
of a topic, you can probably find a podcast for it.
Knit Picks (www.knitpicks.com) is a knitting yarn and supplies company 
that offers a regular podcast about knitting activities, techniques, books, and 
guest interviews in an informative and entertaining mix. The Knit Picks pod-
cast page (http://community.knitpicks.com/profile/knitpicks
podcast) is shown in Figure 11-1.
Blogs and podcasts can look very similar; the main difference is that a podcast 
entry contains a media file that the consumer can download, either by directly 
accessing the Web site or by subscribing to a syndicated blog feed (also known 
as the RSS feed). See the section “Delivering your podcasts,” later in this chap-
ter, for more information about your options.
Many bloggers who want to podcast don’t because of the learning curve to build 
and maintain a podcast. As wonderful as podcasts can be, writing, recording, 
uploading, hosting, and promoting one requires a higher level of technical pro-
ficiency than written blog posts do. However, you may find figuring out how to 
work podcasts worth it if you think they can help grow your audience, enhance 
your blog content, or improve and expand your blogging skills. In the following 
sections, you can take a closer look at the advantages of podcasting and figure 
out how to choose between audio and video podcasts.

207
 Chapter 11: Starting a Podcast
Reaching a wider audience
Podcasting can help you reach a different audience. Many people like to read 
and enjoy taking in a well-written blog post. However, some blog readers 
enjoy listening to what you have to say as an audio recording. Other blog 
followers like to watch, rather than read, your blog post — especially if you 
have a compelling voice or are more photogenic than average. (I’ve been told 
I have a face for radio.)
Also, some of the things that you want to talk about on your blog might work 
better as an audio recording, rather than as a text post, such as interviews, 
soundscapes, or special events. And video is even more powerful: You can 
show off much more of your personality than you can by using just a text 
blog, and you can demonstrate things that you might find difficult or impos-
sible to convey with just words.
 
Think about when and where people might play your podcast and use that 
knowledge to help focus and inform your entries.
Podcasting in ancient times
In 2003, a number of bloggers thought it would 
be interesting to record their thoughts out loud 
and then publish the audio, usually as MP3 
files, through their blogs. Some of those blog-
gers started releasing audio blog entries on a 
regular basis. What happened next was a bit 
of a surprise. Because of the rising popular-
ity of MP3 players, such as Apple’s iPod, the 
audience for these podcasts grew extremely 
quickly. And thanks to RSS feeds, listeners 
could easily retrieve and download the latest 
recordings. People from all over the world 
started listening, recording, and publishing their 
own audio blogs. Several audio blogs became 
popular enough to gain some notice within the 
mainstream media. A hidden audience had 
been discovered.
In fact, most people believe the word podcast 
comes from the Apple iPod device, a popular 
MP3 player that can store and play podcasts 
and music. This belief comes close, but it’s not 
the whole truth. Podcasts arose at the same 
time that Apple’s device came on the scene, 
and bloggers conceived the name podcast to 
echo the idea that people could listen to these 
audio files on the go by using a hand-held 
device. But many devices could play the files, 
and in fact, people listen to most podcasts on 
a computer, not an MP3 player. Some say the 
word comes from a combination of the acronym 
pod (pod standing for portable-on-demand) and 
the word broadcast, but this meaning evolved 
after the word itself, probably in response to 
Apple’s attempts in 2005 to try to restrict the 
commercial use of the word pod.
Although some bloggers were also experiment-
ing with video in 2003, it took until 2005 for vid-
eocasting to really start to gain traction. Two 
technological shifts helped make this happen: 
iTunes, the program most people used to sub-
scribe to podcasts, started supporting video; 
and YouTube, the video-sharing site, made 
uploading and sharing video a much more 
common online activity.

208
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
Choosing between audio and video
If you’re ready to take the plunge into the production of a podcast, you need 
to decide what format you want to use. Both audio and video require special-
ized skills to produce.
 
Your level of technical competence and comfort can determine what medium 
you choose. You need to consider what type of podcast fits with your blog’s 
audience — don’t use videocasting, for example, if your blog targets those 
who use low-bandwidth connections.
Here are a few tips that can help you decide what type of podcast to use:
 
✓ Audio:
 
• Easier to produce than video because of a larger availability of 
open source software. Most software for professional video editing 
is expensive.
 
• Easier and generally quicker to edit than video.
 
• More portable than video. Fewer portable devices are designed to 
deal with video than with audio.
 
• Less of a space hog than video, making audio files less expensive 
to store on a Web host than video files.
 
✓ Video:
 
• More compelling. The visual and auditory components combined 
are more likely to keep a viewer from becoming distracted.
 
• You can make video shorter than audio. Audiences likely feel satis-
fied with a 2- to 4-minute video podcast, whereas they might want 
a much longer audio podcast.
 
• Gives you more visual elements to work with — both when you’re 
designing your blog and in individual entries.
 
• Has more related sites online where you can upload and share files.
 
• Requires the viewer’s attention, whereas people can listen to audio 
podcasts while completing other tasks. You can listen to an 
audio podcast while driving to work, for example.
 
Video and audio files can get very large. When you upload them to your Web 
server, you fill up your available disk space more quickly than you do if you 
upload only text and photos. Also, distributing audio and video requires more 
bandwidth. Be sure to keep an eye on your disk space and bandwidth usage so 

209
 Chapter 11: Starting a Podcast
that you aren’t hit with unexpected overage charges. Ask your Web host how 
to keep tabs on those elements, any fees that you may accrue, and whether 
you need more space and bandwidth.
If video is the medium of your choice, be sure to read Chapter 12 for tips and 
tools specific to video production. 
Planning Your Podcast
To create a podcast, you first need the desire to make it the best experience 
for the listeners that you can. If you aren’t having fun, it shows in the final 
result. Remember, even if you find your very first podcast a little frustrating, 
it gets easier.
Here are a few key ingredients that you need for a good podcast:
 
✓ Planning what you’ll say: You can make a single podcast, like a blog 
entry, about anything, so have a clearly defined topic before you start. 
Some podcasters write a script for every podcast that they record. 
Although you may find a script is overkill for you, jotting down a few 
notes or creating an outline to follow can help you streamline the cre-
ation process. You can find a list to help you brainstorm topics and the 
flow of you podcast later in this section.
 
✓ Finding your voice: You need to establish the tone of the piece before 
you go forward. How will the format of your overall podcast determine 
how you shoot or record it? Do you want to use some kind of traditional 
show format, or do you want to improvise the entire program each time? 
Taking these kinds of questions into account when you’re planning out 
your first podcast can help you make your program a success.
 
✓ Timing: Technically speaking, you can use as much or as little time as 
you want in your podcast, but you may find that you get a better end 
product when you give yourself limits, rather than chattering on about 
your favorite color or a funny thing your cat did when you really should 
be getting to the point of your recording session. Think about how much 
time you can reasonably expect your audience to give you, and target that 
length for your podcasts. In general, podcasts range from a few minutes to 
an hour. Also, make sure that you have enough time to record the entire 
podcast in the same location so that you don’t have awkward changes in 
the background noise, which can distract your listener or viewer.

210
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
 
✓ Recording conditions: When you want to record anything, you need 
to take into account environmental considerations before you hit the 
Record button. Is the environment you’re in quiet enough? Does the 
room have fans or computers that may annoy the listeners running in 
the background? For video, do you have sufficient lighting to produce 
watchable video? Try to eliminate distractions, such as phones ringing 
or people walking by. And if you can, do some test recording that you 
can listen to or watch so that you know what the quality of the final 
product will be before you record your entire podcast.
 
Blogging in writing is relatively easy in comparison to recording a podcast, 
and you can also more easily hide your inexperience in a text blog because 
you can rewrite and edit before posting. Although you can edit audio and video, 
removing stuttered speech or inappropriate facial expressions is harder than 
revising text in a blog post. The good news is that practice can help eliminate 
awkward moments.
 
If you get stuck thinking about a podcast topic or format, ask your readers for 
suggestions. Even if only five or ten readers respond, you can get some good 
ideas and direction.
Here’s a short list of podcast ideas that have been successful for other 
podcasters. Use this list to spark your creativity to find other topics that 
interest you:
 
✓ One-on-one interviews: Fascinating people in your neighborhood are 
just waiting to get on your podcast — especially people involved in a 
cause, an organization, or a business. Discover more about your family’s 
background or the adventures of your friends. See who in your acquain-
tance might fit the theme and direction of your podcast.
 
✓ Show your expertise: Show off what you know and share your knowledge 
with others — maybe even show your audience how to do something.
 
✓ Soundscapes: You can find fascinating sounds all around you that you can 
document. Record yourself walking through a forest or park. Make some 
observations about your surroundings, describe each sound, and explain 
why it’s important to you. Remember, what’s ordinary for you (waves at 
the beach, a passing train, construction noise, or a barn owl) might fasci-
nate someone living on the other side of the country or the world.
 
✓ Events: A performance at your local coffee house, a city hall meeting, or 
a surprise party all might make for an interesting podcast. Make sure to 
get permission before recording or publishing a podcast of an event.
 
✓ Discussions: General discussions in social settings can reveal some 
great conversations. Take your recorder along to your next BBQ or eve-
ning social, and direct the conversation along a theme or idea.

211
 Chapter 11: Starting a Podcast
If you take the time to plan out what things you want to share with your 
subscribers, you can make your podcast happen. With a recording device, a 
plan, and maybe someone else to talk to (although, not entirely necessary!), 
you can have a complete podcast episode in no time.
Assessing the Tools
Making your podcast requires a bit more than your fingers and a computer 
keyboard. Podcasts require recording equipment for audio and video. Here’s 
what you’re looking at:
 
✓ Computer: You need a computer of some kind. You can use a desktop or 
a laptop, although laptops are more flexible and allow you to edit on-
the-go. The computer must be able to handle editing audio files and, 
more importantly, video files. Video is a computer-intensive medium and 
requires a computer with a lot of power and a lot of disk space in order to 
process the large files that you record. Audio files can also be fairly large.
 
✓ Microphone: Microphones these days are built into almost every laptop, 
and you can easily buy external microphones. Consider purchasing a 
good microphone from a professional audio store because the micro-
phones that you get from the average computer store or on the typical 
laptop are poor quality. Ask a podcaster or the staff of a good audio 
store for advice about the best microphone for the kind of recording 
situation that you expect to be in. Expect to spend at least $40 for your 
microphone — it’s not the item to economize on.
 
✓ Sound-recording and sound-editing software: Unless you’re the sort of 
person who never deviates from a script or says “um,” you need soft-
ware to edit your audio or video. Solutions range from free to the price 
of a small automobile. Let your budget be your guide. You may want 
to start small and upgrade when you know more about podcasting and 
your own needs. A good starting point for audio software is the free 
program Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net). Audacity 
(as shown in Figure 11-2) is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux/
Unix. It’s the program of choice for many podcasters, largely because 
it’s free and open source. Audacity is a multi-track recording program — 
which means you can have two pieces of audio, such as a voice and a 
piece of music, and you can mix the two at different volumes or even 
fade from one to the other.
 
 A high-end solution is Sony’s Sound Forge (www.sonycreative
software.com/products/soundforgefamily.asp).

Dressing Up Your Podcast with Music 
and Sound Effects
 Nothing spices up a podcast like a little intro or background music. But 
podcasts — even if they’re produced and released at no cost to the listener — 
aren’t exempt from copyright restrictions. You need to find music and/or 
images that are in the public domain or licensed for republication.
 
Let me be clear: Even if you use only a little bit of a copyrighted song or give 
the performer credit, you’re still violating copyright if you don’t have a license 
or other permission to use the music. The same goes for using copyrighted 
images and video clips in videocasts.
But plenty of this material is available for you to use. The term podsafe has 
appeared to describe music, sounds, and other clips that are available for 
free unlimited use in podcasting, but no specific license exists to identify that 
a clip is podsafe, so be sure to read the terms and conditions before you inte-
grate sound or audio into your productions.

Creative Commons Search
http://search.creativecommons.org
Creative Commons is an organization that has evolved a set of licenses that 
you can use on your own content to permit or disallow use by others. If a 
publisher applies a Creative Commons license that allows republication, you 
can search for and find that content in the Creative Commons search area, 
specifically requesting content that you can use for commercial purposes or 
modify (see Figure 11-3).
Some of the types of licenses are
 
✓ Commercial Use: Permits use of the content for business and revenue-
generating purposes.
 
✓ Noncommercial Use: You may use this media only for noncommercial 
podcasts.
 
✓ Attribution: You can use the work only when you give credit to the 
creator.

The Freesound Project
www.freesound.org
Music is great, but what about sound effects? What podcast wouldn’t be 
improved by a few barking dogs and fart noises? I’m kidding, of course. But 
sound effects can really add a lot of value to your production, from realistic 
sounds of dialing a phone to a spring breeze. The Freesound Project can help 
you dress up your podcast.
Use their simple search box to find Creative Commons–licensed sound. You 
can also contribute your own sound effects to the project by creating an 
account and uploading to their Web site.
Publishing Your Podcast
You can put your podcast into the blogosphere fairly simply: Write a blog 
post about your podcast, upload your podcast media file, and then publish it 
by using your blog software.
But before you do that, you have a couple of tasks: You need to add metadata 
to and choose a file format for your podcast.
Assigning metadata
Metadata, simply put, is data about data. In the case of podcasts, metadata 
is data that describes your video or audio podcast. When you publish a
 podcast — whether audio or video — you need to provide descriptive meta-
data that podcast systems such as Apple’s iTunes and the RSS feed can read. 
After all, the computer can’t listen to or watch your podcast and figure out 
what it contains!
Common metadata types include
 
✓ Title
 
✓ Author name

216
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
 
✓ Publication information
 
✓ Topics covered
 
✓ Type of file
 
✓ Descriptions
 
✓ Keywords
Your editing software (both video and audio software packages) asks you to 
enter metadata when you create your audio or video files, and software such 
as iTunes, which is designed to support podcasts, also offers you a chance to 
provide metadata.
Choosing a format
Creating video and audio for general release means that you need to choose 
a file format that your audience can consume.
Most audio bloggers release audio files in the MP3 format. MP3 files are easy 
to create and play on a variety of devices. Most computer users are familiar 
with the format, and both browsers and preinstalled audio players have good 
built-in support for MP3s. 
Other options are available, such as OOG, an open format, and AAC, a format 
popular on Apple computers. Windows users can play AAC files, too, if they 
install QuickTime. The Apple iPod can’t play OOG files, which is a significant 
issue for most audiences. AAC has some nice features, such as audio book-
marks.
Storing your podcasts
When you have a podcast ready for primetime, you need to figure out where 
to put it online. Posting your podcast poses two problems:
 
✓ Storage: You need a place to put the actual file. Audio and video files are 
larger than text files, so you may run into an issue with disk space when 
you store them.
 
✓ Bandwidth (the amount of data your audiences downloads): You have 
to account for the additional bandwidth required for your audience to 
download those files. It takes more bandwidth to deliver audio or video 
to your audience than it does text or images.
You have two options for getting the storage and bandwidth you need: your 
Web-hosting server (the one that hosts your blog) or a free storage Web site.

217
 Chapter 11: Starting a Podcast
Putting your files on your own Web-hosting server
Check with your Web host to find out how much disk space you have avail-
able and what it costs to increase your allotment. Be aware that if you keep 
podcasting, you’ll eventually run out of disk space, even if you start off with 
quite a bit. If you’re a video podcaster, you want a hosting package that has 
several gigabytes of storage space. If you stick with only audio, you need a 
few gigabytes to start. While your podcasts grow in number, you’ll require 
more and more space, so keep that in mind. I talk about choosing a Web host 
in Chapter 3.
You also need to consider bandwidth when you choose your hosting ser-
vice. Most Web-hosting packages offer a standard amount of bandwidth, and 
you’re charged if you and your audience use more than that. Most Web hosts 
have pretty reasonable fees, unless your podcast becomes the hottest thing 
on the Web and your traffic becomes astronomical.
To give you a better idea about how file sizes can affect your Web-hosting 
costs, I show you some reasonable working numbers and you can compare 
these to your hosting package bandwidth:
 
✓ 1MB (megabyte) audio file: If you have 100 subscribers and you post one 
audio file a week, your estimated bandwidth for that file is about 100MB.
 
✓ 10MB (megabyte) video file: If you have 100 subscribers and you post 
one video file a week, your estimated bandwidth for that file is 1000MB 
or 1GB. 
From these numbers, you can see how your bandwidth needs may skyrocket. 
Thinking about these almost hidden costs is very important because you 
could get stuck with a hosting bill you weren’t expecting.
 
Bandwidth can be a confusing concept especially when dealing with a podcast. 
Web sites like Podtopeia (http://www.podtopia.net) have tools that let 
you generate estimates on how much it could cost you to host your own files.
 
Most hosting packages come with a finite amount of disk space and band-
width. You most likely can post only a certain number of podcasts before your 
hosting package runs out of space. Unless you have the dollars to spend, you 
probably need to find an alternative for storing your files.
Using a free storage and sharing Web site
Luckily for podcasters, a great service called Archive.org (www.archive.
org) is the home of the Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization founded 
in 1996 to build an Internet library in which researchers, historians, and the 

218
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
general public can store and access text, audio, moving images, software, and 
a vast collection of archived Web pages.
 
You can upload your podcasts to the Internet Archive for free, as long as 
you comply with its guidelines and describe your content. The system also 
provides and converts your video or audio format into other formats for 
increased accessibility.
You can find other podcast storage options, too. If you haven’t seen a You
Tube video on a blog or Web site lately, you must be living under a rock. 
YouTube (www.youtube.com) has soared in popularity. When you upload 
a video to YouTube, your video is listed on the site, where visitors can view 
and comment on it. But you can also grab the code for the file and embed it 
directly into your Web site or blog post. Files that you upload to YouTube are 
reformatted into Flash video. They must be shorter than ten minutes and less 
than 1GB in size.
Delivering your podcasts
After you have your audio and video online and your blog post created, you 
need to make sure that your blog has an RSS Web feed. Podcasts are typically 
delivered to playback software (such as Apple iTunes) through a subscrip-
tion to your blog’s RSS feed. I talk extensively about setting up and using RSS 
in Chapter 13.
Suffice it to say that you need an RSS feed so that your viewers and listeners 
can subscribe to it themselves, but also so that you can promote your podcast 
by using some of the handy podcast promotional directories and software out 
there. (See the following section for the promotion details.)
If you already subscribe to a number of blogs, you know that a syndicated 
blog feed contains information such as the title of the post, the main content, 
and maybe some author information. A podcast feed, in addition to the typi-
cal entry information, contains a link to a media file. If a consumer subscribes 
to a podcast feed by using an RSS reader, most modern readers automatically 
download the files so that the user can listen or watch at his or her convenience.
Promoting Your Podcast
Publishing your podcast on your Web site can help you publicize it, but you 
can get the word out in more effective ways. If you already have a good pro-
motional system built into your site and a decent-sized audience, you can get 
users to subscribe to your podcast without too much additional marketing, 
but if you need a little more promotion, you can use a number of strategies.

219
 Chapter 11: Starting a Podcast
Adding your podcast to FeedBurner
FeedBurner (http://feedburner.google.com) provides custom tracking 
and customization of podcast feeds. If you submit your podcast to Feed
Burner’s service, you can implement good promotion tools to help your 
podcast get more play.
Now a Google company, FeedBurner has a lot to offer bloggers and podcasters. 
You can use FeedBurner to do the following:
 
✓ Add metadata to your files.
 
✓ Make your feeds compatible with every RSS reader available.
 
✓ Add your podcast to the major podcast directories, making sure that 
people can find your podcast.
 
✓ Track the number of subscribers to your feed.
 
✓ Keep track of which podcasts visitors actually download.
To use FeedBurner, you must already have an RSS feed. If you’re using blog 
software, it probably offers you a feed. Check your documentation for more 
information and jump to Chapter 13 for more about RSS feeds.
Follow these steps to create a feed with FeedBurner:
 
1. Go to http://feedburner.com.
 
2. Create an account on FeedBurner if you don’t already have one.
 
3. On the FeedBurner main page (shown in Figure 11-5), paste the Web 
address (URL) of your RSS feed into the Burn a Feed Right This 
Instant field.

By using FeedBurner, you can actually keep track of how many subscribers 
your feed has and how they’re using your podcast, which is useful informa-
tion if you plan to pursue funding or sponsorship. Once you have set up a 
podcast with FeedBurner, log in and select it in order to view traffic informa-
tion in the Analyze section of the site.
Adding your podcast to iTunes
Due to the overwhelming popularity of Apple’s iTunes software as the main 
podcast viewer, you absolutely must submit your podcast to its service — 
unless, for some reason, you don’t want people to find your podcast.

222
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
Before you submit your podcast to iTunes, you need to do the following:
 
✓ Sign up for an Apple ID. Each submission is associated with a user 
account. If you have iTunes installed on your computer and have pur-
chased songs or other media from the iTunes store, you already have 
an Apple ID. To get an ID, download iTunes, which you find at www.
itunes.com; after you install the software, click the iTunes Store 
option on the left of the main screen to begin setting up your ID.
 
✓ Set up an RSS feed. If you’re using blog software, you likely already have 
a feed. Check your documentation for more information, and jump to 
Chapter 13 for more about RSS feeds.
 
✓ Have a few entries in your feed and make sure that the feed is working. 
You can test your feed by making sure your own feed reader (like Google 
Reader) can subscribe to your feed. If you see your posts in your reader, 
the feed should be working fine. Refer to Chapter 13 for information on 
subscribing to feeds in Google Reader.
 
 If you have a FeedBurner feed set up, you’ve already taken care of some 
of the optimization to make your feed work well in iTunes. Be sure to 
use the FeedBurner feed address when you sign up in iTunes.
Before iTunes adds podcasts to the Store, Apple iTunes staff reviews podcast 
submissions. The staff can refuse podcasts for even very small reasons. You may 
have problems getting a podcast added if you’ve been turned down before.
If you have the iTunes software installed on your computer, you can submit 
your podcast by using the iTunes interface. In order to get your podcast into 
the iTunes Store, follow these steps:
 
1. Start your iTunes software.
 
2. Click the iTunes Store navigation item in the left column.
 
 This will open the iTunes store interface.
 
3. Select the Podcasts link from the iTunes Store menu on the top of 
the screen.
 
 The Podcasts page appears.
 
4. Click the Submit a Podcast menu item located in the top-right of the 
page.
 
 iTunes loads the Submit Podcasts page.
 
5. Enter the RSS feed of your podcast in the Podcast Feed URL field and 
click the Continue button.
 
 If you’re not logged in to the iTunes Store, you’re prompted to log in at 
this point.
 
 iTunes submits your feed for review by Apple staff.

223
 Chapter 11: Starting a Podcast
After you submit your podcast, it might take several days or even weeks 
until your feed shows up in the iTunes library of podcasts. If your podcast 
is rejected for any reason, you receive an e-mail from Apple. (Unfortunately, 
they don’t provide reasons for rejections.)
Getting listed in podcast directories
Podcast directories help would-be listeners and viewers find known pod-
casts. Getting listed in these directories is an easy step to letting people 
know about your podcast. Most directories are organized by topic, and many 
of them offer subscription features that allow people to quickly sign up for 
your podcast. Listing your podcast in these directories can most certainly 
provide you with new traffic to your blog and podcast.
Here’s where you should get your podcast listed:
 
✓ Podcast Alley (www.podcastalley.com): This site contains a podcast 
directory, as well as news and information about podcasting.
 
✓ Podcast.com (www.podcast.com): Podcasts are organized by category 
(for example, entertainment or sports), and the home page displays a 
list of recently updated podcasts.
 
✓ Odeo (www.odeo.com): Plans are underway to turn this excellent 
directory site into a resource for finding information and Web sites 
for podcasting tools and functionality.
 
✓ Podcast Pickle (www.podcastpickle.com): One of the older podcast 
directories, Podcast Pickle offers visitors organization tools for the 
podcasts to which they subscribe.
 
✓ PodNova (www.podnova.com): More than just a directory. You can 
subscribe, listen, view, read, and maintain your feeds online by using 
PodNova.
 
✓ PodBean (www.podbean.com): Another directory where you can 
publish and host your podcast. You and your audience can listen and 
view your podcasts and share them on other Web sites like Facebook.
And if you don’t want to put your podcast on any of the sites in the preced-
ing list, check out Robin Good’s extensive list of podcast directories at www.

Working with Videos
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing a video camera and editing software
▶ Shooting and editing videos
▶ Getting your video on the Web
L
ike photos, videos add a new element to your blog that keeps people 
coming back more often. When you record and share a video online, 
you get to show off the real you in full color! Using video on your blog can 
increase your readership and viewership dramatically in ways that text-only 
blogs can’t achieve. Combining videos and text together in a single blog post 
is one of the more interesting ways to cover both sides of the Web reader-
ship battle: You can attract a broader audience to your Web site by using 
both video and text.
Of course, to use video, you need a video camera and the knowledge to trans-
fer that recorded gold from your camera to video software on your computer, 
and then to your Web site. Editing video can be an art in itself, and if you do 
it well, your videos can increase traffic to your blog.
Fortunately for you, the explosion of video tools and sharing services has 
made it easier than ever to put your video online and display it on your Web 
site. In this chapter, you can find tips for choosing your tools, recording and 
editing video, and hosting the videos that you create.
Getting Equipped
Today’s video cameras are a far cry from the equipment of the same name 
only a few years ago. At that time, most video cameras used Hi8 digital tape 
and MiniDV as the recordable medium. You could find options for MiniDVD 
cameras as well, but they weren’t as popular. But that was then, and this is 
now. The video camera landscape has changed, and I mean, it has changed! 

226

The days of having to purchase video tapes and recordable media are nearly 
gone.
A quick walk around any consumer electronics store proves my point: Most 
of the latest and greatest cameras come equipped with hard drives and Flash 
memory. For the average blogger who wants to get into some video blogging, 
you can shoot video more quickly and put that video online and onto your 
blog much, much more quickly than ever before.
To fast track your career in video blogging, you need the following:
 
✓ A digital video camera that has a USB or FireWire connection to get your 
video from the camera to your computer
 
✓ Video-editing software that can help you review, edit, and add any spe-
cial effects that you may want
 
✓ A video-sharing service or blog package that lets you share video files 
easily
Doing your research
Plenty of great consumer review Web sites and blogs offer all kinds of advice 
about what cameras on the market today can do and what kinds of recording 
they’re suited for. CNET is one of my favorites (http://reviews.cnet.
com/camcorders). Many traditional camera stores also train staff about 
all the video options of traditional cameras, so don’t hesitate to ask for help 
from a real person who has expertise.
Ultimately, the type of video blogging that you want to do determines what 
camera you need. Most video cameras are quite small and portable, others 
are designed for hand-held shooting, and still others for tripods and exter-
nal microphones. Some cellular phones have video cameras built into them, 
and the quality from those phones is high enough to post online. Or a large 
camera that has better lenses and more recording options (such as night 
shooting and motion stabilization) rather than lower end cameras may 
appeal to you. Here’s the breakdown of what’s available:
 
✓ Low-end point-and-shoot digital cameras: Many digital still cameras and 
mobile phones also enable you to capture short videos. The cameras 
are cheap, and you can retrieve video as easily as still photographs. 
For amateur video artists who are focusing on very short video clips, a 
digital still camera that has limited video capabilities is the best choice 
because of the lower cost. You can also check out portable HD pocket 
cameras.

227
 Chapter 12: Working with Videos
 
 You may not get the best quality on a cheap digital still camera, but if 
you just want to experiment with video, getting this kind of inexpensive 
camera may do the trick. The latest digital still cameras can shoot video 
in high definition and have single-click or push-button uploading to a 
YouTube account. If you’re interested in both a still and video camera, 
an all-in-one solution works well, as long as you plan to produce only 
very short videos.
 
✓ Midrange: If you’re looking for more video options and a higher qual-
ity picture than you can get with a low-end point-and-shoot camera, or 
if you’re planning to record segments of more than a couple minutes, a 
midrange digital video camera is more than ample. Such a camera gives 
you the flexibility to use it for everything from sit-down interviews to 
shots from atop your bike. The following section introduces the different 
kinds of midrange cameras that you can find on the market.
 
✓ High-end: Most video bloggers have no need for professional-level video 
cameras, which are typically priced in the thousands of dollars. For one 
thing, the video quality that they can record is likely wasted on a Web 
audience, and frankly, most consumer-level computers don’t have the 
hard drive space or processers to handle the humongous files generated 
by these machines. High-end cameras are also so large that they’re not 
all that portable.
Exploring camera options
Do as much research as you can about the type of filming that you want to 
do. Video cameras traditionally are more expensive than digital still cameras, 
so hobbyists who want to record quick videos for their blogs may not want 
to make the investment. This higher price point means that you need to 
research features; the most feature-loaded camera may not be the best one 
for your budget or needs. If you’re looking to experiment with video, consider 
renting a video camera or borrowing one from your best friend (who’s quite 
understanding!), and then see how you like it.
Flash memory cameras
Flash memory is the most common storage medium for digital still cameras, 
and video cameras have adopted the same technology for a majority of the 
low-cost camcorders. Flash memory cameras come in two flavors: removable 
cards or built-in nonremovable memory. Cameras that have nonremovable 
Flash memory cards (or sticks) usually come with a USB cable that you can 
connect to your computer so that you can move your video from the camera 
to the computer (and thence on to your Web site). Some cameras even come 
with a button that you can press — after doing a little configuration — to 
upload anything that you record directly to YouTube.

228
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
 
A quick note about single-click uploading: Some manufacturers of video cam-
eras have chosen YouTube as the de facto single-click video service. If you 
don’t use YouTube to host your videos, having a camera with this feature 
doesn’t do you much good and certainly isn’t worth paying extra. Check 
around and do your research. Video recorder companies may latch on to 
other services in the next few years. And if you do end up with one of these 
cameras and don’t want to use YouTube, you can still access your videos on 
your camera in other ways. It isn’t the end of your video career if your camera 
doesn’t talk to your video-hosting provider.
If your camera has a removable card, you need the means to read the card by 
using your computer, either with a USB card drive or through a built-in card 
reader in your computer or printer.
Hard drive cameras
Hard drive cameras are usually relatively high-end cameras and tend to cost 
more than Flash drive or tape cameras. However, if technology trends in 
the video camera market continue (and there’s no reason to think that they 
won’t), many of the hard drive cameras will continue to drop in price and 
become affordable even to the hobbyist video bloggers.
This level of camera usually has both a higher quality of construction and 
quality of picture than cheaper cameras. Good-quality lenses and long 
recording times are also the norm for the more expensive recorders. Unlike 
some of the less pricey cameras, hard drive cameras don’t have removable 
media that you can plug into your computer. To get video from your camera 
to your computer, you need to plug your camera into your computer and 
then copy files over, much like you do with any external hard drive. Some 
cameras require you to install a software package to facilitate this process.
Webcams
In the past, I’ve played with recording video by using a Webcam (specifically, 
on YouTube). If you have a Webcam attached to your computer, you can 
record video quickly and (when you tie that Webcam into YouTube) upload 
it while you record, which means you don’t need to store it locally. I think 
Webcams provide a perfect way to record and post quick video commentaries.
 
Webcams tend to be of a decent but not wonderful quality, and if you upload 
directly, you clearly can’t use any editing or special effects. If you’re comfort-
able going live while you record, a Webcam absolutely gives you the fastest 
way to create video and get it to your audience. Most consumer electronics 
stores carry a good selection of Webcams, and many computers (particularly 
laptops) come with one already installed.

229
 Chapter 12: Working with Videos
Choosing video-editing software
Software that you use to process video images is a little more challenging 
than the software that you use to edit still images, such as Picasa or iPhoto. 
For starters, video-editing software can be a little more demanding on your 
computer’s resources; the file sizes alone are probably bigger than most digi-
tal documents that you deal with regularly. Add in a few special effects, and 
the RAM (random access memory) that is needed can really tax your trusty 
old desktop machine.
Having said that, you can find good video-editing software options for all 
levels of videographers. Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X both come with 
video-recording and video-editing software built in, and this software easily 
meets the needs of beginners and light hobbyists. If you decide that you need 
a little more editing flexibility and a few more options, the software that you 
need is more complex to use and can get a bit expensive.
When you’re looking for video-editing software, you need to pay attention to 
options such as file types and special effects:
 
✓ File formats: Video requires certain codec functionality, and you have 
many kinds to choose from. Computers and the Web tend to recognize 
only a couple of formats, but most software can work with all kinds of 
formats. The most common formats for video on the Web include WMV, 
MOV, AVI, and MPEG.
 
 Make sure that your video-editing software enables you to import the file 
format in which your camera records video and can convert your edited 
video into a Web-friendly format. (Or see the sidebar “Dealing with video 
formats,” in this chapter, for details about conversion software.)
 
✓ Standard editing tools: Most video-editing software provides you with 
the editing tools that you need. You ultimately want nonlinear editing 
software — which enables you to divide your video recording into clips 
and arrange them in whatever sequence you want — because editing in 
this way is much faster. If you can get a few additional options in your 
software, such as transitions and minor special effects, you should be 
good to go.
 
✓ Video sharing: You don’t need a program that integrates with the blog-
ging tool you use or with a video-sharing service such as YouTube, but 
such a program can really help you speed up the amount of time it takes 
you to get video online.
 
If you’ve purchased a digital video camera recently, be sure to check two 
things. First, did your camera come with any software for editing video? More 
and more, cameras are coming packaged with video-editing software, which 
are sometimes “light” or trial versions that you can upgrade for additional fea-
tures. Also, check whether the camera comes with software recommendations 
that the manufacturer knows are compatible with the camera’s video formats.

Editing video does require a bit of practice, and as always, not all video pack-
ages are created equal. Here are a few of the most common video-editing pack-
ages available:
 
✓ Windows Live Movie Maker: Free; Windows only; http://download.
live.com/moviemaker. Available for Windows users whose comput-
ers run Vista or Windows 7, this free tool gives you basic editing func-
tionality in a quick and easy interface. See more about Windows Live 
Movie Maker in the following section.
 
✓ iMovie: Free; Mac only; www.apple.com/ilife/imovie. Import, edit, 
and organize video in one tool. You can easily use the editing tools, 
which use the much-vaunted Mac plug-and-play interface. You find a sec-
tion devoted to iMovie later in this chapter. 
 
✓ Adobe Premiere Elements: $99; Windows only; www.adobe.com/
products/premiereel. This program is the top-selling consumer 
video editor, and it has a decent level of power and an easy-to-use con-
figuration. If you’re new to video editing, check out Premiere Elements 8 
For Dummies, by Keith Underdahl, for help in how to use this program.
 
✓ Adobe Premiere Pro: $799; Mac and Windows; www.adobe.com/
products/ premiere. This software is for those who really want to 
become professional video editors. It’s overkill for most folks, but if you 
want professional results and have money to burn, you can get access to 
some incredibly flexible tools by choosing this great suite.
 
✓ Final Cut Express: $199; Mac only; www.apple.com/finalcut
express. If you want to get into the Final Cut world but can’t afford the 
price of the Pro level, Final Cut Express — a sold, flexible editing tool — 
may suit your needs.
Dealing with video formats
Worst case scenario: You have a digital video 
camera and software for editing digital video, 
but the software can’t read the file format of 
your camera’s video. Before you run out and 
replace either your camera or your software, 
look into a solution that’s likely to be a little less 
pricey — conversion software. Sure, it adds an 
extra step to the whole process, but if money is 
tight, you may prefer to spend time, rather than 
dollars.
You can find some free software packages 
available that allow you to convert your existing 
video files into the format of your choice. Find 
out what formats your software can accept, 
and then set up conversion software to convert 
the format your camera produces to the format 
your software can read, and then save it or 
export it as a new file.
Software such as Prism Video Converter (www.
nchsoftware.com/prism) or AVS Video 
Converter (www.avs4you.com/AVS-
Video-converter.aspx) are good start-
ing points if you have to deal with this issue.

231
 Chapter 12: Working with Videos
 
✓ Final Cut Pro: $999; Mac only; www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/
finalcutpro. Like the Adobe Premiere Pro package, Final Cut Pro is 
over the top for most Web bloggers — a tool for serious videographers 
who have serious budgets.
Windows Live Movie Maker
http://download.live.com/moviemaker
Microsoft Windows comes with Windows Movie Maker 2 installed; the newest 
release of the Movie Maker program is called Windows Live Movie Maker 
(see Figure 12-1). It’s available online for free.
The editing suite has been redesigned with ease of use in mind. It comes with 
all the basic video-editing tools. You can figure out how to use the program 
reasonably easily, and the interface is consistent with the Microsoft Office 
2007 applications.
By using Windows Live Movie Maker, you can edit, clip, and add some minor 
special effects. In addition, you can upload directly from the program to 
YouTube.

iMovie
www.apple.com/ilife/imovie
Apple’s iMovie is part of the suite of tools that comes with iLife, usually pre-
installed when you purchase an Apple computer. If you don’t have iLife, $79 
gets you iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, iWeb, and iDVD.
iMovie — see Figure 12-2 — is the most affordable editor that you can get for 
Mac OS X. The software provides you with all the basic tools for editing videos: 
inserting clips, adjusting the quality of the picture, adding minor special 
effects, and then exporting them in formats that you can post on the Web.
The latest version has adopted much of the interface from iPhoto, letting you 
organize and sort your videos like you do with still photographs.

Choosing a video host
Storing video files and then serving them to your Web visitors can be costly. 
Web hosts typically charge for disk space and bandwidth used, and that 
means the more videos you put online and the more popular they are, the 
more Web hosting costs you. So, consider using a video-sharing service that 
takes care of storage and bandwidth for you, and still lets you embed the 

233
 Chapter 12: Working with Videos
files in your Web site or blog. Social-network video-sharing services, such as 
YouTube, Blip.tv, Vimeo, and others, have become the de facto way of shar-
ing video with your viewers.
YouTube (www.youtube.com) is the most popular of all the video services. 
Since it was purchased by Google in 2006, its popularity hit the mainstream, 
and now even traditional media outlets use YouTube to post their own clips 
of shows and newscasts that they produce. You can see all kinds of video on 
the site, and I recommend trying YouTube as your first sharing service. (You 
can always post your videos on other services, as well.)
On YouTube, you can
 
✓ Upload and organize videos by using tags (keywords), create playlists, 
and add your videos to groups.
 
✓ Post videos and receive comments (see Figure 12-3).
 
✓ View other members’ videos and leave comments. You can also leave 
video responses!
 
✓ Choose to make some or all of your videos private, or share them with a 
select group.
 
Figure 12-3:

234
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
YouTube accounts are free, and you can upload as many videos as you want. 
However, an individual video file that you upload can’t exceed 1GB in size 
and must be less than ten minutes long.
If your videos are much longer and you don’t think you can make them any 
shorter, you may want to consider other video services. Services such as the fol-
lowing are alternatives to YouTube on which you can upload and post videos:
 
✓ Blip.tv (www.blip.tv)
 
✓ Dailymotion (www.dailymotion.com)
 
✓ Yahoo! Video (http://video.yahoo.com/explore/videos/
categories/video+blogs) 
 
✓ Metacafe (www.metacafe.com)
 
✓ Revver (www.revver.com)
 
✓ Vimeo (www.vimeo.com)
Each has a slightly different set of features, but all do the basics: allow you to 
upload videos and share them with others.
 
Many of the popular video bloggers share their videos on three or four of the 
most popular video-sharing services, although these bloggers usually use 
only one service to share the files on their own blogs. The purpose of putting 
the video on several video-sharing services is to tap into the communities on 
each, building up views and traffic.
 
Whatever service you choose, look for features that simplify uploading and 
sharing videos on your blog, such as the following:
 
✓ Embedding a video (adding a bit of code that displays your video): 
Some services make embedding very easy, but others may be a bit more 
technical.
 
✓ Tracking views of your video: See at a glance which of your videos are 
popular (and which aren’t).
 
✓ Subscribing to your video stream: When visitors can subscribe, they 
know about your new content right away and are more likely to view 
your video.
Creating a Video
I don’t have enough space in this book to give you in-depth advice about 
shooting video and editing it, so in the following sections, I give you the 
basics. However, I recommend that if this topic interests you, look into Digital 
Video For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Keith Underdahl, and Videoblogging 

235
 Chapter 12: Working with Videos
For Dummies, by Stephanie Cottrell Bryant. Those books together give you 
a crash course in how to shoot, edit, and post video to the Web in much 
greater detail than this book can cover.
Shooting video
Video is probably the hardest thing to capture for your blog because video 
cameras can be bulky, and sometimes, taking a video camera with you just 
isn’t convenient.
 
Here are a few tips for shooting video for your blog:
 
✓ Always take your camera with you. If you’re heading out to the corner 
store or visiting family, find a way to have your camera with you so that 
it isn’t annoying to carry. I can guarantee that if you don’t make a habit 
of having your camera with you, you’ll miss good stuff.
 
✓ Keep your camera charged and make sure to have extra charged 
batteries in your camera bag. Some devices have built-in batteries 
and require you to plug them into your computer to charge them. All 
video cameras have custom rechargeable batteries, so try to maintain 
a charged state in the batteries — you never know when you’ll need to 
shoot something.
 
✓ The higher quality of video in newer cameras means that you don’t 
need to worry about shooting the perfect video. You can shoot from 
the hip, even with a video camera. Remember, having a poor-quality 
piece of video is still better than not having any video at all.
 
✓ You may find a tripod really helpful, especially in situations in which 
you’re taping long pieces of video. For one thing, you don’t have to 
hold the camera the whole time. For another, handheld video shots can 
look shaky, making them hard for your visitors to watch.
 
✓ Not everyone wants to appear in videos, especially videos that go 
online for anyone to see. Before you shoot, get the permission of your 
subjects, and be specific about how you plan to use the footage. You 
might also want to get some of these permissions documented in writing 
to cover yourself, legally.
 
✓ Practice, practice, practice. Your videos get better the more effort and 
time you put into them, so don’t get too discouraged if your first efforts 
don’t come out the way you imagined. You’ll get there.
Of course, not all video bloggers shoot video of things around them in their 
life, of events, or of whatever they run into. Many video bloggers choose to talk 
to their camera directly or have personal conversations with their audience. 
These kinds of videos are very popular and garner quite a number of com-
ments and responses from people who view them. The most interesting blogs 
can do both styles of video recording and still maintain large audiences.

236
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
Try different styles and see what your readers like best. Do they like you talk-
ing to the camera, or do they prefer when you’re out shooting in the wild? 
Get creative with your video style and figure out what you like to shoot. Keep 
it fun for yourself — that enthusiasm shows through in the videos you post.
Editing video
After you shoot some video, you can edit it by using your video-editing software.
The most common edits to make involve trimming a video, selecting the 
parts that you want to show, and adding text and transitions between the 
cuts that you make. You really get to decide how creative you want to be. 
You don’t need to use transitions or even edit your video at all. Remember, 
just because you can add a barn-door transition effect doesn’t mean you 
must! Go with what feels right for the tone of your video and with your audi-
ence. Here are a few of the most common editing methods video bloggers use 
to make their videos more appealing:
 
✓ Cuts and trims: A lot of amateur online video is actually only a single 
shot. For example, a video blogger who uses a Webcam typically just sits 
in front of the camera and talks. The camera viewpoint doesn’t change. 
However, most professional video is actually made up of several differ-
ent shots, played one after the other (a shot of the exterior of a building, 
then your subject’s office, then the interview of the person, for example). 
Taking multiple shots means that you likely need to cut out unwanted 
material, or even to rearrange the order of the clips that you have.
 
✓ Transitions: Transitions are edit points between different video clips. Many 
videographers like to make those points flow smoothly and not jar the 
person watching the video between cuts. They add effects such as fades, 
wipes, or peels, or they insert a shape or black screen in between the clips.
 
 Software that allows you to add transitions typically offers you the abil-
ity to customize a transition by changing its length or appearance.
 
✓ Text and credits: You can add three types of text bits to your videos:
 
• Title: You typically show titles at the beginning of your video.
 
• Caption: A caption is text that sits on top of your video clip to iden-
tify who’s talking, or to provide additional information.
 
• Credits: The credits are scrolling text, much like movie credits.
 
✓ Audio: Audio tracks, such as music or voice overlays, can add value 
to your videos. Audio transitions can smooth the flow from one clip to 
another, and you can adjust the volume and add fades at the beginning 
and end of your video or each scene.

237
 Chapter 12: Working with Videos
Putting Video Online
After you create your video masterpiece, you need somewhere to upload 
it. In the following sections, I show you how you can upload your video to 
YouTube. You use a similar process with most other video-sharing services. 
Regardless of which service you choose, look for the uploading instructions if 
you need help.
Uploading to YouTube
Uploading your videos is straightforward: Grab your video file, upload the 
file, add a few tags, and you’re done! Just follow these steps:
 
1. Open your browser to YouTube (www.youtube.com) and sign in.
 
 The main YouTube account page opens.
 
 If you don’t already have a YouTube account, you have to sign up for 
one before you can upload a video.
 
2. Click the yellow Upload button at the top-right of the screen.
 
 The uploader interface appears.
 
3. Click Upload Video (another yellow button) in the center of the screen 
and select the video file you’re uploading from your local hard drive.
 
 The Video File Upload screen opens.
 
4. While your video is uploading, you can enter the video title, a descrip-
tion of the video, and some tags in the appropriate text boxes, and 
select which category the video belongs in from the drop-down list (see 
Figure 12-4). You can also select which privacy setting you want if you 
want to restrict your video to a select group of other YouTube users.
 
5. Click Save Changes.
 
 Your video page loads, displaying your file. It may take a little while for 
YouTube to fully process the video (depending on the size of the file 
that you uploaded).
Uploading to YouTube via your Webcam
You can upload a video directly to YouTube by using your Webcam. If you 
have a Webcam and want to try this direct upload, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your browser to YouTube (www.youtube.com) and sign in.
 
 If you don’t already have a YouTube account, you have to sign up for 
one before you can upload a video.

238
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
 
2. Click the yellow Upload button at the top-right of the screen.
 
 The uploader interface appears.
 
3. Click the Record from Webcam button.
 
 A page opens, where you need to authorize your browser to connect to 
your Webcam.
 
4. Click Authorize so that you can start recording.
 
5. Record your video (see Figure 12-5).
 
 You can also preview your video or re-record if you don’t like what you 
just did.
 
6. Click Publish.
 
 After you publish your video, it may take a few minutes to show up 
online. While you’re waiting, you can fill in the description and title on 
the video page.

Inserting a YouTube video in a blog post
You can add your videos to your blog via YouTube quite simply. You need to 
copy a little bit of code called the embed code from your video on YouTube 
and paste it into your blog post. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open your browser to the YouTube page of the video that you want to 
embed.
 
 Most videos on YouTube offer embed code. The code is located on the 
top-right side of the video page, where it says Embed.
 
2. Copy the Embed code from the YouTube page.
 
 Click the code to select it and press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac).
 
3. Start a new blog post in your blogging software and paste the code 
into the appropriate spot by pressing Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac).
 
4. Save and/or Publish your blog post.
 
5. Check your blog and try playing the video, just to make sure it all 
works.

flavors of RSS feeds, syndicating your content across the

Reaching Out with RSS
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out what RSS really is
▶ Signing up for an RSS feed
▶ Putting RSS to work for your blog
N
o fashionable blog would be caught dead without a Web feed — it’s 
essential for both accessibility and promotion of your blog. RSS (Really 
Simple Syndication) feeds, or Web feeds, give you an easy way to distribute 
your content, such as blog posts and podcasts, to your Web audience.
But what is RSS, really? In this chapter, I explain what an RSS feed is, how to 
create your blog feed (it’s easy), how to subscribe to feeds, and more.
Getting the Goods on Web Feeds
RSS is one of the hottest technologies on the Internet today. Since 2003 — 
which is when blogs truly reached mainstream awareness — blogs and other 
technologies have adopted RSS at an exponential rate. Companies such as 
Mozilla, Microsoft, IBM, and many others are finding new and interesting 
ways to use RSS feeds to share information, both through their Web sites and 
through internal communication processes.
Put simply, when you syndicate your blog by using a Web feed, software 
reads your blog posts, which it formats by using XML (eXtensible Markup 
Language). XML is an Internet standard and marks your prose so that soft-
ware applications can understand and display it properly for readers who 
subscribe to your blog.
Why is RSS a good thing? Well, it means that code can be used to easily dis-
play your blog’s feed on other Web sites, from blogs to search engines. Sites 
that pull in news from multiple sources use RSS feeds to do so, and being syn-
dicated in this way can earn you traffic from those sites back to your blog.

244
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
But more importantly, newsreader software that any visitor to your site 
might use can read RSS feeds, and visitors can then access your blog quickly 
and easily. By subscribing to a blog via an RSS feed, visitors don’t have 
to bookmark hundreds of blogs and check them every 20 minutes to see 
whether the bloggers have updated them; a user can simply log in to his or 
her newsreader software to see in one window all the feeds to which he or 
she subscribes.
 
On the Web, several different terms describe the subject of this chapter: RSS, 
Atom, Web feed, and news feed are a few. Web site developers use all these 
terms interchangeably, but the most accurate one is Web feed. RSS is simply a 
type of Web feed. Even though Web feed is the most accurate name, I usually 
refer to RSS feeds because that’s how most blogs and bloggers refer to them.
 
If you want to find out more about RSS than I can provide in this chapter, 
either to give your blog visibility in the world or to pull other blog content into 
your own blog or site, consider reading Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds 
For Dummies, by Ellen Finkelstein.
Breaking it down further
Essentially, RSS gives your blog the ability to break down its content into 
a basic text file. Software creates this text file in a special XML format that 
makes up the feed. Blog software then distributes this plain-text version of 
your blog content to other Web sites, search engines, and blogosphere track-
ing services. Figure 13-1 shows the code behind an RSS feed.

pretty for 
humans to 
look at.

 Chapter 13: Reaching Out with RSS
A few acronyms for RSS are floating around out on the Internet. Here are the 
acronyms you’re most likely to see, and if you want to talk about RSS with 
your blog readers, you can use any of them (but the first one tends to be the 
most popular):
 
✓ Really Simple Syndication
 
✓ RDF Site Summary
 
✓ Real Simple Syndication
 
✓ Rich Site Summary
 
You can use RSS to syndicate content on your blog, but most mainstream 
news agencies also use RSS to make their news information more accessible. 
News services such as Reuters, CBC, CNN, and the Washington Post use RSS 
technology to spread their articles beyond their own Web sites.
Many Web browsers use XML to handle displaying RSS feeds in a more attrac-
tive format for humans. If you click an RSS feed link and find that the content 
that loads looks rather user friendly, you’re probably using a browser that 
understands and formats XML nicely.
 
For a really excellent short video that describes just what RSS is and how it 
works, visit the Common Craft blog at www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_
english. This video uses simple graphics and words to get across the con-
cepts that make RSS so groundbreaking.
Confused? Well, don’t worry, because nearly all blog software automatically 
builds your RSS feed and helps you advertise it to your blog visitors. So, 
you’re most likely covered, in any case — but if you know a little bit about 
RSS and why it’s important to your blog, you can ensure your blog content 
reaches a wider audience.
Generating Web traffic
Some bloggers have a tendency to limit the distribution of their content and 
keep it off other sites. The reasoning goes that you worked hard to create 
that content, so why should other sites and software get to display it for free?
 
Actually, because of its ease of use, RSS can help you gain more users. Your 
Web site can travel farther than ever because you can distribute RSS feeds 
with little to no effort on your part. Because syndication of your content 
includes links back to your blog, people who are exposed to your RSS feed 
probably click those links and come to your blog.
So, because the RSS feed is only text, it doesn’t have to stay in one place. Any 
number of Web sites and blogs can pick it up and display it.

246
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
Creating a feed for your blog
Unless you really want to mess around in the code of your own RSS files, you 
shouldn’t need to do anything special to get started with RSS. Most blog soft-
ware already includes an RSS feed that pulls together and syndicates your 
blog. At most, you might have to turn on the option to have an RSS feed.
Then, just blog normally and ignore the feed — your users can find it and 
subscribe, and your blog content flows automatically into the feed.
 
Chances are that your blog software already has RSS capability. Be sure to 
check your administrative settings and documentation. If it doesn’t, you might 
also be able to add the functionality by using a plug-in.
If you don’t have software that creates an RSS feed, you have a couple of 
options. If you’re a programmer or coder, you can probably pick up enough 
XML to hand-code an RSS feed yourself. But an even better option is to use 
some of the third-party feed creation tools available today:
 
✓ FeedYes (www.feedyes.com): Use this simple tool to create an RSS 
feed from any Web site or blog. You can create multiple feeds and, with 
an account, edit and manage them. FeedYes is free.
 
✓ Feedfire (www.feedfire.com): This service lets you create RSS feeds 
for any Web site that doesn’t already have one, and it promises to let 
you do it without any programming (although none of these tools have a 
high technical bar). You can get started for free.
 
✓ Feed43 (www.feed43.com): Set up a feed for your blog quickly and for 
free. Increase the frequency with which your feed is updated by buying a 
higher level of feed, starting at $29 a year.
 
✓ FeedForAll (www.feedforall.com): You can use this tool to create 
and edit RSS feeds for your blog or podcast. You must be able to install 
software on your Web host to use this tool. Pricing starts at $39.95.
When a feed exists, you don’t need to do anything else. Search engines and 
software tools automatically find it when they index your blog, and your 
readers can subscribe to your feed when and if they choose to do so.
Subscribing to an RSS Feed
I’m sure you read at least a few favorite blogs regularly. Do you visit them 
every day or maybe even several times a day? Are you ever frustrated 
because the site hasn’t been updated yet? Do you ever miss a post by a few 
minutes, and then read it hours or days later, and miss out on the conversa-
tion? The solution to this problem is RSS.

247
 Chapter 13: Reaching Out with RSS
Follow these basic steps to get set up with your favorite blog’s RSS feed:
 
1. Choose a newsreader and sign up to begin using it.
 
 You can find tons out there, and I tell you about a few of my favorites in 
the sections “Finding a Web-based newsreader” or “Choosing a desktop-
based reader,” later in this chapter.
 
2. Subscribe to an RSS feed.
 
 Don’t worry — you can subscribe to an RSS feed even more easily (and 
cheaply) than you can subscribe to a newspaper or magazine, although 
the idea is similar. The newsreader software you chose and signed up to 
use provides specific instructions on subscribing.
 
3. Check your newsreader.
 
 When you subscribe to an RSS feed, new blog posts appear in your 
newsreader every time the blogger posts a new entry to his or her blog. 
When the blogger publishes a new post, the RSS feed is updated a few 
minutes later, and the newsreader checks the feed and alerts you to the 
new posts.
 
4. Click, read, and voilà!
 
 No more boring bookmarking and refreshing a blog over and over. You 
go to the blog only when it has new content, so you never miss anything.
You can subscribe to as many (or as few) feeds as you want, potentially keep-
ing track of hundreds of sites, all in one place.
Browser newsreaders
Some browsers have built-in newsreaders that you can use to subscribe to 
feeds and then read them. On a PC, Internet Explorer 7 and higher allows 
you to read, subscribe to, and manage feed subscriptions right inside the 
browser. Mac and PC users of the Firefox Web browser, you can install a 
plug-in called Sage (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/77) to add news-reading capabilities to the browser.
On the Mac, you can use the built-in newsreader in the Safari browser to sub-
scribe to and read feeds.
Finding a Web-based newsreader
Web-based newsreaders are online services that allow you to aggregate your 
favorite feeds into a simple interface where you can read your subscriptions. 
These online services are usually free.

248
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
The big advantage to using a Web-based newsreader is that you can log in 
to the service from any computer, even if you’re traveling, at the library, or 
using your son’s laptop. In most cases, however, you need to have Internet 
access in order to read the blog posts because you have to be online. Google 
Reader, Bloglines, and NewsGator, introduced in the following sections, are 
three popular Web-based newsreaders.
Google Reader
www.google.com/reader
Google Reader is a great Web-based feed aggregator. If you already regis-
tered with Gmail or other Google services, getting started with Reader is as 
simple as signing in at www.google.com/reader. If you don’t have a Google 
account already, click the Create an Account Now link.
Google Reader’s interface is similar to the other Google Web products, and it 
features feed searching, RSS feed sharing, mobile access, and offline reading. 
Google Reader is shown in Figure 13-2.

 Chapter 13: Reaching Out with RSS
Bloglines
www.bloglines.com
The Web-based application Bloglines is super-simple to use, with quick tools 
for adding a subscription and sorting your subscriptions into categories. One 
of the fun features of Bloglines is that you can produce a blogroll — a list 
of links to blogs — to put in your blog’s sidebar, sharing the blogs to which 
you’re subscribed with your readers. Bloglines even carries over the catego-
rization when it displays your blog subscriptions. You can mark some feeds 
as private if you prefer not to share them with the world.
NewsGator
www.newsgator.com
Like Bloglines and Google Reader, NewsGator is a handy online newsreader 
that you can use for free. In NewsGator, you can quickly subscribe to blog 
feeds, sort them into categories that you choose, and tell at a glance which 
sites have new content. NewsGator also gives you some handy tools next to 
each post to let you e-mail the post to a friend, send the post via an instant 
messenger program, or save it in a Clippings file for later use.
 
When you sign up for NewsGator, you can pre-populate your newsreader with 
popular blogs in categories such as Sports, Technology, or Top Blogs. If you’re 
new to blogging, you can use this feature to find some interesting blogs to 
read to help figure out this whole blogging thing.
Choosing a desktop-based reader
Desktop readers are a little different than online newsreaders. You install 
desktop readers directly on your computer (so they don’t use any Web-based 
tools), which gives you a bit more control over when the reader checks and 
updates your feeds. Best of all, a desktop reader actually downloads the 
feeds to your machine, so you can read blogs even when you don’t have 
Internet access — perhaps while making a commute or on an airplane.
 
Some people believe that a major drawback of desktop readers is that they 
cause your computer to run slower than it normally would, especially when 
it has to check a large number of feeds. Because computers have so many dif-
ferences, I can’t predict whether a desktop reader may slow down your com-
puter, but definitely watch out for this problem.
FeedDemon (Windows)
www.newsgator.com/individuals/feeddemon/default.aspx

250
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
FeedDemon is a free RSS reader client that you can install locally on your 
computer. It downloads updates from your feeds on a regular basis (which 
you can configure), and it features many great organizational tools that keep 
your feeds updated and easy to peruse.
FeedDemon, available from the folks at NewsGator, also downloads and 
stores any podcasts to which you subscribe, and it transfers those podcasts 
to your portable audio player. As if that isn’t enough, you can also set up 
custom news watches to keep track of topics or events that you want to 
know more about.
FeedDemon is available only for Windows.
NetNewsWire (Mac)
www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswire/default.aspx
NewsGator’s Mac newsreader solution is NetNewsWire, a free program 
that takes advantage of preinstalled Apple software on the Mac. As with 
FeedDemon, you can use NetNewsWire to read and organize feeds, as well as 
save them for later reference or send them via e-mail or instant messenger to 
a friend.
NetNewsWire automatically downloads podcasts and transfers them to 
Apple’s iTunes software, and you can even use NetNewsWire with iCal and 
Address Book.
 
NewsGator also makes a newsreader for the Apple iPhone, which you can 
download via the iPhone App Store. The premium version, at $1.99, ensures 
that your reading experience is ad-free.
AmphetaDesk
www.disobey.com/amphetadesk
AmphetaDesk is a free, open source, cross-platform newsreader that should 
satisfy the truly geeky. Its code is highly customizable, so if you care to do 
so, you can change the interface’s look and feel, as well as its functionality.
Signing up for a feed
After you select a newsreader, you can subscribe to a feed and start reading! 
This task has two steps: visiting a blog that you enjoy reading and then 
subscribing.

251
 Chapter 13: Reaching Out with RSS
Somewhere on the blog page, you might see a small orange icon, sometimes 
with the acronym RSS or XML in it. Or you might just see a small text link to 
the feed.
 
Look closely — RSS feeds can be hard to find on the page. Because you need 
to use the link only once, bloggers tend to downplay them in the design.
Alternet (www.alternet.org) offers several different RSS feeds, so you can 
choose between getting front page news stories, video stories, columns, and 
so on. Check out all the flavors at www.alternet.org/webfeeds.
When you find the RSS link or icon, click it. If you’re using a Web-based news-
reader, you might be subscribed automatically, or you might see an icon for 
subscribing using one of the most common newsreaders.
If you don’t see a link or an icon to an RSS feed, copy the URL from the 
address bar of the browser. Return to your newsreader and follow your news-
reader’s instructions for adding a new subscription.
Follow these steps to subscribe to an RSS feed in Google Reader:
 
1. Visit a blog or Web site to which you want to subscribe and locate the 
feed link or icon.
 
2. Click the link.
 
 The browser displays the feed.
 
3. Copy the URL from the address bar.
 
 You can also simply right-click the feed link or icon and select Copy Link 
Location or Copy Shortcut from the pop-up menu that appears.
 
4. In Google Reader, click the Add Subscription link in the left column.
 
 A small dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 
Figure 13-3: 
Subscribing 
to a feed 
is quick 
and easy 
in Google 
Reader.
 

252
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
 
5. Paste the URL into the box and click Add.
 
 If Google Reader finds the feed, that feed appears in the right column. If 
it doesn’t find the feed, Google Reader notifies you.
 
6. Repeat as desired!
Making the Most of RSS
You can use RSS in all sorts of ways. Industries as diverse as financial sectors 
and breaking news stories have adopted RSS because it’s so flexible and gen-
erates Web site traffic, attracting new readers from search engines and news 
aggregators. But that’s not all you can use RSS for:
 
✓ Syndicating content: In the blogosphere, syndication means that you 
publish your information on the Web so that newsreaders and other 
Web sites can display it.
 
✓ Aggregating news: Do you like other blogs that deal with similar topics 
as your own? You can use their RSS feeds to include their content on 
your Web site. You can link directly to it or, if your blog software has 
such functionality, display other blog content on your own blog.
 
✓ Replacing e-mail newsletters: Some RSS advocates make astounding 
claims that RSS will be the death of e-mail. Although this dire prediction 
hasn’t yet come to pass, RSS definitely has many advantages over e-mail 
newsletters. The most important is that you can avoid spam. How? You 
can simply choose to read an RSS feed, rather than receive more e-mail; 
by not giving away your e-mail address, you don’t put it at risk for being 
sold to a spammer.
 
✓ Keeping communities updated: RSS feeds are terrific for keeping people 
updated. Some feeds merely post information, such as sports scores — 
as fast as a goal is scored, an RSS feed can be updated. Here are a few 
of the kinds of things you can share that people might want to know as 
soon as possible:
 
• Security bulletins
 
• Classified listings for apartments
 
• Emergency weather changes
 
• Changes to bids on eBay or Amazon
 
• Product availability at retail stores
Because of the simplicity of using RSS technology (yes, the actual building of 
RSS feeds might still be too geeky for most bloggers), you can use it in many 
ways to augment the communication channels of your blog or within your 
community that you haven’t quite figured out yet. Get creative!

W
hile I was watching a well-known sitcom on TV the other day, a char-
acter mentioned Twitter. If that’s not mainstream, I don’t know what 
is! But just because Hollywood knows about Twitter doesn’t mean that you 
don’t have questions, so this chapter gets down to brass tacks.
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is a free social network used for micro blogging, 
which is essentially blogging, but in very short updates. How short? Well, 
on Twitter, your posts are limited to 140 characters — barely enough for a 
couple of sentences. (I introduce micro blogging in Chapter 6.) If you use 
Facebook, you may be surprised to know that you’re already familiar with 
micro blogging.
Although you can post only up to 140 characters of text at a time on Twitter, 
you can use it to share photographs and links, even videos. Many businesses 
have jumped onto the Twitter bandwagon and use the tool to tell their cus-
tomers about sales, specials, and other news.
 
If this chapter whets your appetite for even more Twitter tidbits, be sure to check 
out Twitter For Dummies, by Laura Fitton, Michael Gruen, and Leslie Poston.
Understanding Twitter
Twitter started in 2006 and grew slowly into the phenomenon it is today. It’s 
fundamentally difficult to explain both its popularity and its purpose; as with 

254
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
blogs themselves, some very logical and common-sense questions jump to 
mind for most people:
 
✓ Who’s going to read this stuff, anyway?
 
✓ What am I supposed to talk about on Twitter?
 
✓ Why do people use Twitter?
 
✓ Isn’t Twitter a huge waste of time?
 
✓ Just how do the creators of Twitter make money?
And in the case of people who already have a blog, the big question is, “Do I 
really need Twitter, as well?”
I hope you can forgive my answer to these questions: It’s up to you! People 
are using Twitter for all kinds of reasons — I’ve seen Twitter accounts 
devoted to spiritual guidance, sports, sex, marketing, Web development, 
and diaries. You name it, and someone is using Twitter to talk about it. So, 
explaining why you should use Twitter, and what you might get out of it, is 
pretty hard to do!
For example, food blogger Degan Beley has a Twitter account set up using the 
same name as her blog (Ethnic Eats, which is online at www.ethniceats.
ca), and uses Twitter to let her readers know short tidbits about what she’s 
doing or planning next. In Figure 14-1, you can see her Twitter profile page 
(www.twitter.com/ethniceats).
Degan also displays her Twitter updates on her blog, ensuring that the audi-
ences for both her main blog and Twitter micro blog know what’s going on 
in each place. The goal of having both a blog and a Twitter account is pretty 
simple: Get more readers by producing different kinds of content in different 
Web formats.
For most Twitter users, the first goal is communication, quickly followed 
by reaching out to more people in a format that they can use easily (and for 
free), which reaches people very quickly.
Here are just a few ways in which individuals and businesses are putting 
Twitter to work:
 
✓ Restaurants: Advertise specials, let customers know about available 
tables, and offer coupons.
 
✓ Pundits: Post links and resources to support their viewpoints.

255
 Chapter 14: Joining the Twitterverse
 
✓ Friends: Coordinate get-togethers and even arrange dates.
 
✓ Conference organizers: Remind potential attendees of sign-up deadlines 
and early-bird pricing specials.
 
✓ Conference attendees: Let other attendees know about good speakers 
(and snacks) and keep those who aren’t attending up to date.
 
✓ Celebrities: Extend their personal brand and identity by talking about 
their projects.
 
✓ Characters from popular television shows: Carry on dialogue with view-
ers between episodes — written by the show’s writers, actors, or mar-
keting folks.
 
✓ Political candidates: Update voters about their policies and appearances.
 
✓ Emergency services: Update followers about operations. In 2009, the 
Australian County Fire Authority used Twitter to send out alerts and 
updates about the Black Saturday bushfires that killed 173 people and 
injured more than 400.

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
Twitter updates have a lot of potential to inform and entertain. To get a sense 
of the mechanics of using Twitter, follow these basic steps:
 
1. Sign up for a Twitter account and choose a nickname.
 
 When you set up your account, you can choose to share your updates — 
called tweets — with anyone (meaning the public) or to restrict access 
to only the people you choose to follow.
 
2. Customize your icon and profile page to make it reflect your personal-
ity or brand.
 
3. Run your contact list through Twitter to see if any of your friends, 
family, and colleagues are on Twitter.
 
 If any of them are on Twitter, decide whether you want to follow their 
updates.
 
4. Post updates.
 
 You can tweet about anything, from news about your plans, your 
thoughts, or activities.
 
 People who follow you on Twitter see your updates. On the Web, 
updates appear right when you post them to Twitter. Followers who 
have their phones configured to do so get your updates as text mes-
sages and can respond to them by sending a text message to a number 
provided by Twitter.
Following people on Twitter is equivalent to making them into a friend or con-
tact on other social networks; Twitter simply calls those folks that read your 
updates followers. Like with other social networks, the number of followers 
you have indicates your popularity, and a lot of people really focus on getting 
those numbers high.
The really neat thing about Twitter is that you can participate without ever 
visiting the Twitter Web site. Twitter’s designed so that you can handle the 
whole thing by mobile phone text messaging, keeping you updated with a 
device that you probably already have close to hand.
Getting Started
I’m a big fan of learning by doing, so in the following sections, I walk you 
through signing up for Twitter and getting started. I get the easy job — 
getting you started with Twitter. You have the hard job of figuring out what 
to tweet about!

257
 Chapter 14: Joining the Twitterverse
Signing up for an account
Follow these steps to set up a Twitter account:
 
1. Point your Web browser to www.twitter.com.
 
 The Twitter home page opens.
 
2. Click the Sign Up Now button on the home page.
 
 Twitter loads the Create an Account page.
 
3. Enter your first and last name in the Full Name field.
 
 You’re limited to 20 characters in this field.
 
4. Choose a Twitter username and type it in the Username field.
 
 Unlike some social networks, you can change your username later.
 
 Your username is limited to 15 characters, and while you type in your 
desired username, Twitter checks to see whether it’s available. If you 
don’t get a green OK message (see Figure 14-2), try again until you find 
an available username.
 
Figure 14-2: 
You can 
sign up 
for Twitter 
quickly (and 
for free).
 
 
5. Type a password that you can remember in the Password field.
 
 A status message indicates whether your password meets the Twitter 
requirements and is likely to be secure.
 
6. Type your e-mail address in the Email field.
 
 Select the checkbox below the Email text box if you want to subscribe to 
the Twitter e-mail newsletter.

258
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
 
7. Type the words shown in the visual CAPTCHA area.
 
 This feature is designed to ensure that only real people (not automated 
software) can sign up for accounts.
 
8. Click Create My Account.
 
 Twitter creates your new account and loads the Find People You Know 
on Twitter page. You also receive an e-mail that contains your new 
account information at the address you used to sign up.
Finding friends to follow
After you set up your account, you can let Twitter help you find friends, 
family, and colleagues who are also Twitter users by giving the service 
access to your contact lists in Gmail, Yahoo!, or AOL. If you don’t have con-
tact lists with any of these tools, click the Skip This Step link at the bottom of 
this screen.
To let Twitter access your contact list in an online e-mail tool and find people 
to follow, just follow these steps:
 
1. On the Find People You Know page, click the name of the service that 
you use to keep track of your contacts, such as Gmail.
 
 Twitter loads a login information screen.
 
2. Provide your login information for the service to which you want to 
give Twitter access, such as your e-mail address and password.
 
 Twitter doesn’t keep this information; you’re granting the company only 
one-time access to your contact list.
 
3. Click Continue.
 
 Twitter connects to the service and loads your contact informa-
tion, matching the e-mail addresses from your list against the e-mail 
addresses of other Twitter users.
 
 A list of your contacts who have Twitter accounts appears.
 
4. Deselect the check boxes next to the contacts whom you don’t want to 
follow on Twitter.
 
 You can always unfollow people later.
 
5. Click Continue.
 
 Twitter subscribes you to your contacts’ updates and loads the Why Not 
Invite Some Friends page, which shows contacts in your contact list who 
don’t have Twitter accounts.

259
 Chapter 14: Joining the Twitterverse
 
6. Select the checkbox beside the name of any contact you want to invite 
to use Twitter and click Invite.
 
 Twitter e-mails your contacts and loads the Look Who Else Is Here page.
 
 Don’t invite everyone you know to use Twitter; people often perceive 
participation invitations as spam. If you’d prefer not to invite anyone, 
click the Skip This Step link at the bottom of the page.
 
7. Select anyone from the Look Who Else Is Here page whom you want to 
follow and click Finish.
 
 If you prefer not to follow any of these popular Twitter users, simply 
click Finish without selecting any of them.
 
 Twitter loads your personal home page, which displays messages from 
all the people you’re following.
 
If you’d prefer not to run your contact list through Twitter, you can easily 
search for individual users by clicking the Find People link that appears in the 
navigation area at the top of all Twitter pages and then using the search tools 
provided.
Twittering
After you sign up for a Twitter account, it’s time for the fun part — your first 
tweet! You can send a tweet pretty darn easily from the Web site. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Point your browser to www.twitter.com and log in to Twitter if you 
aren’t already logged in.
 
 Twitter loads your personal home page, which displays messages from 
all the people you’re following.
 
2. Type your tweet into the What Are You Doing field at the top of the page.
 
 While you type, watch the number at the top-right of the field; it tells 
you the number of characters still available.
 
3. Click Update (see Figure 14-3).
 
 Twitter posts your tweet into your message stream, where your followers 
can read and respond to it. If any of them subscribe to your updates 
with their phones, they receive a text message that contains your tweet.

260
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
 
Figure 14-3: 
You can 
post a tweet 
on Twitter 
very quickly.
 
Posting a tweet is just the beginning. Other kinds of messages include the 
following:
 
✓ @ messages: When you want to direct a message to a specific person, 
but still include it in your main message stream (which means all your 
followers, and possibly the public, can see it), start your message with 
the @ symbol followed by the username of the person. For example
@b4dbook i’m reading your chapter on Twitter right now!
 
 To view these messages quickly, click the @username link in the right 
navigation of your Twitter page, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
✓ Direct messages: You send direct messages to only a specific Twitter 
user, and they don’t appear in the general message stream. To send 
a direct message, visit the user’s profile page and choose Message 
Username from the right navigation. Or preface your message in the 
What Are You Doing field with a d and the username. For example
d hopstudios thanks!
 
 Be careful sending direct messages — you can too easily post things 
publicly that you meant to be private!
 
✓ Retweets: Do you see a tweet in your stream that you want to rebroad-
cast to all your followers? That’s called retweeting, and you simply have 

261
 Chapter 14: Joining the Twitterverse
to copy the full message and paste it into the What Are You Doing field, 
prefaced by the characters RT. For example
RT @dbarefoot On a similar bent, there’s a great quote 
about creativity being something plus frequent iter -
ation. Anybody know it?
 
 It’s considered good form to include the username of the person you’re 
retweeting.

Exploring the Settings
You can personalize your Twitter home and profile pages in a lot of ways, 
and of course, you can also update your account information, change your 
username and password, and so on. You can make all these changes on the 
Setting page, which you access by clicking the Settings link on the top-right of 
any Twitter page. The Settings page includes the following areas:
 
✓ Account settings: Change the e-mail address at which Twitter contacts 
you and your username. You can also customize the following:
 
• Time Zone: Make sure Twitter knows your time zone.
 
• More Info URL: Your profile displays this URL, so you can send 
people to your home page quickly.
 
• One Line Bio: Give people a little bit of background about who you 
are.
 
• Location: Specify your geographic location to let followers know 
more about you.
 
• Protect My Tweets: Change this setting if you want to close your 
tweets down from public view.

✓ Password: Change your password. You need to know your current pass-
word in order to change it.
 
✓ Devices: Set up your phone to receive tweets from Twitter. I cover this 
setup fully in the following section.
 
✓ Notices: Decide whether you want to receive e-mail messages when you 
get a new follower, receive a direct message, or subscribe to the Twitter 
e-mail newsletter.
 
✓ Picture: Customize your Twitter icon by uploading a photo or other 
graphic. Businesses often choose to display a logo as their icon.
 
✓ Design: Select a new theme for the look and feel of your Twitter pages, 
upload your own custom background image, or even change the back-
ground, text, and link colors.
Twittering with Your Mobile Phone
Twitter is intended for use with your mobile phone, either by receiving and 
sending tweets as text messages or by using one of the device-specific pieces 
of software that interface with Twitter.
Tweeting from your phone
When you want to use your mobile phone to tweet, you first need to let 
Twitter know about your phone by setting it up on the Settings page. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Point your Web browser to www.twitter.com, sign in if you need to, 
and click the Settings link in the top-right of the page.
 
 The Settings page loads.
 
2. Select the Mobile tab from the Settings menu at the top of the page.
 
3. Fill in your mobile phone number and select the checkbox labeled It’s 
Okay for Twitter to Send Txt Messages to My Phone. Then, click Save.
 
4. Click OK on the notification drop-down menu that Twitter displays, 
offering information about texting rates.
 
 Remember, depending on your mobile phone plan, it may cost money 
for you to receive and/or send text messages on your phone. Check with 
your service provider to see what is and isn’t included in your plan! 
If you don’t have an unlimited text message plan, be sparing with the 
number of Twitter feeds sent to your phone.
 
 Twitter displays a confirmation code and phone number.

263
 Chapter 14: Joining the Twitterverse
 
5. From your phone, send a text message to the number provided, making 
the text of the message the confirmation code on the Twitter site.
 
 If you send this text correctly, you receive a text message from Twitter, 
confirming that you’ve signed up.
 
6. Refresh the devices page on the Twitter Web site and customize what 
kinds of text messages you want and the hours you want to receive them.
From this point on, you can post tweets from your phone. Simply text the 
same number to which you sent your confirmation code. In the U.S., the 
number is 40404. When you send a text message to that number, the text 
message is posted as a tweet on your account, and your followers can read it.
Receiving selected tweets on your phone
You can request to receive the tweets of people you’re following as text mes-
sages. I recommend you be selective about this option! For example, I follow 
several hundred people by using Twitter, but I want to hear from only a hand-
ful of friends and family at the moment they tweet and as a text message.
To get someone’s tweets on your phone, follow these steps:
 
1. Point your Web browser to www.twitter.com and sign in, if you 
need to.
 
 Twitter loads your personal home page.
 
2. Click the Following link in the right navigation area.
 
 Twitter displays a list of all the users you’re following on Twitter.
 
3. Find a user whose tweets you want to receive as text messages and 
click the tiny phone icon to the right of his or her information.
 
 The icon turns green — you’ve just turned on text message updates 
from that user.
 
 To turn off text message updates, repeat these steps, but click the green 
icons.
Tying Your Blog into Twitter
Some bloggers have set up a system that automatically tweets about their 
blog posts. If you might want to use this system, I suggest you explore 
Twitterfeed (www.twitterfeed.com).

264
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
Setting up such a system is pretty simple, really. If your blog has an RSS feed 
(see Chapter 13), you simply point Twitterfeed at both the feed and your 
Twitter account, and whenever you post a new blog update, a tweet contain-
ing the blog post title and URL is added to your Twitter feed.
 
Tweeting about your blog posts can really help to drive traffic to your blog, 
but some users find the impersonality of this kind of message irritating. Be 
aware of what you audience is looking for if you decide to go this route.
 
You can also display your tweets on your blog by using the Twitter Widget. I 
cover how to use this widget in Chapter 20.

Chapter 15
Diving in to Social Networking
In This Chapter
▶ Adding value to your blogging efforts by sharing and networking
▶ Getting to know popular social-networking Web sites
E
ver Facebooked? Done any tweeting lately? What about endorsing some-
one on LinkedIn? Is this all gibberish to you? Welcome to the world of 
social networking, the hottest topic online in the last few years.
At first glance, social networking can look overwhelming and difficult to 
understand because it uses a lot of jargon, and so many players are in the 
field. Never fear, however. Social networking is a very simple concept: You 
can meet others online by using an online Web site or service. At the very 
heart of it, social networking is the simple process of finding people you want 
to hang out with, or connecting online with people you already hang out with.
The Web has opened the door to meeting people who share your interests, 
but whom geography or professional careers — to name just a couple of 
possibilities — made it unlikely you would ever meet in “real” life. Social-
networking Web sites are designed to bring together people who share 
hobbies, careers, friends, geographic regions, and other interests, and then 
encourage communication and sharing. And believe me, social-networking 
sites exist for everything under the sun!
In this chapter, I introduce you to some of the most popular social-networking 
tools being used today and show you how they can tie into your blogging 
efforts.
Thinking Strategically
Social networks allow you to connect with current friends and make new 
ones while sharing photos, videos, text, and more. They’ve exploded in 

266
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
popularity in the last few years, and many social networks have even added 
blogging tools. From MySpace to Facebook, these tools are proliferating, and 
their quality is improving. Social networking can build:
 
✓ Friendships: You can form long-lasting bonds with people you meet 
online. By building your social network, you inevitably find others who 
share your interests.
 
✓ Communities: Connecting with other people is one of the greatest ways 
to improve your blogging experience. Other bloggers are using social 
networks to connect with those who share their interests and passions.
 
✓ Audience: Bring more eyeballs to your blog. The fact that these eyeballs 
belong to folks you already have things in common with — well, that’s 
just a bonus!
 
In general, social networks that have blogging tools are good for, well, social 
networking. If you’re starting a business or professional blog, these blogging 
tools are probably too unprofessional and may appear amateurish — unless 
you’re trying to appeal to a very young, hip audience.
Many blogs include a feature on each post that allows you to share the post 
and a link to it on many social networks. You can add this feature to your 
own blog if your blog software has these tools built in, or by implementing 
the ShareThis service (www.sharethis.com). I cover ShareThis in detail in 
Chapter 20.
Because this book talks about blogging, I focus mainly on how social net-
works can benefit your blog. You may forget that, sometimes, you also need 
to select social networks that work for you, overall. The following sections 
give you some tips on choosing a network or networks.
Connecting with your audience
The key is to know your audience and to choose what information to share. 
The more information you share among the social networks you use, the 
more attention you can bring to your blog. You must take the time to identify 
your audience and choose networks where that audience is active. Be sure 
that the social networks where you spend time are those that likely can repay 
that effort.
You can tie your blog and your social networks together, letting blog readers 
know about your actions on social networks and vice versa. The payoff? 
More readers and, hopefully, more readers from the audience that you’re 
trying to attract.

267
 Chapter 15: Diving in to Social Networking
Essentially, if you participate in a social-networking site that has something 
to do with the topic of your blog, the friends you make on that network natu-
rally fit into your target audience. And the readers of your blog are also likely 
to want to join your social network, bringing along with them their groups 
of friends, family, and colleagues, who may in turn be interested in what you 
blog about. That’s the idea, anyway!
These sites can attract huge audiences, and you greatly increase your ability 
to filter content through to groups who are most interested in what you have 
to say on your blog. The friends and contacts you make through social net-
works may very well be hungry for good blogs to read.
Selecting networks
Integrating social networks into your online activities and your blog does 
require some planning. With so many options, how do you determine which 
networks to spend time in? You could just dive in and sign up for a bunch 
of social networks, then see where the chips fall, but if you want your time 
spent using social networks to pay off, consider the following questions:
 
✓ What do you want to accomplish with your online efforts?
 
✓ What networks does your current readership use? What about your 
friends and family?
 
 If you’re unsure what networks you have to choose from, the section 
“Getting Familiar with Social Networks,” later in this chapter, introduces 
you to a variety of popular networks.
 
✓ Which networks have the coolest designs and best functionalities?
 
✓ How active is your audience on social networks? What do they seem to 
be getting out of that interaction?
 
✓ Is your blog content subject-appropriate for any particular social networks? 
On the flip side, is your blog inappropriate for any of them?
 
✓ Does your audience want to know about you in ways that a social-
networking tool might fulfill?
 
✓ How much time do you want to spend playing around with social 
networks?
You need to consider these types of questions when you’re looking to fit a 
social network into your blogging life. Take a look at where your readers are 
coming from and, using the analytics information that you should be collect-
ing for your blog (see Chapter 16), find out what attracts visitors to your site. 

268
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
Post a question on your blog about a social-networking Web site, and solicit 
responses and advice.
The social-networking online realm is a bit of a Wild West scenario: 
Everyone’s experimenting to find out what works and what doesn’t. So, jump 
in the saddle, pardner!
Protecting your privacy online
You may worry about the security of your identity online if you’re jumping 
headlong into the social-networking world.
 
Be smart. Don’t post information on any social-networking Web site that you 
feel is inappropriate. You want to keep certain bits of information private. If 
a social-networking Web site asks you to provide information that you’re not 
comfortable sharing, don’t share it. If the Web site insists you share that infor-
mation, don’t use that service. It’s as simple as that.
If you’re at all concerned about your security online, make sure you check 
regularly with your bank and any credit card company you deal with. Some 
financial institutions are taking new and additional precautions to make sure 
that your security and identity remain private.
 
Social networks often feel safer than the Internet at large because they require 
membership and logins, and of course, profiles of your new friends often 
include photos and other elements that look convincingly real. However, 
remember that these sites offer very little barrier to creating an account — 
the accounts are free, the services don’t require identity verification, and the 
social networks can’t prevent people from including misleading information or 
outright lying about who they are.
So, remain vigilant. If you’re aware of what information you place online, you 
should be able to protect yourself without much of a concern. Just like writ-
ing on your blog, consider using this guideline: If you wouldn’t blog it, don’t 
social network it.
Getting Familiar with Social Networks
Almost any interest group and almost any method of sharing has a social net-
work. Deciding which ones to try out depends on what you want to get out 
of the social networking. If you’re a photographer, social Web sites such as 
Flickr (which allows you to share photos) may be your cup of tea. If you like 
to read books and talk about them, LibraryThing and Goodreads may be the 
places to hang out.

269
 Chapter 15: Diving in to Social Networking
In the following sections, I show you some of the most popular (and some of 
my favorites) so that you can get familiar with social-networking sites and 
decide where to get started.
 
You can find many more sites that I don’t have the space to cover in this book, 
so make this chapter a starting point while you explore social networks.
Friend-based networks
Social networks are never really all that general, but the most popular social 
networks allow their users to share almost anything, from photos to friends 
to games. Social networks such as Facebook simply try to throw everything 
and the kitchen sink into the mix; others, such as Twitter, go with a more 
minimal approach.
Here are a few all-purpose social networks:
 
✓ Facebook (www.facebook.com): Facebook is one of the most popular 
social-networking platforms and boasts a user base of over 300 mil-
lion — and that number gets bigger every day. Started in 2004 by Mark 
Zuckerberg, Facebook was initially intended to be a communication tool 
for university students but quickly grew beyond that audience.
 
 The service allows users to share photos, audio, and video; install 
apps, such as games and horoscopes; and friend others. Friending is the 
method of identifying people you want in your network. On most social 
networks, Facebook included, friends are entitled to see more of your 
shared information than other members of the network.
 
 For more information about Facebook security settings, why not 
check out Facebook For Dummies written by Carolyn Abram and Leah 
Pearlman.
 
 Not surprisingly, you can also post messages and short status updates, 
and you can set up your profile to let others know when you post to 
your blog. You can install widgets on your blog that automatically post a 
Facebook update when you create a new post (see Figure 15-1).
 
✓ MySpace (www.myspace.com): At its height, MySpace was the king of 
the hill in terms of social-networking Web sites. It’s currently ranked in 
second place overall, which (given the number of users that place rep-
resents) is nothing to sneeze at. MySpace is targeted to people who are 
friends or share interests, and it’s an especially popular way for musi-
cians and other performers to make connections with listeners.

270
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
 
 Most interestingly, MySpace includes an integrated blogging tool, so you 
don’t need to tie your blog and social network together; they’re already 
in the same network, which makes promotion pretty darn easy.
 
 Like with Facebook, you can have fun on MySpace by finding friends 
who are also active on the site, and then sharing information with them.
 
✓ Twitter (www.twitter.com): Micro blogging is all the rage on today’s 
World Wide Web, particularly as mobile-phone technology has really 
taken off in North America. Twitter is a micro-blogging tool that allows 
you to post small bursts of text, called tweets, about your plans, 
thoughts, and activities. Following other people’s Twitter feeds means 
that you can stay abreast of their activities, as well. You can handle the 
whole Twitter experience by mobile phone text messaging, keeping you 
updated by using a device that you probably already have close at hand.
 
 Though you can post up to only 140 characters of text at a time, you can 
use Twitter to share photographs, links, and even videos. Many busi-
nesses have jumped onto the Twitter bandwagon and use the tool to 
let their customers know about sales, specials, and other news. I cover 
Twitter in detail in Chapter 14.

 Chapter 15: Diving in to Social Networking
Hobby-based networks
If you’re a bookworm like me, hold onto your hat. A number of social-networking 
sites are designed specifically to let you catalog your bookshelves, find cool 
books to read, and chat with other book lovers.
The same is true of music lovers; you can share your musical tastes with 
others online and get suggestions for new music that you may like. Some 
services even allow you to listen to full tracks of music, or you can listen to 
bite-sized chunks.
The fun doesn’t stop there, either. If you have a hobby that you share with 
a large enough group, you can probably find a social network out there 
designed just for you. Here are a few of my favorites:
 
✓ LibraryThing (www.librarything.com): A great Web site that allows 
you to share books that you’re reading. You can catalog your collection 
and find information about your books by using a variety of libraries, 
such as Amazon.com or the Library of Congress.
 
 The tie-in with your blog? Widgets let you share what you’re reading and 
have read with your blog visitors. 
 
 See Chapter 20 for details about connecting picks in networks like 
LibraryThing or Last.fm, discussed in an upcoming bullet, to your blog 
via widgets.
 
✓ Goodreads (www.goodreads.com): Goodreads is another social book-
cataloging Web site that allows you to build virtual bookshelves of 
books that you’ve read or want to read. You can recommend books to 
others, compare what you’re reading with others in the forums, and 
even run a book club.
 
 Some of my friends who share my taste in books find the site useful for 
choosing what to read next, by keeping track of the ratings others post 
for books they’ve read. I really like using it to keep track of the books I 
want to read next, so that I don’t have to keep all that information in my 
head. And, of course, there are widgets for your blog (not to mention for 
Facebook and MySpace).
 
✓ Last.fm (www.last.fm): Founded in 2002, Last.fm (shown in Figure 15-2) 
is a social-networking site that allows you share your musical tastes. You 
can track the music you’re listening to and share what types of music you 
enjoy with others. If you install Last.fm’s audioscrobbling widget, it records 
automatically whatever music you play on your computer, phone, or MP3 
player. It then posts this information on your profile on the Web site.

272
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
 
 Over time, you can see what music you listen to most often, and then 
the Web site and the community can make suggestions about what other 
music you may want to check out. You can tie Last.fm widgets to your 
blog so that your readers can subscribe to your music playlist and also 
be your listeners.
 
✓ Blip.fm (www.blip.fm): Blip.fm is another, and very recent, addition to 
the music social-networking realm. This tool is tied closely to Twitter, so 
users of the one social network get the benefit of the other.
 
 Blip.fm allows you to sign up, identify your friends, search the Web for 
music that you want to recommend (or just listen to), and then build a 
playlist based on the results. Do you have a friend who has impeccable 
musical taste? Get him or her signed up for Blip.fm, and then listen to 
his or her playlist. This site also allows you to give props — praise — to 
users who blip — post @md a song you like, giving feedback about what 
you want more of.
 
 You can even link your Last.fm account to Blip.fm and let your computer 
do all the work of blipping songs for you.
 
✓ Ravelry (www.ravelry.com): This chapter wouldn’t be complete 
without a mention of my favorite social network of all time, Ravelry. I 
admit, it may not be your favorite! Ravelry is a social network designed 
for knitters to share information about what they’re making or thinking 
of making, how they did it, and other such conversation. You can add 
friends and send messages, and of course, if you have a knitting blog, 
you can pull your blog posts into Ravelry and get your friends from 
Ravelry over to your blog.

 Chapter 15: Diving in to Social Networking
Professional networks
The business world has latched onto social networking, as well. Many busi-
nesses are using social-networking tools to find new clients, build more cre-
ative advertising, and create a conversation with the public. Many of them 
use the existing popular social networks, from Facebook to Twitter, but the 
big player in business-related social networking is LinkedIn.
LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) claims to have more than 45 million users, 
and it targets its service to your professional life. Looking to find a new 
employee or a new job? LinkedIn can put you in touch with others in your 
industry, recommend partners, help you locate contractors, and generally 
get the lowdown on those you work with.
One of the most useful features of LinkedIn is that your profile looks much 
like a résumé, so you can refer people you want to work with to your 
LinkedIn profile. You can also connect with past and present colleagues, and 
make use of their network so that you can make connections with people 
they interact with. The business world can become a surprisingly small 
place, thanks to these connections. In fact, I used LinkedIn to make contact 
with many of the businesses that I discuss in this book by putting my own 
network to use.
Media-sharing networks
The Web has allowed all of us to share more than just text — you can easily 
display video, audio, and photos online, and a number of social-networking 
sites let you do just that, regardless of whether you have a Web site or blog. 
Here are the big hitters:
 
✓ Flickr (www.flickr.com): Flickr is one of the most successful social 
networks going. Flickr allows you to post and store your photographs — 
and recently, videos — online. You can share these photos and videos 
with the community at large, as well as your friends and family. Viewers 
can mark each photo as a favorite, and they can also leave comments 
and feedback for you.
 
 You can use Flickr to build albums and galleries of your photos, and 
even slideshows. Best of all, you can place your photos online with 
Flickr, and then quickly and easily embed those photos into your blog 
posts (see Chapter 10).

274
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
 
✓ YouTube (www.youtube.com): For those video bloggers out there, 
YouTube is probably the most popular social-networking video plat-
form online today. People from all over the world record, edit, and post 
videos, and then share them with the YouTube community. You can 
post these videos and also embed them into your Web site or blog.
Informational networks
Initially, social bookmarking was just an online service that allowed you to 
save all your bookmarks without worrying about whether you’d lose them. 
While social networking became more popular, social-bookmarking Web sites 
got into the act and began to offer all kinds of ways in which you can share 
your bookmarks with others or discover new and interesting Web sites to 
visit. Use these sites to organize your bookmarks, recommend Web sites, and 
Web surf:
 
✓ Delicious (www.delicious.com): Early on in the life of the Web, some-
one realized that we all spent a lot of time e-mailing each other links 
(“You have to see this; it’s hilarious!”) and that a more efficient way to 
share that kind of information probably existed. Enter Delicious.
 
 Delicious (see Figure 15-3) enables you to record and tag links for later 
retrieval. You no longer have to be at the same computer to remember 
what Web sites you’ve visited or bookmarked. You can make your book-
marks private or share them with the public. This incredibly easy-to-use 
social-bookmarking service is also incredibly powerful. You can share 
your bookmarks by using the built-in RSS feeds and by sharing your 
bookmarks with your personal network of other users.
 
 Social bookmarking is a little different than creating bookmarks of sites 
that you go to often, which you probably already do with your browser. 
I use Delicious to keep track of research around a particular topic — for 
example, looking up activities to do on my next trip to Asia.
 
✓ StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com): Many people have called 
StumbleUpon one of the biggest time wasters online today. But that’s 
not actually a bad thing. Web surfing is a time-honored way of negotiat-
ing the World Wide Web, and StumbleUpon simply acknowledges that 
fact, and then gives you some outstanding tools for more efficiently and 
intelligently surfing.
 
 With StumbleUpon, users post and recommend interesting things that 
they find on the Web, and others view those recommendations and add 
their own endorsement, effectively creating a snapshot of the most inter-
esting and compelling links on the Web. You can imagine how useful 
sharing becomes when you create a community on StumbleUpon of your 
friends and colleagues; if you combine their recommendations with the 
personalization options that StumbleUpon provides, it’s like reading a 
personalized (albeit somewhat eccentric) newspaper.

Location-based networks
A bunch of networks allow you to post your location on a map or track your 
(and your friends’) geographic whereabouts. Typically, these kind of social-
networking applications need a little forethought before you use them. Do 
you really want your colleagues to know where you are at all times? I didn’t 
think so. But these kinds of programs can help you create impromptu coffee 
meetings or figure out whether someone you want to see is nearby. Many 
location-based networks also give you information based your current loca-
tion for nearby great places to eat, shop, or visit.
 
These services are really designed for mobile phone users who have signed up 
for data plans.
Try these networks on for size:
 
✓ foursquare (www.foursquare.com): This is the newest kid on the loca-
tion block. foursquare allows you to use your phone as a GPS device — 
it tracks your location, checks you in at the places you visit, and awards 
points for everywhere you go. If you’re the most frequent visitor to a loca-
tion in a 30-day period, foursquare declares you the mayor of that 
location, and you can also earn badges. Foursquare has some handy 
apps for different types of phones as well as a mobile phone Web site 
version.

276
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
 
 Some businesses are rewarding users with freebies and recognition. 
You can link your foursquare account with your Twitter and Facebook 
updates.
 
✓ Brightkite (www.brightkite.com): Brightkite is a popular location-
based social-networking Web site. It offers applications for iPhone, 
BlackBerry, and Android mobile devices. You can rate different loca-
tions and also post your location on Twitter. A very cool section of the 
Brightkite Web site lets you build a visualization of all the Brightkite 
activity in a certain location, by keyword, or of everything going on in 
the Brightkite universe.
 
✓ Google Latitude (www.google.com/latitude): Google Latitude (see 
Figure 15-4) is another location-aware mobile application that allows you 
to share your current location and keeps track of places you’ve been. 
You can have this application automatically update with your where-
abouts, or you can manually add your check-in points. The application 
plots your updates on a Google Map for your friends to view. The appli-
cation is available for many mobile platforms, including iPhones and 
BlackBerries.

▶ Figuring out what Web statistics tell you
▶ Checking out good statistics-tracking tools

F
or a moment, picture your new blog running just the way you want it. 
The graphics are pretty, you’re blogging every day, and comments are 
rolling in. Everything looks perfect, and you seem to be well on your way to a 
successful blogging career. But wait! For no real reason, over a few weeks, the 
number of comments left on your blog each day starts to decrease. Your visi-
tor numbers are down. You don’t find an obvious explanation, and you can’t 
imagine why your readership is disappearing so quickly!
If you ever find yourself in this type of situation, you may start to ask your-
self questions such as, “How many visitors do I have every day, anyway?” or 
“How many of my visitors have been here before?”
It’s time to understand your Web traffic statistics. You, as a blogger, may find 
Web stats especially important because your audience numbers are affected 
each time you post.
You must pay attention to how your blog is performing on the Internet, but 
it can be confusing and boring. Spending an afternoon peering at Web stats, 
especially if you don’t know what you’re looking for, can be a tedious experi-
ence. It’s like . . . well, it’s like watching paint dry. But it doesn’t have to be as 
painful as it sounds. Web statistics are very geeky, but these days, you can 
choose from services available to bloggers (and Webmasters, in general) that 
allow you to track your blog’s success in interesting and informative ways by

Exploring the Power of Statistics
Even if you like the way your blog is performing, you should take a look at 
your blog stats once in a while. Some bloggers look at them daily to see what 
kinds of visitors appeared on their blogging radar overnight; some blog-
gers check their stats once a week or once a month. Whichever pattern you 
choose, keep a good handle on your statistics — knowing how many visitors 
you have can help you improve your blog in the future, making it even more 
popular.
For an example of what a typical Web-stats tool looks like, check out 
StatCounter’s measurement of the Find-A-Sweetheart Web site (www.find-
a-sweetheart.com) in Figure 16-1. (You have to be logged in if you want to 
view stats on StatCounter.)
Using Web statistics, you can track
 
✓ What countries your Web visitors are surfing from
 
✓ How long visitors stay
 
✓ How many visitors check out your site for the first time
 
✓ How many visitors have been to your blog before

✓ What pages your visitors start their visit on
 
✓ What pages visitors end their visit on
 
✓ What sites send visitors to you
 
✓ What search words visitors use to find your site
 
✓ What browsers your visitors use
 
✓ What kind of computers your visitors use to surf the Web
 
✓ What screen resolutions your visitors set their monitors to
With some of the more advanced Web analytics software, you can see what 
pages are the least popular, find out how search engines handle your blog, 
and even see what errors or missing pages your visitors get when they try to 
access parts of your site. (If you have removed an old blog post or renamed a 
posting, you will be able to tell from your statistics which pages are missing.) 
A lot of bloggers especially want to know what Web sites are sending visitors 
to their blogs so that they can figure out where to invest time and energy in 
comments and discussion forums.
 
Knowing even a little bit about your traffic can help you make all kinds of stra-
tegic decisions about your blog, from what kind of design to use to the subject 
of a post.
Blog stats become even more useful when you begin analyzing them. Web 
analytics are the trends that your statistical or log software shows you. Some 
traffic software helps break down these trends for you, but the most basic 
software simply displays the raw data about how visitors use your site and 
lets you draw the conclusions. When people talk about Web analytics, they’re 
referring to the process that you undertake when you’re looking through 
those stats and logs to figure out what visitors are doing on your Web site. 
Commonly, you look for trends about what content the visitors view, how 
often they visit, and what other sites direct traffic your way.
 
Pay close attention to your Web site logs so that you can chart what your 
users are doing over time. You can see what your site visitors are reading and 
what keeps them coming back for more. You can then use this information 
for a variety of purposes (such as deciding what to blog about). The following 
examples illustrate how gathering your blog’s statistics and interpreting them 
can be useful:
 
✓ You notice that a large bunch of readers are coming from a particu-
lar country (see Figure 16-2), and you don’t live in that country. In 
this case, you should see what pages those visitors are viewing — and 
determine why they’re coming to your site. You can then write more 
to attract additional visitors who have similar tastes. In fact, noticing a 
trend such as this one might help you really focus on a core audience 
that you didn’t even know about. You can even redefine what you do 
with your blog in the future.

tors live by

✓ You have ads on your blog (see Chapter 17), and more people are 
clicking a certain type of advertisement. If you take the time, you can 
see what kinds of visitors are clicking advertisements on your site (if 
you have any ads, of course). You can use information about what ads 
your visitors click to sell ad space to certain advertisers.
 
You may have trouble staying away from your blog’s Web stats, and you might 
want to check them daily. But don’t forget that you have a blog to run, which 
requires that you focus on the quality of the content you produce for your 
community. Try to avoid an obsession over your Web statistics because no 
amount of tinkering with Web analytics can make your blog popular. Your con-
tent is the only thing that can accomplish that feat.
Knowing What the Statistics Mean
To understand what you’re looking at when you scan your Web statistics or 
server logs, you need to know a series of terms. Most Web analytics software 
use these terms, but you should always check to see how the software’s 
creators define measurements — Web analytics software tends to use these 
terms in the same way, but not always. I cover the most vital terms in the fol-
lowing sections.

281
 Chapter 16: Measuring Blog Presence
 
You’ll run into more terms than the ones I cover in this chapter, but the most 
important ones for bloggers are page views, unique visitors, and repeat visitors. 
Together, these three statistics give you the most accurate picture of how 
many visitors your blog receives and what they do while they visit.
I also introduce you to what the term hits means, which new bloggers often 
find misleading, and how statistics can help you resolve errors on your blog.
Hits
A hit is an official request from a Web browser for a file from the Web server. 
The file can be an HTML file or a movie file. Essentially, accessing any file 
available on a Web server to the surfing public counts as a hit.
 
Any given Web page causes multiple hits on the server when it loads, even 
though it’s only one page. Multiple files are actually called to display the page: 
the HTML file, any associated style documents, and all the image files. If an 
HTML file has five images, it counts as six hits — one for the HTML file and 
five for each individual image.
A lot of people think that hits indicate the number of Web site visitors or 
even the number of pages viewed, but hits don’t even come close to mea-
suring those kinds of figures. Hits are pretty meaningless if you’re trying to 
understand how many visitors you have, but they can help you get a feel for 
the traffic load that your site puts on the Web server.
Page views
A page view is normally defined as a page within a Web server log; if the 
Web browser requests an HTML file, the log records that as a single request, 
even if the server needs several files to display the page. Each time the Web 
browser loads a page of your site, it counts as a page view. Page views are a 
valuable measurement because you can get a better understanding of how 
people actually use your site.
In Figure 16-3, you can see the page views for September 30, 2009.
 
Advertisers are often very interested in the number of page views on a Web 
site (more is better), and most bloggers consider a high page-view number 
something to brag about.

282

StatCounter

given day.
 
Unique visitors
Unique visitors are just what they sound like — individual visitors who come 
to your Web site. The analytics software counts them only once, no matter 
how many pages they view or how many times they visit. When you’re look-
ing at the number of unique visitors your blog gets, take a look at what time 
period the analytics software refers to. Fifty unique visitors in one day, for 
example, is a much bigger deal than 50 unique visitors in a month.
Repeat visitors
Repeat visitors are blog readers who visit your site on more than one occa-
sion and, usually, visit multiple pages. Pay attention, just as with unique visi-
tors, to the time period this repeat-visitor number covers.
In Figure 16-4, you can see a graph that breaks down the percentages of first-
time visitors to repeat visitors on the Web statistics tool StatCounter.

your traffic 
is new and

visits.
 
Errors
Most stat software tracks errors, instances when your visitors get an actual 
error message when they try to do something on your site or when they try 
to view a page that doesn’t exist anymore (or never did).
 
Track your error logs to find out where visitors are having problems — and be 
sure to fix the errors.
A lack of standards
Currently, no official standards govern the 
world of server logs and Web statistics. No 
large corporations tell anyone how to do cap-
ture their traffic numbers, what terminology to 
use, or how to analyze the statistics. The world 
of Web stats has, more or less, grown organi-
cally, and a set of rules around the analysis of 
server logs has emerged from the community.
The various software tools have a lot of incon-
sistency in what and how they measure statis-
tics. As a result, I commonly use two different 
programs to measure unique visitors on my own 
blog, and the two software programs rarely 
agree about what that number is. It’s a frustrat-
ing fact of life. (Between you and me, I tend to 
use the bigger number.)

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
Getting Web Stats
You can find many statistics software applications that track Web traffic 
available for installation on your blog. But before you get too carried away, 
check to see whether your blog host offers Web traffic–tracking software or 
gives you access to your server logs.
 
If your Web host offers stats software, be sure to review the offering carefully. You 
might not need any additional tools, or you might want to supplement the prein-
stalled tool with one of those discussed in the following sections, if only to check 
the accuracy of the numbers you’re seeing. Keep in mind that different applications 
can measure statistics differently, so the numbers may not be exactly the same.
 
Some bloggers like to look at the server logs for their sites. Server logs are 
simple text files that Web servers generate in order to keep track of informa-
tion about who visits a Web server, when, using what kind of browser, when 
errors occur, and so on.
Most Web hosts provide access to stat software and server logs through an 
administrative control panel.
In the following sections, I cover the different services and software available. 
You should be able to find a service that fits your Web-stat needs.
Choosing hosted statistics software
Like hosted blog software, the company that creates the hosted Web statis-
tics software package also manages that software. Typically, you install the 
software by adding a chunk of HTML code to your pages, which communi-
cates with the hosted software.
Because you must be able to place some HTML code into your blog software 
templates so that it appears on every page that you want to track, blog soft-
ware that doesn’t give you the ability to add code will rule out using a hosted 
statistics solution.
Knowing about this inconsistency, you might 
want to consider using at least a couple of Web 
statistics tools (I talk about the options in the 
section “Getting Web Stats,” in this chapter) 
and comparing the results that you get. Different 
Web analytics software treat server logs dif-
ferently, and some software is certainly better 
than others. Most often, users prefer packages 
that create charts and graphs, which represent 
their data visually, making the numbers easier to 
understand quickly. Because no hard and fast 
rules exist, you’re free to do research into what 
packages can work best for you.

 Chapter 16: Measuring Blog Presence
Google Analytics
www.google.com/analytics
In 2005, Google purchased a software package known as Urchin, created by a 
Web statistics company. Google has since released Urchin as the online stats 
system Google Analytics.
Google Analytics has a great interface with many options that you can cus-
tomize and use to analyze stats to your heart’s content. Google Analytics can 
calculate how many page views and number of visits your blog or site has 
received. The Google Analytics system (shown in Figure 16-5) is free, but it 
requires a registered Google Account (which is free, as well). 
StatCounter
www.statcounter.com
StatCounter is a free hosted statistics tracker, and new users can figure it out 
easily, thanks to good organization and explanation in the control panel.
 
Figure 16-5: 
Use Google 
Analytics 
to check 
out where

site’s traffic

286
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
After setting up your site in StatCounter, you must insert StatCounter HTML 
code into your blog templates so that it can track every page. StatCounter mea-
sures page views and hits, of course, but also what terms your readers use in 
search engines to a Google Maps interface of where your traffic originates.
Site Meter
www.sitemeter.com
Site Meter has been around since the beginning of stat tracking on the Web. 
This tool provides you with basic details about each visitor who comes to 
your blog and shows you what the visitor does while he or she is there, even 
down to what page he or she is on before leaving.
Site Meter (see Figure 16-6) has two levels of service: the free Basic edition 
and the Premium edition. The Premium edition provides more information 
than the Basic setup and grants access to a longer history of your statistics, 
but the free edition is a good starting point for new bloggers. The profes-
sional edition starts at $6.95 a month.

287
 Chapter 16: Measuring Blog Presence
Choosing installable statistics software
Web analytics software that you can install on your Web server and manage 
on your own is called installable software. If you want to use a specific analyt-
ics package that your Web host doesn’t normally provide, look into whether 
you can install software on your server. Some hosts can give you suggestions 
and may even assist you when you install analytics software.
Installed software usually measures the same metrics as hosted statistics 
software, but it does so by analyzing log files stored on your Web site, rather 
than gathering information when a visitor hits your site. Some Web develop-
ers feel that installed software therefore provides more accurate numbers 
than hosted software, but many Web developers and bloggers hotly debate 
that opinion.
When you sign up for a Web-hosting package, the Web host probably has 
some kind of Web statistics available to you. These packages can range from 
open source software to custom, home-grown solutions.
 
Be sure to check the technical requirements for the package that you want to 
install to be sure that your server works with it.
The Webalizer
www.mrunix.net/webalizer
The Webalizer is an open source application that you install on your server. 
Because it’s free to use, many Web hosts offer it as part of their standard 
Web hosting packages. Originally created in 1997, the Webalizer lets you 
track hits, page views, geographical origin of your traffic, and other data.
The Webalizer generates easy-to-read pages that show traffic to your site 
broken down by month, but you can also see traffic figures by day and even 
by hour. It offers all the usual suspects, from page views to unique visitors to 
the top referring sites.
AWStats
http://awstats.sourceforge.net
AWStats is a popular Web statistics analyzer that you can install on your Web 
server. Its features enable you to track not only visitors, but also streaming 
media, e-mail, and FTP transactions on your server. AWStats requires that 
you have the Perl programming language installed on your Web server to 
operate. (Most Web servers support this requirement.)

288
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
AWStats generates graphs and other visual indicators about the activity of 
your visitors month by month, letting you see the region and cities where 
traffic originates, as well as the operating systems and browsers that your 
visitors use, among many other measurements.
Mint
www.haveamint.com
Mint, which began in 2004 as a basic Web site tracking tool, has matured into 
a great service. Mint’s installable software offers the usual suspects: new and 
returning visitors, the sites from which they get to your site, search terms 
that they use to find you, and so on. Mint also looks really cool: It produces 
fun graphs and charts.
A Mint license costs $30 per site.
Finding Out What Others Are Saying
With Web analytics software, you can watch the behavior of your site’s visi-
tors but you can also find out a lot by monitoring mentions of you, your blog, 
and your topic on the Web (especially on your competitor’s blogs!) on other 
Web sites. Watching what’s going on within the blogosphere is a huge task. 
You could spend hundreds of dollars to have others do it for you, or you 
could check out some of the simple tools available on the Web.
Among the simple blogosphere tools available to you are the following:
 
✓ E-mail notifications: Receive updates via e-mail about content or topics 
that you want to keep up with.
 
✓ RSS watch lists: Keep current on topics by using your favorite news-
reader software. (Read more about RSS in Chapter 13.)
You can use these tools in a variety of ways by doing random manual 
searches and installing software designed to display Web information on 
your desktop.
 
The power of RSS and the syndication of news and blog feeds become appar-
ent when you start trying to monitor certain phrases and keywords. RSS is one 
of the best ways to track what people are saying about your blog and about 
topics that you’re interested in.

289
 Chapter 16: Measuring Blog Presence
Google Alerts
www.google.com/alerts
Google Alerts (see Figure 16-7) provides you with e-mail notifications that it 
sends to you based on keyword searches of Google’s search system. Sign up 
for an account, and then create an alert by entering keywords about which 
you want Google Alerts to notify you.
In order to receive any e-mail from the Google Alerts system, you need to 
enter some keywords. Follow these steps:
 
1. Go to www.google.com/alerts.
 
2. Enter the keywords that you want to be notified about in the Search 
Terms text box.
 
3. Select the type of Web content that you want included in your search 
from the Type drop-down list.
 
 Your options are News, Blogs, Web, Comprehensive, Video, and Groups.
 
4. Select how often you want to be notified from the How Often drop-
down list.
 
 You can select As-It-Happens, Once a Day, or Once a Week.
 
5. Type your e-mail address into the Your Email field.
 
6. Click Create Alert.
 
 Google begins to track your search and sends you the e-mails that you 
requested at the rate you want them.
When a keyword gets a hit, you get an e-mail that includes a link to the Web 
page. Google Alerts can do automatic keyword searches for all kinds of Web 
sites, including blogs.
 
Figure 16-7: 
Google 
Alerts sends 
you e-mail 
if it hits your 
keywords in 
searches.
 

290
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
These alerts work best when you create a specific and detailed search. Think 
about how you can refine your search to keep your results to a manageable 
number. For instance, if you want to track a particular news topic, use sev-
eral keywords, rather than just one. For example, use knitting sock yarn 
hand-dyed, not just socks.
 
Set Google Alerts to search for your name, your blog name, and any keywords 
that you want to be aware of. Use these alerts to find out when people are talk-
ing about you, your blog, or the topics you’re covering.
Twitter
www.twitter.com
Twitter is a social-networking service that allows you to post online messages 
known as tweets. People can then watch your tweets, and you can watch 
theirs. Your tweets can be anything from short messages, links to Web sites, 
or conversations with others. You can also use Twitter to track what people 
are talking about by searching for keywords and hashtags (Twitter users 
sometimes mark keywords in their tweets with a # to set them off and make 
it easier to search for them). You can search using the Twitter search engine 
(http://search.twitter.com). For instance, after Michael Jackson’s 
death, Twitter users posting about the pop star used the hashtag #mj. You 
can read more about Twitter in Chapter 14.
Technorati
www.technorati.com
Technorati is a search engine that focuses its energy on blogs — and does 
it very well. Technorati publishes information periodically that gives people 
who use its service a status of the blogosphere. Technorati can update you 
on the following:
 
✓ The number of blogs that are tracked
 
✓ Ongoing trends in conversations throughout a given time period
 
✓ The growth rate of blog technology adoptions
 
✓ Up-to-the minute search results from blog posts

A
dvertising on your blog has never been easier. Many different advertis-
ing systems offer bloggers a free way to place ads on their blogs, and 
businesses have picked up on the fact that blog advertising can really work. 
Putting an ad or two on your blog can help you easily earn a little money 
doing something you enjoy. Many bloggers turn a pretty penny, and some 
even earn a living, from advertising.
Ever since Web sites came into existence, you could find online advertise-
ments. From the first Web banners of the early Internet to today’s contextual 
advertising systems, ads have run the gamut from wildly successful to a 
waste of precious bandwidth.
In some cases, the effectiveness of ads has more to do with the readers than 
anything else — on the blog for some topics, blog readers willingly look at 
ads and even click them, but audiences on other blogs just don’t have the 
patience to wade through advertisements that clutter their reading pleasure. 
So, you need to know what your audience can tolerate before you make a big 
play with ads!
Turning your blog into a retirement savings plan won’t happen overnight, 
and don’t take the addition of advertisements to the average blog lightly. 
It all requires planning, patience, and faith and trust in your readership. 
Depending on your audience, you might even need to request input from 
them about the advertisements that you choose to deploy on your blog.

294
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
Finding Out How Advertising Works
Banner ads (rectangular ads usually placed along the top of a site) used 
to dominate ad slots on the Web but have become less important because 
people often just tune them out. Then, pop-up, animated, and blinking adver-
tisements generated a few clicks and ultimately managed to generate a mas-
sive backlash. Many of these moving, beeping, and blinking ads just irritated 
users, instead of successfully advertising.
Today’s contextual advertising tools are actually intelligent; ads are matched 
by subject to the words and phrases that you use on your blog. Generally, 
this approach gives you ads that better suit your readers’ interests, making 
those readers more likely to click the ads.
First, decide whether your blog is meant for an advertising campaign. Many 
blogs can benefit greatly from advertisements. However, you should think 
about a few things before diving in:
 
✓ Does your blog have a design that’s ready for ads?
 
✓ Does your blog software support the advertising system you choose?
 
✓ Will advertising earn you any money?
 
✓ Will your audience put up with ads?
Answering these questions isn’t easy; in fact, you might find it impossible 
unless you jump in — try using some advertising and observe the results.
Planning for advertising
You can use several kinds of advertising methods to turn a blog into a place 
where you can make a tidy profit. The last few years have seen an explosion 
of companies that want a piece of the action in the blogosphere, and these 
companies have come up with creative ways to make ads easy to use, simple 
to implement, and appealing to your readers.
If you’re a new blogger or just new to advertising programs, you can easily 
latch onto the first advertising system that you find and commit to using it. 
Although this system may serve your needs well, you might want to take a 

295
 Chapter 17: Making Mad Mad Money
look at some of the different ad systems available and find out about how 
advertising tends to work in the blogosphere before you start using ads.
 
While you do your research, keep in mind that if you decide to make that leap 
into monetizing your blog, you should choose software that allows you to con-
trol your advertising so that it doesn’t overwhelm the blog audience that you 
worked so hard to build.
A multitude of advertising companies offer bloggers simple solutions to 
monetize Web sites. Most of these programs work in similar ways but have 
unique delivery methods. Advertising programs range from text-only ads 
to flashy animations, and even full-page advertisements that really get your 
readers’ attention! As a blogger, choosing an advertising program that works 
for your audience can make the difference between an increase in readers 
and turning off your existing traffic.
Looking at the formats
You can deliver ads to a blog audience in four different ways. Additional 
methods are available, but most don’t work very well in a blog. The most 
popular advertisement formats for blogs are
 
✓ Text-based ads: These ads are text-only and feature a link or links to the 
advertiser’s Web site or service. Each ad is very plain, and most adver-
tising systems limit your ability to customize their look and feel.
 
✓ Graphical banner and button ads: Banner and button ads can be static 
or animated images. These ads usually have preset sizes, but you can 
customize them to fit your blog design.
 
✓ RSS ads: Ads are a new addition to RSS feeds; while the format has taken 
off with the public, advertisers have jumped on the bandwagon. Such 
ads can include text or images, and they’re linked to the advertiser’s 
Web site straight from your RSS feed. See how this kind of advertis-
ing looks when someone views the RSS feed in a newsreader, shown in 
Figure 17-1. If you want to find out more about RSS, see Chapter 13.
 
✓ Pop-up ads: Pop-ups tend to be everyone’s least favorite type of ad, 
but oddly enough, pop-up ads that open in a new window are still quite 
successful at getting people to click an advertiser’s Web site. The read-
ers might be fairly irritated by the time they get to the site, but they do 
click.

The Interactive Advertising Bureau makes recommendations each year about 
ad sizes and standards. You might find the recommendations useful in plan-
ning for ads. Visit www.iab.net/standards/adunits.asp to see the 
options.
Most ad programs today — with the exception of sponsorships — use contex-
tual advertising, which coordinates ad display with related editorial content. 
So, a blog post about skiing might include ads for ski shops and resorts. A 
blogger who posts about blogging, for example, ends up with ads for blog 
software and tools. (I speak from experience here.)
Contextual ad systems search your blog for keywords that match products 
the advertisers have in their inventory. These ads then appear beside the 
topic keywords and, in theory, apply in the context of the Web page on which 
they appear.
Contextual ads about blog polling tools appear on the left side of the Smiley 
Cat Web Design blog, as shown in Figure 17-2.

Assessing business models
Money can flow from the advertiser to the blogger in different ways. Always 
read the terms of service for an ad program because each advertising com-
pany has a different idea about how to compensate bloggers. The usual busi-
ness models for online ads are
 
✓ Cost per impression: In this model, advertisers pay for the number 
of times a computer loads a page that displays the ad. The advertiser 
might prefer that a reader click its ad, but it recognizes that simply 
appearing on a blog that users access also has value.
 
✓ Cost per click or pay per click: The blogger makes money only when a 
reader clicks an ad and goes to the advertiser’s Web site. This type of ad 
is very common in contextual ad programs, as well as on search engines 
in the sponsored results section.

298
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
 
✓ Cost per action: The advertiser pays only when the reader actually takes 
action after he or she views and clicks the ad on the blog. This required 
action can include anything from signing up to receive more information 
to actually purchasing a product.
 
✓ Sponsorships: When an advertiser wants to be actively associated with 
the content of your blog, it might offer to sponsor the blog or some part 
of the blog. A sponsorship usually includes premium advertisements 
and exclusive ad placement, and the blogger sometimes even thanks the 
sponsor in the editorial content of the site. See “Seeing Sponsorships” 
later in this chapter.
 
A lot of bloggers have had the same great idea about the ads on their blogs: 
“I’ll just click these myself and send my cost-per-click rates through the roof! 
I’ll make millions!” Unfortunately, the advertising companies have figured out 
this little scheme, and they refer to it as click fraud. Advertisers spend good 
money to have their ads displayed, and companies that run advertisement 
programs go out of their way to make sure that clicks on those ads are good 
clicks. Make sure you that understand what happens if you click ads on your 
own blog before you do it — some programs penalize or even ban bloggers 
that engage in click fraud.
Getting Advertising Going
Most bloggers choose to incorporate advertising programs by signing up 
with a company that serves as a middle man between the blogger and the 
advertiser. This company typically negotiates rates with the advertiser, 
tracks ad performance, and pays the blogger for advertising placement.
Although you can cut out the middle man and sell your own ad space, many 
bloggers find that they don’t really want to spend their time dealing with the 
negotiation, tracking, and technical overhead.
But even the most time-pressed blogger can likely find the strength to listen 
when an advertiser contacts that blogger directly and offers to sponsor the 
blog. These arrangements are typically more lucrative for the blogger (and 
the advertiser, presumably), and the two parties negotiate this relationship 
on a case-by-case basis, depending on the audience, product, blog traffic, and 
other factors.
After you decide on formats, placement, and business models, it’s time to 
put ads on your blog. The good — and bad — news is that you have dozens 
of options to choose from. In the following sections, I show you a few well-
regarded advertising programs to consider.

Google AdSense
www.google.com/adsense
AdSense is Google’s contextual advertising program, and it’s really the big-
gest player in the contextual advertising arena. When you sign up for Google 
AdSense, you choose what kinds of ads you want on your blog, from text to 
images to videos. You can see examples of the Google AdSense formats in 
Figure 17-3.
Advertisers pay Google money when your blog visitors click the advertise-
ments displayed beside your content, and you receive a portion of those 
payments. Successful bloggers who have a lot of traffic can earn a living from 
Google AdSense, but income varies greatly, depending on the size of your 
audience and how well your blog topics match the advertisers who contract 
with Google.

Yahoo! Publisher Network Content Match
http://publisher.yahoo.com/sell/ContentMatch.php
Yahoo! Publisher Network’s Content Match program (shown in Figure 17-4) 
is another advertising system that displays ads in a contextual manner. You 
can customize the look of the ads that appear on your blog so that they blend 
in with your blog itself by selecting color, size, and layout options. Content 
Match also allows you to filter out ads from potential competitors so that 
they don’t appear on your site.
Text Link Ads
www.text-link-ads.com
Based in New York, Text Link Ads is one of the most popular and recogniz-
able advertising systems that bloggers use. Designed with blogs in mind, 
these ads are a slightly different option than contextual advertising programs

that try to relate ads specifically to your content. Instead, you get only simple 
links that you preapprove, which are related but much lower-key in look and 
feel than contextual ads.
You can display Text Link Ads on the same page with Google AdSense, 
Yahoo! Publisher Network, and other contextually served ads.
AdBrite
www.adbrite.com
AdBrite is an advertising marketplace similar to the others mentioned in 
the preceding sections. Bloggers can choose between text, banner ads, full-
page interstitials (splash pages containing a full-page advertisement), inline 
ads, and image ads. Interstitials are high-paying ads that take over the entire 
browser window when a user clicks to move from one page of your Web site 
to another; they usually feature a Skip This Ad link or button.
Putting Ads on Your Blog
To get these ads onto your Web site, most often, the programs you sign up 
for provide you with a bit of code that you insert into your Web site tem-
plates. Some programs have step-by-step instructions for popular blog soft-
ware packages, but be aware that you might also need to consult your blog’s 
documentation for help with putting your ads where you want them.
First, decide just where you want the ads on your page. The best thing to do 
when you’re thinking about introducing ads into your blog design is to make 
sure the ads aren’t overpowering.
 
Don’t damage your reputation or credibility by overloading the site with ads 
or by associating ads too closely with your blog posts and content. Aside from 
pop-up ads, nothing is more annoying than having a blog design that’s created 
around ads rather than a blog that’s designed to include ads.
At the same time, you need to place ads in spots where readers can see them. 
Bloggers have discovered a few truths about ads, although your results might 
differ:

302
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
 
✓ Ads at the top and bottom of each page do poorly. Readers often 
ignore and rarely view advertisements along the top or the bottom of 
a blog because the site content usually appears in the middle of the 
screen. While users scroll their windows to view site content, they may 
never see these top and bottom advertisements at all.
 
✓ Ads in the sidebars perform well but might interfere with navigation. 
The left side of the Web site is a traditional place for ads. However, it’s 
also a prime place for navigation tools, and your Web site design might 
require that you locate such tools higher than the ads you want people 
to view. As for the right side, not only are navigation tools sometimes 
placed here, but the bulk of blog content tends be aligned to the left side 
of the screen, which means that some users might cover the right with 
other windows and miss these right-side advertisements entirely.
 
✓ Ads within the content itself get clicked. Some blogs have their ads 
placed within their content, and therefore visitors don’t miss the ads. 
But you need to be careful when you use advertising within your con-
tent. Remember that you want to make the content king, not the ad.
 
Try out ads in different places on your blog and see how your audience 
reacts, as well as how your earnings do. You might need to try several differ-
ent locations before you find one that balances your readers’ needs with your 
advertisers’.
Putting Ads in Your RSS Feeds
Active bloggers debate about whether RSS feeds should contain ads. 
Traditionally, bloggers have used RSS as a way to share information, and only 
recently has it become a place to put advertisements. You might want to con-
sider using RSS ads because many of your blog readers might use RSS read-
ers to consume the content of your blog.
RSS ads are simply banner or text advertisements that appear below or 
above the content displayed in your RSS reading program. The ads are usu-
ally smaller than typical banner ads on the average Web site because they’re 
meant to fit within the RSS feed. If you want to monetize your RSS feed, con-
sider these services:
 
✓ Pheedo (www.pheedo.com): Pheedo is the pioneering company that 
began the feed advertising industry. In 2003, Pheedo’s creators thought 
up an idea to place advertisements in RSS feeds and started Pheedo. 
Their business has grown into one of the largest advertising networks 
for RSS.

303
 Chapter 17: Making Mad Mad Money
 
✓ Feedvertising (www.text-link-ads.com/feedvertising): 
Feedvertising is a department of Text Link Ads that places ads within 
the RSS feed of your Web site. For its RSS feed ads, Feedvertising uses a 
similar system to Text Link Ads’ site-based ads.
 
✓ Google FeedBurner ads for blogs and feeds (www.feedburner.com/
fb/a/advertising): FeedBurner, a Google-owned company, is full 
of feed experts. They have a program called FeedBurner for Blogs and 
Feeds that allows you to control the ads that go onto your blog and blog 
feeds. They have established a significant ad network.
Getting Paid to Post
Being paid to post can mean a couple of different things. For many bloggers, 
it means receiving money or products to post a review or mention a company 
on a personal blog. But blogging for money can also lead you down the path 
of the professional blogger, where you write posts for other blogs.
Placing products on your blog
Some bloggers believe that getting paid to post about products or companies 
is a bad thing. However, blogging is hard work. Would it be so terrible to get 
paid to talk about a product every once in a while?
Some bloggers fear that the influence of advertisers might take over the tradi-
tionally independent voice of the blogosphere. When advertisers offer money 
to bloggers to praise their products and services in a blog, it might not result 
in an honest review of the business. So, if you’re paid to post information 
about someone else, make sure that you retain your ability to post your own 
honest opinion. You might even want to consider starting an additional blog 
to showcase content that you’re being paid to produce, as opposed to the 
content contained in your original blog.
 
Above all, let your readers know what products companies have paid you to 
mention or review, or sent you for free in hopes that you review them. You 
can head off accusations of deception by disclosing the terms of how you came 
to talk about a product or a post that some company has paid you for.
You can either set up your own system or find a service that allows you to 
connect with companies that want to have their products or services adver-
tised on blogs.

304
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
SponsoredReviews.com
www.sponsoredreviews.com
SponsoredReviews.com is a company that connects advertisers with blog-
gers who are willing to write reviews about the advertisers’ products and ser-
vices. This company is forthright with the expectation that you, as a blogger, 
will offer an honest opinion and even give constructive criticism about the 
products that its advertisers create.
PayPerPost
www.payperpost.com
PayPerPost is a company that helps bloggers get paid for creating and pub-
lishing advertiser-sponsored content. The theory behind the company is that 
if you’re a blogger, you’ll inevitably write about some products that you’ve 
used in the past or are currently using. PayPerPost believes you should be 
paid for those kinds of posts.
PayPerPost works somewhat like a job board, where you accept bids to write 
about a certain product or service. The advertiser and the amount of traffic 
you report determine the amount of money you receive.
Blogging professionally
You can offer your blogging services to those who might want them by 
making a small business for yourself as a professional blogger. Believe me; 
companies are often looking for competent writers they can hire to contrib-
ute content to their blogs. This decision might take time away from your per-
sonal blog, but hopefully, additional practice can help you to become a better 
blogger!
To offer up your service, check the blogger-wanted ads on job boards and see 
whether you’re interested in writing about any topic. Also, be sure to post 
about your availability on your own blog’s sidebar and in your blog itself.
Two job sites where you can start your search for blogging jobs are
 
✓ Jobs.Problogger (http://jobs.problogger.net): A popular Web 
site that provides help to bloggers so that they can monetize their Web 
sites. The job board is highly active, and blogger jobs often appear here.
 
✓ Performancing (www.performancing.com): A Web resource that was 
established as “a home for professional bloggers.” If you want to find job 
postings for new bloggers, you can check out their job posting forums.

305
 Chapter 17: Making Mad Mad Money
 
When you begin blogging professionally, you need to keep track of any prog-
ress you make. Typically, this tracking includes either the number of posts 
that you create or the number of site visitors over a period of time. You can 
organize this information in various ways, but the tracking needs to prove that 
some interaction occurred between you and your readers.
Tying in Affiliate Marketing
If you ever blogged about a product that you really like and just knew that 
you were helping the company who makes the product make a sale, you can 
now make some money from that sale with affiliate marketing.
Popular retailers have set up affiliate marketing programs, most notably 
Amazon. You sign up with an affiliate program, and when you blog about one 
of its products, you include a piece of identifying information that the com-
pany gives you. You earn cash when readers of your blog click the product 
and buy it.
If you find yourself blogging about items that others might buy as a result of 
your recommendation, check to see whether the company that makes the 
product has an affiliate program and sign yourself up.
In short order, your blog can contain links to books, DVDs, or other products 
that provide you with a commission on each product bought through a link 
from your Web site.
Amazon Associates Program
www.amazon.com/associates
Amazon is the most recognized affiliate program available, and it’s arguably 
one that you likely benefit from using because many bloggers mention books 
and DVDs that they’ve enjoyed.
Amazon Associates works by letting you create specially formatted links that 
you can use on your blog to drive traffic to the Amazon Web site. Anything 
that a visitor who clicks your link purchases earns you a percentage of the 
sale as a referral fee.

306
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
LinkShare
www.linkshare.com/affiliates/affiliates.shtml
LinkShare is another affiliate program that calls itself a pay-per-action mar-
keting network. You can place both text and graphical ads on your blog and 
make money from any sales that come from readers’ purchases.
Seeking Sponsorships
Sponsorships are advertisements by companies that have either requested to 
be an advertiser or whom you seek out to advertise on your site. Such spon-
sorship can mean one of two things:
 
✓ Sponsors might pay you to put their ads on your Web site.
 
✓ Sponsors might simply provide you with free goods or services in return 
for advertising on your Web site.
 
You need to think carefully about whether to take on a sponsor because not 
all sponsorships are equal:
 
✓ Prominent placement or exclusivity: A sponsor is different from the 
usual ad on your Web site because sponsors like a prominent placement 
on your blog — possibly including the exclusive right to advertise on 
your blog.
 
✓ Acknowledgment: A sponsor might ask you to use the phrase “This blog 
sponsored by . . . ” or some variation of it to let your readers know that a 
specific company is funding your blog. You may also want to thank your 
sponsor occasionally to generate extra good will.
 
✓ Time commitment: Sponsorships often run for a set length of time, 
usually much longer than a standard ad runs. Sponsorships of several 
months to a year aren’t unheard of.
Getting sponsors interested in your blog is probably the hardest advertis-
ing strategy, though it’s also the most lucrative. To find a sponsor, you need 
to “sell” your blog, from the design to the content. Make the sponsor want 
to post its advertisements on your site — not someone else’s. When you’re 
seeking sponsors, keep your blog dynamic, on topic, and well written.
One of the best things sponsors do for your blog is legitimize your work. 
Many bloggers might be viewed by the public as “just another blogger” 
within the static of the Internet. But, if you have sponsors that believe in 

307
 Chapter 17: Making Mad Mad Money
what you’re doing, you can attract other professional relationships, such as 
speaking engagements or press interviews. If you’re regarded as an authority, 
you can build a stronger brand.
Real Baking with Rose (http://www.realbakingwithrose.com) is 
an example of a sponsored blog. Written by cookbook author Rose Levy 
Beranbaum for cooks who are interested in baking, the blog is “brought to 
you by” Gold Medal Flour, which gets top billing in the blog’s header.
Negotiating a sponsorship experience
Sponsors can be demanding advertisers. Unlike developing your own mon-
etization plan, sponsorships can change the way you advertise on your site. 
Some sponsors demand exclusivity — which means they’re the only business 
of that type that advertises on your site, and you might have to turn away 
other potential sponsors. Others might demand that you always write about 
their product or services in a positive way. Dealing with sponsors can be a 
true balancing act. But the rewards can be worth the work.
Here’s my recipe for a successful sponsor/blogger relationship:
 
✓ Be clear on your topic. Know who you are and what you’re writing 
about. If you have a blog that isn’t clear about its subject, when you’re 
seeking sponsorship, potential sponsors may be unable to understand 
why they are a good match for your blog. Sponsors want a very clear 
idea about the content you’re creating and about what you can do for 
them.
 
 Keeping your blog on topic is especially important when sponsors are 
actively using their brand identities on your site. Make sure that they’re 
aware of everything you might write about so that they don’t have any 
surprises or objections to editorial content.
 
✓ Be clear about what you’re promising. Be sure both you and your spon-
sor understand exactly what influence and control — if any — the part-
nership offers the advertiser. Thoroughly outline how you’ll handle both 
content and advertising placement of the sponsor; the advertiser should 
be upfront about its expectations of you.
 
✓ Know your audience. Educate yourself on your audience if you’re seek-
ing paying sponsors for your blog. With increased sponsorship, you 
absolutely must address the question of who your audience is. You need 
to document the activity in your community, track your comments, and 
analyze the information from your Web statistics. (Check Chapter 16 for 
information on Web statistics and traffic software.)

308
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
 
 Create a report of your statistics to prove to any sponsors that you have 
the numbers that you claim you do. Don’t use any guesswork when cre-
ating this report — your sponsors want to see solid numbers and data to 
back up your claims. Sponsorship arrangements often require you to 
create statistics reports; the simple fact is that if you want to make 
money, you have to gather data.
 
 You can collect data from your audience in the form of contests, polls, 
and other interactive experiences. Ask your audience members who 
they are — and if you approach it in a professional manner, they might 
be happy to reveal a little bit about themselves.
 
✓ Banner placement and visual cues. If you’ve been placing advertising 
on your blog for awhile, you already have a good idea where ads appear 
to good effect on your site, and you probably also know what types of 
ads work best. So, you can demonstrate the benefits of placement and 
ad types to any potential sponsors.
 
 However, if you’ve never had ads on your site when you first seek a 
sponsor, be prepared to offer ideas and suggestions for adequately high-
lighting the sponsor’s ads and branding. You can even provide a design 
mock-up or some kind of visual representation. Or you might even con-
sider creating a demo Web site that actually shows the ads in the posi-
tions and formats that you think can work.
 
✓ Limit other monetization methods. Some bloggers find that if they use 
other advertising systems at the same time as a sponsor, it dilutes the 
effectiveness of the sponsorships. Many sponsors ask to be the exclu-
sive advertiser on your site or that you limit what other kinds of adver-
tising and advertisers you use while they sponsor you. This request isn’t 
unreasonable, especially if you have a lucrative sponsorship agreement 
that compensates you for the loss of those ad spots.
Setting boundaries
Jumping to the professional level in the blogging world poses a few potential 
pitfalls and requires ongoing reinvention on your part. Set up and keep to a 
few simple rules about what your professional limits and intentions are, and 
don’t be afraid to write those rules down in a document that you share with 
sponsors and your readers.

309
 Chapter 17: Making Mad Mad Money
Also, be ready to say no. Some sponsors might want more than you’re will-
ing to give. Yes, you may be able to earn some money from your blog, but 
don’t forget the reason you’re blogging in the first place. Your blog is your 
territory, not your sponsor’s. You’re renting the sponsor space on your site, 
giving them access to your audience. You aren’t signing up for someone to 
tell you what to do. You already have parents for that!
 
Don’t jump at every offer that comes in the door. You may find this advice 
difficult to follow when you’re seeking your first sponsor, but you need to 
maintain a high level of professionalism — not just for yourself, but also for 
your audience. In the same way that you protect your audience from nasty 
comments and spam, you need to be sure that you give them an appropriate 
experience with your sponsors and advertisers. Protect the integrity of your 
blog and avoid sponsors that demand more time, editorial control, or space 
on your blog than you’re willing to give.
Accepting Gifts, Not Obligations
Many companies offer news media access to products and services in order 
to generate press attention, and increasingly, bloggers are being offered 
the same goodies. After all, some blog topics are so specific that companies 
absolutely know that the blog’s readers will be interested in their products. 
For example, a blogger who writes about cell phones might be targeted by a 
mobile phone company, and offered a free product or money in exchange for 
some kind of online review or feedback.
This kind of exchange can be a tricky situation because some bloggers regard 
the gift as some kind of bribe or obligation to write something positive about 
the product in question.
In fact, that perception isn’t correct. I know bloggers who accept products 
for review on the condition that they say what they really think about it, and 
most companies are perfectly satisfied with this kind of arrangement. In addi-
tion, most bloggers who do these kinds of reviews are very upfront with their 
readers about how they obtained the product in question and what agree-
ment they have with the company that provided it.
If you’re getting these offers, you can probably benefit from establishing such 
a policy. Most bloggers don’t want to be seen as taking bribes or favors from 
companies that just want the bloggers to say nice things about them. Your 
policy needs to lay out how you plan to deal with such situations.

310
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
Here are a few things to consider when you start to get product-review offers:
 
✓ Be clear about what you’ll do with the product. Tell the product maker 
that you won’t write a positive review if the product doesn’t deserve it. 
Make sure that you’re very specific about what you’ll provide in return 
for the gift (if anything).
 
✓ Be prepared to return gifts. A lot of bloggers, especially the incredibly 
geeky ones, would love to receive a gift from a company that has the 
latest and hottest product. However, if the company has unreasonable 
demands or demands that don’t match the blogger’s vision, the blogger 
might choose to simply return the gift.
 
✓ Donate what you receive. You can avoid an ugly scene with your audi-
ence or any sponsors of your blog by taking the gifts you receive, writing 
your review, and then giving the items away. You can send them to your 
favorite charity or hold a contest for your audience. Donating your free-
bies generates all kinds of goodwill from your community while avoiding 
any accusations of bias.
Keep to the core of what makes your blog great. If you get an offer of a free 
product, think about it first — don’t accept it right away. You can even go 
to your community members and see what they think if you require advice. 
Whether you accept ads or sponsorships, and how you implement them, 
really depends on you.

▶ Establishing a plan for blogging success
▶ Exploring the technological bells and whistles
▶ Advertising on blogs
A
s a business owner or entrepreneur, you’re probably wondering 
whether blogging can help you be more financially successful or allow 
you to promote your company in some way. Many of today’s technically 
savvy businesses have started blogs and found them to be terrific tools for 
reaching out to customers, generating buzz about a service or product, build-
ing goodwill, or just informing customers about what they’re up to.
If you’re thinking about adding a blog to your outreach efforts but aren’t 
entirely confident that it’ll be worth the time and effort, you’re not alone. 
Many companies have difficulty seeing the value in blogging. Some profes-
sionals worry about diverting time away from more crucial workplace tasks, 
whereas others worry about opening themselves up for public criticism.
And the truth is that even though blogging can provide a business with a 
really incredible tool, it isn’t right for every business. Nonetheless, in this 
chapter, I do my best to persuade you that blogging can work for you and your 
company, whether you’re a lone-wolf entrepreneur just starting out or a Fortune 
500 executive with more marketing staff than you know what to do with.

Blogs For Dummies, which covers in depth what I can cover only briefly in this

Putting Blogs to Work for Your Business
A stigma still lingers around blogs. Many people still think of a blogger as a 
pimple-faced teenager who sits in his pajamas all day writing excruciatingly 
boring diary posts about what he had for breakfast. Blogs, for a lot of folks, 
equate with the worst kind of narcissistic navel-gazing. Those kinds of blogs 
do exist, of course, but in reality, the blogosphere contains so much more 
than that. Hundreds of nonprofit organizations, small-business owners, con-
sultants, newspapers, and schools have moved into the blogosphere.
Why? Blogs are simple to set up, easy to publish, and have a proven track 
record for increasing search engine traffic to a Web site. For a company in 
which time is of the essence and accessibility is a necessity — show me a 
company where these things aren’t a priority, and I’ll eat my hat — blogs are 
a low-investment way to accomplish a lot. Don’t believe me? Then perhaps 
you’ll believe General Motors, McDonald’s, Microsoft, Amazon, The New York 
Times, and Southwest Airlines; all these companies have added blogs to their 
business practices.
Considering the benefits of a business blog
For a business or organization, you can use blog software to release com-
pany public-relations documents to the public, or you can go further and 
introduce blogs as part of your external communications to your customers 
and potential customers. Some companies use blogs internally to coordinate 
work teams or communicate across distances. Here are a few of the ways 
businesses are using blogs:
 
✓ Generating conversation and buzz about the company, its products, or 
services in the online space
 
✓ Reaching out with information and support to current customers, even 
resolving issues traditionally handled by phone-based customer service
 
✓ Creating new pathways to interact with the public about an industry or 
issue, including gathering feedback and input to guide future product 
development
 
✓ Defusing negative criticism or press by publicly addressing problems
 
✓ Demonstrating expertise and experience to potential customers
 
✓ Directly driving sales or action
 
✓ Collaborating across teams, branches, regions, or staggered shifts

313
 Chapter 18: Blogging for Companies
When it comes to business, the main thing that a business blogger should 
consider is that blog software, implemented properly, can allow companies 
to improve their communications and organization with very little overhead. 
In some cases, blogs have even saved businesses money by delivering docu-
ments and data online that were previously delivered via snail mail.
Businesses haven’t been the only beneficiaries, either. Customers have ben-
efited from increased access to news, information, support, and dialog with 
companies that have blogs.
Making blogs work for you can be simple if you have a communication strat-
egy that’s flexible and can evolve when your blog takes off. Blogs can generate 
sales and establish strong communication directly with customers, and 
marketing experts believe blogs are a friendly method of making customers 
happy.
Checking out businesses that blog
You know blogging is important. You already know that it gives you a very 
good way to generate talk about your company. Do you need a little more 
convincing? Well, the following sections discuss how some other companies 
are blogging.
Hewlett-Packard
www.hp.com/hpinfo/blogs
You’ve probably owned a Hewlett-Packard product at some point in your 
computing life. Hewlett-Packard has built computers, printers, cameras, and 
high-end computer servers for years, building up incredible expertise across 
a range of consumer products. You can see that knowledge in the HP blogs, 
which claim to convey the “unvarnished thoughts of HP employees.” Topics 
range from computers to the Cannes Film Festival to gaming, and the blog-
gers come from all areas of the company’s structure.
Wells Fargo
http://blog.wellsfargo.com
What could a bank possibly blog about, you ask? Apparently, banks can 
discuss a whole lot with their customers. Student loans, small business, and 
stock markets are all topics discussed on the Wells Fargo Blogs site. Wells 
Fargo Blogs gives multiple contributors a public voice in a variety of blogs, 
from The Student LoanDown to Guided by History.

Microsoft Community
www.microsoft.com/communities/blogs
The Microsoft Community Blogs (shown in Figure 18-1) are one way that 
Microsoft reaches out to customers and potential customers. These blogs, 
written by software and hardware developers, give interested readers a 
behind-the-scenes peek at their favorite products and a way to interact with 
the developers.
Sun Microsystems
http://blogs.sun.com
Sun Microsystems also reaches out to customers by using developer blogs. 
On the blogs, customers can seek out and talk directly to the people involved 
in the making of a product, giving customers a feeling of involvement and 
direct access not available from traditional marketing efforts.
It’s pretty ingenious, when you think about it — put your engineers and pro-
grammers to work helping you promote your products and services, rather 
than just creating them!

 Chapter 18: Blogging for Companies
Deciding whether to blog
Blogging for business reasons is a sensitive topic both in and out of the 
blogosphere. Old-school bloggers don’t like seeing blogging turned from a 
personal outlet into a professional one, and many businesses worry that the 
informality of a blog looks unprofessional. And that’s not all — some busi-
nesses also have concerns about employees who have personal blogs on 
which they might talk about their work or appear to be representing the 
company.
Blogging isn’t for every corporate culture. If your company has traditionally 
had an open hand with communication and outreach, blogging is going to be 
a great tool for you. But if you have a reserved corporate culture, blogging 
might be too much of a stretch beyond business as usual. Many companies 
that might seem an odd fit for blogs for marketing or outreach have been 
happily surprised at the results they’ve obtained.
Businesses that need to keep information or trade practices confidential, or 
that stand to lose by having an open-door policy, probably shouldn’t blog. 
For instance, some government agencies and law firms are limited by the 
very nature of their business in what they can communicate. You know best 
whether your corporate culture or industry can’t benefit from the use of a 
blog.
 
At the very least, however, track your company and what’s said about it in the 
blogosphere. Just because you ignore blogs, that doesn’t mean they ignore 
you! Chapter 16 explains how you can keep tabs on what others say about 
your business online.
 
If you’re still on the fence about starting a blog, try one with a set end-
point, for an event or a product launch. After the event occurs, you can 
end the blog’s lifespan gracefully and have some real data to use in assess-
ing whether blogging was a worthwhile endeavor for you. Also, take a look 
at your competitors — are any of them blogging? If so, does the blog appear 
to be reaching visitors effectively? Are readers leaving comments? Watch 
how these competitors are making use of a blog and give some thought to 
whether you might be able to do something similar (but more effectively).

Planning for Business Blog Success
Blogging for a business comes down to planning. Don’t let the easiness of 
getting started with the technical side of blogging seduce you into jumping 
in without preparing. You need to decide what your goals are, figure out who 
you want to actually blog, map out the topics that you plan to discuss, and 
plan how you might integrate direct action or sales.
Setting goals
Before you jump into blogging for your business, you need to set goals that 
define how you can know whether your blog is successful after you launch 
it. Decide what you want the blog to help you accomplish. Do you want to 
Top five reasons why blogs work for businesses
Here are the most important reasons that blogs 
work so well as a business and marketing tool 
in today’s Internet-enabled world:
 ✓ Cost: A lot of blogging software packages 
are open source and available at no cost, 
but even those that have licensing fees are 
very reasonably priced. Hosted services 
can also provide you with an inexpensive 
platform to begin business blogging.
 ✓ Communication: A blog allows you to com-
municate with potential and current clients 
in a direct and informal way. You can chat 
and communicate about your product or 
service without pressuring your client. You 
use a business blog to make sure that your 
potential or existing clients get the facts 
about your product without a heavy-handed 
sales pitch.
 ✓ Research: Many companies want to break 
into new markets and new demographics. 
Blogging allows for collaborative discus-
sion that can help you gather valuable 
information about how to position products 
and services.
 ✓ Feedback: Find out what you’re doing right 
and wrong in your business or with your 
products by just asking outright on your 
blog. Discover how to improve what you’re 
currently doing or how you can deal with 
existing problems — and get points for 
effort while you do.
 ✓ Reputation: Do away with that corporate-
giant personality most companies can’t 
help but convey. Blogs can put a human, 
personal face on what has usually been 
a monolithic surface. If you let the public 
see how you respect and regard them, you 
reap the benefits of being honest and open. 
Smaller businesses and consultancies ben-
efit from the publicity around their name 
and opinion.

317
 Chapter 18: Blogging for Companies
replace some of your existing customer service efforts with the blog? Are you 
launching a new product that needs publicity? Whatever your direction, plan 
your purpose prior to launching the blog.
 
So many things could go into a blog, but you also have a business to run. 
Decide how much time you want to devote to writing and maintaining your 
blog. Blogging is part of your business, but it can’t take away from time you 
need to devote to other tasks.
You might choose to define success by
 
✓ Increasing traffic to your Web site
 
✓ Reaching a certain number of blog comments on a daily basis
 
✓ Seeing more conversation about your company/products/services in the 
media or on other blogs
 
✓ Earning money from product sales or blog advertising
You might want to define success for your blog in other ways, so don’t think 
you have to use any of these suggestions. A blog is such a flexible medium 
that yours might accomplish a goal I can’t even imagine!
Choosing a blogger
Businesses have developed two approaches to company blogs: blogs written 
by one person and those written by multiple people from all over the organi-
zation. Either approach is valid, as long as everyone posting to the blog has a 
clear idea of the goals, ideas, and style of the blog.
 
If you create a blog that has multiple contributors, put a single individual in 
charge of content on a regular basis and encourage others from the organiza-
tion to chime in when they have something to say. The responsibility for the 
blog is in one person’s hands, but the door is open for wide participation.
Occasional writers are welcome, but don’t suddenly give employees brand-
new job duties that they can’t meet. Having multiple voices in a blog can also 
help you to convey the culture of your company overall, giving readers a 
taste of what people at all levels of the organization think about and do.
If you spread the writing around, you might be able to create a blog that has 
a huge amount of content and satisfies a very large readership. The multiple-
voice perspective might also awaken ideas in the other writers and generate 
internal conversations.

318
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
 
No matter who blogs, you must decide internally whether someone needs to 
vet posts before actually posting them, and who should do the vetting. It’s a 
good idea to have someone who isn’t blogging keep an eye on things, just to 
get a second opinion.
When you’re considering just who should blog on behalf of the company, 
give some thought to
 
✓ Writing ability: You need a blogger who’s an effective writer and who 
also likes to write.
 
✓ Position within the company: Who’s the right person to reach out to 
the public? CEOs offer one perspective, and so do those on the factory 
floor. Try to match the goals and style of your blog with the right people 
within your company, and don’t be afraid to give unexpected staffers a 
try. You might be surprised at how interesting readers find a behind-the-
curtain approach.
 
✓ Knowledge and expertise: Be sure to choose a person who has suf-
ficient knowledge and expertise to be interesting and engaging on the 
subjects the blog discusses. Preferably, you want people who really 
know what they’re talking about and have information to share.
 
✓ Time commitments: Choose a blogger who has the time to put into the 
site. Don’t overload already busy staff with this new job requirement.
After you choose a blogger, you have a few more folks to identify. Don’t 
forget to plan who you want to review comments, deal with spam, and fix 
technical issues.
Deciding what to write
While you think about topics for the blog, consider how informal or personal 
you want to make your blog style. Although the occasional personal post 
can help to humanize your blog, don’t be tempted down the journaling path: 
You’re creating a business blog, so look for creative ways of covering your 
industry.
The goal of many business blogs is to establish (or maybe reestablish) the 
business as a leader in its industry. Think about how to demonstrate exper-
tise while staying interesting and readable: You need to show that you know 
your stuff without becoming a stuffed shirt! Use the blog to persuade people 
that they should trust you without coming right out and telling people, “I’m 
trustworthy!”

319
 Chapter 18: Blogging for Companies
Whoever blogs for your business needs to have a keen understanding of the 
goals and culture of the company, as well as know how much information to 
put on the blog without going too far. Many companies set up rules about 
topics that are appropriate for the blog, as well as define what information 
they want to keep confidential.
Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind for your blog content:
 
✓ Keep it true. Double-check blog posts for accuracy before making them 
live. Like a newspaper or any other publisher, follow a process to make 
sure you’re publishing facts and not fiction. You can include opinions on 
your business’s blog as long as you label them as just that.
 
✓ Keep it relevant and real. Be as open and honest as you can in your 
blog. This approach to transparency can make some in your company 
nervous (hi, corporate lawyer!), but the more successful business blogs 
provide insight or communication from real people. Some even give the 
public access to the viewpoints and words of high-level staff the read-
ers would normally never meet or talk to. Furthermore, whoever blogs 
should stay on topic and keep posts related to the subject of the blog, 
no matter how interesting that TV show was last night.
 
✓ Keep it informative and educational. One problem that many com-
panies encounter when they start to blog is the fact that their blog is 
(ahem) boring. You might have great information, but if people don’t 
also find it interesting to read about, you can’t get readers to stick 
around long. Try to write posts that educate with a light-hearted manner 
and that focus on information and news that’s useful to those reading it.
 
✓ Keep it positive. Steer away from discussing your competition in your 
blog. If you can say something nice about another company, don’t hesi-
tate, but you probably don’t want to point out just what other companies 
are doing wrong. That kind of approach can turn your blog into a giant 
argument, scaring off less-opinionated customers who might otherwise 
be interested in your products and services.
 
✓ Keep using keywords. Part of the plan of a business-related blog is to 
make sure the blog is useful to readers, but for that plan to work, you 
have to get readers from the search engine to your blog. Use your knowl-
edge of your industry and topical news to use keywords that people are 
likely to use in search engines when they look for the subject of your 
blog or your business.
 
 Pay special attention to the words that you use in the titles of your blog 
posts: Search engines often weight these words most heavily, so hit the 
highpoints in your titles. Informative is better than cutesy!

320
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
 
✓ Keep linking. Business blogs should also link to related articles and Web 
sites. You can link to resources on your business’s own Web site, but 
don’t hesitate to point folks to good information that isn’t on your Web 
site. If you’re a source for information that they need or can get them to 
the information they need effectively, you don’t lose them for long.
 
 Also, look for chances to link the blog to itself! A lot of bloggers are 
clever about linking to old posts on their own blogs so that new readers 
know where to go deep within the blog archives. This kind of linking can 
increase traffic and also inform and educate your readers.
 
✓ Keep posting. Post on a regular basis and don’t stop. Don’t worry about 
an absolutely right number of posts per week, but most experts agree 
that two to three posts a week is enough to keep your blog active and 
useful without overwhelming your readers. Other bloggers post less 
frequently, and others post multiple times a day. Do what works for 
you and for your readers, but be consistent so that your readers know 
what to expect from you. If your blog has long silences followed by short 
bursts of posting, you create a recipe for low readership numbers.
Generating sales or action
Asking potential customers to check out your services after they read some-
thing on your blog can turn those readers into actual customers. If you see a 
logical link to a product or service that you offer, it only makes sense to let 
people know. But you need to do more than simply push sales. You tread a 
fine line between a blog that points out possible purchases, along with pro-
viding content, and one that isn’t anything more than a big ad.
 
Keep one idea in mind: Meet the needs of your readers. If you can put yourself 
in the shoes of a blog visitor, you might be able to successfully discriminate 
between a reasonable link to a product sale and one that’s too blatant.
Some blogs don’t try hard to get people to pull out their wallets. Instead, the 
blog’s purpose might be to gather feedback and get people to participate in 
an event or contest. Again, try to be genuine and inviting, rather than pushy. 
Get readers involved and invested in your goal.
The GreenView blog (www.greenviewblog.com) successfully negoti-
ates between information and sales. This blog, shown in Figure 18-2, keeps 
readers up to date on news and information about lawn care, tracking the 
seasons, the environment, and other issues that impact lawns and gar-
dens. When warranted, the blog links to some of the fertilizer products of 
GreenView Fertilizer, the Pennsylvania-based company that runs the blog.

Delivering with Technology
You might be thinking about how you, as a blogger, can make connections 
with potential customers by using your blog. Words are a great start, but 
technology can also be your friend! A lot of the standard blog bells and 
whistles are designed to get people involved or to make it easy for them to 
consume your blog.
Use the tools in the following sections to get readers to return to your blog 
again and again.
Enabling comments
Comments are a double-edged sword for companies that start blogs. On the 
one hand, they do a great job of starting conversation and interaction. On 
the other hand, they can be a source of a lot of work because you have to 
keep them free of spam or inappropriate conversation. Many businesses are 

322
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
tempted to start a blog and keep comments turned off, but that cuts out a 
huge part of the benefit of a blog: hearing from your readers and interacting 
directly with them.
My advice? Turn on the comments! But take precautions by setting up a good 
policy about what kinds of comments are acceptable and implement some of 
the very good spam-fighting tools discussed in Chapter 9.
Creating RSS/Web feeds
Before the advent of Web feeds, blog readers had to remember to visit the 
blog periodically to see whether the blogger had posted a new entry. This 
dangerous method made it easy for people to forget to visit. Web feeds, or 
RSS feeds, give you a way to let people know quickly, easily, and automati-
cally that you have new content available on your blog. Blog visitors simply 
subscribe to the feed by using a newsreader, which tracks the feed and 
updates it every time you update the blog, giving instant notification to the 
reader.
Users can set up Web feeds, usually formatted as RSS (Really Simple 
Syndication), quickly and easily. In fact, most blog software packages auto-
matically include an RSS tool, so you can set it up once and never think about 
it again.
I talk more about Web feeds in Chapter 13.
Podcasting
Podcasting is a relative newcomer to the blogosphere, but it’s proving to be 
a powerful blog ally. Podcasting, the recording and distribution of audio and 
video files to subscribers, has a tremendous potential to give your business 
blog a boost by providing multimedia presentations to your readers. You 
can add personality and a face to your blog. Posting interviews, discoveries, 
tutorials, and other adventures that your company has had can boost your 
visibility higher than a text-only blog can.
HBO produces podcasts to accompany many of its top shows (www.hbo.
com/podcasts). A quick run through the selection reveals interviews with 
directors, stars, on-set interviews, episode clips, and more.
You can read more about creating a podcast in Chapter 11.

 Chapter 18: Blogging for Companies
Starting a wiki
Wikis are collaboratively built Web sites, which any visitor can edit. 
Businesses and organizations have found that wikis can complement blog 
sites nicely. Blogs allow for comments, but a wiki can provide a little more 
flexibility because visitors can both post pages and leave updates in a wiki, 
contributing to everything from documentation to news coverage.
Wikis are terrific collaborative tools, and if you’ve been trying to figure out a 
good way to share knowledge within an organization, you might want to use 
this approach. Many companies have found wikis useful for group learning 
purposes, such as building documentation or setting up procedural tasks. 
One of the most well-known examples of a successful wiki is Wikipedia (www.
wikipedia.org), an online encyclopedia to which anyone can contribute 
content or edit existing content. You can even find it available in multiple 
languages.
The Northern Voice blogging conference (www.northernvoice.ca) used a 
wiki to allow attendees of a self-organized event called Moose Camp to create 
its own event schedule. Figure 18-3 shows the wiki.

Joining a social network
Adding your company to a variety of social networks can also help to boost 
your visibility in the blogosphere. Businesses tend to shy away from social 
networking as a valid form of online advertising, but using these mediums 
properly can add a viral component to your communication strategy. (Viral 
marketing is advertising that consumers actually spread themselves. For 
example, when you forward a funny video created by a company, you’ve 
spread the “virus.”)
A lot of social networks exist, so be sure to choose those that are most per-
tinent for your industry and approach, not those frequented by 14-year-old 
girls (unless that suits your business!). LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) and 
XING (www.xing.com) are good places to get started.
To get started with LinkedIn, follow these steps:
 
1. Use your Web browser to go to www.linkedin.com.
 
2. Fill out the registration form and click the Join Now button.
 
 LinkedIn loads the signup continuation screen.
 
3. Fill out the required fields, including your name, business informa-
tion, and where you went to school.
 
4. Click Join LinkedIn.
 
 LinkedIn creates an account for you.
 
 After you’re a LinkedIn member, be sure to click the Expand Your 
Network button at the top-right of any page in order to invite colleagues 
or see who in your e-mail address book already uses LinkedIn.
I introduce social networks and what they’re all about in Chapter 15.
Advertising on Blogs
Traditional marketing strategies include advertising, and blogs are no excep-
tion. But these aren’t your father’s ads: Blog advertising runs the gamut of 
everything from text links to full sponsorships.
In the past, taking out a typical advertisement meant that you’d go to the 
local newspaper, select an ad size, and choose a section in which you 
wanted your ad to appear. Maybe people saw the ad, maybe they didn’t, 
but you got charged by how many newspapers were printed, not how many 
sales you made.

325
 Chapter 18: Blogging for Companies
Online advertising offers more accountability to the advertiser: Because of 
the way Web sites work, you can track how many times readers’ computers 
load an ad, when a reader clicks it, and what the person does after he or she 
clicks that ad. Because advertisers like this kind of measure of effectiveness, 
printed material has seen a significant decline in the purchase of ad space, 
whereas online advertising has grown hugely. You can use several methods 
to get your name or even your blog URL seen on other Web sites and blogs.
Going contextual
Contextual advertising is the practice in which an ad-serving tool matches the 
advertisements based on the content that appears in the blog. For example, a 
blog about candy would have ads for candy, and a blog about movies would 
show ads for upcoming films. If the Web site visitors are interested in the con-
tent of the Web site, they’re likely also interested in goods and services related 
to the topic of the Web site, and thus they’re more likely to click the ads.
The first major player in the contextual advertising game was Google 
AdSense. The program was popular from the start, and after a few rocky 
periods of users abusing the system, it has proven to be quite a moneymaker 
for successful bloggers. Many professional bloggers make their living almost 
entirely on the income received from Google AdSense revenue. Search-engine 
marketer Alexandre Brabant uses Google AdSense on his company Web site, 
eMarketing 101 (www.emarketing101.net). The Google AdSense program 
ads appear below the navigation bar of his site, as shown in Figure 18-4.
Here are two ways that you can get involved with Google’s contextual adver-
tising tools:
 
✓ Sign up to put ads on your blog or Web site. Use the Google AdSense 
program (www.google.com/adsense). Chapter 17 introduces this 
program.
 
✓ Submit your blog or Web site for display. The Google AdWords pro-
gram (http://adwords.google.com) lets you present your blog or 
Web site in the ads displayed on other Web sites.
 
If you want to find out more about leveraging Google AdSense for your blog or 
business, check out Building Your Business with Google For Dummies, by Brad 
Hill; Pay Per Click Search Engine Marketing For Dummies, by Peter Kent; or 
Google AdWords For Dummies, by Howie Jacobson.
Yahoo! and several other companies also have contextual advertising 
programs — do a Web search for contextual advertising programs to see 
what’s on offer.

You can add contextual advertising to your Web (RSS) feed or put yourself 
into other Web feeds by using the FeedBurner Ad Network (http://feed
burner.google.com).
Advertising via ad networks
A number of advertising middlemen can help successful bloggers put ads on 
their blogs. In most cases, you can choose between text and graphic ads in a 
set of standard Web-advertising sizes. You create the ad, the ad network serves 
it up, the blogger posts new content, and his or her visitors see your ad.
If you want to advertise on some of the most successful blogs around, check 
out one or more of these ad networks:
 
✓ b5media (www.b5media.com): Offers ad placement on more than 290 
blogs reaching more than 10 million readers; bloggers can sign up to be 
paid for blogging on the b5media blog network.

327
 Chapter 18: Blogging for Companies
 
✓ Blogads (www.blogads.com): Offers ad placement on 1,500 blogs and 
allows you to choose an audience to target (for example, parents or 
news junkies).
 
✓ ClickZ (www.clickz.com): Offers ad placement on the ClickZ family of 
news, opinion, and entertainment sites.
 
✓ Crisp Ads (www.crispads.com): Offers advertising across blog catego-
ries (such as autos and food) or on specific blogs. More than 3,800 blogs 
are enrolled.
 
✓ FeedBurner (www.feedburner.com): Offers placement on blogs and in 
RSS feeds; choose from categories of blogs and/or target specific times 
of day or geographic regions.
Each of these services offers you an array of popular blogs and ad formats to 
choose from, organizes the deal, and handles the transaction. Rates are nego-
tiated based on the level of advertising, the blogs that you’re placed on, and 
how many times your ads are viewed or clicked.
Sponsoring a blog
For a splashy way to be seen on a blog or Web site, consider sponsoring the 
site. Sponsorships for popular blogs have gained a lot of notoriety in the 
blogosphere. Some bloggers call accepting sponsorships “selling out,” but 
others regard it as a great way to get paid to do what they love. Sponsorships 
tend to get you coverage on other blogs, even if it’s just speculation about 
the amount you paid to sponsor a blog, but as they say, “Any publicity is 
good publicity.”
Sponsorships usually entitle you to occupy any and perhaps all advertising 
slots on a blog, and they often earn you mentions in the text of the blog, as 
well. Few blogs actually advertise that they accept sponsorships, largely 
because sponsored blogs are still fairly rare. If you want to sponsor a blog, 
contact the blogger directly with an inquiry. He or she can let you know 
whether the blog is open to a sponsorship, and you can go from there.
Sponsorships can be expensive to do. Be prepared to negotiate with the blog-
ger about the length of your sponsorship and the amount of money you’re 
willing to pay, but think bigger than you would for advertisement. In some 
cases, sponsors assume the operating costs of a blog, in addition to paying 
the blogger for his or her time and audience exposure.

328
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
As a sponsor, you’re entitled to more than just a prominent ad placement 
(though you should get that, too!). You can consider requesting exclusivity — 
that you’re the only advertiser in your industry on the blog, the only spon-
sor, or the only advertiser. You can request mentions in the copy of the blog, 
or any other arrangement you think is good for both you and the blogger. For 
many sponsors, having a prominent logo placement and label at the top of 
every blog page, and no other advertising on the blog, fills the bill.
Topics to discuss with any blogger you’re considering sponsoring include the 
following:
 
✓ What topics the blog covers: Know what kinds of content the blog 
you’re sponsoring typically has, and what kind of language it uses. 
Because readers associate your brand with the blog, you need to be 
comfortable with the way the blogger expresses him- or herself, as well 
as what subjects the blogger may raise.
 
 You might also want to discuss how you plan to handle situations in 
which the blogger has blogged about a topic with which you have a 
problem. Understand that the blogger is likely to resist giving you edito-
rial control, and be clear about what, if any, say you want to have in the 
content of the site.
 
✓ How you want the blog to acknowledge your sponsorship: Be sure to 
establish how the blogger will place your brand on the page, and when 
and where he or she will mention your business and link to your busi-
ness’s Web site.
 
✓ How other ads or monetization occur on the blog: Talk with the blog-
ger about other ways that he or she earns revenue and decide what, if 
any, of those systems can remain in place during the term of your spon-
sorship. Be prepared to compensate the blogger for any revenue that 
he or she usually earns that you request he or she remove from the site. 
For example, if the blogger commonly uses Google AdSense advertising 
that you don’t want to appear on the blog when you sponsor it, ask for 
accounting statements showing the value of those ads to the blogger.

Ten Ways of Growing Community
In This Chapter
▶ Putting in the time to keep your community active
▶ Encouraging conversation and ideas
▶ Asking for help diagnosing problems or building interaction
E
very online community needs leaders or facilitators to keep the discus-
sions lively, upbeat, and on topic. Playing “mom” or “dad” can be the 
hardest job in any community, and sometimes, the rewards come slowly. 
Don’t let this fact discourage you, though. Encouraging growth in any com-
munity requires a certain level of patience, persistence, and attention — but 
when it works, it really works.
This chapter offers a few simple tricks for developing your blog from your 
soapbox into a real community, with true interaction between you and your 
readers, and among the readers themselves.
If you’re lucky, in the process of getting people to read and comment on your 
posts and on each other’s comments, you even discover how to convert 
readers into community evangelists who can make the community larger, 
more fun, and more active.
Write
Get writing (or podcasting, or posting photos, or whatever it is you’re doing 
on your blog)!
Establish a regular schedule for maintaining your blog; a schedule really 
helps readers know what to expect and when. A regular schedule can even 
build anticipation and excitement. Be open to ideas, provide a welcoming 
environment, and keep yourself on topic so that interested, engaged readers 
get what they’re looking for when they visit.

332
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Write on other Web sites, as well. See whether other blogs might need a little 
help with a few additional posts. Also, help keep the conversations going on 
other blogs that you enjoy. Each time you comment on another blog, you get 
exposure to a few more potential readers for your own blog and build links 
back to your blog (which can help boost your search engine rankings).
Reply
If someone asks you a question, either in the comments or through e-mail, 
make sure to reply. Acknowledge what the person says in your reply and take 
the time to answer properly, even if only to thank him or her for the com-
ment. Thoughtful responses to questions and comments about your blog can 
do as much to build your community as original blog posts can.
Some bloggers take the attitude that reader comments aren’t important or 
don’t count as much as the blog posts. If you actually want to build a reader-
ship that interacts with you, this attitude is dead wrong. Readers want your 
attention and encouragement.
Keep on top of what people are saying within your blog domain and don’t be 
a stranger to those who like what you do. Embrace their enthusiasm for your 
blog. Give them a reason to keep coming back. Interaction can make those 
who might shy away feel that they’re really part of the community that you’re 
developing.
If you reply to comments and criticism on both your blog and in other online 
communities, you can really attract others to your own site. Get involved as 
much as you would in any offline community group.
Visit and Participate
Join other communities. It’s that simple. If you want to build a community 
around your blog, you need to participate in others. Find blogs that are 
related to the topic areas of your blog. Jump into the conversation by offer-
ing a different perspective, or some feedback to the blogger or to the folks 
who leave comments. Mentioning your site on other blogs is fine, as long as 
you make sure that your comments relate to the subject at hand and add to 
the conversation.
Also, don’t just write and leave. Keep active in the communities in which 
you’re a member and use that time to connect with others. Take what you 
can from the community, but also give back what you think can benefit 

333
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways of Growing Community
everyone as a whole. Remember that participating in these communities 
might even give you ideas for your own blog, so you’re likely to benefit in 
several ways from the time you spend on these blogs.
You can also share links between your blog community and related blogs 
that you want to support. Offer to set up a type of network where you can 
share content between sites. Anything is possible; you only need to ask.
Add Guest Bloggers
If your blog readership is up and running, and you’re attracting a significant 
number of daily readers, you can request that members of your community 
help you out by guest-blogging on your site. Depending on the software 
you’re using, you can either set up secondary blogs or allow them to post to 
the main blog of your site. Getting other perspectives and comments from 
your community “experts” is incredibly cool, and you might be able to build 
a series of posts from other bloggers into your site.
This kind of blogging trade-off can let you have multiple voices fill out the 
content on your site and provide a richer experience for your readers.
 
These relationships are great to have when you get sick or want to take a 
vacation — tap your guest-blogging community for help covering your blog 
while you aren’t around to do it.
Try E-Mail and Newsletters
As spam-ridden as electronic mail can be, you can still use it to stay in con-
tact with your community. Offering e-mail delivery of some or all of your blog 
content to your readership can attract users who aren’t comfortable with 
some of the fancier technologies, such as RSS. Try these three tactics:
 
✓ Let your readers send a blog post to a friend who might also be interested.
 
✓ Let your users sign up for e-mail notifications when you post something 
new to your blog.
 
✓ Let your readers sign up for an e-mail newsletter that supplements your 
blog or recaps recent blog posts of interest.
Many blog software programs have built-in Tell a Friend or Email a Friend 
functionality. If you turn this feature on, every blog post includes a small 
icon or link that, when clicked, lets your reader fill out the name and e-mail 

334
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
address of a friend and send an e-mail notification about your blog post to 
that friend. It’s like free marketing. Figure 19-1 shows an Email to a Friend 
form on the Improv Everywhere blog (www.improveverywhere.com).
You can easily reach users who have mastered e-mail, but aren’t up on news-
readers and RSS, by setting up your blog to allow users to sign up for e-mail 
notifications when you post a new blog entry. Allowing them to sign up and 
also remove themselves from your e-mail system puts them in control of the 
situation, which means that you don’t contribute to the spam problem. The 
FeedBurner site (http://feedburner.google.com) lets you set up an 
e-mail notification/subscription tool.
Taking the time to create some kind of additional e-mail newsletter can also 
get people interested in your Web site. You can take a little time at the end 
of each calendar month to pick out your best or most popular blog posts. 
You can include the links to your blog posting, or you can copy and paste the 
blog post into an e-mail and send it off.

 Chapter 19: Ten Ways of Growing Community
You can create this kind of newsletter in several ways, but it’s most effec-
tive if you to sign up for an e-mail service provider such as Constant Contact 
(www.constantcontact.com), Topica (www.topica.com), or Email 
Marketing Solutions (www.lyris.com/solutions/lyris-hq/email-
marketing). These services can handle subscription requests, unsubscribe 
requests, and changes of e-mail addresses, all without needing you to do any-
thing. In addition, most of them offer you the ability to track click-throughs 
on links in your newsletters and track whom you e-mail and when.
 
You can find a few free mailing-list options out there, but most of them involve 
a monthly fee. Shop around to find one that fits your price range.
Track and Customize
What does your community like to read? Do the members like your posts 
about your personal life, or are they more interested in what you’re doing in 
your daily job? Or is it your opinion about some other topic that you’ve dis-
cussed?
Watch to see what element of your content is most popular and what gets the 
most comments and responses. Don’t confuse posts that get responses with 
posts that people like — you want to know what people are interested in and 
willing to comment on, not what they like. Controversial blog posts are most 
likely to generate conversation and feedback.
Knowing what’s popular in your blog can help you when you write later 
on because you can draw on this knowledge to create more posts that get 
responses. Keep an eye on those posts that get lots of comment and under-
stand their appeal to your audience as you make decisions about what to 
post about in the future. You can learn more about understanding your 
audience in Chapter 9, and get some help with content in Chapter 8.
 
Also, pay attention to what posts are unpopular and try to refrain from cover-
ing that content again.
You can also turn this information into additional resources for your readers.
 TechCrunch (www.techcrunch.com), for instance, tracks the posts that 
get the most comments and displays them in an Actively Discussed Posts 
box, which is shown in Figure 19-2. If you assume that the blog posts with the 
most comments are the most interesting, readers can use this box as a short-
cut to find the best content on the blog.

336

that get a

ments.
 
Develop Solutions
Pay attention to what’s going on in your community so that you can find solu-
tions to problems when they arise. Communities grow and change, but they 
don’t thrive unless you resolve issues such as spam or technical problems.
I can’t describe this suggestion very well because each community’s prob-
lems are unique. Just know that you need to keep on top of any problems 
that do come up.
For instance, if your blog readers start complaining about seeing too many 
spam comments on your blog, you need to find and implement some spam 
prevention tools and techniques. If you fail to do so, you risk losing your read-
ers who get frustrated with having to skip every other comment on your blog.
Other possible problem areas might include flame wars between overheated 
readers, slow Web servers, or too long a turnaround between when a reader 

337
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways of Growing Community
submits a comment and when it actually appears on the site. (For the full 
scoop on comments and spam, see Chapter 9.)
Check Your Code and Software
Make your blog accessible to all Web users. Your HTML code needs to be 
flexible enough to display in the many Web browsers out there, and it must 
accommodate browsers used by the blind. Whether you’re keeping the Web-
site design code clean or offering RSS feeds, you’re ultimately responsible in 
making your site work for your readers.
It’s a hard fact to accept, but it’s true: Your blog doesn’t look the same on 
your monitor and in your browser as it does on other computers and in other 
browsers.
Test your designs and test your RSS feeds in as many places as possible. 
Keep checking back to see whether anything changes over time. For instance, 
when Microsoft upgraded the Internet Explorer from version 6 to 7, many 
Web sites experienced display problems that the site owners had to resolve. 
And of course, a blog grows, which means that the load your site puts on 
your Web server changes over time.
Here are some important questions to ask yourself:
 
✓ How does your site behave with 500 blog posts, versus the 10 or 20 you 
started with?
 
✓ Can Google’s newsreader display your RSS feed? What about Bloglines? 
How about . . . you get the picture. Chapter 13 is dedicated to all things 
RSS-related.
 
✓ Does the podcast that you listed with iTunes still appear in their direc-
tory? Can someone subscribe to it? Does iTunes deliver it?
 
✓ Are the images in old blog posts still available and viewable on the site?
 
✓ Do you regularly exceed the bandwidth allowances provided by your 
Web host? Does your site run slowly at certain times of the day?
Changes, no matter how small, in design code or blog software programming 
can have unintended results. Be sure to look at your own blog on several 
computers every few weeks. Try leaving comments, using the search feature, 
clicking links, and generally kicking the tires on a regular basis.

338
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Have Contests
Everyone loves to get free stuff! If traffic is lagging and needs a boost, try 
holding a giveaway or contest to spur more interaction. You could have a 
candy give-away or offer up that rusting Chevy in your backyard. You need to 
make your community members do something in order to get this free stuff 
that you see fit to give away.
By having contests on your blog, you can build your site traffic. You can 
make the contests almost anything: writing contests, reward points for dif-
ferent levels of activity, writing and submitting blog posts, and so on. Hold a 
seasonal contest, such as best costume during Halloween or most romantic 
date idea on Valentine’s Day.
The possibilities are practically endless. Get hokey and create memorable 
contests. Sometimes, the sillier you get, the better the response from your 
readers.
 
If you’re running a business blog, be sure that you understand the legal issues 
surrounding contests; legal requirements can vary state by state, and you 
might have to deal with national laws, as well.
Ask Your Readers
One of the best things that you can do for the community is to make sure 
that everyone’s having the best time they can. How do you know whether 
your readers enjoy their time on your blog? Why not just ask?
Give people a way to let you know whether the community aspects of your 
site work for them by including a Contact Me page. But if you really want to 
hear about how things are going, try just posting a blog entry asking people 
for their thoughts and criticism about what you’re doing.
You likely get great new ideas, as well as help identifying real problems. In 
fact, you can get bonus points from your readers for asking for this kind of 
input.

Ten Cool Tricks for Making 
Your Blog Shine
In This Chapter
▶ Creating badges and widgets for your blog
▶ Tweaking your blog sidebar template
▶ Letting readers subscribe to your blog in a variety of ways
W
hen you’re committed to the blogging lifestyle, the daily grind might 
feel overwhelming at times — writing, tinkering with blog software, 
preparing images, and repeating the process over and over. Luckily for you, a 
slew of Web sites and software can spice things up and banish any boredom 
you’re experiencing, all while attracting new readers to your blog.
These tools are fun to play with. Some help create more links, keep people up 
to date, or just add a little silliness. Others are truly useful services to add to 
your blog. The tools in this chapter help you share your literary and musical 
tastes, take polls, and make your blog look just a little bit better.
Creating Cameo Appearances
One of the really fun things about blogging is experimenting with all the great 
technical goodies that you can put in your blog sidebar. With a little techni-
cal know-how, you can put tons of extra doo-dads and gee-gaws in the side-
bar to let your readers know more about you and your life.
 
All things considered, you may find these tools less than useful if you have a 
business-related blog. These extras are just that — information that might 
dress up your blog but which your readers probably don’t need to have. Still, 
you can have some fun with these tools.

340
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
A few of my favorites include
 
✓ Photos: Love to take photos? Of course, you should be illustrating your 
blog entries with your photos, but why not put a few in your sidebar, 
as well?
 
✓ Books and music: Let your readers know what you’re reading and listen-
ing to. Some tools even let you update a music feed instantly, so your 
readers know what you’re hearing right this minute!
 
✓ Instant updates: Accessorize your blog with a quick update about what 
you’re doing or where you are. A quick notice keeps your readers cur-
rent, even when you don’t have time to write a full blog post.
 
✓ Surveys: Take the pulse of your readers with a quick multiple-choice 
survey.
 
✓ Avatars: You can find some great tools for building avatars — visual 
illustrations of you — that you can then display right in your blog 
sidebar.
Very few blog software packages include the ability to add these kinds of 
elements, so in most cases, you need to know how to edit your templates in 
order to add them. Check your blog software to find out whether you can 
add sidebar elements by using a template editing tool in your software or 
whether you need to get into the template code of your blog.
Fiddling with templates
In general, most nonhosted blog software that you install on your own server 
gives you access to the templates that build your blog. Hosted blog software 
varies: Some offer template access, some offer it when you use a premium or 
paid version, and others don’t offer access at all.
In most cases, adding elements to your sidebar requires that you get your 
hands dirty in the HTML guts of your blog software. You can make these 
changes easily in some blogs and with some struggle in others, and a few 
kinds of blog software make it impossible.
The process of adding a third-party tool — sometimes called a badge or a 
widget — is similar no matter what blog software you use. Just follow these 
basic steps:
 
1. Visit the Web site of the tool that you want to implement and set up 
your account.
 
 Contribute content as required by that Web site.

341
 Chapter 20: Ten Cool Tricks for Making Your Blog Shine
 
2. Look for a link or option that allows you to add the tool to your blog.
 
3. Follow that site’s directions to obtain the HTML code that you need to 
put the tool on your blog.
 
4. Go to your blog’s administrative interface and add the HTML code to 
your template, or use your blog’s tools for adding sidebar elements.
 
5. Go look at your blog and make sure it isn’t broken!
 
 Don’t skip this step — you should always make sure that your blog 
hasn’t been mangled by the new HTML code.
Most blog software runs by using a template of HTML code, so if you add 
your sidebar code to the template, it automatically appears on every page of 
your blog — assuming your software gives you access to the template and 
that you can figure out how to insert the code.
 
Don’t be scared off by the gibberish of HTML, style tags, and blog software 
tags that you see. As long as you don’t delete any of that stuff, you won’t do 
any damage. But just to be safe, copy everything in the template into a text file 
and save it in a safe place on your computer so that you can go back to the 
original code, if necessary.
If your blog software gives you a tool to add elements to the sidebar as part 
of the administrative interface, you’re a lucky devil. This tool makes your life 
a little easier while you customize your blog.
Adding elements with Blogger
Blogger (www.blogger.com) enables you to add elements to your sidebar 
without having to go into the template. Follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to www.blogger.com and click the Layout link for the blog 
that you want to customize.
 
 The Layout tab of your blog administrative panel opens.
 
 If you’re using one of the older Blogger templates, you might see a 
Template link, rather than a Layout link, on the Dashboard.
 
2. Select the Page Elements category.
 
 The Add and Arrange Page Elements page opens.
 
3. Click Add a Gadget.

342
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
 A window opens that contains a lot of page element options. Blogger 
offers quite a few custom sidebar tools as part of its interface, so be sure 
to experiment with these tools if you like adding to your sidebar. For 
example, Blogger has built-in tools for adding polls, photos, link lists, 
RSS feeds, videos, and more.
 
4. Click the Add to Blog button (it looks like a plus sign) below the 
HTML/JavaScript header.
 
 The Configure HTML/JavaScript window opens.
 
5. Give your element a title in the Title field.
 
6. Paste the HTML code for the tool that you want to include into the 
Content field.
 
 You can usually find this HTML on the Web site where you acquire the 
widget you’re adding. I show you some specific examples of tools that 
work this way in the section “Finding Goodies for Your Sidebars,” later 
in this chapter.
 
7. Click Save Changes, as shown in Figure 20-1.
 
 Blogger saves the element and displays it in the Layout view.

343
 Chapter 20: Ten Cool Tricks for Making Your Blog Shine
 
8. If you want to change the order of the elements displayed in your 
sidebar, click and drag the new element to a new position.
 
9. Click Save.
 
10. Click the View Blog link and admire your new sidebar element!
Blogger’s tools might have changed by the time you read this book, so you 
might have to take steps different than the ones I describe in this section.
If you aren’t using Blogger, but you see a tool in your blog software for adding 
sidebar elements, you probably follow a somewhat similar process: After you 
choose an element, you can copy and paste HTML code and choose an order 
for your sidebar elements. Refer to the documentation for your blog software 
for help.
Rounding up the usual suspects
Sidebars usually contain a mix of meat and potatoes features and neat extras. 
Strike a balance on your blog that gives readers the basics and also plays up 
your personality. Figure 20-2 shows the sidebar for the Blissfully Aware blog 
written by Joshua Lane (www.blissfullyaware.com).
Usually, blog software comes with some content already in the sidebar, such 
as links to your categories, archives, and RSS feed. You can include a lot of 
items in your sidebar. The following list discusses common types of sidebar 
content:
 
✓ About Me: You can provide quick bits of information that describe you 
and what your blog is about (refer to Figure 20-2).
 
✓ Archives and categories: You might want to include links to category 
and archive pages so that your readers can quickly get to older content 
(refer to Figure 20-2).
 
✓ Popular blog posts/recent comments: Many blogs display a list of the 
most recent posts or a list of posts that have gotten a lot of comments. 
You can increase traffic on your blog by adding this information because 
other readers will be drawn to see what’s so interesting.
 
✓ Blogroll: Some bloggers include a list of blogs or Web sites that they 
read and recommend to others, which is usually called a blogroll, 
although these lists may include Web sites that aren’t blogs (refer to 
Figure 20-2).
 
✓ Search: If you have a search tool on your blog, be sure to include the 
Search text box and Submit button in your sidebar.

Blogroll
 
✓ Syndication links to RSS feeds: These links let readers subscribe to 
your blog in their newsreaders (refer to Figure 20-2). See Chapter 11 for 
a lot more information about RSS feeds.
 
✓ Navigation: If your blog is part of a larger Web site, you can include 
navigation to that site’s content in your sidebar.
 
✓ Contact information: If you want people to be able to get in touch with 
you, give them quick access to your e-mail address or other contact 
information.
Many of these elements are built in to the templates and layouts provided 
by your blog software. If you don’t see them, check your blog software docu-
mentation to see whether you can turn them on. You may also be able to add 
these elements by using plug-ins.
In the next two sections, I discuss two of the more popular elements of side-
bars: the About Me section and blogrolls.

345
 Chapter 20: Ten Cool Tricks for Making Your Blog Shine
Creating an About Me Section
The sidebar of a blog usually contains what you might call a 10,000-foot view 
of the blog and blogger — that is, a high-level look at what the blog offers 
and what it’s about. Often, these features focus on giving readers information 
about the blogger, from the blogger’s name to what he or she reads, eats, 
likes, and is doing.
When I visit a new blog, I’m always looking for a little context to understand 
what the blog is about and whether I’m interested in reading it, and I check 
the sidebar for information to help me.
 
I know, I know. Putting a little bit of text about you and your blog (often called 
the About Me text) doesn’t seem that exciting. But it’s such a great way to let 
your readers know more about you and why you’re blogging, so I just couldn’t 
leave it out. Frankly, I think the About Me section is the single best way to aug-
ment your site.
The blog So Misguided (www.somisguided.com) has a great example of a 
nice bit of About Me text, which is shown in Figure 20-3. Without this text 
you wouldn’t know, for example, that blogger Monique Trottier lives in 
Vancouver and is a litblogger (someone who blogs about literature) because 
she doesn’t mention those facts in every post. The information here, how-
ever, helps inform new readers while they try to figure out whether So 
Misguided appeals to them. Monique even includes a link to a longer biogra-
phy for readers who just want to know more about her.
A lot of bloggers include contact information and even a photo in their About 
Me text, giving a quick snapshot to readers.

The So 
Misguided 
blog tells 
readers 
about the 
author and 
the subject 
in the 
sidebar.
 

346
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
Keep your About Me section short and sweet, giving readers the skinny in a 
few words. Save the lengthy prose for a blog post. One trick you can use is to 
write a long blog post that includes your bio and other blog details, and then 
link to that post from your sidebar About Me section.
Blogrolling
Blogrolls are common extras that you might want to put in your sidebar. A 
blogroll is a list of blogs and Web sites that you regularly read, especially 
those that you reference when you write your blog. Putting your blogroll in 
your sidebar can give your readers a sense that you aren’t just making up 
stuff off the top of your head, especially if you have an informational blog. 
You may also just want to show your readers any writing that you find inspir-
ing or entertaining.
The blogroll on the Web site for the book Yarn Bombing by Mandy Moore and 
Leanne Prain (www.yarnbombing.com) is shown in Figure 20-4.

347
 Chapter 20: Ten Cool Tricks for Making Your Blog Shine
 
A lot of blog software include built-in methods for adding a blogroll or building 
a list of links, so check whether yours already has the tools you need to add a 
blogroll.
Finding Goodies for Your Sidebars
Now comes the fun part — putting third-party widgets and extras into your 
sidebar. I’m sure you can find a widget to fit your personality and blog, and in 
the following sections, I show you a few of my favorites.
With each of the tools described, you generate HTML code that you need 
to integrate into your blog. After you obtain the code, refer to the section 
“Creating Cameo Appearances,” earlier in this chapter, and follow the instruc-
tions for adding the code to your template or using a layout editing tool in 
your blog software.
Telling others about your photos
These days, everyone’s a photographer, thanks in large part to the relative 
inexpensiveness of digital cameras and the excellent photo-sharing 
and -organizing services available, both for personal computers and online.
Flickr (www.flickr.com) is one of the best of the photo-sharing Web sites, 
and if you haven’t already checked it out, you should do so. Pronto! I’ll wait.
One of the neat tools that Flickr provides is the ability to create a badge to 
put in your blog sidebar. This badge shows your photos, and it automatically 
updates when you add more photos to your Flickr account, so you always 
have the latest photos on your blog. If you like to put photos in your blog 
posts but take many more than you can use in your entries, you can still 
share those photos by using the Flickr badge.
Plus, the badge includes a link to your Flickr photos, so your blog read-
ers can jump over to Flickr and look at all your great photos, regardless of 
whether you decide to put them in your blog.
A small Flickr photo badge in the sidebar of Monique Trottier’s So Misguided 
blog (www.somisguided.com) is shown in Figure 20-5.

348
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 20-5:

After you create a Flickr account and upload some photos, you’re ready to 
create a Flickr badge. Follow these steps:
 
1. After logging in to Flickr, scroll to the bottom of any screen on Flickr 
and choose Tools from the Help navigation bar.
 
2. Click the Hey, Where Is the Badge? link in the right column of the 
Tools page.
 
 The badge creation page loads.
 
3. Select an HTML badge and click the Next: Choose Content button.
 
 The choosing content page loads.
 
 You can also build a Flash badge.
 
4. Click Yours to display your own photos on your blog.
 
5. Choose between displaying all your public photos, photos with a par-
ticular tag, or photos from one of your sets, and then click the Next: 
Layout button.
 
6. Select Yes or No to specify whether to display your Flickr icon and 
screen name in your badge.
 
7. Select how many photos you want to display in your badge from the 
Number of photos drop-down list.
 
8. Choose between your recent photos or a random selection.
 
9. Pick the size of the images you want to display.
 
 You can select Square, Thumbnail, or Mid-Size.

349
 Chapter 20: Ten Cool Tricks for Making Your Blog Shine
 
10. Select the orientation for your badge.
 
 You have the options Horizontal, Vertical, or None.
 
 For most blog sidebars, Vertical is the best orientation to use because it 
creates a tall, thin badge.
 
11. Click the Next: Colors button.
 
 The choosing color page loads.
 
12. Choose the colors that you want to use for the background, border, 
links, and text of your badge by clicking the item that you want to 
change and then selecting a color from the provided palette.
 
 You can use this tool to choose colors that match your blog design.
 
13. Click the Next: Preview & Get Code button.
 
 Flickr shows you the badge you have created, and provides the code 
needed to use it on your blog.
 
14. If you want to make changes to your badge, use the links across the 
top of the page to go back and make changes.
 
15. When you have the badge looking great, copy the code and go back to 
your own blog.
 
 At this point, refer to the “Creating Cameo Appearances” section, earlier 
in this chapter, and follow the instructions for adding the code to your 
template or using a layout editing tool in your blog software.
 
If you want to find out more about using Flickr to put photos into your blog 
posts, be sure to read Chapter 10.
Sharing what you’re reading
Are you an avid reader who always has a batch of books on the go? Do your 
friends constantly ask you for book recommendations or what you’re reading 
right now? Why not share what’s on your bedside table with your blog read-
ers by using a book badge?
A number of good Web sites right now let you create a catalog of your 
book collection, including LibraryThing (www.librarything.com). On 
LibraryThing, after you add books, you can tag them, write reviews, rate 
them, even record when you started and finished the book. Also, you can see 
what others thought of the book. Best of all, you can also use LibraryThing to 
put a badge of what you’re reading on your blog.

350
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
After you sign up for LibraryThing and added some books, follow these steps 
to create the badge, or widget, for your blog:
 
1. Click the Tools navigation item at the top of any LibraryThing page.
 
 In the Tools menu Put LibraryThing on Your Blog is the first item listed.
 
 The widget creation page loads.
 
2. Click the Make a Standard Blog Widget link.
 
 LibraryThing loads the configuration page for the widget.
 
3. Choose a preset style by selecting one of the available layouts from 
the Choose a Preset drop-down list.
 
 LibraryThing previews each style on the right side of the page.
 
 Alternatively, you can customize your widget by selecting from the 
many available style and advanced options.
 
4. Click the Refresh button.
 
 LibraryThing loads the widget into the right side of the page, as shown 
in Figure 20-6.

5. Make any changes that you want to the look of your badge, clicking 
the Make It button to see the updates.
 
6. Copy the HTML code for your badge from the Code box on the page.
 
7. Head back to your own blog to add that code to the sidebar.
 
 If you need help placing the HTML in your blog, see the section 
“Creating Cameo Appearances,” earlier in this chapter.
You can also use the sites BookJetty (www.bookjetty.com) and Goodreads 
(www.goodreads.com) to catalog your existing collection, tag books with 
keywords, rate and review them, and share your collection.
Posting your playlists
If you like to listen to music, you can share your playlists and even the music 
you’re listening to right now with your blog readers. Last.fm (www.last.fm) 
is a music-sharing Web site that lets you do just that.
Sign up for free, and then install a little application on your computer that 
tracks what you’re listening to in your normal music-playing software, shar-
ing that information with the Last.fm Web site. When you install the software, 
it shows a list of available audio-playing software — simply select the one 
that you use to listen to music. Last.fm calls this process audioscrobbling, or 
just scrobbling. While you build your music profile, Last.fm makes recommen-
dations of music you might like, based on the likes of other Last.fm users who 
also listen to the same music.
You can also generate a personal radio station designed to play your favorite 
music with no advertising or DJs.
Last.fm enables you to create a badge for your blog. Follow these steps:
 
1. Login or create an account with Last.fm; then choose Chart Images 
from the Do More menu at the bottom of the home page.
 
 You see the Image charts for forums and blogs page.
 
2. Choose a chart look for your badge by clicking one of the thumbnails 
shown.
 
3. Choose your chart style from the drop-down menu at the top right of 
the page. 
 
 Your options are My Recent Tracks, My Top Weekly Tracks, My Top 
Weekly Artists, My Top Tracks, Track Chart for One of My Groups, and 
Artist Chart for One of My Groups.
 
 Last.fm displays the badge on the right of the page and updates it as you 
make your choices, as shown in Figure 20-7.

4. Select the number of tracks you want to display in your badge from 
the number drop-down menu.
 
 Last.fm refreshes your badge to show the change.
 
5. Copy the code from the MySpace/HTML Code box and go to your blog 
so you can paste it into your sidebar. 
 
 See the section “Creating Cameo Appearances,” earlier in this chapter, 
to find out what to do with the code.
Showing your tweets on your blog
Twitter is a social networking tool that allows individuals (be they bloggers 
or not) to broadcast short messages (or tweets) to fellow Twitterers or to 
the general public. Twitter is all about keeping people updated. People can 
track your updates and subscribe to them through the Twitter Web site 
(www.twitter.com). They can also follow your tweets by using RSS and 
a newsreader. Messages can be informative, entertaining, Web links, dates, 
times, suggestions — just about anything if it fits into 140 characters of 
text. When I looked at Twitter’s home page while writing this book, I found 
tweets about one user’s plan for dinner and a link to a Web site about a 
missing child.

 Chapter 20: Ten Cool Tricks for Making Your Blog Shine
Each time you post a message on the Twitter Web site, several things 
happen:
 
✓ That tweet appears on the Twitter Web site at www.twitter.com.
 
✓ It’s delivered to anyone who follows your tweets via SMS messages to a 
mobile phone or to an e-mail address.
 
✓ It appears in any Twitter badge that you’ve created and placed on your 
blog.
You can post a tweet to Twitter by using e-mail, many instant messenger pro-
grams, or your cell phone. When you put the Twitter badge on your blog, you 
can create very quick updates for your readers, even when you can’t take the 
time for a full blog post.
For a lot more info about Twitter, see Chapter 14.
To put a badge that lists your shared posts on your blog sidebar, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Sign in or create an account on Twitter (www.twitter.com) and click 
the Goodies navigation link at the bottom of any Twitter page.
 
 Twitter loads the Goodies page.
 
2. Click the Widgets item.
 
 The Select Your Widget screen appears.
 
3. Click My Website in the left navigation panel, and then Profile Widget 
from the center of the page.
 
 The Customize Your Profile Widget screen opens.
 
4. Customize the Preferences, Appearance, or Dimensions to suit your 
blog from the navigation menu on the left.
 
 A preview of your badge appears on the right side of the page, as shown 
in Figure 20-8.
 
5. Click Finish & Grab Code when your badge looks the way that you 
want it to.
 
 Twitter displays the code for your badge.
 
6. Copy the code and go to your blog so that you can paste that code into 
your sidebar.
 
 Read the “Creating Cameo Appearances” section, earlier in this chapter, 
to find out how to integrate the code into your blog.

Surveying the Field
Everybody loves to answer polls, so why not add one to your sidebar or even 
a post? You might be able to find out useful information about your read-
ers that you can use in getting advertising for your blog or to inform your 
choices about future blog topics.
You can create a quick multiple-choice question to put in your sidebar by 
using a number of different polling services. Some services require you to 
create an account; some don’t. If you use one that does require registration, 
you can keep track of your polls a little more easily, which is handy if you 
ever need to look at them later.
 
The term poll is used by scientists, media, and mathematicians to describe a 
sampling of a random number of people. By definition, a poll taken by only the 
readers of your blog can’t actually be random. This type of questioning is 
better described as a survey. I’m just saying.
My favorite poll tool is PollDaddy (www.polldaddy.com). You can use 
PollDaddy for free, and after you create an account, you can create multiple 
polls for your blog or Web site, and even choose a variety of formats and 
styles to use with your poll.
After you create a poll, you can insert the HTML code that PollDaddy pro-
vides in your blog sidebar or in a blog entry. (See the section “Creating 
Cameo Appearances,” earlier in this chapter, for details on how to use the 
code it creates.) Then, sit back and wait for the results to roll in. After your 
readers take the poll, they get instant results. After the reader answers the 
survey question, the poll screen changes to show the percentage of answers 
for each choice.

355
 Chapter 20: Ten Cool Tricks for Making Your Blog Shine
One especially nice feature of PollDaddy’s polls is that you can create a poll 
widget specifically for your blog sidebar. Insert the code into your template 
once, and then use PollDaddy to control what poll appears in the widget, 
saving you from having to mess around in your template every time you want 
to change your poll question.
Dressing Up Comments with 
Avatars and Photos
Many blogs encourage visitors and content creators to set up a profile that 
includes basic biographical information and a photo. Some Web users see 
profile creation as a chance to have some fun. Rather than a photo, you can 
use an avatar! An avatar is a visual representation of yourself, often a comic 
or cartoon.
You can use your avatar on any Web site that lets you set an avatar or photo 
for use with a profile, such as Facebook, Digg, Flickr, and so on. And, of 
course, you can use your avatar on your own blog.
The best tool for getting set up with an avatar/photo is Gravatar (www.
gravatar.com). Gravatar is designed to let you set up your photo and 
information once, and then display the photo or image on blogs all over the 
Internet. It all happens automagically!
When you create an account with Gravatar, you have the opportunity to 
upload an image from your computer or point Gravatar to an image that you 
already have online. Gravatar associates that image with an e-mail address, 
and from then on, when you use that e-mail address to leave comments on 
blogs or other Web sites that have Gravatar’s tools implemented, your image 
automatically appears. Update your Gravatar, and the image on those sites 
also updates.
Many Web sites and blogs use Gravatar, but not all. If you register for a social 
network or blog site that lets you create an avatar, you have to follow the 
rules on that site for creating and using an avatar.
Sharing It All
If you spent much time online today, you’ve probably seen the many options 
that Web sites and blogs use today to get you to share their content with 
others. You can share online tidbits by e-mailing them, tweeting them, or 
posting links to the many social networks that have sprung up.

356
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Web site publishers can build links into their stories and content pages that 
allow you to do this sharing with a single click. The point, of course, is two-
fold: The publisher wants you to be able to tell others about interesting Web 
content, as well as drive additional traffic to the site.
Adding sharing tools is an easy step to take when you’re trying to build up 
the number of visitors to a site, but unfortunately, literally dozens of sites are 
devoted to letting people share content, from Facebook to Twitter to Digg. 
Putting those links into your articles can be a big task.
 
ShareThis (www.sharethis.com) has solved the problem, however. Sign up 
with this free service and add the code to your site so that you can quickly 
and easily add all those tools to your site in a single step.
You can see the ShareThis widget implemented on the blog for this book in 
Figure 20-9. Clicking the ShareThis link opens a small window in the page that 
visitors can use to select their sharing technique.
 
Figure 20-9: 
Use 
ShareThis 
as a 
shortcut to 
getting more 
traffic to 
your blog.
 
You can customize the ShareThis widget to match the look of your site, 
and you can control which sharing tools show up in the window. The neat-
est feature, however, is that ShareThis tracks the data of those who use 
the ShareThis tool on your site, so you can find out more about the ways in 
which people share content, as well as which stories or blog posts attract the 
most attention!

Improv Everywhere
www.improveverywhere.com
Improv Everywhere is a blog that documents “scenes of chaos and joy” orga-
nized in New York City public spaces by Charlie Todd. Todd brings together 
volunteers for lighthearted “missions” that take them into public spaces to 
do unexpected activities.
In October 2009, Todd organized a group dog walk. More than 2,000 people 
made the most of the day by taking their furry friends into the streets of 
Brooklyn for about an hour. The catch was — the dogs were all invisible. The 
dog walkers carried leashes and never let on to spectators that there was 
anything peculiar about what was going on. Some onlookers were frustrated 
not to know what was happening, but others played along by asking politely 
about the dog’s breed and petting them. Good fun!
Todd organizes these events irregularly, but they all make great, entertaining 
reading.

Appendix A
Glossary
aggregator: A collector of information about a topic or idea. An aggregator 
can be a person, blog, or Web site. Technologically speaking, RSS is an aggre-
gation format for individual blogs. Google News is an example of a Web site 
that aggregates news for many sources.
audio blog: A blog consisting of audio files, or the practice of placing an 
audio file in a blog post.
blog: A chronological log of information kept by an individual, a group, or 
a business. The term blog is a merging of the words Web and log. On a typi-
cal blog, the most recent post appears at the top of the page, usually time-
stamped. Scrolling down the page takes the reader to older posts. Each post 
usually offers an opportunity for readers to interact by adding their com-
ments and might also display Trackback information about other blogs that 
have linked to this post. Blog content is determined entirely by the author(s) 
of the blog, therefore many are personal journals, but others are focused 
aggregations of news or commentary.
blogger: The author of a blog.
blogging: Producing blog posts. A blogger blogs on his or her blog.
blogosphere: The community of blogs and bloggers around the world.
blogroll: A collection of links used or recommended by an individual blogger. 
A blogroll is usually shown in a column on a blog.
buzz marketing: A no-cost or low-cost method of marketing associated with 
people telling other people about a company’s products or services. Buzz 
marketing is based on peoples’ direct experiences with specific products or 
on the experiences others have related to them.

who’s in your group of friends.
FTP: File Transfer Protocol is the mechanism that allows transfer of files and 
data from one computer to another.
hit: A request to a Web server for a file. When the Web page (which often 
consists of multiple files) is downloaded from a server, the number of hits is 
equal to the number of files requested. Thus, one page view can often equal 
more than one hit, which means that counting the hits is typically an inaccu-
rate measure of Web traffic.
HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the computer coding used by Web 
designers to create Web pages.
hyperlink: See links.
keyword: The content and/or type of meta tag included in a Web page’s 
HTML code to help index the page. The term keyword also refers to terms or

the Internet.
links: A link, or hyperlink, is a navigation tool that allows a user to go from 
one Web location to another by clicking. They’re typically underlined.
meme: Ideas that evolve virally. While bloggers post, comment on other 
blogs, post about posts on other blogs, and add their own thoughts, a meme 
spreads across the Internet, changing while it goes. Some groups spread 
memes consciously by participating in answering a set of questions or post-
ing on a topic, but most memes are a natural byproduct of interesting topics.
meta tag: HTML tags used in a Web page to describe the document to search 
engines. Common tags are title, keyword, and description. Title and descrip-
tion are frequently displayed in search results; keywords are used to deter-
mine when a site should be returned as a search result.
micro blog: A blog composed of extremely brief text or multimedia posts.

RSS: Stands for Really Simple Syndication. An XML-based feed of a blog’s post-
ings that blog aggregation sites or software pick up.
sidebar: A column to the right or left of the main content of your blog. 
Usually, blog software comes with some content already in the sidebar, such 
as links to your categories, archives, and RSS feed. Bloggers can customize 
sidebars with additional common and uncommon elements.
spam: Unsolicited electronic messages sent in bulk that may be commercial, 
nonsensical, or malicious. In addition to creating e-mail spam, spammers can 
target blog comments and blog forums.

syndication: See RSS.
tag: A relevant keyword that’s associated with or assigned to a piece of infor-
mation, such as an image, a blog entry, or a video clip. The content creator or 
online community usually chooses tags informally. Tags help give context to 
nontext media and organize information for easy searching.
tagging: The act of adding tags to a photo, video, audio file, or blog post.
Trackback: A mechanism that tracks references to a blog posting which 
occur on other blogs. Trackbacks are designed to help readers find other 
blogs that discuss the same topic. They also let bloggers know that another 
blogger has blogged about and linked to a post.
troll: A blog reader who posts offensive, personal attacks that interfere with 
the conversation between blogger and readers.
tweet: A post or update on the micro-blogging Web site Twitter.

Appendix B
Basic HTML Code
O
n a blog, code can mean many things. It can refer to the complicated 
programming that makes up the software that runs your blog, or it can 
mean simple styles that make written words look cool when displayed on 
your blog. In this appendix, you can find out how to make the text in your 
blog posts look like a million bucks. (Leave the blogging software code to the 
experts.)
The code that you’re working with affects only a given blog post; the blog 
software itself builds the blog pages. So, you don’t have to know very many 
pieces of code — just the code commonly used to format text and photos, or 
to insert video files.
 
Most of the code that you need to format your blog posts is HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language).
Documents formatted by using HTML really consist of nothing but text, that 
your Internet browser can read and then display. HTML code tells your 
browser all kinds of things, such as how the text on the screen should be 
aligned and what text links to what Web page. You can easily use HTML. With 
a few exceptions, each bit of code, or tag, includes opening and closing ele-
ments, which surround the content that you want to affect. A few tags are 
standalone elements that you insert in only one spot. With HTML, you basi-
cally use code to mark up text, photos, and other elements.
Adding Headings, Paragraphs, 
and Line Breaks
You generally want to break up long blocks of text in your blog posts, maybe 
even throw in labels here and there. Styling headers, adding line breaks, and 
making sure that you divide the text of your blog into paragraphs can really 
improve the flow of your posts.

368
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Headings
HTML has six levels of headings. H1 is the most important and largest, H2 is 
slightly less important and smaller, and so on. The final heading is H6, but 
people rarely use that heading level because it produces very small text. For 
most cases, first- and second-level headers do the job, giving you text larger 
than the main body text (and these headings usually are in bold). You can 
implement header tags by inserting code like this:
<h1>The most important heading ever</h1>
Like a light switch, the tag turns on before the first letter of your header and 
turns off after the last character.
You use all headers in the same way — just substitute in place of the number 
1 a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. For example
<h2>The second most important heading ever</h2>
Figure B-1 shows each of the header tags as the browser interprets and 
displays them.
 
Figure B-1: 
Headers 
from the 
largest to 
the smallest.
 
Headers have more than just an effect on how your text looks: Search engines 
understand that text defined by a header tag is important, so words and 
phrases that you enclose in a header are marked as especially relevant to 
your site, and search engine results lists will place your Web site higher 
when search terms match words in your headers.

369
 Appendix B: Basic HTML Code
Paragraphs
To create paragraph breaks, you need to start the new paragraph with a <p> 
tag. The closing </p> is placed at the end of the paragraph after the text, like 
this (see Figure B-2 for how the browser displays this code):
<p>Paragraph one has amazing text in it.</p>
<p>Paragraph two has amazing text in it, too.</p>
<p>Paragraph three is being neglected by the first and 
second paragraphs.</p>
 
Figure B-2: 
Text 
paragraphs, 
displayed 
by a Web 
browser.
 
Most blogging software makes provision for paragraph breaks automatically, 
but if you ever end up looking at the code, you can recognize these funda-
mentally important tags. On most Web sites, paragraph breaks actually pro-
duce the effect of two line breaks, so paragraphs are spaced out from each 
other in the same way that they are in this book.
You can end a line of text and start the next word on a new line by using a 
<br> tag. You need to insert these standalone tags only once: there is no 
closing tag. To create a line break, here’s what you do:
Break your line of text<br>
and start again on the next line.
Emphasizing Text
Dress up your text by using italics, underlining, bold, or even strikethrough 
code. You can add these text features by using HTML on/off tags, so you 
place the first tag at the start of the text that you want to affect and follow 
the text with the closing tag. Figure B-3 shows how each of the following code 
examples appears in a Web browser.

370
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Here are the codes for each kind of text:
 
✓ Bold: <b> or <strong>
<b>Some of this text</b> is bold.
 
✓ Italics: <i> or <em>
<i>Some of this text</i> is italicized.
 
✓ Underline: <u>
Add punch with an <u>underline</u>.
 
✓ Strikethrough: <strike>
Correct an error <strike>by striking it out</strike>.
 
Even though the preceding list shows you how to underline text in your blog 
posts, I don’t actually recommend that you use this style. As you know, under-
lining commonly indicates links online, so your readers may be very confused 
to see underlined text that isn’t also a link.
 
Figure B-3: 
Use bold, 
italics, 
underlining, 
and strike-
through in 
your HTML 
to make 
your text 
pop.
 
Linking Up
In HTML, links are defined with the <a> tag (the a stands for anchor). But 
that’s not all! This special tag also gets what’s called an attribute and a value, 
to go along with the basic tag. The attribute, href, indicates to the browser 
that what comes next is a hypertext reference — in this case, a Web page. 
The value is the actual Web page that the code links to, enclosed in quotation 
marks. Here’s how all that looks in action:
This link goes to <a href=”http://www.google.com”>Google</a>.
If you post the preceding line in a blog, the word Google appears as a click-
able link that leads to the Google Web site.

371
 Appendix B: Basic HTML Code
 
Make sure that you use the full URL when you create a link — including the 
http://! Unless you include that prefix, the browser doesn’t understand that 
it needs to find another Web site. Instead, it looks for a document on your 
Web site called www.google.com.
Also, when you turn off the tag, you need to turn off only the main tag, not 
the attribute or value. Those extras are turned off automatically when you 
use the closing </a> tag.
You can also use this tag around an image to make the image clickable to a 
Web page. Simply place the tag around your image code, like so:
<a href=”http://www.google.com”><img src=”googlelogo.gif”></a>
Making Lists
Lists can let people know about your favorite kinds of candy, music, or what-
ever. With a little help from your friendly HTML, you can create unordered 
lists or ordered lists. You create all lists, no matter the flavor, by using a 
series of HTML tags. These tags make lists a bit tricky to implement, so pay 
close attention to those closing tags — they’re easy to forget.
An unordered list is a series of bulleted items. You can use this kind of list for 
items that don’t require numbering. For example, if you want to create a list 
of cat breeds, you don’t need to list them in any particular order. Unordered 
lists use the <ul> and <li> tags. Set up the code as I do in this list of kinds 
of chocolate:
<ul>
<li>Milk.</li>
<li>Dark.</li>
<li>White.</li>
</ul>
The <ul> tag stands for unordered list, and it turns on at the beginning of 
the list and turns off following the last item in the list. The <li> tag stands 
for list item; it turns on at the beginning of each new item and turns off at the 
end of that item. Figure B-4 shows an unordered list.
 
Figure B-4: 
Use un-
ordered lists 
to create 
bullet items.
 

372
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
An ordered list contains items that use numbers instead of bullet points and 
are perfect for steps list or creating lists whose contents need to be ranked. 
Format an ordered list just the way you format an unordered list (as dis-
cussed in the preceding section), but substitute the <ol> tag for the <ul> 
tag (see Figure B-5):
<ol>
<li>Get a graham cracker.</li>
<li>Lay on a piece of chocolate.</li>
<li>Add a toasted marshmallow.</li>
<li>Add a second graham cracker on top, squish 
marshmallow, and eat.</li>
</ol>
 
Figure: B-5: 
Ordered 
lists work 
well for 
instructions.
 
You can embed a list inside another list. In fact, you can even embed a differ-
ent kind of list into a list. Each time you embed a new list, the Web browser 
creates additional indenting, giving you a nice stair-stepped look in your 
final page. Here’s how you format the code that places an unordered sub-list 
inside an ordered list in a s’mores recipe:
<ol>
<li>Get a graham cracker.</li>
<li>Lay on a piece of chocolate. It can be:
   <ul>
   <li> Milk</li>
   <li> Dark</li>
   <li> White</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Add a toasted marshmallow.</li>
<li>Add a second graham cracker on top, squish 
marshmallow, and eat.</li>
</ol>
