CHAPTER 1
Stresses and Strains
The subject of mechanics of solids is a study of
i. the behavior of materials under various types of loads and moments, and 
ii. the action of forces and their effects on structural and machine elements 
such as angle irons, circular bars, and beams.
The knowledge thus acquired provides a rational approach to all design 
problems, that is, it helps an engineer to design all types of machines and 
structures and suggest protective measures for the safe working conditions of 
such elements. The analysis, however, assumes that
i. the material of the body is homogeneous and isotropic, and
ii. there are no internal stresses present in the material before the applica­
tion of loads.
1.1. STRESS
Consider an initially straight metallic bar of constant cross-sectional area 
loaded at the ends by a pair of oppositely directed forces or loads. These 
external forces are collinear, coincide with the longitudinal axis of the bar and 
act through the centroid of each cross-section. The bar deforms (undergoes a 
change in length) and this deformation depends upon the external load, cross­
sectional area, and material of the body. While a tensile force will elongate the 
bar and a compressive force will shorten it.

2 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 1.1
The cohesive forces between the molecules 
of the bar offer resistance to change in length, 
and this resistance is due to the strength of 
the bar material. The bar will remain in equi­
librium if the resistance R equals the external 
load P. This implies that section X-X is offering 
the resistance R against a possible separation of 
the segments A and B. The resistance R against 
deformation is called stress.
Presuming resistance to be uniform across 
the section, the resistance per unit area of the section is called the unit stress 
or intensity of stress. Most commonly, the term stress is used to mean inten­
sity of stress:
RP
Stress s = — = — (•.’ R = P).
AA
(1.1)
The units of stress correspond to those of load and area. Stress has the 
dimensions of FL-2 and is usually expressed in N/mm2, N/m2, or Pascal.
1 Pascal = 1 N/m2.
Since Pascal is a very small unit, it is quite common practice to express 
stress in kPa, MPa, or GPa.
1 kPa = 103 Pa, 1 MPa = 106 Pa, and 1 GPa = 109 Pa.
Load and Stress: The external forces acting on any piece of material are 
said to constitute that which is known as a load. It represents the combined 
effect of external forces acting on a body. The resistance offered by the body 
against deformation caused by the load is called stress. The load is applied to 
the body whereas stress is induced in the material of the body.
Stress and Pressure have the same units (N/m2); the difference between 
them is briefly stated below:
•• Stress is encountered in solids. Its magnitude depends upon the direction 
of applied load with respect to the plane passing through the point under 
consideration. This magnitude is different on different planes passing 
through the point considered.
•• Pressure is associated with fluids (liquids and gases) and it represents the 
force exerted per unit area due to the impact of fluid molecules on the 
walls of the container or on the body immersed in a fluid, and its value is 
the same at a point in a fluid.

Cross-sectional Area, A
A structural member is said to be in ten­
sion when it is subjected to two equal and 
opposite pulls (Figure 1.2) and the mem­
ber tends to elongate/increase in length. 
The stress so produced is called tensile 
stress and at any cross-section X-X is given 
as

FIGURE 1.3 Bar in compression.
The hoisting ropes used in cranes and 
passenger elevators are the elements subjected to tensile loading. If the struc­
tural member is subjected to two equal and opposite pushes (Figure 1.3) and 
the member tends to shorten/decrease in length, the member is said to be 
in compression. The stress so produced is called compressive stress and at 
cross-section X-X, it is given as
P
. 
A
s
When a body is acted upon by tensile or P compressive loading, its dimen­
sions will increase or decrease along the line of action of load applied. This 
deformation (change in length) per unit original length is called primary 
strain or longitudinal strain:
Strain = change in length 
original length
dl
e = — 
l
(1.2)
The strain is usually expressed in units of millimeters per millimeter or 
meters per meter and consequently is dimensionless. It is taken positive if 
there is an extension of the bar, and negative if there is shortening.
1.3. ELASTIC LIMIT, HOOK’S LAW, AND MODULUS OF
ELASTICITY
Experimental evidence shows that upon removal of external load, the force of 
resistance vanishes, and the body regains its original shape and size. However, 
such a situation exists only if the external loading is within a certain limit.

4 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The loading limit under which the deformation entirely disappears on 
the removal of load is called the elastic limit. If the loading is large and the 
intensity of stress exceeds the elastic limit, the material gets into the plastic 
stage. Under that condition, the deformation does not entirely disappear and 
a residual deformation stays permanently even on the removal of load.
Hook’s law states that when a material is loaded within the elastic limit, 
stress is directly proportional to strain. Mathematically,
Stress x strain ; s x e
Stress = constant of proportionality x strain,
s stress
or s = E e ; E = — =-------
e strain
(1.3)
where the constant of proportionality E is called Young’s modulus or modulus 
of elasticity. The Young’s modulus has the same units as those of stress (N/m2, 
Pa, kPa, and MPa) because the strain is a dimensionless quantity.
Young’s modulus is a property of the material, and its value is indepen­
dent of the magnitude of force, the geometrical configuration of the body, 
and the type of loading (tension or compression). For common engineering 
materials, Young’s modulus of elasticity is

1.4. STRESS-STRAIN DIAGRAM
Stress-strain curve is a graphical plot of stress versus strain. These quantities 
are experimentally obtained by subjecting a metallic bar of a uniform cross­
section to a gradually increasing tensile load until failure of the bar occurs. 
The test is conducted in a tensile testing machine on a test specimen having 
the appearance/configuration as shown in Figure 1.4. The specimen has col­
lars provided at both ends for gripping it firmly in the fixtures of the machine.

8 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 1.4 Test specimen.
The central portion of the test spec­
imen is somewhat smaller than the 
end regions, and this central section 
constitutes the gauge length over 
which elongations are measured. An 
extensometer (dial gauge) is used to 
measure very small changes in length. After that vernier scale on the machine 
is used to measure extension. Load and extension are simultaneously recorded
till the specimen breaks.
Stress is calculated by dividing the load by the original cross-sectional area 
of the test specimen. Strain is calculated by dividing the extension of a given 
length (gauge length) by the original unstrained length. That is

where l is the gauge length 
and A is the original cross­
sectional area.
Stress-strain curve 
is then plotted by having 
obtained numerous pairs of 
values of stress and strain; 
stress plots as ordinate and 
strain as abscissa on a graph 
taking suitable scale.
Figure 1.5 shows the typ­
ical behavior of stress-strain 
curve for mild specimen and 
its salient features are:
• 
• Proportional limit: Stress is a linear function of strain and the material 
obeys Hook’s law. This proportionality extends up to point A and this point 
is called proportional limit or limit of proportionality. 0-A is a straight­
line portion of the curve and its slope represents the value of modulus of 
elasticity.
• 
• Elastic limit: Beyond the proportional limit, stress and strain depart 
from straight-line relationship. The material, however, remains elastic up 
to state point B. The word elastic implies that the stress developed in the 
material is such that there is no residual or permanent deformation when 
the load is removed. Yet, the deformation is reversible or recoverable.

Stresses and Strains • 9
Stress a
FIGURE 1.6
Stress at B is called the elastic limit stress; this represents the maximum 
unit stress to which a material can be subjected and is still able to return 
to its original form upon removal of load.
• 
• Yield point: Beyond elastic limit, the material shows considerable strain 
even though there is no increase in load or stress. This strain is not fully 
recoverable, that is, there is no tendency of the atoms to return to their 
original positions. The behavior of the material is inelastic, and the onset 
of plastic deformation is called the yielding of the material. Yielding per­
tains to the region C-D and there is a drop in load at point D. Point C is 
called the upper yield point, and point D is the lower yield point. The dif­
ference between the upper and lower yield point is small and the quoted 
yield stress is usually the lower value.
• 
• Ultimate strength or tensile strength: After yielding has taken 
place, the material becomes strain hardened (strength of the specimen 
increases) and an increase in load is required to take the material to its 
maximum stress at point E. Strain in this portion is about 100 times than 
that of the portion from 0 to D. Point E represents the maximum ordinate 
of the curve and the stress at this point is known either as ultimate stress 
or the tensile stress of the material.
• 
• Breaking strength: In the portion EF, there is falling off the load (stress) 
from the maximum until fracture takes place at F. Point F is referred to as 
the fracture or breaking point and the corresponding stress is called the 
breaking stress.
The apparent fall in stress from E to F may be attributed to the fact that 
stress calculations are made on the basis of the original cross-sectional area. 
In fact elongation of the specimen is accompanied by a reduction in cross­
sectional area and this reduction becomes significant near the ultimate stress. 
In case stress calculations are based on actual area, the curve would be seen 
to rise until a fracture occurs. For mild steel, the test piece 
breaks making a cup and cone type fracture; the two pieces 
can be joined together to find out the diameter (actual area) 
at the neck under the specimen breaks.
For many ductile materials other than mild steel, for 
example, aluminum and copper, no definite yield point is 
obtained. For such materials, the strain-strain curve plots 
are shown in Figure 1.6.
For brittle materials, like cast iron, no appreciable deformation is obtained 
and the failure occurs without yielding (Figure 1.7).

Proof stress: Quite often it is desired to determine the stress at which
a specified permanent extension takes place in a tensile test. The exten-
sion specified is usually 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5% of gauge length. Such a stress is
known as proof stress.
For determining 0.2% proof stress from stress­
strain curve, a point G representing 0.2%, that 
is, 0.002 is marked on the strain axis. A line GH 
is then drawn parallel to the initial slope line 
OA. The stress at the point where this line cuts 
the curve is 0.2% proof stress.
Working stress and safety factor: Working
stress is the allowable stress for design purposes. 
FIGURE 1.7
During the design of an element, it is to 
be kept in mind that actual stress devel­
oped in the element does not exceed 
the working stress. Frequently, such a 
stress is determined by dividing either 
the yield stress or the ultimate stress by 
a number termed the safety factor.
The safety factor accounts for 
internal flows in the material,
FIGURE 1.8
stress concentration, and
uncertainties about the magnitude and
nature to which the machine element is subjected, etc.
The value of safety factor depends upon the judgment and experience of
the designer and is usually governed by:
•
•
•
•
•
• 
type of loading,
• 
reliability of material and manufacturing processes such as castings and 
forgings, and
• 
the extent of damage that will be caused if the machine element fails. 
The allowable or working stress used in design calculations is taken as
ultimate stress

Material Classification: Materials are commonly classified as:
i. Homogeneous and isotropic materials: A homogeneous material implies 
that the elastic properties such as modulus of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio 
of the material are the same everywhere in the material system. Isotropic

Stresses and Strains • 11
means that these properties 
are not directional charac­
teristics, that is, an isotropic 8 
material has the same elastic S 
properties in all directions at 
any one point of the body.
Strain
ii. Rigid and linearly elastic 
materials: A rigid material is 
one that has no strain regard­
less of the applied stress. A 
linearly elastic material is one 
in which the strain is propor­
tional to the stress.
iii. Plastic and rigid-plastic 
materials: For a plastic 
material, there is definite 
stress at which plastic defor­
mation starts. A rigid-plastic

material is one in which elastic and time-dependent deformations are 
neglected. The deformation remains even after the release of stress (load).
iv. Ductile and brittle materials: A material that can undergo “large perma­
nent” deformation in tension, that is, it can be drawn into wires is termed 
as ductile. A material that can be only slightly deformed without rupture 
is termed as brittle.
The ductility of a material is measured by the percentage elongation of 
the specimen or the percentage reduction in the cross-sectional area of the 
specimen when a failure occurs. If l is the original length and l‘ is the final 
length, then
l ‘-1
% increase in length = —-— x 100.
The length l‘ is measured by putting together two portions of the frac­
tured specimen.
Likewise, if A is the original area of cross-section and A‘ is the minimum 
cross-sectional area at fracture, then
A - A
% age reduction in area = ——— x 100.

12 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
A brittle material like cast iron or concrete has very little elongation and 
very little reduction in cross-sectional area. A ductile material like steel or 
aluminum has a large reduction in area and an increase in elongation. An 
arbitrary percentage elongation of 5% is frequently taken as the dividing line 
between these two classes of material.
EXAMPLE 1.6
The following data were recorded during tensile test made on a stand­
ard tensile test specimen:
Original diameter and gauge length = 15 mm and 60 mm; mini­
mum diameter at fracture = 10 mm; distance between gauge points 
at fracture = 75 mm; load at yield point and at fracture = 40 kN and 
45 kN; and maximum load that specimen could take = 70 kN.
Make calculations for (a) yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, 
and breaking strength, (b) percentage elongation and percentage 
reduction in the area after fracture, and (c) nominal and true stress 
and fracture.
Solution: Original area, A0 = p(15)2 = 176.625 mm2.
Final area, Af = p (10)2 = 78.5 mm2 (at fracture).
(a) Yield strength = 40 х Ю = 226.47 N/mm2

Breaking strength = ——= 254.78 N/mm2

1.6. EXTENSION OF BAR DUE TO SELF-WEIGHT
1.6.1. Bar of Uniform Section
Consider a bar of cross-sectional area A and 
length l hanging freely under its own weight 
(Figure 1.13). Let attention be focused on a 
small element of length dy at distance y from 
the lower end. If w is the specific weight 
(weight per unit volume) of the bar mate­
rial, then total tension at section m-n equals 
the weight of the bar for the length y and is 
given by
P = w A y. 
(1.9)
As a result of this load, the elemental 
length dx elongates by a small amount Dx, and

applied at its end.

Determine the greatest length of mild steel wire of uniform cross­

to exceed 250 MN/m2. Given gravitational acceleration g = 9.81 m/s2 
and density of steel q = 7.85 X 103 kg/m3.

Stresses and Strains • 19
Solution: The maximum tension, that is, tensile force in the wire occurs at 
the suspension point and it equals the total weight of the suspended wire. If 
the cross-sectional area and the length of the wire are represented by A (m2) 
and l (m), respectively, then
Maximum tensile force, P = w A l = r g A l = (7.85 x 103 x 9.81) Al (N).

a. the elongation of the wire due to self-weight,
b. the total elongation when a weight of 200 N is attached to its 
lower end, and
c. the maximum weight which this wire can support at its lower end

1.7. PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION
Quite often a machine member is subjected to a number of forces acting on 
its outer edges (ends) as well as at some intermediate sections along its length. 
The forces are then split up and their effects are considered on individual 
sections. The resulting deformation is then given by the algebraic sum of the 
deformation of the individual sections. This is the principle of superposition 
which may be stated as
“The resultant elongation due to several loads acting on a body is the alge­
braic sum of the elongations caused by individual loads”
Or
“The total elongation in any stepped bar due to a load is the algebraic sum 
of elongations in individual parts of the bar”
Mathematically d l = ^ d l,.

Two prismatic bars are rigidly fastened together and support a vertical

a mass density of 7750 kg/m3, length of 10 m, and cross-sectional area

length of 6 m, and cross-sectional area of 50 cm2. Determine the maxi­

Eb = 100 GN/m2.
Solution: Refer to Figure 1.16. The maximum stress in the brass bar occurs 
at junction BB, and this stress is caused by the combined effect of 45 kN load 
together with the weight of brass bar:

1.9. STRESSES IN COMPOSITE BARS
Quite often it becomes necessary to have a compound tie or strut (column) 
where two or more material elements are fastened together to prevent their 
uneven straining. The salient features of such a composite system are:

Stresses and Strains • 33
•• The system extends (or contracts) as one unit when subjected to tensile 
(or compressive) load. This implies that the deformation (extension or
contraction) of each element is the same.
•• Strain, that is, deformation per unit length 
of each element is the same.
•• Total external load on the system equals the 
sum of loads carried by the different mate­
rials comprising the composite system.
Consider a composite bar subjected to load 
P and fixed at the top as shown in Figure 1.27. 
Total load is shared by the two bars and as such

the length of each copper rod is 2 m. If the mod­
ulus of elasticity of steel is twice that of copper, 
make calculations for the stress induced in each 
rod. It may be presumed that each rod deforms

the middle of the beam. The beam is rigid and the 
wires are of the same length and unstressed before 
the beam is attached. Determine the stress induced 
in each of the wires. Take Young’s modulus for brass

Stress and strain produced by a force tangential to the surface of a body are 
known as shear stress and shear strain, respectively.

jected to tangential force P at the upper plane. Then

Reaction at the bottom plane will be equal and 
opposite to the applied force P.
The distinction between normal stress and 
shear stress in one of direction becomes apparent 
if we consider a bar cut by a plane perpendicular 
to its axis. Whereas the normal stress s n is perpen­
dicular to this plane, the shear stress t acts along 
the plane.
The common examples of a system involving 
shear stress are riveted and welded joints, towing 
devices, punching operations, etc.

The ratio of the shear stress to the shear strain is called modulus of rigid­
ity or modulus of elasticity in shear and is usually denoted by C.
Since shear strain is dimensionless, the units of modulus of rigidly are the 
same as those of shear stress, for example, N/m2 and GPa.

A single riveted lap joint as shown in Figure 1.35 is to transmit a force, 
P = 5 kN. Calculate the shear stress acting on the rivet at the junction 
where the rivet tends to shear. Take rivet diameter, d = 12.5 mm.

1.11. COMPLIMENTARY SHEAR STRESS
Consider a rectangular block ABCD subjected to shear stress of intensity t at 
the forces AB and CD (Figure 1.37a).
If the block has unit thickness perpendicular to the plane of the paper, then 
shear forces acting on these faces will be t x AB or t x DC. These forces 
constitute a couple of moment
= force x perpendicular distance
= (t x AB) x BC or (t x DC) x BC.
This couple tends to rotate the block in the clockwise direction. To keep 
the block in equilibrium, shear stress t‘ must act on the other two faces of 
the block. The direction of these stresses has to be such that these provide

Stresses and Strains • 41

FIGURE 1.37.
an equal but opposite couple (Figure 1.37b). Thus, under 
equilibrium conditions
(t x AB) x BC = (t‘ x BC) x AB; t‘ = t.
The stress t‘ is called complimentary shear stress. 
Thus, if a rectangular or square block is in equilibrium, 
shear stress in one plane is accompanied by equal compli­
mentary shear stress in the other plane. The state of shear 
depicted in Figure 1.37(b) is called Simple or pure shear 
as no other type of stress is acting.
Let attention be focused on a cubical element ABCD 
of each side l (Figure 1.38). The block is in simple shear, 
that is, the faces AB and CD are subjected to shear stress 
of intensity t, whereas the faces DA and BC are subjected 
to complimentary shear stress t‘ of equal magnitude.
Considering equilibrium of the free-body diagram of
the triangular portion ABD, Shear forces on face DA =

The above analysis shows that when an element is in a state of simple 
shear, tensile (along diagonal AC) and compressive (along diagonal BD) 
stresses are equal in magnitude to the shear stress that act on planes inclined 
at 45° compared to the planes of simple shear.
1.12. HYDROSTATIC STRESS, VOLUMETRIC STRAIN, AND 
BULK MODULUS
When a body is immersed in a fluid to a large depth, the body gets subjected 
to equal external pressure at all points on the body. This external pressure is 
compressive in nature and is called hydrostatic stress.
The hydrostatic stress causes a change in the volume of the body, and this 
change of volume per unit volume is called a volumetric strain, e u.
Д V
eu = V'
Consider a cuboid of sides x, y, and z subjected to hydrostatic stress and 
let its sides change by dx, dy, and dz, respectively. Then change in volume,
DV = (x + dx) (y + dy) (z + dz) — xyz.
Neglecting product of small changes,
DV = (x y z + x y dz + y z dx + x z dy) — x y z
= y z dx + x z dy + x y dz.

Apparently, volumetric strain equals the sum of the linear normal strains 
in x, y, and z directions.
Within elastic limits, the hydrostatic stress is directly proportional to vol­
umetric strain. Mathematically,

Stresses and Strains • 43
hydrostatic stress x volumetric strain
= constant of proportionality x volumetric strain
or
s v = K e v ; K = sv.
(1.21)
The constant of proportionality K is called the bulk modulus or modulus of 
volume expansion of the material. Physically, the bulk modulus K is a measure 
of the resistance of a material to change of volume without change of shape 
or form.
EXAMPLE 1.31
A solid steel cube of 1 m side is immersed in water to a depth of 600 
m. Make calculations for the decrease in the length of its sides and in 
its volume. For steel, the bulk modulus is 135 GPa and for water, mass 
density is 1000 kg/m3.
Solution: Hydrostatic pressure at 600 m depth is
sv = w h = r g h
= 1000 x 9.81 x 600 = 5.886 x 106 N/m2.

normal strains in x, y, and z directions. That is

1.13. POISSON’S RATIO
When a rectangular bar is subjected to tensile load along a longitudinal dimen­
sion, it not only elongates but simultaneously there also occurs shortening in 
its breadth and thickness. Likewise, when tensile force is applied to a circular 
bar of uniform diameter, there occurs a simultaneous increase in length and 
shortening of diameter.
The strain in the direction of applied load is called longitudinal or pri­
mary strain and the strain in the perpendicular (transverse) direction is called 
lateral or secondary strain: Thus for a rectangular bar of length l, breadth b, 
and thickness t, the longitudinal strain is d l/l and the lateral strain is d b/b 
and d t/t. For a circular bar of length l and diameter d, the longitudinal strain 
equals d l/l and the lateral (diametral) strain is d d/d. It is to be noted that the 
longitudinal and the lateral strains are of opposite nature.
FIGURE 1.39.
When the deformation of the bar is within the elastic limit, the ratio of 
the lateral strain to the longitudinal strain is constant for a given material. This 
ratio is called Poisson’s ratio and is denoted by m. The value of m lies between 
0.25 and 0.33 for most of the engineering materials.
EXAMPLE 1.3 2
During the compression test, a metallic bar of 50 mm X 50 mm in 
cross-section was subjected to an axial compressive load of 500 kN. 
Measurements showed that there was a 0.04 mm increase in thickness 
and 0.5 mm contraction in length over a gauge length of 200 mm. 
Determine the values of Poisson’s ratio and modulus of elasticity.

to this shearing load:

faces DC and AB.
• • Complimentary shearing stress of 
the same magnitude is set up on the

• • The block distorts to a new configu­

1.15. TEMPERATURE STRESSES
When a member is subjected to temperature variations, its dimensions get 
changed. There occurs expansion, that is, an increase in dimensions when 
temperature increases. Conversely, with a fall in temperature, contraction 
occurs and dimensions of the member decrease. The change in length due to 
temperature variation is given by
dl = l a Dt, 
(1.32)
where l is the length of the member, a is the coefficient of thermal expansion, 
and Dt is the change in temperature. Then
thermal strain

If expansion is allowed to take place freely 
[Figure 1.43(a)], there occurs only thermal 
strain and no stresses are developed in the
FIGURE 1.43.
material of the member. However, if the ends 
of the member are fixed to rigid supports,
that is, the member is not allowed to expand [Figure 1.43(b)], compressive 
stresses are developed in the material. Such stresses are known as thermal or
temperature stresses:
thermal stress = modulus of elasticity x thermal strain
= E a Dt.
(1.34)
If the end supports yield by an amount d, then net elongation is (l a Dt - d ). 
Accordingly
thermal strain = la Дt - d 
l
(1.35)
normal thermal stress = E(la Дt - d
I l
(1.36)
Note: The temperature strains and stresses due to temperature rise are com­
pressive in nature, and due to fall in temperature are tensile.
1.15.1. Effect of temperature change in a composite bar
Consider the temperature rise of a composite bar consisting of two members; 
one of steel and the other of brass rigidly fastened to each other. If allowed to 
expand freely:
expansion of brass bar: AB = l ab Dt, 
expansion of steel bar: AC = l as Dt.
Since the coefficient of thermal expansion of brass is greater than that of
steel, the expansion of brass will be more.
FIGURE 1.44.
But the bars are fastened together and 
accordingly both will expand to the same final 
position represented by DD with a net expan­
sion of composite system AD equal to dl. To 
attain this position, the brass bar is pushed 
back and the steel bar is pulled. Obviously, 
compressive stress will be induced in the brass
bar and tensile stress will be developed in the steel bar. Under equilibrium 
state compressive force in brass = tensile force in steel
sc Ac = ss As.

It may be pointed out that the nature of the stresses in the bars will get 
reversed if there is a reduction in the temperature of the composite system.

A 30 m length of the railway is to be so laid that there is no stress in 
the rails at 10°C. Determine the stress induced in the rails at 60°C if
(i) there is no allowance for expansion;
(ii) there is an expansion allowance of 8 mm per rail;
(a) 
what should be the expansion allowance if the stress in the 
rail is to be zero at 60°C temperature?;
(b) what is the maximum allowable temperature to have no stress 
in the rails if expansion allowance is 12 mm per rail?
Take E = 2 X 105 N/mm2 and ' = 12 X 10-6/°C.
Solution: Increase in length due to rise in temperature

EXAMPLE 1.4 2
A steel bar of 30 mm uniform diameter is heated to 75°C and then 
clamped at ends with the help of two fixtures 3.5 m apart and left 
to cool to room temperature of 20°C. At that instant, the distance 
between the fixtures was found to be 1 mm shorter than that at 75°C. 
Determine the stress in the bar when it has cooled down to room tem­
perature and the reaction at the fixtures.
Take, Es = 210 GN/m2 and 's = 1.1 X 10-5°C.
Solution: Free contraction (decrease in length) due to temperature drop
dl = l a Dt = 3500 X 1.1 X 10-5 X (75 - 20) = 2.1175 mm.
The decrease of 1 mm distance between the fixtures amounts to contrac­
tion (yielding) allowed:

CHAPTER 2
Shear Force and Bending Moment
A beam is a structural member of which longitudinal dimension is large com­
pared to the transverse dimension. The beam is supported along its length 
and is acted upon by a system of loads at right angles to its axis. Due to exter­
nal loads and couples, shear force and bending moment develop at any section 
of the beams. For the design of beams, information about the shear force and 
bending moment are desired. Accordingly, it is appropriate to learn about the 
variation of shear force and bending moment along the length of the beam.

to supports and for equi­
librium conditions:
Ra + Rb = W1 + W2 + W3 = 30 + 20 + 20 = 60 kN.
Also E Ma (moments about support A) = 0. That gives
Rb x 7 = 10 x 5 + 20 x 3 + 30 x 1 = 140
140
Rb = — = 20 kN and Ra = 60 - 20 = 40 kN.

Imagine the beam to be cut at an 
arbitrary section xx at distance x = 4 m 
from the end A and draw separately the 
free-body diagrams of the two portions 
(Figure 2.2).

on each portion of the beam, the 
net resultant vertical forces are

FIGURE 2.2.
Fleft = 30 + 20 - 40 = 10 kN
Fright = 10 - 20 = -10 kN
(downward) 
(upward)
It is to be noted that forces on the left and right sides of section xx are 
equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
Obviously, section xx is subjected to a force of 10 kN which is trying to 
shear the beam. The force of 10 kN is called as shear force at section xx.
“Shear force at a section in a beam is the force that is trying to shear off 
the section. It is obtained as algebraic sum of all the forces acting normal to 
the axis of beam; either to the left or to the right of the section.”
•• Considering equilibrium of moments on each portion of the beam:
M left = 40 X 4 - 30 X 3 - 20 x 1 = 50 kNm
M right = 20 x 3 - 10 x 1 = 50 kNm
(clockwise) 
(anti-clockwise)
It is to be noted that moments on the left and right sides of section xx are 
equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Obviously, section xx is acted 
upon by a moment of 50 kNm. Since this moment is trying to bend the beam, 
it is called the bending moment.
Bending moment at a section in a beam is the moment that tends to bend
the beam and is obtained as algebraic sum of moment of all the forces about
the section, acting either to the left or to the right of the section.
Sign Conversion: The following sign con­
ventions are normally adopted for the shear 
force and bending moment.
i. 
Shear force is taken positive if it tends to 
move the left portion upward with respect 
to the right portion.
+ ve SF 
- ve SF
FIGURE 2.3.
ii. Bending moment is taken positive if it tends to sag (concave upward) the 
beam, and it is taken negative if it tends to hog (concave down) the beam.
The shear force and bending moment vary along the length of the beam, 
and this variation is represented graphically. The plots are known as shear

grams, the abscissa indicates the position of the section 
along the beam, and the ordinate represents the value 
of SF and BM, respectively. These plots help deter­

The shear force and the bending moment that develop at any cross section of 
the beam depending on the types of beams and the types of loads acting on 
them.
Beam is generally classified as follows:
• • Cantilever beam (Figure 2.5a): A beam having its one end fixed or built-in 
and the other end free to deflect. There is no deflection or rotation at the 
fixed end.
• • Fixed beam (Figure 2.5b): A beam having both of its ends fixed or built-in.
• • Simply supported beam (Figure 2.5c): A beam made to freely rest on sup­
ports which may be knife edges or rollers. The term “freely supported” 
implies that these supports exert only forces but no moments on the beam. 
The horizontal distance between the supports is called span.
• • Overhanging beam (Figure 2.5d): A beam having one or both ends extended 
over the supports. The end portion or portions extend in the form of can­
tilever beyond the 
support/supports.
• • Continuous beam 
(Figure 2.5e): A 
beam provided 
with more than 
two supports. Fur­
ther such a beam 
may or may not 
have overhang.
The different types 
of loads acting on a 
beam are as follows:
• • Concentrated load: The load acts at a point on the beam. This point

FIGURE 2.7.
Consider a beam subject to any type of transverse load of the general form 
shown in Figure 2.7. From the beam, an element of length dx at a distance x from 
left end is isolated and its free body diagram is drawn as shown in Figure 2.7. 
Since the element is of extremely small length, the loading over the beam can 
be considered to be uniform and equal to w kN/m. The element is subject to 
shear force F on its left­
hand side and shear force 
(F + dF) on its right-hand 
side. Further, the bend­
ing moment M acts on 
the left side of the ele­
ment and it changes to 
(M + dM) on the right 
side.
Taking moments about point C on the right side,
L Mc = 0: 
M — (M + dM) + F x dx - (w x dx) x — = 0.
c2
The udl is considered to be acting at its CG
dM = Fdx - wdxL = o.
2
The last term consists of the product of two differentials and can be
neglected.
dM = Fdx or F = — 
dx
Thus, the shear force is equal to the rate of change of bending moment with 
respect to x. Applying the condition L Fy = 0 for equilibrium, we obtain

That is the intensity of loading is equal to rate of change of shear force 
with respect to x.
2.4. SHEAR FORCE AND BENDING MOMENT DIAGRAMS
FOR A FEW STANDARD CASES
The method of drawing shear force and bending moment diagrams for a few 
standard cases is explained below.
2.4.1. Cantilever Subjected to Concentrated Load at Free End
Consider a cantilever of length l carrying weight W at its free end.
At a section x-x at any distance x from the free end.
Shear force E F = - W

beam moves downward.

ii. does not vary with x and has a constant 
value (equal to load W) throughout the 
beam length
Bending moment BM = -Wx 
Apparently the bending moment
i. 
is negative as it tends to hog the beam 
(concave downward)
ii. has a linear variation with distance x 
from the free end.

At x = l BM = -W l.
Thus, bending moment diagram is a straight line which gives maximum 
value at the fixed end.

2.4.2. Cantilever Subjected to udl Over its Entire Span
Consider a cantilever of length l carrying uniformly distributed load of inten­
sity w/unit length over the entire span.
At a section x-x at any distance x from the free end,
Shear force SF = -wx.
Apparently the shear force
i. 
is negative as the left segment of the beam moves downward
ii. has a linear variation with distance x from the free end
At x = 0 SF = 0
At x = l SF = -wl.
Thus, the SF diagram is a straight line with 
maximum value at the fixed end.

The magnitude of BM has a faster variation with x and accordingly its 
variation conforms to concave parabola.

2.4.3. Simply Supported Beam Subjected to Concentrated Load
Consider a simply supported beam AB with span l and subjected to a concen­
trated load W at a point C that lies at distance a from the left and support A.

2.4.4. Simply Supported Beam Subjected to udl Over its Entire Span
Consider a simply supported beam of span l carrying uniformly distributed 
load of intensity w/unit length over the entire span.
Because of symmetrical loading, each vertical reaction is equal to half the 
total load on the span. That is

A reduction in the 
value of BM becomes 
faster as x increases, and 
accordingly the bending 
moment variation con­
forms to convex parabola. 
Further, it is to be noted 
that maximum bending 
moments occurs at the 
mid-span where shear 
force is zero.
EXAMPLE 2. 1
Draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam
loaded and supported as shown in 
Figure 2.12.
Solution: The line of action of the reac­
tion will be at right angles to the roller 
base at end A. The reaction at a hinge 
can have two components acting in the 
horizontal and the vertical directions.
FIGURE 2.12.
Since there is no horizontal external force acting on the beam, the reaction at 
the hinged end B will be only in the vertical direction.
Due to symmetry of loading,
R = Rb = 10+10 = 10 kN.

Solution: A point of contraflexure is a point where bending moment is zero.

Apparently there is a point of contraflexure between A and C as bending

Bending moment at x between A and C with x measured from D
Mx = -4(x - 1) + 9.25(x - 2) = 5.25x - 14.5

Bending Moment:
Portion CA: BM at point C = 0

The bending moment from 0 at A and - 4 kNm at B will have linear vari­

At point A, x = 1 m
and BM = 14 x 1 - 18 - 6(1 - 1)2 = -4 kNm.
The bending moment at x = 2.166 m (point E)
= 14 x 2.166 - 18 - 6(2.166 - 1)
At point B, x = 4 m
and BM = 14 x 4 - 18 - 6(4 - 1)2 = -16 kNm.
The variation of bending moment from -4 kN m at point A to -16 kN m 
at point B will be parabolic as there is udl in this segment.
Portion BD: As there is 
no loading in this section, the 
bending moment will have a 
linear variation and it will rise 
from -16 kNm at point B to 
zero at end point D.
The variations is shear force 
and bending moment for the 
entire beam, which are shown 
in Figure 2.33.
Points of Contraflexure: The
FIGURE 2.33.
bending moment is zero at the 
points of contraflexure.
Since the bending moment changes sign in portion AB, the location of 
the points of contraflexure can be determined by setting expression (i) equal 
to zero. That is
14x - 18 - 6(x - 1)2 = 0.
Upon simplification: 3x2 - 13x + 12 = 0
The solution of this quadratic equation gives
x = 13 + J (—13)2 — 4 x 3 x 12 = 13±5 = 3m and 1.33 m,

Thus, the points of contraflexure are located at 1.33 m and 3 m from the 
end point C.

Solution:

ii. No variation in SF for the 
span AC = 3 m suggests 
that there is no load on

iv. No variation in SF for the span CD = 2 m suggests that there is no load on 
the beam in this region.
v. 
Since SF changes linearly from 9.5 kN to -40.5 kN in span DB of beam, 
there should be a uniformly distributed load in this region.

EXAMPLE 2.16
The bending moment diagram of a simply supported beam is given

Solution:
i. Linear variation of bending moment in

that there is no load on the beam in these

ii. Change in the slope of the bending

Considering equilibrium of forces in the vertical directions,
Ra + Rb = Wc + Wd

CHAPTER 3
Internal Combustion Engines
3.1. HEAT ENGINES
A machine or device which derives heat from the combustion of fuel and con­
verts part of this energy into mechanical work is called a heat engine. Heat 
engines are broadly classified into internal combustion engines and external 
combustion engines.
An internal combustion engine is a reciprocating heat engine in which fuel 
mixed with the correct amount of air is burned inside a cylinder. The gaseous 
products of combustion form the working substance which makes the piston 
move and produces mechanical work at the engine crankshaft. In contrast, 
the combustion of fuel in steam engines is external. Combustion takes place 
on the fire grate of the boiler, and the heat energy of fuel, thus, released is 
used to convert water into steam. The steam is then led to the steam engine 
or steam turbine where work is produced. Obviously, the working substance 
(steam) is generated in a boiler that is outside the power-producing device.
Compared to steam engines, the IC engines are noted for
— high overall efficiency: the efficiency of IC engines ranges from 30 to 35% 
whereas the efficiency of steam engines lies between 15 and 20%,
— compact and small size,
— 
low weight to power ratio,
— easy and quick starting: in steam engines, firing of the boiler and generation of 
steam takes sufficient time, and
— less maintenance and operating costs.

108 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The important applications of IC engines are as follows:
• 
• road vehicles, locomotives, ships, and aircraft. As such IC engines enable 
passengers and cargos to cross lands, oceans, and skies,
• 
• portable stand by units for power generation in case of scarcity of electric 
power, and
• 
• extensively used in farm tractors, lawn movers, concrete mixing devices, 
and motorboats.
3.2. CLASSIFICATION OF IC ENGINES
The IC engines are classified on the basis of the following systems and their 
variations:
•• Number of strokes required for the completion of one cycle
i. Two-stroke engines in which the engine cycle is completed in two 
strokes of the piston, that is, in one revolution of crankshaft.
ii. Four-stroke engines in which the engine cycle is completed in four 
strokes of the piston, that is, in two revolutions of crankshaft.
•• Thermodynamic cycle: The thermodynamic cycles commonly used are as 
follows:
i. 
Constant volume combustion (Otto) cycle: Most of the petrol and 
gas engines work on this cycle.
ii. Constant pressure combustion (diesel) cycle: Low-speed diesel 
engines work on this cycle.
iii. Mixed or limited pressure (dual) cycle: The high-speed diesel 
engines work on this cycle.
•• Ignition system: The following two methods are used for the ignition of 
fuel.
i. 
Spark ignition: Petrol engines use a spark for the ignition of com­
pressed charge (mixture of air and petrol), and the spark may be 
produced by magneto or battery.
ii. Compression ignition: diesel engines have a high compression ratio. 
The resulting high temperature is utilized to burn the fuel.

Internal Combustion Engines • 109
•• Kind of fuel used:
i. 
Light oil engines using kerosene or petrol. Petrol engines fall under 
this category.
ii. Heavy oil or diesel oil engines: The oil used may be crude oil or 
mineral oil.
iii. Gas engines: The gas used may be coal gas, producer gas, blast fur­
nace gas, or coke oven gas.
iv. By-fuel engines: The gas is used as the main fuel and liquid fuel is 
used for starting purposes.
•• Number and arrangement of cylinders
i. 
In-line engines: all the cylinders are arranged with their axes paral­
lel, and they transmit power to a single crankshaft.
ii. V-engines: the engines contain two banks of cylinders connected 
to the same crank and crankshaft. The crankshaft length for V-type 
engines is half of that for in-line engines.
iii. Radial engines: the cylinders are arranged radially and are connected 
to a single crankshaft. Radial engines occupy less floor area and have 
little balancing problem.
•• Fuel supply system
i. 
Carburetor engines: mixture of petrol and air is prepared in the car­
buretor and is supplied to the engine during suction stroke.
ii. Solid injection or airless injection: a fuel pump is used to inject the 
fuel into diesel engines.
iii. Air injection: fuel is supplied, under pressure, to the engine cylinder 
of diesel engines by using compressed air.
•• Cooling system
i. 
Water-cooled engines in which the heat from the cylinder walls is 
transferred to cooling water which is kept circulating in the water 
jackets provided in the cylinder block. The water picks up heat and 
is taken to the radiator where the heat is transferred to the surround­
ing air. The water is repeatedly returned to the engine after being 
cooled in the radiator. Medium- and large-sized engines and auto­
mobile engines use the water cooling system.

110 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
ii. Air cooling in which the heat from the cylinder walls is directly trans­
ferred to the surrounding air. Air cooling is generally employed for 
small-capacity engines like scooters and motorcycle engines.
•• Lubrication system: Lubrication system refers to the act of reducing fric­
tion by introducing a substance (called lubricant) between the mating 
parts of the engine.
i. Splash lubrication system suitable for small-capacity engines with 
moderate speed and bearing loads.
ii. Pressure lubrication system used for heavy-duty engines.
•• Governing system (speed control under variable load)
i. 
Quality control engines in which composition of mixture (air-fuel 
ratio) is changed by admitting more or less fuel in accordance with 
variation in load on the engine. This method is used in diesel engines.
ii. Quantity control engines in which the air-fuel mixture has a con­
stant composition. However, the quantity of the mixture supplied 
is changed in accordance with load on the engine. This is used in 
petrol and gas engines.
• • Valve location:
i. 
overhead-valve engine
ii. side-valve engine
• • Speed: Engines having speeds above 900 rpm are called high-speed 
engines, and less than 400 rpm are called slow-speed engines.
• • Field of application:
i. 
Stationary engines used for small- and medium-capacity electric 
power plants, concrete mixers, and pumping units
ii. Mobile engines installed in motor vehicles, airplanes, and ships.
3.3. ENGINE PARTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
•• Cylinder and cylinder head: The cylinder is the main body of the engine 
wherein direct combustion of fuel takes place. The cylinder is a stationary 
component, and the piston reciprocates inside it. The cylinder head closes 

Internal Combustion Engines • 111
one end of the cylinder, and it is usually cast as one piece and is bolted to 
the top of the cylinder. It contains the valve seats and ports, and supports 
the valves and valve-actuated mechanism. Cylinders are usually made of 
ordinary cast iron. However, for heavy-duty engines, alloy steels are used. 
In the interest of weight saving, particularly in airplanes, use is made of 
aluminum and magnesium alloys.
•• Piston and piston rings: A piston is a metal cup with its crown facing 
the combustion space. The function of the piston, together with the rings, 
is to confine the gases in the combustion space and, thus, transmit the 
full force of expansion to the connecting rod and crankshaft. The piston 
also acts as a bearing for the small end of the connecting rod. Pistons are 
usually made of gray iron or of aluminum alloys for high-speed engines. 
Aluminum has the advantage of low density (the density of aluminum is 
about two-fifths that of cast iron).
The leakage of gases between the walls of the piston and cylinder is pre­
vented by means of three to six cast iron rings which may be square or rectan­
gular in cross-section. These rings are inserted into the grooves provided on 
the piston. There are usually two sets of piston rings:
i. upper piston rings (called the compression rings) provide gas-tight seal 
and prevent the leakage of high-pressure gas.
ii. lower piston rings (called oil 
rings) provide an effective seal 
and prevent the leakage of oil into 
the cylinder head.
•• Connecting rod: The connect­
ing rod transmits the force given 
by the piston to the crank, caus­
ing it to turn and, thus, convert 
the reciprocating motion of the 
piston into rotary motion of the 
crankshaft. The rotary motion is 
required to make the wheels turn, 
a cutting blade spin, or a pulley 
rotate.
The connecting rod connects the 
piston at one end and the crank at the
Spark Plug

other end. The piston end is 
called the small end, and the 
crank end is called the big 
end. The connection at the 
small end is made by a pin 
called the gudgeon pin, wrist 
pin, or piston pin. At the 
big end, the connecting rod 
embraces the crank arm by a 
pin named crank pin.
The connecting rod is usually a small forging of I-section which provides 
the maximum stiffness with minimum weight. It is normally tapered along its 
length so as to provide a smaller cross-sectional area toward the small end. It 
has also a passage for the transfer of lubricating oil from the big-end bearing
to the gudgeon pin.
• • Crank and crankshaft: The reciprocating motion of the piston is con­
verted into rotary motion by the connecting rod and crank mechanism. 
All the auxiliary mechanisms of the engine having mechanical transmis­
sion are geared in one way or the other to the crankshaft and obtain their 
motive power from it. The shape of the crankshaft, that is, the mutual 
arrangement of the cranks depends on the number and arrangement of 
cylinders and the turning order of the engine. Figure 3.2 shows a typical 
crankshaft layout for a four-cylinder engine.
Both the crank and crankshaft are steel forgings machined to a smooth 
finish. The crankshaft mounts in bearings and can rotate freely. For smooth 
running, the crankshafts are perfectly balanced, both statically and dynami­
cally.
• • Crankcase: The engine cylinder, piston, and crankshaft are housed in the 
crankcase which also serves as an oil sump for the storage of the lubricat­
ing oil. The oil level is checked with the help of an oil stick or dip stick. 
The crankcase is generally made of cast iron.
• • Camshaft and valve mechanism: The camshaft operates the intake and 
exhaust valves through the cams, cam followers, pushrods, and rocker 
arms. On a four-stroke engine, the inlet and exhaust valves operate once 
per cycle, that is, in two revolutions of the crankshaft. Consequently, the 
camshaft is driven by the crankshaft at exactly half its rotational speed.

Internal Combustion Engines • 113
The crankshaft material is 
commonly a steel forging with 
journals and cam faces case 
hardened.
The valves are usually mush­
room-shaped (known as poppet 
valves) with conical seating sur­
faces. The poppet valve is practi­
cally universal on all modern car 
and commercial vehicle engines. 
The face of the valve and its seat
FIGURE 3.3 Overhead-valve mechanism.
on the cylinder is very accurately 
ground at an angle of 30° or 45°. 
Steel containing a small percentage 
of nickel and chromium is the usual 
valve material. Such an alloy has 
good heat-resisting qualities and is 
considered good enough to with­
stand high temperatures, mechan­
ical forces, corrosive, and erosive 
effects of the high-velocity cylinder 
gases.
The valves may be provided at the top or on the side of the engine cyl­
inder. Figure 3.3 shows a typical overhead-valve assembly with the princi­
ple parts named. The cam lifts the pushrod through the cam follower, and 
the push rod actuates the rocker arm lever at one end. The other end of the 
rocker arm then gets depressed and that opens the valve. The valve returns to 
its seating by the spring after the cam has rotated. The valve stem moves in a 
valve guide which acts as a bearing. Some clearance is provided between the 
rocker arm and valve stem to take care of valve expansion during the running 
of engine, and it can be adjusted by the screw adjuster. The exhaust valve 
usually has a greater clearance as it runs hotter.
• • Flywheel: The flywheel is a heavy and thoroughly balanced disk fitted 
onto the end of the crankshaft. It stores excess energy during the power 
stroke and returns this stored energy for use during the auxiliary strokes. 
Thus, it serves to reduce cyclic variations of speed and ensures uniform 
rotation of the crankshaft. The heavier the flywheel, the more uniform 
and stable will be the operation of the engine.

114 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Flywheels are generally manufactured from cast iron or cast steel.
• • Governor: A governor is used to adjust the power output from an engine 
in conformity with the external load and accordingly make the engine 
operate at a constant speed. The task is accomplished by regulating the 
quantity of charge in petrol engines and the amount of fuel in diesel 
engines.
All types of engines generally have the components described above. The 
components used either only for diesel engines or for petrol engines are given 
as follows:
Fuel pump and injector: In diesel engines, fuel pumps are used to 
deliver the correct quantity of fuel at the precise instant required for a wide 
range of loads and speeds. The nozzle atomizes the fuel and distributes it into 
the combustion chamber of the engine. Atomization of fuel means breaking 
the fuel stream into mist-like spray. Atomization ensures that each particle of 
fuel is surrounded by air needed for combustion and that assists in rapid and 
successful burning of fuel. Atomization is made possible by the high velocity 
of fuel through the nozzle which is due to the high pressure created by the 
pump.
Carburetor and spark plug: The carburetor delivers to the gas and pet­
rol engines a combustible mixture of air and fuel in a condition that can be 
easily and efficiently burned in the engine cylinder. The process of mixture 
formation is called carburation.
Toward the end of the compression stroke, the combustible mixture is 
ignited by a spark plug which has to spark several thousand times a minute 
under a wide range of temperatures. Each cylinder is provided with its own 
spark plug screwed into the lid.
3.4. FOUR-STROKE PETROL ENGINE
A cycle is a sequence of operations constantly repeated, and “four-stroke” 
refers to the number of strokes of the piston required to complete one cycle. 
Refer to Figure 3.4 for the arrangement of different parts of a four-stroke 
cycle system. The piston reciprocating inside a cylinder is connected to the 
crankshaft through the connecting rod and the crank. The inlet (suction) and 
outlet (exhaust) valves are housed in the cylinder head. The cylinder head is 
also provided with an electric spark plug.

Internal Combustion Engines • 115
All events of the cycle namely suction, com­
pression, combustion, expansion, and exhaust 
are completed in two revolutions of the crank­
shaft.
The salient features of the four strokes in a 
petrol engine are given as follows:
1. 
Intake or suction stroke: (Figure 3.5a) 
Initially, the piston is at top-dead center (TDC) 
position, the inlet valve is open, and the out­
let valve is closed. The piston moves downward 
toward bottom-dead center (BDC) position, 
and the pressure inside the cylinder is reduced 
to a value below the atmospheric pressure. The 
vacuum, thus, created causes the charge to rush 
in and fill the space vacated by the piston. The
FIGURE 3.4 Four-stroke cycle system.
charge consists of a mixture of air and petrol prepared by the carburetor.
The suction continues till the piston reaches its BDC position. The piston 
has now made one stroke, and the crankshaft has turned through 180°C, that 
is, has made half the revolution.
2. 
Compression stroke: (Figure 3.5b) Both the valves (inlet and outlet) 
are closed and the movement of the piston is from BDC to TDC position. The 
charge inside the cylinder is compressed to the clearance volume; the volume 
decreases and there is a continuous rise both in temperature and pressure of 
the charge. A majority of the petrol engines use compression ratios between 
5 to 1 and 8 to 1. Toward the end of compression, the approximate values of 
pressure and temperature are 6-12 bar and 250-300°C, respectively.
3. 
Working, expansion, or power stroke: (Figure 3.5c) When the pis­
ton reaches TDC position, the charge is ignited by causing an electric spark 
between the electrodes of a spark plug which is located in the cylinder head. 
During combustion, the chemical energy of the fuel is released and there is a 
rise both in pressure and temperature of the gases at almost constant volume. 
The temperature of the gases increases to about 1800-2000 °C, and the pres­
sure reaches 30-40 bar.
With both valves closed, the gases at increased pressure and temperature 
expand, push the piston down the cylinder, and work is done by the system. 
The reciprocating motion of the piston is subsequently converted into the 
rotary motion of the crankshaft by connecting rod and crank. It is the rotary 
motion that is required to make wheels run, a cutting blade spin, or a pulley 
rotate.

116 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
During expansion, there is an increase in vol­
ume of the gases, and the pressure drops to as 
low as 3 bar.
4. 
Exhaust Stroke: (Figure 3.5d) The inlet 
valve remains closed but the exhaust valve opens 
when the piston reaches BDC position toward 
the completion of the power stroke. The pres­
sure falls slightly above atmospheric pressure 
at constant volume. The piston moves upward 
from BDC to TDC, and this upward movement 
of the piston pushes the spent-up gases into the 
atmosphere through the exhaust valve and the 
exhaust manifold. Much of the noise associated 
with automobile engines is due to high exhaust 
velocity.
The exhaust stroke completes the cycle; the 
engine cylinder is ready to suck the fresh charge 
inside the cylinder once again, and the cycle is 
repeated.
Since the beginning of the suction stroke, the 
piston has made four strokes inside the cylinder: 
two up and two down. During the same period, 
the crank has turned two revolutions. Thus, for a 
four-stroke cycle, there is only one power stroke 
for every two revolutions of the crankshaft.
Theoretical and Actual p-V Diagrams: 
The following assumptions have been made 
while carrying out the above operations:
FIGURE 3.5 Operation of a four- 
stroke cycle petrol 
engine.
i. 
Suction and exhaust are at atmospheric pressure.
ii. Opening and closing of the valves (both inlet and outlet) are instantane­
ous and at dead centers.
iii. Compression and expansion processes are isentropic, that is, reversible 
adiabatic.
iv. The combustion of fuel takes place instantaneously at constant volume.
v. There is a sudden drop in gas pressure to the atmospheric pressure at the 
end of the expansion stroke.
Such a theoretical operation of the cycle can be represented by the p-V 
plot as shown in Figure 3.6a.

Internal Combustion Engines • 117
However, an actual cycle deviates con­
siderably form the hypothetical one because 
of the following reasons:
i. 
For efficient suction, the pressure 
inside the cylinder at suction is less 
than the atmospheric pressure. This 
pressure difference, called intake 
depression, is needed to overcome the 
resistance to the flow of charge through 
the restricted area of the inlet passages.
ii. For proper exhaust of burned gases, 
there has to be a net positive pressure 
from inside of the cylinder to outside. 
Accordingly, the exhaust line does not 
coincide with atmospheric pressure but 
is slightly above it.
iii. Compression and expansion are not 
isentropic. Friction is always present, 
and there is a considerable interchange 
of heat between the charge and the cyl­
inder walls.
(a)
(b)
iv. There is always a time lag between the FIGURE3.6 Theoretical and actual p V 
diagram for four-stroke 
ignition of charge and its actual com- 
petrol engine.
bustion. Consequently, the combustion
does not take place at constant volume and the pressure rise is not along 
a straight line.
v. Opening and closing of the valves take some time and are never instanta­
neous. This is reflected in rounding off the corners of the p - V plot.
vi. Ignition of charge and opening of the valves are never at dead centers. 
These events occur at some degree on either side of dead centers to get 
better charging and scavenging (pushing out of burned gases) perfor­
mance.
vii. At high temperature, there is all likelihood of dissociation of products of 
combustion such as CO2 and H2O (steam). This splitting is an endother­
mic process and requires heat. Further, the value of exponent y decreases 
with a rise in temperature. Due to these aspects, the pressure and tem­

118 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
perature attained during the actual cycle are lower than the theoretical 
values.
When these modifications are taken into account, the p-V plot takes the 
form as shown in Figure 3.6(b). The suction line a -1 lies below the atmo­
spheric pressure line, and the exhaust 1-a lies slightly above the atmospheric 
line. The area enclosed by the exhaust and suction lines is called a negative 
loop or pumping loop.
This represents the work required for the admission of fresh charge and 
for the removal of burned gases. Network is obtained by subtracting the pump 
loss from the gross output Network per cycle = (A1 - A2)
The area (A1 - A2) is always less than area A of the theoretical p-V diagram.
3.5. FOUR-STROKE DIESEL
ENGINE
The engine completes its working cycle 
in four strokes of the piston, uses diesel 
oil as fuel, and therefore, is known as 
a four-stroke diesel engine. Figure 3.7 
shows the different parts of the engine 
and illustrates its principle of operation. 
The piston reciprocates inside a cylin­
der and is connected to the crankshaft 
through the connecting rod and the 
crank. The inlet (suction) and outlet 
(exhaust) valves are housed in the cyl­
inder head. The cylinder head is also 
provided with a nozzle for injecting the 
fuel.
The sequence of individual strokes 
is as follows:
1. 
Intake or suction stroke: Ini­
tially, the piston is at top-dead center 
(TDC) position, the inlet valve is open, 
and the outlet valve is closed. The piston 
moves downward toward BDC, and the 
pressure inside the cylinder is reduced 
to a value below the atmospheric pres-
Expansion

diesel engine.

sure. The vacuum, thus, created causes the air from the atmosphere to rush 
in and fill the space vacated by the piston. The suction stroke is completed 
when the piston reaches the BDC position. The piston has then made one 
stroke, and the crankshaft has turned through 180°, that is, has made half the 
revolution.
2. 
Compression stroke: Both the inlet and outlet valves are closed and 
the movement of the piston is from BDC to TDC position (Figure 3.7 b). 
The air inside the cylinder is compressed to clearance volume; the volume 
decreases and there is a continuous rise both in temperature and pressure of 
the air. A majority of the diesel engines use compression ratios between 15:1 
and 20:1. Toward the end of compression, the approximate values of pressure 
and temperature are 60 bar and 600 °C, respectively.
3. 
Working expansion or power stroke: When the piston reaches the 
TDC position, a fine spray of diesel is injected into the combustion space con­
taining the high-temperature compressed air. The fuel vapors are raised to 
self-ignition temperature, and combustion occurs at approximately constant 
pressure.
The atomization of fuel and its supply to the combustion space can also be 
accomplished by compressed air supplied from compressed air bottles. The 
air entering the combustion space is so regulated that the pressure theoreti­
cally remains constant during the burning period.
With both valves closed, the combustion products at increased pressure 
and temperature push the piston down the cylinder with a large force. Expan­
sion of the gases takes place, and work is done by the system. The reciprocat­
ing motion of the piston is subsequently converted into the rotary motion of 
the crankshaft by connecting rod and crank.
The expansion stroke gets completed as the piston reaches its BDC posi­
tion. During expansion, there is an increase in the volume of the gases and 
the pressure drops.
4. 
Exhaust stroke: The inlet valve remains closed while the exhaust 
valve opens. The piston moves upward from BDC to TDC position, and this 
upward movement of the piston pushes the spent-up gases into the atmo­
sphere through the exhaust valve and the exhaust manifold.
The exhaust stroke completes the cycle, then the engine cylinder is ready 
to suck fresh air inside the cylinder once again, and the cycle is repeated. 
Much of the noise associated with automobile engines is due to the high 
velocity of exhaust gases.
Since the beginning of the suction stroke, the piston has made four strokes 
inside the cylinder: two up and two down. During the same period, the crank 

120 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
has turned two revolutions. Thus, for a four-stroke cycle, there is only one 
power stroke for every revolution of the crankshaft.
The following assumptions have been made while carrying out the above 
operations.
i. 
Suction and exhaust are at atmospheric pressure.
ii. Opening and closing of the valves (both inlet and outlet) are instantane­
ous and at dead centers.
iii. Compression and expansion processes are isentropic, that is, reversible 
adiabatic.
iv. The combustion of fuel takes place at constant pressure during a small 
part of the expansion stroke.
v. There is a sudden drop in gas pressure to atmospheric pressure at the end 
of the expansion stroke.
Such a theoretical operation of the cycle 
can be represented by the p - V plot as shown 
in Figure 3.8(a).
However, the actual cycle differs con­
siderably from the hypothetical one due to 
the reasons mentioned in Section 3.4. When 
those modifications are taken into account, 
then the plot takes the form as shown in Fig­
ure 3.8(b). The area enclosed by the exhaust 
and suction lines is called a negative loop 
or pumping loop, and the actual pressure 
inside the cylinder is slightly less than the 
atmospheric pressure during suction stroke 
and slightly higher than the atmospheric 
pressure during exhaust stroke (the corners 
are rounded off in the actual p-V plot) rep­
resents the work required for the admis­
sion of fresh charge and for the removal of 
burned gases. Network is obtained by sub­
tracting the pump loss from the gross output
Network per cycle = (A1 - A2)
The area (A1 - A2) is always less than 
area A of the theoretical p-V diagram.

3.6. COMPARISON BETWEEN PETROL AND DIESEL
ENGINES
Below are given the differences between the construction and operation of a 
diesel engine and a petrol engine of similar capacity and number of cylinders.
i. 
Basic cycles: The petrol engine works on the Otto cycle whereas a diesel 
engine works on the diesel cycle.
ii. Fuel used: Petrol engine is a light oil engine and uses gasoline or petrol as 
fuel. Diesel engine is a heavy oil engine and uses diesel as fuel. The diesel 
has a high self-ignition temperature compared to petrol
iii. Induction of fuel: Mixture of petrol and air in required strength is pre­
pared in the carburetor and inducted into the engine cylinder during the 
suction stroke of a petrol engine.
During the suction stroke of a diesel engine, only air from the atmo­
sphere is sucked into the engine cylinder. A fuel pump is used to inject 
fuel directly into the combustion space where it meets the air which has 
been compressed.
iv. Compression ratio: A majority of petrol engines use a compression ratio 
between 5 to 1 and 8 to 1. The upper limit is fixed by anti-knock rating of 
fuels.
The compression ratio in diesel engines lies between 15:1 and 20:1; the 
upper limit is fixed because of an increase in the weight of the engine with 
an increase in compression ratio.
v. Thermal efficiency: For the same compression ratio, the efficiency of a 
diesel engine is lower than that of a petrol engine. However, this aspect 
is of not much practical significance since the petrol engines work with a 
compression ratio not exceeding 8 whereas diesel engines can safely have 
a compression ratio as high as 20. A high compression ratio for a diesel 
engine is a must not only for high efficiency but also to prevent the diesel 
knock - the phenomenon of uncontrolled and rapid combustion.
vi. Ignition: Petrol engines use a spark plug to ignite the charge (mixture of 
air and petrol) after it has been compressed. The combustion of fuel in 
diesel engines is due to the high temperature of compressed air.
vii. Weight: The cylinder walls of diesel engines have to be made thicker to 
sustain the high pressures attained due to higher compression ratios. The 
weight of a diesel engine amounts to between 30 and 50% more than that 
of a petrol engine giving the same power output.

122 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
viii. Speed: The petrol engines are high-speed engines due to light weight, and 
the diesel engines run at comparatively low speeds due to heavy weight.
ix. Vibration and noise: The vibration and noise level are higher with a diesel 
engine because of higher maximum pressure.
x. Load control: The petrol engines are quantity control engines. The air­
fuel mixture prepared by the mixture being inducted is controlled by the 
throttle valve in accordance with load on the engine.
The diesel engines are quality control engines. The composition of the 
mixture (air-fuel ratio) is changed by admitting more or less fuel with vari­
ation in engine load. The fuel pump regulates the supply of fuel injected 
into the combustion space.
xi. Power: A petrol engine can be designated to give a better mean effective 
pressure mainly due to its improved combustion efficiency.
xii. Cost: The initial cost of a diesel engine is higher, mainly due to the cost of 
the fuel pump. Since diesel is cheaper than petrol, the running cost of a 
diesel engine works out to be low. Further, the experience of most opera­
tors is that a diesel engine requires less maintenance than a petrol engine. 
However, a larger battery is necessary for a diesel engine.
xiii. Fire risk: This is minimized in diesel engines owing to the higher ignition 
point of the fuel used.
xiv. Applications: Petrol engines are used in cars, scooters, and motor cycles.
Diesel engines are used in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks, buses, and 
locomotive engines.
3.7. TWO-STROKE SYSTEM
The working cycle is completed in two strokes of the piston or in one revolu­
tion of the crankshaft as against two crankshaft revolutions in a four-stroke 
cycle engine. The preparatory strokes (suction and exhaust) are combined 
with the working strokes (compression and expansion). The following two 
methods have been used to accomplish the desired objective.
i. 
Providing a separate pump outside the engine cylinder to compressible 
charge (air-fuel mixture from carburetor or air alone from the atmos­
phere) before forcing it into the cylinder. The pump is an integral part of

Internal Combustion Engines • 123
ii.
the engine and gets its motive 
power from the engine itself. 
The arrangement is referred 
to as two-channel system and is 
used for large capacity multicyl­
inder engines.
Crankcase compression system 
where the crankcase works as 
an air pump as the piston moves 
up and down. The charge (air­
fuel mixture or air alone) is 
compressed by the pumping 
action of the underside of the
FIGURE 3.9 Two-stroke cycle system.
piston before being supplied 
to the engine cylinder. The
arrangement is referred to as three-channel system and is commonly used 
for single-cylinder small power engines such as scooters and motorcycle
engines.
Construction: Figure 3.9 shows the arrangement of a typical three-port 
engine employing crankcase compression. The piston which is closely fitted in 
the cylinder is connected to the crankshaft through connecting rod and crank. 
The top of the piston is usually crown-shaped and that assists in sweeping the 
spent-up gases toward the exhaust port with the help of fresh charge. The 
engine employs ports against valves as provided in a four-stroke system. These 
ports are cut in the cylinder walls and are three in number: the transfer port, 
inlet, or induction port, and the exhaust port. The inlet and exhaust ports are 
located on one side, and the transfer port is provided on the other side. The 
cylinder top is provided with an electric spark plug-in a petrol engine or a 
nozzle for injecting the fuel in a diesel engine.
Working: The charge is led to the crankcase through the inlet port. The 
charge consists of a mixture of air and petrol prepared by the carburetor in 
the case of the petrol engine. The diesel engine admits only fresh air through 
the atmosphere. The transfer port takes the compressed charge from the 
crankcase to the engine cylinder. The spent-up gases are discharged to the 
atmosphere through the exhaust port. The closing and opening of the ports 
are controlled by up and down motion of the piston inside the cylinder. The 
piston crown helps prevent the loss of incoming fresh charge (charge being 
carried with the spent-up gases) and uses its momentum for exhausting only 
the burned gases. Scavenging is the term applied to the process of forcing the 

124 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
burned gases through the exhaust port by deflecting fresh charge across the 
cylinder.
Sequence of events: Figure 3.10 explains the working principle and 
sequence of events in a two-stroke cycle system.
FIGURE 3.10 Working of two-stroke cycle engine.
Ignition and induction: In Figure 3.10(a), the piston occupies the almost 
TDC position toward the end of the compression stroke. The compressed 
charge is being ignited by providing a spark, or fuel is being injected into the 
hot compressed air. The combustion of fuel occurs, and thermal energy is 
released. There occurs a rise both in the pressure and temperature of com­
bustion products.
At the same time, a partial vacuum (pressure lower than atmosphere) 
exists in the crankcase, and the fresh charge is being inducted into the crank­
case through the inlet port which is uncovered by the piston.
Expansion and compression: (Figure 3.10b). The high-pressure gases 
push the piston down, expansion takes place and power is developed. With 
the downward movement of the piston, the charge in the crankcase gets com­
pressed by the underside of the piston to a pressure of about 1.4 bar absolute.
After completion of about 80% of the expansion stroke, the piston uncov­
ers the exhaust port. Some of the combustion products which are still above 
atmospheric pressure escape to the atmosphere. On its further downward 
motion, the piston uncovers the transfer port and allows the slightly com­
pressed charge from the crankcase to be admitted into the cylinder via the 
transfer port.
Exhaust and transference: (Figure 3.10c). The piston lies at its BDC posi­
tion. The expanded gases are escaping through the exhaust port, and simul­
taneously, the slightly compressed charge from the crankcase is being forced 

Internal Combustion Engines • 125
into the engine cylinder through the transfer port. The charge strikes the 
deflector on the piston crown, rises to the top of the cylinder, and pushes out 
most of the burned gases. During this scavenging action, a part of the fresh 
charge is likely to leave with the exhaust gases. The cylinder is completely 
filled with the fresh charge, although it is somewhat diluted due to its mixing 
with the burned gases.
When the piston moves upward from its BDC position, it first covers the 
transfer port and stops the flow of fresh charge into the cylinder. A little later, 
the exhaust port too gets covered and actual compression of the charge begins 
and continues till the piston reaches TDC position. The cycle of the engine is, 
thus, completed within two strokes of the piston (one up and one down) and 
one revolution of the crankshaft.
3.8. COMPARISON BETWEEN TWO-STROKE AND FOUR-
STROKE ENGINES
Merits of two-stroke engines
i. 
For the same power output, a two-stroke engine is simple in design, easy 
to manufacture, and operate.
ii. 
A two-stroke cycle engine gives one working stroke for each revolution 
of the crankshaft. The four-stroke cycle engine gives one working stroke 
for every two revolutions of the crankshaft. As such, a two-stroke engine 
develops theoretically twice the power developed by four-stroke engine 
for the same engine speed and cylinder volume.
iii. The number of working strokes is twice that in a four-stroke engine. Con­
sequently, the turning moment is uniform and, hence, the need only for 
a lighter flywheel.
iv. Less friction loss due to the absence of suction and exhaust strokes, con­
sequently high mechanical efficiency. The absence of cams, camshaft, and 
rockers also contributes toward high mechanical efficiency.
v. Simpler construction and mechanism because of no valve and valve mech­
anism. The ports are easy to design, and they are covered and uncovered 
by the movement of piston itself.
vi. A two-stroke engine occupies less space, needs lighter foundations, and 
requires few spare parts.

126 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
vii. The reversing of a two-stroke engine can be achieved by a simple revers­
ing gear mechanism.
viii. The initial cost of a two-stroke engine is less due to light weight and the 
absence of a valve mechanism.
ix. The two-stroke engines are much easier to start.
Demerits of two-stroke engines:
i. 
Scavenging (driving out of burned gases) is not complete due to the short 
time available for exhaust. This results in the dilution of fresh charge.
ii. Exhaust and inlet parts are uncovered (open) simultaneously during a cer­
tain period. Some fresh charge is likely to escape without giving any work 
output.
iii. Thermal efficiency of a two-stroke engine is likely to be lower due to some 
charge escaping without burning and poor scavenging. Consequently, 
fresh charge is diluted which results not only decrease in performance 
but also slow running, low combustion pressure, and poor efficiency.
iv. For the same stroke and clearance volume, the effective compression 
ratio is lower in a two-stroke engine. This too lowers the engine efficiency.
v. More wear and tear of moving parts due to double the number of power 
strokes.
vi. The piston gets overheated due to firing in each revolution of crankshaft. 
Higher temperatures make the cooling and lubrication requirements 
quite severe.
vii. Greater consumption of lubricating oil due to high operating tempera­
tures.
viii. Noisy exhaust due to sudden release of burned gases.
3.9. APPLICATIONS OF TWO-STROKE ENGINES
Two-stroke engines are generally used where low cost, compactness, and light 
weight are the major considerations such as in scooters, motorcycles, mopeds, 
and other light vehicles. The two-stroke opposed piston diesel engines are 
quite suitable for marine installations (ship propulsion) where the engine 
room is small.

3.10. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF IC ENGINE
Engine performance is an indication of the degree of success with which the 
engine does the job assigned to it, that is, the conversion of chemical energy 
contained in the fuel into useful mechanical work. The engine performance 
is expressed in terms of certain parameters and a study needs to be made on 
how those parameters are affected by the operating conditions, design con­
cepts, and modifications. The desired engine performance depends on the 
power requirements of the apparatus or vehicle to which the engine has to be 
connected. A test run on the engine may be made
• • to find the power output under certain conditions,
• • to determine the fuel economy, and
• • to obtain detailed information about the various losses and for preparing 
heat balance.
FIGURE 3.11 Energy flow in an IC engine.
Refer to Figure 3.11 for the energy flow through an IC engine.
When the mixture of air and fuel supplied is burned inside the engine 
cylinder, the chemical energy gets converted into heat energy. The total heat, 
thus, generated cannot be converted into work, and a substantial part is
a. lost to cooling water flowing through the cylinder jackets,
b. carried by exhaust gases, and
c. lost to surroundings by way of radiation.
The remaining part of the energy exerts a force on the piston which moves 
and mechanical work is done. The power developed inside the engine cylin­
der due to the combustion of fuel is called indicated power (IP).

128 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
A part of the indicated power is lost due to friction between the piston and 
cylinder as well as in the bearings. The net output available at the output shaft 
is called brake power (BP).
The difference between indicated power and brake power is called fric­
tion power (FP).
3.11. MEASUREMENT OF INDICATED POWER AND BRAKE 
POWER
The indicated power is usually measured by taking the indicator diagram with 
a device called an indicator. An indicator diagram is the graphical representa­
tion of the pressure-volume changes during the working of the cycle.
The indicator consists of a pis­
ton-cylinder assembly that commu­
nicates with the cylinder head of 
the engine being tested. The pis­
ton slides inside the cylinder, and 
the piston rod is connected to the 
straight line linkage through spring 
of proper stiffness. The spring con­
trols the piston movement which 
is caused by any variation in pres­
sure inside the engine cylinder. 
The higher the spring stiffness, 
the lesser the magnification is, and 
the lower the spring constant, the 
greater the magnification is. The 
movement of the indicator piston is 
transferred to a drum by the linkage 
at the end of which is attached with 
a stylus (pencil). The stylus moves 
in the vertical direction in propor­
tion to the piston movement and 
records the gas pressure. The drum 
is made to rotate about its axis by a 
pulley and a cord connected to the 
engine piston through a reducing 
mechanism. The motion of the cord 
is proportional to the piston stroke.
FIGURE 3.12 Engine indicator.
FIGURE 3.13.

Internal Combustion Engines • 129
Obviously, a diagram would be obtained on a strip of paper wrapped around 
the rotating drum. The vertical movement of the stylus and the horizontal 
movement of the cord combine to produce a closed figure known as an indi­
cator diagram. The area of the diagram is a measure of the work developed, 
and the length of the diagram is proportional to the swept volume.
The indicator diagram has a positive loop (area between the compression 
and expansion lines) and a negative loop (area between the suction and exhaust 
lines). The positive loop gives the gross work done by the piston during the 
cycle, and the negative loop represents the pump loss due to admission of 
fresh charge and removal of exhaust gases.
Net work done per cycle = area of positive loop - area of negative loop
The area of the indicator card can be measured either with a planimeter 
or by the ordinate method. The indicated mean effective pressure (pmi) is then 
given by
area of indicator diagram
pmi =----------------------------------------------------------------------------------x spring constant
base length of indicator diagram
The mean effective pressure represents the constant pressure if it is acted 
over the full length of the stroke would produce the same amount of work as 
is actually developed by the engine during a cycle.
If the area is in mm2, base length is in mm, and the spring constant is in 
N/mm2 per mm of vertical movement of the indicator stylus, then mean effec­
tive pressure works out in N/mm2.
Further, if pmi = indicated mean effective pressure, N/m2
A = area of the piston, m2
L = length of stroke, m
and N = speed of the engine, rpm
Then, force on the piston = pmi x A (newton)
work done per stroke = pmi LA (Nm)
work done per minute pmi LAN (Nm/min)
In a two-stroke cycle, the cycle is completed in two strokes of the piston 
or in one revolution of the crankshaft. In a four-stroke cycle, the engine cycle 
gets completed in four strokes of the piston or two revolutions of the crank­
shaft. Thenwork done/minute = pmi LAN for two-stroke engine
= p t LA — for four-stroke engine

where n is the number of cylinders in the engine.

130 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The brake power (the useful power available at the engine crankshaft) 
is determined with the help of a dynamometer coupled to the engine crank-
shaft. A rope brake dynamometer consists 
of one or more ropes wrapped around the 
flywheel of the engine of which brake power 
is to be measured. The ropes are spaced 
evenly across the width of the rim by means 
of U-shaped wooden blocks located at dif­
ferent points of the rim of the flywheel. The 
upward ends of the ropes are connected 
together and attached to a spring balance, 
and the downward ends are kept in place 
by a dead weight. The rotation of the fly­
wheel produces frictional force and the rope 
tightens. Consequently, a force is induced in 
the spring balance. The generation of heat 
is enormous and that necessitates a cooling 
arrangement for the brake.
The power of the engine is absorbed as 
frictional heat between the rope and pulley 
surface.

rope, N

3.12. PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS
The engine performance is expressed in terms of certain parameters which 
have been enumerated and defined below:
Mechanical efficiency: The ratio of brake power to indicated power is 
called mechanical efficiency.
Mechanical efficiency h m = BP
IP
The mechanical efficiency is a measure of the mechanical perfection of 
the engine or its ability to transmit the power developed in the cylinder to 
the drive shaft. The mechanical efficiency essentially depends on the design 
of the engine, its condition and load, and its value varies from 75 to 90 % for 
different types of engines.
Thermal efficiency: Thermal efficiency of an engine is the indicator of the 
conversion of heat supplied into work energy. It is based either on indicated 
power or on brake power. The indicated thermal efficiency of an IC engine is 
the ratio of the heat converted into indicated work to the heat energy in fuel 
supplied to the engine.
Indicated thermal efficiency
h ith =
indicated power in watt
mf x CV
where
mf = mass of fuel supplied
CV = lower calorific value of fuel in kJ/kg
Brake thermal efficiency is the ratio of the heat converted into useful 
shaft work to the heat supplied to the engine in fuel.
Brake thermal efficiency,
h bth =
brake power in watt
mf x CV
From the expression for h ith and h bth as given above, we can write
nbth 
h ith
BP
IP - h m
h bth = h m X h ith

132 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The value of brake thermal efficiency usually varies from 25 to 30 % for 
spark-ignition engines and 30 to 40 % for compression ignition engines.
Relative efficiency: The relative efficiency or efficiency ratio is defined as 
the ratio of indicated thermal efficiency to the thermal efficiency of a theoret­
ical reversible cycle operating with the same compression ratio. The relative 
efficiency for various cycles usually ranges from 60 to 80 %.
Volumetric efficiency: The engine output depends upon the maximum 
amount of charge taken in during the suction stroke. Volumetric efficiency 
is essentially an indication of the breathing capacity of the engine, and it is 
defined as the ratio of actual volume of the charge (reduced to NTP) drawn in 
during the suction stroke to the swept volume of the engine.
The average value of the volumetric efficiency of an engine ranges from 
70 to 80%.
Specific output: The specific output of an engine is defined as the brake 
power per unit of piston displacement.
specific output =
BP
A x L
= constant x pmb x rotational speed
Thus, for a given displacement of the piston, the brake power can either 
be increased by increasing the speed of the engine or by increasing the brake 
mean effective pressure.
Specific fuel consumption: The fuel consumption and the evaluation of 
fuel cost are an important factor considered to have an indication of the rel­
ative economy of the engine under test when compared with test results on 
other engines. The criterion of economical power production is the specific 
fuel consumption (sfc) which is defined as the mass of fuel required to be sup­
plied to an engine to develop unit kW power per hour. That is
mf
sfc = kg/kWh
BP
The value of sfc is approximately 1.47 kg/kWh for diesel engines and 
1.85 kg/kWh for petrol engines.
Air-fuel ratio: It is defined as the ratio of the mass of air to the mass of 
fuel in the air-fuel mixture. This ratio remains practically constant for petrol 
engines over a wide range of operation. However, for diesel engines, the air­
fuel ratio varies with load as the mass of air remains constant but the mass of 
fuel changes with load on the engine.
Specific weight: It is an indication of the engine bulk and is defined as the 
weight of engine in kg per unit of brake power developed.

Internal Combustion Engines • 133
3.13. MORSE TEST
The Morse test is applicable to multicylinder engines and is used for determin­
ing their indicated power without any elaborate arrangement in the context of 
indicators employed to plot the pressure-volume diagram. The test consists 
in rendering inoperative, in turn, each cylinder of the engine by shorting the 
spark plug if petrol engine is under test or by disconnecting an injector in case 
of diesel engine. The speed falls because of the loss of power with one cylin­
der cut out but is restored by reducing the load.
The procedure for conducting the Morse test on a multicylinder petrol 
engine is outlined as follows:
i. 
Start the engine with the throttle fully open and with all cylinders work­
ing, take the dynamometer readings, and note the engine speed.
ii. Keeping the throttle opening fixed, render the first cylinder inoperative 
by shorting its spark plug. This will cause the engine speed to decrease. 
Restore the speed back to original value by adjusting the dynamometer 
load and note down the new dynamometer reading.
iii. Make the first cylinder operative and cut out the second, third, and fourth 
cylinder in turn.
iv. Repeat the procedure taking care that speed remains constant and the 
throttle opening is undisturbed while the test is being conducted.
When all of the four cylinders are working,
(BP)4 = (IP)4 - (FP)4 
(i)
When one cylinder is cut out, its contribution toward power development 
is lost and the speed of the engine falls. The brake load is reduced so that the 
speed of the engine is restored to its original value. This is to main frictional 
power (FP) constant which is supposed to be independent of load and directly 
proportional to speed. Now only three cylinders will deliver power, but still, 
all the four cylinders will consume friction power. That is
(BP)3 = (IP)3 - (FP)4 
(ii)
From expressions (i) and (ii),
(BP)4 - (BP)3 = (IP)4 - (IP)3
Thus, the difference between the measured brake power with four and 
three plugs will be the IP of the cylinder rendered inoperative. Similarly, the

134 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
IP of each cylinder can be found separately. The addition of IP of different 
cylinders would then give the IP of the engine as a whole.
The following errors are associated with the determination of indicated 
power by the Morse test:
i. 
The cutting off a cylinder affects the distribution of charge to the cylin­
ders, and accordingly, the breathing capacity (volumetric efficiency) of 
the engine becomes different.
ii. The cutting off a cylinder causes pulsations in the exhaust manifold and 
that affects the performance of the engine.
iii. The pumping and mechanical friction losses are assumed to be same 
whether a particular cylinder is working or not, and this is not essentially 
true as became evident from the test runs made by Recardo.
3.14. HEAT BALANCE SHEET
The engine is supplied with a certain quantity of energy in fuel form. Only 
a fraction of this energy is converted into useful mechanical work which is 
available at the engine crankshaft and the remainder is lost. It is the purpose 
of energy balance to trace the energy distribution, that is, to determine how 
the input energy is distributed, where the energy leaves and how much. If 
during the test, it is revealed that at certain loading conditions, a certain form 
of energy loss is excessive, then a careful examination of that form is needed.
A heat balance test of an engine indicates the following items: each 
expressed in heat units.
Credit:
Heat released by fuel Qf = mf x CV
where mf is the fuel consumption and CV is the lower calorific value of fuel 
Debit:
1. Heat equivalent of useful work or power available at the crankshaft (Qb)
2. Heat loss to cooling water
Qw = mw x cw x Д T
where mw is mass of cooling water, cw = specific heat of water, and ДT is the 
rise in the temperature of cooling water.
3. Heat carried by exhaust gases
Qg = mg x cg x (tg - ta)

Internal Combustion Engines • 135
where mg is the mass of exhaust gases, cg is the mean specific heat of exhaust 
gases, tg is the temperature of exhaust gases, and ta is the temperature of 
ambient air.
The mass of exhaust gases is equal to the sum of air consumption of the 
engine and the fuel burned at the same time.
4. Unaccounted and radiation loss
This loss cannot be measured directly and is calculated by subtracting the 
items Qb, Qw, and Qg from the item Qf. That is
Qrad = Qf - (Qb + Qw + Qg).
It may be pointed out that the heat equivalent of friction power is dis­
sipated in cooling loss, exhaust loss, and radiation loss. Friction energy is a 
hidden part of these measurements, and accordingly, the separate inclusion 
of friction loss is omitted from the energy balance of internal combustion
engines.
Heat in fuel is approximately distributed as follows:
in brake power produced, in cooling water, and in exhaust gases.

3.15. ELECTRIC AND HYBRID VEHICLES
An electric vehicle is a vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for pro­
pulsion. Electric motors are the replacement for internal combustion engines 
that generated power by burning a mix of fuel and air. The electric motor is 
powered by a large battery pack placed in the car. Depending on its size, the 
battery can last for a range of 100-450 km, and then be recharged.
There are three main types of electric vehicles classified by the degree 
that electricity is used as their energy source.
1. Battery-electric vehicle (BEV): These are fully electric vehicles with 
rechargeable batteries and do not have a petrol/diesel engine, fuel tank, and 
exhaust pipe. The batteries are charged from an external source.
2. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle: Here recharging of the battery is 
done through both regenerative braking, and plugging to an external source 
of electric power.
3. Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV): The term hybrid refers to technol­
ogy that uses two or more distinct power sources for the propulsion of a vehi­
cle. The HEVs are powered both by the gasoline engine and electric motors. 
The electric energy needed for recharging the battery is generated by the 
car’s own braking system. At start, the HEVs use the electric motor, and as the 
load or speed rises, the gasoline engine comes into operation. The two motors 
are controlled by an internal computer which ensures the best economy for 
the driving conditions.
The BEVs have the following advantages over vehicles run with gasoline 
engines as the power source:
• • electric motors react quickly, they are very responsive and have very good 
torque,
• • electricity is cheaper than gasoline and so low running cost,
• • few parts; maintenance is less frequent and less expensive,
• • quiet in operation and faster acceleration, and
• • quicker repair and replacement of electric motor.
It is predicted that by the year 2040, electric vehicles will become the 
main stream, and cities will become less noise polluted and will also have 
much cleaner air.

CHAPTER4
Refrigeration and 
Air Conditioning
4.1. REFRIGERATION: WHAT IS IT?
Science of providing and maintaining temperatures below that of surroundings
Refrigeration and air conditioning are a fascinating branch of science that 
deals with the chilling or freezing of a substance by removing some of its heat. 
This artificial withdrawal of heat produces within the substance or within 
a space a temperature below the general temperature of its surroundings. 
Refrigeration essentially means continued abstraction of heat from a sub­
stance (perishable foods, drinks, and medicines) at the low-temperature level 
and then transfers this heat to another system at a high potential of tempera­
ture. To accomplish this, mechanical work must be performed to satisfy the 
second law of thermodynamics.
Air conditioning refers to the simultaneous control of temperature, 
humidity, cleanliness, and air motion within a confined region or space.
A brief review is given in this chapter about the basic principles of certain 
refrigeration systems and the properties of primary and secondary refriger­
ants used in them. Mention also has been made of the eco-friendly refriger­
ants which have become a necessity to prevent depletion of the ozone layer.

4.2. HEAT ENGINE, REFRIGERATOR, AND HEAT PUMP
A heat engine is a thermodynamic device used for the continuous production 
of work from heat when operating in a cyclic process. Both heat and work 
interactions take place across the boundary of this cyclically operating device. 
Essentially a heat engine takes heat from the combustion of fuel and converts 
part of this energy into mechanical work.
A heat engine is characterized by the following features:
• • reception of heat Q1 from a high-temperature 
source at T1,
• • partial conversion of heat received to mechan­
ical work W,
• • rejection of remaining heat Q2 to a low-tem­
perature sink at temperature T2,
• • cyclic/continuous operation, and
• • working substance flowing through the engine.
The performance of any machine is expressed as 
the ratio of “what we want” to “what we have to pay 
for.” In the context of an engine, work is obtained 
at the expense of heat input. Accordingly, the per-
FIGURE 4.1 Energy interactions 
in a heat engine.
formance of a heat engine is given by network output to the entire amount 
of heat supplied to the working medium, and this ratio is called thermal 
efficiency, nth. (Thermal efficiency is a measure of the degree of useful uti­
lization of heat received in a heat engine.)
net work output

Application of the principle of energy conservation (First law) to the heat 
engine, which undergoes a cycle gives W = Q1 - Q2
... h th = Q-Q. = t — Q 
(41)
Qi 
Qi
Obviously, the thermal efficiency of a heat engine operating between two 
thermal reservoirs is always less than unity. To increase the thermal efficiency, 
it is necessary to reduce Q2 (heat rejected) with Q1 (heat supplied) remaining 
constant. Thermal efficiency could be equal to unity if Q 1 ^ w and Q 2 = 0 
which, however, cannot be realized in practice.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 157
Refrigerators and heat pumps are reversed heat engines. The adjective 
reversed means operating backward. The direction of heat and work interac­
tions are opposite to that of a heat engine, that is, work input and heat output. 
These machines (refrigerators and heat pumps) are used to remove heat from 
a body at a low-temperature level and then transfer this heat to another body 
at a high potential of temperature. When the main purpose of the machine 
is to remove heat from the cooled space, it is called a refrigerator. A refrig­
erator operates between the temperature of surroundings and a temperature 
below that of the surroundings. Refrigerators are essentially used to preserve 
food items and drugs at low temperatures.
The term heat pump is applied to a machine whose objective is to heat 
a medium that may already be warmer than its surroundings. A heat pump, 
thus, operates between the temperature of the surroundings and a tempera­
ture above that of the surroundings. Heat pumps are generally used to keep 
the rooms warm in winter.
The transfer of heat against a reverse temperature gradient in a refrigerator 
and heat pump is accomplished by supplying energy to the machine. A sche­
matic representation of a heat pump and a refrigerator is shown in Figure 4.2.
FIGURE 4.2 Functional difference between a heat pump and a refrigerator.
In the context of refrigerators and heat pumps, the performance is 
expressed in terms of coefficient of performance (COP) which represents 
the ratio of the desired effect to work input
COP = desired effect 
work input
In a refrigerator, the desired effect is the amount of heat Q2 extracted 
from the space being cooled, that is, the space at low temperature:
heat extracted at low temperature Q2
(COP) ref = 
T~.

work input

158 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
From the principle of energy conservation,
W = Q1 - Q2
(COP)ref = QQQ 2
For most of the refrigerating machines, the values of COP lie between 3 
and 4, and the COP is greatest when temperature differences are least.
In a heat pump, the desired effect is the amount of heat Q1 supplied to 
the space being heated:
(COP)
heat rejected at high temperature

Q1Q-Q2 2
= 1 + 
, = 1 + (COP) ref
Q1- Q2
Thus, the COP of a machine operating as a heat pump is higher than the 
COP of the same machine when operating as a refrigerator by unity.
Note: In the context of a refrigerator system:
1. The amount of heat extracted from the body at low temperature that is, 
the space being cooled is called refrigerating effect.
2. The COP of a refrigerator based on the theoretical values of refrigerat­
ing effect and work input is termed as theoretical COP. The theoretical 
refrigerating effect and work input are calculated by applying the laws of 
thermodynamics to the refrigeration cycle.
3. The COP of a refrigerator based on actual values of refrigerating effect 
and work input is termed as actual COP. The actual refrigerating effect 
and work input are obtained during the test run on a refrigerating plant.
4. The ratio of actual COP to theoretical COP is known as relative COP.
Relative COP =
actual COP 
theroretical COP
5. Refrigeration efficiency is defined as the ratio of COP of a cycle to the 
COP of a Carnot cycle operating in the same temperature range.
6. A single machine can fulfill both the functions of cooling and heating 
simultaneously. For example, cool a food storage space as a refrigerator 
and heat a water system as a heat pump.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 159
4.3. RATING OR CAPACITY OF A REFRIGERATING UNIT
The refrigerating machines are usually rated in terms of their cooling capac­
ity; the standard unit is ton of refrigeration.
One ton of refrigeration is defined as the refrigerating effect that freezes 
one ton (2000 pound mass) of liquid water during a period of 24 hours. The 
water is to be liquid at 0°C before and ice at 0°C after the process:
2000 pound mass = ^000 = 907 kg.
2.205
Enthalpy of fusion of water at 0°C = 333.43 kJ/kg
1 ton of refrigeration =
907 x 333.43
24 x 60
= 210 kJ/min
= 3.5 kJ/s = 3.5 kW.
A ton of refrigeration is, thus, not a unit of mass but a measure of the rate 
of cooling. The refrigerating capacity decides the mass flow rate of a given 
working substance (refrigerant) working under specified conditions:
refrigeration capacity
Mass flow rate of refrigerant = refrigerating effect per unit mass'
Quite often, power needed to produce a refrigeration effect equivalent of 
1 ton of refrigeration is used as a measure to calculate the cost of operation or 
motor size of the refrigerating unit. Then,
kW per ton of refrigeration =
3.5 
COP'
Further, the ratio of heat removal rating (kJ/hr) of a refrigeration system 
to energy input (kWh) of the machine is called energy efficiency ratio (EER).
EXAMPLE 4.1
i. 
The capacity of a refrigeration system is specified to be 12 tons. 
What is then the cooling rate of the machine?
ii. 250 liters of drinking water is required per hour at 10°C. Would 
the use of 1.5 ton refrigerating system be justified if the available 
water is at 30°C?

160 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
iii. A refrigerating machine takes 1.25 kW and produces 25 kg/hr of 
ice at 0°C from water available at 30°C. Determine refrigerating 
effect, tonnage, and coefficient of performance of machine. Take
Specific heat of water = 4.18 kJ/kg K.
Enthalpy of solidification of water from and at 0°C = 335 kJ/kg
Solution: (i) 1 ton of refrigeration = 3.5 kJ/s
: Cooling rate of machine = 12 x 3.5 = 42 kJ/s.
(ii ) Refrigeration effect required for cooling the water
= mcp AT = 250 x 4.18 x (30-10) = 20900 kJ/h.
1 ton of refrigeration = 3.5 kJ/s = 12600 kJ/h.

4.4. METHODS OF REFRIGERATION
Refrigeration is the technique of producing the cooling effect by abstraction/ 
withdrawal of heat so that temperature below that of surroundings is pro­
duced in a substance or within a space. The desired cooling effect can be 
produced by

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 161
1. Evaporation
When a liquid evaporates, it absorbs heat from the surroundings equivalent 
to its latent heat of vaporization, and that results in lowering the temperature 
of the surroundings. For example, we feel the cooling effect when there is 
the evaporation of a drop of spirit placed on the palm of hand. Likewise, the 
evaporation of moisture from the skin of a human body helps keep it cool. 
There is a common practice to cool the water for drinking purposes by keep­
ing it in porous earthen pots. The water evaporates through the pores and that 
produces a cooling effect. The army people keep small water containers made 
of metal and covered with water-soaked namada; the walls of the metallic con­
tainer get cooled and that cools the water kept inside it. In the refrigeration 
literature, there is mention of an experiment where a pump was used to create 
a partial vacuum over a container of ethyl ether. The liquid is then boiled by 
absorbing heat from the surrounding air. The cooling effect so created even 
produced a small amount of ice.
The principle of evaporative refrigeration is employed in desert (room) 
coolers. The dry atmospheric air is made to pass through water-soaked pack­
ings. When this water evaporates, it takes heat from the air causing it to cool.
With reference to Figure 4.3, a 
volatile liquid (liquid nitrogen, liq­
uid carbon dioxide) contained in a 
flask evaporates and gets converted 
into gas. For evaporation, it absorbs 
heat from the chamber and a cooling 
effect is produced. The chamber is 
insulated to restrict the infiltration of 
heat from outside. The liquid N2 and 
CO2 are non-toxic and as such the 
liquid gas refrigeration finds applica­
tion for keeping the perishable food 
articles cool when being transported.
2. Dissolution of salts in water
When certain salts are dissolved in water, they absorb heat and lower the tem­
perature of water and create a sort of refrigeration bath for cooling substance. 
Sodium chloride lowers the water temperature up to - 20°C while calcium 
chloride up to - 50°C. The salt can be recovered by evaporation of water from 
the solution.
The method of producing the cooling effect by the dissolution of salt in 
water could not become feasible for commercial purposes because

162 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
(i) 
the refrigeration effect produced is quite small and
(ii) the process of regaining salt is cumbersome.
There has been a practice in France to produce cold drinks and liqueurs 
(a strong alcoholic drink with a sweet taste) by spinning long-necked bottles 
in water with dissolved saltpeter.
3. Ice refrigeration (change of phase)
The use of ice to refrigerate and, thus, preserve food goes back to prehistoric 
times and the ancient cultures of Chinese, Greeks, Romans, and Persians. Ice
and snow were stored in caves or dugouts lined with straw or other insulat-
ing materials. This practice worked well down through the centuries, with ice 
houses remaining in use. Greater work was done on developing better insula­
tion products for long-distance shipment of ice and the ice harvesting became
a big business.
The natural ice or artificially produced ice 
is brought into contact with the substance to 
be cooled. The ice melts and the heat required 
for the melting of ice is supplied by the sub­
stance being cooled. The cooling effect pro­
duced by ice is
Q = m x hf
where m and hsf are the rate of fusion of ice 
and enthalpy of fusion, respectively. At normal 
atmospheric pressure of 1.01325 bar (1 atm), 
hsf is equal to 335 kJ/kg.
The ice refrigerator consists of a cabinet, which is completely insulated.
The ice is kept in a container at the top, and a number of shelves are provided
in the space below the ice container for storing the foodstuff. When air comes 
in contact with ice, it becomes cool, dense, and flows down over the shelves.
It absorbs heat from the foodstuff which gets cooled. On absorption of heat, 
the air becomes warm. The warm air expands and returns back to the ice con­
tainer from bottom, sides, and back of the cabinet. When this warm air flows 
past the ice, it gives its heat to the ice and gets cooled. On cooling, the air 
becomes dense and once again flows down over the food shelves. Tempera­
tures in the range of 5 to 10° can be obtained with ice refrigeration. In case, 
temperatures below this range are required, and salt is mixed with ice and that 
results in reducing the temperature level to 0°C.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 163
Ice refrigeration prevents dehydration and preserves the fresh appear­
ance of eatable products like fruit and vegetables. However, ice has to be 
fed to the refrigerator and on and that is neither convenient nor economical. 
Further, water coming out of the refrigerator poses a problem in its disposal.
Although the ice-harvesting industry had grown immensely by the turn of 
the 20th century, pollution and sewage had begun to creep into natural ice, and 
eventually, breweries began to complain of tainted ice. This raised demand 
for more modern and consumer-ready refrigeration and ice-making machines.
4. Dry ice refrigeration (sublimation)
Solid carbon dioxide (called dry ice) has a peculiar characteristic that it 
changes from solid-state to vapor state without passing through the liquid 
state. During the change of phase, it absorbs heat equivalent to its latent heat 
of vaporization and produces a cooling effect. This process occurs when the 
solid is maintained below the triple point. Then,
Q = m hsv, 
where hsv is the enthalpy of evaporation.
At one atmospheric pressure, solid CO2 produces 573 kJ/kg of refrigera­
tion maintaining a temperature of - 78.5°C. Dry ice is used to preserve food­
stuff during transportation. The slabs of ice are usually packed on either side 
or on top of food packages in cartons. When dry ice evaporates, it absorbs heat 
from the foodstuff and preserves it in the frozen state.
The refrigeration methods (1) to (4) as mentioned above are called the 
natural methods. These methods are non-cyclic, and the temperatures 
attainable are limited. Further, there is continuous consumption of the refrig­
erating substance and that necessitates replenishment. However, these meth­
ods are sometimes convenient forms of cooling where small refrigeration is 
required such as in the laboratory and workshop.
5. Chemical methods
Here the heat required for the completion of the chemical reaction is taken 
from the substance being cooled.
The chemical method for producing a cooling effect cannot be followed 
on a commercial scale.
6. Air or gas refrigeration
Expansion of gas lowers its pressure and temperature. This cooling effect 
results without change in the phase of gas.

164 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Consider air initially compressed is entropically from atmospheric condi­
tions (p1 = 1 atm and T1 = 15°C) to 5 atm. The temperature after compression 
then would be
Z 
1.4-1
I P I g ( 5 I 1.4
T = T\p2 I = 2881-|
21 I Pi J 
11J
= 456.3 K.
The compressed air may be next cooled to an initial (presume) temperature 
of 15°C in a heat exchanger without any loss of pressure. Then at state point 
3, T3 = 288 K and p3 = 5 atm. Subsequently, the cooled high pressure can be 
expanded in a suitable device to the original pressure of 1 atm (state point 4). 
Then temperature after expansion will be
Z 
1.4-1
( P I g ( 1 ^ 1.4
T4 = T3\p- I = 2881-I = 181.8K = -91.2°C
IP 3 J 
15 )
The different air refrigeration systems use this thermodynamic principle 
for producing low temperatures.
7. Throttling process
Throttling is the expansion of fluid 
from high pressure to low pres­
sure. This process occurs when fluid 
passes through an obstruction (par­
tially opened valve or a small orifice) 
placed in the fluid flow passage.
Figure 4.5 shows the schemat­
ics of the porous plug experiment 
performed by Joule and Thomson 
in 1852. A stream of incompressible
FIGURE 4.5 Schematic of porous plug apparatus.
fluid (gas) is made to pass steadily through a porous plug placed in an insulated 
and horizontal pipe. The upstream conditions of pressure Pi and temperature
Ti are held constant, and the corresponding values at exit are measured. The 
friction of the narrow passage causes the pressure to drop, and accordingly, 
the exit pressure Pe is less than the intake pressure Pi.
A throttling process is characterized by the following features:
— no shaft work is involved,
— no heat interaction as the pipe is thermally insulated,

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 165
— no change in potential energy (z1 = z2) as the pipe is placed horizontally, and 
— negligible changes in kinetic energy.
With these stipulations, the steady flow energy equation
h 1 + VL + gz 1 + q = h 2 + VL + gz 2 + w
22 
transforms to
h1 = h2, that is, enthalpy of fluid remains constant during throttling.
Thus, the throttling expansion process is an isenthalpic process. If the 
fluid undergoing throttling behaves as an ideal gas for which h = cpT, we get
cpT1 = cpT2; T1 = T2
Again for a perfect gas, internal energy is a function of temperature alone 
and equality of temperature implies that u1 = u2. Apparently, a throttling pro­
cess takes place at constant enthalpy, constant temperature, and constant 
internal energy.
Throttling is an irreversible process and involves the degradation of 
energy and its dissipation in turbulence.
Joule-Thomson Coefficient, Inversion Point, and Inversion Curve
For real gases, enthalpy is a function 
of both temperature and pressure. As such 
even though enthalpy remains constant 
during throttling, the temperature needs 
not to remain the same. Experimental test 
runs can be conducted by keeping upstream 
conditions constant but with different down­
stream pressures. This is achieved by having 
porous plugs of different sizes. The exit tem­
perature of the fluid at different exit pres­
sures is measured. Since the upstream pres­
sure and temperature conditions are kept 
FIGURE 4.6 I senthalpy and inversion.
constant, the enthalpy of the fluid for all measured conditions of exit pres­
sure and temperature would be constant. The results are plotted as a constant
enthalpy (isenthalpy) curve on T — p diagram. Several enthalpy curves can be 
obtained by repeating the experiments with several inlet conditions.
The slope of an isenthalpic curve is called the Joule-Thomson coefficient, 
J.. That is
,, JTL 
m JT I a.
h = constant

166 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 4.7 Refrigeration by 
throttling of a gas.
This coefficient may be +ve, -ve, or zero. 
The point on the isenthalpic curve where 
PjT = 0 is called the inversion point. Thus, the 
inversion point denotes the maximum value of 
temperature on T-p plot. The locus of all inver­
sion points is called the inversion curve. The 
Joule-Thomson coefficient is positive on the 
left side of inversion curve, is zero at the inver­
sion point, and is negative on the right side of 
inversion curve.
Throttling is always accompanied by pres­
sure drop, that is, Дp is -ve. That leads to drop 
in temperature when J is +ve. Accordingly 
when a real gas is throttled at the condition 
such that its state lies to the left of inversion curve, the gas will get cooled. 
Thus, the region of J > 0 represents the region of cooling. Likewise, when 
p.jT is -ve, the temperature change is +ve, and therefore, the throttling of real 
gas would produce heating effect.
A knowledge of the inversion temperatures and inversion curves of real 
gases is of considerable importance in the design of refrigeration and lique­
faction equipment. The use of positive values of Joule-Thomson coefficient is 
made in the liquefaction of gases such as air, nitrogen, and oxygen.
Refer to Figure 4.7 which shows a simplified arrangement of refrigera­
tion by throttling of a gas. The throttling process occurs when the gas at high 
pressure with its temperature below its critical temperature is made to pass 
through a valve with a restricted opening. Upon throttling, the temperature of 
gas reduces and a cooling effect is produced.
8. Mechanical refrigeration
The natural and chemical methods have been successfully replaced by 
mechanical or heat-energy refrigeration techniques. In these methods, the 
heat is abstracted from the substance, or space (which is to be cooled) is 
pumped to a system (which is at high-temperature level) by taking energy 
from an external source as input to the refrigerating machine. The refrigera­
tion system consists of a cycle of processes with the same quantity of working 
fluid (refrigerant) in continuous circulation.
The first commercial hand-operated refrigeration system was developed 
in the UK by Perkins. The system consisted of a hand-operated compressor, 
a water-cooled condenser, a throttle valve, and an evaporator. The working 
substance (ether) was compressed in the hand-operated compressor and then 

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 167
condensed in the water-cooled condensing unit. Thereafter, the liquid ether 
was throttled to low pressure and taken to the evaporator where heat was 
absorbed and a cooling effect was produced. The refrigerant ether was used 
again and again in the cyclic process with negligible wastage. Subsequent 
developments took place in the United States where the steam engine was 
used as a prime mover to drive the compressor. The scope got further wid­
ened with the development of electric motors and consequent high speeds of 
the compressor. Ether too was replaced by new working substances.
Mechanical refrigeration systems are broadly classified into
• • air or gas refrigeration,
• • vapor compression system,
• • vapor absorption system, and
• • steam jet refrigeration.
The energy needed for the mechanical systems is essential in the form of 
mechanical, electrical, or thermal. Due to world energy crisis, concerted 
efforts are being made by various agencies to develop refrigeration systems 
that utilize waste heat, solar energy, wind energy, and bio-energy for their 
functioning. A lot of research is being done to devise ways and means which 
make refrigeration systems more energy efficient.
9. Non-conventional refrigeration systems
• • Thermoelectric cooling uses the Peltier effect to create a heat flux 
between the junctions of two different types of materials.
When a direct current is made to pass through electrical junctions between 
unlike metals, heating or cooling effect is produced depending on the 
direction of flow of current. One junction gets heated and the other gets 
cooled. The cold junction is located inside the space desired to be cooled 
and the warmed junction lies outside in the surroundings. The hot and 
cold junctions get reversed when a change occurs in the direction of the 
flow of current. Apparently, the same setup can be used for heating and 
cooling of an insulated space.
FIGURE 4.8 Th ermoelectric cooling: Peltier effect.

168 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
With respect to Figure 4.8, the energy balance of the system is
Qh - Qc = EI
where E is the emf applied, I is the current, Qh and Qc are the actual 
amount of heat flows at the hot and cold junctions, respectively.
This effect is commonly used in camping and portable coolers, and for 
cooling electronic components and small instruments.
• • Magnetic refrigeration (adiabatic demagnetization) is a cooling tech­
nology based on magnet caloric effect, an intrinsic property of magnetic 
solids. A strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its 
various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of 
the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy. A heat sink then absorbs 
the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal 
contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated 
and the magnetic field is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of 
the refrigerant, thus, decreasing its temperature below the temperature 
of heat sink.
The refrigerant is often a paramagnetic salt such as cerium magnesium 
nitrate, and the active magnetic dipoles are those of electron shells of the

• • Thermoacoustic refrigeration uses sound waves in a pressurized gas to 
drive heat exchange.
• • Vortex tube that operates with compressed air and is used for spot cool­
ing. A high-pressure gas is allowed to expand through a nozzle fitted tan­
gentially to a pipe. This causes a simultaneous discharge of cool air at the 
core and hot air at the periphery.
The mechanical refrigeration and the non-conventional refrigeration sys­
tems have been dealt with in detail at appropriate places.
4.5. APPLICATIONS OF REFRIGERATION
Refrigeration has played an important role in the growth and attainment of 
the present-day standard of living. Its various applications can be essentially 
grouped into the following categories:
1. Domestic refrigeration deals with providing a low-temperature place 
for preserving eatables, drinks, and medicines. The use of refrigerators in our 

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 169
kitchens for the storage of fruits and vegetables has allowed us to add fresh 
salads to our diets year-round, and to store fish and meats for long periods.
2. Commercial refrigeration is related to refrigeration fixtures of the 
type used by restaurants and hotels, retail stores, and institutions for storing, 
displaying, processing, and dispensing perishable commodities of different 
types.
3. Industrial refrigeration is concerned with systems that are much 
larger in size and cooling capacity than those for commercial applications. 
Typical industrial applications are
• • ice and large food plants,
• • chilling and storage of foodstuffs including beverages, meat, poul­
try products, dairy products, vegetables, fruits and fruit juices, etc.,
• • processing of food products and farm crops,
• • processing of textiles, printing work, and photographic materials, 
and
• • oil refineries and synthetic rubber manufacturing. In oil refineries, 
chemical manufacturing, and petrochemical plants, refrigeration 
is used to maintain processes at their required low temperatures.
Refrigeration is also used to liquefy gases like oxygen, nitrogen, propane, 
and methane. Further, in compressed air purification, it is used to condense 
water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture air content.
4. Transport refrigeration applies to refrigerated railway cars and 
trucks for local delivery and long-distance transport of temperature-sensitive 
foodstuffs and other materials.
5. Air conditioning refers to the simultaneous control of temperature, 
humidity, cleanliness, and air motion. The conditioning of a space done to 
provide comfortable and healthy conditions for the occupants is called com­
fort air conditioning. Residences, offices, theaters, and hospitals are the spaces 
air-conditioned for this purpose.
There are some manufacturing processes that need to be done under con­
trolled environmental conditions. Even some of the sophisticated and preci­
sion instruments need controlled conditions for their effective working and 
upkeep. The conditioning done for this purpose is called industrial air condi­
tioning, and this is concerned with the production of environment suitable for
•• 
computer centers,
•• 
pharmaceutical units,
•• 
printing works and photographic products,
•• 
precision devices and production shop laboratories, etc.

170 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The applications cited above clearly indicate that refrigeration and air 
conditioning which was considered a luxury in the society a few decades ago 
have become the necessity of the present society and a tool for higher pro­
ductivity.
4.6. DOMESTIC REFRIGERATOR
A domestic refrigerator serves to preserve food products (fruits and vegeta­
bles, meat and fish, milk and ice cream, cold drinks, etc.). The unit absorbs 
heat from these products and dissipates that heat to the surroundings by tak­
ing the power of a compressor.
The domestic refrigerator works on vapor compression refrigeration 
cycle, and consists of the following parts: compressor, condenser, capillary 
tube, and evaporator.
These components are schematically arranged as shown in Figure 4.9 and 
mounted on the refrigerator which has enamel painted metallic body with 
interior plastic lining of polystyrene.
The system works on the closed cyclic operation and transfers heat 
through a medium called refrigerant which is usually Freon-12. The refriger­
ant changes its phase when it passes through condenser and evaporator.
The sequence of operation of the refrigeration cycle is as follows:
1. Reversible adiabatic compression (1-2): The refrigerant vapor at low 
pressure and temperature and preferably in the dry state is drawn from the 
evaporator during the suction stroke of the compressor. The compressor con­
stricts the vapor raising its pressure and temperature.
The compression is of reciprocating type and is hermetically sealed which 
means that the compressor and electric motor are a single unit enclosed in a 
container.
2. Constant pressure condensation (2-3): The vapor refrigerant at high 
pressure and temperature (state 2) coming from the compressor is pushed 
into the condenser coils which are painted black and are located on the back 
of the refrigerator. The hot refrigerant passes through these coils, which 
meets the cooler air of the kitchen and becomes a liquid.
3. Throttling (3-4): The high-pressure refrigerant in the liquid state is 
throttled in the capillary tube. The capillary tube is a simple copper tube of 
low diameter and long length. This increases friction and that causes pressure 
drop leading to conversion of high-pressure liquid into low-pressure liquid.

vapour mixture
FIGURE 4.9 Vapor compression cycle for a domestic refrigerator.
4. Constant pressure evaporation (4-1): The wet vapor after throttling 
passes through evaporator coils placed inside the refrigerator. The refriger­
ant absorbs heat from the food staff which gets cooled. The refrigerant itself 
vaporizes to gaseous state at constant pressure and flows to the compressor.
The cycle is completed and the process starts all over again.
The condenser and evaporator are the simple heat exchangers where 
the refrigerant changes the phase by rejecting heat (to the condenser) and 
accepting heat (from the evaporator). The unit has a thermostat that controls 
the cooling process by monitoring the temperature and then switching the 
compressor on or off. When the sensor senses that it is cold enough inside the 
refrigerator, it turns off the compressor. If too much heat is sensed, it switches 
the compressor and the cooling process begins again.
The domestic refrigerators are available in a wide range of sizes and 
designs and are specified by cooling capacity (refrigerating effect in tons), 
cooling in liters, overall dimensions (height, width, and depth), refrigerant 
used, and voltage range and power source (AC 230 V, 50 hertz). The refrig­
erant Freon-12 is now being replaced by HFC-134a which does not deplete 
the ozone layer.

4.7. PSYCHROMETRY
Psychrometry is the science of studying the thermodynamic properties of 
moist air and the use of these properties to analyze the conditions and pro­
cesses involving moist air.
For many purposes, the composition of real air can be assumed to be a 
mixture of two components:
Standard dry air: Dry air is a mixture of number of gases such as oxygen, 
nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, argon, etc. Oxygen and nitrogen are the 
main constituents with the following composition:
21% oxygen and 79% of nitrogen .... by volume
23% oxygen and 77% nitrogen .... by mass
The molecular mass of dry air is taken as 20.966 and gas constant is equal 
to 287 J/kgK. For psychrometric purpose, dry air is assumed to be a pure sub­
stance and not a mixture.
Water vapor: Air has affinity for water, and consequently, the atmo­
spheric air always contains some water; water vapor content varies from 0 to 
3% by mass.
The moist air is essentially a mixture of dry air and water vapor. The 
amount of water vapor present depends on the absolute pressure and tem­
perature of the mixture.
For the moist air, which is a mixture of dry air and water vapor,
pt = pa + pv,
where pt = total pressure of moist air 
pa = partial pressure of dry air 
pv = partial pressure of water vapor.
The saturated air mixture is the mixture of dry air and water vapor in 
which the partial pressure of the water vapor is equal to its saturation pressure 
corresponding to the temperature of the mixture.
The unsaturated air mixture is the mixture of dry air and water vapor 
in which the partial pressure of the water vapor is less than its saturation pres­
sure corresponding to the temperature of the mixture.
The supersaturated air mixture is a mixture of dry air and water vapor 
in which the partial pressure of the water vapor is greater than its saturation 
pressure corresponding to the temperature of the mixture.

4.8. PARTIAL PRESSURE AND DALTON’S LAW
Consider a homogeneous non-reacting mixture of ideal gases a, b, c, ..., etc., at 
temperature T, pressure p, and occupying a volume V (Figure 4.10).
Further, let it be presumed that each constituent of the mixture exists 
separately at temperature T and volume V, and pressures pa, pb, pc, ... exerted 
by individual gases are measured separately. Each of these pressures would 
be less than the total pressure p of the mixture.
FIGURE 4.10.
When the equation of state for an ideal gas is applied to the gas mixture as 
well as the constituent gases, we have
For the mixture,
pV = mRT
= nMRT = nRmolT 
(4.2)
where Rmol is the universal gas constant (Rmol = 8314 J/kg mole K) and M 
is the molecular mass.
For the constituent gases,
pa V = na RmolT
pb V = nb RmolT
pc V = nc RmolT, etc.
Upon adding the components,
(pa + pb + pc + ...) V = (na + nb + nc + ...) RmolT
= nRmolT 
(4.3)
From expressions 7.4 and 7.5,
p = pa + pb + pc + ...
P = ^ р( 
(4.4)

174 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
where pi = n^mo^ represents the pressure; the component i would exert
if it alone occupied the volume V at temperature T. This is called the partial 
pressure of the ith component of the gas mixture. Thus,
Partial pressure is defined as the pressure that each individual 
component of a gas mixture would exert if it alone occupied the volume 
of the mixture at the same temperature.
Further, Equation 4.4 stipulates that the total pressure of a mixture of 
ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gas 
components of the mixture.
This is known as Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
The following relations are implicit in the Dalton’s law:
t = ta = tb = tc
V = Va = Vb = Vc
and 
m = ma + mb + mc 
(4.5)
where t, V, and m, respectively, represent the temperature, volume, and 
mass. In terms of specific volume v,
m v = ma va = mb vb = mc vc 
(4.6)
Combining expressions 7.7 and 7.8, we may write
mmmm 
__ a + b + c 
mv mava mbvb mcvc
or 
1 = ± + ± +1 
(4.7)
v va vb vc
The reciprocal of specific volume is density, and so, we can write
P = P a + P b + P c 
(4.8)
which means that density of the mixture is equal to the sum of the densi­
ties of the components.
4.9. SPECIFIC HUMIDITY, RELATIVE HUMIDITY, AND
DEGREE OF SATURATION
Humidity refers to the dampness, that is, the water content of air. Absolute 
humidity represents the amount of water vapor actually present in the air, 
expressed as gram per cubic meter of air.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 175
The specific humidity or humidity ratio or moisture content is the 
ratio of mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air in a given volume of the 
mixture. Consider a mixture consisting of ma kg of dry air and mv kg of water 
vapor contained in a vessel of volume V at total pressure pt and temperature 
T. Then

The above relation shows that if the total pressure remains constant, the 
specific humidity is a function of partial pressure of water vapor only. This 
relationship has been obtained by assuming that behavior of water vapor is 
identical to that of an ideal gas. Such an assumption is quite valid at low pres­
sure and normal humidity conditions.
The relative humidity is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the 
amount of water vapor actually present in a given volume of air to the maxi­
mum amount that the air could hold under the same pressure and tempera­
ture conditions.

Also Vv = Vvs; Rv = Rvs; and Tv = Tvs.
That gives
ф = 
(4.10)
pvs
where pvs is the saturation pressure at the temperature of the mixture. 
This saturation pressure is obtained from the steam tables corresponding to 
the given temperature.
Apparently, the relative humidity can also be defined as the ratio of the par­
tial pressure of water vapor in a given volume of mixture to the partial pressure 
of water vapor when the same volume of the mixture is saturated at the same 
temperature. This implies that ф is equal to unity for saturated air; 100 percent 
relative humidity means that air contains the maximum moisture it can hold.
Essentially, the term relative humidity compares the humidity of the given 
air with the humidity of saturated air at the same pressure and temperature. 
For saturated air, the relative humidity is 100 percent.
The degree of saturation ц represents the ratio of mass of water vapor 
associated with the unit mass of dry air to the mass of water vapor associated 
with the unit mass of dry air saturated at the same temperature:
mass of water vapor with unit mass of dry air 
m = mass of water vapor with unit mass of dry saturated air .
This relation implies that ц represents the ratio of specific humidity of 
moist air to specific humidity of saturated air at the same temperature. That is

The following observations can be made from the above relation:
i. 
If the air is dry, then pv = 0, and therefore, ц = 0.
If the relative humidity « = pv / pvs = 1, then pv = pVs and accordingly ц = 1.
Thus, the degree of saturation varies between 0 and 1.
ii. The degree of saturation is a measure of the capacity of the air to absorb 
moisture.
When ц = 1, then « = «s
which implies that air is holding the maximum amount of water vapor.
iii. The expression for the degree of saturation can be recast as follows:

4.10. DRY-BULB TEMPERATURE AND WET-BULB
TEMPERATURE
The dry-bulb temperature (dbt) is the normal temperature of an air-vapor 
mixture as indicated or recorded by any temperature measuring device placed 
in the mixture. This temperature is not affected by the moisture content in 
the mixture.

178 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The wet-bulb temperature (wbt) 
of an air-vapor mixture is the tempera­
ture measured by a thermometer of 
which bulb is covered by a wick soaked 
in water. When the air passes over the 
wet wick, the moisture contained in 
the wick tends to evaporate. That pro­
duces a cooling effect at the bulb and 
an equilibrium temperature lower than 
that of the air stream is recorded.
It is worthwhile to note that

i. 
The wet-bulb temperature is lower than the dry-bulb temperature 
and the difference is known as the wet-bulb depression.
ii. The wet-bulb depression is greatest when the air is initially completely 
dry, that is, capable of absorbing a maximum amount of moisture.
iii. When the air is initially saturated, there will be no evaporation of water, 
and hence, the two thermometers will record equal temperatures. 
This implies that the depression is zero with 100% relative humidity.
iv. The dry- and wet-bulb temperatures are simultaneously measured by 
instruments called psychrometers.
A sling psychrometer consists of 
two identical mercury-in-glass ther­
mometers mounted on a suitable frame 
and arranged with a swivel-mounted 
handle as shown in Figure 4.12. The 
temperature-sensing bulb of one of the 
thermometers is covered with a knitted 
FIGURE 4.12 Sling psychrometer.
or woven cotton wick which is wetted with pure clean water. For better and 
accurate measurements of the wet-bulb temperature, a fast movement of air 
past the moistened wick is necessary. This is to ensure that the surrounding 
air does not cling to the moistened wick and that the air at the wet-bulb ther­
mometer is always in immediate contact with the wet wick. The necessary 
air motion, 5 m/s to 10 m/s, is provided by rotating the psychrometer frame 
with the swivel-mounted handle. The readings are taken after swinging the 
psychrometer in a smooth circular path for 15 to 20 seconds. With a too-short 
duration, the temperature will not be depressed to its proper value. If the 
swinging period is too large, the wick will dry and the bulb temperature will 
not remain at its minimum value.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 179
v. When dry- and wet-bulb temperatures are known, the other psychro­
metric properties can be determined by calculations.
vi. Many investigations have suggested different expressions to deter­
mine the partial pressure of water vapor in air from the wet- and dry­
bulb temperature readings. Carrier’s equation, as given below, is most 
widely used.
Р. = (p„) wb - (pt— pvs )(dbt — Wbt) 
(4.13)
1544-1.44wbt
where pv = partial pressure of water vapor
pvs = partial pressure of water vapor when air is fully saturated
pt = total (barometric pressure of moist air)
dbt and wbt = dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperature, respectively, in °C.
4.11. DEW-POINT AND ADIABATIC SATURATION 
TEMPERATURE
Dew point refers to the temperature at which the mixture becomes satu­
rated, that is, the moisture (water vapor) present in the mixture begins to
condense consequent to continuous cooling at constant pressure.
With reference to Figure 4.13, let point 1 represent the initial state of 
air-water vapor mixture. The vapor is superheated, the pressure equals the 
partial pressure of the superheated vapor and temperature corresponds to 
the temperature of the mixture. When the mixture is cooled at constant pres­
sure along paths 1-3, the cooling continues until the vapor attains the sat- 
urated state at point 3. With 
further cooling, the vapor 
condenses, that is, the mois­
ture is released. The state 
point 3 represents the dew­
point temperature (dpt) of 
the air-water vapor mixture. 
The dew-point temperature, 
thus, corresponds to the 
saturation temperature of 
steam at the partial pressure
FIGURE 4.13 Concept of dew-point temperature.

of water vapor in the mixture. For saturated air, the dry-bulb temperature, the 
wet-bulb temperature, and the dew-point temperature are same.
Unsaturated air 
ti-h,,®!
FIGURE 4.14 Concept of adiabatic saturation process.
The adiabatic saturation temperature (or the thermodynamic wet-bulb 
temperature) refers to the temperatures at which the air can be brought 
adiabatically to saturation state by the evaporation of water into a flowing 
stream.
Consider a stream of unsaturated air-vapor mixture flowing over a sur­
face of water contained in a chamber that is sufficiently long and is per­
fectly insulated. Due to intimate contact between the unsaturated air and 
liquid water, some of the water evaporates and is carried by air resulting in 
an increase in its humidity. The heat required for evaporation comes both 
from the air-vapor mixture and the liquid water in the chamber. The process 
continues until the energy transferred from the air to the water is equal to 
the energy required to vaporize the water. By the time, air reaches the exit 
section, it becomes saturated and an equilibrium is established. The tem­
perature of the saturated air at the exit section is known as adiabatic satu­
ration temperature or the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature. The 
steady-state thermal equilibrium conditions are maintained by adding make 
up water steadily at the rate of evaporation. This make up water has to be at 
the adiabatic saturation temperature, that is, the temperature of the mixture 
at the exit section.
With reference to Figure 4.14, the adiabatic saturation process is repre­
sented by paths 1-2. During the adiabatic saturation process, the partial pres­
sure of vapor increases, although the total pressure of the air-vapor mixture 
remains constant. The unsaturated air at dry-bulb temperature t1 is cooled 
adiabatically to dry-bulb temperature t2 which is equal to adiabatic saturation 
temperature t*. For all practical purposes, the adiabatic saturation tempera­
ture is taken equal to wet-bulb temperature.

4.12. PSYCHROMETRIC CHART
The subject which deals with the behavior of moist air is known as psychrom­
etry, and the properties of moist air are called psychrometric properties.
Humidity calculations can be made by using the equations relating the 
dry- and wet-bulb temperatures to the humidity. The method, however, tends 
to be tedious, cumbersome, and time consuming. The key to humidity calcu­
lations is then provided by the Psychrometric or Hygrometric chart which 
graphically describes the relationship between the properties of moist air, that 
is, the dry-bulb, the wet-bulb, and dew-point temperatures of the mixture and 
its humidity. Figure 4.15 shows how these parameters are laid out on a typical 
psychrometric chart.
The psychrometric chart has the number of details and its salient aspects are
1. The dry-bulb temperature is taken as abscissa and specific humidity 
(i.e., moisture content) as ordinate.
The dry-bulb temperature lines are vertical and uniformly spaced. The 
specific humidity lines are horizontal and also uniformly spaced. The satura­
tion curve is drawn by plotting the various saturation points at corresponding 
dry-bulb temperatures. The saturation curve represents 100 percent relative 
humidity at various dry-bulb temperatures. It also indicates the wet-bulb and 
dew-point temperatures.

184 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
2. The dew-point temperature lines are horizontal and non-uniformly 
spaced. At any point on the saturation curve, the dry- and dew-point tempera­
tures are equal.
The wet-bulb temperature lines run diagonally to the right and their val­
ues are read at the left where these lines meet the 100 percent relative humid­
ity line. These lines are inclined and straight but not uniformly spaced.

quantity of moisture actually present in the air as a percentage of the total

are indicated by obliquely inclined straight lines. These lines are uniformly

Locate the state point S on the psychrometric chart. This is the point 
where a constant dry-bulb temperature line corresponding to 25°C intersects 
the wet-bulb temperature line corresponding to 15°C.
At this point, the following properties can be read:
i. 
Relative humidity = 33.5%
ii. 
A horizontal line to the right from state point S would represent a con­
stant humidity ratio line; its value being
и = 0.0067 kg of water/kg of dry air
iii. A horizontal line to the left drawn from the state point S would intersect 
the saturation line; the temperature at the intersecting point gives the 
value of dew-point temperature equal to dpt = 8°C.
iv. The constant wet-bulb temperature line is produced to meet the enthalpy 
line; the enthalpy value approximates to 43 kJ/kg of dry air.
v. 
A horizontal line drawn from the state point S meets the vapor pressure 
scale at 0.0105 bar. This represents the partial pressure of the vapor.
vi. Saturation pressure corresponding to dbt = 25°C can be obtained by 
drawing a horizontal line to the left from the point where dbt = 25°C 
line cuts the 100% relative humidity line. The saturation pressure value 
is 0.0316 bar.
vii. Saturation pressure corresponding to the wet-bulb temperature is obtained 
by drawing a horizontal line to the left from the point where wbt = 15°C 
line cuts the 100% relative humidity line. Here, the pressure is scaled as 
0.0166 bar.
viii. Humidity ratio corresponding 25°C dry-bulb temperature can be obtained 
by drawing a horizontal line to the right from the point where dbt = 25°C 
line cuts the 100% relative humidity line. The corresponding value is 
scaled as 0.0202 kg of water/kg of dry air.
The degree of saturation is then calculated as follows:
w
m =—
ws
0.0067
0.0202
= 33%.
EXAMPLE 4. 6
The atmospheric air at 35°C dbt and 25°C wbt is cooled to 20°C. Using 
psychrometric chart, find (i) humidity ratio, (ii) relative humidity, and 
(iii) dew-point temperature. Comment whether or not there will be 
any condensation on the duct that supplies this cooled air to the con­
ditioned space.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 187
Solution: Locate the condition of air at 35°C 
dbt and 25°C wbt (Point 1) on the psychrometric 
chart and read there from
Humidity ratio « = 0.016 kg/kg of dry air
Relative humidity ф = 0.45 or 45%
Dew-point temperature dpt = 18.4°C
The condensation of moisture begins to take 
place when the dew-point temperature has been 
reached. Since the air is cooled only to 20°C 
which is higher than the dew-point temperature, 
there will be no condensation of moisture on the 
duct surface.

4.13. PSYCHROMETRIC PROCESSES
The most common processes in air conditioning which involve the air-water 
vapor mixture are mentioned below and indicated on the psychrometric chart 
in Figure 4.22.
The initial state is represented by point 0. Heating and cooling processes 
are represented by horizontal lines while humidification and dehumidifi­
cation plot as vertical lines. Humidification represents the process wherein 

188 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
the moisture is added to air, but its dry-bulb temperature is maintained con­
stant. In dehumidification process, the moisture is removed from air without 
changing its dry-bulb temperature. The combination of these processes are 
set between them.
4.13.1. Sensible heating
The mixture is heated without any change in its moisture content. The process 
results when the mixture is made to pass over a surface of which temperature 
is above the dry-bulb temperature of the mixture. The heating surface may be 
the electric resistance-heating coils or steam passed through the coils or hot 
water passed through the coils.
With reference to Figure 4.22, the process of sensible heating is repre­
sented by horizontal line O-A that extends from left to right.
4.13.2. Sensible cooling
The mixture is cooled without any change in its moisture content. The process 
results when the mixture is made to pass over a surface of which temperature 
is below the dry-bulb temperature of the mixture. The cooling surface may be 
cooled water or gas flowing through coils or the refrigerant at low tempera­
ture in the coils of the evaporator of a vapor refrigeration system.
With reference to Figure 4.22, the process of sensible cooling is repre­
sented by horizontal line O-B that extends from right to left.
4.13.3. Humidification and dehumidification
Humidification represents the process wherein the moisture is added but its 
dry-bulb temperature is maintained constant. In dehumidification process, 
the moisture is removed from air without changing its dry-bulb temperature. 
These processes are obviously represented as vertical lines on the psychro­
metric chart.
With reference to Figure 4.22, it may be noted that in humidification pro­
cess O-C, there is increase both in the specific humidity and relative humid­
ity. However, in dehumidification process O-D, both the specific humidity 
and relative humidity decrease.
In practice, pure humidification and dehumidification processes are not 
possible. These are always accompanied by heating or cooling.
4.13.4. Heating and humidification
The process is achieved when the moist air is made to pass through spray 
water of which temperature is maintained at a temperature higher than the 

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 189
dry-bulb temperature of the air. The unsaturated air tends to become satu­
rated and the heat of vaporization is absorbed from the spray water.
With reference to Figure 4.22, the process of heating and humidification 
is represented by line O-G, and it is to be noted that during this process:
i. There is increase in specific humidity, dry- and wet-bulb temperatures, 
dew-point temperature, and enthalpy.
ii. The relative humidity may either increase or decrease.
The process of heating and humidification has practical application in 
winter air conditioning.
4.13.5. Cooling and dehumidification
The process takes place when the moist air is passed through a cooling coil of 
which effective surface temperature is lower than the dew-point temperature 
of the mixture.
With reference to Figure 4.22, the process of the cooling and dehumidifi­
cation is represented by line O-F, and it is to be noted that during this process
i. the dry-bulb temperature decreases,
ii. the air is cooled and condensation of moisture takes place, that is, it is 
dehumidification,
iii. there is decrease in specific humidity, and
iv. the relative humidity at outlet is generally higher than that at inlet.
The cooling and dehumidification process has practical application in 
summer air conditioning.
4.13.6. Adiabatic mixing
The process takes place when two streams of moist air having different spe­
cific humidities and enthalpies are allowed to mix without the addition or 
rejection of either heat or moisture, that is, adiabatically and at constant total 
moisture content.
The state of the resultant mixture lies on the straight line that joins the 
state of two streams on psychrometric chart. The location of final state on the 
straight line depends on the masses involved, and on the enthalpy and specific 
heat of each stream.

4.14. AIR CONDITIONING
Air conditioning is an artificial process that involves cooling as well as heat­
ing coupled with ventilation, filtration, and air circulation. It is essentially the 
process of treating air to control simultaneously its temperature, humidity, 
cleanliness, and distribution to meet the comfort requirements of the occu­
pants of the conditioned space. The functioning of an air-conditioning system 
can be conceived as depicted in Figure 4.23.
Apart from the creation of an acceptable thermal environment (controlled 
temperature), control of humidity is of great importance both in humid and 
arid climates. Further, the air inside the conditioned space gets fouled due to 
absorption of pollutants from different sources and for human comfort, the 
indoor air has be purified.
FIGURE 4.23 Functioning of air conditioning.
4.15. APPLICATIONS OF AIR CONDITIONING
Air conditioning which was once considered as luxury, has now become 
a necessity in our day-to-day life. The air conditioning has applications in 
diverse fields such as
i. 
Residential and office buildings,
ii. Hospitals, cinema halls, and departmental stores,
iii. Libraries, museums, computer centers, and research laboratories,
iv. Transport vehicles:
a. cars, buses, and rail coaches,
b. aircrafts, space shuttles, and rockets,
c. submarines.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 191
iv. Printing, textile, and photographic 
products,
v. Food and process industries,
vi. Production shop laboratories, 
manufacture of materials, and 
precision devices.
Air conditioning essentially per­
forms three services in the manufac-

FIGURE 4.24 Relationship of refrigeration and 
air conditioning.
ture of precision metal parts. These services are
a. maintenance of uniform temperatures so that the metals neither 
expand nor contract,
b. control of humidity so that the rusting of metals is prevented, and
c. 
filtration of air so as to minimize dust. Cleanliness of air-conditioned 
space is absolutely essential where electronic components are being 
manufactured.
The fields of refrigeration and air conditioning are very closely inter­
related as indicated in Figure 4.24.
4.16. COMFORT AIR CONDITIONING AND ITS TYPES
Comfort air conditioning deals with the creation of an optimum environ­
mental condition conducive to human health, comfort, and efficiency. Air­
conditioning systems in homes, offices, stores, restaurants, theaters, schools, 
and hospitals are of this type.
The comfort air-conditioning systems are generally classified into the fol­
lowing three categories:
• • Summer air conditioning: These systems when properly designed and 
installed maintain the temperature and humidity of indoor air to a level 
at which persons feel comfortable. Essentially it involves reducing the air 
temperature and humidity (in humid tropics) by the process of cooling 
and dehumidification.
• • Winter air conditioning: These systems are meant for the control of 
environmental conditions of indoor air so as to provide comfort in winter. 
Essentially it involves an increase in sensible heat and water content of 
air by the process of heating and humidification. The heating is done by 
furnaces or boilers fired with solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels.

192 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
• • Year-round air conditioning: This system manifests in the control of 
temperature and humidity in an enclosed space for all times of the year; 
this is despite a change in the atmospheric conditions. Essentially the sys­
tem comprises the heating and cooling equipment with associated com­
ponents and automatic controls.
4.17. HUMAN COMFORT
Thermal comfort is a condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with 
thermal environment. It is the state where the person is entirely unaware of 
his surroundings, no consideration whether the space is too hot or too cold. 
Dissatisfaction with the thermal environment may be caused by the body as 
a whole (being too hot or cold) or by the unwanted heating or cooling of a 
particular part of the body (local discomfort).
Human comfort refers to the control of temperature and humidity of air 
and its circulation so that the resulting environment becomes human friendly; 
the state of environment where persons feel comfortable. Comfort is, how­
ever, a subjective quality; it is dependent on the preferences of an individual 
and varies with the age, sex, state of health, and clothing of a person.
4.18. WINDOW AIR CONDITIONER
An air-conditioning system is an assembly of different components and parts 
used to produce a comfortable cooling/heating conditions of air within a 
closed space.
The closed chamber may be a living room, a conference/seminar hall, or 
an auditorium/theater. Further, the requirement may be industrial air con­
ditioning for a highly precision machine or for a research laboratory or for 
human comfort.
General human comfort conditions to be maintained fall in the range of
• • temperature: 22°C to 25°C,
• • relative humidity: 40% to 60%, and
• • air velocity: 5 m/min to 8 m/min.
Besides these parameters, the standards of air purity in terms of freedom 
from dirt, dust, foul smell, and odor, and noise is also to be ensured for the 
conditioned space.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 193
The basic elements of an air-conditioning system are
i. 
refrigerating plant,
ii. means for humidification or dehumidification of air,
iii. control system for automatic regulation of cooling or warming,
iv. fans for moving the air to and from the room,
v. filters for cleaning the air by removing dust and dirt particles, and 
vi. supply and return ducts.
FIGURE 4.25 Window air conditioner.
Figure 4.25 shows the constructional details of a window air conditioner 
used for human comfort during summer. This is a self-contained machine 
because it houses all the components including evaporator and condenser in 
a common enclosure. The unit is mounted either in a window or on the wall 
of the room to be air-conditioned. Such units are available in cooling capacity 
from % to 3% tons of refrigeration.
The main components of the machine comprise the following sub-assem­
blies:
(1) System assembly consisting of compressor, condenser, capillary, and 
evaporator units of the refrigerator system.
The hermetically sealed compressor is a compact unit containing both 
the compressor and motor mounted on a common shaft and encased in two- 
halves a dome-shaped casing which are joined together by circumferential 
welded joint. The lubrication of the compressor parts is done by the lubricat­
ing oil contained in the lower part of the dome.

194 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The window air conditioners of small size generally have the condenser 
of the refrigerator air cooled, but in large sizes, the condenser may be water 
cooled, in which case pipe connections are needed.
The air-cooled finned type condenser is made up of copper tubes in the 
form of a coil and provided with aluminum fins.
The evaporator is in the form of coils made of copper and provided with 
aluminum fins. The capillary tubing is located between the condenser and the 
evaporator unit.
(2) Cabinet and grill assembly equipped with filtering unit. The filtering 
unit consists of oil filter or water filter and carbon filter. Oil or water filter 
cleans the dust particles while the carbon filter removes smell of different 
gases.
(3) Switch board panel assembly consists of selector switch and the ther­
mostat control. The selector switch helps run the fan/compressor at low, 
medium, and high speeds, and the thermostat fixes the desired temperature.
(4) Outdoor and indoor fans which may be driven by the same motor or 
may be driven by separate motors.
The refrigerant unit employs Freon-22 or R-134 as the refrigerant.
The compressor motor unit, condenser, and outdoor fan are kept out­
door, that is, outside the room while the remaining components are placed 
indoor, that is, inside the room.
Specifications
A window air conditioner is normally specified by the following parameters:
• • Capacity: 1, 1.5, 2 ton, etc.
• 
Overall dimensions: length x width x height
• 
Power supply: AC, 220-240 volts, 50 hertz
• • Control: Site or remote
Working
When the power switch is put in the ON position, the motor-compressor unit 
starts running. The refrigerant vapors at low temperature and low pressure 
coming from the evaporator enter the compressor through suction line. The 
vapors are compressed and there is an increase both in temperature and pres­
sure. These vapors are led to condenser through discharge line. The vapors 
condense rejecting their heat to the atmospheric air. The condensed vapors 
next enter the capillary tube, are throttled to low pressure on account of fric­
tion, and their temperature gets reduced to minimum operating temperature 
of the refrigerant cycle. The low-pressure liquid refrigerant now enters the 
evaporator, absorbs the latent heat of vaporization from the room air, and that 

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning • 195
results in the cooling of this air. This cooled air is directed through a ducted 
passage in the front cover grill and that provides comfortable cooling condi­
tions in the air.
The refrigerant vapors leave the evaporator and enter the compressor 
during its suction stroke and that completes the working cycle.

CHAPTER 5
Fluid Mechanics
Fluid Mechanics is basically a study of the
i. physical behavior of fluids and fluid systems, and of the laws governing 
this behavior,
ii. action of forces on fluids and of the resulting flow pattern.
Fluid mechanics may be divided into three divisions:
1. Hydrostatics that studies the mechanics of fluids at absolute and relative 
rest; the fluid elements are free from shearing stresses.
2. Kinematics that deals with translation, rotation, and deformation of fluid 
elements without considering the force and energy causing such a motion.
3. Dynamics that prescribes the relations between velocities and accelera­
tions and the forces which are exerted by or upon the moving fluids.
After reading this chapter, the reader would be able to
i. 
make distinction between the three states of matter (solid, liquid, and 
gas).
ii. understand the concept of a fluid, real and ideal fluid.
iii. make a brief review about the development of the exciting and fascinating 
subject of fluid mechanics.
iv. appreciate the unlimited practical applications of fluid mechanics.

202 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
5.1. SOLIDS, LIQUIDS, AND GASES
Matter exists in two principal forms: solid and fluid. Fluid is further subdi­
vided into liquid and gas. Distinguishing features among these are as follows:
i. 
The solids, liquids, and gases exhibit different characteristics on account of 
their different molecular structure. Spacing and the latitude of the motion 
of molecules are large in a gas, small in a liquid, and extremely small in a 
solid. Accordingly, the inter-molecular bonds are very weak in a gas, weak 
in a liquid, and very strong in a solid. It is due to these aspects that solid is 
very compact and rigid in form, liquid accommodates itself to the shape of 
its container, and gas fills up the whole of the vessel containing it.
ii. For a given mass, the liquids have a definite volume irrespective of the 
size of the container. The variation of volume with temperature and pres­
sure is insignificant. Liquid occupies the vessel fully or partially depend­
ing on its mass, and it forms a free surface with the atmosphere. The gas, 
however, expands to fill any vessel in which it is contained and does not 
form any free surface. Accordingly, it may be stated: The solid has vol­
ume and shape; a liquid has volume but no shape; a gas has neither.
iii. For all practical purposes, the liquids like solids can be regarded as 
incompressible. This means that pressure and temperature changes have 
practically no effect on their volume. The gases are, however, readily com­
pressible fluids. They expand infinitely in the absence of pressure and 
contract easily under pressure. Nevertheless, density variation is small. 
For example in the flow of air in a ventilating system, the gas flow can also 
be treated as incompressible without involving any appreciable error.
When a gas can be readily condensed to a liquid, we call it a vapor such 
as steam and ammonia.
iv. The deformation due to normal and tangential forces for solids is such 
that within elastic limits, the deformation disappears and the solid body 
is restored to its original shape when the stress causing the deformation 
is removed. A fluid at rest can, however, sustain only normal stresses and 
deforms continuously when subjected to shear stress; no matter how small 
that shear stress may be. Even though the fluid comes to rest when the 
shear stress is removed, there is no tendency to restore the fluid body to 
its original shape or position.
Thus, fluid can offer no permanent resistance to shear force and possesses 
a characteristic ability to flow or change its shape. Flow means that the con-

Fluid Mechanics • 203
stituent fluid particles continuously change 
their positions relative to one another. This 
concept of fluid flow under the application 
of shear stress is illustrated in Figure 5.1. A 
fluid element occupying the initial position 
011 continues to move or deform to new 
position 022, 033, etc., when shear stress t 
is applied to it.
The tendency of continuous deforma­
tion of a fluid is called fluidity, and the act of continuous deformation is 
called flow.
The above discussion can be summed up as follows:

i. A given mass of liquid has a defi­
nite volume independent of the 
size or shape of the container; 
however, it changes its shape 
easily and acquires the shape of 
its container.
i. A given mass of gas has no fixed 
volume, and it expands continu­
ously to completely fill any con­
tainer in which it is placed.
ii. A free surface is formed if 
the volume of the container is 
greater than that of the liquid.
iii. No free surface is formed.
iv. Liquids can be regarded as 
incompressible for all practical 
purposes.
v. Gases are readily compressible.
vi. Pressure and temperature 
changes have practically no 
effect on the volume of a liquid.
vii. A gas expands infinitely in the 
absence of pressure and con­
tracts easily under pressure.
viii. Water, kerosene, petrol, etc. are 
liquids.
ix. Air, ammonia, carbon dioxide, 
etc. are gases.
5.2. IDEAL AND REAL FLUIDS
A fluid is said to be ideal if it is assumed to be both incompressible and invis­
cid (non-viscous). Further, an ideal fluid has no surface tension. For an invis­
cid fluid, viscosity is zero, and no frictional forces are set up even during fluid 
motion:

m = 0
r = constant; K = -dp 
dv / v
= да
s = 0
Ideal fluids are imaginary and do exist in nature. However, most com­
mon fluids such as air and water have a very low value of viscosity and can 
be treated as ideal fluids for all practical purposes without introducing any 
appreciable error. Since water is incompressible, it is moved near to an ideal 
fluid than air.
Real or practical fluids have viscosity (m), compressibility (K), and sur­
face tension (s). Whenever motion takes place, the tangential or shear forces 
always come into play due to viscosity and some frictional work is done.
5.3. SIGNIFICANCE OF FLUID MECHANICS
The subject of fluid mechanics encompasses a great many fascinating areas 
like
• • design of a wide range of hydraulic structures (dams, canals, weirs, etc.) 
and machinery (pumps, turbines, and fluid couplings)
• • design of a complex network of pumping and pipelines for transporting 
liquids; flow of water through pipes and its distribution to domestic ser­
vice lines
• • fluidic control devices both pneumatic and hydraulic
• • design and analysis of gas turbines, rocket engines, conventional, and 
supersonic aircraft
• • power generation from conventional methods such as hydroelectric, 
steam, and gas turbines, to newer ones involving magneto fluid dynamic
• • methods and devices for the measurement of various parameters, for 
example, the pressure and velocity of a fluid at rest or in motion.
• • study of men’s environment in the subjects like meteorology, oceanogra­
phy, and geology
• • human circulatory system, that is, flow of blood in veins and the vital role, 
it plays in a variety of engineering applications.

The numerous natural phenomena such as the rain cycle, weather pat­
terns, the rise of groundwater to the top of trees, winds, ocean waves, and 
currents in large water bodies are also governed by the principles of fluid 
mechanics.
Figure 5.2 briefly explains the significance of fluid mechanics and the vital 
role that it plays in a variety of engineering applications.

(v) Drag and Lift
The significance of fluid mechanics can be well judged by citing just one 
example of automobile drive where suspension is provided by pneumatic tires, 
road shocks are reduced by hydraulic shock absorbers, gasoline is pumped 
through tubes and later atomized, air resistance creates a drag on the vehicle 
as whole and the confidence that hydraulic brakes would operate when the 
vehicle is made to stop.
Undoubtedly, a study of the science of fluid mechanics is a must for an 
engineer so that he can understand the basic principles of fluid behavior and 
apply the same to flow situations encountered in engineering and physical 
problems.
5.4. FLUID PROPERTIES
Every fluid has certain characteristics by means of which its physical condition 
may be described. Such characteristics are called the properties of the fluid. 
Before an analyst of fluid flow problems can venture to formulate the physical 
principles governing the flow situation, he has to be thoroughly familiar with 

206 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
the physical properties of fluids. Toward that end, this section seeks to provide 
basic insight into the fluid properties and their behavior.
5.4.1. Specific weight, mass density, and specific gravity
a. Specific weight (w) of a fluid is its weight per unit volume.
W
w = ---
V
(5.1)
where W is the weight of the fluid having volume V. The weight of a
body is the force with which the body is attracted to the center of the
earth. It is the product of its mass and the local gravitational accelera­
tion, that is, W = mg. The value of g at sea level is 9.807 m/s2 approxi-
mately. Since weight is expressed in Newton, the unit of measurement of 
specific weight is N/m3. In terms of fundamental units, the dimensional 
formula of specific weight is
F
L3
M
For pure water under standard atmospheric pressure of 760 mm 
of mercury at mean sea level and a temperature of 4°C, the specific 
weight is 9810 N/m3. For sea water, the specific weight equals 10 000 - 
10 105 N/m3. The increased value of the specific weight of water is due 
to the presence of dissolved salts and suspended matter. The specific 
weight of petroleum and petroleum products varies from 6 350 to 8 350 
N/m3 and that of mercury at 0°C is 13 420 N/m3. Air has a specific weight 
of 11.9 N/m3 at 15°C temperature and at standard atmospheric pressure. 
The specific weight of fluid changes from one place to another depend­
ing upon changes in gravitational acceleration.
b. Density (r -pronounced rho) is a measure of the amount of fluid con­
tained in a given volume and is defined as the mass per unit volume:
m
r = V
(5.2)
where m is the mass of fluid having volume V. Fluid mass is a measure 
of the ability of a fluid particle to resist acceleration and is approximately 
independent of its location on the earth’s surface. The units of density 
correspond to those of mass and volume. The dimensional formula of
density in fundamental units is
or
FT2 
~й~
and the corresponding
M 
u
units are kg/m3 or N s2/m4.

Fluid Mechanics • 207
The density of a fluid diminishes with a rise of temperature except for 
water which has a maximum value at 4°C. The mass density of water at 
15.5°C is 1000 kg/m3, and for air at 20°C and at atmospheric pressure, 
the mass density is 1.24 kg/m3.
Relations 5.1 and 5.2 are valid only when the fluid medium fills the given 
volume completely without any blank space, that is, the fluid is a con­
tinuum. For a non-homogeneous fluid, these relations give average spe­
cific weight and density. To determine the absolute values of w and r at 
any point, the volume is regarded as tending to zero and the limit of the 
corresponding ratio is calculated:
m dW
w = Lt =-----
v > V dV
m
Г = Lt = 
v • V
dM 
dV
The weight W and the mass m of a fluid are related to each other by the 
expression W = mg. Dividing this expression throughout by volume V of 
the fluid, we obtain:
Wm
—=v g or w = r g 
(5.3’
Equation 5.3 reveals that the specific weight w changes with location 
depending upon gravitational pull.
c. 
Specific gravity (s) refers to the ratio of specific weight (or mass den­
sity) of a fluid to the specific weight (or mass density) of a standard fluid. 
For liquids, the standard fluid is water at 4°C, and for gases, the standard 
fluid is taken either air at 0°C or hydrogen at the same temperature. 
Specific gravity is dimensionless and has no units.
A statement that the specific gravity of mercury is 13.6 implies that its 
weight (or mass) is 13.6 times that of the same volume of water. In other 
words, mercury is 13.6 times heavier than water.
d. Specific volume (v) represents the volume per unit mass of fluid; spe­
cific volume is the inverse of the mass density:
v = V; v = 1 
mr
The concept of specific volume is found to be practically more useful in 
the study of flow of compressible fluids, that is, gases.

5.4.2. Viscosity
Viscosity is a property of the fluid by which it offers resistance to shear or 
angular deformation.
Experimental evidence indicates that when any fluid flows over a solid 
surface, the velocity is not uniform at any cross section; it is zero (no slip) at 
the solid surface and progressively approaches the free stream velocity in the 

Fluid Mechanics • 209
fluid layers far away from the solid surface. This aspect of the velocity pro­
file (a curve connecting the tips of velocity vectors) indicates the existence 
of some resistance to flow due to friction between a fluid layer and the solid 
surface, and between adjacent layers of fluid itself. Again the velocity gradi­
ent (the spatial rate of change of velocity du/dy) is large at the solid surface 
and gradually diminishes to zero with distance from the wall. Evidently, the 
resistance between the fluid and surface is greater when compared to that 
between the fluid layers themselves.
The resistance to flow because of internal friction is called viscous resis­
tance, and the property which enables the fluid to offer resistance to relative 
motion between adjacent layers is called the viscosity of fluid. Viscosity is 
thus a measure of resistance to relative translational motion of adjacent layers 
of fluid. This property is manifested by all the real fluids, and it distinguishes 
them from ideal or non-viscous fluids. Molasses, tar, and glycerine are exam­
ples of highly viscous liquids; the inter-molecular force of attraction between 
their molecules is very large, and consequently, they cannot be easily poured 
or stirred. Fluids like water, air, and petrol have a very small viscosity; they 
flow much more easily and rapidly and are called thin fluids.

FIGURE 5.3 Velocity profile and viscosity concept.
Newton’s Law of Viscosity
Consider two adjacent layers at an infinitesimal distance dy apart and moving 
with velocity u and (u + du), respectively. The upper layer moving with veloc­
ity (u + du) drags the lower layer along with it by exerting a force F. However, 
the lower layer tries to retard or restrict the motion of the upper layer by 
exerting a force equal and opposite to F. These two equal and opposite forces 
induce a shear or viscous resistance t (pronounced tau) given by F/A where 
A is the contact area between the two layers. Experimental measurements 
have shown that the shear stress is proportional to the spatial rate of velocity 
normal to the flow:
du du
T dym dy
(5.5)

210 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The term U^- is more usually called the velocity gradient at right angles
to the direction of velocity itself. The proportionality constant m (pronounced 
mew) in Equation 5.5 is a function of the fluid involved and is called the 
coefficient of viscosity, absolute viscosity, or dynamic viscosity. 
Equation 5.5 is first suggested by Newton and is referred to as Newton’s 
viscosity equation or Newton’s law of viscosity.
The following observations help appreciate the interaction between vis­
cosity and velocity distribution:
• • Maximum shear stresses occur where the velocity gradient is the largest, 
and the shear stresses disappear where the velocity gradient is zero.
• • Velocity gradient at the solid boundary has a finite value. The velocity 
profile cannot be asymptotic to the boundary because that would imply an 
infinite velocity gradient and, in turn, infinite shear stress.
• • Velocity gradient becomes less steep (du/dy becomes small) with distance 
from the boundary. Consequently, the maximum value of shear stress 
occurs at the boundary, and it progressively decreases with distance from 
the boundary.
Deformation of fluid elements can be prescribed in terms of the angle 
of shear strain dq . Figure 5.4 indicates a thin sheet of fluid element ABCD
placed between two plates’ distances dy 
apart. The length and the width of the 
plates are much larger than the thick­
ness dy so that the edge effects can be 
neglected. When force F is applied to the 
upper plate, it causes it to move at a small 
speed du relative to the bottom plate. 
Velocity gradient sets up shear stress t = 
F/A which makes the fluid element dis­

of velocity gradient:
(5.6)

Apparently, the shear stress in fluids is dependent on the rate of fluid
deformation . This characteristic serves to distinguish a solid from a fluid.
Wile the shear stress in a solid material is generally proportional to shear 
strain, the shear stress in a viscous fluid is proportional to the time rate of 
strain.
Dimensional Formula and Units of Viscosity
The units of viscosity can be worked out from Newton’s equation of viscosity; 
t = m du/dy. Solving for the viscosity m and inserting dimensions F, L, and T 
for force, length, and time:

dynamic viscosity will have the units:

T^N =

(10-2 ) mm
A poise turns out to be a relatively large unit; hence, the unit centipoise 
(cP) is generally used: 1 cP = 0.01 P. Typical values of viscosity for water and

212 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
air at 20°C and at standard atmospheric pressure are
m water = 1.0 cP = 10-3 N s/m2
m air = 0.0181 cP = 0.0181 x 10-3 N s/m2
that is, water is nearly 55 times as viscous as air.
Specific viscosity is the ratio of the viscosity of fluid to the viscosity of 
water at 20°C. Since water has a viscosity of 1 cP at 20°C, the viscosity of any 
fluid expressed in centipoise units would be a measure of the viscosity relative 
to water.
Kinematic Viscosity
The ratio between the dynamic viscosity and density is defined as kinematic 
viscosity of fluid and is denoted by n (pronounced new):

The kinematic viscosity does not involve force; its only dimensions are 
length and time as in kinematics of fluid flow. Typical units of n are m2/s or 
cm2/s, the latter being referred to as stoke (St) to perpetuate the name of the 
English physical Sir George Stokes. A centistoke (c St) is one-hundredth of 
a stoke: 1 c St = 0.01 St. Typical values of kinematics viscosity at 20°C and at 
standard atmospheric pressure are
n water = 1.0 c St = 1 x 10-6 m2/s
n air = 15.0 c St = 15 x 10-6 m2/s
that is, the kinematic viscosity of air is about 15 times greater than the cor­
responding value of water.

Although oil is very viscous, this is a modest shear stress, about 360 times 
less than atmospheric pressure.

Solution: For a Newtonian fluid, t = m^u. Since the space between the shaft

Cohesion and Adhesion
Liquids have characteristic properties of cohesion and adhesion cohesion 
refers to the force with which the neighboring or adjacent fluid molecules are 
attracted toward each other. Adhesion represents the adhering or clinging 
of the fluid molecules to the solid surface with which they come in contact. 
In brief, forces between like molecules are cohesive, and the forces between 
unlike molecules are adhesive. When a liquid, like mercury, is spilled on a 
smooth horizontal surface, it tends to gather into droplets because the cohe­
sive molecular forces are greater than the adhesive forces between the mer­
cury molecules and the material of the surface. Mercury tends to stay away 
from the surface and is said to be a not-wetting liquid. In case of water, adhe­
sive forces are greater than cohesive forces. Naturally, when water is poured 
on the same smooth horizontal surface, it would spread out and wet the hori­
zontal surface. The wetting and non-wetting of the surface are dictated by the 
angle of contact between the liquid and the surface material.
Refer to Figure 5.8, which illustrates the liquid-gas interface with a solid 
surface. Liquid would wet the surface when q < p/2 and the degree of wetting

increases as q decreases to zero. For a non-wetting liquid, q > p /2. The con­
tact angle is dependent on the nature and type of liquid, the solid surface, and 
its cleanliness. For pure water in contact with a clean glass surface, q is essen­
tially 0°. Even when the water is slightly contaminated, q becomes as high as 
25°. Mercury, a non-wetting liquid has q between 130 and 150°.
FIGURE 5.8 Wetting and non-wetting liquids.
Surface Tension
A liquid molecule lying well beneath the free surface of a liquid mass is sur­
rounded by other molecules all around it. Consequently, the molecule is acted 
upon by the molecular forces of attraction (cohesion) that are equal in all 
directions. These equal and opposite forces cancel out; there is no resultant 
force acting upon the molecule within the fluid mass, and this aspect keeps 
the liquid mass in equilibrium. Nevertheless, a liquid molecule at the free 
surface has no liquid molecules above it to counteract the forces due to mol­
ecules below it. Consequently, as depicted in the molecular arrangement of 
Figure 5.9, the molecules lying at the surface have a net attraction tending to 
pull them into the interior of the liquid mass.
A quantum of energy/work is, thus, extended to bring the molecule to the free 
liquid surface which then acts like an elastic or stretched membrane. Energy

expended per unit area of the surface is called surface tension, designated 
by sigma s . Surface tension occurs at the interface of a liquid and a gas or at 
the interface of two liquids and is essentially due to inter-molecular forces of 
cohesion.
It is primarily due to surface tension effects that
• • an isolated drop of liquid takes nearly a spherical shape;
• • birds can drink water from ponds;
• • water can be poured into a clean glass tumbler to a level above the lip of 
tumbler;
• • stretched water surface can support small objects like dust particles and a 
needle placed gently upon it; and
• • capillary rise and depression in thin-bored glass tubes.
Surface tension forces are generally negligible in comparison with the 
pressure and gravitational forces but become quite significant when there is a
free surface and the boundary dimensions are small, for example, in the small­
scale models of hydraulic engineering structures.
The dimensional formula for surface tension is
F
L
M
; it is usually
expressed in N/m. The value of surface tension depends upon (i) nature of 
the liquid, (ii) nature of the surrounding matter which may be a solid, liquid, 
or a gas, (iii) kinetic energy and hence the temperature of liquid molecule. 
Growth in temperature results in a reduction of the inter-molecular cohesive 
forces and, hence, in a reduction of the surface tension force. At a critical 
point where the liquid and vapor phases become indistinguishable, the sur­
face tension becomes zero. Surface tension values for liquids are generally 
quoted when in contact with air as the surrounding medium.
s = 0.073 N/m 
for airwater interface
s = 0.480 N/m 
for air-mercury interface
The surface tension values drop with a rise in temperature.
EXAMPLE 5.12
List some occurrences which can be attributed to the physics of sur­
face tension. Why the concept of surface tension is not applied to 
gases?

Fluid Mechanics • 221
Solution: The following occurrences can be attributed to the physics of sur­
face tension:
i. 
capillary rise or depression,
ii. break-up of liquid jets,
iii. formation of dew drops on grass early morning,
iv. dust particles collecting on water surface,
v. formation of large soap bubbles with gentle blowing,
vi. floating of a greased needle of steel on water surface. Certain insects (fly, 
mosquitoes) can creep freely on the water surface,
vii. spherical shape of a droplet of liquid. When a molten metal is poured into 
water from a suitable height, the falling stream of molten metal breaks up 
and the detached portions acquire spherical shape. This technique is used 
for preparing lead shots and glass marbles.
Small drops of mercury are always spherical, but larger ones are some­
what flattened. Shape of the drop is governed by the combined influence of 
the surface tension and the gravitational force due to weight. For a tiny drop, 
the gravitational force is negligible and surface tension makes the drop spher­
ical. However, in case of larger drops, force of gravity is appreciable and tries 
to flatten the drop so as to lower the position of the center of gravity. Eventu­
ally, the drop acquires an oval or elliptical shape.
Rain drops, tiny dew drops, and small water drops ejected from a burette 
are always spherical.
viii. On adding soap or detergent powder into water, its surface tension is low­
ered considerably. This soap-water solution can more easily seep into the 
pores of clothes and remove the dirt and grease, etc.
ix. Antiseptic creams are generally prepared in oil or greasy base of low sur­
face tension so that even small amount of cream spreads on the whole of 
cut (wound) and prevents oozing out of the blood.
For gases, the inter-molecular distance among gas molecules is very large, 
and consequently, there is no appreciable force of cohesion, and as such the 
characteristic property of surface tension is not exhibited/manifested by gases 
even though a gas is also a fluid.

Capillary or Meniscus Effect
When a small diameter glass tube, called the capillary tube, is dipped into 
a water container, water rises in the tube to a level that stands higher than 
the level of water in the container. Conversely, the surface of mercury is 
depressed down in the capillary tubing when it is dipped in mercury. The 
phenomenon of liquid rise or fall in a capillary tube is called the capillary or 
meniscus effect. Capillary is a surface tension effect that depends upon the 
relative inter-molecular attraction between different substances; it is due to 
both cohesion and adhesion.
Adhesion between glass and water molecules is greater than cohesion 
between water molecules. Consequently, the water molecules spread over
the glass surface and form a concave 
Opposite conditions hold good for 
mercury, that is, cohesion between 
mercury molecules is greater than 
adhesion of mercury to glass. Mer­
cury then displays a convex menis­
cus with the angle of contact greater 
than 90°.

angle of contact q , tube diameter d, 
and specific weight of liquid w, the

Fluid Mechanics • 223
Vertical component of surface tension force
= s cosq x circumference
= s cos q x p d = p d s cos q
When in equilibrium, the downward weight of the liquid column h is bal­
anced by the vertical component of the force of surface tension.
Hence, 
P^ d2 h w = p d s cosq
or 
h = 4scod q 
(5.8)
It is to be noticed that for 0 < q < 90°, h is positive (concave meniscus and 
capillary rise) and that for 90 < q < 180°, h is negative (convex meniscus and 
capillary depression).
Evidently, the capillary action is inversely proportional to the tube diam­
eter. For precise work, the small diameter tubes are to be avoided; recom­
mended minimum tube diameter for water and mercury is 6 mm. Further, 
since the presence of dirt affects the surface tension and, hence, the capillary 
rise or depression, the interior surface of the tube is to be kept clean.
EXAMPLE 5.13
Explain why in a capillary tube, the meniscus of water is concave 
upwards while the meniscus of mercury is convex upwards.

5.4.4. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids
The distinction between Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids can be read­
ily illustrated when the velocity gradient du/dy is plotted against the viscous 
shear stress t.
Fluids for which the viscosity is independent of velocity gradient are 
called Newtonian fluids. For these fluids, the plot between shear stress and 
velocity gradient is a straight line passing through the origin. Slope of the line 
is equal to the coefficient of viscosity, m = t /(du/dy). Fluids represented by 
curves (a) and (b) are Newtonian fluids; fluid represented by line (a) is more 
viscous than that represented by line (b). Fluids like air, water, kerosene, and 
thin lubricating oils are essentially Newtonian in the chapter under normal 
working conditions.
Fluids such as human blood, thick lubricating oils, and certain suspensions 
for which the viscosity coefficient depends upon velocity gradient are referred 
to as non-Newtonian fluids. The viscous behavior of a non-Newtonian fluid 
may be prescribed by the power-law equation t = k (du/dy)n where k is a 
consistency index and n is a flow behavior index. For a Newtonian fluid, the 
consistency index k becomes the dynamic viscosity coefficient m and the flow 
behavior index n assumes a unity value.

228 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 5.12 Variation of shear stress with velocity 
gradient (time rate of deformation).
Fluids for which the flow behav­
ior index n is less than unity are called 
pseudo-plastic. Viscosity coefficient 
is smaller at greater rates of veloc­
ity gradient, and the curve becomes 
flattered as the shear rate (i.e., veloc­
ity gradient) increases (curve c). 
Examples of pseudo-plastic fluids 
are the milk, blood, clay, and liquid 
cement. Fluids for which the index n 
is greater than unity are called dila­
tant. Viscosity coefficient is more at 
greater rates of viscosity and the flow 
curve steeps with increasing shear 
rate (curve d). Concentrated solution of sugar and aqueous suspension of rice 
starch are examples of dilatant fluids.
An ideal plastic substance indicates no deformation when stressed up 
to a certain point (yield stress) and beyond that, it behaves like a Newtonian 
fluid and, hence, is represented by line (e). For certain substances, there is 
finite deformation for a given load, that is, the rate of deformation is zero. 
These materials plot as ordinate (curve f) and are called elastic materials or 
ideal solids. Actual solids deform slightly when subjected to shear stress of 
larger magnitude and, hence, plot as a straight line almost vertical (g). A fluid 
for which shear stress is zero (even if there is velocity gradient) is the ideal 
fluid, and it plots as abscissa (h). Fluids that show an apparent increase in vis­
cosity with time are called thixotropic. Conversely, if the apparent viscosity 
decreases with time, the fluid is called rheopectic.
5.5. PRESSURE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH HEIGHT
5.5.1. Pressure
A fluid element or mass is essentially acted upon by two categories of forces: 
body forces and surface forces. Body forces on fluids element are caused by 
agencies such as gravitational, electric, or magnetic fields. The magnitude of 
these forces is proportional to the mass of the fluid. Surface forces repre­
sent the action of the surrounding fluid on the element under consideration 
through direct contact. These forces are due to surface stresses like pressure 
(normal force) and shear (tangential force). In fluids at rest, there is no rela­
tive motion between the layers of the fluid. The velocity gradient is zero, and 

Fluid Mechanics • 229
hence, there is no shear in the fluid. Consequently, there is no tangential com­
ponent of force, and hence for a stationary fluid, the force exerted is normal 
to the surface of the containing vessel. This normal surface force is called 
the pressure force. The mathematical definition of intensity of pressure (or 
simply pressure), in the absence of shearing stress, is
dF
p = dA
where dF represents the resultant force acting normal to an infinitesimal 
area dA. If the total force F acts uniformly over the entire area A, then p = 
F/A. Pressure has the dimensions of [FL-2] and is usually expressed in N/m2 
(pascal), bar or atmosphere.
1 bar = 105 N/m2 = 100 kPa
1 atm = 101.3 kPa
5.5.2. Pascal’s law
An important and unique property of hydrostatic pressure is reflected in 
Pascal’s law, which states that
Intensity of pressure at a point in a fluid at rest is same in all directions
Consider a small wedge-shaped element of 
stationary fluid and assume that the element 
has a unit depth perpendicular to the plane 
of the paper (Figure 5.13). The element is 
acted upon by the normal pressure forces 
and the vertical forces due to weight. Let px, 
py, and pq be the pressure intensities on the 
faces AB, BC, and AC, respectively. Then,
Force on face AB = px x area of face AB
FIGURE 5.13
= px (dyx 1) = px dy
Likewise, Force on face BC = py dx 
Force on face AC = pq ds
The weight of fluid element is
= (area of triangular element x depth) x specific weight
1— dx dy x 1 
1 w dx dy,
x w = 2

230 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
and it acts through the center of gravity. Since the fluid element is in equilib­
rium, the forces in the horizontal and vertical directions must balance.
Resolving the forces in the x-direction:
px dy = pq ds sinq
From Figure 5.13, dy = ds sinq
Px dy = pe dy; Px = pe
Resolving the forces in the y-direction,
Py dx = ~W w dx dy + Pe ds cos q
Let the size of the elemental system approach smaller and smaller dimen­
sions; then the gravitation force (weight) which diminishes as the product of 
two dimensions (dx and dy) can be neglected in comparison with the pressure 
forces for which the diminishing effect is proportional to be reduction in sin­
gle dimension (dx). Thus, in the limit,
Py dx = Pq ds cosq
From Figure 5.13, dx = ds cosq
. 
Py dx = Pq dx; Py = Pq
From Equations 5.2 and 5.3, we have
Px = Py = Pq 
(5.9)
This result is independent of the angle q and, therefore, it follows that pres­
sure acts equally in all directions in a stationary fluid. Pressure at a point has 
only one value regardless of the orientation of the area upon which it is deter­
mined. Independence of direction implies that pressure is a scalar quantity.
5.5.3. Hydrostatic law
Rate of increase of pressure in a vertical direction is equal to weight density (specific 
weight) of the fluid.
The fundamental equation relating pressure, density, and vertical distance 
can be established by considering the equilibrium of an imaginary cylindrical 
element in a body of fluid at rest. The cylindrical element is of cross-sectional 
area dA and height dy.

Fluid Mechanics • 231
The pressure forces acting on the fluid element are
i. 
Pressure force on bottom face AB = p dA acting in the upward direction.
ii. Pressure force on top face CD
p + —dy I dA acting in the downward direction.
iii. Weight of fluid element = specific weight 
x volume = w dA dy
iv. Pressure forces on surface AC and BD 
are equal and opposite and, hence, can­
cel out.
For the element to be in equilibrium, the 
sum of downward forces on the element 
must be equal to the upward forces. That is
p dA - I p +—dy I dA - w dA dy

Since we are considering the variation of pressure only in the y-direction, 
dp 
dp
the partial differential — can be replaced by exact differential —■
— = -w or dp = -w dy 
dy
(5.10)
This is the fundamental equation of fluid statics and indicates that a nega­
tive pressure gradient exists upward along any vertical. Thus, the pressure 
decreases in the upward direction and increases in the downward direction 
with magnitude equal to specific weight.
Letting height dy to be zero, then dp = 0, that is, the pressure intensity 
remains the same if there is no change in elevation. Thus, the pressure will 
be constant everywhere over the same level surface in a continuous body of 
static fluid. A surface layer where pressure is the same at all points is called an 
isobaric surface or equipotential surface. The equipotential surfaces are 
horizontal planes; the free surface (a surface separating the liquid from the 
atmosphere) being one of them.

Equation 5.10 can be integrated directly to determine the difference in 
pressure between any two points in the fluid mass
22
J dp = -J wdy 
(5.11)
11
Evaluation of this integral is possible only for a given dependence of spe­
cific weight w with elevation y.
5.5.4. Pressure variation for an incompressible fluid
For incompressible fluid, the specific weight is independent of pressure inten­
sity, and it remains fairly constant with height. Then for a homogeneous fluid 
of constant specific weight, Equation 5.11 becomes
P 2 - P1 = - w (У 2 - У1)
Rearrangement gives
— + y1 = — + y2 or — + y = constant 
ww 
w
Each term has dimensions of length (meter). The coordinate y is called 
the position or elevation head, the — term is called the pressure head, 
w
and the sum ^— + У^ is called the piezometric head. Evidently, at every 
point in a homogeneous fluid at rest, the piezometric head is constant.
Representing the difference in elevation between two points by h and 
measuring it from the free liquid surface where atmospheric pressure Pat pre­
vails, we have
p - pat = wh; p = pat + wh
Thus, the pressure P at any point in a static fluid is partly due to atmo­
spheric pressure pat at the free surface and partly due to the distance of that 
point beneath the free surface. If atmospheric pressure pat is regarded as zero 
of pressure scale, then
p = wh 
(5.12)
This pressure p at any point in a static fluid when expressed above atmo­
spheric pressure is called the positive or gage pressure. Equation 5.10 

Fluid Mechanics • 233
demonstrates that pressure at any point submerged below a free liquid sur­
face exposed to the atmosphere is equal to the product of the vertical distance 
below the surface and the specific weight of the liquid.
Apparently, the pressure intensity depends only upon the height of col­
umn and not at all upon the size of column. Accordingly, in vessels of different 
shapes and configurations, the same unit pressure would be exerted against 
the bottom of the container.
5.5.5. Atmospheric, absolute, and gage pressure
The following terms are generally associated with pressure and its 
measurement:
i. 
Atmospheric pressure (Pat): This is the pressure exerted by the enve­
lope of air surrounding the earth’s surface. Atmospheric pressure is usu­
ally determined by a mercury column barometer shown in Figure 5.15. A 
long, clean thick glass tube closed at one end is filled with pure mercury. 
The tube diameter is such that capillarity effects are minimal. The open 
end is stoppered and the tube is inserted into mercury container; the 
stoppered end kept well beneath the mercury surface. When the stopper 
is removed, mercury runs out of the tube into the container and eventu­
ally, mercury level in the tube settles at height h above mercury level in 
the container. The atmospheric pressure pat acts at the mercury surface in 
the container, and mercury vapor pressure Pvp exists at the top of mercury 
column in the tube. From hydrostatic equation,
Pat - P = wh 
2
Mercury has a low vapor pressure (=0.17 N/m 
at 20°C), and thus for all intents and purposes, it 
can be neglected in comparison with Pat which is 
about 105 N/m2 at mean sea level. Then
Pat = wh
Mercury is preferred as other liquids possess 
sufficient vapor pressure at room temperature 
and that creates an error in pressure indica­
tion. Atmospheric pressure varies with altitude 
because the air nearer the earth’s surface is com­
pressed by the air above. At sea level, value of 
atmospheric pressure is close to 1.01325 bar 
or 760 mm of Hg column or 10.33 m of water 
column.
FIGURE 5.15 Simple mercury 
barometer.

234 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
ii. Absolute pressure (Pabs): Pressure has been defined as the force per 
unit area due to the interaction of fluid particles among themselves. Zero 
pressure intensity will occur when molecular momentum is zero. Such a 
situation can occur only when there is a perfect vacuum, that is, a vanish­
ingly small population of gas molecules or of molecular velocity. Pressure 
intensity measured from this state of vacuum or zero pressure is called 
absolute pressure.
iii. Gage pressure (Pg) and vacuum (Pvac): Instruments and gages used 
to measure fluid pressure generally measure the difference between the
unknown pressure P and the existing atmos­
pheric pressure Pat as shown in Figure 5.16.
When the unknown pressure is more than 
atmospheric pressure, the pressure recorded 
by the instrument is called gage pressure. 
A pressure reading below the atmospheric
FIGURE 5.16 Gage pressure.
pressure is known as vacuum, rarefaction, 
or negative pressure. Actual absolute pres-
sure is then the algebraic sum of the gage indication and the atmospheric
pressure
Pabs = Pat + Pg

Some of the commonly used pressure units are
1 bar = 105 N/m2 = 100 kPa = 750.06 mm of Hg
1 micron = 1 m = 10-3 mm of Hg
1 torr = 1 mm of Hg

Quite often pressure is expressed in the unit atmosphere. This unit sim­
ply uses the standard atmospheric value of 101.3 kPa and is defined as one 
atmosphere. Two atmospheres would be then 202.6 kPa. Sometimes, we 
assume atmospheric pressure equivalent to a rounded figure of 100 kPa and 
call it a technical atmosphere.

EXAMPLE 5.29
State Pascal’s law and discuss its applications.
A hydraulic press has a ram 30 cm diameter and plunger 5 cm 
diameter. Neglecting all losses due to friction etc., calculate the force 
to be applied at the plunger to lift a load of 20 kN. If the plunger has 
a stroke of 30 cm and if it executes 100 strokes per minute, calculate 
the distance through which the load is raised per minute. Also, make 
calculations for the power expended in driving the plunger.
Solution: Pascal’s law states that “inten­
sity of pressure is transmitted equally in all 
directions through a mass of fluid at rest.”
This characteristic property of the fluid 
forms the working principle of hydraulic 
jack, hydraulic lift, and hydraulic crane.
Hydraulic press consists of two cylin­
ders which are interconnected at the bot­
tom through a pipeline and are filled with 
some liquid. The larger cylinder contains a 
ram of area A and a plunger of area a recip­
rocates inside the smaller cylinder. A force F applied to the plunger produces 
an intensity of pressure p1 which is transmitted in all directions through the 
liquid. If the plunger and the ram are at the same level and if their weights 
are neglected, then pressure intensity p2 acting on the ram must equal to p1.

The above expression indicates that by applying a small force F on the 
plunger, a larger load can be lifted by the ram.
Mechanical advantage of the system is equal to A / a, the ratio of the area 
of ram and plunger. By proper adjustment of plunger and ram areas, even a 
small force can be multiplied many times; the hydraulic press is often called a 
machine of multiplying forces.

5.6. EQUATIONS OF MOTION
5.6.1. Flow rate and continuity equation
Consider flow of an ideal fluid through a 
stream tube (Figure 5.20). Since no flow 
takes place across the streamlines, the fluid 
must enter and leave the tube only at the end 
sections. At the inlet section 1-1, the flow 
characteristics are tube cross-sectional area 
A, average fluid density r , and the mean flow 
velocity V. The corresponding parameters at 
the exit section 2-2 are (A + dA), (r + dr ), 
and (V + dV).
FIGURE 5.20 Steady flow through a 
stream tube.
The mass flow entering the stream tube at section 1-1 during time inter­
val dt is given by (AV r dt). During the same time interval, a quantity of mass 
flow (A + dA) (V + dV) (r + dr ) dt out flows from the exist section 2-2. The 
fluid mass that accumulates between the two sections is then given by
dm = AVr dt - (A + dA) (V + dV) (r + dr ) dt
Simplification yields
dm 
dt
= -(AV dr + V r dA + A r dV)
For steady flow m= = 0 and, therefore, 
dt
AV dr + VrdA + A r dV = 0
Dividing throughout by r AV, one obtains
dr dA dV
-*-
 +----+----- = 0
rAV
or
d(r AV) = 0

244 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
rAV = constant 
(5.14)
Evidently the mass of fluid per unit time passing through any section of a 
stream tube is constant.
For an incompressible fluid, the mass density r is constant and, therefore,
that is,
AV = constant
A1V1 = A2 V2
(5.15)
Equation 5.15 represents the continuity equation for the steady incom­
pressible flow through an elementary stream tube. The continuity equation 
states that in a varying duct, the average velocity may change along the direc­
tion of flow but the product (area x velocity) remains constant. Further, the 
mean velocities are inversely proportional to the cross-sectional areas of the
flow passage, that is, ^1 = A2-
V2A1
Continuity relation Q = A1 V1 = A2 V2 works with the restrictions: constant 
density, no friction, steady flow, parallel stream tubes at each sections 1 and 
2, and no branching of stream tubes.
The product AV is the quantity (volume measure) of fluid which passes 
a reference point per unit time and is called the flow rate or discharge. Mass 
flow rate is the quantity (mass measure) rAV of fluid which passes per unit 
time; the units are expressed in kg/s. Weight flow rate is the quantity (weight 
measure) w AV of fluid which passages the reference point per unit time; 
value is expressed in N/s.
For a two-dimensional flow, the stream tube can be considered to be a 
unit dimension in the z-direction. Then the area along the stream tube is 
numerically equal to the spacing t of the streamlines. Continuity equation for 
a stream tube in a two-dimensional, steady flow or incompressible fluid may 
then be prescribed as follows:
V1 t1 = V2t2 = constant
(5.16)
Apparently, the mean velocity is inversely proportional to the spacing of 
the streamlines.
EXAMPLE 5.30
From a flow net diagram, it was found that the distances between two 
consecutive streamlines at two successive sections are 1 cm and 0.6 cm, 
respectively. If the velocity at the first section is 1 m/s, find the velocity at 
the other section. Also, find the discharge between the two streamlines.

5.6.2. Euler’s equation along a streamline
Euler’s equation of motion is established by applying Newton’s second law of 
motion to a small element of fluid moving within a stream tube (Figure 5.22). 
The element has a mean cross-sectional area dA, length ds, and the cen­
troid of the downstream face lies at a level dy higher than the centroid of the 
upstream face. Motion of the element is influenced by
* Normal forces due to pressure: Let p and (p + dp) be the pressure 
intensities at the upstream and downstream face, respectively. Net pressure 
force acting on the element in the direction of motion is then given by
p dA - (p + dp) dA = -dp dA 
(5.17)
* Tangential force due to viscous shear: If the fluid element has a perim­
eter dP, then shear force on the element is
dFs = t dP ds

Fluid Mechanics • 247
where t is the frictional surface force per unit area acting on the walls of the 
stream tube. The sum of all the shearing forces is the measure of the energy 
lost due to friction.
* Body force such as gravity acting in the direction of gravitational field. 
If r is the density of the fluid mass, then the body force is equal to rg dA ds. 
Its component in the direction of motion is
= r g dA ds sin q
= r g dA dy
V sin q = dy 1 
ds J
The resultant force in the direction of motion must equal to the product 
of mass and acceleration in that direction. That is
- 
dp dA - rg dA dy - t dP ds = r dA ds as 
(5.18)

For ideal fluids, t = 0 and, therefore, Equation (5.15) reduces to
u du +—P + g dy = 0 
r
— d (u2) + —p + dy = 0
Euler’s Equations 5.19 and 5.20 have been set up by considering the flow 
with a stream tube and as such apply to the flow with a stream tube or along a 
streamline because as dA goes to zero, the stream tube becomes a streamline.

5.6.3. Bernoulli’s theorem: integration of Euler’s equation for 
one-dimensional flow
Bernoulli’s equation relates velocity, pressure, and elevation changes of a fluid 
in motion. The equation is obtained when Euler’s equation is integrated along 
the streamline for a constant density (incompressible) fluid. Integration of 
Euler’s equation,

d(V2) + j

Equation 5.21 is one of the most useful tools of fluid mechanics and is 
known as Bernoulli’s equation in honor of the Swiss mathematician Daniel 
Bernoulli (1700-82).

one streamline to another but remains constant along a streamline in steady,

Evidently, the Bernoulli’s equation may be restated as “the sum of the

potential energy (elevation head) of a ideal, incompressible fluid constant 
along a streamline.”
The different heads appearing in the Bernoulli equation (5.22) are shown

the energy line. For an ideal frictionless flow, the total energy line is hori- 
zontal, parallel to the potential datum line. However, if the fluid is not ideal 
and exhibits friction effects, the energy line would drop thereby indicating a 
gradual loss of total energy.
Bernoulli’s equation can also be recast as follows:
w ~+- + p + wy = constant 
2g
or

(5.23)
which is the customary from in which the Bernoulli’s equation is applied to
gas flow. Each term is in Nm , that is, energy per unit volume. Since elevation 
change is frequently very small, and the term wy may be dropped out.
The Bernoulli’s equation forms the basis for solving a wide variety of fluid
flow problems such as jets issuing from an orifice, jet trajectory, flow under a 
gate and over a weir, flow metering by obstruction meters, flow around sub­
merged objects, and flows associated with pumps and turbines, etc.

erties with respect to time.
• • flow is ideal, that is, it does not exhibit any frictional effects due to fluid 
viscosity.
• • flow is incompressible; no variation in fluid density.
• • flow is essentially one-dimensional, that is, along a streamline. How­
ever, Bernoulli’s equation can be applied across streamlines if the flow is 
irrotational.
• • flow is continuous and velocity is uniform over a section.

heat or work is either added to or subtracted from the fluid.
5.6.4. Bernoulli’s theorem: principle of energy conservation
Consider steady flow of incompressible liquid through a non-uniform pipe (a 
converging stream tube) lying entirely in the x-y plane. Flow can be assumed 
to be uniform and normal to the inlet and outlet area. The fluid mass has an 
area A1, average velocity V1, and pressure p1 at the entrance; the correspond­
ing values at exist are A2, V2, and p2. The mass of the fluid in the region abcd 
is shifted to net position a’b’c’d’ during an infinitely small internal of time.
FIGURE 5.24 Energy conservation during fluid flow.

252 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Since the area a’b’cd is common to both the regions abcd and a’b’c’d’, it 
will not experience any energy change. Evidently, then the energy changes of 
the fluid masses in the section abb’a’ and cc’d’d have to be considered.
i. 
Invoking the principle of mass conservation, the following continuity 
equation applies
Fluid mass within the region abb’a’ = fluid mass within the region cc’d’d
m = r A1 ds1 = rA2 ds2
ii. Work done during displacement of fluid mass from ab to a’b’
= force x displacement = p 1 A 1 ds 1
The displacement ds1 is so small that any variation in fluid properties can 
be neglected. Likewise, the work done at exist is equal to
= -p2 A2 ds2
This work done is in opposite direction, that is, force and displacements 
are in opposite directions; hence, negative sign
Net flow work (work done by pressure)

iii. The fluid flows downwards and, therefore,
Loss of potential energy = mg (y1 - y2)
iv. The fluid mass accelerates from velocity V1 to V2 and, therefore,
Gain of kinetic energy = m (V2 - V12)
From the principle of conservation of energy, 
loss of potential energy + work done by pressure = gain in kinetic energy
mg(У 1 - У2) + m (P 1 - P2) = m (V22 - V2 )

which is the Bernoulli equation.
Thus, “In a steady flow system of frictionless incompressible fluid, the 
sum of velocity, pressure and elevation heads remains constant at every sec­
tion.” This is, however, on the assumption that energy is neither added to nor 
taken away by some external agency.

All liquids are more or less viscous and their flow is accompanied by frictional 
forces or resistances, which hinder motion. Therefore, from section to sec­
tion, there must be a continual expenditure of energy by the liquid in over­
coming the resistance. Obviously, energy at the downstream is less than that
at the upstream section by an amount equivalent to frictional loss. Bernoulli’s
equation for real fluids may then the written as follows:

where hf is the frictional loss of energy of head along the streamline between

Expressing the theorem in words: In steady flow, with friction present, 
the total head (or total energy per unit weight) at any section is equal to that
at any subsequent section, plus the lost head (or lost energy per unit weight) 
occurring between the two sections.

CHAPTER 6
Hydraulic Machines
Power engineers are primarily concerned with the design, fabrication, instal­
lation, operation, and maintenance of fluid machines that function to affect 
an exchange of energy between a fluid medium and a mechanical system. In 
the fluid-mechanical system either the machine does work on the fluid or 
conversely, the fluid imparts work to the machine. The wide variety of fluid 
machines that have been built up to affect a transfer of energy to or from a 
fluid medium can be broadly classified into two main types; the dynamic or 
kinetic type; and the displacement or static type.
1. Dynamic or kinetic machine in which mechanical work is done on 
or by the fluid entirely as a result of dynamic or kinetic action between a fluid 
and a rotating system of blades. The energy transfer is accompanied both 
by pressure and momentum changes. Examples of dynamic machines, also 
called the turbomachines are:
• • water, steam, and gas turbines,
• • pumps, fans, blowers, and compressors,
• • propellers, windmills, and unshrouded fans, and
• • fluid coupling and torque converters.
In these bladed machines, an impervious boundary containing the fluid 
does not exist at any time. Further, the operation of these machines is both 
steady and continuous.
Turbomachines can be identified as power generating, power absorbing, 
and power transmitting machines. In a power generating turbomachine, the 
energy of the incoming fluid is transferred to the rotating element which in 

268 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
turn may drive another machine. These machines produce power by expand­
ing fluid to low pressure or head; there is a conversion from static pressure 
to kinetic energy. Examples of power generating machines are water, steam, 
and gas turbines. In a power-absorbing turbomachine, the rotating element 
imparts energy and thereby increases the pressure or head of the outgo­
ing fluid; there is a transformation from kinetic energy into static pressure. 
Pumps, ducted fans, blowers, and compressors are notable examples of power­
absorbing machines. In a power transmitting turbomachine, the energy of 
one rotating shaft is first transferred to the fluid which in turn transfers the 
energy to another shaft; this may result in a change of speed and torque. The 
best-known examples of power transmitting machines are fluid couplings and 
torque convertors. These machines are used for power transmission in auto­
mobiles and trucks, and industrial machines.
The path of fluid in the rotating element may be axial, radial, or in some 
cases a combination of both. Naturally, the turbomachines can be classified 
into axial flow, radial flow, and mixed flow machines.
2. Positive displacement or static machines wherein the static pres­
sure is developed by a displacement action rather than by a velocity or kinetic 
energy change. During certain stages of operation, the fluid is fully contained 
within solid boundaries and it cannot escape except through leakage. A posi­
tive displacement machine can be reciprocating (i.e., petrol, diesel, and steam 
engines; reciprocating pumps and compressors) or a rotary (gear and screw 
pumps, root blowers, and vane 199 compressors) device while a turbomachine 
is always a rotary machine. Further, in a positive displacement machine, an 
interaction between the moving part and the fluid involves a change in the vol­
ume and/or displacement of the fluid. When the fluid volume increases, there 
is a transfer of energy from the fluid to the mechanical system. Conversely, 
when the fluid volume diminishes, energy is transferred to the fluid system.
Compared to the positive displacement machine, a turbomachine unit 
has the advantages of few balancing problems due to the absence of recipro­
cating and rubbing parts, exceptionally low consumption of lubricating oil, no 
conversion loss of power from rectilinear motion into rotary motion, and high 
reliability.
6.1. HYDRAULIC TURBINES
Hydraulic turbines are required to transform fluid energy into usable mechan­
ical energy as efficiently as possible. Further, depending on the site, the avail­
able fluid energy may vary in its quantum of potential and kinetic energy.

Hydraulic Machines • 269
Accordingly, a suitable type of turbine needs to be selected to perform the 
required job.
Depending upon the basic operating principle, hydraulic turbines are 
categorized into impulse and reaction turbines depending on whether the 
pressure head available is fully or partially converted into kinetic energy in 
the nozzle.
FIGURE 6.1 Principle of an impulse 
turbine.
•• Impulse turbine wherein the available 
hydraulic energy is first converted into 
kinetic energy by means of an efficient 
nozzle. The high-velocity jet issuing from 
the nozzle then strikes a series of suitably 
shaped buckets fixed around the rim of a 
wheel (Figure 6.1). The buckets change 
the direction of jet without changing 
its pressure. The resulting change in 
momentum sets buckets and wheels 
into rotary motion and thus mechanical 
energy is made available at the turbine shaft. The fluid jet leaves the run­
ner with reduced energy. An impulse turbine operates under atmospheric 
pressure: there is no change of static pressure across the turbine runner 
and the unit is often referred to as a free-jet turbine. Important impulse 
turbines are Pelton wheel, Turgo-impulse wheel, Girad turbine, Banki tur­
bine, Jonval turbine, etc.; Pelton wheel is predominantly used at present.
•• Reaction turbine wherein a part of the total available hydraulic energy 
is transformed into kinetic energy before the water is taken to the tur­
bine runner. A substantial part remains in the form of pressure energy. 
Subsequently, both the velocity and pressure change simultaneously as 
water glides along with the turbine runner. The flow from inlet to out­
let of the turbine is under pressure and, 
therefore, blades of a reaction turbine are 
closed passages sealed from atmospheric 
conditions.
Figure 6.2 illustrates the working prin­
ciple of a reaction turbine in which water 
from the reservoir is taken to the hollow 
disc through a hollow shaft. The disc has 
four radial openings, through tubes that are 
shaped as nozzles. When the water escapes 
4 through these tubes its pressure energy
FIGURE 6.2 Principle of a reaction 
turbine.

270 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
decreases and there is an increase in kinetic energy relative to the rotating 
disc. The resulting reaction force sets the disc in rotation. The disc and shaft 
rotate in a direction opposite to the direction of the water jet.
Important reaction turbines are: Fourneyron, Thomson, Francis, Kaplan, 
and Propellor turbines; Francis and Kaplan turbines are widely used at present.
The following table lists salient points of difference between the impulse 
and reaction turbines with regard to their operation and application.
TABLE 6.1 I mpulse versus Reaction Turbines.
Impulse Turbine
Reaction Turbine
• All the available energy of the fluid is 
converted into kinetic energy by an 
efficient nozzle that forms a free jet.
Only a portion of the fluid energy is 
transformed into kinetic energy before 
the fluid enters the turbine runner.
• The jet is unconfined and at 
atmospheric pressure throughout 
the action of water on the runner 
and during its subsequent flow to 
the tail race.
Water enters the runner with an excess 
pressure, and then both the velocity 
and pressure change as water passes 
through the runner.
• Blades are only in action when they 
are in front of the nozzle.
Blades are in action all the time.
• Water may be allowed to enter 
a part or whole of the wheel 
circumference.
Water is admitted over the 
circumference of the wheel.
• The wheel does not run full and air 
has free access to the buckets.
Water completely fills the vane passages 
throughout the operation of the 
turbine.
• Casing has no hydraulic function to 
perform; it only serves to prevent 
splashing and to guide the water to 
the tail race.
Pressure at the inlet to the turbine is 
much higher than the pressure at the 
outlet; the unit has to be sealed from 
atmospheric conditions and, therefore, 
the casing is absolutely essential.
• Unit is installed above the tail race.
Unit is kept entirely submerged in 
water below the tail race.
• Flow regulation is possible without 
loss.
Flow regulation is always accompanied 
by loss.
• When water glides over the moving 
blades, its relative velocity either 
remains constant or reduces slightly 
due to friction.
Since there is a continuous drop in 
pressure during flow through the blade 
passages, the relative velocity does 
increase.

In addition to the concept of impulse and reaction, hydraulic turbines 
may be further classified into various kinds according to:
i. Direction of water flow through runner: Classification of turbines based 
on consideration of the direction of flow is given below:
Tangential flow 
(Pelton wheel) 
______ у
I
Outward radial flow 
(Foumeyron turbine)
Turbine
t
Axial or parallel flow 
(Kaplan turbine)
I
Inward radial flow 
(Old Francis turbine)
I
Mixed: radial and axial 
(Modern Francis turbine)
Flow path in different types of runners has been illustrated in Figure 6.3.
• 
Pelton wheel is the tangential flow turbine; here the centerline of a jet 
is tangential to the path of rotation of the runner.
FIGURE 6.3 Flow path in different types of rotors.
• 
Propellor and Kaplan turbines are axial flow turbines; here water 
enters and leaves the runner along a direction parallel to the axis of 
the shaft.
• 
Radial flow turbines wherein the fluid passes through the runner in 
a plane practically perpendicular to the axis of rotation; water flows 
radially through the turbine. Further, the flow of water may be radi­
ally inward or radially outwards. In a radially inward flow, turbine 
water enters at the outer periphery, glides over the moving blades, 
and then flows radially inwards toward the center of the runner. The 
old Francis turbine and the Thomson turbine are the inward flow 
turbines. In a radially outward flow turbine water enters at the inner 

272 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
periphery, glides over the blades, and then moves radially outward/ 
toward the outer periphery of the runner. Fourneyron turbine is an 
example of an outward radial flow turbine.
• Mixed flow turbines where water enters the runner at the outer 
periphery in the radial direction and leaves it at the center in the 
direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the runner. The modern 
Francis turbine is a mixed flow machine.
ii. 
Available head and discharge:
• 
High head turbines operate under high head (above 250 m) and 
require relatively small rates of flow. Pelton wheel is a high head 
turbine.
• 
Medium head turbines operate under medium heads (60-250 m) and 
require medium flow rates. Modern Francis turbine belongs to this 
category.
• 
Low head turbines operate under heads up to 30 m and require very 
large volumetric rates of flow. Units of axial flow turbine (Propeller 
and Kaplan) are examples of a low head turbine.
iii. 
Specific speed:
Refers to the speed of a geometrically similar turbine (i.e., a turbine iden­
tical in shape, blade angles, gate openings, etc.) which would develop unit 
power when working under a unit head. The turbine specific speed is 
prescribed by the relation Ns = N pPHH5/4 where P is the power in kW, H 
is the net available head in m and N is the speed in rpm.
Specific speed is a characteristic index that serves to identify the types of 
hydraulic turbine.
* For Pelton wheel: Ns = 9-17 for a slow runner 
= 17-25 for a normal runner
= 25-30 for a fast runner = 40 for a double jet
* Francis turbine: Ns = 50-100 for a slow runner
= 100-150 for a normal run 
= 150-250 for a fast runner
* Kaplan turbine 
Ns = 250-850

Hydraulic Machines • 273
iv. Disposition of shaft: Impulse turbines have usually a horizontal shaft and 
vertical runner arrangement. Reaction turbines may be either of vertical 
or horizontal shaft type.
6.2. PELTON TURBINE
The oldest form of water turbine is the water wheel. The natural head (dif­
ference in water level) of a stream is utilized to drive it. In its conventional 
form, the water wheel is made of wood and is provided with buckets or vanes 
around the periphery. The water thrusts against these, causing the wheel to 
rotate. The latter drives the millstones and sometimes other machinery. In the 
case of an overshot wheel the water pours onto the buckets from above. If the 
water thrusts against the vanes on the underside of a water wheel, it is called 
an undershot wheel. The principle of the old water wheel is embodied in the 
modern Pelton wheel.

(b) Breast wheel
FIGURE 6.4 Water wheels.
(c) Undershot wheel
A Pelton wheel is a free-jet impulse turbine named after the American 
engineer Lesser Pelton (1829-1908) who contributed much to its develop­
ment. It is simple, robust and the only hydraulic turbine which operates effi­
ciently and is invariably used for heads in excess of 450 m. Smooth running 
and good performance are other common features of this unit.
Component Parts: Construction and Operation
i. 
Penstock: It is a large-sized conduit that conveys water from the high-level 
reservoir to the turbine. Depending upon low head or high head instal­
lations, a penstock may be made of wood, concrete, or steel. Further, 
the penstock may be of any length depending upon the distance between 
the reservoir and powerhouse. For the regulation of water flow from the

reservoir to the turbine, the penstock is provided with control valves. 
Again screens called trash racks are provided at the inlet of the penstock 
to prevent the debris from entering into it.
ii. Spear and nozzle: At its down­
stream end, the penstock is 
fitted with an efficient noz­
zle that converts the whole of 
hydraulic energy into a high­
speed jet. To regulate the 
water flow through the noz­
zle and to obtain a good jet 
of water at all loads, a spear 
or needle is so arranged that 
it can move forward or back­
ward thereby decreasing or 
increasing the annular area 
of the nozzle flow passage. 
The movement of the spear is 
controlled either manually by 
a hand wheel (in case of very 
small units) or automatically 
by a governing mechanism 
(in case of almost all the big­
ger units).
iii. Runner with buckets: The turbine rotor, called the runner, is a circular 
disk carrying a number (seldom less than 15) of cup-shaped buckets which 
are arranged equidistantly around the periphery of the disk. The runner 
is generally mounted on a horizontal shaft supported in small thrust bear­
ings, and the buckets are either cast integrally with the disk or fastened 
separately. The bolt fastening facilitates the easy replacement of buckets 
when necessary. For low heads, the buckets are made of cast iron, but 
for higher heads, they are made of bronze, cast steel, or stainless steel. 
Further, the inner surface of the buckets is polished to reduce frictional 
resistance to the water jet.
Each bucket has a ridge or splitter which distributes the striking jet equally 
into two halves of the hemispherical bucket. Again there is a cut (notch) in 
the outer rim of each bucket; this notch is provided to make the jet face 
the bucket only when it has come into proper position with respect to the 

Hydraulic Machines • 275
jet. This position occurs when the face of the bucket and axis of the jet is 
approximately 90° to each other. Maximum driving force will be exerted 
on the disk when the jet gets deflected through 180°, that is, when the 
bucket is exactly hemispherical. However, in practice, the angular deflec­
tion of a jet in the bucket is limited to about 165-170°. This is to ensure 
that the water jet while leaving one bucket does not strike the back of the 
succeeding bucket. This avoids the splashing of water and unnecessary 
interference which could impair the overall efficiency of the turbine.
Since the two hemispherical cups are joined together and water is directed 
at the junction, the side thrusts produced by the fluid in each half balance 
each other. The arrangement has thus the advantage that bearings sup­
porting the wheel shaft are not subjected to any axial or end thrust.
iv. Casing: Outflow from the runner buckets is in the form of a strong splash 
that scatters in all directions. To prevent this and to guide the water to the 
tail race, a casing is provided all around the runner. The casing also acts 
as a safeguard against accidents. Evidently, the casing has no hydraulic 
function to perform. A baffle is arranged in the casing to prevent the dis­
charged water from being carried along the runner direction.
v. Governing mechanism: Speed to the turbine runner is required to be 
maintained constant so that the electric generator coupled directly to the 
turbine shaft runs at a constant speed under varying load conditions. The 
task is accomplished by a governing mechanism that automatically regu­
lates the quantity of water flowing through the runner in accordance with 
any variations in the load.
6.3. FRANCIS TURBINE
The Francis turbine is an inward flow reaction turbine that was designed and 
developed by the American engineer James B. Francis (1815-1892). In the 
earlier stages of its development, the Francis turbine had a purely radial flow 
runner; the flow passing through the runner had a velocity component only 
in a plane normal to the axis of the runner. The modern Francis turbine is, 
however, a mixed flow unit in which the water enters the runner radially at 
its outer periphery and leaves axially at its center. This arrangement provides 
a large discharge area with the prescribed diameter of the runner. Francis 
turbine with its full peripheral admission enjoys a great superiority and is well 
adopted in the hydroelectric power plants where a large quantity of water is 
available at low and medium heads.

276 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Component Parts: Construction and Operation
The main features of the Francis tur­
bine are illustrated schematically in 
Figure 6.7.
i. 
Penstock: It is a large-sized con­
duit that conveys water from the 
upstream of the dam to the turbine 
runner. Because of the large volume 
of water flow, size of the penstock 
required for a Francis turbine is 
larger than that of a Pelton wheel. 
The penstock is invariably made of 
steel and is embedded inside the 
dam. Trashrack is provided at inlet 
of the penstock in order to obstruct 
the entry of debris and other for­
eign matter.
ii. Scroll casing: Penstock is connected 
to and feeds water directly into an 
annular channel surrounding the 
turbine runner. The channel is spi­
ral in its layout and is known as the 
spiral or scroll casing. Casing consti-
FIGURE 6.7 Elements of a Francis turbine.
tutes a closed passage whose cross-section area gradually decreases along 
the flow direction; area is maximum at inlet and nearly zero at exit. The 
decrease in area is in proportion to the decreasing volume of water to be 
handled and that ensures that the velocity of water is constant along its 
path. After entry into the casing, the water starts distributing itself into 
the guide blades which are arranged inside the casing. At the turn of 360°, 
the entire water has passed to the guide blades.
The casing is made of cast steel, plate steel, and concrete depending upon 
the pressure/head to which the casing is subjected. Further, in the case of 
bigger units, stay vanes are usually provided inside the casing to support it 
and to direct the water from the casing to the guide vanes.
iii. Guide vanes or wicket gates: A series of airfoil-shaped vanes, called the 
guide vanes or wicket gates, are arranged inside the casing to form a 
number of flow passages between the casing and the runner blades. The 

Hydraulic Machines • 277
guide vanes direct the water onto the runner at an angle appropriate to 
the design. They direct the flow just as the nozzle of the Pelton wheel. 
The configuration and arrangement of the guide vanes are such that the 
energy of water is not consumed by eddies and other undesirable flow 
phenomena causing energy losses.
Guide vanes are fixed in position, that is, they do not rotate with the rotat­
ing runner. However, they can swing around their own axes and that helps 
to bring about a change in the flow area between two consecutive runner 
blades. This provides a degree of adaptability to the quantity of water to 
be admitted to the runner in the wake of load variations. Motion is given 
to the guide vanes either by means of a handwheel or automatically by a 
governor.
iv. Guide wheel and governing mechanism: The governing mechanism 
changes the position of guide blades to affect a variation in the water flow 
rate in the wake of changing load conditions on the turbine. The system 
consists of a centrifugal governing mechanism, linkages, servomotor with 
its oil pressure governor, and the guide wheel. When the load changes, 
the governing mechanism rotates all the guide blades about their axes 
through the same angle so that the water flow rate to the runner and its 
direction essentially remain the same at all the passages between any two 
consecutive guide vanes. The penstock pipe feeding the turbine is often 
fitted with a relief valve, also known as the pressure regulator. When the 
guide vanes are suddenly closed, the relief valve opens and diverts the 
water directly to tail race. The simultaneous operation of guide vanes and 
relief valves is termed as double regulation.
v. Runner and runner blades: Runner of the Francis turbine is a rotor that 
has passages formed between crown and shroud in one direction and two 
consecutive blades on the other. These passages take water in at the outer 
periphery in the radially inward direction and discharge it in a direction 
parallel to the axis of the rotor. The driving force on the runner is both 
due to impulse (deviation in the direction of flow) and reaction (change in 
pressure and velocity energy) effects.
The number of runner blades usually varies between 16 and 24. With small 
units, the runner is made of cast iron while the bigger units have runner 
essentially made of stainless steel or a non-ferrous metal like bronze when 
the water is chemically impure and there is danger of corrosion. The run­
ner is keyed to the shaft which may be of vertical or horizontal disposition; 
mostly vertical.

278 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
vi. Draft tube: After passing through the runner, the water is discharged to 
the tail race through a gradually expanding tube called the draft tube. The 
free end of the draft tube is submerged deep into the tail race. Evidently 
then the entire water passage from the head race to the tail race is totally 
closed; does not communicate with the surrounding atmospheric pressure. 
Because of its gradually increasing cross-section, the discharge velocity 
from the turbine runner is not all wasted; it is partly converted into a use­
ful pressure head and the water discharges at a relatively low velocity to 
the tail water.
6.4. PROPELLER AND KAPLAN TURBINES
The propeller turbine is a reaction turbine that is particularly suited for low 
head (up to 30 m) and high flow rate installations, that is, at barrages in rivers. 
The unit is like the propeller of a ship operating in reverse. The ship propel­
ler rotates, thrusts the water away behind it, and thus causes the ship to move 
forward. In a propeller turbine, the water flows through the propeller and sets 
it in motion. Water enters the turbine laterally, gets deflected by the guide 
vanes, and then flows through the propeller. For this reason, these machines 
are referred to as axial flow units.
Component Parts: Construction and Operation
The main features of a pro­
peller turbine are illustrated 
schematically in Figures 6.8 
and 6.9. Except the run­
ner, all other parts such as 
the scroll casing, stay ring, 
guide mechanism (arrange­
ment of guide vanes), and 
the draft tube of a propeller 
turbine are similar to those of 
a Francis turbine. Between 
the guide vanes and the run­
ner, the water turns through 
a right angle and subse­
quently, flows parallel to the

shaft. This purely axial flow arrangement provides the largest flow area; even 
at larger flow rates, the flow velocities are not too large.
The runner is in the form of a boss which is nothing but the extension of 
bottom end of the shaft into a bigger diameter. On the periphery of the boss 
are mounted equidistantly 3 to 6 vanes made of stainless steel. Thus com­
pared to the Francis turbine 
which has 16-24 blades, a 
propeller turbine with only 
3-6 vanes will have less con­
tact surface with water and 
as such a low value of fric­
tional resistance. Further­
more, the runner blades are 
directly attached to the hub 
and this feature eliminates 
the frictional losses which 
are caused by the bend pro­
vided in a Francis turbine.
The fixed-blade propeller turbine is installed only at the sites where the 
head and load are constant. At part load, the power efficiency curve of such a 
unit is very much peaked, that is, poor performance is indicated. This prob­
lem of poor efficiency at part load was successfully solved by the Australian 
engineer Victor Kaplan who introduced the concept of adjusting the runner 
vanes in the face of changing load conditions on the turbine. Hence the name 
variable pitch propeller turbine is often given to the Kaplan turbine. With 
proper adjustment of blades during its running, the Kaplan turbine is capable 
of giving a high efficiency for a wide range of load conditions. The pitch of the 
runner blades is automatically adjusted by the governor through the action of 
a servomotor.
The Kaplan turbine has double regulation which comprises the move­
ment of guide vanes and rotation of runners blades (Figure 6.10). The 
mechanism employs two servomotors; one controls the guide vanes and the 
second operates on the runner vanes. The governing is done by the governors 
(servomotors) from the inside of the hollow shaft of the turbine runner and 
the movement of the piston is employed to twist the blades through suitable 
linkages. The double regulation ensures a balanced and most satisfactory rela­
tionship between the relative positions of the guide and working vanes. Both 
the servomotors are synchronized; they are actuated simultaneously and high 
efficiency is maintained at all loads.

280 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Kaplan turbines are capable of taking 
overloads from 15 to 20% and give a very high 
efficiency at all the gate openings while work­
ing at full load and part load conditions (speed 
and the head remain constant). The velocity 
plots do change with the flow rate variations 
caused by changes in load on the turbine. 
However, the blade angles also get simultane­
ously adjusted and as such under all working 
conditions, water enters and flows through the 
runner blades without shock. As such the eddy 
losses, which are inevitable in the Francis and 
the fixed-blade propeller turbine, get entirely 
eliminated in the Kaplan turbine.
Quite often the electric generator coupled 
to the Kaplan turbine is enclosed and works 
inside a straight passage having the shape of 
FIGURE 6.10 Kaplan runner blade 
mechanism.
a bulb. The water tight bulb is submerged directly into the stream of water, 
and the bends at inlet to casing, draft tube, etc., which are responsible for the 
loss of head are dispensed with. The unit then needs less installation space
with a consequent reduction in excavation and other civil engineering works. 
These turbines are referred to as bulb or tubular turbines and the power sta­
tions using such turbines are called under water power stations. The tubular 
turbines have become very popular and are invariable employed for very low 
head (as low as 4 m) installations such as those in tidal power plants and in 
rivers at very modest falls.
The salient points of difference between the Francis and Kaplan turbines 
are enumerated below:

5. Large resistance needs to be

Less resistance as there are fewer vanes

rates.
7. Specific speed ranges from 50-250.
Specific duty ranges from 250-850.
8. Ordinary governor is sufficient for 
speed control as the servomotor is 
of larger size.
Heavy-duty governor is essential for 
speed control due to smaller sizes of the 
servomotors.
6.5. HYDRAULIC PUMPS
Man’s economic and technical progress through the ages might be measured 
in terms of development from the primitive pumping devices operated either 
by man or animal to the positive displacement and dynamic pumps he fash­
ions today. Typical progress in the development of pumps is found in munici­
pal water works, power plants, agriculture, transport, and many other utility 
services and industries.
A pump has been defined differently by different investigators; the differ­
ent definitions are, however, all are similar and nearly equivalent:
• • a device that raises or transfers liquids at the expense of power input
• • a machine designed to elevate, deliver, and move various liquids
• • a unit that transfers the mechanical energy of a motor or an engine into 
potential and kinetic energy of a liquid.
By their action, the pumps require that energy must be expended and as 
such, they belong to the category of power-absorbing machines. Further, since 
the temperature gradients are minimal, pumps are non-thermal machines. 
The expended energy enables the pump to overcome the hydraulic resistance 
and make the fluid rise through a geodetic elevation.

6.6. PUMP CLASSIFICATION AND SELECTION CRITERION
According to design and principal of operation, pumps may be placed in one 
of the two general categories:
a. dynamic pumps, and
b. positive displacement pumps.
These two categories are further subdivided as depicted below:

Essential data for the selection of a pump include:
• • pressure and capacity of the liquid being handled,
• • properties such as viscosity, temperature, corrosiveness, grittiness, etc., of 
the flowing liquid,
• • initial and maintenance cost,
• • pump duty, that is, whether the pump is to transfer the liquid or to meter 
it also,
• • availability of space, size, and position of locating the pump,
• • speed of rotation and power required,
• • standardization with respect to the types and makes of pumps already 
available at the site, and
• • scale-up problems.
Each pump has its own operating characteristics that limit its practical appli­
cations. For example in a centrifugal pump, a small change in pressure differ­
ential causes a relatively large change inflow. A positive displacement pump, 
on the other hand, delivers an almost constant quantity regardless of pres­
sure fluctuations. Thus if finite pressure differences are known to exist in a 

Hydraulic Machines • 283
particular application, then the demand of a constant supply of liquid would 
be met by installing a positive displacement type of pump. Likewise, a cen­
trifugal pump would be the obvious choice if in a particular pump application 
it is necessary to maintain a constant head/pressure on the mains despite fluc­
tuations in capacity/discharge.
Centrifugal pumps have high output and high efficiency. Their simple 
design and convenient operation have resulted in their widespread use. In 
general, it is always advantageous to go for a centrifugal pump unless:
i. 
viscosity of the liquid is greater than 1000 centipoise,
ii. low capacity and high heads are in demand, and
iii. percentage volume of dissolved gases is greater than 5%.
Reciprocating pumps are best in the field of high pressure and moderate 
capacity pumping. Rotary positive displacement pumps are employed in oil 
conduits, hydraulic devices, etc.
6.7. PUMP APPLICATIONS
A pump adds to the pressure, existing on a liquid, and increment sufficient to 
do the required service. This service may be increasing the pressure, impart­
ing kinetic energy, lifting and circulating, exhausting or extracting liquids, etc., 
Some notable applications of pump installation are in the fields of:
• • agriculture and irrigation works,
• • municipal water works and drainage system (sewage disposal),
• • fire protection systems,
• • condensing water, condensate, boiler feed, sump drain, and such other 
services in a steam power plant,
• • hydraulic control systems,
• • circulation of water in compressor and diesel engine cooling systems,
• • oil pumping, and
• • transfer of raw materials, materials in manufacture, and the finished prod­

6.8. CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS
Centrifugal pumps belong to the category of 
dynamic pressure pumps wherein the pumping of 
liquids or generation of head is affected by rotary 
motion of one or more rotating wheels called the 
impellers.
A centrifugal pump consists essentially of the inlet­
following elements:
i. 
Rotating element consisting of shaft and a vaned 
rotor called impeller. The vanes are curved, 
cylindrical, or have more complex surfaces. The 
unit has a finite number of vanes; the number 
is selected to assure motion of the liquid in the 
desired direction and varies with diameter of 
the impeller eye and the radial depth of the
vanes. The number usually ranges between six and twelve.
The impeller is mounted on a shaft coupled to the driving unit which may 
be an internal combustion engine or an electric motor. By virtue of force 
interaction between the vanes and the liquid, the mechanical energy of 
the driver is transformed into the energy of flow.
ii.
Stationary element consisting of casing, stuffing box, and bearings. The 
casing is an airtight chamber surrounding the pump impeller; it collects
iii.
liquid from the impeller and 
leads it away under high pres­
sure to the delivery side. Pack­
ings, labyrinths, and glands are 
needed to reduce the shaft leak­
age, both internal and external.
Suction pipe, strainer, and foot 
valve: Suction pipe connects 
the center (eye) of the impel­
ler to the sump from which the 
liquid is to be lifted. The pipe is 
laid airtight so that there is no 
possibility of the formation of 
air pockets.
Suction pipe is provided with a 
strainer at its lower end so as to
Discharge level

pump.

prevent the entry of solid particles, debris, etc., into the pump. These 
foreign materials, if carried into the pump would adversely affect its per­
formance. The foot valve is a one-way valve located above the strainer into 
the suction pipe. It serves to fill the pump with liquid before it is started, 
and prevents backflow when the pump is stopped.
iv. Delivery pipe and delivery valve: Delivery pipe leads the liquid from the 
pump outlet to the point of use. A regulating valve provided just near the 
pump outlet serves to control the flow of liquid into the delivery pipe.
Working
The pump is initially primed wherein the suction pipe, casing, and portion 
of the delivery pipe up to the delivery valve are completely filled with the 
liquid to be pumped. Rapid motion imparted to impeller then builds up the 
centrifugal force which throws the liquid toward the impeller periphery. This 
causes a pressure gradient in the suction pipe, that is, a partial vacuum exists 
at the impeller eye while the liquid in the sump is at atmospheric pressure. 
Consequently, liquid from the sump is sucked in toward the impeller eye. 
When the liquid passes through the impeller, it receives energy and that 
results in the growth of both pressure and velocity. The casing collects the 
liquid from the impeller and guides it to the delivery pipe. Since the cas­
ing increases in a cross-sectional area toward the delivery, kinetic head rep­
resented by the high discharge velocity is partially transferred into pressure 
head before the liquid leaves the pump. The process is continuous as long as 
motion is given to the impeller and there is a supply of liquid to draw upon.
6.9. CLASSIFICATION OF CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS
Based on their utility, design, and constructional features, centrifugal pumps 
can be classified with respect to the following characteristics:
Shape and Type of Casing
Liquid leaving the impeller has an appreciable high velocity. This necessitates 
some arrangement to bring about the desired conversion of kinetic energy 
to pressure energy before the liquid reaches the discharge end of the pump. 
This conversion has to be accomplished with minimum energy loss. The task 
is accomplished by providing a casing around the pump impeller.
In general, there are three casing arrangements, and the pump is named 
after the casing arrangement it uses.

286 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
••
••
Volute or spiral casing wherein the 
cross-section of the moving stream 
gradually increases from the tongue 
toward the discharge pipe. This 
increase in the area results in a grad­
ual decrease in velocity with a corre­
sponding increase in pressure. Most 
of the single-stage pumps are built 
with volute casings. However, the 
volute casing has greater eddy losses 
and hence lower overall efficiency.
Delivery
FIGURE 6.13 Pump with volute casing.
Vortex or whirlpool chamber 
wherein an annular space is pro­
vided between the volute and impel­
ler. This arrangement arrests the 
formation of eddies and gives an improved performance.
•• Volute casing with guide blades wherein fixed guide blades is provided 
around the impeller periphery. When the liquid flows through diverging 
passages formed between the guide vanes, conversion of dynamic into 
static head occurs. Liquid leaving the vanes is then collected in a volute 
chamber where further diffusion occurs before the liquid is discharged
to the delivery pipe. Pumps fitted with guide vanes are called “diffuser
pumps” or “turbine pumps” as 
distinct from “volute pumps.” Dif­
fuser type casing is adopted when 
the pump impellers are to be con­
nected in series, that is, in multi­
stage deep well pumps. Machines 
with diffuser blades have rather a 
maximum efficiency but are less 
satisfactory when a wide range of 
operating conditions is required. 
This may be attributed to the losses 
caused by the change of blade inci­
dence angle with flow rate.
With respect to the mechanical

FIGURE 6.15 Pump with guide vanes.
v. segmented casing pumps: pumps
equipped with a casing made up of segments. These may either be of 
the band type for multi-purpose pumps or of the bowl type for turbine
pumps.
Closed, Semi-closed, and Open Impellers
In the closed or shrouded impellers the vanes are covered with shrouds (side­
plates) on both sides. The back shroud is mounted into the shaft and the front 
shroud is coupled to the former by the vanes. The arrangement provides a 
smooth passage for the liquid; wear is reduced to a minimum. This ensures 
full capacity operation with high efficiency for a prolonged running period. 
This type is, however, meant to pump only clear liquids of low viscosity; liq­
uids may be ordinary water, hot water, and acids.
FIGURE 6.16 Closed, semi-closed, and open impellers.

288 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The semi-open impeller has a plate (shroud) only on the backside. The 
design is adapted to industrial pump problems which require a rugged pump 
to handle liquids containing fibrous material such as paper pulp, sugar molas­
ses, sewage water, etc.
In an open impeller, no shroud or plate is provided on either side. That is 
the vanes are open on both sides. Such pumps are used where the pump has 
a very rough duty to perform, that is, to handle abrasive liquids such as a mix­
ture of water sand, pebbles, and clay. The presence of these foreign materials 
is liable to clog between the impeller and stationary side plates of a closed or 
semi-closed type impeller.
Axial, Radial, and Mixed Flow Impellers
In the axial flow pumps, the head is developed by the propelling or lift action 
of the vanes on the liquid which enters the impeller axially and discharges axi­
ally. The action is similar to the generation of lift by the wings of an airplane. 
Axial flow pumps have a very large discharge and are best suited for irrigation
purposes.
In radial flow impel­
lers, the head is developed 
by the action of centrifugal 
force upon the liquid which 
enters the impeller axially at 
the center and flows radi­
ally to the periphery. Flow 
through a mixed flow impel­
ler is a combination of axial
FIGURE 6.17 Axial, radial, and mixed flow impellers.
and radial flows. The head 
is developed partly by the
action of centrifugal force and partly by axial propulsion as a result of which 
the fluid entering the impeller axially at the center is discharged in an angular 
direction. Mixed flow impellers resemble the shape of a screw and are some­
times called screw impellers. Centrifugal pumps with mixed flow impellers
are best suited for irrigation purposes where large quantities of water at low 
head are required.
Shape and Number of Vanes
Impeller of a centrifugal pump has a finite number of vanes; usually from 6 
to 12. These vanes may be curved, cylindrical, or of more complex surfaces.

Hydraulic Machines • 289
Working Head and Number of Stages
Based upon the range of working head, centrifugal pumps are called low head 
(up to 15 m), medium head (15-40 m), and high head (over 40 m) pumps. 
Maximum head built up by a single a stage centrifugal pump seldom exceeds 
40 m of water. Greater heads are achieved by having pumps with several 
stages; the number of stages is indicated by the number of impellers in series. 
In a multistage pump, the liquid discharging from one impeller and its volute 
enters the eye of the succeeding impeller, and so forth, thereby increasing the 
head. The total head added by a multistage pump equals the sum of the heads 
built up by each impeller.
Single Suction and Double 
Suction
With respect to how the liquid 
enters the impeller, the pumps 
may be with one-sided suc­
tion (admission) or with two­
sided suction. The one-side
(a) Single suction
(b) Double suction
FIGURE 6.18 Single suction and double suction pumps.
feed arrangement has the liq­
uid entering through one side 
of the impeller. In a two-sided
feed, the liquid enters on both sides thereby increasing the discharge of the
pump. Further, this arrangement eliminates the axial thrust. A single-sided 
impeller would, however, experience an axial thrust toward the inlet end.
Specific Speed
Specific speed is a term used for classifying pumps on the basis of their per­
formance and dimensional proportions regardless of their actual size or the 
speed at which they operate. It is defined as the speed of an imaginary pump 
geometrically similar in every respect to the actual pump and capable of deliv­
ering unit quantity against a unit head. Mathematically, the specific speed Ns 
for a pump is given by,
nJQ
Ns 
H3/4
where N = pump speed in rev/min; Q = discharge in m3/s of a single suction 
impeller, and H = head per stage in meters.
Representative values of specific speed for different type of pump impel­
lers are tabulated below:

Shaft Position
Most of the centrifugal pumps are of horizontal shaft disposition. However, to 
affect the economy in space, the pumps may be designed with vertical shafts 
as is done for deep well and mine pumps.
Classification of pumps can also be made on the basis of:
• • type of the liquid to be handled such as water, solids in suspension, and 
viscous liquids,
• • application such as irrigation, boiler feed, and condensate circulation, and
• • power used such as I.C. engine or electric motor.
6.10. HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS
There exist numerous hydraulic systems and devices in which force and 
energy are transmitted through an incompressible fluid, generally an oil. 
Notable examples are hydraulic accumulators, intensifiers, lifts and cranes, 
fluid coupling, and torque converters.
Figure 6.19 illustrates one typical layout of a hydraulically operated 
machinery (press, crane, or lift) incorporating a pump (power source to pro­
vide hydraulic energy), an accumulator, and an intensifier unit. The opera­
tion of these devices is essentially based on the principles of hydrostatics and 
hydro-kinetics.

6.10.1.Hydraulic Accumulator
Function: To store the energy of fluid under pressure and make this energy 
readily available as a quick secondary source of power to fluid machines such 
as presses, lifts, and cranes. This function is analogous to that of an electric 
storage battery, and the flywheel of a reciprocating engine. An accumulator 
also functions as a pressure regulator; it serves to damp out pressure surges 
and shocks in the hydraulic system.
Construction and operation: The accumulator is a simple mechanical 
device that essentially consists of a long vertical ram mounted within a honed 
or ground cylinder. The ram is weighted at the top to create pressure in the 
cylinder chamber (Figure 6.20).
During idle periods of the driven 
machine (crane or lift), high-pressure 
liquid discharged from the continuously 
working pump is admitted into the hol­
low space of the cylinder. This creates 
an upward force on the lower end of the 
ram. Eventually, the ram is lifted upwards 
when the upward force overcomes the 
dead weight on the ram and its packing 
friction. The flow of more liquid contin­
ues and fluid energy under pressure is 
stored in the cylinder. This high-pressure 
liquid stored in the accumulator is later 
discharged to the driven machine during 
its working stroke, that is, when it has to 
do the maximum amount of work.
FIGURE 6.20 S imple hydraulic accumulator.
Energy stored in the accumulator refers to the work done in lifting the ram.
Work done = force x distance moved
= (p x a) h
= p x (ah)
= p x cylinder volume 
(6.1)
where p is the pressure of the liquid supplied by the pump, a is the cross­
sectional area of ram, and h is the stroke, that is, height or fall of ram.
Evidently, the capacity of a simple accumulator is the product of the 
intensity of pressure and volume of the accumulator.
In its differential arrangement (Figure 6.21), the accumulator consists of 
a fixed vertical plunger inside which is provided a central liquid passage of 

292 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
small diameter. This fixed cylindrical plunger is encased within a brass bush 
or sleeve which itself is enclosed within an inverted cylinder. The inverted 
cylinder is loaded but it can slide up and down under the influence of liquid 
pressure. Passages for liquid to enter and leave the unit are provided in the 
fixed ram, and connected to the inlet and outlet pipes.
Liquid under pressure from the pump main is taken to the bottom of 
the fixed ram, it passes through the central cavity and exerts an upward force 
on the annular roof of the weighted

cylinder. Load on the cylinder is 
sufficient to overcome the pressure 
exerted by the liquid. During the 
downward movement of the loaded 
cylinder, liquid collected in the accu­
mulator is pushed toward the driven 
machine when it is executing its work­
ing stroke.

b. An accumulator has a ram of 20 cm diameter and a lift of 7 m. If 
the liquid is supplied at a pressure of 5 MPa, find the load on the 
ram and the capacity of the accumulator in kW-h.
Solution: (i) Load on ram,
W = p X a
= (5 x 106) X p (0.2)2 = 0.157 х 106 N
ii) Capacity of the accumulator
= W x h
= (0.157 x 106) x 7 = 1.099 х 106 Nm
Further, 1 kW-h

EXAMPLE 6.2
The sliding ram of a hydraulic accumulator is 25 cm in diameter and 
it carries a load of 10 W kN. When the loaded ram moves down with 
a uniform velocity, the intensity of pressure inside the accumulator is 
7.5 MPa. Assuming that the packing friction of the ram is equivalent 
to 4% of the load on the ram; work out the intensity of pressure when 
the load on the ram ascends up with a uniform velocity.
Solution: Load required to overcome friction
= 0.04 x 10 W = 0.4 W kN
i. When the ram descends, the frictional force acts vertically upwards and 
hence the net load on the ram
= weight of load the ram - load due to friction 
= (10 W - 0.4 W) = 9.6 W kN

Now, pressure intensity =

294 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Solution gives: W = 38.3 kN
: Load on the sliding ram
= 10 W = 10 X 38.3 = 383 kN
ii. When the ram ascends up with a uniform velocity, the net load on the ram
= weight of load + load due to packing friction 
= 383 + 0.04 X 383 = 39.32 kN
Intensity of pressure =

= 81.19 X 105 N/m2.
6.10.2. Hydraulic Intensifier
Function: To increase the 
liquid pressure above that avail­
able from a pump. The task is 
accomplished by utilizing the 
energy of a large quantity of 
liquid at low pressure. The 
intensifier is located between 
the pump and the machine 
(press, crane, and lift) that 
needs high-pressure liquid for 
its operation.
Construction and oper­
ation: The intensifier consists 
of a fixed ram surrounded by 
a sliding cylinder which itself 
is encased within a bigger and 
fixed cylinder. The fixed ram 
and the fixed cylinder are pro­
vided with valves V1 and V3

to admit low-pressure liquid from the main supply. Further, valve V4 is for 
exhaust and valve V2 allows high-pressure liquid to be supplied to the driven 
machine.
Initially, when the sliding cylinder lies at the bottom of its stroke, the fixed 
cylinder is full of low-pressure liquid. Keeping the valves V2 and V3 closed, the 
valve of V1 is opened. That permits low-pressure liquid to enter the inside of 
the sliding cylinder. Meanwhile, exhaust valve V4 is opened; the low-pressure 

Hydraulic Machines • 295
liquid from the fixed cylinder is discharged to exhaust and the sliding ram 
moves upwards. Eventually, the sliding ram reaches its topmost position and 
the inside of the sliding ram gets completely filled up with the low-pressure 
liquid. At this stage valves V2 and V3 are opened and the valves V1 and V4 
are closed. Low-pressure liquid entering the fixed cylinder through valve V3 
exerts a downward force on the ram. The sliding ram moves down, the pres­
sure of liquid beneath it is raised and the high-pressure liquid is supplied to 
the driven machine.
Let A1 and A2 be the respective cross-sectional areas of the sliding cylin­
der and the fixed ram, p1 be the pressure intensity of low-pressure liquid in 
the fixed cylinder and p2 be the intensity of high-pressure liquid in the ram. 
Further, if k is the percentage of friction loss at each of the packings of ram, 
then for the equilibrium of sliding cylinder at any position:

if the friction effects are neglected.
The single-acting intensifier as described above supplies high-pressure 
liquid to be machine only during the downward motion of the sliding ram. For 
a continuous supply of high-pressure liquid, use is made of the double-acting 
intensifiers. Further depending upon the fluid used, an intensifier may be 
classified as:
•• Hydro-pneumatic intensifier in which air is supplied to the fixed cylinder 
instead of low-pressure liquid.
•• Steam intensifier wherein steam under pressure is supplied to the fixed 
cylinder instead of low-pressure liquid.

Describe the construction, working, and utility of a hydraulic 
intensifier.

A hydraulic intensifier has a ram diameter of 12 cm and a sliding 
cylinder diameter of 60 cm. Calculate the pressure at the outlet of the 
intensifier if the supply pressure is 1 MPa. It may be assumed that loss 
due to friction at each of the packings of the intensifier is 5% of the 
total force on each of the packings.

EXAMPLE 6.4
Mention some of the systems which have intensifiers as one of their 
basic elements.
A hydraulic intensifier gets the low-pressure liquid at a pressure 
of 50 X 105 N/m2 and delivers it to a machine at a pressure of 200 X 105 
N/m2. If the intensifier has a capacity of 0.025 m3 and stroke 1.25 m, 
calculate the diameters of the fixed ram and the sliding cylinder to be 
used for this intensifier.
Solution: Capacity of the intensifier
= area of fixed ram x stroke length
: 
0.025 = A2 x 1.25; A2 = 0.02 m2
Thus, diameter of the fixed ram

6.10.3. Hydraulic Lift
Function: To lift or bring down load and passengers from one floor to another 
in a multi-storeyed building.
Construction and operation: A hydraulic lift consists essentially of a 
ram and cylinder arrangement with a cage or platform fitted to the top end 
of the ram. When fluid under pressure is forced into the cylinder, the ram 
gets a push vertically upwards. The platform carries loads or passengers and 
moves between the guides. At the requisite height, it can be made to stay in 
FIGURE 6.23 D irect-acting hydraulic lift.
FIGURE 6.24 Suspended hydraulic lift.

298 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
level with each floor so that the goods/passengers can be transferred. In these 
direct-acting lifts, the stroke of the ram is equal to the lift of the cage.
In the suspended hydraulic lifts (Figure 6.24) motion of the platform or 
cage is obtained by the cylinder and ram arrangement of a hydraulic jigger. 
Modern lifts are generally of suspended type and these have lifting speeds of 
150 m/min or even more.
Hydraulic lifts have, in general, been superseded by electric lifts. Hydrau­
lic lifts then find applications as stand by units to electric lifts or in places 
where there is danger due to fire or explosion.

CHAPTER 7
Measurement and
Instrumentation
Engineering is a creative and learning profession. If engineers are to create, 
they must experiment and open the new frontiers of information. 
Experimentation is vital for progress in any field where information is lacking. 
There would thus be a need to measure the physical entities such as displace­
ment, velocity, pressure, force, elapsed time, etc., in the operating devices and 
machines. Experimentation is considered to be the cornerstone in the field 
of engineering design, research, and development projects. In industry too, 
there is a need for the measurement and control of the physical conditions 
required for mass production and high-quality products. Similarly in com­
mercial organizations, the measurement of water and electricity supplied to a 
consumer is a must.
The instruments for measurement, control, and transmission find such 
a wide and varied use that they have become an essential feature of techno­
logical operations and modern day-to-day life. It would be difficult to think 
of any man-made article whose manufacture did not at some stage involve 
measurement. There are instruments to control the flight of man-made sat­
ellites, probe the mysteries of outer space, and transmit related information. 
Nearer at home, we use instruments to control the temperature of our homes 
and to preserve food in refrigerators and cold storage. Our automobiles are 
equipped with instruments to measure speed, condition of the battery, and 
the amount of gasoline in the fuel tank. The national security devices and the 
sophisticated war weapons to utilize instruments for their functioning. The 
division of engineering science that deals with measuring techniques, devices, 
and their associated problems is called instrumentation.

This chapter on measurement and instrumentation is intended to describe 
the measuring instruments and devices with regard to their construction and 
operation.
7.1. MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENT
The word measurement is used to tell us the length, the weight, the tempera­
ture, the color, or the change in one of these physical entities of a material. 
Measurement is the result of an opinion formed by one more observer about 
the relative size or intensity of some physical quantity. The opinion is formed 
by the observer after comparing the object with a quantity of the same kind 
chosen as a unit, called standard. The result of measurement is expressed 
by a number representing the ratio of the unknown quantity to the adopted 
standard. This number gives the value of the measured quantity. For example, 
10 cm length of an object implies that the object is ten times as large as 1 cm; 
the unit employed in expressing length.
The measurement standard is the physical embodiment of the unit of 
measurement. This places a sizable responsibility on the observer, he may 
be an engineer or a technician, to be certain that the standard used by him 
is accurately known and commonly accepted. Further, the procedure and 
apparatus employed for obtaining the comparison must be provable, that 
is, accuracy can be reproduced anywhere in the world. This is essential so 
that measurements obtained by him can be accepted with confidence. For 
consistency and quantitative comparison of physical parameters, certain stan­
dards of mass, length, time, temperature, and electrical quantities have been 
established. These standards are internationally accepted and well-preserved 
under controlled environmental conditions.
The physical quantity or the characteristic condition which is the object of 
measurement in an instrumentation system is variously termed as measurand, 
measurement variable, instrumentation variable, and process variable. The 
measurand may be a fundamental quantity (length, mass, and time), a derived 
quantity (speed, velocity, acceleration, power, etc.), or a quality (pressure, 
temperature, etc.).
The human senses cannot provide exact quantitative information about 
the knowledge of events occurring in our environments. The stringent require­
ments of precise and accurate measurements in the technological fields have, 
therefore, led to the development of mechanical aids called instruments. 
Scientific instruments allow humans to observe and measure aspects of the

Measurement and Instrumentation • 303
physical universe beyond the range 
and precision of the unaided human 
senses. Instruments are the essen­
tial extensions of human sensing and 
perception without which scientific 
exploration of nature would be impos­
sible. The instrument would sense a 
physical parameter (pressure, tem­
perature, velocity, etc.), process and

translate it into a format and range 
which can be interpreted by the observer.
The man-made instruments are not only accurate and sensitive in their 
response but also retain their characteristics for extended periods of time. 
Instruments may be quite simple, such as a liquid-in-glass thermometer, or
extremely complex such as the device to sense the physiological reactions of a 
man during space flight.
7.2. MEASUREMENT METHODS
7.2.1. Direct and Indirect Measurements
Measurement is a process of comparison of the physical quantity with a 
reference standard. Depending upon the requirement and based upon the 
standards employed, there are two basic methods of measurement:
1. Direct Measurement: The value of the physical parameter (mea- 
surand) is determined by comparing it directly with reference standards. 
The physical quantities like mass, length, and time are measured by direct 
comparison.
Direct measurements are not to be preferred because they involve human 
factors, are less accurate and are also less sensitive. Further, the direct meth­
ods may not always be possible, feasible, and practicable.
2. Indirect Measurement: The value of the physical parameter (mea- 
surand) is more generally determined by indirect comparison with secondary 
standards through calibration. The measurand is converted into an analogous 
signal which is subsequently processed and fed to the end device that pres­
ents the result of measurement. The indirect technique saves the primary or 
secondary standards from frequent and direct handling.
The accuracy of each approach is apparently traceable to the primary 
standard via secondary standard and the calibration.

7.2.2. Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Measurements
The complexity of an instrument system depends upon the measurement 
being made and upon the accuracy level to which the measurement is needed. 
Based upon the complexity of the measurement system, the measurements 
are generally grouped into three categories, namely, the primary, secondary 
and tertiary measurements.
In the primary mode, the sought value of a physical parameter is deter­
mined by comparing it directly with reference standards. The requisite infor­
mation is obtainable through senses of sight and touch. Examples are:
i. 
matching of two lengths while determining the length of an object with 
a ruler,
ii. matching of two colors while judging the temperature of red hot steel, 
iii. estimating the temperature difference between the contents of containers 
by inserting fingers,
iv. use of beam balance to measure (actually compare) masses, and
v. measurement of time by counting the number of strokes of a clock.
The primary measurements provide subjective information only. That is, 
the observer can indicate only that the contents of one container are hotter 
than the contents of the other; one rod is longer than the other rod; one object 
contains more or less mass than the other.
In many technological activities, it is often difficult to make direct obser­
vation of the quantity being measured. The human senses are not equipped 
to make direct comparison of all the quantities with equal facility. Further, 
frequent measurements are extremely time-consuming and tedious if taken 
directly. Accordingly, we use indirect methods in which the measurand is con­
verted into some directly measurable effect. The indirect methods make a 
comparison with a standard through the use of a calibrated system, that is, an 
empirical relation is established between the measurement actually made and 
the results that are desired. For example, an indirect method may consist of 
developing an electrical voltage proportional to a physical variable to be mea­
sured, measuring that voltage, and then converting the measured voltage back 
to the corresponding value of the original measurand. Electrical methods are 
preferred in the indirect methods due to their high speed of operation and 
simpler processing of the measured variable.
The indirect measurements involving one translation are called 
secondary measurements and those involving two conversions are called 
tertiary measurements.

Presssure, P
FIGURE 7.2 Secondary measurements: (a) bellows convert pressure into 
displacement, (b) springs convert force into displacement.
The conversion of pressure into displacement by means of bellows 
(Figure 7.2a) and the conversion of force into displacement by means of 
springs (Figure 7.2b) are simple examples of secondary measurements. When 
a pressure above that of the atmosphere is applied to the open end of the 
bellows, these expand and the resulting displacement is a measure of applied 
pressure. The displacement varies linearly with applied pressure provided 
that the range of pressure variation is small. Likewise, a spring stretches when 
a vertical force is applied at its free end. Different forces give rise to different 
displacements and so a measure of the spring deflection gives a unique indi­
cation of the force.
The pressure measurement by manometers and the temperature mea­
surement by mercury-in-glass thermometers are other examples of secondary 
measurements. In these instruments, the primary signal (pressure or tem­
perature) is first transmitted to a transducer where its effect is translated into 
a length change. The secondary signal of length change is subsequently con­
verted into equivalent pressure or temperature change through a calibration 
process.
The measurement of static pressure by a bourdon tube pressure gauge 
(Figure 7.3) is a typical example of tertiary measurement.
When the static pressure (input signal) is applied to the bourdon tube, 
its free end deflects. The deflection which constitutes the secondary signal 
is very small and needs to be made larger for display and reading. The task 
is accomplished by an arrangement of lever, quadrant, gearing, and pointer.

FIGURE 7.4 Tertiary measurement: measurement of angular speed by an electric tachometer.
The amplified displacement constitutes the tertiary signal, and it is indicated 
by the movement of the pointer against a graduated scale.
The measurement of the speed of a rotating shaft by means of an electric 
tachometer (Figure 7.4) is another typical example of tertiary measurement. 
The angular speed of the rotating shaft is first translated into an electrical volt­
age which is transmitted by a pair of wires to a voltmeter. In the voltmeter, the 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 307
voltage moves a pointer on a scale, that is, voltage is translated into a length 
change. The tertiary signal of length change is a measure of the speed of the 
shaft and is transmitted to the observer.
The unit of a measuring system where the translation of a measurand 
takes place is called the transducer or translator. The term is usually applied 
to an electromechanical device that converts the measurand into a propor­
tional electrical output. The electrical, mechanical, or any other variable 
which is actually measured is called the measured signal. In the example 
of a tertiary measurement cited above, the measured signal is the voltage 
which is an electrical analog of the speed of rotation of the unit coupled 
to the tachometer. In a thermocouple thermometer, the measured signal 
is an electromotive force which is the electrical analog of the temperature 
applied to the thermocouple. Likewise in a differential flowmeter, the mea­
sured signal would be the differential pressure which is the analog of the 
rate of flow through an orifice plate.
Needless to say, the majority of measurement systems are tertiary systems 
and they include the whole range of mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, elec­
tromechanical, and electro-pneumatic instruments.
Whereas the input to a measuring system is known as measurand, the 
output is called measurement.
Measurement

For example, in a bourdon tube gauge, the applied pressure (input to the 
measurement system) is the measurand. The output from the system is the 
movement of the pointer against a calibrated scale, and this pointer movement 
becomes the measurement. Likewise in an electric tachometer, the angular 
speed is the measurand and the movement of the pointer (length change) is 
the measurement.
7.2.3. Contact and Non-contact Type Measurements
Measurements may also be described as (i) contact type where the sens­
ing element of the measuring device has contact with the medium whose 
characteristics are being measured and (ii) non-contact type where the 
sensor does not communicate physically with the medium. The optical, 
radioactive and some of the electrical/electronic measurements belong to 
this category.

7.3. STATIC TERMS AND CHARACTERISTICS
Range and Span
The region between the limits within which an instrument is designed to 
operate for measuring, indicating, or recording a physical quantity is called 
the range of the instrument. The range is expressed by stating the lower and 
upper values. Span represents the algebraic differences between the upper 
and lower range values of the instrument. For example,
Range -10° C to 80° C; Span 90°C
Range 5 bar to 100 bar; 
Span 95 bar
Range 0 V to 75 V; 
Span 75 V
Accuracy, Error, and Correction
No instrument gives an exact value of what is being measured. There is always 
some uncertainty in the measured value. This uncertainty is expressed in 
terms of accuracy and error. Accuracy of an indicated (measured) value may 
be defined as conformity with or closeness to an accepted standard value (true 
value). The accuracy of the measured signal depends upon the intrinsic accu­
racy of the instrument itself, variation of the signal being measured, accuracy 
of the observer, and whether or not the quantity is being truly impressed upon 
the instrument. For example, the accuracy of a micrometer depends upon 
factors like an error in screw, anvil shape, temperature difference, applied 
torque variations, etc.
In general, the result of any measurement differs somewhat from the true 
value of the quantity being measured. The difference between the measured 
value (Vm) and the true value (Vt) of the quantity represents static error or 
absolute error of measurement (Es).
Es = Vm - Vt 
(7.1)
The error may be either positive or negative. For positive static errors, the 
instrument reads high and for negative static errors, the instrument reads low.
From the experimentalist’s viewpoint, static correction or simply cor­
rection (Cs) is more important than the static error. The static correction is 
defined as the difference between the true value and the measured value of 
a quantity:
Cs = Vt - Vm 
(7.2)
The correction of the instrument reading is of the same magnitude as the 
error, but opposite in sign, that is, Cs = -Es.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 309
EXAMPLE 7.1 .
A thermometer reads 73.5°C and the true value of the temperature 
is 73.15°C. Determine the error and the correction for the given 
thermometer.
Solution: Error Es = measured value Vm - true value Vt
= 73.5 - 73.15 = 0.35°C
Correction Cs = -Es = -0.35°C
EXAMPLE 7.2 .
A temperature transducer has a range of 0°C to 100°C and accuracy 
of ±0.5% of full-scale value. Find the error in a reading of 55°C.
Solution: Error Es = ± 0.5°C percent of full-scale value
= ±_05 х 100 = ±0.5°C
100
Thus a nominal reading of 55°C actually indicates a temperature in the 
range of 54.5°C-55.5°C.
EXAMPLE 7.3 .
a. The accuracy of the instrument has been specified as “accurate 
to within ± x for the prescribed or full range of the instrument.” 
How do you interpret it?
b. A thermometer is quoted as having the following specification:
Range and subdivision °C 
Maximum error
-0.75 to + 37.5 x 0.1 
0.25°C
How will you interpret this catalog?
Solution: a. The statement means that the instrument is accurate to 
within ±x at all points on the scale unless specified otherwise. This implies 
that irrespective of the indicated value, the error remains the same. 
For example, a given thermometer may be stated to read within ±0.5°C 
between 100°C and 230°C. Likewise, a scale of length may be read within 
±0.025 cm.
b. The given specification implies that a thermometer can be used for 
temperature measurement between -0.75°C and +37.5°C and has a scale 
that is subdivided into 0.1°C intervals. Further, the error has a tempera­
ture within a region bounded by plus or minus 0.25°C of the indicated 
value. Thus if the meniscus of the mercury-in-glass thermometer were 
read at 28.5°C, the actual temperature would lie between (28.5 ± 0.25)°C.

310 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Hysteresis and Dead Zone
The magnitude of output for a given input depends upon the direction of the 
change of input. This dependence upon previous inputs is called hysteresis. 
Hysteresis is the maximum difference for the same measured quantity (input 
signal) between the upscale and downscale readings during a full range trav­
erse in each direction. The maximum difference is frequently specified as a 
percentage of full scale. Hysteresis results from the presence of irreversible 
phenomenon such as mechanical friction, slack motion in bearings and gears, 
elastic deformation, magnetic and thermal effects. Hysteresis may also occur 
in electronic systems due to heating and cooling effects which occur differen­
tially under conditions of rising and falling input.
Dead zone is the largest range through which an input signal can be var­
ied without initiating any response from the indicating instrument. Friction or 
play is the direct cause of dead zone or band.
Drift
It is an undesired gradual departure of instrument output over a period of 
time that is unrelated to changes in input, operating conditions, or load. Wear 
and tear, high stress developing at some parts, and contamination of primary 
sensing elements cause drift. It may occur in obstruction flow meters because 
of wear and erosion of the orifice plate, nozzle, or Venturi meter. Drift occurs 
in thermocouples and resistance thermometers due to the contamination of 
the metal and a change in its atomic or metallurgical structure. Drift occurs 
very slowly and can be checked only by periodic inspection and maintenance 
of the instrument.
Sensitivity
Sensitivity of an instrument or an instrumentation system is the ratio of the 
magnitude of the response (output signal) to the magnitude of the quantity 
being measured (input signal), that is,
change of output signal
Static sensitivity, K = 
(7.3)
change of input signal
Sensitivity has a wide range of units, and these depend upon the instrument 
or measurement system being investigated. For example, the operation of a 
resistance thermometer depends upon a change in resistance (output) to change 
in temperature (input), and as such its sensitivity will have units of ohms/°C. 
Sensitivity of an instrument system is usually required to be as high as possible 
because then it becomes easier to take the measurement (read the output).

EXAMPLE 7.5
Explain the following statements:
i. A galvanometer has sensitivity specified as 15 mm/mA
ii. An automatic balance has a quoted sensitivity of 1 vernier 
division/0.1 mg
Solution:
i. This means that for 1 mA input the display (which is the light spot moving 
across a scale) shows a movement of an index of 15 mm.
ii. This means that the index moves through one division when the mass 
changes by 0.1 mg.
Threshold and Resolution
The smallest increment of the quantity being measured which can be detected 
with certainty by an instrument represents the threshold and resolution of the 
instrument.
When the input signal to an instrument is gradually increased from zero, 
there will be some minimum value input before which the instrument will 
not detect any output change. This minimum value is called the threshold of 
the instrument. Thus threshold defines the minimum value of input which is 
necessary to cause a detectable change from zero output. Threshold may be 
caused by backlash or internal noise.
When the input signal is increased from non-zero value, one observes 
that the instrument output does not change until a certain input increment is 
exceeded. This increment is termed resolution or discrimination. Thus reso­
lution defines the smallest change of input for which there will be a change of 
output. With analog instruments, the resolution is determined by the ability 
of the observer to judge the position of a pointer on a scale, for example, the 
level of mercury in a glass tube.
Threshold and resolution may be expressed as an actual value or as a frac­
tion or percentage of full-scale value.

312 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
EXAMPLE 7.6
How resolution is reckoned for the analog and digital read-out 
devices?
A force transducer measures a range of 0-150 N with a resolution 
of 0.1% of full scale. Find the smallest change which can be measured.
Solution: Resolution = 0.1% of full-scale value
= 0.1/100 X 150 = 0.15 N
and this represents the smallest measurable change in force.
EXAMPLE 7.7
Distinguish between threshold and resolution (or discrimination).
The pointer scale of a thermometer has 100 uniform divisions, 
full-scale reading is 200°C and 1/10th of a scale division can be esti­
mated with a fair degree of accuracy. Determine the resolution of the 
instrument.
Solution: 1 scale division = 200/100 = 2°C
Resolution = 1/10th of scale division
= 1/10 X 2 = 0.2°C
Precision Repeatability and Reproducibility
These terms refer to the closeness of agreement among several measurements 
of the same true value under the same operating conditions.
Let us differentiate between accuracy and precision as applied to the 
realms of measurements. Accuracy refers to the closeness or conformity to 
the true value of the quantity under measurement. Precision refers to the 
degree of agreement within a group of measurements, that is, it prescribes 
the ability of the instrument to reproduce its reading over and over again for 
a constant input signal. This distinction can be elaborated by considering the 
following two examples:
i. Consider a micrometer normal in every respect but with its anvil displaced 
from its true position. The readings taken with this micrometer would be 
clearly defined and consistent, that is, a negligible scatter among different 
readings for the same dimension. We would say that the micrometer is as 
precise as ever. The readings, however, do not conform to the truth as the 
anvil is not placed at its correct position. The readings of the dimension 
with this micrometer are thus not accurate.
ii. Consider two voltmeters of the same model, make, and range. Further, 
let both have knife-edge pointers, carefully ruled and mirror-backed scale

Measurement and Instrumentation • 313
(a) High precision 
high accuracy
(b) High precision 
low accuracy
FIGURE 7.5 Difference between accuracy and precision.
(c) Low precision 
low accuracy
to help avoid parallax errors. Both the voltmeters can be read to the same 
precision. In case the series resistance of one of the voltmeters is defec­
tive, its readings would be subjected to an error. The accuracy of the two 
instruments would then be different.
The difference between accuracy and precision has been illustrated in 
Figure 7.5. The arrangement may be thought to correspond to the game of 
darts where one is asked to strike a target represented by a center circle. The 
center circle then represents the true value, and the result achieved by the 
striker has been indicated by the mark X.
Two further terms used to define reproducibility are:
• • Stability refers to the reproducibility of the mean reading of an instru­
ment, repeated on different occasions separated by intervals of time which 
are long compared with the time of taking a reading. The conditions of 
use of the instrument remain unchanged.
• • Constancy refers to the reproducibility of the mean reading of an 
instrument when a constant input is presented continuously and the 
conditions of the test are allowed to vary within specified limits. This 
variation may be due to some change in the external environmental 
conditions.
The above discussion also points out that it is possible to obtain high pre­
cision with poor accuracy, but not high accuracy with low precision. In other 
words, precision is a necessary prerequisite to accuracy but it does not guar­
antee accuracy.
Linearity
The working range of most of the instruments provides a linear relationship 
between the output (reading taken from the scale of the instrument) and input 
(measurand, signal presented to the measuring system). Linearity is defined 

314 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
as the ability to reproduce the input characteristics symmetrically, and this 
can be expressed by the straight line equation.
y = mx + c
where y is the output, x is the input, m is the slope, and c is the intercept. 
Apparently, the closeness of the calibration curve to a specified straight line is 
the linearity of the instrument.
Any departure from the straight line relationship is non-linearity. The 
non-linearity may be due to non-linear elements in the measurement device, 
mechanical hysteresis, viscous flow or creep, and elastic after-effects in the 
mechanical system.
Some other terms associated with the static performance of an 
instrument are:
• • Tolerance: Range of inaccuracy which can be tolerated in measurements: 
it is the maximum permissible error. For example, the tolerance would be 
±1% when an inaccuracy of ±1 bar can be tolerated for 100 bar value of 
pressure.
• • Readability and least count: The term readability indicates the close­
ness with which the scale of the instrument may be read. The term 
least count represents the smallest difference that can be detected on 
the instrument scale. Both readability and least count are dependent on 
length scale, spacing of graduations, size of the pointer, and parallax effect.
• • Backlash: The maximum distance or angle through which any part of 
a mechanical system may be moved in one direction without applying 
appreciable force or motion to the next part in a mechanical system.
• • Zero stability: A measure of the ability of the instrument to restore to 
zero reading after the measurand has returned to zero, and other variations 
(temperature, pressure, humidity, vibration, etc.) have been removed.
• • Stiction (Static friction): Force or torque that is necessary just to initi­
ate motion from rest.
Calibration
The magnitude of the error and consequently the correction to be applied is 
determined by making a periodic comparison of the instrument with stand­
ards that are known to be constant. The entire procedure laid down for 
making, adjusting, or checking a scale so that readings of an instrument or 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 315
measurement system conform to an accepted standard is called calibration. 
The graphical representation of the calibration record is called the calibration 
curve and this curve relates standard values of input or measurand to actual 
values of output throughout the operating range of the instrument.
A comparison of the instrument reading may be made with
i. 
a primary standard,
ii. a secondary standard of accuracy greater than the instrument to be 
calibrated, and
iii. a known input source.
For example, we may calibrate a flowmeter by comparing it with a stan­
dard flow measurement facility at the National Bureau of Standards; by com­
paring it with another flow meter (a secondary standard) that has already 
been compared with a primary standard; or by direct comparison with a pri­
mary measurement such as weighing a certain amount of water in a tank and 
recording the time elapsed for this quantity to flow through the meter.
The following points and observations need consideration while calibrat­
ing an instrument:
i. 
Calibration of the instrument is carried out with the instrument in the 
same position (upright, horizontal, etc.) and subjected to the same tem­
perature and other environmental conditions under which it is to operate 
while in service.
ii. The instrument is calibrated with values of the measurand impressed both 
in the increasing and the decreasing order. The results are then expressed 
graphically; typically the output is plotted as the ordinate and the input or 
measurand as the abscissa.
iii. Output readings for a series of impressed values going up the scale may 
not agree with the output readings for the same input values when going 
down.
iv. Lines or curves plotted in the graphs may not close to form a loop.
In a typical calibration curve (Figure 7.6) ABC represents the readings 
obtained while ascending the scale; DER represents the readings during 
descent; KLM represents the median and is commonly accepted as the cal­
ibration curve. The term “median” refers to the mean of a series of up and 
down readings.

316 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Quite often, the indicated val­
ues are plotted as abscissa and the 
ordinate represents the variation 
of the median from the true values 
(Figure 7.7).
A faired curve through the 
experimental points then rep­
resents the correction curve. 
This type of deviation presen­
tation facilitates a rapid visual 
assessment of the accuracy of 
the instrument. The user looks 
along the abscissa for the value 
indicated by the instrument and 
then reads the correction to be
applied.
A properly prepared cali­
bration correction curve gives 
information about the abso­
lute static errors of the mea­
suring device, the extent of 
the instrument’s linearity or 
conformity, and the hyster­
esis and repeatability of the 
instrument.

7.4. MEASUREMENT ERRORS
Despite utmost care and precautions an experimenter may take to eliminate 
all possible errors, the happy goal is seldom attained and certain errors are 
bound to creep in. For example, even in an apparently simple measurement 
of flow velocity with a pitot tube, any misalignment of the probe, leaks in the 
pressure tubing, changes in the bore and surface conditions of the manome­
ter, any fluctuations in the atmospheric and stream pressure are likely to affect 
the probe readings and give rise to uncertainties. Errors and uncertainties are 
inherent in the process of making any measurement and in the instrument 
with which the measurements are made.
Errors may originate in a variety of ways and the following sources need 
examination.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 317
Instruments Errors
There are many factors in the design and construction of instruments that 
limit the accuracy attainable. Instruments and standards possess inherent 
inaccuracies and certain additional inaccuracies develop with use and time. 
Example are:
• • Improper selection and poor maintenance of the instrument.
• • Faults of construction resulting from finite width of knife edges; lost 
motion due to necessary clearance in gear teeth and bearing; excessive 
friction at the mating parts, etc.
• • Mechanical friction and wear, backlash, yielding of supports, pen or 
pointer drag, and hysteresis of elastic members due to aging.
• • Unavoidable physical phenomenon due to friction, capillary attraction, 
and imperfect rarefaction.
• • Assembly errors resulting from the incorrect fitting of the scale zero with 
respect to the actual zero position of the pointer, non-uniform division of 
the scale, and bent or distorted pointers.
The assembly errors do not alter with time and can be easily discovered 
and corrected. Uncertainty in measurement due to friction at the mating 
parts, and the pen and pointer drag is frequently reduced by gently tapping 
of the instruments; a vigorous tapping would however lead to delicate bearing 
being injured and thus increasing friction all the more.
Environmental Errors
The instrument location and the environment errors are introduced by using 
an instrument in conditions different for which it has been designed, assem­
bled, and calibrated. The different conditions of use may be temperature, 
pressure, humidity, altitude, etc.; the effect of temperature being more pre­
dominant. A change in the temperature may alter the elastic constant of spring, 
may change the dimensions of a measuring element or linkage in the system, 
may alter the resistance values and flux densities of magnetic elements.
Consider a mercury-in-glass thermometer being used for the measure­
ment of air temperature. The instrument will be located wrongly if during 
measurements the sun happens to be shining on the thermometer bulb. Simi­
larly, the bulb would indicate an effect of heat radiation if the thermometer is 
placed too close to a window. Likewise, high air pressure would tend to com­
press the walls of the bulb and force the mercury to rise within the capillary 
and thus give a spurious temperature reading.

318 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Environmental errors alter with time in an unpredictable manner. The 
following methods have been suggested to eliminate or at least reduce 
environmental errors.
• • Use the instruments under the conditions for which it was originally 
assembled and calibrated. This may involve control of temperature, pres­
sure, and humidity conditions.
• • Measure deviations in the local conditions from the calibrated ones and 
then apply suitable corrections to the instrument readings.
• • Automatic compensation for the departures from the calibrated condi­
tions by using sophisticated devices.
• • Make a completely new calibration under the local conditions.
The method chosen would depend on the local assessment of the 
problem.
Translation and Signal Transmission Errors
The instrument may not sense or translate the measured effect with complete 
fidelity. The error also includes the non-capability of the instrument to follow 
rapid changes in the measured quantity due to inertia and hysteresis effects. 
The transmission errors creep in when the transmitted signal is rendered 
faulty due to its distortion by resonance, attenuation, loss leakage, or being 
absorbed or otherwise consumed within the communication channel. The 
error may also result from unwanted disturbances such as noise, line pick-up, 
hum, ripple, etc. The errors are remedied by calibration and by monitoring 
the signal at one or more points along its transmission path.
Observation Errors
There goes a saying that “instruments are better than the people who use 
them.” Even when an instrument has been properly selected, carefully 
installed, and faithfully calibrated, shortcomings in the measurement occur 
due to certain failings on the part of the observer. The observation errors may 
be due to:
• • Parallax, that is apparent displacement when the line of vision is not nor­
mal to the scale.
• • Inaccurate estimates of average reading, lack of ability to interpolate 
properly between graduations.
• • Incorrect conversion of units in between consecutive readings, and non-si­
multaneous observation of interdependent quantities.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 319
• • Personal bias, that is, a tendency to read high or low, or anticipate a signal 
and read too soon.
• • Wrong scale reading and wrong recording of data.
The poor mistakes resulting from the inexperience and carelessness of the 
observer are obviously remedied with careful training, and by taking indepen­
dent readings of each item by two or more observers.
Operational Errors
A prerequisite to precise and meticulous measurements is that the instru­
ments should be properly used. Quite often, errors are caused by poor opera­
tional techniques. Examples are:
• • A differential type of flowmeter will read inaccurately if it is placed imme­
diately after a valve or a bend.
• • A thermometer will not read accurately if the sensitive portion is insuffi­
ciently immersed or is radiating heat to a colder portion of the installation.
• • A pressure gauge will correctly indicate pressure when it is exposed only 
to the pressure which is to be measured.
• • A steam calorimeter will not give the indication of the dryness fraction 
of steam unless the sample drawn correctly represents the condition of 
steam.
System Interaction Errors
The act of measurement may affect the condition of the measurements and 
thus lead to uncertainties in measurements. Examples are:
• • Introduction of a thermometer alters the thermal capacity of the system 
and provides an extra path for heat leakage.
• • A ruler pressed against a body results in a differential deformation of the 
body relative to the ruler.
• • An obstruction-type flowmeter may partially block or disturb the flow 
conditions. Consequently, the flow rate shown by the meter may not be 
the same as before the meter installation.
• • Reading shown by a hand tachometer would vary with the pressure with 
which it is pressed against the shaft.
• • A milliammeter would introduce additional resistance in the circuit and 
thereby alter the flow current by a significant amount.

320 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The job of an instrument designer is to see whether the alteration due 
to system interference is minimal. Many of the most precise, expensive, and 
elaborate measuring instruments owe their cost and complexity solely to the 
means adopted to eliminate, or at least reduce interaction between the instru­
ment and the physical state being measured.
The errors discussed above may be grouped into systematic errors and 
random errors.
Systematic errors are repeated consistently with the repetition of the 
experiment and have the same magnitude and sign for a given set of con­
ditions. They alter the instrument reading by a fixed magnitude and with 
the same sign from one reading to another. Because of the same algebraic 
sign, systematic errors tend to accumulate and hence are often called 
cumulative errors. Instrument bias is another term for systematic errors. 
These errors are caused by such effects as sensitivity shifts, zero offsets, 
and known non-linearity. Systematic errors cannot be determined by direct 
and repetitive observation of the measurand made each time with the same 
technique. The only way to locate these errors is to have repeated measure­
ments under different conditions or with different equipment and where 
possible by an entirely different method. Some factors leading to system­
atic errors are:
i. 
pointer offset
ii. change in ambient temperature
iii. poor design and construction of the instrument
iv. buoyant effect of the wind and the weights of a chemical balance
v. inequality of the arms of a beam balance
vi. change in the original state of the system due to interaction between the 
instrument and the system.
Random errors are accidental, small, and independent and are mainly due 
to inconsistent factors such as spring hysteresis, stickiness, friction, noise, and 
threshold limitations. Since these errors vary both in magnitude and sign (are 
positive or negative based on chance alone), they tend to compensate one 
another and are referred to as chance/accidental/compensating errors. The 
random errors are detected by lack of consistency in the measured value when 
the same input is imposed repeatedly on the instrument (measured values are 
not precise and show a considerable scatter). The magnitude and direction of 
random errors cannot be predicted from a knowledge of the measurement 
system; however, these errors are assumed to follow the law of probabilities. 
Some factors leading to random errors are:

Measurement and Instrumentation • 321
i. 
stickiness and friction,
ii. line voltage fluctuations,
iii. vibration of instrument supports,
iv. large dimensional tolerances between the mating parts,
v. spring hysteresis and elastic deformation, and
vi. inconsistencies associated with accurate measurement of small quantities.
7.5. PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS
Pressure measurement is undoubtedly one of the most common of all the 
measurements made on systems. In a company with temperature and flow, 
pressure measurements are extensively used in industry, laboratories, and 
many other fields for a wide variety of reasons. Pressure measurements are 
concerned not only with the determination of force per unit area exerted by 
a fluid at a point but are also involved in many liquid levels, density, flow, 
and temperature measurements. Measurement of pressure is also needed to 
maintain safe operating conditions, to help control a process, and to provide 
test data.
Pressure measurement by any technique is essentially based on the fol­
lowing well-known propositions:
i. 
Pressure at any point in a body of liquid at rest is proportional to the 
depth of the point below the free surface of the liquid, and increases in 
the downward direction at a rate equivalent to the density of the liquid. 
Further, within a continuous expanse of the same fluid, pressure is the 
same at any two points which lie in a horizontal plane.
ii. There is pressure equality throughout a fluid, that is, a pressure applied to 
a confined fluid via a movable surface would be transferred undiminished 
to all the boundary surfaces.
iii. Pressure is unaffected by the shape of the confining boundaries.
Manometers measure pressure by balancing a column of liquid against the 
pressure to be measured. Height of the column so balanced is measured and 
then converted to the desired pressure units. Manometers may be vertical, 
inclined, open, differential, or compound. Choice of any type depends on 
its sensitivity of the measurement, ease of operation, and the magnitude of 
pressure being measured. Manometers can be used to measure gauge, differ­
ential atmospheric, and absolute pressures.

322 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
7.5.1. Piezometer
It is a vertical transparent glass tube, the upper end of which is open to the
atmosphere and the lower end is in communication with the gauge point; a
point in the fluid container at which pressure is to be measured. The rise of
fluid in the tube above a certain gauge point is 
that point.
Fluid pressure at gauge point A
= atmospheric pressure pa at the 
free surface + pressure due to a liquid column 
of height h1
p1 = pa + wh1
where w is the specific weight of the liquid.
Similarly for the gauge point B, 
p2 = pa + wh2
Pressures are generally prescribed with 
atmospheric pressure taken as the zero of the 
pressure scale. Evidently then, p1 = wh1 and p2 
= wh2 and the pressures thus evaluated are the 
gauge pressures.
When using a piezometer to measure the
a measure of the pressure at
Liquid of specific 
weight w
FIGURE 7.8. Pi ezometer
pressure of a moving fluid, the axis of the tube should be absolutely normal 
to the direction of flow and its bottom end must flush smoothly with the pipe 
surface. Any burr or projection would cause obstruction resulting in a change
in the pressure head. Further, to reduce the surface tension and capillary 
effects, a diameter of the tube must be kept at least 6 mm.
Piezometers cannot be used to measure pressures that are consider­
ably excess of atmospheric pressure. Use of a very long glass tube would be 
unsafe, it being both fragile and unmanageable. Further, gas pressure cannot 
be measured as gas does not form any free surface with the atmosphere. 
Again measurement of negative pressure is not possible due to the flow of 
atmospheric air into the container through the tube. These difficulties are 
overcome by modifying the piezometer into a U-tube manometer, also called 
the double-column manometer.
7.5.2. U-Tube Double-Column Manometer
This simplest and most useful pressure measure device consists of a trans­
parent tube bent in the form of letter U and filled with a manometric liquid 
whose density is known. The choice of a particular manometric liquid depends

Measurement and Instrumentation • 323
FIGURE 7.9 U -tube manometers
upon the pressure range and nature of the fluid whose pressure is sought. For 
high ranges, mercury (specific gravity 13.6) is the manometric/balancing liq­
uid. For low-pressure ranges, liquid-like carbon tetrachloride (specific grav­
ity 1.59) or acetylene tetrabromide (specific gravity 2.59) is employed. Quite 
often, some colors are added to the balancing liquid so as to get clear readings.
When both the limbs are open to atmosphere, manometric liquid stands 
at even height. Under the application of pressure px to one limb, the mano­
metric liquid is forced down on the side with a corresponding rise on the other 
side until the column of liquid between the two levels balances the difference 
between the unknown pressure px and the atmospheric pressure pa. Figure 7.9 
shows the schematics of the U-tube being employed for measurement of positive 
and negative pressures.
Arrangement (a) Measurement of pressure greater than atmospheric 
pressure
Due to greater pressure px in the container, the manometric liquid is 
forced downward in the left limb of the U-tube and there is a corresponding 
rise of manometric liquid in the right limb.
For the right limb, the gauge pressure at point 2 is
p2 = atmospheric pressure, that is, zero gauge pressure at the free surface 
+ pressure due to head h2 of manometric liquid of specific weight w2
= 0 + w2 h2
For the left limb, the gauge pressure at point 1 is
p1 = gauge pressure px + pressure due to height h1 of the liquid of specific 
weight w1

Points 1 and 2 are at the same horizontal plane; p1 = p2 and therefore

(7.4)
w v w w )
where w is the specific weight of water and symbol s denotes the specific grav­
ity of a liquid.
Arrangement (b) Measurement of pressure less than atmospheric 
pressure
Due to negative pressure px in the container, the manometric liquid is 
sucked upwards in the left limb of the U-tube and there is a corresponding fall 
of manometric liquid in the right limb.
Pressure in the two legs at the same levels 1 and 2 are equal; p1 = p2 and 
therefore,
px + w1 h1 + w2 h2 = 0

px = -(w1 h1 + w2 h2)

U-tube manometer necessitates two readings, h1 and h2 and that is likely 
to increase the chance of error. The difficulty is circumvented by adopting a 
single-column manometer.
EXAMPLE 7.8
The right limb of a U-tube manometer containing mercury is open 
to the atmosphere while the left limb is connected to a pipe through 
which flows a fluid of specific gravity 0.85. The center of the pipe lines 
15 cm below the level of mercury in the right limb. If the difference 
of mercury level in the two limbs is 25 cm, determine the pressure of 
fluid of the pipe.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 325
Solution: Let px be the gauge pressure of 
the fluid in the pipeline.
Consider pressure balance in the 
horizontal plane 0 - 0; pressures in the 
left and right limbs at this plane are 
equal. That is:
px + w1 h1 = wm h2
or 
px = wm h2 - w1 h1
= (9810 х 13.6) х 0.25
- (9810 х 0.85) х 0.1
= 33354 - 833.85

EXAMPLE 7.9
The right limb of a simple U-tube manometer containing mercury
is open to the atmosphere and the left limb is connected to a pipe
through which flows a fluid 
of specific gravity 0.8. Make 
calculations for the vacuum 
pressure in the pipe if the dif­
ference of mercury level in the 
two limbs is 30 cm and the level 
of fluid in the left limb is 10 cm 
below the center of pipe.
Solution: Let px be the gauge pres­
sure of fluid in the pipeline.
Consider pressure balance in the 
horizontal plane 0 - 0; the pressures 
in the left and right limbs at this level 
are equal. That is:
sp.wt wm
px + w1 h1 + wm h2 = 0
px = -(w1 h1 + wm h2)
= -(9810 х 0.8 х 0.1 + 9810 х 13.6 х 0.3)
= -(784.8 + 40024.8) = -40809.6 N/m2
7.5.3. U-Tube Differential Manometer
A differential manometer is a device used to find the difference in pressure 
between two points in a pipeline or in two different pipes or containers. In 

326 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
general, a differential manometer consists of a U-tube filled with a mano­
metric liquid and with its ends connected to the points between which the 
pressure difference is to be measured. Figure 7.10 shows the two common 
arrangements of a differential manometer.
In the upright configuration of the U-tube differential manometer, the 
manometric liquid contained in the U-tube is a heavier liquid, that is, its spe­
cific weight wm is greater than that of the liquids in the containers.
Consider the pressure balance in the horizontal plane 0 - 0; the pressure 
in the left and right limbs at this plane are equal. That is:
pA + w1(h1 + hm) = pB + w2 h2 + wm hm
or
pA - pB = hm(w2 - w1) + w2 h2 - w1 h1
For the special and frequently encountered case of pipes A and B at the 
same level (h1 = h2) and carrying the same fluid (w1 = w2):
pA - pB = hm(wm - w1)
In terms of head of water column

If water is the fluid in the two pipes and mercury is the manometric

ential manometer,

Measurement and Instrumentation • 327

w
That is the pressure difference measured as a head of the water column is 12.6 
times the difference in height of the mercury column. The sensitivity of such 
a gauge may be defined as the ratio of the observed difference in levels hm to 
the difference of pressure head (Pa Pb ) of water being measured:

With mercury (relative density 13.6) sensitivity is and with paraffin 
(relative density 0.85) the sensitivity is - 1 . Negative sensitivity implies that 
a paraffin-water differential manometer must be used in the inverted position.
In the inverted differential manometer, the manometric liquid is 
lighter than the fluid whose pressure difference is to be ascertained.
Consider the pressure balance in the horizontal place 0 - 0; the pressures 
in the left and right limbs of the inverted U-tube at this place are equal. That is:
pA - w1 h1 - w1 hm = pB - w2 h2 - wm hm
or 
pA - pB = w1 h1 - w2 h2 + hm (w1 - wm)
If the pipes A and B are at the same level (h1 = h2) and carry the same fluid 
(w1 = w2) pA - pB = hm(w1 - wm)
In terms of head of water column,

where sm and s1 are the specific gravities of the manometric liquid and the 
fluid in the pipelines of the flow system.
The following points need to be noted:
i. 
If the manometric liquid is very light, that is, sm <<< s1, then
Pa - Pb = h 
= m
w
ii. If the manometric liquid is so chosen that its relative density is very nearly 
equal to that of fluids in the pipelines (sm ~ s 1) and that the fluids do not 
intermix, the manometer will become very sensitive. A sensitive manom­
eter gives a large value of hm for a small pressure difference.

EXAMPLE 7.1 0
A U-tube differential manometer containing mercury is connected
on one side to pipe A containing carbon tetrachloride (sp. gr. 1.6)
under a pressure of 120 kPa, and on the other side to pipe B con-
taining oil (sp. gr. 0.8) 
under a pressure of 200 
kPa. Pipe A lies 2.5 m 
above pipe B and the 
mercury level in the limb 
communicating with pipe 
A lies 4 m below pipe A. 
Determine the difference

Take the specific weight 
of water = 9.81 kN/m3.
Solution: Consider pres­
sure balance in the horizontal 
plane 0 - 0; the pressures in 
the left and right limbs at this 
plane are equal. That is:
pA + wc h1 + wm hm = pB + w0 h2

That is:

pA - 9810 x 0.8 = pB - 9810 x 0.9 x 0.5 - 9810 x 0.8 x 0.15
pA - pB = 9810(0.8 - 0.9 x 0.5 - 0.8 x 0.15)
= 9810(0.8 - 0.45 - 0.12)

Given: pA = 5 x 104 N/m2
and 
pat = 9810 x 13.6 x 0.73 = 9.74 x 104 N/m2

EXAMPLE 7.1 2
When the pressure at a point is so large that the manometric fluid can­
not be contained within the height of a single U-tube manometer, use 
is made of a compound U-tube manometer which essentially consists 
of a number of simple U-tube manometers arranged in series. For one 
such unit illustrated in Figure 7.13, calculate the pressure difference

between the points A and B. Take ww = 10 kN/m3 for water wm = 136 
kN/m3 for mercury and w0 = 8.5 kN/m3for oil.
Solution: Starting from point A, the governing manometric equation is: 
PA + 10 X 0.9 - 136 X 0.6 + 8.5 X 0.4 - 136 x 0.5 - 10 (0.8 - 0.5) = pB 
pA - pB = - 9 + 81.6 - 3.4 + 68 + 3 = 140.2 kN/m2
7.5.4. Single-Column Manometer
In the industrial well-manometers, one of the legs of the U-tube manometer is 
replaced by a large diameter well; the widened limb is made about 100 times 
greater than the cross-sectional area of the other limb. A change in the level of 
manometric liquid occurring in the wider limb due to pressure changes would 
then be so small that it can be neglected. The pressure difference would then 
be indicated only by the height of the liquid column in the narrow limb.
To start with, let both limbs of the manometer be exposed to atmospheric 
pressure. The liquid level in the wider limb (also called a reservoir, well, 
basin) and narrow limb will correspond to position 0-0. When the wider limb 
is connected to a vessel containing fluid at pressure px (which is greater than 
the atmospheric pressure pa), manometric liquid level in the reservoir will fall 
down by 8h and there will be a corresponding level rise h2 in the narrow limb. 
By conservation of volume and applying manometric equations, the following 
expression can be set up for the pressure px of the fluid contained in the vessel,
1 + -A
px = w2 h2
(7.13)

Measurement and Instrumentation • 331
If the area ratio (a/A) is made so small that it can be neglected, then
px = w2 h2 
(7.14)
Single-column manometers are used as primary standards for calibrating
other pressure gauges and are more sensitive than simple U-tube manometers.
To expand the scale and thereby 
increase sensitivity, the narrow limb of 
the single-column manometer is not 
set vertically but is kept inclined to the 
horizontal axis by an angle 0 as shown in 
Figure 7.15. Gauge pressure px is then 
given by:
,f a
Px = w2 l I sin 9+ A
(7.15)
where l is the rise of liquid in the 
inclined tube.
The scale of the instrument is obvi­
ously expanded due to the presence of 
sin 0. By making 0 quite small, l can 
be increased such that l sin 0 remains 
constant. Any desired 
value of sensitivity (nor­
mally up to about 25 times 
that of a U-tube) may be 
obtained by incorporating 
a swivel mechanism for 
the inclined limb. A mini­
mum value of 0 = 5°. With 
inclination angles less than 
this, the exact position of 
the meniscus is difficult to
FIGURE 7.15 Inclined manometer.
determine.
This type of manometer is frequently called a draft gauge because it is so 
generally used for determining the draft in a steam generator setting and for 
measuring small pressure changes in low-velocity gas flows.
7.5.5. Manometric Liquids
Some of the desirable characteristics of a manometric liquid are:
• • low viscosity, that is, the capability of quick adjustment with pressure 
changes,

332 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
• • low coefficient of thermal expansion, that is, minimum density changes 
with temperature,
• • low vapor pressure, that is, little or no evaporation at ambient conditions,
• • negligible surface tension and capillary effects,
• • non-corrosive, non-poisonous, non-sticky, and stable nature.
Mercury is usually used for measuring vacuum and moderate pressure of 
gas, vapor, or water where moderate sensitivity is required. Mercury does not 
evaporate readily, has a reasonably stable density, forms a sharp meniscus, 
and is clearly seen. However, it amalgamates or corrodes many metals, is poi­
sonous, and is expensive.
Water is used for measuring small vacuums and small pressure differences 
with high sensitivity. Water has a fairly sharp meniscus, is cheap and readily 
available. However, it has a tendency to evaporate and dissolve some gases 
in it. Further, its transparent nature renders it difficult to be seen within the 
manometer tube. A dye added to give it a distinctive color would be deposited 
on the tube walls when water evaporates.
For high multiplication in two-liquid manometers, alcohol and kerosene 
are often used. Kerosene is, however, not satisfactory because of fractional 
vaporization and consequent changes in density. Alcohol is also apt to change 
in density by taking up water.
7.5.6. Advantages and Limitations of Manometers
• • Relatively inexpensive and easy to fabricate.
• • Good accuracy and sensitivity.
• • Requires little maintenance; is not affected by vibrations.
• • Particularly suitable to low pressure and low differential pressures.
• • Sensitivity can be altered easily by affecting a change in the quantity of 
manometric liquid in the manometer.
• • Generally large and bulky, fragile and gets easily broken.
• • Measured medium has to be compatible with the manometric fluid used.
• • Readings are affected by a change in gravity, temperature, and altitude.
• • Surface tension of manometric fluid creates a capillary effect.
• • Meniscus has to be measured by accurate means to ensure improved accuracy.
7.5.7. Mechanical Gauges: Elastic Pressure Transducers
The range of pressures that can be measured with a manometer depends 
upon the manometric fluid used, the minimum displacement which can be 
sensed, and the tube length. Manometers are employed to measure pres­
sure as low as 0.35 N/m2, and also the pressure difference in the range of 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 333
1.4 х 105 to 2.1 x 105 N/m2. Pressures higher than two or three atmospheres 
are invariably measured with mechanical gauges of the Bourdon tube or 
diaphragm type. In these gauges, the fluid pressure is applied to a hollow 
tube, movable diaphragm, or bellows. The deflection thus obtained is trans­
mitted through a suitable mechanism to a needle which indicates pressure 
on a pre-calibrated dial.
Bourdon Gauge: The pressure responsive element of a bourdon gauge 
consists essentially of a metal tube (called bourdon tube or spring), oval in 
cross-section, and bent to form a circular segment of approximately 200°- 
300°. The tube is fixed but open at one end and it is through this fixed end that 
the pressure to be measured is applied. The other end is closed but free to 
allow displacement under deforming action of the pressure difference across 
the tube walls. When pressure (greater than atmosphere) is applied to the 
inside of the tube, its cross-section tends to become circular. This makes the 
tube straighten itself out with a consequent increase in its radius of curvature, 
that is, the free end would collapse and curve.
The free end of the tube is connected to a spring-loaded linkage which 
amplifies the displacement and transmits it to the angular rotation of a pointer 
over a calibrated scale to give a mechanical indication of pressure (Figure 
7.16). The linkage is so designed that the mechanism may be adjusted for 
optimum linearity and minimum hysteresis as well as to compensate for 
wear that may develop over a period of time. A hairspring is sometimes used 
to fasten the spindle to the frame of the instrument to provide necessary 
tension for proper meshing of the gear teeth and thereby freeing the system 
from backlash (lost motion). After prolonged use, the tooth gearing of the 
pinion and sector type linkage wears out and this impairs the accuracy of 
the gauge.
The reference pressure in the
casing containing the bourdon tube 
is usually atmospheric and so the 
pointer indicates gauge pressure.
Bourdon tube shapes and con­
figurations: The C-type bourdon 
tube has a small tip travel and 
this necessitates amplification 
by a lever, quadrant, pinion, and 
pointer arrangement. Increased 
sensitivity can be obtained by 
using a very long length of tubing 
in the form of a helix, and a flat 
spiral as indicated in Figure 7.17.

FIGURE 7.17 Bourdon tube configuration.
The spiral tubing produces the same effect as would be given by a number 
of C-tubes in series. The tip travel is of amount sufficient enough to indicate 
directly against a calibrated dial. Likewise, the increased number of turns of 
a helical bourdon makes it possible to obtain a greater angle of uncoil. Spiral 
and helical tubes frequently are used where it is desirable to eliminate the 
multiplication linkages between the pressure element and the indicating or 
recording arm. The absence of amplification linkage makes the system more 
robust; wear friction and the internal effects of the linkage are eliminated.
The twisted tube has a cross wise stability which reduces spurious output 
motion due to shock and vibration.

ducers.

7.6. VELOCITY MEASUREMENT
Flow velocity constitutes an important parameter in kinematics and dynamics 
of fluid flow and, therefore, its measurement is quite essential. Velocity meas­
urement may be made with a view to:
• • determine the volumetric flow rate,
• • forecast the weather from wind velocity measurements, and
• • locate the separation points from knowledge of velocity distribution.
Flow velocity measurements may be classified as:
i. Instruments like the pitot tube and hot wire anemometers measure the 
local velocity at a point in the channel or duct through which the fluid is 
flowing.
ii. Instruments like cup and vane anemometers, the current and turbine 
meters which measure the average velocity of fluid flow.
A very important class of velocity measuring devices consists of constric­
tion meters. These involve Venturi meters, orifice plates, nozzles, and weirs; 
all of which measure the average velocity of flow from which the volumetric 
flow rate can be computed.
7.6.1. Pitot Tubes
In its elementary form, a pitot tube consists of an L-shaped tube; a tube bent 
through 90° and with ends unsealed. One limb called the body is inserted into 
the flow stream and aligned with the direction of flow while the other limb, 
called the stem, is vertical and open to the atmosphere (Figure 7.18).

merged end of the tube and point 2 (a point at the tip or nose of the tube itself)

The flowing fluid is brought to a state of zero velocity a the nose or tip of 
the tube and therefore, V2 = 0. Further points 1 and 2 lie at the same elevation 
datum, that is, y1 = y2. That gives:
V2 + pl = P2 ; V2 = P2 — Pl
The pressure p1 in the undisturbed free stream flow is called the static 
pressure ps and the pressure p2 at the stagnation point 2 where the velocity is 
zero is referred to as the total pressure pt:

For Figure 7.18(b):
ps = wy and pt = w(y + h)
where h is the rise of liquid level in the stem above the free surface:
. 
V2 w(y + h) - wy
2 g 
w
Hence, free stream velocity V = 2% gh 
(7.7)
Equations (7.16) and (7.17) are equally valid for determining the flow 
velocity at a point in the pipeline. However, the static pressure ps has to be 
measured in addition to the stagnation pressure pt indicated by the pitot tube. 
The static pressure ps can be measured by means of a static pressure opening 
in the pipe wall (Figure 7.18 b) provided the static pressure distribution across 
the pipe is constant. However, in case of high static pressure, readings of the 
piezometer height y and (y + h) become difficult and unmanageable. The dif­
ficulty is circumvented by connecting the pressure tappings to the two limbs 
of a U-tube differential manometer (Figure 7.18c). The difference between 
stagnation and static pressure is:
pt - ps = hm(wm - wf) 
(7.8)
where hm is the manometer deflection, and wm and wf are the specific weight 
of the manometric liquid and that of the liquid flowing through the pipeline.
The system depicted in Figure 7.18(c), though simple in construction, 
causes inconvenience because of the necessity of two connections to the pipe 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 337
and the difficulty of obtain­
ing correct static pressure 
by a single piezometer 
opening. Modern practice 
favors a combined pitot­
static tube illustrated in 
Figure 7.19.
The unit consists 
of two concentrically 
arranged tubes bent to 
form a right-angled bend. 
The inner tube is open- 
ended and senses the fluid

stagnation pressure. The
outer tube is sealed and has a streamlined shape. A number of holes (6 to 8) 
are drilled through the surface of the outer tube between the nose and stem; 
at a distance of 3d from the tip of the tube. The right-angled bent is at a fur­
ther distance of 8d to 10d. The presence of the body constricts the stream­
lines in its proximity, thereby causing an increase in the velocity or a fall 
in the static pressure. The stem produces a damping effect which tends to 
produce an error of the opposite sign. By careful placement of side tappings 
relative to the nose, a satisfactory reading of the fluid static pressure can be 
obtained.
The pressure differential (pt - ps) = hm(wm - wf) can be measured by 
taking leads from the two limbs to a differential manometer, and velocity 
computation made from the relation
V=
2g x (Pt-Ps) 
wf
(wm — wf ) 
wf
= 72 ghm (sm — 1)
(7.9)
where sm is the specific gravity of the manometric liquid relative to the liquid 
flowing through the pipeline.
The whole of the stream impinging on tip of the may not be brought to 
a state of rest; some may get deflected around the tip. Value of flow velocity 
as computed from Equation (7.9) may, therefore differ slightly from the true 
velocity value. This aspect is accounted for by introducing a factor Cv, called 
the coefficient of velocity,
V = Cv 2gghm (sm - 1) 
(7.10)
The instrument requires calibration to find the value of Cv; for a well- 
designed pitot tube, its value lies between 0.95 and 1.0.

Describe, with the help of a neat diagram, the construction, and oper­
ation of a pitot-static probe.
Air flows through a duct, and the pitot-static tube measuring the 
velocity is attached to a differential manometer which shows a differ­
ence of head of 10 cm of water. The density of air is 1.22 kg/m3 and 
that of water is 1000 kg/m3. Workout the air velocity presuming that 
the coefficient for the pitot tube is 0.98.

A submarine moves horizontally in the sea with its axis much below 
the surface of the water. A pitot tube properly placed just in front of 
the submarine and along its axis is connected to the two limbs of a 
U-tube containing mercury. The difference in mercury level is found 
to be 17 cm. Find the speed of the submarine knowing that the den­
sity of mercury is 13.6 and that of sea water is 1.026 with respect to 
fresh water.

EXAMPLE 7.1 5
Explain how the velocity measurement at a point in fluid flow is made 
by a pitot tube.
A pitot tube was used to measure the velocity of water at the cen­
ter of a 25 cm diameter pipe. The difference between the stagnation 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 339
and static pressure heads was indicated to be 8.5 cm of water. What is 
the velocity? Take coefficient of velocity Cv = 1.0.
If the mean velocity of flow is presumed to be 0.67 of the velocity 
at the center, compute the discharge of water through the pipe in m3/s.
Solution: Velocity at center of pipe, V = Cv %ggh = 1.0 22 x 9.81 x 0.85
Mean velocity = 0.67 x 1.291 = 0.865 m/s
Area of pipe = p (0.85)2 = 0.049 m2
\ Discharge = mean velocity x area = 0.865 x 0.049 = 0.0424 m3/s
7.6.2. Cup and Vane Anemometers
Cup and vane anemometers are the devices that measure the speed of air 
movement. The device consists essentially of a rotating element whose speed 
of rotation varies with the velocity of flow; the relationship between these vari­
ables is determined by appropriate calibration data.
In a cup, anemometer cups are attached to radial arms mounted on a shaft. 
Drag forces are set up on these cups when a flow stream in the plane of rota­
tion approaches the unit from any direction. For the arrangement depicted 
in Figure 7.20(a), the drag on cup A (cup with its open end facing toward 
the stream) is greater than that on cup B (cup with rounded face toward the 
stream). The resultant torque rotates the assembly in the counterclockwise
direction. The number of revolutions is read from a dial for a given period of 
time, and the frequency of rotation gives a measure of the average speed of air 
in the region traversed by the air.
In a vane anemometer, vanes of the windmill type are mounted in sup­
port so that the fluid flow is parallel to the axis of rotation. The rotor drives 
a low-friction gear train 
that in turn drives a 
pointer that indicates the 
wind speed on a dial.
The cup anemom­
eter is usually mounted 
on a rigid shaft, and the 
vane type is held in the 
hand while readings are 
being taken. The cup type 
unit is best for relatively 
low speed whereas the 
vane type measures large

340 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
speeds more accurately. Experiments indicate that provided the wind speed 
is not too large, the relation between wind speed and angular velocity of cups/ 
vanes is linear.
7.6.3. Current and Turbine Meters
Current and turbine meters are the devices that measure the speed of water 
movement.
A current meter consists of a horizontal wheel on which are fixed the coni­
cal buckets of V-shaped vanes. The unit is suspended into the flow stream by a 
suspension cable which is held taut (in tension) by a streamlined weight. Hor­
izontal positioning (placement of the unit along the flow direction) is ensured 
by a streamlined tail vane. When the unit is held in a flowing stream, the 
liquid strikes the buckets, and that sets the wheel in rotation. At every revolu­
tion, signals are transmitted to the observer or to a revolution counter through 
electrical contacts. The frequency of rotation is directly related to the velocity 
of flow by appropriate calibration data.

A turbine meter is similar in operation to a cup anemometer and depends

bladed rotor in the fluid flow stream.
7.7. FLOW MEASUREMENT
The head meter in the form of Venturi meter, orifice, and flow nozzle is by 
far the most common flow meter for closed conduits. When the fluid flows 
through these obstruction meters, the fluid accelerates and a reduction in 
pressure occurs. The difference in pressure before and after the obstruction 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 341
is measured by means of the differential pressure sensor and is related to the 
flow rate.
Venturi flow meter: The Venturi meter was invented by Clemens Her- 
shel in 1887 and has been named in the honor of an Italian engineer Venturi. 
This simple and reliable device finds extensive use for water flow measure­
ment, particularly in large-sized pipes and for large flow rates.
FIGURE 7.23 Venturi flow meter.
The important constructional features of a Venturi meter are shown in 
Figure 7.23. The meter consists of:
i. 
Cylindrical entrance section: This section has the size of pipe to which it 
is attached. For satisfactory operation, the Venturi meter should be pre­
ceded by a straight pipe of not less than 5-10 pipe diameters and be free 
from fittings, misalignment, and other sources of large-scale turbulence. 
If these conditions cannot be met, straightening vanes should be placed 
upstream from the meter for reduction of rotational motion in flow.
ii. Converging conical section: The converging takes place at an angle of 
21° ± 2°. The velocity of fluid increases as it passes through the converging 
section and correspondingly the static pressure falls.
iii. Throat: This is a cylindrical section of minimum area. At this section, the 
velocity is maximum and the pressure is minimum. The throat diameter is 
usually between 1/2 and 1/4 of the inlet diameter. The length of the throat 
equals its diameter.
iv. Diverging section in which there is a change of stream area back to the 
entrance area. The recovery of kinetic energy by its conversion to pres­
sure is nearly complete and so the overall pressure loss is small. To accom­
plish a maximum recovery of kinetic energy, the diffuser section is made 

342 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
with an included angle of 5°-7°. This angle has to be kept less so that the 
flowing fluid has the least tendency to separate out from the boundary of 
the section. However, with small angles, the length and hence the cost 
of the meter would increase. So where pressure recovery is not of much 
importance, the angle of the diverging cone may be kept as high as 14°.
The pressure taps are made at the throat and at the entrance where the 
Venturi meter has a diameter equal to that of pipe. The pressure taps may be 
made either from a single hole or at piezometer rings thereby giving average 
values at the two sections.
The small-sized Venturi meter, suitable for pipelines less than 5 cm in 
diameter, are usually made of brass or bronze. The inside surface is smoothly 
finished to reduce friction. Large venturies are usually made of cast iron; the 
throat is, however, lined with brass or bronze and machined to a smooth fin­
ish. Very large venturies up to 6 m pipe diameter have been made of smooth 
surface concrete; only the throat is made of machined bronze.
Advantages and Limitations
• • High-pressure recovery is attainable, that is, loss of head due to installa­
tion in the pipelines is small. Due to the low value of losses, the coefficient 
of discharge is high and it may approach unity under favorable conditions.
• • Because of the smooth surface, the meter is not much affected by wear 
and tear. Less likelihood of becoming clogged with sediments.
• • Well-established characteristics; years of application experience.
• • Ideally suited for a large flow of water, process fluids, wastes, gases, and 
suspended solids.
• • Long laying length; space requirements are more. Quite expensive in 
installation and replacement.
Venturi meters are not standardized yet to an extent that permits dis­
charge coefficient from one meter to be used with another. From dimen­
sional analysis and dynamic similarity conditions, the discharge coefficient for 
a Venturi meter is found to be a function of Reynolds number and meter size. 
These meters are not generally useful below 7.5 cm pipe diameter.
Flow nozzle: Nozzles are used in engineering practice for the creation 
of jets and streams for all purposes as well as for fluid metering. When 
placed in or at the end of a pipeline as metering devices, they are called 
flow nozzles.
The flow nozzle comprises a smooth, gradual contraction to the throat by 
a free uncontrolled expansion back to the pipe flow area. Because the device 
contains no provision for an orderly transformation of velocity into static

Measurement and Instrumentation • 343
pressure, the nozzle has a pres­
sure loss from 80 to 90% of the 
differential pressure obtained. 
The discharge coefficient of a 
flow nozzle is dependent upon 
the smoothness of the approach 
to tangency, the length of the 
cylindrical portion of the noz­
zle, and the location of the pres­
sure taps. Pipe wall taps located 
at one pipe diameter upstream 
and half pipe downstream from
FIGURE 7.24 Flow nozzle.
the inlet face of the nozzle give the best results. The flow nozzles are usually 
made of gun metal, stainless steel, or Monel metal.
Advantages and Limitations
• • Cheaper than a standard Venturi meter; can be installed in an existing 
main without great difficulty.
• • Increased coefficient of discharge when compared to orifice, and less 
physical length compared to Venturi meter.
• • Widely accepted for high pressure/temperature steam flow; further good 
for fluids containing solids that settle.
•• Pressure recovery is poor and so cannot be used where the available pres­
sure head is small or where pressure recovery is a must. The pressure loss 
is, however, less than that of an orifice plate.
•• Compared to the orifice meter, it is expensive and difficult to install.
•• Limited to moderate pipe size; not available above 120 cm.
Orifice flow meter: The orifice meter consists of a thin, circular metal 
plate with a hole in it. The plate is held in the pipeline between two flanges 
called orifice flanges (Figure 7.25). The flow characteristics of the orifice dif­
fer from those of a nozzle in that the minimum section of the streamtube 
occurs not within the orifice but downstream from the orifice edge. Section 
of the minimum area is called vena contracta and minimum pressure exists at 
this section. Location of vena contracta depends on Reynolds number, area 
ratio between orifice and pipe, the roughness of pipe and, the compressibility 
of the flowing medium. It is also sensitive to the upstream velocity profiles 
and sharpness of the upstream edge of the orifice plate. Evidently, the loca­
tion of downstream pressure connection at vena contracta is not feasible and 
as such, it is taken at a fixed proportion of the pipe diameter and a correc­
tion for vena contracta is made. Ideally, it should be placed where disturbing 

344 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
factors are least. For accuracy of results, there should be uniform flow condi­
tions upstream of the orifice and for this a straight pipeline of at least 10 pipe 
diameter should precede the orifice. The discharge coefficient varies with the 
type of orifice, the pipe size, ratio of orifice diameter to pipe diameter, Reyn­
olds number, and location of pressure connections.
FIGURE 7.25 Orifice flow meter.
Orifice plates are made from steel, stainless steel, phosphor bronze, and 
other such materials that can withstand the corrosive effect of the flowing 
medium. Its thickness is only sufficient to withstand the buckling forces 
caused by the pressure differential. The circular hole is carefully made with a 
90° square sharp edge. Wear and abrasion of this sharp edge greatly affect the 
accuracy of the orifice flow measurement. For this reason, an orifice should 
not be used to measure flow containing abrasives or other materials which 
would damage the edge. In some cases, it is advisable to replace the orifice 
plate frequently to maintain accuracy.
Advantages and Limitations
•• 
Low initial cost, ease of installation, and replacement. Requires less space 
as compared to Venturi meter.
• 
Can be used in a wide range of pipe sizes (1.25-150 cm).
•• Pressure recovery is poor; the overall pressure loss varies from 40 to 90% 
of the differential pressure.
•• 
Coefficient of discharge has a low value.
•• 
Necessity of providing straightening vanes upstream.
•• 
Susceptible to inaccuracies resulting from erosion, corrosion, and scaling. 
Tends to clog and as such not suitable for slurries or entrained particles.

Theory of variable head meters: The equations convenient for prac­
tical use and for providing the basis of operation of variable head meters are 
derived by following three steps given below:
i. 
Apply Bernoulli’s equation to the upstream and downstream pressure 
connections and modify it for the assumed conditions.
ii. Solve the modified equation for the downstream velocity.
iii. Express the flow rate by the product of area and velocity, that is, Q = AV.
Let subscript 1 refer to the pipe and the fluid at the upstream pressure 
connection and subscript 2 refer to the pipe and fluid at the section of mini­
mum area. Bernoulli’s equation gives:

that is, y1 = y2, we get

The downstream fluid velocity as given by Equation (7.13) has been 
derived without considering any losses and so it is the ideal or theoretical 
velocity at the minimum section. The actual velocity can be obtained by multi­
plying the theoretical velocity by a factor Cv called the coefficient of velocity. 
The coefficient of velocity is the ratio of actual mean velocity which would 
occur without any friction loss

During flow through an orifice meter, the fluid jet on leaving the orifice 
contracts to a minimum area at the vena contracta. Area of fluid jet at vena 
contracta is less than the area of the orifice and the two areas are related by 
the equation:
area of jet at vena contracta = Cc x orifice area
where Cc is the coefficient of contraction. Thus if the orifice area is A2 then 
the area at a minimum section that controls the flow rate and where the path 
of particles becomes parallel again would be Cc A2

For Venturi meter and flow nozzle, there is almost no formation of vena

charge, the volumetric flow rate through the meter can be written as:

The pressure differential P1—P2, called the pressure head or piezome­
ter head, is measured by a differential U-tube manometer. The manometer 
reading is the same for a given discharge irrespective of the inclination of the 
pipeline.

laid with axis horizontal and is used for measuring the flow of oil of

7.7.1 . Rotameter
The rotameter consists of a tapered metering glass tube, inside which is 
located the rotor or active element (float) of the rotor. This tapering tube is 
provided with suitable inlet and outlet connections. The float or bob material 
has specific gravity higher than that of the fluid to be metered.
With an increase in the flow rate, the float rises in the tube and there 
occurs an increase in the annular area between the float and the tube. The 
float adjusts its position in relation to discharge through the passage, that 
is, the float rises higher or lower depending on the flow rate. The discharge 
equation for flow through a rotameter is given by
Q = Cd A [2 gVf (r - r)/Af r ]1 
(7.18)
where Q is the volume flow rate, Cd is the discharge coefficient, Vf is the vol­
ume of float, rf is the density of float material, r is the density of fluid flowing, 
Af is the cross-sectional area of the float and A is the annular area between 
float and tube.
The glass tube is often made of high-strength borosilicate glass and the 
flow rate scale is engraved on the tube corresponding to a particular float 
material. However, where greater strength is required, the metallic tubes are 

348 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
used and the position of float is detected magnetically. Further, for remote 
indication, the position of float can be monitored electrically by using a suit­
able displacement transducer.
The rotameter is equally suitable for measuring both gas and liquid flows. 
When metering gas flows, a small sphere is used in a narrow tube and no 
guidance needs to be provided to its motion. While metering liquid fluids, 
spherical slots are cut on a part of the float and these slots cause it to rotate 
slowly about the axis of tube and keep it central. This spinning helps also to 
prevent the accumulation of any sediment on the top and sides of the float. 
Alternatively, stability of the bob is ensured by employing a guide along which 
the float would slide.
The float or bob material has a specific gravity higher than that of the 
fluid to be metered. The density difference (rf - r) required for metering a 
particular liquid or gas can be obtained by selecting different materials for
the float. An examination of the discharge equation (7.28) would reveal that
when rf >> r, the volume flow rate becomes independent of the density r of 
the flowing fluid.
Rotameters are widely used for 
metering purge flows, pump-seal fluids, 
and coolants and lubricants for operat­
ing machinery. In these applications, 
flows are relatively small and accuracy 
requirements are not rigid.
Advantages and Limitations of a Rotameter
• • Simplicity of operation, ease of 
reading, and installation.
• • Relatively low cost.
• • Handles a wide variety of corrosive 
fluids.
• • Easily equipped with data trans­
mission, indicating, and recording 
devices.
• • Possibility of convenient and visible 
flow comparisons by mounting sev­
eral rotameters side by side.
• • Glass tube subject to breakage.
• • Limited to small pipe sizes and 
capacities.
• • Less accurate compared to Venturi 
and orifice meters.

• • Must be mounted vertically.
• • Subject to oscillations in pulsating flows.
7.8. TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT
Temperature is probably the most widely measured and frequently controlled 
variable encountered in industrial processing of all kinds. Measurement of 
temperature potential is involved in thermodynamics, heat transfer, and many 
chemical operations. Basically, all the properties of matter such as size, color, 
electrical and magnetic characteristics, and the physical states (i.e., solid, liq­
uid, and gas) change with changing temperatures The occurrence of physical 
and chemical changes is governed by the temperature at which a system is 
maintained.
Temperature measurement depends upon the establishment of thermo­
dynamic equilibrium between the system and the device used to sense the 
temperature, for example, a thermometer bulb or thermocouple wires. The 
sensor has certain physical characteristics which change with temperature and 
this effect is taken as a measure of the temperature. The physical characteris­
tics which are so used could be:

A change in dimension, that is, expansion or contraction of material in the 
form of solid, liquid, or gas.
ii. A change in electrical resistance of metals and semiconductors.
iii. A thermo-electric emf for two different metals and alloys joined together.
iv. A change in the intensity and color or radiation emitted by the hot body.
v. Fusion of materials when exposed to the temperature under investigation.
Calibration is then achieved through comparison with established stan­
dards. The international temperature scale serves to define temperature in 
terms of observable characteristic of materials.
7.8.1. Liquid-in-Glass Thermometers
The liquid-in-glass thermometer is one of the most common types of tem­
perature measuring devices. The unit consists of a glass envelope, a respon­
sive liquid, and an indicating scale. The envelope comprises a thick-walled 
glass tube with a capillary bore, and a spherical or cylindrical bulb filled with 
the liquid. The two parts are fused together and the top end of the cap­
illary tube is sealed. The size of the capillary depends on the size of the 
sensing bulb, responsive liquid, and the desired temperature range of the 

350 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
instrument. Changes in the temperature will cause the fluid to expand and 
rise up the stem. Since the area of the stem is much less than the bulb, the 
relatively small change of fluid volume will result in a significant fluid rise in 
the stem. The length of the movement of the free surface of the fluid column 
serves, by a prior calibration to indicate the temperature of the bulb. The 
laboratory work thermometers have a scale engraved directly on the glass 
stem, while the industry types have separate scale located adjacent to the 
stem. Quite often the top of the capillary tube is also bulb-shaped to provide 
safety features in case the temperature range of the instrument is inadvert­
ently exceeded.
The thermometer bulb is usually filled with mercury. It has the advan­
tages of a broad temperature span between its freezing and boiling points, 
a nearly linear coefficient of expansion, relative ease of obtaining it in a very 
pure state, and its nonwetting glass characteristics. When measuring tempera­
ture above the boiling point of mercury (390°C atmospheric pressure), mer­
cury may evaporate and condense at the top of the stem. This is prevented by 
filling the space above mercury with nitrogen or carbon dioxide under high 
pressure. This raises the boiling point and allows temperatures up to 610°C 
to be measured.
However, in many industrial applications, 
the escape of mercury through breakage causes 
considerable damage to the products. This 
may necessitate the use of other liquids such 
as alcohol, pentane, and toluene, which do not 
cause contamination. These liquids are also 
used for temperature measurements below 
the freezing point of mercury. These liquids 
have further advantages of superior readability 
to mercury when colored with inert dyes and 
of low cost. However, they have low boiling 
points, a greater tendency to separate in the 
capillary, and wetting glass characteristics.
The choice in the type of glass used is a 
matter of economics influenced by the range 
of the thermometer—the higher the range, the 
higher the cost. For temperature up to 450°C, 
normal glass is used. At high temperature up to 
about 520°C, borosilicate glass is used. Above 
this temperature, quartz thermometers have 
been used but they are not common.

• • simplicity of use and relatively low cost,
• • easily portable,
• • ease of checking for physical damage,
• • absence of need for auxiliary power,
• • no need for additional indicating instruments,
• • fragile construction; range limited to about 600°C,

to relatively high heat capacity of the bulb.
7.8.2. Solid Expansion or Bimetallic Thermometer
A bimetal strip consists of two pieces of different metals firmly bonded 
together by welding. For a bimetal in the form of a straight cantilever beam, 
temperature changes cause the free end to deflect because of the different 
expansion rates of the components. This deflection can be correlated quanti­
tatively to the temperature change.
FIGURE 7.28 Bimetallic strip.
When a bimetal strip in the form of cantilever is assumed to bend through 
a circular arc, then

r expanded length of strip having lower expansion coefficient
= l[1 + a 2 (T - To)~
l [1 + a 1 (T - T0)’

352 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Simplification gives:
r= dr [1 + a 1 (T - To)] 
r (a 2 - a i)(Ti - To)
The tip deflection can be increased with choice of materials that give a 
large value to the difference in their coefficient of expansion. Normally the 
low expansion material is invar (an iron-nickel alloy containing about 36% 
nickel) and the high expansion metal is brass.
Taking a1 — 0 and dr = t/2 (thickness of each metal strip), we get

The movement of free end of the cantilever in a perpendicular direction 
from the initial horizontal line is worked out as follows:
angular displacement 0 = l/r
vertical displacement y = OB - OA = r - r cos 0 
= r (1 - cos 0)
Apparently, when one end of the bimetallic strip is fixed, the position is 
free and is a direct indication of the temperature of the strip.

Bimetalic elements can be arranged in flat, spiral, single helix, and mul­
tiple helix configuration. Figure 7.29 illustrates the functional principle of 
the usual industrial form of a bimetal thermometer. One end of the helix is 
anchored permanently to the casing and the other end is secured to a pointer 
that sweeps over a circular dial graduated in degree of temperature. In 
response to temperature change, the bimetal expands and the helical bimetal 
rotates at its free end, thus turning the stem and pointer to a new position on 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 353
the dial. Likewise, the curvature of the bimetal spiral strip (Figure 7.29(b)) 
varies with temperature and causes a pointer to deflect. The continuous strip 
wound into helical or spiral form has the advantages of compactness while 
providing a long length of strip required for adequate indicator movement.
Bimetallic elements find wide application in simple thermometers in 
which the deflection of the elements is made to open or close electrical con­
tacts in the electrical heat supply or to control a gas flow. Important applica­
tions include the switching devices used in domestic ovens, electric irons, car 
winker lamps, and refrigerators.

FIGURE 7.30 Basic thermocouple circuit.
Experimentally, it has
been found that the magnitude of the current is directly related to the two 
materials M1 and M2 and the temperature difference (T1—T2). In the practical 
application of the effect, a suitable device is incorporated in the circuit to indi­
cate any electromotive force or flow of current. For the convenience of mea­
surement and standardization, one of the two junctions is usually maintained 
at some constant known temperature. The output voltage of the circuit then 
indicates the temperature difference relative to the reference temperature.
Thermo-electric effects arise in two ways:
• • a potential difference always exists between two dissimilar metals in con­
tact with each other (Peltier effect)
• • a potential gradient exists even in a single conductor having a temperature 
gradient (Thomson effect)
In commercial instruments, the thermocouple materials are so chosen 
that the Peltier and Thomson emf’s act in such a manner that the combined 
value is maximum and that varies directly with temperature.
Elements of a Thermo-electric Pyrometer
The essential elements of a thermo-electrical pyrometer are shown schemati­
cally in Figure 7.31.

tors electrically insu­
lated except at the hot 
junction, where the 
conductors may either 
be soldered or welded 
together, or may be com­
pletely separated from 
each other.

• • A refractory and a metal sheath to protect the thermocouple from injuri­
ous furnace gases and to prevent it from mechanical damage.
• • Compensating leads which allow the measuring instrument to be placed 
at a considerable distance from the thermocouple without the necessity of 
using expensive thermocouple materials as extension leads.
• • The cold or the reference junction provided by the instrument used for 
measuring the emf.
Thermocouple Materials
The desirable characteristics of thermocouple materials are:
i. 
The emf produced per degree of temperature change must be sufficient 
to facilitate detection and measurement.
ii. The temperature-emf relationship should be reasonably linear and repro­
ducible. This will make the scale more easily read and also reduce the 
problem of reference junction compensation.
iii. The thermocouple should maintain its calibration without drift over a 
long period of time.
iv. The thermocouple should have a long life so that the cost of temperature 
measurement is not unnecessarily increased with frequent replacement 
of the thermocouple. For that, the thermocouple materials should be 
highly resistant to oxidation, corrosion, and contamination.
v. The material should physically be able to withstand high and rapidly fluc­
tuating temperatures. Any phase change or other internal phenomenon 
will give rise to discontinuity in the temperature-emf relationship.
vi. The material must be such that successive batches can be produced with 
the same thermo-electric characteristics. This will allow the replacement 
of thermocouples without the necessity of recalibrating the temperature 
scale of the indicating instrument.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 355
Depending upon the composition of metals used, the thermocouples are 
sometimes grouped into the following broad categories:
i. 
Base metal thermocouples use combinations of pure metal and alloys of 
iron, copper, and nickel, and are used in lower ranges of temperature up 
to 1375°C.
ii. Rare metal thermocouples use combinations of pure metals and alloys of
a. platinum and rhodium for temperatures up to 1725°C, and
b. tungsten, rhodium, and molybdenum for temperatures up to 2625°C.
7.8.4. Resistance Thermometers and Thermistors
The resistance R (ohms) of an electrical conductor of resistivity r (ohms W), 
length L (cm), and cross-sectional area A (cm2) is given by
R = r L/A 
(7.19)
As temperature changes, the resistance of the conductor also changes. 
This is due to two factors: (i) dimensional change due to expansion or contrac­
tion and (ii) change in the current opposing properties of the material itself. 
For an unconstrained conductor, the latter is much more than 99% of the 
total change for copper. This change in resistance with temperature is used 
for measuring temperature.
Resistance Thermometers
Most metals become more resistant to the passage of electric current as they 
become hotter, that is, their resistance increases with growth in temperature. 
An adequate approximation of the resistance-temperature relationship is 
given by:
Rt = Ro (1 + at + вt2) 
(7.20)
where Rt is resistance at any temperature t°C, Ro is resistance at 0°C, a and 
в are constants depending on the material. The constants Ro, a, and в are 
determined at the ice, steam, and sulfur points, respectively.
Over a limited temperature range around 0°C, the following linear rela­
tionship is equally valid:
R = R o(1 + a0)
where a is the temperature coefficient of resistance in °C-1 and 0 is tempera­
ture relative to 0°C. Some typical values for temperature coefficient are:
a = 0.0039°C-1 for platinum, a = 0.0043°C-1 for copper, a = 0.0068°C-1 
for nickel

356 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
If a change in temperature from 01 to 02 is considered, then
R 1 = R o(1 + a01); R 2 = R o(1 + a0 2)
Rearrangement gives
02 = 01 + R1-R-; R2ZRl = aR 
(7.21)

Apparently, the linear relationship implies that changes in resistance are 
directly proportional to changes in temperature.
The thermometer comprises a resistance element or bulb, suitable elec­
trical leads, and an indicating—recording or resistance measuring instrument. 
The resistance element is usually in the form of a coil of very fine platinum, 
nickel or copper wound non-conductively onto an insulting ceramic former 
which is protected externally by a metal sheath. A laboratory-type resistance 
thermometer is often wound on a crossed mica former and enclosed in a pyrx 
tube. The tube may be evacuated or filled with an inert gas to protect the 
metal wire. Care is to be taken to ensure that the resistance wire is free from 
mechanical stresses. A metal that has been strained will suffer a change in the 
resistance characteristic; the metal is therefore usually annealed at a tempera­
ture higher than that at which it is to operate.
Leads are taken out of the thermometer for the measurement of 
changes in resistance in order to determine the value of temperature. The 
change in resistance is usually measured by a wheat stone bridge which 
may be used either in the null (balanced) condition or in the deflection 
out of balance condition. For steady-state measurement, null conditions 
suffice whereas transient conditions usually require the use of the deflec­
tion mode.
A metal used for the fab­
rication of sensing elements is 
required to satisfy the follow­
ing characteristics:
• • Linearity of resistance— 
temperature relationship 
for convenience in 
measurement.
• • Relatively large change in 
resistance with tempera­
ture in order to produce 
a resistance thermometer 
with good sensitivity.
FIGURE 7.32 Resistance thermometers.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 357
• • No change of phase or state within a reasonable temperature change.
• • Resistant to corrosion and absorption under conditions of use.
• • Availability in a reproducible condition, that is, consistent resistance— 
temperature relationship to provide reliable uniformity.
• • High resistivity so that the unit can be fabricated in a compact and con­
venient size.
Industrial resistance thermometers, often referred to as resistance­
temperature detectors are usually made with elements of platinum (which 
shows little vocalization below 1000°C), nickel (up to 600°C), and copper (up 
to 250°C). For precise temperature measurements, platinum is preferred 
because it is physically stable (i.e., relatively indifferent to its environment, 
resists corrosion and chemical attack, and is not readily oxidized) and has high 
electrical resistance characteristics. It is stated that with careful and in scien­
tific hands, the accuracy attainable with a platinum resistance thermometer is 
of the order of ±0.01°C up to 500°C, and with ±0.1°C up to 1200°C. Because 
of accuracy, stability, and sensitivity, the platinum resistance thermometer has 
been used to define international temperature scale from the boiling point of 
oxygen (-182.9°C) to the freezing point of antimony (630.5°C).
Thermistors
Thermistor is a contraction of the term “Thermal Resistor.” They are essen­
tially semiconductors that behave as resistors with a high negative tempera­
ture coefficient. As the temperature increases, the resistance goes down, and 
as the temperature decreases, the resistance goes up. This is just opposite to 
the effect of temperature changes on metals. A high sensitivity to temperature 
changes (decrease in resistance as much as 6% for each 1°C rise in tempera­
ture in some cases) makes the thermistors extremely useful for precision tem­
perature measurement, control, and compensation in the temperature range 
of -100°C to 300°C.
Thermistors are com-
posed of sintered mixture 
of metallic oxides such 
as manganese, nickel, 
cobalt, copper, iron, and 
uranium. These metallic 
oxides are milled, mixed 
in appropriate propor­
tions, are pressed into 
the desired shape with 
FIGURE 7.33 Typical thermistor forms.
appropriate binders and

358 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
finally sintered. The electrical terminals are either embedded before sinter­
ing or backed afterward. The electrical characteristics of thermistors are con­
trolled by varying the type of oxide used and physical size and configuration 
of the thermistor. Thermistors may be shaped in the form of beads, disks, 
washers, rods and these standard forms are shown in Figure 7.33. Disks and 
rods are used more as time delay elements, temperature compensators, and 
for voltage and power control in electrical circuits. Glass and metal probes less 
than 2 mm diameter are used for temperature measurements metal surface, 
gases, and liquids.
Thermistors may be used bare but are usually glass coated or positioned 
under a thin metal cap. The change in resistance is measured by using cir­
cuitry similar to that of metal conductors.
7.8.5. Pyrometers
Total Radiation Pyrometers
The total radiation pyrometer is designed to collect the radiations from the 
radiating object (furnace) and focus it by means of mirrors or lenses onto 
a detector (say hot junction of a thermocouple). The emf developed by the 
thermocouple circuit is measured by a suitable milli-voltmeter or potentiom­
eter, which after suitable calibration becomes a measure of the temperature 
of the radiating object. Figure 7.34 is a schematic drawing of typical radiation 
pyrometers.
Pyrometer consists of a blackened tube T open at one end to receive radi­
ations from the object whose temperature is desired. The other end of the 
tube carries the sighting hole E which is essentially an adjustable eyepiece. 
The thermal radiations

mirror M whose posi­
tion can be adjusted 
by a rack and pinion. 
The mirror is centrally 
pierced to allow light 
to reach the eyepiece. 
The mirror provides 
maximum reflection of 
the incoming radiations 
onto a thermocouple C 
which is shielded from 
the incoming radiations 
and carries a blackened

copper target disk. There are two small semicircular flat mirrors that are 
inclined at a slight angle from the vertical plane. The resulting hole is smaller 
than the target and this allows radiation from the concave mirror to reach the 
thermocouple. The eyepiece and the concave mirror are adjusted to focus the 
radiation from the furnace onto the target. Small mirrors help in the focus­
ing process. These mirrors appear as shown at (i) when the radiation is not 
focused onto the target and when focusing is achieved they appear as at (ii).
The object of directing radiations from the measured surface onto the 
temperature sensing element can also be achieved by a parabolic reflector 
[Figure 7.34(b)], or by a lens system [Figure 7.34(c)].
Characteristic of radiation pyrometers
1. High speed of response (0.01-0.02 min; fast response is due to small ther­
mal capacitance of the detector. Accuracy ±2% of the scale range.
2. No direct contact is necessary with the object whose temperature is to be 
measured. This fact allows its use in situations where it is impossible or 
undesirable to bring the measuring instrument in contact with the object 
under consideration.
3. Primarily used to measure temperatures in the range 700-2000°C where 
thermocouple and resistance thermometers cannot be employed.
4. Capable of measuring the temperature of an object which may be either 
stationary or moving, and so adaptable to continuous industrial processing.
5. Suitable for measuring temperatures where the atmospheric or other 
environmental conditions prevent satisfactory operation of other temper­
ature sensing devices.
6. Relatively independent of the distance between the measuring element 
and the heated body. However, for optimum working the distance from 
target to receiver should not be greater than 10 or 20 times the maximum 
useful diameter of the target. Further, with an increase in the distance, 
there will be greater opportunity for gases, smoke, etc., to intervene and 
absorb some of the radiant energy. This would tend to reduce the indi­
cated temperature.
7. The effect of dust and dirt on the mirrors or lens is to cause the instru­
ment to read too low.
8. Cooling is required to protect the instrument from overheating where the 
temperature may be high because of operating conditions.

Optical Pyrometers
A metallic surface is usually dark and dull-colored at room temperature. 
When the surface is heated, it emits radiations of different wavelengths; these
radiations are, however, not
visible at low temperatures. 
As the temperature is pro­
gressively increased beyond 
540°C, the surface becomes 
dark red, orange, and finally 
white in color. A color vari­
ation with temperature 
growth may thus be taken 
as an index of the probable 
temperature.
This principle of tem­
perature measurement by 
color or brightness compari-

son is utilized in optical pyrometers designed to measure temperatures in the 
range 700-3000°C. These pyrometers compare the energy emitted by a body 
at a given wavelength with that of a black body calibrated lamp. A sketch of 
one of the several types of optical pyrometers is shown in Figure 7.35.
Radiations from the target surface are focused by an objective lens (L)
upon the plane filament (F) of an incandescent electric light bulb. The eye 
price (E) is also adjusted until the filament is in sharp focus and under these 
conditions, the filament is seen superimposed on the image of the target 
surface. A red filter (R) is placed between the eyepiece and filament, and it 
allows only a narrow band of wavelength 0.65 m to pass through it. Matching 
the brightness of the lamp filament with that of the target surface is achieved 
by adjusting the current through the standard lamp by changing the value of 
circuit resistance. The variable resistance or the magnitude of milliammeter 
reading (a measure of current through the lamp) may then be calibrated in 
terms of the target temperature.
When the filament is indistinguishable, in terms of brightness, from the 
image of the target surface, then it is radiating at the same intensity as the tar­
get surface. Three different conditions of the filament as sighted through the 
eyepiece are also shown in Figure 7.35. When the filament is colder than the 
target surface, it appears as a dark wire against a light-colored background. 
Filament brightness is then increased by causing more current to pass through 
the filament. A filament hotter than the object would appear brighter than the 
target surface. The current through the filament is then reduced to provide 
the correct merging of the filament and the object.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 361
In an alternative approach, the current through the lamp filament is 
maintained constant. An optical wedge of absorbing material is moved up 
and down and its variable thickness accentuates the incoming energy to 
match the filament. The wedge position is then calibrated for temperature. 
The pyrometer is calibrated by sighting it upon a black body at various known 
temperatures.
The notable characteristics of an optical pyrometer are:
1. No direct contact is necessary with the object whose temperature is to be 
measured. This aspect allows their use in situations where the measuring tar­
get is remote and inaccessible such as molten metals, furnace interiors, etc.
2. Excellent accuracy; the temperature in the useful operating range (700­
1000°C) can be determined within ±5°C.
3. Measurement is independent of the distance between the target and the 
measuring instrument. The image of the target, however, should be suffi­
ciently large to make it possible to secure a definite brightness match with 
the filament of the test spot.
4. The skill in operating the thermometer can be acquired readily. However, 
the skill of the operator has more effect upon the resulting temperature 
measurements when an optical pyrometer is used than when a radiation 
pyrometer is used.
5. Because of its manual null-balance operation, this pyrometer is not suit­
able for continuous recording or automatic control applications.
6. The lower measuring temperature is limited to 700°C. Below this tem­
perature, the eye is insensitive to wavelength characteristics.
7.9. STRAIN MEASUREMENT
A strain gauge is a device for measuring dimensional change on the surface of 
a structural member under test. Measurement of strain is indispensable in a 
variety of applications due to the utility of strain measurement as a means of 
determining maximum stress values or in specialized transducers to measure 
force, pressure, accelerations, torque, etc.
The operation of an electrical resistance strain gauge is based on the fact 
that when a conductor is subjected to mechanical deformation, its length and 
diameter are altered and a change in its resistance occurs. The resistance 
change is measured by the Wheatstone bridge circuit and correlated to strain

material, the following correlation is applicable.

It is to be noted that
i. 
For most metals m = 0.3, and as such the guage factor has a value of around 
1.6.
ii. For any given value of resistance R for the gauge element and strain, the 
change in resistance varies directly with the gauge factor.
iii. A high gauge factor is desirable because that would give a large change in 
resistance for a given strain input, thereby needing a less sensitive circuit 
for measuring the change in resistance.
Commercial solid strain gauges using doped crystal structures (semicon­
ductors) have gauge factors from 100 to 5000. These gauges are becoming 
very popular in a modern instrumentation system.
7.10. FORCE MEASUREMENT
A measure of the unknown force may be accomplished by the methods incor­
porating the following principles:
i. 
Balancing the force against a known gravitational force on a standard mass 
(scales end balances).
ii. Translating the force to a fluid pressure and then measuring the resulting 
pressure (hydraulic and pneumatic load cells).
iii. Applying the force to some elastic member and then measuring the result­
ing deflection (proving ring).
iv. Applying the force to a known mass and then measuring the resulting 
acceleration.
v. Balancing the force against a magnetic force developed by interaction of 
a magnet and a current-carrying coil.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 363
Scales and Balances
Force or weight is indicated by making a comparison between the force due 
to gravity acting on a standard mass and the force due to gravity acting on the 
unknown mass.
An equal-arm beam balance (Figure 7.36) 
consists of a beam pivoted on a knife-edge 
fulcrum at the center. Attached to the center 
of the beam is a pointer that points vertically 
downwards when the beam is in equilib­
rium. The equilibrium conditions exist when 
the clockwise rotating moment equals the 
counterclockwise rotating moment, that is, 
m1l1 = m2l2. Since the two arms of the beam 
are equal; the beam would be in equilibrium 
again when m1 = m2. Further for a given 
location, the earth’s attraction acts equally 
on both the masses and therefore at the

The pendulum scale (Figure 7.37) is 
a self-balancing and direct reading force 
measuring device of multiple lever tape. 
The weights are however mounted on 
bent levers, and the movement of the 
pendulum levers is magnified and trans­
mitted to the indicator pointer.
When the unknown pull P is applied 
to the load rod, sectors tend to rotate 
due to unwinding of the loading tapes 
and consequently the counterweights

are attained when the counterweight

ment of the equalizer bar is converted to indicator movement by a rack and 
pinion arrangement. An electrical signal proportional to the force can also 
be obtained by incorporating an angular displacement transducer that would 
measure the angular displacement 0.

Elastic-Force Meters
These force measuring units measure the force by applying it to an elastic ele­
ment and then measuring the elastic deformation. Within elastic range of the 
materials, the deflection of the element is exactly or nearly proportional to the 
force. Figure 7.38 illustrates the shapes of the more common elastic members 
used for force estimation.

The proving (stress) ring is a ring of known physical dimensions and 
mechanical properties. When an external compressive or tensile load is
applied to the lugs or external bosses, the ring changes in its diameter; the 
change being proportional to the applied force. The amount of ring deflection 
is measured by means of a micrometer screw and a vibrating reed which are 
attached to the internal bosses. During use the micrometer tip is advanced 
and its contact with the reed is indicated by considerable damping of the reed 
vibration. The difference in the micrometer reading taken before and after 
the application of load is the measure of the amount of the elongation or com­
pression of the ring. The proving ring deflection can also be picked by LVDT, 
resulting in a proportional voltage change. The device gives precise results 
when properly calibrated and corrected for temperature variations.
Instead of deflection, strain in an elastic member may be measured by a 
strain gauge, and then correlated to the applied force.

The term “load cell” is used to describe 
a variety of force transducers which may 
utilize the deflection or strain of elas­
tic member, or the increase in pressure 
of enclosed fluids. The resulting fluid 
pressure is transmitted to some form 
of pressure sensing device such as a 
manometer or a bourdon tube pressure 
gauge. The gauge reading is identified 
and calibrated in units of force.
In a hydraulic load cell (Figure 
7.40) the force variable is impressed 
upon a diaphragm which deflects and 
thereby transmits the force to a liquid. 
The liquid medium, contained in a 
confined space, has a preload pressure
FIGURE 7.39 Proving ring.
of the order of 2 bar. Application of force increases the liquid pressure; it 
equals the force magnitude divided by the effective area of the diaphragm. 
The pressure is transmitted to and read on an accurate pressure gauge 
calibrated directly in force units. The system has a good dynamic response; 
the diaphram deflection being less than 0.05 mm under full load. This is
because diaphragm has a low modulus and substantially all the force is 
transmitted to the liquid. These cells have been used to measure loads 
up to about 25 x 105 N with an accuracy of the order of 0.1% of full scale; 
resolution is about 0.02%.
FIGURE 7.40 Hydraulic load cell.
FIGURE 7.41 Pneumatic load cell.

366 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
A pneumatic load cell (Figure 7.41), operates on the force-balance 
principle and employs a nozzle-flapper transducer similar to the conventional 
relay system. A variable downward force is balanced by an upward force of 
air pressure against the effective area of a diaphragm. Application of force 
causes the flapper to come closer to the nozzle, and the diaphragm to deflect 
downwards. The nozzle opening is nearly shut off and this results in increased 
backpressure in the system. The increased pressure acts on the diaphragm 
produces an effective upward force that tends to return the diaphragm to its 
preload position. For any constant applied force, the system attains equilib­
rium at a specified nozzle opening and a corresponding pressure is indicated 
by the height of the mercury column in a manometer. Since the maximum 
pressure in the system is limited to the air supply pressure, the range of the 
unit can be extended only by using a larger diameter diaphragm. The com­
mercially available load cells operating on this principle can measure loads up 
to 25 x 105 N with an accuracy of 0.5% of full scale. The air consumption is of 
the order of 0.17 m3/h of free air.
Load
FIGURE 7.42 Strain gauge load cell.
The strain gauge load cells convert weight or force into electrical out­
puts which are provided by the strain gauges; these outputs can be connected 
to various measuring instruments for indicating, recording, and controlling 
the weight or force.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 367
A simple load cell consists of a steel cylinder which has four identical 
strain gauges mounted upon it; the gauges R1 and R4 are along the direction of 
applied load and the gauges R2 and R3 are attached circumferentially at right 
angles to gauges R1 and R2. These four gauges are connected electrically to 
the four limbs of a Wheatstone bridge circuit.
The output voltage or the change in output voltage due to applied load is 
given by
7 
, 
J dR V ^
dVo = 2(1 + m) I — = ^- I
where R is the resistance of each gauge, m is the Poisson’s ratio and Vs is the 
supply voltage.
Apparently, the output voltage is a measure of the applied load.
The strain gauge load cells are excellent force measuring devices, partic­
ularly when the force is not steady. They are generally stable, accurate and 
find extensive use in industrial applications such as drawbar and tool-force 
dynamometers, crane load monitoring, road vehicle weighing devices, etc.
7.11. TORQUE MEASUREMENT (TORSION METERS)
Measurement of torque may be necessitated for its own sake or as a part of 
power measurement for a rotating shaft.
In a gravity balance method (Figure 7.43), the known mass (m) is 
moved along the arm so that the value of torque (F x r) equals the product (T) 
which is to be measured. Alternatively magnitude of the mass may be varied, 
keeping the radius constant. For the two arrangements we have:
r a T (m and g are constant) 
m a T (r and g are constant)
Torque transmission through a shaft 
usually involves a power source, a power 
transmitter (shaft), and a power sink (also 
called the power absorber or dissipator). 
Torque measurement is accomplished by 
mounting either the source or the sink in 
bearing and measuring the reaction force 
F and the arm length L (Figure 7.44). This 
concept of bearing mounting is called cra­
dling and this forms the basis of most shaft 
power dynamometers.
FIGURE 7.43 Gravity balance for torque 
measurement.

368 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 7.44 Torque measurement of rotating machines.
Further, it may be recalled that the following relation holds good for the 
angular deflection of a shaft subjected to torque within elastic limits:
T = fj.=C°
Ip 
r l
where T is the torque transmitted by the shaft, Ip is the polar moment of iner­
tia of the shaft section, fs is the maximum induced shear stress at the outside 
surface, r is the maximum radius at which the maximum shear stress occurs, 
C is the modulus of rigidity of the shaft material, 0 is the angular twist, and l 
is the length of the shaft over which the twist is measured.
The shaft-twisting relation gives:
T = (Ip /1) x fs,, that is, T = constant x f
and
T = (Ip C/l) x 0, that is, T = constant x 0
Thus, torque for any given system 
can be calculated by measuring either 
the angle of twist or maximum shear 
stress.
Figure 7.45 shows the schematics of 
a mechanical torsion bar wherein angular 
deflection of a parallel length of the shaft 
is used to measure torque. The angular 
twist over a fixed length of the bar is 
observed on a calibrated disk (attached 
to the rotating shaft) by using the strobo­
scopic effect of intermittent viewing and 
FIGURE 7.45 Mechanical torsion meter.

Measurement and Instrumentation • 369
the persistence of vision. The system gives a varying angle of twist between 
the driving engine and the driven load as the torque changes.
Optical Torsion Meter
The meter uses an optical method to detect the angular twist of a rotating 
shaft.
The unit comprises two castings A and B which are fitted to the shaft at a 
known distance apart. These castings are attached to each other by a tension 
strip C which transmits torsion but has little resistance to bending. When the 
shaft is transmitting a torque, there occurs a relative movement between the 
castings which results in partial inclination between the two mirrors attached 
to the castings. The mirrors are made to reflect a light beam onto a graduated 
scale; angular deflection of the light ray is then proportional to the twist of, 
and hence the torque in the shaft.
FIGURE 7.46 Optical torsion meter.
For constant torque measurements from a steam turbine, the two mirrors 
are arranged back to back and there occurs a reflection from each mirror 
during every half revolution. A second system of mirrors giving four reflec­
tions per revolution is desirable when used with a reciprocating engine whose 
torque varies during a revolution.
Electrical Torsion Meter
A system using two magnetic 
or photoelectric transducers, as 
shown in Figure 7.47, involves 
two sets of measurements.

either slotted wheel. This 
count gives the frequency or

FIGURE 7.47 Electrical torsion meter.

370 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
ii. A measure of the time between pulses from the two wheels. This signal is 
proportional to the twist 0 of, and hence torque T in the shaft.
These two signals, T and co. can be combined to estimate the power being 
transmitted by the shaft.
Strain Gauge Torsion Meter
A general configuration of a strain gauge bridge circuit widely employed for 
torque measurement from a rotating shaft is shown in Figure 7.48.
FIGURE 7.48 Strain gauge torsion meter.
Four bonded-wire strain gauges are mounted on a 45° helix with the axis 
of the rotation, and are placed in pairs diametrically opposite. If the gauges are 
accurately placed and have matched characteristics, the system is temperature 
compensated and insensitive to bending and thrust or pull effects. Any change 
in the gauge circuit then results only from torsional deflection. When the shaft is 
under torsion, gauges 1 and 4 will elongate as a result of the tensile component of 
pure shear stress on one diagonal axis, while gauges 2 and 3 will contract owing to 
compressive components on the other diagonal axis. These tensile and compres­
sive principle strains can be measured, and the shaft torque can be calculated.
The main problem of the system is carrying connections from the strain 
gauges (mounted on the rotating shaft) to a bridge circuit which is stationary. 
For slow shaft rotations, the connecting wires are simply wrapped around the 
shaft. For continuous and fast shaft rotations, leads from the four junctions 
of the gauges are led along the shaft to the slip rings. Contact with the slip 
rings is made with the brushes through which connections can be made to the 
measuring instrument.
7.12. INTERCHANGEABILITY: LIMITS, FITS, AND
TOLERANCES
In the design and manufacture of engineering products, attention is paid to be 
mating, assembly, and fitting of various components. The term interchange­
ability implies that the parts which go into the assembly can be selected at 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 371
random from a large number erf identical parts that have been manufactured 
within the prescribed limits of dimensions. Then the selective fitting becomes 
unnecessary except when special allowances are encountered.
The dimension obtained by calculations for strength is known as basic 
size, basic dimension, or nominal dimension. The actual size of the actual 
dimension refers to the dimension as measured of a manufactured part. The 
algebraic difference between the actual size and the corresponding basic size 
is known as deviation.
Maximum (high) limit and minimum (low) limit are the dimensions with 
which the actual size of a part may vary.
i. 
upper deviation: Algebraic difference between the maximum limit of size 
and the corresponding basic size.
ii. lower deviation: Algebraic difference between the minimum limit of size 
and the corresponding basic size.
The terms “basic size,” “deviations,” and “tolerances” have been illus­
trated in Figure 7.49.
The degree of tightness or looseness between the two mating parts 
is known as the fit of the system. The two bases of limit size are the shaft 
basis system and the hole basis system. The term “shaft” refers to any external 
dimension of the component, and the term “hole” defines an internal dimen­
sion of the component.
In the shaft basis system, the size of the shaft is kept constant and the 
different fits are obtained by varying the hole size. The minimum limit of the
FIGURE 7.49.

372 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
shaft is the basic size and the upper 
deviation is zero. Figure 7.50 shows 
the representation of the basic shaft 
system.
In the hole basic system, the size 
of the hole is kept constant and dif­
ferent fits are obtained by varying 
the shaft size. The minimum limit of
the hole size is the basic size and the
FIGURE 7.50.
FIGURE 7.51.
lower deviation is zero. Figure 7.51 
shows the representation of the 
basic hole system.
According to IS specifications, 
there are 18 grades of fundamental 
tolerance, that is, grades of accuracy 
manufacture and 25 types of fun­
damental deviations. These devia­
tions for holes are represented by 
capital letters A to ZC and for shaft 
by small letters a to zc.
The 18 grades of tolerances are
designated by IT 01, IT 0, IT 1 to IT 16.
From the production point of view, the basic hole system is economical 
and is preferred because a single drill or reamer of fixed size can produce 
a variety of fits by merely altering the shaft limits. Shafts are comparatively 
much easier to be accurately produced to size by turning and grinding. The 
shaft basic system is, however, used in industries where semifinished shafts 
are used as raw material.
The nature of fit is characterized by the size of clearance and interfer­
ence. The term “clearance,” refers to the difference between the sizes of a 
hole and a shaft which are assembled together when the shaft is smaller than 
the hole. In a situation where the shaft is larger than the hole, the difference 
between the sizes of a hole and a shaft is called interference.
A clearance fit (Figure 7.52) is one having limits of size so prescribed 
that a clearance always results when mating parts are assembled. The shaft is 
always smaller than the hole into which it fits. Clearance is the positive differ­
ence between the size of the hole and the shaft.
Typical applications of clearance fit are on rotating shafts, loose pulleys, 
bearings, cross-head sliders, etc.
An interference fit (Figure 7.53) is one having limits of size so prescribed 
that an interference always results when the mating parts are assembled. The 

Measurement and Instrumentation • 373
shaft is always bigger than the hole into 
which it fits. Interference is the negative 
difference between the sizes of the hole 
and the shaft. Typical applications of the 
interference fit are crankpins, shrunk-on- 
couplings, iron types, railways wheels 
shrunk onto axles, pressed-in-bushes, etc.
A transition fit (Figure 7.54) is one 
having limits of sizes so prescribed that 
either a clearance or interference may 
result when mating parts are assembled. 
The shaft may be bigger, smaller, or of 
the same size as the hole into which it fits. 
Shaft
Typical applications of the transition 
fit are on bushes, spigots, fasteners, pins, 
keys, etc.
The tolerance or the error permitted in 
manufacturing a component of a specified 
dimension may be allowed to vary either 
on one side of the basic size or on either 
FIGURE 7.52.
side of the basic size. In the unilateral 
system, tolerance is applied only in one 
direction, and it may be written as
2.500 + 0.001 - 0.000 or 2.500+00.000010 
-.
In the bilateral system, the toler­
ance is allowed on both sides of the
nominal size, and it is written as
FIGURE 7.54.
20.00 + 0.02 - 0.01 or 20.00+-00..0021
Here 0.02 represents the upper limit and -0.01 represents the lower limit.

CHAPTER 8
Control Systems
8.1. CONTROL SYSTEM: WHAT IS IT?
A system is an assemblage of devices and components connected or related 
by some form of regular interaction or interdependence to form an organ­
ized whole and perform specified tasks. The system produces an output cor­
responding to a given input. The thermometer and the mass-spring-damper 
system can be identified as systems.
FIGURE 8.1. Systems comprising a thermometer and spring-mass
The thermometer has the input x = 0 (temperature) and the output y = l 
(length of the mercury column in the capillary). In the mass-spring arrange­
ment, the force and the position of the mass constitute the input to and output 
from the system, respectively. In a rotational generator of electricity, the input 
would be the rotational speed of the prime-mover shaft and the output would 
either be the induced voltage at the terminals (with no load attached to the 
generator) or the unit of electrical power (with load attached to the generator).
The term control implies to regulate, direct, or command. A control sys­
tem may thus be defined as:

380 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
i. 
means by which a set of variable quantities is field constant or caused to 
vary in a prescribed way, and
ii. an assemblage of devices and components connected or related so as to 
command, direct or regulate itself or another system.
In a control system, deliberate guidance or manipulation is employed to 
maintain a system variable at a set point or to change it according to a preset 
program.
Control systems are intimately related to the concept of automation but 
have an ancient history. Romans maintained water levels in aqueducts by 
means of floating balls that opened and closed the valves at appropriate lev­
els. Watt’s flyball governor (1769) regulated steam flow to a steam engine to 
maintain constant engine speed despite a changing load. In World War II, 
control system theory was applied to anti-aircraft batteries and fire-control 
systems. The introduction of analog and digital computers has opened the way 
for much greater complexity in automatic control theory.
8.2. EXAMPLES OF CONTROL SYSTEMS
Illustrated below are some examples of control systems:
i. 
An electric switch that serves to control the flow of electricity in a circuit. 
The input signal (command) is the flipping of the switch on or off, and the 
corresponding output (controlled) signal is the flow or non-flow of electric 
current.
ii. A thermal system where it is desired to maintain the temperature of hot 
water at a prescribed value.
Thermometer
(a) Electrical on-off system
(b) Thermal system: manual feedback control
FIGURE 8.2. An electric switch and a thermal control system

Control Systems • 381
Before the operator can carry out this task satisfactorily, the following 
requirements must be met:
a. The operator must be told what temperature is required for the water. 
This temperature called the set point or desired value constitutes the 
input to the system.
b. The operator must be provided with some means of observing the tem­
perature (sensing element). For that, a thermometer is installed in the 
hot water pipe and it measures the actual temperature of the water. This 
temperature is output from the system and is called the controlled 
variable. The operator watches the thermometer and compares how 
the measured temperature compares with the desired value. This differ­
ence between the desired value and the actual measurement value is an 
error or actuating signal:
e = r - c
where r refers to the set point or reference input and c denotes the controlled 
variable.
c. The operator must be provided with some means of influencing the 
temperature (control element) and must be instructed what to do to 
change the temperature in the desired direction (control function).
The sign of the error signal e indicates whether the controlled tempera­
ture is too high or too low, and this determines the direction of the corrective 
action required: whether to open up the valve or close it down. The size of the 
error signal determines the amount of correction action necessary. When the 
valve is turned in the correct direction by the correct amount the water will 
acquire the desired temperature value.
Hence the operator has been able to reduce the error signal to a mini­
mum by changing the steam supply to water. The flow of steam constitutes 
the manipulated variable.
iii. 
A driving system of an automobile (accelerator, carburettor, and an engine 
vehicle) where command signal is the force on the acceleration pedal and 
the automobile is the controlled variable. The desired change in engine 
speed can be obtained by controlling pressure on the accelerator pedal.
FIGURE 8.2. (c) Driving system of an automobile

382 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
iv. An automobile steering system where the driver is required to keep the 
automobile in the appropriate lane of the roadways. The eyes measure the 
output (heading of the automobile), the brain and hands react to any error 
existing between the input (applied lane) and the output signals and act to 
reduce the error to zero.
FIGURE 8.2. (d) Automobile steering system
v. A biological control system where a person moves his finger to point at an 
object. The command signal is the position of the object and the output is 
the pointed direction.
FIGURE 8.2. (e) Biological control system: a person pointing toward an object
Other well-known examples of control systems are electric frying pans, 
water pressure regulators, toilet-tank water levels, electric irons, refrigerators, 
and household furnaces with thermostatic control.
8.3. CLASSIFICATION OF CONTROL SYSTEMS
There are two basic types of control systems, open-loop, and closed-loop 
systems
8.3.1 Open-loop system (unmonitored control system)
The main features of an open-loop system are:
1. There is no comparison between the actual (controlled) and the desired 
values of a variable.

Control Systems • 383
2. For each reference input, there corresponds to a fixed operating condi­
tion (output) and this output has no effect on the control action, that is, 
the control action is independent of output.
3. For the given set-input, there may be a big variation of the controlled vari­
able depending upon the ambient conditions.
Since there is no comparison between actual output and the desired 
value, rapid changes can occur in the output if there occurs any change in the 
external load.
Some examples of open-loop systems are:
i. 
Trying to guide a car by setting the steering wheel, together with a pat­
tern of subsequent changes of direction, at the beginning of a journey 
and making no alteration enroute as and when the car deviates from the 
desired path.
ii 
. Hitting the golf ball where the player knows his goal to get the ball into 
a particular hole. To achieve it, the player hits the ball correctly at the 
beginning of its flight. Once the moment of impact is passed, he loses his 
control on any further flight of the ball.
iii 
. A washing machine in which soaking, washing, and rinsing operations are 
carried out on a time basis. The machine does not measure the output 
signal, viz., the cleanliness of the clothes.
iv. An automatic toaster where the toasting time and temperature are preset 
quantities. The quality of the toast (darkness or lightness) is determined 
by the user and not by the toaster.
v. The automobile traffic control signals at roadways intersections are the 
open-loop systems. The red and green light times (input to the control 
action) are predetermined by a calibrated timing mechanism and are in 
no way influenced by the traffic (output).
The control systems depicted in Figure 8.2(a) and (c) are also the open-loop 
control system. In the electric switch control system, the flipping of the switch 
is independent of the flow of electric current through the circuit. Likewise, in 
the driving of the automobile, no correspondence is shown between the vehicle 
speed (controlled variable) and the force (command signal) on the pedal.
From the illustrations cited above, it may be noted that any control system 
which operates on a time basis is an open-loop system.

384 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
An open-loop system has the following advantages and limitations:
• • simple construction and ease of maintenance,
• • no stability problems,
• • convenient when the controlled variable is either difficult to measure or it 
is economically not feasible,
• • system affected by internal and external disturbances; the output may 
deviate from the desired value, and
• • needs frequent and careful calibrations for an accurate result.
8.3.2. Closed-loop system (monitored control system)
The main features of the closed-loop system are:
1. There is a comparison between the actual (controlled) and the desired 
value of the variable. To accomplish it, the output signal is fed back and 
the loop is completed.
2. The error signal (deviation between the reference input and the feed­
back) actuates the control element to minimize the error and bring the 
system output to the desired valve.
3. The system operation is continually correcting any error that may exist. 
As the output does not coincide with the desired goal, there is likely to be 
some kind of error signal.
Evidently, the closed-loop systems correct the drift of the output away 
from the goal, which may be due to external disturbance or due to deteriora­
tion of the system.
Common phrases used to describe closed-loop are the feedback control 
or the monitored and automatic control systems. The performance of such a 
system is evaluated with reference to the following desirable characteristics:
• • minimum deviation following a disturbance,
• • minimum time interval before return to setpoint, and
• • minimum offset due to change in operating conditions.
Examples of closed-loop systems are:
i. 
The control of the thermal system (Figure 8.2 b) is a closed-loop system. 
When the operator detects that the output temperature is different from 
the desired or reference, he initiates an action to reduce the discrepancy 
by operating a valve that controls the steam supply to water.
ii. The automobile driving system (Figure 8.2 c) would become a closed- 
loop system when the driver makes a visual observation of the speed

indicated by a speedometer and compares this mentally with the desired 
speed.
Based on the deviation between the actual and the desired speed values, 
the driver would take the decision either to increase or decrease the speed. The 
decision is implemented by affecting a change in the pressure of his foot on 
the accelerator pedal. The driver’s eye and the brain act as the error detectors.

iii. The traffic control system at a roadway intersection is a closed-loop sys­
tem when the traffic policeman allows a greater time interval to cope with 
a greater traffic volume coming from a particular direction.
The closed-loop systems listed above involve continuous manual control 
by human operators and are classified as manual feedback or manual closed- 
loop systems. In the many complex and fast-moving systems, the dull and 
time-consuming manual tasks are accomplished by incorporating in the sys­
tem some equipment that would perform the desired functions more rapidly 
and consistently. A closed-loop system operating without human is called an 
automatic control system.
Examples of automatic control systems
i. 
In the automatic feedback control of a thermal system (Figure 8.4 a), the 
human operator has been replaced by an automatic controller. The actual 
temperature of the hot water is measured by a thermometer and is fed 
to the controller for comparison with the reference temperature whose 
value has been specified by an appropriate setting of the thermostat/regu- 
lator. Based on the error signal, the controller generates an output (cor­
recting signal) which is taken to the control valve in order to change the 
valve opening for the steam supply.
ii. The level control system depicted in Figure 8.4(b) is an automatic control 
system where the inflow of water to the tank is dependent on the water 
level in the tank. The automatic controller maintains the liquid level by 
comparing the actual level with the desired level correcting any error by 
adjusting the opening of the control valve.

iii. A pressure control system where the pressure inside the furnace is auto­
matically tolled by adjusting the opening of the control valve (Figure 8.4 d).
iv. The anti-aircraft radar tracking system (Figure 8.4 e) incorporates a rotat­
ing antenna that senses the presence of the target plane. The detected 
signal (velocity and position) of the plane is transmitted to the computer 
which determines the firing angle. The firing angle then becomes the 
command signal which is passed on to the firing system through the power 
amplifiers. The angular position of the gun is fed back to the computer. 
The gun is triggered when the error between the command signal and the 
firing angle becomes zero.

v. 
The automatic aircraft landing system (Figure 8.4 f ) has three basic parts, 
viz., the aircraft, the radar unit, and the controlling unit. The approximate 
vertical and lateral positions of the aircraft as measured by the radar unit are 
transmitted to the controlling unit. The controlling unit then determines 
the appropriate pitch and bank commands. These commands are later 
transmitted to the aircraft autopilots and that makes the aircraft respond.

Advantages and limitations of automatic control systems
• • suitability and desirability in the complex and fast-acting systems 
which are beyond the physical abilities of a man,
• • relief to human beings from hard physical work, boredom and drudg­
ery which normally result from a continuous repetitive job,
• • economy in the operating cost due to the elimination of the continu­
ous employment of a human operator,
• • increased output or productivity,
• • improvement in the quality and quantity of the products,
• • economy in the plant equipment, power requirement, and processing 
material. The feedback permits to initiate precise control by using 
relatively inexpensive components,
• • reduced effect of non-linearities and distortions, and
• • satisfactory response over a wide range of input frequencies.
The system has however a tendency to over-correct errors and this may 
cause oscillations of constant or changing amplitude.

8.4. CONTROL SYSTEMS TERMINOLOGY
A closed-loop consists essentially of a process, error detector, and control 
elements. The source of the terms related to these basic components are 
defined below:
Process, plant, or controlled system (g2 ): a body, process, or machine of 
which a particular quantity or condition is to be controlled, for example, a 
furnace, reactor, spacecraft, etc.
Controlled variable (c): the quality or condition (temperature, level, flow 
rate, etc.) characterizing a process whose value is held constant by the control­
ler or is changed according to a certain law.
Controlled medium: the process material in the controlled system or flow­
ing through it in which the variable is to be controlled.
Command: an input that is established or varied by some means which are 
external to and independent of the feedback control system.
Set point or reference input (r): a signal established as a standard of com­
parison for feedback control system by virtue of its relation to command. The 
setpoint either remains constant or changes with time according to a preset 
program.
Manipulated variable (m): the quality or condition that is varied as a func­
tion of the actuating signal so as to change the plant g2 by the control element g1.
Actuating signal (e): an algebraic sum of the reference input r and the pri­
mary feedback b. The actuating signal is also called the error or control action.

Control Systems • 389
Controller 
Disturbance
FIGURE 8.5. Elements of a control system
Primary feedback signal (b): a function of the controlled output c, which 
is compared with the reference input to obtain the actuating signal.
Error detector: an element that detects the feedback; essentially it is a 
summing point that gives the algebraic summation of two or more signals. The 
detection of the flow of information is indicated by arrows and the algebraic 
nature of summation by plus or minus signs.
Negative feedback occurs when the feedback signal subtracts from the 
reference signal
e = r - b
If the feedback signal adds to the reference signal, the feedback is said to 
be positive
e = r + b
Negative feedback tries to reduce the error, whereas positive feedback 
makes the error large.
Disturbance (n): an undesired variable applied to the system which tends 
to affect adversely the value of the variable being controlled. The process dis­
turbance may be due to changes in setpoint, supply, demand, environmental, 
and other associated variables.
Feedback element (h): an element of the feedback control system that 
establishes a functional relationship between the controlled variable c and the 
feedback signal b.
Control element (g2 ): an element that is required to generate the appro­
priate control signal (manipulated variable) m applied to the plant.
Forward and backward paths: The transmission path from the actuating 
signal e to the controlled output c constitutes the forward path. The backward 
path is the transmission path from the controlled output c to the primary 
feedback signal b.

8.5. SERVOMECHANISM, PROCESS CONTROL, AND
REGULATOR
A servomechanism is an automatic control system in which the controlled 
variable is mechanical position (displacement), or a time derivative of dis­
placement such as velocity and acceleration. The output is designed to follow 
a continuously changing input or desired variable (command signal). The ser­
vomechanisms are inherently fast-acting (small time lag with response time 
in the order of milliseconds) systems and usually employ electric or hydraulic 
actuation. These systems are essentially used to control the position or speed 
of a mechanism that is either too heavy or too remote to be controlled manu­
ally. The complete automation of machine tools together with programmed 
instruction is another notable example of servomechanism.
Servomechanisms find utility in satellite-tracking antennas, automatic 
navigation systems on boats and planes, and anti-aircraft gun control systems. 
Other examples are fly-by-wire systems in aircraft which use servers to actu­
ate the aircraft’s control surfaces and radio-controlled models which use RC 
servers for the same purpose. Many autofocus cameras also use a servomech­
anism to accurately move the lens and then adjust the focus. A modern hard 
disk drive has a magnetic servo system with sub-micron positioning accuracy.
Process control refers to the control of such parameters as level, flow, 
pressure, temperature, and acidity of a process variable, A particular param­
eter has usually only one optimum desired value (setpoint) and the control 
system is required to ensure that the process output is maintained at this level 
inspite of changes in external conditions (disturbances) which affect the pro­
cess. The load disturbance could be (i) a change in the boiler steam pressure 
affecting a temperature control system (ii) a change in raw materials affecting 
a mixing process. The process control systems are usually slow-acting (large 
time lags) and usually employ pneumatic actuation.
A regulator is a feedback control system in which the output (controlled 
variable) is maintained at a preset value irrespective of external load on the 
plant. The reference input or command signal, although adjustable, is held 
constant for long periods of time. The primary task is then to maintain the 
output at the desired value in the presence of disturbances (change in load 
on the system or changes in the environment or changes in the system itself). 
Examples of an automatic regulator are regulation of steam supply in steam 
engines by the fly ball governor; thermostat control of a home heating system; 
control of pressure and of electrical quantities such as voltage, current, and 
frequency.

Control Systems • 391
In general, a control system that regulates a variable in response to a fixed 
command signal is known as a regulator system whereas a control system that 
accurately follows changes in the command signal is referred to as follow-up 
system.
8.6. SEQUENCE CONTROL
Sequence control is a special type of open-loop system which has the follow­
ing main features:
i. 
the finish of one action initiates the start of the next,
ii. 
the acts take place in a certain fixed sequence, and
iii. 
there is no comparison of desired and actual value.
FIGURE 8.6. Block diagram of a sequential-control system
Figure 8.6 illustrates the block diagram of one such system involving 
mechanical handing packaging. The various actions are performed by pneu­
matic or hydraulic components and the completion of the operation is sig­
naled by mechanical trip valves.
The cloth-washing machine too is a sequence control where the various 
operations, such as
a. filling of the tub 
b. washing 
c. draining the tub
d. rinsing and 
e. spin-drying is controlled by timer switch
Likewise, the sequence of operations on a production machine may be
i. 
job in position 
ii. guard in position
iii. tool in position 
iv. tool motion
v. 
tool withdrawal and vi. job withdrawal
Logic control devices are used to control each of these operations.

392 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
8.7. MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS
Manual control systems involve a human operator who:
i. 
takes decision about the required output,
ii. ensures that the necessary input (the reference input) is applied to the 
system,
iii. observes the output and compares it with the desired value, and
iv. readjusts the control elements if the output is not what he wants.
In an automatic control system, the human operator determines the goal 
and sets up the system. Subsequently, the target output is achieved or main­
tained automatically. Only the reference input is provided and the necessary 
corrections are applied by mechanical (non-human) devices and that essen­
tially forms the essence of automatic control.
Automatic control has become obligatory in a wide variety of engineering 
problems as is evident from the following few examples:
• • control of temperature, pressure, humidity, viscosity, flow rate, etc., in the 
process industries like synthetic yarn production, oil refining and chemi­
cal plants,
• • control of heat treatment, tooling, handling, and assembling of mechan­
ical parts in the control of the manufacture of articles like refrigerators, 
radio, and automobile parts,
• • control of position, speed and power in machine tools, pumps and com­
pressors, electrical, and mechanical power supply units,
• • speed regulation of devices like grinding wheel for precision grinding, 
tape recorders, strip rolling, and wire drawing, and
• • transportation systems such as ship steering and rolling stabilization, air­
craft flight control, the automatic landing of aircraft, etc. The positioning 
systems, radar travel systems and other military equipment are necessarily 
based on feed control systems.
Applications of control system engineering
Some of the common applications that involve the use of control 
systems are:
1. Range of human activities in the domestic domain such as picking a book 
from the table, eating meals from the plate, pointing a finger toward an 
object, walking from a starting point to a destination along a prescribed 
path.

Control Systems • 393
2. On and off of electric supply to units such as washing machines, toasters, 
fans, air-conditioners, and other electrical appliances.
3. Speed and direction-control of transport vehicles.
4. Regulation of temperature and humidity of homes, offices, hospitals, and 
shopping malls for the comfort of human beings.
5. Control of temperature, pressure, water level and humidity, etc., in the 
process industry.
6. Quality control of manufactured products, automatic control of machine 
tools and assembly line in industry. Operation of computerized numeri­
cally controlled machines.
7. Regulation of voltage at electric power plants.
8. Space technology, missile launching, and guidance.
9. Military operations such as automatic positioning of guns, radar antennas, 
steering control of ships.
The control system engineering and its applications are not limited to 
engineering alone; it is applicable to all fields of knowledge pertaining to 
biological, biomedical, economic, and socioeconomic systems.
EXAMPLE 8. 1
Name any three electrical devices used at home and which are 
equipped with suitable controls to achieve the desired purpose. Also 
mention the control category to which they belong.
Solution: Some common electrical devices used at home are:
i. 
Radio: one can adjust the volume, the tone, the station.
ii. Television set: one can adjust the volume, the channel, and the brightness.
iii. Oven: one can adjust the temperature.
In each of these arrangements, the human operator forms a part of the 
control loop. He provides the feedback path, makes adjustments with the con­
trols and corrects for the errors so as to get the desired performance from 
the device. Evidently, these electrical devices constitute manual closed-loop 
control systems.
Electric fires and lights are open arrangements because their outputs can­
not be adjusted if they deviate from the desired goal. If the electric fire does 
not give enough heat or if the lamp is not bright enough, these have to be 
discarded and replaced with new ones.

EXAMPLE 8. 2
Identify the open-loop and closed-loop aspects of cooking.
Solution: Most of the cooking done in an oven by the novice cook is essen­
tially an open-loop because:
i. 
the quantities of the ingredients are specified by the recipe,
ii. the mixing of the ingredients is as per instructions, and
iii. the oven settings and the cooking time are also according to the 
instructions.
If every act is in accordance with the instructions listed in the cookery 
book, the meal would emerge as required. Indeed, if the cook tries to add 
a little feedback to the process by opening the oven to take a look (presum­
ably to make adjustments if things are not going right), he can make things 
worse.
However, the experienced cooks use their judgment and modify the 
open-loop instructions with feedback and achieve the required target rather 
more accurately. Using a frying pan is more of a feedback process. The quan­
tities used, the temperature of the pan, the cooking time, etc., are all adjusted 
according to how closely the output (cooked meal) approaches the target (the 
desired quality of the meal).
EXAMPLE 8. 3
Is the act of switching a light involve both manual and automatic 
controls?
Solution: The process of switching a light involves both manual and auto­
matic controls.
i. 
The act of switching a light is a normal operation and is obviously a man­
ual control. The person decides that he wants the light and accordingly 
the switch is turned on. Subsequently, the switch is turned off if the light 
is not needed.
ii. The bulb gives a predetermined brightness; this is achieved automati­
cally by exercising careful control in the manufacture of the lamp and by 
keeping the constant voltage at the mains. Thus, the lamps either give the 
intended brightness or fail completely.
The operating system at the power station ensures that mains voltage 
stays close to 240 volts except during power cuts.

EXAMPLE 8. 4
Identify the concept of plant, reference input, controlled output and 
feedback, etc., in the following control systems:
a. control of temperature in the central heating system,
b. control of water level in a cistern,
c. control of the progress of an automobile vehicle, 
d. control of water temperature for a shower bath.
Solution: a. Refer to Figure 8.7(a) for the closed-loop central heating system:
i. 
The plant refers to the room 
whose temperature is required to 
be controlled.
ii. The thermostat is set to the 
specified temperature (reference 
input) and thus controls the fuel/ 
oil input to the boiler.
iii. The controlled output is the 
actual room temperature which 
is fed back to the thermostat.
iv. The controlled element is the 
oil flow valve and the goal is the 
specified house temperature.
The thermostat switches on the oil 
flow to the boiler furnace when the room 
temperature drops below the specified 
value. This results in heat flow from die 
radiators in the room and the consequent rise in temperature, The supply of 
oil to the furnace is automatically shut off when the room temperature rises to 
the specified reference input.
b. 
Refer to Figure 8.7(b) for the control of water level in a cistern.
i. 
The plant is the tank (cistern) wherein the level of water is to be 
controlled.
ii. The reference input is prescribed by the initial setting of the ball lever.
iii. The output is the constant level of water in the tank.
FIGURE 8.7. (a) A closed-loop central 
heating system
FIGURE 8.7. (b) Control of water level in a 
cistern

396 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
iv. The control element is the pivot-ball arrangement and the feedback is 
the actual position of the floating ball.
When the ball is at a lower position (i.e., the water level is below the 
desired level), then will be the inflow of water into the cistern. With this 
inflow, the level of water would rise and with that, the ball would also rise. 
Eventually, the ball would move up to a position where the arm would cut off 
the supply of water.
c. Refer to Figure 8.3 for the control of the progress of an automobile vehicle,
i.
ii.
The plant is the automobile 
vehicle whose progress along 
a specified track is to be con­
trolled.
The input includes turning off 
the steering wheel and the pres­
sure of the foot on the accelera­
tion pedal.
FIGURE 8.7. (c) Control of water temperature 
for shower bath
iii. The engine, transmission links and steering are the control elements.
iv. The feedback loop governing the motion of the vehicle along the road 
is the driver’s observation. This feedback leads to a change in pres­
sure on the accelerator on to an adjustment of the setting of the 
steering wheel (steering correction).
d. Refer to Figure 8.7(c) which depicts a simple arrangement for the control 
of water temperature for a shower bath.
i. 
The inputs are the temperature and flow rates of hot and cold water.
ii. The plant is the pipe taking the water up to the nozzle.
iii. The output is the temperature of hot water flowing from the nozzle.
iv. The control element is the mixing tap.
v. The arms of the person taking the bath provide feedback from the 
output to the input and readjust the setting on the input side. If the 
water was too hot, he turns the mixer toward a cold position. If it was 
too cold, he would adjust the mixture toward hot. The adjustment is 
so made that difference between the actual output temperature and 
the desired output temperature is reduced to the minimum.

EXAMPLE 8.5
Draw the schematics and block diagram of a system representing a 
steam-generator set fitted with a speed governor.
Solution: Refer to Figure 8.8(a) for the schematics of a system for speed 
control of a turbo-governor.
FIGURE 8.8. (a)
The system incorporates a centrifugal governor which uses the lift of cen­
trifugal balls as speed monitor, it senses any speed change which may occur 
due to variation in load. The speed sensed by the governor is compared with 
the desired speed and an error or deviation signal is generated. A hydraulic 
amplifier serves as a controller that operates a control valve which moves by 
an amount proportional to the error. The valve then regulates the steam flow 
from the boiler to the turbine; which results in a change in speed until the 
output speed matches the desired speed.
FIGURE 8.8. (b)
The system has been represented by a block diagram with various ele­
ments as shown in Figure 8.8(b).

CHAPTER 9
Mechatronics Systems:
Basic Concepts and Applications
9.1. MECHATRONICS: WHAT IS IT?
Mechatronics ^ Mechanics + Electronics
Mechatronics is a fascinating branch of engineering science that has initially 
been a combination of mechanics and electronics. With the advancement of 
technology, Mechatronics became broad-based covering mechanical, electri­
cal, electronics, software engineering, communication, control, and artificial 
intelligence. Essentially mechatronics is
• • a broad term that integrates/unites principles of mechanics, electronics, 
and computing (frequently using microcontrollers to generate a simpler, 
economical, and reliable system).
• • the synergistic integration of mechanical engineering with electronics and 
intelligent control algorithms in the design and manufacture of products 
processes.
The term “synergistic” implies the interaction of two or more disciplines 
to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects. 
As such, a mechatronics engineer would study definitive portions of mechan­
ical engineering, electrical/electronics engineering, computer engineering, 
and control engineering.
The different fields which make up mechatronics have been indicated in 
Figure 9.1. Mechatronics is treated as a modern buzzword synonymous with

404 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
automation, robotics, and 
electromechanical sys­
tems.
The notable exam­
ples of mechatronic sys­
tems are:
• • digitally controlled 
combustion engines,
• • machine tools with
FIGURE 9.1 Constituent disciplines of a mechatronics system.
self-adaptive tools,
• • contact-free magnetic 
bearings,
• • automated guided 
vehicles, and
• • robots.
FIGURE 9.2 Components of mechatronics system.
Physically a mecha-
tronics system consists of four prime components viz., sensors, actuators, con­
trollers, and mechanical components arranged as shown in Figure 9.2.
A typical mechatronic system picks up signals from the environment, 
processes them to generate output signals, and transforms them into forces, 
motions and actions.
9.2. ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION
The term “mechatronics” was coined by Tetsure Mori and was used to describe 
a philosophy adopted in designing subsystems of electromechanical products. 
The term was a trademark of Yasakowa Electric Corporation from 1971 to 
1982. Since those early days, there have been rapid advances in technology 
available to manufacturing industries, and the term “mechatronics” is now 
firmly established and is being freely used by industries around the world.
The different stages in the evolution of the discipline/field of mechatron- 
ics have been:
1. Primary level: The primary stage is the basic control level that covers 
input/output devices. There is the integration of electrical signaling with 
mechanical action using sensors and actuators; for example, relay switches 
and electrically controlled valves.

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 405
2. Secondary level: At this stage of development, there has been the inte­
gration of microelectronics into electrically controlled devices such as in 
a cassette tape player.
The autofocus cameras and washing machines too are examples of 
such systems; often called stand-alone systems.
3. Tertiary level: The tertiary level mechatronics systems, often called 
smart systems, are of improved quality and sophistication. This results 
through the incorporation of advanced feedback functions into the con­
trol strategy that uses microelectronics, microprocessors, and other 
application-specific integrated circuits.
Industrial robots are typical examples of tertiary mechatronics sys­
tems.
4. Quaternary level: There is an attempt in the quaternary level mechatron- 
ics systems to incorporate intelligent and fault detection isolation with the 
objective of enhancing smartness. There is a linkage of major subsystems 
such as machining centers, robots for part handling, automated inspection 
centers, etc., in the large factory systems. Further, intellectual capabilities 
of the human operator are captured through the concepts of artificial neu­
ral networks and fuzzy logic. A humanoid robot is one such mechatronics 
system.
9.3. AVIONICS, BIONICS, AND AUTOTRONICS
Avionics is a variant of a mechatronics system that is coined from a blend of 
aviation and electronics. Every modern aircraft, spacecraft, and artificial sat­
ellite uses electronic systems of varying types to perform a range of functions 
pertinent to their purpose and mission. Such systems may include:
• • Engine control and flight control systems in order to reduce pilot error 
and workload at landing or take off.
• • Fuel control and monitoring system to report fuel remaining on board.
• • Navigation and communication systems. Air navigation is the determina­
tion of position and direction on or above the surface of the earth.
• • Weather and anti-collision systems. The transport aircraft uses a traf­
fic alert and collision avoidance system which can detect the location of 
nearby aircraft and provide instructions for avoiding mid-air collision. The 
weather detectors give information on lightning and turbulence.

406 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
• • Flight recorders (black boxes): These store flight information and audio 
from the cockpit. They provide information on control settings and other 
parameters when there is an unfortunate incident of a crash.
• • Display and management of systems fitted to the aircraft to perform indi­
vidual tasks.
There is also the integration of multiple functions to improve perfor­
mance, simplify maintenance, and contain costs.
Bionics is a variant of the mechatronics system that has been coined by 
Jack Steel in 1958 from the subjects of biology and electronics. This biologi­
cally inspired engineering pertains to the biological methods and systems and 
is made use of in the study and design of engineering systems. Bionics studies 
the mechanical and electronic systems that function like living organisms or 
parts of a living organism both internal and external.
Examples of bionics in engineering include:
• • hulls of boat imitating the skin of dolphins,
• • sonar, radar, and medical ultrasound imaging using sound waves and 
echoes to determine where the objects are in space. This is analogous 
to sending out sound waves (from the mouth or nose) by the bats to find 
food in the dark. When the sound waves hit the target (food), echoes are 
produced,
• • producing artificial neurons, artificial neural networks, and swarm intelli­
gence in the field of computer science,
• • making artificial hands with sensors in the fingertips that monitor and 
adjust the strength of the hand’s grip,
• • development of dirt and water repellant paints/coatings from the observa­
tion that practically nothing sticks to the surface of the lotus flower plant,
• • changing the shape of aircraft wings according to speed and duration of 
flight inspired by different bird species that have differently shaped wings 
according to the speed at which they fly,
• • creation of new nanosensors to detect explosives inspired by wing struc­
ture of butterflies,
• • development of smart clothing that adapts to changing temperatures. The 
smart fabric opens up when the weather is warm and sweating and shuts 
tight when cold. This development came from a study of pinecones (a 
type of plant), and
• • application of the ways the animals move in the design of robots.

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 407
The above examples clearly indicate that bionics treats nature itself as 
a database of solutions that already exist. Further, it will be appropriate to 
mention how the subjects of bionics, cybernetics, and bioengineering differ 
from each other.
Bionics explores new ideas for building mechanical and electronics sys­
tems. Cybernetics focuses on seeking an explanation of the behavior of living 
organisms. Bioengineering uses living things to perform industrial tasks. For 
example, using bacteria in paper batteries to supply electrical energy would 
be an advancement in bioengineering and not bionics.
Autotronics is a variant of a mechatronics system that has been coined by 
blending automobile and electronics:
automobile + electronics ^ autotronics
That makes autotronics flexible engineering that serves to develop and 
understand conversion principles in the design, construction, and working of 
mechanical systems and electronics systems combined with the advancement 
of sensors and microcontrollers. Analysts estimate that more than 80% of all 
automobile innovations now stem from electronics. Since 1970, there have 
been progressive changes in motor vehicle technology with many of the func­
tions evolving from mechanical to becoming electronics and controlled by 
computers. Due to the embedding of electronics in automobile operations, 
there has been improvement in:
• • fuel injection and engine ignition,
• • steering, transmission, and suspension,
• • antilock braking,
• • navigation and general positioning system (GPS),
• • audio and video entertainment system,
• • safety control and security alarms,
• • collision avoidance systems, and
• • autolocking system and key-less entry.
All this has made driving more comfortable, more secure and more effi­
cient, and has turned driving into a pleasurable experience.

9.4. APPLICATIONS OF MECHATRONICS
Mechatronics is one of the fastest developing fields with wide areas of appli­
cation in marketing, design, and manufacturing. Marketing refers to informa­
tion analysis related to the identification of uses needs and formulation of the 
product specification. The manufacturing domain looks into process develop­
ment, production planning, material handling, inspection, and quality control. 
The current technological designs are highly complex and requires integra­
tion of knowledge from different interdisciplinary subjects.
Mechatronics finds application in:
• • Industries where it is necessary to design and maintain automatic equip­
ment.
• • Large manufacturing units involved in high volume production. 
Automation and industrial robots perform consistently and quickly and 
that enables manufacturers to keep with demand while reducing costs.
• • Many medical applications such as magnetic resonance, ultrasonic probes, 
and arthroscopic devices are mechatronics. Surgical robots have been 
developed for eye surgery, targeting lung cancer, knee surgery, and lapa­
roscopy. Such examinations and treatments are less invasive and that leads 
to a fast recovery and low risk of infection.
• • Computer machine tools like CNC milling machines, CNC water jets, 
and CNC plasma cutters.
• • Computer-aided and integrated manufacturing systems.
• • Consumer products, industrial goods packaging.
• • Transportation and vehicular systems, automotive engineering equipment 
in the design of antilock brakes and stabilizers, and air-bag inflation. This 
has made driving safe and less accident-prone.
• • Home applications such as automatic air-conditioning systems, security 
systems, washing machines, dishwashing, etc.
• • Intelligent measuring devices like calibration, measuring, and testing of 
sensors.
• • Automatically guided and unmanned aerial vehicles.
In recent times, a greater use of mechatronics is evident in manufactur­
ing, mining, aviation, robotics, defence, and transport. Mechatronics engi­
neers may program robots, design telecommunication systems, or develop 
nanotechnology.

9.5. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
Mechatronics is basically the application of various technical fields to have 
reliable product design and manufacturing solutions. The main advantages 
resulting from mechatronics systems are:
• • enhancement of functionality and features,
• • easy design of processes and products, improved design time and product 
size,
• • rapid set up and cost-effective operation of manufacturing facilities,
• • optimizing performance and quality,
• • increased effectiveness and productivity,
• • more user-friendly and safer to use,
• • improved and less expensive controls,
• • little interference from operators, and
• • high level of integration.
There is better control of precision, position, speed, flow rate, and other 
variables due to the use of microcontrollers, software, and artificial intelli­
gence in mechatronics.
However, the mechatronics systems have the following disadvantages too
• • high initial cost,
• • complicated design, and
• • system complex and so difficult repair and maintenance.
9.6. SENSORS AND TRANSDUCERS
A generalized measurement system consists of two components, (i) sensing 
element which responds directly by reacting to the measurand and (ii) trans­
ducing element which is responsible for conversion of the measurand into the 
analog driving signal. The sensing element may also serve to transduce the 
measurand and put it into a more convenient form. The tie unit is then called 
detector-transducer.

Input stage
For instance:
• • In the ordinary dial indicator the contacting spindle acts as a detector or 
sensing element for displacement. It simply performs the function of a 
detector and nothing else.
• • The function of the bourdon tube of a pressure gauge is two-fold: firstly to 
sense the pressure and secondly to give the resulting effect or the output 
in the form of displacement. The tube then works as a detector-transducer.
• • In a compressive load cell, the platform detects the force and gives an 
output in the form of deflection. This deflection may be further con­
verted into an electrical output by-strain gauges mounted on the load cell. 
The strain gauge is called a secondary transducer because of the second 
translation.
Different types of sensors and transducers are available for the measure­
ment of one particular quantity and the choice of a suitable unit depends 
upon the static and dynamic performance characteristics.
9.7. MECHANICAL DETECTOR-TRANSDUCER ELEMENTS
Transducers make use of different principles to convert the various quantities 
being measured into their analogs. Table 9.1 provides a list of the mechanical 
detector transducers, together with the functions they perform.

9.7.1. Elastic Elements
These units are frequently employed to furnish an indication of the magnitude 
of applied pressure/force through a displacement measurement. Operation of 
the elastic elements is based on one or a combination of the following three 
acts:
i. 
compression that tends to force the molecules of the solid together,
ii. tension that tends to force the molecules farther apart, and
iii. torsion that tends to twist the solids.
A force may be determined by applying it to an elastic element and mea­
suring the resulting elastic deformation. The devices commonly used include 
springs, the proving ring, and the torsion rods.
•• In a spring-type indicating scale, unknown weight applied to the free end 
of the spring causes displacement which is indicated by the pointer. A 
tape-and-drum movement can be employed to operate the pointer.
•• The proving ring (stress ring) is a ring of known physical dimensions and 
mechanical properties. An external tensile or compressive force applied 
across the ring diameter causes distortion which is proportional to that 
force. The distortion is measured by means of a dial gauge, a sensitive 
micrometer, or a strain gauge. The proving ring is widely used as a cali­
bration standard for large tensile testing machines.
•• 
A torsion bar would twist in proportion to the applied torque and the 
resulting angular deformation can be used as a measure of the torque.
•• Most pressure measuring devices use either a bourdon tube, a bellow, or 
a diaphragm. The action of these elements is based on elastic deformation 
brought about by the force resulting from pressure summation.
9.7.2. Mass Sensing Elements
The inertia of a concentrated mass provides another mechanical detector­
transducer. The principle is employed in vibration pickups and accelerometers 
and serves to measure the characteristics of dynamic motion (displacement 
velocity, acceleration, and frequency) through the application of Newton’s 
second law of motion.

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 413
•• Any simple mechanical vibrating member such as a pendulum would 
serve as a time or frequency transducer, chopping the passage of time 
into discrete bits.
•• The pressure measurement by manometers is also based on the principle 
of mass displacement.
9.7.3. Thermal Detectors
These units sense the temperature of a system by indicating some change in 
the property of a material which varies with temperature; properties that are 
so used include:
i. 
Expansion of solids and liquids: bimetallic thermometers, liquid-in-glass, 
and the filled system thermometers.
ii. Thermoelectric property of metals and alloys: thermocouple and 
thermopiles.
iii. Electrical resistance of metals and semiconductors: resistance thermom­
eters and thermistors.
iv. Radiating ability: total radiation and optical pyrometers.
9.7.4. Hydropneumatic Elements
A simple float and a hydrometer are the two common examples of the hydro­
pneumatic sensors applied to static conditions.
• • The float converts the fluid level into displacement but makes no allow­
ance for change of the density of the supporting liquid.
• • A hydrometer senses specific gravity and uses the depth of immersion as 
a means for detecting variations in the specific gravity of the supporting 
liquid.
• • The obstruction head flow meters (orifice plate, venturi, and nozzle) pro­
vide flow information in the form of pressure change as a result of energy 
transformation. The obstruction placed in the path of the fluid results in 
a change of fluid pressure which is dependent on the rate of flow. The 
difference in pressure before and after the obstruction is measured by 
means of a differential pressure gauge and is correlated to flow rate.

414 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
• • Aero-or-hydrodynamic principles are also applied to determine the fluid 
velocity. A point tube measures the pressures resulting from the total-flow 
rate rather than the change of rate. Flow rate is also sensed by vanes in 
the form of airfoil and turbine wheels. Flow rate a inferred from the vane 
displacement or the angular velocity of the turbine wheel.
9.8. ELECTRICAL TRANSDUCERS
Nowadays electrical/electronic techniques of measurement are being increas­
ingly applied to measurements in many fields other than in electrical engi­
neering. The advantages of such methods over others are:
• • more compact instrumentation,
• • good frequency and transient response,
• • feasibility of remote indication and recording,
• • possibility of mathematical processing of signals like summation, integra­
tion, etc.,
• • minimum of friction and mass-inertia effects,
• • possibility of non-contact measurements,
• • less power consumption and less loading on the system to be measured, 
and
• • amplification greater than that produced by a mechanical contrivance.
The different electrical phenomena employed in transduction elements 
of electrical transducers are listed in Table 9.2 along with their typical 
applications.
An examination of Tables 9.1 and 9.2 would reveal that whereas displace­
ment is output from the mechanical and hydropneumatic devices, it is input 
to the electrical devices. This aspect results in a very workable combination 
with the mechanical device serving as detector-transducer and an electrical 
device serving as the electromechanical transducer (more often as transducer 
only) with the sole object of converting the linear or rotary displacement of 
the mechanical system into an electrical output. Transducers are also known 
as gauges, pickups, and signal generators. Most of the pickups have two basic 
elements in essential, viz., an actuating device and the transducing element. 
Some of the typical transducer actuating mechanisms are shown in, Figure 9.4.

9.9. TRANSDUCER CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION
The transducers may be classified on the basis of their application (type and 
nature of measurand), method of energy conversion, nature of signal out­
put, kind of sensing element mechanical or nonmechanical, and according to 
whether they are self-generating (active or externally powered (passive).
Self-Generating and Externally Powered Units
Self-generating transducers develop their own voltage or current. The energy 
required for this is absorbed from the physical quantity being measured. 
Examples are thermocouples and thermopiles, piezoelectric pickup, photo­
voltaic cell, etc.
Externally powered transducers derive the power required for energy 
conversion from an external power source. They may also absorb a little 
energy from the process variable being measured. Examples are resistance 
thermometers and thermistors, potentiometric devices, differential trans­
formers, photoemissive cells, etc.

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 419
Input and Output Transducers
Input transducers convert a non-electrical quantity into an electrical signal 
(a strain gauge or photoelectric cell) and the output transducers convert the 
electrical signal back into a non-electrical quantity (movement of a pointer 
against a graduated scale). In between the input and output transducers, 
there is usually signal conditioning equipment (amplifier, filter, etc.).
With the fast-developing technology, there has been a rapid increase in 
the development and application of various types of transducers to convert all 
the measured quantities into their electrical analogs. The output electrical sig­
nal may be amplified, recorded, and processed in the instrumentation system.
Transducer Description
Information must be available about the following aspects while describing a 
particular transducer:
• • the physical quantity or variable which is to be measured, that is, the 
measurand,
• • the principle of operation of the transducer and where the output of the 
transducer originates,
• • the sensing element which responds directly to the measurand,
• • the built-in special features (if any), and
• • the useful range, that is, the minimum and maximum values of the physi­
cal quantity the transducer can measure.
With regard to a DC tachometer (an instrument for measuring angular 
speed), the above-mentioned aspects are:
• • angular speed in rpm is the measurand,
• • principle of operation is electromagnetic,
• • AC generator is the sensing element,
• • commutator is the special built-in feature; it transforms AC voltage into 
DC voltage output, and
• • minimum and maximum values of speed are 0 and 2000 rpm, that is, the 
useful range is 0-2000 rpm.
The DC tachometer would then be specified as: “0-2000 rpm, DC out­
put, commutator type electromagnetic speed transducer.”

9.10. VARIABLE RESISTANCE TRANSDUCERS
In terms of physical quantities, the equation for the electrical resistance of a 
metal conductor is
£
A
R = p
where R is the resistance (ohms), p is the conductor resistivity or specific 
resistance (ohm-cm), l is the physical length (cm) and A is the uniform cross­
sectional area of the resistor (cm2). Any method of varying one of these 
quantities can be the design basis of an electrical transducer. In the variable 
resistance transducer, an indication of a measured physical quantity is given 
by a change in the resistance.

resistance (potentiometer)

Resistivity change 
(resistance strain 
gauge)
Further, with some devices, resistance changes with light intensity (pho- 
toconductive effect) while with others, resistance changes on exposure to a 
magnetic field (magnetoresistive effect).
The variable resistance transducers are passive and they rely on an exter­
nal excitation voltage for their operation. However, they are straightforward 
in design, simple, and easy to use.
9.10.1. Linear and Angular Motion Potentiometers
These potentiometers convert the linear motion (or the angular motion of a 
rotating shaft) into changes in resistance. Basically, a resistive potentiometer 
(or “pot”) is a variable resistor whose resistance is varied by the movement of 
a slider over a resistance element (Figure 9.5a,b). Translatory devices have 
strokes from 2 mm to 50 cm, while rotational ones have a full scale ranging 
from 10° to as much 60 full turns.
FIGURE 9.5 (a) Linear motion potentiometer schematics.

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 421
FIGURE 9.5 (b) Rotary motion potentiometer schematics.
The resistance elements in common use are wire wounds because they 
give sufficiently high resistance value in small space. The characteristics of 
the resistance wire are:
• 
precision drew wire with a diameter of about 25-50 pm, and wound over 
a cylindrical or a flat mandrel of ceramic, glass, anodized aluminum,
• 
resistivity of the wire ranges from 0.4 рй-m to 1-3 рй-m and tempera­
ture coefficient varies from 0.002%/°C to 0.001%/°C. With these values, 
the device operates with appreciable constant sensitivity over a wide tem­
perature range, and
• 
• the wire is strong, ductile, and protected from surface corrosion by enam­
eling or oxidation.
The materials commonly employed are the alloys of copper-nickel, nickel­
chromium, and silver-palladium.
9.10.2. 
Resistance Thermometers and Thermistors
Metals such as platinum, copper, tungsten, and nickel become more resist­
ant to the passage of electric current as they become hotter. Their resistance 
increases with growth in temperature, that is, they have a positive tempera­
ture coefficient of resistance. For many practical purposes and within a nar­
row temperature range, the metal resistance thermometers depend upon the 
following relationship between metal resistance and temperature
R 1 = R о [1 + a (11 - 10)]
where R0 is the resistance in ohms at the reference temperature (usually 0°C) 
and x is the temperature coefficient of resistance in °C-1. For precise tem­
perature measurements, platinum is preferred because it is physically stable 
and has high electrical resistance characteristics because of accuracy, stability, 
and sensitivity, the platinum resistance thermometer has been used to define 

422 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
the international practical temperature scale from the boiling point of oxygen 
(-182.9°C) to the freezing point of antimony (630.5°C).
Thermistors are essentially semiconductors (sintered mixture of metallic 
oxides such as manganese, copper, iron, and uranium) which exhibit large 
non-linear resistance changes with temperature variation, that is, they have a 
high negative temperature coefficient, Thermistors are normally made in the 
form of beads, disks, washers, rods and can be made as small as 1 mm. Therm­
istors have the advantages of high sensitivity, very small size, fast thermal 
response, fairly low cost and, easy adaptability to electrical readout devices.
Thermistors and metal resistance thermometers find extensive applica­
tion as temperature detecting elements for the purpose of measurement and 
control.
9.10.3. 
Resistance Strain Gauges
The operation of these gauges is based on the principle that the electrical 
resistance of a conductor changes when the resistance element is strained by 
an external force. Under no-load conditions, the gauge is bonded or cemented 
directly onto the surface of the body or structure which is being examined. 
The different forms of bonded strain gauges are:
i. 
fine wire gauges cemented to a paper backing,
ii. photoetched grids of conducting foil on an epoxy-resin backing, and
iii. a single semiconductor filament mounted on an epoxy-resin backing with 
copper or nickel leads.
The wire grid participates in the subsequent deformations both in the 
specimen and the resistance element. A tensile or positive strain increases the 
resistance while compressive or negative strain decreases resistance. Resis­
tance gauges made up of single elements measure strain in one direction only. 
A combination of elements, that is, rosettes will however permit simultaneous 
measurements in more than one direction.
The strain gauge is a versatile device and finds application in the measure­
ment of different variables such as load, force, thrust, pressure, torque and 
displacement, etc.
9.11. THERMOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS
When two dissimilar metal conductors are joined at the ends and the two 
junctions are kept at different temperatures, a small emf is produced in the 

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 423
circuit. The magnitude of this voltage depends upon the material of conduc­
tors and the temperature difference between the two junctions. This thermo­
electric effect is used in thermocouples for the measurement of temperature. 
Any combination of metals may be used. Two commonly employed combina­
tions are iron and constantan (an alloy of copper and nickel), chromel (an alloy 
of chromium and nickel), and alumel (an alloy of aluminum and nickel).
9.12. VARIABLE INDUCTANCE TRANSDUCERS
These transducers are based on a change in the magnetic characteristics of 
an electrical circuit in response to a measurand which may be displacement, 
velocity, acceleration, etc. Before discussing these transducers, it is pertinent 
to become familiar with the following terms and definitions:
• • Inductance or self-inductance: When a varying current is made to pass 
through a coil, an induced counter emf results due to magnetic flux inter­
secting the turns of the coil. This effect causes resistance to flow of cur­
rent and is called inductance or self-inductance.
• • Mutual inductance: The term refers to the setup of an emf in a coil or in 
a circuit element due to varying flux fields in neighboring coil or circuit 
element.
• • Reluctance: The term refers to that characteristic of a magnetic circuit 
that determines the total magnetic flux when a given magnetomotive 
force is applied. Reciprocal of reluctance is termed permeance.
• • Permeability: It is defined as the ratio of the number of flux lines set up 
in a coil under given conditions to the number of magnetic flux lines that 
would occur if the path were air (other conditions remaining unchanged).
Variable inductance transducers have the advantages of freedom from 
mechanical hysteresis, good response to both static and dynamic measure­
ments, continuous resolution, and high output. The performance is, however, 
adversely affected by the external magnetic fields. Variable inductance trans­
ducers can be classified into self-generating (active) and externally powered 
(passive) units.
9.12.1. Active Units
Active units in which the output signal is generated because of the relative 
motion between a conductor and magnetic field, and without the supply of 
energy from an external source.

424 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The operation of self-generating inductance transducers depends upon 
the following well-known principles:
i. 
When a conductor is caused to move with a velocity through a magnetic 
field in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, an emf is generated 
along the conductor [Figure 9.6(a)].
FIGURE 9.6 Fl ux cutting: operating principle of self-generating inductive transducers.
The relationship between the emf generated and the velocity is given by: 
e = BlV, where e is the generated emf, B is the flux density of the magnetic 
field, l is the conductor length and V is the conductor velocity. Evidently 
when B and l are maintained constant e a V. The emf generated along 
the conductor is then a measure of the velocity of the conductor. Trans­
ducers based upon this principle can be used for measuring velocities and 
are frequently used in the measurement of angular speed, vibration, and 
fluid flow.
ii. When a conductor is placed in a magnetic field with its longitudinal axis 
at right angles to the lines of flux and a current is allowed to flow through 
the conductor, a mechanical force is generated. This force acts on the 
conductor in a direction perpendicular to the lines of flux and to the con­
ductor (Figure 9.6b). The relationship between the force generated and 
the current is given by
F = B i l 
(9.1)
where F is the generated force, B is the flux density of the magnetic field, 
l is the conductor length and i is the conductor current. Evidently when 
B and l are maintained constant, then F a i. The force generated is then a 

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 425
measure of the current flowing through the conductor. This aspect forms 
the basis for the working of most of the moving-coil and moving-magnet 
type measuring instruments.
Some examples of self-generating inductive transducers are shown in 
Figure 9.7.
In the electromagnetic type, a coil is wound directly on a permanent 
core. When a plate of iron or other ferromagnetic material is moved with 
respect to the magnet, the flux field expands or collapses and a voltage is 
induced in the coil. Practical application of the device lies in the angular speed 
indication. When the pickup is placed near the teeth of a rotating gear, speed 
measurements can be made with great accuracy.
Eddy-current type
FIGURE 9.7 Self-generating variable inductance transducers.
Electro-dynamic (Rotational)
In the electrodynamic type, there is a movement of the coil or conduc­
tor within the field of a permanent magnet. The turns of the coil are perpen­
dicular to the intersecting lines of force. The movement of the coil induces 
a voltage that at any moment is proportional to the velocity of the coil. The 
principle of electrodynamic transducers is used in the magnetic flow meters.

426 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
9.12.2. Passive Units
Passive units in which the motion of an object results in a change in the induct­
ance of the coils of the transducer; energy is required to be supplied from an 
external source.
Passive type inductance transducers operate on the following aspects of 
flux linkage
i. When current i (amperes) passes through a coil having N turns and an air 
core (Figure 9.8), a magnetic flux ф (Weber), is generated
ф a N i or Ni = Sф 
(9.2)
where S is called the reluctance of the coil. The reluctance is also pre­
scribed by relation
1
S =-------Г
m0mrA
where A = cross-sectional area of magnetic circuit (m2), 
l = length of magnetic circuit (m),
p0 = permeability of free space = 4n x 10-7 H/m, and
p r = relatively permeability of the core of the coil. The value of p r 
depends on the core material, and for air p r = 1.
FIGURE 9.8 Fl ux linking: operating principle of passive inductive transducers.
ii. The coil inductance is a measure of the magnitude of magnetic flux and 
is defined as
N ф 
L — ----
i
(9.3)
where ф is the magnetic flux density.

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 427
Combining Eqs (9.1)-(9.3), we obtain
L = N2АЦ0Цr henrys
(9.4)
Evidently, the self-inductance of the coil is dependent upon the number 
of turns of coil, the geometrical configuration of the circuit, and the permea­
bility of the core.
Variable inductance/reluctance transducers are constituted of magnetic 
field and core such that a gap exists between the core and the fixed coils. A 
change in the reluctance of the magnetic circuit by a mechanical input results 
in a similar change both in the inductance and inductive reactance of the coils. 
The change in inductance is then measured by suitable circuitry related to the 
value of mechanical input.
The reluctance of the magnetic circuit may be altered by affecting a 
change either in the air gap or in the amount/type of the core material. Trans­
ducers that make use of an air gap change are known as reluctance type and 
the transducers utilizing a variable core permeability change are referred to
as permeance type.
Variable reluctance transducer: 
Figure 9.9 shows the variable reluc­
tance transducer in which the variable 
air gap serves to alter the inductance 
of a single coil. The change in induc­
tance may be calibrated in terms of 
the armature movement. The variable 
reluctance principle is particularly 
applicable to the measurement of 
dynamic quantities such as pressure, 
acceleration, force, displacement and 
angular position, etc.
Variable permeance transducer: 
Figure 9.10 illustrates the variable 
permeance transducer where the 
inductance of the coil is changed by 
varying the amount of core material.
FIGURE 9.9 Self-inductance variable reluctance 
transducer.
The arrangement consists of a coil of many turns of wire wound on a tube of 
insulating material with a movable core of magnetic material.

428 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
As the coil is energized and the core enters the solenoid cell, the induc­
tance of the coil increases in proportion to the amount of metal within the 
coil. A pickup of this type is used primarily for displacement, strain, and force 
measurement.
Figure 9.11 illustrates a form of a two-coil mutual inductance transducer. 
Coil A is the energizing coil, and coil B is the pickup coil. A change in the 
position of the armature by a mechanical input alters the air gap. This causes 
a change in the output from coil B which may be used as a measure of the 
armature displacement, that is, the mechanical input.
9.12.3. Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT)
One of the most useful variable inductance transducers is the LVDT shown 
schematically in Figure 9.12. The device has one primary and two secondary 
windings with the magnetic core free to move inside the coils. The core is 
attached to the moving part on which the displacement measurements are 
to be made. When ac current is supplied to the primary winding, the mag­
netic flux generated by this coil is disturbed by the armature so that voltages 
are induced in the secondary coils. The secondary windings are symmetri­
cally placed, are identical, and are connected in phase opposition so that 
emfs induced in them are opposite to each other. The net output from the 
transformer is then the difference between the voltages of the two second­
ary windings. The position of the magnetic core determines the flux linkages 
with each winding. When the core is placed centrally, equal but opposite emfs 
are induced in the secondary windings and zero output is recorded. This is 
termed as the balance point or null position.

FIGURE 9.12 Variable differential transformer.
A variation in the position of the core from its null position produces an 
unbalance in the reactance of secondary windings to the primary windings. 
The voltage induced in the secondary winding toward which the core is dis­
placed increases. A simultaneous decreased induced voltage results from the 
secondary coil. Thus, upon displacement of the armature, the result will be a 
voltage rise in one secondary coil and a decrease in the other. The asymmetry 
in the core position thus produces a differential voltage E0 which varies lin­
early with change in the core position (Figure 9.13). Small residual voltages 
resulting from certain stray magnetic and capacitance effects may, however, 
not cancel and the output voltage may not necessarily become zero at the null 
position. Figure 9.13(b) represents an enlarged view of the residual voltage 
when the core is at the null position.

430 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The differential transformers are available in a broad range of sizes and 
are widely used for displacement measurement in a variety of applications. 
Some important characteristics and features of the LVDT type of displace­
ment sensors are:
• • simplicity of design, ease of fabrication and installation, rugged and dura­
ble construction,
• 
wide range of displacement; displacement ranges available from 2 x 
10-4 m to 0.5 m,
• • high output, low hysteresis, continuous (infinite) resolution, and linear 
electrical response (linearity better than 0.5%) when actuated by linear 
mechanical motion, and
• • negligible operating force and no wear of moving parts.
The device, however, is not particularly sensitive and must be excited 
with ac only; excitation frequency 50-20 kHz. Input voltage is limited by the 
current-carrying capacity of the primary coil.
Typical measurements are any quantities that can be transduced into dis­
placement, for example, pressure, acceleration, vibration, force, and liquid 
level. The disadvantage lies in the area of dynamic measurements as its core 
is of appreciable mass in comparison to the strain gauge.
9.13. CAPACITIVE TRANSDUCERS
A capacitor comprises two or more metal plate conductors separated by an 
insulator. As voltage is applied across the plates, equal and opposite electric 
charges are generated on the plates. Capacitance is defined as the ratio of the 
charges to the applied voltage and for a parallel plate capacitor is given by:
C = e0 er— (N - 1) farads
where A = overlapping or effective area between plates (m2), 
t = distance between plates (m),
N = number of capacitor plates,
e0 = permittivity of free space = 8.854 x 1012 F/m, and
er = relative permittivity (or dielectric constant) of the material 
between the plates. The value of er depends upon the insulator material and 
for air er = 1.

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 431
For a cylindrical capacitor, the capacitor is
C = e0er------—=- farads 
(9.5)
loge | 22 |
I r1 J
where l = length of overlapping part of cylinders (m), 
r1 = radius of inner cylindrical conductor (m), and 
r2 = radius of outer cylindrical conductor (m).
A capacitive pickup operates on the principle of a variation in capacitance 
produced by the physical quantity being measured. The capacitance can be 
made to vary by changing either the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) 
er, the effective area A, or the distance between the plates t. The mechani­
cal displacement is generally measured by noting the change in capacitance 
brought about by either change in area or by change in distance between the 
plates. The change in the dielectric is used to measure changes in liquid or 
gas levels.
Figure 9.14 represents the elementary diagram of the two arrangements 
of a capacitance transducer where capacitance change occurs because of 
change in the area of plates. Since capacitance is directly proportional to the 
effective area of the plates, the response of such a system is linear.
(a)
FIGURE 9.14 Capacitan ce transducer: area change.
(b)

432 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Figure 9.15 represents the basic form of a capacitance transducer utilizing 
the effect of change of capacitance with changes in distance between the two 
plates. One is a fixed plate and the displacement to be measured is applied 
to the other plate which is moving. Since capacitance varies inversely as the 
distance between the plates, the response of this transducer is not linear.
FIGURE 9.15 Capacitan ce transducer: change in distance between the plates.
Capacitance transducers can detect displacements as small as 2.5 x 10-6 m 
and produce a measurable signal. Parallel plate capacitance transducers have 
the advantages of: (i) easy fabrication, (ii) excellent high-frequency response, 
(iii) good linearity output, (iv) ability to measure static and dynamic quanti­
ties, and (v) a relatively low initial and maintenance cost.

The 3 cm region between the two plates of a parallel plate capacitor 
is filled by two dielectric layers:
i. 
1 cm thick with dielectric constant 5, and
ii. 
2 cm thick with dielectric constant 10.
What would be the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of a 
material which gives the same capacitance if it completely fills the 
region between the plates?
Solution: For a multiple parallel plate capacitor with space between adjacent 
plates filled with different materials having dielectric constants erl, er2 .... er3 
and having respective distances t1, t2, t3, ..., we have:

9.14. PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS
Piezoelectricity represents the property of a number of crystalline materials 
that cause the crystal to develop an electric charge or potential difference 

434 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
when subjected to mechanical forces 
or stresses along specific planes. 
Conversely, the crystal would undergo a 
change in thickness (and thus produce 
mechanical forces) when charged elec­
trically by a potential difference applied 
to its proper axis. Elements exhibiting 
piezoelectric qualities are sometimes 
known as electro restrictive elements.
FIGURE 9.16 Piezoelectric transducer.
A typical mode of operation of a piezoelectric device for measuring the 
varying force applied in a simple plate is shown in Figure 9.16. Metal elec­
trodes are attached to the selected faces of a crystal in order to detect the elec­
trical charge developed. The magnitude and polarity in the induced charge 
on the crystal surface are proportional to the magnitude and direction of the 
applied force and is given by:
Q = KF
(9.6)
where Q is the charge in coulomb, F is the impressed force in N and K is the 
crystal sensitivity in C/N; it is constant for particular crystals and the manner 
in which they are out. The relationship between the force F and the change d t 
in the crystal thickness t is given by the stress-strain relationship.

where g is the crystal voltage sensitivity in Vm/N, and P is the applied pressure

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 435
There are two main groups of piezoelectric crystals: (i) natural crystals 
such as quartz and tourmaline, (ii) synthetic crystals such as Rochelle salts, 
lithium sulfate, ammonia dihydrogen phosphate, ethylene diamine tartrate 
(EOT), dipotassium tartrate (DKT), etc. The advantages vary from crystal to 
crystal and one is chosen on the basis of a particular application. Tourmaline 
is the least active chemically while tartaric acid is most active electrically.
• • Natural crystals have a very low electrical leakage when used with very 
high input impedance amplifiers and permit the measurement of a slowly 
varying parameter. They are, therefore, capable of withstanding higher 
temperatures; operating at low frequencies and sustaining shocks.
• • Synthetic crystals exhibit a much high output for applied stress and are 
about a thousand times more sensitive than natural crystals. However, 
they are usually unable, to withstand high mechanical strain without frac­
ture. Further, synthetic crystals have an accelerated rate of deterioration 
over natural ones.
The major advantages of piezoelectric transducers are:
• • high-frequency response,
• • high output,
• • rugged construction,
• • negligible phase shift, and
• • small size. The small size of the transducer is especially useful for acceler­
ometers where added mass will mechanically load a system.
The piezoelectric unit has the disadvantage in that it cannot measure 
static conditions and that its output is affected by changes in temperature. 
When an instrument is electrically connected to measure the electrical charge 
generated, it is slowly dissipated through the internal resistance of the crystal, 
that is, the charge decreases over a period of time. Because of this character­
istic, the piezoelectric transducers have a poor steady-state response and as 
such are used mainly for measuring dynamic quantities (parameters varying 
rapidly with time). Special amplifiers with very high input impedance (1012 to 
1014 ohms) can, however, be used to measure the static or quasi-static quanti­
ties, but that makes the measuring system increasingly expensive.
Applications: Piezoelectric transducers are most often used for acceler­
ometers, pressure cells, and force cells in that order.

9.15. PHOTOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS
These transducers operate on the principle that when light strikes a special 
combination of materials, a voltage may be generated, a resistance change 
may take place, or electrons may flow. Photoelectric cells are used for a wide 
variety of purposes in control engineering for precision measuring devices, in 
exposure meters used in photography. They are also used in solar batteries as 
sources of electrical power for rockets and satellites used in space research. 
Photoelectric transducers offer the advantage that they do not involve any 
contact being made with the system being measured; just interruption of a 
beam of light. Further, the light does not have to be visible; it can be selected 
to operate with infrared radiation. Photoelectric transducers can be grouped 
into photoemissive (phototube), photoconductive, and photovoltaic cells.
9.15.1. Photoemissive Cell
These transducers (Figure 9.17) operate on the photoemissive effect, that is, 
when certain types of materials are exposed to light, electrons are emitted and 
a current flow is produced.
light information ^ current information
The light-sensitive photocathode may consist of a very thin film of cesium 
deposited by vaporization onto an oxidized silver base. Light strikes the cath­
ode, causing the emission of electrons that are attracted toward the anode. 
This phenomenon produces the flow of electric current in the external circuit; 
the current being a function of radiant energy striking the cathode.

Mechatronics Systems: Basic Concepts and Applications • 437
There exist three separate types of photoemissive cells; the high vacuum 
single cathode, the gas-filled and the multiplier tubes. The high vacuum 
and the gas-filled tubes are both diodes where the cathode and anode are 
enclosed in a glass or quartz envelope which is either evacuated or filled with 
an inert gas. The difference lies in the extent of the vacuum and the kind 
of inert gas. The photomultiplier tubes use the principle of secondary emis­
sion. The device consists of a series of reflecting electrodes, called dynodes, 
which amplify the original output current. The dynodes are so arranged that 
the electrons making a dynode produce further electron emission from the 
dynode. The number of emitted electrons can be increased and high gains are 
made possible by photomultipliers.
FIGURE 9.17 Photo tube.
FIGURE 9.18 Photomultiplier tube.
With reference to Figure 9.18, voltage E1 accelerates the electrons emitted by 
cathode C and these are focused onto the dynode D1. Each incident electron 
causes emission of secondary electrons which subsequently get focused upon 
dynode D3. Finally, these are attracted by the anode A leading to the genera­
tion of current l.
9.15.2. Photoconductive Cell
These are the variable resistance transducers. They operate on the principle 
of photoconductive effect, that is, some special type of semiconductor materi­
als change their resistance when exposed to light.
light information ^ resistance information
Figure 9.19 shows schematically the construction and electrical circuit 
of a photoconductive cell. The sensitive material usually employed is cad­
mium sulfide, cadmium selenide, germanium, etc., in the form of thin coating

between the two electrodes on a glass plate. Further, the cells are used in the
circuit as a variable resistance and are put in series with an ammeter and a
voltage source. When the light strikes the semiconductor material, there is a
decrease in the cell resistance thereby producing an increase in the current
indicated by the ammeter.

9.15.3. Photovoltaic Cell
These transducers operate on the photovoltaic effect, that is, when light 
strikes a junction of certain dissimilar metals, a potential difference is built up
light information ^ emf information
The cell consists of a metal base plate, a non-metal semiconductor, and a 
thin transparent metallic layer (Figure 9.20). Typical examples of the layers 
are the copper oxide on copper and iron oxide on an iron combination. The 
transparent layer may be in the form of a sprayed conducting lacquer. Light 
strikes the coating and generates an electric potential. The output is, however, 
low and is a non-linear function of the light intensity. In contrast to photo­
tube and photoconductive cells, the photovoltaic unit is self-generated and 
requires no voltage source to operate it. Further, it need not be operated in a 
vacuum or gas-riled envelope. The most common application of photovoltaic 
cell is in light exposure meter in photographic work.

9.16. THE HALL EFFECT
The Hall effect relates to the 
generation of transverse voltage 
difference on a conductor which 
carries current and is subjected 
to magnetic field in a perpendic­
ular direction. The current may 
be due to the movement of holes 
or that of face electrons.
Refer to Figure 9.21 which 
shows the schematic of a circuit 
which produces the Hall effect. 
Here
FIGURE 9.21 The Hall effect.
i. 
the Hall strip carries a current/in the x-direction and is subjected to mag­
netic field B in the z-direction,
ii. the thickness f of the strip is very small as compared to its length and 
width, and
iii. the voltage E is set up in the transverse or y-direction. This voltage is 
directly proportional to the current I, field strength B, and inversely pro­
portional to thickness t of the strip. That is
E = KBI
t
The proportionality constant K is called the Hall effect coefficient. Tak­
ing the current in ampere, flux density in Wb/m2, and the thickness of strip in
meter, the units of K work out as Vm3 
W
The notable aspects of transducers operating on the Hall effect are:
i. 
The Hall effect is present in metals and semiconductors in varying 
amounts depending upon the densities or mobiles of carriers. However, 
the Hall effect is more pronounced in semiconductors than in metals.
ii. The magnitude of current flow in the circuit is limited by heat dissipation 
and permissible temperature rise.

440 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
iii. 
The Hall effect transducers are of non-contact type and have small size 
and high resolution.
The Hall effect transducers are used:
a. to determine whether a semiconductor is of N-type or P-type,
b. to measure either the current or the strength of the magnetic field, and
c. to measure the displacement where it is possible to change the magnetic 
field strength by variation in the geometry of the magnetic structure.

Figure 9.22 shows the arrangement of the Hall effect transducer as used 
for the measurement of linear displacement. This proximity pickup requires 
a ferrous target whose approach changes the reluctance of an internal mag­
netic circuit. The Hall effect element is located in the gap adjacent to the 
permanent magnet. When a plate of iron or other ferromagnetic material is 
moved with the suspect to the structure, the magnetic field in the gap due to 
the permanent magnet changes. That produces the output voltage which is a 
measure of the displacement of the ferromagnetic plate with respect to the 
structure.
This arrangement has been successfully employed for measuring dis­
placement as small as 0.025 mm.

CHAPTER 10
Actuation and Actuating Systems
10.1. ACTUATOR AND ACTUATION
An actuator is an energy conversion device that makes some things move or 
operate. Essentially it uses a form of power/energy to convert a control signal 
into mechanical motion, and the process of energy conversion to mechanical 
form is called actuation.
The actuators are encountered at house and at workplace. For example:
• • automatic opening of the door when a person enters a grocery shop, and
• • forward or backward movement of a car seat.
Actuators are located in from electric door locks in automobiles to aile­
rons in air-crafts. Industrial plants use actuators to operate valves, dampers, 
fluid couplings, etc.
Actuators are classified by the type of motion and the power source. Lin­
ear actuators produce pull or push action and the linear motion may be along 
with one or more of the three axes X-X axis, Y—Y axis, and Z—Z axis.
FIGURE 10.1 Types of motion

448 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The rotational motion is the motion of a rigid body along with one or more 
of the three-axis along the X-X axis, Y-Y axis, and Z-Z axis.
Depending upon the power source, actuators are categorized as:
• • Electromechanical actuators: These actuators use AC, DC, or stepper 
electric motors to convert electrical energy into mechanical work.
• • Fluid power actuators: These actuators use fluid energy that is transmit­
ted through a fluid under pressure. The fluid used is a liquid (water or oil) 
in a hydraulic actuator and compressed air or some inert gas in a pneu­
matic actuator.
• • Active material-based actuators: The operation of these transducers is 
based on the fact that some materials like piezoelectric and magnetostric­
tive materials undergo some change in their character when subjected to 
some physical interaction. The piezoelectric material undergoes a dimen­
sional change when voltage is applied and that dimensional change is 
utilized to produce actuators. The magnetostrictive material changes its 
shape when it is subjected to a magnetic field.
Though a new field, the active material-based actuators have been suc­
cessfully used in biomedical equipment, fluid control devices, aerospace, and 
automotive monitoring systems, precision manufacturing, and process moni­
toring equipment.
10.2. MECHANICAL ACTUATION SYSTEMS
Mechanical actuation systems are essentially the mechanisms formed by 
assembling a number of rigid bodies in such a way that the motion of one 
member causes the constrained and predictable motion of the other mem­
ber. A modification in motion and its transfer from one location to another is 
achieved through the application of specially designed rigid interfacing com­
ponents and units. Such rigid bodies are called mechanical components and 
these are categorized as:
• • passive components, and
• • active components.
The passive components do not transfer the mechanical power and 
include nut-bolt, screws, springs, and washers. The active components 

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 449
serve to transmit power in terms of force and torque, and motion regard­
ing its speed and direction. Examples of active components are kinematic 
chains, belt and chain drive, gears and gear trains, cams, followers, bearings, 
ratchet-pawl mechanism, etc.
The different applications of these active mechanical components are:
• • conversion of the reciprocating/linear motion of the piston into rotational 
motion of the crankshaft in an internal combustion engine,
• • transformation of the rotational motion of the cam into the translatory 
motion of the follower in the cam-follower arrangement,
• • change in magnitude and direction of speed by using gear train,
• • transformation of motion in one direction into motion in another direc­
tion at a right angle to it by using bevel gear, and
• • change of linear motion to circular motion and vice versa by the slider-crank 
mechanism.
The employment of these mechanisms within a mechanical system may 
also provide mechanical advantage, that is, amplifying the force. The term 
loading associated with these active components refers to several factors 
such as:
- 
force, torque, and speed of rotation, and
- 
accuracy, precision, and power consumption.
These units have been discussed in the following sections regarding their 
purpose, construction, and operation.
10.3. KINEMATIC LINK, KINEMATIC PAIR, MECHANISM, AND 
MACHINE
Each part of a machine that connects other parts having motion relative to it 
is called a kinematic link or simply a link. A link may also consist of a number 
of parts that are so connected that they form one unit and have no motion 
relative to each other.
With reference to the piston-cylinder arrangement of a reciprocating 
steam engine shown in Figure 10.2.

450 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 10.2 Schematics of a steam engine
i. 
Crank, connecting rod, cylinder, and piston of steam engine constitute 
four links. Each element is a separate link moving relative to one another.
Link 1 is the fixed link and includes the engine frame and all other sta­
tionary parts, like cylinder, and main bearings.
Link 2 includes crankshaft and flywheel, both having motion of rotation 
about the fixed axis.
Link 3 is the connecting rod having oscillatory motion.
Link 4 corresponds to the piston, piston rod and cross-head having recip­
rocating rectilinear translatory motion.
ii. Piston, piston rod and cross-head of a steam engine are rigidly fastened 
together and do not move relative to one another. They constitute one 
unit and are taken as one link.
iii. Connecting rod, big and small end bearings, caps, and bolts constitute 
one unit and are taken as one link.
The links are generally classified as:
i. 
Rigid link: a link that exhibits no relative deformation between two parts 
when it is acted upon by a force system. The distance between any two 
particles remains constant, that is, the size and the shape of the link do 
not change.
A link need not be a rigid body but it must be a resistant body. A body 
is said to be resistant if it is capable of transmitting the required motion 
with negligible deformation.
ii. Flexible link: a link that gets only partly deformed while transmitting 
motion. However, a flexible link does not affect the transmission of motion 
which is either a pull or a push in one direction only. The typical examples 
of flexible links are the belts and springs.

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 451
iii. Fluid link: a link formed by having fluid in a container. The motion 
to other components is through the fluid by pressure or compression. 
Hydraulic brakes, jacks, and presses represent fluid links.
10.3.1. Mechanism, Machine, and Structure
Mechanism is an assemblage of the number of bodies (usually rigid) assem­
bled in such a way that the motion of one causes constrained and predictable 
motion to the other. The function of a mechanism is to transmit and modify 
motion. Some examples of the mechanism are type writers, watches, clocks, 
and spring toys.
Machine is a mechanism or a combination of mechanisms that (apart 
from imparting definite motion to the parts) transmits and modifies the avail­
able energy into useful work. Steam engines, reciprocating compressors, and 
pumps are the machines derived from slider-crank mechanism.
Structure is a combination of a number of resistant links which are meant 
for carrying loads or are under the influence of forces having straining action. 
There is neither any relative motion between the links of a structure nor any 
useful energy is transmitted by it. Typical examples of a structure are the 
machine frame, bridge, and the structure of a roof.
10.3.2. Kinematic Pair and Types of Motion
A kinematic pair is a joint of two links or elements of a machine that are in 
contact and have relative motion between them.
With reference to the reciprocating engine, the kinematic pairs formed 
by different links are:
1. crankshaft with bearings which are fixed,
2. crank with connecting rod,
3. connecting rod with piston, and
4. piston with cylinder.
Further, the relative motion between the two links of a kinematic pair has 
to be completely or successfully constrained to make the required pair.
a. Completely constrained motion: Motion between the pair is limited 
to a definite direction, irrespective of the direction of the force applied. 
The constrained motion is completed by its own links.

452 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Square 
hole
Shaft
FIGURE 10.3 Completely constrained motion
Examples of a completely constrained motion are
- 
rectangular bar in a rectangular hole,
- 
shaft with collars at each end rotating in a round hole, and
- 
piston and a cylinder in a steam engine; here the piston has only a 
reciprocating motion relative to the cylinder irrespective of the direc­
tion of rotation of crank.
b. Incompletely constrained motion: Motion between the pair is in 
more than one direction. There occurs a change in the direction of rela­
tive motion with a change in the direction of an impressed force.
A circular bar moving in a round hole provides incompletely constrained 
motion. Here the bar can reciprocate or rotate, and both these motions are 
independent of one another.
FIGURE 10.5 Partially constrained motion 
(foot step bearing)
c. Partially or successfully constrained motion: Motion between the 
elements forming the pair is not completed by itself but is done so by 
some other means.
The motion of a circular shaft in a foot step bearing is made completely 
constrained by applying adequate force as shown in Figure 10.5.
Other examples of partially constrained motion are:
i. 
rotor of a vertical turbine
ii. 
IC engine valves that are kept on their seats by a spring.

10.3.3. Classification of a Kinematic Pair
A kinematic pair may be classified according to type of relative motion, type 
of contact, and type of closure.
1. Type of relative motion
Kinematic pair
। j S j ।
Turning pair Rolling pair 
Sliding pair 
Screw pair Spherical pair
i. 
Turning pair: The connection between the two links is such that one 
link can rotate or oscillate about the fixed axis of another link. The 
turning permits only one degree of freedom. This pair is also called a 
hinge, a pin joint, or a revolute pair. Examples are:
• • lathe spindle supported in the head stock,
• • cycle wheels turning on its axles, and
• • shaft, with collars at both ends, fitted into a circular.
ii. 
Rolling pair: The connection between the two links in such a way that 
one link can roll over another link, which is fixed.
Ball and roller bearings, wheels of locomotive and castor wheel 
of trolleys, etc., constitute the rolling pair. In a ball bearing, the ball 
and the shaft constitute one rolling pair whereas ball and bearing is 
another rolling pair.
iii. Slitting or prismatic pair: The two elements of the pair are connected 
in such a way that one link can purely slide over another link. There is 
a relative motion of sliding only in one direction (along a line) and as 
such only one degree of freedom.
Examples of sliding pairs are:
• • piston and cylinder,
• • ram and its guides in a shaper,
• • tailstock on the lathe bed, and
• • cross-head and its guides in a reciprocating steam engine.
iv. Screw pair: The connection between the links is such that one link 
can turn about another link by means of screw threads. Both axial 

454 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
sliding and rotational motions are involved. However, the sliding and 
rotational motions are related through helix angle, and the pair is said 
to have one degree of freedom. The rotating lead screw operates in 
nuts for accurate transmission of motion as in lathes, machine tools, 
and measuring instruments from the screw pair.
v. 
Spherical or global pair: One of the elements is in the form of a 
sphere and it turns or swivels about the other element which is fixed. 
For a given position of spherical pair, the joint permits relative motion 
about three mutually perpendicular axes, and so has three degrees of 
freedom. The ball and socket joint, pen stand, and the attachment of 
a car mirror represent the spherical pairs.
vi. Cylindrical pair: The relative motion in a cylindrical pair is a com­
bination of rotation and translation parallel to the axis of rotation 
between the contacting elements. Apparently, the cylindrical pair has 
two degrees of freedom.
A shaft free to rotate in a bearing and also free to slide axially 
inside the bearing provides a cylindrical pair.
2. Type of contact
The links of a lower pair have surface contact while in motion and the relative 
motion is purely turning or sliding. Examples are:
• • lathe spindle supported in headstock,
• • shaft revolving in a bearing,
• • straight-line motion mechanisms, and
• • universal joint and automobile steering gear.
The links of a higher pair have point or line contact, and the relative 
motion is a combination of sliding and turning. All sliding, screw, spherical, 
cylindrical, revolute pairs fall in the category of lower pairs. Examples are:
• • ball and roller bearings,
• 
cam—follower,

• 
belt, rope, and chain drives, and

pair,

3. Types of closure
A self-closed pair is formed when the elements constituting the pair are held 
together mechanically and only the required kind of motion occurs. The lower 
pairs represent self-closed pairs.

With reference to Figure 10.7, we have:
••
••
The links 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 form a closed pair.
The links 4 - 1 is a force-closed pair.
10.4. KINEMATIC CHAINS AND THEIR INVERSIONS
A kinematic chain is such a combination or coupling between kinematic pairs 
such that each link forms a part of two pairs and the relative motion between 
the links is completely or successfully constrained. The pairs are coupled 
in such a way that the last link joins the first link and a definite motion is 
transmitted.
Consider the following kinematic pairs formed by the links in the mecha­
nism of a reciprocating engine:
• • cylinder and piston,
• • piston and the connecting rod,
• • connecting rod and the crank, and
• • crankshaft and the bearings.

456 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The total combination of all these pairs can be referred to as a kinematic
The following correlations exist between the number of pairs (p), number 
of links (n or l) and the number of joints (j) forming a kinematic chain:
n
3
= 2p = 4 and j = n- -2
2
(10.1)
This is on the assumption that each link forms two pairs with adjacent 
links. Moreover, these relations are essentially valid when the chain comprises 
only lower pair. Further, the following relation has been suggested by AW 
Klien to determine the nature of chain.
h3
j = Й = p n — 2- 
(10.2)
22
where j is the number of joints, h is the number of higher pairs and n is the 
number of links.
When applying the above relations to a chain having ternary and quater­
nary joints
1 ternary joint = 2 binary joints
2 quaternary joint = 3 binary joints
••
••
••
The chain is called a locked chain when the 
LHS is greater than RHS. The locked chain 
represents a frame or structure which is 
used in bridges and structures.
The chain is called kinematic chain when 
LHS = RHS.
The chain is called an unconstrained chain 
when LHS < RHS.
FIGURE 10.9 Three-link mechanism
Consider an arrangement of three links

n = 3; p = 3 and j = 3

,,
The arrangement of three links does not 
satisfy the necessary conditions and obviously 
does not form a kinematic chain. Such type 
of chain where LHS > RHS is called locked 
chain. This chain forms a rigid structure (no 
possibility of relative motion) and is used in 
trusses and bridges.
Consider an arrangement of four links AB, 
BC, CD, and DA with joints at A, B, C, and D 
(Figure 10.10). Here
FIGURE 10.10 Four-link mechanism
— = 4; p = 4, and j = 4
Applying the conditions prescribed by Eq. (10.1), we get
— = 2p - 4; 4 = 2 X 4 - 4 = 4, LHS = RHS 
and
j = 3 — - 2; 4 = 3 x 4 - 2 = 
22
4 LHS = RHS
The arrangement of four links satisfies the neces­
sary conditions and obviously forms a kinematic chain. 
Further, the position of a single link such as AD is suf­
ficient to define the position of other links. The four- 
bar arrangement is then called a kinematic chain of one 
degree freedom.
When the conditions of Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2) are 
applied to an arrangement of five links (Figure 10.11), 
it will be found that LHS < RHS. The equality condi­
tion is thus not satisfied and accordingly, the five-bar
FIGURE 10.11 Five-link
mechanism
arrangement does not form a kinematic chain.
Such an arrangement where LHS < RHS is called unconstrained chain, 
that is, the relative motion is not completely constrained.

458 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
An arrangement of six links would satisfy the necessary conditions 
(LHS = RHS) and therefore forms a kinematic chain.
A kinematic chain having more than four links is called the compound 
kinematic chain.
The different types of joints as found in a chain are classified as:
i. 
Binary joint: Two links are joined at the same connection. The chain shown 
in Figure 10.10 has four links and four binary joints at A, B, C, and D.
ii. Ternary joint: Three links are joined at the same connection. The chain 
shown in Figure 10.12(a) has six links, three binary joints (A, B, and D), 
and two ternary joints (C and E).
FIGURE 10.12 Ternary and quaternary joints
iii. Quaternary joint: Four links are joint at the same connection. The chain 
is shown in Figure 10.12(b) has 11 links, one binary joint (G), four ternary 
joints (A, B, E, and F), and two quaternary joints at (C and D).
EXAMPLE 10.1.
Check the nature of chain and identify the links 
as binary, ternary, or so with reference to the 
link arrangement as shown in Figure 10.13.
Solution: The given assemblage of links has:
Ten links, one binary joint (G), and six ternary 
joints (A, B, C, D, E, and F). Since ternary joint equals 
2 binary joints, the total number of binary joints in the 
system is
1 + 2 х 6 = 13

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 459
Applying the equation, j = -- - 2, we have 
2,
13 = 3 x 10 - 2 = 13
2
Since left-hand side is equal to right-hand side, the given arrangement 
satisfies the necessary condition and obviously represents a kinematic or con­
strained chain.
Degree of Freedom
The degree of freedom of a mechanism is defined as the number of inputs 
that need to be independently controlled to have a constrained motion of the 
other links, that is, the mechanism can be brought to serve a useful techno­
logical purpose.
With reference to Figure 10.14(a), the angle 0 is sufficient to define 
the relative motion of all links, and accordingly, this mechanism has a sin­
gle degree of freedom. The five-link mechanism depicted in 10.14 (b), needs 
both 01 and 02 to define the motion of all links and so the degree of freedom 
of this arrangement is two.

in mechanisms and machines are given below:
i. 
A rigid body has no restraints and has six degrees of freedom.
ii. A circular shaft rotating in a hole and also having the motion of translation 
parallel to the axis of rotation has two degrees of freedom; angle turned 
and displacement.
iii. A rectangular bar sliding in a rectangular hole has one degree of freedom; 
linear displacement only.
iv. The resolute or turning pair has a single degree of freedom; this connec­
tion allows only a relative rotation between the elements l and 2.

460 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
v. A ball and a socket joint has three degrees of freedom.
vi. A screw pair has one degree of freedom; the relative motion between 
elements 1 and 2 is only rotational.
vii. The position of the crank of a slider-crank mechanism has one degree of 
freedom; position of crank is expressed by the angle through which it has 
turned.
Refer to Figure 10.15 for the different mechanisms that would be obtained 
when one link of a four-bar kinematic chain is fixed at a time. Though all the 
four inversions look identical, their mobility changes when the proportions of 
various links are suitably altered.
FIGURE 10.15 I nversions of a four-bar chain
The main properties of inversion are:
1. The number of inversions that are possible is equal to the number of links 
in the parent kinematic chain.
2. The relative motion (displacement velocity and acceleration) between dif­
ferent links is a property of the parent kinematic chain and as such, the 
relative motion between any two links would not change with inversion.
3. There may occur drastic change in the absolute motion of points on vari­
ous links (measured with respect to the fixed link) from one inversion to 
the other.
A mechanism is formed by fixing one of the links of a chain and apparently 
different mechanisms result when different links of the same chain are chosen 
to become the fixed link. The process of choosing different links to become

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 461
the fixed link is called kinematic inversion and the mechanisms obtained by 
fixing different links of a kinematic chain are called its inversions. Even though
a four-bar chain with a single degree of freedom constitutes a kinematic chain, 
there are other chains also which provide inversions of practical utility.
A quadratic cycle chain is the simplest and basic kinematic chain con­
sisting of four links which are connected in the form of quadrilateral by four- 
pin joints (turning pairs). The links form turning pairs and are capable of 
transmitting definite or completely constrained motion. Further, for contin- 
uous relative motion between the 
links, the sum of the lengths of 
the shortest and longest links is 
not to be greater than the sum of 
the lengths of the remaining two 
links.
Any of the links, in particular 
the shortest link, which may be 
able to make a complete rotation 
is known as crank or driver. With
FIGURE 10.16 Quadratic cycle chain
reference to Figure 10.16.
i. 
The link AD (link 1) is fixed and is referred to as frame of the mechanism.
ii. The link AB (link 4) makes a complete rotation and is the crank.
iii. The link BC (link 3) opposite to the fixed link is called the coupler.
iv. The link BC (link 2) makes a partial rotation, that is, oscillates and is 
known as lever or rocker or follower.
The coupler connects the crank and lever.
An important inversion of the quadratic cycle chain is the coupled wheel 
of a locomotive (double crank) meant for transmitting the rotary motion of 
one wheel to another.
The system has two cranks AB 
and DC which are of equal radius and 
connect with their center of wheels. 
The link AD is fixed and it maintains 
the center distance between the 
wheel centers. The couples link BC 
transmits the motion from one wheel 
FIGURE 10.17 Coupled wheels of a locomotive
to the other wheel.
The mechanism couples the two driving wheels of a locomotive and serv­
ers to transmit the rotary motion of one wheel to the other wheel.

462 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The slider-crank chain is another four-bar linkage consisting of one slid­
ing pair and three turning pairs, and it is meant for converting the reciprocat- 
ing motion of the piston of an IC engine into the rotary motion of the crank.
With reference to Figure 
10.18, the four links are: link 
1 (frame of the engine includ­
ing cylinder and pivot) which is 
fixed, link 2 (crank), link 3 (con­
necting rod), and link 4 (piston).
The sliding pair is formed 
by cylinder and piston (links 1
FIGURE 10.18 Sl ider-crank chain
and 4), and the three turning pairs are formed by frame and crank (links 1 and 
2), crank and connecting rod (links 2 and 3), and connecting rod with piston 
(links 3 and 4).
When the piston reciprocates inside the cylinder, the connecting rod 
oscillates and the crank rotates.
The two common inversions of slider-crank change are:
i. Oscillating cylinder engine that converts reciprocating motion to rotary one.
The connecting rod (link 3) is fixed and is connected to the piston rod 
(link 1) at point A. When the piston attached to the piston rod link recip­
rocates, the cylinder oscillates about a pin pivoted to the fixed linked at A 
and the crank rotates.
ii. Pendulum pump used for supplying feed water to boilers. The mechanism 
is obtained by fixing the cylinder of the sliding pair of the basic slider­
crank chain. When the crank (link 2) is made to rotate, the connecting rod 
(link 3) oscillates about a pin fitted to the stationary cylinder (link 4). The 
piston attached to the piston rod then reciprocates inside the cylinder.

10.5. BELT AND CHAIN DRIVE
The transmission of power in factories from one rotating shaft to another that 
lies at a considerable distance is achieved through belts and ropes. The shafts 
are fitted with pulleys, the belt is wrapped around the pulleys and its ends are 
connected to form an endless connector. The belts and the pulley remain in 
contact by the frictional grip.
With reference to Figure 10.21, pulley A which is connected to the rotat­
ing shaft is called the driver. The pulley B that needs to be driven is termed 
as follower. When the driver rotates, it carries the belt because of friction that 
exists between the pulley and the belt. The frictional resistance develops all 
along the contact surfaces that make the belt carry the follower which too 
starts rotating. The driving pulley pulls the belt from one side (called tension 
side) and delivers it to the other side (called slack side). The tension T1 in the 
belt on the tension side is more than tension T2 on the slack side.
Two parallel shafts may be connected by open belt (Figure 10.21) or by 
cross belt (Figure 10.22). In the open belt system, the rotation of both the 
pulleys is in the same direction. If a crossed belt system is used, the rotation 
of pulleys will be in the opposite direction.
The angle of contact in this system of drive is more and accordingly it can 
transmit more power than an open belt drive system. However, the belt wears 
out fast at the places where crossing takes place in the crossed belt system.

464 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Further, for a small center distance, the belt is not fully utilized because of its 
larger slanted runoff.
When a number of pulleys are used to transmit power from one shaft to 
another, a compound drive is used.
With reference to Figure 10.23, pulley 1 drives pulley 2. Since pulleys 2 
and 3 are keyed to the same shaft, pulley 3 is also driven by pulley 1. Subse­
quently, pulley 3 drives pulley 4. The arrangement conforms to an extended 
open system and all the pulleys rotate in the same direction.
10.5.1. Belt Material and Sections
A belt is a continuous band of flexible material having a rectangular, trapezoi­
dal, and round cross-section. A large variety of belts are available including 
those made of leather, fabric, rubber impregnated fabric, and synthetics. Belts 
and ropes obtain their flexibility from the distortion of the material of which 
they are made.
Flat Belt
A flat belt is a belt with a narrow rectangular cross-section. The flat belts are 
easier to use and are subject to minimum bending stress. The load-carrying 
capacity of a flat belt depends on its width.
Material used for belt is generally leather of various types having ultimate 
tensile strength between 4.5 and 7 N per cm width. For heavy-duty, two or 
three plies of leather are cemented and pressed one above the other. Such 
belts are called double or triple ply belts. Leather belts have the best pulling 
capacity, can be used both in dry and wet places at ordinary temperatures but 
are costly.
Belting is also made from plies of stitched canvas impregnated with rub­
ber or balata gum and is correspondingly known as rubber belting or balata 
belting. Rubber belts give the best results in damp conditions as they do 
not absorb moisture as readily as leather. However, they are quite expensive 

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 465
and get ruined in the presence of oil and grease. Balata belts are acid and 
waterproof and are used in the heavily saturated steam laden atmosphere of 
dye house or where chemical fumes are likely to affect.
Steel belts are immune from stretching and slipping, remain unaffected 
by dampness or heat, and transmit more power per cm width.
The mid-section of flat pulleys is provided a slight dwell to prevent the 
belt from running off the pulley. This is referred to as crowning of pulleys 
and may be rounded or tapered.
Flat belt
V-belt
FIGURE 10.24 Belt cross-section
Circular belt
V-belt
A V-belt is a belt of trapezoid section running on pulleys with grooves cut to 
match the belt. V-belts are usually made of cotton fabric, cords, and rubber 
which is vulcanized in molds of desired cross-section.
The salient features of V-belt are:
i. 
The groove angle in the pulley for running the belt is between 40° and 
60°. The belt rests on both sides of the pulley but does not touch the bot­
tom of the groove. The grooved pulleys are generally made of cast iron.
ii. The wedging action between the belt and sides of the groove increases the 
frictional grip and that reduces the chances of slipping; there is no pos­
sibility of belt coming out of the groove. Due to reduced slipping, V-belts 
offer a more positive drive.
iii. V-belts are used when the distance between the shafts is short, transmis­
sion members are large and large power is to be transmitted.
The ideal center distance for a V-belt drive is 1.25-1.5 times the 
diameter of the larger pulley.
iv. Multiple V-belts can be employed for greater power outputs. Further in 
the multiple drive system, the machine does not come to stop even if one 
belt fails.
v. V-belt drives run quietly at high speeds and are capable of absorbing high 
shock.

466 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
vi. Larger reductions in speed are possible in a single drive by using V-belts 
over small pulleys.
vii. There is better initial installation and replacement due to the standardiza­
tion of V-belts.
V-belts are available in five sections designated as A, B, C, D, and E, and 
these are used in order of increasing loads. That is, section A is used for light 
loads only, and section E is used for heavy-duty machines. The angle of V-belt 
for all sections is about 40°.
Round Belt
The round cross-section belts are employed when low power is to be transmit­
ted such as in instruments, household appliances, tabletop machine tools, and 
machinery of the clothing industry.
These belts are made of leather, canvas, and rubber. Their diameter is 
usually within the range of 4-8 mm, and the allowable ratio of the diameter of 
a smaller pulley to the belt diameter is about 20.
10.5.2. Velocity Ratio, Slip, and Creep
The velocity ratio of belt drives is the ratio of the speed of the driven pulley to 
that of the driving pulley.
Let d1, d2 = diameters of driver and driven pulleys,
о1, о2 = angular velocities of driver and driven pulleys, and
N1, N2 = rotational speeds of driver and driven pulleys; expressed in 
revolutions per second (rps).

Linear speed of driving pulley = о x

vent any slip between the belt and pulleys, both the pulleys will have the same 
linear speed. That is

The ratio N2 /N1 is a measure of the velocity ratio of the rotating pulleys. 
Further, it is apparent from Eq. (10.3) that the speed of a pulley is inversely 
proportional to its diameter.

Slip and its effect on velocity ratio: When the frictional grip between 
the belt and pulley becomes insufficient, there occurs some forward motion 
of the driver without carrying the belt with it. The relative motion between 
the pulley and belt is called slip. The difference between the linear speeds of 
the pulley rim and belt is the measure of slip.
Let S1 = percentage slip between driver and the belt
S2 = percentage slip between belt and the follower (driven pulley)

This will also be the velocity of the belt as it passes over the driven pulley.

Creep: When the belt passes from the slack side to the tight side a cer­
tain portion of the belt extends, and when the belt passes from the tight to 
slack side the belt contracts. Due to these changes in length, there is relative 
motion between the belt and pulley surfaces.
The relative motion is termed as creep of the belt. Like slip, creep also 
reduces the velocity of the belt drive system.
EXAMPLE 10.2.
An engine shaft running at 240 rpm is required to drive a machine 
shaft by means of a belt. The pulley on the engine shaft is 600 mm in 
diameter. Determine the diameter of the pulley on the machine shaft

a. the belt thickness is negligible and there is no slip,
b. the belt thickness is 5 mm and slip is neglected,
c. the belt is 5 mm tick, and a slip of 2% is allowed between the belt 
and each pulley.

each pulley is allowed. Determine the percentage of total effective

is found that an increase in tension on one side is equal to a decrease 
in tension on the other side. Find the maximum torque that can be 
transmitted by the belt drive. Take coefficient of friction between belt 
and pulley as 0.3

Resistance due to rolling = 0.00375 per newton load

overcome the frictional resistance as well as effort component of the incline.

The velocity ratio in belt and rope drives may vary due to slip, momentary 
overloads, or because of contact surface becoming slightly greasy. For con­
stant velocity ratio positive drive with a short distance between the drive and 
driven shafts, one would use the chain drive.
The chains are made of rigid links which are hinged together. This hinging 
provides flexibility needed for wrapping them around the driving and follower 
(driven) wheels. The wheels (called sprockets) have projecting teeth that fit 
into the corresponding recesses in the links of the chain. The wheel and the 
chain move together without slip and a perfect velocity ratio is ensured.

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 475
FIGURE 10.27 Sprocket and chain
Chain drive is used where the distance between shaft centers is short such 
as in cycles, motor vehicles, agricultural machinery, road rollers, heavy earth 
moving machinery, etc.
The advantages of the chain drive are:
- 
chain drive takes less space than a belt or rope drive,
- 
no slip takes place and that ensures a perfect velocity ratio,
- 
more suitable for transmission of power when the distance between the 
shafts is less,
- 
less load on the shaft,
- 
high transmission efficiency,
- 
capable of transmitting a good amount of power, and
- 
a single chain can transmit motion to several shafts.
However, the chain drive requires accurate mounting and careful mainte­
nance, is relatively high in cost and is quite prone to velocity fluctuations par­
ticularly when they are overstretched. Further, gradual stretching of chains 
necessitates the removal of its links from time to time.
Classification of Chains
The chains are primarily classified into hoisting and hauling chains, conveyor 
chains, and power transmission chains.
(a) Chain with oval links
FIGURE 10.28 H oisting and hauling chains
(b) Chain with square links

476 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
• • Hoisting and hauling chains: The links in such chains are of oval 
or square shape. The joint of oval links are welded, and the sprockets 
(wheels) used for such chains have receptacles to receive the links. These 
chains operate at low speeds such as in chain hoists or in anchors for 
marine works.
The chains with square links are used for hoists, cranes, and dredgers. 
These chains have low manufacturing costs but are easily prone to kinks on 
overloading.
• • Conveyor chains: The links in such chains are either of hook joint type 
or of closed joint type.
(a) Detachable or hook joint type chain 
(b) Closed joint type chain
FIGURE 10.29 Conveyor chains
The conveyor chains are meant for continuous conveying and elevating 
the material. These chains run at average slow speeds of 1.75 m/s and lack 
smooth running qualities.
• • Power transmission chains: These chains are available in the block, 
roller, and silent configuration. The link bearing surface for all these types 
is machined, hardened, and ground. These chains are essentially built for 
high-speed performance and have provision for efficient lubrication.
The block chains belong to the earliest stages of development in power 
transmission and are being put to some use as conveyor chains operating at 
comparatively low speeds. There occurs rubbing action between the teeth 
and links when approaching or leaving the teeth of the sprocket. This leads to 
noisy operations.
The roller chain assembly essentially consists of:
i. 
roller link plate and the pin link plate, and
ii. pins, bushes, and rollers.
The roller is free to rotate on the bush which is secured in its hole. The 
pin passes through the hole and the roller is held by the roller link plates. The 
central pins are joined and held in position by the pin link plates provided on 
both sides. The outward lateral sliding of the pin link plates is prevented either 
by hammering the pin ends to rivet the head shape or using the split pins.

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 477
FIGURE 10.30 Block chain
The salient features of roller chains are:
- strong and simple construction,
- quieter operation; there is only little noise due to the impact of roller 
on the sprocket wheel teeth,
- provides good service even under severe working conditions, and
- requires little lubrication.
However, the wear and stretching of the parts leads to elongation of chain. 
That results in unequal fitting of rollers into the cavities of the wheel and the 
load has to be carried by one or only a few teeth.
10.6. GEARS AND GEAR DRIVE
A toothed wheel or gear is essentially a wheel with teeth cut on its periphery.
Power or motion is transmitted from one shaft to another with gear drive 
when
• • center distances are relatively short,
• • speed of the shaft is low and the use of a belt drive is not recommended,
• • positive drive is necessary, that is, velocity ratio is fixed and known with 
certainty,
• • there is a need to step up or step down the speed,
• • high torque is to be transmitted, and
• • precise timing is required.
The gear drive has a compact layout and it provides a highly efficient and 
reliable service. However, the operation tends to become noisy, the whole 
set is affected when one tooth gets damaged, and the manufacture of gears 
requires special tools and equipment.

478 • Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
10.6.1. Types of Gears
The commonly used forms of toothed gearing are:
• • Spur gear: It is a cylindrical gear whose 
tooth traces are straight lines parallel to 
the gear axis. Further, the tooth profile 
is identical from one side of the face to 
the other.
The spur gears are used for transmitting 
motion between two shafts whose axes are 
parallel and coplanar.
These gears have a high (96-98%) effi­
ciency of power transmission and are free
FIGURE 10.31 Spur gear
from any axial thrust during tooth engagement. Accordingly, they have been 
successfully employed as sliding gears for speed change mechanisms in gear 
boxes of the lathe. However, compared to gears of other types, spur gears are 
noisier in operation, wear out readily and develop backlash.
••
Helical gear: It is a cylindrical gear 
whose tooth traces are straight helices, 
teeth are inclined at an angle to the gear 
axis. The teeth are thus of helical or screw 
form. This ensures smooth action and 
accurate maintenance of velocity ratio. 
However, lateral thrust is set up due to 
teeth being inclined. This lateral thrust 
gets neutralized by using double-helical 
gears called herringbone gears. The 
double-helical gears are the equivalent 
of two helical gears secured together, but 
they are manufactured as one piece. The
FIGURE 10.32 Helical gear
teeth may be continuous or separated by
a small gap. Further, the two helices are of the opposite hand and meet
at a common axis.
The helical gears are used in automobile gear boxes, and in steam and gas 
turbines for speed reduction. The herringbone gears are used in machinery 
where large power is transmitted at low speeds.
• • Bevel gear: The bevel gear wheels conform to the frusta of cones having 
a common vertex; tooth traces are straight-line generators of the cone.

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 479
The bevel gears are used to connect two shafts 
whose axes are coplanar but intersecting. When the 
shafts are at right angles and the wheels equal in size, 
the bevel gears are called miter gears. When the bevel 
gears have their teeth inclined to the face of the bevel, 
they are known as helical bevel gears.
• • Spiral gear: These are identical to helical gears
with the difference that these gears have a point FIGURE 10.33 Bevel gear 
contact rather than a line contact. These gears
are used when the connection is to be made between intersecting and 
co-coplanar shafts.
• • Worm gear: The system consists of a 
worm which is basically part of a screw. 
The warm meshes with the teeth on a 
gear wheel called the worm wheel.
The worm gear is used for connecting 
two nonparallel, non-intersecting shafts 
which are usually at right angles. This gear­
ing system is smooth and quiet in operation
and provides a high gear ratio; rotational speed of the worm is quite high com-
pared to that of wheel. Their use is recommended when high-speed reduction 
(more than 10:1) is required.
FIGURE 10.35 Worm gear
FIGURE 10.36 Rack and pinion
• • Rack and pinion: Rack is a straight-line spur gear of infinite diameter. It 
meshes, both internally and externally, with a circular wheel called pinion. 
The arrangement finds application where linear motion is to be converted 
into rotary motion and vice versa.
• • Internal and external gearing: Two toothed wheels on parallel shafts 
may gear either externally or internally.

480 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
In external gearing, the motion of the two wheels is unlike, that is, in the 
opposite direction. The larger wheel of the gear system is known as spur and 
the smaller wheel as pinion.
In internal gearing, the motion of the two wheels is alike; both rotate in 
the same direction. The external large wheel is called annular wheel and the 
small internal wheel as pinion.
The gears of shaft in the rack and pinion arrangement mesh externally and 
internally with the gears in a straight-line. With the help of rack and pinion, it 
is possible to convert linear motion into rotary motion and vice versa.
10.6.2. Gear Terminology
Figure 10.38 shows two gears 
1 and 2 meshed against one 
another.
A tooth of the driving gear 
(center O1) meshes against a 
tooth of the driven gear (center 
O2) at point P. The point P is 
called the pitch point. The cir­
cles whose centers are O1 and 
O2, and radii O1P and O2P are 
called pitch circles of wheels 1
Driving gear (Wheel 1)
FIGURE 10.38 External gearing
and 2, respectively. A pitch circle is essentially an imaginary circle that by 
pure rolling action gives the same motion as the actual gear.
Further, on the pitch circle of wheel 1, let A be a point on one tooth and B 
be the corresponding point on the adjacent tooth. The distance AB (measured 
along the circular arc) is called circular pitch of wheel.

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 481

Thus the diameter of a wheel is proportional to the number of teeth on it.
Further, when the teeth of two or more gears mesh with one another, the 
linear speeds of the two gears will remain the same.
Linear speed of gear 1 = n D 1 N 1
Linear speed of gear 2 = n D 2 N2
where D1 and D2 are the diameters, and N1 and N2 are the revolutions made 
by gears 1 and 2 per unit time.

Diametral pitch: It represents the number of teeth on a wheel per unit

Evidently, if the circular pitches of two wheels are equal, their diametral 
pitches are also equal.
Module: Module represents the ratio of pitch circle diameter (in mm) to 
the number of teeth. Obviously, the module is the reciprocal of the diametral 
pitch.

Refer to Figure 10.39 for some of the terms associated with profile of a 
gear tooth.
Addendum circle is the circle bounding the outer ends of the teeth and 
concentric with the pitch circle.
The radial distance between the pitch circle and addendum circle is called 
addendum.
Dedendum circle is the circle bounding the bottom of the tooth and con­
centric with the pitch circle.
The radial distance between the pitch circle and the dedendum circle is 
called dedendum.
The surface of tooth above the pitch surface is called the face of the tooth. 
Flank is the surface of tooth below the pitch surface. Tooth space is the width 
of tooth measured along the pitch circle. The length of the arc between the 
sides of a gear tooth, measured on the pitch circle is called thickness of tooth 
or circular thickness.
FIGURE 10.39 Gear terminology
The radial distance between the addendum circle and the dedendum 
circle is called the total depth. It equals the sum of the addendum and deden­
dum. Working depth equals the sum of the addenda of the two mating gears. 
The radial distance from the top of tooth to the bottom of tooth is called clear­
ance. The standard value of clearance equals 0.157 m where m is the module. 
Then

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 483
dedendum = addendum + clearance = m + 0.157 m = 1.157 m
Addendum equals module and is always less than dedendum.

10.6.3. Gear Trains
Gear train is any combination of gear wheels by means 
motion is transmitted from one shaft to another.
Various types of gear trains are:
1. simple gear train,
3. reverted gear train, and
The nature of the train used depends upon the velocity ratio required and 
the relative position of the axes of the shafts.
•• Simple gear train: Refer to Figure 10.40 for a simple gear train in 
which each shaft carries one wheel only. Between the driving gear 1 and 
the driven or follower gear 4, two intermediate gears 2 and 3 have been 
provided.

Comments:
i. The speed ratio and the train value are independent of the size and num­
ber of intermediate gears.
ii. The intermediate gears help to obtain the desired direction of motion of 
the driven gear.
With odd number of idle gears, the direction of rotation of the driven 
wheel will be the same as that of the driving wheel. Both the driving and 
driven wheels will have opposite directions of motion when the number of 
idle gears happens to be even.
The idle gears are also used when shafts with large center distance are to 
be connected.
••
Compound gear train: Refer 
to Figure 10.41 for a compound 
gear train in which all the gears 
do not mesh with one another. 
Between the driving gear 1 and 
the driven (follower) gears 6, 
two intermediate compound 
gears have been provided. A 
compound gear is a gear that 
carries two wheels mounted 
on the same shaft. Gears 2 and 
3 constitute a compound gear 
mounted on shaft M, and the 
compound gear comprising 
gears 4 and 5 is mounted on 
shaft P.
FIGURE 10.41 Compound gear train
In the compound gear train, gear 2 is a follower to the driving gear 1, and 
gear 3 is the driving wheel for gear 4. Obviously gears 1, 3, and 5 are the driv­
ers, and gears 2, 4, and 6 are the drivens.
Let, N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, and N6 be the speeds of the respective gears

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 487
T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6 are the number of teeth on respective gears.

plying identities (a) (b) and (c)

(10.13)
N 2 N 4 N 6 T1 x T x T5
Gears 2 and 3 are mounted on the same shaft M and therefore N2 = N3.
Again gears 4 and 5 are mounted on the same shaft P and therefore N4 = N5.
With these substitutions, equation 10.13 transforms to

A compound gear train helps to obtain a 
large speed reduction from the first to the last 
shaft with an assembly of small gears. Usually for 
a speed reduction of the order of 8:1, compound 
gear train or worm gearing is employed.
•• Reverted gear train: A reverted gear train 
manifests when the first driving gear and the 
last driven gear are on the same axis; axes are 
coincident and coaxial.
Refer to Figure 10.42 for the arrangement of 
a reverted gear train.
(10.14)
FIGURE 10.42 Reverted gear train

488 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
Gear 1 is the first driving gear (clockwise motion); it meshes with gear 2 
and makes it turn is the opposite direction (counterclockwise motion). Gears 
2 and 3 are mounted on the same shaft and constitute a compound gear. The 
motion of gear 3 is like that of gear 2 (counterclockwise). Gear 3 acts as a 
driver for gear 4. The direction of rotation of gear 4 will be clockwise, that is, 
opposite to that of gear 3. Apparently, in the reverted gear train, the motion 
of the first gear and the last gear is a like.
Let D1, D2, D3, and D4 be the pitch circle diameters of the respective 
wheels, and their corresponding speeds be N1, N2, N3, and N4.
The distance between shaft centers of gears 1 and 2, and that between 
gears 3 and 4 is the same. That gives
D1 + D 2 = D 3 + D 4
2 
" 
2
or 
D1 + D2 = D3 + D4
Presuming that the circular pitch or module of all the gear wheels is the 
same, the number of teeth on each gear is proportional to its circumference 
or diameter.
That gives
T1 + T2 = T3 + T4
Now, Speed ratio -^1 = number of teeth on drivens
number of teeth on drivers
T2 x T5
T x T3
(10.15)
The reverted gear train is used to connect hour hand to minute hand in 
a clock mechanism. Other applications lie in automotive transmissions, lathe 
back gears, and industrial speed reducers.
•• Epicyclic gear train: In the simple and 
compound gear trains, the axis of the wheels 
remain fixed relative to one another. The epi­
cyclic gear train is a special type of gear train 
in which the axis of rotation of one or more of 
the wheels is carried on an arm and this arm is 
free to rotate about the axis of rotation of one 
or the other wheels in the train.
Refer to Figure 10.43 for the arrangement of 
FIGURE 10.43 Epicyclic gear train
epicyclic gear train. The gear A and the arm C can 
rotate about the axis at P, the gear B meshes with
gear A and has its axis of rotation on the arm at Q. When gear A is fixed and 
arm C is made to rotate about P, gear B would be forced to roll around the 
outside of gear A.

With NC revolutions of the arm, the gear wheel B rotates about its axis by 
speed NB given by

The epicyclic gearing can bring about extensive speed reduction and is 
capable of transmitting high-velocity ratios with gears of moderate size in a 
comparatively short space. These aspects render it ideally suitable for use in 
differential gears of automobiles, wrist watches, hoists, pulley blocks, etc.

rate parallel shaft as shown in Figure 10.45.

If the input shaft mounted on gear 1 turns 800 rev/min, determine

10.7. CAMS AND FOLLOWERS
A cam-follower is a higher pair mechanism; its reciprocating or rotating ele­
ment imparts the desired motion to another element. The desired motion 
may be reciprocating, rotating, or oscillatory in nature. The driving element is 
called cam and the driven member is referred to as follower. The direct point 
contact between the cam and the follower is ensured by a spring.
Generally, the cam is connected to a frame forming a turning pair, and 
the connection between the follower and the frame constitutes a sliding pair. 
As such the cam-follower mechanism is a three-link mechanism of the higher 
type. The three links are:
i. 
cam which is the driving link and has a straight or curved surface,
ii. follower which is the driven link; it gets its motion due to its contact with 
the surface of cam, and
iii. frame which supports the cam and guides the follower.
Cam-follower mechanisms are quite impactful, easy to design and are 
used for generating complex coordinated movements. The common applica­
tions of the cam-follower mechanism are found in
• • clocks and watches,
• • IC engines for operating the valves,
• • automatic screw-cutting machines, and
• • printing machines and shoe-making machines.
Attention has been directed in this chapter to the study of various types 
of cams and followers, motion of follower with a given profile of cam, and to 
draw the profile of cam with the given motion of the follower.
10.7.1. Classification of Cams and Followers
Cams are classified according to shape, follower movement, and the manner 
of the constraint of the follower. However, the following two types are consid­
ered important:

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 493
a. Radial cams in which the follower reciprocates or oscillates in a plane 
that is perpendicular to the axis of cam.
b. Cylindrical cams in which the reciprocating or oscillatory movement of 
the cam is in a plane that lies parallel to the axis of cam.
The important shapes of the radial cams are:
•• Wedge cam that has a specified contour. The reciprocating motion of the 
cam may impart reciprocating or an oscillatory motion to a knife-edged 
follower.
FIGURE 10. 
47 Wedge cams
•• Tangent cam that has straight flanks and circular nose. The roller fol­
lower used in conjunction with such a cam may get reciprocating or 
oscillating motion.
FIGURE 10. 48 Tangent cams
•• Circular cam that has a circular flank and circular nose. Figure 10.49 
shows a circular cam operating with a flat-faced follower and an offset 
flat-faced follower. In the offset arrangement, the vertical center lines of 
the cam and the follower do not coincide.

494 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 10.49 Circular cams
The cylindrical cam, also known as drum or barrel cam has a circumfer­
ential contour cut on the surface of a cylinder that rotates about its axis. The 
reciprocating or oscillating motion of the follower is in a plane parallel to that 
of the axis of the cam.
FIGURE 10.50 Cylindrical cams: (a) oscillating and (b) reciprocating
Spiral 
groove
FIGURE 10.51 Spiral cam

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 495
The spiral or face cam consists of a circular plate having a spiral groove 
cut into it. There is engagement between the teeth cut on the spiral groove 
and the pin gear follower.
FIGURE 10.52 Convex and concave globoidal cam
A globoidal cam is constituted by a circumferential contour that is cut on 
a concave or convex surface. The motion of the follower in the globoidal cam 
is oscillatory in nature.
The follower in a cam-follower mechanism is classified either according 
to the type of motion of the follower or the nature of the surface in contact:
Based on the nature of the surface in contact, the followers belong to the 
following four categories:
a. Knife-edge follower: a follower that has a sharp pointed edge. There 
is a sliding motion between the contacting surfaces, that is, the knife­
edge and the contacting surface. Though simple in construction, its util­
ity is restricted due to considerable side thrust between the follower and 
guide and the high rate of wear.
b. Roller follower: is a follower that consists of a cylindrical roller that 
rolls over the cam surface. Due to the rolling motion between the con­
tacting surfaces, there is much less wear as compared to that in a knife­
edge follower. A side thrust, however, does exist between the follower 
and guide. Roller followers find favor for use in situations where more 
space is available such as in stationary gas or oil engine.
c. Flat-faced or mushroom follower: a follower that has a flat contacting 
surface. Quite often, the flat end of the follower is machined to a spheri­
cal shaft and the resulting follower is called a spherical-faced follower.

496 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 10.53 Types of cam followers
With these followers, there is less side thrust at the bearings and that 
implies reduced friction force and less changes of jamming in the bearings. 
These followers are generally used for operating the values of an automobile 
engine where space is limited.
Based on the path of the morion axis of the location of motion, followers 
are categorized as:
i. Radial followers: the motion of the followers is along an axis that passes 
through the center of the cam. The follower translates along a line passing 
through the axis of rotation of the cam (Figure 10.54).
Spherical-faced 
oscillating follower
FIGURE 10.54 Types of oscillating followers

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 497
ii. Offset followers: the motion of the follower is away from the center of 
rotation of the cam.
Based on the nature of motion, there are the following two types of followers.
•• Reciprocating or translating followers: the follower reciprocates in guides 
as the cam rotates.
•• Oscillating or rotating followers: the follower oscillates about a hinge 
point as the cam rotates.
It would be appropriate to mention that the follower is always constrained 
to follow the cam, and objective is achieved by springs, gravity, or hydraulic 
means.
10.8. BEARINGS
A bearing is a machine element that supports another moving machine ele­
ment (e.g., a rotating shaft) called a journal. While carrying the load, the bear­
ing allows relative motion between the contact surfaces of the members.
In radial or journal bearings, the main load is perpendicular to the axis 
of rotation of the moving element.
The portion of the shaft laying within the bearing is known as a journal.
The plain journal or sleeve bearings are classified as
i. 
Full bearing: The bearing completely envelops the journal.
ii.
iii.
Partial bearing: The enveloping angle 
is not 360° but is 120°. The friction in 
a partial bearing is less than that in full 
bearing but its applications are limited 
to only those situations where the load is 
always in one direction, for example, rail 
road car axles. The full bearing and par­
tial bearings are also known as clearance 
bearings since the journal size is less than 
the bearing bore.
Fitted bearing: A special case of partial 
bearing in which the sizes of the journal
FIGURE 10.55 Journal bearing
and bearing are equal and hence there is no clearance.

498 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 10.56 Types ofjournal bearing: (a) fitted bearing; (b) partial bearing; (c) full journal bearing
In the collar thrust bearings, the bearing pressure is parallel to the shaft 
axis and has end thrust.
Thrust or Collar bearing
FIGURE 10.57
FIGURE 10.58 Footstep or pivot bearing
These bearings provide horizontal load reactions in machine tools and 
marine drive shaft.
In the pivot or foot step bearing, the bearing pressure is exerted parallel 
to the shaft whose axis is vertical. The end of the shaft rests within the bearing 
body.
Such bearings carry the load in vertical steam turbines, water turbines, 
motors, and pumps.
In ball bearings, the rolling element is a spherical ball. The self-alignment 
ball bearing permits inclination of the inner race or shaft axis with relation to 
the axis of the outer race with 2°-3°.
Refer to Figure 10.59 which shows a typical rolling bearing.
The unit consists of an inner ring, an outer ring, and the rolling elements 
(balls) placed at equal intervals in the open space between the two rings. The 
balls are usually made of steel or ceramic material. The rings are of uniform 
stiffness throughout and their surfaces, called the raceways, are quite hard. 
Depending upon the geometrical configuration of the rolling elements, the 
rolling bearings are classified as:

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 499
FIGURE 10.59 Typical rolling bearing and rolling elements
i. 
ball bearings,
ii. cylindrical roller bearings,
iii. needle-type roller bearings, and
iv. tapered roller bearings.
Ball bearings can handle both radial and thrust loads but these loads have 
to be relatively small or moderate.
The needle and the taper roller bearings belong to the category of roller 
bearings in which the rolling element is a roller that may be cylindrical, coni­
cal, spherical, or concave.
The sintered bearings are self-lubricated bearings suitable for applica­
tions where regular maintenance is difficult.
In the roller contact bearings, the contact between the bearing elements 
is rolling instead of sliding as in plain bearings. Since the rolling friction is 
very less as compared to the sliding friction, such bearings are also known as 
antifriction bearings. The roller contact bearings have the disadvantage of low 
resistance to shock loading.
The ball bearings have been standardized into four classes and designated 
by a number consisting of at least three digits
i. 
100: extra light,
ii. 200: light,
iii. 300: medium, and
iv. 400: heavy.
Additional digits are added to specify special features. The last three dig­
its denote the series and the bore of the bearings. The last two digits from 04 

500 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
onwards, when multiplied by 5, give the bore diameter in mm. Thus if a bear­
ing is designated by number 308, it is a bearing of medium series with bore 
equal to 5 x 08, that is, 40 mm.
10.9. RATCHET AND PAWL
The ratchet and pawl mechanism is a mechanical gearing system used to 
transmit intermittent linear or rotary motion in one particular direction and 
prevents motion in the opposite direction. The unit essentially comprises two 
components namely a ratchet and a pawl mounted on the base as shown in 
Figure 10.60.
FIGURE 10.60 (a) Weighing mechanism; (b) Ratchet and Pawl
The ratchet is a gearing component having a star-shaped angled tooth 
around its outer periphery. The teeth are uniform but asymmetrical with each 
tooth having a moderate slope on one edge and a much steeper slope on the 
other edge. The ratchet receives an intermittent circular motion from the 
crank and serves to slow down the motion that happens in a jerky way. The 
pawl is a type of latch in the form of a teeth-shaped solid part that is pivoted 
at one end and rests against the ratchet at the other end. The pawl is usually 
spring-loaded and that ensures its automatic engagement with the ratchet.
When the ratchet rotates in one particular direction, the pawl rises and 
moves smoothly between the angled teeth of the ratchet. Subsequently, when 
the rotation of the ratchet stops, the pawl rests and gets jammed against the 
depression between the gear teeth, and that prevents any rotation of the 
socket in the backward direction.
As the ratchet can stop backward motion only at discrete points, that is, 
only at tooth boundaries, the ratchet does allow a limited amount of back­
ward motion. This backward motion is limited is a maximum distance equal 

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 501
to the spacing between the teeth and is called backlash. In situations where 
the backlash is required to be minimum, use is sometimes made of a toothless 
ratchet with a high friction surface. The pawl then bears against the surface at 
an angle; any backward motion causes the pawl to jam against the surface and 
that prevents any further backward motion.
The various applications of ratchet and pawl assembly are:
• • spanners, wrenches, and jacks,
• • freewheel mechanism of bicycles,
• • clocks, winches, turnstiles, and typewriters, and
• • hoists and weight lifting machines.
In the weight lifting mechanism shown in Figure 10.49(b), a ratchet wheel 
is fixed to a shaft and a drum around which a rope is wound. The winding of 
the rope is done by rotating the ratchet in the counterclockwise direction. 
When the rotation stops, the load on the rope tries to unwind the rope. This 
tendency is, however, prevented by the action of ratchet and pawl.
Ratchet and pawls are usually made of steel, stainless steel, cast iron, brass, 
and other metallic materials. The product specifications for ratchet and pawl 
include the number of teeth, outside and bore diameter, face width, and pitch.
10.10. HYDRAULIC AND PNEUMATIC ACTUATING SYSTEMS
Pascal law states that “intensity 
of pressure is transmitted equally 
in all directions that a mass of 
fluid in a confined place.” This 
characteristic property of the 
fluid forms the working prin­
ciple of fluid power systems. 
With reference to Figure 10.61, 
two cylinders of different cross­
sectional arcs are interconnected 
at the bottom through a pipeline 
and are filled with some liquid 
(oil or water). The larger c
FIGURE 10.61 Working principle of hydraulic press 
ylinder contains a raw of area A and a plunger
of the area a reciprocates inside the smaller cylinder. A force F1 applied to 
the plunger produces an intensity of pressure p1 which is transmitted in 
all directions through the liquid. If the plunger and ram and at the same

p 2 = — where F2 is the upward force acting on the ram must equal p 1.

Now, p 1 = 1 and p 2
a
Since p1 = p2, we have
F2-2 where F2 is the upward force acting on the ram.
F F 
(A
a=t F2=F 117
The above expression indicates that by applying a small downward force 
F1 on the plunger, a large upward force F2 acts on the ram by suitably select­
ing the ratio of the diameters of the two cylinders.
The fluid systems find applications in:
• • hydraulic jack, hydraulic lift, hydraulic crane, etc.,
• • measurement of process parameters and then using these parameters to 
act on necessary output, and
• • carrying out mechanical work and using the resulting motion (linear or 
rotating in cutting operations (sawing, turning, milling, and drilling); feed­
ing, sorting, and packaging; damping, shifting, and positioning.
• • controlling of plant, process, and equipment where a hydraulic or pneu­
matic system. The condition of the process is sensed and the information 
is fed to the controller for taking the appropriate corrective action.
The performance indices of a fluid system include:
- 
flow rate of fluid and chamber capacity,
- 
pressure fatigue and bursting pressure, and
- 
cleaning, compressibility, and viscosity of the fluid.
The process of the pneumatic system is similar to that of water or oil, 
compressed air supplies the inlet power.
10.11. CONTROL VALVES: FUNCTIONS AND TYPE
A valve is a device that regulates, directs, or controls the flow of fluid (liq­
uids or gases) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing the passageways. 
The valves way he operated manually either by handle, lever, pedal, or wheel. 
Modern control valves are automatically driven by changes in pressure, tem­
perature, or flow rate. These changes act on a diaphragm or piston which

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 503
then activates the valve. The automatic operation of the valve is based on an 
external input (flow regulation to a changing set-point) that requires an actua­
tor. The actuator operates depending on its input and the set-point and that 
allows the valve to be positioned accurately and allows control over a variety 
of requirements.
Valves are found in virtually every industrial process and are used for:
- 
starting or stopping flow,
- 
preventing back flow, and
- 
relieving and regulating pressure in a fluid.
Valves are quite diverse and are generally classified by how they are actu­
ated: hydraulic, pneumatic, manual, solenoid, and motor.
Further, depending upon how they work/operate, the valves are catego­
rized as:
i. 
normally open or normally closed valves. These valves are acted upon by 
some forces that keep them either open or closed.
ii. throttling valves that are intermittently opened or closed.
iii. directional control valves are used to redirect the flow. These diverter­
type valves are 2-way three-way or four-way valves.
- 
The two-way valves are the shut-off valves that have only the open and 
closed positions and have two ports called the inlet and outlet port.
- 
The three-way valves have three ports—an inlet port, the outlet port, 
and the exhaust port. The operation is in two conditions: (i) exhaust 
closed and the inlet open to outlet and (ii) inlet blocked and the outlet 
connected to exhaust.
- 
The 4-way valve arrangement consists of two 3-way valves which are 
operated by an actuator. The inlet port and the two exhaust ports are 
joined internally and that provides four ports comprising the inlet 
port, two outlet ports, and an exhaust port.
Further based upon construction, the control valves are categorized as: 
poppet valves (ball seat and disk seat type), spool valves (longitudinal slide and 
plate slide type), and rotary valves.
10.11.1. Pressure Control, Direction Control, and Sequence Valves
Pressure control valves are used virtually in every hydraulic system and 
they function to keep system pressure safely below a desired upper limit to

504 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
maintain a set pressure in any part of 
the circuit. These valves are normally 
closed and have a restriction to pro­
duce the desired pressure.
The different types of pressure 
control valves are the relief, reduc­
ing, sequence, counter-balance, and 
unloading type. The relief valve shown 
in Figure 10.62 consists of a ball or 
poppet exposed to the system pressure
FIGURE 10.62 Relief valve
on one side and opposed by a spring of
pre-set force on the other side. The spring holds the ball tightly seated and 
blocks the flow through the valve. When the force of system pressure rises 
and exceeds the spring force, the valve gets lifted from its seat and that lets 
the fluid out through the vent.
A sequence valve functions to provide a path of flow alternate and sequen­
tial to the primary circuit. The operation of these valves is controlled mechan­
ically or by pressure. The pressure-operated sequence valve is normally a 
closed poppet or spool valve that opens at an adjustable set pressure.
Fluid at the inlet port of the valve will not pass to the secondary circuit 
or outlet port until the fluid pressure reaches the set pressure. When the set 
pressure is reached, the sequence valve directs the fluid to a second actuator 
or motor to do work in another part of the circuit.
Typically a sequential valve serves to operate multiple actuators and their 
sequence of operation.
The direction control valves (DCV’s) are one of the most fundamental 
parts that are employed to start, stop and change the direction of fluid flow 
in a fluid control system. They allow the flow of working fluid (oil, gas) into 
different paths from one or more sources.
The DCV’s are classified according to certain factors such as:
- 
number of ports or ways
- 
method of actuation: manual, mechanical, solenoid-operated, and 
pilot-operated.
- 
shape of valving element is mostly a ball, a sliding spool, or a rotary spool.
The controlling of the passage of a fluid signal is done by generating, 
canceling, or redirecting signals and categorization of DCV’s is then done by 
signaling elements (input), processing elements, and power elements or final 
control elements.

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 505
The simplest direction control valve is a two-way valve that either stops 
flow or allows flow. The three-way valve allows fluid flow to an actuator in one 
position and exhausts the fluid flow from it in another position.
FIGURE 10.63 Four-way directional valve
Refer to the four-way directional valve which has four ports:
• • Pressure port P in communication with a pump or compressor.
• • Return or exhaust port R connected to the fluid reservoir or vented to the 
atmosphere.
• • Two output ports A and B connected to the actuating system (load).
The internal operation of the valve has been shown in Figure 10.64 both 
for the extend (forward) and retract (backward) movement of the piston.
Air/fluid
FIGURE 10.64 I nternal operation of the valve.

506 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
During extended movement, the pressure port P communicates with the 
outlet port B and that allows the liquid/air pressure to be directed to the cylinder 
from the left side. The exhaust of liquid/air from the right side of the cylinder then 
occurs to the liquid tank/atmosphere via exhaust port R through port A. During 
retract movement of piston, ports P and A deliver the fluid to right of piston and 
the ports B and R provide a path for the return to liquid sump/atmosphere.
Since the valve has four ports and two control positions, it is known as a 
4/2 valve.
10.12. ACCUMULATOR
Poppet 
valve
FIGURE 10.65 Bladder type accumulator
An accumulator is a unit installed in a hydraulic system to store high-pressure 
fluid during idle periods and later make it available to supplements pump flow 
and serve as a backup during power failure.
Three common types of accumulators 
used in a hydraulic system are bladder, pis­
ton, and diaphragm type. The bladder types 
find favor and Figure 10.65 shows the con­
structional features of one such accumula­
tor. There is a rubber member, called the 
bladder which separates gas from the oil. 
The gas is filled inside the bladder and the 
oil surrounds the bladder. Initially, the gas 
is pre-charged to around 80-90% of the sys­
tem working pressure.
This expands the bladder to fill most 
of the accumulator space with only a small 
amount of oil remaining inside. During 
operation, the hydraulic pump raises system
pressure and forces fluid to enter the accumulator. The bladder moves and 
compresses the gas valve because the oil pressure exceeds the pre-charge pres­
sure. The bladder movement stops when the system and pressures become 
equal. When there is creation in the system demand, the hydraulic pressure 
falls and the stored pressurized oil is released to the circuit.
An accumulator is essentially an energy storage device that enables the 
hydraulic system to cope with extremes of demand and yet maintain specified 
pressure in the system. Other advantages are:
• • smooth out pulsations and provide shock cushioning,
• • supplement pump flow and allow the use of less powerful pump,

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 507
• • act as an emergency standby power source,
• • provide quick response to sudden enhanced demand, and
• • compensate for any oil leakage, thermal expansion/contraction, and hold 
the required pressure in the circuit.
10.13. AMPLIFICATION
The signal from the detector transducer is normally very weak, and it needs 
amplification to a certain level where it can be detected for display or record. 
Amplification is also needed to transmit the signal over some distance. The 
device used to increase or augment the weak signal is referred to as an ampli­
fier; it may operate on mechanical (levers, gears, etc.), optical, pneumatic, and 
hydraulic, or electrical and electronic principles.

Figure 10.68 shows the arrangement and the associated block diagram for a 
simple lever supported on a pivot.

FIGURE 10.68 Simple lever signal amplifier
For an input displacement x, the simple lever causes the output end to 
displace by an amount y; x and y are related to each other by the expression 
y = 12

where l1 is a distance of input end from the pivot, and l2 is a distance of output 
end from the pivot. The ratio l2/l1 determines the displacement gain; amplifi­
cation of the lever can be varied depending on the relative distances of input 
and output ends from the pivot. With a simple lever, the input and out dis­
placements are of opposite phase, that is, if the input x goes down the output 
y moves up.
A greater increase in amplification can be achieved by having a compound­
lever system. The compound lever will have two or more levers linked together 
so that the output from one lever provides the input to the other.

10.13.2. Simple and Compound Gears
The simple and compound gear trains are used quite frequently to provide 
mechanical amplification of either angular displacement or rotary speed.
FIGURE 10.70 Simple gear signal amplifier
When the larger wheel (gear with teeth T1) rotates with the input angular 
speed 0i then each of its teeth fits into a corresponding space on the small 
wheel (gear with teeth T2). That results in an angular speed 00 of the output 
gear; 0i and 00 are related to each other by the expression.
00 
T1 
number of the teeth on input gear wheel
01 
T2 
number of teeth on output gear wheel
The ratio Tl/T2 determines the gain; the amplification of a simple gear 
can be varied depending on the number of teeth on the input and output 
gear wheels. With a simple gear, the input and output displacements are of 
opposite phase, that is, if the input wheel rotates counterclockwise the output 
wheel turns clockwise.
A greater increase in amplification can be achieved by involving more 
gear wheels. In the compound gear train illustrated in Figure 10.71, the input 
rotational signal 0i is applied to wheel A which has T1 signal teeth. The teeth 
on this wheel mesh with teeth on wheel B which has T2 teeth. One rotation of 
wheel A would result in (T1/T2) rotations of wheel B as well as wheel C. This is 
due to the fact that gear wheels B and C are mounted on the same shaft. The 
gear wheel C has T3 teeth and it drives the gear wheel D which has T4 teeth.
Thus one rotation of wheel C would give (T3/T4) rotations to wheel D, 
and (T1T2) rotations of wheel C would amount to (T 1/T2 x T3/T4) rotations of 
wheel D. Thus overall magnification of gear would be teeth on the wheel

FIGURE 10.71 Compound gear trains
A compound gear train gives greater magnification with the additional 
advantage of no change in the direction of input signal. The gear trains are 
used for the magnification of displacement in the bourdon tube pressure 
gauge and in the dial-test indicator where linear movement is translated into 
rotation by means of rack and pinion.
The mechanical amplification usually suffers from errors caused by:
• • internal loading,
• • friction at the mating parts,
• • elastic deformation, and
• • backlash.
EXAMPLE 10.2 0.
Figure 10.72 illustrates the gear arrangement for a particular dial­
test indicator. The plunger is a part of a rack and pinion mechanism 
so that the movement of the plunger vertically upwards or down­
wards rotates the pinion. The rack has a tooth pitch of 5 teeth per cm 
and engages with a pinion having 15 teeth. The gears A and C have

512 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
30 teeth, and the gears B and D have 15 teeth respectively. Calculate 
the magnification and the number of revolutions of the pointer as the 
plunger moves 30 mm.
FIGURE 10.72 Basic features of dial-test indicator
Solution: Corresponding to a plunger movement of 30 mm, the rack (5 teeth/ 
cm) turns 15 teeth. Since there are 15 teeth on the pinion which engage with 
the rack, the pinion will rotate through one revolution.
Now, one revolution of pinion corresponds to
= 1 revolution of gear A = 1 x revolutions of gear B

Since the pointer is attached to gear D, it will turn four revolutions as the 
plunger moves 30 mm.

Hydraulic amplifier: Refer 10.73.
When a small displacement x is applied to a piston operating inside a 
cylinder containing some liquid, there occurs a large displacement y of the 
liquid in the output tube which has a small diameter d. From volume balance 
of the liquid, displacement of liquid in the cylinder = displacement of liquid 
in the output tube

10.13.4. Pneumatic Amplifier
When pressure P1 is applied to the bellows, the valve spindle moves toward 
right and that increases the gap between the valve and its seat. More of the 
high-pressure air (Px) rushes inwards and results in an increase in the output 
pressure P2. Normally a linear relationship exists over a part of the range of 
movement of the valve: P2 = KP1, where K is a constant.

10.14. HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS
When the force required to affect a change in the flow variable is too large 
for self-actuation by the fluid system, a separate force augmenting system is 
utilized. The force augmenting system may be hydraulic (using a liquid such 
as oil) or pneumatic (using a gas, particularly air).
Hydraulic actuators use a liquid control medium to provide an output sig­
nal which is a function of an input error signal. The schematics of a hydraulic 
actuating system are illustrated in Figure 10.75; the major components are an 
error detector, an amplifier, a hydraulic control valve, and an actuator.
FIGURE 10.75 Schematics of a hydraulic actuating system
There are two main types of high-pressure hydraulic power supply systems:

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 515
Oil to system
Oil from system
Oil to system
Oil from system
FIGURE 10.76 Constant-flow and constant-pressure hydraulic actuator systems
i. Constant-flow arrangement (Figure 10.76a): A constant displacement­
type pump serves to draw oil from an oil sump and provides it at a 
constant-flow rate. The high-pressure oil is filtered and then led to a con­
trol valve with a controlled fluid leakage back to the sump. Under no-load 
conditions; the whole of the oil is returned to the sump. The arrangement 
works efficiently when the full flow of oil is to be used for longer periods.
ii. Constant-pressure arrangement (Figure 10.76b): An accumulator is used 
which maintains oil at constant-pressure, and also stores energy for peak 
power demands. At pressure values higher than the predetermined value, 
a pressure relief valve operates to bypass fluid between high pressure and 
return lines.
10.14.1. Hydraulic Pump
There are three main types of pumps used 
in hydraulic systems viz., the gear pump, 
the vane pump, and the piston pump.
Figure 10.77 shows the outline of a 
fixed displacement gear pump. The unit 
consists of two rotors that are mounted on 
separate parallel shafts. The oil trapped 
between the teeth of the suction port 
revolving gears and the metal casing is 
delivered from the suction port to the dis­
charge port.
FIGURE 10.77 Gear pump

516 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
To check leakage between the suction and discharge side of the pump, 
the gear teeth are of special involute or cycloid construction. The meshing of 
gears serves both to transmit the drive and to maintain a seal between pres­
sure and suction. Care is taken to ensure that the oil trapped between the suc­
cessive lines of contact does not build up pressure. A change in flow direction 
can be affected by reversing the direction of the gear assembly.
The difficulties associated due to wear in gear pump are overcome in 
a vane pump which is shown in Figure 10.78. The unit consists of a slotted 
rotor with a number of spring-loaded radial vanes inserted in the slots. The 
rotor drum is mounted eccentrically in the casing and the vanes are allowed 
to slide into and out of the rotor as it rotates. The space between the vanes 
is filled with the liquid at the suctions side and is carried to the delivery side. 
The quantity of liquid pumped and the direction of flow can be controlled by 
affecting a change in the degree of eccentricity.
FIGURE 10.79 Axial flow piston pump
FIGURE 10.78 Vane pump
Figure 10.79 depicts a simplified version of an axial flow piston pump. 
The unit consists essentially of a cylindrical block that is rotated along with its 
piston. This rotation causes the piston to move back and forth parallel to the 
shaft, and butt against the non-metal wobble or swash plate. The angle of the 
wobble plate is either kept constant or is varied in accordance with whether 
the pump is to have a fixed displacement or a variable displacement. No flow 
takes place when the wobble plate is perpendicular.
10.14.2. Hydraulic Valves
These elements of a hydraulic actuating system function to regulate the flow 
of hydraulic fluid from the high-pressure side to the actuator, that is, the 
hydraulic motor. There are three main types of valves; the piston or spool­
type, the flapper and nozzle type, and the jet-pipe valve. In all cases, the 

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 517
mechanical input motion can be controlled by manual operation, by a limited 
motion electric motor, or by the hydraulic pilot method. The output results in 
a change of hydraulic pressure.
Piston or spool valve: The commonly used spool valve is constructed in 
either a three-way or a four-way valve arrangement as shown in Figure 10.80.
FIGURE 10.80 Cylindrical spool valves: (a) four-land and (b) thee-land
When the spool is in the neutral position, the oil flow to the actuator is 
completely blocked. Displacement of the spool to right and left causes alter­
nately pressure in one port to be higher than that in the other port. This 
is because when one of the pipelines to the actuator gets connected to the 
constant-pressure supply, the other pipeline communicates with the drain. 
The differential pressure causes the hydraulic motor to rotate in a particular 
direction. The flow and, therefore, the motor speed is the function of the 
spool-valve opening, affected somewhat by the load pressure.
Flapper-nozzle valve: The operation of the unit is based on a variable 
leakage arrangement, which has the great virtues of simplicity and reliability. 
The unit incorporates two orifices in series, one of which is a fixed restriction 
and the other variable orifice consisting of a flapper and nozzle arrangement 
(Figure 10.81). The nozzle restriction is changed as the flapper is positioned 
closer to or farther from the nozzle. The fluid at constant-pressure passes 
through the restriction and a branch is led to the nozzle. When the flapper 
moves into a position that completely blocks the nozzle opening, there is very 
little leakage and the output pressure approaches that of the supply. With 
nozzle opening, there occurs an increase in pressure drop across the restric­
tion, and consequently, the output pressure diminishes. Thus, the device pro­
duces a variable output pressure with a flapper position.

Jet-pipe valve: The device comprises a pivoted 
nozzle and two adjacent orifices. The nozzle con­
verts the static pressure of the system into kinetic 
energy and then directs the high-velocity jet of 
hydraulic fluid toward the orifices. During flow 
through orifices, the kinetic energy is reconverted 
to pressures; the conversion being approximately 
90% efficient at moderate supply pressure. This 
results from the act that friction can be reduced 
to a minimum by making the space between the 
nozzle and orifices relatively large.

The flapper-nozzle and jet-pipe valve arrangements are frequently used

10.14.3. Desirable Characteristics of Hydraulic Fluids
• • Low level of impurities and high value of the bulk modulus,
• • sufficient film strength to prevent metal-to-metal contact between moving 
parts, that is, to avoid wear of control valve, motor, and pump elements,
• • adequate viscosity to give good seal at piston, glands, and valves. At low 
viscosity, the moving parts would wear rapidly and there would be loss of 
fluid from the system. However, with highly viscous fluids, there would 
be excessive load to the moving parts and a considerable pressure drop 
along the feed lines,
• • good chemical stability, that is, resistance to the formation of sludge and 
gum. The formation of the emulsion during the churning of fluid as it 

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 519
passes through pumps, valves, piping, and motors would reduce lubricity 
and often cause rusting, and
• • freedom from acidity, a low pour point temperature, a high flash point, 
resistance to foaming, and anti-rust properties.
Petroleum-based oils, with or without additives, are the most common of 
hydraulic fluids because of their superior lubricating and corrosive protect­
ing features. However, certain synthetic fluids like phosphate or silicate ester 
compounds, halogenated fluids, and silicon fluid are now being preferred 
because of their good fire resistance characteristics.
10.14.4. Advantages and Limitations of Hydraulic Systems
• • High response due to effectively incompressible nature of the liquid 
control medium,
• • high power gain due to readily conversion of liquids to high pressure or 
flows. The high energy liquid can be effectively piloted by the hydraulic 
controllers,
• • simplicity of the actuator system,
• • long life due to self-lubricating properties of the hydraulic liquids,
• • requirements of proper seals and connection so as to prevent the leakage 
of hydraulic fluid,
• • careful maintenance of the system to keep the fluid clean and pure, and
• • stringent requirements for the hydraulic fluid to be fire-resistant, anti­
corrosion, and self-lubricating.
Their high power-to-weight ratio results in their finding a wide range of 
use in machine tools, speed governing systems, and position control systems.
10.15. PNEUMATIC ACTUATORS SYSTEMS
Pneumatic controllers use an air control medium to provide an output signal 
which is a function of an input error signal. The schematics of a pneumatic 
control system are illustrated in Figure 10.83; the major components are an 
error detector, flapper-nozzle (controller mechanism), and an amplifier or 
pilot relay.

Output
FIGURE 10.83 Schematics of a pneumatic actuating system
The pneumatic actuating mechanisms are of two types: force-balance and 
motion-balance. In a force-balance control (Figure 10.84a), the deviation of a 
diaphragm is proportional to the pressure difference (Ps - P0); Ps and P0 being 
the set-point and output signal pressures, respectively, In a motion-balance 
controller (Figure 10.84b) the deviation signal is taken from a point on a mechan­
ical linkage. A control on the deviation movement (l2 x - l1 x)/(lj + l2) can be 
affected by altering the values of l1 and l2.

10.15.1. Pneumatic Nozzle-flapper
A nozzle-flapper is a basic component of pneumatic and hydraulic meas­
urements, control and transmission, and as a precision gauging equipment. 
Figure 10.85 shows a schematic diagram of a pneumatic nozzle-flapper 
amplifier.

FIGURE 10.85 Pneumatic nozzle-flapper
The unit consists essentially of nozzle supplied with pressurized air (1.4 bar 
gauge) through an orifice restriction. The orifice diameter is approximately 0.25 
mm and that of the nozzle is 0.675 mm. For proper functioning, the nozzle 
diameter must be larger than the orifice diameter. Just in front of the noz­
zle, there is a flapper which is positioned by the input motion. As the flap­
per approaches the nozzle, there is an increase in resistance to the flow of air 
through the nozzle; consequently, the nozzle back pressure increases. If the 
nozzle is completely closed by the flapper, air cannot escape through the nozzle.
Consequently, maximum air passes at the supply pressure Ps. When the 
nozzle-flapper distance x is made wider by moving the flapper away from 
the nozzle, there is practically no restriction and most of the air escapes to 
the atmosphere. The nozzle back pressure takes on a minimum value; the 
lowest possible value being the atmospheric pressure Pa. Thus a movement 
x of the flapper causes a proportional change in the nozzle back pressure Pb 
if the supply pressure Ps is kept constant. Figure 10.86 shows a typical curve 
relating the back pressure Pb to the nozzle-flapper distance x. The slope of 
the curve at any point is called the 
nozzle sensitivity or gain. For the 
commonly used 0.25 mm diam­
eter orifice and 0.625 mm nozzle 
combination, 0.3625 mm motion 
of the baffle causes a change in 
the nozzle back pressure greater 
than 0.56 bar in the central por­
tion of the curve. The steep and 
almost linear part of the curve is 
utilized in the actual operation of 
the nozzle-flapper unit.

522 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
10.15.2. Pneumatic Relay
To increase gain and to have larger 
outputs required for the operation of 
large pneumatic actuators, a pneu­
matic relay is often used in conjunc­
tion with the nozzle-flapper unit. 
Figure 10.88 shows the outline of 
the most common form of a pneu­
matic relay widely used in process 
control. When the nozzle back pres­
sure increases, the ball valve is forced 
toward the lower seat. The air supply 
is shut off and output pressure P0 to 
the pneumatic valve drops. When the 
ball rests on its upper seat, the exhaust 
Air supply, Ps
FIGURE 10.87 Pneumatic relay unit
port is closed and the control pressure P0 becomes equal to be supply pressure 
Ps. The control pressure can thus be varied from 0 bar to full supply pressure
of 1.2 bar (gauge). The movement of the ball takes place due to a change in 
the value of nozzle back pressure which results from the displacement of a 
flapper in front of the nozzle. The relay system is of bleed type since, at all 
positions of the ball except at the top-seat, the air continues to bleed into the 
atmosphere.
10.15.3. Single-Acting and Double-Acting Pneumatic Actuators
In a pneumatic actuator, compressed air is the basic energy source. A recipro­
cating compressor sucks air from the atmosphere, compresses it to the requi­
site pressure, and the compressed air is stored into a pressure vessel called the 
air receiver. This air is required to be dry and clean free from dirt and dust. For 
that, a cooler is used to reduce the air temperature after compression and a 
separator is employed to remove any water vapor that may be present in the air.
Compressed air
FIGURE 10.88 Single-acting pneumatic actuator

Actuation and Actuating Systems • 523
In the single-acting pneumatic actuator, spring force allows the piston to 
move linearly in one direction only into a cylinder which is a hollow chamber. 
The pressurized air from the receiver enters the cylinder into chamber A and 
overcomes the spring force. When the supply of compressed air is stopped 
and the air inside the chamber is allowed to escape to the atmosphere, the 
piston travels toward the right.
Compressed air

FIGURE 10.89 Double-acting pneumatic actuator
The double-acting pneumatic arrangement has two ports (valves) for 
compressed air supply and its subsequent release to the atmosphere. When 
pressurized air enters chamber A, there is an escape of air from chamber 
B, and the piston is pushed extreme on the left side of the cylinder. During 
the next stroke, the entry of pressurized air is chamber B, the escape of air 
to the atmosphere is from chamber A, and the piston movement is toward 
the right.
The single and double-acting linear pneumatic actuators have key advan­
tages of:
• • compact design and reliable operation,
• • rugged construction and suitable for harsh environments,
• • easy maintenance, and
• • positioning accuracy and versatility of use and application.
These actuators have wide applications in industries where the load needs 
to be lifted or lowered, pushed or pulled, and positioned. The main industries 
using linear actuators are:
- 
material handling and packaging,
- 
food processing and pharmaceutical, and
- 
machine tool, automotive, and defence.

524 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
The rotary actuators have been designed and developed for the appli­
cations requiring a rotary motion or torque to control the speed and rotation 
of the attached equipment. In these actuators:
•• there is transformation of pneumatic, hydraulic or electric energy to 
mechanical rotation, and
•• the linear motion in one direction gives rise to a turning or angular move­
ment through a pre-set (defined) angle.
The pneumatic rotary actuators utilize the pressure of compressed air to 
generate the oscillatory rotary motion. For operation, the force is applied at a 
distance away from the axis of rotation and that causes a turning moment. The 
two most common configurations of pneumatic rotary actuators are:
1. Rotary vane actuator: The vane actuator consists of a vane mounted 
on a central shaft/spindle enclosed in a cylindrical chamber. A stream of 
pressurized air is made to impinge upon the vane and that push makes 
the spindle turn. There is a port through which the air behind the vane 
is released into the atmosphere. When the vane has turned through a 
specified angle, the airflow is reversed and the spindle rotates back to its 
original position. The stroke gets completed and subsequently, the pro­
cess is repeated.
The vane actuators are used for light loads.
2. Rack and pinion actuator: The rack and pinion actuator consist of a pis­
ton and rack that moves linearly and causes a pinion gear and output shaft 
to rotate. The rack is machined as a part of the piston rod of a double­
acting linear cylinder. The pinion gear meshes with the rack and turns the 
spindle as the piston moves when air pressure is applied to it. The spindle 
is at right angles to the piston and rotates clockwise, then counterclockwise 
as the linear cylinder completes its double action.
The rack and pinion actuators are used when more speed is required.
The key merits of pneumatic rotary actuators are: zero backlash, high 
force output, high repeatability and positioning accuracy, less wear and 
maintenance, and greater durability; ability to work effectively in hazardous 
environments.
These actuators are being successfully employed in the following indus­
tries for work with greater precision: robotics and CNC machines, aerospace 
and flight simulation, radar and monitoring systems, and medical industry.

10.15.4. Advantages and Limitations of Pneumatic Systems
• • Simplicity of components and ease of maintenance,
• • explosion-proof characteristics; freedom from the hazards,
• • relatively high power amplification for operating the final control elements,
• • relatively inexpensive power system; the abundance and free supply of air,
• • slow response of final control elements, and transmission lag, and

11.1. INTRODUCTION
The present-day applications for robots are much broader than most people 
realize. While the emphasis in robot development is on industrial robots, fac­
tories are not the only place where robots are used. Small, medium, and large 
companies in just about every industry are taking a fresh look at robots to see 
how this powerful technology can help them solve manufacturing challenges. 
In business offices and elsewhere, robots serve as mail delivery carts, promo­
tional or show robots, laboratory assistants, hospital orderlies, and window 
washers. In general, industrial robots are best used for jobs that are dirty, dull, 
dangerous, or difficult, the types of jobs that humans do most poorly.
Robots are used in a wide range of industrial applications. The first com­
mercial application of an industrial robot took place in 1961, when a robot was 
installed to load and unload a die-casting machine. This was an unpleasant 
task for human operators. Many robot applications took place in areas where 
a high degree of hazard or discomfort to humans existed, such as in welding, 
painting, and foundry operations. The earliest applications were in materials 
handling, spot welding, and spray painting. Robots were initially applied to 
jobs that were hot, heavy, and hazardous such as die-casting, forging, and spot 
welding. The reasons for using robots are:
1. Reduced costs—robots can perform tasks more economically than humans.
2. Improved productivity—robots are not only less expensive than human 
labor, but also have higher rates of output. This increase in productivity is 
due to robot’s slightly faster work pace but much is the result of the robot’s 
ability to work almost continually, without lunch breaks and rest periods.

530 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
3. Better quality—robots have a distinct advantage of being able to perform 
repetitive tasks with a higher degree of consistency, which in turn leads to 
improved product quality.
4. Elimination of hazardous tasks.
11.2. ROBOT CAPABILITIES
The three important capabilities of robots that make them useful for applica­
tions are:
• • Transport
• • Manipulation
• • Sensing
11.2.1 . Transport
Material handling is one of the basic operations, which is performed on an 
object as it passes through the manufacturing process. The object is moved 
from one location to another to be stored, machined, assembled, or packaged. 
The robot’s capability to acquire an object, move it through space, and release 
it makes it ideal for transport operations. Simple tasks such as part transfer 
from one conveyor to another may only require one- or two-dimensional 
movements, which are often performed by non-servo robots. Other parts han­
dling operations such as machine loading and unloading and packaging may 
be more complicated and require varying degrees of manipulative capability. 
Servo-controlled robots perform these operations.
11.2.2 . Manipulation
Another basic operation performed on an object as it is transformed from raw 
material to a finished product is processing, which generally requires some 
types of manipulation, i.e., workpieces are inserted, oriented, or twisted to be 
in proper position for machining, assembly, or some other operation. A robot’s 
capability to manipulate both parts and tooling make it very suitable for pro­
cessing applications. Examples in this regard include spot and arc welding, 
and spray painting.
11.2.3 . Sensing
A robot’s ability to react to its environment by means of sensory feedback 
is also important, particularly in applications like assembly and inspection.

Applications of Robots • 531
These sensory inputs may come from a variety of sensor types, including prox­
imity switches, force sensors, and machine vision systems.
In each application, one or more of the robot’s capabilities of transport, 
manipulation, or sensing is employed. These applications make a robot ideal 
for many applications now performed manually.

11.4. MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS
11.4.1. Welding
Perhaps the most popular applications of robots are in industrial welding. The 
repeatability, uniformity quality, and speed of robotic welding are unmatched. 
A robot performing a welding operation is shown in Figure 11.1. The two 
basic types of welding are spot welding and arc welding, although laser weld­
ing is done. Some environmental requirements should be considered for a 
successful operation. The automotive industry is a major user of robotic spot 
welders. The other major welding task performed by robots is arc or seam 
welding. In this application, two adjacent parts are joined together by fusing 
them, thereby creating a seam.
Why Should Robots be Used for Welding?
A welding process that contains repetitive tasks on similar pieces might be 
suitable for automation. The number of items of any type to be welded deter­
mines how difficult automating a process will be or not. If parts normally need 
adjustment to fit together correctly, or if joints to be welded are too wide or in 
different positions from piece to piece, automating the procedure will be dif-
ficult or impossible. Robots 
work well for repetitive 
tasks or similar pieces that 
involve welds in more than 
one axis. The most promi­
nent advantages of auto­
mated welding are precision 
and productivity. Robot 
welding improves weld 
repeatability. Once pro­
grammed correctly, robots 
will give precisely the same 
welds every time on work­
pieces of the same dimen­
sions and specifications.
FIGURE 11.1 Robot Performing Welding Operation
Arc Welding
Arc or fusion welding is considered a major growth area for the applica­
tion of robotics (Refer to Figure 11.2). The process is very hostile to the 

Applications of Robots • 533
FIGURE 11.2 Robots for Arc Welding
operator, generating 
noise, fumes, and intense 
light. Automation pro­
duces high quality welds 
with greater consistency 
and at a faster rate. In 
general, equipment for 
automatic arc welding is 
designed differently from 
that used for manual arc 
welding. Automatic arc 
welding normally involves 
high-duty cycles, and the 
welding equipment must 
be able to operate under
those conditions. In addition, the equipment components must have the nec­
essary features and controls to interface with the main control system.
A special kind of electrical power is required to make an arc weld. A welding 
machine, also known as a power source, provides the special power. All 
arc-welding processes use an arc welding gun or torch to transmit the welding 
current from a welding cable to the electrode. They also provide for shielding 
the weld area from the atmosphere. The nozzle of the torch is close to the 
arc and will gradually pick up spatter. A torch cleaner (normally automatic) 
is often used in robot arc welding systems to remove the spatter. All of the 
continuous electrode wire arc processes require an electrode feeder to feed 
the consumable electrode wire into the arc. The process is applied to automo­
bile subassemblies mainly for reasons of strength, low distortion, high-speed 
applications where one-sided access is required, and sealing.
Spot Welding
Automatic welding imposes specific demands on resistance welding equip­
ment. Often, equipment must be specially designed and welding procedures 
developed to meet robot-welding requirements. The spot welding robot 
(Refer to Figure 11.3) is the most important component of a robotized spot 
welding installation. Welding robots are available in various sizes, rated by 
payload capacity and reach. Robots are also classified by the number of axes. 
Spot welding involves applying a welding tool to some object, such as a car 
body, at specified discrete locations. A spot welding gun applies appropriate 
pressure and current to the sheets to be welded. This requires the robot

534 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
to move its hand (end effec­
tor) to a sequence of positions 
with sufficient accuracy to 
perform the task properly. It 
is desirable to move at a high 
speed to reduce cycle time, 
while avoiding collisions and 
excessive wear or damage to 
the robot.
There are different types 
of welding guns, used for dif­
ferent applications, available. 
An automatic weld-timer initi­
ates and times the duration of
FIGURE 11.3 Spot-welding Gun
current. A robot can repeatedly move the welding gun to each weld location 
and position it perpendicular to the weld seam. It can also replay programmed 
welding schedules. A manual-welding operator is less likely to perform as well 
because of the weight of the gun and monotony of the task. Spot welding 
robots should have six or more axes of motion and be capable of approaching 
points in the work envelope from any angle. This permits the robot to be flex­
ible in positioning a welding gun to weld an assembly. A robot easily performs 
some movements that are awkward for an operator, such as positioning the 
welding gun upside down.
Typical components of an integrated robotic spot welding cell are:
• • Spot welding robot
• • Spot welding gun
• • Weld timer
• • Electrode tip dresser
• • Spot welding swivel
Electron Beam Welding
Electron beam welding (EBW) is a fusion joining process that produces a 
weld by impinging a beam of high-energy electrons to heat the weld joint. 
Electrons are elementary atomic particles characterized by a negative 
charge and an extremely small mass. An electron beam-welding gun uses a 
high intensity electron beam to target a weld joint. The weld joint converts 
the electron beam to the heat input required to make a fusion weld. The 
electron beam is always generated in a high vacuum. The use of specially 
designed orifices separated a series of chambers at various levels of vacuum

Applications of Robots • 535
permits welding in medium and non-vacuum conditions. Although, high 
vacuum welding will provide maximum purity and high depth to width ratio 
welds. An electron beam robot welding system benefits the customer with 
a low contamination vacuum, narrow weld zone, uses low filler metal, and 
has low distortion.
MIG Welding
Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is frequently referred to as MIG welding. 
MIG welding is a commonly used high deposition rate welding process. Wire 
is continuously fed from a spool. MIG welding is therefore referred to as a 
semiautomatic welding process. Robotic systems are integrated towards MIG 
welding applications on a consistent basis. With advances in technology, and 
the benefits of a GMAW robotic cell, factories and job shops large and small 
are investing in a robot. Return on investment of a robotic system is possible 
after just a few years. MIG welding robots, or GMAW cells have many ben­
efits for customers. Robots are all position capable, have higher deposit rates 
than SMAW, need less operator skill, can perform longer welds without stop­
ping, and have minimal post weld cleaning.
TIG Welding
Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is frequently referred to as TIG welding. 
TIG welding is a commonly used high-quality welding process. TIG weld­
ing has become a popular choice of welding processes when high quality, 
precision welding is required. In TIG welding, an arc is formed between a 
non-consumable tungsten electrode and the metal being welded. Gas is fed 
through the torch to shield the electrode and molten weld pool. If filler wire is 
used, it is added to the weld pool separately. A TIG welding robot system has 
many benefits to customers. A robot produces high-quality welds, welds can 
be made with or without filler metal, variable precise controls, low distortion, 
and free of spatter.
11.4.2. Spray Painting
Another popular and efficient use for robots is in the field of spray painting. 
The consistency and repeatability of a robot’s motion have enabled near per­
fect quality while at the same time wasting no paint. The spray painting appli­
cations seems to epitomize the proper applications of robotics, relieving the 
human operator from a hazardous, albeit skillful job, while at the same time 
increasing work quality, uniformity, and cutting costs. In spraying applica­
tions, the robot manipulates a spray gun, which is used to apply some material

536 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
such as paint, stain, or plastic 
powder, to either a stationary 
or moving part. These coatings 
are applied to a wide variety 
of parts, including automotive 
body panels, appliances, and 
furniture. The spray-painting 
environment constitutes a fire 
hazard and is also dangerous 
to human worker’s respira­
tion. An early paint-spraying 
machine was built by Pollard in 
the 1930s. Today, this machine 
would be called an industrial
robot. Robots perform paint- 
FIGURE 11.4 Robots for Spray Painting
ing, coating, and dispensing
jobs in many industries today. Companies making products such as motorcy­
cles, bicycles, boats, jet skis, and cars are using painting automation to their 
advantage. Painting robots are generally equipped with six axes, three for the 
base motions and three for applicator orientation. Some units incorporate 
machine vision for guidance or to check application quality. Typically, these 
painting robots are electrically driven, rather than hydraulically or pneu­
matically powered. Advantages of using spray-painting robots (Figure 11.4) 
include:
1. Humans are removed from a hostile environment.
2. Less energy is needed for fresh air requirements and the need for protec­
tive clothing is reduced.
3. The quality of the painting is improved, reducing works and warranty 
costs.
4. Less paint and other materials are used.
5. Direct labor costs are reduced.
11.4.3. Machine Tending
Machine loading and unloading is a more complex application than basic 
material handling; for this application, the robot provides both manipula­
tive and transport capabilities (Refer to Figure 11.5). Robots can be used 
to grasp a workpiece from a supply point (e.g., a conveyor belt), transport

Applications of Robots • 537
it to a machine, orient 
it, and then insert it into 
the machine work holder. 
This may require that the 
robot signal the machine 
tool when the workpiece 
is in the correct position, 
so that the part can be 
secured in the work holder. 
The robot then releases 
the part and withdraws the 
arm so that machining can 
begin. Upon completion of 
the machining, the robot
FIGURE 11.5 Machine Tending Operation
unloads the workpiece and transfers it to another machine or conveyor. 
In a robotic cell, a single robot can service several machines. The single 
robot may be used to perform other operations while the machines are 
performing their primary functions. This may require that the robot be 
able to exchange end-effectors. Examples of machine tending functions 
include the following:
• • Exchanging machine tools, such as lathe and machining centers.
• • Stamping press loading and unloading.
• • Tending plastic injection molding machines.
• • Holding a part for a spot-welding operation.
• • Loading hot billets into forging presses.
• • Loading auto parts for grinding.
• • Loading gears onto CNC milling machines.
11.4.4. Forging
Robots have been applied in many different types of forging applications such 
as hammer forge operations, upsetter operations, roll forges, hot forming 
presses, and draw bench applications. In some cases, a robot acts as a forging 
machine operator or as a role of forge helper.
Forge hammers: Forging hammers are either hydraulic, steam hydraulic, 
or air driven. One-half of the forming die is on the anvil, and the other half of 
the die is on a ram that moves up and down, either under force by air, steam, 
or gravity. Under the control of an operator, the hammer is allowed to strike 
the part that is lying between the two dies a certain number of times. Depend­
ing on the observation of the forging operator, the operator determines when 
to take a part out of one die and moves it into the next. The function of the 

538 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
robot in this application can be to act as a forge helper. When working heavier 
parts, the robot can be used to load and unload furnaces and process the bil­
lets to the forging bed, where the operator can take over and process the parts 
through the various forming cycles. The robot then can maneuver the finished 
product to a trim operation.
11.4.5. Die Casting
Die casting involves forcing nonferrous metals into dies under high pressure 
to form parts of a desired shape. A typical die-casting task involves unloading 
a part from the die-casting machine, quenching the part, and then disposing 
of the part on a conveyor belt or into a bin. A possible robot task cycles in 
die-casting could include any of the following:
1. Alternately loading two or more die casting machines.
2. Unloading, quenching, trimming, and disposing of the part.
3. Unloading the die casting machine and preparing the dye for the next 
casting cycle. (This would require another gripper or attachment to spray 
the die.)
4. Loading an insert into the die casting machine and unloading the finished 
part.
11.4.6. Plastic Molding
The plastic molding process is typically used for thermoplastic materials. The 
material to be molded is supplied in a granule form and moved from a hop­
per to a cylinder, from which a plunger forces the granules through a heat 
chamber into the mold. Then, the mold half opens, and the products are with­
drawn. Many automotive parts are injection molded today, as well as many 
parts utilized in household appliances. The robot is typically employed to 
remove the part from the mold either by grasping a sprue and runner assem­
bly. A robot is typically used at an injection molding machine workcell where 
parts must not be dropped because of fragility, or where runs are so short that 
it is not economic to build a totally automatic mold to drop the part through 
the bottom of the machine.
11.4.7. Assembly
This is the process of robot manipulation of components, resulting in a fin­
ished assembled product. Assembly (Refer to Figure 11.6) is the process of 

Applications of Robots • 539
fitting and holding together 
parts and assemblies; gen­
erally performed by means 
of nuts, bolts, screws, fas­
teners, or snap-fit joints. 
Examples of assembly oper­
ations include:
• • Assembly of computer 
hard drives.
• • Insertion of lamps into 
instrument panels.
• • Insertion and placement 
of components onto 
printed circuit boards.
FIGURE 11.6 Robot Doing Assembly Operation
•• Automated assembly of small electric motors.
•• Furniture assembly.
11.4.8. Sealing/Dispensing
For dispensing applications, the robot manipulates a dispenser or gun to apply 
a material such as paint, adhesive, sealant, or washing solution to a stationary 
or moving part. Additional equipment used to complete a dispensing system
may include material containers, pumps, and regulators. It is very important 
that, for operations that involve the application of material that produces 
flammable or explosive fumes, the robot be sealed and have a system that 
purges the robot’s internal cavities. If the robot is not sealed and does not 
have a purging system, the possibility of the ignition of flammable or explosive 
fumes by the arcing of the robot’s internal electrical components (i.e., motors,
electronic components, and electrical connections) exists.
In applications where the part is on 
a conveyor line, the robot’s motion is 
coordinated with the motion of the con­
veyor. The manipulative capability of 
the robot is the primary function that 
makes a robot especially well suited for 
dispensing applications. The major ben­
efit of using a robot (Figure 17.7) for 
dispensing applications is that a robot 
provides uniform application of material
FIGURE 11.7 Robot Performing Sealing
(repeatability). Other benefits include 
Operation

540 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
a reduction of labor costs, coating material waste, and exposure of workers to 
hazardous materials.
Examples of dispensing applications include:
• • Painting parts on an automated line.
• • Application of adhesive and sealant to car bodies.
• • Application of thermal material to rockets.
• • Washing.
11.4.9. Inspection and Measurement
With a growing interest in product quality, the focus has been on zero defects. 
However, the human inspection system has somehow failed to achieve its 
objectives. Robot applications of vision systems have provided services in part 
location, completeness and correctness of assembly products, and collision 
detection during navigation. Machine vision applications require the ability to 
control both position and appearance in order to become a productive com­
ponent of an automated system.
11.4.10. Material Removal
Robotic material removal is a new application that has many uses in indus­
trial automation. The robot can grind, roll, and file metal parts to precision. 
The robotic system can remove material with quality every single time it is 
being used. The robot can work long hours and produce more throughputs. 
Robotics has become more affordable and many factories are looking to buy 
a robotic deburring cell for their operation. With expert engineering, any 
material removal application can bring your company a good return on invest­
ment (ROI). A material removal robot can be very beneficial to an opera­
tion because of the robot’s precision and quality. With a material removal 
robot system technology can be as precise as removing spots on jewellery. 
Material removal can be described as a deburring process, and can be inte­
grated to the most precise applications. Companies can automate a material 
removal process and gain many benefits.
11.4.11. Deburring
Robotic deburring is the use of a robot to remove burrs, sharp edges, 
or fins from metal parts. The robot can grind, roll, and file metal parts 
to precision (Refer to Figure 11.8). The robotic system can produce a 
deburring application, i.e., quality every single time it is being used. The 

Applications of Robots • 541
robot can work long hours and produce more 
throughputs. Robotics has become more 
affordable and many factories are looking to 
buy a robotic deburring cell for their opera­
tion. A robotic deburring cell can work long 
hours without fatigue removing rough edges. 
The quality of the process, as well as the long 
hours of a robotic cell is unmatched.
11.4.12. Grinding
Manual grinding is tough, dirty, and 
noisy work. The metal dust produced 
FIGURE 11.8 Robot Performing 
Deburring Operation
by grinding is harmful to employee’s 
eyes and lungs. Grinding robots
remove excess material from the 
surface of machined parts/products 
quickly and efficiently. A robot can 
perform work with more consist­
ency and higher quality results.
11.4.13. Drilling
With the automation of a drill­
ing robot system, companies can 
improve accuracy and repeatability. 
Drilling robots can work 24 hours 
a day without worries or fatigue 
thus enhancing operational output. 
(Refer to Figure 11.9.)
FIGURE 11.9 Robot Performing Drilling Operation
11.5. MATERIAL HANDLING APPLICATIONS
Using robots for handling materials are an essential component of today’s auto­
mated manufacturing systems. Material handling and logistics is the move­
ment, protection, storage, and control of materials and products throughout 
the process of their manufacture and distribution, consumption, and disposal. 
It is a repetitive operation; carried out often under unpleasant and hard work­
ing conditions, which requires little skill. This application makes use of the 

542 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
FIGURE 11.10 Material Handling Robot
robot’s capability to transport objects. Figure 11.10 shows a robot doing mate­
rial handling operation.
The term “material handling” 
covers a lot of ground in the world 
of robotics: tiny work pieces that 
people can’t handle very well, if at 
all; large, heavy parts like engine 
blocks and wheels; bulky items like 
bags and boxes; delicate and expen­
sive electronic components; medi­
cal equipment. The list is extensive. 
Robotic material-handling applica­
tions range from tending injection­
molding machines and machine tools, 
to reorienting parts between pro­
cesses, to packaging and palletizing.
By fitting the robot with an appropriate end-effector (e.g., gripper), the 
robot can grasp the object that needs to be moved. The robot may be mounted 
either stationary on the floor or on a traversing unit, enabling it to move from 
one workstation to another. The robot can also be ceiling mounted. The pri­
mary benefits of using robots for material handling are reduction of direct 
labor costs and removal of humans from tasks that may be hazardous, tedious, 
or fatiguing. Also, the use of robots for moving fragile objects results in less 
damage to parts during handling. Robots that are used for material handling 
can interface with other material handling equipment such as containers, con­
veyors, guided vehicles, monorails, and automated storage/retrieval systems. 
A handling process consists of eight sequences:
1. Transfer of the robot arm up the workpiece
2. Fine motion approaching the workpiece
3. Grasping
4. Fine motion uprising the workpiece
5. Transfer the workpiece to the desired position
6. Fine motion down to the destination position
7. Release the workpiece
8. Fine motion upward
The gripping sequence is the more delicate part of handling material. The 
gripper’s and the robot’s positions have to be checked for collision with other 

Applications of Robots • 543
objects in the environment. The limitation of the robot’s workspace can also 
be a problem for all other planning sequences of the handling.
The following are examples of material handling applications:
• • Transferring parts from one conveyor to another.
• • Transferring parts from a processing line to a conveyor.
• • Loading bins and fixtures for subsequent processing.
• • Moving parts from a warehouse to a machine.
• • Transporting explosive devices.
• • Transfer of parts from a machine to an overhead conveyor.
• Parts Transferring
Parts transferring refer to removing parts from pallets and placing them in 
bins or on conveyor belts, or removing parts from bins and conveyor belts and 
placing them on pallets. Part transfer applications are generally referred to as 
material handling robot applications. With the advancements in end-of-arm 
tooling, and technology companies are taking a closer look into part transfer
robotics. As robots become more afford­
able, and competition becomes fierce, 
many companies will look into a part 
transfer robot to automate their press 
operation. An integrated part transfer 
robot (Refer to Figure 11.11) system is 
easy to install and brings many benefits 
to our customers. A robot moves a part 
in and out of a press, with ease and no 
fatigue. The robot can transfer a part 24 
hours a day, giving more flexibility to the
FIGURE 11.11 Robot used for Parts
Transferring
company.
• Palletizing
Palletizing is the act of loading or unloading material onto pallets. A robotic 
palletizing system (Refer to Figure 11.12) allows more flexibility to run more 
products for longer periods of time. With the advancements in end-of-arm 
tooling, robot-palletizing workcells have been integrated in many factories. 
The use of robots in palletizing is a popular material-handling operation, par­
ticularly where more than one type of packaging is being handled. The news­
paper industry has been particularly hard hit by increased labor costs. Part of 
the solution to this problem was to use robots like Cincinnati Milacron Robot

544 • M echanical Engineering and Mechatronics Handbook
being used to palletize advertising 
inserts for a newspaper. Robotic pal­
letizing technology can help with 
productivity and profitability. The 
robotic workcells can be integrated 
towards any project. The savings of 
using a robot for longer hours with­
out fatigue is always a consideration 
for plant managers. Robots have 
become more affordable in recent 
years and can be paid off in just a few 
years worth of work. Many factories,
FIGURE 11.12 Robots Performing Palletizing 
Operation
food processing plants, and palletizing plants have automated their applica­
tion with a palletizing robot.
• Pick and Place Operations
Industrial robots also perform what are referred to as pick and place oper­
ations. Pick and place is the name commonly given to the operation of 
picking up a part and placing it appropriately for subsequent operations. 
Pick-and-place operations have some requirements. The part must not be 
dropped. It must be held securely enough to prevent it from slipping in 
the gripper but gently enough to avoid damage. In addition, care must be 
taken to avoid disturbing the part during approach and departure. A pick 
and place robot is a material handling robot that can work 24 hours a day 
without worries or fatigue. The consistent output of a robotic system along 
with quality and repeatability are unmatched. Among the most common of 
these operations is loading and unloading pallets, used across a broad range 
of industries. This requires relatively complex programming, as the robot 
must sense how full a pallet is and adjust its placements or removals accord­
ingly. Robots have been vital in pick and place operations in the casting of 
metals and plastics. In the die casting of metals, for instance, productivity 
using the same die-casting machinery has increased up to three times, the 
result of robots’ greater speed, strength, and ability to withstand heat in 
parts removal operations.
Pick and place robotic cells are being integrated into factory floors all over 
the world. They are a more favorable solution to production lines because 
they move at faster speeds and have more flexibility than ever before. Man­
agers are realizing the long-term savings with a pick and place robotic work­
cell rather than the operation they are currently doing. An increase in output 

Applications of Robots • 545
with a material handling robotic system has saved factories money. With the 
advancements in technology, and robotics becoming more affordable pick 
and place robotic cells are being installed for many different pick and place 
automation applications.
• Machine Tool Loading and Unloading
Machine loading and unloading applications are generally referred to as mate­
rial handling. With the advancements in end-of-arm tooling, and technology, 
companies are taking a closer look into the benefits of machine loading robot­
ics. As robots become more affordable, and competition becomes fierce, many 
companies will look into machine loading robotics to automate their operation. 
A robot can be given a longer reach than a human worker and might be able 
to load and unload more then one machine. An integrated machine-loading 
robot is easy to install and brings many benefits to our customers. A robot 
loads a part into the press, with ease and no fatigue. The robot can load parts 
24 hours a day, giving more flexibility to the company.
• Order Picking
A robot order picking system can be programmed to do multiple tasks. With the 
advancements in end-of-arm tooling, order-picking application can be used in 
most companies. A robotic system benefits a firm with flexibility, repetitive 
quality and no fatigue. A robot order picking process would most likely be 
associated with material handling.
11.6. CLEANROOM ROBOTS
Cleanroom robots are specifically sealed and isolated from dust or any kind 
of air particles to perform tasks in an isolated atmosphere. Mostly used
in medical or lab application to han­
dle parts, tend machinery, and dispense 
drugs. A robot is a valuable tool in a clean 
room setting because it can provide the 
same quality results without error for 
a long period of time. A robotic system 
allows laboratories and other clean room 
robot applications much flexibility. (Refer 
to Figure 11.13.)
