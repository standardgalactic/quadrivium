Author’s Acknowledgments
Many hard-working people at Wiley Publishing in Indiana had a hand in this
book, and I would like to thank all of them. I am especially grateful to Steve
Hayes for giving me the opportunity to write this and other For Dummies
books.
Many thanks as well go to Jean Rogers, this book’s project editor, for her dili-
gence and grace under pressure, and Jennifer Riggs and Mary Lagu for their
copy editing skills. Technical editors Joyce Nielsen and Lee Musik made sure
that all the explanations in this book are indeed accurate, and I would like to
thank them for their excellent work and suggestions for improving this book.
I would also like to give a special thanks to Joe Stockman for his work in Book
VI about Access. I would also like to thank Rich Tennant for the witty car-
toons you will find on the pages of this book and Richard Shrout for writing
the index. Many other people at the Wiley office in Indianapolis gave their all
to this book; their names are listed on the following page in the publisher’s
acknowledgements.
Finally, I owe my family — Sofia, Henry, and Addie — a debt for tolerating my
vampire-like working hours and eerie demeanor at the breakfast table. How
will I ever repay you?

Introduction
T
his book is for users of Office 2007 who want to get to the heart of the
program without wasting time. Don’t look in this book to find out how
the different programs in the Office suite work. Look in this book to find out
how you can get your work done better and faster with these programs.
I show you everything you need to make the most of the different Office pro-
grams. On the way, you have a laugh or two. No matter how much or how
little skill you bring to the table, the guidance of this book will make you a
better, more proficient, more confident user of the Office programs.
What’s in This Book, Anyway?
Office 2007 is radically different from its predecessors — you can tell as
soon as you open your first Office 2007 program. Office has been given a
facelift. The menus and toolbars that used to appear along the top of the
program windows are gone and have been replaced by command tabs and a
Ribbon. Instead of opening menus, you click buttons or make gallery choices.
Behind the scenes, the makers of Office have made many features — charts,
diagrams, shapes, and others — available to all or most of the programs.
The Office suite offers more commands and features than ever before. It
gives you many, many opportunities to exercise your creativity and com-
puter prowess.
This book is your guide to making the most of the Office programs. It’s jam-
packed with how-to’s, advice, shortcuts, and tips. Here’s a bare outline of
the eight parts of this book:
✦Book I: Common Office Tools: Looks into the many commands and fea-
tures that are common to all or several of the Office programs. Master
the material in Book I and you’re well on your way to mastering all the
programs. Book I explains handling text, the proofing tools, charts, dia-
grams, and tables. It explores speed techniques that can make you more
productive in most of the Office programs, as well as how to draw and
manipulate lines, shapes, clip-art, and other so-called objects.
✦Book II: Word 2007: Explains the numerous features in Office’s word
processor, including how to create documents from letters to reports.
Use the techniques described here to turn Word into a desktop-publishing
program and quickly dispatch office tasks such as mass-mailings. You
also discover how to get Word’s help in writing indexes, bibliographies,
and other items of interest to scholars.

✦Book III: Outlook 2007: Shows you how to send and receive e-mail mes-
sages and files, as well as track tasks, maintain an address book, and
keep a calendar with Outlook. If you’re one of those people who receive
numerous e-mail messages each day, you’ll be delighted to discover all
the ways to track and manage e-mail — and junk e-mail — in Outlook.
✦Book IV: PowerPoint 2007: Demonstrates how to construct a meaning-
ful presentation that makes the audience say, “Wow!” Included in Book
IV are instructions for making a presentation livelier and more original,
both when you create your presentation and when you deliver it.
✦Book V: Excel 2007: Shows the many different ways to crunch the num-
bers with the bean counter in the Office suite. Along the way, you find
out how to design worksheets that are easy to read and understand, 
use data-validation rules to cut down on entry mistakes, and analyze
your data. You find out just how useful Excel can be for financial analy-
ses, data tracking, and forecasting.
✦Book VI: Access 2007: Describes how to create a relational database for
storing information, as well as query the database for information and
gather information into meaningful reports. Don’t be frightened by the
word “database.” You’ll be surprised to discover how useful Access can
be in your work.
✦Book VII: Publisher 2007: Shows how to create brochures, pamphlets,
newsletters, and other publications with the “print shop in a can.”
✦Book VIII: Office 2007 — One Step Beyond: For people who want to take
full advantage of Office, Book VIII delves into customizing the Office 
programs, recording and running macros, and collaborating with the 
SharePoint Services software. It looks into some auxiliary programs that
come with Office, including OneNote, Picture Manager, and Clip Organizer.
It also looks into alternative ways to distribute your work — in a blog or a
Web page, for example.
What Makes This Book Different
You’re holding in your hands a computer book designed to make mastering
the Office programs as easy and comfortable as possible. Besides the fact
that this book is easy to read, it’s different from other books about Office.
Read on to see why.
Easy-to-look-up information
This book is a reference, which means that readers have to be able to find
instructions quickly. To that end, I have taken great pains to make sure that
the material in this book is well organized and easy to find. The descriptive

Foolish Assumptions
3
headings help you find information quickly. The bulleted and numbered lists
make following instructions simpler. The tables make options easier to
understand.
I want you to be able to look down the page and see in a heading or list the
name of the topic that concerns you. I want you to be able to find instruc-
tions quickly. Compare the table of contents in this book to the book next to
it on the bookstore shelf. The table of contents in this book is put together
better and presents topics so that you can find them in a hurry.
A task-oriented approach
Most computer books describe what the software is, but this book explains
how to complete tasks with the software. I assume that you came to this
book because you want to know how to do something — print form letters,
create a worksheet, or query a database. You came to the right place. This
book describes how to get tasks done.
Meaningful screen shots
The screen shots in this book show only the part of the screen that illustrates
what is being explained in the text. When instructions refer to one part of the
screen, only that part of the screen is shown. I took great care to make sure
that the screen shots in this book serve to help you understand the Office
programs and how they work. Compare this book to the next one on the
bookstore shelf. Do you see how clean the screen shots in this book are?
Foolish Assumptions
Please forgive me, but I made one or two foolish assumptions about you, the
reader of this book. I assumed that:
✦You own a copy of Office 2007, the latest edition of Office, and you have
installed it on your computer.
✦You use a Windows operating system, preferably either Windows XP or
Windows Vista. All people who have the Windows operating system
installed on their computers are invited to read this book, though.
✦You are kind to foreign tourists and small animals.

Conventions Used in This Book
4
Conventions Used in This Book
I want you to understand all the instructions in this book, and in that spirit,
I’ve adopted a few conventions.
Where you see boldface letters or numbers in this book, it means to type the
letters or numbers. For example, “Enter 25 in the Percentage text box”
means to do exactly that: Enter the number 25.
To show you how to step through command sequences, I use the ➪symbol.
For example, you can click the Office button and choose Print➪Print Preview
to see what the file you’re working on will look like when you print it. The ➪
symbol is just a shorthand method of saying “Choose Print and then choose
Print Preview.”
To give most commands, you can press combinations of keys. For example,
pressing Ctrl+S saves the file you’re working on. In other words, you can hold
down the Ctrl key and press the S key to save a file. Where you see Ctrl+, Alt+,
or Shift+ and a key name or key names, press the keys simultaneously.
Yet another way to give a command is to click a button. When I tell you to
click a button, you see a small illustration of the button in the margin of this
book (unless the button is too large to fit in the margin). The button shown
here is the Save button, the one you can click to save a file.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you get the most out of this book, I’ve placed icons here and there.
Here’s what the icons mean:
Next to the Tip icon, you can find shortcuts and tricks of the trade to make
your visit to Office Land more enjoyable.
Where you see the Warning icon, tread softly and carefully. It means that
you’re about to do something that you may regret later.
When I explain a juicy little fact that bears remembering, I mark it with a
Remember icon. When you see this icon, prick up your ears. You’ll discover
something that you need to remember throughout your adventures with
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or the other Office program I’m demystifying.

Good Luck, Reader!
5
When I am forced to describe high-tech stuff, a Technical Stuff icon appears
in the margin. You don’t have to read what’s beside the Technical Stuff icons
if you don’t want to, although these technical descriptions often help you
understand how a software feature works.
Good Luck, Reader!
If you have a comment about this book, a question, or a shortcut you 
would like to share with me, address an e-mail message to me at this address:
weverka@sbcglobal.net. Be advised that I usually can’t answer e-mail
right away because I’m too darned busy. I do appreciate comments and
questions, however, because they help me pass my dreary days in captivity.

In this chapter, you meet the Office programs and discover speed tech-
niques for opening programs and files. I show you around the new Office
interface — the one that everybody’s been talking about. I also show you
how to save files, what the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format is
all about, and how to clamp a password on a file.
A Survey of Office Programs
Office 2007, sometimes called the Microsoft Office Suite, is a collection of
computer programs. Why is it called Office? I think because the people who
invented it wanted to make software for completing tasks that need doing in
a typical office. When you hear someone talk about “Office” or the “Office
software,” they’re talking about several different programs:
✦Word: A word processor for writing letters, reports, and so on. A Word
file is a document (see Book II).
✦Outlook: A personal information manager, scheduler, and e-mailer (see
Book III).

Starting an Office Program
10
✦PowerPoint: A means of creating computer presentations to give in front
of audiences. A PowerPoint file is a presentation, or sometimes a slide
show (see Book IV).
✦Excel: A number cruncher for performing numerical analyses. An Excel
file is a workbook (see Book V).
✦Access: A database management program (see Book VI).
✦Publisher: A means of creating desktop-publishing files — pamphlets,
notices, newsletters, and the like (see Book VII).
Office 2007 also comes with the Clip Organizer, for managing and inserting
clip-art images in files, the Picture Manger, for inserting pictures and keeping
track of the media files on your computer, and in some editions, OneNote
2007, a program for taking notes and brainstorming. These programs are
explained in Book VIII.
If you’re new to Office, don’t be daunted by the prospect of having to study
so many different computer programs. The programs have much in common.
You find the same commands throughout Office. For example, the method of
choosing fonts is the same in Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher.
Creating diagrams and charts works the same in Word, PowerPoint, and
Excel. Book I describes tasks that are common to all or most of the Office
programs. Master one Office program and you’re well on your way to master-
ing the next.
Starting an Office Program
Unless you start an Office program, you can’t create a document, construct 
a worksheet, or make a database. Many have tried to undertake these tasks
with mud and paper-mâché without starting a program first, but all have
failed. Here are the various and sundry ways to start an Office program:
✦The old-fashioned way: Click the Start button, choose All Programs➪
Microsoft Office, and then choose the program’s name on the submenu.
✦The Start menu: Click the program’s name on the Start menu, as shown
in Figure 1-1. The Start menu is the menu you see when you click the
Start button. By placing a program’s name on the Start menu, you can
open the program simply by clicking the Start button and then clicking
the program’s name. To place an Office program on the Start menu:
1. Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪Microsoft Office.
2. Move the pointer over the program’s name on the submenu, but
don’t click to select the program’s name.

3. Right-click the program’s name and choose Pin to Start Menu on
the shortcut menu that appears.
To remove a program’s name from the Start menu, right-click the
name and choose Remove from This List.
✦Desktop shortcut icon: Double-click the program’s shortcut icon (see
Figure 1-1). A shortcut icon is an icon you can click to do something in a
hurry. By creating a shortcut icon on the Windows desktop, you can
double-click the icon and immediately start an Office program. To place
an Office shortcut icon on the desktop:
1. Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪Microsoft Office.
2. Move the pointer over the program’s name on the submenu, but
don’t click the program’s name.
3. Right-click the program’s name and choose Send To➪Desktop
(Create Shortcut) on the shortcut menu that appears.
✦Quick Launch toolbar: Click a shortcut icon on the Quick Launch tool-
bar, as shown in Figure 1-1. The Quick Launch toolbar appears on the
Windows taskbar and is easy to find. Wherever your work takes you, you

can see the Quick Launch toolbar and click its shortcut icons to start
programs. Create a shortcut icon and follow these steps to place a copy
of it on the Quick Launch toolbar:
1. Click the shortcut icon to select it.
2. Hold down the Ctrl key.
3. Drag the shortcut icon onto the Quick Launch toolbar.
To change an icon’s position on the toolbar, drag it to the left or the
right. To remove an icon, right-click it and choose Delete.
Yet another way to start an Office program is to make the program start
automatically whenever you turn on your computer. If you’re the president
of the Office Fan Club and you have to run, for example, Outlook each time
your computer starts, create an Outlook shortcut icon and copy it into this
folder if your computer runs Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Start Menu\Programs\
Startup
Copy the shortcut icon into this folder if your computer runs Windows Vista:
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\
Start Menu\Programs\Startup
Finding Your Way around the New Office Interface
If you’re friendly with previous editions of Office, you probably got a shock
when you opened this new edition for the first time. The new Office looks dif-
ferent. Gone is the main menu across the top of the screen and the many
toolbars. The entire suite of programs has been given a facelift.
Why the change? The mighty muck-a-mucks of Microsoft decided that the
number of features in Office had outgrown the old menu-and-toolbar struc-
ture. Users of Office had to take too many steps — they had to open too
many menus and fiddle with too many toolbars — to find features and com-
mands. Microsoft thought that features and commands were going unused
because they were buried too deeply in the menu-and-toolbar structure.
To bring all the features and commands into the open, Microsoft designed a
new interface for most of the Office programs. Interface — also called the
user interface — is a computer term that describes how a software program
presents itself to the people who use it (and you probably thought interface
meant two people kissing). The new Office interface is daunting at first because
it’s hard to tell where to find commands. It’s hard to know where to begin.
However, I’m happy to report, having spent a lot of time with Office in the

course of writing this book, that I like the new interface. Maybe I’m suffering
from Stockholm Syndrome (a condition that makes kidnap victims fall in love
with their kidnappers), but I’ve grown to like the interface.
These pages give you a quick tour of the new Office interface and explain
what the various parts of the interface are. Click along with me as I describe
the interface and you’ll know what’s what by the time you finish reading
these pages.
The Office button
In the upper-left corner of the window is the Office button, as shown in
Figure 1-2. Clicking this button opens a menu similar to the File menu in
most computer programs. The Office menu offers commands for creating,
opening, and saving files, as well as doing other file-management tasks.
The Quick Access toolbar
No matter where you travel in an Office program, you see the Quick Access
toolbar in the upper-left corner of the screen next to the Office button (see
Figure 1-2). This toolbar offers three necessary buttons: the all-important
Save button, the trusty Undo button, and the convenient Repeat button. You
can place more buttons on the Quick Access toolbar as well as move the
toolbar lower in the window. I explain how to customize the Quick Access
toolbar in Book VIII, Chapter 1.
By the way, Microsoft says you can call the Quick Access toolbar the QAT, or
“kwat,” but I don’t think you should do that. Others might think you have
indigestion.
The Ribbon and its tabs
Across the top of the screen is the Ribbon, an assortment of different tabs;
click a tab to undertake a task. For example, click the Home tab to format
Office button

text; click the Insert tab to insert a table or chart. Figure 1-3 shows what you
see in Word when you click the Home, Insert, and Page Layout tabs on the
Ribbon. Each tab offers a different set of buttons and galleries.
Practically speaking, your first step when you start a new task is to click a
tab on the Ribbon. Knowing which tab to click takes awhile, but the names of
tabs — Home, Insert, View, and so on — hint as to which commands you find
when you visit a tab.
How many buttons appear on some of the tabs depends on the size of your
monitor screen. On narrow 800 x 600 screens, Office sometimes can’t find
enough room to display all the buttons on a tab, so it presents you with a
primary button to click in order to get to the other buttons. Throughout this
book, I endeavor to tell you which button you click if your monitor has a
narrow as well as a wide screen, but if the instructions in this book tell you
to click a button and you don’t see it, you have to click a primary button
first. Look around for the primary button and then click it to get to the sec-
ondary button.
To make the Ribbon disappear and get more room to view slides, right-click
the Ribbon and then choose Minimize the Ribbon on the shortcut menu. To
see the Ribbon again, right-click a tab name or the Quick Access toolbar and
then deselect Minimize the Ribbon on the shortcut menu. While the Ribbon
is minimized, you can click a tab name to display a tab.

Context-sensitive tabs
Sorry for dropping the term context-sensitive on you. I usually steer clear of
these horrid computer terms, but I can’t help it this time because Microsoft
calls some tabs context-sensitive, and by golly, I have to call them that, too.
To keep the Ribbon from getting too crowded with tabs, some tabs appear
only in context — they appear on the Ribbon after you insert or click some-
thing. In Figure 1-4, for example, I inserted a table, and two additional tabs,
the Design and the Layout tab, appear on the Ribbon under the heading
Table Tools. These context-sensitive tabs offer commands for designing and
laying out tables. When I click the (Table Tools) Design tab, as Figure 1-4
shows, I see commands for putting colors and borders on tables. The idea
behind context-sensitive tabs is to direct you to the commands you need
and exclude all other commands.
If you’re looking for a tab on the Ribbon but can’t find it, the tab is probably
context-sensitive. You have to insert or select an item to make some tabs
appear on the Ribbon. Context-sensitive tabs appear on the right side of the
Ribbon under a heading with Tools in its name. In Figure 1-4, for example, the
Design and Layout context-sensitive tabs pertain to handling tables, so they
appear under the Table Tools heading.
Select or insert an item. . .
 
. . .and you get context-sensitive tabs.
Figure 1-4:
After you

Finding Your Way around the New Office Interface
16
Context-sensitive tab names can be confusing because sometimes they
repeat the names of other tabs. When I refer to a context-sensitive tab name
in this book, I sometimes include its Tools heading in parentheses if there is
any confusion about which tab I’m referring to. In PowerPoint, for example,
the Design tab that always appears on the Ribbon is the Design tab, but the
context-sensitive Design tab is the (Table Tools) Design tab.
The anatomy of a tab
All tabs are different in terms of the commands they offer, but all are the
same insofar as how they present commands. On every tab, you find groups
and buttons. Some tabs also offer galleries. Groups, buttons, galleries —
what’s up with that?
Groups
Commands on each tab are organized into groups. For example, the Home
tab in Excel is organized into several groups, including the Clipboard, Font,
Alignment, Number, Cells, and Editing group, as shown in Figure 1-5. Group
names appear below the buttons and galleries on tabs.
Groups serve two purposes:
✦Groups tell you what the buttons and galleries above their names are
used for. On the Home tab in Excel, for example, the buttons on the Font
group are for formatting text. Read group names to help find the com-
mand you need.
✦Many groups have group buttons that you can click to open a dialog box
or task pane (officially, Microsoft calls these little buttons dialog box
launchers, but let’s act like grownups, shall we?). Group buttons are
found to the right of group names. Moving the pointer over a group
button opens a pop-up help box with a description and picture of the
dialog box or task pane that appears when the button is clicked.

17
As with tabs on the Ribbon, group buttons are context-sensitive (there’s that
term again!). Whether you can click a group button to open a dialog box or
task pane depends on the context in which you’re working. Sometimes the
buttons are grayed out because they don’t pertain to the task you’re cur-
rently doing.
Buttons
Go to any tab and you find buttons of all shapes and sizes. Square buttons
and rectangular buttons. Big and small buttons. Buttons with labels and but-
tons without labels. Is there any rhyme or reason to these button shapes and
sizes? No, there isn’t.
What matters isn’t a button’s shape or size, but whether a down-pointing
arrow appears on its face:
✦A button with an arrow: Click a button with an arrow and you get a
drop-down list. Sometimes the drop-down list presents still more but-
tons. Yet again, on these drop-down lists, clicking a button with an arrow
gets you another drop-down list, but clicking a button without an arrow
opens a dialog box or task pane.
✦A button without an arrow: Click a button without an arrow and you
open a dialog box or task pane.
✦A hybrid button with an arrow: Some buttons serve a dual purpose as
a button and a drop-down list. By clicking the symbol on the top half of
the button, you complete an action; by clicking the arrow on the bottom
half of the button, you open a drop-down list. On the Home tab, for
example, clicking the top half of the Paste button pastes what is on the
Clipboard into your file, but clicking the bottom half of the button opens
a drop-down list with Paste options.
You can find out what clicking a button does by moving the pointer over it.
You see a pop-up description of what the button is for.
Galleries
Built into some tabs are galleries like the one shown in Figure 1-6. The
gallery in the figure pertains to charts: the Chart Styles gallery is for format-
ting charts. A gallery presents you with visual options for changing an item.
Rather than visit numerous dialog boxes and task panes, you can select a
gallery choice and give many commands at once. The item on your page or
slide — the table, chart, or diagram, for example — changes in appearance
when you move the pointer over different gallery choices.

Finding Your Way around the New Office Interface
18
To view and make choices on a gallery:
✦Click a scroll arrow to see more gallery choices on the tab.
✦Click the More button (see Figure 1-6) to open the gallery choices in a
drop-down list and see many choices at once.
Galleries are unique because they present, in the form of visual choices, the
results of commands, not command names. All you have to do is glance at a
gallery option to see what selecting the option does to your chart, table,
shape, or whatever. By selecting gallery options, you can get very sophisti-
cated layouts and formats without having to be a design expert or know
your way to all the layout and formatting commands. You can experiment
with formats and layouts in a matter of seconds merely by hovering the
pointer over gallery choices (see “Live previewing,” the next section in this
chapter).
Live previewing
This new edition of Office comes with live previewing, a welcome and
inspired innovation. Thanks to live previewing, you can see the results of a
menu or gallery choice before actually making the choice.
Click the More button to open the gallery in a drop-down list.
Figure 1-6:
Galleries

Book I
Chapter 1
Office Nuts

19
Here’s how live previewing works: Move the pointer over an option in a
gallery or drop-down list and glance at the screen. You can see the results of
selecting the option. For example, you see a different font or shape color.
You can judge whether choosing the option is worthwhile without choosing
the option first. Live previewing liberates you from repeatedly choosing
commands, backtracking, and trying again until you get it right.
Follow these steps to experiment with live previewing:
1. Enter some text.
2. Click and drag the pointer over the text to select it.
Drag means to hold down the mouse button while sliding the pointer
over the text.
3. Click the Home tab.
4. Open the Font drop-down list.
5. Slowly move your pointer over the options in the Font drop-down list.
When the pointer comes to different font names, the text on your slide
changes fonts.
Mini Toolbars
A Mini Toolbar is a ghost-like menu that appears on-screen to help you do a
task, as shown in Figure 1-7. Move the pointer over the Mini Toolbar, and it
ceases being ghost-like, as Figure 1-7 demonstrates. Now you can choose an
option from a drop-down list or click a button on the Mini Toolbar to com-
plete a task.
The Mini Toolbar, as shown in Figure 1-7, appears when you select text and
then move the pointer over selected text. Don’t be frightened of these ghost-
like Mini Toolbars. Keep your eyes open for them. Mini Toolbars are very
convenient, and they save you the trouble of going to a different tab to com-
plete a task.

Office 2007 for keyboard lovers
People who like to give commands by pressing keyboard shortcuts may well
ask, “Where are the keyboard shortcuts in the new edition of Office?” The
answer is: They’re still there. All keyboard shortcuts — press Ctrl+B for
boldface text and Ctrl+U for underline text, for example — work the same
way as they did in earlier editions of Office.
Right-clicking to open a shortcut menu
Similar to Mini Toolbars are the shortcut menus
you get when you right-click. Right-click means
to click the right — not the left — mouse button.
Right-click just about anywhere and you get a
shortcut menu of some kind. The shortcut
menus differ, depending on what you right-click.
Right-clicking sometimes gets you to the com-
mand you need without having to select a 
different tab. I know I’ve been right-clicking
more than usual in this new edition of Office to
keep from switching from tab to tab on the
Ribbon.
When you right-click text, the Mini Toolbar
appears at the top or bottom of the shortcut
menu. To see what I mean, compare this illus-
tration to Figure 1-7.

To find out the keyboard shortcuts for opening and choosing menu com-
mands, press the Alt key. Letters — they’re called KeyTips — appear on tab
names. After you press the Alt key, follow these instructions to make use of
KeyTips:
✦Go to a tab: Press a KeyTip on a tab to visit a tab. As shown in Figure 1-8,
letters, numbers, and combinations of letters and numbers appear on
the commands.
✦Make KeyTips appear on menu items: Press a KeyTip on a button or
gallery to make KeyTips appear on menu items.
Saving Your Files
Soon after you create a new file, be sure to save it. And save your file from
time to time while you work on it as well. Until you save your work, it rests in
the computer’s electronic memory (RAM), a precarious location. If a power
outage occurs or your computer stalls, you lose all the work you did since
the last time you saved your file. Make it a habit to save files every ten min-
utes or so or when you complete an important task.
To save a file:
✦Click the Save button.
✦Press Ctrl+S.
✦Click the Office button and then choose Save on the drop-down list.
I wish that saving was always just a matter of clicking the Save button, but
saving your work also entails declaring where you prefer to save files, saving
files for use in earlier versions of the Office programs, and saving
AutoRecovery files. Better read on.
Declaring where you like to save files
When you attempt to save a file for the first time in the Save As dialog box,
Office shows you the contents of the My Documents folder (in Windows XP)
Figure 1-8:
Press the
Alt key to
see KeyTips.

Saving Your Files
22
or the Document folder (in Windows Vista) on the assumption that you keep
most of your files in that folder. The My Documents folder is the center of
the universe as far as Office is concerned, but perhaps you keep the majority
of your files in a different folder. How would you like to see it first in the Save
As and Open dialog boxes?
To direct Office to the folder you like best and make it appear first in the
Save As and Open dialog boxes, follow these steps:
1. In Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, click the Office button and then
choose the Options button at the bottom of the drop-down list (in
Word, for example, choose Word Options).
You see the Options dialog box.
2. Select the Save category.
Figure 1-9 shows the topmost options in this category.
3. In the Default File Location text box, enter the address of the folder
where you prefer to keep your files.
For example, if you’re fond of keeping files in the My Stuff folder on the 
C drive of your computer, enter C:\My Stuff, or click the Browse button
and then select the My Stuff folder in the Modify Location dialog box.
4. Click OK.
Saving files for use in earlier versions 
of an Office program
Not everyone is a proud owner of Office 2007. Before you pass along a file to
a co-worker who has an earlier version of Office, save your document so that
your co-worker can open it. Files are stored in the XML format in Office 2007
(later in this chapter, “Understanding the New Office XML Format” explains
XML). Unless you save your file for earlier versions of Office, people who
don’t have the latest version can’t open them.

Saving a file for use in Office 97–2003
Follow these steps to save a file so that someone with Office 97, 2000, XP, or
2003 can open it:
1. Click the Office button.
2. Choose Save As➪Program Name 97–2003 Format.
You see the Save As dialog box.
3. Enter a new name for the file, if necessary.
4. Click the Save button.
Files saved in the 97–2003 format have a different file extension. Instead of a
four-letter file extension that ends in x, they have a three-letter extension
without the x.
Before you save your file for an earlier version of the program you’re work-
ing in, you can find out if anything will be lost when you save the file. Click
the Office button and choose Prepare➪Run Compatibility Checker. You see
the Compatibility Checker dialog box. It tells you whether the earlier version
of the program can’t handle something in your file.
Saving files by default for earlier versions of Office
If you’re way ahead of the pack and you always have to save files in a differ-
ent format so that co-workers can open them, make the different format the
default format for saving all your files. That way, you don’t have to choose a
new format whenever you pass off a file to a co-worker.
Follow these steps to change the default format for saving files:
1. Click the Office button and choose Options on the drop-down list.
The Options dialog box appears.
2. Select the Save category (refer to Figure 1-9).
3. In the Save Files in This Format drop-down list, choose the 97–2003
format.
4. Click OK.
Remember that you made 97–2003 the default format for saving files.
Someday soon, your co-workers will catch up with you. They will acquire
Office 2007. And when that happens, return to the Options dialog box
and choose the most up-to-date format.

Saving Your Files

Saving AutoRecovery information
To insure against data loss due to computer and power failures, Office saves
files on its own every ten minutes. These files are saved in an AutoRecovery
file. After your computer fails, you can try to recover some of the work you
lost by getting it from the AutoRecovery file (see “When disaster strikes!”).
Office saves AutoRecovery files every ten minutes, but if you want the program
to save the files more or less frequently, you can change the AutoRecovery
setting. Auto-recovering taxes a computer’s memory. If your computer is
sluggish, consider making AutoRecovery files at intervals longer than ten
minutes; if your computer fails often and you’re worried about losing data,
make AutoRecovery files more frequently.
Follow these steps to tell Office how often to save data in an AutoRecovery
file:
1. Click the Office button and choose Options on the drop-down list.
The Options dialog box appears.
2. Select the Save category (refer to Figure 1-9).
Converting Office 97–2003 files to 2007
When you open a file made in an earlier version
of Office, the program switches to compatibil-
ity mode. Features that weren’t part of earlier
versions of the program are shut down. You can
tell when a file is in compatibility mode because
the words Compatibility Mode appear in the
title bar next to the file’s name.
Follow these steps to convert a 97–2003 file for
use in an Office 2007 program:
1. Click the Office button and choose Convert
on the drop-down list.
A dialog box informs you what converting
means. If you don’t see the Convert option,
your file has been converted already.
2. Click OK.

3. Enter a Minutes setting in the Save AutoRecover Information Every box.
4. Click OK.
When disaster strikes!
After your computer fails and you restart an
Office program, you see the Document
Recovery task pane with a list of files that were
open when the failure occurred:
 AutoSave files are files that Office saves as
part of its AutoRecovery procedure (see
“Saving AutoRecovery information”).
 Original files are files that you save by
clicking the Save button.
The Document Recovery task pane tells you
when each file was saved. By studying the time
listings, you can tell which version of a file —
the AutoRecovery file or the file you saved —
is most up to date.
Open the drop-down list for a file and choose
one of these options:
 Open:Opens the file so that you can examine
it. If you want to keep it, click the Save button.
 Save As: Opens the Save As dialog box so
that you can save the file under a different
name. Choose this command to keep a
copy of the recovered file on hand in case
you need it.
 Delete: Deletes the AutoRecovery file (this
command is available with AutoRecovery
files, not files that you save on your own).
 Show Repairs: Shows repairs made to the
file (for use with repaired Word documents).

Opening and Closing Files
26
Opening and Closing Files
To get to work on a file, you have to open it first. And, of course, you close a
file when you’re finished working on it and want to carry on normal activities.
The following pages explain all the intricate details of opening and closing
files. In these pages, you find many tips for finding and opening the file you
want to work on.
Opening a file
Between the two of them, Office and Windows offer many shortcuts for
opening file. To open a file, take the standard route — click the Office button
and then choose Open — or take advantage of the numerous ways to open
files quickly.
The slow, conventional way to open a file
If you can’t open a file by any other means, you have to resort to the Open
dialog box:
1. Click the Office button and choose Open on the drop-down list (or
press Ctrl+O).
You see the Open dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-10.
2. Locate and select the file you want to open.
Very shortly, I show you some tricks for locating a file in the Open dialog box.
3. Click the Open button.
Your file opens. You can also double-click a filename to open a file.
The Open dialog box offers a bunch of different ways to locate a file:
✦My Recent Documents button: View the names of files you recently
worked on in the dialog box.
✦Look In drop-down list: Look for folders or files on a different drive, net-
work location, or disk. (You can also click the My Computer button.)
Earlier in this chapter, “Declaring where you like to save files” explains
how to make a folder of your choice appear first in the Look In drop-
down list.
✦Back button: Revisit folders you saw before in the course of your
search.
✦Up One Level button: Move up the folder hierarchy to show the con-
tents of the folder one level above the one you’re looking at.

✦Views drop-down list: Display folder contents differently (see Figure 1-10).
In the Thumbnails view and Preview view, you can see a pictorial repre-
sentation of a file. Details view can be helpful when you have trouble
finding a file. In Details view, you see how large files are and when they
were edited last.
✦Folders: Double-click a folder to see its contents in the Open dialog box.
If you know the first letter in the name of a file you want to open, type the
letter in the File Name text box. Files whose names start with the letter you
typed appear on the File Name drop-down list.
Double-click a folder to see its contents.
Navigate to other folders.
Change views.

Deleting and renaming files 
in the Open dialog box
Deleting and renaming files is really the purlieu
of the Windows operating system, but you can
delete and rename documents one at a time
inside the Open dialog box. Select the file that
needs deleting or renaming and follow these
instructions to delete or rename it:
 Deleting a file: Click the Delete button;
click the Tools button and choose Delete on
the drop-down list; or right-click and
choose Delete. Then click Yes in the Confirm
File Delete message box.
 Renaming a file: Click the Tools button and
choose Rename on the drop-down list (or
right-click and choose Rename). Then type
a new name and press Enter.

Opening and Closing Files
28
Speed techniques for opening files
As shown in Figure 1-11, the fastest way to open a file is to click the Office
button and then click the file’s name on the Recent Documents list. This list
shows the names of the last several files you opened. By moving the pointer
over a name, you can see which folder a file is stored in. Click the pin next to
a name to make the name remain on the list even if it isn’t one of the last sev-
eral files you opened (click the pin a second time to “unpin” a name).
To make more (or fewer) than nine filenames appear on the Recent Documents
list, click the Office button and choose Options. In the Options dialog box,
click the Advanced category. Then scroll to the Display section and enter a
number in the Show This Number of Recent Documents text box.
Here are other speed techniques for opening files:
✦In Windows Explorer or My Computer: Locate the file in one of these
file-management programs and double-click its name. You can click the
Start button and choose My Documents to open Windows Explorer to
the My Documents folder.
✦Shortcut icon: Create a shortcut icon to a file and place the icon on the
Windows desktop. In Windows Explorer or the Open dialog box, right-
click the file’s name and choose Send To➪Desktop (Create Shortcut).
To quickly open the file, double-click its shortcut icon on the desktop.
Click to ‘‘pin’’ a name to the list.

Closing a file
Closing a file is certainly easier than opening one. To close a file, save your
file and use one of these techniques:
✦Click the Office button and choose Close on the drop-down list. The pro-
gram remains open although the file is closed.
✦Click the Close button — the X in the upper-right corner of the window.
(Alternatively, press Alt+F4.) Clicking the Close button closes the pro-
gram as well as the file.
If you try to close a file without first saving it, a message box asks whether
ditching your file is in your best interests, and you get a chance to click 
Yes in the message box and save your file. Sometimes closing a file without
saving the changes you made to it is worthwhile. If you made a bunch of edi-
torial mistakes and want to start over, you can close the file without saving
the changes you made. Next time you open the file, you see the version that
you had before you made all those mistakes.
Entering the Document Properties
Document properties are a means of describing a file. If you manage two
dozen or more files, you owe it to yourself to record document properties.
You can use them later to identify files.
To record document-property descriptions, click the Office button and
choose Prepare➪Properties (in Access, choose Manage➪Database
Properties). You see the Properties pane, as shown in Figure 1-12. Enter
information about your file in the text boxes. To record even more descrip-
tions, click the Document Properties button and choose Advanced Properties
on the drop-down list to display the Properties dialog box.
Figure 1-12:
Enter
document

You can read a file’s document properties without opening a file:
✦In Windows Explorer, My Computer, or the Open dialog box, right-click a
file’s name and choose Properties. You see the Properties dialog box, as
shown on the right side of Figure 1-12.
✦In the Open dialog box, switch to Properties view (refer to Figure 1-10).
You can do this in Windows XP but not Windows Vista.
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint offer a command for erasing document proper-
ties. Click the Office button and choose Prepare➪Inspect Document. In the
Document Inspector dialog box, click the Inspect button, and then click the
Remove All button if you want to remove document properties.
Understanding the New Office XML Format
Not that you particularly need to know it if you don’t share files with others,
but Office 2007 files are formatted by using eXtensible Markup Language
(XML), not the binary file format of previous versions. A markup language is
a computer language, or set of codes, that determines how text, graphics,
colors, and all else is displayed on a computer screen. You may have heard
of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML is the markup language that
Web browsers read to display Web pages on computer screens.
Microsoft adopted XML for Office 2007 (except Publisher) to make sharing
information between the programs easier. Because files made in the Office 2007
programs are formatted in XML — because they’re written in the same 
language — data from one Office program can be copied to another without
the data having to be translated from one binary file format to another.
What’s more, files in the XML format are half the size of files written in the
old binary formats. And because XML is an open format — all program-
mers can find the codes with which the XML is written — people outside
Microsoft can write programs that produce XML data for use in Office pro-
grams. XML makes it easier for different programs to exchange information.
The new XML format matters to Office 2007 users who intend to give their
files to people who don’t have Office 2007. Because Office 2007 files are for-
matted in XML, not the binary file format with which Office 97, 2000, XP, and
2003 files are formatted, earlier versions of Office can’t open files made in
Office 2007. Before you give a file you create to someone who uses Office
97–2003, save it as an Office 97–2003 file. (See “Saving files for use in earlier
versions of an Office program” earlier in this chapter.)
You can tell whether a Word, PowerPoint, Access, or Excel file is formatted
for a 2007 program or an earlier version of the program by glancing at its file

extension. PowerPoint, Excel, Access, and Word files have four-letter, not
three-letter file extensions. Table 1-1 lists Office program file extensions. You
can convert Office 97–2003 files for use in Office 2007. (See “Converting
Office 97–2003 files to 2007” earlier in this chapter.)

Locking a File with a Password
Perhaps you want to submit your file to others for critical review but you
don’t want any Tom, Dick, or Harry to look at your file. In that case, lock
your file with a password and only give out the password to people whose
opinions you trust. These pages explain how to password-protect a file, open
a file that is locked with a password, and remove the password from a file.
Password-protecting a file
Follow these steps to clamp a password on a file, such that others need a
password to open and perhaps also edit it:
1. Click the Office button and choose Save As.
You see the Save As dialog box.
2. Click the Tools button and choose General Options on the drop-down
list.
The General Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-13. (Your
dialog box may look a little different, depending on which program
you’re in.)
3. Enter a password in the Password to Open text box.
Others need the password you enter to open the file. No ifs, ands, or
buts. You have to enter this password.

Locking a File with a Password
32
Passwords are case sensitive. In other words, you have to enter the cor-
rect combination of upper- and lowercase letters to successfully enter
the password. If the password is Valparaiso (with an uppercase V), enter-
ing valparaiso (with a lowercase v) is deemed the wrong password and
doesn’t open the file.
4. Enter a password in the Password to Modify text box if you want others
to supply a password not only to open the file but also to edit it.
Unless they have this password, others can’t edit this file or save it
under a different name. The file opens as a read-only file. It can be
viewed, but not altered.
5. Click OK.
The Confirm Password dialog box appears.
6. Enter the Open password you gave in Step 3, and if you entered a
Modify password, enter it as well; then click OK.
7. Click the Save button in the Save As dialog box.
At last, the ordeal is over.
Opening a file that requires a password
When you try to open a file that has been given a password, you see the
Password dialog box, as shown on the left side of Figure 1-14. And if a pass-
word is required as well to edit the file, the Password dialog box, as shown
on the right side of Figure 1-14, appears shortly thereafter.
A person who doesn’t have the Modify password can click the Read Only
button to open the file. That person can view the file, but not edit it or save
it under a different name.

2. Click the Office button and choose Save As.
3. In the Save As dialog box, click the Tools button and choose General
Options on the drop-down list.
You return to the General Options dialog box (refer to Figure 1-13).

Everybody knows that. But not everyone knows all the different ways to
change the look and size of text in an Office 2007 file. This chapter explains
how to do that as well as how to move, copy, and delete text. You find out
how to quickly change letters’ case, enter a symbol or foreign character, and
find and replace text in a file. Finally, it shows you how to link your files to
the Internet by fashioning a hyperlink.
Manipulating the Text
This short but important part of this chapter describes the many techniques
for selecting, deleting, copying, and moving text. You find an inordinate
number of tips on these pages because there are so many shortcuts for
manipulating text. Master the many shortcuts and you cut down consider-
ably on the time you spend editing text.
Selecting text
Before you can do anything to text — move it, boldface it, delete it, translate
it — you have to select it. Here are speed techniques for selecting text:
To Select
Do This
A word
Double-click the word.
A few words
Drag over the words.
A paragraph
Triple-click inside the paragraph (in Word,
PowerPoint, and Outlook messages).

Manipulating the Text
36
To Select
Do This
A block of text
Click the start of the text you want to select, hold
down the Shift key, and click the end of the text.
All text
Press Ctrl+A.
Word offers a special command for selecting text throughout a document.
On the Home tab, click the Select button and choose Select Text with Similar
Formatting (you may have to click the Editing button first). This command
can come in handy when you need to make wholesale changes to text. For
example, to change all italicized text to small caps, choose the Select Text
with Similar Formatting command and then choose the Small Caps and
Regular commands in the Font dialog box.
Moving and copying text
Office offers a number of different ways to move and copy text from place to
place. Drum roll please . . . . Select the text you want to move or copy and
then use one of these techniques to move or copy it:
✦Dragging and dropping: Move the mouse over the text and then click
and drag the text to a new location. If you want to copy rather than
move the text, hold down the Ctrl key while you drag. Drag means to
hold down the mouse button while you move the pointer on-screen.
✦Dragging and dropping with the right mouse button: Drag the text
while holding down the right, not the left, mouse button. After you
release the right mouse button, a shortcut menu appears with Move
Here and Copy Here options. Choose an option to move or copy the text.
✦Using the Clipboard: Move or copy the text to the Clipboard by clicking
the Cut or Copy button, pressing Ctrl+X or Ctrl+C, or right-clicking and
choosing Cut or Copy on the shortcut menu. The text is moved or
copied to an electronic holding tank called the Clipboard. Paste the text
by clicking the Paste button, pressing Ctrl+V, or right-clicking and choos-
ing Paste. You find the Paste, Cut, and Copy buttons on the Home tab.
Taking advantage of the Clipboard task pane
The Windows Clipboard is a piece of work. After you copy or cut text with
the Cut or Copy command, the text is placed on the Clipboard. The Clip-
board holds the last 24 items that you cut or copied. You can open the
Clipboard task pane and view the last 24 items you cut or copied to the
Clipboard, as shown in Figure 2-1.
To open the Clipboard task pane, go to the Home tab and click the Clipboard
group button. Icons next to the items tell you where they came from. Open

an item’s drop-down list and choose Paste to copy it. The Clipboard is avail-
able to all Office programs; it’s especially useful for copying text and graph-
ics from one Office program to another.
The Options pop-up list at the bottom of the Clipboard task pane offers
these options:
✦Show Office Clipboard Automatically: Choose this option if you want
the Clipboard task pane to open automatically when you cut or copy
two items consecutively or you copy the same item twice.
Figure 2-1:
The
Clipboard
task pane in
action.
A look at the Paste options
Text adopts the formatting of neigh-
boring text when you move or copy it
to a new location. Suppose, however,
that you want the text you move or copy to keep
its original formatting? In that case, click the
Paste Options button. This button appears after
you paste text. Click it to open a drop-down list
with these options (among others, depending
on the program you’re working in):
 Keep Source Formatting: The text keeps its
original formatting.
 Match Destination Formatting: The text
adopts the formatting of surrounding text.
 Keep Text Only: The text is stripped of all
formatting.
Some people think that the Paste Options button
is a bother. If you’re one of those people, click
the Office button and choose Options on the
drop-down list. You see the Options dialog box.
Select the Advanced category and deselect the
Show Paste Options Buttons check box.

Changing the Look of Text
38
✦Show Office Clipboard When Ctrl+C Pressed Twice: Choose this
option if you want to open the Clipboard task pane by pressing Ctrl+C
and Ctrl+C again.
✦Collect Without Showing Office Clipboard: Choose this option to be
notified when an item has been cut or copied to the Clipboard by an
icon in the system tray and/or a pop-up notice. To be notified, you 
must have selected either or both of the preceding two options on the
Options menu.
✦Show Office Clipboard Icon on Taskbar: Choose this option to be noti-
fied when an item has been cut or copied to the Clipboard by an icon in
the system tray, the part of the Windows taskbar by the clock. (The icon
appears after you cut or copy the first item to the Clipboard.) You can
double-click the icon to open the Clipboard task pane. After an item is
cut or copied to the Clipboard, a tiny page glides across the icon.
✦Show Status Near Taskbar When Copying: Choose this item to be noti-
fied when an item has been cut or copied to the Clipboard by a pop-up
notice in the lower-right corner of the screen. It tells you how many
items have been collected on the Clipboard.
Deleting text
To delete a bunch of text at once, select the text you want to delete and
press the Delete key. By the way, you can kill two birds with one stone by
selecting text and then starting to type. The letters you type immediately
take the place of and delete the text you selected.
You can always click the Undo button if you regret deleting text. You can find
this button on the Quick Access toolbar.
Changing the Look of Text
What text looks like is determined by its font, the size of the letters, the
color of the letters, and whether text effects or font styles, such as italics
or boldface, are in the text. What text looks like really matters in Word,
PowerPoint, and Publisher because files you create in those programs are
meant to be read by all and sundry. Even in Excel, Access, and Outlook 
messages, however, font choices matter because the choices you make
determine whether your work is easy to read and understand.
A font is a collection of letters, numbers, and symbols in a particular type-
face, including all italic and boldface variations of the letters, numbers, and
symbols. Fonts have beautiful names and some of them are many centuries
old. Most computers come with these fonts: Arial, Tahoma, Times New Roman,
and Verdana. By default, Office often applies the Calibri and Cambria fonts 
to text.

Book I
Chapter 2
Wrestling with 
the Text
Changing the Look of Text
39
Font styles include boldface, italic, and underline. By convention, headings
are boldface. Italics are used for emphasis and to mark foreign words in text.
Office provides a number of text effects. Text effects, also known as text 
attributes, include strikethrough and superscript. Use text effects sparingly.
The following pages look at the different ways to change the font, font size,
and color of text, as well as how to assign font styles and text effects to text.
Choosing fonts for text
If you aren’t happy with the fonts you choose, select the text that needs a
font change and change fonts with one of these techniques:
✦Mini Toolbar: Move the pointer over the selected text. You see the Mini
Toolbar. Move the pointer over this toolbar and choose a font in the
Font drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-2.
✦Shortcut menu: Right-click the selected text and choose a new font on
the Mini Toolbar attached to the shortcut menu.
The Format Painter: A fast way 
to change the look of text
When you’re in a hurry to change the look of
text and reformat paragraphs, consider using
the Format Painter. This nifty tool works some-
thing like a paintbrush. You drag it over text to
copy formats from place to place. Follow these
instructions to use the Format Painter:
1. Click a place with text and paragraph for-
mats that you want to copy elsewhere (or
select the text).
2. On the Home tab (or the Format Text tab in
an Outlook message), double-click the
Format Painter button.
You can find this button in the
Clipboard group. The pointer
changes into a paintbrush. Unless 
you double-click the Format Painter button,
you can’t copy format to more than one
place.
3. Drag the pointer across text to which you
want to copy the formats.
You can go from place to place with the
Format Painter.
4. Click the Format Painter button a second
time or press Esc when you’re finished
with the Format Painter.
At the opposite end of the spectrum
from the Format Painter button is the
Clear Formatting button on the Home
tab. In Word and PowerPoint, you can select
text and then click this button to strip text of all
its formats, whatever they may be.

Changing the Look of Text
40
✦Font drop-down list: On the Home tab, open the Font drop-down list and
choose a font. You can “live-preview” font choices on this menu.
✦Font dialog box: On the Home tab, click the Font group button. You see
the Font dialog box. Select a font and click OK.
Another way to change fonts is to select a different theme font. In the Page
Layout tab (in Word and Excel) or the Design tab (in PowerPoint), open the
drop-down list on the Theme Fonts button and choose a font combination.
Avoid using too many different fonts because a file with too many fonts looks
like alphabet soup. The object is to choose a font that helps set the tone. An
aggressive sales pitch calls for a strong, bold font; a technical presentation
calls for a font that is clean and unobtrusive. Make sure that the fonts you
select help communicate your message.
Figure 2-2:

fonts by way

Toolbar.
Installing and removing fonts on your computer
If Windows is installed on your com-
puter, so are many different fonts. The
names of these fonts appear on the
Font drop-down list, Font dialog box, and Mini
Toolbar. Do you have enough fonts on your
computer? Do you want to remove fonts to

crowded?
Font files are kept in the C:\Windows\
Fonts folder on your computer. Windows
Explorer and My Computer (or Computer in
Windows Vista) offer the File➪Install New Font

command for loading font files into this folder,
but here are easier ways to handle fonts:
 Installing new fonts: Place the font file in
the C:\Windows\Fonts folder.
 Removing a font: Move the font file out of
the C:\Windows\Fonts folder. Store
font files you don’t want in another folder
where you can resuscitate them if need be.
Besides opening the Fonts folder in Windows
Explorer or My Computer, you can open it by
double-clicking the Fonts icon in the Control
Panel. The Fonts folder provides these ameni-
ties for handling fonts:
 Examining fonts: Double-click a font file to
examine a font more closely. A window
opens, and you see precisely what the font
looks like. Do you know why “The quick
brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”
appears in this window? Because that sen-
tence includes every letter in the alphabet.
 Finding similar fonts (Windows XP): To list
fonts that look similar to a certain font, click
the Similarity button and choose the font’s
name on the List Fonts by Similarity To
drop-down list. The list of fonts is arranged
so that very similar fonts come first, fairly
similar fonts come next, and dissimilar
fonts come last in the list. Use this com-
mand to familiarize yourself with fonts or
decide which fonts to remove when you
have many that look nearly the same.
 Shortening the font list (Windows XP): To
shrink the list of fonts and make font hunt-
ing a little easier, choose View➪Hide
Variations. Doing so removes boldface and
italic versions of fonts from the list.

Changing the font size of text
Font size is measured in points; a point is ƒ1⁄72 of an inch. The golden rule of
font sizes goes something like this: the larger the font size, the more impor-
tant the text. This is why headings are larger than footnotes. Select your text
and use one of these techniques to change the font size of the letters:
✦Mini Toolbar: Move the pointer over the text and when you see the Mini
Toolbar, move the pointer over the toolbar and choose a font size on the
Font Size drop-down list (refer to Figure 2-2).
✦Shortcut menu: Right-click the text and choose a new font size on the
Mini Toolbar attached to the shortcut menu.
✦Font Size drop-down list: On the Home tab, open the Font Size drop-
down list and choose a font. You can “live-preview” font sizes this way.
✦Font dialog box: On the Home tab, click the Font group button, and in
the Font dialog box, choose a font size and click OK.
✦Grow Font and Shrink Font buttons: Click these buttons (or press
Ctrl+] or Ctrl+[) to increase or decrease the point size by the next inter-
val on the Font Size drop-down list. You can find the Grow Font and
Shrink Font buttons on the Home tab and the Mini Toolbar. Watch the
Font Size list or your text and note how the text changes size. This is an
excellent technique when you want to “eyeball it,” and you don’t care to
fool with the Font Size list or Font dialog box.
Click the Grow Font and Shrink Font buttons when you’re dealing with fonts
of different sizes and you want to proportionally change the size of all the
letters. Drag the pointer over the text to select it before clicking one of the
buttons.
If the font size you want isn’t on the Font Size drop-down list, enter the size.
For example, to change the font size to 13.5 points, type 13.5 in the Font Size
box and press Enter.
Applying font styles to text
There are four — count ’em four — font styles: regular, bold, italic, and
underline:
✦Regular: This style is just Office’s way of denoting an absence of any
font style.
✦Italic: Italics are used for emphasis, when introducing a new term, and
to mark foreign words such as violà, gung hay fat choy, and Qué mag-
nifico! You can also italicize titles to make them a little more elegant.

Book I
Chapter 2
Wrestling with 
the Text
Changing the Look of Text
43
✦Bold: Boldface text calls attention to itself.
✦Underline: Underline text to call attention to it but use underlining spar-
ingly. Later in this chapter, “Underlining text” looks at all the ways to
underline text.
Select text and use one of these techniques to apply a font style to it:
✦Home tab: Click the Bold, Italic, or Underline button.
✦Keyboard: Press Ctrl+B to boldface text, Ctrl+I to italicize it, or Ctrl+U to
underline it.
✦Mini Toolbar: The Mini Toolbar offers the Bold and Italic button.
✦Font dialog box: Select a Font Style option in the Font dialog box. To
open this dialog box, visit the Home tab and click the Font group button.
To remove a font style, click the Bold, Italic, or Underline buttons a second
time. You can also select text and then click the Clear Formatting button on
the Home tab (in Word and PowerPoint).
Applying text effects to text
Text effects have various uses, some utilitarian and some strictly for yucks.
Be careful with text effects. Use them sparingly and to good purpose. To
apply a text effect, start on the Home tab (or the Format Text tab in Outlook
messages) and do one of the following:
✦Click a text effect button.
✦Click the Font group button and choose a text effect in the bottom half
of the Font dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-3.
Here’s a rundown of the different text effects (not all these effects are avail-
able in PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook):
✦Strikethrough and Double Strikethrough: By convention, strikethrough
is used to show where passages are struck from a contract or other
important document. Double strikethrough, for all I know, is used to
show where passages are struck out forcefully. Use these text effects to
demonstrate ideas that you reject.
✦Superscript: A superscripted letter or number is one that is raised in the
text. Superscript is used in mathematical and scientific formulas, in ordi-
nal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd), and to mark footnotes. In the theory of relativ-
ity, the 2 is superscripted: E = mc2.
✦Subscript: A subscripted letter is lowered in the text. In this chemistry
equation, the 2 is lowered to show that two atoms of hydrogen are
needed along with one atom of oxygen to form a molecule of water: H2O.

Changing the Look of Text

✦Small Caps: A small cap is a small capital letter. You can find many cre-
ative uses for small caps. An all small cap title looks elegant. Be sure to
type lowercase letters in order to create small caps. Type an uppercase
letter, and Office refuses to turn it into a small cap. Not all fonts can pro-
duce small capital letters.
✦All Caps: The All Caps text effect merely capitalizes all letters. Use it in
styles to make sure that you enter text in all capital letters.
✦Equalize Character Height (PowerPoint only): This effect makes all
characters the same height and stretches the characters in text. You 
can use it to add interesting effects in text box announcements.
The following text effects are available only in Word:
✦Shadow: The Shadow effect makes letters cast a faint shadow on the
page, as shown in Figure 2-4. To make the Shadow effect work, choose 
a heavy font (such as Copper Black or Franklin) so that the letters are
wide enough to cast shadows.

✦Outline: This effect presents letters in outline form. To use it success-
fully, the letters must be heavy enough and tall enough to see as outlines.
✦Emboss: This effect turns letters white. Embossed text looks as though 
it is raised from the paper. Be sure to choose a serif font, such as Times
New Roman, with short, ornamental strokes to make the embossing
stand out.
✦Engrave: The Engrave effect also turns letters white. The letters are
meant to look as though they have been chiseled into the paper. Be sure
to choose a serif font with ornamental strokes to make the engraved let-
ters stand out.
✦Character Shading: This effect makes text look as though it has been
selected. The effect is the same as what you get when you drag the
pointer across letters to select them.
✦Enclose Characters: This effect draws a circle, square, triangle, or dia-
mond around a single character. After you click the Enclose Characters
button, the Enclose Characters dialog box appears so you can tell Word
how to enclose the character.
Underlining text
Word and PowerPoint offer 15 ways to underline text, with styles ranging
from Words Only to Wavy Line, and you can select a color for the underline. If
you decide to underline titles, do it consistently. To underline text, select the
text that you want to underline, go to the Home tab and pick your poison:
✦Click the Underline button. A single line runs under all the words you
selected.
✦Click the Font group button to open the Font dialog box (refer to Figure 2-3)
and then choose an underline style from the drop-down list. You can
also choose an underline color from the Underline Color drop-down list.
The color you select applies to the underline, not to the words being
underlined.
To remove an underline from text, select the text and then click the
Underline button on the Home tab.
Changing the color of text
Before you change the color of text, peer at your computer screen and exam-
ine the background theme or color you chose. Unless the color of the text is
different from the theme or color, you can’t read the text. Besides choosing a
color that contributes to the overall tone, choose a color that is easy to read.

Quick Ways to Handle Case, or Capitalization
46
Select the text that needs touching up and use one of these techniques to
change its color:
✦On the Mini Toolbar, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button
and choose a color, as shown in Figure 2-5.
✦Right-click, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button (you can
see it on the Mini Toolbar attached to the shortcut menu), and choose a
color.
✦On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button and
choose a color.
✦On the Home tab, click the Font group button to open the Font dialog
box, open the Font Color drop-down list, and choose a color.
The Font Color drop-down list offers theme colors and standard colors. You
are well advised to choose a theme color. These colors are deemed theme
colors because they jive with the theme you choose for your file.
Quick Ways to Handle Case, or Capitalization
Case refers to how letters are capitalized in words and sentences. Table 2-1
explains the different cases, and Figure 2-6 demonstrates why paying atten-
tion to case matters. In the figure, the PowerPoint slide titles are presented
using different cases, and the titles are inconsistent with one another. In one
slide, only the first letter in the title is capitalized (sentence case); in another
slide, the first letter in each word is capitalized (capitalize each word); in
another, none of the letters is capitalized (lowercase); and in another, all the
letters are capitalized (uppercase). In your titles and headings, decide on a
capitalization scheme and stick with it for consistency’s sake.

✦tOGGLE cASE: Choose this option if you accidentally enter letters with
the Caps Lock key pressed.
You can also change case by pressing Shift+F3. Pressing this key combina-
tion in Word and PowerPoint changes characters to uppercase, lowercase,
each word capitalized, and back to uppercase again.
Entering Symbols and Foreign Characters
Don’t panic if you need to enter an umlaut, grave accent, or cedilla because
you can do it by way of the Symbol dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-7. You
can enter just about any symbol and foreign character by way of this dialog
box. Click where you want to enter a symbol or foreign character and follow
these steps to enter it:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the Symbol button (you may have to click the Symbols button
first, depending on the size of your screen).
In Word, click More Symbols after you click the Symbol button. You see
the Symbol dialog box (see Figure 2-7).
3. If you’re looking to insert a symbol, not a foreign character, choose
Webdings or Wingdings 1, 2, or 3 in the Font drop-down list.
Webdings and the Wingdings fonts offer all kinds of weird and whacky
symbols.
4. Select a symbol or foreign character.
You may have to scroll to find the one you want.

5. Click the Insert button to enter the symbol and then click Close to
close the dialog box.
The Symbol dialog box lists the last several symbols or foreign charac-
ters you entered under Recently Used Symbols. See whether the symbol
you need is listed there. It spares you the trouble of rummaging in the
Symbol dialog box. In Word, you see the last several symbols or foreign
characters you entered on a drop-down list after you click the Symbol
button.
Finding and Replacing Text
Use the Find command to locate a name or text passage. Use its twin, the
powerful Replace command, to find and replace a name or text passage
throughout a file. To give you an idea how useful the Replace command is,
imagine that the company you work for just changed its name and the old
company name is in many different places. By using the Replace command,
you could replace the old company name with the new name throughout a
long file in a matter of seconds.
Finding stray words and formats
To locate stray words, names, text passages, and formats, follow these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+F.
You see the Find and Replace (or Find) dialog box. Figure 2-8 shows the
Find and Replace dialog box in Word. It offers many more Find options
than are offered by Excel and PowerPoint, but the basics of looking for
stray words and formats is the same in all programs.
You can also open the dialog box by going to the Home tab, clicking the
Editing button (or the Find & Select button in Excel), and choosing Find
on the drop-down list.
2. Enter the word or phrase in the Find What text box.
The words and phrases you looked for recently are on the Find What
drop-down list. Open the Find What drop-down list and make a selection
from that list if you want.
In Word, you can use wildcard characters in searches. See “Using wild-
card operators to refine searches” later in this chapter.
3. If necessary, click the More button (in Word) or the Options button (in
Excel) and choose options for narrowing your search.
What these options are is explained in “Narrowing your search,” the 
next section in this chapter. If you want to search for text that has been

formatted a certain way, see “Searching for formats in Word and Excel”
later in this chapter.
In Word, you can search for and highlight all instances of the thing
you’re looking for by clicking the Reading Highlight button and choosing
Highlight All in the drop-down list.
4. Click the Find Next button if you’re looking for a simple word or
phrase, or the Find All button to highlight all instances of a word or
phrase in your file.
In PowerPoint, the Find All button is available only if you start your
search in Slide Sorter view.
5. To find the next instance of the thing you’re looking for, click Find
Next again.
In Word, you can close the Find and Replace dialog box and continue
searching. Click either the Previous Find/Go To or Next Find/Go To
button at the bottom of the scroll bar (or press Ctrl+Page Up or Ctrl+
Page Down) to go to the previous or next instance of the thing you’re
looking for.

Narrowing your search
By clicking the More button (in Word) or the Options button (in Excel), you
can take advantage of the following options to conduct a sophisticated
search:
✦Match Case: Searches for words with upper- and lowercase letters that
exactly match those in the Find What box. With this box selected, a
search for bow finds bow, but not Bow or BOW.
✦Find Whole Words Only: Normally, a search for bow yields elbow,
bowler, bow-wow, and all other words with the letters b-o-w (in that
order). Click this option and you get only bow.
As shown in Figure 2-8, Word offers a number of other ways to narrow a
search:
✦Use Wildcards: Click here if you intend to use wildcards in searches.
(See “Using wildcard operators to refine searches” later in this chapter.)
✦Sounds Like: Looks for words that sound like the one in the Find What
box. A search for bow with this option selected finds beau, for example.
However, it doesn’t find bough. This command isn’t very reliable.
✦Find All Word Forms: Takes into account verb conjugations and plurals.
With this option clicked, you get bows, bowing, and bowed as well as bow.
✦Match Prefix: A prefix is a syllable appearing before the root or stem of a
word to alter its meaning. For example, co, mid, non, and un are prefixes
in the words coauthor, midtown, nonviolent, and unselfish. Choose this
option and enter a prefix in the Find What text box to locate words that
begin with the prefix you enter.
✦Match Suffix: A suffix is a syllable or two appearing at the end of a word
to alter its meaning. For example, age, ish, and ness are suffixes in the
words spillage, smallish, and darkness. Choose this option and enter a
suffix in the Find What text box to find words that end with the same
suffix.
✦Ignore Punctuation Characters: Search in text for word phrases without
regard for commas, periods, and other punctuation marks. For example, a
search for Yuma Arizona finds Yuma, Arizona (with a comma) in the text.
✦Ignore White-Space Characters: Search in text for word phrases without
regard for white space caused by multiple blank spaces or tab entries.
Searching for formats in Word and Excel
In Word and Excel, you can search for formats or text that was formatted a
certain way with these techniques:

Finding and Replacing Text
52
✦In Word: Click the Format button in the Find and Replace dialog box
(refer to Figure 2-8), and on the drop-down list, choose a Format type —
Font, Paragraph, Tabs, Language, Frame, Style, or Highlight. A Find
dialog box opens so you can describe the format you’re looking for.
Select options in the dialog box to describe the format and click OK.
✦In Excel: Click the Format button and choose a format in the Find
Format dialog box. You can also open the drop-down list, select Choose
Format from Cell on the drop-down list, and click a cell to describe the
format you’re looking for.
Be sure to click the No Formatting button (in Word) or open the Format
drop-down list and choose Clear Find Format (in Excel) after you’re finished
looking for formats. Choosing these commands tells Word or Excel that you
no longer want to look for formats or you want to search for a different set of
formats.
Using wildcard operators to refine searches
A wildcard operator is a character that represents characters in a search
expression. Wildcards aren’t for everybody. Using them requires a certain
amount of expertise, but after you know how to use them, wildcards can be
very valuable in searches and macros. Table 2-2 explains the wildcard opera-
tors you can use in searches. Click the Use Wildcards check box if you want
to search using wildcards.
Table 2-2

Example
{n,}
At least n instances of the

{n,m}
From n to m instances of the 
10{2,4} finds 100, 1000, and 10000, but not 
previous character
10 or 100000.
You can’t conduct a whole-word-only search with a wildcard. For example, a
search for f*s not only finds fads and fits but also all text strings that begin
with f and end with s, such as for the birds. Wildcard searches can yield
many, many results and are sometimes useless.
To search for an asterisk (*), question mark (?), or other character that
serves as a wildcard search operator, place a backslash (\) before it in the
Find What text box.
Searching for special characters in Word
Table 2-3 describes the special characters you can look for in Word docu-
ments. To look for the special characters listed in the table, enter the charac-
ter directly in the Find What text box or click the Special button in the Find
and Replace dialog box, and then choose a special character from the pop-up
list. Be sure to enter lowercase letters. For example, you must enter ^n, not
^N, to look for a column break. Note: A caret (^) precedes special characters.

Before searching for special characters in Word, click the Show/Hide¶ button
in the Home tab. That way, you see special characters — also known as
hidden format symbols — on-screen when Word finds them.
Creative people find many uses in the Find and Replace dialog box for spe-
cial characters. The easiest way to find section breaks, column breaks, and
manual line breaks in a document is to enter ^b, ^n, or ^l, respectively, in
the Find What text box and start searching. By combining special characters
with text, you can make find-and-replace operations more productive. For
example, to replace all double hyphens (- -) in a document with em dashes
(—), enter -- in the Find What text box and ^m in the Replace With text box.

This kind of find-and-replace operation is especially useful for cleaning docu-
ments that were created in another program and then imported into Word.
Conducting a find-and-replace operation
Conducting a find-and-replace operation is the spitting image of conducting a
find operation. Figure 2-9 shows (in PowerPoint) the Replace dialog box, the
place where you declare what you want to find and what to replace it with.
Do the options and buttons in the dialog box look familiar? They do if you
read the previous handful of pages about searching because the Replace
options are the same as the Find options.
The key to a successful find-and-replace operation is making sure you find
exactly what you want to find and replace. One way to make sure that you
find the right text is to start by running a Find operation. If the program finds
precisely the text you want, you’re in business. Click the Replace tab or
Replace button in the Find dialog box and then enter the replacement text.
To locate and replace words, names, or text passages with the Find com-
mand, follow these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+H or go to the Home tab and click the Editing button (or
the Find & Select button in Excel), and choose Replace in the drop-
down list.
The Replace (or Find and Replace) dialog box appears (see Figure 2-9).
2. Describe the text that needs replacing.
Earlier in this chapter, “Finding stray words and formats” explains how
to construct a search. Try to narrow your search so you find only the
text you are looking for.
3. Click the Find Next button.
Did your program find what you’re looking for? If it didn’t, describe the
search again.
4. Enter the replacement text in the Replace With text box.
You can select replacement text from the drop-down list.

5. Either replace everything simultaneously or do it one at a time.
Click one of these buttons:
• Click Replace All to make all replacements in an instant.
• Click Find Next and then either click Replace to make the replace-
ment or Find Next to bypass it.
Click the Replace All button only if you are very, very confident that the
thing your program found is the thing you want to replace.
Be sure to examine your file after you conduct a find-and-replace operation.
You never know what the powerful Replace command will do. If the com-
mand makes a hash of your file, click the Undo button.
Creating Hyperlinks
A hyperlink is an electronic shortcut from one place to another. If you’ve
spent any time on the Internet, you know what a hyperlink is. Clicking hyper-
links on the Internet takes you to different Web pages or different places on
the same Web page. In the Office programs, you can use hyperlinks to con-
nect readers to your favorite Web pages or to a different page, or slide, or
file. You can fashion a link out of a word or phrase as well as any object — 
a clip-art image, text box or text frame, shape, or picture.
These pages explain how to insert a hyperlink to another place in your file as
well as create links to Web pages. You also discover how to enter an e-mail
hyperlink that makes it easy for others to e-mail you.
Linking a hyperlink to a Web page
It could well be that a Web page on the Internet has all the information your
readers need. In that case, you can link to the Web page so that viewers can
visit it in the course of viewing your file. To make this little trick work, how-
ever, Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher must be installed on your computer, and
you must know the address of the Web page you will link to. When a viewer
clicks the link, Internet Explorer opens and the Web page appears.
Follow these steps to hyperlink your file to a Web page on the Internet:
1. Select the text or object that will form the hyperlink.
For example, select a line of text or phrase if you want viewers to be able
to click it to go to a Web page. Hyperlinked text is underlined on slides.
2. On the Insert tab, click the Hyperlink button (or press Ctrl+K).

Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Links

Creating an e-mail hyperlink
An e-mail hyperlink is one that opens an e-mail program. These links are
sometimes found on Web pages so that anyone visiting a Web page can con-
veniently send an e-mail message to the person who manages the Web page.
When you click an e-mail hyperlink, your default e-mail program opens. And
if the person who set up the link was thorough about it, the e-mail message
is already addressed and given a subject line.
Include an e-mail hyperlink in a file if you’re distributing the file to others
and you would like them to be able to comment on your work and send the
comments to you.
Follow these steps to put an e-mail hyperlink in a file:
1. Select the words or object that will constitute the link.
2. On the Insert tab, click the Hyperlink button (or press Ctrl+K).
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears.
3. Under Link To, click E-Mail Address.
Text boxes appear for entering an e-mail address and a subject message.
4. Enter your e-mail address and a subject for the messages that others
send you.
Office inserts the word mailto: before your e-mail address as you enter it.
5. Click OK.
Test the link by Ctrl+clicking it. Your default e-mail program opens. The
e-mail message is already addressed and given a subject.
Repairing and removing hyperlinks
From time to time, check the hyperlinks in your file to make sure they still
work. Clicking a hyperlink and having nothing happen is disappointing.
Hyperlinks get broken when Web pages and parts of files are deleted.

T
his brief chapter takes you on a whirlwind tour of shortcut commands
that can save you time and effort no matter which Office 2007 program
you’re working in. This chapter is devoted to people who want to get it done
quickly and get away from their computers. It explains the Undo and Repeat
commands, zooming in and out, and opening more than one window on the
same file. You also discover how to display windows in different ways, cor-
rect your typos automatically, and enter hard-to-type terminology with a
simple flick of the wrist.
Undoing and Repeating Commands
If I were to choose two commands for the Hall of Fame, they would be the
Undo command and the Repeat command. One allows you to reverse
actions you regret doing, and the other repeats a previous action without
you having to choose the same commands all over again. Undo and Repeat
are explained forthwith.
Undoing a mistake
Fortunately for you, all is not lost if you make a big blunder because
Office has a marvelous little tool called the Undo command. This command
“remembers” your previous editorial and formatting changes. As long as
you catch your error in time, you can undo your mistake.

Undoing and Repeating Commands
62
Click the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar to undo your most recent
change. If you made your error and went on to do something else before you
caught it, open the drop-down list on the Undo button. It lists your previous
actions, as shown in Figure 3-1. Click the action you want to undo, or if it
isn’t on the list, scroll until you find the error and then click it.
Remember, however, that choosing an action far down the Undo list also
reverses the actions before it on the list. For example, if you undo the 19th
action on the list, you also undo the 18 more recent actions above it.
Repeating an action — and quicker this time
The Quick Access toolbar offers the Repeat button that you can click to
repeat your last action. This button can be a mighty, mighty timesaver. For
example, if you just changed fonts in one heading and you want to change
another heading in the same way, select the heading and click the Repeat
button (or press F4 or Ctrl+Y). Move the pointer over the Repeat button to
see what clicking it does.
You can find many creative uses for the Repeat command if you use your
imagination. For example, if you had to type I will not talk in class a hun-
dred times as a punishment for talking in class, you could make excellent
use of the Repeat command to fulfill your punishment. All you would have to
do is write the sentence once and then click the Repeat button 99 times.
After you click the Undo button, the Repeat button changes names and
becomes the Redo button. Click the Redo button to “redo” the command you
“undid.” In other words, if you regret clicking the Undo button, you can turn
back the clock by clicking Redo.

Zooming In, Zooming Out
Eyes weren’t meant to stare at the computer screen all day, which makes the
Zoom controls all the more valuable. You can find these controls in the lower-
right corner of the window and in the View tab, as shown in Figure 3-2. Use
them freely and often to enlarge or shrink what is on the screen and pre-
serve your eyes for important things, such as gazing at the sunset.
Meet the Zoom controls:
✦Zoom slider: Drag the zoom slider left to shrink or right to enlarge what
is on your screen. Click the Zoom In (+) or Zoom Out (-) button to zoom
in or out by 10-percent increments.
✦Zoom dialog box: Click the Zoom box (the % listing) or the Zoom button
(on the View tab) to display the Zoom dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Then select an option button or enter a percent measurement in the
dialog box and click OK.
✦Mouse wheel: If your mouse has a wheel, you can hold down the Ctrl
key and spin the wheel to quickly zoom in or out.

Viewing a File through More Than One Window
64
Each Office program offers its own special Zoom commands in the Zoom
group on the View tab. In Word, for example, you can display one page or
many pages; in Excel, you can click the Zoom to Selection button and enlarge
a handful of cells. Make friends with the Zoom commands. They never let
you down.
Viewing a File through More Than One Window
By way of the commands in the Window group on the View tab, you can be
two places simultaneously, at least where Office is concerned. You can work
on two files at once. You can place files side by side on the screen and do a
number of other things to make your work a little easier.
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all offer these buttons in the Window group:
✦New Window: Opens another window on your file so you can be two
places at once in the same file. To go back and forth between windows,
click a taskbar button or click the Switch Windows button and choose a
window name on the drop-down list. Click a window’s Close button when
you’re finished looking at it.
✦Arrange All: Arranges open windows side by side on-screen.
✦Switch Windows: Opens a drop-down list with open windows so you can
travel between windows.
You can also take advantage of these Window buttons in Word and Excel to
compare files:
✦View Side by Side: Displays files side by side so you can compare and
contrast them.
✦Synchronous Scrolling: Permits you to scroll two files at the same rate
so you can proofread one against the other. To use this command, start
by clicking the View Side by Side button. After you click the Synchronous
Scrolling button, click the Reset Window Position button so both files
are displayed at the same size on-screen.
✦Reset Window Position: Gives files being shown side by side the same
size on-screen to make comparing them easier.
Correcting Typos on the Fly
The unseen hand of Office 2007 corrects some typos and misspellings auto-
matically. For example, try typing accomodate with one m — Office corrects

the misspelling and inserts the second m for you. Try typing perminent
with an i instead of an a — the invisible hand of Office corrects the mis-
spelling, and you get permanent. While you’re at it, type a colon and a close
parenthesis :) — you get a smiley face J.
As good as the AutoCorrect feature is, you can make it even better. You can
also add the typos and misspellings you often make to the list of words that
are corrected automatically.
Opening the AutoCorrect dialog box
Office corrects common spelling errors and turns punctuation mark combi-
nations into symbols as part of its AutoCorrect feature. To see which typos
are corrected and which punctuation marks are turned into symbols, open
the AutoCorrect dialog box by following these steps:
1. Click the Office button and choose Options.
You see the Options dialog box.
2. Click the Proofing category.
3. Click the AutoCorrect Options button.
The AutoCorrect dialog box opens.
4. Click the AutoCorrect tab.
As shown in Figure 3-3, the AutoCorrect tab lists words that are cor-
rected automatically. Scroll down the Replace list and have a look
around. Go ahead. Make yourself at home.
Enter a typo and its replacement.

Telling Office which typos and 
misspellings to correct
No doubt you make the same typing errors and spelling errors time and time
again. To keep from making these errors, you can tell Office to correct them
for you automatically. You do that by entering the misspelling and its cor-
rected spelling in the AutoCorrect dialog box (see Figure 3-3):
✦Enter the misspelling in the Replace text box and its correct spelling in
the With text box.
✦Click the AutoCorrect button in the Spelling and Grammar dialog box
when you spell check a file. This action automatically places the mis-
spelling and its correction in the AutoCorrect dialog box so that the 
correction is made in the future.
You can also remove misspellings and typos from the list of words that are
corrected automatically. To remove a word from the list of corrected words,
select it in the AutoCorrect dialog box and click the Delete button.
Preventing capitalization errors with AutoCorrect
Near the top of the AutoCorrect dialog box (refer to Figure 3-3) are five check
boxes whose job is to prevent capitalization errors. These options do their
jobs very well, sometimes to a fault:
✦Correct TWo INitial Capitals: Prevents two capital letters from appear-
ing in a row at the start of a word with more than two letters. Only the
first letter is capitalized. This option is for people who can’t lift their
little fingers from the Shift key fast enough after typing the first capital
letter at the start of a word.
✦Capitalize first letter of sentences: Makes sure that the first letter in a
sentence is capitalized.
✦Capitalize first letter of table cells: Makes sure that the first letter you
enter in a table cell is a capital letter. A table cell holds one data item;
it’s the place in a table where a column and row intersect.
✦Capitalize names of days: Makes sure that the names of the days of the
week are capitalized.
✦Correct accidental usage of cAPS LOCK key: Changes capital letters to
lowercase letters if you press the Shift key to start a sentence while Caps
Lock is on. The idea here is that if you press down the Shift key while
Caps Lock is on, you don’t know that Caps Lock is on because you don’t
need to hold down the Shift key to enter capital letters. AutoCorrect
turns the first letter into a capital letter and the following letters into
lowercase letters and then turns Caps Lock off.

Entering Text Quickly with the AutoCorrect Command
The preceding part of this chapter explains how you can use the AutoCorrect
command to help correct typing errors, but with a little cunning you can also
use it to quickly enter hard-to-type jargon, scientific names, and the like. To
open the AutoCorrect dialog box, click the Office button, choose Options,
click the Proofing category in the Options dialog box, and then click the
AutoCorrect Options button. Select the AutoCorrect tab in the AutoCorrect
dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-4.
In the Replace column on the AutoCorrect tab are hundreds of common
typing errors and codes that Office corrects automatically. The program 
corrects the errors by entering text in the With column whenever you mis-
takenly type the letters in the Replace column. However, you can also use
this dialog box for a secondary purpose to quickly enter text.
To make AutoCorrect work as a means of entering text, you tell Office
to enter the text whenever you type three or four specific characters.
In Figure 3-4, for example, Office is instructed to insert the words Cordyceps
sinensis (a mushroom genus) whenever I enter the characters /cs (and press
the Spacebar). Follow these steps to use AutoCorrect to enter text:
Enter text to trigger AutoCorrect.

1. Open the AutoCorrect tab of the AutoCorrect dialog box (see Figure 3-4).
2. In the Replace text box, enter the three or four characters that will
trigger the AutoCorrect mechanism and make it enter your text.
Don’t enter a word, or characters that you might really type someday, in
the Replace box. If you do, the AutoCorrect mechanism might kick in
when you least expect it. Enter three or four characters that never appear
together. And start all AutoCorrect entries with a slash (/). You might
forget which characters trigger the AutoText entry or decide to delete
your AutoCorrect entry someday. By starting it with a slash, you can find
it easily in the AutoCorrect dialog box at the top of the Replace list.
3. In the With text box, enter the hard-to-type name or word(s) that will
appear when you enter the Replace text.
4. Click the Add button.
5. Click OK.
Test your AutoCorrect entry by typing the Replace text you entered in
Step 2 (which, of course, includes the slash I recommended) and press-
ing the Spacebar. (AutoCorrect doesn’t do its work until you press the
Spacebar.)
To delete an AutoCorrect entry, open the AutoCorrect dialog box, select the
entry, and click the Delete button.

was going to call this chapter “Foolproofing Your Work,” but that seemed
kind of presumptuous because keeping every error from slipping into
your work is well-nigh impossible. Still, you can do a good job of proofing your
work and eliminating errors by using the tools that Office 2007 provides for
that purpose. This chapter describes how to proof your work for spelling
and grammatical errors. It shows how to conduct research in reference
books and on the Internet without ever leaving an Office program. You also
find out how to translate text and proof foreign language text in an Office
file. The Office proofing tools are not foolproof, but they’re close to it.
Correcting Your Spelling Errors
Office keeps a dictionary in its hip pocket, which is a good thing for you
because who wants to be embarrassed by a spelling error? Office consults
its dictionary when you enter text in Word, PowerPoint, Access, Excel,
Outlook, and Publisher. To correct misspellings, you can either address
them one at a time or start the spell checker and proof many pages or slides
simultaneously. You can even create your own dictionary with the jargon
and slang peculiar to your way of life and then have Office check the
spelling of your jargon and slang.
Don’t trust the smell checker to be accurate all the time. It doesn’t really
locate misspelled words — it locates words that aren’t in its dictionary. For
example, if you write Nero diddled while Rome burned, the spell checker
won’t catch the error. Nero fiddled while Rome burned, but because diddle is
a legitimate word in the spelling dictionary, the spell checker overlooks the
error. The moral: Proofread your files carefully and don’t rely on the spell
checker to catch all your smelling errors.

Correcting Your Spelling Errors
70
Correcting misspellings one at a time
In Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Outlook, you can practice the one-at-a-
time method of spell-checking. As shown in Figure 4-1, you can right-click
each word that is underlined in red and choose a correct spelling from the
shortcut menu. After you choose a word from the shortcut menu, it replaces
the misspelling that you right-clicked.
Words entered twice are also flagged in red, in which case the shortcut menu
offers the Delete Repeated Word option so that you can delete the second
word. You can also click Ignore All to tell Office when a word is correctly
spelled and shouldn’t be flagged, or click Add to Dictionary, which adds
the word to the Office spelling dictionary and declares it a correctly spelled
word.
Running a spell-check
Instead of correcting misspellings one at a time, you run a spell-check on
your work. Start your spell-check with one of these methods:
✦Press F7.
✦Go to the Review tab and click the Spelling (or Spelling & Grammar)
button (you may have to click the Proofing button to get to the Spelling
button). In Access, you find the Spelling button on the Home tab.

Even with the red lines gone, you can do a
quick spell check of a word that you suspect
has been misspelled. To do so, select the word

If the word in question isn’t a misspelling, tell your program how to handle
the word by clicking one of these buttons:
✦Ignore (or Ignore Once): Ignores this instance of the misspelling but
stops on it again if the same misspelling appears later.
✦Ignore All: Ignores the misspelling throughout the file you’re working on
and in all other open Office files as well.
✦Change/Delete: Enters the selected word in the Suggestions box in the
file where the misspelling used to be. When the same word appears
twice in a row, the Delete button appears where the Change button was.
Click the Delete button to delete the second word in the pair.
✦Change All/Delete All: Replaces all instances of the misspelled word
with the word that you selected in the Suggestions box. Click the Change
All button to correct a misspelling that occurs throughout a file. When
two words appear in a row, this button is called Delete All. Click the
Delete All button to delete the second word in the pair throughout 
your presentation.
✦Add (or Add to Dictionary): Adds the misspelling to the Office spelling
dictionary. By clicking the Add button, you tell Office that the misspelling
is a legitimate word or name.
✦Suggest (in PowerPoint only): Changes the list of words in the Suggestions
box. Select a word in the Suggestions box and then click the Suggest button
to see whether you can find a correct spelling.
✦AutoCorrect: Adds the spelling correction to the list of words that are
corrected automatically. If you find yourself making the same typing
error over and over, place the error on the AutoCorrect list and never
have to correct it again. (See Chapter 3 of this mini-book for details.)
Office programs share the same spelling dictionary. For example, words you
add to the spelling dictionary in PowerPoint — by clicking the Add button in
the Spelling and Grammar dialog box — are deemed correct spellings in
Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Publisher publications, Access data-
bases, and Outlook e-mails.
Fine-tuning the spell checker
Especially if you deal in jargon and scientific terminology, you owe it to your-
self to fine-tune the spell checker. No matter how arcane, it can make sure
that your jargon gets used correctly. These pages explain the nuances of the
spell checker.

Employing other dictionaries to help with spell-checking
To find spelling errors, Office compares each word on your page or slide to
the words in its main dictionary and a second dictionary called Custom.dic.
If a word you type isn’t found in either dictionary, Office considers the word
a misspelling. The main dictionary lists all known words in the English lan-
guage; the Custom.dic dictionary lists words, proper names, and technical
jargon that you deemed legitimate when you clicked the Add (or Add to
Dictionary) button in the course of a spell-check and added a word to the
Custom.dic dictionary.
From Office’s standpoint, a dictionary is merely a list of words, one word per
line, that has been saved in a .dic (dictionary) file. Besides the Custom.dic
dictionary, you can employ other dictionaries to help with spell-checking.
People who work in specialized professions, such as law or medicine, can
also use legal dictionaries and medical dictionaries to spell check their work.
You can create dictionaries of your own for slang words, colloquialisms, or
special projects. Before you start spell-checking, you can tell Office which
dictionaries to use. You can edit dictionaries as well. All this magic is done
by way of the Custom Dictionaries dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Follow these steps to open the Custom Dictionaries dialog box:
1. Press F7.
You see the Spelling and Grammar (or Spelling) dialog box.
2. Click the Options button.
The Proofing category of the Options dialog box opens. (To reach this
category in Publisher, choose Tools➪Spelling➪Spelling Options.)
3. Click the Custom Dictionaries button.
Click to edit or delete the words in a dictionary.

Starting in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box, you can create a new
spelling dictionary, tell PowerPoint to use a third-party dictionary you
acquired, edit words in a dictionary, and tell PowerPoint which diction-
ary to use in a spell check. Better keep reading.
Creating a new spelling dictionary
People who work in law offices, research facilities, and medical facilities type
hundreds of arcane terms each day, none of which are in the main diction-
ary. One way to make sure that arcane terms are spelled correctly is to
create or acquire a dictionary of legal, scientific, or medical terms and use it
for spell-checking purposes. By Office’s definition, a dictionary is simply a
list of words saved in a dictionary (.dic) file.
Follow these steps to create a new spelling dictionary or tell Office that you
want to use a secondary dictionary to check the spelling of words:
1. Click the New button in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box (refer to
Figure 4-3).
You see the Create Custom Dictionary dialog box.
2. Enter a name for your new dictionary.
3. Click the Save button.
See “Entering and editing words in a dictionary” later in this chapter, to
find out how to enter terms in your new spelling dictionary.
Using a third-party dictionary
Besides creating your own dictionary, you can acquire one and tell Office to
use it by following these steps:
1. Make note of where the dictionary file is located on your computer.
It doesn’t have to be in the C:\Documents and Settings\
Username\Application Data\Microsoft\Proof (or UProof)
folder along with the other dictionaries for Office to use it.
2. Click the Add button in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box (refer to
Figure 4-3).
The Add Custom Dictionary dialog box appears.
3. Locate and select the dictionary on your computer.
4. Click Open.
The dictionary’s name appears in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box.
Ten dictionaries total can appear in the Dictionary List box.

such as Spanglish, for which Microsoft doesn’t offer foreign language diction-
aries is a thorough waste of time. Follow these steps in Word, PowerPoint,

1. Select the text.
2. On the Review tab, click the Set Language button (you may have to
click the Proofing button first).
You see the Language dialog box. (To open this dialog box in an Outlook

Checking for Grammatical Errors in Word
Much of what constitutes good grammar is, like beauty, in the eye of the
beholder. Still, you can do your best to repair grammatical errors in Word
documents by getting the assistance of the grammar checker. The grammar
checker identifies grammatical errors, explains what the errors are, and
gives you the opportunity to correct the errors.
Figure 4-5 shows the grammar checker in action in the Spelling and Grammar
dialog box. As long as the Check Grammar check box is selected, Word looks
for grammatical errors along with spelling errors. To open the Spelling and
Grammar dialog box, press F7 or go to the Review tab and then click the
Spelling & Grammar button. (You may have to click the Proofing button first,
depending on the size of your screen.)
Sentences in which grammatical errors appear are underlined in green in
your document. Meanwhile, the grammatical errors themselves appear in
bright green in the box at the top of the Spelling and Grammar dialog box
(along with spelling errors, which are red). When Word encounters an error,
take one of these actions to correct it:
✦Select a correction in the Suggestions box and click the Change button.
✦Delete the grammatical error or rephrase the sentence in the top of the
dialog box, enter a correction, and click the Next Sentence button.
✦Click outside the Spelling and Grammar dialog box, correct the grammat-
ical error in your document, and then click the Resume button. (You find
it where the Ignore Once button used to be.)
Click one of the Ignore buttons or the Next Sentence button to let what Word
thinks is a grammatical error stand.

If you want to fine-tune how Word runs its grammar checker, click the
Options button in the Spelling and Grammar dialog box. You land in the
Proofing category of the Word Options dialog box. Under When Correcting
Spelling and Grammar in Word, choose whether to underline grammatical
errors in your documents, whether to check for grammatical as well as
spelling errors, and in the Writing Style drop-down list, how stringent you
want the rules of grammar to be. Choose Grammar & Style, not Grammar
Only, if you want Word to enforce style rules as well as the rules of grammar.
Researching a Topic inside an Office Program
Thanks to the Research task pane, your desk needn’t be as crowded as
before. The Research task pane offers dictionaries, foreign language diction-
aries, a thesaurus, language translators, and encyclopedias, as well as
Internet searching, all available from inside the Office programs. As shown
in Figure 4-6, the Research task pane can save you a trip to the library.
Table 4-1 describes the research services in the Research task pane.
Use these services to get information as you compose a Word document,
Excel worksheet, Outlook message, Publisher publication, or PowerPoint
presentation.

installed as part of the Office software, but the research Web sites and the
Encarta dictionaries and encyclopedia require an Internet connection.
In order to use some of the services offered by the Research task pane, you
must pay a fee. These services are marked in search results with the Premium
Content icon.
Using the Research task pane
No matter what you want to research in the Research task pane, start your
search the same way. The task pane offers menus and buttons for steering a
search in different directions. Follow these basic steps to use the Research
task pane:

Book I
Chapter 4
Taking Advantage 
of the Proofing
Tools
Researching a Topic inside an Office Program
79
1. Either click in a word or select the words that you want to research.
For example, if you want to translate a word, click it. Clicking a word or
selecting words saves you the trouble of entering words in the Search For
text box, but if no word in your file describes what you want to research,
don’t worry about it. You can enter the subject of your search later.
2. On the Review tab, click the Research button (you may have to click
the Proofing button first).
The Research task pane appears (refer to Figure 4-6). If you’ve researched
since you started running your Office program, the options you chose
for researching last time appear in the task pane. (In Publisher, choose
Tools➪Research to open the Research task pane; in Outlook, open the
drop-down list on the Spelling button and choose Research.)
3. Enter a research term in the Search For text box (if one isn’t there
already).
If you weren’t able to click a word or select words in Step 1, enter
research terms now.
4. Open the Search For drop-down list and tell Office where to steer
your search (refer to Table 4-1).
Choose a reference book, research Web site, or business and financial
Web site. To research in a category, choose a category name — All
Reference Books, All Research Sites, or All Business and Financial Sites.
Later in this chapter, “Choosing your research options” explains how to
decide which researching options appear on the drop-down list.
5. Click the Start Searching button.
The results of your search appear in the Research task pane.
If your search yields nothing worthwhile or nothing at all, scroll to the
bottom of the task pane and try the All Reference Books or All Reference
Sites link. The first link searches all reference books — the dictionaries, the-
sauruses, and translation services. The second searches research sites —
the Encarta Encyclopedia, Factiva iWorks and MSN Search.
You can retrace a search by clicking the Previous Search button or Next
Search button in the Research task pane. These buttons work like the Back
and Forward buttons in a Web browser.
Sometimes a hyperlink to a Web site appears in the search results. If you
click one of these hyperlinks, your browser (if you’re using Internet Explorer)
opens with the Research task pane on the left, as shown in Figure 4-7. You
can continue using the Research task pane in the browser window.

Choosing your research options
Which research options appear on the Search For drop-down list is up to
you. Maybe you want to dispense with the for-a-fee services (eLibrary,
Encarta Encyclopedia, and Factiva iWorks). Maybe you want to get stock
quotes from a particular country. To decide which research options appear
in the Research task pane, open the task pane and click the Research Options
link (you can find this link at the bottom of the task pane). You see the Research
Options dialog box. Select the research services you want and click OK.
Finding the Right Word with the Thesaurus
If you can’t seem to find the right word or if the word is on the tip of your
tongue but you can’t quite remember it, you can always give the thesaurus a
shot. To find synonyms for a word, start by right-clicking the word and
choosing Synonyms on the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 4-8 (you can’t
do this in Excel). With luck, the synonym you’re looking for appears on the
shortcut menu, and all you have to do is click to enter the synonym. Usually,
however, finding a good synonym is a journey, not a Sunday stroll.
To search for a good synonym, click the word in question and open the the-
saurus on the Research task pane with one of these techniques:
✦Press Shift+F7.
✦Right-click the word and choose Synonyms➪Thesaurus. (In Publisher,
right-click and choose Proofing Tools➪Thesaurus.)

✦Go to the Review tab and click the Thesaurus button (you may have to
click the Proofing button first).
The Research task pane opens. It offers a list of synonyms and sometimes
includes an antonym or two at the bottom. Now you’re getting somewhere:
✦Choosing a synonym: Move the pointer over the synonym you want,
open its drop-down list, and choose Insert.
✦Finding a synonym for a synonym: If a synonym intrigues you, click it.
The task pane displays a new list of synonyms.
✦Searching for antonyms: If you can’t think of the right word, type its
antonym in the Search For box and then look for an “antonym of an
antonym” in the Research task pane.
✦Revisit a word list: Click the Back button as many times as necessary. If
you go back too far, you can always click its companion Forward button.
If your search for a synonym comes up dry, scroll and click a link at the
bottom of the Research task pane. Clicking All Reference Books gives you 
the opportunity to look up a word in the reference books you installed in the
task pane; clicking All Research Sites gives you a chance to search the
Internet (see “Researching a Topic inside an Office Program” earlier in 
this chapter, for details).

Proofing Text Written in a Foreign Language
In the interest of cosmopolitanism, Office gives you the opportunity to make
foreign languages a part of Word documents, PowerPoint presentations,
Publisher publications, and Outlook messages. To enter and edit text in a
foreign language, you start by installing proofing tools for the language. With
the tools installed, you tell Office where in your file a foreign language is
used. After that, you can spell check text written in the language.
To spell check text written in anguages apart from English, you have to
obtain the additional proofing tools from Microsoft. These can be obtained
at the Microsoft Product Information Center at www.microsoft.com/
products (enter proofing tools in the Search box). Proofing tools include 
a spell checker, grammar checker, thesaurus, hyphenator, AutoCorrect list,
and translation dictionary, but not all these tools are available for every 
language.
In PowerPoint and Word, the status bar along the bottom of the window lists
which language the cursor is in. Glance at the status bar if you aren’t sure
which language Office is whispering in your ear.
Telling Office which languages you will use
Follow these steps to inform Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Outlook that
you will use a language or languages besides English in your files:
1. Close all Office programs (if any are open).
2. Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪Microsoft Office➪
Microsoft Office Tools➪Microsoft Office 2007 Language Settings.
You see the Microsoft Office 2007 Language Settings dialog box. The
Enabled Editing Languages box lists languages that Office is capable of
proofing.
3. Select a language in the Available Editing Languages box and click the
Add button to make that language a part of your presentations, docu-
ments, and messages.
If you see the words limited support next to a language’s name in the
Enabled Editing Languages box, you need to install language-proofing
software. You can obtain this software at the Microsoft Product Information
Center (www.microsoft.com/products).
4. Click OK.

Marking text as foreign language text
The next step is to tell Office where in your file you’re using a foreign lan-
guage. After you mark the text as foreign language text, Office can spell
check it with the proper dictionaries. Follow these steps to mark text so that
Office knows in which language it was written:
1. Select the text that you wrote in a foreign language.
2. Click the Review tab.
3. Click the Set Language button (you may have to click the Proofing
button first).
You see the Language dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-9. (In Publisher,
choose Tools➪Language➪Set Language; in Outlook, open the drop-down
list on the Spelling button and choose Set Language.)
4. Select a language and click OK.
Translating Foreign Language Text
Office offers a little gizmo for translating words and phrases from one lan-
guage to another. The translation gizmo is good only for translating single
words and well-known phrases. To translate an entire file, you have to seek
the help of a real, native speaker.
The fastest way to translate a word or phrase is to select it, right-click it,
choose Translate, and then choose a language on the shortcut menu. With
any luck, the translation is done. Usually, however, you have to follow these
more intricate steps to translate text from one language to another:
1. Select the word or phrase that needs translating.
2. On the Review tab, click the Translate button.

Translate; in Publisher and Excel, Alt+click to open the Research task
pane and then choose Translation on the Search For drop-down list.)
Earlier in this chapter, “Researching a Topic inside an Office Program”
describes the Research task pane.
3. Under Translation, choose a From option and a To option.
For example, to translate from English to Spanish, choose English in the
From drop-down list and Spanish in the To drop-down list.
The translation — if Office can make it — appears in the task pane. You
may have to scroll down to find it.
To copy a translation into your file, double-click or drag the pointer over the
translation to select it. Then right-click and choose Copy to copy the word
or phrase to the Clipboard. From there, you can paste it in your file.

Taking advantage of Word’s 
Translation ScreenTips
If you’re a jet-setter or other cosmopolitan type
who often has to deal in foreign languages,
you’ll like the Word Translation ScreenTips.
When you move the pointer over an English
word, its translation appears in a pop-up box
called a ScreenTip. Sometimes you get addi-
tional information about the word. For example,
the ScreenTip tells you how the word is used in
sayings and whether it is masculine or feminine.
To make Translation ScreenTips
appear, go to the Review tab, click
the Translation ScreenTip button (you may have
to click the Proofing button first), and deselect
Turn Off Translation ScreenTip. Then open the
drop-down list again and choose the language
for which you need translations.
Which languages appear on the list depends on
which dictionaries are loaded on your com-
puter and which languages you told Office you
intended to use (see “Telling Office which lan-
guages you will use” earlier in this chapter).

 Understanding table jargon
 Creating a table and entering the text and numbers
 Aligning table text in various ways
 Merging and splitting cells to make interesting layouts
 Changing the size of rows and columns
 Decorating a table with table styles, colors, and borders
 Doing calculations in a Word table
 Discovering an assortment of table tricks
T
he best way to present a bunch of data at once in Word or PowerPoint is
to do it in a table. Viewers can compare and contrast the data. They can
compare Elvis sightings in different cities or income from different busi-
nesses. They can contrast the number of socks lost in different washing
machine brands. A table is a great way to plead your case or defend your
position. On a PowerPoint slide, the audience can see right away that the
numbers back you up. In a Word document, readers can refer to your table
to get the information they need.
As everyone who has worked on tables knows, however, tables are a chore.
Getting all the columns to fit, making columns and rows the right width
and height, and editing the text in a table isn’t easy. I explain in this chapter
how to create tables, enter text in tables, change the number and size of
columns and rows, lay out tables, format tables, and (in Word) do the math
in tables. You’ll also discover a few tricks — including using a picture for the
background — that only magicians know. And to start you on the right foot,
I begin by explaining table jargon.
Talking Table Jargon
As with much else in Computerland, tables have their own jargon. Figure 5-1
describes this jargon. Sorry, but you need to catch up on these terms to
construct the perfect table:
✦Cell: The box that is formed where a row and column intersect. Each
cell holds one data item.

Creating a Table
88
✦Header row: The name of the labels along the top row that explain what
is in the columns below.
✦Row labels: The labels in the first column that describe what is in
each row.
✦Borders: The lines in the table that define where the rows and columns are.
✦Gridlines: The gray lines that show where the columns and rows are.
Unless you’ve drawn borders around all the cells in a table, you can’t tell
where rows and columns begin and end without gridlines. To display or
hide the gridlines, click the View Gridlines button on the (Table Tools)
Layout tab.
Creating a Table
Word and PowerPoint offer several ways to create a table:
✦Drag from the Table menu (Word and PowerPoint). On the Insert tab,
click the Table button, point on the drop-down list to the number of
columns and rows you want, click, and let go of the mouse button.
✦Use the Insert Table dialog box (Word and PowerPoint). On the Insert
tab, click the Table button and choose Insert Table on the drop-down
list. The Insert Table dialog box appears. Enter the number of columns
and rows you want and click OK. In PowerPoint, you can also open the
Insert Table dialog box by clicking the Table icon in a content place-
holder frame.

✦Draw a table (Word and PowerPoint). On the Insert tab, click the Table
button and then choose Draw Table on the drop-down list. The pointer
changes into a pencil. Use the pencil to draw table borders, rows,
and columns. If you make a mistake, click the Eraser button on the
(Table Tools) Design tab and drag it over the parts of the table you
regret drawing (you may have to click the Draw Borders button first).
When you’re finished drawing the table, press Esc.
✦Create a quick table (Word). On the Insert tab, click the Table button
and choose Quick Tables on the drop-down list. Then select a ready-
made table on the shortcut menu. You have to replace the sample data
in the quick table, however, with your own data.
✦Convert text to a table (Word). Press Tab or enter a comma in the text
where you want columns divided. For example, to turn an address list
into a table, put each name and address on its own line and press Tab or
enter a comma after the first name, the last name, the street address, the
city, the state, and the ZIP Code. For this feature to work, each name and
address — each line — must have the same number of tab spaces or
commas in it. Select the text you’ll convert to a table, click the Table
button on the Insert tab, and choose Convert Text to Table. Under
Separate Text At in the Convert Text to Table dialog box, choose Tabs or
Commas to tell Word how the columns are separated. Then click OK.
After you create a table, you get two new tabs on the Ribbon. The (Table
Tools) Design tab offers commands for changing the look of the table; the
(Table Tools) Layout tab is for changing around the rows and columns.
Constructing your table from an Excel worksheet
Fans of Microsoft Excel will be glad to know
that you can construct an Excel worksheet in a
Word document or PowerPoint slide. Excel
worksheets, which present data in columns
and rows, are very much like tables and can
serve as such in documents and slides.
To create an Excel worksheet, go to the Insert
tab, click the Table button, and choose Excel
Spreadsheet. An Excel worksheet appears on
the slide and — gadzooks! — you see Excel
menus and commands where Word or
PowerPoint menus and commands used to be.
The worksheet you just created is embedded in
your file. Whenever you click the worksheet,
Excel menus and commands instead of Word or
PowerPoint menus and commands appear on-
screen. Click outside the worksheet to return to
Word or PowerPoint. Book VIII, Chapter 8
explains how embedded objects work.

Entering the Text and Numbers
90
Entering the Text and Numbers
After you’ve created the table, you can start entering text and numbers. All
you have to do is click in a cell and start typing. Select your table and take
advantage of these techniques to make the onerous task of entering table
data a little easier:
✦Quickly changing a table’s size: In Word, drag the bottom or side of a
table to change its size. You can also go to the Layout tab, click the
AutoFit button, and choose AutoFit Window to make the table stretch
from margin to margin. In PowerPoint, drag a selection handle on a
corner or side of the table.
✦Moving a table: In Word, switch to Print Layout view and drag the table
selector (the square in the upper-left corner of the table). In PowerPoint,
move the pointer over the table’s perimeter and when you see the four-
headed arrow, click and then drag.
✦Choosing your preferred font and font size: Entering table data is
easier when you’re working in a font and font size you like. Select the
table by going to the Layout tab, clicking the Select button, and choos-
ing Select Table on the drop-down list. Then click the Home tab and
choose a font and font size there.
✦Quickly inserting a new row: Click in the last column of the last row in
your table and press the Tab key to quickly insert a new row at the
bottom of the table.
Here are some shortcuts for moving the cursor in a table:

Merging and Splitting Cells
91
Selecting Different Parts of a Table
It almost goes without saying, but before you can reformat, alter, or diddle
with table cells, rows, or columns, you have to select them:
✦Selecting cells: To select a cell, click in it. You can select several adja-
cent cells by dragging the pointer over them.
✦Selecting rows: Drag across rows to select them; or go to the Layout
tab, click inside the row you want to select, click the Select button, and
choose Select Row on the drop-down list. To select more than one row at
a time, select cells in the rows before choosing the Select Row command.
✦Selecting columns: Drag across columns to select them, or start from
the Layout tab, click in the column you want to select, click the Select
button, and choose Select Column on the drop-down list. To select sev-
eral columns, select cells in the columns before choosing the Select
Column command.
✦Selecting a table: Click the Layout tab, click the Select button, and
choose Select Table on the drop-down list. In PowerPoint, you can also
right-click a table and choose Select Table on the shortcut menu.
Aligning Text in Columns and Rows
Aligning text in columns and rows is a matter of choosing how you want the
text to line up vertically and how you want it to line up horizontally. Select
the cells, columns, or rows, with text that you want to align (or select your
entire table) and then align the text:
✦In Word: On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click an Align button (you
may have to click the Alignment button first, depending on the size of
your screen). Word offers nine of them in the Alignment group.
✦In PowerPoint: On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click one Horizontal
Align button (Align Left, Center, or Align Right), and one Vertical Align
button (Align Top, Center Vertically, or Align Bottom). You may have to
click the Alignment button first.
Merging and Splitting Cells
Merge and split cells to make your tables a little more elegant than run-of-
the-mill tables. Merge cells to break down the barriers between cells and

Merging and Splitting Cells
92
join them into one cell; split cells to divide a single cell into several cells
(or several cells into several more cells). In the table shown in Figure 5-2, the
cells in rows two, four, and six merged and a baseball player’s name is in
each merged cell. Where rows two, four, and six originally had nine cells,
they now have only one.
Select the cells you want to merge or split, go to the Layout tab, and follow
these instructions to merge or split cells:
✦Merging cells: Click the Merge Cells button. You can also right-click and
choose Merge Cells.
✦Splitting cells: Click the Split Cells button. In the Split Cells dialog box,
declare how many columns and rows you want to split the cell into and
then click OK.
Another way to merge and split cells is to click the Draw Table or Eraser
button on the (Table Tools) Design tab (you may have to click the Draw
Borders button first). Click the Draw Table button and then draw lines
through cells to split them. Click the Eraser button and drag over the bound-
ary between cells to merge cells. Press Esc when you’re finished drawing or
erasing table cell boundaries.
Need to split a table? In Word, place the pointer in what you want to be the
first row of the new table and then click the Split Table button.

Creating a Table
Laying Out Your Table
93
Laying Out Your Table
Very likely, you created too many or too few columns or rows for your table.
Some columns are probably too wide and others too narrow. If that’s the case,
you have to change the table layout by deleting, inserting, and changing the
size of columns and rows, not to mention changing the size of the table itself.
In other words, you have to modify the table layout. (Later in this chapter,
“Decorating your table with borders and colors” shows how to put borders
around tables and embellish them in other ways.)
Changing the size of a table, columns, and rows
The fastest way to adjust the width of columns, the height of rows, and the
size of a table itself is to “eyeball it” and drag the mouse:
✦Column or row: Move the pointer onto a gridline or border, and when
the pointer changes into a double-headed arrow, start dragging. Tug and
pull, tug and pull until the column or row is the right size.
You can also go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab and change the measure-
ments in the Height and Width text boxes to change the width of a
column or the height of a row. The measurements affect entire columns
or rows, not individual cells.
✦A table: Select your table and use one of these techniques to change its
size in Word and PowerPoint:
• In Word: Drag the lower-right corner of the table. You can also click
the Cell Size group button on the Layout tab, and in the Table
Properties dialog box, enter a preferred width measurement on
the Table tab.
• In PowerPoint: Drag a selection handle on a side or corner, as shown
in Figure 5-3. You can also go to the Layout tab, click the Table Size
button (if necessary), and enter inch measurements in the Height
and Width text boxes, as shown in Figure 5-3. Click the Lock Aspect
Ratio check box to keep the table’s proportions when you change its
height or width.
Because resizing columns and rows can be problematic, you can also
click these handy buttons in the Layout tab to adjust the width and
height of rows and columns:
✦Distribute Rows: Click this button to make all rows in the table the same
height. Select the rows before clicking the button to make only the rows
you select the same height.

Laying Out Your Table
94
✦Distribute Columns: Click this button to make all columns the same
width. Select the columns before giving this command to make only the
columns you select the same width.
✦In Word, you can also click the AutoFit button on the Layout tab and
take advantage of these commands on the drop-down list for handling
columns and rows:
✦AutoFit Contents: Makes each column wide enough to accommodate its
widest entry.
✦AutoFit Window: Stretches the table so that it fits across the page
between the left and right margin.
✦Fixed Column Width: Fixes the column widths at their current settings.
Drag a selection handle. . .
 
. . .or enter measurements.

Sorting, or reordering a table (in Word)
On the subject of moving columns and rows,
the fastest way to rearrange the rows in a Word
table is to sort the table. Sorting means to
rearrange all the rows in a table on the basis of
data in one or more columns. For example, a
table that shows candidates and the number of
votes they received could be sorted in alphabet-
ical order by the candidates’ names or in numer-
ical order by the number of votes they received.
Both tables present the same information, but
the information is sorted in different ways.

Book I
Chapter 5
Creating a Table
Laying Out Your Table
95
The difference between ascending and descend-
ing sorts is as follows:
 Ascending arranges text from A to Z, num-
bers from smallest to largest, and dates
from earliest to latest.
 Descending arranges text from Z to A, num-
bers from largest to smallest, and dates
from latest to earliest.
When you rearrange a table by sorting it, Word
rearranges the formatting as well as the data.
Do your sorting before you format the table.
Follow these steps to sort a table:
1. On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click the
Sort button.
You see the Sort dialog box. Depending on
the size of your screen, you may have to
click the Data button before you see the
Sort button.
2. In the first Sort By drop-down list, choose
the column you want to sort with.
3. If necessary, open the first Type drop-down
list and choose Text, Number, or Date
to describe what kind of data you’re deal-
ing with.
4. Select the Ascending or Descending
option button to declare whether you want
an ascending or descending sort.
5. If necessary, on the first Then By drop-
down list, choose the tiebreaker column.
If two items in the Sort By columns are
alike, Word looks to your Then By column
choice to break the tie and place one row
before another in the table.
6. Click OK.
When you sort a table, Word ignores the
header row — the first row in the table — and

the header row in the sort, click the No Header
Row option button in the Sort dialog box.

Inserting and deleting columns and rows
The trick to inserting and deleting columns and rows is to correctly select
part of the table first. You can insert more than one column or row at a time
by first selecting more than one column or row. To insert two columns,
select two columns and choose an Insert command; to insert three rows,
select three rows and choose an Insert command. Earlier in this chapter,
“Selecting Different Parts of a Table” explains how to make table selections.
Go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab and follow these instructions to insert
and delete columns and rows:
✦Inserting columns: Select a column or columns and click the Insert Left
or Insert Right button. If you want to insert just one column, click in a
column and then click the Insert Left or Insert Right button. You can
also right-click, choose Insert, and choose an Insert command.
✦Inserting rows: Select a row or rows and click the Insert Above or Insert
Below button. If you want to insert just one row, click in a row and click
the Insert Above or Insert Below button. You can also right-click,
choose Insert, and choose an Insert command on the shortcut menu.
To insert a row at the end of a table, move the pointer into the last cell
in the last row and press the Tab key.
✦Deleting columns: Click in the column you want to delete, click the
Delete button, and choose Delete Columns on the drop-down list. Select
more than one column to delete more than one. (Pressing the Delete key
deletes the data in the column, not the column itself.)
✦Deleting rows: Click in the row you want to delete, click the Delete
button, and choose Delete Rows. Select more than one row to delete
more than one. (Pressing the Delete key deletes the data in the row, not
the row itself.)
Moving columns and rows
Because there is no elegant way to move a column or row, you should move
only one at a time. If you try to move several simultaneously, you open a can
of worms that is best left unopened. To move a column or row:
1. Select the column or row you want to move.
Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting Different Parts of a Table” explains
how to select columns and rows.
2. Right-click in the selection and then choose Cut on the shortcut menu.
The column or row is moved to the Clipboard.
The preceding section of this chapter explains how to insert columns
and rows.

Book I
Chapter 5

3. Move the column or row:
• Column: Click in the topmost cell in your new column. Then right-
click and choose Paste Columns (in Word) or Paste (in PowerPoint).
• Row: Click in the first column of the row you inserted. Then right-
click and choose Paste Rows (in Word) or Paste (in PowerPoint).
Formatting Your Table
After you have entered the text, placed the columns and rows, and made
them the right size, the fun begins. Now you can dress up your table and
make it look snazzy. You can change text fonts, choose colors for columns
and rows, and even land a graphic in the background of your table. You can
also play with the borders that divide the columns and rows and shade
columns, rows, and cells by filling them with gray shades or a black back-
ground. Read on to find out how to do these tricks.
Designing a table with a table style
By far the fastest way to get a good-looking table is to select a table style in
the Table Styles gallery and let Word or PowerPoint do the work for you, as
shown in Figure 5-4. A table style is a ready-made assortment of colors and
border choices. You can save yourself a lot of formatting trouble by selecting
a table style. After you’ve selected a table style, you can modify it by select-
ing or deselecting check boxes in the Table Style Options group.
Modify your table.
Select a table style.
Figure 5-4:

Select your table and follow these steps to choose a table style:
1. Click the (Table Tools) Design tab.
2. Open the Table Styles gallery and move the pointer over table style
choices to live-preview the table.
3. Select a table style.
To remove a table style, choose Clear (in Word) or Clear Table (in
PowerPoint) on the bottom of the Table Styles gallery.
For consistency’s sake, choose a similar table style — or better yet the same
table style — for all the tables in your document or presentation. This way,
your work doesn’t become a showcase for table styles.
Calling attention to different rows and columns
On the (Table Tools) Design tab, Word and PowerPoint offer Table Style
Options check boxes for calling attention to different rows or columns (refer
to Figure 5-4). For example, you can make the header row — the first row in
the table — stand out by selecting the Header Row check box. If your table
presents numerical data with total figures in the last row, you can call atten-
tion to the last row by choosing the Total Row check box. Select or deselect
these check boxes to make your table easier to read and understand:
✦Header Row and Total Row: These check boxes make the first row and
last row in a table stand out. Typically, the header row is a different
color or contains boldface text because it is the row that identifies the
data in the table. Click the Header Row check box to make the first row
stand out; if you also want the last row to stand out, click the Total Row
check box.
✦Banded Columns and Banded Rows: Banded means “striped” in Office
lingo. For striped columns or striped rows — columns or rows that alter-
nate in color — select the Banded Columns or Banded Rows check box.
✦First Column and Last Column: Often the first column stands out in a
table because it identifies what type of data is in each row (refer to
Figure 5-4). Select the First Column check box to make it a different color
or boldface its text. Check the Last Column check box if you want the
rightmost column to stand out.
Decorating your table with borders and colors
Rather than rely on a table style, you can play interior decorator on your
own. You can slap color on the columns and rows of your table, draw bor-
ders around columns and rows, and choose a look for borders. Figure 5-5
shows the drop-down lists on the (Table Tools) Design tab that pertain to
table decoration. Use these lists to shade table column and rows and draw
table borders.

Book I
Chapter 5

Designing borders for your table
Follow these steps to fashion a border for your table or a part of your table:
1. Click the (Table Tools) Design tab.
2. Select the part of your table that needs a new border.
To select the entire table, go to the Layout tab, click the Select button,
and choose Select Table.
3. Open the Line Style drop-down list (in Word) or the Pen Style drop-
down list (in PowerPoint) and choose a line style for the border, as
shown in Figure 5-5 (you may have to click the Draw Borders button
first, depending on the size of your screen).
Stay away from the dotted and dashed lines unless you have a good
reason for choosing one. These lines can be distracting and keep others
from focusing on the data presented in the table.
4. Open the Line Width drop-down list (in Word) or the Pen Weight 
drop-down list (in PowerPoint) and choose a thickness for the border,
as shown in Figure 5-5 (you may have to click the Draw Borders
button first).
5. If you want your borders to be a color apart from black, click the Pen
Color button and choose a color on the drop-down list (you may have
to click the Draw Borders button first).
6. Open the drop-down list on the Borders button (refer to Figure 5-5)
and choose where to place borders on the part of the table you
selected in the previous step.
This is the tricky part. The Borders commands have different effects,
depending on which part of the table you selected. For example, if you
selected two rows and you choose the Top Border command, the com-
mand applies only to the top of the uppermost row. If you’re anywhere
near typical, you have to repeat Steps 5 and 6 until you get it just right.

In Word, you can also change borders by clicking the Draw Borders group
button and making selections in the Borders and Shading dialog box.
Selecting colors for columns, rows, or your table
Follow these steps to paint columns, rows, or your table a new color:
1. Select the part of the table that needs a paint job.
2. On the (Table Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the
Shading button and choose a color (refer to Figure 5-5).
Later in this chapter, “Using a picture as the table background” explains how
to use a picture as the background in a table.
Using Math Formulas in Word Tables
No, you don’t have to add the figures in columns and rows yourself; Word
gladly does that for you. Word can perform other mathematical calculations
as well. Follow these steps to perform mathematical calculations and tell
Word how to format sums and products:
1. Put the cursor in the cell that will hold the sum or product of the cells
above, below, to the right, or to the left.
2. On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click the Formula button.
Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Data
button first. The Formula dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
In its wisdom, Word makes a very educated guess about what you want
the formula to do and places a formula in the Formula box.
Figure 5-6:

3. If this isn’t the formula you want, delete everything except the equal
sign in the Formula box, open the Paste Function drop-down list, and
choose another function for the formula.
For example, choose PRODUCT to multiply figures. You may have to
type left, right, above, or below in the parentheses within the formula
to tell Word where the figures that you want it to compute are.
4. In the Number Format drop-down list, choose a format for your number.
5. Click OK.
Word doesn’t calculate blank cells in formulas. Enter 0 in blank cells if you
want them to be included in calculations. You can copy functions from one
cell to another to save yourself the trouble of opening the Formula dialog box.
Neat Table Tricks
The rest of this chapter details a handful of neat table tricks to make your
tables stand out in a crowd. Why should all tables look alike? Read on to 
discover how to make text in the header row stand on its ear, put a picture
behind a table, draw diagonal border lines, draw on top of a table, and wrap
slide text around a table.
Changing the direction of header row text
In a top-heavy table in which the header row cells — the cells in the first row —
contain text and the cells below contain numbers, consider changing the
direction of the text in the header row to make the table easier to read.
Changing text direction in the header row is also a good way to squeeze
more columns onto a table. Consider how wide the table shown in Figure 5-7
would be if the words in the first row were displayed horizontally.
Figure 5-7:

Neat Table Tricks
102
Follow these steps to change the direction of text on a table.
1. Select the row that needs a change of text direction.
Usually, that’s the first row in a table.
2. Go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab.
3. Click the Text Direction button.
What happens next depends on whether you’re operating in Word or
PowerPoint:
• In Word: Keep clicking the Text Direction button until text lands
where you want it to land. (You may have to click the Alignment
button before you can see the Text Direction button.)
• In PowerPoint: Choose a Text Direction option on the drop-down list.
(You may have to click the Alignment button to get to the Text
Direction button, depending on the size of your screen.)
4. Change the height of the row to make the vertical text fit.
As “Changing the size of a table, columns, and rows” explains earlier in
this chapter, you can change the height of a row by going to the Layout
tab and entering a measurement in the Height box. (You may have to
click the Table Size button in order to see the Height box.)
Using a picture as the table background
As Figure 5-8 demonstrates, a picture used as the background in a table
looks mighty nice. To make it work, however, you need a graphic that serves
well as the background. For Figure 5-8, I got around this problem by recolor-
ing my graphic (Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains how to recolor a graphic).
You also need to think about font colors. Your audience must be able to read
the table text, and that usually means choosing a white or light font color for
text so that the text can be read over the graphic. For Figure 5-8, I selected a
white font color.
Besides putting a graphic behind a table, PowerPoint gives you the opportu-
nity to make the graphic appear in every table cell, as shown on the right
side of Figure 5-8. Sorry, you can’t do that feat in Word, but you can place a
picture behind a table, as the following pages explain.
Placing a picture behind the table
Placing a graphic behind a table requires a fair bit of work, but the results
are well worth the effort. First you have to insert the graphic and perhaps
recolor it. Then you have to create the table. Lastly, you have to make the
table fit squarely on top of the graphic and perhaps group the objects
together.

Book I
Chapter 5
Creating a Table
Neat Table Tricks
103
In Word and PowerPoint, follow these steps to place a graphic behind a table:
1. Insert the graphic, resize it, and format the graphic.
Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains how to insert and resize graphics. To insert
a graphic, go to the Insert tab and click the Picture button. To resize it,
drag a selection handle; make the graphic as big as you want your table
to be. To recolor a graphic similar to the job done to the graphic in
Figure 5-8, select the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Recolor
button, and choose an option.
2. Insert the table and make it roughly the same size as the graphic.
These tasks are explained earlier in this chapter. To change the size of a
table, drag a selection handle on its corner or side. Place the table
nearby the graphic, but not right on top of it.
3. Select the (Table Tools) Design tab, open the Table Styles gallery, and
choose Clear (in Word) or Clear Table (in PowerPoint).
With the table styles out of the way, you can see the graphic clearly
through your table.
4. Enter the data in the table, select a font and font color, select a border
and border color, and align the text.
These tasks (except for selecting fonts) are described throughout this
chapter. The easiest way to choose a font and font color for a table is to
select the table and then go to the Home tab and select a font and font size.
5. Move the table squarely on top of the graphic and then make the table
and graphic roughly the same size.

Neat Table Tricks
104
Here are a few tricks that are worth knowing when you’re handling a graphic
and table:
✦In Word, you have to turn off text wrapping in order to bring the graphic
behind the table. To do that, select your graphic, go to the (Picture Tools)
Format tab, click the Text Wrapping button, and choose Behind Text on
the drop-down list.
✦If the graphic is in front of the table, select the graphic, go to the (Picture
Tools) Format tab, open the drop-down list on the Send to Back button,
and choose Send to Back (in PowerPoint) or Send Behind Text (in Word).
✦To make the graphic and table the same size, enter the same measure-
ments for both. Select the table, go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab, and
enter measurements for the table in the Height and Width boxes. Then
select the graphic, go to the (Picture Tools) Format tab, and enter the same
measurements in the Height and Width boxes. (You may have to click the
Size button to see these boxes, depending on the size of your screen.)
Placing a background picture in each PowerPoint table cell
PowerPoint offers a special command for placing a picture in each table cell
(refer to Figure 5-8). For this trick to work, you need a graphic of uniform
color; otherwise, the text is too hard to read. (You might consult Book VIII,
Chapter 3, which explains how to alter graphics with the Office Picture
Manager.) Follow these steps to place a background picture in each
PowerPoint table cell:
1. Right-click your table and choose Select Table.
2. Click the (Table Tools) Design tab.
3. Open the drop-down list on the Shading button and choose Picture.
The Insert Picture dialog box opens.
4. Select a picture and click the Insert button.
To remove the background pictures from a table, open the drop-down
list on the Shading button and choose No Fill or choose Clear Table in
the Table Styles gallery.
Drawing diagonal lines on tables
Draw diagonal lines across table cells to cancel out those cells or otherwise
make cells look different. In Figure 5-9, diagonal lines are drawn on cells to
show that information that would otherwise be in the cells is either not
available or is not relevant.

Book I
Chapter 5
Creating a Table
Neat Table Tricks
105
Select the cells that need diagonal lines, go to the (Table Tools) Design tab,
and use one of these techniques to draw diagonal lines across cells:
✦Draw Table button: Click the Draw Table button (you may have to
click the Draw Borders button first). The pointer changes into a pencil.
Drag to draw the diagonal lines. Press Esc or click the Draw Table button
a second time when you’re finished drawing.
✦Borders button: Open the drop-down list on the Borders button and
choose Diagonal Down Border or Diagonal Up Border.
To remove diagonal lines, click the Eraser button and drag across the 
diagonals.
Drawing on a table
When you want the audience to focus on data in one part of a table, draw a
circle around the data. By “draw” I mean make an Oval shape and place it
over the data you want to highlight, as shown in Figure 5-10. Book I, Chapter 8
explains the drawing tools in detail. To spare you the trouble of turning to
that chapter, here are shorthand instructions for drawing on a table:
1. On the Insert tab, open the Shapes gallery and select the Oval shape.
2. On a corner of your page or slide, away from the table, drag to draw
the oval.
Figure 5-10:

3. On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, open the drop-down list on the
Shape Fill button and choose No Fill.
4. Open the drop-down list on the Shape Outline button and choose a
very dark color.
5. Open the drop-down list on the Shape Outline button, choose Weight,
and choose a thick line.
6. Drag the oval over the data on your table that you want to highlight.
If the oval is obscured by the table, go to the (Drawing Tools) Format tab,
and click the Bring to Front button (click the Arrange button, if neces-
sary, to see this button). While you’re at it, consider rotating the oval a
little way to make it appear as though it was drawn by hand on the table.
In the course of a live PowerPoint presentation, you can draw on slides with
the Pen to highlight data. See Book IV, Chapter 4.

othing is more persuasive than a chart. The bars, pie slices, lines, or

ting a chart in a Word document, Excel worksheet, or PowerPoint slide is
fairly easy.
This explains how to create a chart. It looks at which charts are best for pre-
senting different kinds of data, how to change a chart’s appearance, and
how to save charts in a template that you can use again. You discover some
nice chart tricks, including how to make a picture the backdrop for a chart
and how to annotate a chart. It also addresses common chart problems.
A Mercifully Brief Anatomy Lesson
Throughout this chapter, I show you many ways to tinker with charts, but
before you can begin tinkering, you need to know what you’re tinkering
with. In other words, you have to know what the different parts of a chart
are. Here is a brief chart anatomy lesson. Figure 6-1 points out where some
of the terms described here are found on a real, live chart:

A Mercifully Brief Anatomy Lesson
108
✦Plot area: The center of the chart, apart from the legend and data labels,
where the data itself is presented.
✦Values: The numerical values with which the chart is plotted. The values
you enter determine the size of the data markers — the bars, columns, pie
slices, and so on — that portray value. In the column chart in Figure 6-1,
values determine the height of the columns.
✦Gridlines: Lines on the chart that indicate value measurements.
Gridlines are optional in charts (none are shown in Figure 6-1).
✦Worksheet: Where you enter (or retrieve) the data used to plot the chart.
The worksheet resembles a table. Figure 6-2 shows the worksheet I used
to enter the data that produced the chart in Figure 6-1. Notice how the
numbers at the top of the columns correspond to the numbers entered
in the worksheet shown in Figure 6-2. A worksheet is called a data table
when it appears along with a chart.

Chapter 6
Creating a Chart
The Basics: Creating a Chart
109
✦Data series: A group of related data points presented by category on a
chart. The chart in Figure 6-1 has two data series — one for Texas and
one for Utah.
✦Categories: The actual items that you want to compare or display in
your chart. In Figure 6-1, the categories are the three years in which UFO
sightings occurred in the two states.
✦Legend: A text box located to the side, top, or bottom of a chart that
identifies the chart’s data labels.
✦Horizontal and vertical axes: For plotting purposes, one side of the
plot area. In the chart in Figure 6-1, UFO sightings are plotted on the 
horizontal axis; categories are plotted on the vertical axis. Sometimes
these axes are called the category axis (or x axis) and the value axis 
(or y axis).
Axes can be confusing, but these axes aren’t as evil as they seem. All you
really need to know about them is this: You can label the axes in differ-
ent ways and you can rotate the chart so that the horizontal becomes
the vertical axis and vice versa (click the Switch Row/Column button).
✦Data point: A value plotted on a chart that is represented by a column,
line, bar, pie slice, dot, or other shape. Each data point corresponds to
a value entered in the worksheet. In Figure 6-1, for example, the data
points for Texas UFO sightings are 14 in 2005, 11 in 2006, and 9 in 2007.
Hence the Texas columns in the table rise to the 14, 11, and 9 level.
✦Data marker: Shapes on a chart that represent data points. Data mark-
ers include columns, lines, pie slices, bubbles, and dots. In Figure 6-1,
columns are the data markers.
✦Data label: A label that shows the actual values used to construct the
data markers. In the chart in Figure 6-1, there are six data labels, one on
the top of each column. Displaying data labels in charts is optional.
The good news where the anatomy of a chart is concerned is that you can
click anywhere on a chart and see a pop-up box that tells you what part of
the chart you just clicked. I wish biology class were that easy!
The Basics: Creating a Chart
Throughout this chapter, I explain the whys, wherefores, and whatnots of
creating a chart. Before going into detail, here are the basic steps that every-
one needs to know to create a chart in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. If you’re working in Excel, select the data you’ll use to generate the
chart (in Word and PowerPoint, skip to Step 3).

The Basics: Creating a Chart
110
In Excel, you select the data on a worksheet before creating the chart,
but in Word and PowerPoint, you enter the data for the chart in Excel in
Step 4. Yes, you heard me right — in Word and PowerPoint. Excel opens
after you begin creating your chart so you can enter data for the chart in
an Excel worksheet.
3. Select the kind of chart you want.
How you select a chart type depends on which program you’re working in:
• Excel: Either open the drop-down list in one of the buttons on the
Chart group (Column, Line, Pie, Bar, Area, Scatter, or Other Charts)
and then select a chart type, or click the Chart group button drop-
down list to open the Insert Chart dialog box and select a chart
there. As shown in Figure 6-3, the Insert Chart dialog box shows all
the kinds of charts you can create.
• Word and PowerPoint: Click the Chart button. You see the Insert
Chart dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-3. Select a chart and click
OK. The Excel program opens on the right side of your computer
screen.
The next portion of this chapter, “Choosing the Right Chart,” describes
all the charts types and advises you which to choose.
4. In Word and PowerPoint, replace the sample data in the Excel work-
sheet with the data you need for generating your chart.

Later in this chapter, “Providing the Raw Data for Your Chart” explains
how to enter data in an Excel worksheet. After you finish entering the
data, you can close Excel by clicking the Close button in the Excel
window or by clicking the Office button and choosing Close.
5. To modify your chart, start by selecting it.
Click a chart to select it. Selecting a chart makes the Chart Tools tabs
appear in the upper-right corner of the window. Use these tabs —
Design, Layout, and Format — to make your chart just-so.
In Word, you must be in Print Layout view to see a chart.
6. Select the (Chart Tools) Design tab when you want to change the
chart’s layout, alter the data with which the chart was generated,
or select a different chart type.
Later in this chapter, “Changing a Chart’s Appearance” explains how to
change the design of a chart.
7. Select the (Chart Tools) Layout tab when you want to change the
chart’s title, labels, or gridlines.
You can add or remove parts of a chart starting at the Layout tab.
Later in this chapter, “Changing the layout of a chart” describes how
to change around the text and gridlines on a chart.
8. Select the (Chart Tools) Format tab when you want to change the
appearance of your chart.
You can change colors and fills on your chart, as “Changing a chart ele-
ment’s color, font, or other particular” explains later in this chapter.
And if you decide to delete the chart you created? Click its perimeter to
select it and then press the Delete key.
Choosing the Right Chart
If you’re a fan of charts, the huge selection of charts can make you feel like a
kid in a candy store, but if charts aren’t your forte, the wealth of charts you
can choose from can be daunting. You can choose among six dozen charts in
11 categories (refer to Figure 6-3). Which chart is best? The golden rule for
choosing a chart type is to choose the one that presents information in the
brightest possible light. The purpose of a chart is to compare information
across different categories. Select a chart that draws out the comparison so
that others can clearly make comparisons. Table 6-1 describes the 11 chart
categories and explains in brief when to use each type of chart.

Bubble
Examine data relationships by studying the size and location of the
bubbles that represent the relationships. Bubble charts are often
used in financial analyses and market research. (Similar to an XY
scatter chart except that you can use three instead of two data
series, and the data points appear as bubbles.)
Column
Compare values in different categories against one another, usu-
ally over time. Data is displayed in vertical columns. (Same as a
bar chart except that the bars are vertical.)
Doughnut
See how values compare as percentages of a whole. (Similar to a
pie chart except that you can use more than one data series and
create concentric doughnut rings in the chart.)
Line
Examine how values fluctuate over time. Data is displayed in a set
of points connected by a line.
Pie
See how values compare as percentages of a whole. Data from
categories is displayed as a percentage of a whole. (Similar to a
doughnut chart.)
Radar
Examine data as it relates to one central point. Data is plotted on
radial points from the central point. This kind of chart is used to
make subjective performance analyses.
XY (Scatter)
Compare different numeric data point sets in space to reveal pat-
terns and trends in data. (Similar to a bubble chart except that the
data appears as points instead of bubbles.)
Stock
See how the value of an item fluctuates as well as its daily, weekly,

Every chart is constructed from raw data — the numbers and category names
you select in an Excel worksheet (in Excel) or enter in an Excel worksheet

Book I
Chapter 6
Creating a Chart
Positioning Your Chart in a Workbook, Page, or Slide
113
(in Word and PowerPoint). Book V, Chapter 1 explains in detail how to enter
data in an Excel worksheet, but here are the basics of entering data in case
you’re new to Excel:
✦Entering the data in a cell: A cell is the box in a worksheet where a
column and row intersect; each cell can contain one data item. To enter
data in a cell, click the cell and start typing. When you’re finished, press
Enter, press Tab, or click a different cell. You can also click in the
Formula bar (above the worksheet) and enter the data there.
✦Deleting the data in a cell: To delete the data in a cell, including the
sample data Excel provides for charts, click the cell and press Delete.
✦Displaying the numbers: When a number is too large to fit in a cell,
Excel displays pound signs (###) or it displays the number in scientific
notation. Don’t worry — the number is still recorded and is used to 
generate your chart. You can display large numbers by widening the
columns in which the numbers are found. Move the pointer between
column letters (A, B, and so on at the top of the worksheet), and when
you see the double-headed arrow, click and start dragging to the right.
Positioning Your Chart in a Workbook, Page, or Slide
To change the position of a chart, click to select it, click its perimeter, and
when you see the four-headed arrow, start dragging. Otherwise, follow these
instructions to land your chart where you want it to be:
✦Excel: To move your chart to a different worksheet or create a new
worksheet to hold your chart, click the Move Chart button in the
(Chart Tools) Design tab. You see the Move Chart dialog box.
• To move your chart to a different worksheet, click the Object In option
button, choose the worksheet in the drop-down list, and click OK.
• To create a new worksheet for a chart, click the New Sheet option
button, enter a name for the new worksheet, and click OK.
✦Word: Starting in Print Layout view, select your chart, and in the Page
Layout or (Chart Tools) Format tab, click the Position button (you may
have to click the Arrange button first, depending on the size of your
screen). You see a drop-down list with text-wrapping options. Choose
the option that describes how you want surrounding text to behave
when it crashes into your chart. Book II, Chapter 4 looks in detail at
wrapping text around charts and other objects in Word.
✦PowerPoint: Select the chart and drag it on the slide to the right 
position.

Changing a Chart’s Appearance
Charts are awfully nice already, but perhaps you want to redesign one.
Perhaps you’re the interior decorator type, and you want to give charts your
own personal touch. Excel, PowerPoint, and Word offer these Chart Tools
tabs for redecorating charts:
✦Design tab: For quickly changing a chart’s appearance. Go to the Design
tab if you’re in a hurry. The ready-made gallery choices give you the
opportunity to change a chart’s layout and appearance in a matter of
seconds. You can also choose a new chart type from the Design tab. See
“Relying on a chart style to change appearances,” later in this chapter.
✦Layout tab: For rearranging, hiding, and displaying various parts of a
chart, including the legend, labels, title, gridlines, and scale. Go to the
Layout tab to tweak your chart and make different parts of it stand out
or recede into the background. For example, you can display axis labels
more prominently or make them disappear, enter a title for your chart,
or display more or fewer gridlines. See “Changing the layout of a chart”
and “Handling the gridlines,” later in this chapter.
✦Format tab: For changing the color, outline, font, and font size of various
parts of a chart, including the labels, bars, and pie slices. You have to
really know what you’re doing and have a lot of time on your hands to
change colors and fonts throughout a chart. See “Changing a chart ele-
ment’s color, font, or other particular,” later in this chapter.
These pages explain how to change a chart’s appearance, starting with the
biggest change you can make — exchanging one type of chart for another.
Changing the chart type
The biggest way to overhaul a chart is to ditch it in favor of a different chart
type. Luckily for you, Office 2007 makes this task simple. I wish that changing
jobs was this easy. Follow these steps to change a pumpkin into a carriage or
an existing chart into a different kind of chart:
1. Click your chart to select it.
2. On the (Chart Tools) Design tab, click the Change Chart Type button,
or right-click your chart and choose Change Chart Type on the short-
cut menu.
The Change Chart Type dialog box appears. Does it look familiar? This is
the same dialog box you can use to create a chart in the first place.
3. Select a new chart and click OK.
Not all chart types can be converted successfully to other chart types.
You may well have created a monster, in which case go back to Step 1
and start all over or click the Undo button.

Changing the size and shape of a chart
To make a chart taller or wider, follow these instructions:
✦Click the perimeter of the chart to select it and then drag a handle on
the side to make it wider, or a handle on the top or bottom to make it
taller.
✦Select the (Chart Tools) Format tab and enter measurements in the
Height and Width boxes. You can find these boxes in the Size group
(you may have to click the Size button to see them, depending on the
size of your screen).
Relying on a chart style to change appearances
By far the easiest way to change the look of a chart is to choose an option
in the Chart Styles gallery in the (Chart Tools) Design tab, as shown in
Figure 6-4. You can choose among 50 options. These gallery options are
quite sophisticated — you would have a hard time fashioning these charts
on your own.
If your file includes more than one chart, make the charts consistent with
one another. Give them a similar appearance so that your file doesn’t turn
into a chart fashion show. You can make charts consistent with one another
by choosing similar options for charts in the Chart Styles gallery.
Select a Chart Style.

Changing the layout of a chart
Figure 6-5 identifies the chart elements that you can lay out in different ways.
Some of these elements can be removed as well as placed on different parts
of a chart. For example, you can display the legend on any side of a chart or
not display it at all. Some of the elements can be labeled in different ways.
To decide on the layout of a chart, select it and then visit the (Chart Tools)
Layout tab.
The following explains how to change the layout of a chart starting on the
(Chart Tools) Layout tab. However, before hurrying to the Layout tab
to change your chart’s layout, you may consider taking a detour to the
(Chart Tools) Design tab (refer to Figure 6-4). The Chart Layouts gallery on
the Design tab offers ten ready-made layouts, one of which may meet your
high expectations and spare you a trip to the Layout tab.
Deciding where chart elements appear and how they are labeled
The first four buttons on the Labels group of the Layout tab are for determin-
ing where elements appear on your chart and how or whether these elements
are labeled. Open the drop-down list on these buttons and choose options to
determine how and whether chart elements are labeled:
Vertical axis title
Title
Legend
Data labels
Vertical axis labels
Horizontal axis title
Horizontal axis labels
Figure 6-5:

elements of
a chart.

Book I
Chapter 6
Creating a Chart
Changing a Chart’s Appearance
117
✦Chart Title: The chart title appears above the chart and describes what
the chart is about (see Figure 6-5). Place a centered title inside or above
the chart. The Above Chart option shrinks the chart a bit to make room
for the title. Click in the text box and enter the title after Office creates a
chart title text box.
✦Axis Titles: Axis titles list the series name and category name of the data
being plotted in the chart (see Figure 6-5). You can select Rotated Title
for the vertical axis to make the axis label read vertically instead of hori-
zontally (see Figure 6-5).
✦Legend: The legend is the box to the side, top, or bottom of the chart
that describes what is being plotted (see Figure 6-5). Choose an option
from the drop-down list to place the chart’s legend above, below, or to
the side of a chart.
✦Data Labels: Data labels show the numeric values by which the data
markers — the bars, columns, pie slices, or dots — in your chart are
constructed (refer to Figure 6-5). For example, if a bar in your chart rep-
resents the number 400, the data label 400 appears in the bar. You can
also label the series name or category name by choosing More Data
Label Options on the drop-down list and making selections in the
Format Data Labels dialog box.
✦Axes: The axes labels are the series names and scale markers that
appear in the chart. Choose Primary Horizontal Axis or Primary Vertical
Axis and then select None to remove series names and scale markers
from your chart. The other axes options are for deciding how to display
axes labels (and are explained in the next section of this chapter).
Deciding how the chart’s scale and axes labels are presented
The labels and scale on the horizontal and vertical axes of a chart tell view-
ers what is being plotted on the chart. By clicking the Axes button on the
(Chart Tools) Layout tab (refer to Figure 6-5), you can fine-tune the axes
labels and scale on your chart.
After you click the Axes button, you see options for changing around your
chart’s horizontal or vertical axis. What the horizontal and vertical axis
options are depends on whether the axis you’re dealing with presents text
labels, expresses numerical values, or expresses date values.
Text axis options
Choose a text axis option on the drop-down list to remove the labels or pres-
ent category name labels in reverse order from the way in which these labels
are listed on the worksheet.

Changing a Chart’s Appearance
118
Numerical and date axis options
The axis options that pertain to numbers and dates are for declaring how to
present the scale on your chart. You can present the numbers in thousands,
millions, billions, or with a log scale. By opening the Format Axis dialog box,
as shown in Figure 6-6, you can get quite specific about how the scale is pre-
sented on your chart. To open this dialog box, click the Axes button, choose
the appropriate axis option on the drop-down list, and choose More Options
on the submenu. Which options you see in this dialog box depends greatly
on which chart type you’re dealing with.
The Format Axis dialog box offers these opportunities for changing around
the scale of a chart:
✦Changing the scale’s range: By default, the scale ranges from 0 to
10 percent more than the largest value being plotted, but you can
change the scale’s range by selecting a Fixed option button and entering
a new value in the Minimum and Maximum text box.
✦Changing the number of unit measurement labels: Label measure-
ments (and gridlines) appear at intervals on a chart according to the
number entered in the Major Unit text box. For example, an entry of 10
tells Office to mark each 10 units with a measurement label. Select the
Fixed option button and change the number in the Major Unit text box
to draw fewer or more unit labels (and gridlines) on your chart. If your
chart displays minor tick marks, do the same in the Minor Unit text box.
Figure 6-6:

dialog box.

Book I
Chapter 6
Creating a Chart
Changing a Chart’s Appearance
119
✦Displaying numbers as thousandths, millionths, or billionths: If your
chart presents large numbers, consider listing these numbers in thou-
sandths, millionths, or billionths by selecting an option in the Display
Units drop-down list. You can also select the Logarithmic Scale check
box to display numbers as logarithms.
✦Changing the tick-mark scale markers: Choose Tick Mark options to tell
Office where or whether to place tick marks — small unit markers — on
the scale.
✦Changing the location of axis labels: Choose an option in the Axis Labels
drop-down list to tell Office where to place the unit labels on the scale.
✦Change the horizontal axis cross: Select the Axis Value option button
and then enter a measurement in the Axis Value text box if you want to
change the baseline of your chart. Usually, the horizontal axis is set at 0,
and markers rise from 0 on the chart; but by entering a different measure-
ment, you can make markers rise or fall from the baseline. For example,
if the Axis Value baseline is 5, markers less than 5 fall from a baseline in
the middle of the chart and markers greater than 5 rise above it.
Handling the gridlines
Gridlines are lines that cross a chart and indicate value measurements. In most
charts, you can include major gridlines to show where bars or columns meet
or surpass a major unit of measurement. You can also include fainter, minor
gridlines that mark less significant measurements. Figure 6-7 shows a chart
with gridlines displayed in different ways.
Figure 6-7:
Options for

Changing a Chart’s Appearance
120
Select your chart and follow these instructions to hide or display gridlines,
change the lines’ width, or change the lines’ color:
✦Hiding and choosing the frequency of gridlines: On the Layout tab,
click the Gridlines button, choose Primary Horizontal Gridlines or
Primary Vertical Gridlines on the drop-down list, and choose an option
on the submenu. You can hide gridlines (by choosing None), display
major gridlines, display minor gridlines, or display major and minor
gridlines (refer to Figure 6-7).
The frequency of gridlines on a chart is tied to the scale. If you want to
control the frequency of the gridlines on your own without relying on a
Gridlines option, change your chart’s scale. The preceding section in
this chapter explains how to handle scales.
✦Changing gridline width: On the Format tab, open the Chart Elements
drop-down list and choose Axis Major Gridlines or Axis Minor Gridlines
(display gridlines on your chart if you don’t see these options). Then
click the Format Selection button, and in the Line Style category of the
Format Gridlines dialog box, enter a measurement in the Width text box
to make the gridlines wider or narrower.
✦Changing gridline color: On the Format tab, open the Chart Elements
drop-down list and select Axis Major Gridlines or Axis Minor Gridlines
(display gridlines on your chart if you don’t see these options).
Then open the drop-down list on the Shape Outline button and choose
a color. You can also click the Format Selection button, and in the
Line category of the Format Gridlines dialog box, select the Solid Line
option button and then click the Color Picker button and choose a color
there.
Gridlines are essential for helping read charts, but be very, very careful
about displaying minor gridlines on charts. These lines can make your chart
unreadable. They can turn a perfectly good chart into a gaudy pinstripe suit.
Changing a chart element’s color, 
font, or other particular
Generally speaking, the (Chart Tools) Format tab is the place to go if you
want to change the color, line width, font, or font size of a chart element. 
As I explain shortly, you can do some interior decorating tasks on the Layout
tab as well.
Follow these basic steps on the Format tab to change a color, line width,
font, or font size in part of a chart:

Book I
Chapter 6
Creating a Chart
Changing a Chart’s Appearance
121
1. Select the (Chart Tools) Format tab.
The tools on the (Chart Tools) Format tab are very similar to the tools
found on the (Drawing Tools) Format tab. You can find all the tools you
need here to change the color, outline, and size of a chart element.
These tools are explained in detail in Book I, Chapter 8.
2. Select the chart element that needs a facelift.
To select a chart element, either click it or select its name on the Chart
Elements drop-down list. You can find this list in the upper-left corner of
the window, as shown in Figure 6-8.
3. Format the chart element you selected.
Use one of these techniques to format the chart element:
• Open a Format dialog box. Click the Format Selection button to open
a Format dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-8. The dialog box offers
commands for formatting the element you select.
• Do the work on your own. Format the chart element as you would any
object. For example, to change fonts in the chart element you select,
right-click and then choose a font in the Mini Toolbar, as shown in
Figure 6-8. Or go to the Home tab to change font sizes. Or open the
drop-down list on the Shape Fill button on the Format tab and select
a new color.
Select part of the chart.
Click the Format Selection button.

Saving a Chart as a Template so You Can Use It Again
122
The (Chart Tools) Layout tab also offers these convenient commands for
changing the color of a chart element:
✦Plot area: The plot area is the rectangle in which the chart’s gridlines,
bars, columns, pie slices, or lines appear. In some chart designs, the plot
area is filled with color. To remove this color or choose a different color,
click the Plot Area button and choose an option. Choose More Plot Area
Options to open the Format Plot Area dialog box and select a new fill
color.
✦3D chart wall and chart floor: Three-dimensional charts have chart
walls and a chart floor. The chart wall forms the backdrop of a 3D chart;
the chart floor forms the bottom of the chart. Click the Chart Wall button
and choose an option to remove the chart wall or change its color; click
the Chart Floor button and choose an option to remove the chart floor
or change its color.
Saving a Chart as a Template so You Can Use It Again
If you go to the significant trouble of redecorating a chart and you expect
to do it again the same way in the future, save your chart as a template.
This way, you can call on the template in the future to create the same chart
and not have to decorate it again. Perhaps you’ve created charts with your
company’s colors or you’ve created a chart that you’re especially proud of.
Save it as a template to spare yourself the work of reconstructing it.
A chart template holds data series colors, gridline settings, plot area colors,
font settings, and the like. It doesn’t hold data. These pages explain how to save
a chart as a template and how to create a chart with a template you created.
Saving a chart as a template
Follow these steps to make a template out of a chart:
1. Save your file to make sure the chart settings are saved on your 
computer.
2. Select your chart.
3. Click the (Chart Tools) Design tab.
4. Click the Save As Template button.
You can find this button in the Type group. You see the Save Chart
Template dialog box.

5. Enter a descriptive name for the template and click the Save button.
Include the type of chart you’re dealing with in the name. This helps you
understand which template you’re selecting when the time comes to
choose a chart template.
By default, chart templates are saved in this folder in Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application
Data\Microsoft\Templates\Charts
In computers that run Windows Vista, chart templates are saved in this folder:
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\
Microsoft\Templates\Charts
The templates have the .rctrx extension. If you want to delete or rename a
template, open the Charts folder in Windows Explorer or My Computer and
do your deleting and renaming there. You can open the Charts folder very
quickly by clicking the Manage Templates button in the Insert Chart dialog box.
Creating a chart from a template
To create a chart from your own customized template, open the Create Chart
dialog box and then click Templates in the dialog box. The dialog box shows
a list of templates you created. Move the pointer over a template to read its
name in a pop-up box. Select a template and click OK.
Chart Tricks for the Daring and Heroic
This chapter wouldn’t be complete without a handful of chart tricks to
impress your friends and intimidate your enemies. In the pages that follow,
you discover how to make charts roll over and play dead. You also find out
how to decorate a chart with a picture, annotate a chart, display worksheet
data alongside a chart, and create an overlay chart.
Decorating a chart with a picture
As shown in Figure 6-9, a picture looks mighty nice on the plot area of a
chart — especially a column chart. If you have a picture in your computer
that would serve well to decorate a chart, you are hereby encouraged to start
decorating. Follow these steps to place a picture in the plot area of a chart:
1. Select your chart.

Chart Tricks for the Daring and Heroic
124
2. On the (Chart Tools) Format tab, open the drop-down list on the Shape
Fill button and choose Picture.
You see the Insert Picture dialog box.
3. Locate the picture you need and select it.
Try to select a light-colored picture that will serve as a background.
Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains how you can recolor a picture to make it
lighter.
4. Click the Insert button.
The picture lands in your chart.
5. On the (Chart Tools) Format tab, open the Chart Elements drop-down
list and choose Plot Area.
In Word and Excel, the plot area obscures the picture. In the next step,
you fix this problem.
6. Still in the (Chart Tools) Format tab, open the drop-down list on the
Shape Fill button and choose No Fill.
You may need to change the color of the data markers — the columns,
bars, lines, or pie slices — on your chart to make them stand out against
the picture you chose. See “Changing a chart element’s color, font, or
other particular,” earlier in this chapter.

Annotating a chart
To highlight part of a chart — an especially large pie slice, a tall column, or a
bar showing miniscule sales figures — annotate it with a callout text box and
place the text box beside the pie slice, column, or bar. Figure 6-10 shows an
example of an annotated chart. The annotation tells you that one sector isn’t
performing especially well and somebody ought to get on the ball.
To annotate a chart, select a callout shape, enter text in the callout shape, and
connect the shape to part of your chart. Follow these steps to annotate a chart:
1. Select your chart and go to the (Chart Tools) Layout tab.
2. Click the Shapes button, scroll to the Callouts section of the drop-
down list, and choose a callout.
Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Insert
button to get to the Shapes button.
3. Drag your slide to draw the callout shape.
Book I, Chapter 8 explains drawing shapes in gory detail.
4. Type the annotation inside the callout shape.
5. Resize the callout shape as necessary to make it fit with the chart.
6. Drag the yellow diamond on the callout shape to attach the callout to
the chart.
You probably have to do some interior decorating to make the callout
color fit with the chart. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to change an
object’s color.

Displaying the raw data alongside the chart
Showing the worksheet data used to produce a chart is sort of like showing
the cops your I.D. It proves you’re the real thing. It makes your chart more
authentic. If yours is a simple pie chart or other chart that wasn’t generated
with a large amount of raw data, you can display the data alongside your
chart in a data table. Anyone who sees the table knows you’re not kidding
or fudging the numbers.
Select your chart and use of one of these techniques to place a table with
the raw data below your chart:
✦In the (Chart Tools) Layout tab, click the Data Table button and choose
an option on the drop-down list.
✦In the (Chart Tools) Design tab, open the Chart Layouts gallery and
select a layout that includes a data table.
To format a data table, go to the (Chart Tools) Format tab and select Data
Table in the Chart Elements drop-down list. Then click the Format Selection
button. You see the Format Data Table dialog box, where you can fill the
table with color and choose colors for the lines in the table.
Creating an overlay chart
An overlay chart is a secondary chart that appears over another chart, the
idea is to contrast two sets of data. Create an overlay chart by selecting one
data series in a chart you already created and instructing Office to use the
data in the series for the overlay chart. To create an overlay chart, the origi-
nal chart must plot more than one data series. Figure 6-11 shows a bar chart
overlaying a stacked area chart.

Troubleshooting a Chart
127
Follow these steps to create an overlay chart:
1. In a chart you created, click to select the data series that you will use
to create the secondary chart.
The easiest way to select a data series is to click the chart itself, but you
can also go to the (Chart Tools) Format tab and choose a series in the
Chart Elements drop-down list.
2. Right-click the data series you selected and choose Change Series
Chart Type.
You see the Change Chart Type dialog box.
3. Choose a chart type for the overlay chart and click OK.
Be sure to click a chart type different from the one in the other chart.
Troubleshooting a Chart
Sometimes tinkering with a chart opens a Pandora’s Box of problems. You find
yourself having to correct little errors that appear in charts. Here are some
shorthand instructions for fixing common chart problems:
✦The dates in the chart aren’t formatted right: Dates in a chart are inherited
from the Excel worksheet from which the chart is generated. Therefore,
to change date formats, you have to go back to the worksheet and
change date formats there. Book V, Chapter 1 explains how to format
dates and numbers in Excel.
✦The numbers in the chart aren’t formatted right: To change the number of
decimal places, include comma separators in numbers, display currency
symbols, or do all else that pertains to numbers, click the (Chart Tools)
Format tab, open the Chart Elements drop-down list, and choose
Horizontal (Value) Axis or Vertical (Value) Axis. Then click the Format
Selection button. You see the Format Axis dialog box. Click the Number
category and select options for displaying numbers.
✦“Category 1” or “Series 1” appears in the chart legend: To direct you to
the right place to enter data in Excel worksheets, phantom names such
as “Category 1” and “Series 1” appear in worksheets. Sometimes these
phantoms wind up in chart legends as well. To remove them, click the
Select Data button on the Design tab. The Excel worksheet and the
Select Data Source dialog box open. Select Category 1 or Series 1 in the
dialog box, click the Remove button, and click OK.

Troubleshooting a Chart
128
✦In 3D charts, small markers are obscured by large markers in the foreground:
For all the data markers to be shown in a 3D chart, the smaller ones
have to be in the foreground. To rearrange data markers, go to the
Design tab, click the Select Data button to open the Select Data Source
dialog box. Then select a series and click the Up or Down button to
rearrange the series in your chart. Series that are high on the list go to
the back of the chart; series that are low on the list go to the front.
✦The chart doesn’t gather all data from the worksheet: Click the trusty
Select Data Source button to open the Select Data Source dialog box.
In the dialog box, click the Chart Data Range button (it’s located to the
right of the Chart Data Range text box). Then, on the Excel worksheet,
drag to select the data you want to generate your chart and press Enter.
Click OK in the Select Data Source dialog box.
✦The scale is too big for my chart: Especially if the scale range on a chart is
small, the scale can be too big compared to the data markers. To change
the scale range, go to the (Chart Tools) Layout tab, click the Axes
button, choose the appropriate axis option on the drop-down list, and
choose More Options. Then in the Format Axis dialog box, select the
Fixed option button and enter a Maximum value to establish the top of
the scale for your chart. For more details, see “Deciding how the chart’s
scale and axes labels are presented,” earlier in this chapter.

A
long with charts and tables, diagrams are the best way to present your
ideas. Diagrams clearly show, for example, employees’ relationships
with one another, product cycles, workflow processes, and spheres of influ-
ence. A diagram is an excellent marriage of images and words. Diagrams
allow an audience to literally visualize a concept, idea, or relationship.
This chapter explains how to construct diagrams from SmartArt graphics
and how to create a diagram. It shows how to customize diagrams by chang-
ing the size of diagrams and diagram shapes, adding and removing shapes,
and changing shapes’ colors. You also discover how to change the direction
of a diagram and enter the text. Finally, this chapter demonstrates how to
create a diagram from scratch with shapes and connectors.
The Basics: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
In Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, diagrams are made from SmartArt graphics.
These diagram graphics are “interactive” in the sense that you can move,
alter, and write text on them. In other words, you can use them to construct
diagrams. Because SmartArt graphics are based on the eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) format (Book I, Chapter 1 explains XML), you can alter
them to your liking. You can make the diagram portray precisely what
you want it to portray, although you usually have to wrestle with the dia-
gram a bit.

The Basics: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
130
The first step in creating a diagram is to select a layout in the dialog box, as
shown in Figure 7-1. After you create the initial diagram, you customize it
to create a diagram of your own. About 80 diagrams are in the dialog box.
They fall into these seven types:
Diagram Type
Use
List
For describing blocks of related information as well as
sequential steps in a task, process, or workflow
Process
For describing how a concept or physical process changes
over time or is modified

If you intend to construct a “flow chart type” diagram with many branches
and levels, go to the Hierarchy category and select the Organization Chart or
one of the hierarchy diagrams. As “Laying Out the Diagram Shapes” explains
later in this chapter, only these choices permit you to make a diagram with
many different branches and levels.
After you select a generic diagram in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog
box and click OK, the next step is to make the diagram your own by complet-
ing these tasks:
✦Change the diagram’s size and position: Change the size and position of
a diagram to make it fit squarely on your slide. See “Changing the Size
and Position of a Diagram,” later in this chapter.
✦Add shapes to (or remove shapes from) the diagram: Adding a shape
involves declaring where to add the shape, promoting or demoting the
shape with respect to other shapes, and declaring how the new shape
connects to another shape. See “Laying Out the Diagram Shapes,” later
in this chapter.
✦Enter text: Enter text on each shape, or component, of the diagram. See
“Handling the Text on Diagram Shapes,” later in this chapter.
If you so desire, you can also customize your diagram by taking on some or
all of these tasks:
✦Changing its overall appearance: Choose a different color scheme or
3D variation for your diagram. See “Choosing a Look for Your Diagram,”
later in this chapter.
✦Changing shapes: Select a new shape for part of your diagram, change
the size of a shape, or assign different colors to shapes to make shapes
stand out. See “Changing the Appearance of Diagram Shapes,” later in
this chapter.
If you’re comfortable creating a diagram of your own by drawing shapes and
lines, no law says you have to begin in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog
box. Later in this chapter, “Creating a Diagram from Scratch” looks into cre-
ating a diagram by making use of text boxes, lines, and shapes.
Creating the Initial Diagram
The first step in fashioning a diagram is to choose a SmartArt graphic in the
Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box. After that, you roll up your sleeves,
change the diagram’s size and shape, and enter the text. If you select the
wrong diagram to start with, all is not lost. You can choose another diagram

in its place, although how successful swapping one diagram for another is
depends on how lucky you are and how far along you are in creating your
diagram. These pages explain how to create an initial diagram and swap
one diagram for another.
Creating a diagram
Follow these steps to create a diagram:
1. On the Insert tab, click the SmartArt button.
You see the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box (refer to Figure 7-1).
In PowerPoint, you can also open the dialog box by clicking the SmartArt
icon in a content placeholder frame.
2. Select a diagram in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box.
Diagrams are divided into seven types, as I explain earlier in this chap-
ter. The dialog box offers a description of each diagram. Either select a
type on the left side of the dialog box or scroll the entire list to find the
graphic that most resembles the diagram you want.
In the Hierarchy category, select the Organization Chart, Hierarchy,
or Horizontal Hierarchy if you want to create a graph with many levels
and branches. These three diagrams are much more complex than the
others. See “Laying Out the Diagram Shapes,” later in this chapter, for
details.
3. Click OK.
The next section in this chapter explains how to swap one diagram for
another, in case you chose wrongly in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic
dialog box.
Starting from a sketch
You can spare yourself a lot of trouble by start-
ing from a sketch when you create a diagram.
Find a pencil with a good eraser, grab a blank
piece of paper, and start drawing. Imagine what
your ideal diagram looks like. Draw the arrows
or lines connecting the different parts of the
diagram. Write the text. Draw the diagram that
best illustrates what you want to communicate.
Later, in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog
box (refer to Figure 7-1), you can select the dia-
gram that most resembles the one you sketched.
The dialog box offers about 80 types of diagrams.
Unless you start from a sketch and have a solid
idea of the diagram you want, you can get lost
in the dialog box. Also, if you don’t start from a
sketch, adding shapes to the diagram and land-
ing them in the right places can be a chore.

Swapping one diagram for another
If the diagram you chose initially doesn’t do the job, you can swap it for a
different diagram. How successful the swap is depends on how far along you
are in creating your diagram and whether your diagram is simple or com-
plex. Follow these steps to swap one diagram for another:
1. Click your diagram to select it.
2. Click the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab.
3. Open the Layout gallery. (You may have to click the Change Layout
button first.)
You see a gallery with diagrams of the same type as the diagram you’re
working with.
4. Select a new diagram or choose More Layouts to open the Choose a
SmartArt Graphic dialog box and select a diagram there.
You may have to click the trusty Undo button and start all over if the dia-
gram you selected for the swap didn’t do the job.
Changing the Size and Position of a Diagram
To make a diagram fit squarely on a page or slide, you have to change its size
and position. Resizing and positioning diagrams and other objects is the sub-
ject of Book I, Chapter 8, but in case you don’t care to travel that far to get
instructions, here are shorthand instructions for resizing and positioning
diagrams:
✦Resizing a diagram: Select the diagram, move the pointer over a selec-
tion handle on the corner or side, and start dragging after the pointer
changes into a two-headed arrow. You can also go to the (SmartArt
Tools) Format tab and enter new measurements in the Width and Height
boxes (you may have to click the Size button to see these text boxes,
depending on the size of your screen).
✦Repositioning a diagram: Select the diagram, move the pointer over
its perimeter, and when you see the four-headed arrow, click and start
dragging.
Notice when you resize a diagram that the shapes in the diagram change size
proportionally. Most diagrams are designed so that shapes fill out the diagram.
When you change the size of a diagram, remove a shape from a diagram, or
add a shape, shapes change size within the diagram.

Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
134
Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
At the heart of every diagram are the rectangles, circles, arrows, and what-
nots that make the diagram what it is. These shapes illustrate the concept or
idea you want to express to your audience. Your biggest challenge when cre-
ating a diagram is laying out the diagram shapes.
How you add shapes depends on what kind of diagram you’re working with.
Hierarchy diagrams present problems where adding shapes is concerned
because these diagrams branch into many levels and can be very complex.
For that reason, the techniques for adding shapes to hierarchy diagrams are
different from the techniques for adding shapes to the other diagrams.
These pages explain how to select diagram shapes, add shapes, and remove
shapes from diagrams. They offer instructions specific to working with hier-
archy diagrams.
Selecting a diagram shape
Before you can remove a shape from a diagram or indicate where you want
to add a new shape, you have to select a diagram shape. Selecting a shape
isn’t simply a matter of clicking if text has been written on the shape. Follow
these instructions to select a diagram shape:
✦Selecting a shape with text: Click the shape twice, as shown in Figure 7-2.
First, click anywhere in the shape and then move the pointer to the
perimeter of the shape; click after a four-headed arrow appears beside
the pointer.
✦Selecting a shape without text: Simply click anywhere in the shape.
You can tell when a diagram shape is selected because a solid, not a dotted
line, appears around the shape (see Figure 7-2). When you see dotted lines
around a shape, you’re expected to enter text.
Select a diagram shape.

Removing a shape from a diagram
Removing a shape from a diagram is as easy as falling off a turnip truck as
long as you correctly select the shape before you remove it (the preceding
section in this chapter explains how to select shapes). To remove a shape,
select it and then press Delete. Other shapes grow larger when you remove
a shape in keeping with the “fill out the diagram by any means necessary”
philosophy.
Adding shapes to diagrams apart 
from hierarchy diagrams
Unlike hierarchy diagrams, list, process, cycle, relationship, and matrix 
diagrams don’t have branches. They always travel in one direction only.
This makes adding shapes to these diagrams fairly straightforward. To add a
shape, you select a shape in the diagram and then add the new shape so that
it appears before or after the shape you selected, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Follow these steps to add a shape to a list, process, cycle, relationship,
matrix, or pyramid diagram:
1. In your diagram, select the shape that your new shape will appear
before or after.
Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting a diagram shape” explains how to
select shapes.
Choose Add Shape After 
or Add Shape Before.

2. Choose the Add Shape After or Add Shape Before command.
To get to these commands, use one of these techniques:
• On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the
Add Shape button and choose Add Shape After or Add Shape Before,
as shown in Figure 7-3.
• Right-click the shape you selected, choose Add Shape on the short-
cut menu, and then choose Add Shape After or Add Shape Before on
the submenu.
The new shape appears in your diagram.
Although the Add Shape drop-down list offers an Add Shape Above and Add
Shape Below command (see Figure 7-3), these commands don’t apply to list,
process, cycle, relationship, or matrix diagrams. Ignore them. They’re strictly
for hierarchy and pyramid diagrams.
Adding shapes to hierarchy diagrams
Hierarchy diagrams are more complex than other diagrams because they
branch out such that shapes are found on different levels. This branching
out makes adding shapes to hierarchy diagrams problematic.
In the first place, the Add Shape commands do different things on hierarchy
diagrams, depending on whether the diagram is horizontally or vertically
oriented. In hierarchy diagrams, you can promote and demote shapes.
You can’t do that in other diagrams. If you’re working with an Organization
Chart, you get a set of commands — the Layout commands — for making
shapes hang rather than fall below other shapes.
These pages explain how to add shapes to vertically oriented diagrams, 
horizontally oriented diagrams, and Organization Charts. (One hierarchy 
diagram, Hierarchy List, is just two right-hanging diagram shapes, and it
isn’t truly a hierarchy diagram.)
Adding shapes to horizontally oriented diagrams
A horizontally oriented diagram (Horizontal Hierarchy and Horizontal Labeled
Hierarchy) is a simple branching, horizontal diagram. In a horizontally oriented
diagram, shapes can branch only from a shape in the level above; shapes
can’t branch sideways from one another, as they can in an Organization
Chart diagram. Figure 7-4 shows a Horizontal Hiserarchy diagram along with
the Add Shape drop-down list for adding shapes to diagrams.
As Figure 7-4 shows, the Add Shape commands are a little cockeyed when
you apply them to a horizontally oriented diagram. The Add Shape Above
command, for example, places a new shape to the left, not above, the shape
you selected. For the purpose of adding shapes to horizontally oriented dia-
grams, the Add Shape commands are based on rank, not gravity. The Add

Book I
Chapter 7
Making a SmartArt
Diagram
Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
137
Shape Above command, for example, places a new shape a rank above, not
directly above, another shape.
Follow these steps to add a shape to a horizontally oriented diagram:
1. In your diagram, select the shape to which your new shape will be
connected.
Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting a diagram shape” demonstrates how to
select a shape.
2. Choose an Add Shape command.
Figure 7-4 shows what Add Shape commands do. You can choose Add
Shape commands with one of these techniques:
• On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the
Add Shape button and choose an Add Shape command (refer to
Figure 7-4).
• Right-click the shape you selected, choose Add Shape on the short-
cut menu, and then choose an Add Shape command.
In effect, you choose two commands when you choose Add Shape
Above — you insert a shape above the shape you selected and you
demote the shape you selected to the next level in the hierarchy.
The Add Shape Above command demotes the shape you selected to the
next lowest level to make room for the new shape. Rather than choose
the Add Shape Above command, you might consider selecting a shape
in the level above and then choosing the Add Shape Below command.
Choose an Add Shape command.

Adding shapes to vertically oriented diagrams
Follow these steps to add a shape to the vertically oriented Hierarchy,
Labeled Hierarchy, or Table Hierarchy diagram:
1. Select the shape to which your new shape will be connected.
Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting a diagram shape” demonstrates how to
select a shape.
2. Choose an Add Shape command.
You can choose Add Shape commands with either of these techniques:
• On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the
Add Shape button and choose an Add Shape command.
• Right-click the shape you selected, choose Add Shape on the short-
cut menu, and then choose an Add Shape command.
The Add Shape Before command places the new shape to the left of the
shape you selected; the Add Shape After command places the new
shape to the right.
Be careful about choosing the Add Shape Above command because it inserts
a new shape above the one you selected and demotes the selected shape.
You add another layer to the hierarchy when you select the Add Shape
Above command.
Handling shapes on Organization Charts
An Organization Chart offers many opportunities for connecting shapes.
The shapes can branch out from one another in four directions as well as
appear to the side in the “assistant” position. When you place one shape
below another shape, you can make the new shape hang so that it is joined
to a line, not joined directly to the shape above it. Figure 7-5 shows what
hanging shapes look like. Compare the standard connection to the hanging
connections — Left Hanging, Right Hanging, and Both. Hanging shapes con-
nect to a line that drops, or hangs, from a shape above.
To add a shape to an Organization Chart diagram, decide where you want
the shape to go, and if you want to place one shape below another, decide
whether you want a hanging or standard relationship. These pages explain
how to add shapes and create hanging relationships between one shape and
the shapes below it.

Book I
Chapter 7
Making a SmartArt

Adding a shape
Follow these steps to add a shape to an Organization Chart diagram:
1. Select the shape to which you will add a new shape.
Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting a diagram shape” explains how to
select shapes. As shown in Figure 7-6, shapes are surrounded by solid
lines, not dotted lines, when you select them properly.
2. Choose an Add Shape command.
You can choose Add Shape commands in two ways:
• On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the
Add Shape button and choose an Add Shape command (see Figure 7-6).
• Right-click the shape you selected, choose Add Shape on the short-
cut menu, and then choose an Add Shape command on the submenu.
Figure 7-6 demonstrates what the Add Shape commands do. Notice that
Add Shape Before places a new shape to the left of the shape you selected;
Add Shape After places a new shape to the right.
Be careful about choosing the Add Shape Above command. This com-
mand effectively bumps the shape you selected to a lower level in order
to make room for the new shape. In effect, you demote one shape when
you place a new shape above it.
Click the Layout button to establish a hanging relationship between shapes.
Figure 7-5:
Ways that

diagrams.

Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
140
The Add Assistant command creates an intermediary shape between two
levels, as shown in Figure 7-6. The command is called “Add Assistant”
because assistants don’t have a ranking in organization charts. Executive
assistants, secretaries, and the like are attached to the bigwigs of the organi-
zation and don’t have a real place in the hierarchy, although everyone knows
they do most of the work.
Add Assistant shapes land on the left side of the line to which they’re
attached, but if you prefer the assistant shape to be on the right side of the
line, you can drag it to the right.
Hanging a shape below another shape
Besides the standard relationship between shapes above and below one
another, you can create a hanging relationship. Earlier in this chapter,
Figure 7-5 shows the three kinds of hanging relationships — Both, Left
Hanging, and Right Hanging. In a hanging relationship, the line hangs from
a shape, and subordinate shapes are connected to the line.
You can create a hanging relationship between shapes before or after you
create the subordinate shapes. Follow these steps to create a hanging 
relationship:
Choose an Add Shape command.
Select a shape.

1. Select the shape to which other shapes will hang or are hanging.
2. Select the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab.
3. Click the Layout button (refer to Figure 7-5).
4. Select an option on the drop-down list — Both, Left Hanging, or Right
Hanging.
The Standard option on the drop-down list is for creating a standard
relationship, not a hanging relationship.
Promoting and demoting shapes 
in hierarchy diagrams
Shapes in hierarchy diagrams are ranked by level. If a shape is on the wrong
level, you can move it higher or lower in the diagram by clicking the Promote
or Demote button on the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab. Promoting and demot-
ing shapes can turn into a donnybrook if you aren’t careful. If the shapes
being promoted or demoted are attached to subordinate shapes, the subor-
dinate shapes are promoted or demoted as well. This can have unforeseen
and sometimes horrendous consequences.
Follow these steps to promote or demote a shape (and its subordinates) in a
hierarchy diagram:
1. Select the shape that needs a change of rank.
You can select more than one shape by Ctrl+clicking.
2. Select the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab.
3. Click the Promote or Demote button.
Do you like what you see? If not, you may have to click the Undo button
and start all over.
Handling the Text on Diagram Shapes
When you create a new diagram, “[Text]” (the word Text enclosed in brackets)
appears on shapes. Your job is to replace this generic placeholder with
something more meaningful and less bland. These pages explain how to
enter text and bulleted lists on shapes. You also discover how to enter text
on shapes you create. These shapes don’t come with the generic [Text],
which makes entering the text slightly problematic.

Handling the Text on Diagram Shapes
142
Entering text on a shape
You can click in the middle of a shape and start typing to enter text, or you
can visit the Text pane, which provides another, simpler way to enter text.
Follow these steps to open the Text pane and enter the text there:
1. Select your diagram.
2. Select the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab.
3. Either click the Text Pane button or click the same button to the left of
the diagram.
The Text pane opens to the left of the diagram, as shown on the bottom
of Figure 7-7. The figure also shows the two places you can click to open
the Text pane.
4. Enter the text in the Text pane.
As you enter text, the diagram shapes are selected so that you know
which shape you’re entering text on.
5. Click the Close button (the X) in the Text pane to close the pane.
If you make a spelling error, click either Text Pane button to reopen the
Text pane and correct it.

The text in diagrams shrinks as you enter more text so that all text is the
same size. If you want to make the text larger or smaller in one shape, see
“Changing fonts and font sizes on shapes,” later in this chapter.
Entering text in a diagram shape you added
Diagram shapes you add on your own don’t come with the generic [Text]
placeholder. Select your newly minted shape and do one of the following to
enter text on it:
✦Click the Text Pane button to display the Text pane (see Figure 7-7).
You see a blank place in the Text pane for entering text for your new
shape. Enter the text in the Text pane.
✦Click in the diagram shape and start typing. That’s all there is to it.
Turning a bulleted list into a diagram
Suppose you’re working along when
suddenly it strikes you — a bulleted
list in a text frame or text box would
work much better as a diagram. For those occa-
sions, you can click the Convert to SmartArt
button. By clicking this button, you can turn the
text in a text frame or text box into a diagram. If
the text frame or box contains a bulleted list,
each bulleted item becomes a diagram shape.
Follow these steps to turn a text frame or text
box into a diagram:
1. Select the text frame or text box.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the Convert to SmartArt button.
You see a drop-down list with basic dia-
gram choices.
4. Either select a diagram on the list or
choose More SmartArt Graphics to open
the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box
and select a diagram there.

144
Entering bulleted lists on diagram shapes
Some diagram shapes have built-in bulleted lists, but no matter — whether a
shape is prepared to be bulleted or not, you can enter bullets in a diagram
shape. Here are instructions for entering and removing bullets:
✦Entering a bulleted list: Select the shape that needs bullets, and in the
(SmartArt Tools) Design tab, click the Add Bullet button. When you click
inside the shape, the first bullet appears. Either enter the bulleted items
directly into the shape (pressing Enter as you type each entry), or click
the Text Pane button to open the Text pane (refer to Figure 7-7) and
enter bullets there.
✦Removing bulleted items: Click before the first bulleted entry and keep
pressing the Delete key until you have removed all the bulleted items.
You can also start in the Text pane (refer to Figure 7-7) and press the
Delete key there until you’ve removed the bulleted items, or drag to
select several bulleted items and then press Delete.
Changing a Diagram’s Direction
As long as your diagram is horizontally oriented, you can change its direc-
tion. As shown in Figure 7-8, you can flip it over such that the rightmost
shape in your diagram becomes the leftmost shape, and what was the left-
most shape becomes the rightmost shape. If arrows are in your diagram, the
arrows point the opposite direction after you flip the diagram. You can’t flip
vertically oriented diagrams this way. Sorry, but diagrams that run north to
south, not west to east, can’t be rolled over.

Choosing a Look for Your Diagram
Decide how a diagram looks by starting on the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab.
Starting there, you can choose a color scheme for your diagram and a 3D or
other style. Between the Change Colors drop-down list and the SmartArt
Styles gallery, you can find a combination of options that presents your dia-
gram in the best light:
✦Change Colors drop-down list: Offers color schemes for your diagram,
as shown in Figure 7-9. Point at a few options to “live-preview” them.
✦SmartArt Styles gallery: Offers Simple and 3D variations on the diagram.

If your Word document, Excel worksheet, or PowerPoint presentation
includes many diagrams, make sure your diagrams are consistent in appear-
ance. Choose similar colors for diagrams. If you like 3D diagrams, make the
majority of your diagrams 3D. Don’t let the diagrams overwhelm the ideas
they are meant to express. The point is to present ideas in diagrams, not
turn your work into a SmartArt diagram showcase.
Changing the Appearance of Diagram Shapes
To call attention to one part of a diagram, you can change the appearance of
a shape and make it stand out. Any part of a diagram that is different from
the other parts naturally gets more attention. To change the appearance of a
shape, consider changing its size or color, exchanging one shape for another,
or changing the font and font size of the text. These topics are covered in the
following pages.
Before you can do anything to a diagram shape, you have to properly select
it. Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting a diagram shape” explains selecting
shapes in detail.
Changing the size of a diagram shape
A shape that is larger than other shapes in a diagram gets the attention of
the audience. Select your shape and use one of these techniques to enlarge
or shrink it:
✦In the (SmartArt Tools) Format tab, click the Larger or Smaller button as
many times as necessary to make the shape the right size.
✦Move the pointer over a corner selection handle, and when the pointer
changes to a two-headed arrow, click and start dragging.
Notice that the text inside the shape remains the same size although the
shape is larger. To change the size of the text in a shape, see “Changing fonts
and font sizes on shapes,” later in this chapter.
To return a diagram shape to its original size after you’ve fooled with it,
right-click the shape and choose Reset Shape or click the Reshape button
on the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab.
Exchanging one shape for another
Another way to call attention to an important part of a diagram is to change
shapes, as shown in Figure 7-10. Rather than a conventional shape, use an
oval, block arrow, or star. You can substitute a shape in the Shapes gallery
for any diagram shape (Book I, Chapter 8 explores the Shapes gallery).
To exchange one shape for another in a diagram, select the shape and use
one of these techniques:

✦In the (SmartArt Tools) Format tab, click the Change Shape button and
select a shape in the Shapes gallery.
✦Right-click the shape, choose Change Shape on the shortcut menu, and
select a shape on the submenu.
Changing a shape’s color, fill, or outline
Yet another way to call attention to a shape is to change its color, fill, or out-
line border. Select a shape and go to the (SmartArt Tools) Format tab, as
shown in Figure 7-11, to change a shape’s color, fill, or outline.
✦Restyling a shape: Select an option in the Shape Styles gallery to give a
shape a makeover.
✦Filling a shape with a new color: Click the Shape Fill button and make a
choice from the drop-down list to choose a color, picture, two-color gra-
dient, or texture for the shape.
✦Changing the outline: Click the Shape Outline button and choose a
color and weight for the shape’s border on the drop-down list.
✦Applying a shape effect: Click the Shape Effects button to select a shape
effect for your shape.

Changing fonts and font sizes on shapes
To make a diagram shape stand out, try changing the font and font size of
the text on the diagram. Before you change fonts and font sizes, however,
you should know that changing fonts in a shape effectively disconnects the
shape from the other shapes in the diagram. Normally when you remove or
add a shape in a diagram, the other shapes change size and text on the
shapes changes size accordingly. But when you change the font size on one
shape, the text on the shape no longer changes along with its brethren.
Follow these steps to choose a different font or font size for the text on a dia-
gram shape:
1. Select the text.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Open the Font Size drop-down list and choose a font size.
4. Open the Font drop-down list and choose a font.
Editing 3D diagrams in 2D
Three-dimensional diagrams are won-
derful. You can impress your friends with
a 3D diagram. All you have to do to turn a
mundane two-dimensional diagram into a three-
dimensional showpiece is go to the (SmartArt
Tools) Design tab, open the SmartArt Styles
gallery, and select a 3D option.
Unfortunately, editing a 3D diagram can be dif-
ficult. The shapes and text are all aslant. It’s
hard to tell where to click or what to drag when
you’re editing a 3D diagram.
Fortunately, you can get around the problem of

Creating a Diagram from Scratch
If you have the skill and the wherewithal, you can create a diagram from
scratch by piecing together shapes, arrows, and connectors on the Insert
tab. The diagram in Figure 7-12, for example, was made not from SmartArt
graphics but from shapes, arrows, and connectors. Book I, Chapter 8
explains how to draw shapes and lines between shapes. You can enter text
on any shape merely by clicking inside it and wiggling your fingers over the
keyboard.
Making a diagram from scratch has some advantages. You can draw the con-
nectors any which way. Lines can cross the diagram chaotically. You can
include text boxes as well as shapes (the diagram in Figure 7-12 has four text
boxes). Don’t hesitate to fashion your own diagrams when a presentation or
document calls for it.

hether you know it or not, Office 2007 comes with drawing commands
for drawing lines, arrows, shapes, block arrows, stars, banners, and
callout shapes. And Office provides numerous ways to manipulate these
objects after you draw them. The drawing commands are meant to bring out
the artist in you. Use them to make diagrams, fashion your own ideagrams,
and illustrate difficult concepts and ideas. Lines and shapes give you a won-
derful opportunity to exercise your creativity. A picture is worth a thousand
words, so they say, and the drawing commands give you a chance to say it
without having to write a thousand words.
In this chapter, you discover all the many ways to manipulate lines, shapes,
text boxes, WordArt images, clip-art images, and graphics. You discover how
to lay out these objects on a page or slide, flip them, change their colors,
resize them, move them, and otherwise torture them until they look just right.
You discover how to draw lines and arrows, draw connections between
shapes, and draw ovals, squares, and other shapes, as well as WordArt
images. Use the techniques I describe in this chapter to bring something
more to your Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and Excel 
worksheets — originality. With the techniques I describe in this chapter,
you can bring the visual element into your work. You can communicate
with images as well as words.

The Basics: Drawing Lines, Arrows, and Shapes
152
The Basics: Drawing Lines, Arrows, and Shapes
Figure 8-1 demonstrates how you can use lines, arrows, and shapes (not to
mention text boxes) to illustrate ideas and concepts. Sometimes saying it
with lines and shapes is easier and more informative than saying it with
words. Even in Excel worksheets, you can find opportunities to use lines,
arrows, and shapes. For example, draw arrows and lines on worksheets to
illustrate which cells are used to compute formulas.
Follow these basic steps to draw a line, arrow, or shape:
1. Click the Insert tab.
In Word, you must be in Print Layout view to draw and see lines and
shapes. PowerPoint also offers the Shapes button on the Home tab.
2. Click the Shapes button to open the Insert Shapes gallery.
As shown in Figure 8-2, the Shapes gallery appears. The shapes are
divided into several categories, including Lines, Basic Shapes, and Block
Arrows, as well as a category at the top of the gallery where shapes you
chose recently are shown.
3. Select a line, arrow, or shape in the Insert Shapes gallery.

4. Drag on your page, slide, or worksheet.
As you drag, the line, arrow, or shape appears before your eyes.
5. To alter your line, arrow, or shape — to change its size, color, or 
outline — select the (Drawing Tools) Format tab.
This tab offers many commands for manipulating lines and shapes (they
are explained throughout this chapter). You must select a line or shape
to make the (Drawing Tools) Format tab appear. Click a line or shape to
select it.
In the upper-left corner of the (Drawing Tools) Format tab is another
Shapes gallery for creating new shapes to go along with the one you cre-
ated. You can click the Edit Shape button (in the Insert Shapes group) on
the Format tab to exchange one shape for another.
Handling Lines, Arrows, and Connectors
Figure 8-1 shows examples of how you can use lines and arrows to present
ideas. As well as lines and arrows, the Insert Shapes gallery offers connectors,
special lines that link shapes and can bend and stretch as you move shapes
around. Use connectors along with lines and arrows to describe the relation-
ships between the people or things in a diagram. These pages explain how to
handle lines, arrows, and connectors.

Changing the length and position of a line or arrow
To change the length or angle of a line or arrow, start by clicking to select it.
You can tell when a line has been selected because round selection handles
appear at either end. Follow these instructions to move a line or adjust its
length or angle:
✦Changing the angle of a line: Drag a selection handle up, down, or side-
ways. A faint line shows where your line will be when you release the
mouse button.
✦Changing the length: Drag a selection handle away from or toward the
opposite selection handle.
✦Changing the position: Move the pointer over the line itself and click
when you see the four-headed arrow. Then drag the line to a new location.
Changing the appearance of a 
line, arrow, or connector
What a line looks like is a matter of its color, its weight (how wide it is), its
dash status (it can be filled out or dashed), and its cap (its ends can be
rounded, square, or flat). To change the appearance of a line, start by select-
ing it, going to the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, and opening the drop-down
list on the Shape Outline button (you can find it in the Shape Styles group).
As shown in Figure 8-3, you see a drop-down list with commands for han-
dling the appearance of lines, arrows, and connectors:
✦Color: Choose a color on the drop-down list (see Figure 8-3).
✦Width: Choose Weight on the drop-down list (see Figure 8-3) and then
choose a line width on the submenu. You can also choose More Lines on
the submenu to open the Format Shape (or Format AutoShape) dialog
box and change the width there. Enter a setting in points to make the
line narrower or wider.

✦Dotted or dashed lines: Choose Dashes on the drop-down list (see
Figure 8-3) and then choose an option on the submenu. Again, you can
choose More Lines to open the Format Shape (or Format AutoShape)
dialog box and choose from many dash types and compound lines.
✦Line caps (PowerPoint and Excel only): Click the Shape Styles group
button to open the Format Shape (or Format AutoShape) dialog box.
In the Line Style category, select a cap type.
You can also change the appearance of a line by opening the Shape Styles
gallery on the (Drawing Tools) Format tab and selecting a style.
Attaching and handling arrowheads 
on lines and connectors
Arrows, of course, have arrowheads, and arrowheads on lines and connec-
tors can go on either side or both sides of a line. What’s more, arrowheads
come in different sizes and shapes. To handle arrowheads on lines and con-
nectors, select your line or connector and go to the (Drawing Tools) Format
tab. Then use one of these techniques to handle the arrowheads:
✦Open the drop-down list on the Shape Outline button, choose Arrows
(refer to Figure 8-3), and select an arrow on the submenu.
✦Click the Shape Styles group button to open the Format Shape (or Format
AutoShape) dialog box. In the Line Style category (or Colors and Lines
tab), choose Arrow settings to describe where you want the arrowheads to
be, what you want them to look like, and what size you want them to be.
Choosing a default line style 
for consistency’s sake
One of the secrets to making an attractive
drawing is to make the lines consistent with
one another. Lines should be the same width
and color. They should be the same style.
Unless you observe this rule, your drawings will
be infested with lines of varying width and dif-
ferent colors. They will look like a confetti
parade in a windstorm.
You can get around the problem of making lines
consistent with one another by creating a model
line and making it the default line style. After
you declare a default style, all new lines you
create are assigned the style. You don’t have to
spend as much time making the lines look alike.
Give a line the style, weight, and color that you
want for all (or most) lines and then follow
these steps to make that line the default style:
1. Select and right-click the line.
2. Choose Set AutoShape Defaults (in Word)
or Set As Default Line (in PowerPoint and
Excel) on the shortcut menu.

Handling Lines, Arrows, and Connectors
156
To attach an arrowhead or arrowheads to a line or connector you’ve already
drawn, select the line and proceed as though you were attaching arrowheads
to a line that already has an arrow.
Connecting shapes by using connectors
Under Lines, the Insert Shapes gallery offers six different connectors. Use
connectors to link shapes and text boxes to form a diagram. Connectors
differ from conventional lines in an important way: After you attach one to a
shape, it stays with the shape when you move the shape. You don’t have to
worry about remaking all the connections after you move a shape. You can
move shapes at will and let the connectors between shapes take care of
themselves. Figure 8-4 shows three types of connectors in action. By the way,
if you came here to explore how to make a diagram, be sure to check out
Book I, Chapter 7 as well. It explains the Office SmartArt diagramming gizmos.
To connect shapes in Word, the shapes must be on the drawing canvas.
Book II, Chapter 4 describes the Word drawing canvas. (Click the Shapes
button and choose New Drawing Canvas to create one.)
Making the connection
Before you draw the connections, draw the shapes and arrange them on the
slide where you want them to be in your diagram. Then follow these steps to
connect two shapes with a connector:
1. Select the two shapes that you want to connect.
To select the shapes, hold down the Ctrl key and click each one.

nectors

2. On the Format tab, click the Shapes button to open the Shapes gallery.
3. Under Lines, select the connector that will best fit between the two
shapes you want to link together.
4. Move the pointer over a side selection handle on one of the shapes
you want to connect.
The selection handles turn red (except in Word, which doesn’t register
any changes).
5. Click and drag the pointer over the other shape, and when you see
red selection handles on that shape, release the mouse button.
As shown earlier in Figure 8-4, red, round selection handles appear
on the shapes where they’re connected. These red handles tell you that
the two shapes are connected and will remain connected when you
move them.
If your connector is attached to the wrong shape, don’t despair. Select the
connector, and on the Format tab, click the Edit Shape button and choose
Reroute Connectors. Then move the pointer over the red handle on the side
of the connector that needs to be attached elsewhere, click, drag the con-
nector onto the other shape, and release the mouse button when you see the
red selection handles on the other shape.
Adjusting a connector
Chances are your connector needs adjusting to make it fit correctly between
the two shapes. Click to select your connector and follow these techniques
for adjusting it:
✦Changing the shape of a connector: Drag the yellow diamond on the
connector. As you drag, the connector assumes different shapes.
✦Changing the connector type: Right-click the connector, choose
Connector Types, and choose Straight Connector, Elbow Connector, or
Curved Connector on the submenu.
✦Handling arrows on connectors: If the arrows on the connector aren’t
there, are pointing in the wrong direction, or shouldn’t be there, change
around the arrowheads using the same techniques you use with standard
arrows. See “Attaching and handling arrowheads on lines and connec-
tors,” earlier in this chapter.
Make sure that the connector lines in your diagram are consistent with one
another. Give them the same style and appearance, or else it will be hard to
make sense of your diagram.

Handling Rectangles, Ovals, Stars, and Other Shapes
158
Handling Rectangles, Ovals, Stars, and Other Shapes
As I mention earlier in this chapter, shapes can come in very handy for illus-
trating concepts and ideas, as shown in Figure 8-5. You can combine shapes
to make your own illustrations. Apart from the standard rectangle and oval,
you can draw octagons and various other “-agons,” arrows, stars, and ban-
ners. You are hereby encouraged to make shapes a part of your work, and
you’ll be glad to know that drawing shapes is not difficult. These pages
explain how to draw a shape, exchange one shape for another, change a
shape’s symmetry, and enter words on a shape.
In Word, you must be in Print Layout view to draw and handle shapes. If you
intend to draw more than one shape in Word, create a drawing canvas to
hold the shapes (click the Shapes button and choose New Drawing Canvas).
Book II, Chapter 4 describes the drawing canvas in Word.
Drawing a shape
Follow these steps to draw a shape:
1. On the Insert tab, click the Shapes button to open the Shapes gallery.
You can also find a Shapes button on the (Drawing Tools) Format tab.
2. Select a shape in the gallery.
If you’ve drawn the shape recently, you may be able to find it at the top
of the gallery under Recently Used Shapes.
3. Click on-screen and drag slantwise to draw the shape, as shown at the
top of Figure 8-6.
Hold down the Shift key as you drag if you want the shape to retain its
symmetry. For example, to draw a circle, select the Oval shape and hold
down the Shift key as you draw.

Selection handles appear on the corners and sides of a shape when you
select it. With the selection handles showing, you can change a shape’s size
and shape:
✦Hold down the Shift key and drag a corner handle to change a shape’s
size and retain its symmetry.
✦Drag a side, top, or bottom handle to stretch or scrunch the shape.
To exchange one shape for another, select the shape and follow these
instructions:
✦In Word: On the Format tab, click the Change Shape button (you can
find it in the Shape Styles group), and select a new shape on the Change
Shape drop-down list.
✦In PowerPoint and Excel: On the Format tab, click the Edit Shape
button in the Insert Shapes group, choose Change Shape on the 
drop-down list, and select a new shape on the Change Shape drop-
down list.
Drag to draw a shape.
Drag a diamond to change a shape’s symmetry.

Changing a shape’s symmetry
A yellow diamond — sometimes two or three — appears on some shapes.
By dragging a diamond, you can change a shape’s symmetry. Figure 8-6, for
example, shows the same shape — the Sun shape — altered into different
symmetries. Notice where the diamonds are. By dragging a diamond even a
very short distance, you can do a lot to change a shape’s symmetry.
Using a shape as a text box
Here’s a neat trick: Rather than use the conventional rectangle as a text box,
you can use a shape. Figure 8-7 shows examples of shapes being used as text
boxes. By placing words on shapes, you can make the shapes serve to illus-
trate ideas and concepts.
Follow these instructions to handle text box shapes:
✦Entering the text: Click in the shape and start typing. In Word, right-click
and choose Add Text before you type.
Turning a text box into a text box shape
You can turn a conventional text box into a text
box shape by following these instructions:
 In Word: Select the text box, go to the (Text
Box Tools) Format tab, click the Change
Shape button (you can find it in the Text Box
Styles group), and select a shape in the
Change Shape drop-down list.
 In PowerPoint and Excel: Select the text
box by clicking its perimeter, select the
(Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Edit
Shape button, choose Change Shape, and
then select a shape in the Change Shape
drop-down list.
Unless your text box shape has a dark outline,
you won’t be able to see the shape it’s in. After
the conversion, you usually have to enlarge the
shape to accommodate the text.

✦Editing the text: Click in the text and start editing. That’s all there is to
it. If you have trouble getting PowerPoint or Excel to understand that
you want to edit text, select the shape, right-click it, and choose Edit
Text on the shortcut menu.
✦Changing the font, color, and size of text: Right-click in the text and
choose Font. Then, in the Font dialog box, choose a font, font color, and
a font size for the text.
✦Allowing the shape to enlarge for text: In PowerPoint and Excel, you can
allow the shape to enlarge and receive more text. Right-click the shape
and choose Format Shape. Then, in the Text Box category of the Format
Shape dialog box, select the Resize Shape to Fit Text option button.
WordArt for Bending, Spindling, and Mutilating Text
A WordArt image consists of a word that has been stretched, crumpled, or
squeezed into an odd shape. Actually, a WordArt image can include more
than one word. Figure 8-8 shows the WordArt gallery, where WordArt images
are made, and an example of a WordArt image. After you insert a WordArt
image, you can fool with the buttons on the WordArt toolbar and torture the
word or phrase even further.

Creating a WordArt image
Follow these steps to create a WordArt image:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the WordArt button.
A drop-down list with WordArt styles appears (refer to Figure 8-8).
3. Select a WordArt style.
Don’t worry about selecting the right style — you can choose a different
one later. In Word, you see the Edit WordArt Text dialog box.
4. Enter the text for the image in the dialog box (in Word) or in the
WordArt text box (in PowerPoint and Excel).
Congratulations. You just created a WordArt image.
Editing a WordArt image
Usually, you have to wrestle with a WordArt image before it comes out right.
Select the image, go to the Format tab, and use these techniques to win the
wrestling match:
✦Editing the words: In Word, click the Edit Text button and edit the
words in the Edit WordArt Text dialog box. In PowerPoint and Excel,
click in the WordArt text box and edit the text there.
✦Choosing a new WordArt style: Open the WordArt gallery and select a
style. Depending on the size of your screen and which program you’re
working in, you may have to click the WordArt button or Quick Styles
button first.
✦Changing the image’s shape: In Word, you can click the Change WordArt
Shape button and choose a shape on the drop-down list.
✦Changing the letters’ color: Click the Shape Fill button (in Word) or the
Text Fill button (in PowerPoint and Excel) and choose a color on the
drop-down list.
✦Changing the letters’ outline: Click the Shape Outline button (in Word)
or open the drop-down list on the Text Outline button (in PowerPoint
and Excel) and make choices to change the letters’ outline.
Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, 
Text Boxes, and Other Objects
After you insert a shape, line, text box, clip-art image, graphic, diagram,
WordArt image, chart, or embedded object in a file, it ceases being what it
was before and becomes an object. Figure 8-9 shows eight objects on a slide.

163
I’m not sure whether these eight objects resent being objectified, but Office
objectifies them. As far as manipulating these items in Office is concerned,
these are just objects.
The techniques for manipulating objects are the same whether you’re deal-
ing with a line, shape, graphic, clip-art image, diagram, or text box. The good
news from your end is that you have to master only one set of techniques for
handling these objects. Whether you want to move, change the size of, or
change the outline of a text box, clip-art image, graphic, or shape, the tech-
niques are the same.
In the remainder of this chapter are instructions for doing these tasks with
objects:
✦Selecting: Before you can do anything to objects, you have to select
them. See “Selecting objects so that you can manipulate them.”
✦Making use of the rulers and grid: Rulers (in Word, PowerPoint, and
Excel) and the grid (in Word and PowerPoint) can be very helpful for align-
ing and placing objects. See “Hiding and displaying the rulers and grid.”
✦Changing an object’s size and shape: You can enlarge, shrink, stretch,
and scrunch objects to make them wider or taller. See “Changing an
object’s size and shape.”
✦Moving and positioning: You can land objects with precision in a Word
document, PowerPoint slide, or Excel worksheet. See “Moving and posi-
tioning objects.”
✦Aligning and distributing: Another way to move and position objects is
to realign or redistribute them across a page, slide, or worksheet. See
“Tricks for aligning and distributing objects.”
✦Overlapping: When you’re dealing with several objects, they’re bound
to overlap. And sometimes overlapping objects make for an interesting
effect. On the right side of Figure 8-9, for example, several objects over-
lap and give the impression that they were “dropped there.” See “When
objects overlap: Choosing which appears above the other,” to handle
overlapping objects.
Figure 8-9:
Examples of
objects.

Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
164
✦Rotating and flipping: Viewers turn their heads when they see an object
that has been flipped or rotated. You can rotate and flip shapes, lines,
text boxes, graphics, clip-art images, and WordArt images. See “Rotating
and flipping objects.”
✦Grouping: To make working with several different objects easier, you
can group them so that they become a single object. After objects have
been grouped, manipulating them — manipulating it, I should say —
is easier. See “Grouping objects to make working with them easier.”
✦Applying outlines and fills: Putting outlines and color fills on objects
makes them stand out. You can also fill some kinds of objects with a
color or pattern. See “Changing an Object’s Color, Outline Color, and
Transparency.”
If you sighed after you finished reading this long list, I don’t blame you. But be
of good cheer: Most of these commands are easy to pick up, and including
lines, shapes, text boxes, WordArt images, clip art, and graphics in your
work is a good way to impress your friends and intimidate your enemies.
Selecting objects so that you can manipulate them
Before you can move or change the border of a graphic, text box, or other
object, you have to select it. To select an object, simply click it. Sometimes,
to align or decorate several objects simultaneously, you have to select more
than one object at the same time. To select more than one object:
✦Ctrl+click them. In other words, hold down the Ctrl key as you click the
objects.
✦“Lasso” the objects (in Word and PowerPoint). Click on one side of the
objects you want to select and drag the pointer across the other objects.
In Word, the objects must be on the drawing canvas for you to select
them this way.
After you select an object, its selection handles appear. Objects have eight
selection handles, one at each corner and one at each side. To tell whether
an object is selected, look for its selection handles.
Hiding and displaying the rulers and grid
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel offer two rulers, one along the top of the
window and one along the left side. Use the rulers to help place and align
objects. To display or hide these rulers, use one of these techniques:
✦On the View tab, click the Ruler check box (you may have to click the
Show/Hide button first, depending on the size of your screen). To see
the rulers, you must be in Print Layout view in Word and Page Layout
view in Excel.
✦In PowerPoint, you can also hide or display rulers by right-clicking a slide
(but not an object or frame) and choosing Ruler on the shortcut menu.

In Word and PowerPoint, the grid can come in very handy for aligning
objects. On the View tab, click the Gridlines check box to see the grid
(you may have to click the Show/Hide button first). The grid settings in
PowerPoint are quite sophisticated (see Book IV, Chapter 4 for details).
Changing an object’s size and shape
Usually when an object arrives on-screen, you have to wrestle with it. You
have to change its size (and sometimes its shape as well). Figure 8-10 demon-
strates how to resize an object. Select your object and use one of these
methods to change its size and shape:
✦“Eyeball it”: Hold down the Shift key and drag a corner selection handle
to make the object larger or smaller but maintain its proportions. Drag a
selection handle on the side to stretch or crimp an object and change its
shape as well as its size.
✦Enter height and width measurements: On the Format tab, enter meas-
urements in the Height and Width boxes (see Figure 8-10). Depending on
the size of your screen, you may have to click the Size button before you
can see these boxes.
✦Open the Size and Position (or Format) dialog box: Click the Size group
button on the Format tab to open the Size dialog box (in PowerPoint and
Excel) or the Format dialog box (in Word). Then change the Height and
Width settings in the dialog box (see Figure 8-10).
Enter measurements . . .
. . . or drag a selection handle.
Figure 8-10:
Ways to
resize an

Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
166
Whether you can change an object’s shape as well as its size depends on
whether the object’s aspect ratio is locked. If you’re wrestling with an object
and it won’t do your bidding — if it refuses to change shape or it changes
shape, and you don’t want it to do that — change its aspect ratio setting.
Click the Size group button to open the Size (or Format) dialog box. Then
select or deselect the Lock Aspect Ratio check box. When an object’s aspect
ratio is locked, it maintains its shape as you change its size, but when it’s
unlocked, you can change its shape.
You can change the size and shape of several objects at one time by select-
ing all the objects before giving a command to change sizes. Being able to
change an object’s size this way is convenient when you want to change the
size of objects with respect to one another.
Moving and positioning objects
Moving objects is considerably easier than moving furniture. Select the
object you want to reposition and use one of these techniques to land it in
the right place:
✦Dragging: Move the pointer over the object, click when you see the four-
headed arrow, and drag the object to a new location. Hold down the
Shift key as you drag to move an object either horizontally or vertically
in a straight line.
✦Using a dialog box (in PowerPoint and Word): On the Format tab,
click the Size group button (depending on the size of your screen, you
may have to click the Size button first). You see the Size dialog box
(in PowerPoint) or the Format dialog box (in Word). In the Position tab
(in PowerPoint) or the Size tab (in Word), enter Horizontal and Vertical
measurements and then choose options on the From drop-down list to
declare where you want to make the measurements from.
✦Nudging: If you can’t quite fit an object in the right place, try using a
Nudge command. Nudge commands move objects up, down, left, or right.
Press one of the arrow keys ( ↑, ↓, ←, →) to move the object a little bit.
Hold down the Ctrl key as you press to move an object ever so slightly.
Use the dialog box method of positioning objects when you want objects to
be in the exact same position on different pages or slides.
Tricks for aligning and distributing objects
When several objects appear in the same place, use the Align and Distribute
commands to give the objects an orderly appearance. You can make your
Word page, PowerPoint slide, or Excel worksheet look tidier by aligning the
objects or by distributing them so that they are an equal distance from one
another. Office offers special commands for doing these tasks — and the
Align and Distribute commands are easy to execute.

Aligning objects
The Align commands come in handy when you want objects to line up with
one another. Suppose you need to paste several photos in a row or column.
Lining up the photos neatly gives your page or slide an orderly appearance.
Figure 8-11 shows the two different ways to align objects. When you choose
an Align command in Word and PowerPoint, you have the option of aligning
objects with respect to one another, or to the page or page margin (in Word),
or the slide itself (in PowerPoint). In Figure 8-11, the stars — there are four in a
set — are left-aligned with respect, first, to a slide, and second, to one another.
Follow these steps to line up objects on a slide:
1. Move the objects where you roughly want them to be, and if you want
to align objects with respect to one another, move one object to a
point that the others will align to.
When Word, PowerPoint, or Excel aligns objects with respect to one
another, it aligns them to the object in the leftmost, centermost, right-
most, topmost, middlemost, or bottommost position, depending on
which Align command you choose.
2. Select the objects you want to align.
Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting objects so that you can manipulate
them” looks at selection techniques.
3. Click the Format tab.
You can also click the Page Layout tab (in Word and Excel) or the Home
tab (in PowerPoint).
4. Click the Align button, and on the drop-down list, choose whether to
align the objects with respect to one another or with respect to the
page or page margin (in Word) or a slide (in PowerPoint).
Figure 8-11:

Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the
Arrange button to get to the Align button. Figure 8-11 shows the Align
drop-down list.
5. Click the Align button again and choose an Align command — Left,
Center, Right, Top, Middle, or Bottom (refer to Figure 8-11).
6. If necessary, drag the objects on the page.
That’s right — drag them. After you give an Align command, the objects
are still selected, and you can drag to adjust their positions.
Distributing objects so that they are equidistant
The Distribute commands — Distribute Horizontally and Distribute
Vertically — come in handy for laying out objects on a page or slide. These
commands arrange objects so that the same amount of space appears
between each one. Rather than go to the trouble of pushing and pulling
objects until they are distributed evenly, you can simply select the objects
and choose a Distribute command.
Figure 8-12 demonstrates how the Distribute commands work. First, you
select the objects that need the same amount of space between them and
then you give a Distribute command. In the figure, I chose the Distribute
Horizontally command so that the same amount of horizontal (side-by-side)
space appears between the objects. Distributing objects such as these on
your own, perhaps by entering measurements in the Size or Format dialog
box, is a waste of time when you can use the Distribute commands.
Follow these steps to distribute objects horizontally or vertically on a page
or slide:

1. Arrange the objects so that the outermost objects — the ones that will
go on the top and bottom or left side and right side — are where you
want them to be.
In other words, if you want to distribute objects horizontally across a
page, place the leftmost object and rightmost object where you want
them to be. Office distributes the other objects equally between the 
leftmost and rightmost object.
2. Select the objects by Ctrl+clicking or “lassoing” them.
3. Click the Format tab.
You can also click the Page Layout tab (in Word and Excel) or the Home
tab (in PowerPoint).
4. Click the Align button and choose a Distribute option on the drop-
down list.
Figure 8-12 shows the Align drop-down list. To find the Align button, you
may have to click the Arrange button first, depending on the size of your
screen.
When objects overlap: Choosing which 
appears above the other
On a page or slide that is crowded with text boxes, shapes, graphics, and
clip-art images, objects inevitably overlap, and you have to decide which
object goes on top of the stack and which on the bottom. In a Word docu-
ment, you have to decide as well whether text appears above or below
objects. Objects that deliberately overlap can be interesting and attractive
to look at. On the right side of Figure 8-13, for example, a clip-art image and
text box appear in front of a shape. Makes for a nice effect, no?
Choose a Bring or Send command.
Figure 8-13:
An example

Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
170
The Bring and Send commands
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel offer four commands for handling objects in a
stack:
✦Bring to Front: Places the object in front of all other objects in the stack
✦Bring Forward: Moves the object higher in the stack
✦Send to Back: Places the object behind all other objects
✦Send Backward: Moves the object lower in the stack
Word offers these additional commands:
✦Bring in Front of Text: Moves the object in front of text on the page
✦Send Behind Text: Moves the object behind text on the page so that the
text appears over the object
In Word, you can’t choose a Bring or Send command unless you’ve chosen a
text-wrapping option apart from In Line with Text for the object. Select your
object, click the Format tab, click the Text Wrapping button, and choose an
option on the drop-down list apart from In Line with Text. Book II, Chapter 4
looks at text wrapping in Word.
Giving a Bring or Send command
Select an object and use one of these techniques to give a Bring or Send
command:
✦Format tab, or Page Layout tab (in Word and Excel), and Home tab
(in PowerPoint): Click the Bring to Front or Send to Back button, or
open the drop-down list on one of these buttons and choose a command
(refer to Figure 8-13). Depending on the size of your screen, you may
have to click the Arrange button before you can get to a Bring or Send
command.
✦Right-clicking: Right-click and choose a Bring to Front or Send to Back
command.
If an object on the bottom of the stack shows through after you place it
on the bottom, the object on the top of the stack is transparent or semi-
transparent. Transparent objects are like gauze curtains — they reveal
what’s behind them. If you want to make the object on the top of the
stack less transparent, see “Making a color transparent,” later in this 
chapter.

Rotating and flipping objects
Rotating and flipping objects — that is, changing their orientation — is a
neat way to spruce up a page or slide, as Figure 8-14 demonstrates. You can
rotate and flip these kinds of objects: lines, shapes, text boxes, clip-art
images, graphics, and WordArt images. To flip or rotate an object, select it
and do one of the following:
✦Choose a Rotate or Flip command: On the Format tab, click the Rotate
button and choose an option on the drop-down list (refer to Figure 8-14).
The Rotate commands rotate objects by 90 degrees; the Flip commands
flip objects over. The Rotate button is also found on the Page Layout tab
(in Word and Excel) and the Home tab (in PowerPoint). You may have to
click the Arrange button to see the Rotate button, depending on the size
of your screen.
✦Roll your own: Drag the object’s rotation handle, the green dot that
appears after you select it. Hold down the Shift key as you drag to rotate
the shape by 15-degree increments.
✦Open the Size dialog box: On the Rotate drop-down list, select More
Rotation Options to open the Size dialog box. Enter a degree measure-
ment in the Rotation text box.
To rotate several objects simultaneously, Ctrl+click to select each object and
then give a rotation command.
Drag the rotation handle . . .
. . . or choose a Rotate command.

172
Grouping objects to make working with them easier
Consider the clip-art image, shape, and text box in Figure 8-15. To move,
resize, or reshape these objects, I would have to laboriously move them
one at a time — that is, I would have to do that if it weren’t for the Group
command.
The Group command assembles different objects into a single object to
make moving, resizing, and reshaping objects easier. With the Group com-
mand, you select the objects that you want to “group” and then you wrap
them into a single bundle so that they become easier to work with. Office
remembers which objects were grouped so that you can ungroup objects
after you’ve moved or resized them.
To group objects in Word, the objects must be on the same drawing canvas.
Book II, Chapter 4 explains the drawing canvas.
Grouping objects
Select objects by Ctrl+clicking or “lassoing” them and then do either of the
following to group the objects:
✦On the Format tab (or the Page Layout tab in Word and Excel, and the
Home tab in PowerPoint), click the Group button and choose Group on
the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 8-15. Depending on the size of
your screen, you may have to click the Arrange button to get to the
Group button.
✦Right-click one of the objects you selected, choose Group (or Grouping)
and then choose Group.

Chapter 8

173
After objects are grouped, they form a single object with the eight selection
handles.
To add an object to a group, select the object and the grouped objects by
Ctrl+clicking and then choosing the Group command.
Ungrouping and regrouping
To ungroup an object and break it into its components, perhaps to fiddle
with one of the objects in the group, select the object, click the Group
button, and choose Ungroup (refer to Figure 8-15).
Office remembers which objects were in a group after you ungroup it. To
reassemble the objects in a group, click an object that was formerly in the
group and then choose the Regroup command. You can find this command
on the Group button (refer to Figure 8-15).
Changing an Object’s Color, Outline Color, 
and Transparency
If an object’s color or outline color doesn’t suit you, you have the right to
change colors. For that matter, you can opt for a “blank” object with no color
or remove the color from around the perimeter of the object. As the saying
goes, “It’s a free country.”
Office has its own lingo when it comes to an object’s color. Remember these
terms when you make like Picasso with your shapes, text boxes, graphics,
and clip-art images:
✦Shape fill colors: The color that fills in an object is called the shape fill.
You can apply shape fills to shapes, text boxes, and WordArt images,
but not clip-art or graphics. Besides colors, you can fill a shape with a
picture, a gradient, or a texture. (See the next section in this chapter,
“Filling an object with a color, picture, or texture.”)
✦Shape outline colors: The line that goes around the perimeter of the object
is called the shape outline. You can choose a color, style, and line width for
outlines. (See “Putting the outline around an object,” later in this chapter.)
The easiest way to decorate a shape, text box, or WordArt image is to visit
the Format tab and make a selection in the Shape Styles gallery. These ready-
made gallery selections can spare you the work of dealing with fill colors,
outlines, and shape effects. Just remember not to mix and match different
Shape Style options; use them with consistency.

Changing an Object’s Color, Outline Color, and Transparency
174
Filling an object with a color, picture, or texture
Shapes, text boxes, and WordArt images are empty when you first create
them, but you can fill them with a color, picture, gradient, or texture by fol-
lowing these basic steps:
1. Select the object that needs a facelift.
2. Click the Format tab.
3. Click the Shape Fill button.
As shown in Figure 8-16, a drop-down list appears.
4. Choose a fill color, picture, gradient, or texture.
Choose No Fill to remove the fill color, picture, gradient, or texture from
an object.
Figure 8-16 shows the same object filled with a color, picture, gradient, and
texture. Which do you prefer? Your choices are as follows:
✦Color: Applies a single color to the object. Theme colors are colors that
the makers of Office believe are compatible with the theme you choose
for your presentation. If these colors don’t suit you, choose a standard
color or choose More Fill Colors to open the Colors dialog box, where
you can choose from many different colors.
✦Picture: Places a picture in the object. You see the Insert (or Select)
Picture dialog box. Choose a picture and click the Insert button.
✦Gradient: Applies two- or three-color shading to the object. You can
choose between various shading styles.

✦Texture: Offers 24 patterns meant to simulate various surfaces. The
choices include Granite, Paper Bag, and Pink Tissue Paper. Be sure to
use the scroll bar to see all the choices.
✦Pattern (Word only): Applies a pattern to the object. Select a pattern on
the Pattern tab of the Fill Effects dialog box.
Making a color transparent
A transparent color is like gauze because instead of being solid, it shows
what’s behind it. Transparent colors are especially useful in text boxes
because the text shows through and can be read easily. Follow these steps
to make the fill color in a text box, shape, or WordArt image transparent or
semi-transparent:
1. Right-click the object and choose Format Shape (or Format AutoShape).
You see the Format dialog box.
2. In the Fill category, drag the Transparency slider to choose how trans-
parent a color you want.
At 100%, the color is completely transparent and, in fact, not there; at
1%, the color is hardly transparent at all.
3. Click the Close or OK button.
You can also make a graphic transparent by recoloring it. See Book VIII,
Chapter 3.
Putting the outline around an object
The outline is the line that runs around the perimeter of an object. Put an
outline color around an object to give it more definition or make it stand out.
Figure 8-17 shows examples of outlines. What a shape outline looks like has
to do with the color, weight, and dash style you choose for it.
Figure 8-17:
An object’s

its color,

Changing an Object’s Color, Outline Color, and Transparency
176
Select your object and follow these steps to change its outline:
1. Click the Format tab.
2. Click the Shape Outline button.
A drop-down list appears (see Figure 8-17).
3. Choose a color, weight, or dash.
You may have to return to the Shape Outline drop-down list more than
once to make the outline just so.
• Color: Choose a theme color deemed right for borders by the makers
of your program or choose a standard color.
• Weight: Choose how thick or thin you want the border to be. You can
choose More Lines on the submenu to open the Format dialog box.
In the Line Style (or Line) category, you can choose compound lines
and select point-size width for the outline.
• Dashes: Choose straight lines, dashed lines, or broken lines.
• Pattern (Word only): Select a line pattern in the Patterned Lines
dialog box.
The (Picture Tools) Format tab — the one you see when you’re dealing
with pictures and clip art — offers the Picture Border drop-down list
instead of the Shape Outline drop-down list, but the options on the lists
are the same.
To remove an outline from an object, choose No Outline on the Shape
Outline (or Picture Border) drop-down list.
Designating a fill and outline color 
for all your objects
Rather than go to the significant trouble of giving
all or most of your objects the same look, you can
make one object the model for all others to follow,
and declare it the default style. After that, all new
objects you insert appear in the same style, your
objects have a uniform appearance, and you don’t
have to spend as much time formatting objects.
Select an object with a fill and an outline color
that you want as your model, right-click the
object, and choose Set As Default (or Set
AutoShape Defaults) to make your object the
default that all other objects start from.

T
his chapter explains shortcuts and commands that can help you
become a speedy user of Word. Everything in this chapter was put here
so that you can get off work earlier and take the slow, scenic route home.
Starting here, you discover how to create and change your view of docu-
ments. You find out how to select text, get from place to place — and mark
your place — in long documents. You also explore how to insert one docu-
ment into another and create data-entry forms to make entering information
a little easier.
Introducing the Word Screen
Seeing the Word screen for the first time is sort of like trying to find your
way through Tokyo’s busy Ikebukuro subway station. It’s intimidating.
But when you start using Word, you quickly discover what everything is.
To help you get going, Figure 1-1 shows you the different parts of the screen.
Here are shorthand descriptions of these screen parts:
✦Title bar: At the top of the screen, the title bar tells you the name of the
document you’re working on.
✦Quick Access toolbar: This toolbar offers the Save, Undo, and Repeat
buttons. Wherever you go in Word, you see the Quick Access toolbar.
Book I, Chapter 1 explains the toolbar in detail; Book VIII, Chapter 1
explains how to customize and move the Quick Access toolbar.

Introducing the Word Screen
180
✦Minimize, Restore, Close buttons: These three magic buttons make it
very easy to shrink, enlarge, and close the window you’re working in.
✦The Ribbon: Select a tab on the Ribbon to undertake a new task. Book I,
Chapter 1 explains the Ribbon in detail, as well as the new Office 2007
interface.
✦Scroll bars: The scroll bars help you get from place to place in a document.
✦Status bar: The status bar gives you basic information about where you
are and what you’re doing in a document. It tells you what page and
what section you’re in, the total number of pages and words in your 
document, and what language the text is written in. Book VIII, Chapter 1
explains how to customize the status bar.
✦View buttons: Click one of these buttons — Print Layout, Full Screen
Reading, Web Layout, Outline, or Draft — to change your view of a 
document.
✦Zoom controls: Use these controls to zoom in and out on your work. See
Book I, Chapter 3 for details.

Creating a New Document
181
Creating a New Document
Document is just a fancy word for a letter, report, announcement, or procla-
mation that you create with Word. When you first start Word, you see a
new, blank document with the generic name Document1. You can start 
working right away on this document, or you can create a new document
from a template. A template is a special kind of file that is used as the 
starting point for creating other files. Each template comes with many 
preformatted styles. If your aim is to create an academic report, flyer,
newsletter, calendar, résumé, or other sophisticated document, see if you
can spare yourself the formatting work by creating your document from a
template.
No matter what kind of document you want, you can start creating it by
clicking the Office button and choosing New on the drop-down list. You see
the New Document dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-2. Create your document
with one of these techniques:
✦Blank document: Double-click the Blank Document icon. (By pressing
Ctrl+N, you can create a new, blank document without opening the New
Document dialog box.)
Find a template.
Figure 1-2:

Creating a New Document
182
✦Document from a template: Take your pick of these techniques to
create a document from a template:
• Use a template on your computer: Click Installed Templates (you can
find this button under Templates). Templates that you loaded on
your computer when you installed Office appear in the dialog box.
Double-click a template to create a document.
• Search for a template online at Microsoft: Enter a search term in the
Search box, make sure your computer is connected to the Internet,
and click the Start Searching button. Templates appear in the dialog
box. Double-click a template to download it and use it to create a
document.
• Use a template you created (or downloaded earlier from Microsoft or
acquired from a third party): Click the My Templates button. The New
dialog box appears. Select a template and click OK.
• Choose a recently used template: Click an icon under Recently Used
Templates.
✦Recycle another document: If you can use another document as the
starting point for creating a new document, click the New from Existing
button. In the New from Existing Document dialog box, select the docu-
ment and click the Create New button.
Book I, Chapter 1 explains how to save documents after you create them, as
well as how to open the document you want to work on.
Constructing your default document
When you open a new, blank document by
pressing Ctrl+N or double-clicking the Blank
Document icon in the New Document dialog
box (refer to Figure 1-2), does the document
meet your specifications? When you start
typing, does the text appear in your favorite
font? Are the margins just-so?
You can get a head start in creating documents
by telling Word what you want new documents
to look like. To do that, open the Font dialog box
(click the Font group button on the Home tab)
and then the Page Setup dialog box (click the
Page Setup group button on the Page Layout
tab), make your formatting choices, and click
the Default button in these dialog boxes.
Changes you make this way are saved to the
Normal document template (Chapter 3 of this
mini-book explains what templates are).

Getting a Better Look at Your Documents
183
Getting a Better Look at Your Documents
A computer screen can be kind of confining. There you are, staring at the darn
thing for hours at a stretch. Do you wish the view were better? The Word
screen can’t be made to look like the Riviera, but you can examine documents
in different ways and work in two places at one time in the same document.
Better read on.
Viewing documents in different ways
In word processing, you want to focus sometimes on the writing, sometimes
on the layout, and sometimes on the organization of your work. To help you
stay in focus, Word offers different ways of viewing a document. Figure 1-3
shows these views. To change views, click one of the five View buttons on
the status bar or go to the View tab and click one of the five buttons in the
Document Views group. These pages explain the five views and why to select
one over the other. (Be sure to visit Book I, Chapter 3 as well; it describes
how to view a document through more than one window and how to open a
second window on a document.)
Print Layout view
Switch to Print Layout view to see the big picture. In this view, you can see
what your document will look like when you print it. You can see graphics,
headers, footers, and even page borders in Print Layout view. You can also
see clearly where page breaks occur — that is, where one page ends and the
next begins. In Print Layout view, you can click the One Page, Two Pages, or
Page Width button to display more or fewer pages on your screen.
Full Screen Reading view
Switch to Full Screen Reading view to focus on the text itself and proofread
your documents. In this view, everything gets stripped away — the Ribbon,
scroll bars, status bar, and all. All you see is the text and artwork in your
documents. You can’t enter or edit text (unless you open the View Options
drop-down list and choose Allow Typing).
Click the View Options button to open a drop-down list with options for
improving your view. For example, you can increase or decrease the size of
text, show one or two document pages at a time, and display page margins.
To get from page to page, click buttons along the top of the window. Click
the Close button to leave this view.

185
Web Layout view
Switch to Web Layout view to see what your document would look like as a
Web page. Background colors appear (if you chose a theme or background
color for your document). Text is wrapped to the window rather than around
the artwork in the document. Book VIII, Chapter 2 explains how to save an
Office file, a Word document included, as a Web page.
Outline view
Switch to Outline view to see how your work is organized. In this view, you
can see only the headings in a document. You can get a sense of how your
document unfolds and easily move sections of text backward and forward in
a document. In other words, you can reorganize a document in Outline view.
To switch to this view, click the Outline button on the status bar or the Outline
button on the View tab. Chapter 6 of this mini-book explains outlines in tor-
turous detail.
Draft view
Switch to Draft view when you’re writing a document and you want to focus
on the words. Clip-art images, shapes, and other objects don’t appear in
this view, nor do page breaks (although you can clearly see section breaks).
Draft view is best for writing first drafts.
Splitting the screen
Besides opening a second window on a document (a subject of Book I,
Chapter 3), you can be two places at once in a Word document by splitting
the screen. One reason you might do this: You’re writing a long report and
want the introduction to support the conclusion, and you also want the con-
clusion to fulfill all promises made by the introduction. That’s difficult to do
sometimes, but you can make it easier by splitting the screen so you can be
two places at once as you write your introduction and conclusion.
Splitting a window divides it into north and south halves, as shown in
Figure 1-4. In a split screen, two sets of scroll bars appear so that you can
travel in one half of the screen without disturbing the other half. Word offers
two ways to split the screen:
✦Move the mouse pointer to the split box at the top of the scroll bar on
the right. Move it just above the View Ruler button. When the pointer
turns into double-arrows, click and drag the gray line down the screen.
When you release the mouse button, you have a split screen.
✦On the View tab, click the Split button. A gray line appears on-screen.
Roll the mouse down until the gray line is where you want the split to
be, and click. You get two screens split down the middle.

Selecting Text in Speedy Ways
186
When you tire of this schizophrenic arrangement, click the Remove Split
button on the View tab or drag the line to the top or bottom of the screen.
You can also double-click the line that splits the screen in two.
In a split screen, you can choose a view for the different halves. For example,
choose Outline view for one half and Draft view for the other to see the
headings in a document while you write the introduction.
Selecting Text in Speedy Ways
Book I, Chapter 2 explains how to enter text and change its appearance and
size. After you enter text, the need may arise for you to copy, move, or delete
it, but you can’t do those tasks until you select it first. Table 1-1 describes
shortcuts for selecting text.
Figure 1-4:
A split

Viewing the hidden format symbols
Sometimes it pays to see the hidden format
symbols when you’re editing and laying out a
document. The symbols show line breaks, tab
spaces, paragraph breaks, and the space or
spaces between words. To see the hidden
format symbols, click the Show/Hide¶ button.
Click the button again to hide the symbols.
Here’s what the hidden symbols look like

(if necessary), and choose Select➪Select All.
If you have a bunch of highlighted text on-screen and you want it to go away
but it won’t (because you pressed F8), press the Esc key.
After you press F8, all the keyboard shortcuts for moving the cursor also
work for selecting text. For example, press F8 and then press Ctrl+Home to
select everything from the cursor to the top of the document. Later in this
chapter, “Keys for getting around quickly” describes keyboard shortcuts for
getting from place to place.
Moving Around Quickly in Documents
Besides sliding the scroll bar, Word offers a handful of very speedy tech-
niques for jumping around in documents: pressing shortcut keys, browsing
in the Select Browse Object menu, using the Go To command, and navigating
with the Document Map or thumbnails. Read on to discover how to get there
faster, faster, faster.
Keys for getting around quickly
One of the fastest ways to go from place to place is to press the keys and key
combinations listed in Table 1-2.

Table 1-2
Keys for Moving Around Documents
Key to Press
Where It Takes You
Page Up

Down the length of one screen
Ctrl+Page Up
To the previous page in the document
Ctrl+Page Down
To the next page in the document
Ctrl+Home
To the top of the document
Ctrl+End
To the bottom of the document
If pressing Ctrl+Page Up or Ctrl+Page Down doesn’t get you to the top or
bottom of a page, it’s because you clicked the Select Browse Object button
at the bottom of the vertical scroll bar, which makes Word go to the next
bookmark, comment, heading, or whatever. Click the Select Browse Object
button and choose Browse by Page to make these key combinations work
again.
Here’s a useful keystroke for getting from place to place: Shift+F5. Press it
once to go to the location of your most recent edit. Press it two or three
times to go back one or two edits before that. Pressing Shift+F5 is useful
when you want to return to the place where you made an edit but can’t quite
remember where that place is.
Clicking thumbnail pages
In lengthy documents, such as the one shown in Figure 1-5, the best way to
get from page to page is to display the Thumbnails pane and click a thumb-
nail image of a page. When you display thumbnail pages, a thumbnail image
of each page in the document appears on the left side of the screen. Each
thumbnail is numbered so that you always know which page you’re viewing.
To quickly move from page to page, use the scroll bar on the left side of
the screen and click a page thumbnail. To display the thumbnails, go to the
View tab and click the Thumbnails check box (you may have to click the
Show/Hide button first).
“Browsing” around a document
A really fast way to move around quickly is to click the Select Browse Object
button in the lower-right corner of the screen. When you click this button,
Word presents 12 Browse By icons: Go To, Find, Edits, Heading, Graphic, Table,
Field, Endnote, Footnote, Comment, Section, and Page. Select the icon that
represents the element you want to go to, and Word takes you there immedi-
ately. For example, click the Browse by Heading icon to get to the next heading
in your document (provided that you assigned heading styles to headings).

After you select a Browse By icon, the navigator buttons — the double-arrows
directly above and below the Select Browse Object button — turn blue.
Click a blue navigator button to get to the next example or the previous
example of the element you chose. For example, if you selected the Browse
by Heading icon, all you have to do is click the blue navigator buttons to get
from heading to heading, backward or forward in your document.
Going there fast with the Go To command
Another fast way to go from place to place in a document is to use the Go To
command. On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Find button and
choose Go To (you may have to click the Editing button first). You see the
Go To tab of the Find and Replace dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-6. You can
also open this dialog box by pressing Ctrl+G or F5.
The Go to What menu in this dialog box lists everything that can conceiv-
ably be numbered in a Word document, and other things, too. Everything
that you can get to with the Select Browse Object button, as well as lines,
equations, and objects, can be reached by way of the Go To tab. Click a
menu item, enter a number, choose an item from the drop-down list, or click
the Previous, Next, or Go To buttons to go elsewhere.

Hopping from place to place in the document map
Yet another way to hop from place to place is by turning on the document
map. To do so, go to the View tab and click the Document Map check box
(you may have to click the Show/Hide button first). As shown in Figure 1-7,
the headings in your document appear along the left side of the screen (pro-
vided you assigned heading styles to headings).
Select an item in the Document Map, and Word takes you there in the twin-
kling of an eye. The document map is like a table of contents whose headings
you can click to get from place to place. Right-click the document map and
choose a heading-level option on the shortcut menu to tell Word which
headings to display in the map. You can also right-click a heading and choose
Expand or Collapse on the shortcut menu to see or hide lower-level headings.
Bookmarks for hopping around
Rather than press Page Up or Page Down or click the scroll bar to thrash
around in a long document, you can use bookmarks. All you do is put a book-
mark in an important spot in your document that you’ll return to many
times. When you want to return to that spot, go to the Insert tab, click the
Bookmark button (you may have to click the Links button first), double-click
the bookmark in the Bookmark dialog box, and click the Close button. True
to the craft, the mystery writer whose bookmarks are shown in Figure 1-8
wrote the end of the story first and used bookmarks to jump back and forth
between the beginning and end to make all the clues fit together.
Follow these instructions to handle bookmarks:
Select a heading to scroll to it.

✦Adding a bookmark: To place a bookmark in a document, click where
you want the bookmark to go and click the Bookmark button on the
Insert tab (you may have to click the Links button first, depending on
the size of your screen). Then, in the Bookmark dialog box, type a
descriptive name in the Bookmark Name box, and click the Add button.
Bookmarks can’t start with numbers or include blank spaces. You can
also open the Bookmark dialog box by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F5.
✦Deleting a bookmark: To delete a bookmark, select it in the Bookmark
dialog box and click the Delete button.
Word uses bookmarks for many purposes. For example, bookmarks indicate
where cross-references are located in a document.
Inserting a Whole File into a Document
One of the beautiful things about word processing is that you can recycle doc-
uments. Say that you wrote an essay on the Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher that
would fit very nicely in a broader report on North American birds. You can
insert the Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher document into your report document:
1. Place the cursor where you want to insert the document.
2. On the Insert tab, open the drop-down list on the Object button and
choose Text from File.
You see the Insert File dialog box.
3. Find and select the file you want to insert.
4. Click the Insert button.

Entering Information Quickly in a Computerized Form
192
Entering Information Quickly in a Computerized Form
A form is a means of soliciting and recording information. You can use forms,
like the one shown in Figure 1-9, to enter data faster and to reduce data-entry
errors. Instead of entering all the information by hand, you or a data-entry
clerk can choose entries from combo boxes, drop-down lists, and date pick-
ers. You save time because you don’t have to enter all the information by
hand, and the information you enter is more likely to be accurate because
you choose it from prescribed lists instead of entering it yourself.
To create a form like the one shown in Figure 1-9, start by creating a tem-
plate for your form and putting data-entry controls — the combo boxes, 
drop-down lists, and date pickers — in the form. To fill out a form, you
create a document from the form template and go to it. These pages
explain how to create a form and use forms to record information.
Creating a computerized form
The first step in creating a data-entry form is to create a template for holding
the form. After that, you design the form itself by labeling the data fields and
creating the data-entry controls. Better keep reading.
Creating a template to hold the form
Follow these steps to create a new template:
1. Click the Office button and choose New on the drop-down list.
You see the New Document dialog box.

computer.
3. Click the Template option button.
You can find this button under Create New in the lower-right corner of
the dialog box.
4. Click OK.
5. Click the Save button to open the Save As dialog box.
6. Enter a descriptive name for your template and click the Save button.
Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains templates in detail.
Creating the form and data-entry controls
Your next task is to create the form and data-entry controls for your tem-
plate. Enter labels on the form where you will enter information. The form in
Figure 1-9, for example, has five labels: Name, Phone, Fee Paid?, Association,
and Date. After you’ve entered the labels, follow these steps to create the
data-entry controls:
1. Display the Developer tab, if necessary.
If this tab isn’t showing, click the Office button, choose Word Options,
and on the Popular tab of the Word Options dialog box, click the Show
Developer Tab in the Ribbon check box and click OK.
2. Click where you want to place a control and then create the control.
Here are instructions for creating three types of controls:
✦Drop-down list: A drop-down list is a menu that “drops” when you open it
to reveal different option choices (refer to Figure 1-9). Click the Dropdown
List button and then the Properties button. You see the Content Control
Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-10. For each option you want
to place on the drop-down list, click the Add button, and in the Add
Choice dialog box, enter the option’s name in the Display Name text box
and click OK, as shown in Figure 1-10.
✦Combo box: Like a drop-down list, a combo box “drops” to reveal choices.
However, as well as choosing an option on the drop-down list, data-entry
clerks can enter information in the box (refer to Figure 1-9). Click the
Combo Box button and then the Properties button. In the Content Control
Properties dialog box, enter option names the same way you enter them
in a drop-down list, as shown in Figure 1-10.
✦Date picker: A date picker is a mini-calendar from which data-entry clerks
can enter a date (refer to Figure 1-9). Click the Date Picker button and
then the Properties button. In the Content Control Properties dialog box,
choose a display format for dates and click OK.

3. Click the Save button to save your template.
Now you’re ready to use your newly made form to enter data.
Entering data in the form
Now that you have the template, you or someone else can enter data cleanly
in easy-to-read forms:
1. Click the Office button and choose New on the drop-down list.
You see the New Document dialog box.
2. Click the My Templates button.
The New dialog box opens and shows you Word templates on your 
computer.
3. Double-click the name of the template you created for entering data in
your form.
The form appears.
4. Enter information in the input fields.
Press the up or down arrow, or press Tab and Shift+Tab to move from
field to field. You can also click input fields to move the cursor there.
5. When you’re done, print the document or save it.

T
his chapter explains how to format text and pages. A well-laid-out 
document says a lot about how much time and thought went into it.
This chapter presents tips, tricks, and techniques for making pages look
just right.
In this chapter, you learn what section breaks are and why they are so impor-
tant to formatting. You discover how to establish the size of margins, indent
text, number pages, construct headers and footers, determine how much
space appears between lines of text, handle lists, and hyphenate text.
Paragraphs and Formatting
Back in English class, your teacher taught you that a paragraph is a part 
of a longer composition that presents one idea, or in the case of dialogue,
presents the words of one speaker. Your teacher was right, too, but for
word-processing purposes, a paragraph is a lot less than that. In word pro-
cessing, a paragraph is simply what you put on-screen before you press the
Enter key.
For instance, a heading is a paragraph. If you press Enter on a blank line to
go to the next line, the blank line is considered a paragraph. If you type Dear
John at the top of a letter and press Enter, “Dear John” is a paragraph.

Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes
196
It’s important to know this because paragraphs have a lot to do with format-
ting. If you click the Paragraph group button on the Home tab and monkey
around with the paragraph formatting in the Paragraph dialog box, your
changes affect everything in the paragraph where the cursor is located.
To make format changes to a whole paragraph, all you have to do is place
the cursor there. You don’t have to select the paragraph. And if you want to
make format changes to several paragraphs in a row, all you have to do is
select those paragraphs.
Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes
When you want to have different page numbering schemes, headers and
footers, margin sizes, and page orientations in a document, you have to
create a section break to start a new section. Word creates a new section
for you when you create newspaper-style columns or change the size of 
margins.
Follow these steps to create a new section:
1. Click where you want to insert a section break.
2. On the Page Layout tab, click the Breaks button.
You open a drop-down list.
3. Under Section Breaks on the drop-down list, choose a section break.
All four section break options create a new section, but they do so in differ-
ent ways:
✦Next Page: Inserts a page break as well as a section break so that the
new section can start at the top of a new page (the next one). Select this
option to start a new chapter, for example.
✦Continuous: Inserts a section break in the middle of a page. Select this
option if, for example, you want to introduce newspaper-style columns
in the middle of a page.
✦Even Page: Starts the new section on the next even page. This option is
good for two-sided documents in which the headers on the left- and
right-side pages are different.
✦Odd Page: Starts the new section on the next odd page. You might
choose this option if you have a book in which chapters start on odd
pages. (By convention, that’s where they start.)
To delete a section break, make sure that you’re in Draft view, click the
dotted line, and press the Delete key.

Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes
197
Editing a document with many sections can be confusing, and if you acciden-
tally delete a section break, you can turn a perfectly good document into
guacamole. In the same way that paragraph marks store formats for a para-
graph, section breaks store formats for an entire section. If you accidentally
delete a section break, you apply new formats because the section is folded
into the section that formerly followed it and adopts that next section’s for-
mats. Because it’s easy to accidentally delete a section break and create
havoc, I recommend working in Draft view when your document has many
section breaks. In Draft view, you can tell where a section ends because
Section Break and a double dotted line appear on-screen. The only way
to tell where a section ends in Print Layout view is to glance at the Sec listing
on the status bar or click the Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab. (If the Sec
listing doesn’t appear on the status bar, right-click the status bar and choose
Section on the pop-up list.)
Seeing what the formats are
Sometimes seeing how text was formatted
merely by looking is difficult. However, by
pressing Shift+F1, you can see precisely how
text and paragraphs were formatted in the
Reveal Formatting task pane. It describes how
the text, paragraph, and section where the
pointer is located are formatted.
While the Reveal Formatting task pane is open,
you can take advantage of these amenities:
 Compare one part of a document to another:
Click the Compare to Another Section
check box and then click another part of
your document. The Reveal Formatting task
pane describes how the two parts differ.
Knowing how parts of a document differ
can be invaluable when you’re creating
and modifying styles.
 Find out which style was assigned: Click
the Distinguish Style Source check box.
The task pane lists the style you assigned
to the part of your document where the
cursor is located.
 See the formatting marks: Click the Show
All Formatting Marks check box. Clicking
this box has the same results as clicking
the Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab —
you can tell where paragraphs end, where
line breaks are, and where tab spaces
were entered.

Breaking a Line
198
Breaking a Line
To break a line of text before it reaches the right margin without starting a
new paragraph, press Shift+Enter. Figure 2-1 shows how you can press
Shift+Enter to make lines break better. The paragraphs are identical, but I
broke lines in the right-side paragraph to make the text easier to read.
Line breaks are marked with the ↵symbol. To erase line breaks, click the
Show/Hide¶ button to see these symbols and then backspace over them.
Starting a New Page
Word gives you another page so that you can keep going when you fill up
one page. But what if you’re impatient and want to start a new page right
away? Whatever you do, don’t press Enter again and again until you fill up
the page. Instead, create a hard page break by doing either of the following:
✦Press Ctrl+Enter.
✦Click the Breaks button on the Page Layout tab and choose Page on the
drop-down list.
In Draft view, you can click the Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab and tell
where you inserted a hard page break because you see the words Page
Break and a dotted line on-screen. You can’t tell where hard page breaks
are in Print Layout view.
To delete a hard page break, switch to Draft view, click the Show/Hide¶ button
on the Home tab, click the words Page Break, and press the Delete key.
Setting Up and Changing the Margins
Margins are the empty spaces along the left, right, top, and bottom edges of
a page, as shown in Figure 2-2. Headers and footers fall, respectively, in the
top and bottom margins. And you can put graphics, text boxes, and page
numbers in the margins as well. Margins serve to frame the text and make it
easier to read.

Setting Up and Changing the Margins
199
When you start a new document, give a moment’s thought to the margins.
Changing the size of margins after you enter the text, clip art, graphics, and
whatnot can be disastrous. Text is indented from the left and right margins.
Pages break on the bottom margin. If you change margin settings, indents
and page breaks change for good or ill throughout your document. By set-
ting the margins carefully from the beginning, you can rest assured that text
lands on the page where you want it to land.
Don’t confuse margins with indents. Text is indented from the margin, not
from the edge of the page. If you want to change how far text falls from the
page edge, indent it. To change margin settings in the middle of a document,
you have to create a new section.
To set up or change the margins, go to the Page Layout tab and click the
Margins button. You see a drop-down list with margin settings. Either choose
a setting or select Custom Margins to open the Margins tab of the Page Setup
dialog box and choose among these commands for handling margins:
✦Changing the size of the margins: Enter measurements in the Top,
Bottom, Left, and Right boxes to tell Word how much blank space to put
along the sides of the page.
✦Making room for the gutter: The gutter is the part of the paper that the
binding eats into when you bind a document. Enter a measurement in
the Gutter box to increase the left or inside margin and make room for
the binding. Notice on the pages of this book, for example, that the
margin closest to the binding is wider than the outside margin. Choose
Top on the Gutter Position menu if you intend to bind your document
from the top, not the left, or inside, of the page. Some legal documents
are bound this way.
Outside margin
Inside margin

Indenting Paragraphs and First Lines

✦Handling two-sided documents (inside and outside margins): In a bound
document in which text is printed on both sides of the pages, the terms
left margin and right margin are meaningless. What matters instead is in
the inside margin, the margin in the middle of the page spread next to
the bindings, and the outside margin, the margin on the outside of the
page spread that isn’t affected by the bindings (refer to Figure 2-2).
Choose Mirror Margins on the Multiple Pages drop-down list and adjust
the margins accordingly if you intend to print on both sides of the paper.
✦Applying margin changes: On the Apply To drop-down list, choose
Whole Document to apply your margin settings to the entire document;
This Section to apply them to a section; or This Point Forward to change
margins in the rest of a document. When you choose This Point Forward,
Word creates a new section.
If you’re in a hurry to change margins, you can change them on the ruler.
Display the ruler and drag the Left Margin, Right Margin, or Top Margin
marker. You can find these markers by moving the pointer onto a ruler and
looking for the two-headed arrow near a margin boundary. It appears, along
with a pop-up label, when the pointer is over a margin marker.
To get a good look at where margins are as you’re working in a document, click
the Office button and choose Word Options. In the Word Options dialog box,
select the Advanced category, and click the Show Text Boundaries check box
(you’ll find it under Show Document Content).
Indenting Paragraphs and First Lines
An indent is the distance between a margin and the text, not the edge of the
page and the text. Word offers a handful of different ways to change the inden-
tation of paragraphs. You can change the indentation of first lines as well as
entire paragraphs. To start, select all or part of the paragraphs you want to
re-indent (just click in a paragraph if you want to re-indent only on paragraph).
Then click an Indent button, fiddle with the indentation marks on the ruler,
or go to the Paragraph dialog box. All three techniques are described here.
Clicking an Indent button (for left-indents)
Click the Increase Indent or Decrease Indent button (or press Ctrl+M or
Ctrl+Shift+M) on the Home tab to move a paragraph a half-inch farther away
from or closer to the left margin. If you created tab stops, text is indented to
the next or previous tab stop as well as to the next or previous half-inch.
This is the fastest way to indent text, although you can’t indent first lines
or indent from the right margin this way.

“Eye-balling it” with the ruler
You can also change indentations by using the ruler to “eyeball it.” This tech-
nique requires some dexterity with the mouse, but it allows you to see 
precisely where paragraphs and the first lines of paragraphs are indented.
If necessary, display the ruler by going to the View tab and clicking the
Ruler check box. Then click in or select the paragraph or paragraphs that
need indenting and use these techniques to re-indent them:
✦Indenting an entire paragraph from the left margin: Drag the left-indent
marker on the ruler to the right. Figure 2-3 shows where this marker is
on the ruler. Dragging the left-indent marker moves the first-line indent
marker as well.
✦Indenting the first line of a paragraph: Drag the first-line indent marker
to the right (see Figure 2-3). This marker determines how far the first
line of the paragraph is indented.
✦Making a hanging indent: Drag the hanging indent marker to the right of
the first-line indent marker (see Figure 2-3). A hanging indent is one in
which the first line of a paragraph appears to “hang” into the margin
because the second and subsequent lines are indented to the right of
the first line.
✦Indenting an entire paragraph from the right margin: Drag the right-
indent marker to the left (see Figure 2-3).
Notice the shaded areas on the left and right sides of the ruler. These areas
represent the page margins.

Going to the Paragraph dialog box
Yet another way to indent a paragraph or first line is to visit the Paragraph
dialog box. Click in or select the paragraph or paragraphs in question and
then click the Paragraph group button on the Home tab. You see the Indents
and Spacing tab of the Paragraph dialog box. Change the indentation set-
tings. If you want to indent the first line or create a hanging indent, choose
First Line or Hanging on the Special drop-down list and enter a measurement
in the By box.
Numbering the Pages
Word numbers the pages in a document automatically. How do you want
page numbers to appear in your document? You can number them in
sequence starting with the number 1, number pages starting with a different
number, use different number formats, include chapter numbers in page
numbers, and number the pages by section. You can make page numbers a
part of headers and footers or use “prefabricated” numbers, as shown in
Figure 2-4.
Prefabricated page numbers are elegant (see Figure 2-4). You would have
a hard time creating them on your own. However, you can’t change their
number formats or adjust their position on the page. Include the page
number in a header or footer if you want an unusual number formatting
scheme for your page numbers.
To handle page numbers (as well as headers and footers), you must be in
Print Layout view. Click the Print Layout view button or click the Print
Layout button on the View tab.

Using “prefabricated” page numbers
To insert a prefabricated page number, click the Page Number button on
the Insert tab, choose where on the page you want to put the page number
(Top, Bottom, or Page Margins), and choose a prefabricated number on the
submenu.
You can do one or two things to change a prefabricated page number. If nec-
essary, switch to Print Layout view and double-click in the Header or Footer
area of your page to work with the header or footer (you can also go to the
Insert tab and click the Header or Footer button). Then follow these steps to
alter a prefabricated page number:
1. Move the pointer over the page number and double-click it.
As shown in Figure 2-5, double-clicking the page number selects it and
places it in a text frame.
2. Change the look and format of the page number.
With the page number selected, you can change the number’s appear-
ance and formatting:
• Changing a number’s appearance: Choose a new font or font size on
the Mini Toolbar (right-click the page number if you have trouble
making the Mini Toolbar appear).
• Changing number formats: Click the Page Number button on the
(Header & Footer Tools) Design tab and choose Format Page
Numbers on the drop-down list. You see the Page Number Format
dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-5. You can’t change number formats
for prefabricated page numbers in this dialog box, but you can
include the chapter number in the page number, continue numbering
from a previous section, and start numbering from a numeral other
than 1. See “Changing page number formats” later in this chapter.

To remove a prefabricated page number, double-click the header or footer
where it is located, click the Page Number button on the (Header & Footer
Tools) Design tab, and choose Remove Page Numbers on the drop-down list.
Including a page number in a header or footer
To make the page number a part of a header or footer, double-click in the
header or footer where you want the page number to appear. (Later in this
chapter, “Putting Headers and Footers on Pages” explains headers and foot-
ers.) Then follow these steps to insert the page number:
1. On the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab, click the Page Number
button and choose a position (Top of Page, Bottom of Page, or Page
Margins) on the drop-down list.
You see a submenu with page number choices.
2. Scroll through the submenu and choose a page number format.
The “Page X of Y” options are for listing the total number of pages in a
document as well as the page number. For example, page 2 of a 10-page
document is numbered “Page 2 of 10.” You can change the font and font
size of page numbers and the word page by selecting them and giving a
font or font-size command.
Changing page number formats
Change page number formats in the Page Number Format dialog box (refer
to Figure 2-5). To display this dialog box, make sure you’re in Print Layout
view and double-click your header or footer. Then use one of the following
methods:
✦On the Insert tab, click the Page Number button and choose Format
Page Numbers on the drop-down list.
✦On the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab, click the Page Number
button and choose Format Page Numbers on the drop-down list.
In the Page Number Format dialog box, get to work to make your page num-
bers just-so:
✦Choosing a different number format: Open the Number Format drop-
down list and choose a page-numbering format. You can use numbers,
letters, and Roman numerals.
✦Including chapter numbers in page numbers: If your document gener-
ates chapter numbers automatically from headings assigned the same

style (a subject not covered in this book), you can include the chapter
number in the page number. Click the Include Chapter Number check
box, choose a style, and choose a separator to go between the chapter
number and page number.
✦Numbering each section separately: Click the Start At option button
(not the Continue from Previous Section button) to begin counting
pages anew at each section in your document. Earlier in this chapter,
“Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes” explains sections.
✦Start numbering pages at a number other than 1: Click the Start At
option button and enter a number other than 1.
To keep some pages in a document from being numbered, create a section
for those pages, and then remove page numbers from the section. To paginate
your document, Word skips the section you created and resumes numbering
pages in the following section.
Putting Headers and Footers on Pages
A header is a little description that appears along the top of a page so that
the reader knows what’s what. Usually, headers include the page number and
a title, and often the author’s name appears in the header as well. A footer is
the same thing as a header except that it appears along the bottom of the
page, as befits its name.
These pages explain everything a mere mortal needs to know about headers
and footers. Meanwhile, here are the ground rules for managing them:
✦Switching to Print Layout view: To enter, read, edit or delete headers
and footers, you must be in Print Layout view. You can’t see headers and
footers in the other views.
✦Displaying the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab: As shown in
Figure 2-6, you manage headers and footers by way of buttons on the
(Header & Footer Tools) Design tab. To display this tab after you create
a header or footer, switch to Print Layout view and double-click a header
or footer.
✦Closing the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab: Click the Close Header
and Footer button.
✦Placing different headers and footers in the same document: To change
headers or footers in the middle of a document, you have to create a
new section. See “Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes”
earlier in this chapter.

Putting Headers and Footers on Pages
206
Creating, editing, and removing headers and footers
Follow these instructions to create, edit, and delete headers and footers:
✦Creating a header or footer: On the Insert tab, click the Header or
Footer button, and on the drop-down list, choose a header or footer.
You can find several ready-made headers or footers on the drop-down
list; the fancier ones are at the bottom. You can find preformatted page
numbers, dates, and places to enter a document title and author’s name
on many headers and footers.
✦Choosing a different header or footer: Don’t like the header or footer
you chose? If necessary, double-click your header or footer to display
the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab. Then click the Header or Footer
button and choose a new header or footer on the drop-down list.
✦Editing a header or footer: Click the Header or Footer button and
choose Edit Header or Edit Footer on the drop-down list. The cursor
moves into the header or footer so you can enter or format text.
✦Removing a header or footer: Click the Header or Footer button and
choose Remove Header or Remove Footer on the drop-down list.
To switch back and forth between the header and footer, click the Go to
Header or Go to Footer button on the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab.
As you work away on your header and footer, you can call on most of the
text-formatting commands on the Home tab. You can change the text’s font
and font size, click an alignment button, and paste text from the Clipboard.
Tabs are set up in most headers and footers to make it possible to center,
left-align, and right-align text. To center a header or footer, for example,
press the Tab key once to go to the Center tab mark, and start typing.

Fine-tuning a header or footer
Here is advice for making a perfect header or footer:
✦Inserting a page number: See “Including a page number in a header or
footer” and “Changing page number formats” earlier in this chapter.
✦Inserting the date and time: Click the Date & Time button, choose a
date format in the Date and Time dialog box, and click OK. Click the
Update Automatically check box if you want the date to record when
you print the document, not when you created your header or footer.
✦Changing headers and footers from section to section: Use the Link to
Previous button to determine whether headers and footers are different
from section to section (you must divide the document into sections to
have different headers and footers). Unpressing (clicking to release) this
button tells Word that you want your header or footer to be different
from the header or footer in the previous section of the document;
pressing this button (clicking it so it looks selected) tells Word that
you want your header or footer to be the same as the header or footer
in the previous section of your document. To make a different header or
footer, deselect the Link to Previous button and enter a different header
or footer.
When the header or footer is the same as that of the previous section, the
Header or Footer box reads Same as Previous (refer to Figure 2-6);
when the header or footer is different from that of the previous section,
the words Same as Previous don’t appear. You can click the Show
Previous or Show Next button to examine the header or footer in the
previous or next section.
✦Different headers and footers for odd and even pages: Click the Different
Odd & Even Pages check box to create different headers and footers for
odd and even pages. As “Setting Up and Changing the Margins” explains
earlier in this chapter, documents in which text is printing on both sides
of the page can have different headers and footers for the left and right
side of the page spread. The Header or Footer box reads Odd or Even to
tell you which side of the page spread you’re dealing with when you
enter your header or footer.
✦Removing headers and footers from the first page: Click the Different
First Page check box to remove a header or footer from the first page of
a document or section. Typically, the first page of letters and reports are
not numbered.

Adjusting the Space between Lines
208
Adjusting the Space between Lines
To change the spacing between lines, select the lines whose spacing you
want to change, or simply put the cursor in a paragraph if you’re changing
the line spacing throughout a paragraph (if you’re just starting a document,
you’re ready to go). Then, on the Home tab, click the Line Spacing button
and choose an option on the drop-down list.
To take advantage of more line-spacing options, click the Paragraph group
button on the Home tab or choose Line Spacing Options on the Line Spacing
button drop-down list. You see the Paragraph dialog box. Select an option on
the Line Spacing drop-down list:
Including a logo in a header or footer
As long as it’s small enough, you can include a
company logo in a header or footer. To do so,
click the Picture button on the (Header & Footer
Tools) Design tab, select the logo graphic in the
Insert Picture dialog box, and click the Insert
button. (Book VIII, Chapter 3 describes how to
recolor and change the size of graphics; Book I,
Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate graphics.)
If you often insert the same header and footer
with a logo in headers and footers, you can
place it in the Building Blocks gallery and be
able to enter it in a hurry:
 Placing a logo header or footer in the
Building Blocks gallery: Place a logo in the
header or footer, being careful to locate it
where you want it to go when you insert it in
the future. Then select your header or footer
by dragging over it or by clicking once in
the margin to its left. On the (Header & Footer
Tools) Design tab, click the Quick Parts button
and choose Save Selection to Quick Part
Gallery on the drop-down list. You see the
Create New Building Block dialog box. Enter
a descriptive name for the header or footer
with the logo, choose Footers or Headers
on the Gallery drop-down list, and click OK.
 Inserting a header or footer from the
Building Blocks gallery: On the Insert tab,
click the Quick Parts button and choose
Building Blocks Organizer. The Building
Blocks Organizer dialog box appears.
Select your logo (select it under the name
you gave it) and click the Insert button.

Adjusting the Space between Paragraphs
209
✦At Least: Choose this one if you want Word to adjust for tall symbols or
other unusual text. Word adjusts the lines but makes sure there is, at
minimum, the number of points you enter in the At box between each line.
✦Exactly: Choose this one and enter a number in the At box if you want a
specific amount of space between lines.
✦Multiple: Choose this one and put a number in the At box to get triple-
spaced, quadruple-, quintuple-, or any other number of spaced lines.
To quickly single-space text, click the text or select it if you want to change
more than one paragraph, and press Ctrl+1. To quickly double-space text,
select the text and press Ctrl+2. Press Ctrl+5 to put one and a half lines
between lines of text.
Adjusting the Space between Paragraphs
Rather than press Enter to put a blank line between paragraphs, you can
open the Paragraph dialog box and enter a point-size measurement in the
Before or After text box. The Before and After measurements place a specific
amount of space before and after paragraphs.
Truth be told, the Before and After options are for use with styles (a subject
of Chapter 3 in this mini-book). When you create a style, you can tell Word
to always follow a paragraph in a certain style with a paragraph in another
style. For example, a paragraph in the Chapter Title style might always be
followed by a paragraph in the Chapter Intro style. In cases like these, when
you know that paragraphs assigned to one type of style will always follow
paragraphs assigned to another style, you can confidently put space before
and after paragraphs. But if you use the Before and After styles indiscrimi-
nately, you can end up with large blank spaces between paragraphs.
Go to the Home tab and use one of these techniques to adjust the amount of
space between paragraphs:
✦Click the Line Spacing button and choose Add Space Before Paragraph or
Add Space after Paragraph on the drop-down list. These commands place
ten points of blank space before or after the paragraph that the cursor is in.
✦Click the Paragraph group button to open the Paragraph dialog box, and
enter point-size measurements in the Before and After boxes (or choose
Auto in these boxes to enter one blank line between paragraphs in 
whatever your Line-Spacing choice is). The Don’t Add Space between
Paragraphs of the Same Style check box tells Word to ignore Before and
After measurements if the previous or next paragraph is assigned the
same style as the paragraph that the cursor is in.

Creating Numbered and Bulleted Lists
210
Creating Numbered and Bulleted Lists
What is a word-processed document without a list or two? It’s like an emperor
with no clothes. Numbered lists are invaluable in manuals and books like
this one that present a lot of step-by-step procedures. Use bulleted lists when
you want to present alternatives to the reader. A bullet is a black, filled-in
circle or other character. These pages explain numbered lists, bulleted lists,
and multilevel lists.
Simple numbered and bulleted lists
The fastest, cleanest, and most honest way to create a numbered or bulleted
list is to enter the text without any concern for numbers or bullets. Just press
Enter at the end of each step or bulleted entry. When you’re done, select the
list and click the Numbering or Bullets button on the Home tab (or the Bullets
button on the Mini Toolbar). You can also click the Numbering or Bullets
button and start typing the list. Each time you press Enter, Word enters the
next number or another bullet.
Meanwhile, here are some tricks for handling lists:
✦Ending a list: Press the Enter key twice after typing the last entry in the
list. You can also right-click the list, choose Bullets or Numbering, and
choose None on the submenu.
✦Removing the number or bullets: Select the list and click the
Numbering or Bullets button.
✦Adjusting how far a list is indented: Right-click anywhere in the list,
choose Adjust List Indents, and enter a new measurement in the Text
Indent box.
✦Resuming a numbered list: Suppose that you want a numbered list to
resume where a list you entered earlier ended. In other words, suppose
that you left off writing a four-step list, put in a graphic or some para-
graphs, and now you want to resume the list at Step 5. Click the
Numbering button to start numbering again. The AutoCorrect Options
button appears. Click it and choose Continue Numbering, or right-click
and choose Continue Numbering on the shortcut menu.
✦Starting a new list: Suppose that you want to start a brand-new list right
away. Right-click the number Word entered and choose Restart at 1 on
the shortcut menu.
Constructing lists of your own
If you’re an individualist and you want numbered and bulleted lists to work
your way, follow these instructions for choosing unusual bulleted characters
and number formats:

211
✦Choosing a different numbering scheme: On the Home tab, open the
drop-down list on the Numbering button and choose a numbering
scheme on the drop-down list. You can also choose Define New Number
Format. As shown in Figure 2-7, you see the Define New Number Format
dialog box, where you can choose a number format, choose a font for
numbers, and toy with number alignments.
✦Choosing a different bullet character: On the Home tab or Mini Toolbar,
open the drop-down list on the Bullets button and choose a different bullet
character on the drop-down list. You can also choose Define New Bullet
to open the Define New Bullet dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-7, and click
the Symbol button to choose a bullet character in the Symbol dialog box
(Book I, Chapter 2 describes symbols). The dialog box also offers oppor-
tunities for indenting bullets and the text that follows them in new ways.

Automatic lists and what to do about them
Word creates automatic lists for you whether
you like it or not. To see what I mean, type the
number 1, type a period, and press the spacebar.
Word immediately creates a numbered list. In the
same manner, Word creates a bulleted list when
you type an asterisk (*) and press the spacebar.
Some people find this kind of behind-the-
scenes skullduggery annoying. If you’re one
such person, do one of the following to keep
Word from making lists automatically:
 Click the AutoCorrect Options button — it
appears automatically — and choose Stop
Automatically Creating Lists.
 Click the Office button, choose Word
Options, select the Proofing category, and
click the AutoCorrect Options button. On
the AutoFormat As You Type tab in the
AutoCorrect dialog box, deselect the
Automatic Numbered Lists and Automatic
Bulleted Lists check boxes.

Working with Tabs
212
Managing a multilevel list
A multilevel list, also called a nested list, is a list with subordinate entries,
as shown in Figure 2-8. To create a multilevel list, you declare what kind of
list you want, and then, when you enter items for the list, you indent the
items that you want to be subordinate. Follow these steps to create a multi-
level list:
1. On the Home tab, click the Multilevel List button and choose what
kind of list you want.
If none of the lists suit you, you can choose Define New Multilevel
List and create a new kind of list in the Define New Multilevel List
dialog box.
2. Enter the items for the list, pressing Enter as you complete each one.
3. Select a list item (or items) and click the Increase Indent button (or press
Ctrl+M) to make the items subordinate in the list; click the Decrease
Indent button (or press Ctrl+Shift+M) to raise their rank in the list.
Repeat Step 3 until the list is just-so.
Working with Tabs
Tabs are a throwback to the days of the typewriter, when it was necessary to
make tab stops in order to align the next item. Except for making leaders and
aligning text in headers and footers, everything you can do with tabs can
also be done by creating a table — and it can be done far faster. All you have
to do is align the text inside the table and then remove the table borders.
Book I, Chapter 5 explains tables.
Figure 2-8:
Examples of

Working with Tabs
213
A tab stop is a point on the ruler around which or against which text is for-
matted (on the View tab, click the Ruler check box to display the ruler).
When you press the Tab key, you advance the text cursor by one tab stop.
Tab stops are set at half-inch intervals on the ruler, but you can change that
if you want. You can also change the type of tab. By default, tabs are left-
aligned, which means that when you enter letters after you press the Tab
key, the letters move toward the right in the same way that they move toward
the right when text is left-aligned. However, Word also offers right, center,
decimal, and bar tabs. Figure 2-9 shows the differences between the tab 
settings. Notice the symbols on the ruler — they tell you what type of tab
you’re dealing with.
To change tabs or change where tabs appear on the ruler, start by selecting
the paragraphs for which you need different tabs. Then click in the Tab box
on the left side of the ruler as many times as necessary to choose the kind of
tab you want, and click the ruler where you want the tab to go. You can click
as many times as you want and enter more than one kind of tab.
To move a tab, simply drag it to a new location on the ruler. Text that has
been aligned with the tab moves as well. To remove a tab, drag it off the
ruler. When you remove a tab, the text to which it was aligned is aligned to
the next remaining tab stop on the ruler or to the next default tab stop if you
didn’t create any tab stops of your own.
Sometimes it’s hard to tell where tabs were put in the text. To find out, click
the Show/Hide¶button on the Home tab to see the formatting characters,
including the arrows that show where the Tab key was pressed.

Hyphenating a Document
214
Hyphenating a Document
The first thing you should know about hyphenating the words in a document
is that you may not need to do it. Text that hasn’t been hyphenated is much
easier to read, which is why the majority of text in this book, for example,
isn’t hyphenated. It has a ragged right margin, to borrow typesetter lingo.
Hyphenate only when text is trapped in columns or in other narrow places,
or when you want a very formal-looking document.
Do not insert a hyphen simply by pressing the hyphen key, because the hyphen
stays there even if the word moves to the middle of a line and doesn’t need
to be broken in half. Instead, when a big gap appears in the right margin and
a word is crying out to be hyphenated, put the cursor where the hyphen
All about tab leaders
In my opinion, the only reason to fool with tabs
and tab stops is to create tab leaders like the
ones shown in the following figure. A leader is
a series of punctuation marks — periods in the
illustration — that connect text across a page.
Leaders are very elegant. For the figure, I used
left-aligned tab stops for the characters’ names
and right-aligned tab stops for the players’
names. I included leaders so that you can tell
precisely who played whom.
Follow these steps to create tab leaders:
1. Enter the text, and in each line, enter a tab
space between the text on the left side and
the text on the right side.
2. Select the text you entered.
3. On the Home tab, click the Paragraph
group button, and in the Paragraph dialog
box, click the Tabs button.
You see the Tabs dialog box.
4. Enter a position for the first new tab in the
Tab Stop Position box.
5. Under Leader in the dialog box, select the
punctuation symbol you want.
6. Click OK, display the ruler, and drag tab
markers to adjust the space between the
text on the left and right.

needs to go and press Ctrl+hyphen. This way, you tell Word to make the
hyphen appear only if the word breaks at the end of a line. (To remove a
manual hyphen, press the Show/Hide ¶button so that you can see it; then
backspace over it.)
Automatically and manually 
hyphenating a document
To hyphenate a document, tell Word to do it automatically or pick and
choose where the hyphens go by hyphenating your document manually:
✦Automatic hyphenation: On the Page Layout tab, click the Hyphenation
button and choose Automatic on the drop-down list. Word hyphenates
your document (or a portion of your document, if you selected it first).
You can tell Word how to hyphenate automatically by clicking the
Hyphenation button and choosing Hyphenation Options. You see the
Hyphenation dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-10. Deselect the Hyphenate
Words in CAPS check box if you don’t care to hyphenate words in upper-
case. Words that fall in the hyphenation zone are hyphenated, so enlarging
the large zone means a less ragged right margin but more ugly hyphens,
and a small zone means fewer ugly hyphens but a more ragged right
margin. You can limit how many hyphens appear consecutively by 
entering a number in the Limit Consecutive Hyphens To box.
✦Manual hyphenation: On the Page Layout tab, click the Hyphenation
button and choose Manual on the drop-down list. Word displays a box
with some hyphenation choices in it, as shown in Figure 2-10. The cursor
blinks on the spot where Word suggests putting a hyphen. Click Yes or
No to accept or reject Word’s suggestion. Keep accepting or rejecting
Word’s suggestions until the text is hyphenated.

Unhyphenating and other hyphenation tasks
More hyphenation esoterica:
✦Unhyphenating: To “unhyphenate” a document you hyphenated automat-
ically, click the Hyphenation button on the Page Layout tab and choose
Hyphenation Options. In the Hyphenation dialog box (see Figure 2-10),
deselect the Automatically Hyphenate Document check box and click OK.
✦Preventing text from being hyphenated: Select the text and click the
Paragraph group button on the Home tab. In the Paragraph dialog box,
select the Line and Page Breaks tab, and click the Don’t Hyphenate
check box. (If you can’t hyphenate a paragraph, it’s probably because
this box was checked unintentionally.)
✦Hyphenating a single paragraph or two: To hyphenate a paragraph or
two in the middle of a document — maybe because it’s a long quote or
some other thing that needs to stand out — select the paragraph and
hyphenate it manually by clicking the Manual button in the Hyphenation
dialog box.
Em and en dashes
Here is something about hyphens that editors
and typesetters know, but the general public
does not know: Hyphens and dashes are differ-
ent. Most people insert a hyphen where they
ought to use an em dash or an en dash:
 An em dash looks like a hyphen but is
wider — it’s as wide as the letter m. The
previous sentence has an em dash in it. Did
you notice?
 An en dash is the width of the letter n. Use
en dashes to show inclusive numbers or
time periods, like so: pp. 45–50; Aug.–Sept.
1998; Exodus 16:11–16:18. An en dash is a
little bit longer than a hyphen.
To place em or en dashes in your documents
and impress your local typesetter or editor, not
to mention your readers, press Alt+Ctrl+– (the
minus sign key on the Numeric keypad) to enter
an em dash, or Ctrl+– (on the numeric keypad)
to enter an en dash. You can also go to the
Insert tab, click the Symbol button, choose
More Symbols on the drop-down list, select the
Special Characters tab in the Symbol dialog
box, and choose Em Dash or En Dash.

elcome to what may be the most important chapter of this book —
the most important in Book II, anyway. Styles can save a ridiculous
amount of time that you would otherwise spend formatting and wrestling
with text. And many Word features rely on styles. You can’t create a table of
contents or use the document map unless each heading in your document
has been assigned a heading style. Nor can you take advantage of Outline
view and the commands for moving text around in that view. You can’t
cross-reference headings or number the headings in a document.
If you want to be stylish, at least where Word is concerned, you have to
know about styles.
All about Styles
A style is a collection of commands and formats that have been bundled
under one name. With styles, you don’t have to visit a bunch of dialog boxes
to change the formatting of text or paragraphs. Instead, you simply choose a
style from the Quick Styles gallery or the Styles window. You can be certain
that all parts of the document that were assigned the same style look the
same. In short, you can fool everybody into thinking your documents were
created by a pro.
The template you used to create your document determines which styles are
available. Each template comes with its own set of styles, and you can create
your own styles, too. A simple document created with the Normal template —
a document that you created by double-clicking the Blank Document icon or
pressing Ctrl+N — has but a few styles, but a document that was created
with an advanced template comes with many styles. (Later in this chapter,
“Creating and Managing Templates” explains templates.)

All about Styles
218
To see which styles are available in your document, go to the Home tab and
open the Styles gallery (you may have to click the Quick Styles button first)
or click the Styles group button to display the Styles window. As shown in
Figure 3-1, the Styles gallery and Styles window show which styles are 
available to you. Want to know which style has been assigned to text or a
paragraph? Click the text or paragraph and glance at the Styles gallery or
Styles window.
In the Styles gallery and Style window (if you click the Show Preview check
box), each style name is formatted to give you an idea of what it does to text
when you apply it in your document. Word offers four types of styles:
✦Paragraph styles: Determine the formatting of entire paragraphs.
A paragraph style can include these settings: font, paragraph, tab,
border, language, and bullets and numbering. Paragraph styles are
marked with the paragraph symbol (¶).
✦Character styles: Apply to text, not to paragraphs. You select text before
you apply a character style. Create a character style for text that is hard
to lay out and for foreign language text. A character style can include
these settings: font, border, and language. When you apply a character
style to text, the character-style settings override the paragraph-style
settings. If the paragraph style calls for a 14-point Arial text but the char-
acter style calls for 12-point Times Roman font, the character style wins.
Character styles are marked with the letter a.

Applying a Style to Text and Paragraphs
219
✦Linked (paragraph and character): Apply paragraph formats as well as
the text formats throughout a paragraph. These styles are marked with
the paragraph symbol (¶) as well as the letter a.
✦Table styles: Apply to tables (Book I, Chapter 5 describes creating and
formatting tables). Table styles are marked with a grid icon.
✦List styles: Apply to lists. List styles are marked with the paragraph icon.
The beauty of styles is this: After you modify a style, all paragraphs or text
to which the style has been assigned are instantly changed. You don’t have
to go back and reformat text and paragraphs throughout your document.
Applying a Style to Text and Paragraphs
Word offers several ways to apply a style, and you’re invited to choose the
one that works best for you. These pages explain how to choose a style set,
apply a style, and tell Word how to present style names in various places for
your enjoyment and pleasure.
Experimenting with style sets
A style set is a slight variation on the styles in the template you chose for
your document. Style sets include Classic, Elegant, Fancy, and Modern.
When you choose a style set, you impose a slightly different look on your
document — you make it classier, more elegant, fancier, or more modern.
All templates, even those you create yourself, offer style sets. Style sets are
a convenient way to experiment with the overall look of a document.
To experiment with style sets, click the Change Styles button on the Home
tab, choose Style Set on the drop-down list, and do one of the following:
✦Choose a new style set: Choose a style set on the submenu.
✦Use the original styles in the template: Choose Reset to Quick Styles
from Template on the submenu.
Applying a style
The first step in applying a style is to select the paragraph you want to apply
the style to, or to apply a style to several paragraphs, select all or part of
them; if you’re applying a character style, select the letters whose formatting
you want to change. Then apply the style using one of these techniques:

✦Styles gallery: On the Home tab, choose a style in the Styles gallery
(refer to Figure 3-1). Depending on the size of your screen, you may have
to click the Quick Styles button to open the gallery. The formatted let-
ters above each style name give you an idea of what your style choice
will do to paragraphs or text. You can’t tell from looking which type of
style — Paragraph, Character, or Linked — you’re choosing from, but
you can “live-preview” styles on the Quick Styles gallery.
If styles from your template don’t appear in the Quick Styles gallery and
you want them to appear there, click the Change Styles button, choose
Style Set on the drop-down list, and choose Reset to Quick Styles from
Template on the submenu.
✦Styles window: On the Home tab, click the Styles group button to open
the Styles window, and select a style (refer to Figure 3-1). By clicking the
Show Preview check box, you can view formatted style names and get an
idea of what the different styles are. You can drag the Styles window to
different locations on your screen.
✦Apply Styles task pane: Choose a style on the Apply Styles task pane
(refer to Figure 3-1). To display this task pane, open the Styles gallery
and choose Apply Styles (look for this option at the bottom of the
gallery). You can drag the Apply Styles task pane to a corner of the
screen.
To strip a paragraph or text of its style and give it the generic Normal style,
select it, open the Styles gallery, and choose Clear Formatting. You can also
click the Clear All command at the top of the Styles window. To “unapply” a
style throughout a document, open its drop-down list in the Styles window
and choose Remove All.
Shortcuts for applying styles
A handful of keyboard shortcuts can be very
handy when applying paragraph styles:
 Normal: Ctrl+Shift+N
 Bulleted List: Ctrl+Shift+L
 Heading 1: Ctrl+Alt+1
 Heading 2: Ctrl+Alt+2
 Heading 3: Ctrl+Alt+3
 Next higher heading: Alt+Shift+→
 Next lower heading: Alt+Shift+←
You can assign keyboard shortcuts to styles.
Book VIII, Chapter 1 explains how.

Applying a Style to Text and Paragraphs
221
Choosing which style names appear 
on the Style menus
As I explain, you can apply a style by way of the Styles gallery, Styles
window, and Apply Styles task pane. The latter two can become crowded
with many style names, which makes choosing styles difficult. To make
choosing styles easier, you can decide for yourself which style names
appear on the Styles gallery, Styles window, and Apply Styles task pane.
In the Styles gallery, remove a style name by right-clicking it and choosing
Remove from Quick Style Gallery. If you regret removing style names from
the Styles gallery, click the Change Styles button and choose Style Set➪Reset
Document Quick Styles.
To decide for yourself which style names appear in the Styles window and
Apply Styles task pane, click the Styles group button, and in the Styles
window, click the Options link (you can find this link near the bottom of the
window). You see the Style Pane Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Choose options in the dialog box to tell Word which style names to present
in the Styles window and Apply Styles task pane:
✦Select Styles to Show: Choose All Styles to show all style names. The
other options place a subset of names in the window and task pane.
Recommended style names are those Microsoft thinks you need most
often.
✦Select How List Is Sorted: Choose an option to describe how to list styles.
Except for Based On, these options, I think, are self-explanatory. The Based
On option lists styles in alphabetical order according to which style each
is based on. (Later in this chapter, “Creating a style from the ground up”
explains how the based on style is used in constructing styles.)
Figure 3-2:

222
✦Select Formatting to Show As Styles: Choose options to declare which
styles to list — those that pertain to paragraph level formatting, fonts,
and bulleted and numbered lists.
✦Select How Built-In Style Names Are Shown: Choose options to tell how
to handle built-in styles, the styles that Word applies on its own when
you create tables of contents and other self-generating lists.
✦Apply to this document or to the template as well: Click the Only in
This Document option button to apply your choices only to the docu-
ment you’re working on; click the New Documents Based on This Template
option button to apply your choices to your document and all future
documents you create with the template you’re using.
Creating a New Style
You can create a new style in two ways: by creating it from a paragraph or
building it from the ground up. To do a thorough job, build it from the ground
up because styles you create this way can be made part of the template you’re
currently working in and can be copied to other templates (later in this
chapter, “Creating and Managing Templates” explains templates).
Creating a style from a paragraph
Follow these steps to create a new style from a paragraph:
1. Click in a paragraph whose formatting you would like to turn into a
style.
2. Right-click and choose Styles➪Save Selection As a New Quick Style.
You see the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box. You can also
open this dialog box by choosing Save Selection As a New Quick Style in
the Quick Styles gallery.
3. Enter a name for your new style.
4. Click OK.
A style you create this way becomes a part of the document you’re
working on — it isn’t made part of the template from which you created
your document.
Creating a style from the ground up
If you want to make a style available in documents you will create in the
future, make it part of a template and build it from the ground up. In the
Styles window, click the New Style button (you can find it in the lower-left
corner of the window). You see the Create New Style from Formatting dialog
box, as shown in Figure 3-3. Fill in the dialog box and click OK.

Book II
Chapter 3
Word Styles
Creating a New Style
223
Here’s a rundown of the options in the Create New Style from Formatting
dialog box:
✦Name: Enter a descriptive name for the style, one you will recognize in
the Styles window and Quick Styles gallery.
✦Style Type: On the drop-down list, choose a style type (“All about
Styles,” earlier in this chapter, describes the five style types).
✦Style Based On: If your new style is similar to a style that is already part
of the template with which you created your document, choose the style
to get a head start on creating the new one. Be warned, however, that if
you or someone else changes the Based On style, your new style will
inherit those changes and be altered as well.
✦Style for Following Paragraph: Choose a style from the drop-down list
if the style you’re creating is always followed by an existing style. For
example, a new style called Chapter Title might always be followed by a
style called Chapter Intro Paragraph. If that were the case, you would
choose Chapter Intro Paragraph from this drop-down list.
✦Formatting: Choose options from the menus or click buttons to fashion
or refine your style (you can also click the Format button to do this).
✦Add to Quick Style List: Click this check box to make the style’s name
appear in the Styles gallery, Styles window, and Apply Styles task pane.
✦Automatically Update: Normally, when you make a formatting change to
a paragraph, the style assigned to the paragraph does not change at all,
but the style does change if you check this box. By checking this box,
you tell Word to alter the style itself each time you alter a paragraph to
Figure 3-3:
Creating a
brand-
spanking-
new style.

Modifying a Style
224
which you’ve assigned the style. With this box checked, all paragraphs
in the document that were assigned the style are altered each time you
change a single paragraph that was assigned the style.
✦Only in This Document/New Documents Based on This Template:
To make your style a part of the template from which you created your
document as well as the document itself, click the New Documents
Based on This Template option button. This way, new documents you
create that are based on the template you’re using can also make use of
the new style.
✦Format: This is the important one. Click the button and make a format-
ting choice. Word takes you to dialog boxes so that you can create or
refine the style.
Modifying a Style
What if you decide at the end of an 80-page document that all 35 introduc-
tory paragraphs to which you’ve assigned the Intro Para style look funny?
If you click the Automatically Update check box in the New Style dialog box
when you create the style, all you have to do is alter a paragraph to which
you assigned the Intro Para style to alter all 35 introductory paragraphs.
However, if you decide against updating styles automatically, you can still
change the introductory paragraphs throughout your document.
Follow these steps to modify a style that isn’t updated automatically:
1. Click in any paragraph, table, or list to which you’ve assigned the
style; if you want to modify a character style, select the characters to
which you’ve assigned the style.
2. In the Styles window or Apply Styles task pane, make sure the name
of the style you want to modify is selected.
If the right name isn’t selected, select it now in the Styles window or
Apply Styles task pane.
3. In the Styles window, open the style’s drop-down list and choose
Modify; in the Apply Styles task pane, click the Modify button.
You see the Modify Style dialog box. Does the box look familiar?
That’s because it’s virtually identical to Create New Style from
Formatting dialog box you used to create the style in the first place
(refer to Figure 3-3). The only difference is that you can’t choose a style
type in the Modify Style dialog box.
4. Change the settings in the Modify Styles dialog box and click OK.
The preceding section in this chapter explains the settings.

Book II
Chapter 3
Word Styles
Creating and Managing Templates
225
While the Modify Style dialog box is open, you can check the Automatically
Update check box if you want future modifications that you make to the style
to be applied automatically. This way, when you change a paragraph or text
to which the style has been applied, all other paragraphs and text in your
document are changed accordingly.
Creating and Managing Templates
Every document you create is founded upon a template. When you double-
click the Blank Template icon in the New Document dialog box or press
Ctrl+N, you create a document founded on the Normal template. And if you
create a document with a template from Microsoft Office Online or a tem-
plate from the New dialog box, you create a complex document with many
different styles.
Each template comes with its own styles. Suppose that you create a complex
document and you want to be able to use its styles in other documents. To
be able to do that, you can create a template from your document. For that
matter, you can create a template from scratch by assembling styles from
other templates and documents.
Attaching a different template to a document
It happens in the best of families. You create or
are given a document only to discover that the
wrong template is attached to it. For times like
those, Word gives you the opportunity to switch
templates. Follow these steps:
1. On the Developer tab, click the Document
Template button.
You see the Templates and Add-Ins dialog
box. If the Developer tab isn’t displayed,
click the Office button, choose Word
Options, select the Popular category in the
Word Options dialog box, click the Show
Developer Tab in the Ribbon check box,
and click OK.
2. Click the Attach button to open the Attach
Template dialog box.
3. Find and select the template you want, and
click the Open button.
You return to the Templates and Add-ins
dialog box, where the name of the template
you chose appears in the Document
Template box.
4. Click the Automatically Update Document
Styles check box.
Doing so tells Word to apply the styles from
the new template to your document.
5. Click OK.

Creating and Managing Templates
226
Creating a new template
Here are the ways to create a new template:
✦Creating a template from scratch: Create a new document, click the
Office button, and choose Save As➪Word Template. You see the Save As
dialog box. Click the Trusted Templates button, enter a name for your
template, and click the Save button.
✦Creating a template from a document: Open your document and follow
the preceding instructions for creating a template from scratch. Your
new template will have all the styles found in the document.
✦Assembling styles from other templates: Create a new template by 
following the preceding instructions and then copy styles to your new
template (“Copying styles from different documents and templates,”
later in this chapter, explains the details). To choose a template from
which to copy styles, click the Close File button on the left side of the
Organizer dialog box, click the Open File button, select the template in
the Open dialog box, and click the Open button.
Where templates are stored depends on which version of Windows your
computer runs under:
✦Windows Vista: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\
Microsoft\Templates folder
✦Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\Username\
Application Data\Microsoft\Templates folder
✦Windows NT, 95, 98, 2000, and ME: C:\Windows\Profiles\
Application Data\Username\Application Data\Microsoft\
Templates folder, or the C:\Windows\Profiles\Application
Data\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates folder
To get into the Application Data folder where templates are stored, it may be
necessary to display hidden folders on your computer. Click the Start button
and choose Control Panel. Then double-click the Folder Options icon (you
may have to click the Switch to Classic View link first), select the View tab in
the Folder Options dialog box, and click the Show Hidden Files and Folders
option button.
To create a document from a template you created yourself, open the New
Document dialog box and double-click the My Templates icon. You see the
name of the template you created on the My Templates tab of the New dialog
box. Select your template and click OK.

Deleting and renaming styles in templates
Suppose that you need to delete styles or rename styles in a template.
Follow these steps:
1. In the Styles window, click the Manage Styles button.
You see the Manage Styles dialog box.
2. Click the Import/Export button to open the Organizer dialog box.
3. Click the Close File button on the right side of the dialog box.
4. Click the Open File button, and in the Open dialog box, select the tem-
plate that needs modifying; then click the Open button.
The names of styles in the template appear in the right side of the
dialog box.
5. Select the item you want to rename or delete.
Follow these steps to rename or delete the item:
• Rename an item: Click the Rename button, enter a new name in the
Rename dialog box, and click OK.
• Delete an item: Click the Delete button and then click Yes in the
dialog box.
Copying styles from different 
documents and templates
Suppose that you like a style in one document and you want to copy it to
another so that you can use it there. How you make the copy depends on
whether you want to copy the style into a document or into a template.
By copying it into a template, you make the style part of the template, and
the style is available for all documents that are created with that template.
However, if you need the style solely for a particular document, you may as
well copy it into the document. Doing that is easy enough.
Copying a style from one document to another
Copy a style from one document to another when you need the style on a
one-time basis. Follow these steps:
1. Select a paragraph that was assigned the style you want to copy.
Be sure to select the entire paragraph. If you want to copy a character
style, select text to which you have assigned the character style.

Creating and Managing Templates
228
2. Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ctrl+C to copy the paragraph to the
Clipboard.
3. Switch to the document you want to copy the style to and choose
Edit➪Paste or press Ctrl+V.
4. Delete the text.
The style remains in the Styles window, Styles gallery, and Apply Styles
task pane even though the text is deleted. You can call upon the style
whenever you need it.
Copying styles between templates
Use the Organizer to copy styles into other templates. By making the style a
part of a template, you can call upon the style in other documents. You can
call upon it in each document you create or created with the template.
Follow these steps to copy a style into a template:
1. In the Styles window, click the Manage Styles button.
The Manage Styles dialog box appears.
2. Click the Import/Export button.
You see the Organizer dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-4. Styles in the
document that you opened appear in the In Document list box on the
left side of the dialog box.
Select the styles you want to copy.
Click to close on template or open another.

In This Chapter
 Considering ways to desktop-publish in Word
 Fine-tuning tables
 Wrapping text around graphics and other objects
 Running text in newspaper-style columns
 Putting text boxes in documents
 Putting borders on pages
 Decorating pages with drop caps and watermarks
 Printing landscape documents
O
nce upon a time, word processors were nothing more than glorified
typewriters. They were good for typing and basic formatting, and not
much else. But over the years, Microsoft Word has become a desktop publish-
ing program in its own right. This chapter explains a few desktop publishing
features that can make your documents stand out in the crowd — columns,
text boxes, page borders, watermarks, and drop caps, to name a few.
Making Use of Charts, Diagrams, 
Shapes, Clip Art, and Photos 
Figure 4-1 shows a newsletter that includes a chart, diagram, shape, clip-art
image, and photo. You’re invited to include these items in your Word docu-
ments, and you’ll be glad to know that including them isn’t very much trouble.
✦Charts: A chart is an excellent way to present data for comparison pur-
poses. The pie slices, bars, columns, or lines tell readers right away
which business is more productive, for example, or who received the
most votes. Book I, Chapter 6 explains how to create charts.

Constructing the Perfect Table
232
✦Diagrams: A diagram allows readers to quickly grasp an idea, relation-
ship, or concept. Instead of explaining an abstract idea, you can portray
it in a diagram. Book I, Chapter 7 explains diagrams.
✦Shapes and lines: Shapes and lines can also illustrate ideas and concepts.
You can also use them for decorative purposes in Word documents.
Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to draw lines, arrows, and shapes.
✦Clip-art images: Clip-art images can make a document livelier. They add
a little color to documents. Book VIII, Chapter 4 explains how to place
clip-art images in documents.
✦Photos: A well-placed photo or two can make a newsletter or brochure
that much more attractive. Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains how to include
photos in Word documents.
Constructing the Perfect Table
Create a table to present raw data to your readers or plead your case with
numbers and facts. Provided the row labels and column headings are
descriptive, looking up information in a table is the easiest way to find it.
And tables impose order on chaos. What used to be a knotty lump of non-
descript data can be turned into an orderly statement of fact if the data is 
presented in a table. No report is complete without one or two of them.
Book I, Chapter 5 explains how to create a table, as well as how to include
mathematical calculations in Word tables. These pages explain a few table
techniques that pertain strictly to Word documents — repeating the heading
rows, fitting a table on a single page, and turning a list into a table.

233
Repeating heading rows on subsequent pages
Making sure that the heading row, sometimes called the header row, appears
on a new page if the table breaks across pages is absolutely essential. The
heading row is the first row in the table, the one that usually describes what
is in the columns below. Without a heading row, readers can’t tell what the
information in a table means. Follow these steps to make the heading row
(or rows) repeat on the top of each new page that a table appears on:
1. Place the cursor in the heading row or select the heading rows if you
have more than one at the top of your table.
2. On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click the Repeat Header Rows button
(depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Data
button first).
Heading rows appear only in Print Layout view, so don’t worry if you
can’t see them in Draft view.
Turning a list into a table
In order to turn a list into a table, all components of the list — each name,
address, city name, state, and zip code listing, for example — must be sepa-
rated from the next component by a tab space or a comma. Word looks for
tab spaces or commas when it turns a list into a table, and the program sep-
arates data into columns according to where the tab spaces or commas are
located. You have to prepare your list carefully by entering tab spaces or
commas in all the right places before you can turn your list into a table.
Follow these steps to turn a list into a table after you’ve done all the prelimi-
nary work:
1. Select the list.
2. On the Insert tab, click the Table button and choose Convert Text to
Table on the drop-down list.
You see the Convert Text to Table dialog box.
Note the number in the Number of Columns box. It should list the
number of components into which you separated your list. If the number
doesn’t match the number of components, you misplaced a tab entry or
comma in your list. Click Cancel, return to your list, and examine it to make
sure each line has been divided into the same number of components.
3. Under Separate Text At, choose the Tabs or Commas option, depend-
ing on which you used to separate the components on the list.
4. Click OK.

Constructing the Perfect Table
234
You can turn a table into a list by clicking the Convert to Text button on the
(Table Tools) Layout tab (you may have to click the Data button first,
depending on the size of your screen).
Fitting a table on the page
Ideally, a table should fit on a single page
because studying table data that is spread
across two or more pages can be difficult. Here
are a couple of suggestions for fitting a table on
a single page:
 Present the table in landscape mode: In
Landscape mode, a page is turned on its
ear so that it is wider than it is tall and you
have room for more columns. To print in
Landscape mode, however, you must
create a new section for the pages in ques-
tion. Later in this chapter, “Landscape
Documents” explains how to switch from
Portrait to Landscape mode.
 Shrink the font size: Sometimes shrinking
the font size throughout a table shrinks the
table just enough to fit it on a page. To
shrink fonts throughout a table by 1 point,
select the table and press Ctrl+[. Keep
pressing this key combination until the
table fits on one page. While you’re at it,
click the AutoFit button on the Layout tab
and choose AutoFit Contents on the drop-
down list to make each column wide
enough to accommodate its widest entry.
 Change the orientation of heading
row text: In a top-heavy table in 
which the heading row cells con-
tain text and the cells below contain num-
bers, you can make the entire table narrower
by changing the orientation of the text in
the heading row. To turn text on its ear,
select the cells whose text needs a turn, go
to the (Table Tools) Layout tab, and click the
Text Direction button. Keep clicking until
the text turns the direction you want.
Chances are if your table can’t fit on one page,
presenting the information in a table is not the
best option. Try presenting it in bulleted or num-
bered lists. Or present the information in short
paragraphs under small fourth- or fifth-level
headings.

Positioning and Wrapping Objects Relative to the Page and Text
235
Positioning and Wrapping Objects Relative 
to the Page and Text
“Object” is just Office’s generic term for a shape, line, text box, clip-art
image, photo, diagram, WordArt image, or chart that you insert in a docu-
ment. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate an object — how to
change its size, shape, and other qualities. When you place an object in a
Word document, you have to consider more than its size and shape. You also
have to consider where to position it on the page and how to wrap text
around it. In Word lingo, wrap refers to what text does when it butts heads
with a shape, text box, photo, diagram, or other object. You must be in Print
Layout view to wrap and position objects on a page.
When you insert an object, it lands inline with text. That means it lands
against the left margin and text doesn’t wrap around its side. What’s more
important, to change the position of an object, you must select it and choose
a text-wrapping option apart from Inline with Text.
Wrapping text around an object
Figure 4-2 shows the 15 different ways you can wrap text around an object.
Select the object you want to wrap text around, go to the Format tab, and
use one of these techniques to wrap text around the object:
Figure 4-2:
All the ways
to wrap text
in a Word
document.

Positioning and Wrapping Objects Relative to the Page and Text
236
✦Click the Text Wrapping button and choose an option on the drop-down
list. (You may have to click the Arrange button first, depending on the
size of your screen.)
✦Click the Text Wrapping button, choose More Layout Options on the
drop-down list, and on the Text Wrapping tab of the Advanced Layout
dialog box, choose a wrapping style and side around which to wrap text.
Figure 4-2 shows what the different combinations of Wrapping Style and
Wrap Text options do.
Wrapped text looks best when it is justified and hyphenated. That way, text
can get closer to the object that is being wrapped.
Click the Text Wrapping button and choose Edit Wrap Points to choose 
precisely how close or far text is from the object. After you choose the com-
mand, wrap points — small black squares — appear around the object. Click
and drag the wrap points to push text away from or bring text closer to the
object in question.
Positioning an object on a page
To position an object in a Word page, you can drag it to a new location.
As Book I, Chapter 8 explains in torturous detail, dragging means to select
the object, move the pointer over its perimeter, click when you see the four-
headed arrow, and slide the object to a new location.
To make positioning objects on a page a little easier, Word also offers
Position commands for moving objects. Select your object, go to the Format
tab, and use one of these techniques to move your object precisely into
place:
✦Click the Position button and select a With Text Wrapping option 
on the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 4-3. (You may have to click
the Arrange button first, depending on the size of your screen.) These
options position an object squarely in a corner, side, or the middle of
the page.
✦Click the Position button, choose More Layout Options on the drop-
down list, and choose options on the Picture Position tab of the
Advanced Layout dialog box. Go to the Advanced Layout dialog box
when you want to place objects in the very same position on different
pages.

Working with the Drawing Canvas
237
An object you position with an option on the Position drop-down list
travels from page to page if you move the paragraph to which it’s connected.
This happens because when you insert an object, Word attaches it to the
paragraph where the cursor is located when you make the insertion. If you
move that paragraph to another page or the paragraph gets moved as you
edit text, the object moves right along with the paragraph. You can locate
the paragraph to which an object is connected by clicking the Show/Hide¶
button on the Home tab and then clicking the object; the anchor symbol
appears beside the paragraph that the object is connected to.
Working with the Drawing Canvas
As Book I, Chapter 8 explains, shapes and lines are a great way to illustrate
ideas. You can in effect doodle on the page and give readers another insight
into what you want to explain. In Word, however, drawing lines and shapes is
problematic unless you draw them on the drawing canvas. The drawing canvas
works like a corral to hold lines and shapes. After you create a drawing
canvas, you can draw inside it as though you were drawing on a little page,
as shown in Figure 4-4. Then you can treat the drawing canvas as an object
in its own right and move it — and the things inside it — to new locations.
You can also, by way of the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, give the drawing
canvas an outline shape and fill color. The drawing canvas makes working
with objects on a page, especially lines and shapes, that much easier.
Select the object.
Choose a With Text Wrapping option.
Figure 4-3:

Choosing a Theme for Your Document
238
Follow these steps to create a drawing canvas for holding lines and shapes:
1. Place the cursor roughly where you want the drawing canvas to be.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Shapes button and choose New Drawing Canvas.
You can find the New Drawing Canvas command at the bottom of the
Shapes drop-down list. A drawing canvas appears on your screen.
The drawing canvas is an object in its own right. You can wrap text around
it, give it an outline, and give it a color fill. You can drag it to a new location.
To change its size, drag a handle on the side or corner.
Choosing a Theme for Your Document
When you installed Word on your computer, you also installed a dozen or
more themes. A theme is a colorful, ready-made design for headings and text.
Each theme imposes a slightly different look on a document. If you want to
experiment with themes, more power to you; but be prepared to click the
Undo button and backtrack as you rummage around for the right one. In my
experience, themes are more suitable to Web pages than to Word documents
that you intend to print. They apply too much color into documents.
Starting on the Page Layout tab, follow these instructions to experiment with
themes:
✦Choosing a new theme: Click the Themes button and choose a theme on
the drop-down list.

✦Choosing a new set of colors for your theme: Click the Theme Colors
button, slide the pointer over the different color sets on the drop-down
list, and see what effect they have on your document.
✦Changing the fonts: Click the Theme Fonts button and choose a combi-
nation of fonts on the drop-down list for the headings and text in your
document.
✦Changing theme effects: Click the Theme Effects button and choose a
theme effect on the drop-down list. A theme effect is a slight refinement
to a theme.
Putting Newspaper-Style Columns in a Document
Columns look great in newsletters and similar documents. And you can pack
a lot of words in columns. I should warn you, however, that the Columns
command is only good for creating columns that appear on the same page.
Running text to the next page with the Columns command can be problematic.
If you’re serious about running text in columns, I suggest either constructing
the columns from text boxes or using Publisher, another Office program.
Book VII explains Publisher.
Before you put text in newspaper-style columns, write it. Take care of the
spelling, grammar, and everything else first because making text changes to
words after they’ve been arranged in columns is difficult. Columns appear
only in Print Layout view.
Sometimes it is easier to create columns by creating a table or by using text
boxes, especially when the columns refer to one another. In a two-column
résumé, for example, the left-hand column often lists job titles (“Facsimile
Engineer”) whose descriptions are found directly across the page in the
right-hand column (“I Xeroxed stuff all day long”). Creating a two-column
résumé with Word’s Columns command would be futile because making the
columns line up is nearly impossible. Each time you add something to the
left-hand column, everything snakes — it gets bumped down in the left-hand
column and the right-hand column as well.
To “columnize” text, select it, go to the Page Layout tab, and click the
Columns button. Then either choose how many columns you want on the
drop-down list, or choose More Columns to create columns of different
widths. You see the Columns dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-5. Here are the
options in the Columns dialog box:

Putting Newspaper-Style Columns in a Document
240
✦Preset columns: Select a Presets box to choose a preset number of
columns. Notice that, in some of the boxes, the columns aren’t of equal
width.
✦Number of columns: If a preset column doesn’t do the trick, enter the
number of columns you want in the Number of Columns box.
✦Line between columns: A line between columns is mighty elegant and is
difficult to do on your own. Select the Line Between check box to run
lines between columns.
✦Columns width: If you deselect the Equal Column Width check box, you
can make columns of unequal width. Change the width of each column
by using the Width boxes.
✦Space between columns: Enter a measurement in the Spacing boxes to
determine how much space appears between columns.
✦Start New Column: This box is for putting empty space in a column, per-
haps to insert a text box or picture. Place the cursor where you want the
empty space to begin, open the Columns dialog box, choose This Point
Forward on the Apply To drop-down list, and click the Start New Column
check box. Text below the cursor moves to the next column.
Word creates a new section if you selected text before you columnized it,
and you see your columns in Print Layout view. Chapter 2 of this mini-book
explains sections.
To “break” a column in the middle and move text to the next column, click
where you want the column to break and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter or click
the Breaks button on the Page Layout tab and choose Column on the drop-
down list.

Working with Text Boxes
241
Working with Text Boxes
Put text in a text box when you want a notice or announcement to stand out
on the page. Text boxes can be shaded, filled with color, and given borders,
as the examples in Figure 4-6 demonstrate. You can also lay them over graph-
ics to make for interesting effects. I removed the borders and the fill color
from the text box on the right side of Figure 4-6, but rest assured, the text in
this figure lies squarely in a text box.
You can move a text box around at will on the page until it lands in the right
place. You can even use text boxes as columns and make text jump from one
text box to the next in a document — a nice feature, for example, when you
want a newsletter article on page 1 to be continued on page 2. Instead of cut-
ting and pasting text from page 1 to page 2, Word moves the text for you as
the column on page 1 fills up. (Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to give bor-
ders, shading, and color to objects such as text boxes.)
Inserting a text box
To draw a text box, go to the Insert tab, click the Text Box button, and use
one of these techniques:
✦Choose a ready-made text box: Scroll in the drop-down list and choose
a preformatted text box.
✦Draw a conventional text box: Choose Draw Text Box on the drop-down
list, and then click and drag to draw the text box. Lines show you how
big it will be when you release the mouse button.
✦Draw a “vertical” text box: Choose Draw Vertical Text Box on the 
drop-down list and then drag on the page to draw the box. In a vertical
text box, text reads from top to bottom or bottom to top, not from left
to right. You can always change the direction of text in a text box by
clicking in the box and then clicking the Text Direction button on the
(Text Box Tools) Format menu. Keep clicking the button until the text
lands where you want it to land.
Figure 4-6:
Examples of
text boxes.

Decorating a Page with a Border
242
After you’ve inserted the text box, you can type text in it and call on all the
formatting commands on the (Text Box Tools) Format tab. These commands
are explained in Book I, Chapter 8.
Book I, Chapter 8 also describes how to turn a shape such as a circle or tri-
angle into a text box (create the shape, right-click it and choose Add Text,
and start typing).
Making text flow from text box to text box
As I mention earlier, you can link text boxes so that the text in the first box is
pushed into the next one when it fills up. To link text boxes, start by creating
all the text boxes that you need. You cannot link one text box to another if
the second text box already has text in it. Starting on the (Text Box Tools)
Format tab, follow these directions to link text boxes:
✦Creating a forward link: Click a text box and then click the Create Link
button to create a forward link. When you click the button, the pointer
changes into a very odd-looking pointer that is supposed to look like a
pitcher. Move the odd-looking pointer to the next text box in the chain
and click there to create a link.
✦Breaking a link: To break a link, click the text box that is to be the last
in the chain and then click the Break Link button.
Decorating a Page with a Border
Word offers a means of decorating title pages, certificates, menus, and simi-
lar documents with a page border. Besides lines, you can decorate the sides
of a page with stars, pieces of cake, and other artwork. If you want to place a
border around a page in the middle of the document, you must create a sec-
tion break where the page is.
Before you create your border, place the cursor on the page where the
border is to appear. Place the cursor on the first page of a document if you
want to put a border around only the first page. If your document is divided
into sections and you want to put borders around certain pages in a section,
place the cursor in the section — either in the first page, if you want the bor-
ders to go around it, or in a subsequent page.
With the cursor in the right place, follow these steps to decorate your page
or pages with a border:
1. Go to the Page Layout tab and click the Page Borders button.
You see the Borders and Shading dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-7.

Book II
Chapter 4

243
2. Under Setting, choose which kind of border you want.
The Custom setting is for putting borders on one, two, or three sides of
the page, not four. Use the None setting to remove borders.
3. Under Apply To, tell Word which page or pages in the document get
borders.
4. Select options to construct the border you want and then click OK.
The Page Border tab offers a bunch of tools for fashioning a border:
✦Line for borders: Under Style, scroll down the list and choose a line for
the borders. You find interesting choices at the bottom of the menu.
Be sure to look in the Preview window to see what your choices in this
dialog box add up to.
✦Color for borders: Open the Color drop-down list and choose a color for
the border lines if you want a color border.
✦Width of borders: If you chose artwork for the borders, use the Width
drop-down list to tell Word how wide the lines or artwork should be.
✦Artwork for borders: Open the Art drop-down list and choose a symbol,
illustration, star, piece of cake, or other artwork, if that is what you want
for the borders. You find some amusing choices on this long list, including
ice cream cones, bats, and umbrellas.
✦Borders on different sides of the page: Use the four buttons in the
Preview window to tell Word on which sides of the page you want bor-
ders. Click these buttons to remove or add borders, as you wish.
✦Distance from edge of page: Click the Options button and fill in the
Border and Shading Options dialog box if you want to get specific about
how close the borders can come to the edge of the page or pages.

Dropping In a Drop Cap
244
Dropping In a Drop Cap
A drop cap is a large capital letter that “drops” into the text, as shown in
Figure 4-8. Drop caps appear at the start of chapters in many books, this
book included, and you can find other uses for them, too. In Figure 4-8, one
drop cap marks the A side of a list of songs on a homemade cassette tape.
To create a drop cap, start by clicking anywhere in the paragraph whose first
letter you want to “drop.” To create a standard drop-cap with the dropped
letter in the same font as the other text in the paragraph, go to the Insert
tab, click the Drop Cap button, and choose Dropped on the drop-down list.
Otherwise, choose Drop Cap Options to display the Drop Cap dialog box, as
shown in Figure 4-8. It offers these options:
✦Position: Choose which kind of drop-cap you want. In Margin places the
drop-cap to the left of the paragraph, in the margin, not in the paragraph
itself.
✦Font: Choose a font from the Font drop-down list. Choose one that’s dif-
ferent from the text in the paragraph.
✦Lines to Drop: Enter the number of text lines that the letter should
drop on.
✦Distance from Text: Keep the 0 setting in unless you’re dropping an I, 1,
or other skinny letter or number.
You see your drop cap in Print Layout view. The drop cap appears in a text
frame. You can drop more than one letter by selecting more than one charac-
ter before you click the Drop Cap button.

Watermarking for the Elegant Effect
245
Watermarking for the Elegant Effect
A watermark is a pale image or set of words that appears behind text on each
page in a document. True watermarks are made in the paper mold and can
be seen only when the sheet of paper is held up to a light. You can’t make
true watermarks with Word, but you can make the closest thing to them that
can be attained in the debased digital world in which we live. Figure 4-9
shows two pages of a letter in which the paper has been “watermarked.”
Watermarks are one of the easiest formatting tricks to accomplish in Word.
To create a watermark for every page of a document, start by clicking the
Watermark button on the Page Layout tab. From the drop-down list that
appears, you can create a prefabricated, picture, or text watermark:
✦Prefabricated watermark: Scroll down the list and choose an option.
You find Confidential, Urgent, and other text watermarks.
✦Picture watermark: Choose Custom Watermark, and in the Printed
Watermark dialog box, click the Picture Watermark option button.
Then click the Select Picture button. In the Insert Picture dialog box,
select a file to use for the watermark and click the Insert button. Back in
the Printed Watermark dialog box, choose a size for the clip-art image
from the Scale drop-down list. I don’t recommend deselecting the Washout
check box — do so and your image may be so dark it obscures the text.
✦Text watermark: Choose Custom Watermarks, and in the Printed
Watermark dialog box, click the Text Watermark option button. Type a
word or two in the Text box (or choose an entry from the drop-down list).
Choose a font, size, color, and layout for the words. If you deselect the
Semitransparent check box, you do so at your peril because the water-
mark words may be too dark on the page.
Figure 4-9:
Watermarks

Landscape Documents
246
To tinker with a watermark, reopen the Printed Watermark dialog box. To
remove the watermark, click the Watermark button and choose Remove
Watermark on the drop-down list.
Landscape Documents
A landscape document is one in which the page is wider than it is long, 
like a painting of a landscape, as shown on the right side of Figure 4-10.
Most documents, like the pages of this book, are printed in portrait style,
with the short sides of the page on the top and bottom. However, creating
a landscape document is sometimes a good idea because a landscape docu-
ment stands out from the usual crowd of portrait documents and sometimes
printing in landscape mode is necessary to fit text, tables, and graphics on
a single page. Create a new section for your landscape page if you want to
place it in a document of portrait pages (Chapter 2 of this mini-book explains
sections).
To turn the page on its ear and create a landscape document, follow these
steps:
1. On the Page Layout tab, click the Page Setup group button.
You see the Page Setup dialog box.
2. Select the Margins tab.
3. In the Orientation area, click the Landscape button.

4. In the Apply To box, choose Whole Document to print landscape pages
throughout your document, This Section to print only the section the
cursor is in, or This Point Forward to make the rest of the pages in the
document landscape pages.
5. Click OK.
Printing on Different Size Paper
You don’t have to print exclusively on standard 8.5 x 11 paper; you can print
on legal-size paper and other sizes of paper as well. A ’zine or newsletter with
an unusual shape really stands out in a crowd and gets people’s attention.
To change the size of the paper on which you intend to print a document, go
the Page Layout tab, click the Page Setup group button, select the Paper tab
in the Page Setup dialog box, and choose a setting on the Paper Size drop-
down list. If none of the settings suits you, enter your own settings in the
Width and Height text boxes.
If you keep legal-size paper in one tray of your printer and standard-size
paper in another, for example, select the Paper tab in the Page Setup dialog
box and choose Upper Tray or Lower Tray on the First Page and Other Pages
list boxes.

T
his chapter is dedicated to the proposition that everyone should get 
his or her work done sooner. It explains how Word can be a help in the
office, especially when it comes to working on team projects. This chapter
explains comments, using revision marks to record edits, and mail merging,
Microsoft’s term for generating form letters, labels, and envelopes for mass
mailings.
Book VIII, Chapter 6 explains another way to collaborate on team projects —
by working online at a SharePoint Team Services Web site.
Highlighting Parts of a Document
In my work, I often use the Highlight command to mark paragraphs and text
that need reviewing later. And on rainy days, I use it to splash color on my
documents and keep myself amused. Whatever your reasons for highlight-
ing text in a document, go to the Home tab and use one of these techniques
to do it:
✦Select text and then choose a highlighter: Select the text you want to
highlight, and then either click the Text Highlight Color button (if it’s
displaying your color choice) or open the drop-down list on the button
and choose a color.
✦Choose a highlighter and then select text: Either click the Text Highlight
Color button (if it’s already displaying your color choice) or open the
drop-down list on the button and choose a color. The pointer changes
into a crayon. Drag across the text you want to highlight. When you’re
finished highlighting, click the Text Highlight Color button again or
press Esc.

Commenting on a Document
250
Highlight marks are printed along with the text. To temporarily remove the
highlights in a document, click the Office button and choose Word Options,
click the Display category in the Word Options dialog box, and deselect the
Show Highlighter Marks check box. To permanently remove highlights, select
the document or the text from which you want to remove the highlights, open
the drop-down list on the Text Highlight Color button, and choose No Color.
Commenting on a Document
In the old days, comments were scribbled illegibly in the margins of books
and documents, but in Word, comments are easy to read. To show where a
comment has been made on the text, Word puts brackets around text and
highlights the text. Each commenter is assigned a different highlighting color
so you can tell at a glance who made each comment. As shown in Figure 5-1,
you can read a comment in Draft view and Outline view by moving the pointer
over highlighted text and reading the pop-up box; in Print Layout view and
Web Layout view, comments appear in balloons on the right side of the text,
as shown in Figure 5-1.
Entering a comment
If you’re putting together a proposal, you can pass it around the office and
invite everyone to comment. If someone makes an especially good comment,
you can include it in the main text merely by copying and pasting it. To write
a comment:
1. Select the word or sentence that you want to criticize or praise.
2. On the Review tab, click the New Comment button.
In Draft and Outline view, the Reviewing pane opens on the left side or
bottom of the screen so you can enter a comment; in Print Layout and
Web Layout view, a new balloon appears on the right side of the screen
Figure 5-1:

so you can enter a comment. (Click the Reviewing Pane button on the
Review tab and choose an option to place the pane on the left side or
bottom of the screen.)
3. Type your comment in the space provided.
In Draft and Outline view, Word lists your initials, and a number appears
beside your comment. If the wrong initials appear, click the Track Changes
button, choose Change User Name, and enter your correct name and ini-
tials in the Word Options dialog box.
Caring for and feeding comments
Starting on the Review tab, here is a handful of tasks that deserve comment
(if you’ll pardon my little pun):
✦Going from comment to comment: Click the Previous or Next button on 
the Review tab. In Draft and Outline view, the Reviewing pane opens, and 
you can read the comment you landed on at the top of the pane. In Print 
Layout and Web Layout view, balloons on the right side of the screen are 
highlighted as you go from comment to comment.
✦Seeing and hiding the Reviewing pane: Click the Reviewing Pane
button to display or hide the Reviewing pane. On the button’s drop-
down list, choose an option to put the pane on the left side or bottom 
of the screen.
✦Temporarily removing the comments: Click the Show Markup button
and deselect Comments on the drop-down list to wipe away the com-
ments; select Comments to see them again.
✦Displaying comments by a particular reviewer: Click the Show Markup
button, choose Reviewers, and deselect All Reviewers on the submenu.
Then click the button again, choose Reviewers, and choose the name of
a reviewer. To see all comments again, click the Show Markup button
and choose Reviewers➪All Reviewers.
✦Deleting a comment: Click between brackets or click a comment balloon
and then click the Delete Comment button. You can also right-click between
brackets or right-click a comment balloon and choose Delete Comment
on the shortcut menu.
✦Deleting all the comments in the document: Click between brackets or
click a comment balloon, open the drop-down list on the Delete Comment
button, choose Delete All Comments in Document.
✦Deleting comments made by one or two people: First, isolate comments
made by people whose comments you want to delete (see “Displaying
comments by a particular reviewer” earlier in this list). Then open the
drop-down list on the Delete Comment button and choose Delete All
Comments Shown.

Tracking Revisions to Documents
252
✦Editing a comment: Right-click between the brackets and choose Edit
Comment or just click in the comment in Print Layout view. Then rewrite
the comment in the Reviewing pane (in Draft view) or rewrite it in the
balloon (in Print Layout view).
Tracking Revisions to Documents
When many hands go into revising a document, figuring out who made revi-
sions to what is impossible. And more important, it’s impossible to tell what
the first draft looked like. Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether the revision
work was for good or ill.
To help you keep track of changes to documents, Word offers the Track
Changes command. When this command is in effect, all changes to a docu-
ment are recorded in a different color, with one color for each reviewer. In
Draft view, new text is underlined, a vertical line appears in the margin to
show where changes were made, and text that has been deleted is crossed
out. In Print Layout view, new text is underlined, and deleted text appears in
balloons on the right side of the window. By moving the pointer over a change,
you can read the name of the person who made it as well as the words that
were inserted or deleted. You can see changes as well in the Reviewing pane.
As you review changes, you can accept or reject each change. You can also
see the original document, a copy with revisions, or the final copy simply by
making a choice from a drop-down list.
Letting the air out of the balloons
In Print Layout and Web Layout view,
comments and revisions appear in bal-
loons on the right side of the screen.
Sometimes seeing revisions and comments in
balloons is helpful; sometimes it’s hard to make
sense of them when they’re so far to the side of
the page.
To quickly hide or display balloons in Print
Layout and Web Layout view, you can click the
Balloons button on the Review tab (you may
have to click the Tracking button first) and
choose an option on the drop-down list:
 Show Revisions in Balloons displays the
balloons.
 Show All Revisions Inline moves comments
and revisions onto the page and effectively
lets all the air out of the balloons.
 Show Only Comments and Formatting in
Balloons shows comments only, not revi-
sion marks.

To give you an idea of what tracking marks look like, Figure 5-2 shows the
first two sentences of Vladimir Nabokov’s autobiography Speak, Memory in
Draft view, with marks showing where additions were made and deletions
scratched out. (As well as crossing out deletions, you can make them appear
in balloons to the right of the text. See “Telling Word how to mark revisions”
later in this chapter.)
Telling Word to start marking revisions
To start tracking where editorial changes are made to a document, turn
Track Changes on. You can do that on the Review tab with one of these 
techniques:
✦Click the top portion of the Track Changes button (or click the bottom
portion and choose Track Changes on the drop-down list, or press
Ctrl+Shift+E). Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to
click the Tracking button first.
✦On the status bar, click the words Track Changes so that the status bar
reads, Track Changes: On. If you don’t see the words Track Changes on
your status bar, right-click the status bar and select Track Changes on
the pop-up list.
Telling Word how to mark revisions
To tell Word precisely how to mark revisions, open the drop-down list on the
Track Changes button (you may have to click the Tracking button first) and
choose Change Tracking Options. You see the Track Changes Options dialog
box. It offers these options:

✦Markup options: Declare how you want to mark insertions and deletions,
and with which color you want to mark them.
✦Moves options: Declare how you want to mark text that has been cut
and pasted.
✦Table and Highlighting options: When editing tables, you can mark
inserted, deleted, merged, and split cells in different colors.
✦Formatting options: Choose an option to mark formatting revisions as
well as revisions to text.
✦Balloons: Choose Always if you prefer to mark deleted text with bal-
loons to the right of the text in Print Layout and Web Layout view. If you
prefer not to see balloons in Print Layout and Web Layout view, choose
Never. You must display the balloons to examine revised documents in
Final Showing Markup and Original Showing Markup view (see the next
section in this chapter). Earlier in this chapter, “Letting the air out of the
balloons” explains how you can quickly hide or display balloons in Print
Layout and Web Layout view.
If your name isn’t appearing with the revision marks you make, go to the
Review tab, click the Track Changes button, choose Change User Name, and
enter your name and initials in the Word Options dialog box.
Reading and reviewing a document 
with revision marks
Reading and reviewing a document with revision marks isn’t easy. The revi-
sion marks can get in the way. Fortunately, Word offers the Display for Review
drop-down list on the Review tab for dealing with documents that have been
scarred by revision marks. Choose options on the Display for Review drop-
down list to get a better idea of how your revisions are taking shape:
✦See more clearly where text was deleted from the original document:
Choose Final Showing Markup. In Print Layout view, deleted material
appears in balloons on the right side of the screen and insertions are
underlined.
✦See what the document would look like if you accepted all revisions:
Choose Final. All revision marks are stripped away, and you see what
your document would look like if you accepted all revisions made to it.
✦See more clearly where text was inserted in the document: Choose
Original Showing Markup. In Print Layout view, insertions appear in bal-
loons on the right side of the screen and a line appears through text that
has been deleted.
✦See what the document would look like if you rejected all revisions:
Choose Original. You get the original, pristine document back.

Marking changes when you forgot 
to turn on revision marks
Suppose that you write the first draft of a document and someone revises it
but that someone doesn’t track revisions. How can you tell where revisions
were made? For that matter, suppose that you get hold of a document, you
change it around without turning on revision marks, and now you want to
see what your editorial revisions did to the original copy. I have good news:
You can compare documents to see what editorial changes were made to
them. Word offers a command for comparing the original document to a
revised edition and another for comparing two different revised editions of
the same document.
After you make the comparison, Word creates a third document similar to
the one shown in Figure 5-3. In the Source Document pane on the right side
of the window, you can see the documents you’re comparing. The Compared
Document pane, meanwhile, shows revision marks. Follow these steps to
compare an original document to its revised copy or two revised copies:
1. On the Review tab, click the Compare button.
You see a drop-down list (depending on the size of your screen, you may
have to choose Compare more than once to get to the drop-down list).
2. On the drop-down list, choose Compare to compare the original docu-
ment to its revised edition; choose Combine to compare two different
revised editions of the same document.
You see the Compare Documents dialog box or the Combine Documents
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-4. These dialog boxes work the same way.

3. On the Original Document drop-down list, choose the original or a
revised edition of the document; if its name isn’t there, click the
Browse button and select it in the Open dialog box.
4. On the Revised Document drop-down list, choose a revised copy, or
else click the Browse button and select it in the Open dialog box.
5. Click the More button.
You see more options for comparing or combining documents.
6. (Optional) Deselect the Comparison Settings check boxes to tell Word
what you want to compare.
7. Click OK.
Word creates a new document that shows where changes were made to
the original copy or where the revised copies differ (refer to Figure 5-3).
You can save this document if you want to.
Click the Show Source Documents button to tell Word what to display in the
Source Documents pane. On the drop-down list, choose an option to hide
the documents, show the original edition, show the revised edition, or show
both editions.
Accepting and rejecting revisions to a document
Word gives you the chance to accept or reject changes one at a time, but in
my considerable experience with revisions (I am a sometime editor), I find
that the best way to handle changes is to go through the document, reject the
changes you don’t care for, and when you have finished reviewing, accept all
the remaining changes. That way, reviewing changes is only half as tedious.

Whatever your preference for accepting or rejecting changes, start by 
selecting a revision. To do so, either click it or click the Previous or Next 
button on the Review tab to locate it in your document. With the revision 
selected, do one of the following:
✦Accept a revision: Click the Accept button or right-click and choose
Accept Change on the shortcut menu. Clicking Accept agrees to the revi-
sion and takes you to the next revision in the document.
✦Reject a revision: Click the Reject button or right-click and choose
Reject Change on the shortcut menu. Clicking Reject also takes you to
the next revision mark.
✦Accept all revisions: Open the drop-down list on the Accept button and
choose Accept All Changes in Document.
✦Reject all revisions: Open the drop-down list on the Reject button and
choose Reject All Changes in Document.
By way of the Accept and Reject buttons, you can also accept or reject all
changes made by a single reviewer. First, isolate the reviewer’s revisions 
by clicking the Show Markup button, choosing Reviewers, and selecting a
reviewer’s name. Then open the drop-down list on the Accept or Reject
button, and choose Accept All Changes Shown or Reject All Changes Shown.
Printing an Address on an Envelope
Printing addresses gives correspondence a formal, official look. It makes you
look like a big shot. (Later in this chapter, “Churning Out Letters, Labels, and
Envelopes for Mass Mailings” explains how to print more than one envelope at
a time.) Here’s how to print an address and a return address on an envelope:
1. To save a bit of time, open the document that holds the letter you
want to send; then select the name and address of the person
you want to send the letter to.
By doing so, you save yourself from having to type the address again.
However, you don’t have to open a document to start with.
2. On the Mailings tab, click the Envelopes button (you may have to click
the Create button first, depending on the size of your screen).
The Envelopes tab of the Envelopes and Labels dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 5-5.

3. Enter a name and address in the Delivery Address box (the address is
already there if you selected it in Step 1).
4. Enter your return address in the Return Address box.
Your name and address should appear in the Return Address box. (If they
aren’t there, enter them for now.)
5. Check the Omit check box if you don’t want your return address to
appear on the envelope.
6. Click the Print button.
Two commands on the Envelopes tab tell Word how your printer handles
envelopes and what size your envelopes are.
Click the envelope icon below the word Feed to open the Envelope Options
dialog box and choose the right technique for feeding envelopes to your
printer. Consult the manual that came with your printer, select one of the
Feed Method boxes, click the Face Up or Face Down option button, and open
the Feed From drop-down list to tell Word which printer tray the envelope is
in or how you intend to stick the envelope in your printer. Click OK when
you’re done.
After you’ve fed the envelope to your printer, click the envelope icon below
the word Preview — that’s right, click the icon — to tell Word what size your
envelopes are and whether you want to print bar codes on the envelope.

Printing a Single Address Label (or a Page of the Same Label)
259
Printing a Single Address Label 
(or a Page of the Same Label)
You can print a single label or a sheet of labels that are all the same. Before
you start printing, however, note what the size and brand your labels are.
You are asked about label brands and sizes when you print labels. (Later in
this chapter, “Churning Out Letters, Labels, and Envelopes for Mass Mailings”
explains how to print multiple labels as part of a mass mailing.)
Follow these steps to print a single label or a sheet full of identical labels:
1. On the Mailings tab, click the Labels button (you may have to click the
Create button first, depending on the size of your screen).
You see the Labels tab of the Envelopes and Labels dialog box, as shown
in Figure 5-6.
2. Enter the label — the name and address — in the Address box.
3. Either click the Options button or click the label icon in the Label box
to see the Label Options dialog box appear.
4. In the Printer Information area, select either Continuous-Feed Printers
or Page Printers to state which kind of printer you have; on the Tray
drop-down list, choose the option that describes how you will feed
labels to your printer.
Figure 5-6:
Printing

5. Open the Label Vendors drop-down list and choose the brand or type
of labels that you have.
If your brand is not on the list, click the Details button and describe
your labels in the extremely confusing Other Label Information dialog
box. A better way, however, is to measure your labels and see whether
you can find a label of the same size by experimenting with Product
Number and Label Information combinations.
6. In the Product Number menu, select the product number listed on the
box that your labels came in.
Look in the Label Information box on the right to make sure that the
Height, Width, and Page Size measurements match those of the labels
you have.
7. Click OK to return to the Envelopes and Labels dialog box.
8. Choose a Print option.
Tell Word whether you’re printing a single label or a sheet full of labels:
• Full Page of the Same Label: Select this option button if you want to
print a page full of the same label. Likely, you’d choose this option 
to print a page full of your own return addresses. Click the New
Document button after you make this choice. Word creates a new
document with a page full of labels. Save and print this document.
• Single Label: Select this option button to print one label. Then enter
the row and column where the label is located and click the Print
button.
Churning Out Letters, Labels, and 
Envelopes for Mass Mailings
Thanks to the miracle of computing, you can churn out form letters, labels,
and envelopes for a mass mailing in the privacy of your home or office, just
as the big companies do. Churning out form letters, labels, and envelopes is
easy, as long as you take the time to prepare the source file. The source file
is the file that the names and addresses come from. A Word table, an Excel
worksheet, a Microsoft Access database table or query, or an Outlook Contacts
list or Address Book can serve as the source file. (Book III explains Outlook;
Book V explains Excel; Book VI explains Access.)
To generate form letters, labels, or envelopes, you merge the source file with
a form letter, label, or envelope document. Word calls this process merging.
During the merge, names and addresses from the source file are plugged into

Book II
Chapter 5
Getting Word’s Help
with Office Chores
Churning Out Letters, Labels, and Envelopes for Mass Mailings
261
the appropriate places in the form letter, label, or envelope document. When
the merge is complete, you can either save the form letters, labels, or
envelopes in a new file or start printing right away.
The following text explains how to prepare the source file and merge addresses
from the source file with a document to create form letters, labels, or envelopes.
Then I explain how to print the form letters, labels, or envelopes.
Preparing the source file
If you intend to get addresses for your form letters, labels, or envelopes from
an Outlook Contact List or Address Book on your computer, you’re ready to
go. However, if you haven’t entered the addresses yet or you’re keeping
them in a Word table, Excel worksheet, Access database table, or Access
query, make sure that the data is in good working order:
✦Word table: Save the table in its own file and enter a descriptive heading
at the top of each column. In the merge, when you tell Word where to
plug in addresses and other data, you will do so by choosing a heading
name from the top of a column. In Figure 5-7, for example, the column
headings are Last Name, First Name, Street, and so on. (Book I, Chapter 5
explains how to construct a Word table.)
✦Excel worksheet: Arrange the worksheet in table format with a descrip-
tive heading atop each column and no blank cells in any columns. Word
plugs in addresses and other data by choosing heading names.
✦Access database table or query: Make sure that you know the field
names in the database table or query where you keep the addresses.
During the merge, you’re asked for field names. By the way, if you’re
comfortable in Access, query a database table for the records you will
need. As you find out shortly, Word offers a technique for choosing only
the records you want for your form letters, labels, or envelopes.
However, by querying first in Access, you can start off with the records
you need and spare yourself from having to choose records in Word.
Figure 5-7:

262
A Word table, Excel worksheet, or Access table or query can include more
than address information. Don’t worry about deleting information that isn’t
required for form letters, labels, and envelopes. As you find out soon, you
get to decide which information to include from the table or query.
Merging the source file with the document
The next step in generating form letters, labels, or envelopes for a mass mail-
ing is to merge the source file with the document. Follow these general steps
to do so:
1. Open a new document if you want to print labels or envelopes en
masse; if you want to print form letters, either open a new document
or open a letter you have already written and delete the addressee’s
name, the address, and other parts of the letter that differ from recipi-
ent to recipient.
2. On the Mailings tab, click the Start Mail Merge button.
3. Choose Letters, Envelopes, or Labels on the drop-down list.
4. Prepare the groundwork for creating form letters, labels, or
envelopes for a mass mailing.
What you do next depends on what kind of article you’re dealing with:
• Form letters: You’re ready to go. The text of your form letter already
appears on-screen if you followed the directions for opening it or
writing it in Step 1.
• Labels: You see the Label Options dialog box, where you tell Word
what size labels to print on. See “Printing a Single Address Label (or
a Page of the Same Label)” earlier in this chapter, if you need advice
for filling out this dialog box.
• Envelopes: You see the Envelope Options dialog box, where, on the
Envelope Options and Printing Options tabs, you tell Word what size
envelope you will print on. See “Printing an Address on an Envelope,”
earlier in this chapter, for instructions about filling out these tabs.
A sample envelope appears on-screen.
5. Click the Select Recipients button and choose an option on the drop-
down list to direct Word to your source file or the source of your
address and data information.
Earlier in this chapter, “Preparing the source file” explains what a source
file is. Your options are as follows:
• Addresses from a Word table, Excel worksheet, Access database table, or
Access query: Choose Use Existing List. You see the Select Data Source
dialog box. Locate the Word file or Excel worksheet with the table or
the Access database with the table or query, select it, and click OK.

Book II
Chapter 5

Churning Out Letters, Labels, and Envelopes for Mass Mailings
263
If you select an Access database, you see the Select Table dialog box.
Select the table or query you want and click OK.
• Addresses from Microsoft Outlook: Choose Select from Outlook
Contacts (Outlook must be your default e-mail program to get
addresses from Outlook). Then, in the Select Contact dialog box,
choose Contacts and click OK.
6. Click the Edit Recipient List button.
The Mail Merge Recipients dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-8.
7. In the Mail Merge Recipients dialog box, select the names of people to
whom you will send mail; then click OK.
To select recipients’ names, select or deselect the boxes on the left side
of the dialog box.
8. Enter the address block on your form letters, labels, or envelopes.
The address block is the address, including the recipient’s name, com-
pany, title, street address, city, and ZIP Code. If you’re creating form let-
ters, click in the sample letter where the address block will go. If you’re
printing on envelopes, click in the middle of the envelope where the
delivery address will go. Then follow these steps to enter the address
block:
a. Click the Address Block button. The Insert Address Block dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Choose the names of recipients.
Figure 5-8:
Choosing
which

264
b. Choose a format for entering the recipient’s name in the address
block. As you do so, watch the Preview window; it shows the actual
names and addresses that you selected in Step 7.
c. Click the Match Fields button. You see the Match Fields dialog box,
shown in Figure 5-9.
d. Using the drop-down lists on the right side of the dialog box, match
the fields in your source file with the address block fields on the left
side of the dialog box. In Figure 5-9, for example, the Street field is
the equivalent of the Address 1 field on the left side of the dialog box,
so Street is chosen from the drop-down list.
e. Click OK in the Match Fields dialog box and the Insert Address Block
dialog box. The <<AddressBlock>> field appears in the document
where the address will go. Later, when you merge your document
with the data source, real data will appear where the field is now.
Think of a field as a kind of placeholder for data.
9. Click the Preview Results button on the Mailings tab to see real data
rather than fields.
Now you can see clearly whether you entered the address block cor-
rectly. If you didn’t enter it correctly, click the Match Fields button (it’s
in the Write & Insert Fields group) to open the Match Fields dialog box
and make new choices.
10. Put the finishing touches on your form letters, labels, or envelopes:
• Form letters: Click where the salutation (“Dear John”) will go and then
click the Greeting Line button. You see the Insert Greeting Line dialog
box, as shown in Figure 5-10. Make choices in this dialog box to deter-
mine how the letters’ salutations will read.

The body of your form letter may well include other variable infor-
mation such as names and birthdays. To enter that stuff, click where
variable information goes and then click the Insert Merge Field
button. The Insert Merge Field dialog box appears and lists fields
from the source file. Select a field, click the Insert button, and click
the Close button.
If you’re editing your form letter and you need to see precisely where
the variable information you entered is located, click the Highlight
Merge Fields button. The variable information is highlighted in your
document.
• Labels: Click the Update Labels button to enter all recipients’ labels
in the sample document.
• Envelopes: If you don’t like the fonts or font sizes on the envelope,
select an address and change fonts and font sizes on the Home tab.
To enter a return address, click in the upper-left corner of the enve-
lope and enter it there.
11. Click the Next Record and Previous Record buttons on the Mailings
tab to skip from recipient to recipient and make sure that you have
entered information correctly.
The items you see on-screen are the same form letters, envelopes, or
labels you will see when you have finished printing. (Click the Preview
Results button if you see field names rather than people’s names and
addresses.)
If an item is incorrect, open the source file and correct it there. When you
save the source file, the correction is made in the sample document.
At last — you’re ready to print the form letters, labels, or envelopes. Better
keep reading.

Printing form letters, labels, and envelopes
After you’ve gone to the trouble to prepare the data file and merge it with
the document, you’re ready to print your form letters, labels, or envelopes.
Start by loading paper, sheets of labels, or envelopes in your printer:
✦Form letters: Form letters are easiest to print. Just put the paper in the
printer.
✦Labels: Load the label sheets in your printer.
✦Envelopes: Not all printers are capable of printing envelopes one after
the other. Sorry, but you probably have to consult the dreary manual that
came with your printer to find out the correct way to load envelopes.
Now, to print the form letters, labels, or envelopes, save the material in a
new document or send it straight to the printer:
✦Saving in a new document: Click the Finish & Merge button and choose
Edit Individual Documents (or press Alt+Shift+N). You see the Merge to
New Document dialog box. Click OK. After Word creates the document,
save it and print it. You can go into the document and make changes
here and there before printing. In form letters, for example, you can
write a sentence or two in different letters to personalize them.
✦Printing right away: Click the Finish & Merge button and choose Print
Documents (or press Alt+Shift+M) to print the form letters, labels, or
envelopes without saving them in a document. Click OK in the Merge to
Printer dialog box and then negotiate the Print dialog box.

T
his chapter is hereby dedicated to everyone who has had to delve into
the unknown and write a report about it. Writing reports, manuals, and
scholarly papers is not easy. You have to explore uncharted territory. You
have to contemplate the ineffable. And you have to write bibliographies and
footnotes and maybe an index, too. Word cannot take you directly to uncharted
territory, but it can take some of the sting out of it.
This chapter explains how to handle footnotes and endnotes, generate a
table of contents, index a document, include cross-references in documents,
and stitch together a bibliography.
Alphabetizing a List
Which comes first in an alphabetical list, “San Jose, California” or “San José,
Costa Rica”? You could research the matter on your own, delving into vari-
ous dictionaries and online references, or you could rely on the Sort button
for the answer. Follow these steps to quickly alphabetize a list:
1. Select the list.
2. On the Home page, click the Sort button.
You see the Sort Text dialog box. The Then By options are for sorting
tables; they don’t concern you, because you’re sorting a list.
3. Click OK.
That was easy.

Outlines for Organizing Your Work
268
Outlines for Organizing Your Work
Outline view is a great way to see at a glance how your document is organ-
ized and whether you need to organize it differently. To take advantage of
this feature, you must have assigned heading levels to the headings in your
document (Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains styles). In Outline view, you
can see all the headings in your document. If a section is in the wrong place,
you can move it simply by dragging an icon or by clicking one of the buttons
on the Outlining tab. To change the rank of a heading, simply click a button
to promote or demote it.
To switch to Outline view, click the Outline button on the View tab or click
the Outline button on the status bar. You see the Outlining tab, as shown in
Figure 6-1. Rather than see text, you see the headings in your document, as
well as the first line underneath each heading. Now you get a sense of what
is in your document and whether it is organized well. By choosing an option
from the Show Level drop-down list, you can decide which headings to see
on-screen.
To leave Outline view when you’re done reorganizing your document, click
the Close Outline View button or a view button apart from Outline on the
status bar.
Choose which headings to see.

Viewing your document in different ways
Before you start rearranging your document in Outline view, get a good look
at it by taking advantage of buttons and drop-down lists on the Outlining tab:
✦View some or all headings: Choose an option from the Show Level drop-
down list. To see only first-level headings, for example, choose Level 1.
To see first-, second-, and third-level headings, choose Level 3. Choose
All Levels to see all the headings.
✦View heading formats: Click the Show Text Formatting check box. When
this check box is selected, you can see how headings were formatted
and get a better idea of their ranking in your document.
✦View or hide the subheadings in one section: To see or hide the sub-
headings and text in one section of a document, select that section by
clicking the plus sign beside its heading; then click the Expand button
(or press Alt+Shift+plus sign) to see the subheadings, or click the Collapse
button (or press Alt+Shift+minus sign) to hide the subheadings. You can
also double-click the plus sign beside a heading to view or hide all its
subheadings.
✦View or hide paragraph text: Click the Show First Line Only check box
(or press Alt+Shift+L). When this button is selected, you see only the
first line in each paragraph. First lines are followed by an ellipsis (. . .) 
so you know that more text follows.
Notice the plus and minus icons next to the headings and the text. A plus
icon means that the item has subheadings and text under it. For example,
headings almost always have plus icons because text comes after them. A
minus icon means that nothing is found below the item in question. For
example, body text usually has a minus icon because body text is lowest 
on the Outline totem pole.
Rearranging document sections in Outline view
Outline view is mighty convenient for moving sections in a document and for
promoting and demoting sections. Use these techniques to rearrange and
reorganize your document:
✦Move a section: To move a section up or down in the document, select 
it and click the Move Up or Move Down button (or press Alt+Shift+↑or
Alt+Shift+↓). You can also drag the plus sign to a new location. If you
want to move the subheadings and subordinate text along with the sec-
tion, be sure to click the Collapse button to tuck all the subheadings and
subtext into the heading before you move it.

270
✦Promote and demote headings: Click the heading and then click the
Promote button or Demote button. For example, you can promote a
Level 3 heading to Level 2 by clicking the Promote button. Click the
Promote to Heading 1 button to promote any heading to a first-level
heading; click the Demote to Body Text button to turn a heading into
prose.
✦Choose a new level for a heading: Click the heading and choose a new
heading level from the Outline Level drop-down list.
Generating a Table of Contents
A book-size document isn’t worth very much without a table of contents
(TOC). How else can readers find what they’re looking for? Generating a
table of contents with Word is easy, as long as you give the headings in the
document different styles — Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on (Chapter 3 of
this mini-book explains styles). The beautiful thing about Word TOCs is the
way they can be updated nearly instantly. If you add a new heading or erase
a heading, you can update the TOC with a snap of your fingers. Moreover,
you can quickly go from a TOC entry to its corresponding heading in a docu-
ment by Ctrl+clicking the entry.
Before you create your TOC, create a new section in which to put it and
number the pages in the new section with Roman numerals (Chapter 2 of
this mini-book explains sections and how to number pages). TOCs, including
the TOC in this book, are usually numbered in this way. The first entry in the
TOC should cite page number 1. If you don’t take my advice and create a new
section, the TOC will occupy the first few numbered pages of your document,
and the numbering scheme will be thrown off.
Creating a TOC
To create a table of contents:
1. Place the cursor where you want the TOC to go.
2. On the References tab, click the Table of Contents button and choose
Insert Table of Contents on the drop-down list.
You see the Table of Contents dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-2.
3. Choose options to declare which headings you want for your TOC and
how you want to format it.

Book II
Chapter 6
Tools for Reports
and Scholarly
Papers
Generating a Table of Contents
271
Your options are as follows:
• Showing page numbers: Deselect the Show Page Numbers box if you
want your TOC to be a simple list that doesn’t refer to headings
by page.
• Aligning the page numbers: Select the Right Align Page Numbers
check box if you want page numbers to line up along the right side 
of the TOC so that the ones and tens line up under each other.
• Choosing a tab leader: A leader is the punctuation mark that appears
between the heading and the page number the heading is on. If you
don’t want periods as the leader, choose another leader or choose
(None).
• Choosing a format: Choose a format from the Formats drop-down list
if you don’t care to use the one from the template. Just be sure to
watch the Print Preview and Web Preview boxes to see the results 
of your choice.
• Choosing a TOC depth: The Show Levels box determines how many
heading levels are included in the TOC. Unless your document is a
legal contract or other formal paper, enter a 2 or 3 here. A TOC is
supposed to help readers find information quickly. Including lots of
headings that take a long time to read through defeats the purpose of
having a TOC.
4. Click OK to generate your TOC.
Figure 6-2:

Generating a Table of Contents
272
Suppose that you want to copy a TOC to another document? It can be done,
but you have to regenerate your TOC after you copy it. To copy a TOC, drag
the pointer down its left margin to select it and then press Ctrl+Shift+F9.
Now you can successfully copy and paste the TOC to another document or
location. Because Word gives the text of TOCs the Hyperlink character style,
you have to change the color of the text in the TOC (it’s blue) and remove
the underlines. As for the original TOC, you “disconnected” it from the head-
ings in your document when you pressed Ctrl+Shift+F9. You have to remove
your original TOC and regenerate it.
Updating and removing a TOC
Follow these instructions to update and remove a TOC:
✦Updating a TOC: If you add, remove, or edit a heading in your docu-
ment, your TOC needs updating. To update it, click the Update Table
button (you can find it on the References tab) or click in the TOC and
press F9. A dialog box asks how to update the TOC. Choose to update
the page numbers only or update the entire table, including all TOC
entries and page numbers.
✦Removing a TOC: Click the Table of Contents button (on the References
tab) and choose Remove Table of Contents on the drop-down list.
Customizing a TOC
Want to tinker with your TOC? You can number the headings in different
ways and tell Word to include or exclude certain headings. To change around
a TOC, click inside it, and click the Table of Contents button on the References
tab and choose Insert Table of Contents on the drop-down list. You see the
Table of Contents dialog box (refer to Figure 6-2). Starting in this dialog box,
you can tinker with your TOC. After you click OK in the dialog box, click OK
in the message box that asks whether you want to replace the TOC.
Changing the structure of a TOC
Sometimes the conventional TOC that Word generates doesn’t do the trick.
Just because a heading has been given the Heading 1 style doesn’t mean that
it should receive first priority in the TOC. Suppose that you created another
style called ChapterTitle that should stand taller in the hierarchy than Heading
1. In that case, you need to rearrange the TOC so that Heading 1 headings
rank second, not first, in the TOC hierarchy.
Use the Table of Contents Options and Style dialog boxes to tinker with a
TOC. These dialog boxes are shown in Figure 6-3. To open them, click,
respectively, the Options button or Modify button on the Table of Contents
dialog box (refer to Figure 6-2).

✦Assigning TOC levels to paragraph styles: The Table of Contents
Options dialog box lists each paragraph style in the document you’re
working in. For headings you want to appear in the TOC, enter a number
in the TOC Level text box to determine the headings’ rank. If headings
assigned the Heading 1 style are to rank second in the TOC, for example,
enter a 2 in Heading 1’s TOC Level text box. You can exclude headings
from a TOC by deleting a number in a TOC Level box.
✦Including table entry fields: To include text you marked for entry in the
TOC, select the Table Entry Fields check box in the Table of Contents
Options dialog box (later in this chapter, the sidebar “Marking oddball
text for inclusion in the TOC” explains how TOC fields work).
✦Changing the look of TOC entries: The Style dialog box you see when
you click the Modify button gives you the chance to choose new fonts,
character styles, and font sizes for TOC entries. Click the Modify button.
Then, in the Style dialog box, choose options to format the TOC style.
For example, click the Bold button to boldface TOC entries. (Chapter 3
of this mini-book explains modifying styles.)
Indexing a Document
A good index is a thing of beauty. User manuals, reference works of any length,
and reports that readers will refer to all require indexes. Except for the table of
contents, the only way to find information in a long document is to look in the
index. An index at the end of a company report reflects well on the person
who wrote the report. It gives the appearance that the author put in a fair
amount of time to complete the work, even if he or she didn’t really do that.
An index entry can be formatted in many ways. You can cross-reference
index entries, list a page range in an index entry, and break out an index
entry into subentries and sub-subentries. To help you with your index,
Figure 6-4 explains indexing terminology.

that have been assigned heading styles. For
example, you can include figure captions. Use
one of these techniques to mark an entry in
your document for inclusion in the TOC:
 Click in the heading, figure caption, or
whatnot. Next, click the Add Text button on
the References tab and choose a TOC level
on the drop-down list (the Do Not Show in
Table of Contents option keeps headings
from being included in the TOC). If you
choose Level 2, for example, the entry
appears with other second-level headings.
 Click in a heading and press Alt+Shift+O.
Then, in the Mark Table of Contents Entry
dialog box, make sure that the words you
want to appear in the TOC appear in the
Entry text box (edit the words if need be),
and make sure that C (for Contents)
appears in the Table Identifier box. In the
Level box, enter a number to tell Word how
to treat the entry when you generate the
table of contents. For example, entering 1
tells Word to treat the entry like a first-level
heading and give it top priority. A 3 places
the entry with the third-level headings.
Finally, click the Mark button.
When you generate the table of contents, be
sure to include the oddball entries. To do that,
click the Options button in the Table of Contents
dialog box and, in the Table of Contents Options
dialog box (refer to Figure 6-3), select the Table
Entry Fields check box.

Indexing a Document

Writing a good index entry is as hard as writing good, descriptive headings.
As you enter index entries in your document, ask yourself how you would
look up information in the index, and enter your index entries accordingly.
Marking index items in the document
The first step in constructing an index is to mark index entries in your docu-
ment. Marking index items yourself is easier than it seems. After you open
the Mark Index Entry dialog box, it stays open so that you can scroll through
your document and make entries.
1. If you see a word or phrase in your document that you can use as a
main, top-level entry, select it; otherwise, place the cursor in the para-
graph or heading whose topic you want to include in the index.
You can save a little time by selecting a word, as I describe shortly.
2. On the References tab, click the Mark Entry button (or press Alt+Shift+X).
The Mark Index Entry dialog box appears. If you selected a word or
phrase, it appears in the Main Entry box.
3. Choose how you want to handle this index entry (refer to Figure 6-4 to
see the various ways to make index entries).
When you enter the text, don’t put a comma or period after it. Word
does that when it generates the index. The text that you enter appears 
in your index.
• Main Entry: If you’re entering a main, top-level entry, leave the text in
the Main Entry box (if it’s already there), type new text to describe
this entry, or edit the text that’s already there. Leave the Subentry
box blank.
• Subentry: To create a subentry, enter text in the Subentry box. The
subentry text will appear in the index below the main entry text, so
make sure that some text is in the Main Entry box and that the
subentry text fits under the main entry.
• Sub-subentry: A sub-subentry is the third level in the hierarchy. To create
a sub-subentry, type the subentry in the Subentry box, enter a colon (:),
and type the sub-subentry, like so: religious observances:shaman.
4. Decide how to handle the page reference in the entry.
Again, your choices are many:
• Cross-reference: To go without a page reference and refer the reader
to another index entry, click the Cross-Reference option button and
type the other entry in the text box after the word See. What you

Indexing a Document
276
type here appears in your index, so be sure that the topic you refer
the reader to is really in the index.
• Current Page: Click this option to enter a single page number after the
entry.
• Page Range: Click this option if you’re indexing a subject that covers
several pages in your document. A page range index entry looks
something like this: “Sioux Indians, 149–157.” To make a page range
entry, you must create a bookmark first. Select the text in the page
range and press Ctrl+Shift+F5 or click the Bookmark button on the
Insert tab (you may have to click the Links button first, depending on
the size of your screen). In the Bookmark dialog box, enter a name in
the Bookmark Name box, and click the Add button. (Chapter 1 of this
mini-book explains bookmarks.)
5. You can boldface or italicize a page number or page range by clicking
a Page Number Format check box.
In some indexes, the page or page range where the topic is explained in
the most depth is italicized or boldfaced so that readers can get to the
juiciest parts first.
6. If you selected a single word or phrase in Step 1, you can click the
Mark All button to have Word go through the document and mark all
words that are identical to the one in the Main Entry box; click Mark
to put this single entry in the index.
Click outside the Mark Index Entry dialog box and find the next topic or
word that you want to mark for the index. Then click the Mark Entry
button on the References tab and make another entry.
A bunch of ugly field codes appear in your document. You can render them
invisible by clicking the Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab.
Generating the index
After you mark all the index entries, it’s time to generate the index:
1. Place the cursor where you want the index to go, most likely at the
end of the document.
You might type the word Index at the top of the page and format the
word in a decorative way.
2. On the References tab, click the Insert Index button.
You see the Index dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-5.

3. Choose options in the dialog box and click OK.
As you make your choices, watch the Print Preview box to see what 
happens.
Here are the options in the Index dialog box:
✦Type: Choose Run-in if you want subentries and sub-subentries to run
together (refer to Figure 6-4); choose Indented to indent them.
✦Columns: Stick with 2, unless you don’t have subentries or sub-subentries
and you can squeeze three columns on the page or you are working on a
landscape document.
✦Language: Choose a language for the table, if necessary and if you have
installed a foreign language dictionary. If you have installed the diction-
ary, you can run the spell checker over your index and make sure that
the entries are spelled correctly.
✦Right Align Page Numbers: Normally, page numbers appear right after
entries and are separated from entries by a comma, but you can right-
align the entries so that they line up under one another with this option.
✦Tab Leader: Some index formats place a leader between the entry and
the page number. A leader is a series of dots or dashes. If you’re working
with a format that has a leader, you can choose a leader from the drop-
down list.
Figure 6-5:

✦Formats: Word offers a number of attractive index layouts. You can
choose one from the list.
✦Modify: Click this button if you’re adventurous and want to create an
index style of your own (Chapter 3 explains styles).
To update an index after you create or delete entries, click it and then click
the Update Index button or right-click the index and then choose Update
Field on the shortcut menu.
Editing an index
After you generate an index, read it carefully to make sure that all entries are
useful to readers. Inevitably, something doesn’t come out right, but you can
edit index entries as you would the text in a document. Index field markers
are enclosed in curly brackets with the letters XE and the text of the index
entry in quotation marks, like so: { XE: “Wovoka: Ghost Dance” }. To edit
an index marker, click the Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab to see the
field markers and find the one you need to edit. Then delete letters or type
letters as you would do with normal text.
Here’s a quick way to find index field markers: After clicking the Show/Hide¶
button, with the index fields showing, go to the Home tab, click the Editing
button (if necessary), click the arrow beside the Find button, and choose Go
To (or press Ctrl+G). On the Go To tab of the Find and Replace dialog box,
choose Field, and type XE in the Enter Field Name box. Then click the Next
button until you find the marker you want to edit. You can also use the Find
command on the Home tab to look for index entries. Word finds these entries
as well as text — if you clicked the Show/Hide¶ button and displayed index
fields in your document.
Putting Cross-References in a Document
Cross-references are very handy indeed. They tell readers where to go to find
more information on a topic. The problem with cross-references, however, is
that the thing being cross-referenced really has to be there. If you tell read-
ers to go to a heading called “The Cat’s Pajamas” on page 93, and neither the
heading nor the page exists, readers curse and tell you where to go, instead
of the other way around.
Fortunately for you, Word lets you know when you make errant cross-
references. You can refer readers to headings, page numbers, footnotes, 
endnotes, and plain-old paragraphs. And as long as you create captions for
your cross-references with the Insert Caption button on the References tab,
you can also make cross-references to equations, figures, graphs, listings,

Book II
Chapter 6

and Scholarly
Papers
Putting Cross-References in a Document
279
programs, and tables. If you delete the thing that a cross-reference refers
to and render the cross-reference invalid, Word tells you about it the next
time you update your cross-references. Best of all, if the page number, num-
bered item, or text that a cross-reference refers to changes, so does the
cross-reference.
To create a cross-reference:
1. Write the first part of the cross-reference text.
For example, you could write To learn more about these cowboys of
the pampas, see page and then type a blank space. The blank space sep-
arates the word page from the page number you’re about to enter. If
you’re referring to a heading, write something like For more informa-
tion, see “.Don’t type a blank space this time because the heading text
will appear right after the double quotation mark.
2. On the References tab, click the Cross-Reference button.
The Cross-Reference dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-6, appears.
3. Choose what type of item you’re referring to in the Reference Type
drop-down list.
If you’re referring to a plain-old paragraph, choose Bookmark. Then click
outside the dialog box, scroll to the paragraph you’re referring to, and
place a bookmark there. (Chapter 1 of this mini-book explains bookmarks.)
4. Make a choice in the Insert Reference To box to refer to text, a page
number, or a numbered item.
Choose what the 
reference refers to.
Choose how to
refer to the item.
Figure 6-6:
Entering a
cross-
reference.

Putting Footnotes and Endnotes in Documents
280
The options in this box are different, depending on what you chose in
Step 3.
• Text: Choose this option (Heading Text, Entire Caption, and so on) to
include text in the cross-reference. For example, choose Heading
Text if your cross-reference is to a heading.
• Number: Choose this option to insert a page number or other kind of
number, such as a table number, in the cross-reference.
• Include Above/Below: Check this box to include the word above or
below to tell readers where, in relation to the cross-reference, the
thing being referred to is located in your document.
5. If you wish, leave the check mark in the Insert as Hyperlink check box
to create a hyperlink as well as a cross-reference.
With a hyperlink, someone reading the document on-screen can
Ctrl+click the cross-reference and go directly to what it refers to.
6. In the For Which box, tell Word where the thing you’re referring to is
located.
To do so, select a heading, bookmark, footnote, endnote, equation,
figure, graph, or whatnot. In long documents, you almost certainly have
to click the scrollbar to find the one you want.
7. Click the Insert button and then click the Close button.
8. Back in your document, enter the rest of the cross-reference text, if
necessary.
When you finish creating your document, update all the cross-references. To
do that, press Ctrl+A to select the entire document. Then press F9 or right-
click in the document and choose Update Field on the shortcut menu.
If the thing referred to in a cross-reference is no longer in your document, you
see Error! Reference source not found where the cross-reference
should be. To find cross-reference errors in long documents, look for the
word Error! with the Find command (press Ctrl+F). Investigate what went
wrong, and delete the cross-reference or make a new one.
Putting Footnotes and Endnotes in Documents
A footnote is a bit of explanation, a comment, or a reference that appears at
the bottom of the page and is referred to by a number or symbol in the text.
An endnote is the same thing, except that it appears at the end of the sec-
tion, chapter, or document. If you’ve written a scholarly paper of any kind,
you know what a drag footnotes and endnotes are.

Putting Footnotes and Endnotes in Documents
281
You’ll be glad to know that Word takes some of the drudgery out of footnotes
and endnotes. For example, if you delete or add a note and you instruct
Word to automatically number your footnotes and endnotes, all notes after
the one you added or deleted are renumbered. And you don’t have to worry
about long footnotes because Word adjusts the page layout to make room
for them. You can change the numbering scheme of footnotes and endnotes
at will. When you’re reviewing a document, all you have to do is move the
pointer over a footnote or endnote citation. The note icon appears, as does a
pop-up box with the text of the note.
Entering a footnote or endnote
To enter a footnote or endnote in a document:
1. Place the cursor in the text where you want the note’s symbol or
number to appear.
2. On the References tab, click the Insert Footnote button (or press
Alt+Ctrl+F) or the Insert Endnote button (or press Alt+Ctrl+D).
If you’re in Draft view, the Notes pane opens at the bottom of the screen
with the cursor beside the number of the note you’re about to enter. In
Print Layout view, Word scrolls to the bottom of the page or the end of
the document or section so that you can enter the note, as shown in
Figure 6-7.
3. Enter your footnote or endnote.
4. Click the Close button in the Notes pane if you’re in Draft view; in
Print Layout view, scroll upward to return to the main text.
Figure 6-7:

Putting Footnotes and Endnotes in Documents
282
To quickly return from writing a note to the place in your document
where the footnote or endnote number citation is located, double-click
the number citation at the bottom of the page (in Print Layout view) or
the Notes pane (in Draft view). For example, if you just finished entering
footnote 3, double-click the number 3.
Choosing the numbering scheme 
and position of notes
Changing the numbering scheme and positioning of endnotes and footnotes
is quite easy. On the References tab, click the Footnotes group button. The
Footnote and Endnote dialog box appears (see Figure 6-7). Tell Word where
to place your notes:
✦Footnotes: Choose Bottom of Page to put footnotes at the bottom of the
page no matter where the text ends; choose Below Text to put footnotes
directly below the last text line on the page.
✦Endnotes: Choose End of Section if your document is divided into sec-
tions (such as chapters) and you want endnotes to appear at the back of
sections; choose End of Document to put all endnotes at the very back
of the document.
In the Format area, tell Word how to number the notes if you haven’t done so
already:
✦Number Format: Choose A B C, i ii iii, or another numbering scheme, if
you want. You can also enter symbols by choosing the last option on
this drop-down list.
✦Custom Mark: You can mark the note with a symbol by clicking the
Symbol button and choosing a symbol in the Symbol dialog box. If you
go this route, you have to enter a symbol each time you insert a note.
Not only that, you may have to enter two or three symbols for the
second and third notes on each page or document because Word can’t
renumber symbols.
✦Start At: To start numbering the notes at a place other than 1, A, or i,
enter 2, B, ii, or whatever in this box.
✦Numbering: To number the notes continuously from the start of your
document to the end, choose Continuous. Choose Restart Each Section
to begin anew at each section of your document. For footnotes, you can
begin anew on each page by choosing Restart Each Page.

By the way, the Convert button in the Footnote and Endnote dialog box is for
fickle scholars who suddenly decide that their endnotes should be footnotes
or vice versa. Click it and choose an option in the Convert Notes dialog box
to turn footnotes into endnotes, turn endnotes into footnotes, or — in docu-
ments with both endnotes and footnotes — make the endnotes footnotes
and the footnotes endnotes.
Deleting, moving, and editing notes
If a devious editor tells you that a footnote or endnote is in the wrong place,
that you don’t need a note, or that you need to change the text in a note, all
is not lost:
✦Editing: To edit a note, double-click its number or symbol in the text.
You see the note on-screen. Edit the note at this point.
✦Moving: To move a note, select its number or symbol in the text and
drag it to a new location; or you can cut and paste it to a new location.
✦Deleting: To delete a note, select its number or symbol and press the
Delete key.
Footnotes and endnotes are renumbered when you move or delete one 
of them.
Compiling a Bibliography
A bibliography is a list, usually in alphabetical order by author name, of all
the books, journal articles, Web sites, interviews, and other sources used in
the writing of an article, report, or book. Writing a good bibliography is a
chore. Besides keeping careful track of sources, you have to list them cor-
rectly. Does the author’s name or work’s name come first in the citation?
How do you list a Web site or magazine article without an author’s name?
Word’s Bibliography feature is very nice in this regard: It solves the problem
of how to enter citations for the bibliography. All you have to do is enter the
bare facts about the citation — the author’s name, title, publication date,
publisher, and so on — and Word presents this information correctly in the
bibliography. You can choose among several popular bibliographical styles
(APA, Chicago, and others) from the Style drop-down list, as shown in
Figure 6-8. After you make your choice, Word reformats all bibliography cita-
tions. You don’t have to worry about whether titles should be underlined or
italicized, or how authors’ names should be listed in the bibliography.

Compiling a Bibliography
284
Inserting a citation for your bibliography
Abbreviated citations appear in the text of your document in between paren-
theses where you enter citations; the complete citation appears in the bibli-
ography. After you enter the information about a citation, entering it a
second time is easy because Word keeps a master list of all citations you
have used in your work, both in the document you’re working on and your
other documents. To enter a citation, click in your document at the place
that refers to the source, go to the References tab, and use one of these tech-
niques to enter the citation:
✦Entering a citation you’ve already entered in your document: Click the
Insert Citation button and choose the citation on the drop-down list. The
top of the drop-down list presents citations you’ve already entered.
✦Creating a new citation: Click the Insert Citation button and choose Add
New Source. You see the Create Source dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-8.
Choose an option on the Type of Source drop-down list and enter partic-
ulars about the source. You can click the Show All Bibliography Fields
check box to enlarge the dialog box and enter all kinds of information
about the source. Whether clicking the check box is necessary depends
on how detailed you want your bibliography to be.
✦Inserting a citation placeholder: Click the Insert Citation button and
choose Add New Placeholder if you’re in a hurry and you don’t currently
have all the information you need to describe the source. The Placeholder
Insert a citation.
Choose a bibliography style.

Name dialog box appears. Enter a placeholder name for the source and
click OK. Later, when you have the information for the source, either click
the citation in the text and choose Edit Source on its drop-down list or
click the Manage Sources button, and in the Source Manager dialog box,
select the placeholder name (it has a question mark next to it) and click
the Edit button. You see the Edit Source dialog box. Enter the information
and click OK.
✦Inserting a citation you’ve entered in another document: Click the
Manage Sources button. You see the Source Manager dialog box. In the
Master List, select the source you need and click the Copy button. Then
click Close.
Your citation appears in text in parentheses. Move the pointer over it and
you see an inline drop-down list that you can open to edit the citation as it
appears in-text as well as edit it in the bibliography, as shown in Figure 6-9.
Editing a citation
Use one of these techniques to edit a citation:
✦Open the citation’s drop-down list (see Figure 6-9) and choose Edit
Source. You see the Edit Source dialog box, where you can edit the 
citation.
✦Click the Manage Sources button on the References tab. The Source
Manager dialog box appears. Select the citation, click the Edit button,
and change around the citation in the Edit Source dialog box.
Changing how citations appear in text
Citations appear in text enclosed in parentheses. Use one of these tech-
niques to change how a citation appears in the text of your document:
✦Changing what’s in parentheses: Open the citation’s drop-down list and
choose Edit Citation (see Figure 6-9). You see the Edit Citation dialog
box. To keep the author’s name, year, or title from appearing inside
parentheses, click the Author, Year, or Title check box (whether the 
Figure 6-9:
In-text
citations
have drop-
down lists.

Compiling a Bibliography
286
citation in parentheses lists the author, year, or title depends on
which citation style you choose). To make page numbers appear with
the citation, enter page numbers in the Pages box.
✦Removing the in-text citation: Swipe over the citation to select it and
press Delete. Removing an in-text citation this way does not prevent the
citation from appearing in the bibliography.
Generating the bibliography
Go to the References tab and follow these steps to generate your bibliography:
1. Click in your document where you want the bibliography to appear.
Probably that place is toward the end of the document.
2. On the References tab, open the Style drop-down list and choose a
style.
If you’re generating your bibliography for a paper you will submit to a
journal or institution, ask the editors which style they prefer for bibli-
ographies and choose that style from the list.
3. Click the Manage Sources button.
You see the Source Manger dialog box. Citations in the Current List box
will appear in your bibliography.
4. If necessary, address citations in the Current List box.
If you entered any citation placeholders, their names appear in the list
next to question marks. Select these placeholders, click the Edit button,
and enter information in the Edit Source dialog box.
To keep a citation from appearing in the bibliography, select it and click
the Delete button.
5. Click the Close button in the Source Manager dialog box.
6. Click the Bibliography button and choose Insert Bibliography on the
drop-down list.
There it is — your bibliography.

his chapter pulls back the curtain and gives you a first glimpse of
Outlook, the e-mailer and personal organizer in the Office 2007 suit of
programs. Read on to find out once and for all what Outlook does, how to
get from folder to folder, and the different ways to view the stuff in folders.
You can find advice about keeping folders well organized, deleting stuff,
backing up an Outlook file, and cleaning out items in folders that you no
longer need.
What Is Outlook, Anyway?
Outlook isn’t in character with the rest of the Office programs. It’s a little 
different — you can tell as soon as you glance at the screen. The familiar
Ribbon is nowhere to be found, and in its place you see a menu, the Standard
toolbar, and the Advanced toolbar along the top of the window. To make
things even more complicated, what you see on-screen changes when 
you click a Navigation Pane button on the left side of the window. Click a
Navigation Pane button — Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, Notes, Folder
List, or Shortcuts — and you go to a different Outlook window altogether.

Navigating the Outlook Folders
290
Outlook can be confusing because the program serves many different pur-
poses. To wit, Outlook is all this:
✦An e-mail program: You can use it to send and receive e-mail messages
and files, as well as organize e-mail messages in different folders so that
you can keep track of them. (See Chapter 3 of this mini-book.)
✦An appointment scheduler: Outlook is also a calendar for scheduling
appointments and meetings. You can tell at a glance when and where
you’re expected, as well as be alerted to upcoming appointments and
meetings. (See Chapter 4 of this mini-book.)
✦An address book: The program can store the addresses, phone num-
bers, and e-mail addresses of friends, foes, clients, and family members.
Looking up this information in the Contacts List is easy. (See Chapter 2
of this mini-book.)
✦A task reminder: Outlook is a means of planning projects. You can tell
when deadlines fall and plan your workload accordingly. (See Chapter 5
of this mini-book.)
✦A notes receptacle: This part of the program is a place to jot down
notes and reminders. (See Chapter 5 of this mini-book.)
Outlook is a lot of different things all rolled into one. For that reason, the
program can be daunting at first. But hang in there. Soon you’ll be running
roughshod over Outlook and making it suffer on your behalf.
Navigating the Outlook Folders
The first thing you should know about Outlook is this: All items are kept in
folders, as shown in Figure 1-1. E-mail messages when they arrive are kept in
the Inbox folder. Calendar items are kept in the Calendar folder. Notes are
kept in the Notes folder. All the folders, meanwhile, are kept in one big folder
called Personal Folders. When you want to undertake a new task, you go to a
different folder.
Here are the ways to get from folder to folder in Outlook and undertake a
new task:
✦Navigation pane: Click a button in the Navigation pane — Mail, Calendar,
Contacts, Tasks, or Notes — to go to a folder. The Navigation pane
appears on the left side of the window (see Figure 1-1).
✦Go menu: Choose an option in the Go menu — Mail, Calendar, Contacts,
Tasks, or Notes. You can also go to one of these folders by pressing the
Ctrl key and a number 1 through 5.

291
✦Folder List: Click the Folder List button to open the Personal Folder and
then select one of its subfolders in the Navigation pane. For example, to
read incoming e-mail messages, select the Inbox folder (see Figure 1-1). The
Folder List button is located at the bottom of the Navigation pane. You can
also see the Folder List by pressing Ctrl+6 or choosing Go➪Folder List.
✦Outlook Today button: No matter where you go in Outlook, you can
always click the Outlook Today button to go to Personal Folders –
Outlook Today view. You can find the Outlook Today button on the
Advanced toolbar.
✦Back, Forward, and Up One Level buttons: Click these buttons to
return to a window, revisit a window you retreated from, or climb the
hierarchy of personal folders. The three buttons are found on the
Advanced toolbar.
By the way, you can open a folder in a new window. To do so, right-click a
Navigation Pane button and choose Open in New Window. To close a window
you opened this way, click its Close button (the X in the upper-right corner).

Wrestling with the Navigation Pane and To-Do Bar
Outlook is designed so you can get from folder to folder without any trouble.
All you have to do to open a new folder is click a button or folder icon in the
Navigation pane. However, sometimes the Navigation pane gets in the way.
You need the extra space for reading e-mail messages or rummaging in the
Contacts folder. Here are instructions for wrestling with the Navigation pane,
To-Do Bar, and Reading pane:
✦Hiding and displaying the Navigation pane: As I explain earlier, the
Navigation pane appears on the left side of the window and offers but-
tons and folder names that you can click to go to different folders (refer
to Figure 1-1). Click the Expand or Maximize buttons in the Navigation
pane to display or hide it. You can also choose View➪Navigation Pane
Off or Normal or keep pressing Alt+F1.
✦Hiding and displaying the To-Do Bar: The To-Do Bar appears on the
right side of the screen and shows your calendar, upcoming appoint-
ments, and tasks arranged by due date (refer to Figure 1-1). Click a calen-
dar day to open the Calendar on that day. Double-click an appointment
to open an Appointment window, or a task to open a Task window. To
display or hide the To-Do Bar, click its Expand or Minimize button,
choose View➪To-Do Bar➪Normal or Off, or keep pressing Alt+F2.
✦Hiding and displaying the Reading pane: The Reading pane appears on
the right side or bottom of the window and gives you a more detailed
look at an item you selected. It comes in handy when you’re reading
e-mail because you can read a message and still view your message list
(refer to Figure 1-1). To display or hide the Reading pane, choose View➪
Reading Pane➪Right, Bottom, or Off. When the Reading pane is displayed,
you can also hide it by dragging its border to the bottom or right side of
the window.
You can decide for yourself what appears on the Navigation pane and To-Do
Bar. Choose Tools➪Options and select the Other tab in the Options dialog
box. Then click the Navigation Pane button to open the Navigation Pane
Options dialog box and tell Outlook which buttons to place on the Navigation
pane. Click the To-Do Bar button in the Options dialog box to tell Outlook
what appears on the To-Do Bar.
Getting a Better View of Items in a Folder
Because you spend so much time gazing at folders, you may as well get a
good view of the items inside them. In a crowded folder, it helps to know the
different ways to view items. Figure 1-2, for example, shows the Contacts
folder in Business Cards view.

Categorizing Items
294
Categorizing Items
One of your biggest tasks in Outlook, if you choose to accept it, is to catego-
rize items in folders so that you can find and deal with them. Finding items
can be a chore in a folder with a lot of items, but by categorizing items, you
can find the ones you’re looking for. Categories are color-coded to make iden-
tifying them easier. After you assign a category to an item, you can arrange
items in folders by category, and in so doing, find items. Categorizing is a
great way to stay on top of all the chores you have to do.
Creating a category
Follow these steps to create a category for organizing folder items:
1. Select an item in a folder to which you want to assign your new 
category.
2. Choose Edit➪Categorize➪All Categories.
You see the Color Categories dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-3. At this
point, you can create a category from scratch or revamp one of Outlook’s
color-named categories:
• Creating your own category: Click the New button to open the Add New
Category dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-3. Then enter a name for your
category, choose a color from the drop-down list, and click OK. While
you’re at it, you can open the Shortcut Key drop-down list and choose a
shortcut key combination for assigning your new category to items
(see Figure 1-3). Click OK in the Color Categories dialog box.
Figure 1-3:
Click the
New button
or Rename
button to
create a

Categorizing Items
295
• Renaming a category: In the Color Categories dialog box (see Figure 1-3),
select a color category, and click the Rename button. Then enter a
new name where the old one is now. You can choose a different color
for your category by choosing a color in the Color drop-down list. To
assign it a shortcut key, open the Shortcut Key drop-down list and
choose a shortcut key combination.
To delete a category, return to the Color Categories dialog box, select the
category’s name, and click the Delete button. Although the category is
deceased, items to which you assigned the category keep their category
assignments.
Assigning items to categories
Follow these steps to assign a category to a folder item:
1. Select the item.
2. Choose Edit➪Categorize and choose a category on the submenu.
You can also right-click, choose Categorize, and select a category on the
shortcut menu, or press a Ctrl+key combination if you assigned one to
the category. You can select more than one category for an item.
To remove a category assignment, right-click the item and choose Categorize➪
Clear All Categories.
You can categorize an e-mail message you’re reading in the message
window by clicking the Categorize button and choosing a category on
the drop-down list.
Another way to quickly categorize an e-mail message is to click the Category
column of the message in a mail folder window. To tell Outlook which category
to assign when you click the Category column, choose Edit➪Categorize➪
Set Quick Click. You see the Set Quick Click dialog box. Choose the category
on the drop-down list that you want to assign by “quick-clicking” in the
Category column.
Arranging items by category in folders
To arrange items by category in a folder, select the folder in the Navigation
pane and follow these instructions:
✦In folders that hold e-mail: Choose View➪Arrange By➪Categories.
✦In all other folders: Open the Current View drop-down list and choose
By Category.

296
You can also open the Categorized Mail subfolder in the Search Folders
folder to display e-mail messages that you categorized.
Finding Stray Folder Items
If you can’t locate an item in a folder by scrolling, changing views, or any
other means, you have to resort to the Find command. Outlook offers four
Find commands. From quickest to most thorough, try one of these tech-
niques to find an item you’re looking for:
✦Conducting a simple search in one folder: Open the folder you want to
search, enter a search term in the Search Folder box, and press Enter, as
shown in Figure 1-4. If you have trouble finding the Search Folder box,
choose Tools➪Instant Search➪Instant Search or press Ctrl+E.
✦Conducting a search with selected criteria in one folder: Open the
folder you want to search, click the Expand Query Builder button, and
enter criteria for your search in the Search panel, as shown in Figure 1-4.
You can make your search more specific by clicking the Add Criteria
button and choosing more criteria from the drop-down list. (If you can’t
find the Expand Query Builder button, choose Tools➪Instant Search➪
Expand the Query Builder or press Ctrl+Alt+W.)
✦Searching for e-mail messages from the same person in different 
folders: Select a message from the person and choose Tools➪Instant
Search➪Messages from Sender. The Advanced Find dialog box opens
with messages from the sender at the bottom.
✦Searching for e-mail messages in different folders: Choose Tools➪
Instant Search➪Search All Mail Items (or press Ctrl+Alt+A). Then either
enter a search term in the Search folder text box or click the Expand
Query Builder button and enter search criteria. This search technique
finds only e-mail messages; it searches in many folders, including
archive folders.
✦Searching across many folders: Choose Tools➪Instant Search➪
Advanced Find (or press Ctrl+Shift+F). You see the Advanced Find dialog
box. In the Look For drop-down list, choose what you want to search for.
Click the Browse button to open the Select Folder(s) dialog box, where
you can select more than one folder to search in. Then choose options
on the three tabs to formulate your search. Which options are available
depends on which folder you’re searching.

Saving a search so that you can run it later
If you find yourself searching for the same stuff
repeatedly, save the search criteria in a file.
That way, you don’t have to enter the search
criteria each time you run the search. Searches
are saved in special files with the extension
OSS (Office Saved Searches).
To save your searches, start by creating a
folder for storing OSS files. Then Choose
Tools➪Instant Search➪Advanced Find and
conduct an advanced search for the item you
often seek. After your search is complete,
choose File➪Save Search in the Advanced
Find dialog box, locate the folder where you
save searches in the Save Search dialog box,
enter a descriptive name for the search, and
click OK.
Next time you want to conduct the search,
choose Tools➪Instant Search➪Advanced Find
to open the Advanced Find dialog box. In the
dialog box, choose File➪Open Search, choose
a search file in the Open Saved Search dialog
box, and click OK. Then click the Find Now
button in the Advanced Find dialog box.

Dweleting E-Mail Messages, Contracts, Tasks, and Other Items
298
Deleting E-Mail Messages, Contacts, 
Tasks, and Other Items
Outlook folders are notorious for filling quickly. E-mail messages, contacts,
and tasks soon clog the folders if you spend any time in Outlook. From time
to time, go through the e-mail folders, Contacts window, Task window, and
Calendar to delete items you no longer need. To delete items, select them
and do one of the following:
✦Click the Delete button (or press the Delete key).
✦Choose Edit➪Delete (or press Ctrl+D).
✦Right-click and choose Delete.
Deleted items — e-mail messages, calendar appointments, contacts, or 
tasks — land in the Deleted Items folder in case you want to recover them.
To delete items once and for all, open the Deleted Items folder and start
deleting like a madman.
To spare you the trouble of deleting items twice, once in the original folder
and again in the Deleted Items folder, Outlook offers these amenities:
✦Empty the Deleted Items folder when you close Outlook: If you’re no
fan of the Deleted Items folder and you want to remove deleted items
without reviewing them, choose Tools➪Options, select the Other tab in
the Options dialog box, and select Empty the Deleted Items Folder Upon
Exiting.
✦Empty the Deleted Items folder yourself: Choose Tools➪Empty
“Deleted Items” Folder to remove all the items in the Deleted Items
folder. You can also right-click the Deleted Items folder in the Folder 
List and choose Empty “Deleted Items” Folder.
You can search for items and delete them in the Advanced Find dialog box.
See “Finding Stray Folder Items,” earlier in this chapter. Be sure to check out
“Running the Mailbox Cleanup command” at the end of this chapter. It
explains a quick way to delete Inbox messages.
Finding and Backing Up Your Outlook File
All the data you keep in Outlook — e-mail messages, names and addresses,
calendar appointments and meetings — is kept in a file called Outlook.pst.
Locating this file on your computer sometimes requires the services of
Sherlock Holmes. The file isn’t kept in a standard location. It can be any

Finding and Backing Up Your Outlook File
299
number of places, depending on the operating system on your computer 
and whether you upgraded from an earlier version of Office.
The all-important Outlook.pst file is hiding deep in your computer, but
you need to find it. You need to know where this file is located so that you
can back it up to a Zip drive, CD, or other backup medium. This file holds
clients’ names and the names of relatives and loved ones. It holds the e-mail
messages you think are worth keeping. It would be a shame to lose this stuff
if your computer failed.
Here’s a quick way to find the Outlook.pst file on your computer and back
it up:
1. Choose File➪Data File Management.
You see the Account Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-5.
2. Select Personal Folders and click the Open Folder button.
Windows Explorer opens, and you see the folder where the Outlook.pst
file is kept.
3. Click the Folders button in Windows Explorer to see the folder hierar-
chy on your computer.
By scrolling in the Folders pane on the left side of the window, you can
determine where on your computer the elusive Outlook.pst file really is.
Figure 1-5:

Open Folder
button to

4. Close Outlook.
Sorry, but you can’t back up an Outlook.pst file if Outlook is running.
5. To back up the file, right-click it in Windows Explorer, choose Send To
on the shortcut menu, and choose the option on the submenu that rep-
resents where you back up files.
If an accident befalls your computer, copy the backup Outlook.pst file
that you made into the folder where the Outlook.pst file is stored on
your computer.
Importing E-Mail and Addresses 
from Another Program
Suppose that you’ve been using Outlook Express, Eudora, or Lotus Organizer
to handle your e-mail and contact addresses, but now you’ve become a con-
vert to Outlook. What do you do with the e-mail messages and names and
addresses in the other program? You can’t let them just sit there. You can,
however, import them into Office and pick up where you left off.
To import e-mail and contact addresses from another program, start by
choosing File➪Import and Export. You see the Import and Export Wizard.
What you do next depends on where you now do your e-mailing and address
tracking:
✦Outlook Express: Select Import Internet Mail and Addresses and then
click Next. In the Outlook Import Tool dialog box, select Outlook Express,
select check boxes to decide what to import (Mail, Addresses, and/or
Rules), and click the Finish button.
✦Eudora: Select Import Internet Mail and Addresses and then click Next.
In the Outlook Import Tool dialog box, select Eudora, choose options to
decide what to do about duplicate entries, and click the Finish button. In
the Browser for Folder dialog box, select the file where the Eudora data
is kept and click OK.
✦Lotus Organizer: Select Import from Another Program or File, click Next,
select a Lotus Organizer, and click Next again. Click Next while you go
along. You’re asked how to handle duplicate items, to locate the Lotus
Organizer data file, and to select an Outlook folder to put the data in.
Before you import e-mail and addresses from another program, weed out the
e-mail messages and addresses you no longer need. Why ferry this stuff into
Outlook when you no longer need it?

Cleaning Out Your Folders
301
Cleaning Out Your Folders
Getting rid of unneeded items in folders is essential for good mental health.
All that clutter can be distressing. Earlier in this chapter, “Deleting E-Mail
Messages, Contacts, Tasks, and Other Items” explains how to muck out fold-
ers by emptying them. These pages explain two more techniques for remov-
ing detritus from folders — archiving and the Mailbox Cleanup command.
Archiving the old stuff
In some cases, Outlook puts e-mail messages, tasks, and appointments older
than six months in the Archive folder, a special folder for items that Outlook
thinks are stale and not worth keeping anymore. Outlook calls sending these
items to the Archive folder “autoarchiving.” Items that have been archived
aren’t lost forever. You can visit them by opening the Archive Folders folder
and its subfolders on the Folders List. Archive Folders and its subfolders are
created automatically the first time you archive items.
Archiving is a way of stripping your mail folders, tasks lists, and calendar of
items that don’t matter anymore. How and when items are archived is up to
you. To archive items, you establish a default set of archiving rules that
apply to all folders, and if a folder needs individual attention and shouldn’t
be subject to the default archiving rules, you can establish special rules for
that folder. Each folder can have its own set of archiving rules or be subject
to the default rules.
To tell Outlook how to archive old stuff, start by displaying an AutoArchive
dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-6:
Figure 1-6:
Making the
default
archiving
rules (left)
and rules for
a folder
(right).

Cleaning Out Your Folders
302
✦Establishing default archiving rules: Choose Tools➪Options, and in the
Options dialog box, select the Other tab. Then click the AutoArchive
button.
✦Establishing rules for a specific folder: Either right-click the folder 
and choose Properties or display the folder and choose File➪Folder➪
Properties for Folder Name. Then in the Properties dialog box, select the
AutoArchive tab. (Because no date is connected to items in the Contacts
folder, you can’t autoarchive names and addresses.)
Negotiate these options to establish default archiving rules (see Figure 1-6):
✦Run AutoArchive Every: Enter a number to tell Outlook how often to
archive items.
✦Prompt Before Archive Runs: If this check box is selected, you see a
message box before archiving begins, and you can decline to archive if
you want by selecting No in the message box.
✦Delete Expired Items (E-Mail Folders Only): Select this check box to
delete all e-mail messages when the time period has expired.
✦Archive or Delete Old Items: Deselect this option if you don’t want to
archive items.
✦Show Archive Folder in Folder List: Select this option if you want to
keep the archived version of the folder in the Folder List. Archived items
are kept in this folder so you can review them.
✦Clean Out Items Older Than: Choose a cut-off time period after which
to archive items.
✦Move Old Items To: Click the Browse button and select a folder if you
want to store the Archive file in a certain location.
✦Permanently Delete Old Items: Select this option if you want to delete,
not archive, old items.
Choose among these options to establish archiving rules for a specific folder
(refer to Figure 1-6):
✦Do Not Archive Items in This Folder: Select this option if items in the
folder aren’t worth archiving.
✦Archive Items in This Folder Using the Default Settings: Select this
option to defer to the default archiving rules for the folder.
✦Archive This Folder Using These Settings: Select this option to estab-
lish archiving rules for the folder.

Book III

Cleaning Out Your Folders
303
✦Clean Out Items Older Than: Choose a cut-off time period after which
to archive the items in the folder.
✦Move Old Items To: Click the Browse button and select a folder if you
want to store the archived items in a specific location.
✦Permanently Delete Old Items: Select this option if you want to delete,
not archive, items in this folder.
Besides archiving, another way to remove bric-a-brac automatically is to
take advantage of the Rules Wizard to delete certain kinds of messages when
they arrive. See Chapter 3 of this mini-book for more information.
Periodically compact the file in which Outlook data is stored to shrink the
file and get more room on your hard disk. To compact the Outlook data file,
choose File➪Data File Management, select Personal Folders in the Outlook
Data Files dialog box, and click the Settings button. In the Personal Folders
dialog box, select the Compact Now button. Compacting an Outlook file can
take time if the file is stuffed with data.
Running the Mailbox Cleanup command
The Mailbox Cleanup command is an all-purpose command for finding e-mail
messages, archiving items, deleting items, and deleting alternate versions of
items. To use the command, choose Tools➪Mailbox Cleanup. You see the
Mailbox Cleanup dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-7. The dialog box offers a
speedy entrée into these different Outlook tasks:
Figure 1-7:

✦Seeing how much disk space folders occupy: Click the View Mailbox Size
button and then take note of folder sizes in the Folder Size dialog box.
✦Finding items: Select an option button to find items older than a certain
number of days or larger than a certain number of kilobytes, enter a
days or kilobytes number, and click the Find button. You land in the
Advanced Find dialog box. Earlier in this chapter, “Finding Stray Folder
Items” explains this dialog box. Use it to select items and delete them.
✦Archiving items: Click the AutoArchive button to archive items in your
folders. See “Archiving the old stuff” in this chapter for details.
✦Emptying the deleted items folder: Click the Empty button to empty the
Deleted Items folder. See “Deleting E-Mail Messages, Contacts, Tasks, and
Other Items,” earlier in this chapter.

n pathology, which is the study of diseases and how they’re transmitted,
a contact is a person who passes on a communicable disease, but in
Outlook, a contact is someone about whom you keep information. Information
about contacts is kept in the Contacts folder. This folder is a super-powered
address book. It has places for storing people’s names, addresses, phone
numbers, e-mail addresses, Web pages, pager numbers, birthdays, anniver-
saries, nicknames, and other stuff besides. When you enter an e-mail address,
you can get it straight from the Contacts folder to be sure that the address
is entered correctly. As I explain in Book II, Chapter 5, you can also get
addresses from the Contacts folder when you generate form letters, labels,
and envelopes for mass mailings in Word.
This short but happy chapter explains how to maintain a tried-and-true
Contacts folder, enter information about people in the folder, edit informa-
tion, find a missing contact, and print the information in the Contacts folder.
Maintaining a Happy and Healthy Contacts Folder
A Contacts folder is only as good and as thorough as the information about
contacts that you put into it. These pages explain how to enter information
about a contact and update the information if it happens to change.
Don’t despair if you have been using another software program to track
addresses. Chapter 1 of this mini-book explains how to import those
addresses into Outlook without having to re-enter them.

Maintaining a Happy and Healthy Contacts Folder
306
Entering a new contact in the Contacts folder
To place someone on the Contacts List, open the Contacts folder and start
by doing one of the following:
✦Click the New Contact button.
✦Press Ctrl+N (in the Contacts Folder window) or Ctrl+Shift+C (in another
window).
✦Choose File➪New➪Contact.
You see the Contact form, as shown in Figure 2-1. On this form are places for
entering just about everything there is to know about a person except his or
her favorite color and secret vices. Enter all the information you care to
record, keeping in mind these rules of the road while you go along:
✦Full names, addresses, and so on: Although you may be tempted to
simply enter addresses, phone numbers, names, and so on in the text
boxes, don’t do it! Click the Full Name button on the General tab, for
example, to enter a name (see Figure 2-1). Click the Business or Home
Click the buttons to enter information.

button to enter an address in the Check Address dialog box (see
Figure 2-1). By clicking these buttons and entering data in dialog boxes,
you permit Outlook to separate the component parts of names, addresses,
and phone numbers. As such, Outlook can use names and addresses as
a source for mass mailings and mass e-mailings.
When entering information about a company, not a person, leave the Full
Name field blank and enter the company’s name in the Company field.
✦Information that matters to you: If the form doesn’t appear to have a
place for entering a certain kind of information, try clicking a triangle
button and choosing a new information category from the pop-up list.
Click the triangle button next to the Business button and choose Home,
for example, if you want to enter a home address rather than a business
address.
✦File As: Open the File As drop-down list and choose an option for filing
the contact in the Contacts folder. Contacts are filed alphabetically by
last name, first name, company name, or combinations of the three.
Choose the option that best describes how you expect to find the con-
tact in the Contacts folder.
✦Mailing addresses: If you keep more than one address for a contact, dis-
play the address to which you want to send mail and select the This Is
the Mailing Address check box. This way, in a mass mailing, letters are
sent to the correct address.
✦E-mail addresses: You can enter up to three e-mail addresses for each
contact. (Click the triangle button next to the E-mail button and choose
E-mail 2 or E-mail 3 to enter a second or third address.) In the Display As
text box, Outlook shows you what the To: line of e-mail messages looks
like when you send e-mail to a contact. By default, the To: line shows the
contact’s name followed by his or her e-mail address in parentheses.
However, you can enter whatever you want in the Display As text box,
and if entering something different helps you distinguish between e-mail
addresses, enter something different. For example, enter Lydia — Personal
so that you can tell when you send e-mail to Lydia’s personal address as
opposed to her business address.
✦Photos: To put a digital photo on a Contact form, click the Add Contact
Photo button, and in the Add Contact Picture dialog box, select a picture
and click OK.
✦Details: To keep a detailed dossier on a contact, click the Details button
and enter information in the Details window. This window offers places
for recording birthdays and other minutia.
Be sure to write a few words on the Notes box to describe how and where
you met the contact. When the time comes to weed out contacts in the
Contacts folder list, reading these descriptions helps you decide who gets
weeded and who doesn’t.

Finding a Contact in the Contacts Folder
308
When you’re done entering information, click the Save & Close button. If
you’re in a hurry to enter contact information, click the Save & New button.
Doing so opens an empty form so that you can record information about
another contact.
Here’s a fast way to enter contact information for someone who has sent you
an e-mail message: Open the message, right-click the sender’s name on the
From: line, and choose Add to Outlook Contacts on the shortcut menu. You
see the Contact form. Enter more information about the sender if you can
and then click the Save & Close button.
Changing a contact’s information
Changing a contact’s information is a chore if you do it by going from field to
field on the General and Details windows of the Contact form. Fortunately for
you, there is a faster way to update the information you have about a contact —
go to the All Fields window. As Figure 2-2 shows, this window lists fields in a line-
by-line fashion. Choose an option on the Select From drop-down list, scroll in the
form, and update fields as necessary.
Finding a Contact in the Contacts Folder
The Contacts folder, which is shown in Figure 2-3, can grow very large, so
Outlook offers a number of ways to search it. After you find the contact
you’re looking for, double-click the contact’s name to open the Contact
window. Here are some techniques for finding a contact in the Contacts
folder:

✦Use the scrollbar: Click the arrows or drag the scroll box to move
through the list.
✦Click a letter button: Click a letter button on the right side of the
window to move in the list to a specific letter.
✦Change views: Change views often helps in the search. Choose a new
view in the Navigation pane or from the Current View drop-down list in
the Advanced toolbar (see Figure 2-3).
Mapping out an address
In the Communicate group in the
Contact window is an obscure but
very useful little button called Map
that can be a great help when you need to go
somewhere but aren’t sure how to get there. As
long as your computer is connected to the
Internet and an address is on file for a contact,
you can click the Map button to go online to the
Windows Live Local Web site and see a map
with the address at its center. You can get driv-
ing directions from this map. Double-click a
contact name to open his or her Contact
window. Good luck getting there!

Printing the Contacts Folder

✦Type a name in the Find a Contact text box: Enter a name or e-mail
address in this text box and press Enter (see Figure 2-3). The Type a
Contact to Find text box is located on the Standard toolbar.
✦Search Contacts text box: Enter a search term in the Search Contacts
text box and open the query builder as well to conduct a thorough
search (see Figure 2-3). See Chapter 1 of this mini-book for instructions
about finding items in folders.
✦Search by category: Categorize contacts as you enter them and switch
to By Category view to arrange contacts by category. See Chapter 1 of
this mini-book.
Printing the Contacts Folder
The paperless office hasn’t arrived yet in spite of numerous predictions to 
the contrary, and sometimes it’s necessary to print the Contacts folder on 
old-fashioned paper. For times like these, I hereby explain the different ways to
print the Contacts folder and how to fiddle with the look of the printed pages.

To print information about a single contact, double-click his or her name to
open the Contact window. Then click the Print button in the Contact window
(you find it on the Quick Access toolbar).
Different ways to print contact information
Outlook offers several attractive ways to print contact information in the
Contacts folder. Which printing options you get depends on which view of
the Contacts window is showing when you give the command to print. (Open
the Current View drop-down list and choose an option to change views.)
Starting in Address Cards view or Detailed Address Cards view, you can print
Contact information like so:
✦Card Style: Print all information on display in the Contacts window, with
each contact name appearing in a gray shade.
✦Small Booklet Style: Similar to Card Style, except the page is shrunk to
an eighth of its size, and pages are designed to print on both sides so
that they can be bound and distributed.
✦Medium Booklet Style: Similar to Small Booklet Style, except pages are
shrunk to a fourth of their original size.
✦Memo Style: Information for each contact is printed on one page, and
you get one page for each contact in the Contacts folder.
✦Phone Directory Style: Similar to Card Style, except only phone num-
bers and fax numbers are printed.
Starting in any view apart from Address Cards and Detailed Address Cards,
you can print contact information in Table Style. In Table Style, the informa-
tion is printed in a simple table with column headings.
The basics of printing contact information
Follow these steps to print information about contacts in the Contacts folder:
1. Select the contacts whose information you want to print, if you don’t
want to print information about everybody.
You can select contacts by Ctrl+clicking names. Another way to select
contacts is to run the Advanced Find command, as I explain in Chapter 1
of this mini-book.
2. Click the Print button or press Ctrl+P.
You see the Print dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-4. (In the Advanced
Find dialog box, choose File➪Print.)

3. Under Print Style, choose an option.
The preceding section in this chapter explains what these options are.
To get another idea what the Print Styles are, select one, click the Page
Setup button, and in the Page Setup dialog box, click the Print Preview
button. The Print Preview window shows what the pages will look like
when you print them. Click the Print button in this window to start print-
ing right away.
If you start in a view apart from Address Cards or Detailed Address
Cards, Table Style is the only Print Style option.
4. Select Page Setup options if you want to change the number of
columns that are printed, change fonts, change headers and footers,
or otherwise fiddle with the printed pages.
The next section in this chapter explains these options.
5. If you selected contacts to print in Step 1, choose the Only Selected
Items option button.
6. Click OK to start printing.
Changing the look of printed pages
By default, contact information is printed in 12-, 10-, or 8-point Tahoma font.
Your name, a page number, and the date and time you print the contact
information appears on a footer at the bottom of the pages. To change these
and other settings, click the Page Setup button in the Print dialog box (refer
to Figure 2-4). You see the Page Setup dialog box. You can click the Print

Preview button in this dialog box to open the Print Preview window and see
what your contacts look like when you print them (click the Page Setup
button to return to the Page Setup dialog box).
Change these settings on the Format tab of the Page Setup dialog box:
✦Where contact information is printed: Contact information is printed
alphabetically with a letter heading to mark where the As, Bs, Cs, and so
on begin. To place contacts that begin with each letter on separate pages,
select the Start on a New Page option button.
✦Number of columns: Enter a number in the Number of Columns text box
to tell Outlook how many columns you want.
✦Contact index: Select the Contact Index on Side check box to print
thumbnail letter headings on the sides of pages.
✦Letter headings: To remove the letter headings that mark where con-
tacts starting with a certain letter begin, deselect the Headings for Each
letter check box.
✦Fonts and font sizes: Click a Font button and choose a different font or
font size for headings and body text.
✦Gray shades: Gray shades appear behind contact names, but you can
remove them by deselecting the Print Using Gray Shading check box.
On the Header/Footer tab, the three boxes are for deciding what appears on
the left side, middle, and right side of headers and footers. Type whatever
you please into these text boxes. You can also click buttons in the dialog box
to enter fields — a page number, total page number, printing date, printing
time, or your name — in headers or footers.

Chapter 3: Handling Your E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Addressing, sending, replying to, and forwarding e-mail messages
 Creating distribution lists to send messages to groups
 Sending files and pictures with e-mail
 Understanding HTML, plain text, and rich text formats
 Receiving e-mail and files over the Internet
 Organizing and managing your e-mail
 Creating and using different folders to store e-mail
 Preventing junk e-mail
“N
either snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couri-
ers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds,” reads
the inscription on the Eighth Avenue New York Post Office Building. E-mailers
face a different set of difficulties. Instead of snow, rain, or gloomy nights,
they face junk e-mail blizzards, pesky colleagues, and the occasional co-
worker who believes that all e-mail messages should be copied to everyone
in the office.
This chapter explains the basics of sending and receiving e-mail, but also
goes a step further to help you organize and manage your e-mail messages.
This chapter unscrews the inscrutable. It shows you how to send files and
pictures with e-mail messages, make a distribution list so that you can
e-mail many people simultaneously, and postpone sending a message. You
can also find out how to be advised when someone has read your e-mail,
reorganize e-mail in the Inbox window, and be alerted to incoming messages
from certain people or from people writing about certain subjects. Finally,
this chapter shows you how to create folders for storing e-mail and explain
what you can do to prevent junk e-mail from arriving on your digital
doorstep.

Sorry, you can’t send chocolates or locks of hair by e-mail, but you can send

also discover how to send copies and blind copies of e-mail messages, reply
to forwarded e-mail, create a distribution list, send e-mail from different
accounts, and postpone sending a message. Better keep reading.
The basics: Sending an e-mail message
After you get the hang of it, sending an e-mail message is as easy as falling off
a turnip truck. The first half of this chapter addresses everything you need
to know about sending e-mail messages. Here are the basics:
1. In the Inbox or Drafts folder, click the New E-Mail Message button or
choose Ctrl+N.
A Message window like the one in Figure 3-1 appears.
2. Enter the recipient’s e-mail address in the To text box.
The next section in this chapter, “Addressing an e-mail message,”
explains the numerous ways to address an e-mail message. You can
address the same message to more than one person by entering more
than one address in the To text box. For that matter, you can send
copies of the message and blind copies of the message to others (see
“Sending copies and blind copies of messages,” later in this chapter).
Figure 3-1:

and

3. In the Subject text box, enter a descriptive title for the message.
When your message arrives on the other end, the recipient sees the sub-
ject first. Enter a descriptive subject that helps the recipient decide
whether to read the message right away. After you enter the subject, it
appears in the title bar of the Message window.
Outlook offers different ways to get a recipient’s attention. For example,
you can give your message a priority rating. See “Prioritizing the mes-
sages you send,” later in this chapter.
4. Type the message.
Whatever you do, don’t forget to enter the message itself! You can spell
check your message by pressing F7 or clicking the Spelling button.
As long as you compose messages in HTML format and the person
receiving your e-mail messages has software capable of reading HTML,
you can decorate messages to your heart’s content (later in this chapter,
“All about Message Formats” explains the HTML issue). Experiment with
fonts and font sizes. Boldface and underline text. Throw in a bulleted or
numbered list. You can find many formatting commands on the Insert,
Options, and Format Text tabs. These are the same formatting com-
mands found in Word.
5. Click the Send button.
As “Postponing sending a message” explains later in this chapter, you
can put off sending a message. And if you have more than one e-mail
account, you can choose which one to send the message with, as
“Choosing which account to send messages with” explains. Messages
remain in the Outbox folder if you postpone sending them or if Outlook
can’t send them right away because your computer isn’t connected to
the Internet.
If you decide in the middle of writing a message to write the rest of it later,
click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+S and close
the Message window. The message lands in the Drafts folder. When you’re
ready to finish writing the message, open the Drafts folder and double-click
your unfinished message to resume writing it.
Copies of e-mail messages you have sent are kept in the Sent Items folder. If
you prefer not to keep copies of sent e-mail messages on hand, choose
Tools➪Options and on the Preferences tab of the Options dialog box, click
the E-Mail Options button. You see the E-Mail Options dialog box. Deselect
the Save Copies of Messages in Sent Items Folder check box.

Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages

Addressing an e-mail message
How do you address an e-mail message in the To text box of the Message
window (refer to Figure 3-1)? Let me count the ways:
✦Get the address (or addresses) from the Contacts folder: Click the To
(or Cc) button to send a message to someone whose name is on file in
your Contacts folder. You see the Select Names dialog box, as shown in
Figure 3-2. Click or Ctrl+click to select the names of people to whom you
want to send the message. Then click the To-> button (or Cc-> or Bcc->
button) to enter addresses in the To text box (or Cc or Bcc text boxes) of
the Message window. Click OK to return to the Message window. This is
the easiest way to address an e-mail message to several different people.
✦Type a person’s name from the Contacts folder: Simply type a person’s
name if the name is on file in the Contacts folder. (See the Tip at the end
of this list to find out what to do if you aren’t sure whether the name is
really on file or you aren’t sure whether you entered the name correctly.)
To send the message to more than one person, enter a comma (,) or
semicolon (;) between each name.
✦Type the address in the To text box: If the address is on file in your
Contacts folder or Address Book, a pop-up message with the complete
address appears after you type the first couple of letters. Press Enter to
enter the address without your having to type all the letters. To send the
message to more than one person, enter a comma (,) or semicolon (;)
between each address.
✦Reply to a message sent to you: Select the message in the Inbox folder
and click the Reply button. The Message window opens with the address
Making Outlook your default e-mail program
If you switched to Outlook from Outlook
Express or another e-mail program and you like
Outlook, you need to tell your computer that
Outlook is henceforward the e-mail program
you want to use by default. The default e-mail
program is the one that opens when you click
an e-mail link on a Web page or give the order
to send an Office file from inside an Office pro-
gram. Follow these steps to make Outlook the
default e-mail program on your computer:
1. Click the Start button and choose Control
Panel.
2. Double-click the Internet Options icon.
If you don’t see this icon, click the Switch
to Classic View link on the left side of the
window. You see the Internet Properties
dialog box.
3. On the Programs tab, choose Microsoft
Office Outlook on the E-Mail drop-down
list and then click OK.

of the person to whom you’re replying already entered in the To text
box. This is the most reliable way (no typos on your part) to enter an
e-mail address. You can also click the Reply to All button to reply to
enter the e-mail addresses of all the people to whom the original mes-
sage was sent.
These days, many people have more than one e-mail address, and when you
enter an e-mail address in the To text box of the Message window, it’s hard to
be sure whether the address you entered is the right one. To make sure that
you send an e-mail address to the right address, click the Check Names button
in the Names group. You see the Check Names dialog box, as shown in
Figure 3-3. Select the correct name and address in the dialog box and then
click OK. You can also click the Check Names button if you aren’t sure
whether a name was entered correctly in the To text box or you aren’t
sure whether a name is really on file in the Contacts folder.
Sending copies and blind copies of messages
Sending copies of messages and blind copies of messages is simple enough,
but think twice before you do it. In my experience, a dysfunctional office is
one where people continuously send copies of messages to one another,
often to supervisors, to itemize their quarrels or document their work.
However, sending copies of messages can clog mailboxes and waste every-
one’s time.
Select names.
Click a button.
Figure 3-2:

Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages

When you send a copy of a message, the person who receives the message
knows that copies have been sent because the names of people to whom
copies were sent appear at the top of the e-mail message. But when you send
blind copies, the person who receives the message doesn’t know that others
received it.
Follow these instructions to send copies and blind copies of messages:
✦Send a copy of a message: Enter e-mail addresses in the Cc text box of the
Message window, or in the Select Names dialog box (refer to Figure 3-2),
select names and then click the Cc->button.
Figure 3-3:

Sending e-mail from inside 
another Office program
As long as Outlook is your default e-mail pro-
gram (I explain how to make it the default pro-
gram earlier in this chapter), you can send
e-mail messages or file attachments from other
Office programs without opening Outlook. If the
Word document, Excel worksheet, or Power-
Point presentation needs sending right away,
save it and follow these steps to send it as a file
attachment to an e-mail message:
1. With the file you want to send on-screen,
click the Office button.
2. Choose Send➪Email.
A message window appears with the name
of your file in the subject line. Your file is ready
to be sent along with the e-mail message.
3. Enter the recipient’s address in the To box
and type a message in the Message box.
4. Click the Send button.
That was fast! It was faster than opening
Outlook and attaching the file to the e-mail
message on your own. The message is sent
right away if Outlook is running. Otherwise,
the message is sent next time you open
Outlook.

✦Send a blind copy of a message: On the Options tab, click the Show Bcc
button, or click the To or Cc button in the Message window to open the
Select Names dialog box (refer to Figure 3-2), select names, and click the
Bcc-> button or else enter addresses in the Bcc-> text box.
You may well ask yourself why these buttons are called Cc and Bcc. Why the
extra C? Actually, the Cc stands for “carbon copy” and the Bcc stands for
“blind carbon copy.” These terms originated in the Mesozoic era when let-
ters were composed on the typewriter, and to make a copy of a letter, you
inserted carbon paper between two paper sheets and typed away. The
carbon paper turned your fingers black. You left black fingerprints on your
fedora hat or angora sweater. Those were the days!
Replying to and forwarding e-mail messages
Replying to and forwarding messages is as easy as pie. For one thing, you
don’t need to know the recipient’s e-mail address to reply to a message. In
the Inbox, select the message you want to reply to or forward and do the 
following:
✦Reply to author: Click the Reply button. The Message window opens
with the sender’s name already entered in the To box and the original
message in the text box below. Write a reply and click the Send button.
✦Reply to all parties who received the message: Click the Reply to All
button. The Message window opens with the names of all parties who
received the message in the To and Cc boxes and the original message 
in the text box. Type your reply and click the Send button. If files were
attached to the original message, they aren’t sent in the reply.
✦Forward a message: Click the Forward button. The Message window
opens with the text of the original message. Either enter an e-mail
address in the To text box or click the To button to open the Select
Names dialog box and then select the names of the parties to whom the
message will be forwarded. Add a word or two to the original message if
you like; then click the Send button.
Forwarding a message to a third party without the permission of the
original author is a breach of etiquette and very bad manners. How
would you like your opinions or ideas scattered hither and yon to
strangers you don’t know? I could tell you a story about an e-mail mes-
sage of mine that an unwitting editor forwarded to a cantankerous pub-
lisher, but I’m saving that story for the soap opera edition of this book.
To find the e-mail address of someone who sent you an e-mail message, double-
click the message to display it in the Message window, right-click the sender’s
name in the From box, and choose Outlook Properties. The e-mail address
appears in the E-Mail Properties dialog box. To add a sender’s name to the
Contacts folder, right-click the name and choose Add to Outlook Contacts.

Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
322
By default, the text of the original message appears in the Message window
after you click the Reply or Reply to All button to respond to a message.
However, Outlook offers the option of not displaying the original text by
default. The program also offers different ways of displaying this text. To
scope out these options and perhaps select one, choose Tools➪Options, 
and on the Preferences tab of the Options dialog box, click the E-Mail Options
button. You see the E-Mail Options dialog box. Choose an option on the When
Replying to a Message drop-down list to tell Outlook how or whether to dis-
play original messages in replies.
Distribution lists for sending messages to groups
Suppose you’re the secretary of the PTA at a school and you regularly send
the same e-mail messages to 10 or 12 other board members. Entering e-mail
addresses for the 10 or 12 people each time you want to send an e-mail mes-
sage is a drag. To keep from having to enter so many e-mail addresses, you
can create a distribution list, a list with multiple e-mail addresses. To address
your e-mail message, you simply enter the name of the distribution list, not
the individual names, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4:

Creating a distribution list
Follow these steps to bundle e-mail addresses into a distribution list:
1. Choose File➪New➪Distribution List or press Ctrl+Shift+L.
You see the Distribution List window, as shown in Figure 3-5.
2. Enter a descriptive name in the Name text box.
3. Click the Select Members button to get names and addresses from the
Contacts folder.
You see the Select Members dialog box.
4. Hold down the Ctrl key and select the name of each person you want
to be on the list.
5. Click the Members button and then click OK.
You can find the Members button in the lower-left corner of the dialog
box. The names you chose appear in the Distribution List window.
You can add the names of people who aren’t in your Contacts folder by
clicking the Add New button, and in the Add New Member dialog box,
entering a name and e-mail address.
6. Click the Save & Close button in the Distribution List window.
Addressing e-mail to a distribution list
To address an e-mail message to a distribution list, click the New button to
open a Message window, click the To button to open the Select Names dialog
box, and select the distribution list name. Distribution list names appear in
boldface and are marked with a Distribution List icon.
Figure 3-5:

Editing a distribution list
The names of distribution lists appear in the Contacts folder, where they are
boldfaced and marked with an icon showing two heads in profile. You can
treat the lists like regular contacts. In the Contacts folder, double-click a dis-
tribution list name to open the Distribution List window (refer to Figure 3-5).
From there, you can add names to the list, remove names from the list, or
select new names for the list.
Prioritizing the messages you send
Every day, billions of e-mail messages arrive on
people’s computers, each one begging for the
recipient’s attention, each one crying out,
“Read me first.” With this kind of cut-throat
competition, how can you give your e-mail
messages a competitive advantage? How can
you make yours stand out in the crowd?
The best way is to write a descriptive title in the
Subject box of the Message window. The sub-
ject is the first thing people see in their Inbox.
They decide whether to read a message now,
later, or never on the basis of what they see on
the Subject line.
Another way to (maybe) get other’s attention is
to assign a high priority rating to your message.
If the recipient reads his or her e-mail with
Outlook or Outlook Express, a red exclamation
point appears beside the message in the Inbox
folder. Conversely, you can assign a low prior-
ity to messages as well, in which case a down-
ward-pointing arrow appears next to the
message heading in the Inbox folder. However,
prioritizing this way is only worthwhile if the
recipient runs Outlook or Outlook Express
because other e-mail programs don’t know
what to make of the exclamation point or the
arrow.
To assign a priority to a message, click the High
Importance or Low Importance button in the
Message window (you can find these buttons
in the Options group). In the Inbox folder, click
the Sort by Importance button, the leftmost
sorting button, to arrange messages by their
priority ratings.

Sending a file along with a message
Sending a file along with an e-mail message is called attaching a file in Outlook
lingo. Yes, it can be done. You can send a file or several files along with an
e-mail message by following these steps:
1. With the Message window open, click the Attach File button.
You see the Insert File dialog box.
2. Locate and select the file that you want to send along with your e-mail
message.
Ctrl+click filenames to select more than one file.
3. Click the Insert button.
The name of the file (or files) appears in the Attached text box in the
Message window. Address the message and type a note to send along
with the file. You can right-click a filename in the Attach text box and
choose Open on the shortcut menu to open a file you’re about to send.
Or, if you change your mind about sending the file, you can click Remove.
Here’s a fast way to attach a file to a message: Find the file in Windows
Explorer or My Computer and drag it into the Message window. The file’s
name appears in the Attach box as though you placed it there by clicking the
Attach File button.
Including a picture in an e-mail message
As shown in Figure 3-6, you can include a picture in the body of an e-mail
message, but in order to see it, the recipient’s e-mail software must display
messages by using HTML. As “All about Message Formats” explains later in
this chapter, not everyone has software that displays e-mail by using HTML.
People who don’t have HTML e-mail software get the picture anyhow, but it
doesn’t appear in the body of the e-mail message; it arrives as an attached
file (see “Handling Files That Were Sent to You,” later in this chapter, to find
out about receiving files by e-mail). To view the attached file, the recipient
has to open it with a graphics software program, such as Paint or Windows
Picture and Fax Viewer.
Follow these steps to adorn an e-mail message with a picture:
1. In the Message window, click the Insert tab.
2. Click in the body of the e-mail message where you want the picture to go.
3. Click the Insert Picture button.
You see the Insert Picture dialog box.

Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages

4. Locate and select the digital picture you want to send; then click the
Insert button.
The picture lands in the Message window. Select the picture, go to the
(Picture Tools) Format tab, open the drop-down list on the Text Wrapping
button, and choose an option to decide how text behave nearby the pic-
ture. Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains graphics in detail; Book I, Chapter 8
explains how to manipulate graphic images.
Want to remove a picture from an e-mail message? Select it and press the
Delete key.
Choosing which account to send messages with
If you’ve set up more than one e-mail account, you can choose which one to
send an e-mail message with. Follow these instructions to choose an account
for sending e-mail messages:
✦Choosing the default account for sending messages: When you click
the Send button in the Message window, the e-mail message is sent by
way of the default e-mail account. To tell Outlook which account that is,
choose Tools➪Account Settings. You see the Account Settings dialog
box. Select the account that you want to be the default and click the Set
as Default button.

✦Sending an individual message: To bypass the default e-mail account
and send a message with a different account, click the Account button in
the Message window, and choose an account name from the drop-down
list. Then click the Send button.
Postponing sending a message
As you probably know, e-mail messages are sent immediately when you click
the Send button in the Message window if your computer is connected to the
Internet. If it isn’t connected, the message lands in the Outbox folder, where
it remains until you connect to the Internet.
But suppose you want to postpone sending a message? Outlook offers two
techniques for putting off sending a message:
✦Moving messages temporarily to the Drafts folder: Compose your mes-
sage, click the Save button in the Message window (or press Ctrl+S), and
close the Message window. Your e-mail message goes to the Drafts folder.
When you’re ready to send it, open the Drafts folder, double-click your
message to open it, and click the Send button in the Message window.
✦Postponing the send date: Click the Options tab in the Message window.
On the Options tab, click the Delay Delivery button. You see the Message
Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-7. Select the Do Not Deliver Before
check box, enter a date on the calendar, and if you so desire, select a
time from the drop-down list. Then click the Close button. In the Message
window, click the Send button. Your message goes to the Outbox folder,
where it remains until the time arrives to send it and you open Outlook.

Being Advised When Someone Has Read Your E-Mail
328
Being Advised When Someone Has Read Your E-Mail
Outlook offers a command whereby you can be informed when someone has
received or read an e-mail message you sent. You can even send a mini-ballot
to someone else, solicit their vote, and have the vote sent to you by e-mail.
To perform this magic trick, start in the Message window and click the
Options tab. In the Tracking group, select one or more of these options:
✦Use Voting Buttons: Voting buttons are included on a drop-down list in
the e-mail message you send. Choose a set of buttons from the drop-
down list, as shown in Figure 3-8. The recipient clicks the Vote button,
chooses an option on a drop-down list, and the response is sent to you
in the form of an e-mail message with the word Approve, Reject, Yes, No,
or Maybe in the subject line.
✦Request a Delivery Receipt: You’re informed by e-mail after the mes-
sage is delivered. Select the Request a Delivery Receipt check box. To be
informed, however, you and the recipient must use the same Exchange
Server, and the recipient must choose to inform you that the message
was delivered. Don’t count on this one really working.

✦Request a Read Receipt: The message box appears, as shown in
Figure 3-8. If the recipient clicks the Yes button, a Message window
appears immediately so that he or she can send an e-mail informing you
that the message was read. The message, when it arrives on your end,
lists the date and time that the response message was sent. Select the
Request a Read Receipt check box.
All about Message Formats
Outlook offers three formats for sending e-mail messages: HTML, plain text,
and rich text. What are the pros and cons of the different formats?
✦HTML format: These days, almost all e-mail is transmitted in HTML
format, the same format with which Web pages are made. If HTML is 
the default format you use for creating messages in Outlook — and it is
unless you tinkered with the default settings — the e-mail messages you
send are, in effect, little Web pages. HTML gives you the most opportuni-
ties for formatting text and graphics. In HTML format, you can place pic-
tures in the body of an e-mail message, use a background theme, and do
any number of sophisticated formatting tricks.
However, the HTML format has it share of detractors. First, the mes-
sages are larger because they include sophisticated formatting instruc-
tions, and being larger, they take longer to transmit over the Internet.
Some e-mail accounts allocate a fixed amount of disk space for incoming
e-mail messages and reject messages when the disk space allocation is
filled. Because they’re larger than other e-mail messages, HTML mes-
sages fill the disk space quicker. Finally, some e-mail software can’t
handle HTML messages. In this software, the messages are converted 
to plain text format.
✦Plain text format: In plain text format, only letters and numbers are
transmitted. The format doesn’t permit you to format text or align para-
graphs in any way, but you can rest assured that the person who
receives the message can read it exactly as you wrote it.
✦Rich text format: The third e-mail message format, rich text, is proprietary
to Microsoft e-mailing software. Only people who use Outlook and Outlook
Express can see rich text formats. I don’t recommend choosing the rich
text format. If formatting text in e-mail messages is important to you,
choose the HTML format because more people can read your messages.
When someone sends you an e-mail message, you can tell which format it
was transmitted in by looking at the title bar, where HTML, Plain Text, or Rich
Text appears in parentheses after the subject of the message. Outlook is
smart enough to transmit messages in HTML, plain text, or rich text format
when you reply to a message that was sent to you in that format.

All about Message Formats
330
Follow these instructions if you need to change the format in which your
e-mail messages are transmitted:
✦Changing the default format: Choose Tools➪Options, and in the
Options dialog box, select the Mail Format tab. From the Compose in
This Message Format drop-down list, choose HTML, Plain Text, or Rich
Text.
✦Changing the format for a single e-mail message: In the Message
window, click the Options tab. Then click the Plain Text, HTML, or Rich
Text button.
✦Always using the plain text or rich text format with a contact: To avoid
transmitting in HTML with a contact, start in the Contacts folder, double-
click the contact’s name, and in the Contact form, double-click the con-
tact’s e-mail address. You see the E-Mail Properties dialog box. In the
Internet Format drop-down list, choose Send Plain Text Only or Send
Using Outlook Rich Text Format.
Devising a signature for your e-mail messages
An e-mail signature is an address, word,
phrase, or pithy saying that appears at the
bottom of all the e-mail messages you send.
Sometimes signatures list company information
or instructions for reaching the sender. You can
create more than one signature and then
choose different signatures for different e-mail
messages.
Follow these steps to create an e-mail signature:
1. Choose Tools➪Options, select the Mail
Format tab in the Options dialog box, and
click the Signatures button.
You see the Signatures and Stationery
dialog box.
2. Click the New button.
The New Signature dialog box appears.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the signature
and click OK.
4. In the Edit Signature box, type your 
signature.
5. Choose a font and font size for the 
signature.
You can also choose alignment options.
6. Click OK twice to return the Options dialog
box and then to Outlook.
If you change your mind about putting a signa-
ture in your e-mail messages, return to the E-
Mail Signature tab of the Signatures and
Stationery dialog box and choose (None) in the
New Messages drop-down list.
To choose which signature to use if you create
more than one, click the Signature button on
the Message tab in the Message window and
choose a signature from the drop-down list.

Receiving E-Mail Messages
Let’s hope that all the e-mail messages you receive carry good news. These
pages explain how to collect your e-mail and all the different ways that
Outlook notifies you when e-mail has arrived. You can find several tried-and-
true techniques for reading e-mail messages in the Inbox window. Outlook
offers a bunch of different ways to rearrange the window as well as the mes-
sages inside it.
Getting your e-mail
Here are all the different ways to collect e-mail messages that were sent to you:
✦Collect the e-mail: Press F9 or choose Tools➪Send/Receive➪Send/
Receive All.
✦Collect e-mail from a single account (if you have more than one):
Choose Tools➪Send/Receive, and on the submenu, choose the name of
an e-mail account or group. (See “Groups for handling e-mail from differ-
ent accounts,” later in this chapter to find out what groups are.)
✦Collect e-mail automatically every few minutes: Press Ctrl+Alt+S or
choose Tools➪Send/Receive➪Send/Receive Settings➪Define Send/
Receive Groups. You see the Send/Receive Groups dialog box, as shown
in Figure 3-9. Select a group (groups are explained in “Groups for han-
dling e-mail from different accounts”), select the Schedule an Automatic
Send/Receive Every check box, and enter a minute setting. To temporar-
ily suspend automatic e-mail collections, choose Tools➪Send/Receive➪
Send/Receive Settings➪Disable Scheduled Send/Receive.

If you’re not on a network or don’t have a DSL or cable Internet connection,
you shortly see the Connection dialog box. Enter your password, if neces-
sary, and click the Connect button. The Outlook Send/Receive dialog box
appears to show you the progress of messages being sent and received.
Being notified that e-mail has arrived
Take the e-mail arrival quiz. Winners get the displeasure of knowing that
they understand far more than is healthy about Outlook. You can tell when
e-mail has arrived in the Inbox folder because:
A) You hear this sound: ding.
B) The mouse cursor briefly changes to a little envelope.
C) A little envelope appears in the system tray to the left of the Windows
clock. (You can double-click the envelope to open the Inbox folder.)
D) A pop-up desktop alert with the sender’s name, the message’s subject,
and the text of the message appears briefly on your desktop.
E) All of the above.
The answer is E, “All of the above,” but if four arrival notices strike you as
excessive, you can eliminate one or two. Choose Tools➪Options and on the
Preferences tab of the Options dialog box, click the E-Mail Options button.
Then, in the E-Mail Options dialog box, click the Advanced E-Mail Options
button. At long last, in the Advanced E-Mail Options dialog box, select or
deselect the four When New Items Arrive in My Inbox options. To make desk-
top alerts stay longer on-screen, click the Desktop Alert Settings button and
drag the duration slider in the Desktop Alert Settings dialog box. While
you’re at it, click the Preview button to see what the alerts look like.
Reading your e-mail in the Inbox window
Messages arrive in the Inbox window, as shown in Figure 3-10. Unread mes-
sages are shown in boldface type and have envelope icons next to their
names; messages that you’ve read (or at least opened to view) are shown in
Roman type and appear beside open envelope icons. To read a message,
select it and look in the Reading pane, or to focus more closely on a mes-
sage, double-click it to open it in a Message window, as shown in Figure 3-10.
In the Folder List, a number in parentheses beside the Inbox folder and
Deleted Items folder tells you how many unread messages are in those folders.
(The number in square brackets beside the Drafts and Junk E-Mail folders
tells you how many items, read and unread, are in those folders.)
Later in this chapter, “Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages,” explains
how to organize messages in the Inbox folder. Meanwhile, here are some

Book III
Chapter 3
Handling Your 
E-Mail
Receiving E-Mail Messages
333
simple techniques you can use to unclutter the Inbox folder and make it
easier to manage:
✦Hiding and displaying the Reading pane: Click the Reading Pane button
to make the Reading pane appear or disappear. The Reading pane gives
you an opportunity to read messages without opening them in a Message
window. However, with the Reading pane gone, column headings — From,
Subject, Received, Size, Flagged, and Category — appear in the Inbox
window, and you can click a column heading name to sort messages in dif-
ferent ways, as shown in Figure 3-11. For example, click the From column
name to arrange messages by sender name; click the Received column
name to arrange messages according to the date you received them.
Groups for handling e-mail 
from different accounts
Groups are meant to help people who have
more than one e-mail account handle their
e-mail. To begin with, all e-mail accounts
belong to a group called All Accounts. Unless
you change the default settings, all your e-mail
accounts belong to the All Accounts group, and
e-mail is sent by and received from all your
e-mail accounts at the same time. If you want to
change these default settings, press Ctrl+Alt+S
or choose Tools➪Send/Receive➪Send/Receive
Settings➪Define Send/Receive Groups. You
see the Send/Receive Groups dialog box (see
Figure 3-9) Follow these instructions in the
dialog box to change how you handle e-mail
from different accounts:
 Excluding an account from the All Accounts
group: Exclude an account if you don’t
want to collect its e-mail on a regular basis.
Maybe you want to collect mail from this
account sporadically. To exclude an account,
select the All Accounts group in the Send/
Receive Groups dialog box and click the
Edit button. You land in the Send/Receive
Settings – All Accounts dialog box. In the
Accounts list, select the account you want
to exclude and deselect the Include the
Selected Account in this Group check box.
 Creating a new group: Create a new group
if you want to establish settings for a single
e-mail account or group of accounts. Click
the New button in the Send/Receive
Groups dialog box, enter a name in the
Send/Receive Group Name dialog box, and
click OK. You see the Send/Receive Settings
dialog box. For each account you want to
include in your new group, select an
account name and then select the Include
the Select Account in This Group check box.
 Choosing settings for a group: In the
Send/Receive Groups dialog box, select the
group whose settings you want to estab-
lish. At the bottom of the dialog box (see
Figure 3-9), select whether to send and
receive e-mail when you press F9, whether
to send and receive automatically every
few minutes, and whether to send and
receive when you exit Outlook.

You can eat your cake and have it too by displaying column names and
the Reading pane, as shown in Figure 3-11. To do so, choose View➪Reading
Pane➪Bottom on the submenu. This command places the Reading pane
below the e-mail message list.
✦Hiding and displaying the Navigation pane: Choose View➪Navigation
Pane➪Normal or Minimized, or press Alt+F1. By hiding the Navigation
pane, you get even more room to display messages.
✦Autopreviewing messages: Click the AutoPreview button or choose
View➪AutoPreview to read the text of all on-screen messages in small type.
The message text appears below the subject heading of each message.
✦Changing views: Choose an option on the Current View drop-down list
to reduce the number of messages in the window. For example, you can
see only unread messages or messages that arrived in the past week.
Suppose you open an e-mail message but you regret doing so because you
want the unopened envelope icon to appear beside the message’s name. In
other words, you want to handle the message later on. To make a message in
the Inbox window appear as if it has never been opened, right-click it and
choose Mark as Unread.
Handling Files That Were Sent to You
You can tell when someone sends you files along with an e-mail message
because the paper clip icon appears in the Attachment column of the Inbox
window (if column headings are displayed), as shown in Figure 3-12. If you
display the Reading pane, the name of the file that was sent to you appears
in the Reading pane. If you double-click the message to open it in a window,
the name of the file appears there as well.
Attached file
Right-click to handle incoming files.
Figure 3-12:

Handling Files That Were Sent to You
336
Files that are sent to you over the Internet land deep inside your computer
in a subfolder of the Temporary Internet Files folder. This is the same obscure
folder where Web pages you encounter when surfing the Internet are kept.
The best way to handle an incoming file is to open it or save it right away to
a folder where you’re likely to find it when you need it.
Saving a file you received
To save a file that was sent to you in a new folder:
✦Double-click the filename and click the Save button in the Opening File
Attachment dialog box.
✦Right-click the filename and choose Save As, as shown in Figure 3-12.
✦Choose File➪Save Attachments➪Filename.
✦Click the Other Actions button in the Message window and choose Save
Attachments.
Preventing computer viruses 
from spreading by e-mail
Outlook doesn’t permit you to receive these kinds
of files because they may contain computer
viruses: batch program files (.bat), executable
program files (.exe), JavaScript source files
(.js), Microsoft Access Application files (.mdb),
and Visual Basic Scripts (.vbs). If someone
attempts to send you one of these files and, more-
over, your Internet service provider (ISP) per-
mits it to be sent, you get this message: Outlook
blocked access to the following potentially
unsafe attachments. Because computer viruses
can be hidden in macros, any file that can con-
ceivably contain a macro is screened. When
you try to open one of these files, a dialog box
warns you to open files only from trustworthy
sources. If you suspect that a file has a virus,
don’t open it. Save it to your hard disk and scan
it for viruses with your antivirus software. You
do have antivirus software, don’t you?

Opening a file you received
To open a file that was sent to you:
✦Double-click the filename in the Reading pane or Message window and
then click the Open button in the Opening Mail Attachment dialog box.
✦Right-click the filename and choose Open, as shown in Figure 3-12.
✦Right-click the paper clip icon in the Inbox window and choose View
Attachments➪Filename.
As long as the file being sent to you is a Word, PowerPoint, or Excel file,
you can preview it inside the Message window or Reading pane. To do so,
right-click the filename and choose Preview on the shortcut menu (refer to
Figure 3-12). After you preview the file, you can decide whether to open or
save it.
Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages
If you’re one of those unfortunate souls who receives 20, 30, 40 or more e-mail
messages daily, you owe it to yourself and your sanity to figure out a way to
organize e-mail messages such that you keep the ones you want, you can find
e-mail messages easily, and you can quickly eradicate the e-mail messages
that don’t matter to you. Outlook offers numerous ways to manage and organ-
ize e-mail messages. Pick and choose the techniques that work for you.
In a nutshell, here are all the techniques for organizing e-mail messages:
✦Change views in the Inbox window: Open the Current View drop-down
list on the Advanced toolbar and choose Last Seven Days, Unread
Messages in This Folder, or another view to shrink the number of e-mail
messages in the Inbox window.
✦Rearrange, or sort, messages in the Inbox window: If necessary, click
the Reading Pane button to remove the Reading pane and see column
heading names in the Inbox window. Then click a column heading name
to rearrange, or sort, messages by sender name, subject, receipt date,
size, or flagged status. See “Reading your e-mail in the Inbox window,”
earlier in this chapter, for details.
✦Delete the messages that you don’t need: Before they clutter the Inbox,
delete messages that you’re sure you don’t need as soon as you get
them. To delete a message, select it and then click the Delete button,
press the Delete key, or choose Edit➪Delete.
✦Move messages to different folders: Create a folder for each project
you’re involved with, and when an e-mail message about a project
arrives, move it to a folder. See “All about E-Mail Folders,” later in this
chapter.

Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages
338
✦Move messages automatically to different folders as they arrive: Instead
of moving messages yourself after they arrive, you can tell Outlook to
move messages automatically to different folders. See “Earmarking mes-
sages as they arrive,” later in this chapter.
✦Destroy junk mail as it arrives: You can delete junk mail automatically.
See “Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort of),” later in this chapter.
✦Flag messages: Flag a message with a color-coded flag to let you know to
follow up on it. See “Flagging e-mail messages,” the next section in this
chapter.
✦Categorize messages: Assign e-mail messages to categories; then,
arrange e-mail messages by category in the Inbox window by choosing
View➪Arrange By➪Categories. See Chapter 1 of this mini-book for info
about categorizing items in a folder.
✦Have Outlook remind you to reply to a message: Instruct Outlook to
make the Reminder message box appear at a date and time in the future
so that you know to reply to a message. See “Being reminded to take
care of e-mail messages,” later in this chapter.
✦Make liberal use of the Search commands: You can always find a stray
message with the Search commands. (See Chapter 1 of this mini-book to
know more about finding items in folders.) To quickly find all the mes-
sages from one person, right-click an e-mail message from that person
and choose Find All➪Messages from Sender. Choose Find All➪Related
Messages to find messages that are part of the same conversation (the
original message and all replies).
✦Archive messages you no longer need: Archiving is a good way to strip
the Inbox folder of items that you don’t need. See Chapter 1 of this mini-
book for more about archiving.
✦Use the Mailbox Cleanup command: This handy command archives
messages, deletes them, and deletes alternate versions of messages.
See Chapter 1 of this mini-book for more about this command.
Flagging e-mail messages
One way to call attention to e-mail messages is to flag them. As shown in
Figure 3-13, you can make color-coded flags appear in the Inbox window. You
can use red flags, for example, to mark urgent messages and green flags to
mark the not-so-important ones. Which color you flag a message with is up
to you. Outlook offers six colors. As Figure 3-13 shows, you can click the Sort
by Flag Status button in the Inbox window to arrange messages in color-
coded flag order.

Follow these instructions to flag an e-mail message:
✦Starting in the Message window: Click the Follow Up button and choose
a flag (see Figure 3-13). If the color you prefer isn’t showing, choose
Custom. You see the Custom dialog box. From the Flag To drop-down
list, choose a follow-up notice, or else type one of your own in the text
box. The notice appears across the top of the e-mail message in the
Message window.
✦Starting in the Inbox folder: Select the message, click the Follow Up
button, and choose a flag color. You can also right-click, choose Follow
Up, and choose a flag color.
To “unflag” a message, right-click it and choose Follow Up➪Clear Flag. You
can also right-click and choose Follow Up➪Mark Complete to put a check-
mark where the flag used to be and remind yourself that you’re done with
the message. Later in this chapter, “Earmarking messages as they arrive,”
explains how you can flag messages automatically as they arrive.
Being reminded to take care of e-mail messages
If you know your way around the Calendar and Tasks windows, you know
that the Reminder message box appears when an appointment or meeting is
Flag a message.
Click to sort messages by flag.

about to take place or a task deadline is about to fall. What you probably
don’t know, however, is that you can put the Reminders dialog box to work
in regard to e-mail messages by following these steps:
1. Select the message.
2. Click the Follow Up button and choose Add Reminder.
You see the Custom dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-14. You can also
right-click a message and choose Follow Up➪Add Reminder to see the
dialog box.
3. On the Flag To drop-down list, choose an option that describes why
the e-mail message needs your attention later, or if none of the
options suits you, enter a description in the Flag To text box.
The description you choose or enter appears above the message in the
Reading pane, and message window, as well in the Reminder message
box, as shown in Figure 3-14.
4. Choose the date and time that you want the Reminder message box to
appear.
As Chapter 5 of this mini-book explains in detail, the Reminder message
box appears 15 minutes before the date and time you enter.
5. Click OK.
When the reminder falls due, you see the Reminder message box, as
shown in Figure 3-14, where you can click the Open Item button to open

the e-mail message. See Chapter 5 of this mini-book if you need to find
out how the Reminder message box works.
Earmarking messages as they arrive
To help you organize messages better, Outlook gives you the opportunity to
mark messages in various ways and even move messages as they arrive
automatically to folders apart from the Inbox folder. Being able to move mes-
sages immediately to a folder is a great way to keep e-mail concerning differ-
ent projects separate. If you belong to a newsgroup that sends many messages
per day, being able to move those messages instantly into their own folder is
a real blessing because newsgroup messages have a habit of cluttering the
Inbox folder.
To earmark messages for special treatment, Outlook has you create so-called
rules. To create a rule, start by trying out the Create Rule command, and if
that doesn’t work, test-drive the more powerful Rules Wizard.
Simple rules with the Create Rule command
Use the Create Rule command to be alerted when e-mail arrives from a cer-
tain person or the Subject line of a message includes a certain word. You can
make the incoming message appear in the New Item Alerts window (as shown
at the top of Figure 3-15), play a sound when the message arrives, or move
the message automatically to a certain folder.
Figure 3-15:
The New
Item Alerts
window
(top) and
Create Rule
dialog box
(bottom).

All about E-Mail Folders
342
Follow these steps to create a simple rule:
1. If you want to be alerted when e-mail arrives from a certain person,
find an e-mail message from the person, right-click it, and choose Create
Rule; otherwise, click the Create Rule button.
You see the Create Rule dialog box, as shown at the bottom of Figure 3-15.
2. Fill in the dialog box and click OK.
These commands are self-explanatory.
Another way to create a simple rule is to choose Tools➪Organize. The Ways
to Organize Inbox panel appears. Starting here, you can move messages from
a certain person to a folder or color-code messages as they arrive from a cer-
tain person.
Creating complex rules with the Rules Wizard
Use the Rules Wizard to create complex rules that earmark messages with
words in the message body or earmark messages sent to distribution lists.
You can also create a rule to flag messages automatically or delete a conver-
sation (the original message and all replies).
To run the Rules Wizard, choose Tools➪Rules and Alerts. You see the Rules
and Alerts dialog box. Click the New Rule button and keep clicking Next in the
Rules Wizard dialog boxes as you complete the two steps to create a rule:
✦Step 1: Choose the rule you want to create or how you want to be
alerted in the New Item Alerts window (refer to Figure 3-15).
✦Step 2: Click a hyperlink to open a dialog box and describe the rule. For
example, click the Specific Words link to open the Search Text dialog box
and enter the words that earmark a message. Click the Specified link to
open the Rules and Alerts dialog box and choose a folder to move the mes-
sages to. You must click each link in the Step 2 box to describe the rule.
To edit a rule, double-click it in the Rules and Alerts dialog box and complete
Steps 1 and 2 all over again.
All about E-Mail Folders
Where Outlook e-mail is concerned, everything has its place and everything
has its folder. E-mail messages land in the Inbox folder when they arrive.
Messages you write go to the Outbox folder until you send them. Copies of
e-mail messages you send are kept in the Sent Items folder. And you can
create folders of your own for storing e-mail.

Book III
Chapter 3
Handling Your 
E-Mail
All about E-Mail Folders
343
If you’re one of those unlucky people who receive numerous e-mail messages
each day, you owe it to yourself to create folders in which to organize e-mail
messages. Create one folder for each project you’re working on. That way,
you know where to find e-mail messages when you want to reply to or delete
them. These pages explain how to move e-mail messages between folders
and create folders of your own for storing e-mail.
Moving e-mail messages to different folders
Click to select the message you want to move and use one of these tech-
niques to move an e-mail message to a different folder:
✦With the Move to Folder button: Click the Move to Folder button, and
on the drop-down list, select a folder. The Move to Folder button is
located on the Standard toolbar to the right of the Print button.
✦With the Move to Folder command: Choose Edit➪Move to Folder, press
Ctrl+Shift+V, or right-click and choose Move to Folder. You see the Move
Items dialog box. Select a folder and click OK.
✦By dragging: Click the Folder List button, if necessary, to see all the fold-
ers; then drag the e-mail message into a different folder.
Earlier in this chapter, “Earmarking messages as they arrive” explains how to
move e-mail messages automatically to folders as they are sent to you.
Creating a new folder for storing e-mail
Follow these steps to create a new folder:
1. Choose File➪New➪Folder.
You see the Create New Folder dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-16. You
can also open this dialog box by pressing Ctrl+Shift+E or right-clicking a
folder in the Folder List and choosing New Folder.
2. Select the folder that the new folder will go inside.
For example, to create a first-level folder, select Personal Folders.
3. Enter a name for the folder.
4. Click OK.
To delete a folder you created, select it and click the Delete button. Items in
the folder are deleted along with the folder itself. To rename a folder, right-
click it, choose Rename, and enter a new name.

Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort of)

Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort of)
Outlook maintains a folder called Junk E-Mail especially for storing junk
e-mail, or spam as the digital variety is sometimes called. E-mail messages
with certain words or phrases in the Subject line — for free!, money-back
guarantee, order now — are routed automatically to the Junk E-Mail folder,
where they needn’t bother you. What’s more, you can add senders’ names to
the Blocked Senders list and route mail from those senders straight into the
Junk E-Mail folder.
As nice as it is, the Junk E-Mail folder has one fatal flaw — sometimes a legiti-
mate e-mail message finds its way into the folder. From time to time, you
have to look in the Junk E-Mail folder to see whether something of value is in
there — and that sort of defeats the purpose of routing messages automati-
cally to the Junk E-Mail folder. You still have to look through all that junk
e-mail!
Realistically, the only way to prevent getting junk e-mail is to safeguard your
e-mail address. These pages explain the two ways to handle junk e-mail by
using the features inside Outlook and by taking preventative measures to
keep your e-mail address from falling into the wrong hands.

Getting Outlook’s help to prevent junk e-mail
Outlook maintains a Safe Senders and Blocked Senders list to help distinguish
e-mail from junk e-mail. To help Outlook recognize junk e-mail and route it to
the Junk E-Mail folder, you can take these measures to add addresses to the
lists:
✦Add a sender to the Safe Senders list: Senders on this list are deemed
legitimate, and their e-mail messages are always routed to the Inbox
folder. In the Message window, click the Safe Lists button and choose Add
Sender to Safe Senders List on the drop-down list. In a folder, right-click
and choose Junk E-Mail➪Add Sender to Safe Senders List. Choose this
option if you find a legitimate e-mail message in the Junk E-Mail folder.
✦Add a domain name to the Safe Senders list: A domain is the server
from which e-mails are sent or Web sites are hosted. In an e-mail address,
the domain name is the part of the address after the at (@) symbol. If
you trust e-mail messages from a certain domain, you can accept all
messages sent from it. In the Message window, click the Safe Lists button
and choose Add Sender’s Domain to Safe Senders List on the drop-down
list. In a folder, right-click and choose Junk E-Mail➪Add Sender’s Domain
to Safe Senders List. In my opinion, this command is useless, as junk
e-mailers can commandeer people’s e-mail addresses in any domain.
✦Add an address to the Blocked Senders list: E-mail from senders on the
Blocked Senders list goes straight to the Junk E-Mail folder. In the Message
window, click the Blocked Sender button. In a folder, right-click and
choose Junk E-Mail➪Add Sender to Blocked Senders List.
If you accidentally add an address to the Safe Senders or Blocked Senders
list, you can remove it from the list. Choose Tools➪Options and click the
Junk E-Mail button on the Preferences tab of the Options dialog box. You
land in the Junk E-Mail Options dialog box. On the Safe Senders or Blocked
Senders tab, select the address and click the Remove button.
Follow these steps to tell Outlook how carefully to look for incoming junk
e-mail:
1. Choose Tools➪Options to open the Options dialog box.
2. On the Preferences tab, click the Junk E-Mail button.
You see the Junk E-Mail Options dialog box.
3. On the Options tab, choose options to tell Outlook how diligently to

Preventative medicine for junk e-mail
As zealous as Outlook is about preventing junk e-mail, the program can’t
really do the job. Junk e-mailers change addresses frequently. They are
clever about putting words in the subject lines of their messages so that the
messages aren’t recognized as spam. The only foolproof way to keep your
e-mail address free of junk e-mail is to safeguard your address. These pages
explain how junk e-mailers obtain addresses and show you how to keep your
address out of their hands.
How junk e-mailers obtain e-mail addresses
Junk e-mailers can’t send spam unless they have e-mail addresses and lots of
them. They obtain addresses in different ways. Knowing how they get e-mail
addresses can help you keep your address from falling into their clutches.
Here are the ways that spammers acquire addresses:
✦Purchasing e-mail address lists: These lists are for sale on the Internet.
Try searching for “bulk e-mail list” to see what I mean. The people who
sell the lists claim that the addresses are “opt-in,” meaning that addressees
opted, or chose, to make their e-mail addresses available to others. If
you ever signed up for something on the Internet and checked the box
that said, “I agree to receive offers and opportunities via e-mail from our
advertisers,” your address is on at least one junk e-mail address list.
✦Running spamware: Spamware is software designed to assist spammers.
Some kinds of spamware can gather addresses from Web sites, news-
groups, and message boards. This software looks for the at symbol (@)
on Web pages, copies the words on either side of the at symbol, and in
so doing collects e-mail addresses.
✦Collecting addresses on the Internet: Some Web sites are actually traps
meant to collect e-mail addresses. If you voted for something online,
entered a contest or sweepstakes, or took a quiz that required entering
your e-mail address, you made your address available to spammers.
✦Mounting a dictionary attack: In a dictionary attack, names and randomly
generated numbers are combined with msn.com, compuserve.com, or
another e-mail domain name to form e-mail addresses, and the addresses
are sent a test message. If the test message is returned as undeliverable —
if it bounces, to use e-mail terminology — the address is discarded. But if
the test message is delivered, the address is known to be “live.” Spam
messages are then sent to all live addresses at the e-mail domain.
Preventing junk e-mail from reaching your Inbox
By following the simple rules I describe here, you can keep spammers from
discovering your e-mail address and prevent junk-mail from arriving in your

Book III
Chapter 3
Handling Your 
E-Mail
Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort of)
347
Inbox. These rules are easy to follow. All you have to do is remember them
and stick to them:
✦Use a secondary e-mail address: Create a secondary e-mail account and
give its e-mail address to businesses and merchants on the Internet who
might sell your address to spammers or might themselves be spammers.
The Internet offers many places to create free Web-based e-mail accounts.
For example, check out Gmail (http://gmail.google.com), Hotmail
(www.hotmail.com), and Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com).
Never give your primary e-mail address to strangers.
✦Don’t reply to spam: Don’t reply to junk e-mail messages under any cir-
cumstances. By replying, all you do is alert the spammer to the fact that
your e-mail address is legitimate, and that makes you a target of even
more spam.
✦Don’t unsubscribe to junk e-mail messages: Some spam messages con-
tain an Unsubscribe link that you can click to prevent more messages
from coming. The links are a ruse. All you do by clicking them is make
spammers aware that your e-mail address is live and therefore, worth
targeting with more spam.
✦Don’t buy anything advertised by spam: Even if the message is selling
what looks to be a terrific bargain, resist the temptation. By buying, you
expose yourself to all the risks of replying to junk e-mail.
✦Don’t be fooled by sneaky spam: Junk e-mailers are very good about
disguising what they do. They have to be because spam-filtering soft-
ware is good at recognizing it. When certain words — sale, free, bargain,
and others — appear in the subject line of messages or in the messages
themselves, Outlook flags them automatically as junk e-mail. To get
around this obstacle, spammers sometimes write business-like message
headings to trick you into opening messages: This Needs Your Attention,
Urgent and Confidential, Meeting Agenda. Some message headings play
on the fact that many people order items online: Your Order #31334,
Confirmation of Purchase.
✦Be careful where (and how) you post your e-mail address: Spammers
gather e-mail addresses from the Internet. They get the addresses from
Web pages, newsgroups, chat rooms, and message boards. Harvestware,
a variety of spamware, can scour the Internet for the tell-tale at symbol
(@) found in e-mail addresses and copy those addresses back to a spam-
mer’s computer. If you have to post your e-mail address on the Internet,
get around the problem by putting blank spaces between the letters in
your address, or spell out the address like so:
johndoe at earthlink dot net

Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort of)
348
✦Try to choose an address that’s not subject to dictionary attacks: As I
explain earlier in this chapter, a dictionary attack is a technique spam-
mers use to generate e-mail addresses. To generate them, common
names are randomly assigned number combinations and then joined to
a domain name. To keep your e-mail address from being subjected to
dictionary attacks, choose an uncommon name for your address.

 Customizing the Calendar window
T
he purpose of the Outlook Calendar is to keep you from arriving a day
late and a dollar short. Use the Calendar to schedule meetings and
appointments. Use it to make the most of your time. This chapter explains
how to go from day to day, week to week, and month to month in the Calendar
window. It shows you how to schedule and reschedule appointments and
meetings, look at your schedule in different ways, and customize the
Calendar.
Introducing the Calendar
Use the Calendar to juggle appointments and meetings, remind yourself
where you’re supposed to be, and get there on time. Surveying your sched-
ule in the Calendar window is easy. Merely by clicking a button, you can tell
where you’re supposed to be today, any given day, this week, this work
week, this month, or any month. Figure 4-1 shows, for example, someone’s
schedule during the work week of August 14–18 (a work week comprises
Monday through Friday, not Monday through Sunday). All you have to do to
find out how busy you are on a particular day, week, or month is gaze at the
Calendar window. Whether someone invites you to a meeting or wants to
schedule an appointment, you can open the Calendar and see right away if
your schedule permits you to attend the meeting or make the appointment.

The Different Kinds of Activities
350
Outlook gives you opportunities to categorize meetings and appointments
so that you can tell at a glance what they’re all about. Moving a meeting or
appointment is simply a matter of dragging it elsewhere in the Calendar
window. By double-clicking a meeting or appointment in the Calendar window,
you can open a window to find out where the meeting takes place or read
notes you jotted down about the meeting. You can even make a bell ring 
and the Reminder message box appear when a meeting or appointment is
forthcoming.
To make the Task List, an abbreviated Tasks window, appear below the
Calendar window, choose View➪Daily Task List➪Normal. Chapter 5 of this
mini-book explains how to schedule tasks in the Tasks window.
The Different Kinds of Activities
For scheduling purposes, Outlook makes a distinction between appoint-
ments, events, and meetings. Meetings, however, aren’t everybody’s con-
cern. If your computer is connected to a network and the network uses the
Microsoft Exchange Server, you can use Outlook to invite colleagues on the
Date Navigator
Click to change views.

network to come to meetings. But if your computer isn’t on a network, don’t
bother with meetings. Schedule appointments and events instead. You can
schedule the following activities:
✦Appointment: An activity that occupies a certain time period on a cer-
tain day. For example, a meeting that takes place between 11 a.m. and
12 p.m. is an appointment.
✦Recurring appointment: An appointment that takes place daily, weekly,
or monthly on the same day and same time each day, week, or month. A
weekly staff meeting is a recurring appointment. The beauty of recurring
appointments is that Outlook enters them weeks and months in advance
in the Calendar window. You don’t have to re-enter these appointments
over and over.
✦Event: An activity that lasts all day. A trade show, for example, is an
event. A birthday is an event. A day spent on vacation is also an event
(is it ever!). On the Calendar, events and recurring events appear first.
✦Recurring event: An all-day activity that takes place each week, month,
or year. Unromantic (or forgetful) users of Outlook are hereby advised to
schedule these recurring events in the Calendar: Valentine’s Day, their
significant other’s birthday, and first-date and wedding anniversaries.
Thanks to Outlook, no one will ever accuse you again of being cold-
hearted or indifferent.
✦Meeting: Same as an appointment except that you can invite others to
attend. Scheduling meetings isn’t covered in this book. See your network
administrator for details.
Going to a Different Day, Week, or Month
Days on which meetings or appointments are scheduled appear in boldface
in the Date Navigator, the calendar in the upper-left corner of the window
(refer to Figure 4-1). Here are all the different ways to go to different days,
weeks, or months in the Calendar window:
✦To today: Click the Today button on the Standard toolbar.
✦To a specific day: Click a day in the Date Navigator. You can also press
Ctrl+G and select a day in the Go To Date dialog box. In some views, you
can press Alt+Page Up or Alt+Page Down to go backward or forward by a
month.
✦To a different month: Click an arrow beside the month name in the Date
Navigator to go backward or forward by a month. Here’s a quick way to
go from month to month in the Calendar: Click the month name in the
Date Navigator and hold down the mouse button. You see a list of month
names. Drag the pointer to the name of the month you want to go to.

Reconfiguring the Calendar
Unless you change settings, the Calendar work
week begins on Monday; in Day view and
Week view, the earliest timeslot you see before
you begin scrolling is 8:00 a.m. If these settings
don’t accurately reflect the days and hours in
which you work, you can change them by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
You see the Options dialog box.
2. On the Preferences tab, click the Calendar
Options button.
The Calendar Options dialog box appears.
3. Under Calendar Work Week, select the
day of the week on which your work
week starts, what you consider the first
day of the week, and what time you want
the Calendar to list first in Day view and
Week view.
4. Click OK in the Calendar Options dialog
box and then click OK in the Options
dialog box.

Use the scroll bar on the right side of the window to travel from hour to hour
in Day view and Work Week view. In Week view and Month view, manipulating
the scroll bar takes you from week to week.
Scheduling an Activity
Now that you know how the Calendar works, the next step is to fill the pages
of the Calendar with all kinds of busywork. These pages explain how to sched-
ule activities, schedule recurring activities, and magically transform an e-mail
message into a Calendar item. You can find many intriguing shortcuts on
these pages.
Scheduling an activity: The basics
Follow these basic steps to schedule an appointment, recurring appointment,
event, or recurring event:
1. Select the day in which you want to schedule the activity.
If the activity occupies a certain time period, you can select the time
period in Day or Week view and save yourself the trouble of entering a
time period in the Appointment dialog box. To select a time period, drag
downward in the Calendar window. To create a half-hour appointment,
simply double-click a half-hour slot in Day or Week view. The Appointment
dialog box opens with the Start and End time entered already.
2. Click the New Appointment button, press Ctrl+N, or choose
Actions➪New Appointment.
As shown in Figure 4-2, you see the Appointment window for naming the
activity, stating its starting and ending time, and choosing whether you
want to be alerted to its occurrence. When you double-click an appoint-
ment or event in the Calendar window, this is the window you see.
3. Enter information in the form.
Enter a subject, location (you can open the drop-down list and choose
one you’ve entered before), start date and time, and end date and time.
To enter a recurring event or appointment, click the Recurrence button.
To enter an event instead of an appointment, click the All Day Event
check box.
If the appointment time you enter conflicts with an appointment you’ve
already scheduled, the Appointment window tells you as much. You can
click the Calendar button to view the calendar and look for open timeslots.

Scheduling an Activity
354
4. Open the Reminder drop-down list and choose an option if you want
to be reminded when the activity is imminent (or choose None if you
don’t care to be reminded).
Choose an option from the drop-down list to make the Reminder mes-
sage box appear before the activity begins. Chapter 5 of this mini-book
explains how reminders work.
5. Click the Save & Close button when you’re finished describing the
appointment or event.
The appointment or event is entered in the Calendar window.
Scheduling a recurring appointment or event
To enter a recurring appointment or event, click the Recurrence button in
the Appointment window (refer to Figure 4-2). You see the Appointment
Recurrence dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-3. Describe how persistent the
activity is and click OK:
✦Appointment Time: Enter the starting and ending time, if you didn’t do
so already in the Appointment form.
✦Recurrence Pattern: Use the options and drop-down lists to describe
how often the activity recurs.

355
✦Range of Recurrence: Describe when the recurring events will cease
recurring. Choose the No End Date option button if the activity occurs ad
infinitum, ad nauseum (that’s Latin for “unto infinity, most nauseously”).
In the Calendar window, recurring activities are marked by the arrow chasing
its tail icon. To change a recurring activity into a one-time activity, click the
Recurrence button, and in the Appointment Recurrence dialog box, click the
Remove Recurrence button.
Scheduling an event
Select the All Day Event check box in the Appointment window (refer to
Figure 4-2) to schedule an event, not an appointment. As I explain earlier, an
event is an activity that lasts all day. You can choose Actions➪New All Day
Event to open the Event dialog box straightaway.
Canceling, Rescheduling, and Altering Activities
Canceling, rescheduling, and altering appointments and events are pretty
easy. You can always double-click an activity to open an Appointment or
Event window and change the particulars there. And you can take advantage
of these shortcuts:
✦Canceling: Select an activity and click the Delete button. When you
cancel a recurring activity, a dialog box asks whether you want to delete
all occurrences of the activity or just the activity on the day you
selected. Click an option button and click OK.

356
✦Rescheduling: Drag the activity to a new location on the schedule.
Release the mouse button when the activity is in the new timeslot.
✦Changing start and end times: In Day or Work Week view, move the
pointer over the top or bottom of the activity and start dragging when
you see the double arrow.
✦Changing the description: Click in the activity’s box and start typing or
editing.
Getting a Better View of Your Schedule
Here are the various and sundry ways to organize and view the activities you
so patiently entered in the Calendar window:
✦Change Calendar views: Click one of the three View buttons — Day,
Week (work week or full week), or Month — to read the fine print or get
the bird’s-eye view of activities you’ve scheduled in the Calendar window.
✦Change views of the Calendar window: Open the Current View drop-
down list and choose Events, Recurring Appointments, or another view
to isolate certain kinds of activities.
✦Categorize messages: Assign activities to categories and then arrange
activities by category in the Calendar window. To do so, choose By
Category in the Current View drop-down list. Chapter 1 of this mini-book
explains categorizing.
Using an e-mail message to 
schedule an appointment
Here’s a neat little trick that can save you time
when e-mail correspondence has to do with
scheduling an appointment. To get a head start
on scheduling, drag the e-mail message from
the Inbox window over the Calendar button on
the Navigation pane. On the theory that you
want to schedule an appointment around the
information in the e-mail message, the
Appointment window appears on-screen. For
the subject of the appointment, Outlook enters
the subject of the e-mail message. The text of
the e-mail message appears in the window as
well. Fiddle with the particulars of the appoint-
ment and click the Save & Close button.

his short chapter describes some Outlook goodies that were neglected
in the other chapters of this mini-book. It explains how the Tasks window
can help you meet your deadlines and how to be alerted when an activity is
looming, a task deadline is arriving, an e-mail needs your attention, or some-
one in your Contacts folder needs love and attention. Finally, it explains
Outlook’s digital stick ’em notes.
Tasks: Seeing What Needs to Get Done
As shown in Figure 5-1, use the Tasks window to see what needs to be done,
when it’s due, and whether it’s overdue. On this list, due dates clearly show
how smartly the whip is being cracked and how close you are to meeting or
missing deadlines. A gray line appears across tasks that are done. Tasks that
are overdue appear in red. Read on if you want to find out how to enter a
task, attach a file to a task, and manage tasks in the Tasks window.
The best way to examine tasks is to display the Reading pane and move it to
the bottom of the Tasks window. This way, you can select a task and read
notes you’ve made about it, as shown in Figure 5-1. To display the Reading
pane along the bottom of the Tasks window, choose View➪Reading Pane➪
Bottom.

Tasks: Seeing What Needs to Get Done

Entering a task in the Tasks window
Outlook offers two ways to enter a task in the Tasks window:
✦The fast way: Click at the top of the window where it says “Click here to
add a new Task,” type a few words to describe the task, press the Tab
key to go to the Due Date box, and enter the due date there. To enter the
date, type it or open the drop-down calendar and choose a date there.
✦The slow but thorough way: Click the New button, press Ctrl+N, or
choose Actions➪New Task. You see the Task window, as shown in
Figure 5-2. On this window are places for describing the task, entering
start and due dates, describing the task’s status, prioritizing the task,
and jotting down notes about it. Click the Save & Close button when
you’re finished describing the task.
Select a task.

By clicking the Recurrence button in the Task window, you can enter a
Sisyphean task that gets repeated over and over again. In the Task
Recurrence dialog box, describe how often the task recurs. Recurring tasks
are marked in the Tasks window with an unusual icon. What is that? Looks to
me like a clipboard with a piece of toilet paper stuck to it.
Click the Details button in the Task window to track the hours you worked
on a project, the companies you worked for, and how many miles you logged
going to and fro in your work.
Examining tasks in the Tasks window
Juggling many different tasks is a high art, and to help you get better at it,
the Tasks window offers these techniques for examining tasks that need
doing:

Attaching a file to a task
Attaching a file to a task is a neat way to get
down to work quickly. Instead of fumbling in
your computer for a Word document, Excel
worksheet, or other type of file to work on, you
can open it merely by double-clicking its name
in the Tasks window or Reading pane of the
Tasks folder. To attach a file to a task, go to the
Insert tab in the Task window and click the
Attach File button. Then, in the Insert File dialog
box, select the file and click the Insert button.

Reminders for Being Alerted to Activities and Tasks
362
✦Choose To-Do List or Tasks in the Tasks pane: Under My Tasks in the
upper-left corner of the Tasks window, choose To-Do List to examine all
tasks, including those you fashioned from e-mail messages and Calendar
appointments; choose Tasks to see only the tasks you set for yourself in
the Tasks folder.
✦Change views: In the Tasks pane or on the Current View drop-down list,
choose a View option. For example, choose Overdue Tasks or Next
Seven Days to focus on the tasks that really need doing.
Handling and managing tasks
When the time comes to manage the tasks in the Tasks window, I hope you
are a stern taskmaster. Here’s advice for handling and managing tasks:
✦Marking a task as complete: Click the check box beside the task name in
the Tasks window. Outlook draws a line through completed tasks.
✦Deleting a task: Select the task and then click the Delete button or press
Ctrl+D.
✦Editing a task: Double-click a task in the Tasks window to open the Task
window and change the particulars there.
Reminders for Being Alerted to Activities and Tasks
Outlook offers the Reminder message box to alert you when an appointment
or event from the Calendar is about to take place (see Chapter 4 of this mini-
book), when a task deadline is looming (see the preceding section in this chap-
ter), when an e-mail message needs a reply (see Chapter 3 of this mini-book),
or when someone whose name is in your Contacts folder needs attention (see
Chapter 2 of this mini-book). Figure 5-3 shows the Reminder message box.
When Outlook is running and you least expect it, a Reminder message box
similar to the one in the figure may appear to keep you on your toes.
Figure 5-3:

363
Do the following in the Reminder message box to handle a reminder:
✦Dismiss it: Click the Dismiss button to shelve the reminder notice. If
more than one notice appears in the Reminder message box and you
want to erase them all, click the Dismiss All button.
✦Be reminded later: Click the Snooze button. The Click Snooze to Be
Reminded Again In text box tells you when the next reminder message
will arrive. To change this setting, open the drop-down list and choose a
different time period.
✦Open the item: Click the Open Item button to examine the appointment,
task, e-mail message, or contact to which the reminder pertains.
✦Procrastinate: Click the Close button (the X) in the Reminder message
box to make it disappear. To open the message box later, choose
View➪Reminders Window.
Reminders work only for items that are stored in these folders: Tasks,
Calendar, Inbox, and Contacts. Store an item in another folder or a subfolder
of one of the folders I just named, and you won’t see the Reminder message
box when the reminder is due. To make sure you get reminded, store items
in these folders: Tasks, Calendar, Inbox, or Contacts.
Scheduling a reminder message
Follow these instructions to schedule a reminder message:
✦Calendar appointment or event: In the Appointment or Event window,
open the Reminder drop-down list and choose how many minutes, hours,
or weeks in advance to make the reminder appear.
✦Task deadline: In the Task window (refer to Figure 5-2), select the
Reminder check box and choose a time period in the drop-down list.
✦E-mail message: If you’re in the Message window, click the Follow Up
button and choose Add Reminder on the drop-down list; in the Inbox
window, right-click the message and choose Follow Up➪Add Reminder.
You see the Custom dialog box. Choose a date and time in the Start and
Due Date drop-down lists. If you enter a date but not a time, the
Reminder message box appears at 5:00 p.m.
✦Contacts name: In a Contact window, click the Follow Up button and
choose Add Reminder on the drop-down list; in the Contacts window,
right-click a contact name and choose Follow Up➪Add Reminder. The
Custom dialog box appears. Treat this dialog box the same way you treat
the one for e-mail messages (see the preceding item in this list).

Making Notes to Yourself
364
Making reminders work your way
You can do two or three things to make reminders work your way:
✦Changing the reminder time for appointments and events: By default,
the Reminder message box appears 15 minutes before appointments and
events start. To change this setting, choose Tools➪Options, and on the
Preferences tab of the Options dialog box, enter a new setting in the
Default Reminder drop-down list.
✦Changing the default time for task reminders: When a task’s deadline
arrives, the Reminders dialog box lets you know at 8:00 a.m. (or when
you start Outlook, if you start the program after 8:00 a.m.). To change
this default setting, choose Tools➪Options, and in the Preferences tab 
of the Options dialog box, choose a new time from the Reminder Time
drop-down list.
✦Play a different sound (or no sound): By default, you hear a little chime
when the Reminder message box appears on-screen. To hear a different
sound or no sound at all, choose Tools➪Options and then select the
Other tab in the Options dialog box. Next, click the Advanced Options
button, and in the Advanced Options dialog box, click the Reminder
Options button. You arrive — at last — at the Reminder Options dialog
box. To play no sound, deselect the Play Reminder Sound check box. To
play a different sound, click the Browse button and then select a .wav
sound file in the Reminder Sound File dialog box.
Making Notes to Yourself
As shown in Figure 5-4, notes resemble the yellow stick ’em notes that you
often see affixed to manuscripts and refrigerator doors. Click the Notes
button on the Navigation pane to go to the Notes window. Write a note to
mark down a deadline, for example, or remind you to take out the cat. Here
are instructions for doing all and sundry with notes:
✦Creating a note: Click the New Note button and then type the note in the
Note window. Then click outside the window.
✦Opening a note: Double-click a note to read it in its Note window.
✦Forwarding a note: To forward a note to someone in an e-mail message,
right-click the note and choose Forward. A Message window opens so
that you can address the message. The note arrives in the form of a file
attachment, and the recipient must have Outlook in order to read it.
✦Deleting a note: Select the note and click the Delete button or press the
Delete key.

t’s impossible to sit through a conference, seminar, or trade show these
days without seeing at least one PowerPoint presentation. PowerPoint
has found its way into nearly every office and boardroom. I’ve heard of a
man — a very unromantic man — who proposed to his wife by way of a
PowerPoint presentation.
As nice as PowerPoint can be, it has its detractors. If the software isn’t used
properly, it can come between the speaker and the audience. In an article in
the May 28, 2001, New Yorker titled “Absolute PowerPoint: Can a Software
Package Edit Our Thoughts?,” Ian Parker argued that PowerPoint may actu-
ally be more of a hindrance than a help in communicating. PowerPoint,
Parker wrote, is “a social instrument, turning middle managers into bullet-
point dandies.” The software, he added, “has a private, interior influence. It
edits ideas . . . . It helps you make a case, but also makes its own case about
how to organize information, how to look at the world.”
To make sure that you use PowerPoint wisely, this chapter shows what cre-
ating a PowerPoint presentation entails. After a brief tour of PowerPoint,
you find out how to create presentations, get a better view of your work,
insert slides, put together a photo album, and hide slides.

Getting Acquainted with PowerPoint
Figure 1-1 (top) shows the PowerPoint window. That thing in the middle 
is a slide, the PowerPoint word for an image that you show your audience.
Surrounding the slide are many tools for entering text and decorating slides.
When the time comes to show your slides, you dispense with the tools and
make the slide fill the screen, as shown in Figure 1-1 (bottom).
To make PowerPoint do your bidding, you need to know a little jargon:
✦Presentation: All the slides, from start to finish, that you show 
your audience. Sometimes presentations are called slides shows.
Presentations are saved in presentation files (.pptx files).
✦Slides: The images you create with PowerPoint. During a presentation,
slides appear on-screen one after the other. Don’t be put off by the word
slide and dreary memories of sitting through your uncle’s slide show
vacation memories. You don’t need a slide projector to show these
slides. You can now plug a laptop or other computer into special moni-
tors that display PowerPoint slides.
✦Notes: Printed pages that you, the speaker, write and print so that you
know what to say during a presentation. Only the speaker sees notes.
Chapter 5 in this mini-book explains notes.
✦Handout: Printed pages that you may give to the audience along 
with a presentation. A handout shows the slides in the presentation.
Handouts are also known by the somewhat derogatory term leave-
behinds. Chapter 5 of this mini-book explains handouts.
A Brief Geography Lesson
Here is a brief geography lesson about the different parts of a PowerPoint
screen. I’d hate for you to get lost in PowerPoint Land. Figure 1-2 shows the
different parts of the screen. Fold down the corner of this page so that you
can return here if screen terminology confuses you:
✦Office button: The round button you can click to open a menu with com-
mands for creating, opening, and saving PowerPoint presentations, as
well as doing other file-management tasks.
✦Quick Access toolbar: A toolbar with four buttons — Save, Undo,
Repeat, and Print. You see this toolbar wherever you go in PowerPoint.
✦Ribbon: The place where the tabs are located. Click a tab — Home,
Insert, Design, Animations, Slide Show, Review, or View — to start a task.

Creating a New Presentation
373
A Whirlwind Tour of PowerPoint
To help you understand what you’re getting into, you’re invited on a whirlwind
tour of PowerPoint. Creating a PowerPoint presentation entails completing
these basic tasks:
✦Creating the slides: After you create a new presentation, your next task
is to insert the slides. PowerPoint offers many preformatted slide lay-
outs, each one designed for presenting information a certain way.
✦Notes: As you create slides, you can jot down notes in the Notes pane.
You can use these notes later to formulate your presentation and decide
what you’re going to say to your audience while each slide is on-screen
(see Chapter 5 of this mini-book).
✦Designing your presentation: After you create a presentation, the next
step is to think about its appearance. You can change slides’ colors and
backgrounds, as well as choose a theme for your presentation — an all-
encompassing design that applies to all (or most of) the slides (see
Chapter 2 of this mini-book).
✦Inserting tables, charts, diagrams, and shapes: A PowerPoint presenta-
tion should be more than a loose collection of bulleted lists. Starting on
the Insert tab, you can place tables, charts, and diagrams on slides, as
well as adorn your slides with text boxes, WordArt images, and shapes
(see Chapter 4 of this mini-book).
✦“Animating” your slides: PowerPoint slides can play video and sound,
as well as be “animated” (see Chapter 4 of this mini-book). You can make
the items on a slide move on the screen. As a slide arrives, you can make
it spin or flash.
✦Delivering your presentation: During a presentation, you can draw on
the slides. You can also blank the screen and show slides out of order. In
case you can’t be there in person, PowerPoint gives you the opportunity
to create self-running presentations and presentations that others can
run on their own. You can also distribute presentations on CDs and post
them on the Internet (see Chapter 5 of this mini-book).
Creating a New Presentation
When you start PowerPoint, the program creates a new, blank presentation
just for you. You can make this bare-bones presentation the starting point
for constructing your presentation, or you can get a more sophisticated,
fully realized layout and design by starting with a template. Templates are a
mixed blessing. They’re designed by artists and they look very good. Some

Creating a New Presentation
374
templates come with boilerplate text — already written material that you can
recycle into your presentation. However, presentations made from templates
are harder to modify. Sometimes the design gets in the way. As well, a loud
or intricate background may overwhelm the diagram or chart you want to
put on a slide.
No matter what kind of presentation you want, you can start creating it by
clicking the Office button and choosing New on the menu (or pressing
Ctrl+N). You see the New Presentation dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-3.
Use one of these techniques to create a presentation:
✦Blank presentation: Double-click the Blank Presentation icon. A new
presentation appears. Try visiting the Design tab and choosing a theme
or background style to get a taste of all the things you can do to deco-
rate a presentation.
✦Presentation from a template: You have considerably more choices if
you want to create your presentation from a template:
Find a template.
Go forward or backward in your search.

• Use a template on your computer: Click Installed Templates (you can
find this button under Templates in the upper-right corner of the
dialog box). Templates that you loaded on your computer when you
installed PowerPoint appear in the dialog box. Double-click a tem-
plate to create a presentation.
• Search for a template online at Microsoft: Enter a search term in the
Search box, make sure your computer is connected to the Internet,
and click the Start Searching button. Templates appear in the dialog
box. Click a template to examine it. Double-click a template to down-
load and use it to create a presentation.
• Use a template you created (or downloaded earlier from Microsoft):
Click the My Templates button. The New Presentation dialog box
appears. Select a template and click OK.
• Select a recently used template: Click a template name in the middle of
the dialog box if you want to use a template listed there.
✦Recycle another presentation: If you can use another presentation as
the starting point for creating a new presentation, nab slides from the
other presentation. Click the New from Existing button. In the New from
Existing Presentation dialog box, select the presentation and click the
Create New button.
If you intend to create a presentation from photos you took of a vacation or
family reunion, consider creating a photo album. See “Putting Together a
Photo Album” later in this chapter.
Advice for Building Persuasive Presentations
Before you create any slides, think about what you want to communicate to
your audience. Your goal isn’t to dazzle the audience with your PowerPoint
skills, but communicate something — a company policy, the merits of a
product, the virtues of a strategic plan. Your goal is to bring the audience
around to your side. To that end, here is some practical advice for building
persuasive presentations:
✦Start by writing the text in Word: Start in Microsoft Word — not
PowerPoint — so you can focus on the words. In Word, you can clearly
see how a presentation develops. You can make sure that your presenta-
tion builds to its rightful conclusion. PowerPoint has a special command
for getting headings from a Word file. (See “Conjuring slides from Word
document headings” later in this chapter.)
✦When choosing a design, consider the audience: A presentation to the
American Casketmakers Association calls for a mute, quiet design; a

Advice for Building Persuasive Presentations
376
presentation to the Cheerleaders of Tomorrow calls for something bright
and splashy. Select a slide design that sets the tone for your presenta-
tion and wins the sympathy of the audience.
✦Keep it simple: To make sure that PowerPoint doesn’t upstage you, keep
it simple. Make use of the PowerPoint features, but do so judiciously. An
animation in the right place at the right time can serve a valuable pur-
pose. It can highlight an important part of a presentation and grab the
audience’s attention. But stuffing a presentation with too many gizmos
turns a presentation into a carnival sideshow and distracts from your
message.
✦Follow the one-slide-per-minute rule: At the very minimum, a slide
should stay on-screen for at least one minute. If you have 15 minutes to
speak, you’re allotted no more than 15 slides for your presentation,
according to the rule.
✦Beware the bullet point: Terse bullet points have their place in a pres-
entation, but if you put them there strictly to remind yourself what to
say next, you’re doing your audience a disfavor. Bullet points can cause
drowsiness. They can be a distraction. The audience skims the bullets
when it should be attending to your voice and the argument you’re
making. When you’re tempted to use a bulleted list, consider using a
table, chart, or diagram instead. Figure 1-4 demonstrates how a bulleted
list can be presented instead in a table, chart, or diagram.
✦Take control from the start: Spend the first minute introducing yourself
to the audience without running PowerPoint (or, if you do run PowerPoint,
put a simple slide with your company name or logo on-screen). Make
eye contact with the audience. This way, you establish your credibility.
You give the audience a chance to get to know you.
✦Make clear what you’re about: In the early going, state very clearly
what your presentation is about and what you intend to prove with your
presentation. In other words, state the conclusion at the beginning as
well as the end. This way, your audience knows exactly what you’re driv-
ing at and can judge your presentation according to how well you build
your case.
✦Personalize the presentation: Make the presentation a personal one.
Tell the audience what your personal reason for being there is or why
you work for the company you work for. Knowing that you have a per-
sonal stake in the presentation, the audience is more likely to trust 
you. The audience understands that you’re not a spokesperson, but a
speaker — someone who has come before them to make a case for
something that you believe in.

Book IV
Chapter 1

377
✦Tell a story: Include an anecdote in the presentation. Everybody loves a
pertinent and well-delivered story. This piece of advice is akin to the pre-
vious one about personalizing your presentation. Typically, a story illus-
trates a problem for people and how people solve the problem. Even if
your presentation concerns technology or an abstract subject, make it
about people. “The people in Shaker Heights needed faster Internet
access,” not, “the data switches in Shaker Heights just weren’t perform-
ing fast enough.”
Figure 1-4:

Creating New Slides for Your Presentation
378
✦Rehearse and then rehearse some more: The better you know your
material, the less nervous you are. To keep from getting nervous,
rehearse your presentation until you know it backward and forward.
Rehearse it out loud. Rehearse it while imagining you’re in the presence
of an audience.
✦Use visuals, not only words, to make your point: You really owe it to
your audience to take advantage of the table, chart, diagram, and pic-
ture capabilities of PowerPoint. People understand more from words
and pictures than they do from words alone. It’s up to you — not the
slides — as the speaker to describe topics in detail with words.
Want to see just how PowerPoint can suck the life and drama out of a dra-
matic presentation? Try visiting the Gettysburg PowerPoint Presentation, a
rendering of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address in PowerPoint. Yikes! You can find
it here: www.norvig.com/Gettysburg.
Creating New Slides for Your Presentation
After you create a presentation, your next step on the path to glory is to start
inserting the slides. As shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6, you can choose among
several different slide layouts, the preformatted slide designs that help you
enter text, graphics, and other things. Some layouts have text placeholder
frames for entering titles and text; some come with content placeholder frames
designed especially for inserting a table, chart, diagram, picture, clip-art
image, or video. When you insert a new slide, select the layout that best
approximates the slide you have in mind for your presentation. These pages
explain how to insert slides and harvest them from Word document headings.
Inserting a new slide
Follow these steps to insert a new slide in your presentation:
1. Select the slide that you want the new slide to go after.
In Normal view, select the slide on the Slides pane. In Slide Sorter view,
select the slide in the main window.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the bottom half of the New Slide button.
You see a drop-down list of slide layouts. (If you click the top half of the
Add Slide button, you insert a slide with the same layout as the one you
selected in Step 1.) Figures 1-5 and 1-6 show you what the slide layouts
look like (left), what a slide looks like right after you insert it (middle),
and finished slides (right).

Don’t worry too much about selecting the right layout. You can change
slide layouts later, as “Selecting a different layout for a slide” explains
later in this chapter.
Speed techniques for inserting slides
When you’re in a hurry, use these techniques to insert a slide:
✦Creating a duplicate slide: Select the slide or slides you want to dupli-
cate, and on the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the New Slide
button and choose Duplicate Selected Slides (or press Ctrl+M). You can
also right-click the space between two slides and choose New Slide on
the shortcut menu to create a duplicate of the slide above the place
where you right-clicked.
✦Copying and pasting slides: Click the slide you want to copy (or Ctrl+
click to select more than one slide) and then click the Copy button on
the Home tab (or press Ctrl+C). Next, click to select the slide that you
want the copied slide (or slides) to appear after and click the Paste
button (or press Ctrl+V).
✦Recycling slides from other presentations: Select the slide that you
want the recycled slides to follow in your presentation, and on the Home
tab, open the drop-down list on the New Slide button and then choose
Reuse Slides. The Reuse Slides task pane opens. Open the drop-down list
on the Browse button, choose Browse File, and select a presentation in
the Browse dialog box. The Reuse Slides task pane shows thumbnail ver-
sions of slides in the file you selected. One at a time, click slides to add
them to your presentation. You can right-click a slide and choose Insert
All Slides to grab all the slides in the presentation.
Conjuring slides from Word document headings
If you think about it, Word headings are similar to slide titles. Headings, like
slide titles, introduce a new topic. If you know your way around Word and
you want to get a head start creating a PowerPoint presentation, you can
borrow the headings in a Word document for your PowerPoint slides. When
you import the headings from Word, you get one slide for each Level 1 heading
(headings given the Heading 1 style). Level 1 headings form the title of the
slides, Level 2 headings form first-level bullets, Level 3 headings form
second-level bullets, and so on. Paragraph text isn’t imported. Figure 1-7
shows what the headings from a Word document look like after they land in
a PowerPoint presentation.

Creating New Slides for Your Presentation
382
Follow these steps to use headings in a Word document to create slides in a
PowerPoint presentation:
1. In Normal view, click the Outline tab in the Slides pane.
The Outline tab displays slide text (see Figure 1-7). You get a better
sense of how headings from the Word document land in your presenta-
tion by viewing your presentation from the Outline tab.
2. Select the slide that the new slides from the Word document will
follow.
3. Click the Home tab.
4. Open the drop-down list on the New Slide button and choose Slides
from Outline.
You see the Insert Outline dialog box.
5. Select the Word document with the headings you want for your pres-
entation; then click the Insert button.
Depending on how many first-level headings are in the Word document,
you get a certain number of new slides. These slides probably need work.
The capitalization scheme — the way in which headings are capitalized —
in the Word document and your PowerPoint presentation may be different.
The Word text may need tweaking to make it suitable for a PowerPoint
presentation.
Each Level 1 heading in the Word document becomes a slide title in PowerPoint.

Selecting a different layout for a slide
If you mistakenly choose the wrong layout for a slide, all is not lost. You can
start all over. You can graft a new layout onto your slide with one of these
techniques:
✦On the Home tab, click the Layout button and then choose a layout on
the submenu.
✦Right-click the slide (being careful not to right-click a frame or object),
choose Layout on the drop-down list, and choose a layout on the 
submenu.
PowerPoint also offers the Reset command for giving a slide its original
layout after you’ve fiddled with it. If you’ve pushed a slide all out of shape
and you regret doing so, select your slide and click the Reset button on the
Home tab.
Getting a Better View of Your Work
Depending on the task at hand, some views are better than others. These
pages explain how to change views and the relative merits of Normal, Slide
Sorter, Notes Page, Slide Show, Slide Master, Handout Master, and Notes
Master view.
Changing views
PowerPoint offers two places to change views:
✦View buttons on the status bar: Click a View button — Normal, Slide
Sorter, or Slide Show — on the status bar to change views, as shown in
Figure 1-8.
✦View tab: Click the View tab and then click a button on the Presentation
Views group to change views, as shown in Figure 1-8.
Looking at the different views
Here is a survey of the different views with notes about when to use each one:
✦Normal/Outline view for fiddling with text: Switch to Normal view and
select the Outline tab in the Slides pane (refer to Figure 1-7) when you’re
entering or reading text. You can find the Outline tab at the top of the
Slides pane. The words appear in outline form. Normal/Outline view is
ideal for focusing on the words in a presentation.

Getting a Better View of Your Work
384
✦Normal/Slides view for examining slides: Switch to Normal view and
select the Slides tab in the Slides pane when you want to examine a
slide. In this view, thumbnail slides appear in the Slides pane, and you
can see your slide in all its glory in the middle of the screen.
✦Slide Sorter view for moving and deleting slides: In Slide Sorter view,
you see thumbnails of all the slides in the presentation. From here,
moving slides around is easy, and seeing many slides simultaneously
gives you a sense of whether the different slides are consistent with one
another and how the whole presentation is shaping up. The slides are
numbered so that you can see where they appear in a presentation.
✦Notes Page view for reading your speaker notes: In Notes Page view,
you see notes you’ve written to aid you in your presentation — if you’ve
written any. You can write notes in this view as well as in the Notes pane
in Normal view. Chapter 5 of this mini-book explains notes pages.
✦Slide Show view for giving a presentation: In Slide Show view, you see a
single slide. Not only that, but the slide fills the entire screen. This is
what your presentation looks like when you show it to an audience.
Click a View button on the View tab or status bar.
Figure 1-8:

385
✦The master views for a consistent presentation: The master views —
Slide Master, Handout Master, and Notes Master — are for handling
master styles, the formatting commands that pertain to all the slides in a
presentation, handouts, and notes. To switch to these views, visit the
View tab and click the appropriate button. Chapter 2 of this mini-book
looks into master slides and master styles.
Hiding and Displaying the Slides 
Pane and Notes Pane
In Normal view, the Slides pane with its slide thumbnails appears on the left
side of the screen, and the Notes pane appears on the bottom of the screen
so that you can scribble notes about presentations. Sometimes these panes
just take up valuable space. They clutter the screen and occupy real estate
that could be better used for formatting slides. Follow these instructions to
temporarily remove the Slides and Notes pane:
✦Removing the Notes pane: Move the pointer over the border between
the pane and the rest of the screen, and after the pointer changes to a
two-headed arrow, drag the border to the bottom of the screen.
✦Removing the Slides pane (and the Notes pane): Click the Close button
on the Slides pane. This button is located to the right of the Outline tab.
Clicking it removes the Notes pane as well as the Slides pane.
✦Restoring the Slides and Notes pane: On the View tab, click the Normal
button. You can also move the pointer to the left side or bottom of the
screen, and when you see the double-headed arrow, click and start drag-
ging toward the center of the screen.
You can change the size of either pane by moving the pointer over its border
and then clicking and dragging.
Selecting, Moving, and Deleting Slides
As a presentation takes shape, you have to move slides forward and back-
ward. Sometimes you have to delete a slide. And you can’t move or delete
slides until you select them first. Herewith are instructions for selecting,
moving, and deleting slides.
Selecting slides
The best place to select slides is Slide Sorter view (if you want to select sev-
eral at a time). Use one of these techniques to select slides:

Putting Together a Photo Album
386
✦Select one slide: Click the slide.
✦Select several different slides: Hold down the Ctrl key and click each
slide in the Slides pane or in Slide Sorter view.
✦Select several slides in succession: Hold down the Shift key and click
the first slide and then the last one.
✦Select a block of slides: Drag across the slides you want to select. Be
sure when you click and start dragging that you don’t click a slide.
Moving slides
To move or rearrange slides, you’re advised to go to Slide Sorter view. Select
the slide or slides you want to move and use one of these techniques to
move slides:
✦Dragging and dropping: Click the slides you selected and drag them to
a new location. You see the drag pointer, and in Slide Sorter view, a verti-
cal line shows you where the slide or slides will land when you release
the mouse button. On the Slides pane, a horizontal line appears between
slides to show you where the slide or slides will land when you release
the mouse button.
✦Cutting and pasting: On the Home tab, cut the slide or slides to the
Windows Clipboard (click the Cut button, press Ctrl+X, or right-click and
choose Cut). Then select the slide that you want the slide or slides to
appear after and give the Paste command (click the Paste button, press
Ctrl+V, or right-click and choose Paste). You can right-click between
slides and paste with precision.
Deleting slides
Before you delete a slide, think twice about deleting. Short of using the Undo
command, you can’t resuscitate a deleted slide. Select the slide or slides you
want to delete and use one of these techniques to delete slides:
✦On the Home tab, click the Delete button.
✦Press the Delete key.
✦Right-click and choose Delete Slide on the shortcut menu.
Putting Together a Photo Album
Photo album is just the PowerPoint term for inserting many photographs into
a presentation all at once. You don’t necessarily have to stuff the photo

Book IV
Chapter 1
Getting Started in
PowerPoint
Putting Together a Photo Album
387
album with travel or baby pictures for it to be a proper photo album. The
Photo Album is a wonderful feature because you can use it to dump a bunch
of photos in a PowerPoint presentation without having to create slides one
at a time, insert the photos, and endure the rest of the rigmarole. Create a
photo album to quickly place a bunch of photos on PowerPoint slides.
Creating your photo album
PowerPoint creates a new presentation for you when you create a photo
album. To start, take note of where on your computer the photos you want for
the album are. Then go to the Insert tab and click the Photo Album button.
You see the Photo Album dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-9. For such a little
thing, the Photo Album dialog box offers many opportunities for constructing
a PowerPoint presentation. Your first task is to decide which pictures you
want for your album. Then you choose a slide layout for the pictures.
Inserting pictures and creating slides
Here is the lowdown on choosing pictures for your photo album:
✦Inserting photos: Click the File/Disk button and choose photos in the
Insert New Pictures dialog box. You can select more than one photo at
a time by Ctrl+clicking in the dialog box. The filenames of photos you

Change the order of slides.
Choose a layout.

selected appear in the Pictures in Album box. Slide numbers appear as
well so that you know which photos are on which slides.
✦Inserting photos from a scanner or digital camera: Click the Scanner/
Camera button. You see the Insert Picture from Scanner or Camera
dialog box. See Book VIII, Chapter 3 for details.
✦Inserting a text box: Insert a text box if you want to enter commentary
in your photo album. In the Pictures in Album box, select the picture or
text box that you want your new text box to go after and then click the
New Text Box button. Later, you can go into your presentation and edit
the placeholder text, which PowerPoint aptly enters as Text Box.
✦Providing captions for all pictures: To place a caption below all the 
pictures in your photo album, select the Captions Below ALL Pictures
check box. PowerPoint initially places the picture filename in the cap-
tion, but you can delete this caption and enter one of your own. (To
select this option, you must choose any picture layout except Fit to
Slide.)
✦Changing the order of pictures: Select a picture in the Pictures in
Album box and then click an arrow button to move it forward or back-
ward in the presentation.
✦Changing the order of slides: Ctrl+click to select each picture on a slide.
Then click an arrow as many times as necessary to move the slide for-
ward or backward in the presentation.
✦Removing a picture: Select a picture in the Pictures in Album box and
click the Remove button to remove it from your photo album. You can
Ctrl+click pictures to select more than one.
Choosing a layout for slides
Your next task is to go to the bottom of the Photo Album dialog box (refer 
to Figure 1-9) to choose a layout for the slides in the presentation. Open the
Picture Layout drop-down list to choose one of the seven picture layouts for
your slides:
✦Choose Fit to Slide for a presentation in which each picture occupies an
entire slide.
✦Choose a “pictures” option to fit 1, 2, or 4 pictures on each slide.
✦Choose a “pictures with” option to fit 1, 2, or 4 pictures as well as a text
title frame on each slide.

Changing the look of pictures
The Photo Album dialog box (refer to Figure 1-9) offers a handful of tools for
changing the look of the pictures. When you use these tools, keep your eye
on the Preview box — it shows you what you’re doing to your picture.
✦Making all photos black and white: Select the ALL Pictures Black and
White check box.
✦Rotating pictures: Click a Rotate button to rotate the picture clockwise
or counterclockwise.
✦Changing the contrast: Click a Contrast button to sharpen or mute the
light and dark colors or shades in the picture.
✦Changing the brightness: Click a Brightness button to make the graphic
brighter or more somber.
✦Choosing a frame shape for pictures: If you opted for a “picture” or
“picture with” slide layout, you can choose a shape — Beveled, Oval, or
others — for your pictures on the Frame Shape drop-down list. The pre-
view slide in the dialog box shows what your choice means in real
terms.
✦Choosing a theme for your photo album: If you selected a “picture” or
“picture with” slide layout, you can choose a theme for your slide pres-
entation. Click the Browse button and choose a theme in the Choose
Theme dialog box.
At last, click the Create button when you’re ready to create the photo album.
PowerPoint attaches a title slide to the start of the album that says, Photo
Album with your name below.
Putting on the final touches
Depending on the options you chose for your photo album, it needs all or
some of these final touches:
✦Fix the title slide: Your title slide should probably say more than the
words Photo Album and your name.
✦Fill in the text boxes: If you entered text boxes in your album, by all
means, replace PowerPoint’s generic text with meaningful words of
your own.
✦Write the captions: If you asked for photo captions, PowerPoint entered
photo filenames below photos. Replace those filenames with something
more descriptive.

Editing your photo album
To go back into the Photo Album dialog box and rearrange the photos in
your album, go to the Insert tab, open the drop-down list on the Photo
Album button, and choose Edit Photo Album on the drop-down list. You see
the Edit Photo Album dialog box. It looks and works exactly like the Photo
Album dialog box (refer to Figure 1-9). Of course, you can also edit your
photo album by treating it like any other PowerPoint presentation. Change
the theme, fiddle with the slides, and do what you will to torture your photo
album into shape.
Hidden Slides for All Contingencies
Hide a slide when you want to keep it on hand “just in case” during a presen-
tation. Hidden slides don’t appear in slide shows unless you shout Ollie ollie
oxen free! and bring them out of hiding. Although you, the presenter, can see
hidden slides in Normal view and Slide Sorter view, where their slide num-
bers are crossed through, the audience doesn’t see them in the course of a
presentation unless you decide to show them. Create hidden slides if you
anticipate having to turn your presentation in a different direction — to
answer a question from the audience, prove your point more thoroughly, or
revisit a topic in more depth. Merely by right-clicking and choosing a couple
of commands, you can display a hidden slide in the course of a slide show.
Hiding a slide
The best place to put hidden slides is the end of a presentation where you
know you can find them. Follow these steps to hide slides:
1. Select the slide or slides that you want to hide.
2. On the Slide Show tab, click the Hide Slide button.
You can also right-click the slide and choose Hide Slide. Hidden slides’
numbers are boxed in the Slides pane and Slide Sorter window.
To unhide a slide, click the Hide Slide button again or right-click the slide in
the Slides pane or Slide Sorter window and choose Hide Slide on the short-
cut menu.
Showing a hidden slide during a presentation
Hidden slides don’t appear during the course of a presentation, but suppose
that the need arises to show one. Before showing a hidden slide, take careful

note of which slide you’re viewing now. You have to return to this slide after
viewing the hidden slide. Follow these steps to view a hidden slide during a
presentation:
1. Right-click the screen and choose Go to Slide.
You see a submenu with the titles of slides in your presentation. You can
tell which slides are hidden because their numbers are enclosed in
parentheses.
2. Select a hidden slide so that the audience can view it.
How do you resume your presentation after viewing the hidden slide? If you
look at only one hidden slide, you can right-click and choose Last Viewed on
the shortcut menu to return to the slide you saw before the hidden slide. If
you’ve viewed several hidden slides, right-click the screen, choose Go to
Slide, and select a slide to pick up where you left off.

for Your Presentation
In This Chapter
 Introducing themes and background styles
 Selecting and tweaking slide themes
 Creating a solid color, gradient, clip-art, picture, and texture slide
background
 Selecting a theme or background for specific slides
 Redesigning your presentation with master slides
F
rom your audience’s point of view, this chapter is the most important in
this mini-book. What your presentation looks like — which theme and
background style you select for the slides in your presentation — sets the
tone. The audience judges your presentation right away by the first slide it
sees. Seeing that first slide, audience members make a snap judgment as
to what your presentation is about and whether your presentation is worth
watching closely. When you fashion a look for your presentation, what you’re
really doing is declaring what you want to communicate to your audience.
This chapter explains how to fashion the appearance of slide backgrounds.
It examines what you need to consider when you select colors and designs
for backgrounds. You also discover how to select and customize a theme,
and how to create your own slide backgrounds with a solid (or transparent)
color, a two-color gradient blend, a clip-art image, or a picture. In this chap-
ter, I look into how to change the background of some but not all of the
slides in a presentation. I show you how to use master slides and master
styles to make sure that slides throughout your presentation are consistent
with one another.
Looking at Themes and Background Styles
What a presentation looks like is mostly a matter of slide backgrounds, and
when you select a background for slides, you start by selecting a theme.
A theme is a “canned” slide design. Themes are designed by graphic artists.
Most themes include sophisticated background patterns and colors. For

Looking at Themes and Background Styles
394
each theme, PowerPoint offers several alternative theme colors, fonts, and
background styles. As well, you can create a background of your own from a
single color, a gradient mixture of two colors, or a picture.
Figure 2-1 shows examples of themes. Themes range from the fairly simple
to the quite complex. When you installed PowerPoint on your computer,
you also installed a dozen or more themes, and you can acquire more
themes online from Microsoft and other places. After you select a theme
for your presentation, you can tweak it a little bit. You can do that by 
choosing a background style or by creating an entirely new background
of your own. Figure 2-2 shows examples of backgrounds you can create 
yourself. Self-made backgrounds are not as intrusive as themes. The risk
of the background overwhelming the lists, tables, charts, and other items
in the forefront of slides is less when you fashion a background style 
yourself.
More than any other design decision, what sets the tone for a presentation
are the colors you select for slide backgrounds. If the purpose of your pres-
entation is to show photographs you took on a vacation to Arizona’s Painted
Desert, select light-tone, hot colors for the slide backgrounds. If your presen-
tation is an aggressive sales pitch, consider a black background. There is no
universal color theory for selecting the right colors in a design because
everyone is different. Follow your intuition. It will lead you to the right back-
ground color choices.

themes.

Choosing a Theme for Your Presentation
395
Choosing a Theme for Your Presentation
After you initially select a theme, you can do one or two things to customize
it. These pages explain how to find and select a theme for your presentation
and diddle with a theme after you’ve selected it. By the way, you can find the
name of the theme that is currently in use on the left side of the status bar, in
case you’re curious about a theme you want to replace.
Selecting a theme
Use one of these techniques to select a new theme for your presentation:
✦Selecting a theme in the Themes gallery: On the Design tab, open
the Themes gallery and move the pointer over different themes to 
“live-preview” them, as shown in Figure 2-3. Click a theme to select it.
✦Borrowing a theme from another presentation: On the Design tab,
open the Themes gallery and click Browse for Themes (see Figure 2-3).
You see the Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box. Locate and
select a presentation with a theme you can commandeer for your pres-
entation and click the Apply button.
Tweaking a theme
Starting on the Design tab, you can customize a theme with these techniques:

Choosing a Theme for Your Presentation
396
✦Choosing a new set of colors: The easiest and best way to experiment
with customizing a theme is to select a different color set. Click the
Theme Colors button, slide the pointer over the different color sets on
the drop-down list, and see what effect they have on your slide.
✦Change the fonts: Click the Theme Fonts button and then choose a com-
bination of fonts on the drop-down list. The first font in each pair applies
to slide titles and the second to slide text. You can also choose Create
New Theme Fonts on the list and select theme fonts of your own.
✦Change theme effects: Click the Theme Effects button and choose a
theme effect on the drop-down list. A theme effect is a slight refinement
to a theme.
✦Choosing background style variation: Most themes offer background
style variations. Click the Background Styles button to open the
Background Styles gallery and select a style. The next section in this
chapter, “Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own,” explains how you
can create backgrounds similar to these, as well as how to create a
single-color, gradient, clip-art, picture, and texture background.
Suppose you regret customizing a theme. To get the original theme back, select
it again. Make like you were selecting a theme for the first time and select it in
the Themes gallery.
Move the pointer over a theme to “live-preview” it.

Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own
Besides a theme or background style, your other option for creating slide
backgrounds is to do it on your own. For a background, you can have a solid
color, a transparent color, a gradient blend of two colors, a picture, or a clip-
art image.
✦Solid color: A single, uniform color. You can adjust a color’s transparency
and in effect “bleach out” the color to push it farther into the background.
✦Gradient: A mixture of two colors with the colors blending into one
another.
✦Clip art: A clip-art image from the Microsoft Clip Organizer.
✦Picture: A photograph or graphic.
✦Texture: A uniform pattern that gives the impression that the slide is
displayed on a material such as cloth or stone.
How to create these kinds of slide backgrounds on your own is the subject of
the next several pages.
Using a solid (or transparent) color 
for the slide background
Using a solid or transparent color for the background gives your slides a
straightforward, honest look. Because all the slides are the same color or
transparent color, the audience can focus better on the presentation itself
rather than the razzle-dazzle. Follow these steps to use a solid or transpar-
ent color as the background:
1. On the Design tab, click the Background Styles button and choose
Format Background on the drop-down list.
You see the Format Background dialog box.
2. Select the Solid Fill option button.
3. Click the Color Picker button and choose a color on the drop-down list.
The muted theme colors are recommended because they look better in
the background, but you can select a standard color or click the More
Colors button and select a color in the Colors dialog box.
4. Drag the Transparency slider if you want a “bleached out” color
rather than a slide color.
At 0% transparency, you get a solid color; at 100%, you get no color at all.
5. Click the Apply to All button and then the Close button.
I sincerely hope you like your choice of colors, but if you don’t, try, try,
try again.

Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own

Selecting a gradient blend of two 
colors for the slide background
Gradient refers to how and where two or more colors grade, or blend, into
one another on a slide. As well as the standard linear gradient direction, you
can opt for a radial, rectangular, or path gradient direction, as shown in
Figure 2-4. Gradient backgrounds look terribly elegant. Using a gradient is an
excellent way to create an original background that looks different from all
the other presenter’s slide backgrounds.
To create a gradient background for slides, start on the Design tab, click the
Background Styles button, and choose Format Background on the drop-
down list. Then, in the Format Background dialog box, click the Gradient Fill
option button. You get a different set of options in the Format Background
dialog box:
✦The Type drop-down list tells PowerPoint what type of gradient you
want — Linear, Radial, Rectangular, or Path (see Figure 2-4). If you choose
the Linear option, you can select the angle at which the colors blend.
✦Stops indicate where on the slide colors blend. You choose one gradient
stop for each color you want.

Before you experiment with gradients, try opening the Preset Colors drop-
down list to see whether one of the ready-made gradient options does the
job for you.
Drag the Format Background dialog box to the left side of the screen so that
you can see your slide better and then follow these steps to create a gradi-
ent blend of the different colors:
1. Select Stop 1 on the Stops drop-down list; then click the Color button
and choose a color; then click the Add button.
2. Select Stop 2 on the Stops drop-down list, choose a color for it as well,
and click the Add button.
Now you’ve selected the two gradient colors. You can select more colors
if you want. Your next task is to tell PowerPoint where to blend the
colors.
3. Select Stop 1 on the Stop drop-down list and then drag the Stop
Position slider.
Watch how the slide on your screen changes as you drag.
4. Select Stop 2 on the Gradient Stops drop-down list and drag the Stop
Position slider.
Notice how the two colors blend on your slide. For Figure 2-4, I dragged
the slider to 50% for each stop color. I’ll wager you have to repeat Steps
3 and 4 several times until you find the right blend.
5. Open the Type drop-down list and choose a Gradient Direction
option: Linear, Radial, Rectangular, Path, or Shade from Title.
Refer to Figure 2-4 to see how these options look. If you choose Linear,
you can enter a degree measurement in the Angle box to change the
angle at which the colors blend. At 90 degrees, for example, they blend
horizontally across the slide; at 180 degrees, they blend vertically across
the slide.
6. Drag the Transparency slider to make the colors more or less 
transparent.
At 0% transparency, you get solid colors (except where they blend); at
100%, you get no color at all.
7. Click the Apply to All button.
Very likely, you have to experiment with stop colors and stop positions
until you blend the colors to your satisfaction. Good luck.

Placing a clip-art image in the slide background
As long as they’re on the pale side or you’ve made them semi-transparent,
clip-art images do fine for slide backgrounds. They look especially good in
title slides. Figure 2-5 shows examples of clip-art images as backgrounds.
As Book VIII, Chapter 4 explains, PowerPoint comes with numerous clip-art
images. You’re invited to place one in the background of your slides by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. On the Design tab, click the Background Styles button and choose
Format Background on the drop-down list.
The Format Background dialog box appears.
2. Click the Picture or Texture Fill option button.
3. Click the Clip Art button.
You see the Select Picture dialog box.
4. Find and select a clip-art image that you can use in the background of
your slides.
You can scroll through the clip-art images until you find a good one, enter
a search term in the Search Text box and click the Go button, or click the
Include Content from Office Online check box to search online at Microsoft
for a clip-art image. You can get hundreds of clip-art images this way.

5. In the Format Background dialog box, enter a Transparency 
measurement.
Drag the Transparency slider or enter a measurement in the box.
The higher the measurement, the more transparent the image is (see
Figure 2-5).
6. Enter measurements in the Offsets boxes to make your clip-art image
fill the slide.
7. Click the Apply to All button and then click Close.
There you have it. The clip-art image you selected lands in the slides’
backgrounds.
Using a graphic for a slide background
Figure 2-6 shows examples of graphics being used as slide backgrounds.
Select your graphic carefully. A graphic with too many colors — and that
includes the majority of color photographs — obscures the text and makes it
difficult to read. You can get around this problem by “recoloring” a graphic
to give it a uniform color tint, selecting a grayscale photograph, selecting a
photo with colors of a similar hue, or making the graphic semi-transparent,
but all in all, the best way to solve the problem of a graphic that obscures
the text is to start with a quiet, subdued graphic. (Book VIII, Chapter 3
explains all the ins and outs of using graphics in Office 2007.)
Figure 2-6:

grounds.

Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own

One more thing: Select a landscape-style graphic that is wider than it is tall.
PowerPoint expands graphics to make them fill the entire slide background.
If you select a skinny, portrait-style graphic, PowerPoint has to do a lot of
expanding to make the graphic fit on the slide, and you end up with a dis-
torted background image.
Follow these steps to use a graphic as a slide background:
1. On the Design tab, click the Background Styles button and choose
Format Background on the drop-down list.
You see the Format Background dialog box.
2. Click the Picture or Texture Fill option button.
3. Click the File button.
The Insert Picture dialog box appears.
4. Locate the graphic you want, select it, and click the Insert button.
The graphic lands on your slide.
5. Enter a Transparency measurement to make the graphic fade a bit
into the background.
Drag the slider or enter a measurement in the Transparency box. The
higher percentage measurement you enter, the more “bleached out”
the graphic is.
6. Using the Offsets text boxes, enter measurements to make your
graphic fit on the slides.
7. Click the Apply to All button.
How do you like your slide background? You may have to open the
Format Background dialog box again and play with the transparency set-
ting. Only the very lucky and the permanently blessed get it right the
first time.
Using a texture for a slide background
Yet another option for slide backgrounds is to use a texture. As shown in
Figure 2-7, a texture gives the impression that the slide is displayed on a
material such as cloth or stone. A texture can make for a very elegant slide
background. Follow these steps to use a texture as a slide background:
1. On the Design tab, click the Background Styles button and choose
Format Background on the drop-down list.
The Format Background dialog box appears.

2. Click the Picture or Texture Fill option button.
3. Click the Texture button and choose a texture on the drop-down list.
4. Enter a Transparency measurement to make the texture less imposing.
Drag the slider or enter a measurement in the Transparency box.
5. Click the Apply to All button and then click Close.
Changing the Background of 
a Single or Handful of Slides
To make a single slide (or a handful of slides) stand out in a presentation,
change their background style or theme. A different background tells your
audience that the slide being presented is a little different from the one
before it. Maybe it imparts important information. Maybe it introduces
another segment of the presentation. Use a different background style or
theme to mark a transition, indicate that your presentation has shifted gears,
or mark a milestone in your presentation.

Using Master Slides and Master Styles for a Consistent Design
404
Follow these steps to change the background of one or several slides in your
presentation:
1. In Slide Sorter view, select the slides that need a different look.
You can select more than one slide by Ctrl+clicking slides.
2. On the Design tab, choose a different theme or background for the
slides you selected.
How you do this depends on whether you’re working with a theme or a
slide background:
• Theme: In the Themes Gallery, select a different theme. (See “Choosing
a Theme for Your Presentation” earlier in this chapter for details.)
• Slide background: Make like you’re creating a background style for all
the slides (see “Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own” earlier in
this chapter) but click the Close button, not the Apply to All button,
in the Format Background dialog box.
When you assign a different theme to some of the slides in a presentation,
PowerPoint creates another Slide Master. You may be surprised to discover
that when you insert a new slide in your presentation, a second, third, or
fourth set of slide layouts appear on the Add Slide drop-down list. These
extra layouts appear because your presentation has more than one Slide
Master. The next section in this chapter, “Using Master Slides and Master
Styles for a Consistent Design,” explains what Slide Masters are.
Using Master Slides and Master 
Styles for a Consistent Design
Consistency is everything in a PowerPoint design. Consistency of design is a
sign of professionalism and care. In a consistent design, the fonts and font
sizes on slides are consistent from one slide to the next, the placeholder text
frames are in the same positions, and the text is aligned the same way across
different slides. In the bulleted lists, each entry is marked with the same
bullet character. If the corner of each slide shows a company logo, the logo
appears in the same position.
It would be torture to have to examine every slide to make sure it’s consis-
tent with the others. In the interest of consistency, PowerPoint offers master
styles and master slides. A master slide is a model slide from which the
slides in a presentation inherit their formats. A master style is a format
that applies to many different slides. Starting from a master slide, you can

change a master style and in so doing, reformat many slides the same way.
These pages explain how master slides can help you quickly redesign a 
presentation.
Switching to Slide Master view
To work with master slides, switch to Slide Master view, as shown in
Figure 2-8. From this view, you can start working with master slides:
1. Click the View tab.
2. Click the Slide Master button.
In Slide Master view, you can select a master slide in the Slides pane, format
styles on a master slide, and in this way reformat many different slides.
(Click the Close Master View, Normal, or Slide Sorter button when you
want to leave Slide Master view.)

Using Master Slides and Master Styles for a Consistent Design
406
Understanding master slides and master styles
Master slides are special, high-powered slides. Use master slides to deliver
the same formatting commands to many different slides. Whether the com-
mands affect all the slides in your presentation or merely a handful of slides
depends on whether you format the Slide Master (the topmost slide in Slide
Master view) or a layout (one of the other slides):
✦The Slide Master: The Slide Master is the first slide in the Slides pane in
Slide Master view (see Figure 2-8). It’s a little bigger than the master
slides, as befits its status as Emperor of All Slides. Formatting changes
you make to the Slide Master affect all the slides in your presentation.
When you select a theme for your presentation, what you’re really doing
is assigning a theme to the Slide Master. Because formatting commands
given to the Slide Master apply throughout a presentation, the theme
design and colors are applied to all slides. If you want a company logo
to appear on all your slides, place the logo on the Slide Master.
✦Layouts: As you probably know, you choose a slide layout — Title and
Content, for example — on the New Slide drop-down list to create a new
slide. PowerPoint provides one layout for each type of slide layout in
your presentation. By selecting and reformatting a layout in Slide Master
view, you can reformat all slides in your presentation that were created
with the same slide layout. For example, to change fonts, alignments,
and other formats on all slides that you created with the Title and Content
slide layout, select the Title and Content layout in Slide Master view and
then change master styles on the slide. Each layout controls its own
little fiefdom in a PowerPoint presentation — a fiefdom comprised of
slides created with the same slide layout.
✦Master styles: Each master slide — the Slide Master and each layout —
offers you the opportunity to click to edit master styles (refer to
Figure 2-8). The master style governs how text is formatted on slides.
By changing a master style on a master slide, you can change the look
of slides throughout a presentation. For example, by changing the
Master Title Style font, you can change fonts in all the slide titles in
your presentation.
The PowerPoint Slide Master–layouts–slides system is designed on the
“trickle down” theory. When you format a master style on the Slide Master,
formats trickle down to layouts and then to slides. When you format a
master style on a layout, the formats trickle down to slides you created
using the same slide layout. This chain-of-command relationship is designed
to work from the top down, with the master slide and layouts barking orders
to the slides below. In the interest of design consistency, slides take orders
from layouts, and layouts take orders from the Slide Master.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Fashioning a 
Look for Your
Presentation
Using Master Slides and Master Styles for a Consistent Design
407
In Slide Master view, you can move the pointer over a layout thumbnail in
the Slides pane to see a pop-up box that tells you the layout’s name and
which slides in your presentation “use” the layout. For example, a pop-up
box that reads “Title and Content Layout: used by slide(s) 2-3, 8” tells you
that slides 2 through 3 and 8 in your presentation are governed by the Title
and Content layout.
Editing a master slide
Now that you know the relationship among the Slide Master, layouts, and
slides, you’re ready to start editing master slides. To edit a master slide,
switch to Slide Master view, select a master slide, and change a master style.
To insert a graphic on a master slide, visit the Insert tab. On the Edit Master
tab, you can find commands for changing fonts, formatting paragraphs, and
aligning text.
Changing a master slide layout
Changing the layout of a master slide entails changing the position and size
of text frames and content frames as well as removing these frames:
✦Changing size of frames: Select the frame you want to change, and then
move the pointer over a frame handle on the corner, side, top or bottom
of the frame and drag when you see the double-headed arrow.
✦Moving frames: Move the pointer over the perimeter of a frame, click
when you see the four-headed arrow, and drag.
✦Removing a frame from the Slide Master: Click the perimeter of the
frame to select it and then press Delete.
✦Adding a frame to the Slide Master: On the Slide Master tab, click the
Master Layout button. You see the Master Layout dialog box. Select the
check box beside the name of each frame you want to add and click OK.

his chapter explains how to change the appearance of text, create text

text doesn’t fit in a text box or text placeholder frame. You also discover
how to align text, handle bulleted and numbered lists, and put a footer on all
or some of the slides in your presentation.
By the time you finish reading this chapter, if you read it all the way
through, you will be one of those people others turn to when they have a
PowerPoint question about entering text on slides. You’ll become a little
guru in your own right.
Entering Text
No presentation is complete without a word or two at least, which is why
the first thing you see when you add a new slide to a presentation are the
words “Click to add text.” As soon as you “click here,” those words of
instruction disappear, and you’re free to enter a title or text of your own.
Most slides include a text placeholder frame at the top for entering a slide
title; many slides also have another, larger text placeholder frame for enter-
ing a bulleted list.
As shown in Figure 3-1, the easiest way to enter text on slides is to click in
a text placeholder frame and start typing. The other way is to switch to
Normal view, select the Outline tab in the Slides pane (see Figure 3-1), and
enter text there. Text that you type next to a slide icon in the Outline pane is
then made the title of the slide.

Entering Text
410
Enter text on slides the same way you enter text in a Word document — by
wiggling your fingers over the keyboard. While you’re at it, you can change
fonts, the font size of text, and the color of text, as the following pages explain.
(Chapter 1 of this mini-book describes how to get the text for slides from the
headings in a Word document; Book I, Chapter 2 explains everything a sane
person needs to know about handling fonts.)
Choosing fonts for text
If you aren’t happy with the fonts in your presentation, you have three ways
to remedy the problem:
✦Dig in and choose new fonts on a slide-by-slide basis. Select the text,
go to the Home tab, and choose a font from the Font drop-down list or
the Font dialog box. You can also choose fonts on the Mini Toolbar.
✦Select new theme fonts for your presentation. Theme fonts are com-
binations of fonts that the designers of PowerPoint themes deem 
appropriate for the theme you’re working in. To change theme fonts, go
to the Design tab, click the Theme Fonts button, and select a new font
combination.
✦Choose a new font on a master slide to change fonts throughout your
presentation. Chapter 2 of this mini-book explains master slides and
how you can use them to change formats simultaneously on many
slides. In Slide Master view, select a master slide and change its fonts on
the Edit Master tab.

Changing the font size of text
For someone in the back row of an audience to be able to read text in a
PowerPoint presentation, the text should be no smaller than 28 points. Try
this simple test to see whether text in your presentation is large enough to
read: Stand five or so feet from your computer and see whether you can read
the text. If you can’t read it, make it larger.
Go to the Home tab and click in or select the text whose size you want to
change. Then use one of these techniques to change font sizes:
✦Font Size drop-down list: Open this list and choose a point size. To
choose a point size that isn’t on the list, click in the Font Size text box,
enter a point size, and press Enter.
✦Font dialog box: Click the Font group button to open the Font dialog
box. Then either choose a point size from the Size drop-down list or
enter a point size in the Size text box and click OK.
✦Increase Font Size and Decrease Font Size buttons: Click these buttons
(or press Ctrl+] or Ctrl+[) to increase or decrease the point size by the
next interval on the Font Size drop-down list. Watch the Font Size list or
your text and note how the text changes size. This is an excellent tech-
nique when you want to “eyeball it” and you don’t care to fool with the
Font Size list or Font dialog box.
Changing the color of text
Before you change the color of text, peer into your computer screen and
examine the background theme or color you selected for your slides. Unless
the color of the text is different from the theme or color, the audience can’t
read the text. Besides choosing a color that contributes to the overall tone
of the presentation, select a color that’s easy to read.
Select the text that needs touching up and then use one of these techniques
to change the color of text:
✦On the Mini Toolbar, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button
and choose a color.
✦On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button and
choose a color.
✦On the Home tab, click the Font group button to open the Font dialog
box, click the Font Color button in the dialog box, and choose a color on
the drop-down list.

The Font Color drop-down list offers theme colors and standard colors. You
are well advised to choose a theme color. These colors jive with the theme
you choose for your presentation.
Fun with Text Boxes and Text Box Shapes
Text boxes give you an opportunity to exercise your creativity. They add
another element to slides. Use them to position text wherever you want,
annotate a chart or equation, or place an announcement on a slide. You can
even create a vertical text box in which the text reads from top to bottom
instead of left to right, or turn a text box into a circle, arrow, or other shape.
Figure 3-2 shows examples of text boxes and text box shapes.
In Office 2007 terminology, a PowerPoint text box is an object. Book I,
Chapter 8 explains all the different techniques for handling objects, 
Fixing a top-heavy title
In typesetting terminology, a top-heavy title is a
title in which the first line is much longer than the
second. Whenever a title extends to two lines, it
runs the risk of being top-heavy. Unsightly top-
heavy titles look especially bad on PowerPoint
slides, where text is blown up to 40 points or
more. To fix a top-heavy title, click where you
prefer the lines to break and then press
Shift+Enter. Pressing Shift+Enter creates a hard
line break, a forced break at the end of one line.
(To remove a hard line break, click where the
break occurs and then press the Delete key.)
The only drawback of hard line breaks is remem-
bering where you made them. In effect, the line
breaks are invisible. When you edit a title with a
line break, the line break remains, and unless you
know it’s there, you discover the line breaking
in an odd place. The moral is: If you’re editing a
title and the text keeps moving to the next line,
you may have entered a hard line break and
forgotten about it.

including how to make them overlap and change their sizes. Here are the
basics of handling text boxes in PowerPoint:
✦Creating a text box: On the Insert tab, open the drop-down list on the
Text Box button and choose Horizontal or Vertical. Text in a horizontal
text box reads from left to right; in a vertical text box, text reads from top
to bottom or bottom to top (see Figure 3-2). Move the pointer to a part
of the slide where you can see the text box pointer, a downward-pointing
arrow. Click and start dragging to create your text box.
✦Rotating a text box: Use one of these techniques to rotate a text box:
• Drag the rotation handle, the green circle above the text box.
• On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Rotate button
and choose a Rotate or Flip command on the drop-down list.
(Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the
Arrange button first.)
• On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Size group button
(you may have to click the Size button first), and in the Size and
Position dialog box, enter a measurement in the Rotation box.
✦Changing the direction of text: Select the text in the text box, and on
the Home tab, click the Text Direction button and then choose an option
on the drop-down list.
✦Turning a shape into a text box: Create the shape, and then click in
the shape and start typing. (Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to create a
shape.)
✦Turning a text box into a shape: Right-click the text box and choose
Format Shape. In the Format Shape dialog box, click the Text Box cate-
gory, and under AutoFit, click the Do Not AutoFit option button. Then
close the dialog box, click the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Edit
Shape button, choose Change Shape on the drop-down list, and choose a
shape on the Change Shape submenu.

Controlling How Text Fits in Text Frames and Text Boxes
414
Many people object to the small text boxes that appear initially when you
create a text box. If you prefer to establish the size of text boxes when
you create them, not when you enter text, change the AutoFit setting and
then create a default text box with the new setting. The next section in this
chapter explains how to change the AutoFit settings.
Controlling How Text Fits in Text Frames and Text Boxes
When text doesn’t fit in a text placeholder frame or text box, PowerPoint
takes measures to make it fit. In a text frame, PowerPoint shrinks the
amount of space between lines and then it shrinks the text itself. When text
doesn’t fit in a text box, PowerPoint enlarges the text box to fit more text.
PowerPoint handles overflow text as part of its AutoFit mechanism.
How AutoFit works is up to you. If, like me, you don’t care for how PowerPoint
enlarges text boxes when you enter the text, you can tell PowerPoint not to
“AutoFit” text, but instead to make text boxes large from the get-go. And if you
don’t care for how PowerPoint shrinks text in placeholder text frames, you
can tell PowerPoint not to shrink text. These pages explain how to choose
AutoFit options for overflow text in your text frames and text boxes.
Choosing how PowerPoint “AutoFits” 
text in text frames
When text doesn’t fit in a text placeholder frame and PowerPoint has to
“AutoFit” the text, you see the AutoFit Options button. Click this button to
open a drop-down list with options for handling overflow text, as shown in
Figure 3-3. The AutoFit options — along with a couple of other techniques, as
I explain shortly — represent the “one at a time” way of handling overflow
text. You can also change the default AutoFit options for handling overflow text,
as I also explain if you’ll bear with me a while longer and quit your yawning.
“AutoFitting” the text one frame at a time
When text doesn’t fit in a text placeholder frame, especially a title frame,
the first question to ask is, “Do I want to fool with the integrity of the slide
design?” Making the text fit usually means shrinking the text, enlarging the
text frame, or compromising the slide design in some way, but audiences
notice design inconsistencies. Slides are shown on large screens where
design flaws are easy to see.
Making text fit in a text frame usually means making a compromise. Here are
different ways to handle the problem of text not fitting in a text frame. Be pre-
pared to click the Undo button when you experiment with these techniques:
✦Edit the text: Usually when text doesn’t fit in a frame, the text needs
editing. It needs to be made shorter. A slide is not a place for a treatise.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Entering the Text
Controlling How Text Fits in Text Frames and Text Boxes
415
Editing the text is the only way to make it fit in the frame without com-
promising the design.
✦Enlarge the frame: Click the AutoFit Options button and choose Stop
Fitting Text to This Placeholder on the shortcut menu (see Figure 3-3).
Then select the frame and drag the bottom or top selection handle to
enlarge it.
✦Decrease the font size: Select the text, go to the Home tab, and choose
a smaller Font Size measurement. You can also click the Decrease Font
Size button to decrease the font size.
✦Decrease the amount of spacing between lines: Click the Paragraph
group button on the Home tab to open the Paragraph dialog box and
decrease the After measurement under Spacing.
✦Change the frame’s internal margins: Similar to a page, text frames
have internal margins to keep text from getting too close to a frame
border. By shrinking these margins, you can make more room for text.
Right-click the text frame and choose Format Shape. Then, in the Text
Box category of the Format Shape dialog box, enter smaller measure-
ments for the Internal Margin boxes.
✦Create a new slide for the text: If you’re dealing with a list or paragraph
text in a body text frame, the AutoFit Options drop-down list offers two
ways to create a new slide (see Figure 3-3). Choose Continue on a New
Slide to run the text onto another slide; choose Split Text between Two
Slides to divide the text evenly between two slides. I don’t recommend
either option, though. If you need to make a new slide, do it on your own
and then rethink how to present the material. Inserting a new slide to
accommodate a long list throws a presentation off-track.
The AutoFit Options button appears
when text doesn’t fit in a text frame.

Choosing default AutoFit options for text frames
Unless you change the default AutoFit options, PowerPoint shrinks the
amount of space between lines and then shrinks the text itself to make text
fit in text placeholder frames. Follow these steps if you want to decide for
yourself whether PowerPoint “AutoFits” text in text frames:
1. Open the AutoFormat As You Type tab in the AutoCorrect dialog box.
Here are the two ways to get there:
• Click the AutoFit Options button (refer to Figure 3-3) and choose
Control AutoCorrect Options on the drop-down list.
• Click the Office button and choose PowerPoint Options to open the
PowerPoint Options dialog box. In the Proofing category, click the
AutoCorrect Options button.
2. Deselect the AutoFit Title Text to Placeholder check box to prevent
AutoFitting in title text placeholder frames.
3. Deselect the AutoFit Body Text to Placeholder check box to prevent
Autofitting in text placeholder frames apart from title frames.
4. Click OK.
Choosing how PowerPoint “AutoFits” 
text in text boxes
PowerPoint offers three options for handling overflow text in text boxes:
✦Do Not AutoFit: Doesn’t fit text in the text box but lets text spill out.
✦Shrink Text on Overflow: Shrinks the text to make it fit in the text box.
✦Resize Shape to Fit Text: Enlarges the text box to make the text fit
inside it.
Follow these steps to tell PowerPoint how or whether to fit text in text boxes:
1. Select the text box.
2. Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape.
You see the Format Shape dialog box.
3. Click the Text Box category.
4. Choose an AutoFit option: Do Not AutoFit, Shrink Text on Overflow, or
Resize Shape to Fit Text.
5. Click the Close button.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Entering the Text
Positioning Text in Frames and Text Boxes
417
Some people find it easier to dispense with “AutoFitting.” If you’re one of
those people, go to the Text Box category of the Format Shape dialog box,
and under AutoFit, choose the Do Not AutoFit option or the Shrink Text on
Overflow option. To make your AutoFit setting applicable to all the text
boxes you create in your presentation, right-click the text box and choose
Set As Default Text Box on the shortcut menu.
Positioning Text in Frames and Text Boxes
How text is positioned in text frames and text boxes is governed by two sets
of commands: the Align Text commands and the Align commands. By choos-
ing combinations of Align and Align Text commands, you can land text where
you want it in a text frame or text box. Just wrestle with these two commands
until you land your text where you want it to be in the text frame or box:
✦Align commands control horizontal (left-to-right) alignments. On the
Home tab, click the Align Left, Center, Align Right, or Justify button.
✦Align Text commands control vertical (up-and-down) alignments. On the
Home tab, click the Align Text button and choose Top, Middle, or Bottom
on the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 3-4.

Handling Bulleted and Numbered Lists
418
Distributing a title means to stretch it across a text frame or text box, from
the left to the right margin. As long as enough words are in the title to 
distribute it without making the title a shambles, a distributed title looks
rather interesting. To distribute a title, select it and click the Distributed
button on the Home tab.
Handling Bulleted and Numbered Lists
What is a PowerPoint presentation without a list or two? It’s like an emperor
without any clothes on. This part of the chapter explains everything there is
to know about bulleted and numbered lists.
These lists can be as simple or complex as you want them to be. PowerPoint
offers a bunch of different ways to format these lists, but if you’re in a hurry
or you don’t care whether your lists look like everyone else’s, you can take
advantage of the Numbering and Bullets buttons and go with standard lists.
Nonconformists and people with nothing else to do, however, can try their
hand at making fancy lists. The following pages cover that topic, too.
Creating a standard bulleted or numbered list
In typesetting terms, a bullet is a black, filled-in circle or other character
that marks an item on a list. Many slide layouts include text frames that are
already formatted for bulleted lists. All you have to do in these text frames
is “click to add text” and keep pressing the Enter key while you enter items
for your bulleted list. Each time you press Enter, PowerPoint adds another
bullet to the list. Bulleted lists are useful when you want to present the
reader with alternatives or present a list in which the items aren’t ranked in
any order. Use a numbered list to rank items in a list or present step-by-step
instructions.
Follow these instructions to create a standard bulleted or numbered list:
✦Creating a bulleted list: Select the list if you’ve already entered the list
items, click the Home tab, and click the Bullets button (or click the
Bullets button on the Mini Toolbar). You can also right-click, choose
Bullets on the shortcut menu, and choose a bullet character on the 
submenu if you don’t care for the standard, black, filled-in circle.
✦Creating a numbered list: Select the list if you’ve already entered the
list items, click the Home tab, and click the Numbering button. You can
also right-click, choose Numbering on the shortcut menu, and select a
numbering style on the submenu.
✦Converting a numbered to a bulleted list (or vice versa): Drag over
the list to select it, click the Home tab, and then click the Bullets or
Numbering button.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Entering the Text
Handling Bulleted and Numbered Lists
419
To remove the bullets or numbers from a list, select the list, right-click it,
choose Bullets or Numbering on the shortcut menu, and choose None on the
submenu.
Choosing a different bullet character, size, and color
As Figure 3-5 demonstrates, the black filled-in circle isn’t the only character
you can use to mark items in a bulleted list. You can also opt for what
PowerPoint calls pictures (colorful bullets of many sizes and shapes) or 
symbols from the Symbol dialog box. While you’re at it, you can change
the bullet color and size.
If you decide to change the bullet character in your lists, be consistent from
slide to slide. Unless you want to be goofy, select the same bullet character
throughout the lists in your presentation for the sake of consistency. You don’t
want to turn your slide presentation into a showcase for bullets, do you?
To use pictures or unusual symbols for bullets, start by selecting your bul-
leted list (if you already entered the list items), clicking the Home tab, and
opening the drop-down list on the Bullets button. Do any of the bullets on
the drop-down list tickle your fancy? If one does, choose it; otherwise, click
the Bullets and Numbering option at the bottom of the drop-down list. You
see the Bulleted tab of the Bullets and Numbering dialog box. Starting there,
you can customize your bullets:
✦Using a picture for bullets: Click the Picture button and select a bullet
in the Picture Bullet dialog box.
✦Using a symbol for bullets: Click the Customize button and select a bullet
in the Symbol dialog box. By opening the Font drop-down list and choos-
ing a Wingdings font, you can choose an oddball character for bullets.

for bulleted
lists.

Putting Footers (and Headers) on Slides
420
✦Changing bullets’ color: Click the Color button in the Bullets and
Numbering dialog box and choose an option on the drop-down list.
Theme colors are considered most compatible with the theme design
you choose for your presentation.
✦Changing bullets’ size: Enter a percentage figure in the Size % of Text
box. For example, if you enter 200, the bullets are twice as big as the font
size you choose for the items in your bulleted list.
Choosing a different list-numbering 
style, size, and color
PowerPoint offers seven different ways of numbering lists. As well as choosing
a different numbering style, you can change the size of numbers relative to
the text and change the color of numbers. To select a different list-numbering
style, size, or color, begin by selecting your list (if you already entered the
list items), clicking the Home tab, and opening the drop-down list on the
Numbering button. If you like one of the numbering-scheme choices, select
it; otherwise choose Bullets and Numbering to open the Numbered tab of the
Bullets and Numbering dialog box. In this dialog box, you can customize list
numbers:
✦Choosing a numbering scheme: Select a numbering scheme and click OK.
✦Changing the numbers’ color: Click the Color button and choose a color
on the drop-down list. Theme colors are more compatible with the
theme design you choose than the other colors are.
✦Changing the numbers’ size: Enter a percentage figure in the Size % of
Text box. For example, if you enter 50, the numbers are half as big as the
font size you choose for the items in your numbered list.
Putting Footers (and Headers) on Slides
A footer is a line of text that appears at the foot, or bottom, of a slide. Figure 3-6
shows a footer. Typically, a footer includes the date, a company name, and/or
a slide number, and footers appear on every slide in a presentation if they
appear at all. That doesn’t mean you can’t exclude a footer from a slide or
put footers on some slides, as I explain shortly. For that matter, you can
move slide numbers, company names, and dates to the top of slides, in
which case they become headers. When I was a kid, “header” meant crashing
your bike and falling headfirst over the handlebars. How times change.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Entering the Text
Putting Footers (and Headers) on Slides
421
These pages explain everything a body needs to know about footers and
headers — how to enter them, make them appear on all or some slides, and
exclude them from slides.
Some background on footers and headers
PowerPoint provides the Header & Footer command to enter the date,
a word or two, and/or a slide number on the bottom of all slides in your
presentation. This command is really just a convenient way for you to
enter a footer on the Slide Master without having to switch to Slide Master
view. As Chapter 2 in this mini-book explains, the Slide Master governs the
formatting and layout of all slides in your presentation. The Slide Master
includes text placeholder frames for a date, some text, and a slide number.
Anything you enter on the Slide Master, including a footer, appears on all
your slides.
If a date, some text, and/or a slide number along the bottom of all the slides
in your presentation is precisely what you want, you’ve got it made. You can
enter a footer on every slide in your presentation with no trouble at all by
using the Header & Footer command. However, if you’re a maverick and you
want your footers and headers to be a little different from the next guy’s —
if you want the date, for example, to be in the upper-right corner of slides or
you want footers to appear on some slides but not others — you have some
tweaking to do. You may have to create a nonstandard footer or remove the
footer from some of the slides.
Figure 3-6:
An example
of a footer.

Putting Footers (and Headers) on Slides
422
Putting a standard footer on all your slides
A standard footer includes the date, some text, and/or the page number.
To put a standard footer on all the slides in your presentation, click the
Insert tab and then click the Header & Footer button. You see the Header
and Footer dialog box. Choose some or all of these options to enter a footer:
✦Date and Time: Select this check box to make the date appear in the
lower-left corner of all your slides. Then tell PowerPoint whether you
want a current or fixed date:
• Update Automatically: Select this option button to make the day’s
date (or date and time) appear in the footer and then open the drop-
down list to choose a date (or date and time) format. With this option,
the date you give your presentation always appears on slides.
• Fixed: Select this option button and enter a date in the text box.
For example, enter the date you created the presentation. With this
option, the date remains the same no matter when or where you give
the presentation.
✦Slide Number: Select this check box to make slide numbers appear in
the lower-right corner of all slides.
✦Footer: Select this check box, and in the text box, enter the words that
you want to appear in the bottom, middle of all the slides.
Creating a nonstandard footer
As “Some background on footers and headers” explains earlier in this chap-
ter, you have to look elsewhere than the Header and Footer dialog box if you
want to create something besides the standard footer. Suppose you want
to move the slide number from the lower-right corner of slides to another
position? Or you want to fool with the fonts in headers and footers?
Follow these steps to create a nonstandard footer:
1. Create a standard footer if you want your nonstandard footer to
include today’s date and/or a slide number.
If you want to move the slide number into the upper-right corner of
slides, for example, create a standard footer first (see the preceding sec-
tion in this chapter). Later, you can move the slide number text frame
into the upper-right corner of slides.
2. On the View tab, click the Slide Master button.
You switch to Slide Master view. Chapter 2 in this mini-book explains
this view and how to format many slides at once with master slides.

3. Select the Slide Master, the first slide in the Slides pane.
4. Adjust and format the footer text boxes to taste (as they say in 
cookbooks).
For example, move the slide number text frame into the upper-right
corner to put slide numbers there. Or change the font in the footer text
boxes. Or place a company logo on the Slide Master to make the logo
appear on all your slides.
5. Click the Close button to return to Normal view.
You can always return to Slide Master view and adjust your footer.
Removing a footer from a single slide
On a crowded slide, the items in the footer — the date, footer text, and page
number — can get in the way or be a distraction. Fortunately, removing one
or all of the three footer text frames from a slide is easy:
1. Switch to Normal view and display the slide with the footer that needs
removing.
2. Select the Insert tab.
3. Click the Header & Footer button.
The Header and Footer dialog box appears.
4. Deselect check boxes — Date and Time, Slide Number, and Footer —
to tell PowerPoint which parts of the footer you want to remove.
5. Click the Apply button.
Be careful not to click the Apply to All button. Clicking this button
removes footers throughout your slide presentation.

Chapter 4: Making Your
Presentations Livelier
In This Chapter
 Looking at ways to make a presentation livelier
 Slapping a transition or animation on a slide
 Making sound a part of your presentation
 Playing video during a presentation
T
he purpose of this chapter is to make your presentation stand out in a
crowd. I suggest ways to enliven your presentation with pictures, charts,
slides, and tables. I show how transitions and animations can make a pres-
entation spicier. Finally, you discover how to play sound and video during a
presentation.
Suggestions for Enlivening Your Presentation
Starting on the Insert tab, you can do a lot to make a presentation livelier.
The Insert tab offers buttons for inserting pictures, tables, charts, diagrams,
shapes, and clip-art images on slides:
✦Photos: Everyone likes a good photo, but more than that, audiences
understand more from words and pictures than they do from words
alone. A well-chosen photo reinforces the ideas that you’re trying to put
across in your presentation. (See Book VIII, Chapter 3.)
✦Tables: A table is a great way to plead your case or defend your posi-
tion. Raw table data is irrefutable — well, most of the time, anyway.
Create a table when you want to demonstrate how the numbers back
you up. (See Book I, Chapter 5.)
✦Charts: Nothing is more persuasive than a chart. The bars, pie slices, or
columns show the audience instantaneously that production is up or
down, or that sector A is outperforming sector B. The audience can
compare the data and see what’s what. (See Book I, Chapter 6.)
✦Diagrams: A diagram is an excellent marriage of images and words.
Diagrams allow an audience to literally visualize a concept, idea, or 
relationship. You can present an abstract idea such that the audience
understands it better. (See Book I, Chapter 7.)

Suggestions for Enlivening Your Presentation
426
✦Shapes: Lines and shapes can also illustrate ideas and concepts. You can
also use them as slide decorations. (See Book I, Chapter 8.)
✦Clip-art images: Clip-art images bring a little more color to presentations.
They make presentations friendlier and easier to look at. (See Book VIII,
Chapter 4.)
The grid and drawing guides
The grid is an invisible set of horizontal and ver-
tical lines to which objects — clip-art images,
pictures, and shapes — cling when you move
them on a slide. The grid is meant to help objects
line up squarely with one another. When you
drag an object, it sticks to the nearest grid line.
Besides the grid, PowerPoint offers the draw-
ing guides for aligning objects. These guides
divide a slide into vertical and horizontal planes.
When you want to align or place objects with pre-
cision, display the grid and the drawing guides:
 Displaying (and hiding) the grid: Press
Shift+F9 or go to the View tab and click the
Gridlines check box.
 Displaying (and hiding) the drawing
guides: Press Alt+F9 or right-click (but not
on an object or frame), choose Grid and
Guides, and in the Grid and Guides dialog
box, select the Display Drawing Guides on
Screen check box.
Even if the Snap Objects to Grid check box in
the Grid and Guides dialog box is selected, you
can move objects without them snapping to a
gridline by holding down the Alt key while you
drag.
Select the Snap Objects to Other Objects check
box if you want shapes to abut each other or
fall along a common axis.

Transitions and Animations
427
Transitions and Animations
In PowerPoint-speak, a transition is a little bit of excitement that occurs as
one slide leaves the screen and the next slide climbs aboard. An animation is
movement on the slide. For example, you can animate bulleted lists such
that the bullet points appear on a slide one at a time when you click the
mouse rather than all at once.
Before you know anything about transitions and animations, you should
know that they can be distracting. The purpose of a presentation is to com-
municate with the audience, not display the latest, busiest, most dazzling
presentation technology. For user-run, kiosk-style presentations, however,
eye-catching transitions and animations can be useful because they draw an
audience. (A user-run presentation plays on its own, as I explain in Chapter 5
of this mini-book.) For audiences that enjoy high-tech wizardry, transitions
and animations can be a lot of fun and add to a presentation.
Showing transitions between slides
Transitions include the Dissolve, the Wipe Up, and the Cover Down. Figure 4-1
shows how a transition works. For the figure, I chose the News Flash transi-
tion. This slide doesn’t so much arrive on-screen as it does spin onto the
screen. Don’t worry, you get a chance to test-drive these transitions before
you attach them to slides. Follow these steps to show transitions between
slides:
1. Click the Animations tab.
2. Select the slides that need a transition.
If you need to select more than one slide or you don’t want to assign the
same transition to all your slides, switch to Slide Sorter view to make

Transitions and Animations
428
To apply the same transition to all the slides in the presentation, skip
this step and click the Apply to All button after you select a transition.
3. In the Transition Scheme gallery, choose a transition (you may have
to click the Transition Scheme button first, depending on the size of
your screen).
The names and images on the drop-down list give you an idea of what
the transitions are, but the only sure way to tell what a transition does is
to watch a slide after you make your choice. However fleetingly, you see
the transition you chose on a slide.
4. If you care to, open the Transition Sound drop-down list and choose a
sound to accompany the transition.
Hold the pointer over sound names to hear the different sounds. The Loop
until Next Sound option at the bottom of the drop-down list plays a
sound continuously until the next slide in the presentation appears.
5. On the Transition Speed drop-down list, choose Slow, Medium, or Fast
to declare how quickly or slowly you want the transition to occur.
As I mention in Step 2, you can click the Apply to All button to assign the
same transition to all the slides in your presentation.
If you can’t recall which transition you assigned to a slide, click the slide’s
Play Animations symbol (a flying star) or click the Preview button on the
Animations tab. You see a transition and hear an accompanying sound if you
chose one.
Animating parts of a slide
When it comes to animations, you can choose between animation schemes,
the pre-built special effects made by the elves of Microsoft, or customized
animations that you build on your own. Only fans of animation and people
with a lot of time on their hands go the second route.
Choosing a ready-made animation scheme
Follow these steps to preview and choose an animation scheme for slides:
1. Go to the Animations tab.
2. Click to select the element on the slide that you want to animate.
You can tell when you’ve selected an element because a selection box
appears around it.
3. Open the Animate drop-down list and choose an animation effect, as
shown in Figure 4-2.

Your choices are Fade, Wipe, and Fly In.
If you choose a text-box or text-frame element with more than one 
paragraph in Step 1, tell PowerPoint whether to animate all the text or
animate each paragraph separately from the others:
• All at Once: All the text is animated at the same time.
• By 1st Level Paragraphs: Each paragraph is treated separately and
is animated on its own. For example, each item in a bulleted list is
treated as a separate element — each item fades, wipes, or flies in
after the one before it, not at the same time as the one before it.
Very briefly, you see a preview of the animation choice you made. To get
a good look at the animation you just chose for your slide, click the
Preview button on the Animation tab.
To remove an animation, return to the Animate drop-down list and choose
No Animation.

Fashioning your own animation scheme
To fashion your own animation scheme, click the Custom Animation button.
You see the Custom Animation task pane. Select an element on the slide and
follow these general instructions to animate it:
✦Click the Add Effect button and choose an animation on one of the 
submenus.
✦On the Start drop-down list, declare whether the animation begins when
you click your slide, at the same time as the previous animation, or after
the previous animation.
✦Open the Speed drop-down list and choose a speed setting.
✦Select an animation in the task pane and click a Re-Order button to
change the order in which animations occur, if more than one slide 
element is animated on your slide.
Sounding Off on Slides
Especially in user-run, kiosk-style presentations, sound can be a welcome
addition. Sound gives presentations an extra dimension. Sound attracts an
audience. PowerPoint offers two ways to make sound a part of a presentation:
✦As part of slide transitions: The sound is heard as a new slide arrives
on-screen. On the Animations tab, open the Transition Sound drop-down
list and choose a sound. (See “Showing transitions between slides” earlier
in this chapter.)
✦On the slide itself: The means of playing the sound appears on the slide
in the form of a Sound icon, as shown in Figure 4-3. By clicking the Sound
icon, you can play the sound. You can also make the sound play as soon
as the slide arrives on-screen.

Table 4-1 describes the sound files you can use in PowerPoint presentations,
whether each file type is a wave or MIDI sound, and whether the file can be
used in slide transitions. To find out what kind of sound file you’re dealing
with, note the file’s three-letter extension; or open Windows Explorer or My
Computer, find the sound file, switch to Details view, and look in the Type
column. To switch to Details view in Windows Explorer or My Computer,
click the View button and choose Details on the drop-down list.

Playing sounds: A precautionary tale
Before you consider making sound a part of your presentation, consider how
PowerPoint handles sound files. Unless a sound file is a WAV file and is less
than 100 KB in size, it isn’t made a part of a presentation. The sound file isn’t
embedded. To play a sound file larger than 100 KB, PowerPoint reaches into
the folder on your computer where the sound file is located and plays the
file from there. Keeping large sound files separate from the PowerPoint pres-
entation in which they’re played can cause problems if you move a sound
file, load your presentation on a different computer, or send your presenta-
tion to someone else because your PowerPoint presentation gets separated
from the sound file.
If you intend to move your PowerPoint presentation to a different computer,
consider these precautions to make sure that the sound files in the presenta-
tion still play:
✦Keep sound files in the same folder as your presentation file: Move the
sound files you need for your presentation into the same folder as the
presentation, insert the sound files, and send the sound files along with
the presentation file to the other computer. This way, the relationship
between the presentation and the sound files remains intact. When your
presentation calls on a sound file to play, the sound file is ready and
waiting.
✦Package your presentation for a CD: Packaging folds all the files associ-
ated with a PowerPoint presentation — the sound and video files — into
one large file so that the presentation can be taken on the road. Chapter 5
of this mini-book describes the Package for CD command.

Sounding Off on Slides
432
✦Change the WAV-file-size-link setting: You can change the 100 KB cutoff
point for storing WAV files inside slides. Click the Office button and
choose PowerPoint Options to open the PowerPoint Options dialog box,
select the Advanced category, and under Save (you may have to scroll to
get there), enter a new KB measurement in the Link Sounds with File Size
Greater Than box.
Inserting a sound file on a slide
Before you insert your sound file on a slide, ask yourself, “Do I want the
sound file to start playing when the slide appears or when I click the Sound
icon?” Clicking the Sound icon gives you more control over when the sound
is heard, but you have to remember to click the icon to start playing the
sound. You can hide the Sound icon or leave it on a slide to remind yourself
to click to start playing sounds.
Follow these steps to insert a sound file in a slide:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the Sound button.
You see the Insert Sound dialog box.
3. Locate and select a sound file and then click OK.
Earlier in this chapter, Table 4-1 lists the type of sound files that you can
play in presentations.
4. Choose Automatically or When Clicked in the dialog box that asks
how you want the sound to start playing.
Here are your choices:
• Automatically: Click this button to make the sound play automatically
as soon as the slide appears.
• When Clicked: Click this button to play the sound when you click the
Sound icon on your slide.
Don’t worry about choosing right now. You can always change your
mind about when a sound plays, as “Telling PowerPoint when and how
to play a sound file” explains later in this chapter.
A Sound icon appears on the slide to remind you that sounds are supposed
to play when your slide is on-screen. You can change the size of this icon
by selecting it and dragging a corner handle or going to the (Sound Tools)
Options tab and entering new Height and Width measurements. You can also
drag the icon into an out-of-the-way corner of your slide.
To quit playing a sound file on a slide, select the Sound icon and then press
the Delete key.

Telling PowerPoint when and 
how to play a sound file
To tell PowerPoint when and how to play a sound file, start by selecting
the Sound icon and going to the (Sound Tools) Options tab, as shown in
Figure 4-4. From there, you can select options on the tab or click the Sound
Options group button to open the Sound Options dialog box and select
options there. Here are your choices for telling PowerPoint when and how
to play a sound file:
✦Controlling the volume: Click the Slide Show Volume button (on the tab)
or the Sound Volume icon (in the dialog box) to control how loud the
sound is. The tab offers Low, Medium, High, and Mute settings; the dialog
box offers a slider.
✦Hiding and unhiding the Sound icon: Select the Hide during Show
check box (on the tab) or the Hide Sound Icon during Slide Show check
box (in the dialog box). If you hide the Sound icon, the sound file must
play automatically; otherwise, you won’t see the Sound icon and be able
to click it and make the file play.
✦Continuously playing a sound: Select the Loop until Stopped check box
(on the tab or the dialog box) to play the sound file over and over again
or until you move on to the next slide.
✦Changing the Automatically or When Clicked status: Open the Play
Sound drop-down list on the Options tab and choose Automatically or
When Clicked to tell PowerPoint when to start playing sound.

Starting, pausing, and resuming a sound file
While a sound file is playing during a presentation, you can pause and resume
playing it as long as the Sound icon appears on your slide. (If you’ve hidden
the Sound icon, you’re out of luck because you have to click it to pause a
sound file.) Follow these instructions to start, pause, and resume a sound
recording during a presentation:
✦Starting a sound file: Click the Sound icon.
✦Pausing and resuming a sound file: Click the Sound icon to pause.
To resume playing, click the Sound icon again. Be careful to click the
Sound icon and not another part of your slide when you start, pause, or
resume playing a sound file. Clicking another part of the slide advances
your presentation to the next slide.
Playing Video on Slides
If a picture is worth a thousand words, what is a moving picture worth? Ten
thousand? To give your presentation more cachet, you can play video on
slides and in so doing, turn your presentation into a mini-movie theater.
To play video, PowerPoint relies on Windows Media Player, the media player
that comes with Windows. Therefore, to play video on a slide, stick to for-
mats that Windows Media Player can handle: AVI (Audio Visual Interleaved),
MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group), MPG (Media Planning Group), WMV
(Windows Media Video), and ASF (Advanced Systems Format). Avoid video
files in these formats: MOV (QuickTime Video), RM (RealVideo), and VCD
(Video Compact Disc).
Inserting a video on a slide
Follow these steps to insert a video on a slide:
1. Open the Insert Movie dialog box.
You can open the dialog box with one of these techniques:
• Click the Movie icon in a content placeholder frame.
• On the Insert tab, click the Movie button.
2. Select a video file in the Insert Movie dialog box and click OK (or Open).
3. In the dialog box that asks how you want the video to start playing,
select Automatically or When Clicked.
Automatically makes the video play automatically when the slide appears;
When Clicked plays the video after you or another presenter clicks it.
Don’t waste too much time deciding because changing your mind is easy
enough, as “Fine-tuning a video presentation” explains shortly.

The video appears on your slide. If I were you, I would find out how (or
whether) the video plays. To do that, right-click the video and choose
Preview on the shortcut menu or go to the (Movie Tools) Options tab and
click the Preview button.
Unlike photos, videos aren’t made a part of a slide when you place a video on a
slide. To use a technical term, videos aren’t embedded in slides. To play a video,
PowerPoint notes the address of the video file on your computer, reaches
into the folder where the video is stored, and plays the video file from there.
How PowerPoint plays videos on slides needn’t concern you if you never
have to move your presentation to a different computer or give your presen-
tation to someone else. But if your presentation will travel, either keep video
files in the same folder as your presentation file and move the video files
along with your presentation file to the other computer, or use the Package
for CD command to fold video files into your presentation and embed them
there. (Chapter 5 of this mini-book explains the Package for CD command.)
Fine-tuning a video presentation
As shown in Figure 4-5, select the video and go to the (Movie Tools) Options
tab to fine-tune a video presentation. The Options tab and the Movie Options
dialog box offer all kinds of commands for making a video play the way you
want it to play. Click the Movie Options group button (see Figure 4-5) to open
the Movie Options dialog box. Here are different ways you can fine-tune a
video presentation:
Select movie options...
...or click here to open the Movie Options dialog box.

✦Controlling the volume: Click the Slide Show Volume button (on the
Options tab) or the Sound Volume icon (in the Movie Options dialog
box) to control how loud the video sound is.
✦Playing the video automatically or when you click: Open the Play
Movie drop-down list on the Options tab and choose Automatically or
When Clicked to tell PowerPoint when to start playing the video.
✦Hiding the video until you give the order to start playing: You can hide
the video until you start playing it by selecting the Hide during Show
check box (on the Options tab) or the Hide While Not Playing check box
(in the Movie Options dialog box).
✦Continuously playing, or looping, the video: Play a movie continuously
or until you go to the next slide by selecting the Loop until Stopped
check box (on the Options tab or Movie Options dialog box).
✦Playing the video at full-screen: Make a video fill the entire screen by
selecting the Play Full Screen check box (on the Options tab) or the
Zoom to Full Screen check box (in the Movie Options dialog box).
Be careful of this one. Videos can look terribly grainy when they appear
on the big screen.
✦Rewinding the video when it’s finished playing: Rewind a video if you
want to see the first frame, not the last, when the video finishes playing.
Select the Rewind Movie After Playing check box (on the Options tab) or
the Rewind Movie When Done Playing check box (in the Movie Options
dialog box) to make the start of the video appear after the video plays;
deselect this option to freeze frame on the end of the video when it fin-
ishes playing.

 Drawing on slides during a presentation
 Delivering a presentation when you can’t be there in person
A
t last, the big day has arrived. It’s time to give the presentation. “Break
a leg,” as actors say before they go on stage. This chapter explains
how to rehearse your presentation to find out how long it is and show your
presentation. You discover some techniques to make your presentation live-
lier, including how to draw on slides with a pen or highlighter and blank out
the screen to get the audience’s full attention. The chapter describes how to
handle the speaker notes and print handouts for your audience. In case you
can’t be there in person to deliver your presentation, this chapter shows
you how to create a user-run presentation, a self-running presentation, and a
presentation designed to be viewed from a CD.
All about Notes
Notes are strictly for the speaker. They aren’t for the unwashed masses.
Don’t hesitate to write notes to yourself when you put together your pres-
entation. The notes will come in handy when you’re rehearsing and giving
your presentation. They give you ideas for what to say and help you com-
municate better. Here are instructions for entering, editing, and printing
notes:
✦Entering a note: To enter a note, start in Normal view, click in the
Notes pane, and start typing. Treat the Notes pane like a page in a word
processor. For example, press Enter to go to the next line and press the

Rehearsing and Timing Your Presentation
438
Tab key to indent text. You can drag the border above the Notes pane up
or down to make the pane larger or smaller.
✦Editing notes in Notes Page view: After you’ve jotted down a bunch of
notes, switch to Notes Page view and edit them. To switch to Notes Page
view, click the View tab and then click the Notes Page button. Notes
appear in a text frame below a picture of the slide to which they refer.
You may have to zoom in to read them.
✦Printing your notes: Click the Office button and choose Print➪Print
(or press Ctrl+P). You see the Print dialog box. In the Print What drop-
down list, choose Notes Pages, and click OK.
Rehearsing and Timing Your Presentation
Slide presentations and theatrical presentations have this in common:
They are as good as the number of times you rehearse them. Be sure to
rehearse your presentation many times over. The more you rehearse, the
more comfortable you will be giving your presentation. Follow these steps to
rehearse a presentation, record its length, and record how long each slide is
displayed:
1. Select the first slide in your presentation.
2. Click the Slide Show tab.
3. Click the Rehearse Timings button.
The Rehearsal toolbar appears, as shown in Figure 5-1, and you switch
to Slide Show view.
Note how long your presentation is.
Advance to the next side.
Figure 5-1:

rehearsal.

Book IV
Chapter 5

Presentation
Rehearsing and Timing Your Presentation

4. Give your presentation one slide at a time and click the Next button
on the Rehearsal toolbar to go from slide to slide.
When each slide appears, imagine that you’re presenting it to an audi-
ence. Say what you intend to say during the real presentation. If you
anticipate audience members asking questions, allot time for questions.
The Rehearsal toolbar tells you how long each slide has been displayed
and how long your presentation is so far. You can do these tasks from
the Rehearsal toolbar:
• Go to the next slide: Click the Next button.
• Pause recording: Temporarily stop the recording so that you can feed
the dog or take a phone call. Click the Pause button a second time to
resume recording.
• Repeat a slide: Click the Repeat button if you get befuddled and want
to start over with a slide. The slide timing returns to 0:00:00.
5. In the dialog box that asks whether you want to keep the slide tim-
ings, note how long your presentation is (see Figure 5-1).
Is your presentation too long or too short? I hope, like baby bear’s por-
ridge, your presentation is “just right.” But if it’s too long or short, you
have some work to do. You have to figure out how to shorten or
lengthen it.
6. In the dialog box that asks whether you want to keep the slide tim-
ings, click Yes if you want to see how long each slide stayed on-screen
during the rehearsal.
By clicking Yes, you can see how long each slide remained on-screen in
Slide Sorter view.
If you save the slide timings, PowerPoint assumes that, during a presenta-
tion, you want to advance to the next slide manually or after the recorded
time, whichever comes first. For example, suppose the first slide in your
presentation remained on-screen for a minute during the rehearsal. During
your presentation, the first slide will remain on-screen for a minute and auto-
matically yield to the second slide unless you click to advance to the second
slide before the minute has passed. If you recorded slide timings strictly to find
out how long your presentation is, you need to tell PowerPoint not to advance
automatically to the next slide during a presentation after the recorded time
period elapses. On the Slide Show tab, deselect the Use Rehearsed Timings
check box.

Showing Your Presentation
Compared to the preliminary work, giving a presentation can seem kind of
anticlimactic. All you have to do is go from slide to slide and woo your audi-
ence with your smooth-as-silk voice and powerful oratory skills. Well, at
least the move-from-slide-to-slide part is pretty easy. These pages explain
how to start and end a presentation, all the different ways to advance or
retreat from slide to slide, and how to jump to different slides.
Starting and ending a presentation
Here are the different ways to start a presentation from the beginning:
✦On the Slide Show tab, click the From Beginning button.
✦Select the first slide and then click the Slide Show view button.
You can start a presentation in the middle by selecting a slide in the middle
and then clicking the Slide Show view button or going to the Slide Show tab
and clicking the From Current Slide button.
Here are the different ways to end a presentation prematurely:
✦Press Esc, Ctrl+Break, or – (the Hyphen key).
✦Click the Slide button and choose End Show on the pop-up list. This
button is located in the lower-left corner of the screen.
✦Right-click and choose End Show in the shortcut menu.
Going from slide to slide
In a nutshell, PowerPoint offers four ways to move from slide to slide in a
presentation. Table 5-1 describes techniques for navigating a presentation
using the four different ways:
✦Use the slide control buttons: Click a slide control button — Previous
and Next — in the lower-left corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 5-2.
If you don’t see the slide control buttons, jiggle the mouse.
✦Click the Slide button: Click this button and make a choice on the pop-
up list (see Figure 5-2).
✦Right-click on-screen: Right-click and choose a navigation option on the
shortcut menu.
✦Press a keyboard shortcut: Press one of the numerous keyboard short-
cuts that PowerPoint offers for going from slide to slide (see Table 5-1).

Going forward (or backward) from slide to slide
To go forward from one slide to the following slide in a presentation, click
on-screen. After you click, the next slide appears. If all goes well, clicking is
the only technique you need to know when giving a presentation to go from
slide to slide, but Table 5-1 lists other ways to go to the next slide in a pres-
entation as well as techniques for going backward to the previous slide.
To go to the first slide in a presentation, press Home; to go to the last slide,
press End.
Jumping forward or backward to a specific slide
If you find it necessary to jump forward or backward across several slides in
your presentation to get to the slide you want to show, it can be done with
these techniques:
✦Either click the Slide button or right-click, choose Go to Slide, and then
choose a slide in your presentation on the submenu (refer to Figure 5-2).
✦Press Ctrl+S. You see the All Slides dialog box. It lists all slides in your
presentation. Select the slide you want to show and click the Go To
button.
✦Press the slide number you want on your keyboard (if you can remem-
ber the slide’s number) and then press the Enter key. For example, to
show the third slide in your presentation, press 3 and then press Enter.
If you need to return to where you started after you make the jump to a dif-
ferent slide, you can do so by right-clicking and choosing Last Viewed on the
shortcut menu. You can also click the Slide button and choose Last Viewed
(refer to Figure 5-2). The Last Viewed command takes you to the last slide
you showed, wherever it is in your presentation.
Tricks for Making Presentations a Little Livelier
To make presentations a little livelier, whip out a pen and draw on a slide or
blank the screen. Draw to underline words or draw check marks as you hit
the key points, as shown in Figure 5-3. Drawing on slides is an excellent way
to add a little something to a presentation. Blank the screen when you want
the audience’s undivided attention.

Wielding a pen or highlighter in a presentation
Follow these instructions so you can draw on a slide:
✦Selecting a pen or highlighter: PowerPoint offers the Ballpoint Pen
(thin) and Felt Tip Pen (thicker), as well as the Highlighter for highlight-
ing text on a slide. To select a pen or the Highlighter, click the Pen
button and choose a pen or the Highlighter (see Figure 5-3). You can
also right-click, choose Pointer Options, and make a selection on the
submenu.
✦Choosing a color for drawing: After you select a pen or the Highlighter,
click the Pen button, choose Ink Color, and choose a color on the submenu
(see Figure 5-3). You can also right-click to choose a color for drawing.
Press Esc when you’re finished using the pen. (Just be careful not to press
Esc twice because the second press tells PowerPoint to end the presentation.)

Erasing pen and highlighter drawings
Follow these instructions to erase pen and highlighter drawings:
✦Erasing lines one at a time: Click the Pen button and choose Eraser
(or right-click and choose Pointer Options➪Eraser). The Eraser appears.
Drag it to a line and click to erase the line. Press Esc after you’re finished
using the Eraser.
✦Erasing all the lines on a slide: Press E or click the Pen button and
choose Erase All Ink on Slide (refer to Figure 5-3).
✦Erasing lines you told PowerPoint to keep: As I explain shortly,
PowerPoint asks at the end of a presentation that you drew on whether
you want to keep the lines. If you elect to keep them, the lines become
part of your presentation, and you can’t delete them by clicking with the
Eraser or by choosing the Erase All Ink on Slide command. To discard
these lines later, go to the Review tab, open the drop-down list on the
Delete button, and choose one of these options:
• Delete All Markup on the Current Slide: Deletes lines you drew on a
slide you selected
• Delete All Markup in This Presentation: Deletes lines you drew on all
the slides in your presentation
Pen marks aren’t permanent, although you can keep them. At the end of a
presentation in which you have drawn on slides, a dialog box asks whether
you want to keep or discard your scribblings. Click the Keep or Discard
button. (If you prefer not to see this dialog box because you intend never to
keep your drawings, click the Office button and choose PowerPoint Options.
In the PowerPoint Options dialog box, select the Advanced category and
then deselect the Prompt to Keep Ink Annotations When Exiting check box.)
Blanking the screen
Here’s a technique for adding a little drama to a presentation: When you
want the audience to focus on you, not the PowerPoint screen, blank the
screen. Make an all-black or all-white screen appear where a PowerPoint
slide used to be. Every head in the audience will turn your way and listen
keenly to what you have to say next. I sure hope you have something impor-
tant to say.
Follow these instructions to blank out the screen during a presentation:
✦Black screen: Press B, the period key, or right-click and choose
Screen➪Black Screen.

Delivering a Presentation When 
You Can’t Be There in Person
PowerPoint offers numerous ways to deliver a presentation when you
can’t be there in person. You can deliver your presentation in the form of a
handout, a printed version of the presentation with thumbnail slides; create
a self-running presentation; or create a user-run presentation with action
buttons that others can click to get from slide to slide. The rest of this chap-
ter explains how to do all that as well as package your presentation so that
people who don’t have PowerPoint can view it.
Book VIII, Chapter 2 describes two more ways to distribute PowerPoint 
presentations — by saving them as PDF files and publishing them on the

Handouts are thumbnail versions of slides that you print and distribute to
the audience. Figure 5-4 shows examples of handouts. Handouts come in
one, two, three, four, six, or nine slides per page. If you select three slides
per page, the handout includes lines that your audience can take notes on
(see Figure 5-4); the other sizes don’t offer these lines.

To tell PowerPoint how to construct handouts, click the View tab and then
click the Handout Master button. In Handout Master view, on the Handout
Master tab, you can do a number of things to make your handouts more
useful and attractive. As you make your choices, keep your eye on the
sample handout page; it shows what your choices mean in real terms.
✦Handout Orientation: Select Portrait or Landscape. In landscape mode,
the page is turned on its side and is longer than it is tall.
✦Slide Orientation: Select Portrait or Landscape, although I can’t think of
a good reason to choose Portrait.
✦Slides-Per-Page: Open the drop-down list and choose how many slides
appear on each page. Figure 5-4 shows what some of the choices are.
✦Header: Select the Header check box and enter a header in the text
frame to make a header appear in the upper-left corner of all handout
pages. Candidates for headers include your name, your company name,
and the location of a conference or seminar. The point is to help your
audience identify the handout.
✦Footer: Select the Footer check box and enter a footer in the text frame
in the lower-left corner of handout pages. Candidates for footers are the
same as candidates for headers.
✦Page Number: Select this check box if you want page numbers to appear
on the handout pages.
✦Date: Select this check box if you want the date you print the handout to
appear on the handout pages.
✦Background Styles: Open the Background Styles drop-down list and
choose a gradient or color, if you’re so inclined. Chapter 2 of this mini-
book explains background styles. Make sure that the background doesn’t
obscure the slide thumbnails or put too much of a burden on your printer.
To print handouts, click the Office button and choose Print➪Print (or press
Ctrl+P). You see the Print dialog box. Choose Handouts on the Print What
drop-down list, enter how many handout copies you need in the Number of
Copies text box, and click OK.
Creating a self-running, kiosk-style presentation
A self-running, kiosk-style presentation is one that plays on its own. You can
make it play from a kiosk or simply send it to co-workers so that they can
play it. In a self-running presentation, slides appear on-screen one after the
other without you or anyone else having to advance the presentation from
slide to slide. When the presentation finishes, it starts all over again from
Slide 1.

Telling PowerPoint how long to keep slides on-screen
PowerPoint offers two ways to indicate how long you want each slide to stay
on-screen:
✦Entering the time periods yourself: Switch to Slide Sorter view and click
the Animations tab. Then deselect the On Mouse Click check box and
select the Automatically After check box, as shown in Figure 5-5. Next,
tell PowerPoint to keep all slides on-screen the same amount of time or
choose a different time period for each slide:
• All slides the same time: Enter a time period in the Automatically
After text box and click the Apply to All button.
• Each slide a different time: One by one, select each slide and enter a
time period in the Automatically After text box.
✦Rehearsing the presentation: Rehearse the presentation and save the
timings. (See “Rehearsing and Timing Your Presentation” earlier in this
chapter.) Be sure to save the slide timings after you’re finished rehearsing.
In Slide Sorter view, you can see how long each slide will stay on-screen (see
Figure 5-5).
Enter a time period.

Telling PowerPoint that your presentation is self-running
Before you can “self-run” a presentation, you have to tell PowerPoint that
you want it to do that. Self-running presentations don’t have the control but-
tons in the lower-left corner. You can’t click the screen or press a key to
move forward or backward to the next or previous slide. The only control
you have over a self-running presentation is pressing the Esc key (pressing
Esc ends the presentation).
Follow these steps to make yours a kiosk-style, self-running presentation:
1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the Set Up Slide Show button.
You see the Set Up Slide Show dialog box.
3. Under Show Type, select the Browsed at a Kiosk (Full Screen) option.
When you select this option, PowerPoint automatically selects the Loop
Continuously Until ‘Esc’ check box.
4. Make sure that the Using Timings, If Present option button is selected.
5. Click OK.
That’s all there is to it.
Creating a user-run presentation
A user-run, or interactive, presentation is one that the viewer gets to control.
The viewer decides which slide appears next and how long each slide
remains on-screen. User-run presentations are similar to Web sites. Users
can browse from slide to slide at their own speed. They can pick and choose
what they want to investigate. They can backtrack and view slides they saw
previously or return to the first slide and start anew.
The slide controls — the Previous and Next buttons — that you normally see
during a presentation in the lower-left corner of slides don’t appear in user-
run presentations. You have to supply the means for viewers to get from
slide to slide, and to do that, you create action buttons. An action button is a
button that you can click to go to another slide in your presentation or the
previous slide you viewed, whatever that slide was. PowerPoint provides
11 action buttons in the Shapes gallery. Figure 5-6 shows some action but-
tons and the dialog box you use to create them.

Drawing an action button
After you draw an action button from the Shapes gallery, the Action Settings
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-6, appears so you can tell PowerPoint which
slide to go to when the button is clicked. Select the slide (or master slide)
that needs action and follow these steps to adorn it with an action button:
1. On the Home or Insert tab, open the Shapes gallery and scroll to the
Action Buttons category at the bottom.
2. Click an action button to select it.
Choose the button that best illustrates which slide will appear when the
button is clicked.
3. Draw the button on the slide.
To do so, drag the pointer in a diagonal fashion. (As far as drawing them
is concerned, action buttons work the same as all other shapes and
other objects. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate objects.)
The Action Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-6, appears after you
finish drawing your button.
4. Select the Mouse Over tab if you want users to activate the button by
moving the mouse pointer over it, not clicking it.
5. Select the Hyperlink To option button.
Figure 5-6:
Action
buttons.

Delivering a Presentation When You Can’t Be There in Person
450
6. On the Hyperlink To drop-down list, choose an action for the button.
You can go to the next slide, the previous slide, the first or last slide in a
presentation, the last slide you viewed, or a specific slide.
To make clicking the action button take users to a specific slide, choose
Slide on the list. You see the Hyperlink to Slide dialog box, which lists
each slide in your presentation. Select a slide and click OK.
7. To play a sound when your action button is activated, select the Play
Sound check box and select a sound on the drop-down list.
“Mouse-over” hyperlinks can do with sound accompaniment so users
understand when they’ve activated an action button.
8. Click OK in the Actions Settings dialog box.
To test your button, you can right-click it and choose Open Hyperlink.
To change a button’s action, select it and then click the Action button on the
Insert tab, or right-click your action button and choose Edit Hyperlink. In the
Action Settings dialog box, choose a new action and click OK.
Making yours a user-run presentation
Follow these steps to declare your presentation a user-run presentation and
allow users to navigate from slide to slide with the scrollbar as well as by
clicking action buttons:
1. Select the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the Set Up Slide Show button.
You see the Set Up Show dialog box.
3. Select the Browsed by an Individual (Window) option button.
4. (Optional) Click the Show Scrollbar check box.
If you choose this option, a scrollbar appears on the right side of the
presentation so that users can go from slide to slide by scrolling.
5. Click OK.
Your presentation is no longer quite yours. It also belongs to all the
people who view it in your absence.
Packaging your presentation
The Package for CD command copies a presentation to a CD so that you can
take a presentation on the road or distribute it to others on CDs. By using
the Package for CD command, you can even distribute a presentation to

Book IV
Chapter 5
Delivering a
Presentation
Delivering a Presentation When You Can’t Be There in Person
451
people who don’t have PowerPoint on their computers. Along with the pres-
entation, the command copies a program called PowerPoint Viewer to the
CD. PowerPoint Viewer is an abridged version of PowerPoint. It has all the
PowerPoint slide-show commands but none of the slide-creation commands.
After someone pops the CD in a computer, PowerPoint Viewer opens, and
the presentation you copied starts playing in PowerPoint Viewer. With the
Package for CD command, you don’t have to be concerned when you go on
the road whether PowerPoint is installed on the computer where you’re
expected to give your presentation.
The Package for CD command offers another important benefit. As Chapter 4
of this mini-book (about sound and video) explains, video files and most
sound files aren’t embedded in presentations. To play a video or sound,
PowerPoint reaches into the folder on your computer where the video or
sound file is kept, and it plays the video or sound file from that location. If
your presentation will travel and it includes sound and video, you have to
consider how to transport the sound and video files along with your presen-
tation file. The easiest way to transport these files is to bundle the files with
your PowerPoint presentation by using the Package for CD command.
These pages explain the ins and outs of the Package for CD command.
You find out how to copy a presentation (and PowerPoint Viewer) to a 
CD or folder and play a presentation in PowerPoint Viewer.
Packaging a presentation on a CD
Follow these steps to copy your presentation along with all its attendant files
and the PowerPoint Viewer to a CD or a folder:
1. Open the presentation you want to package.
2. Click the Office button and choose Publish➪Package for CD.
You see the Package for CD dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-7:

3. Enter a name for the CD or folder in the Name the CD text box.
The name you enter will appear as the name of the CD if you view the CD
in Windows Explorer or My Computer; if you’re copying your presentation
to a folder, the name you enter will be given to the folder PowerPoint
creates when it creates the packaged presentation file.
4. Create the packaged presentation and copy it to a CD or to a folder on
your computer.
Copy the presentation to a folder if you want to send the presentation
by e-mail rather than distribute it by CD.
• Copying to a CD: Click the Copy to CD button.
• Copying to a folder: Click the Copy to Folder button. In the Copy to
Folder dialog box, click the Browse button, and in the Choose
Location dialog box, select a folder for storing the folder where you
will keep your packaged presentation. Then click the Select button
and click OK in the Copy to Folder dialog box.
5. Click Yes in the message box that asks if you want to include linked
content in the presentation.
It can take PowerPoint several minutes to assemble the files and copy
them to the CD or folder. Besides the files, PowerPoint needs to copy the
PowerPoint Viewer program (pptview.exe).
If you’re copying your presentation to a CD, PowerPoint asks whether
you want to copy the same presentation to another CD. Either insert a
fresh CD and click Yes, or click the No button.
Distributing your presentation to people 
who don’t have PowerPoint
Not everyone has PowerPoint. Not everyone is
so blessed. Some people live along in ignorant
bliss without knowing anything about PowerPoint
and its slide-show capabilities.
Don’t be discouraged if you want to send your
PowerPoint presentation to someone who
doesn’t have or may not have PowerPoint.
Someone who doesn’t have PowerPoint on his
or her computer can still play a PowerPoint
presentation by way of PowerPoint Viewer, a
software program you can download for free
from Microsoft starting at this Web page (enter
PowerPoint Viewer in the Search text box and
click the Go button):

Playing a packaged presentation in PowerPoint Viewer
If you distribute your presentation on a CD, tell the people to whom you give
the CD that the CD plays automatically after you put it in the computer’s CD
drive.
Distributing a packaged presentation by e-mail can be difficult because you
have to send several files, and moreover, many e-mail programs don’t permit
you to send program (.exe) files, including pptview.exe, the PowerPoint
Viewer program file. To get around this problem, compress the files before
sending them. In Windows Explorer or My Computer, select all the files in the
folder you created for your packaged presentation (choose Edit➪Select All),
right-click the files, and choose Send To➪Compress (Zipped) Folder. Make
sure the people to whom you send the compressed file know how to decom-
press it (right-click it and choose Extract All).
Here are instructions for running a presentation in PowerPoint Viewer:
✦Getting from slide to slide: Click on-screen or right-click and choose
Next on the shortcut menu.
✦Retreating: Right-click and choose Previous or Last Viewed.
✦Going to a specific slide: Right-click, choose Go to Slide, and select a
slide on the submenu.
✦Ending the show: Press Esc or right-click and choose End Show.
If your presentation includes video or sound, inform users that they may
have to click the sound icon or video screen to hear the sound or watch the
video. Whether users have to click or whether the sound or video plays
automatically depends on which option you choose when you insert the
sound or video on your slides.

his chapter introduces Excel, the official number cruncher of Office
2007. The purpose of Excel is to track, analyze, and tabulate numbers.
Use the program to project profits and losses, formulate a budget, or ana-
lyze Elvis sightings in North America. Doing the setup work takes time, but
after you enter the numbers and tell Excel how to tabulate them, you’re on
Easy Street. Excel does the math for you. All you have to do is kick off your
shoes, sit back, and see how the numbers stack up.
This chapter explains what a workbook and a worksheet is, and how rows
and columns on a worksheet determine where cell addresses are. You also
discover tips and tricks for entering data quickly in a worksheet, and how to
construct data-validation rules to make sure that data is entered accurately.
Creating a New Excel Workbook
When you start Excel, the program greets you with a brand-new workbook
with the generic name “Book1” on the title bar. Workbook is just the Excel
term for the files you create with the program. You can start working right
away on the generic workbook or you can take advantage of one of Excel’s
templates. A template is a preformatted workbook designed for a specific
purpose, such as budgeting, tracking inventories, or tracking purchase
orders. Creating a workbook from a template is mighty convenient if you

happen to find a template that suits your purposes, but in my experience,
you almost always have to start from a generic, blank workbook because
your data is your own. You need a workbook you create yourself — not one
created from a template by someone else.
Whether you want to create a new workbook from a template or from
scratch, start by clicking the Office button and choosing New on the drop-
down list. You see the New Workbook dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-1.
Create your workbook with one of these techniques:
✦Blank workbook: Double-click the Blank Workbook icon. (By pressing
Ctrl+N, you can create a new, blank workbook without opening the New
Workbook dialog box.)
✦Workbook from a template: Take your pick from these techniques to
create a workbook from a template:
• Use a template on your computer: Click Installed Templates (you can
find this button under Templates). Templates that you loaded on
your computer when you installed Office appear in the dialog box.
Double-click a template to create a workbook.

• Search for a template online at Microsoft: Enter a search term in the
Search Microsoft box, make sure your computer is connected to the
Internet, and click the Start Searching button. Templates appear in
the dialog box. Double-click a template to download and use it to
create a workbook.
• Use a template you created (or downloaded earlier from Microsoft):
Click My Templates. The New dialog box appears. Select a template
and click OK. (If you have created your own template, its name
appears in this dialog box.)
• Select a recently used template: Double-click a template name in the
middle of the dialog box under Blank and Recent.
✦Recycle another workbook: If you can use another workbook as the
starting point for creating a new one, click New from Existing. In the New
from Existing Workbook dialog box, select the workbook and click the
Create New button.
Book I, Chapter 1 explains how to save a workbook after you create it as well
as how to open a workbook that you want to work on.
Getting Acquainted with Excel
If you’ve spent any time in an Office program, much of the Excel screen
should look familiar to you. The buttons on the Home tab — the Bold and
Align buttons, for example — work the same in Excel as they do in Word. The
Font and Font Size drop-down lists work the same as well. Any command in
Excel that has to do with formatting text and numbers works the same in
Excel and Word.
As I mention earlier, an Excel file is a workbook. Each workbook comprises
one or more worksheets. A worksheet, also known as a spreadsheet, is a table
where you enter data and data labels. Figure 1-2 shows a worksheet with
data about rainfall in different counties. A worksheet works like an accoun-
tant’s ledger — only it’s much easier to use. Notice how the worksheet is
divided by gridlines into columns (A, B, C, and so on) and rows (1, 2, 3, and
so on). The rectangles where columns and rows intersect are cells, and each
cell can hold one data item, a formula for calculating data, or nothing at all.
At the bottom of the worksheet are tabs — Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3 — for
visiting the other worksheets in the workbook.
Each cell has a different cell address. In Figure 1-2, cell B7 holds 13, the
amount of rain that fell in Sonoma County in the winter. Meanwhile, as the
Formula bar at the top of the screen shows, cell F7, the active cell, holds the
formula =B7+C7+D7+E7, the sum of the numbers in cells — you guessed it —
B7, C7, D7, and E7.

Getting Acquainted with Excel
460
The beauty of Excel is that the program does all the calculations and recal-
culations for you after you enter the data. If I were to change the number in
cell B7, Excel would instantly recalculate the total amount of rainfall in
Sonoma County in cell F7. People like me who struggled in math class will be
glad to know that you don’t have to worry about the math because Excel
does it for you. All you have to do is make sure that the data and the formu-
las are entered correctly.
After you enter and label the data, enter the formulas, and turn your work-
sheet into a little masterpiece, you can start analyzing the data. You can also
generate charts like the one in Figure 1-3. Do you notice any similarities
between the worksheet in Figure 1-2 and the chart in Figure 1-3? The chart is
fashioned from data in the worksheet, and it took me about a half minute to
create that chart. (Book I, Chapter 6 explains how to create charts in Excel,
Word, and PowerPoint.)

Rows, columns, and cell addresses
Not that anyone except an Enron accountant needs all of them, but an Excel
worksheet has numerous columns and over 1 million rows. The rows are
numbered, and columns are labeled A to Z, then AA to AZ, then BA to BZ,
and so on. The important thing to remember is that each cell has an address
whose name comes from a column letter and a row number. The first cell in
row 1 is A1, the second is B1, and so on. You need to enter cell addresses in
formulas to tell Excel which numbers to compute.
To find a cell’s address, either make note of which column and row it lies in,
or click the cell and glance at the Formula bar (see Figure 1-2). The left side
of the Formula bar lists the address of the active cell, the cell you click in the
worksheet. In Figure 1-2, cell F7 is the active cell.
Workbooks and worksheets
When you create a new Excel file, you open a workbook, a file with three
worksheets in it. The worksheets are called Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3 (you
can change their names and add more worksheets). To get from worksheet
to worksheet, click tabs along the bottom of the Excel window. Why three
worksheets? Because you might need more than one worksheet for a single
project. Think of a workbook as a stack of worksheets. Besides calculating
the numbers in cells across the rows or down the columns of a worksheet,
you can make calculations throughout a workbook by using numbers from
different worksheets in a calculation.
Entering Data in a Worksheet
Entering data in a worksheet is an irksome activity. Fortunately, Excel offers
a few shortcuts to take the sting out of it. These pages explain how to enter
data in a worksheet, the different types of data, and how to enter text labels,
numbers, dates, and times.
Figure 1-3:
A chart

Entering Data in a Worksheet
462
The basics of entering data
What you can enter in a worksheet cell falls in one of four categories:
✦Text
✦A value (numeric, date, or time)
✦A logical value (True or False)
✦A formula that returns a value, logical value, or text
Still, no matter what type of data you’re entering, the basic steps are the
same:
1. Click the cell where you want to enter the data or text label.
As shown in Figure 1-4, a square appears around the cell to tell you that
the cell you clicked is now the active cell. Glance at the left side of the
Formula bar if you’re not sure of the address of the cell you’re about to
enter data in. The Formula bar lists the cell address.
2. Type the data in the cell.
If you find typing in the Formula bar easier, click and start typing there.
As soon as you type the first character, the Cancel button (an X) and
Enter button (a check mark) appear beside the Insert Function button
(labeled fx) on the Formula bar.
Enter the data here...
...or here.
Figure 1-4:

3. Press the Enter key to enter the number or label.
Besides pressing the Enter key, you can also press an arrow key (←, ↑,
→, ↓), press Tab, or click the Enter button (the check mark) on the
Formula bar.
If you change your mind about entering data, click the Cancel button or
press Esc to delete what you entered and start over.
Chapter 3 in this mini-book explains how to enter logical values and formu-
las. The next several pages describe how to enter text labels, numeric
values, date values, and time values.
The Paste Special command can come in very handy with worksheet data.
As numbers are updated in the source file, they can be updated automati-
cally in an Excel worksheet as well. Consider linking worksheets if your
adventures in Excel enable you to keep source data in one place. Book VIII,
Chapter 8 explains linking files.
Entering text labels
Sometimes a text entry is too long to fit in a cell. How Excel accommodates
text entries that are too wide depends on whether data is in the cell to the
right of the one you entered the text in:
✦If the cell to the right is empty, Excel lets the text spill into the next cell.
✦If the cell to the right contains data, the entry gets cut off. Nevertheless,
the text you entered is in the cell. Nothing gets lost when it can’t be 
displayed on-screen. You just can’t see the text or numbers except by
glancing at the Formula bar, where the contents of the cell can be seen
in their entirety.
To solve the problem of text that doesn’t fit in a cell, widen the column,
shorten the text entry, reorient the text (Chapter 4 of this mini-book explains
aligning numbers and text in columns and rows), or wrap the contents of the
cell. Wrapping runs the text down to the next line, much the way the text in
this paragraph runs to the next line when it reaches the right margin. Excel
makes rows taller to accommodate wrapped text in a cell. To wrap text in
cells, select the cells, go to the Home tab, and click the Wrap Text button
(you can find it in the Alignment group).
Entering numeric values
When a number is too large to fit in a cell, Excel displays pounds signs (###)
instead of a number or displays the number in scientific notation. You can
always glance at the Formula bar, however, to see a number in its entirety.
As well, you can always widen the column to display the entire number.

Entering Data in a Worksheet
464
To enter a fraction in a cell, enter a 0 or a whole number, a blank space, and
the fraction. For example, to enter 3⁄8, type a 0, press the spacebar, and type
3/8. To enter 53⁄8, type the 5, press the spacebar, and type 3/8. For its pur-
poses, Excel converts fractions to decimal numbers, as you can see by look-
ing in the Formula bar after you enter a fraction. For example, 53⁄8 displays as
5.375 in the Formula bar.
Here’s a little trick for entering numbers with decimals quickly. To spare
yourself the trouble of pressing the period key (.), you can tell Excel to enter
the period automatically. Instead of entering 12.45, for example, you can
simply enter 1245. Excel enters the period for you: 12.45. To perform this
trick, click the Office button, choose Excel Options, click the Advanced 
category in the Excel Options dialog box, click the Automatically Insert a
Decimal Point check box, and in the Places text box, enter the number of
decimal places you want for numbers. Deselect this option when you want to
go back to entering numbers the normal way.
Entering date and time values
Dates and times can be used in calculations, but entering a date or time
value in a cell can be problematic because these values must be entered in
such a way that Excel can recognize them as dates or times, not text.
Not that you need to know it especially, but Excel converts dates and times
to serial values for the purpose of being able to use dates and times in calcu-
lations. For example, July 31, 2004, is the number 38199. July 31, 2004, at
Noon is 38199.5. These serial values represent the number of whole days
since January 1, 1900. The portion of the serial value to the right of the deci-
mal point is the time, represented as a portion of a full day.
Entering date values
You can enter a date value in a cell in just about any format you choose, and
Excel understands that you’re entering a date. For example, enter a date in
any of the following formats and you’ll be all right:
m/d/yy
7/31/07
m-d-yyyy
7-31-2007
d-mmm-yy
31-Jul-07
Here are some basic things to remember about entering dates:
✦Date formats: You can quickly apply a format to dates by selecting cells
and using one of these techniques:
• On the Home tab, open the Number Format drop-down list and choose
Short Date (m/d/yyyy; 7/31/2007) or Long Date (day-of-the-week, month,
day, year; Tuesday, July 31, 2007), as shown in Figure 1-5.

✦Current date: Press Ctrl+; (semicolon) and press Enter to enter the cur-
rent date.
✦Current year’s date: If you don’t enter the year as part of the date, Excel
assumes that the date you entered is in the current year. For example, if
you enter a date in the m/d (7/31) format during the year 2007, Excel
enters the date as 7/31/07. As long as the date you want to enter is the
current year, you can save a little time when entering dates by not enter-
ing the year, as Excel enters it for you.
✦Dates on the Formula bar: No matter which format you use for dates,
dates are displayed in the Formula bar in the format that Excel prefers
for dates: m/d/yyyy (7/31/2007). How dates are displayed in the work-
sheet is up to you.
✦20th and 21st century two-digit years: When it comes to entering two-
digit years in dates, the digits 30 through 99 belong to the 20th century
(1930–1999), but the digits 00 through 29 belong to the 21st century
(2000–2029). For example, 7/31/07 refers to July 31, 2007, not July 31,
1907. To enter a date in 1929 or earlier, enter four digits instead of two to
describe the year: 7-31-1929. To enter a date in 2030 or later, enter four
digits instead of two: 7-31-2030.
✦Dates in formulas: To enter a date directly in a formula, enclose the
date in quotation marks. (Make sure that the cell where the formula
is entered has been given the Number format, not the Date format.)
For example, the formula =today( )-”1/1/2003” calculates the number of
days that have elapsed since January 1, 2003. Formulas are the subject
of Chapter 3 of this mini-book.
Entering time values
Excel recognizes time values that you enter in the following ways:
h:mm AM/PM
3:31 AM
h:mm:ss AM/PM
3:31:45 PM
Here are some things to remember when entering time values:
✦Use colons: Separate hours, minutes, and seconds with a colon (:).
✦Time formats: To change to the h:mm:ss AM/PM time format, select the
cells, go to the Home tab, and choose Time on the Number Format drop-
down list. You can also change time formats by clicking the Number
group button on the Home tab and selecting a time format on the
Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box.

✦AM or PM time designations: Unless you enter AM or PM with the time,
Excel assumes that you’re operating on military time. For example, 3:30
is considered 3:30 a.m.; 15:30 is 3:30 p.m. Don’t enter periods after the
letters am or pm (don’t enter a.m. or p.m.).
✦Current time: Press Ctrl+Shift+; (semicolon) and press Enter to enter the
current time.
✦Dates on the Formula bar: On the Formula bar, times are displayed in
this format: hours:minutes:seconds, followed by the letters AM or PM.
However, the time format used in cells is up to you.
Combining date and time values
You can combine dates and time values by entering the date, a blank space,
and the time:
✦7/31/04 3:31 am
✦7-31-04 3:31:45 pm
Quickly Entering Lists and Serial Data
with the AutoFill Command
Data that falls in the “serial” category — month names, days of the week,
and consecutive numbers and dates, for example — can be entered quickly
with the AutoFill command. Believe it or not, Excel recognizes certain kinds
of serial data and enters it for you as part of the AutoFill feature. Instead of
laboriously entering this data one piece at a time, you can enter it all at once
by dragging the mouse. Follow these steps to “autofill” cells:
1. Click the cell that is to be first in the series.
For example, if you intend to list the days of the week in consecutive
cells, click where the first day is to go.
2. Enter the first number, date, or list item in the series.
3. Move to the adjacent cell and enter the second number, date, or list
item in the series.
If you want to enter the same number or piece of text in adjacent cells, it
isn’t necessary to take this step, but Excel needs the first and second
items in the case of serial dates and numbers so that it can tell how
much to increase or decrease the given amount or time period in each
cell. For example, entering 5 and 10 tells Excel to increase the number
by 5 each time so that the next serial entry is 15.

Quickly Entering Lists and Serial Data with the AutoFill Command

4. Select the cell or cells you just entered data in.
To select a single cell, click it; to select two, drag over the cells. Chapter 2
of this mini-book describes all the ways to select cells in a worksheet.
Creating your own AutoFill list
As you probably know, Excel is capable of
completing lists on its own with the AutoFill
feature. You can enter the days of the week or
month names simply by entering one day or
month and dragging the AutoFill handle to
enter the others. Here’s some good news: The
AutoFill command can also reproduce the
names of your co-workers, the roster of a soft-
ball team, street names, or any other list that
you care to enter quickly in a worksheet.
Follow these steps to enter items for a list so
that you can enter them in the future by drag-
ging the AutoFill handle:
1. Click the Office button and choose Excel
Options to open the Excel Options dialogbox.
2. Select the Popular category.
3. Click the Edit Custom Lists button.
You see the Custom Lists dialog box.
4. In the List Entries box, enter items for the
list, and enter a comma after each item.
You can see how it’s done by glancing at
the Custom Lists box.
5. Click OK.

5. Click the AutoFill handle and start dragging in the direction in which
you want the data series to appear on your worksheet.
The AutoFill handle is the little black square in the lower-right corner of
the cell. Finding it can be difficult. Carefully move the mouse pointer
over the lower-right corner of the cell, and when you see the mouse
pointer change into a black cross, click and start dragging. As you drag,
the serial data appears in a pop-up box, as shown in Figure 1-7.
The AutoFill Options button appears after you enter the serial data. Click it
and choose an option if you want to copy cells or fill the cells without carry-
ing along their formats.
To enter the same number or text in several empty cells, drag over the cells
to select them or select each cell by holding down the Ctrl key as you click.
Then type a number or some text and press Ctrl+Enter.
Formatting Numbers, Dates, and Time Values
When you enter a number that Excel recognizes as belonging to one of its
formats, Excel assigns the number format automatically. Enter 45%, for
example, and Excel assigns the Percentage Style format. Enter $4.25, and
Excel assigns the Currency Style format. Besides assigning formats by hand,
however, you can assign them to cells from the get-go and spare yourself the
trouble of entering dollar signs, commas, percent signs, and other extrane-
ous punctuation. All you have to do is enter the raw numbers. Excel does the
window dressing for you.
Drag the AutoFill handle.

Formatting Numbers, Dates, and Time Values
470
Excel offers five number-formatting buttons on the Home tab — Accounting
Number Format, Percent Style, Comma Style, Increase Decimal, and Decrease
Decimal. Select cells with numbers in them and click one of these buttons to
change how numbers are formatted:
✦Accounting Number Format: Places a dollar sign before the number and
gives it two decimal places. You can open the drop-down list on this
button and choose a currency symbol apart from the dollar sign.
✦Percent Style: Places a percent sign after the number and converts the
number to a percentage.
✦Comma Style: Places commas in the number.
✦Increase Decimal: Increases the number of decimal places by one.
✦Decrease Decimal: Decreases the number of decimal places by one.
To choose among many formats and to format dates and time values as well
as numbers, click the Number group button on the Home tab. Then make
your selections on the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box. Figure 1-8
shows this dialog box. Choose a category and select options to describe
how you want numbers or text to appear.
To strip formats from the data in cells, select the cells, go to the Home tab,
click the Clear button, and choose Clear Formats.

Conditional Formats for Calling Attention to Data
471
Entering ZIP codes can be problematic because Excel strips the initial zero
from the number if it begins with a zero. To get around that problem, visit
the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box (see Figure 1-8), choose
Special in the Category list, and select a ZIP Code option.
Conditional Formats for Calling Attention to Data
A conditional format is one that applies when data meets certain conditions.
To call attention to numbers greater than 10,000, for example, you can tell
Excel to highlight those numbers automatically. To highlight negative num-
bers, you can tell Excel to display them in bright red. Conditional formats
help you analyze and understand data better.
Select the cells that are candidates for conditional formatting and follow
these steps to tell Excel when and how to format the cells:
1. On the Home tab, click the Conditional Formatting button (you may
have to click the Styles button first, depending on the size of your
screen).
2. Choose Highlight Cells Rules or Top/Bottom Rules on the drop-
down list.
You see a submenu with choices about establishing the rule for whether
values in the cells are highlighted or otherwise made more prominent:
• Highlight Cells Rules: These rules are for calling attention to data if
it falls in a numerical or date range, or it’s greater or lesser than a
specific value. For example, you can highlight cells that are greater
than 400.
• Top/Bottom Cells: These rules are for calling attention to data if it
falls within a percentage range relative to all the cells you selected.
For example, you can highlight cells with data that falls in the bottom
10-percent range.
3. Choose an option on the submenu.
You see a dialog box similar to the ones in Figure 1-9.
4. On the left side of the dialog box, establish the rule for flagging data.
5. On the With drop-down list, choose how you want to call attention to
the data.
For example, you can display the data in red or yellow. If you choose
Custom Format on the drop-down list, you can open the Format Cells
dialog box, where you can choose a font style or color for the text.
6. Click OK.

Establishing Data-Validation Rules

To remove conditional formats, select the cells with the formats, click the
Conditional Formatting button, and choose Clear Rules➪Clear Rules from

Establishing Data-Validation Rules
By nature, people are prone to enter data incorrectly because the task of
entering data is so dull. This is why data-validation rules are invaluable. A
data-validation rule is a rule concerning what kind of data can be entered in a
cell. When you select a cell that has been given a rule, an input message tells
you what to enter, as shown in Figure 1-10. And if you enter the data incor-
rectly, an error alert tells you as much, also shown in Figure 1-10.
Data-validation rules are an excellent defense against sloppy data entry and
that itchy feeling you get when you’re in the middle of an irksome task. In a
cell that records date entries, you can require dates to fall in a certain time
frame. In a cell that records text entries, you can choose an item from a list
instead of typing it yourself. In a cell that records numeric entries, you can
require the number to fall within a certain range. Table 1-1 describes the
different categories of data-validation rules.

quickly here and there in a worksheet. You also discover a couple of tech-
niques for entering data quickly, how to select cells, and how to copy and
move data in cells. This chapter describes how to move, delete, and rename
worksheets, as well as protect them from being edited or altered.
Editing Worksheet Data
Not everyone enters data correctly the first time. To edit data you entered in
a cell, do one of the following:
✦Double-click the cell. Doing so places the cursor squarely in the cell,
where you can start deleting or entering numbers and text.
✦Click the cell and press F2. This technique also lands the cursor in
the cell.
✦Click the cell you want to edit. With this technique, you edit the data
on the Formula bar.

Moving Around in a Worksheet
476
If nothing happens when you double-click, or if pressing F2 lands the cursor
in the Formula bar, not a cell, somebody has been fooling with the Options
settings. Click the Office button, choose Excel Options, select the Advanced
category in the Excel Options dialog box, and click the Allow Editing Directly
in Cells check box.
Moving Around in a Worksheet
Going from place to place gets progressively more difficult as a worksheet
gets larger. Luckily for you, Excel offers keyboard shortcuts for jumping
around. Table 2-1 describes these keyboard shortcuts. (If the keyboard
shortcuts in Table 2-1 don’t work on your machine, someone has told Excel
to adopt the keyboard shortcuts of Lotus 1-2-3, another spreadsheet pro-
gram. To remedy the problem, click the Office button, choose Excel Options,
select the Advanced category in the Excel Options dialog box, and deselect
the Transition Navigation Keys check box near the bottom of the screen.)

ent areas. Drag the scroll box to cover long distances. To cover long 
distances very quickly, hold down the Shift key as you drag the scroll
box on the vertical scroll bar.
✦Scroll wheel on the mouse: If your mouse is equipped with a scroll
wheel, turn the wheel to quickly scroll up and down.
✦Name box: Enter a cell address in the Name box and press Enter to go to
the cell. As shown in Figure 2-1, the Name box is found to the left of the
Formula bar.

Getting a Better Look at the Worksheet
Especially when you’re entering data, it pays to get a good look at the work-
sheet. You need to know which column and row you’re entering data in.
These pages explain techniques for changing your view of a worksheet so
you always know where you are. Read on to discover how to freeze, split,

and hide columns and rows. (On the subject of changing views, Book I,
Chapter 3 explains an essential technique for changing views: zooming in
and zooming out.)
Freezing and splitting columns and rows
Sometimes your adventures in a worksheet take you to a faraway cell
address, such as X31 or C39. Out there in the wilderness, it’s hard to tell
where to enter data because you can’t see the data labels in the first column
or first row that tell you where to enter data on the worksheet.
To see one part of a worksheet no matter how far you stray from it, you can
split the worksheet or freeze columns and rows on-screen. In Figure 2-2, I split
the worksheet so that column A, Property, always appears on-screen, no
matter how far I scroll to the right; similarly, row 1 also appears at the top of
the worksheet no matter how far I scroll down. Notice how the row numbers
and column letters are interrupted in Figure 2-2. Because I split the screen,
I always know what data to enter in a cell because I can clearly see property
names in the first column and the column headings along the top of the
worksheet.
Drag to adjust the split.
Double-click to remove a split line.

Freezing columns or rows on a worksheet works much like splitting except
that lines instead of gray bars appear on-screen to show which columns and
rows are frozen, and you can’t adjust where the split occurs by dragging the
boundary where the worksheet is split.
Splitting the worksheet is superior to freezing columns or rows because, for
one, you can drag the split lines to new locations when you split the work-
sheet, and moreover, you can remove a horizontal or vertical split simply by
double-clicking it. However, if your goal is simply to freeze the topmost row
or leftmost column in your worksheet, use a Freeze Panes command because
all you have to do is click the Freeze Panes button on the View tab and
choose Freeze Top Row or Freeze First Column.
Giving the Split or Freeze Panes command
Follow these steps to split or freeze columns and rows on-screen:
1. Click the cell directly below the row you want to freeze or split, and
click in the column to the right of the column that you want to freeze
or split.
In Figure 2-2, for example, I clicked cell B2, row 2 being below row 1, the
row with the column labels (Property, Management Fee, and so on), and
column B being to the right of column A, the column with the row labels
(the property addresses).
2. On the View tab, split or freeze the columns and rows.
Go to the View tab and use one of these techniques:
• Splitting: Click the Split button. The other way to split a worksheet is
to grab hold of a split bar, the little division markers directly above
the vertical scroll bar (refer to Figure 2-2) and directly to the left of
the horizontal scroll bar. You can tell where split bars are because
the pointer turns into a double arrow when it’s over a split bar. Click
and drag a split bar to split the screen vertically or horizontally.
• Freezing: Click the Freeze Panes button and choose one of three
Freeze options on the drop-down list. The second and third options,
respectively, freeze the top row or first column. The first option,
Freeze Panes, freezes the column(s) to the left and the row(s) above
the cell you select in Step 1.
Bars or lines appear on-screen to show which row(s) and column(s)
have been frozen or split. Move where you will in the worksheet. The
column(s) and row(s) you froze or split stay on-screen.

Unsplitting and unfreezing
Use one of these techniques to keep your worksheet from splitting or freezing
to death:
✦Unsplitting: Click the Split button again; double-click one of the split bars
to remove it; or drag a split bar into the top or left side of the worksheet
window.
Your own customized views
After you go to the trouble of freezing the screen
or zooming in to a position you’re comfortable
with, you may as well save your view of the
screen as a customized view. That way, you can
call upon the customized view whenever you
need it. View settings, the window size, the posi-
tion of the grid on-screen, and cells that are
selected can all be saved in a customized view.
Follow these steps to create a customized view:
1. On the View tab, click the Custom Views
button.
You see the Custom Views dialog box. It
lists views you’ve already created, if you’ve
created any.
2. Click the Add button.
The Add View dialog box appears.
3. Enter a name for the view and click OK.
To switch to a customized view, click the
Custom Views button, select a view in the
Custom Views dialog box, and click the Show

✦Unfreezing: Click the Freeze Panes button on the View tab and choose
Unfreeze Panes on the drop-down list.
Hiding columns and rows
Another way to take the clutter out of a worksheet is to temporarily hide
columns and rows:
✦Hiding columns or rows: Drag over the column letters or row num-
bers of the columns or rows that you want to hide. Dragging this way
selects entire columns or rows. Then click the Format button on the
Home tab, choose Hide & Unhide, and choose Hide Columns or Hide
Rows.
✦Unhiding columns and rows: Select columns to the right and left of the
hidden columns, or select rows above and below the hidden rows. To
select columns or rows, drag over their letters or numbers. Then click
the Format button on the Home tab, choose Hide & Unhide, and choose
Unhide Columns or Unhide Rows.
It’s easy to forget where you hid columns or rows. To make sure all columns
and rows in your worksheet are displayed, click the Select All button (or press
Ctrl+A) to select your entire worksheet. Then click the Format button and
choose Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Columns; click the Format button again
and choose Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Rows.
Comments for Documenting Your Worksheet
It may happen that you return to your worksheet days or months from now
and discover to your dismay that you don’t know why certain numbers or
formulas are there. For that matter, someone else may inherit your work-
sheet and be mystified as to what the heck is going on. To take the mystery
out of a worksheet, document it by entering comments here and there. A
comment is a note that describes part of a worksheet. Each comment is
connected to a cell. You can tell where a comment is because a small red
triangle appears in the corner of cells that have been commented on. Move
the pointer over one of these triangles and you see the pop-up box, a com-
ment, and the name of the person who entered the comment, as shown in
Figure 2-3. Click the Show All Comments button on the Review tab to see
every comment in a worksheet.

Comments for Documenting Your Worksheet

Here’s everything a mere mortal needs to know about comments:
✦Entering a comment: Click the cell that deserves the comment, go to the
Review tab, and click the New Comment button (or press Shift+F2).
Enter your comment in the pop-up box. Click in a different cell when
you’re done entering your comment.
✦Reading a comment: Move the pointer over the small red triangle and
read the comment in the pop-up box.
✦Finding comments: On the Review tab, click the Previous or Next button
to go from comment to comment.
✦Editing a comment: Select the cell with the comment, click the Edit
Comment button on the Review tab and edit the comment in the pop-
up box.
✦Deleting comments: Click a cell with a comment and then click the
Delete button on the Review tab or right-click the cell and choose Delete
Comment. To delete several comments, select them by Ctrl+clicking and
then click the Delete button.
✦Deleting all comments in a worksheet: Select all comments and then
click the Delete button on the Review tab. You can select all comments
by clicking the Find & Select button on the Home tab, choosing Go To,
and in the Go To dialog box, clicking the Special button and choosing
Comments in the Go to Special dialog box.

Selecting Cells in a Worksheet
To copy, move, delete, and format numbers and words in a worksheet, you
have to select the cells in which the numbers and words are found. Here are
ways to select cells and the data inside them:
✦A block of cells: Drag diagonally across the worksheet from one corner
of the block of cells to the opposite corner. You can also click in one
corner and Shift+click the opposite corner.
✦Adjacent cells in a row or column: Drag across the cells.
✦Cells in various places: While holding down the Ctrl key, click different
cells.
✦A row or rows: Click a row number to select an entire row. Click and
drag down the row numbers to select several adjacent rows.
✦A column or columns: Click a column letter to select an entire column.
Click and drag across letters to select several adjacent columns.
✦Entire worksheet: Click the Select All button, the square to the left of
the column letters and above the row numbers; press Ctrl+A; or press
Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar.
Press Ctrl+Spacebar to select the column that the active cell is in; press
Shift+Spacebar to select the row where the active cell is.
You can enter the same data item in several different cells by selecting cells
and then entering the data in one cell and pressing Ctrl+Enter. This technique
comes in very handy, for example, when you want to enter a placeholder
zero (0) in several different cells.

Deleting, Copying, and Moving Data
In the course of putting together a worksheet, it is sometimes necessary to
delete, copy, and move cell contents. Here are instructions for doing these
chores:
✦Deleting cell contents: Select the cells and then press the Delete key,
click the Clear button on the Home tab and choose Clear Contents, or
right-click and choose Clear Contents. (Avoid the Delete button on the
Home tab for deleting cell contents. Clicking that button deletes cells as
well as their contents.)
✦Copying and moving cell contents: Select the cells and use one of these
techniques:
• Cut or Copy and Paste commands: When you paste the data, click
where you want the first cell of the block of cells you’re copying or
moving to go. (Book I, Chapter 2 explains copying and moving data in
detail.) Be careful not to overwrite cells with data in them when you
copy or move data. After you paste data, you see the Paste Options
button. Click this button and choose an option from the drop-down
list to format the data in different ways.
• Drag and drop: Move the pointer to the edge of the cell block, click
when you see the four-headed arrow, and start dragging. Hold down
the Ctrl key to copy the data.
Handling the Worksheets in a Workbook
As a glance at the bottom of the worksheet tells you, each workbook comes
with three worksheets named — not very creatively — Sheet1, Sheet2, and
Sheet3. Follow these instructions to move among worksheets or to add,
delete, rename and change the order of worksheets:
✦Moving among worksheets: To go from one worksheet to another, click
a worksheet tab along the bottom of the screen. If you can’t see a tab,
click one of the scroll arrows to the left of the worksheet tabs.
✦Renaming a worksheet: Right-click the worksheet tab, choose Rename
on the shortcut menu, type a new name, and press Enter. You can also
click the Format button on the Home tab, choose Rename Sheet on the
drop-down list, and enter a new name. Spaces are allowed in names, and
names can be 31 characters long. Brackets ([]) are allowed in names, but
you can’t use these symbols: / \ : ? and *.

✦Selecting worksheets: Click the worksheet’s tab to select it. To select
several worksheets, Ctrl+click their tabs or click the first tab and then
Shift+click the last tab in the set. To select all the worksheets, right-click
a tab and choose Select All Sheets on the shortcut menu.
✦Rearranging worksheets: Drag the worksheet tab to a new location. As
you drag, a tiny black arrow and a page icon appear to show you where
the worksheet will land after you release the mouse button. You can also
select a sheet, click the Format button on the Home tab, and choose
Move or Copy Sheet on the drop-down list. The Move or Copy dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 2-4. Click the sheet in the Before Sheet list
where you want the worksheet to go and click OK.
✦Inserting a new worksheet: On the Home tab, open the drop-down list
on the Insert button and choose Insert Sheet; click the Insert Sheet
button (you can find it to the right of the worksheet tabs); or press
Shift+F11.
✦Deleting a worksheet: Select the sheet, and on the Home tab, open the
drop-down list on the Delete button and choose Delete Sheet. You can
also right-click a worksheet tab and choose Delete.
✦Copying a worksheet: Hold down the Ctrl key and drag the worksheet
tab to a new location.
✦Color-coding a worksheet: Right-click a worksheet tab and choose Tab
Color. Then select a color on the submenu, or choose More Colors and
select a color in the Colors dialog box. You can also select a worksheet
tab, click the Format button on the Home tab, choose Tab Color on the
drop-down list, and choose a color on the submenu.

Keeping Others from Tampering with Worksheets

You can change the size of columns or apply numeric formats to the same
addresses in different worksheets by selecting all the sheets first and then 
formatting one worksheet. The formats apply to all the worksheets that you
select. Being able to format several different worksheets simultaneously
comes in handy, for example, when your workbook tracks monthly data and
each worksheet pertains to one month. Of course, another way to handle
worksheets with similar data is to create the first worksheet and copy it to the
second, third, and fourth worksheets with the Copy and Paste commands.
Keeping Others from Tampering with Worksheets
People with savvy and foresight sometimes set up workbooks so that one
worksheet holds raw data and the other worksheets hold formulas that cal-
culate the raw data. This technique prevents others from tampering with the
raw data. Furthermore, if the worksheet with raw data is hidden, the chance
it will be tampered with is lower; and if the worksheet is protected, no one
can tamper with it unless they have a password. These pages explain how to
hide a worksheet so others are less likely to find it and how to protect a
worksheet from being edited.
Hiding a worksheet
Follow these instructions to hide and unhide worksheets:
✦Hiding a worksheet: Right-click the worksheet’s tab and choose Hide on
the shortcut menu. You can also display the worksheet, click the Format
button on the Home tab, and choose Hide & Unhide➪Hide Sheet.
✦Unhiding a worksheet: Right-click any worksheet tab and choose Unhide,
or click the Format button on the Home tab and choose Hide & Unhide➪
Unhide Sheet. You see the Unhide dialog box. Select the name of the
worksheet you want to unhide and click OK.
Protecting a worksheet
Protecting a worksheet means to restrict others from changing it — from for-
matting it, inserting new rows and columns, or deleting rows and columns,
among other tasks. You can also prevent any editorial changes whatsoever
from being made to a worksheet. Follow these steps to protect a worksheet
from tampering by others:
1. Select the worksheet that needs protection.
2. On the Review tab, click the Protect Sheet button.
You see the Protect Sheet dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-5. You can
also open this dialog box by clicking the Format button on the Home tab
and choosing Protect Sheet.

3. Enter a password in the Password to Unprotect Sheet box if you want
only people with the password to be able to unprotect the worksheet
after you protect it.
4. On the Allow All Users of This Worksheet To list, select the check box
next to the name of each task that you want to permit others to do.
For example, click the Format Cells check box if you want others to be
able to format cells.
Deselect the Select Locked Cells check box to prevent any changes from
being made to the worksheet. By default, all worksheet cells are locked,
and by preventing others from selecting locked cells, you effectively pre-
vent them from editing any cells.
5. Click OK.
If you entered a password in Step 3, you must enter it again in the
Confirm Password dialog box and click OK.
To unprotect a worksheet that you protected, click the Unprotect Sheet
button on the Review tab. You must enter a password if you elected to
require others to have a password before they can unprotect a worksheet.

ormulas are where it’s at as far as Excel is concerned. After you know
how to construct formulas — and constructing them is pretty easy —
you can put Excel to work. You can make the numbers speak to you. You can
turn a bunch of unruly numbers into meaningful figures and statistics.
This chapter explains what a formula is, how to enter a formula, and how to
enter a formula quickly. You also discover how to copy formulas from cell
to cell and how to keep formula errors from creeping into your workbooks.
Finally, this chapter explains how to make use of the hundred or so func-
tions that Excel offers.
How Formulas Work
A formula, you may recall from the sleepy hours you spent in the back of
math class, is a way to calculate numbers. For example, 2+3=5 is a formula.
When you enter a formula in a cell, Excel computes the formula and displays
its results in the cell. Click in cell A3 and enter =2+3, for example, and Excel
displays the number 5 in cell A3.
Referring to cells in formulas
As well as numbers, Excel formulas can refer to the contents of different
cells. When a formula refers to a cell, the number in the cell is used to com-
pute the formula. In Figure 3-1, for example, cell A1 contains the number 2;

How Formulas Work
490
cell A2 contains the number 3; and cell A3 contains the formula =A1+A2. As
shown in cell A3, the result of the formula is 5. If I change the number in cell
A1 from 2 to 3, the result of the formula in cell A3 (=A1+A2) becomes 6, not 5.
When a formula refers to a cell and the number in a cell changes, the result
of the formula changes as well.
To see the value of using cell references in formulas, consider the worksheet
shown in Figure 3-2. The purpose of this worksheet is to track the budget of
a school’s Parent Teacher Association (PTA):
✦Column C, Actual Income, lists income from different sources.
✦Column D, Projected Income, shows what the PTA members thought
income from these sources would be.
✦Column E, Over/Under Budget, shows how actual income compares to
projected income from the different sources.

Book V
Chapter 3

Functions for
Crunching Numbers
How Formulas Work
491
As the figures in the Actual Income column (column C) are updated, figures
in the Over/Under Budget column (column E) and the Total Income row
(row 8) change instantaneously. These figures change instantaneously
because the formulas refer to the numbers in cells, not to unchanging
numbers (known as constants).
Figure 3-3 shows the formulas used to calculate the data in the worksheet in
Figure 3-2. In column E, formulas deduct the numbers in column D from the
numbers in column C to show where the PTA over- or under-budgeted for
the different sources of income. In row 8, you can see how the SUM function
is used to total cells in rows 3 through 7. The end of this chapter explains
how to use functions in formulas.
Excel is remarkably good about updating cell references in formulas when
you move cells. To see how good Excel is, consider what happens to cell
addresses in formulas when you delete a row in a worksheet. If a formula
refers to cell C1 but you delete row B, row C becomes row B, and the value in
cell C1 changes addresses from C1 to B1. You would think that references
in formulas to cell C1 would be out of date, but you would be wrong. Excel
automatically adjusts all formulas that refer to cell C1. Those formulas now
refer to cell B1 instead.
In case you want to know, you can display formulas in worksheet cells
instead of the results of formulas, as was done in Figure 3-3, by pressing
Ctrl+’ or clicking the Show Formulas button on the Formulas tab (you may
have to click the Formula Auditing button first, depending on the size of
your screen). Click the Show Formulas button a second time to see formula
results again.
Referring to formula results in formulas
Besides referring to cells with numbers in them, you can refer to formula
results in a cell. Consider the worksheet shown in Figure 3-4. The purpose of
this worksheet is to track scoring by the players on a basketball team:
Figure 3-3:
The
formulas
used to
generate
the numbers
in Figure 3-2.

How Formulas Work
492
✦The Totals column (column E) shows the total points each player has
scored in the three games.
✦The Average column (column F), using the formula results in the Totals
column, determines how much each player has scored on average. The
Average column does that by dividing the results in column E by 3, the
number of games played.
In this case, Excel uses the results of the total-calculation formulas in
column E to compute average points per game in column F.
Operators in formulas
Addition, subtraction, and division aren’t the only operators you can use in
formulas. Table 3-1 explains the arithmetic operators you can use and the
key you press to enter each operator. In the table, operators are listed in the
order of precedence.

Another way to compute a formula is to make use of a function. As “Working
with Functions” explains later in this chapter, a function is a built-in formula
that comes with Excel. SUM, for example, adds the numbers in cells. AVG
finds the average of different numbers.
The order of precedence
When a formula includes more than one oper-
ator, the order in which the operators appear in
the formula matters a lot. Consider this formula:
=2+3*4
Does this formula result in 14 (2+[3*4]) or 20
([2+3]*4)? The answer is 14 because Excel per-
forms multiplication before addition in formu-
las. In other words, multiplication takes
precedence over addition. The order in which
calculations are made in a formula that
includes different operators is called the order
of precedence. Be sure to remember the order
of precedence when you construct complex
formulas with more than one operator:
1. Percent (%)
2. Exponentiation (^)
3. Multiplication (*) and division (/); leftmost
operations are calculated first
4. Addition (+) and subtraction (-); leftmost
operations are calculated first
5. Concatenation (&)
6. Comparison (+, <, <=, >,>=, and <>)
To get around the order of precedence prob-
lem, enclose parts of formulas in parentheses.
Operations in parentheses are calculated
before all other parts of a formula. For example,
the formula =2+3*4 equals 20 when it is written
this way: =(2+3)*4.

The Basics of Entering a Formula
494
The Basics of Entering a Formula
No matter what kind of formula you enter, no matter how complex the for-
mula is, follow these basic steps to enter it:
1. Click the cell where you want to enter the formula.
2. Click in the Formula bar.
3. Enter the equals sign (=).
You must be sure to enter the equals sign before you enter a formula.
Without it, Excel thinks you’re entering text or a number, not a formula.
4. Enter the formula.
For example, enter =B1*.06. Make sure that you enter all cell addresses
correctly. By the way, you can enter lowercase letters in cell references.
Excel changes them to uppercase after you finish entering the formula.
The next section in this chapter explains how to enter cell addresses
quickly in formulas.
5. Press Enter or click the Enter button (the check mark).
The result of the formula appears in the cell.
Speed Techniques for Entering Formulas
Entering formulas and making sure that all cell references are correct is a
tedious activity, but fortunately for you, Excel offers a few techniques to
make entering formulas easier. Read on to find out how ranges make entering
cell references easier and how you can enter cell references in formulas by
pointing and clicking. You also find instructions here for copying formulas.
Clicking cells to enter cell references
The hardest part about entering a formula is entering the cell references cor-
rectly. You have to squint to see which row and column the cell you want to
refer to is in. You have to carefully type the right column letter and row
number. However, instead of typing a cell reference, you can click the cell
you want to refer to in a formula.
In the course of entering a formula, simply click the cell on your worksheet
that you want to reference. As shown in Figure 3-5, shimmering marquee
lights appear around the cell that you clicked so that you can clearly see
which cell you’re referring to. The cell’s reference address, meanwhile,
appears in the Formula bar. In Figure 3-5, I clicked cell F3 instead of entering
its reference address on the Formula bar. The reference F3 appears on the
Formula bar, and the marquee lights appear around cell F3.

495
Get in the habit of pointing and clicking cells to enter cell references in 
formulas. Clicking cells is easier than typing cell addresses, and the cell ref-
erences are entered more accurately.
Entering a cell range
A cell range is a line or block of cells in a worksheet. Instead of typing cell ref-
erence addresses one at a time, you can simply select cells on your worksheet.
In Figure 3-6, I selected cells C3, D3, E3, and F3 to form cell range C3:F3. This
spares me the trouble of entering the cell addresses one at a time: C3, D3, E3,
and F3. The formula in Figure 3-6 uses the SUM function to total the numeric
values in cell range C3:F3. Notice the marquee lights around the range C3:F3.
The lights show precisely which range you’re selecting. Cell ranges come in
especially handy where functions are concerned (see “Working with
Functions” later in this chapter).
Select cells to enter a range.

Speed Techniques for Entering Formulas
496
To identify a cell range, Excel lists the outermost cells in the range and
places a colon (:) between cell addresses:
✦A cell range comprising cells A1, A2, A3, and A4 is listed this way: A1:A4.
✦A cell range comprising a block of cells from A1 to D4 is listed this
way: A1:D4.
You can enter cell ranges on your own without selecting cells. To do so, type
the first cell in the range, enter a colon, and type the last cell.
Naming cell ranges so that you 
can use them in formulas
Whether you type cell addresses yourself or drag across cells to enter a cell
range, entering cell address references is a chore. Entering =C1+C2+C3+C4, for
example, can cause a finger cramp; entering =SUM(C1:C4) is no piece of cake,
either. To take the tedium out of entering cell ranges in formulas, you can
name cell ranges. Then, to enter a cell range in a formula, all you have to do is
select a name in the Paste Name dialog box or click the Use in Formula button
on the Formulas tab, as shown in Figure 3-7. Naming cell ranges has an added
benefit. You can choose a name from the Name Box drop-down list and go
directly to the cell range whose name you choose, as shown in Figure 3-7.
Choose a name to move there.
Enter a named cell range in a formula.

Naming cell ranges has one disadvantage, and it’s a big one. Excel doesn’t
adjust cell references when you copy a formula with a range name from one
cell to another. A range name always refers to the same set of cells. Later
in this chapter, “Copying Formulas from Cell to Cell” explains how to copy
formulas.
Creating a cell range name
Follow these steps to create a cell range name:
1. Select the cells that you want to name.
2. On the Formulas tab, click the Define Name button.
You see the New Name dialog box.
3. Enter a descriptive name in the Name box.
Names can’t begin with a number or include blank spaces.
4. On the Scope drop-down list, choose Workbook or a worksheet name.
Choose a worksheet name if you intend to use the range name you’re
creating only in formulas that you construct in a single worksheet. If
your formulas will refer to cell range addresses in different worksheets,
choose Workbook so that you can use the range name wherever you go
in your workbook.
5. Enter a comment to describe the range name, if you want.
Enter a comment if doing so will help you remember where the cells
you’re naming are located or what type of information they hold. As I
explain shortly, you can read comments in the Name Manager dialog
box, the place where you go to edit and delete range names.
6. Click OK.
In case you’re in a hurry, here’s a fast way to enter a cell range name: Select
the cells for the range, click in the Name Box (you can find it to the left of the
Formula bar, as shown in Figure 3-7), enter a name for the range, and press
the Enter key.
Entering a range name as part of a formula
To include a cell range name in a formula, click in the Formula bar where you
want to enter the range name and then use one of these techniques to enter
the name:
✦On the Formulas tab, click the Use in Formula button and choose a cell
range name on the drop-down list (refer to Figure 3-7).

Speed Techniques for Entering Formulas
498
✦Press F3 or click the Use in Formula button and choose Paste Names
on the drop-down list. You see the Paste Name dialog box (refer to
Figure 3-7). Select a cell range name and click OK.
Quickly traveling to a cell range that you named
To go quickly to a cell range you named, open the Name Box drop-down list
and choose a name (refer to Figure 3-7). The Name Box drop-down list is
located to the left of the Formula bar.
To make this trick work, the cursor can’t be in the Formula bar. The Name
Box drop-down list isn’t available when you’re constructing a formula.
Managing cell range names
To rename or delete cell range names, click the Name Manager button on the
Formulas tab. You see the Name Manager dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-8.
This dialog box lists names, cell values in names, the worksheet on which
the range name is found, and whether the range name can be applied
throughout a workbook or only in one worksheet. To rename or delete a cell
range name, select it in the dialog box and use these techniques:
✦Renaming: Click the Edit button and enter a new name in the Edit Name
dialog box.
✦Deleting: Click the Delete button and click OK in the confirmation box.

Copying Formulas from Cell to Cell
499
Referring to cells in different worksheets
Excel gives you the opportunity to use data from different worksheets in a
formula. If one worksheet lists sales figures from January and the next lists
sales figures from February, you can construct a “grand total” formula in
either worksheet to tabulate sales in the two-month period. A reference to a
cell on a different worksheet is called a 3D reference.
Construct the formula as you normally would, but when you want to refer to
a cell or cell range in a different worksheet, click a worksheet tab to move
to the other worksheet and select the cell or range of cells there. Without
returning to the original worksheet, complete your formula in the Formula
bar and press Enter. Excel returns you to the original worksheet, where you
can see the results of your formula.
The only things odd about constructing formulas across worksheets are the
cell references. As a glance at the Formula bar tells you, cell addresses in
cross-worksheet formulas list the sheet name and an exclamation point (!) as
well as the cell address itself. For example, this formula in Worksheet 1 adds
the number in cell A4 to the numbers in cells D5 and E5 in Worksheet 2:
=A4+Sheet2!D5+Sheet2!E5
This formula in Worksheet 2 multiplies the number in cell E18 by the number
in cell C15 in Worksheet 1:
=E18*Sheet1!C15
This formula in Worksheet 2 finds the average of the numbers in the cell
range C7:F7 in Worksheet 1: 
=AVERAGE(Sheet1!C7:F7)
Copying Formulas from Cell to Cell
Often in worksheets, the same formula but with different cell references is
used across a row or down a column. For example, in the worksheet shown
in Figure 3-9, column F totals the rainfall figures in rows 7 through 11. To
enter formulas for totaling the rainfall figures in column F, you could labori-
ously enter formulas in cells F7, F8, F9, F10, and F11. But a faster way is to
enter the formula once in cell F7 and then copy the formula in F7 down the
column to cells F8, F9, F10, and F11.

Copying Formulas from Cell to Cell
500
When you copy a formula to a new cell, Excel adjusts the cell references in
the formula so that the formula works in the cells to which it has been
copied. Astounding! Opportunities to copy formulas abound on most work-
sheets. And copying formulas is the fastest and safest way to enter formulas
in a worksheet.
Follow these steps to copy a formula:
1. Select the cell with the formula you want to copy down a column or
across a row.
2. Drag the AutoFill handle across the cells to which you want to copy
the formula.
This is the same AutoFill handle you drag to enter serial data (see
Chapter 1 of this mini-book about entering lists and serial data with the
AutoFill command). The AutoFill handle is the small black square in the
lower-right corner of the cell. When you move the mouse pointer over it,
it changes to a black cross. Figure 3-9 shows a formula being copied.
3. Release the mouse button.
If I were you, I would click in the cells to which you copied the formula
and glance at the Formula bar to make sure that the formula was copied
correctly. I’d bet you it was.
Drag the AutoFill handle.

Detecting and Correcting Errors in Formulas
501
You can also copy formulas with the Copy and Paste commands. Just make
sure that cell references refer correctly to the surrounding cells.
Detecting and Correcting Errors in Formulas
It happens. Everyone makes an error from time to time when entering formu-
las in cells. Especially in a worksheet in which formula results are calculated
into other formulas, a single error in one formula can spread like a virus and
cause miscalculations throughout a worksheet. To prevent that from happen-
ing, Excel offers several ways to correct errors in formulas. You can correct
them one at a time, run the error checker, and trace cell references, as the
following pages explain.
By the way, if you want to see formulas in cells instead of formula results,
click the Show Formulas button on the Formulas tab (you may have to click
the Formula Auditing button first, depending on the size of your screen).
Sometimes seeing formulas this way helps to detect formula errors.
Correcting errors one at a time
When Excel detects what it thinks is a formula that has been entered incor-
rectly, a small green triangle appears in the upper-left corner of the cell where
you entered the formula. And if the error is especially egregious, an error 
message — three or four cryptic letters preceded by a pound sign (#) —
appears in the cell. Table 3-2 explains common error messages.
Table 3-2
Common Formula Error Messages
Message
What Went Wrong
#DIV/0!
You tried to divide a number by a zero (0) or an empty cell.
#NAME
You used a cell range name in the formula, but the name isn’t defined.
Sometimes this error occurs because you type the name incorrectly.
(Earlier in this chapter, “Naming cell ranges so that you can use them in
formulas” explains how to name cell ranges.)
#N/A
The formula refers to an empty cell, so no data is available for computing
the formula. Sometimes people enter N/A in a cell as a placeholder to
signal the fact that data isn’t entered yet. Revise the formula or enter a
number or formula in the empty cells.
#NULL
The formula refers to a cell range that Excel can’t understand. Make sure
that the range is entered correctly.
#NUM
An argument you use in your formula is invalid.
#REF
The cell or range of cells that the formula refers to isn’t there.
#VALUE
The formula includes a function that’s used incorrectly, takes an invalid
argument, or is misspelled. Make sure that the function uses the right
argument and is spelled correctly.

Detecting and Correcting Errors in Formulas
502
To find out more about a formula error and perhaps correct it, select the cell
with the green triangle and then click the Error button. This small button
appears beside a cell with a formula error after you click the cell. The drop-
down list on the Error button offers opportunities for correcting the formula
error and finding out more about it, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Running the error checker
Another way to tackle formula errors is to run the error checker. When the
checker encounters what it thinks is an error, the Error Checking dialog box
tells you what the error is, as shown in Figure 3-10. To run the error checker,
go to the Formulas tab and click the Error Checking button (you may have to
click the Formula Auditing button first, depending on the size of your screen).
If you see clearly what the error is, click the Edit in Formula Bar button,
repair the error in the Formula bar, and click the Resume button in the
dialog box (you find this button at the top of the dialog box). If the error isn’t
one that really needs correcting, either click the Ignore Error button or click
the Next button to send the error checker in search of the next error in your
worksheet.
Tracing cell references
In a complex worksheet in which formulas are piled on top of one another
and the results of some formulas are computed into other formulas, it helps
to be able to trace cell references. By tracing cell references, you can see
how the data in a cell figures into a formula in another cell, or if the cell con-
tains a formula, which cells the formula gathers data from to make its com-
putation. You can get a better idea of how your worksheet is constructed,
and in so doing, find structural errors more easily.

A cell tracer is a blue arrow that shows the relationships between cells used
in formulas. You can trace two types of relationships:
✦Tracing precedents: Select a cell with a formula in it and trace the for-
mula’s precedents to find out which cells are computed to produce the
results of the formula. Trace precedents when you want to find out
where a formula gets its computation data. Cell tracer arrows point from
the referenced cells to the cell with the formula results in it.
To trace precedents, click the Trace Precedents button on the Formulas
tab (you may have to click the Formula Auditing button first, depending
on the size of your screen).
✦Tracing dependents: Select a cell and trace its dependents to find out
which cells contain formulas that use data from the cell you selected.
Cell tracer arrows point from the cell you selected to cells with formula
results in them. Trace dependents when you want to find out how the
data in a cell contributes to formulas elsewhere in the worksheet. The
cell you select can contain a constant value or a formula in its own right
(and contribute its results to another formula).
To trace dependents, click the Trace Dependents button on the
Formulas tab (you may have to click the Formula Auditing button first,
depending on the size of your screen).
To remove the cell tracer arrows from a worksheet, click the Remove Arrows
button. You can open the drop-down list on this button and choose Remove
Precedent Arrows or Remove Dependent Arrows to remove only cell-precedent
or cell-dependent tracer arrows.

Working with Functions
A function is a canned formula that comes with Excel. Excel offers hundreds
of functions, some of which are very obscure and fit only for use by rocket
scientists or securities analysts. Other functions are very practical. For
example, you can use the SUM function to quickly total the numbers in a
range of cells (earlier in this chapter, “Entering a cell range” describes cell
ranges). Instead of entering =C2+C3+C4+C5 on the Formula bar, you can
enter =SUM(C2:C5), which tells Excel to total the numbers in cell C2, C3, C4,
and C5. To obtain the product of the number in cell G4 and .06, you can use
the PRODUCT function and enter =PRODUCT(G4,.06) on the Formula bar.
Table 3-3 lists the most common functions. To get an idea of the numerous
functions that Excel offers, go to the Formulas tab and click the Insert Function
button. You see the Insert Function dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-12. (Later
in this chapter, I show you how you can use this dialog box to use functions in
formulas.) Choose a function category in the dialog box, choose a function
name, and read the description. You can click the Help on This Function link
to open the Excel Help window and get a thorough description of the function
and how it’s used.
Table 3-3
Common Functions and Their Use

Using arguments in functions
Every function takes one or more arguments — the cell references or
numbers, enclosed in parentheses, that the function acts upon. For example,
=AVERAGE(B1:B4) returns the average of the numbers in the cell range B1
through B4; =PRODUCT(6.5,C4) returns the product of multiplying the number
6.5 by the number in cell C4. When a function requires more than one argument,
enter a comma between the arguments (enter a comma without a space).
Entering a function in a formula
To enter a function in a formula, you can enter the function name by typing it
in the Formula bar, or you can rely on Excel to enter it for you. Enter function
names yourself if you’re well acquainted with a function and comfortable
using it.
No matter how you want to enter a function as part of a formula, start this way:
1. Select the cell where you want to enter the formula.
2. In the Formula bar, type an equals sign (=).
Please, please, please be sure to start every formula by entering an
equals sign (=). Without it, Excel thinks you’re entering text or a number
in the cell.
Choose a category.
Choose a function name.
Click to learn more.
Figure 3-12:
The Insert
Function
dialog box.

3. Start constructing your formula, and when you come to the place
where you want to enter the function, type the function’s name or call
upon Excel to help you enter the function and its arguments.
Later in this chapter, “Manually entering a function” shows you how to
type in the function yourself; “Getting Excel’s help to enter a function”
shows you how to get Excel to do the work.
If you enter the function on your own, it’s up to you to type the argu-
ments correctly; if you get Excel’s help, you also get help with entering
the cell references for the arguments.
Quickly entering a function and its arguments
To quickly total the numbers in cells,
click your worksheet where you want
the total to appear, and then click the AutoSum
button on the Home or Formulas tab. Excel
takes an educated guess as to which cells
need totaling, and the program highlights those
cells. If Excel guesses correctly and highlights
the cells you want to total, click the Enter
button and be done with it. Otherwise, select
the cells you want to add up and then press
Enter.
Similarly, you can use the drop-down list on the
AutoSum button to quickly obtain the average,
count of, minimum amount, or maximum amount
of cells by clicking in a nearby cell, opening the
drop-down list on the AutoSum button, and
choosing Average, Count Numbers, Max, or Min.

Functions for
Crunching Numbers
Working with Functions
507
Manually entering a function
Be sure to enclose the function’s argument or arguments in parentheses.
Don’t enter a space between the function’s name and the first parenthesis.
Likewise, don’t enter a comma and a space between arguments; enter a
comma, nothing more:
=SUM(F11,F14,23)
You can enter function names in lowercase. Excel converts function names
to uppercase after you click the Enter button or press Enter to complete the
formula. Entering function names in lowercase is recommended because
doing so gives you a chance to find out whether you entered a function name
correctly. If Excel doesn’t convert your function name to uppercase, you
made a typing error when you entered the function name.
Getting Excel’s help to enter a function
Besides entering a function by typing it, you can do it by way of the Function
Arguments dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-13. The beauty of using this
dialog box is that it warns you if you enter arguments incorrectly, and it
spares you the trouble of typing the function name without making an error.
What’s more, the Function Arguments dialog box shows you the results of
the formula as you construct it so that you get an idea whether you’re using
the function correctly.
Enter arguments.

Follow these steps to get Excel’s help with entering a function as part of a
formula:
1. On the Formulas tab, tell Excel which function you want to use.
You can do that with one of these techniques:
• Clicking a Function Library button: Click the button whose name
describes what kind of function you want and choose the function’s
name on the drop-down list. You can click the Financial, Logical,
Text, Date & Time, Lookup & Reference, Math & Trig, or More
Functions buttons.
• Clicking the Recently Used button: Click this button and choose the
name of a function you used recently.
• Clicking the Insert Function button: Clicking this button opens the
Insert Function dialog box (refer to Figure 3-12). Find and choose the
name of a function. You can search for functions or choose a cate-
gory and then scroll the names until you find the function you want.
You see the Function Arguments dialog box (refer to Figure 3-13). It
offers boxes for entering arguments for the function to compute.
2. Enter arguments in the spaces provided by the Function Arguments
dialog box.
To enter cell references or ranges, you can click or select cells in your
worksheet. If necessary, click the Range Selector button (you can find it
to the right of an argument text box) to shrink the Function Arguments
dialog box and get a better look at your worksheet.
3. Click OK when you finish entering arguments for your function.
I hope you didn’t have to argue too strenuously with the Function
Arguments dialog box.

T
his short and pithy chapter explains how to dress a worksheet in its
Sunday best in case you want to print and present it to others. It
explains how to align numbers and text, insert rows and columns, as well as
change the size of rows and columns. You find out how to decorate a work-
sheet with colors and borders, as well as create and apply styles to make
formatting tasks go more quickly. Finally, this chapter describes everything
you need to know before you print a worksheet, including how to make it fit
on one page and repeat row labels and column names on all pages.
Laying Out a Worksheet
Especially if you intend to print your worksheet, you may as well dress it in
its Sunday best. And you can do a number of things to make worksheets
easier to read and understand. You can change character fonts. You can
draw borders around or shade important cells. You can also format the
numbers so that readers know, for example, whether they’re staring at
dollar figures or percentages. This part of this chapter is dedicated to the
proposition that a worksheet doesn’t have to look drab and solemn.
Aligning numbers and text in columns and rows
To start with, numbers in worksheets are right-aligned in cells, and text is
left-aligned. Numbers and text sit squarely on the bottom of cells. You can,
however, change the way that data is aligned. For example, you can make
data float at the top of cells rather than rest at the bottom, and you can

Laying Out a Worksheet
510
center or justify data in cells. Figure 4-1 illustrates different ways to align text
and numbers. How text is aligned helps people make sense of your work-
sheets. In Figure 4-1, for example, Income and Expenses are left-aligned so
they stand out and make it clearer what the right-aligned column labels
below are all about.
Select the cells whose alignment needs changing and follow these instructions
to realign data in the cells:
✦Changing the horizontal (side-to-side) alignment: On the Home tab,
click the Align Text Left, Center, or Align Text Right button. You can
also click the Alignment group button, and on the Alignment tab of the
Format Cells dialog box, choose an option on the Horizontal drop-down
list. Figure 4-2 shows the Format Cells dialog box.
✦Changing the vertical (top-to-bottom) alignment: On the Home tab,
click the Top Align, Middle Align, or Bottom Align button. You can also
click the Alignment group button to open the Format Cells dialog box
(see Figure 4-2) and choose an option on the Vertical drop-down list.
The Justify Distributed option makes all the letters or numbers fit in a
cell, even if it means wrapping text to two or more lines.
✦Reorienting the cells: On the Home tab, click the Orientation button and
choose an option on the drop-down list. (For Figure 4-2, I chose the Angle
Counterclockwise option.) You can also click the Alignment group button,
and on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box (see Figure 4-2),
drag the diamond in the Orientation box or enter a number in the Degrees
text box.

Changing the orientation of text in cells is an elegant solution to the problem
of keeping a worksheet from getting too wide. Numbers are usually a few
characters wide, but heading labels can be much wider than that. By chang-
ing the orientation of a heading label, you make columns narrower and keep
worksheets from growing too fat to fit on the screen or page.
Inserting and deleting rows and columns
At some point, everybody has to insert new columns and rows and delete
ones that are no longer needed. Make sure before you delete a row or
column that you don’t delete data that you really need. Do the following to
insert and delete rows and columns:
✦Deleting rows or columns: Drag across the row numbers or column let-
ters of the rows or columns you want to delete; then right-click and
choose Delete or click the Delete button on the Home tab and select
Delete Sheet Rows or Delete Sheet Columns on the drop-down list.
✦Inserting rows: Select the row below the row you want to insert; then
click the Insert button and choose Insert Sheet Rows, or right-click the
row you selected and choose Insert on the shortcut menu. For example,
to insert a new row above row 11, select the current row 11 before
choosing Insert.
✦Inserting columns: Select the column to the right of where you want the
new column to be; then click the Insert button and choose Insert Sheet
Columns, or right-click the column you selected and choose Insert on
the shortcut menu.

A fast way to insert several rows or columns is to insert one and keep press-
ing F4 (the Repeat command) until you insert all the rows or columns you
need.
After you insert rows or columns, the Insert Options button appears. Click it
and choose an option from the drop-down list if you want your new row or
column to have the same or different formats as the row or column you
selected to start the Insert operation.
To insert more than one row or column at a time, select more than one row
number or column letter before giving the Insert command.
Changing the size of columns and rows
By default, columns are 8.43 characters wide. To make columns wider, you
have to widen them yourself. Rows are 12.75 points high, but Excel makes
them higher when you enter letters or numbers that are taller than 12.75
points (72 points equals one inch). Excel offers a bunch of different ways to
change the size of columns and rows. You can start on the Home tab and
choose options on the Format button drop-down list, as shown in Figure 4-3,
or you can rely on your wits and change sizes manually by dragging or
double-clicking the boundaries between row numbers or column letters.
Merging and centering text across several cells
In the illustration shown here, “Sales
Totals by Regional Office” is centered
across four different cells. Normally,
text is left-aligned, but if you want to center it
across several cells, drag across the cells to
select them and then click the Merge & Center
button on the Home tab. Merging and centering
allows you to display text across several columns.
To “unmerge and uncenter” cells, select the
text that you merged and centered, open the
drop-down list on the Merge & Center button,
and choose Unmerge Cells. You can also dese-
lect the Merge Cells check box in the Format
Cells dialog box (refer to Figure 4-2).

Book V
Chapter 4
Laying Out a Worksheet

Before you change the size of columns or rows, select them (Chapter 2 of
this mini-book explains how). Click or drag across row numbers to select
rows; click or drag across column letters to select columns.
Adjusting the height of rows
Here are ways to change the height of rows:
✦One at a time: Move the mouse pointer onto the boundary between row
numbers and, when the pointer changes to a cross, drag the boundary
between rows up or down. A pop-up box tells you how tall the row will
be after you release the mouse button.
✦Several at a time: Select several rows and drag the boundary between
one of the rows; all rows change height. You can also click the Format
button on the Home tab, choose Row Height, and enter a measurement
in the Row Height dialog box.
✦Tall as the tallest entry: To make a row as tall as its tallest cell entry,
double-click the border below a row number (after you’ve selected a
row), or click the Format button on the Home tab and choose AutoFit
Row Height.
Drag a boundary...

Adjusting the width of columns
Here are ways to make columns wider or narrower:
✦One at a time: Move the mouse pointer onto the boundary between
column letters, and when the pointer changes to a cross, drag the border
between the columns. A pop-up box tells you what size the column is.
✦Several at a time: Select several columns and drag the boundary between
one of the columns; all columns adjust to the same width. You can also
click the Format button on the Home tab, choose Column Width, and
enter a measurement in the Column Width dialog box.
✦As wide as their entries: To make columns as wide as their widest entries,
select the columns, click the Format button on the Home tab, and choose
AutoFit Column Width on the drop-down list. You can also double-click
the right border of a column letter. By “autofitting” columns, you can be
certain that the data in each cell in a column appears on-screen.
To change the 8.43-character standard width for columns in a worksheet,
click the Format button on the Home tab, choose Default Width on the drop-
down list, and enter a new measurement in the Standard Width dialog box.
Decorating a Worksheet with Borders and Colors
The job of gridlines is simply to help you line up numbers and letters in
cells. Gridlines aren’t printed when you print a worksheet, and because grid-
lines aren’t printed, drawing borders on worksheets is absolutely necessary
if you intend to print your worksheet. Use borders to steer the reader’s eye
to the most important parts of your worksheet — the totals, column labels,
and heading labels. You can also decorate worksheets with colors. This part
of the chapter explains how to put borders and colors on worksheets.
Cell styles for quickly formatting a worksheet
A style is a collection of formats — boldface text, a background color, or a
border around cells — that can be applied all at once to cells without having
to visit a bunch of different dialog boxes or give a bunch of different com-
mands. Styles save time. If you find yourself choosing the same formatting
commands time and time again, consider creating a style. That way, you can
apply all the formats simultaneously and go to lunch earlier. Excel comes with
many built-in styles, and you can create styles of your own, as the following
pages explain.
Applying a built-in cell style
By way of the Cell Styles gallery, you can choose from any number of attrac-
tive styles for cells in a worksheet. Excel offers styles for titles and headings,

Book V
Chapter 4
Decorating a Worksheet with Borders and Colors
515
styles for calling attention to what kind of data is in cells, and styles to
accent cells. Follow these steps to reformat cells by choosing a cell style:
1. Select the cells that need a new look.
2. On the Home tab, click the Cell Styles button.
As shown in Figure 4-4, the Cell Styles gallery opens. (Depending on the
size of your screen, you may have to click the Style button and then
click the More button to open the Cell Styles gallery.)
3. Select a cell style.
The Cell Styles gallery is divided into categories. Scroll through the cate-
gories until you find a style that suits your purposes.
To remove a style from cells, select the cells, open the Cell Styles gallery, and
choose Normal. (You find Normal in the “Good, Bad, and Neutral” category.)
Creating your own cell style
The names of cell styles you create on your own are placed at the top of the
Cell Styles gallery under the Custom heading. Create a cell style if you’re the
creative type or if no built-in style meets your high standards. Follow these
steps to create a cell style:
1. Apply the formatting commands you want for your style to a single cell.
For example, left-align cell data. Or apply a fill color to the cells (see
“Decorating worksheets with colors” later in this chapter). Or change
fonts and font sizes. Knock yourself out. Choose all the formatting com-
mands you want for your new style.

2. Click the Cell Styles button on the Home tab to open the Cell Styles
gallery.
Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Style
button and then click the More button first.
3. Choose New Cell Style at the bottom of the gallery.
You see the Style dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-5. It lists formatting
specifications you chose for the cell you selected in Step 1. If these spec-
ifications aren’t what you’re after, or if you want to change a specifica-
tion, you can click the Format button and describe your new style in the
Format Cells dialog box.
4. Enter a descriptive name for your style in the Style Name text box.
5. Click OK.
Next time you open the Cell Styles gallery, you see the name of your
style at the top under Custom.
To remove a style you created from the Cell Styles gallery, right-click its
name in the gallery and choose Delete on the shortcut menu.
Slapping borders on worksheet cells
Put borders on worksheet cells to box in cells, draw lines beneath cells, or
draw lines along the side of cells. Borders can direct people who review your

worksheet to its important parts. Typically, for example, a line appears
above the Totals row of a worksheet to separate the Totals row from the
rows above and help readers locate cumulative totals.
To draw borders on a worksheet, start by selecting the cells around which or
through which you want to place borders. Then do one of the following to
draw the borders:
✦Borders button: On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the
Borders button and choose a border, as shown in Figure 4-6.
✦Format Cells dialog box: As shown in Figure 4-7, the Border tab of the
Format Cells dialog box offers different lines for borders and colors for
borderlines as well. To open this dialog box, click the Format button on
the Home tab and choose Format Cells, or choose More Borders on the
Borders button drop-down list. Select a border style and either click in
the Border box to tell Excel where to draw the border or click a Preset
button.
To remove the border from cells, select the cells, open the drop-down list on
the Borders button, and choose No Border.

Getting Ready to Print a Worksheet
Printing a worksheet isn’t simply a matter of giving the Print command. A
worksheet is a vast piece of computerized sprawl. Most worksheets don’t fit
neatly on a single page. If you simply click the Print button to print your
worksheet, you wind up with page breaks in unexpected places, both on the
right side of the page and the bottom. Read on to discover how to set up a
worksheet so that the people you hand it to can read and understand it
easily.
Making a worksheet fit on a page
Unless you tell it otherwise, Excel prints everything from cell A1 to the last
cell with data in it in the southeast corner of the worksheet. Usually, it isn’t
necessary to print all those cells because some of them are blank. And print-
ing an entire worksheet often means breaking the page up in all kinds of awk-
ward places. To keep that from happening, here are some techniques for
making a worksheet fit tidily on one or two pages.
As you experiment with the techniques described here, switch occasionally
to Page Layout view. In this view, you get a better idea of what your work-
sheet will look like when you print it. To switch to Page Layout view, click
the Page Layout View button on the status bar or View tab.
Printing part of a worksheet
To print part of a worksheet, select the cells you want to print, go to the
Page Layout tab, click the Print Area button, and choose Set Print Area on
the drop-down list. This command tells Excel to print only the cells you
selected. On the worksheet, a dotted line appears around cells in the print
area. To remove the dotted lines from your worksheet, click the Print Area
button and choose Clear Print Area on the drop-down list.
Printing a landscape worksheet
If your worksheet is too wide to fit on one page, try turning the page on its
side and printing in landscape mode. In landscape mode, pages are wider
than they are tall. Landscape mode is often the easiest way to fit a worksheet
on a page.
To make yours a landscape worksheet instead of a portrait worksheet, go to
the Page Layout tab, click the Orientation button, and choose Landscape on
the drop-down list.

Seeing and adjusting the page breaks
Reading a worksheet is extremely difficult when it’s broken awkwardly
across pages. Where one page ends and the next begins is a page break. Use
these techniques to see where page breaks occur, adjust the position of page
breaks, and insert and remove page breaks:
✦Viewing where pages break occur: Click the Page Break Preview button
on the status bar or View tab. As shown in Figure 4-8, you switch to Page
Break Preview view. In this view, page numbers appear clearly on the
worksheet and dashed lines show you where Excel wants to break
the pages.
✦Adjusting page break positions: In Page Break Preview view, drag a
dashed line to adjust the position of a page break. After you drag a
dashed line, it ceases being a default page break and becomes a manual
page break. Manual page breaks are marked by solid lines, not dashed
lines (see Figure 4-8). You can drag them, too. Excel shrinks the numbers
and letters on your worksheet if you try to squeeze too much data on a
worksheet by dragging a page break.
Insert and remove page breaks.
Manual page break
Default page break; drag to change a page break position.
Figure 4-8:

521
✦Inserting a page break: Select the cell directly below where you want
the horizontal break to occur and directly to the right of where you want
the vertical break to be, click the Breaks button on the Page Layout tab,
and choose Insert Page Break (see Figure 4-8). Drag a page break to
adjust its position.
✦Removing a page break: Select a cell directly below or directly to the
right of the page break, click the Breaks button in the Page Layout tab,
and choose Remove Page Break (see Figure 4-8).
✦Removing all manual page breaks: To remove all manual page breaks
you inserted, go to the Page Layout tab, click the Breaks button, and
choose Reset All Page Breaks.
Switch to Page Layout or Normal view after you’re done fooling with page
breaks. You can clearly see page breaks in Page Layout view. In Normal view,
page breaks are marked by a dotted line. (If you don’t care to see these
dotted lines on your worksheet in Normal view, click the Office button,
choose Excel Options, click the Advanced category in the Excel Options
dialog box, and deselect the Show Page Breaks check box.)
“Scaling to fit” a worksheet
To scale the numbers and letters in a worksheet and make them a bit smaller
so they fit on a page, you can experiment with the Scale to Fit options. These
options are located on the Page Layout tab. Start in Page Layout view, go to
the Page Layout tab, and test-drive these options to make your worksheet fit
on a single page or a certain number of pages:
✦Scaling by width: Open the Width drop-down list and choose an option
to make your worksheet fit across one or more pages. Choose the 1 Page
option, for example, to squeeze a worksheet horizontally so it fits on one
page.
✦Scaling by height: Open the Height drop-down list and choose an option
to make your worksheet fit across on a select number of pages. For
example, choose the 2 Pages option to shrink a worksheet vertically so
it fits on two pages.
✦Scaling by percentage: Enter a percentage measurement in the Scale
box to shrink a worksheet vertically and horizontally. In order to scale
this way, you must choose Automatic in the Width and Height drop-
down lists.
You can also fit a worksheet on a select number of pages by going to the
Page Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-9. With this technique, you get a
chance to “print-preview” your worksheet and get a better look at it after
Making a Worksheet
Easier to Read and
Understand

Getting Ready to Print a Worksheet
522
you change the scale. On the Page Layout tab, click the Page Setup group
button to open the Page Setup dialog box. On the Page tab, select the Fit To
option button and enter the ideal number of pages you want for your work-
sheet in the Page(s) Wide By and Tall text boxes. Excel shrinks the data as
much as is necessary to make it fit on the number of pages you asked for.
Click the Print Preview button to look at the Print Preview screen and find
out whether shrinking your worksheet this way helps.
Adjusting the margins
Another way to stuff all the data onto one page is to narrow the margins a
bit. Go to the Page Layout tab and use either of these techniques to adjust
the size of the margins:
✦Click the Margins button and choose Narrow on the drop-down list.
✦Click the Page Setup group button, and on the Margins tab of the Page
Setup dialog box, change the size of the margins, as shown in Figure 4-9.
By clicking the Print Preview button, you can go to the Print Preview
screen and adjust margins there by dragging them. Select the Show
Margins check box to display the margins.

Making a worksheet more presentable
Before you print a worksheet, visit the Page Setup dialog box and see what
you can do to make your worksheet easier for others to read and under-
stand. To open the Page Setup dialog box, go to the Page Layout tab and
click the Page Setup group button or click the Page Setup button on the Print
Preview screen. Here are your options:
✦Including page numbers on worksheets: On the Page tab of the Page
Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 4-9), enter 1 in the First Page Number
text box. Then, on the Header/Footer tab, open the Header or Footer
drop-down list and choose an option that includes a page number.
Choosing the Page 1 of ? option, for example, enters the page number
and the total number of pages in the worksheet in your header or footer.
✦Putting headers and footers on pages: On the Header/Footer tab of the
Page Setup dialog box, choose options from the Header and Footer drop-
down lists. You’ll find options for listing the filename, page numbers, the
date, and your name. By clicking the Custom Header or Custom Footer
button, you can open the Header or Footer dialog box and construct a
header or footer there. Figure 4-10 shows the Header dialog box.
✦Centering worksheet data on the page: On the Margins tab, select
Horizontally or Vertically to center the worksheet relative to the top or
bottom or sides of the page. You can select both check boxes. The pre-
view screen shows what your choices mean in real terms.
✦Printing gridlines, column letters, and row numbers: By default, the
gridlines, column letters, and row numbers that you know and love in a
worksheet aren’t printed, but you can print them by selecting the
Gridlines check box as well as the Row and Column Headings check box
in the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box.

Repeating row and column headings on each page
If your worksheet is a big one that stretches beyond one page, you owe it to
the people who view your worksheet to repeat row and column headings
from page to page. Without these headings, no one can tell what the data in
the worksheet means. Follow these steps to repeat row and column headings
from page to page:
1. On the Page Layout tab, click the Print Titles button.
You see the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box.
2. Select the Row and Column Headings check box.
You can find this check box under Print.
3. To repeat rows, click the Range Selector button next to the Rows to
Repeat at Top text box; to repeat columns, click the Range Selector
button next to the Columns to Repeat at Left text box.
These buttons are located on the right side of the dialog box. The dialog
box shrinks so that you can get a better look at your worksheet.
4. Click the row or column with the labels or names you need.
As long as they’re next to each other, you can select more than one row
or column by dragging over the row numbers or column letters.
5. Click the Range Selector button to enlarge the dialog box and see it
again.
The text box now lists a cell range address.
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 to select column or row headings.
7. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
If I were you, I would click the Print Preview button in the Page Setup
dialog box first to make sure that row and column headings are indeed
repeating from page to page.
To remove row and column headings, return to the Sheet tab of the Page
Setup dialog box and delete the cell references in the Rows to Repeat at Top
text box and the Columns to Repeat at Left text box. You can also press
Ctrl+F3 and delete Print_Titles in the Name Manager dialog box.

his chapter offers a handful of tricks for analyzing the data that you so
carefully and lovingly enter in a worksheet. Delve into this chapter to
find out how to manage, sort, and filter worksheet lists. You also discover
how the Goal Seek command can help you target values in different kinds of
analysis, and how you can map out different scenarios with data by using
one- and two-input data tables.
Managing Information in Lists
Although Excel is a spreadsheet program, many people use it to keep and
maintain lists — address lists, product lists, employee lists, and inventory
lists, among other types of lists. These pages deal with all the different
things you can do with a worksheet list. They explain the difference
between a conventional worksheet and a list, constructing a list, sorting a
list, and filtering a list.
Constructing a list
To sort and filter data in a worksheet, your worksheet must be constructed
like a list. Make sure that your worksheet has these characteristics:
✦Column labels: Enter column labels along the top row, as shown in
Figure 5-1. Excel needs these labels to identify and be able to filter the
data in the rows below. Each label must have a different name. The row
along the top of the worksheet where the column labels are is called
the header row.
✦No empty rows or columns: Sorry, but you can’t put an empty row or
column in the middle of the worksheet list.

Managing Information in Lists
526
✦No blank columns on the left: Don’t allow any empty columns to appear
to the left of the list.
✦A single worksheet: The list must occupy a single worksheet. You can’t
keep more than one list on the same worksheet.
If you know anything about databases, the rules for constructing a work-
sheet list no doubt sound familiar. These are the same rules that apply to
constructing a database table. You might consider managing your list as a
database if it’s a long and complex one. Book VI explains how to use Access,
the database program in Office 2007.
Sorting a list
Sorting means to rearrange the rows in a list on the basis of data in one or
more columns. Sort a list on the Last Name column, for example, to arrange
the list in alphabetical order by last name. Sort a list on the ZIP Code column
to arrange the rows in numerical order by ZIP code. Sort a list on the
Birthday column to arrange it chronologically from earliest born to latest
born. Here are all the ways to sort a list:
✦Sorting on a single column: On the Home tab, click any cell in the
column you want to use as the basis for the sort, and then click the Sort
Smallest to Largest or Sort Largest to Smallest button on the Data tab or
the Home tab (you may have to click the Sort & Filter button first,
depending on the size of your screen). For example, to sort item num-
bers from smallest to largest, click in the Item Number column and then
click the Sort Smallest to Largest button.
Figure 5-1:

sheet as 
a list.

Book V
Chapter 5
Analyzing Data
Managing Information in Lists
527
✦Sort on more than one column: Click the Sort button (you can find it on
the Data and Home tab, although you may have to click the Sort & Filter
button on the Home tab to find it, depending on the size of your screen.
You see the Sort dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-2. Choose which columns
you want to sort with and the order in which you want to sort. To add a
second or third column for sorting, click the Add Level button.
Be careful about sorting rows with formula results. Sorting discombobulates
the rows. If a formula refers to a cell that isn’t in the same row and you give a
sort command, you get a #VALUE! error because the formula won’t compute
using the correct cell address.
Filtering a list
Filtering means to scour a worksheet list for certain kinds of data. To filter,
you tell Excel what kind of data you’re looking for, and the program assem-
bles rows with that data to the exclusion of rows that don’t have the data.
You end up with a shorter list with only the rows that match your filter crite-
ria. Filtering is similar to using the Find command except that you get more
than one row in the results of the filtering operation. For example, in a list of
addresses, you can filter for only addresses in California. In a price list, you
can filter for items that fall within a certain price range.
To filter a list, start by clicking the Filter button on the Data tab. As shown in
Figure 5-3, a drop-down list appears beside each column header.
Your next task is to open a drop-down list in the column that holds the crite-
ria you want to use to filter the list. For example, if you want to filter the list
to items that cost more than $100, open the Cost column drop-down list; if
you want to filter the list so that only the names of employees who make less
than $30,000 annually appears, open the Salary drop-down list.
Figure 5-2:
Sort to
arrange the
list data in
different
ways.

Managing Information in Lists
528
After you open the correct column drop-down list, tell Excel how you want
to filter the list:
✦Filter by exclusion: On the drop-down list, deselect the Select All check
box and then select the check box next to each item you don’t want to
filter out. For example, to filter an Address list to addresses in Boston,
Chicago, and Miami, deselect the Select All check box and then select
the check boxes next to Boston, Chicago, and Miami on the drop-down
list. Your filter operation turns up only addresses in these three cities.
✦Filter with criteria: On the drop-down list, choose Number Filters, and
then choose a filter operation on the submenu (or simply choose
Custom Filter). You see the Custom AutoFilter dialog box.
Choose an operator (equals, is greater than, or another) from the drop-
down list, and either enter or choose a target criterion from the list on
the right side of the dialog box. You can search by more than one crite-
rion. Select the And option button if a row must meet both criteria to be
selected, or select the Or option button if a row can meet either crite-
rion to be selected.
Click the Filter button.

Click the OK button on the column’s drop-down list or the Custom AutoFilter
dialog box to filter your list.
To see all the data in the list again — to unfilter the list — click the Clear
button on the Data tab.
Forecasting with the Goal Seek Command
In a conventional formula, you provide the raw data, and Excel produces the
results. With the Goal Seek command, you declare what you want the results
to be, and Excel tells you the raw data you need to produce those results.
The Goal Seek command is especially useful in financial analyses when you
want the outcome to be a certain way and you need to know which raw num-
bers will produce the outcome that you want.
Figure 5-4 shows a worksheet designed to find out the monthly payment
on a mortgage. With the PMT function, the worksheet determines that the
monthly payment on a $250,000 loan with an interest rate of 6.5 percent and
to be paid over a 30-year period is $1,580.17. Suppose, however, that the
person who calculated this monthly payment determined that he or she
could pay more than $1,580.17 per month? Suppose the person could pay
$1,750 or $2,000 per month. Instead of an outcome of $1,580.17, the person
wants to know how much he or she could borrow if monthly payments —
the outcome of the formula — were increased to $1,750 or $2,000.
Figure 5-4:
Experiment-
ing with the
Goal Seek
command.

Performing What-If Analyses with Data Tables
530
To make determinations such as these, you can use the Goal Seek command.
This command lets you experiment with the arguments in a formula to
achieve the results you want. In the case of the worksheet in Figure 5-4, you
can use the Goal Seek command to change the argument in cell C3, the total
amount you can borrow, given the outcome you want in cell C6, $1,750 or
$2,000, the monthly payment on the total amount.
Follow these steps to use the Goal Seek command to change the inputs in a
formula to achieve the results you want:
1. Select the cell with the formula whose arguments you want to experi-
ment with.
2. On the Data tab, click the What-If Analysis button and choose Goal
Seek on the drop-down list.
You see the Goal Seek dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-4. The address of
the cell you selected in Step 1 appears in the Set Cell box.
3. In the To Value text box, enter the target results you want from the
formula.
In the example in Figure 5-4, you enter 1750 or 2000, the monthly pay-
ment you can afford for the 30-year mortgage.
4. In the By Changing Cell text box, enter the address of the cell whose
value is unknown.
To enter a cell address, select a cell on your worksheet. In Figure 5-4,
you select the address of the cell that shows the total amount you want
to borrow.
5. Click OK.
The Goal Seek Status dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-4. It lists
the target value that you entered in Step 3.
6. Click OK.
On your worksheet, the cell with the argument you wanted to alter now
shows the target you’re seeking. In the case of the example worksheet in
Figure 5-4, you can borrow $316,422, not $250,000, by raising your
monthly mortgage payments from $1,580.17 to $2,000.
Performing What-If Analyses with Data Tables
For something a little more sophisticated than the Goal Seek command
(which I describe in the preceding section), try performing what-if analyses
with data tables. With this technique, you change the data in input cells and
observe what effect changing the data has on the results of a formula. The

Book V
Chapter 5

Performing What-If Analyses with Data Tables
531
difference between the Goal Seek command and a data table is that, with a
data table, you can experiment simultaneously with many different input
cells and in so doing experiment with many different scenarios.
Using a one-input table for analysis
In a one-input table, you find out what the different results of a formula would
be if you change one input cell in the formula. In Figure 5-5, that input cell is
the interest rate on a loan. The purpose of this data table is to find out how
monthly payments on a $250,000, 30-year mortgage are different, given differ-
ent interest rates. The interest rate in cell B4 is the input cell.
Follow these steps to create a one-input table:
1. On your worksheet, enter values that you want to substitute for the
value in the input cell.
To make the input table work, you have to enter the substitute values in
the right location:
• In a column: Enter the values in the column starting one cell below
and one cell to the left of the cell where the formula is located (refer
to Figure 5-5).
• In a row: Enter the values in the row starting one cell above and one
cell to the right of the cell where the formula is.

2. Select the block of cells with the formula and substitute values.
Select a rectangle of cells that encompasses the formula cell, the cell
beside it, all the substitute values, and the empty cells where the new
calculations will soon appear. In the case of a column, you select the for-
mula cell, the cell to its left, as well as all the substitute-value cells and
the cells below the formula cell. In the case of a row, select the formula
cell, the cell above it, as well as the substitute values in the cells directly
to the right and the now-empty cells where the new calculations will
appear.
3. On the Data tab, click the What-If Analysis button and choose Data
Table on the drop-down list.
You see the Data Table dialog box.
4. In the Row Input Cell or Column Input Cell text box, enter the address
of the cell where the input value is located.
The input value is the value you’re experimenting with in your analysis.
In the case of Figure 5-5, the input value is located in cell B4, the cell that
holds the interest rate.
If the new calculations appear in rows, enter the address of the input cell
in the Row Input Cell text box; if the calculations appear in columns (as
shown in Figure 5-5), enter the input cell address in the Column Input
Cell text box.
5. Click OK.
Excel performs the calculations and fills in the table.
To generate the one-input table, Excel constructs an array formula with 
the TABLE function. If you change the cell references in the first row or plug
in different values in the first column, Excel updates the one-input table
automatically.
Using a two-input table for analysis
In a two-input table, you can experiment with two input cells rather than
one. Getting back to the example of the loan payment in Figure 5-5, you can
calculate not only how loan payments change as interest rates change, but
how payments change if the life of the loan changes. Figure 5-6 shows a two-
input table for examining monthly loan payments given different interest
rates and two different terms for the loan, 15 years (180 months) and 30
years (360 months).

Book V
Chapter 5
Analyzing Data
Performing What-If Analyses with Data Tables
533
Follow these steps to create a two-input data table:
1. Enter one set of substitute values below the formula in the same
column as the formula.
In Figure 5-6, different interest rates are entered from cell D5 to D15.
2. Enter the second set of substitute values in the row to the right of the
formula.
In Figure 5-6, 180 and 360 are entered. These numbers represent the
number of months of the life of the loan.
3. Select the formula and all substitute values.
Do this correctly and you select three columns, including the formula,
the substitute values below it, and the two columns to the right of
the formula. You select a big block of cells (the range D4:F15, in this
example).
4. On the Data tab, click the What-If Analysis button and choose Data
Table on the drop-down list.
The Data Table dialog box appears (see Figure 5-6).

534
5. In the Row Input Cell text box, enter the address of the cell referred
to in the original formula where substitute values to the right of the
formula can be plugged in.
In Figure 5-6, for example, the rows to the right of the formula are for
length of loan substitute values. Therefore, I select cell B5, the cell
referred to in the original formula where the length of the loan is listed.
6. In the Column Input Cell text box, enter the address of the cell
referred to in the original formula where substitute values below the
formula are.
In Figure 5-6, the substitute values below the formula cell are interest
rates. Therefore, I select cell B4, the cell referred to in the original for-
mula where the interest rate is entered.
7. Click OK.
Excel performs the calculations and fills in the table.

T
he word database is prone to making most people feel kind of queasy.
Can you blame them? Database terminology — record, field, and filter —
is the worst of the worst. It even puts other computer terminology to
shame. Databases intimidate most people. Even brave souls with a consider-
able amount of experience in Word and Excel shy away from Access, the
Office 2007 database program. However, Access can be invaluable for stor-
ing and organizing customer lists, inventories, addresses, payment histories,
donor lists, and volunteer lists. What’s more, Access is easy to use, after you
get the hang of it. No kidding!
This chapter starts you down the road to the Land of Oz. In truth, it intro-
duces databases and the concepts behind databases. It shows you how to
create a database and database tables for storing information. The second
half of this chapter explains how to design databases. Sorry, but you have to
know about database design before you can start fooling with databases.
You can’t jump right in as you can with the other Office programs.
Access offers a practice database that you can experiment with as you get
to know your way around databases. To open this database, start Access
and then select Sample from the From Microsoft Office Online category on
the left side of the Getting Started with Microsoft Office Access window.
Choose Northwind 2007 from the sample templates, click Download at the
right-side of the window to get the sample template from Microsoft Office
Online (www.office.microsoft.com), and open it on your computer.
What Is a Database, Anyway?
Whether you know it or not, you’re no stranger to databases. The address
book on your computer is a database. The telephone directory in the desk
drawer is, too. A recipe book is also a database in that recipes are categorized
under different headings. If you ever arranged a CD collection in a certain

Tables, Queries, Forms, and Other Objects
538
way — in alphabetical order or by musical genre, for example — you created
a database of CDs, one that makes finding a particular CD easier. Any place
where information is stored in a systematic way can be considered a database.
The only difference between a computerized database and a conventional
database, such as a telephone directory, is that storing, finding, and manipu-
lating data is much easier in a computerized database.
Imagine how long it would take to find all the New York addresses in an
address list with 10,000 entries. In Access, you can query a 10,000-entry data-
base and find all New York addresses in a matter of seconds. For that matter,
you can query to find all the addresses in a certain ZIP code. You can put the
list in alphabetical order by last name or in numerical order by ZIP code.
Doing these chores without a computer requires many hours of dreary,
monotonous labor.
Tables, Queries, Forms, and Other Objects
One problem with getting to know a database program — and the primary
reason that people are intimidated by databases — is that you can’t jump
right in. You have to know how data is stored in a database and how it is
extracted, to use programmer terminology. You have to know about objects,
Access’s bland word for database tables, queries, forms, and all else that
makes a database a database. To help you get going, these pages offer a
crash course in databases. They explain the different objects — tables,
queries, forms, and reports — that make up a database. Fasten your seat-
belt. If you complete the crash course without crashing, you’re ready to
create your first database.
Database tables for storing information
Information in databases is stored in database tables like the one in Figure 1-1.
In a database table, you include one field for each category of information
you want to keep on hand. Fields are the equivalent of columns in a table.
Your first duty when you create a database table is to name the fields and
tell Access what kind of information you propose to store in each field. The
database table in Figure 1-1 is for storing employee information. It has six
fields: ID, Company, First Name, Last Name, E-mail Address, and Job Title.
A database can comprise one database table or many different tables that
are linked together. If you’re dealing with a lot of information, storing data in
more than one table is to your advantage. Later in this chapter, “Separating
information into different database tables” explains why storing data across
several database tables is advantageous.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Introducing Access
Tables, Queries, Forms, and Other Objects
539
Forms for entering data
After you create the fields in the database table, you can start entering the
records. A record describes all the data concerning one person or thing. In
Figure 1-1, nine records are entered in the database table. Each record com-
prises a person’s ID, company, first name, last name, e-mail address, and job
title. Records are the meat of the database. Information is stored in records.
Although you can enter records straight into a database table, the easiest
way to enter a record is with a form. Similar to a dialog box, a form has con-
venient text boxes and drop-down lists for entering information. Figure 1-2
shows the form for entering a record in the database table shown in Figure 1-1.
Notice that the form has one place for entering data in each field in the data-
base table — First Name, Last Name, and so on. On a form, you can see
clearly what kind of information needs entering in each field.

Access database terminology
Stumbling over database terminology is easy.
To keep yourself from stumbling, fold back the
corner of this page and return here if one of
these database terms puzzles you:
 Cell: In a database table, a place for enter-
ing one piece of data. Cells appear in a
database table where a field and record
intersect.
 Database: A systematic way of organizing
information so that it can be retrieved and
manipulated easily.
 Database table: A collection of data records
arranged into well-defined categories, or
fields. Most databases have more than one
table.
 Dynaset: The results of a search for data in
a database. (This term is short for dynamic
set.) A dynaset is not to be confused with a
dinosaur.
 Field: One category of information in a
database table. Fields are the equivalent of
columns in a conventional table.
 Filtering: Finding the records in a database
table that have the same or nearly the
same field value. Filtering is a more con-
venient but not as sophisticated means of
querying a database.
 Foreign field: In a relationship between two
database tables, the field that is on the
“many” side of a one-to-many relationship.
The primary key field is on the “one” side.
 Form: Similar to a dialog box, a place with
text boxes and drop-down lists for entering
records in a database table.
 Module: A Visual Basic procedure whose
job is to perform a certain task in Access.
 Object: The catch-all term for the tables,
queries, forms, and reports that you create
and open starting in the Navigation pane.
 Primary key field: The field in a database
table where unique, one-of-a-kind data is
stored. To query more than one database
table at a time, the tables must have pri-
mary key fields.
 Query: A question asked of a database that
yields information. Queries can be made of
a single database table, several tables, or
even other queries.
 Record: In a database table, all the data
that’s recorded about one person or thing.
A record is the equivalent of a row in a con-
ventional table.
 Relational database: A database program
in which data is kept in more than one data-
base table, relationships are established
between tables, and queries can be con-
ducted and reports made by assembling
data from different tables. Access is a rela-
tional database. A database that permits
only one table is a flat-file database.
 Report: Information gathered from a data-
base and laid out in such a way that it’s
easy to read and understand. Reports are
meant to be printed and distributed.
 Sort: To rearrange records in a database
table so that the records appear in alpha-
betical, numerical, or date order in one
field.

Queries for getting the data out
Figure 1-3 shows a simple query for finding out which employees in the 
database table shown in Figure 1-1 are Sales Representatives. A query is a
question you ask of a database. The question here is, “Who is a Sales
Representative?” Notice the criterion “Sales Representative” in the Job Title
field on the Query grid.
In an address database, you can use a query to find all the people in a partic-
ular ZIP code or state. If information about contributions is stored in the data-
base, you can find out who contributed more than $500 last year. Queries can
get very complex. For example, you could find all the people in a particular
city who contributed between $50 and $500 and volunteered more than eight
hours in the past year. You can construct the query so that it produces each
person’s name and telephone number, or you can construct it so that all the
information you have concerning each person appears in the query results.
When you get junk mail, it likely comes to your mailbox as the result of a
database query. Companies routinely buy and sell customer databases. They
query these databases to gather the names of people who they believe are
well-disposed to purchasing the products they sell. Next time you get junk
mail solicitation, study the letter and ask yourself, “How did I get in this
database, and which database query produced my name?” The junk mailer
is probably targeting extraordinarily beautiful, intelligent people.

Creating a Database File
542
After you create a query, you can save it and run it again. You can use it as
the basis for constructing new queries. The information in database tables
usually changes over time. Customers change addresses. New products
come online, and others are discontinued. But no matter how much the data
changes, you can find out exactly what you want to know from a database by
running a well-crafted query.
Reports for presenting and examining data
Figure 1-4 shows a report. Reports can be made from database tables or from
the results of queries. Reports are usually read by managers and others who
don’t get their hands dirty in databases. They’re meant to be printed and
distributed so that the information can be scrutinized and analyzed. Access
offers many attractive reports. Don’t worry — the program does most of the
layout work for you, and exporting reports to a Word file is easy.
Macros and modules
Macros and modules aren’t covered in this mini-book, but they are also data-
base objects. A macro is a series of commands. You can store macros for
running queries and doing other Access tasks. (Book VIII, Chapter 7 explains
macros.) A module is a collection of Visual Basic procedures and declara-
tions for performing tasks in Access.
Creating a Database File
Creating a database is a lot of work, at least in the beginning. You have to
design the database (a subject that I explain shortly). You have to enter the
raw information into the table. You have to construct queries that allow
Figure 1-4:

for scrutiny
and
analysis.

Book VI

yourself and others to read meaning into the data (see Chapter 4 of this
mini-book). By contrast, creating a database file for storing the information
is the easy part.
Access offers two ways to create a new database file. You can do it from
scratch or get the help of a template. With a template, some of the work’s
done already for you. The template comes with prefabricated queries, forms,
and reports. However, templates are for people who already know their way
around Access databases. To make use of a template, you have to know how
to modify a pre-existing database.
Before you create a database file, start by deciding where in your computer
to store it. Unlike other Office programs, Access requires you to save and
name a new file as soon as you create it.
Creating a blank database file
Follow these instructions to create a blank database file:
1. Start Access (if you’re not already running it), click the Office button,
and choose New.
The Getting Started with Microsoft Office Access screen appears.
2. Click the Blank Database link in the New Blank Database section in
the middle pane.
3. In the Blank Database section on the right of the Access window, click
the folder icon to open the File New Database dialog box and select
the drive and folder where you want to keep the database file, enter a
name in the File Name text box, and click OK to close the dialog box.
4. Click the Create button.
The Navigation pane and a blank table appear. Later in this chapter,
“Finding Your Way around the Navigation Pane” explains what this pane
is all about. I suggest you go there without delay or deferral.
Getting the help of a template
As I explain earlier, templates are wonderful if you have the wherewithal to
modify them. Access offers prefabricated databases for tracking assets,
keeping inventory, scheduling resources, and doing other things.
Unfortunately, the only way to find out whether one of the templates is
worthwhile is to go to the trouble to create a database from a template, open
up the database file, and look around.

Finding Your Way around the Navigation Pane
544
Follow these steps to create a database file from a template:
1. Start Access or click the Office button and then choose New.
The Getting Started with Microsoft Office Access screen appears.
2. Click one of the Template Categories on the top left of the Access
window or click a category under the From Microsoft Office Online.
The available templates appear in the middle of the window. You can
find databases for tracking tasks, sales, projects, assets, and other data.
3. Select a template.
The template name appears in the right section of the Access window,
along with a rating and a filename.
4. In the section on the right of the Access window (under the name
of the chosen template), click the folder icon to open the File New
Database dialog box and select the drive and folder where you want
to keep the database file, enter a name in the File Name text box, and
click OK to close the dialog box.
5. Click the Download button.
Access downloads the template, creates a database file on your com-
puter, and opens the file.
Finding Your Way around the Navigation Pane
The first thing you see when you open most database files is a Navigation
pane like the one in Figure 1-5. This is the starting point for doing all your
work in Access. From here, you can select an object — that horrible word
again! — and begin working. You also add objects to the Navigation pane
using the Create tab.
Here are shorthand instructions for doing this, that, and the other thing in
the Navigation pane:
✦Choosing an object type: Select a group (Tables, Queries, Forms,
Reports, and so on) from the Object Type drop-down list at the top of
the Navigation pane, or select All Access Objects to see all the groups,
as shown in Figure 1-5.
✦Creating a new object: Click the Create tab and then choose what type
of object you want to create. When creating new forms and reports, click
a table or query in the Navigation pane to base the new form or report
on that table or query. You create different types of objects throughout
this mini-book.

Book VI

545
✦Opening an object: To open a database table, query, form, or report,
double-click it, select it and then press Enter, or right-click it and then
choose Open from the shortcut menu.
✦Opening an object in Design view: The task of formulating database
tables, forms, and queries is done in Design view. If an object needs
reformulating, right-click it and then choose Design View on the shortcut
menu.
✦Finding objects: Use the Search bar to display objects that contain the
phrase in the name. Figure 1-5 shows the objects that contain the word
Customer.
✦Manipulating the Navigation pane: Click the Shutter Bar Open/Close
button on the upper-right corner of the Navigation pane when you want
to shrink it and get it out of the way. You can also resize this pane by
clicking the far right edge and dragging it left or right.
No matter how cluttered the Access window gets with database tables,
queries, and forms, you can quickly show the Navigation pane with these
techniques:
✦Click the Shutter Bar Open/Close button on the collapsed Navigation pane.
✦Press F11.

Designing a Database
Being a database designer isn’t nearly as glamorous as being a fashion
designer, but it has its rewards. If you design your database carefully and
correctly, it can be very useful to you and others. You can enter information
accurately. When the time comes to draw information from the database,
you get precisely the information you need. These pages explain everything
you need to consider when designing a database. Pay close attention to
“Separating information into different database tables” because the hardest
part about designing a database is deciding how to distribute information
across database tables and how many database tables to have.
Access file formats
Not surprisingly, the default file format for data-
base files you create with Access 2007 is
Access 2007 and has an .accdb extension. If
you work on your own or work with people who
have the latest version of Access, you needn’t
worry about your Access files being compati-
ble with older versions of the program.
Access 2007 also supports older file formats:
Access 2000, Access 2002, and Access 2003,
which have an .mdb extension. To use data-
bases in these formats, simply open them in
Access 2007. You can use some of the new fea-
tures of Access 2007 while maintaining com-
patibility with your behind-the-times co-workers
that still have the older version. You can even
create new databases in the older format if
these co-workers refuse to upgrade. Some
people can be so stubborn!
Use one of the following methods to save your
files in the latest version of Access:
 Converting an older database version to
Access 2007: Open the older file in Access
2007, click the Office button, and choose
Convert. The Convert Database Into dialog
box appears. Select a folder and name for
the database file and then click the Save
button.
 Converting an Access 2007 file to an older
version: Open the newer file in Access
2007, click the Office button, and choose
Save As➪Access 2002-2003 or Access
2000 File Format. The Convert Database
Into dialog box appears. Select a folder and
name for the database file and then click
the Save button.
 Saving all files by default in a different ver-
sion: Click the Office button, choose Access
Options, select Personalize on the left pane,
and choose the Default file format from the
drop-down list. Select from Access 2007,
Access 2002-2003, or Access 2000.
Warning: After you use some features of an
Access 2007 database, you can’t convert it
back into an older format. These features
include attachments, multi-value lookup fields,
and offline data.

Deciding what information you need
The first question to ask yourself is about the kind of information you want
to get out of the database. Customer names and addresses? Sales informa-
tion? Information for inventory tracking? Interview your co-workers to find
out what information could be helpful to them. Give this matter some serious
thought. Your goal is to set up the database so that every tidbit of information
your organization needs can be recorded there.
A good way to find out what kind of information matters to an organization is
to examine the paper forms that the organization uses to solicit or record
information. These forms show precisely what the organization deems
worthy of tracking in a database. Figure 1-6, for example, shows the paper
form that players fill out to sign up for the little league whose database
tables appear in Figure 1-7. Compare Figure 1-6 with Figure 1-7, and you can
see that the Players, Teams, and Divisions database tables all have fields for
entering information from this form.

Plans for

tables and
field names.
Figure 1-6:

Separating information into 
different database tables
After you know the information you want to record in the database, think
about how to separate the information into database tables. Many are tempted
to put all the information into a single database table, but Access is a relational
database, you can query more than one table at a time, and in so doing, assem-
ble information from different tables.
Keeping object shortcuts in groups
In a database with many tables, queries, and
reports, finding the one you want to work on
can be a chore. To help you find objects,
Access gives you the opportunity to create
custom groups. After you create a group, its
name appears in the Navigation pane, and the
object you add to that group appears under-
neath the group’s heading. Actually, only short-
cuts to the objects appear in a custom group.
Then, to open an object, all you have to do is
double-click its shortcut.
To create custom groups, right-click the white
space at the bottom of the Navigation pane and
then choose Navigation Options from the drop-
down list. The Navigation Options dialog box
displays. Follow these instructions to set up
your custom groups:
 Creating a new category: Click the Add Item
button to create a new category. You see the
new category appear, where you can type a
name and press Enter. For example, you may
want a category for Customers, Employees,
or the Management team to keep them out
of the important stuff. The Object Type cate-
gory is the default and contains Tables,
Queries, Forms, and so on.
 Creating a new group: Click the category to
which you want to add the group and then
click the Add Group button. You see the new
group appear, where you can type a name
and press Enter. These groups appear in the
Navigation pane after you select a Category
from the Object Type drop-down list.
 Putting a shortcut in a group: At first, all the
objects are in the Unassigned Objects
group. To add them to your new group, close
the Navigation Options dialog box, right-
click the object, choose Add to Group, and
choose the group’s name in the submenu.
 Opening a group: Choose a category from
the Object Type drop-down list and then
expand the desired group name to display
the objects you add to the group.
 Removing a shortcut from a custom group:
Select the object, press the Delete button or
right-click the object and then choose
Remove from the drop-down list. The object
returns to the Unassigned Objects group. If
you’re viewing actual objects — not short-
cuts — you get a message asking if you
want to permanently delete the object.
Make sure you don’t accidentally delete the
real object instead of the shortcut.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Introducing Access
Designing a Database
549
To see how it works, consider the simple database, as shown in Figure 1-7.
The purpose of this little database and its four tables is to store information
about the players, coaches, and teams in a little league. The Team Name field
appears in three tables. It serves as the link between the tables and permits
more than one to be queried. By querying individual tables or combinations
of tables in this database, I can assemble team rosters, make a list of coaches
and their contact information, list teams by division, put together a mailing
list of all players, find out which players have paid their fee, and list players
by age group, among other things. This database comprises four tables:
✦Players: Includes fields for tracking players’ names, addresses, birth-
days, which teams they’re on, and whether they paid their fees
✦Coaches: Includes fields for tracking coaches’ names, addresses, and the
names of the teams they coach
✦Teams: Includes fields for tracking team names and which division each
team is in
✦Divisions: Includes fields for tracking division numbers and names
Deciding how many database tables you need and how to separate data
across the different tables is the hardest part of designing a database. To
make the task a little easier, do it the old-fashioned way with a pencil and
eraser. Here are the basic rules for separating data into different tables:
✦Restrict a table to one subject only: Each database table should hold
information about one subject only — customers, employees, products,
and so on. This way, you can maintain data in one table independently
from data in another table. Consider what would happen in the little
league database (refer to Figure 1-7) if coach and team data were kept in
a single table, and one team’s coach was replaced by someone new. You
would have to delete the old coach’s record, delete information about
the team, enter information about the new coach, and re-enter information
about the team that you just deleted. But by keeping team information
separate from coach information, you can update coach information and
still maintain the team information.
✦Avoid duplicate information: Try not to keep duplicate information in
the same database table or duplicate information across different tables.
By keeping the information in one place, you have to enter it only once,
and if you have to update it, you can do so in one database table, not
several.
Deciding how many tables to include in a database and how the tables relate
to one another is probably the hardest task you undertake in Access. Entire
books are written about database design, and this book can’t do the subject

Designing a Database
550
justice. You can, however, store all your data in a single table if the data you
want to store isn’t very complex. The time you lose entering all the data in a
single table is made up by the time you save not having to design a complex
database with more than one table.
Choosing fields for database tables
As I explain earlier, fields are categories of information. Each database table
needs at least one field. If the table itself is a subject, you could say that its
fields are facts about the subject. An Address database table needs fields for
recording street addresses, cities, states, and ZIP codes. A Products data-
base table needs fields for product ID numbers, product names, and unit
prices. Just the facts, ma’am. Within the confines of the subject, the data-
base table needs one field for each piece of information that is useful to your
organization.
When you’re planning which fields to include in your database tables, follow
these guidelines:
✦Break up the information into small elements. For example, instead of a
Name field, create a First Name field and a Last Name field. This way, you
can sort database tables by last name more easily.
✦Give descriptive names to fields so that you know what they are later.
A more descriptive name, such as Serial Number, is clearer than SN.
✦Think ahead and include a field for each piece of information your organi-
zation needs. Adding a field to a database table late in the game is a chore.
You have to return to each record, look up the information, and enter it.
✦Don’t include information that can be derived from a calculation. As I
explain in Chapter 4 of this mini-book, calculations can be performed as
part of a query. For example, you can total the numbers in two fields in
the same record or perform mathematical calculations on values in
fields.
Deciding on a primary key field
for each database table
Each database table must have a primary key field. This field, also known as
the primary key, is the field in the database table where unique, one-of-a-kind
data is stored. Data entered in this field — an employee ID number, a part
number, a bid number — must be different in each record. If you try to enter
the same data in the primary key field of two different records, a dialog box
warns you not to do that. Primary key fields prevent you from entering dupli-
cate records. They also make queries more efficient. In a query, you tell
Access what to look for in database tables, Access searches through the

Book VI
Chapter 1
Introducing Access
Designing a Database
551
tables, and the program assembles information that meets the criteria.
Primary key fields help Access recognize records and not collect the same
information more than once in a query.
Social security numbers make great primary key fields because no two
people have the same social security number. Invoice numbers and serial
numbers also make excellent primary key fields. Returning to the sample
little league database (refer to Figure 1-7), which fields in the little league
database tables are primary key fields? In the Teams table, Team Name can
be the primary key field because no two teams have the same name. Division
Number can also be a primary key field because divisions in the league are
numbered and no two divisions have the same number.
The Players and Coaches database tables, however, present a problem when
it comes to choosing a primary key field. Two players might have the same
last name, which rules out Last Name as a primary key field. A brother and
sister might have the same telephone number, which rules out a Telephone
No. field. Because no field holds values that are certain to be different from
record to record, I introduce fields called Player Number and Coach Number.
For the purpose of this database, players and coaches are assigned numbers.
(Chapter 2 in this mini-book explains how Access can assign sequential
numbers for you in a database table.)
Mapping the relationships between tables
If your database includes more than one table, you have to map how the
tables relate to one another. Usually, relationships are formed between the
primary key field in one table and the corresponding field in another, called
the foreign key. Figure 1-8 shows the relationships between the tables in the
little league database. Because these tables are linked by common fields,
I can gather information from more than one table in a query or report.
Chapter 2 in this mini-book takes up the subject of linking tables in more
detail. For now, when you design your database, consider how to connect
the various tables with common fields.
Figure 1-8:

ships.

To get an idea how database tables can be linked, open the Northwind
sample database and then look in the Relationships window. Click the
Database Tools tab and then click Relationships in the Show/Hide group to
open the Relationships window. The Relationships window shows you how
the various tables are related to one another.

atabase tables are the building blocks of a database. They hold the raw

ate reports from several different tables. How well your database tables are
put together and how accurately data is entered in the tables determine
whether your database is a thing of beauty or a wilted flower.
This chapter explains how to create database tables and fields for the
tables. It explains what primary key fields are and how primary key fields
and indexed fields make it easier for Access to sort, search, and query a
database. This chapter describes how to forge relationships between tables.
Fasten your seatbelts. In this chapter, you can find numerous tips and tricks
for making sure that data is entered accurately in your database tables.
Creating a Database Table
Raw data is stored in database tables (or in a single table if you decide to
keep all the data in one place). The first and most important part of setting
up a database is creating the tables and entering the data. After you enter
the data, you can harass your database for information about the things and
people your database keeps track of. If you haven’t done so already, read
the sections in Chapter 1 of this mini-book that pertain to storing informa-
tion and designing a database before you create a database table. Chapter 1
of this mini-book explains what database tables are and how to fashion a
splendid one.

Creating a Database Table
554
The business of creating a database table starts on the Create tab, as shown
in Figure 2-1.
Select the Tables group in the Navigation pane to view the database’s exist-
ing tables. As I explain in detail in the next pages, Access offers three ways
to create a database table:
✦Create the database table from scratch: Enter and format the fields one
at a time on your own.
✦Get the help of a template: Get prefabricated fields assembled in a
table. This is the way to go if you know Access well, and you can modify
database tables and table fields.
✦Import the database table from another database: This technique can
be an enormous timesaver if you can recycle data that has already been
entered in a database table in another Access database.
Creating a database table from scratch
Creating a table from scratch entails creating the table and then entering the
fields one by one. Follow these steps to create a database table from scratch:
1. Click the Create tab.
2. Click the Table Design button, located in the Tables group (see
Figure 2-1).
The Design window appears. From here, you enter fields for your data-
base table. I hate to be like a City Hall bureaucrat who gives everybody
the runaround, but I can’t help myself. Turn to “Entering and Altering
Table Fields” later in this chapter to find out how to enter fields in a
database table.
Click Table, Table Templates, 
or Table Design.
Click the Create tab.

3. Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar.
The Save As dialog box appears.
4. Enter a descriptive name for your table and click OK.
Return to the Navigation pane and you see the name of the table you
created. If you don’t believe me, click the Tables group to see the names
of tables in your database.
Creating a database table from a template
If you know your way around Access and know how to modify database
tables, you can do worse than create a database table with a template.
Access offers a few different table templates to choose from. After you create
a table with a template, you can remove any fields that you don’t want. It’s
always easier to delete fields than to add new ones.
To create a table with a template, click the Table Templates button on the
Create tab and then select a template from the list, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Choose from Contacts, Tasks, Issues, Events, or Assets. Access creates the
table.
A table appears on-screen, ready for you to enter data. First, you should
explore the fields in your new table. If the table contains fields you don’t
want or you want to change the names of the fields, now is the time to do so.
Turn to “Entering and Altering Table Fields” later in this chapter to find out
how to change and delete fields in a database table.

Importing a table from another database
Few things are more tedious than entering records in a database table. If the
records you need were already entered elsewhere, more power to you.
Follow these steps to get a database table from another Access database:
1. Click the External Data tab.
2. Click the Access button in the Import group.
The Get External Data window opens.
3. Enter a database name and path in the File Name text box or click the
Browse button to find the Access database with the table you need.
4. Select the Import Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports, Macros, and
Modules into the Current Database option button and click OK.
You see the Import Objects dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-3.
5. On the Tables tab, select the database table you want and click OK.
You can import more than one database table by clicking multiple table
names in the dialog box or clicking the Select All button.
If the table you want to import includes lookup fields, import the tables or
queries that the lookup fields refer to as well as the table itself. Without
those tables or queries, the lookup fields won’t be able to obtain any values.
Later in this chapter, “Creating a lookup data-entry list” explains what
lookup fields are.

Opening and Viewing Tables
557
You can import a table structure — its field names and formats — without
importing the data in the table. To do so, click the Options button in the
Import Objects dialog box, and under Import Tables, select the Definition
Only option button.
Opening and Viewing Tables
As with all the so-called objects in a database, you open tables by starting in
the Navigation pane. Select the Tables group to view the database tables you
created. How you open a table depends on whether you want to open it in
Datasheet view or Design view. Figure 2-4 illustrates the difference between
these views. Datasheet view is for entering and examining data in a table;
Design view is for creating fields and describing their parameters.
Select a table and follow these instructions to open it:
✦Opening in Design view: Right-click the table and choose Design View
on the shortcut menu.
✦Opening in Datasheet view: Double-click the table or right-click and
choose Open on the shortcut menu.

✦Switching views: Click the View button on the far left of the Home tab.
This button changes appearance, depending on whether you’re in
Design view or Datasheet view. You can also change views by right-
clicking the table window’s title bar and choosing Datasheet View or
Design View on the shortcut menu.
Entering and Altering Table Fields
After you create a database table, the next task is to enter the fields, or if
Access created the table for you, alter the fields to your liking. As Chapter 1
of this mini-book explains, fields represent categories of information in a
database table. They are the equivalent of columns in a conventional table.
Fields determine what kind of information is stored in a database table.
These pages explain how to create a field, choose the right data type, dis-
play data in fields, and designate the primary key field in a table. While I’m
on the subject of fields, W.C. Fields said, “Horse sense is the thing a horse
has which keeps it from betting on people.”
Creating a field
Follow these steps to create a new field in a database table:
1. Open the table and switch to Design view if you aren’t already there.
You can click the View command on the Home tab to change views.
2. If necessary, insert a new row for the field.
To do so, click in the field that is to go after the new field, and then click
the Insert Rows command in the Tools group on the (Table Tools)
Design tab. A blank row appears.
3. Enter a name in the Field Name column.
Names can’t include periods or be longer than 64 letters, but you don’t
want to enter a long name anyway because it won’t fit very well along
the top of the table.
Some database programs don’t permit spaces in field names. If you
intend to export Access data to other database programs, don’t include
spaces in field names. Instead, run the words together or separate words
with an underscore character, like this: underscore_character.
4. Press the Tab key or click in the Data Type column, and choose a data
type from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Data types classify what kind of information is kept in the field. The next
section, “All about data types,” in this chapter explains data types.

5. (Optional) Enter a description in the Description column.
These descriptions can be very helpful when you need to reacquaint
yourself with a field and find out what it’s meant to do.
In case the name you choose for your field isn’t descriptive enough, you can
give the field a second name. The name appears in Datasheet view, on forms,
and on reports. To enter a second, descriptive field name, enter the name in
the Caption field on the General tab of the Design view window.
Later in this chapter, “Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are
Accurate” demonstrates how to define field properties in the Design view
window to make it easier for data-entry clerks to enter the data.
Choose a data type.

To get Access’s help in creating a field, switch
to Datasheet view and click the (Table Tools)
Datasheet tab. Click the New Field button to
display the Field Templates pane, which usually
appears on the far right of the Access window
(unless you move it). From this pane, select one
or more fields to insert into your table. Just
double-click or drag and drop a field from the
list into the Datasheet view to add that field to
the table. Do the sample tables and sample
fields in this pane look familiar? These are the
same fields you get when you create a data-
base table from a template.

All about data types
To choose a data type for a field, open the Data Type drop-down list in the
Design view window and choose a data type (see Figure 2-5). Data types are
the first line of defense in making sure that data is entered correctly in a
table. Try to enter text in a field assigned the Currency or Number data type,
and Access tells you that your entry is invalid. You get the chance to fix your
mistake as soon as you make it.
Table 2-1 explains the options on the Data Type drop-down list. Choose data
types carefully because how you classify the data that is entered in a field
determines how you can query the field for information. Querying for a
number range is impossible, for example, if the field you’re querying isn’t
classified as a Number or Currency field on the Data Type drop-down list.
Table 2-1
Data Types for Fields
Data Type
What It’s For
Text
For storing text (city names, for example), combinations of text and num-
bers (street addresses, for example), and numbers that won’t be calcu-
lated or used in expressions (telephone numbers and social security
numbers, for example). By default, a Text field is 50 characters long but
Text fields can be 255 characters if you need that many. If you need that
many characters, however, you probably need the Memo data type, not
the Text data type.
Memo
For storing long descriptions. Fields assigned this data type can hold
65,535 characters, not that anyone needs that many. If you fill this field
programmatically, it can hold up to 2GB of data.
Number
For storing numbers to be used in calculations or sorting. (If you’re deal-
ing with monetary figures, choose the Currency data type.)
Date/Time
For storing dates and times and being able to sort data chronologically or
use dates and times in calculations.
Currency
For storing monetary figures for use in calculations and sorting. 
AutoNumber
For entering numbers in sequence that will be different from record to
record. Use the AutoNumber data type for the primary key field if no
other field stores unique, one-of-a-kind data. (See “Designating the pri-
mary key field,” later in this chapter.)
Yes/No
For storing True/False, Yes/No, On/Off type data. Choose this data type to
enter data with a check box in the field. When the box is selected, the
data in the field is True, Yes, or On, for example.
OLE Object
For embedding an OLE link in your Access table to another object — an
Excel worksheet or Word document.
Hyperlink
For storing hyperlinks to other locations on the Internet or on the com-
pany intranet.

Data Type
What It’s For
Attachment
For storing images, spreadsheets, documents, charts, and other types of
supported files to a record in your table. This is similar to attaching a file
to an e-mail message. Attachments provide greater flexibility than OLE
Object fields and are more efficient because they don’t create a bitmap
image of the original file.
Lookup Wizard
For creating a drop-down list with choices that a data-entry clerk can
choose from when entering data. See “Creating a lookup data-entry list,”
later in this chapter.
Designating the primary key field
As I explain in Chapter 1 of this mini-book, no database table is complete
without a primary key field. The primary key field identifies which field in
the table is unique and contains data that differs from record to record.
Duplicate values and null values can’t be entered in the primary key field.
(A null value indicates a missing or unknown value.) Choosing a primary key
field is so important that Access doesn’t let you close a table unless you
choose one.
Deciding how the data in fields is displayed
To decide how numbers, times, dates, currency
values, and Yes/No data are displayed in fields,
open the Format drop-down list on the Field
Properties part of the Design window and
choose an option. These display options are
useful indeed. Choose a number format with a
dollar sign and comma ($3,456.79), for example,
and you don’t have to enter the dollar signs or
commas when you enter data in the field. These
marks are entered for you. You just enter the
numbers.
 @ (at symbol): A character or space is
required. For example, @@@@-@@ inserts
a hyphen between the first set of numbers
and the second. You don’t have to enter the
hyphen, only the text or numbers.
 & (ampersand): A character or space is
optional. For example, @@@@@-&&&& in
a ZIP Code field tells Access that either
entry is correct, a five-character ZIP code
or a five-character plus the four extra char-
acters ZIP code.
 > (right bracket): Displays all characters in
the field as uppercase. Merely by entering
this symbol in the Format text box, you can
display all entries in the field as uppercase
without the data-entry clerk having to hold
down the Shift or Caps Lock key.
 < (left bracket): Displays all characters in
the field as lowercase.

Entering and Altering Table Fields
562
If no field in your table holds one-of-a-kind data that is different from record
to record, get around the problem with one of these techniques:
✦The AutoNumber data type: Create a new field, give it a name, choose
AutoNumber from the Data Type drop-down list (refer to Figure 2-5),
and make your new field the primary key field. This way, when you
enter data, Access enters a unique number to identify each record in
the field. (To generate random numbers instead of sequential numbers
in an AutoNumber field, go the Field Properties tab of the Design view
window and choose Random instead of Increment on the New Values
drop-down list.)
✦A multiple-field primary key: Combine two or more fields and designate
them as the primary key. For example, if you’re absolutely certain that
no two people whose names will be entered in your database table have
the same name, you can make the First Name and Last Name fields the
primary key. The problem with multiple-field primary keys, however, is
that it takes Access longer to process them, and you run the risk of
entering duplicate records.
Follow these steps to designate a field in a database table as the primary key
field:
1. In Design view, select the field or fields you want to be the primary key.
To select a field, click its row selector, the small box to its left; Ctrl+click
row selectors to select more than one field.
2. Click the Primary Key button in the Tools group on the (Table Tools)
Design tab.
A small key symbol appears on the row selector to let you know which
field or fields is the primary key field.
To remove a primary key, click its row selector and then click the Primary
Key button all over again.
Moving, renaming, and deleting fields
Suppose that you need to move, rename, or delete a field. To do so, switch to
Design view and follow these instructions:
✦Moving a field: Select the field’s row selector (the box to its left) and
release the mouse button. Click again and drag the selector up or down
to a new location.
✦Renaming a field: Click in the Field Name box where the name is, delete
the name that’s there, and type a new name.

✦Deleting a field: Click in the Field Name box and click the Delete Rows
button in the Tools group of the ( Table Tools) Design tab. Alternatively,
you can right-click the field and choose Delete Rows on the shortcut
menu.
Field Properties for Making Sure
That Data Entries Are Accurate
Unfortunately, entering the data in a database table is one of the most
tedious activities known to humankind. And because the activity is so dull,
people are prone to make mistakes when they enter data in a database table.
One way to cut down on mistakes is to take advantage of the Field Properties
settings on the General tab in the Design view window. Figure 2-6 shows the
General tab.
These properties determine what can and can’t be entered in the different
fields of a database table. Some of the settings are invaluable. The Field Size
property, for example, determines how many characters can be entered in a
field. In a State field where two-letter state abbreviations are to be entered,
make the Field Size property 2 to be certain that no one enters more than
two characters. If the majority of people you’re tracking in an address data-
base live in New York, enter NY in the Default Value property. That way, you
spare data-entry clerks from having to enter NY the majority of the time.
They won’t have to enter it because NY is already there.
The Lookup tab in the Field Properties part of the Design view window is for
creating a data-entry drop-down list. It, too, is invaluable. If you happen to
know that only four items can be entered in a field, create a drop-down list
with the four items. That way, data-entry clerks can choose from a list of four
valid items instead of having to enter the data themselves and perhaps enter
it incorrectly.

A look at the Field Properties settings
Especially if yours is a large database, you’re encouraged to study the field
properties carefully and make liberal use of them. The Field Properties set-
tings safeguard data from being entered incorrectly. The following is a
description of the different properties (listed here in the order in which they
appear in the Design view window) and instructions for using them wisely.
Which properties you can assign to a field depends on which data type the
field was assigned.
Field Size
In the Field Size box for Text fields, enter the maximum number of charac-
ters that can be entered in the field. Suppose that the field you’re dealing
with is ZIP Code, and you want to enter five-number ZIP codes. By entering 5
in the Field Size text box, only five characters can be entered in the field. A
sleepy data-entry clerk couldn’t enter a six-character ZIP code by accident.
For Number fields, select a value for the field size from the drop-down list.
Table 2-2 describes these field sizes.
Table 2-2
Numeric Field Sizes
Field Size
Description
Byte
A 1-byte integer that holds values from 0–255.
Integer
A 2-byte integer that holds values from 32,768–32,767.
Long Integer
A 4-byte integer that holds values from 2,147,483,648–2,147,483,647.
Single
A 4-byte floating point number that holds large values up to 7 significant
digits.
Double 
An 8-byte floating point number that holds large values up to 15 signifi-
cant digits.
Replication ID
A 16-byte globally unique identifier (GUID) that’s randomly generated.
Decimal
A 12-byte number with defined decimal precision. The default precision
is 0, but you can set the scale up to 28.
The Single, Doubles, and Decimal field size options all hold different ranges
of numbers. For now, if you need to store numbers after the decimal point,
set the data type double so that you cover most situations. For more infor-
mation on the ranges for all these field sizes, check the Access Help program
by pressing F1 with your cursor in the Field Size box.
Format
Earlier in this chapter, “Deciding how the data in fields is displayed” explains
the Format property. Click the drop-down list and choose the format in
which text, numbers, and dates and times are displayed.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Building Your
Database Tables
Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
565
Decimal Places
For a field that holds numbers, open the Decimal Places drop-down list and
choose how many numbers can appear to the right of the decimal point.
This property affects how numbers and currency values are displayed, not
their real value. Numbers are rounded to the nearest decimal point. The
Auto option displays the number of decimal places that the format you
choose on the Format drop-down list permits.
Input Mask
For Text and Date field types, this feature provides a template with punctua-
tion marks to make entering the data easier. Telephone numbers, social
security numbers, and other numbers that typically are entered along with
dashes and parentheses are ideal candidates for an input mask (another
ridiculous database term!). On the datasheet, blank spaces appear where the
numbers go, and the punctuation marks stand at the ready to receive num-
bers, as shown in Figure 2-7.
In the Input Mask text box, enter a 0 where numbers go, and enter the punc-
tuation marks where they go. For example, enter (000) 000-0000 or
000/000-0000 to enter an input mask for a telephone number like the one
shown in Figure 2-7. You can also create input masks by clicking the three
dots beside the Input Mask text box. Doing so opens the Input Mask Wizard
dialog box, where you can fashion a very sophisticated input mask.
Caption
If the field you’re working on has a cryptic or hard-to-understand name,
enter a more descriptive name in the Caption text box. The value in the
Caption property appears as the column heading in Datasheet view, as a
label on forms, and on reports in place of the field name. People entering
data understand what to enter after reading the descriptive caption.
Default Value
When you know that the majority of records require a certain value, number,
or abbreviation, enter it in the Default Value text box. That way, you save
yourself the trouble of entering the value, number, or abbreviation most of
Figure 2-7:
Input masks.

Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
566
the time because the default value appears already in each record when you
enter it. You can always override the default value by entering something
different.
Validation Rule
As long as you know your way around operators and Boolean expressions,
you can establish a rule for entering data in a field. For example, you can
enter an expression that requires dates to be entered in a certain time frame.
Or you can require currency figures to be above or below a certain value. To
establish a validation rule, enter an expression in the Validation Rule text
box. To use dates in an expression, the dates must be enclosed by number
signs (#). Here are some examples of validation rules:
>1000
The value you enter must be over 1000.
<1000
The value you enter must be under 1000.
>=10
The value you enter must be greater than
or equal to ten.
<>0
The value you enter cannot be zero.
>=#1/1/2007#
The date you enter must be January 1,
2007, or later.
>=#1/1/2007# And <#1/1/2008#
The date you enter must be in the year
2007.
To get help forming expressions, click the three dots beside the Validation
Rule text box to open the Expression Builder, as shown in Figure 2-8, and
build an expression there. Try clicking the Help button in the Expression
Builder dialog box. Doing so opens the Access Help program, where you can
get advice about building expressions.
Figure 2-8:
Creating a

rule.

Book VI
Chapter 2

567
Validation Text
If someone enters data that violates a validation rule that you enter in the
Validation Rule text box, Access displays a standard error message. The mes-
sage reads, “One or more values are prohibited by the validation rule set for
[this field]. Enter a value that the expression for this field can accept.” If this
message is too cold and impersonal for you, you can create a message of
your own for the error message dialog box. Enter your friendly message in
the Validation Text text box.
Required
By default, no entry has to be made in a field, but if you choose Yes instead
of No in the Required box and you fail to make an entry in the field, a mes-
sage box tells you to be sure to make an entry.
Allow Zero Length
This property allows you to enter zero-length strings in a field. A zero-length
string — two quotation marks with no text or spaces between them (“”) —
indicates that no value exists for a field. To see how zero-length strings work,
suppose that your database table calls for entering e-mail addresses. If you
didn’t know whether one person has an e-mail address, you would leave the
E-Mail Address field blank. If, however, you knew that the person didn’t have
an e-mail address, you could indicate as much by entering a zero-length
string. Choose Yes on the drop-down list to permit zero-length strings to be
entered in the field.
Indexed
Indicates that the field has been indexed. As “Indexing for Faster Sorts,
Searches, and Queries” explains later in this chapter, indexes make sorting a
field and searching through a field go faster. The word No appears in this text
box if the field has not been indexed.
Unicode Expression
Choose Yes from the Unicode Expression drop-down list if you want to com-
press data that is now stored in Unicode format. Storing data this way saves
on disk space, and you probably don’t want to change this property.
Smart Tags
If you intend to enter Smart Tags in the field, indicate which kind you enter
by clicking the three dots next to the Smart Tags box and choosing an option
in the Smart Tags dialog box. Book VIII, Chapter 1 explains Smart Tags.

Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
568
Text Align
This property determines how the text is aligned in a column or on a form or
report. Select General to let Access determine the alignment, or select Left,
Right, Center, or Distribute.
Text Format
Available on Memo fields, this drop-down list lets you choose to allow rich
text in the field. With this property set to Rich Text, you can make different
words bold, italic, underline, and change font sizes and colors. Set it to Plain
Text for plain, boring text with no formatting. I wonder why that isn’t the set-
ting’s name.
Append Only
Available on Memo fields, this lets you add data only to a Memo field to col-
lect a history of comments.
Show Date Picker
Available on Date/Time field, setting this to For Dates shows a button next to
the column that lets you use a calendar to select a date instead of typing
numbers. Set this to Never if you don’t want to use the date picker, but why
would you do that?
Creating a lookup data-entry list
Perhaps the best way to make sure that data is entered correctly is to create
a data-entry drop-down list. Whoever enters the data in your database table
has to only choose an item from the list, as shown in Figure 2-9. This saves
time and prevents invalid data from being entered. Access offers two ways to
create the drop-down list:
Figure 2-9:
A so-called
lookup list.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Building Your

Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
569
✦Create the list by entering the items yourself: Go this route when
you’re dealing with a finite list of items that never change.
✦Get the items from another database table: Go this route to get items
from a column in another database table. This way, you can choose from
an ever-expanding list of items. When the number of items in the other
database table changes, so does the number of items in the drop-down
list because the items come from the other database table. This is a
great way to get items from a primary key field in another table.
Creating a drop-down list on your own
Follow these steps to create a drop-down, or lookup, list with entries you type:
1. In Design view, click the field that needs a drop-down list.
2. Open the Data Type drop-down list and choose Lookup Wizard, the
last option in the list.
The Lookup Wizard dialog box appears.
3. Select the second option, I Will Type in the Values That I Want, and
click the Next button.
4. Under Col1 in the next dialog box, enter each item you want to appear
in the drop-down list; then click the Next button.
You can create a multicolumn list by entering a number in the Number of
Columns text box and then entering items for the list.
5. Enter a name for the field, if necessary, and click the Finish button.
Switch to Datasheet view and open the drop-down list in the field to
make sure that it displays properly.
To see what’s on a drop-down list, start in Design view, select the field for
which you created the list, and select the Lookup tab in the Field Properties
pane. As shown in Figure 2-10, you can edit the list by editing or removing
items in the Row Source text box. Be sure that a semi-colon (;) appears
between each item. Even easier, click the three dots beside the Row Source
text box to edit the list items. To remove a lookup list from a field, choose
Text Box on the Display Control drop-down list.

Getting list items from a database table
Before you can get list items from another database table, you might want to
define a relationship between the tables; it’s not required, but it’s recom-
mended. The next section of this chapter, “Indexing for Faster Sorts,
Searches, and Queries,” explains how to do that. Follow these steps to get
items in a drop-down list from another database table:
1. In Design view, click the field that needs a list, open the Data Type
drop-down list, and choose Lookup Wizard.
The Lookup Wizard dialog box appears.
2. Select the first option, I Want the Lookup Column to Look Up the
Values in a Table or Query, and click Next.
You see a list of tables in your database.
3. Select the table with the data you need and click the Next button.
The dialog box shows you a list of available fields in the table.
4. Select the field where the data for your list is stored.
5. Click the > button.
The name of the list appears on the right side of the dialog box, under
Selected Fields.
6. Click the Next button.
Normally, lists are displayed in ascending order, but you can select a
field and click the Ascending button to reverse the order of the list.
(Note that the button turns into the Descending button.)
7. Click the Finish button.
If you’re so inclined, you can change the width of the list before clicking
Finish, but you can always do that on the datasheet, as the section
about changing the appearance of the datasheet explains in Chapter 3 of
this mini-book.
Suppose that you obtain the items from the wrong field or wrong database
table? To fix that problem, select the field for which you created the list, and
in Design view, select the Lookup tab (refer to Figure 2-10). Choose Text Box
instead of Combo Box on the Display Control drop-down list and start all over.
Indexing for Faster Sorts, Searches, and Queries
Indexing means to instruct Access to keep information about the data in a
field or combination of fields. Because Access keeps this information on

Book VI
Chapter 2
Building Your

Indexing for Faster Sorts, Searches, and Queries
571
hand, it doesn’t have to actually search through every record in a database
table to sort data, search for data, or run a query. In a large database table,
indexes make sorting, searching, and querying go considerably faster because
Access looks through its own data rather than the data in tables. The perform-
ance difference between querying a database table that has and has not been
indexed is astonishing. That’s the good news. The bad news is that indexes
inflate the size of Access files.
By default, the field you choose as the primary key field is indexed. I recom-
mend choosing other fields for indexing if you often conduct queries and
searches. When you choose a field to index, choose one with data that varies
from record to record and is likely to be the subject of searches, sorts, and
queries. That way, the index means something. However, a field with data
that is mostly the same from record to record is a waste of a good index,
not to mention disk space. By the way, Access automatically indexes fields
whose names include the words ID, Code, Num, and Key, the idea being that
these fields are likely to store essential information worthy of indexing.
Indexing a field
To index a field, switch to Design view, select the field you want to index, and
on the General tab of the Field Properties part of the Design window, open
the Indexed drop-down list and choose one of these options:
✦Yes (Duplicates OK): Indexes the field and allows duplicate values to be
entered in the field.
✦Yes (No Duplicates): Indexes the field and disallows duplicate values. If
you choose this option, the field works something like a primary key
field in that Access does not permit you to enter the same value in two
different records.
Indexing based on more than one field
Creating indexes on more than one field makes sorting, querying, and
searching the database table go faster. It’s especially valuable in sorting
operations where records in one field are often the same but records in a
companion field are different. If you plan on searching through or sorting
on individual fields, create an index on each field you plan on using.
A multifield index is one index created on multiple fields. Use this type of
index when you plan on searching more than one field at a time. For exam-
ple, if you’re going to search through a database for Bob Smith, it’s faster if
you create a multifield index on the First Name and Last Name fields than
if you created individual indexes for both fields.

Indexing for Faster Sorts, Searches, and Queries
572
Follow these steps to generate a multifield index:
1. Starting in Design view, click the Indexes button in the Show/Hide
group of the (Table Tools) Design tab.
You see the Indexes dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-11. The dialog box
lists the primary key field already because it’s indexed by default. You
also see any fields to which you set the Indexed property to Yes.
2. On a blank line in the dialog box, enter a name for the index in the
Index Name column.
3. In the Field Name column, open the drop-down list and choose the
first field you want for the multifield index.
Access sorts the records first on this field and then on the second field
you choose.
4. In the next row, leave the Index Name blank and choose another field
name from the drop-down list.
This field is the second field in the index. You can use as many as ten 
different fields in a multifield index. In Figure 2-11, two fields are in the
index: First Name and Last Name.
5. Choose Descending in the Sort Order column if you want the field
sorted in descending order.
Most of the time, you want leave the Sort Order set to Ascending
because most people read from A to Z.

Establishing Relationships between Database Tables
As the section about mapping the relationships between tables in Chapter 1
of this mini-book explains, you have to establish relationships between tables
if you want to query or generate reports with data from more than one data-
base table. Relationships define the field that two separate tables have in
common. To understand why relationships between tables are necessary,
consider the query shown in Figure 2-12. The purpose of this query is to list
all companies that ordered items in 2006, list the companies by name, and
list the city and country where each company is located. Figure 2-13 shows
the results of the query.
Figure 2-13:
Results of
the query in
Figure 2-12.
Table relationship
Tables being queried
Figure 2-12:
A query.

Establishing Relationships between Database Tables
574
Consider what Access does to run this query:
✦Access deals with two database tables, Customers and Orders.
✦In the Orders table, Access looks in the Order Date field to isolate all
records that describe orders made in the year 2006. The expression for
finding these records is shown on the Criteria line in Figure 2-12:
Between #1/1/2006# And #12/31/2006#.
✦Because there is a relationship between the ID field in the Customers
table and the Customer ID field in the Orders table — because the two
fields hold the same type of information — Access can match the 2006
records it finds in the Orders table with corresponding records in the
Customers table. Where the Customer ID of a 2006 record in the Orders
table and an ID in the Customers table match, Access assembles a new
record and places it in the query results. As Figure 2-13 demonstrates,
the query records list customer IDs, company names, cities, countries,
and order dates.
✦Data for determining which records appear in the query results is
found in the Order Date field in the Orders table. But the information
compiled in the query results — customer IDs, company names, cities,
and countries — comes from fields in the Customers table. Thanks to
the relationship between the ID and Customer ID fields in these tables,
Access can draw upon information from both tables.
Types of relationships
The vast majority of relationships between tables are one-to-many relation-
ships between the primary key field in one database table and a field in
another. Table relationships fall in these categories:
✦One-to-many relationship: Each record in one table is linked to many
records in another table. The relationship in Figure 2-12 is a one-to-many
relationship. Each ID number appears only once in the ID field of the
Customers table, but in the Orders table, the same Customer ID number
can appear in many records because the same customer can order
many different products. When you link tables, Access creates a one-to-
many relationship when one of the fields being linked is either a primary
key field or an indexed field assigned the No (No Duplicates) setting. (See
“Indexing for Faster Sorts, Searches, and Queries” earlier in this chapter.)
✦One-to-one relationship: Two fields are linked. This relationship is rare
and is sometimes used for security purposes.
✦Many-to-many relationship: This complex relationship actually describes
crisscrossing relationships in which the linking field is not the primary
key field in either table. To create a many-to-many relationship, an inter-
mediary table called a junction table is needed. This relationship is rare.

Book VI
Chapter 2

575
Sometimes, fields in separate tables that hold the same data also have the
same name, but that isn’t necessary. For example, a field called ZIP Code in
one table might be called Postal Code in another. What matters is that fields
that are linked have the same data type and size. For example, you can’t
create a relationship between a text field and a number field.
Finding your way around the Relationships window
To display the tables in a database and link tables to one another or see how
they’re related to each other, click the Relationships button on the Database
Tools tab. You see the Relationships window, as shown in Figure 2-14. Notice
the field names in each table. The primary key field is shown with a picture
of a key next to it. Lines in the window show how relationships have been
established between tables.
Apart from linking tables (a subject I explain shortly) in the Relationships
window, here’s all you need to know about this window:
✦Handling the tables: Each table appears in its own window. Drag tables
from place to place, drag a border to change a window’s size, and scroll
to see field names.
✦Removing a table from the window: Right-click the table and choose
Hide Table on the shortcut menu.

✦Removing all tables from the window: Click the Clear Layout button
on the (Relationship Tools) Design tab and select Yes in the confirma-
tion box.
✦Placing tables back on the window: To put selected tables back in the
window, click the Show Table button, and in the Show Table dialog box,
select the tables and click the Add button. To put all the tables with rela-
tionships back in the window, click the All Relationships button, also on
the (Relationship Tools) Design tab.
✦Studying a table’s relationships: Click the Clear Layout button to
remove all tables from the window; then place the table back in the
window, select it, and click the Direct Relationships button on the
(Relationship Tools) Design tab. All tables that are related to the
selected table are added to the layout.
Placing tables in the Relationships window
The first time you open the Relationships
window, you see the Show Table dialog box.
The purpose of this dialog box is to find out
which tables to put in the Relationships
window. Ctrl+click to select tables and then
click the Add button.
If you create a new database table and need to
place it in the Relationships window, click the
Relationships button to display the Relationships
window; then click the Show Table button on the
(Relationship Tools) Design tab. The Show Table
dialog box appears. Select your new table and
click the Add button.

Forging relationships between tables
Make sure that both tables are on display in the Relationships window and
then follow these steps to forge a relationship between them:
1. Click to select the field in one table; then hold down the mouse
button, drag the pointer to the field in the other table where you want
to forge the link, and release the mouse button.
You see the Edit Relationships dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-15. This
dragging between table fields is probably the most awkward thing you
undertake in Office 2007! If you do it right, a bar appears where the
pointer is while you move it over the second table, and the names of the
two fields appear in the Edit Relationships dialog box.
Notice the Relationship Type at the bottom of the dialog box. If you acci-
dentally create a link to the wrong field, choose the correct field from
the drop-down list in the dialog box.
2. Select the Enforce Referential Integrity check box.
If you don’t select this box, the relationship between the tables is inde-
terminate, instead of being a one-to-many relationship. Referential
integrity (another hideous database term!) has to do with whether values
in the two different fields corroborate each other.
3. (Optional) Select Cascade options.
One of these options is excellent, and the other is dangerous:
• Cascade Update Related Fields: If you change a value on the “one”
side of the relationship, a matching value on the “many” side
changes as well to preserve referential integrity. For example, if
Fields for the link

relationship.

Establishing Relationships between Database Tables
578
you create a multifield primary key of First Name and Last Name
and then change the name of someone, the related fields in the
other table change automatically to preserve referential integrity.
This is a great way to make sure that information is up to date.
• Cascade Delete Related Records: If you delete a record in the “one”
table, all records in the “many” table to which the deleted record is
linked are also deleted. In Figure 2-15, for example, if I delete an
employee from the “one” table, all records in the “many” table that
include that employee are deleted! Access warns you before making
the deletion, but still! This option is dangerous, and I don’t recom-
mend selecting it.
4. Click the Create button to forge the relationship.
In the Relationships window (refer to Figure 2-14), a line is drawn
between the table fields. The number 1 appears on the “one” side
of the relationship and the infinity symbol (∞) appears on the “many”
side.
If you mistakenly establish a relationship between the wrong fields, right-
click the line between the fields, choose Delete on the shortcut menu
(refer to Figure 2-14), and select Yes in the confirmation box. Choose Edit
Relationship to open the Edit Relationship dialog box and rethink the link
(hey, that rhymes!).
After you create a one-to-many relationship between tables with the Enforce
Referential Integrity check box selected, you can’t enter a value in the
“many” table unless it’s already in the “one” table. For example, suppose
that the “one” table includes a primary key field called Employee Number,
and this field is linked to a field in the “many” table that’s also called
Employee Number. If you enter an Employee Number in the “many” table
that isn’t in the “one” table, Access warns you that it can’t be done without
violating referential integrity. The best way to solve this problem is to create
a lookup data-entry list in the “many” table with values from the primary
key field in the “one” table. See “Creating a lookup data-entry list,” earlier
in this chapter.
To generate and print an Access report that shows how tables in your data-
base are linked, open the Relationships window and click the Relationship
Report button on the (Relationship Tools) Design tab. Then save the report
and print it. I explain Access reports in Chapter 5 of this mini-book.

Subdatasheets
In Datasheet view, Access gives you the oppor-
tunity to view the “many” records that are
linked to a field when a relationship is estab-
lished between tables. The records appear on
a subdatasheet. In the database shown in this
illustration, the Orders and Order Details tables
are linked on the Order ID field — the primary
key of the Orders table and the “one” side of
the relationship. In the Order Details table, I can
click the plus sign (+) in a record to see the
“many” records that are linked to Order ID, the
primary key field. For this illustration, I clicked
the plus sign to see the details for Order 31. The
information on the subdatasheet comes from
the Order Details table. Click the minus sign (–)
to hide a subdatasheet.

 Finding and replacing your data
A
t last — you can start entering the data. If you set up your database
tables, named the fields, and established relationships between the
tables, you’re ready to go. This short chapter explains how to enter the data
in a database table. It shows you how to enter data on a datasheet or enter
data by way of a form. This chapter also describes how to find missing
records in case one goes astray.
There’s no getting around it. Entering data is truly a tedious activity. But if
you set up the fields well and take advantage of input masks and other field
properties, it isn’t so bad. It’s better than stepping on a shovel blade,
anyway.
The Two Ways to Enter Data
When it comes to entering data in a database table, you can take your pick
between Datasheet view and a form. Figure 3-1 compares and contrasts the
two. Here are the advantages of entering data in Datasheet view:
✦Many records appear at once.
✦You can compare data easily between records.
✦You can sort by column with the commands in the Sort and Filter group
on the Home tab (as discussed in Chapter 4 of this mini-book).
✦You can scroll up or down to locate records.

Entering the Data in Datasheet View
582
Here are the advantages of entering the data in a form:
✦You don’t have to scroll left or right to see all the fields.
✦You can display data in a logical format instead of rows and columns.
✦Fields are clearly labeled so that you always know what to enter.
Entering the Data in Datasheet View
Entering data in Datasheet view is like entering data in a conventional table.
As with a table, a datasheet has columns and rows. Records are entered in
rows, and each column represents a field. Fans of Datasheet view like being
able to look at a dozen records simultaneously. They like being able to open
subdatasheets. (Chapter 2 of this mini-book explains what those are.) For
fans of Datasheet view, these pages explain how to enter data in a datasheet
and change a datasheet’s appearance.
Database tables open in Datasheet view when you double-click their names
in the Navigation pane. But if you happen to be gazing at a table in Design
view, click the View command on the far left of the Home tab.
Entering data
In Datasheet view, the bottom of the window tells you how many records
were entered in the datasheet and which record the pointer is in. To enter a

new record, move to a new, empty row and start entering the data. To create
a new row, do one of the following:
✦Click the New command in the Records group on the Home tab.
✦Click the New Record button in the Navigation buttons that appear at
the bottom of the Datasheet view window.
✦Scroll to the bottom of the Datasheet view window and begin typing in
the row with an asterisk (*) next to it.
✦Press Ctrl++ (the plus key).
A pencil icon appears on the row selector to let you know which record
you’re dealing with. To get from field to field, click in a field, press the Tab
key, or press Enter. Table 3-1 lists keyboard shortcuts for getting around in a
datasheet.

To delete a record, click its row selector and then click the Delete command

tion box.
Two tricks for entering data quicker
In a database table with many fields, it’s sometimes hard to tell what data to
enter. When the pointer is in the sixth or seventh field, for example, you can
lose sight of the first field, the one on the left side of the datasheet that usually

Entering the Data in Datasheet View
584
identifies the person or item whose record you’re entering. To freeze a field so
that it appears on-screen no matter how far you travel toward the right side of
the datasheet, right-click the column’s heading and choose Freeze Columns
from the shortcut menu. To unfreeze the fields, right-click the column heading
and choose Unfreeze All Columns from the shortcut menu. You can freeze
more than one field by dragging across field names at the top of the datasheet
before choosing to freeze the columns. Is it getting cold in here?
Another way to handle the problem of not being able to identify where data
is supposed to be entered is to hide columns in the datasheet. To perform
this trick, select the columns you want to hide by dragging the pointer
across their names; then right-click the column heading and choose Hide
Columns from the shortcut menu. To see the columns again, right-click any
column heading and choose Unhide Columns from the shortcut menu. Any
fields that are checked appear in the datasheet.
The fastest way to hide a column is to drag the border between it and the
next column to the left until the column disappears.
Entering data in the Zoom box
To make putting a long entry in a field a little
easier, Access offers the Zoom box. Instead of
having to stay within the narrow confines of a
datasheet field, you can press Shift+F2 to open
the Zoom box and enter the data there. After
you click OK, the data is entered in the field. The
Zoom box is especially convenient for entering
data in a Memo field. As Chapter 2 in this mini-
book explains, Memo fields can hold a whop-
ping 65,535 characters, including rich text.
Move the cursor into a field and press Shift+F2
to open the Zoom box and read all the text in the
field.

Changing the appearance of the datasheet
To make the datasheet a little less cluttered and unwieldy, try experimenting
with its appearance. Access offers a few handy shortcuts for doing just that:
✦Rearranging columns: To move a column to a different location, click its
name at the top of the datasheet and drag it to the left or right.
✦Resizing columns: Move the pointer between column names at the top
of the datasheet, and when you see the double-headed arrow, click and
start dragging. To make a column just large enough to fit its widest
entry, move the pointer between column names and double-click when
you see the double-headed arrow.
✦Changing fonts: The default font for a datasheet is Calibri 11-point,
but you can choose commands in the Font group on the Home tab to
perhaps make entering data a little less mind-numbing.
✦Changing the look of gridlines: Open the drop-down list on the Gridlines
button and choose options to change the number and thickness of
gridlines.
✦Alternate row colors: Open the drop-down list on the Alternate Fill/Back
Color button and choose options to change the background colors of
the datasheet or to add a background color to alternating rows.
To experiment all at one time with the many options for changing a data-
sheet’s appearance, click the Font group button on the Home tab and play
with options in the Datasheet Formatting dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2.
If you want a customized look for all the datasheets you work on, click the
Office button and select Access Options. Then select Datasheet in the left
pane of the Access Options dialog box and go to town.
Figure 3-2:

Entering the Data in a Form
586
Entering the Data in a Form
Forms like the one shown in Figure 3-3 are very convenient for entering data.
The labels tell you exactly what to enter. Personally, I prefer entering data in
a form to entering data on a datasheet. On a form, you take it one step —
make that one record — at a time. Not looking at a dozen records makes the
task of entering data a little easier. These pages explain how to create a form
for entering information in a database table. You also get tried-and-true
advice for moving around with the Navigation buttons.
Creating a form
Fortunately, the Form Wizard makes it very simple to create a form for enter-
ing information in a database table. All you have to do is start the wizard,
choose the table, and make a couple of design decisions. To create a form,
click the Create tab and choose Form Wizard from the More Forms drop-down
list. You see the first of several Form Wizard dialog boxes. Answer these ques-
tions and keep clicking the Next button until the time comes to click Finish:
✦Tables/Queries: From the drop-down list, choose the name of the data-
base table you need to enter data in.
✦Selected Fields: Click the >> button to enter all the field names in the
Select Fields box.
Figure 3-3:
A form.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Entering the Data
Entering the Data in a Form
587
✦Layout: Select the Columnar option button. The other layouts aren’t much
good for entering data in a table. If you choose Tabular or Datasheet, you
may as well enter data straight into the datasheet rather than rely on a
form.
✦Style: Choose a look for the form.
Click the Save button to save and name your form. (I suggest naming it after
the database table you create it for.) When you want to enter data by way
of the form you create, select the Forms group in the Navigation pane and
double-click the form.
If you’re in a hurry to create a form, select a table in the Navigation pane and
click the Create tab. Select Form, Split Form, or Multiple Items from the
Forms group. Just like magic, Access creates a new form for you.
Entering the data
To enter data in a form, click the New Record button on the Navigation but-
tons and start typing. Press the Tab key, press the Enter key, or click to move
from field to field. You can move backwards through the fields by pressing
Shift+Tab. If you enter half a record and want to start over, press the Esc key
to empty the current field. Press Esc again to empty all the fields.
The Navigation buttons (refer to Figure 3-3) at the bottom of the form window
tell you how many records are in the database table and which record you’re
looking at. Click the different Navigation buttons to do the following:
✦Go to the first record in the database table. You can also press
Ctrl+Home.
✦Go to the previous record.
✦Go to the next record.
✦Go to the last record. You can also press Ctrl+End.
To delete a record from a form, click the Delete command’s drop-down list
in the Records group on the Home tab, and choose Delete Record. Access
asks whether you really want to delete the record. Click Yes in the confirma-
tion box.

Finding a Missing Record
588
Finding a Missing Record
Sometimes data goes astray. You scroll through a datasheet but simply can’t
find the item or record you need so bad. For times like those, Access offers the
Find command. Use the command to scour a database for errant information.
Open the database table with the data that needs finding. If you know in
which field the data is located, click in the field. You can save a little time
that way. Then click the Find command on the far right of the Home tab or
press Ctrl+F. You see the Find and Replace dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Fill in the dialog box as follows:
✦Find What: Enter the item you’re looking for. If you’re looking for a null
value, enter null in this text box. Enter “” (two double-quotation marks)
to find zero-length strings. Table 3-2 describes the wildcard characters
you can use in searches.
✦Look In: If you click in a field before choosing the Find command, the
field’s name appears in this box. To search the entire database table,
choose its name from the drop-down list.
✦Match: Choose the option that describes what you know about the item.
Choosing the Any Part of Field option can make for a long search. For
example, a search for the letters chin finds, among others, China, Ching,
and itching — any word with the consecutive letters chin.
✦Search: Choose an option — All, Up, or Down — that describes which
direction to start searching.
✦Match Case: If you know the combination of upper- and lowercase let-
ters you’re after and you enter the combination in the Find What text
box, select this check box.
✦Search Fields As Formatted: If you’re searching for a field that has been
formatted a certain way, select this check box and make sure that the text
or numbers you enter in the Find What text box are formatted correctly.
For example, if you’re searching for a record with the date July 31, 1958,
and you choose the mm/dd/yyyy format, enter the date as 07/31/1958.

Click the Find Next button to conduct the search. The item might be found in
more than one location. Keep clicking Find Next until you find the item or
you die of thirst on the hot sands of the digital desert.
Table 3-2
Wildcard Characters for Searches

Description
Example
?
A single character
b?t finds bat, bet, bit, and but.
#
A single numeric digit
9411# finds 94111, 94112, 94113,
and so on.
*
Any group of consecutive characters
t*o finds to, two, and tattoo.
[xyz]
Any character in the brackets
t[aio]pper finds tapper, tipper, and
topper, but not tupper.
[!xy]
Any character not in the brackets
p[!io]t finds pat and pet, but not
pit and pot.
x–z
Any character in a range of characters
[1–4]000 finds 1000, 2000, 3000, and
4000, but not 5000. The range must
be in ascending order.
To quickly find the first value of a search term, start typing in the Search box
at the bottom of the form window (refer to Figure 3-3), and the pointer jumps
to find the data while you type. Access finds only the first value, but you can
press Ctrl+F and click Find Next to find the next match. This works in forms
and in Datasheet view.
Finding and Replacing Data
Finding and replacing data is remarkably similar to finding data. The difference
is that you enter data in the Replace With text box as well as the familiar
Find What text box and other option boxes. Figure 3-5 shows the Replace tab
of the Find and Replace dialog box. Does it look familiar? If it doesn’t, read
the preceding section in this chapter.
Figure 3-5:
Replacing
data.

Finding and Replacing Data
590
Choose Replace from the Find group on the Home tab (or press Ctrl+H) to
open the Replace tab of the Find and Replace dialog box. After you enter the
replacement data in the Replace With text box, make sure that Whole Field is
selected in the Match drop-down list. Conducting a find-and-replace opera-
tion with Any Part of Field or Start of Field selected in the Match drop-down
list can have unintended consequences. For example, a search for Brook also
finds Brooklyn, Middlebrook, and other words that include brook. Blindly
replacing the brook text string with stream produces, for example, Streamlyn
and Middlestream.
Unless you’re as confident as a gambler with four aces, don’t click the
Replace All button to replace all instances of the text or numbers in the data-
base table or field you’re searching in. Instead, click the Replace button to
find and replace text or numbers one instance at a time.
You can also find and replace data with an update query. See the section
about update queries in Chapter 4 of this mini-book.

N
ow that you’ve laid the groundwork, you can put your database
through its paces and make it do what databases are meant to do —
provide information of one kind or another. This chapter explains how to
pester a database for names, addresses, dates, statistical averages, and
what not. It shows how to sort records and filter a database table to see
records of a certain kind. You also find out how to query a database to get it
to yield its dirty little secrets and invaluable information.
Sorting Records in a Database Table
Sorting rearranges records in a database table (or subdatasheet) so that the
records appear in alphabetical, numerical, or date order in one field. By
sorting the records in a database, you can locate records faster. What’s
more, being able to sort data means that you don’t have to bother about the
order in which you enter records because you can always sort them later to
put them in a particular order.
Records can be sorted in ascending or descending order:
✦Ascending order: Arranges records in alphabetical order from A to Z,
numbers from smallest to largest, and dates chronologically from earli-
est to latest.
✦Descending order: Arranges text from Z to A, numbers from largest to
smallest, and dates chronologically from latest to earliest.
The database tables, as shown in Figure 4-1, present the same information. In
the table on the left, records have been sorted in ascending order in the Order

Sorting Records in a Database Table

ID field. In the table on the right, records have been sorted in descending
order in the Order Date field. Notice the sort indicator in the column heading;
↑indicates an ascending sort, and ↓indicates a descending sort.
Follow these steps to sort the records in a database table:
1. In Datasheet view, click anywhere in the field by which you want to
sort the records.
2. Click the Sort A to Z or Sort Z to A button in the Sort & Filter group on
the Home tab.
You can also right-click a field name at the top of a column and choose
to sort from A to Z or Z to A on the shortcut menu. The menu choices
change based on the type of data. For Number fields, you can sort small-
est to largest and vice versa; for Date fields, choose to sort oldest to
newest, or vice versa.
You can sort on more than one field by clicking a field and sorting ascending
or descending and then clicking a second field and sorting ascending or
descending. Just make sure you sort the fields in reverse order. For example,
to sort the database by the Employee, Customer, and Order ID fields, click in
Order ID and then sort it ascending; click in Customer and then sort it
ascending; click in Employee and then sort it ascending. If you mess up and
forget how the table is sorted, click the Clear All Sorts button — located
underneath the Sort A to Z and Sort Z to A buttons on the Home tab.

Filtering to Find Information
593
Filtering to Find Information
Filtering isolates all the records in a database table that have the same field
values or nearly the same field values. Instead of all the records in the table
appearing on the datasheet, only records that meet the search criteria
appear, as shown in Figure 4-2. The basic idea behind filtering is to choose a
field value in the database table and use it as the standard for finding or
excluding records. For example, you can find all the orders for a particular
customer, all orders taken in the month of April, or all the orders that a par-
ticular customer placed in April. For that matter, you can filter by exclusion
and see the records of all the orders in a database table not taken in April
and not for a particular customer. Filtering is useful when you need to find
records with specific information in a single database table.
Different ways to filter a database table
Here are shorthand descriptions of the four ways to filter a database table.
These techniques are described in detail in the upcoming pages.
✦Common Filters: Select from several popular filters by clicking the icon
in the column header. This type of filter is available for all field types
except OLE Objects and calculated fields. This filtering method keeps
you from spending time trying to get the filter criteria correct.
✦Filter by Selection: Select all or part of a field in the database table and
click the Selection button in the Sort & Filter group on the Home tab.
Access isolates all records with the data you select. This method works
best when you can’t quite decide what you’re looking for and permits
you to look for data found in the whole field or in part of a field. It even
lets you filter data that doesn’t match the selection.
✦Filter by Form: With the database table displayed, select Filter by Form
from the drop-down list on the Advanced button. You see a form with
one drop-down list for each field in your table. From the drop-down lists,
make choices to describe the records you’re looking for and then click
the Toggle Filter button. This method is more flexible than filtering by
Filter indicators
Figure 4-2:
Results of
a filtering
operation.

Filtering to Find Information
594
selection because you can choose more than one field to filter with and
you can search for different kinds of information in the same field. For
example, you can isolate the records of people named Smith who also
live in California, or the people who live in California or New York.
✦Advanced Filter/Sort: Choose Advanced Filter/Sort from the drop-down
list on the Advanced button, and in the Filter window, drag the name of
the field you’re filtering onto the grid. Then enter a search criterion,
choose a Sort option, and click the Apply Filter button. This filtering tech-
nique has more in common with queries than filters. Truth be told, the
Advanced Filter/Sort command is merely a way to query a single table.
You can tell when you’re looking at a subset of filtered records rather than a
database table because Filtered appears at the bottom of the window next to
the Navigation buttons (refer to Figure 4-2). Also, the filter icon (a funnel)
appears in the column heading, and the Toggle Filter command on the
Ribbon appears highlighted. If you can’t tell if a table has been filtered, a trip
to the eye doctor is long overdue.
When you have finished filtering a database table and you want to see all the
records in the table again, click the Toggle Filter button in the Sort & Filter
group on the Home tab or click Filtered at the bottom of the window. To
apply the same filter, click Toggle Filter or Unfiltered at the bottom of the
window. After you define a filter, you can turn it on and off using these meth-
ods. To clear the filter so that you can start over, choose Clear All Filters
from the drop-down list on the Advanced button. After you clear the filter,
you can’t use it again unless you rebuild it.
Common filters
A common filter is a powerful new tool that lets you get data that you want in a
clear, easy-to-use interface. The list of filters that are available depends on the
selected field’s data type and values. Because a picture is worth a thousand
words, take a look at Figure 4-3 to see the Filtering options for the Category
field.
Clicking the down arrow in the column heading shows the available options
for that field. From this menu, you can sort the field as ascending or
descending, clear the filter for the field, apply patterns and ranges (text,
number, and date) for the field, and select check boxes for actual data
values. You don’t have to remember all the data in a field. Let the database
do the work for you.
Custom text filters for the Category field let you define patterns of data. For
Text fields, you can select a filter that equals, begins with, contains, or ends
with a value. You can also select a filter that doesn’t match any of those
specifications. Choose the option from the Text Filters submenu, and a
Custom Filter dialog box appears, enabling you to enter the filter’s criteria.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Sorting, Querying,
and Filtering
for Data
Filtering to Find Information
595
Custom number filters include filtering for data that equals, does not equal,
is greater than, is less than, or between two values. Date fields let you
choose from these same options but add many more for today, tomorrow,
this quarter, last quarter, and way too many more to mention here. This
book is heavy enough!
The hands-down, best in show Filtering option is the list of data values at the
bottom of the menu. From this list, select and deselect the data values you
want to see and then click OK. If you just want to see Beverages and Cereal,
for example, check those values in the list.
To filter one or two items in the list, deselect the Select All check box to
clear all the check boxes and then select the values that you want to see in
your filter. To see records that don’t contain any values in the selected field,
select the Blanks check box.
Filtering by selection
Filtering by selection is the fastest way to filter a database table. It’s also the
best way when you’re not sure what you’re looking for because you can
search for partial words and phrases. Follow these steps to filter by selection:
1. Display the database table that needs filtering in Datasheet view.
2. Tell Access how to filter the records.
To find all records with the same value or text in a particular field,
simply click in a field with the value or text. If you aren’t quite sure what
to look for, select part of a field. For example, to find all names that start
with the letters St, select St in one of the name fields.

3. Click the Selection button in the Sort & Filter group on the Home tab
to display the Selection options.
The options are similar to the custom filter options described in
“Common filters,” only these options are specific to the data in the cur-
rent cell. For example, if you click a Last Name field that contains the
name Smith and click the Selection command, you see options, such as
Equals Smith and Does Not Contain Smith. Select an option, and the
filter is applied immediately.
Filtering by form
Filtering by form permits you to search more than one field in a database
table as well as search fields more than once. For example, you can tell
Access to look in the Last Name field for people named Martinez, as well as
look in the City field for Martinezes who live in Los Angeles or San Francisco.
Searching twice in the same field is an OR search. To be included in the filter-
ing results, a record has only to satisfy one or the other criterion. Follow
these steps to filter by form:
1. In Datasheet view, choose Filter by Form from the drop-down list on
the Advanced button.
Only field names appear on the datasheet, as shown in Figure 4-4.
2. Click in a field, open its drop-down list, and choose the value or text
you want to search for.
To search in more than one field, open another drop-down list and
choose a value or text entry from it. In Number and Currency fields, you
can enter comparison operators to search for values. Table 4-1 explains
the comparison operators.
Click to search more than 
once in the same field.
Select or enter a criterion.

3. To perform an Or search on the data, click the Or tab and then choose
a value or text from the drop-down list in any field.
When you click the Or tab, the search choices you made previously dis-
appear from the screen. Don’t worry — Access remembers them on the
Look For tab. You can click the Or tab again if you want to enter more
criteria for Or searching.
4. Click the Toggle Filter button.
The results of the filtering operation appear in the datasheet.

If you click the Filter by Form button to try to filter by form a second time,
the criteria you entered previously appear in the datasheet window. Choose
Clear Grid — also in the drop-down list on the Advanced button — to empty
the datasheet and start all over.
Some kinds of filtering operations can be saved and ran again, but to save
them, you must save them as queries. With the desired filter in Filter by Form
view, choose Save As Query from the drop-down list on the Advanced button;
then enter a name in the Save As Query dialog box and click OK to save results
of the filtering operation. Choose Load from Query to apply the saved filter.
Later in this chapter, “Querying: The Basics” explains how to run queries.
Running an Advanced Filter/Sort
This command — choose Advanced Filter/Sort from the drop-down list on
the Advanced button to activate — works exactly like a query except that it
works on only one database table. If you’re tempted to use this command,
resist the temptation. Run a query instead.

Querying: The Basics
598
Querying: The Basics
Querying means to ask a question of a database and get an answer in the
form of records that meet the query criteria. Query when you want to ask a
detailed question of a database. “Who lives in Los Angeles and donated more
than $500 last year?” is an example of a query. So is, “Which orders were pur-
chased by people who live in California and therefore, have to pay sales tax,
and how much sales tax was charged with these orders?” A query can search
for information in more than one database table. For that matter, you can
query other queries for information. A query can be as sophisticated or as
simple as you need it to be. In the results of the query, you can show all the
fields in a database table or only a few necessary fields.
Access offers several different ways to query a database. (The techniques
are described later in this chapter in “Six Kinds of Queries.”) Still, no matter
which kind of query you’re dealing with, the basics of setting up and running
a query are the same. You start with the Create tab to build new queries. Or,
you use the Queries group in the Navigation pane to open an existing query
by double-clicking its name. The following pages introduce you to queries,
how to create them, and how to modify them.
The difference between a filter and a query
The biggest difference between filtering and
querying is that you can save a query and call
upon it more than once. Queries are kept at the
ready in the Navigation pane. A filter, on the
other hand, is as good as the first time you use
it, although you can save and run it as a query.
Filters apply to a single database table,
whereas you can query to assemble informa-
tion from more than one table. In the results of
a query, you can include as many fields as you
want, but the results of a filtering operation
show all the fields in the database table,
whether you want them or not.
When it comes to examining data, a query is
more sophisticated than a filter. Although you
can use standard comparison operators to find
records by filtering, querying gives you the
opportunity to use complex expressions as well
as comparison operators. You can filter, for
example, to find people whose income is
greater than or less than a certain amount.
However, because you can write expressions
in queries, you can query to find people whose
income falls within a certain range.

Creating a new query
To create a new query, start from the Create tab and click Query Design or
Query Wizard (in the Other group).
✦Create the query in Design view: Click the Query Design button to see
the Query Design window, as shown in Figure 4-5, as well as the Show
Table dialog box for telling Access which database tables to query.
Construct your query in the Query Design window (the following pages
explain how).
✦Create the query with a wizard: Click the Query Wizard button to dis-
play the New Query dialog box and then choose a wizard option (four
possible Query Wizards are available) and answer the questions that the
Query Wizard asks. You’re asked which table or tables to query, which
fields to include in the query, and which fields to include in the query
results (the following pages explain these issues).
Finding your way around the Query Design window
The Query Design window (see Figure 4-5) is where you construct a query or
retool a query you constructed already. You see this window straightaway
after you click the Query Design button to construct a new query. Right-click
a query in the Navigation pane and then choose Design View on the shortcut
menu to open the Query Design window and fiddle with the query design to
make it better.
Table pane
Design grid

window.

Querying: The Basics

The Query Design window is divided into halves:
✦Table pane: Lists the database tables you’re querying as well as the
fields in each table. You can drag the tables to new locations or drag a
table border to change its size and view more fields.
✦Design grid: Lists which fields to query from the tables, how to sort the
query results, which fields to show in the query results, and criteria for
locating records in fields.
To run a query starting in the Query Design window, click the Run button in
the Results group on the (Query Tools) Design tab.
Choosing which database tables to query
To choose which database tables (and queries as well) to get information
from, click the Show Table button in the Query Setup group on the (Query
Tools) Design tab. You see the Show Table dialog box. The Tables tab lists all
the database tables you create for your database. Ctrl+click to select the
tables you want to query and then click the Add button. To query a query,
go to the Queries tab and select the query.
The tables and queries you choose appear in the Table pane of the Query
Design window (refer to Figure 4-5). To remove a table from a query, right-
click it in the Table pane and choose Remove Table on the shortcut menu.
In order to query more than one table, you need to establish relationships
between tables. (See the section in Chapter 2 of this mini-book about estab-
lishing relationships between database tables.) So-called join lines in the
Query Design window show how the tables are related to one another.
If you haven’t defined relationships between the tables, you can still join
them together by dragging a field from one table onto a field in another
table. This is the same method used to create relationships between tables.
Joining tables in a query doesn’t create an actual relationship; it’s just a tem-
porary join for the sake of the query.
Choosing which fields to query
If you selected which tables to query, the next step is to choose which fields
to query from the tables you selected. The field names in each table appear
in the Table pane. The object is to list fields from the Table pane in the first
row of the Design grid, as shown in Figure 4-6. As the figure shows, the fields
whose names you enter in the Design grid are the fields that produce query
results.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Sorting, Querying,
and Filtering
for Data
Querying: The Basics
601
Access offers these techniques for listing field names in the first row of the
Design grid:
✦Dragging a field name: Drag a field name into a column on the Design
grid. The field name appears on the grid, as does the name of the table
that you drag the field name from.
✦Double-clicking a field name: Double-click a field name to place it in the
next available column in the Design grid.
✦Choosing a table and field name: Click in the Table row and choose the
name of a table from the drop-down list. Then, in the Field box directly
above, choose a field name from the drop-down list.
✦Selecting all the fields in a table: In the unlikely event that you want all
the fields from a table to appear in the query results, either double-click
the asterisk (*) at the top of the list of field names or drag the asterisk
into the Design grid. Access places the name of the table followed by an
asterisk in the Field text box. The asterisk signifies that all the fields
from the table are included in the query.
To remove a field name from the Design grid, select it and press the Delete
key, or click the field name and then click the Delete Columns button in the
Query Setup group on the (Query Tools) Design tab.
Sorting the query results
At the start of this chapter, “Sorting Records in a Database Table” explains
what sorting is. The Sort row of the Design grid — directly underneath the
Table name — contains a drop-down list. To sort the query, click the drop-
down list in a field and choose Ascending or Descending to sort the results
Figure 4-6:
How query
fields
translate
into query
results.

Querying: The Basics
602
of a query on a particular field. To sort the results on more than one field,
make sure that the first field to be sorted appears to the left of the other
fields. Access reads the sort order from left to right.
You can move fields in the query grid by clicking the tiny gray box above the
field name and dragging the field to the left or right.
Choosing which fields appear in query results
Although you include a field in the Query grid, it isn’t always necessary to
display information from the field in the query results. Consider the Query
grid, as shown in Figure 4-7. The object of this query is to show the orders
shipped in 2006. Therefore, the Criteria cell of the Shipped Date field shows
the expression Between #1/1/2006# And #12/31/2006#. However, when you
generate the results, you might not want to see the Shipped Date field
because you’re just concerned with other information about the order.
Figure 4-7:
Choosing
what
appears in
the query
results.
Moving field columns on the Query grid
The order in which field names appear in the
Query grid is also the order in which they
appear in the query results (refer to Figure 4-6).
Follow these steps to move field columns to the
right order in the Query grid:
1. Click a column’s selector button to select a
column.
This button is the narrow gray box directly
above the field name. The pointer turns into
a down-pointing arrow when you move it
over the selector button.
2. After you select the column, click the
selector button again and drag the column
to the left or right.

Chapter 4

Querying: The Basics
603
When a field’s Show check box is selected, results from the field appear in
Query results. If a field is necessary for producing records in a query but not
necessary in the query results, deselect its Show check box. If you save and
reopen the query, Access moves deselected fields to the right side of the
Query grid (and you usually have to scroll to see them).
Entering criteria for a query
What separates a run-of-the-mill query from a supercharged query is a crite-
rion, an expression or value you enter on the Criteria line under a field. Enter
criteria on the Criteria line of the Query grid. By entering criteria, you can
pinpoint records in the database with great accuracy. In Figure 4-8, the Query
grid instructs Access to search orders taken in 2006 and shipped to New York
or California where the unit price is more than $50. Notice the word Or
between “NY” and “CA” in the criterion for the Ship State/Province field.
Using Or between multiple values allows you to see rows containing one of
those values. The query, as shown in Figure 4-8, retrieves rows for orders
shipped to either New York or California. Using Or between values is similar
to selecting multiple data values while filtering data, as I describe in
“Common filters” earlier in this chapter.
As Figure 4-8 shows, Access places double quotation marks (“”) around text
criteria and number signs (#) around date criteria. When you enter text or
date criteria, don’t enter the double quotation marks or number signs.
Access enters them for you.
When you need help writing an expression for a query, try clicking the Build
button to construct your query in the Expression Builder dialog box.
Entering numeric criteria
Enter numeric criteria in Number and Currency fields when you want to iso-
late records with specific values. Earlier in this chapter, Table 4-1 describes
comparison operators you can use for querying and filtering. These opera-
tors are invaluable when it comes to mining a database for information. Use
Figure 4-8:
Including
criteria in
a query.

Querying: The Basics
604
the greater than (>) and less than (<) operators to find values higher or
lower than a target value. Use the Between operator to find values between
two numbers. For example, Between 62 And 55 in a Currency field isolates
records with all items that sell for between $62.00 and $55.00.
Do not include commas in numbers when you enter them as criteria. For
example, enter 3200, not 3,200. Enter a comma and you get a “The expres-
sion you entered contains invalid syntax. . .” error message.
Entering text criteria
To enter a text criterion, type it in the Criteria text box. For example, to find
students who attended Ohio State University, enter Ohio State in the Criteria
text box of the University field. Access places double quotation marks (“”)
around the text you enter as soon when you move the pointer out of the
Criteria text box.
Wildcards and the Not operator can come in very handy when entering text
criteria:
✦Wildcards: Wildcards make it possible to query for data whose spelling
you aren’t quite sure of. (In Chapter 3 of this mini-book, Table 3-2
explains what the wildcard characters are and how to use them.) For
example, entering Sm?th in the Criteria box of the Last Name field finds
all Smiths and Smyths. Entering E* in the Company field finds all com-
pany names that begin with the letter E.
✦Not operator: Use the Not operator to exclude records from query
results. For example, to exclude records with Belgium in the Shipped To
field, enter Not Belgium in the Criteria text box. This is a great way to
strip unneeded records from a query.
Entering date criteria
All the operators that work for numeric data (see Table 4-1 earlier in this
chapter) also work for data entered in a Date field. For example, enter
>7/31/1958 in a Birth Date field to find all people born after (greater than)
July 31, 1958. Enter Between 1/1/1920 And 12/31/1929 to retrieve data about
people born in the Roaring Twenties.
Access places number signs (#) around date criteria after you enter it. You
can enter dates in these formats:
✦11/22/07
✦11/22/2007
✦22-Nov-07
✦November 22, 2007

Book VI
Chapter 4

Six Kinds of Queries
605
For the purpose of entering two-digit years in dates, the digits 30 through 99
belong to the 20th Century (1930–1999), but the digits 00 through 29 belong
to the 21st Century (2000–2029). For example, >4/1/24 refers to April 1, 2024,
not April 1, 1924. To enter a date in 1929 or earlier, enter four digits instead
of two to describe the year: >4/1/1929. To enter a date in 2030, or later, enter
four digits instead of two: >4/1/2038. To avoid any confusion, enter four-digit
years all the time. Make your application Y3K compliant now.
The Date() function can come in very handy when you want to retrieve data
relative to today’s date, whatever it happens to be. For example, to retrieve
purchase orders made between January 1, 2007, and today’s date, enter this
expression: Between 1/1/2007 And Date().
At last — saving and running a query
To save a query and inscribe its name forever in the Navigation pane, click
the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar and enter a descriptive name in
the Save As dialog box. The name you enter appears in the Queries group in
the Navigation pane.
After you laboriously construct your query, take it for a test drive. To run a
query:
✦Starting from the Query Design window: Click the Run button on the
(Query Tools) Design tab.
✦Starting from the Navigation pane: Double-click an existing query’s
name, or right-click its name and choose Open on the shortcut menu.
If the query doesn’t work the way you want it to, click the Design View button,
or right-click the Query window’s title bar and choose Design View on the
shortcut menu to return to the Query Design window and start tinkering.
Six Kinds of Queries
For your pleasure and entertainment, these pages describe six useful types
of queries. Access offers a handful of other queries, but I won’t go there.
Those queries are pretty complicated. If you become adept at querying,
however, you’re invited to look into the Help system for advice about run-
ning the query types that aren’t explained here.
Select query
A select query is the standard kind of query, which I explain earlier in this
chapter. A select query gathers information from one or more database tables
and displays the information in a datasheet. A select query is the most
common query, the primal query, the starting point for most other queries.

Six Kinds of Queries
606
Top-value query
A top-value query is an easy way to find out, in a Number or Currency field,
the highest or lowest values. On the Query grid, enter the name of the
Number or Currency field you want to know more about; then choose
Ascending in the Sort drop-down list to rank values from lowest to highest or
Descending in the Sort drop-down list to rank values from highest to lowest.
Finally, in the Return drop-down list in the Query Setup group on the (Query
Tools) Design tab, enter a value or choose a value from the drop-down list:
✦Highest or lowest by percentage: Enter or choose a percentage to find,
for example, the highest or lowest 25 percent of the values. To enter a per-
centage, type a percent sign (%) after your entry and press the Enter key.
✦Highest or lowest by ranking number: Enter or choose a number to
find, for example, the top-ten or lowest-ten values. Press the Enter key
after you enter a number.
This may seem counterintuitive, but to see the top values, you have to sort
the field you’re ranking in descending order. For example, if you sort employ-
ees by number of sales in descending order, the employees with the top
sales appear at the top. To see the bottom values, sort in ascending order.
Summary query
Similar to a top-value query, a summary query is a way of getting cumulative
information about all the data in a field. In a field that stores data about sales
in Kentucky, for example, you can find the average amount of each sale, the
total amount of all the sales, the total number of all the sales, and other data.
To run a summary query, click the Totals button in the Show/Hide group on
the (Query Tools) Design tab. A new row called Total appears on the Query
grid. Open the Total drop-down list in the field whose contents you want to
summarize and choose a function. Table 4-2 describes the functions.

✦Group By: This option lets you pick which fields to show totals for.
✦Expression: This option lets you create a calculated field.
✦Where: This option lets you set criteria, but it doesn’t include the field
in the query.
Calculation query
A calculation query is one in which calculations are performed as part of the
query. For example, you can calculate the sales tax on items sold or total the
numbers in two fields in the same record. The beauty of a calculation query
is that the data is recomputed each time you run the query. If the data used
to make a calculation changes, so does the result of the calculation. If you
were to include the calculation in a database table, you would have to recal-
culate the data yourself each time one of the values changed. With a calcula-
tion query, Access does the math for you.
To construct a calculation query, create a new field in the Query grid for
storing the results of the calculation; then enter a name for the field and a
formula for the calculation. Follow these steps to create a calculation query:
1. Create a query as you normally would and be sure to include the
fields you want to use for calculation purposes in the Query grid.
2. In the Field box of a blank field, enter a name for the Calculation field
and follow it with a colon.
In Figure 4-9, I enter SubTotal:. The purpose of the new SubTotal field is
to calculate the Unit Price × the Quantity.
3. After the colon, in square brackets ([]), enter the name of a field
whose data you use for the calculation.
In Figure 4-9, data from the Unit Price and Quantity fields are used in the
calculation, so their names appear in square brackets: [Unit Price] and
[Quantity]. Be sure to spell field names correctly so that Access can rec-
ognize them.

Six Kinds of Queries
608
4. Complete the calculation.
How you do this depends on what kind of calculation you’re making. In
Figure 4-9, I enter an asterisk (*) to multiply two fields together. The equa-
tion multiplies the values in the Unit Price and Quantity fields. You can
add the data from two different fields — including calculated fields — by
putting their names in brackets and joining them with a plus sign, like so:
[SubTotal]+[Shipping Cost].
Sometimes the results of the query aren’t formatted correctly on the
datasheet. To assign a new format to a field you create for the purposes of
making a calculation query, right-click the field on the Query grid and
choose Properties. The Property Sheet appears. On the General tab, click the
Format drop-down list and choose the correct format for your new, hand-
crafted field.
Delete query
Be careful about running delete queries. A delete query deletes records and
doesn’t give you the opportunity to get the records back if you change your
mind about deleting them. If used skillfully, however, a delete query is a
great way to purge records from more than one database table at once. Back
up your database file before running a delete query. Edith Piaf didn’t regret
her delete query, but you might regret yours.
To run a delete query, start a new query, and in Query Design view, click the
Delete button in the Query Type group on the (Query Tools) Design tab.
Then make as though you’re running a select query but target the records
you want to delete. Finally, click the Run button to run the query.

You can delete records from more than one table as long as the tables are
related and you chose the Cascade Delete Related Records option in the Edit
Relationships dialog box when you linked the tables. (See the section in
Chapter 2 of this mini-book about forging relationships between tables.)
To preview the records that will be deleted before you run the delete query,
click the Datasheet View button in the Results group on the (Query Tools)
Design tab. The delete query will only delete records when you click the Run
button. After clicking run, wave goodbye to that data.
Update query
An update query is a way to reach into a database and update records in sev-
eral different tables all at one time. Update queries can be invaluable, but as
with delete queries, they can have untoward consequences. Back up your
database before you run an update query; then follow these steps to run it:
1. Starting in Design view, click the Update command in the Query Type
group on the (Query Tools) Design tab.
A new line, Update To, appears on the Query grid.
2. Set up the query as you normally would and then click the View
button to see which records the query collects.
The records appear in Datasheet view. Take this step to make sure that
you’re updating the records correctly.
3. Click the View button again to return to Design view.
4. In the field with the data that needs updating, enter text or a value in
the Update To line. You can even enter another field name in square
brackets ([]).
What you enter in the Update To line replaces what’s in the field of the
records you collect.
5. Click the Run button.
To update records in more than one table, you must have chosen the
Cascade Update Related Fields option in the Edit Relationships dialog box
when you linked the tables. (See the section in Chapter 2 of this mini-book
about forging relationships between tables.)

Chapter 5: Presenting 
Data in a Report

 Creating a new report

T
he prettiest way to present data in a database table or query is to pres-
ent it in a report. Even people who are allergic to databases can put up
with database material in a report. Reports are easy to read and understand.
They succinctly present the data so that you and others can interpret it.
This brief chapter explains how to create reports, open them, and edit them.
Creating a Report
Access comes with all kinds of complicated tools for fashioning your own
report — for laying out the pages in different ways and making data fields
show up in different parts of the page. If ever a task called for relying on a
wizard, creating a report is it. You can save yourself a lot of trouble, and
fashion sophisticated-looking reports as well, by dispensing with the fancy
report-making tools and letting the wizard do the job.
What’s more, the easiest and best way to make a report is to base your
report on a query. As part of fashioning a report with a wizard, you can tell
Access which database tables and which fields to get the data from — in
other words, you can query your database from inside the Report Wizard.
However, doing that requires turning somersaults and cartwheels. It’s far
easier to run a query to produce the results you want in your report, save
your query, and then fashion a report from the query results. Chapter 4 in
this mini-book explains how to create a query.

Creating a Report
612
To create a report with the Report Wizard, start by clicking the Report
Wizard command in the Reports group on the Create tab. You see the first of
several Report Wizard dialog boxes. Negotiate the dialog boxes as follows,
clicking the Next button as you go along:
✦Tables/Queries: Open this drop-down list and choose the query where
the information in the report will come from. A list of fields in the query
appears in the Available Fields box.
✦Available Fields: Select the fields whose data you want in the report by
selecting the fields one at a time and clicking the > button. Doing so
moves field names to the Selected Fields box. Add all the fields by click-
ing the >> button.
✦How Do You Want to View Your Data?: Choose a field to define the
grouping level. A grouping level is like a report subheading. For example,
if you make Last Name the grouping level, information in the report is
presented under people’s last names.
✦Do You Want to Add Any Grouping Levels?: Include subheadings in
your report by selecting a field name and clicking the > button to make it
a subheading. If you’re building your report on a query that includes
related tables, the Report Wizard automatically adds subheadings.
✦What Sort Order Do You Want?: Select up to four fields to sort the data
in your report. Even if you sort the fields in a query, the report handles
sorting on its own. If you include grouping levels, the report already
sorts on these fields.
✦How Would You Like to Lay Out Your Report?: Experiment with the
options, and watch the Preview box, to choose a layout for your report.
If your report has a lot of fields, you may want to print it in Landscape
view.
✦What Style Would You Like?: Click the options to preview the different
designs and choose the one that makes you happiest. As shown in
Figure 5-1, this dialog box asks you to choose a design for your report.
(Later in this chapter, “Tweaking a Report” explains how to change
designs.)
✦What Title Do You Want for Your Report?: Enter a descriptive title. The
name you choose appears in the Reports group in the Navigation pane.
From there, you double-click the name when you want to see the report.
✦Preview the Report: Select this option button and click Finish. The
report appears in the Preview window. How do you like it?

Opening and Viewing Reports
If you’ve spent any time whatsoever in Access, you know the drill for opening
a so-called object. Follow these steps to open a report:
1. In the Navigation pane, click the Reports group.
You see the names of reports you created.
2. Double-click a report name or right-click a name and choose Open
from the shortcut menu.
The report appears in Report view. From here, you can apply filters to
the report in much the same way you do to a datasheet or a form.
Reports in Access 2007 are interactive. (Chapter 4 in this mini-book
explains how to apply a filter to a datasheet.)
3. Click the Office button and choose Print➪Print Preview.
The report appears in the Preview window. Experiment with the report’s
settings by changing the layout between Portrait and Landscape, view-
ing one or more pages at a time, and creating a PDF (portable document
format). Oh, I almost forgot, you can print the report, too; that’s why you
made it in the first place! Click the Close Print Preview command on the
Ribbon after you’re done playing around.
Tweaking a Report
As I mention at the start of this chapter, Access offers a bunch of complex
tools for changing the layout and appearance of a report. If you’re coura-
geous and have lots of time on your hands, you’re invited to take these tools
Figure 5-1:
Choosing a

in hand and go to it. In the Reports group of the Navigation pane, right-click
a report and choose Design View from the shortcut menu. You see your
report in the Report Design window, as shown in Figure 5-2. Have you ever
seen anything scarier?
I tell you how to create a report with the Report Wizard in order to avoid
your having to visit this imposing window. However, you can change a
report’s appearance in the Report Design window without going to very
much trouble if you follow these instructions:
✦Choosing a new design: If the design you choose in the Report Wizard
isn’t cutting it, click the AutoFormat command in the AutoFormat group
on the (Report Design Tools) Arrange tab. You see a drop-down list con-
taining the design formats that were also available in the Report Wizard.
Click the desired format to change the report’s design.
✦Removing the header and footer: Access places today’s date and page
numbers in the footer of reports. To remove these items, choose the
Page Header/Footer command in the Show/Hide group on the (Report
Design Tools) Arrange tab. Click Yes in the confirmation dialog box if
you want to remove these sections and all of the controls in these
sections.
✦Including page numbers: To include page numbers on the report, click
the Page Numbers command in the Controls group on the (Report
Design Tools) Design tab. You see the Page Numbers dialog box, as
shown in Figure 5-3. Choose the Page N option button to display a page
number only, or select the Page N of M option button to display a page
number as well as the total number of pages in the report (as in “Page 2
of 4”). Choose Alignment and Position options to describe where on the
page to put the page number. To remove a page number, scour the
Report Design window to find an =“Page” code and then delete it.

✦Changing the margins: Choose Margins on the (Report Design Tools)
Page Setup tab and select the new margins. Choose from Normal, Wide,
or Narrow margins. The values of the Top, Left, Bottom, and Right
margin values are shown in Figure 5-4. The Margins command is also
available from the Print Preview view.
Access offers many more options for setting up a report. Click the Layout
View button to switch the report to Layout view. From this view, you can
resize the columns, change the column heading and the report’s title, and
adjust fonts, colors, and sizes. You can also choose to add gridlines, adjust
the line thickness that appears, add additional fields, and adjust the spacing
between fields. The best part of Layout view is that you can do this while
viewing real live data.

An easier way to tweak a report — in Word
If you aren’t comfortable in the Report Design
window (who is?), try transferring your report
to Microsoft Word and editing it there. Click the
Word command in the Export group on the
External Data tab. Choose a destination and
filename, and then select the option to open the
file after the export operation is complete. In a
moment, your Access report appears in Word.
You can find the new Word file in the folder you
chose when creating the file. The file is an RTF
(rich text format file). To save it as a Word file,
click the Office button and then choose Save
As. In the Save As dialog box, name your file
and choose Word Document on the Save As
Type drop-down list. Books I and II describe
how to work with files in Word.

elcome to Publisher. Not so long ago, creating professional publica-
tions like the kind you can create with Publisher required sophisti-
cated printing equipment and a background in graphic design. However,
even a novice can now create professional-looking publications with
Publisher. As long as you rely on a publication design — a template that
comes with Publisher — most of the layout work is done for you. All you
have to do is enter the text and the other particulars.
“A Print Shop in a Can”
Publisher has been called “a print shop in a can” because the program is
great for creating prefabricated brochures, business cards, calendars,
newsletters, resumes, posters, and the like. To make these publications
without going to a great deal of trouble, however, you have to stick to the
publication designs. A publication design gives you the structure for creating
a brochure, calendar, and so on. Chances are you can find a suitable publica-
tion design for whatever kind of publication you want to create. Figure 1-1
shows some examples of the publication designs for creating flyers. The
designs include placeholders for graphics and text. To create a publication,
you choose a publication type, choose a design, enter graphics and text in
the publication design where the placeholders are, and tweak the publica-
tion to your liking.

Introducing Frames
620
Striking out on your own and designing publications like those in Figure 1-1
can be done, but you need a thorough knowledge of Publisher and a full
head of hair. You need the hair because much of it will have been pulled out
in frustration by the time you finish your design. I venture to say that the
people who invented Publisher expect everyone to work from ready-made
publication designs. Designing publications from scratch is simply too diffi-
cult. Don’t be discouraged, however, because you can almost always find a
publication design for whatever you want to communicate.
Introducing Frames
The publications that you make with Publisher are composed of frames. A
frame is a placeholder for text, a graphic, or a table. Complex publications
have dozens of frames; simple publications have only a few. Frames keep
text and graphics from overlapping. They make sure that everything stays
on the page where it should be. As you create a publication, you enter your
own text or graphics in frames.
The publication in Figure 1-2 is made up of several frames that are stitched
together to form a poster. On the left side of the figure, I selected the frames,
and you can see the frame boundaries; the right side of the figure shows
what the poster looks like after it is printed. Frames make laying out publica-
tions easier. When you want to move text, a picture, a table, or an image, you
Choose a publication type. Choose a design.

simply drag its frame to a new location. After you select a frame, the com-
mands you give apply to the text or graphic in the frame. Frames do not
appear in the finished product — they are meant strictly to help with the
laying out of text and graphics.
Creating a Publication
To create a new publication, choose File➪New (or press Ctrl+N). You see the
Welcome to Microsoft Office Publisher window (refer to Figure 1-1). Starting
here, you can create a publication in any number of ways. When you search
for a publication design, remember that you can click the Back and Forward
buttons in the upper-left corner of the dialog box to retrace your search.
Use one of these techniques to create a publication:
✦Select a publication design: Select a category under Publication Types,
or click the icon representing a popular publication type. You see a
dozen or more designs. Scroll through the list, select a design, and
double-click it or click the Create button in the lower-right corner of 
the window.
✦Search for a publication design at Microsoft: In the Search for
Templates text box, enter the name of a publication type, choose On
Microsoft Office Online on the drop-down list, and click the Search
button (the green arrow). Then select a publication design and double-
click it or click the Create button.
✦Use a template you created: If you create your own design templates,
you can use one to create a publication by clicking the My Templates
button and then double-clicking a template name.
Figure 1-2:

Redesigning a Publication
622
✦Start from another publication: You can create a new publication by
starting from one you’ve already designed. Select the publication’s name
in the Recent Publications list, or if the publication’s name isn’t listed,
click the From File link (you can find it at the top of the Recent Publications
list). In the Open Publication dialog box, locate the publication, select it,
and click the Open button. Then get to work changing around your pro-
totype publication to suit your purposes, but be sure to change its name
if you want to preserve the original publication from which it was made.
After you select a design in the Welcome to Microsoft Office Publisher
window (refer to Figure 1-1), you could choose a color scheme and font
scheme for your publication. But I suggest waiting until you’ve created your
publication before choosing colors and fonts. You can study your publica-
tion more closely after you create it. You can look through it and decide
what you want it to look like. What’s more, choosing new colors and fonts
for a publication is as easy as pie, as I explain very shortly.
If you prefer not to see the Welcome to Microsoft Office Publisher window
when you start Publisher, choose Tools➪Options, select the General tab in
the Options dialog box, and deselect the Show Publication Types When
Starting Publisher check box. Click OK.
Redesigning a Publication
Make your design choices carefully. In theory, you can change publication
designs, color schemes, and design options when you’re well along in a 
project, but in practice, changing these designs can have unforeseen conse-
quences. If you change the color of a headline, for example, and then choose
a new color scheme, the headline might be swallowed or rendered invisible
by a background color in the new scheme. If you enter a bunch of text, change
the size of a few frames, and then choose a new publication design, you may
turn your publication into corned-beef hash and have to start over.
To redesign a publication, choose Format➪Format Publication. The Format
Publication task pane appears, as shown in Figure 1-3. Starting at the Color
Schemes, Font Schemes, Options, or Page Options category, you can choose
colors, fonts, and even a different publication design. If your publication has
more than one page, click page number buttons at the bottom of the window
to visit different pages and see what they look like.
Choosing a different publication design
Not happy with the publication design you chose when you created your
publication? To exchange it for a new one, select the Publication Options
category in the Format Publication task pane (the category is named after

Book VII
Chapter 1
Introducing

623
the type of publication you’re working on). Then click the Change Template
button (see Figure 1-3). You return to see the Change Template window,
where you can select a different publication design.
Choosing a font scheme
You’ll be glad to know that most of the text formats that are available in
Word are also available in Publisher on the Standard toolbar and Format
menu. To boldface text, select it and click the Bold button. To change font
sizes, choose an option on the Font Size drop-down list.
To avoid going to the trouble of formatting text, you can choose a font scheme,
a pair of fonts for the headings and body text in a publication. Font schemes
spare you the trouble of having to format the text on your own. The schemes
were designed by people who know what they’re doing. They look good.
To choose a font scheme, select the Font Schemes category in the Format
Publication task pane (see Figure 1-3), and then select a scheme. If you really
know what you’re doing, you can click the Create New Font Scheme link and
select fonts for heading text and body text in the dialog box that appears.
And if you’re a Publisher aficionado, you can click the Styles link and assign
a font to different kinds of text — bulleted-list text, third- and fourth-level
headings, and other text — in the Styles pane.
Choosing a color scheme
To choose a color scheme, select the Color Schemes category in the Format
Publication task pane (refer to Figure 1-3) and then select a scheme. If you’re
daring, you can click the Create New Color Scheme link and fashion your
own color scheme in the Create New Color Scheme dialog box.

Getting Around in Publisher
624
Declaring the page size
Decide right away which page size to use for your publication. How large or
small the page is determines how the headings, graphics, and text fit on the
page. To declare the page size, select the Publication Options category in the
Format Publication task pane (the category is named after the type of publi-
cation you’re working on), scroll to the bottom of the task pane, and click
the Change Page Size button. Then select a page size in the Page Sizes window.
The bottom of the Publication Options category displays the page size you
choose.
Choosing other design options
The last important step in designing a publication is to consider the other
design options. These options vary depending on the kind of publication
you’re working on. When you’re working on a brochure, for example, you can
insert a sign-up form or space for a block quote. To examine the other design
options, select the Page Options category in the Format Publication task
pane. Select what Publisher calls an “object” to insert it on a page.
Getting Around in Publisher
The Publisher window can get kind of cluttered. In fact, the place has been
known to cause claustrophobia. These pages are meant to help you conquer
your fear of the Publisher window. They explain how to get from page to page
and, more important, change views of the publication you’re working on.
Zooming in and zooming out
As you create a publication, it’s important to see the little details as well as
the big picture; so Publisher offers special Zoom In and Zoom Out toolbar
buttons as well as the Zoom menu. Click a Zoom button to quickly peer at or
lean away from a document. You can also choose View➪Zoom and select one
of the intriguing options on the submenu. For example, select a frame and
choose View➪Zoom➪Selected Objects when you want to focus on a single
frame.
The View menu offers a command called View➪Two-Page Spread for seeing
facing pages in newsletters, brochures, and other publications with more
than one page. Choose this command early and often. It permits you to see
what readers of your publication will see when they view facing pages like
the ones in Figure 1-4.

Entering business information
Brochures, newsletters, letterheads, envelopes,
and a handful of other publication types include
what Publisher calls “business information.”
Publisher plugs this information — an individual
name, title, company name, address, phone
number, motto, and even a logo — into the pub-
lication. The information comes from the
Business Information dialog box. As long as the
information in this dialog box is up to date, you
needn’t be concerned whether the information
appears in the right places in a publication or
whether it’s accurate. And you don’t have to
enter the information directly into the publica-
tion you’re working on.
To enter business information, choose Edit➪
Business Information. You see the Create New
Business Information dialog box. Enter infor-
mation in this dialog box, choose a name for the
information, and click the Save button. The
information you enter will be plugged in to all
publications you create in the future, as well as
the publication you’re working on (if you click
the Update Information button).
If you need to edit the business information you
entered or create secondary information about
another business, choose Edit➪Business
Information, and in the Business Information
dialog box, click the Edit button. You see the
Edit Business Information Set dialog box,
where you can enter information about another
business and save it under a different name.
Notice the Select a Business Information Set
drop-down list in the Business Information
dialog box. Choose Edit➪Business Information
and select which business information set you
need for the publication you’re working on.
Publisher offers an unwieldy command for
quickly entering business information one tidbit
at a time: Select the frame where you want
information to appear and choose Insert➪
Business Information. You see the Business
Information task pane. Select an information
tidbit, open its drop-down list, and choose
Insert This Field. Then adjust the frame in which
the information appears (Chapter 2 of this mini-
book explains how).

Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
626
Hiding and displaying toolbars
Toolbars can make the Publisher window look cluttered. Lucky for you, you
can hide or display a toolbar in an instant with one of these techniques:
✦Choose View➪Toolbars and select the name of a toolbar.
✦Right-click any toolbar or the main menu and select a toolbar’s name.
Going from page to page
Use these techniques to get from page to page in a publication:
✦Click a page navigation button: In a publication with more than one
page, click a page navigation button to go to a different page. The but-
tons are located on the status bar along the bottom of the window.
✦The Go to Page dialog box: Choose Edit➪Go to Page (or press Ctrl+G)
and enter a page number in the Go to Page dialog box.
To help you identify pages, you can name them. When you move the pointer
over a page navigation button whose page has been given a name, the name
appears in a pop-up box. To name a page, right-click its navigation button on
the status bar and choose Rename on the shortcut menu. In the Rename
Page dialog box, enter a descriptive name.
Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
Making frames, graphics, and lines of text line up squarely on the page is
essential if your publication is to look smart and snappy. Readers tend to go
Figure 1-4:
A two-page
spread.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Introducing
Publisher
Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
627
cock-eyed when they see side-by-side columns with the text in one column
slightly askew of the text in the column beside it. A graphic or text frame
that spills onto the margin is a breach of etiquette punishable by death. A
row of graphics has to be just that — a row, not a crooked line.
As shown in Figure 1-5, Publisher offers a bunch of different tools for making
objects — frames and graphics — line up squarely. To wit, Publisher offers
the following tools:
✦Margin guides: Blue lines that clearly show where page margins begin
and end. Use the margin guides to make sure objects don’t stray too far
into the margin.
✦Grid guides: Blue lines that appear in grid form across the page. You can
decide how tight or loose to make the grid. Frames and objects can be
made to “snap to the grid.” Because the objects snap, you’re spared the
trouble of aligning them because they line up on grid guides.
✦Ruler guides: Green horizontal or vertical lines that you can place on
the page for assistance in aligning frames and objects. Frames and
objects can be made to “snap to” ruler guides, too. The ruler lines are
easy to place on and remove from the screen.
✦Baseline guides: Green horizontal and vertical lines that appear on the
page to help with aligning frames and objects. You can decide how many
baseline guides appear.

Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
628
Use these techniques to hide or display the guides:
✦Margin guides, grid guides, and ruler guides: Choose View➪
Boundaries and Guides (or press Ctrl+Shift+O).
✦Baseline guides: Choose View➪Baseline Guides, and then choose
Horizontal (or press Ctrl+F7) or Vertical (or press Ctrl+Shift+F7).
These commands make frames and objects “snap to” ruler guides or grid
guides: Arrange➪Snap➪To Ruler Marks and Arrange➪Snap➪To Guides
(press Ctrl+Shift+W). Snapping helps to make objects line up squarely.
Laying out the margin, grid, and baseline guides
Unless you create a new section (choose Insert➪Section), margin, grid, and
baseline guides apply to every page in a publication. Follow these steps to
tell Publisher how frequently to make guidelines appear on pages:
1. Choose Arrange➪Layout Guides.
You see the Layout Guides dialog box.
2. On the Margin Guides tab, enter measurements to determine how
wide to make the margins; on the Grid Guides tab, enter numbers 
to determine how many rows and columns form the grid; on the
Baseline Guides tab, enter measurements to determine how tight 
or loose the guides are.
The Preview box shows you precisely what your grid looks like and
where the margins are. Think carefully about entering a number less
than .2 in the Spacing boxes. If you enter 0, for example, object and
frames touch each other when they “snap to the grid.”
3. Click OK.
To remove grid guides, return to the Grid Guides tab of the Layout
Guides dialog box and enter 1 in the Columns text box and 1 in the Rows
text box.
Setting down ruler guides
Use a ruler guide to line up frames and other objects. Ruler guides can go
anywhere on the page. You can draw ruler guides where you need them and
remove the guides very easily when they get in the way. Whereas grid guides
appear on every page in a publication, ruler guides appear on one page. You
can, however, place the same ruler guide on every page by choosing View➪
Master Page and drawing the ruler guide on the master page.

Book VII
Chapter 1

629
Publisher offers three ways to draw ruler guides:
✦Ruler Guides commands: Choose Arrange➪Ruler Guides, and on the
submenu, choose Add Horizontal Ruler Guide or Add Vertical Ruler
Guide. A guide appears across the page. Drag it to a new location, if nec-
essary.
✦Ruler Guides dialog box: Choose Arrange➪Ruler Guides➪Format Ruler
Guides. In the Ruler Guides dialog box, enter horizontal or vertical meas-
urements for the guides and click OK.
Handling the Rulers
Rulers, when they aren’t coming in very handy,
get in the way. To hide or display rulers, choose
View➪Rulers.
For precision work, you can drag a ruler into the
middle of the window and use it as an aid for
lining up frames and other objects. Hold down
the Shift key, click a ruler, and drag it into the
middle of the window. To move it back where it
came from, Shift+drag all over again.

✦Removing ruler guides: Drag the guide off the page. To remove all
guides, choose Arrange➪Ruler Guides➪Clear All Ruler Guides.

his chapter picks up where the previous chapter left off. In Chapter 1 of
this mini-book, you discover how to create a publication, find your way
around the screen, and use the different guides. In this chapter, you explore
how to make a publication your own. This chapter offers speed techniques
for entering and editing text. It explains how to handle frames, make text
“flow” from frame to frame, and put graphics and other kinds of art in a 
publication. Bon voyage!
Entering Text on the Pages
The placeholder text that appears in publication designs has to go, of
course. One of your first tasks is to replace the generic text with your own
words. In the case of a newsletter story, you have a lot of writing to do.
(Story is the Publisher term for an article that reaches across several text
frames.) If you’re putting together a sign, you have only a handful of words
to write.
To select all the text in a frame or story, click in the frame and press Ctrl+A
(or choose Edit➪Select All). Here’s another trick that comes in handy when
you’re entering text: Click in the text and press F9 (or choose View➪Zoom➪
Selected Objects) to zoom in and display text at its actual size.
Publisher offers these techniques for handling large blocks of text:
✦Writing the text in Microsoft Word: Choose Edit➪Edit Story in
Microsoft Word. Microsoft Word opens, and you see the placeholder
text in its entirety. Delete the text and enter your own text. You can call

Making Text Fit in Text Frames
632
on all of the Word commands to edit the text. You can also copy text
from elsewhere into the Word document. When you’re finished writing,
click the Office button and choose Close & Return to Your Publication on
the drop-down list.
Notice that the placeholder text tells you roughly how many words fit
into the story. As you compose the story in Word, glance at the status
bar from time to time to see how many words are in the story and try to
keep to the number of words you’re allotted.
✦Inserting a text file: Delete the placeholder text and choose Insert➪Text
File. In the Insert Text dialog box, select a file and click OK.
The problem with the techniques just described is that files you work on in
Microsoft Word or import land in Publisher with their formats intact. If the
text is bold and 26 points high, it is bold and 26 points high in your publica-
tion despite the publication design you’ve chosen. To fix the problem, choose
Format➪Font Schemes and select a font scheme in the task pane.
Making Text Fit in Text Frames
One of the biggest challenges in a publication is making text fit in text frames.
What happens if the headline at the top of the story is too long to fit in the
frame? Suppose that a story in a newsletter is too long to fit in the text
frames allotted for the article by your publication design? These pages
explain how to make text fit elegantly in frames.
Handling “overflow” text
The Text in Overflow icon appears at the bottom of a text frame when text
doesn’t fit in the frame and needs to go elsewhere, as shown in Figure 2-1.
When you see this icon, it means that you must make decisions about how
to fit the heading or story into your publication.
If you’re dealing with a story that reaches across more than one frame, these
are your options for handling overflow text:
✦“Flow” text from frame to frame on your own: Direct the text from one
frame to another. See “Making text jump from frame to frame,” the next
section in this chapter.
✦Use the “autoflow” mechanism: Let Publisher suggest where to “flow”
the text. After you insert a long story, you see the Autoflow dialog box. By
clicking the Yes button in this dialog box, you can tell Publisher to pour
the story into different frames in the publication. I don’t recommend this
technique. Publisher merely picks the next available text frame without
regard to whether more than one story appears on the same page. Click
No in the Autoflow dialog box to flow the text on your own.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Refining a
Publication
Making Text Fit in Text Frames
633
If you’re dealing with a heading or paragraph that you want to fit in a single
frame, try one of these techniques for making the heading or paragraph fit:
✦Shrink the text automatically: Choose Format➪AutoFit Text➪Shrink
Text on Overflow. This command shrinks the point size of text so that all
text fits in the frame. Sometimes, however, shrinking the text this way
makes the heading or paragraph hard to read.
✦Edit the text: Snip out a word or sentence here and there to make the
text fit. Have you ever wondered why magazine articles always fill the
page and never end in the middle? That’s because skillful editors and
typesetters remove and add words here and there to make the story fit
the page.
✦Make the text frame larger: See “Changing the size and position of
frames” later in this chapter.
✦Make the text frame margins smaller: Like a page, text frames have
internal margins to keep text from getting too close to the frame border.
To shrink these margins and make more room for text, right-click the
text frame and choose Format Text Box. Then, on the Text Box tab of the
Format Text Box dialog box, enter smaller measurements for the text
box margins.
One way to handle large blocks of text that don’t fit text frames well is to try
out a Tracking command. Select the text (press Ctrl+A) and choose Format➪
Character Spacing. In the Character Spacing dialog box, choosing a Tracking
option — Normal, Very Tight, Loose, and so on — to shrink or enlarge the
text. The same tracking options are also available on the Measurement 
toolbar.

Making Text Fit in Text Frames

Making text jump from frame to frame
Follow these steps to direct text from frame to frame in a publication:
1. Select the text frame with overflowing text.
You can tell when text is overflowing because the Text in Overflow icon
appears at the bottom of the text frame (refer to Figure 2-1).
2. Click the Create Text Box Link button on the Connect Text Boxes 
toolbar.
If you don’t see this toolbar, right-click any toolbar and choose Connect
Text Boxes. The pointer turns into an overflowing pitcher — or is that a
beer stein? — after you click the button.
3. Move the pointer over the box that you want the text to flow into.
You may have to click a page navigation button to go to another page.
4. Click in the target text box to make the text flow there.
As I mention earlier, text frames linked this way are known as a story in
Publisher-speak. Here are techniques for handling text frames that are linked
in a story:
✦Going from text frame to text frame so that you can edit text: When
text travels from frame to frame, the Go to Previous Text Box and Go to
Next Text Box icons appear above and below the frames (refer to Figure
2-1). Click an icon to go to the previous or next frame in the chain. You
may also click the Previous Text Box or Next Text Box button on the
Connect Text Boxes toolbar.
✦Selecting the text in all the text frames: Press Ctrl+A or choose Edit➪
Select All.
✦Breaking the link between frames: Select the frame that you want to be
the last one in the chain and click the Break Forward Link button on the
Connect Text Boxes toolbar.
In a crowded publication, it’s easy to overlook a text frame with overflowing
text. To find these text frames, choose Tools➪Design Checker. Then, in the
Design Checker task pane, look for “Story with Text in Overflow Area.”
Filling out a text frame
The opposite of an “overflow” problem is a text frame with too much blank
space. Here are some techniques for handling vacant text frames:
✦Use an AutoFit Text option to fill the frame: Choose Format➪AutoFit
Text➪Best Fit. This command enlarges the text so that it fills the frame.
Sometimes, however, the command makes text too big.

Making Text Wrap Around a Frame or Graphic
635
✦Edit the text: Add a word or sentence here or there. In the case of head-
ings, write a subheading as well.
✦Insert a graphic or Design Gallery object: Placing a small graphic or
Design Gallery object makes the page livelier and fills the dead space.
See “Inserting a new frame” later in this chapter.
Making Text Wrap Around a Frame or Graphic
Wrap text around a frame, clip-art image, picture, or WordArt image and 
you get a very elegant layout. Figure 2-2 shows text that has been wrapped
around a clip art image. Looks nice, doesn’t it? Wrapping text may be the
easiest way to impress innocent bystanders with your layout prowess. As
Figure 2-2 shows, text wrapped tightly follows the contours of the picture,
whereas text wrapped squarely runs flush with the picture’s frame.
Here are shorthand instructions for wrapping text:
1. Select the item that text is to wrap around.
In Figure 2-2, you would select the clip-art image.
Figure 2-2:
Text
wrapped
tightly (left)
and
squarely
(right).
Continuation slugs
A continuation slug is a notice that tells the
reader where to turn to continue reading an
article or where an article is continued from.
Publisher offers a nifty command for entering
continuation slugs at the bottom or top of text
frames:
1. Right-click the text frame that needs a slug
and choose Format Text Box.
2. On the Text Box tab of the Format Text Box
dialog box, select the Include “Continued
on Page” or Include “Continued from Page”
check box and click OK.

Replacing the Placeholder Graphics
636
2. Display the Picture toolbar, click the Text Wrapping button on the
toolbar, and choose a wrapping option on the drop-down list.
For Figure 2-2, I chose Tight for the picture on the left and Square for 
the picture on the right. As the figure shows, you can drag the Text
Wrapping drop-down list away from the toolbar and make the Text
Wrapping toolbar appear. Clicking the buttons on the toolbar makes 
it easier to experiment with wrapping options.
Replacing the Placeholder Graphics
As you might have noticed, publication designs are littered with generic clip-
art images and graphics. Besides writing your own words where the generic
ones are, replace the generic graphics with graphics of your own. Well, do it
if you please. You’re welcome to pass off the generic pictures as your own. I
won’t tell anybody.
Follow these steps to put a graphic where a placeholder graphic is now:
1. Right-click the picture and choose Change Picture.
2. On the submenu, choose what kind of picture you want to import.
What happens next depends on what kind of picture you’re dealing with.
Book VIII, Chapter 3 describes how to handle graphics in all Office pro-
grams. You’ll be delighted to discover that graphics are handled the
same way, no matter which program you’re toiling in.
The next section in this chapter explains how to put a graphic on the page
without the benefit of a placeholder graphic.
Inserting Frames on the Pages
Publications are made of frames — text frames, table frames, WordArt
frames, picture frames, and Design Gallery frames. Nothing appears on the
pages of a publication unless it appears within the confines of a frame. These
pages explain everything you need to know about frames. You can find out
how to insert a new frame, adjust the size of a frame, align frames, and place
borders around frames. You can also see how to make frames and the words
or images inside them overlap.
Inserting a new frame
To insert a new frame, click one of the six frame tool buttons — Text Box,
Draw Vertical Text Box, Insert Table, Insert WordArt, Picture Frame, or

Book VII
Chapter 2

Inserting Frames on the Pages
637
Design Gallery Object — on the Objects toolbar, click in your publication,
and drag. As you drag, you form a rectangle. Release the mouse button when
the frame is the right size. (The next section in this chapter explains how to
adjust the size and position of a frame.) Do the following to create a text-box
(or vertical-text-box), table, WordArt, picture, or clip-art frame:
✦Text frame for paragraphs, headings, and stories: Click in the frame
and start typing. Earlier in this chapter, “Entering Text on the Pages”
offers speed techniques for entering text. By clicking the Draw Vertical
Text Box button, you can enter text that reads sideways.
✦Table frame for tables: You see the Create Table dialog box, as shown in
Figure 2-3. Choose the number of rows and columns you want, and in the
Table Format list, select a layout for your table.
✦WordArt frame for WordArt images: The WordArt Gallery dialog box
opens when you create a WordArt frame. Select an image and click OK.
✦Picture frame for clip art: Click the Picture Frame button and choose
Clip Art on the drop-down list. In the Clip Art task pane, find and select
a clip-art image. Book VIII, Chapter 4 explains clip art.
✦Picture frame for art from a file: Click the Picture Frame button and
choose Picture from File on the drop-down list. The mouse pointer
changes to a cross-hair. After you drag to form the picture frame, the
Insert Picture dialog box appears so that you can choose a picture.
To delete a frame, all you have to do is select it and press the Delete key. You
can tell when a frame is selected because round selection handles appear on
the corners and sides.
Changing the size and position of frames
After you click a frame and see the selection handles, you’re ready to change
the size of the frame or adjust its position on the page. Use these standard
techniques for resizing and moving frames:
Figure 2-3:
Inserting 
a table.

Making Frames Overlap
638
✦Changing the size of a frame: Move the pointer over a round selection
handle and start dragging. If you’re dealing with anything but a text
frame, be careful about dragging a selection handle on the side of the
frame. Dragging a side handle changes the frame’s size as well as its pro-
portions. Images can blur or become distorted when you change their
proportions.
✦Changing the position of a frame: Move the pointer onto the frame (or
the perimeter of a frame if you’re dealing with a text box), and click and
drag when you see the four-headed arrow. To move more than one frame
simultaneously, Ctrl+click the frames you want to move.
As I explain in Chapter 1 of this mini-book, frames snap to the grid as you
move them, but you can hold down the Alt key as you drag to adjust frames
with precision. You can also choose Arrange➪Nudge and choose Up, Down,
Left, or Right on the submenu to move a frame ever so slightly.
Making Frames Overlap
When frames overlap, you have to tell Publisher which frame goes in front of
the other. And you are hereby invited to overlap frames because overlapping
frames are artful and look good on the page. Figure 2-4 shows a portion of a
newsletter. If you look closely, you can see where frames overlap in the
figure. Overlapping frames like these make for a sophisticated layout.
Making frames overlap like the ones in Figure 2-4 requires a delicate balanc-
ing act using these commands:
✦Text wrapping: Wrapping must be turned off for frames to overlap.
Select the frames, click the Text Wrapping button on the Picture toolbar,
and choose None on the drop-down list.
✦Fill Color: For frames and objects on the bottom of the stack to show
through, the frames and objects above them cannot have a fill color that
would obscure other objects. To remove the fill color, select the object,
Order toolbar

Book VII
Chapter 2

open the Fill Color drop-down list on the Formatting toolbar, and choose
No Fill.
✦Object and frame order: To tell Publisher which object goes where in
the stack, right-click each object in turn, choose Order on the shortcut
menu, and choose an option on the submenu. As Figure 2-4 shows, you
can drag this submenu onto the screen and thereby have the Order tool-
bar at your command. Click buttons on the toolbar until objects are in
the right order in the stack.
Inserting, Removing, and Moving Pages
Suppose that you have too many pages or you need to add a page or two.
Follow these instructions to insert, remove, or move a page:
✦Inserting a new page: Click a page navigation button to move to the
page where you want to insert pages; then choose Insert➪Page or press
Ctrl+Shift+N. In the Insert Page dialog box, enter the number of pages
you want to insert and click an option button to put the new pages
before or after the page you’re on. Then, under Options, choose an
option to tell Publisher what to put on the new page or pages and 
click OK.
✦Removing a page: Go to the page you want to remove and choose Edit➪
Delete Page.
✦Moving a page: Go to the page you want to move and choose Edit➪
Move Page. Give instructions for moving the page in the Move Page
dialog box and click OK.

T
his final chapter in Book VII is devoted to the Project to Beautify
Publications, a joint effort of the Dummies Press and the author to try to
make publications less bland and more original. The author has noticed, on
the bulletin boards and lampposts in his neighborhood, that the rummage
sale and lost pet notices look a little rough around the edges. The neighbors
are using sophisticated software to produce their notices, but they’re not
using it well. They’re relying solely on templates, which make the publications
look alike. These pages explain a few simple tricks for making publications
more sophisticated.
This chapter explores drop caps and horizontal rules, page backgrounds
and borders, borders and backgrounds for frames, and how to place a logo
in the same place on each page in a publication. It shows you Publisher’s
excellent Design Checker and Graphics Checker. Finally, this chapter offers
advice for printing publications at a commercial print shop.
Decorating the Text
Herewith are a couple of tricks to amaze your friends and frighten your ene-
mies. These pages explain how horizontal rules and drop caps can make a
publication a little livelier. Don’t worry — horizontal rules have nothing to
do with which side of the bed to sleep on, and drop caps don’t explode
when you unroll them on the sidewalk and strike them with a hammer.

Decorating the Text
642
Drawing a horizontal rule
A horizontal rule is a horizontal line that divides one part of a page from
another and directs the reader’s eye on the page. There are four horizontal
rules in Figure 3-1. By varying the width of the lines — the width is known as
the weight — and placing lines in strategic places, you can make a publica-
tion look more elegant and graceful. How you draw a horizontal rule depends
on whether you want to draw it above or below a frame, or above or below a
text paragraph. The horizontal rules in Figure 3-1 appear above and below
frames. Rules appear between paragraphs to mark an abrupt transition
between paragraphs. In a mystery story, for example, the horizontal rule
appears right after the murderer gets away.
Usually where horizontal rules come in pairs, the bottommost rule is thicker
than its twin. The thicker bottom line encourages the reader’s eye to move
down the page and find an article to read.
A horizontal rule on a frame
Follow these steps to draw a horizontal rule on a frame:
1. Select the frame, right-click it, and choose Format.
The Format command has different names depending on what type of
frame or object you are working with. You see the Format dialog box.
2. Select the Color and Lines tab.
3. In the Preview box, click the top of the box to draw a rule above the
frame or the bottom of the box to draw a rule below.
Figure 3-1:
Examples of
horizontal
rules.

643
By clicking part of the Preview box, you tell Publisher where you want to
draw the rule.
4. On the Color menu, choose a line color for the horizontal rule.
5. On the Style menu, choose the kind of line you want.
If you want a dashed line, choose it from the Dashed drop-down list. You
can adjust the thickness of the line in the Weight text box, if necessary.
6. To draw a second rule on the frame, click again in the Preview box
and repeat Steps 4 and 5.
7. Click OK.
To remove a horizontal rule on a frame, select the frame, open the Format
dialog box, and choose No Line on the Color drop-down list.
A horizontal rule on a paragraph
Follow these instructions to draw a horizontal rule above or below a paragraph:
1. Click in the paragraph and choose Format➪Horizontal Rules.
You see the Horizontal Rules dialog box.
2. Select the Rule before Paragraph or Rule after Paragraph check box,
or both check boxes if you want to draw two horizontal rules.
3. Choose options to describe the thickness, color, and style of the line
you want.
Lines extend from margin to margin or column to column, but you can
shorten the lines by entering measurements in the From Left Margin and
From Right Margin text boxes.
To put more distance between the rule and paragraph text, enter a meas-
urement in the Before Paragraph or After Paragraph text box.
4. Click OK.
To remove horizontal rules from a paragraph, click the paragraph,
choose Format➪Horizontal Rules, and remove the check marks from the
Rule before Paragraph and Rule after Paragraph check boxes.
Dropping in a drop cap
A drop cap is a large capital letter that “drops” into the text. Drop caps are
usually found in the first paragraph of an article or chapter. Pound for pound,
considering how little effort is required, a drop cap yields the most reward
for the least amount of work. Follow these steps to place a drop cap in a 
publication:

Techniques for Decorating Pages
644
1. Click the paragraph that is to receive the drop cap and choose Format➪
Drop Cap.
You see the Drop Cap dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2.
2. Select one of the drop caps and click OK.
If the drop caps on the Drop Cap tab don’t do the trick, visit the Custom
Drop Cap tab, where you can choose how far to drop the capital letter or
select a font for the letter. To remove a drop cap, return to the Drop Cap
dialog box and choose the first option.
Techniques for Decorating Pages
No one likes a dull publication. Following are some simple techniques to
make pages a little bit livelier. Read on to find out how to put borders and
color backgrounds on frames. You also find instructions for painting an
entire page with a background color or gray shade.
Putting borders and color backgrounds on frames
As shown in Figure 3-3, putting borders and background colors on text
frames makes the frames stand out. Everybody knows what a border is.
A background color is a color or gray shade that fills a frame. Borders and
background colors are ideal for calling readers’ attention to important notices
and items in publications. To really get readers’ attention, for example, try
using black for the background and white for the font color.

Techniques for Decorating Pages
645
Select a frame and follow these instructions to give it background color or a
border:
✦Background color: Open the drop-down list on the Fill Color button and
choose a color. Choose No Fill to remove the background color or to
create no background color so that frames below the frame you’re deal-
ing with can show through.
✦Color for the border: Open the drop-down list on the Line Color button
and choose a color.
✦Line or dashed-line border: Click the Line/Border Style button and
choose a line. Or choose More Lines to open the Format dialog box and
choose from many different lines or to put a border on only one, two, or
three sides of the frame. (Earlier in this chapter, “Drawing a horizontal
rule” explains how to draw a border on different sides of a frame.)
Instead of clicking buttons on the Formatting toolbar, you can handle bor-
ders and backgrounds in the Format dialog box. Right-click a frame and
choose Format on the shortcut menu to open this dialog box. The Colors
and Lines tab offers all kinds of commands for borders and backgrounds.
Backgrounds for pages
Yet another nifty trick is to put a color or gray-shade background on the
page. Be sure to choose a light color or gray shade that doesn’t get in the
way of your publication or render it impossible to read. Shrink the publica-
tion to 33 percent so that you can see what backgrounds really look like;
then follow these steps to give your publication pages a background:
1. Choose Format➪Background.
The Background task pane opens, as shown in Figure 3-4.
2. Experiment with the Tint buttons and Color choices until you find a
suitable background.
To remove the background color, return to the Background task pane
and select No Fill, the first Color choice.

The Master Page for Handling Page Backgrounds
646
The Master Page for Handling Page Backgrounds
In a publication with many pages, the same object sometimes goes on every
page. A company logo on the corner of each page looks mighty elegant. Page
numbers and copyright information are also found on all the pages of some
publications. The good news is that you don’t have to place the objects on
each page individually. Instead, you can place the objects on the master
page. Objects on the master page show up on every page.
To open the master page, choose View➪Master Page (or press Ctrl+M). You
switch to Master view. Place objects and frames on the master page as if you
were putting them on run-of-the-mill pages. You can tell when you’re looking
at a master page because the page navigation buttons show letters instead
of numbers.
In a publication with facing pages, creating two master pages, one for the
left-facing pages and another for the right-facing pages, is convenient. To
create a second master page, choose Arrange➪Layout Guides, and in the
Layout Guides dialog box, choose Two-Page Master. The original master
becomes the master page for right-facing pages, the new master page becomes
the one for left-facing pages, and Publisher copies everything on the original
master page (right) to the second master page (left).
Choose a tint.
Choose a background.
Apply to one or all of the pages.

647
When background objects on the master page get in the way, choose View➪
Ignore Master Page to prevent them from appearing on-screen. Click the
Close Master View button on the Edit Master Pages toolbar when you’re 
finished with master pages.
Taking Advantage of the Design Gallery
The Design Gallery is a collection of objects — logos, pull quotes, accent
boxes, and thingamajigs — that you can throw into your publications.
Figure 3-5 shows some examples of Design Gallery objects. They are great for
filling blank spaces in a publication. After you’ve placed the object, you can
change its size or shift its position by using the same techniques you use
with other objects.
To insert a Design Gallery object, click the Design Gallery Object button on
the Objects toolbar or choose Insert➪Design Gallery Object. You see the
Design Gallery dialog box. Select an object that tickles your fancy — there
are about 250 objects in 22 categories — and click the Insert Object button.
Running the Design Checker
When at last your publication is ready for printing, be sure to run the Design
Checker. This helpful tool can alert you to frames that fall on nonprinting
parts of the page, stories that “overflow” without finding a text frame to go
to, invisible objects, and a host of other problems.
Choose Tools➪Design Checker to run the Design Checker. As shown in
Figure 3-6, the Design Checker task pane opens and lists items that need
your attention. Open an item’s drop-down list and choose Go to This Item to
locate it in your publication. Sometimes the drop-down lists offer quick fixes
as well.

Commercially Printing a Publication
648
To see which design flaws the Design Checker looks for, click the Design
Checker Options hyperlink in the Design Checker task pane. Then, in the
Design Checker Options dialog box, select the Checks tab and read the list.
Commercially Printing a Publication
You know the routine for printing a publication on your computer: Click 
the Print button; or choose File➪Print, negotiate the Print dialog box, and
click OK.
Sending a publication to a commercial printer is a different story. Commercial
printers either print with process colors (also known as CMYK) or spot colors.
To put it simply, process colors are made by mixing cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black to make colors, whereas spot colors are premixed before printing
begins. Before you hand over your publication to a commercial printer, find
out which color system the printer prefers. It costs more to print with process
colors than spot colors because process-color printing requires each color to
be created on a different color plate. Process colors, however, produce color
photographs much better than spot colors do.
Follow these steps to convert the colors in your publication to the color
system that the commercial printer prefers:
1. Choose Tools➪Commercial Printing Tools➪Color Printing.
You see the Color Printing dialog box.
Figure 3-6:
Running the
Design

Book VII
Chapter 3

649
2. Under Define All Colors As, choose Spot Colors or Process Colors
(CMYK).
3. Click OK.
Publisher also offers the Pack and Go command for copying large files onto
CDs and embedding fonts in the file. Whereas normally Publisher calls upon
instructions from the computer to display fonts, embedding fonts make
those instructions part of the file itself. These fonts display the same on all
computers — including the computer your printer uses. Embedding fonts,
however, makes files grow bigger.
To use the Pack and Go command, choose File➪Pack and Go➪Take to a
Commercial Printing Service. The Pack and Go dialog box appears. Keep
clicking Next and following the directions in the dialog box until your 
publication is “packed and gone.”

In This Chapter
 Changing around the Quick Access toolbar
 Choosing what appears on the status bar
 Choosing a new color scheme
 Changing the keyboard shortcuts in Word
 Deciding what to do about Smart Tags
T
his short chapter describes a handful of things you can do to customize
Office 2007 programs. Don’t be afraid to make like a software developer
and change a program to your liking. Many people are wary of retooling
Office programs, but you can always reverse the changes you make if you
don’t like them, as I explain throughout this chapter.
This chapter shows how to put your favorite button commands on the
Quick Access toolbar. Instead of fishing around for your favorite commands,
you can assemble them on the Quick Access toolbar and locate them right
away. You also discover how to change around the status bar, dress up an
Office program in a new set of clothes, designate your own keyboard short-
cuts in Word, and handle Smart Tags, the data snippets that sometimes get
mysteriously underlined in Office files.
Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar
No matter where you go in Word, Access, Excel, or PowerPoint, you see the
Quick Access toolbar in the upper-left corner of the screen. This toolbar
offers the Save, Undo, and Repeat buttons (and sometimes other buttons 
as well). However, which buttons appear on the Quick Access toolbar is
entirely up to you. You can put your favorite buttons on the toolbar and
keep them within reach. And if the Quick Access toolbar gets too big, you
can move it below the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 1-1. Adding buttons to and
removing buttons from the Quick Access toolbar is, I’m happy to report, a
piece of cake. And moving the toolbar below the Ribbon is as easy as pie.

Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar
654
Adding buttons to the Quick Access toolbar
Use one of these techniques to add buttons to the Quick Access toolbar:
✦Right-click a button you want to see on the toolbar and choose Add to
Quick Access Toolbar on the shortcut menu (see Figure 1-1).
✦Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button and choose a button
on the drop-down list. The list offers buttons deemed most likely to be
placed on the Quick Access toolbar by the makers of Office.
✦Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button and choose More
Commands (or right-click any button or tab and choose Customize
Quick Access Toolbar on the shortcut menu). You see the Customize 
category of the Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-2. On the
Choose Commands From drop-down list, choose the name of the tab
with the button you want to add to the Quick Access toolbar. Then
select the button’s name and click the Add button.
Select a tab.
Select a button and click Add.

Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar
655
To restore the Quick Access toolbar to its original buttons, click the Reset
button in the Options dialog box (see Figure 1-2).
Unless you declare otherwise, changes you make to the Quick Access tool-
bar apply to all the files you work on. You can, however, construct a toolbar
for one file only. To alter the Quick Access toolbar for one file, go to the
Customize category of the Options dialog box (see Figure 1-2), open the
Customize Quick Access Toolbar drop-down list, choose the name of your
file, and then start altering the toolbar.
Changing the order of buttons 
on the Quick Access toolbar
Follow these steps to change the order of buttons on the Quick Access 
toolbar:
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button and choose More
Commands on the drop-down list.
The Customize category of the Options dialog box appears (see Figure 1-2).
You can also open this dialog box by right-clicking any button or tab and
choosing Customize Quick Access Toolbar.
2. Select the name of a button on the right side of the dialog box and
click the Move Up or Move Down button.
3. Repeat Step 2 until the buttons are in the right order.
4. Click OK.
Removing buttons from the Quick Access toolbar
Use one of these techniques to remove buttons from the Quick Access 
toolbar:
✦Right-click a button and choose Remove from Quick Access Toolbar on
the shortcut menu.
✦Right-click any button or tab and choose Customize Quick Access
Toolbar. You see the Customize category of the Options dialog box (refer
to Figure 1-2). Select the button you want to remove on the right side of
the dialog box and click the Remove button.
You can click the Reset button in the Options dialog box (refer to Figure 1-2)
to remove all the buttons you placed on the Quick Access toolbar.

Customizing the Status Bar
656
Placing the Quick Access toolbar 
above or below the Ribbon
The Ribbon is the stretch of ground along the top of the screen where the
tabs and buttons are found. If your Quick Access toolbar contains many but-
tons, consider placing it below the Ribbon, not above it (refer to Figure 1-1).
Follow these instructions to place the Quick Access toolbar above or below
the Ribbon:
✦Quick Access toolbar below the Ribbon: Right-click the toolbar, and on
the shortcut menu, choose Show Quick Access Toolbar below the Ribbon.
✦Quick Access toolbar above the Ribbon: Right-click the toolbar, and on
the shortcut menu, choose Show Quick Access Toolbar above the Ribbon.
The Options dialog box offers a check box called Place Quick Access Toolbar
below the Ribbon (refer to Figure 1-2). You can select this check box as well
to move the toolbar above the Ribbon.
Customizing the Status Bar
The status bar along the bottom of the window gives you information about
the file you’re working on. The Word status bar, for example, tells you which
page you’re on, how many pages are in your document, and several other
things. In PowerPoint, the status bar tells you which slide you’re looking at
and the theme you chose for your presentation. It also presents the view
buttons and zoom controls.
To choose what appears on the status bar in Word, PowerPoint, Access, or
Excel, right-click the status bar. You see a pop-up list similar to the one in
Figure 1-3. By selecting and deselecting items in this list, you can decide
what appears on the status bar.

Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts in Word
In Microsoft Word, you can change the keyboard shortcuts. A keyboard short-
cut is a combination of keys that you press to give a command. For example,
pressing Ctrl+P opens the Print dialog box; pressing Ctrl+S gives the Save
command. If you don’t like a keyboard shortcut in Word, you can change it

If you try to assign a shortcut that’s already assigned, the words “Currently
assigned to” and a command name appear below the Current Keys box.
You can override the preassigned keyboard assignment by entering a
keyboard assignment of your own.
7. If you want the keyboard shortcut changes you make to apply to the
document you’re working on, not to all documents created with the
template you’re working with, open the Save Changes In drop-down
list and choose your document’s name.
8. Click the Assign button.
9. When you’re done, close the Customize Keyboard dialog box.
To delete a keyboard shortcut, display it in the Current Keys box, select it,
and click the Remove button.
You can always get the old keyboard shortcuts back by clicking the Reset All
button in the Customize Keyboard dialog box.
Smart Tags, Smart Alecks
A Smart Tag is a snippet of data that Office programs recognize as a date, an
address, a company ticker name, a place, a telephone number, or a person to
whom you recently sent e-mail. If the program recognizes one of these enti-
ties, it places a purple dotted line underneath the data. Move the pointer
over the purple dotted line and you see the Smart Tag icon. Click this icon
and you see a shortcut menu with tasks, as shown in Figure 1-6.
Not everyone likes Smart Tags, however. Follow these steps to turn them off
or otherwise tell Office which ones to recognize:
1. Click the Office button.
2. Choose Options on the drop-down list.
3. Select the Proofing category of the Options dialog box, and click the
AutoCorrect Options button.

his chapter explains how to distribute your work to co-workers and
friends. You’ll be glad to know that people who don’t have Office 2007
can still read and review an Office 2007 file you created. You can print it for
them, save it so it can be read in Adobe Acrobat Reader, or save it as a Web
page. This chapter explains all that as well as how to send a file right away
by e-mail and write and post blog entries from inside Word.
By the way, this book explains other ways to distribute your work. Book IV,
Chapter 5 demonstrates how to provide audience handouts for PowerPoint
presentations and ship presentations on CDs; Chapter 6 of this mini-book
looks at how to trade files with SharePoint Services.
Printing — the Old Standby
In spite of predictions to the contrary, the paperless office is still a pipe
dream. The day when Johnny at his computer is completely digitized and
communicating with his colleagues without having to print anything on
paper has yet to materialize. As for Jane, she can hardly go a day without
printing reports, spreadsheets, and brochures. The office is still awash in
paper, and all Jane and Johnny can do for consolation is try their best to
recycle.
I describe the details of printing files elsewhere in this book, but here are
the bare outlines of printing:
✦Printing right away: Click the Office button and choose Print➪Quick
Print. The file you want to print goes straight to the printer.

Distributing a File in PDF Format
662
✦Going first to the Print dialog box: Press Ctrl+P or click the Office button
and choose Print➪Print to open the Print dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-1.
From there, you can select a printer, choose how many copies to print,
choose which parts of a file to print, and plump for other printing options.
✦Previewing before you print: Click the Office button and choose
Print➪Print Preview. (Except in Word, you can also click the Preview
button in the Print dialog box.) You see the Print Preview tab, as shown
in Figure 2-1. The tab shows what your file looks like when you print it.
You can tinker with your file before you print it on the Print Preview tab.
Distributing a File in PDF Format
As shown in Figure 2-2, you can save and distribute a file in the PDF (Portable
Document File) format if the person to whom you want to give the file doesn’t
have the program with which it was created. For example, someone who
doesn’t have Excel can still view your Excel file in PDF format. Moreover, you
can post PDF files on the Internet so others can view them there.
PDF files are designed to be viewed and printed in a program called Adobe
Acrobat Reader. This program is very good at acquiring data from other pro-
grams and presenting it so it can be read and printed easily. Nearly every
computer has Adobe Acrobat Reader. If someone to whom you sent a PDF
file doesn’t have the program, they can download it for free at this Web page:

Sending Your File in an E-Mail Message
663
To save an Office file as a PDF, you need a special add-in program from the
Microsoft Web site. After you download and install the add-in, you can save
files in the PDF format by clicking the Office button and choosing Save As➪PDF.
To acquire the add@@hyin, go to the Microsoft Download Center at www.
microsoft.com/downloads. Then, in the Search box, enter Save as PDF
and click the Go button.
Sending Your File in an E-Mail Message
As long as you handle your e-mail with Outlook 2007, you can send the file
you’re working on to a friend or co-worker without having to open Outlook
2007. You simply choose a command and send the thing over the Internet.
Follow these steps to send the file you’re working on to a friend or co-worker:
1. Click the Office button.
2. Choose Send➪Email.
An Outlook 2007 message window appears with the name of your file on
the subject line and the file itself in the Attach box. Your presentation is
ready to send along with the e-mail message.
3. Enter the recipient’s address in the To box and a message in the
Message box.
Book III, Chapter 3 explains how to address, compose, and send e-mail
messages.

That was fast! It was faster than opening Outlook and attaching the file
to the e-mail message on your own.
Saving an Office File as a Web Page
Figure 2-3 shows what an Excel file looks like after it is saved as a Web page
and displayed in a Web browser. Looks like a normal Excel worksheet, doesn’t
it? Anyone with a Web browser can view a worksheet or other Office file after
it’s saved as a Web page. Save an Office file as a Web page and post it on the
Internet or an intranet so that others who don’t have Office can view it.
These pages explain the different ways to save an Office file as a Web page,
as well as how to save your Office file as a Web page and open a Web page
you created in a Web browser.
Choosing how to save the component parts
When you save an Office file as a Web page, you have the choice of saving it
as a Single File Web Page (.mht, .mhtml) or Web Page (.htm, .html).
✦Single File Web Page (.mht, .mhtml): All component parts of the file —
graphics, separate pages, and sounds, for example — are bundled into a
Figure 2-3:
Viewing an
Excel
worksheet

browser.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Ways of Distributing

Saving an Office File as a Web Page
665
single file. Keeping all the component parts in one file makes moving,
copying, and sending the file easier. However, some browsers can’t open
or read .mht and .mhtml files. As of this writing, Internet Explorer can
handle the files, but only the latest editions of Mozilla Firefox and Opera
can handle them.
✦Web Page (.htm, .html): All the component parts of the file are kept in
separate files and are saved in the same folder. Keeping the component
parts in separate files is the standard way to present pages on the Internet.
Handling the half-dozen or more files that are needed to display the Web
page can be troublesome, but you can be certain that the Web page dis-
plays properly in all browsers.
Turning a file into a Web page
Before you save your file as a Web page, create a folder on your computer or
computer network for storing the page if you intend to save it in several files
in the .htm format. Unless you create a folder for storing all the files, you’ll
have a hard time locating them later, and you must be able to locate them to
transfer them to a Web server for display on the Internet or to send them to
someone else.
Follow these steps to save an Office file as a Web page:
1. Click the Office button and choose Save As on the drop-down list.
The Save As dialog box appears.
2. Open the Save As Type drop-down list and choose Single File Web
Page (.mht; .mhtml) or Web Page (.htm; .html).
Earlier in this chapter, “Choosing how to save the component parts”
explains what these options are. New buttons — Change Title and
Publish — appear in the Save As dialog box.
3. Click the Change Title button, enter a descriptive title in the Set Page
Title dialog box, and click OK.
The title you enter will appear in the title bar along the top of the Web
browser window (refer to Figure 2-3).
4. Click the Publish button.
The Publish As Web Page dialog box appears. This dialog box offers
many options for deciding what the Web page looks like and how its files
are organized.
5. Click the Browse button, and in the Publish As dialog box, select the
folder where you’ll keep the Web page (and its support files); then
click OK.

Blogging from inside Word
666
You return to the Publish as Web Page dialog box.
6. Select the Open Published Web Page in Browser check box.
By selecting this box, you can see your presentation in a Web browser as
soon as you save it as a Web page. The new Web page opens in your
default browser, the one that opens automatically on your computer
when your computer encounters a Web page.
7. Click the Publish button.
Office creates the Web page (and its support files if you chose Web Page
[.htm; .html] in Step 2); it stores the file or files in the folder you
selected in Step 5.
The Web page you created opens in your browser if you selected the Open
Published Web Page in Browser check box.
Opening a Web page in your browser
To open a Web page you fashioned from an Office file, open the folder 
where you stored the Web page in My Computer or Windows Explorer and
click the .htm or .hmtl file named after your file. For example, if your file 
is called Sales Projections, double-click the Sales Projections.htm or Sales
Projections.html file to open the Web page.
While you’re at it, you may consider bookmarking the Web page so you can
open it in your browser. To bookmark a Web page in Internet Explorer, open
the Web page you want to bookmark and choose Favorites➪Add to Favorites.
Blogging from inside Word
The word blog is shorthand for Web log. A typical blog is a hodgepodge of
commentary and links — to online news sources and often other blogs —
where topics of concern to the blogger are discussed. Many blogs are online
diaries. You get a daily picture of what the blogger is interested in — dating,
technology, politics, and just about anything else under the sun.
To make it easier to keep a blog, Word offers special commands for writing
blog entries and posting them immediately with a blogging service. Figure 2-4
shows the blogging feature in action. The title and the blog entry in the
Word document are transported in toto to the blog without your having to
enter a password or even visit a blogging service. To take advantage of
Word’s blogging feature, you must already have an account with a blogging
service.

Describing a blog account to Word
Word can’t post entries to a blog unless you tell it where the blog is located,
what your password is, and some other juicy tidbits. As of this writing, Word
is compatible with these blogging services: MSN Spaces, Blogger, Sharepoint,
Community Server, TypePad, and WordPress. If you post blog entries at a dif-
ferent service, you need to know its blog post URL (the address to which
you post entries) and its API protocol setting (either Atom or MetaWeblog).
Follow these steps to tell Word how and where to upload blog entries:
1. Click the Office button and choose Publish➪Blog.
You go to the Blog Post tab (see Figure 2-4).
2. Click the Manage Accounts button.
The Blog Accounts dialog box appears. It lists places where you keep
blogs.
3. Click the New button.
The New Blog Account dialog box appears.
Figure 2-4:

668
4. On the Blog Host drop-down list, choose where on the Internet your
blog is stored and then click Next.
Choose Other if your service isn’t on the list.
5. Enter your username, password, and other pertinent information.
Which options you see next depends on which blogging service you use.
You’re asked for a username and password, and also perhaps an http or
ftp address for publishing pictures on your blog.
When you’re finished describing your blogging service, its name appears
in the Blog Accounts dialog box. Return to this dialog box and click the
Change button if you need to change your password or another particular.
Posting an entry to your blog
When you’re ready to share your thoughts with the world, follow these steps
to write and post an entry to your blog from inside Word:
1. Write the title and the blog entry on the Blog Post tab.
You can do that starting with a new document or a document you’ve
already written.
• New document: Click the Office button, choose New, and in the New
Document dialog box, double-click the New Blog Post icon. Then
enter a title for the entry and the entry itself.
• Already-written document: Write the entry in a new document, click
the Office button, and choose Publish➪Blog. Word gives you a place
to write the title (“Enter Post Title Here”). Enter the title.
Whichever method you choose, you land in the Blog Post tab (refer to
Figure 2-4). It offers all the character styles and proofing tools that you
find in Word. Go to the Insert tab to enter a hyperlink. (Book I, Chapter 2
explains hyperlinks.)
2. Click the Publish button on the Blog Post tab.
If all goes well, Word informs you that your post has been published on
your blogging service, and it lists the time and date it was published.
This information appears in the Word document itself.
Instead of publishing your blog entry right away, you can open the drop-
down list on the Publish button and choose Publish as Draft. Doing so
uploads the blog entry to your blogging service without posting it. The entry
lands on the Editing page, where you can select it, click the Editing button,
and edit it online before publishing it.

A
picture, so they say, is worth a thousand words. Whether it’s worth a
thousand words or merely 950 is debatable. What is certain is that
visuals help people remember things. A carefully chosen image in a Power-
Point presentation, Word document, or Excel worksheet helps others under-
stand you better. The image reinforces the ideas or information that you’re
trying to put across.
This chapter explains how you can make pictures — photographs and
graphics — part of your Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and
Excel worksheets. It looks into graphic file formats, copyrights, and other
issues pertaining to graphics as well as how to touch up graphics in an aux-
iliary program called Office Picture Manager.
By the way, Chapter 4 in this mini-book looks at another way to decorate
your work with images — by using clip art.
All about Picture File Formats
Graphics and photographs come in many different file formats, and as far as
Office 2007 is concerned, some are better than others. These pages explain
what you need to know about graphic files to use them wisely in Office files.
Here, you find out what bitmap and vector graphics are, what resolution and
color depth are, and how graphic files are compressed.

All about Picture File Formats
670
Bitmap and vector graphics
All graphic images fall into either the bitmap or vector category:
✦A bitmap graphic is composed of thousands upon thousands of tiny dots
called pixels that, taken together, form an image (the term pixel comes
from “picture element”).
✦A vector graphic is drawn with the aid of computer instructions that
describe the shape and dimension of each line, curve, circle, and so on.
The major difference between the two formats is that vector graphics do not
distort when you enlarge or shrink them, whereas bitmap graphics lose reso-
lution when their size is changed. Furthermore, vector images do not require
nearly as much disk space as bitmap graphics. Drop a few bitmap graphics
in a file and soon you’re dealing with a file that is close to 750k in size and
takes a long time to load.
Table 3-1 describes popular bitmap graphic formats; Table 3-2 lists popular
vector graphic formats. The clip-art images that come with Office are
Windows Metafile (WMF) files (Chapter 4 in this mini-book explains how to
handle these clip-art images).

Resolution
Resolution refers to how many pixels comprise a bitmap image. The higher
the resolution, the clearer the image is. Resolution is measured in dots per
inch (dpi), sometimes called pixels per inch (ppi). Images with more dots —
or pixels — per inch are clearer and display more fineness of detail. When
you scan an image, your scanner permits you to choose a dots-per-inch 
setting.
High-resolution images look better but require more disk space than low-
resolution images. Figure 3-1 illustrates the difference between a high- and
low-resolution photograph.
Compression
Compression refers to a mathematical algorithm by which bitmap graphic
files can be made smaller. In effect, compression enables your computer to
store a bitmap graphic with less disk space. Some bitmap graphic types
can’t be compressed; the other bitmap graphic types are compressed using
either lossless or lossy compression:
Figure 3-1:

resolution

Inserting a Graphic in a File
672
✦Lossless compression: To maintain the picture’s integrity, the same
number of pixels is stored in the compressed file as in the original.
Because the pixels remain intact, you can change the size of a file that
has undergone lossless compression without losing picture quality.
✦Lossy compression: Without regard for the picture’s integrity, pixel data
in the original picture is lost during compression. Therefore, if you try 
to enlarge a picture that has undergone lossy compression, the picture
loses quality.
Choosing file formats for graphics
One of the challenges of using graphics and photographs in Office files is
keeping file sizes to a minimum. A file that is loaded down with many photo-
graphs can take a long time to load and send over the Internet because graphics
and photographs make files that much larger. The trick is to find a balance
between high-quality, high-resolution graphics and the need to keep files
sizes low. Here are some tips for choosing graphic file formats:
✦Consider sticking with vector graphics if you’re including graphics in
your file strictly for decoration purposes. As Chapter 4 of this mini-book
explains, Office provides vector clip-art images. These images are easy
to come by, don’t require very much disk space, and can be edited
inside Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.
✦For photographs, make JPEG your first choice for graphics. JPEG images
have a fairly high resolution. If you intend to post your file on the Internet,
you can’t go wrong with JPEGs; they are the de facto photograph stan-
dard on the Internet.
✦If you’re dealing with black-and-white photos or resolution doesn’t
matter, use GIF files. These files eat up the least amount of disk space.
Inserting a Graphic in a File
After you weigh the merits of different kinds of graphics and decide which
one is best for you, you can insert it. Inserting a graphic is as simple as
choosing it in the Insert Picture dialog box. Follow these steps to insert a
graphic on a PowerPoint slide, Word document, or Excel worksheet:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the Picture button.
You see the Insert Picture dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2. In
PowerPoint, you can also open this dialog box by clicking the picture
icon in a content placeholder frame.

button and choose Preview to see what the graphic looks like before you

Switch to Thumbnails or Preview view.
Figure 3-2:

The all-important copyright issue
To save any image on the Internet to your com-
puter, all you have to do is right-click it and
choose Save Picture As. By starting from Google
Image Search (www.images.google.com),
you can scour the Internet for any image you
need. Never before has it been easier to obtain
images for your own use.
Still, obtaining images and using them legally are
two different matters. Would it surprise you to
know that the vast majority of graphics can’t be
used without the owner’s permission? The copy-
right laws have a “fair use” provision for bor-
rowing written words. You can quote others’
words as long as you cite the author and work
and you don’t quote passages longer than 250 to
a thousand words (the “fair use” provision is
vague on this point). The copyright law regarding
graphics is quite straightforward. Unless you
have the owner’s permission, you can’t legally
use a graphic.
Sometimes it’s hard to tell who owns a graphic.
The artist or photographer (or his or her estate)
doesn’t necessarily own the copyright because
artists sometimes relinquish their copyrights
when they create works for hire. The only way
to get permission to use a graphic is to ask.
Contact the owner of the Web site with the
image you want, the publisher if the image is in
a book, or the museum if the work is owned by
a museum. You’ll be asked to write a letter
describing precisely how you intend to use the
image, reproduce it, and distribute it. Your letter
should also say how long you intend to use it
and at what size you intend to reproduce it.

import it. Thumbnails view can also be a help because it gives you a
glimpse of several different files.
You can open the Files of Type drop-down list and choose a file type to
locate files of a certain type in the dialog box.
4. Click the Insert button.
Select the (Picture Tools) Format tab to see all the different ways you
can manipulate a graphic after you insert it. After a graphic lands on a
file, it becomes an object. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate
objects — how to move them, change their size, and change their borders.
The following pages look into various ways to change the appearance of
graphics.
Touching Up a Graphic
Every graphic can be a collaboration, not the work of a single artist. In the
(Picture Tools) Format tab, you can find commands for recoloring, changing
the brightness, and changing the contrast of a graphic. You can collaborate
with the original artist and create something new. You can also crop an 
image — that is, cut off part of it.
PowerPoint, Word, and Excel offer only a handful of tools for changing a
graphic’s appearance. If you have the time and the inclination, alter a
graphic’s appearance in a program designed especially for that purpose. 
You can find many more options for editing graphics in Photoshop, Paint
Shop Pro, and Corel Photo-Paint, for example. Later in this chapter, “Using
Microsoft Office Picture Manager” describes a nifty program that comes 
with Office for editing pictures.
Changing a graphic’s brightness and contrast
Figure 3-3 shows a graphic that has been made over several times with the
Brightness and Contrast commands. Select a graphic, go to the (Picture
Tools) Format tab, and experiment with the Brightness and Contrast com-
mands to alter a graphic’s look. You’ll find the Brightness and Contrast 
commands in the Adjust group.

✦Brightness: Click the Brightness button and choose an option on the
drop-down list. The positive percentage options make the picture
brighter; the negative percentage options make it darker.
✦Contrast: Click the Contrast drop-down list and choose an option to
enhance or mute the difference between light and dark colors or shades.
The positive percentage options heighten the differences; the negative
percentage options mute the differences.
You can also click the Picture Styles group button and then adjust the
Brightness and Contrast settings in the Picture category of the Format Shape
dialog box.
If you regret experimenting with the Recolor, Brightness, and Contrast com-
mands and you want to start all over, click the Reset Picture button. Clicking
this button restores a picture to its original condition.
Recoloring a graphic
Recolor a graphic when you want to bleach it a certain color. Recoloring
gives a graphic a uniform color. Recolored graphics are useful for back-
grounds because they allow the text to show through and be read, as shown
in Figure 3-4. Follow these steps to recolor a graphic:
1. Select the graphic.
2. Click the (Picture Tools) Format tab.
3. Click the Recolor button to open the Recolor drop-down list.
4. Choose a Recolor option.

Live previewing really comes in handy when you’re recoloring a graphic.
Move the pointer over options on the Recolor drop-down list and watch
your graphic to see what happens. Choose the More Variations option to
open a submenu with many color options.
Cropping off part of a graphic
Cropping cuts off part of a graphic. I’m afraid you can’t use the Office crop-
ping tool — like a pair of scissors or an Xacto knife — to cut zigzag around
the edges of a graphic or cut a hole in the middle. You can, however, cut
strips from the side, top, or bottom. In Figure 3-5, the cropping tool was used
to cut off all but the head of a figure to turn a portrait into a head shot.
Follow these steps to crop off part of a graphic:
1. Select the graphic.
2. Click the (Picture Tools) Format tab.
3. Click the Crop button.
Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Size
button to get to the Crop button, as shown in Figure 3-5. You see the
cropping pointer, and instead of selection handles, cropping handles
appear around the graphic. You see eight cropping handles, one on each
side and one on each corner.
4. Drag a handle to crop start cropping.
You may drag more than one handle to crop the image on more than
one side.
Drag a handle to crop part of a graphic.

5. Release the mouse button when only the portion of the graphic that
you want is inside the dashed lines.
If you cropped too far, grab a cropping handle and drag away from the
center of the image. What you cropped reappears.
6. Click the Crop button again or press Esc after you finish cropping
your graphic.
When you crop a graphic, you don’t cut off a part of it — not as far as your
computer is concerned. All you do is tell Office not to display part of a
graphic. The graphic is still whole. You can, however, compress a graphic
after you crop it, and in so doing, truly shave off a part of the graphic and
thereby decrease the size of the file you’re working with, as “Compressing
Graphics to Save Disk Space” explains later in this chapter.
Compressing Graphics to Save Disk Space
By compressing graphics, you reduce their file size and consequently 
the size of the file you’re working on. Not all graphics can be compressed, 
as “Compression” explains earlier in this chapter, and some types of graph-
ics lose their integrity when they’re compressed. You can’t resize lossy-
compressed graphics without their looking odd.
Changing a picture’s shape
Another way to crop a graphic is to change its
shape. Changing from the standard rectangle
to a diamond, for example, crops off the cor-
ners of the graphic. Follow these steps to
change a picture’s shape:
1. Select the graphic.
2. Click the (Picture Tools) Format tab.
3. Click the Picture Shape button.
A drop-down list of shapes appears.
4. Choose a shape.
If you don’t like the shape you choose,
either click the Undo button or reopen the
Picture Shape drop-down list and choose
a different shape. Choosing the Rectangle
shape restores a picture to its original
shape.

Compress graphics to make files load faster and make e-mail messages with
file attachments travel faster over the Internet. Compressing a graphic file
reduces its pixels per inch (ppi) setting. Follow these steps to compress
graphics:
1. (Optional) Select the graphic or graphics you want to compress if you
want to compress only one or two graphics.
The Compress Pictures command compresses all the graphics in a file
unless you select graphics first.
2. Click the (Picture Tools) Format tab.
3. Click the Compress Pictures button.
You see the Compress Pictures dialog box.
4. Select the Apply to Selected Pictures Only check box if you selected
graphics in Step 1 and you want to compress only a couple of graphics.
5. Click OK.
By clicking the Options button in the Compress Pictures dialog box, you can
open the Compression Settings dialog box and declare how you want to com-
press your graphics:
✦Automatically Perform Basic Compression on Save: Select this check
box to compress graphic files each time you save your file.
✦Delete Cropped Areas of Pictures: As “Cropping off part of a graphic”
explains earlier in this chapter, Office crops graphics in name only.
Office retains the cropped part of the graphic in case you want it back,
but you can remove the cropped part as well by selecting this check box.
✦Target Output options: These options — Print (220 ppi), Screen (150
ppi), and E-mail (96 ppi) — tell Office which pixels per inch (ppi) setting
to use when compressing graphics. Choosing a higher setting makes the
graphics look sharper but also requires more disk space. In other words,
the higher setting doesn’t compress the graphic as much.
Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
You may not know it, but you installed a program for managing and editing
pictures when you installed Office. The program is called Microsoft Office
Picture Manager, and you can use it to organize graphics and touch up
graphics before inserting them in a PowerPoint, Word, Excel, or Publisher
file. As shown in Figure 3-6, Picture Manager displays graphics so that you
can see precisely what your editorial changes do to them. The program

Book VIII

makes it easy to find and organize graphic files on your computer. In most
Office programs, you can find commands for editing graphics, but you often
have to dig in obscure dialog boxes to find them. Picture Manager puts the
editing commands on the side of the screen where you can find them easily.
To open Picture Manager, click the Start button and choose All Programs➪
Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office Tools➪Microsoft Office Picture Manager.
You see the window, as shown in Figure 3-6. Starting there, you can display a
graphic on your computer and change its appearance in several different
ways.
Mapping the graphic files on your computer
The first step in using the Picture Manager is to tell the program what kind
of graphic files you work with and point to the folders on your computer
where these graphic files are located. After you tell Picture Manager which
folders graphic files are kept in, shortcuts to the folders appear in the Picture
Shortcuts pane on the left side of the window (see Figure 3-6). By clicking
one of these shortcuts, you can open a folder, view its contents, and edit a
graphic file.
Select a folder where graphics are stored.
Change views.

Follow these instructions to get started in Picture Manager:
✦Telling the program which graphic file types you use: Choose Tools➪
File Types to open the File Types dialog box. Select the file types you
want to manipulate with Picture Manager and click OK. Earlier in this
chapter, Tables 3-1 and 3-2 explain what these files types are.
✦Telling the program which folders contain graphic files: Choose File➪
Add Picture Shortcut or click the Add Picture Shortcut link in the Picture
Shortcuts pane (click the Shortcuts button to see this pane). The Add
Picture Shortcut dialog box opens. Select a folder where you store
graphics that you want to work with and click the Add button.
Instead of pointing to folders one at a time, you can choose File➪Locate
Pictures and have Picture Manager scour your computer or network for the
graphic file types you select in the File Types dialog box. Shortcuts to fold-
ers with those file types appear in the Picture Shortcuts task pane. If you go
this route, however, you’ll likely discover many, many folders on your com-
puter where graphic files are kept, and shortcuts to these folders will crowd
the Picture Shortcuts task pane.
Click the Shortcuts button (or choose View➪Shortcuts) to display the
Picture Shortcuts task pane. To remove a shortcut from the task pane, 
right-click it and choose Remove Shortcut.
Displaying the graphic file you want to work with
After you’ve created shortcuts to the folders where you keep graphic files,
you can display a graphic file by following these steps:
1. Click the Shortcuts button, if necessary, to display the Picture
Shortcuts task pane.
2. Click a shortcut to a folder.
Graphic files in the folder appear in the middle window (refer to 
Figure 3-6).
3. Scroll to or choose a different view to pinpoint the file.
Picture Manager offers three views: Thumbnails, Filmstrip, and Single
Picture. Click a View button to change views (refer to Figure 3-6).
Double-click a thumbnail image to see a graphic in Single Picture view. To
zoom in and out, drag the Zoom slider.

Editing a picture
With the graphic you want to edit on display, you’re ready to start editing.
Your next task is to display the editing tools you need on the right side of the
window, as shown in Figure 3-7. Picture Manager offers two ways to get the
editing tools you need:
✦Click the Edit Pictures button to display the Edit Pictures task pane. It lists
the names of editing tools. Click the link that represents the kind of edit-
ing you want to do. For example, to crop a graphic, click the Crop link.
✦Open the Picture menu and choose a task — Brightness and Contrast,
Color, Crop, Rotate and Flip, Red Eye Removal, Resize, or Compress
Pictures. For example, choose Picture➪Crop to cut off part of a graphic.
To let Picture Manager try its hand at improving your graphic, click the Auto-
Correct button (or choose Picture➪AutoCorrect).
If you regret making changes to a graphic, choose Edit➪Discard Changes. All
changes you made are reversed, and you get your original graphic back.
Click the Save button (or press Ctrl+S) to save your graphic after you’ve
finish editing it. For that matter, choose File➪Save As before you start edit-
ing and save the file under a new name so that you have the original in
reserve.
Figure 3-7:
The editing
tools appear
on the right
side of the
window.

Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
682
If you edit one picture and go to another without saving the first one, Picture
Manager takes notice. Copies of unsaved files are kept in the Unsaved Edits
folder. To see the contents of this folder, click Unsaved Edits in the Picture
Shortcuts task pane. Unsaved graphics appear on-screen so that you can
select and save them, if you so choose.
Adjusting the brightness and contrast
Select a graphic and choose Picture➪Brightness and Contrast or click the
Brightness and Contrast hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane to adjust a
graphic’s tonal intensity. You see a Brightness, Contrast, and Midtone slider
on the Brightness and Contrast task pane. Without going into too much
detail, here is what these sliders do:
✦Brightness: Adjusts the inherent brightness value in each pixel.
Increasing the brightness makes the image lighter; decreasing it 
makes the image darker.
✦Contrast: Increasing the contrast, in the words of a laundry detergent
manufacturer, “makes your whites whiter and your darks darker,”
whereas decreasing the contrast making the tones more similar.
✦Midtone: Redefines the midtones, or tonal values between light and
shadow, of an image. Dragging the slider to the right brightens the
image.
If dragging the sliders doesn’t provide the results you want, say the heck
with it and just click the Auto Brightness button to let Picture Manager
adjust the brightness and contrast for you.
Balancing the colors
Select a graphic and choose Picture➪Color or click the Color hyperlink in
the Edit Pictures task pane to fine-tune a graphic’s colors.
You can have Picture Manager do the fine-tuning for you. Click the Enhance
Color button and then click a part of the graphic that is supposed to be
white. If you don’t like the results, try balancing the colors in the graphic
yourself by dragging these three sliders:
✦Amount: Increasing this value magnifies the hue and saturation settings;
decreasing this value minimizes them.
✦Hue: Increasing this value further distinguishes the colors from one
another; decreasing this value makes the colors blend.
✦Saturation: Increasing the value makes colors more luminous; decreas-
ing this value makes colors grayer.

Cropping a graphic
Select a graphic and choose Picture➪Crop or click the Crop hyperlink in the
Edit Pictures task pane to cut off parts of a graphic. Picture Manager shows
precisely how much of the graphic you will crop when you click the OK
button (refer to Figure 3-7). The Crop task pane is especially useful if you
want your graphic to be a certain size. Under Picture Dimensions, you can
see exactly how many pixels high and wide your graphic is. By dragging the
selected part of the graphic — the part that isn’t grayed out — you can be
very precise about what part of the graphic remains after you crop.
The Crop task pane offers two ways to crop a graphic:
✦Crop at will: In the Aspect Ratio drop-down list, choose None and then
drag a corner or side cropping handle.
✦Maintain symmetry when you crop: Choose an option from the Aspect
Ratio drop-down list and select the Landscape or Portrait option button
before you drag a corner or side cropping handle. Aspect ratio propor-
tionally describes the relationship between a graphic’s width and height.
For example, at the 4 x 6 aspect ratio, the graphic in Portrait mode is a
third taller than it is wide (4⁄6); in Landscape mode, the graphic is a third
wider than it is tall. Choose an aspect ratio setting when you want your
graphic to have symmetry.
Cropping a graphic doesn’t reduce its file size. To reduce a graphic’s file size
after you’ve cropped it, compress the graphic. See “Compressing a graphic”
later in this chapter.
Rotating and flipping graphics
Select a graphic and choose Picture➪Rotate and Flip, or click the Rotate and
Flip hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane to rotate or flip graphics. The
Rotate commands turn the graphic on its side; the Flip commands provide
mirror images of the original graphic. You can rotate a graphic by degrees 
by entering a value in the By Degree text box. The Formatting toolbar also
offers Rotate buttons for rotating graphics.
Removing “red eyes” from a graphic
Sometimes the subject of a photo appears to have red eyes, not because the
subject didn’t get enough sleep, but because the camera flash made the sub-
ject’s irises turn red. Follow these steps to remove red eye from a digital
flash photograph:
1. Choose Picture➪Red Eye Removal or click the Red Eye Removal
hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane.

Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
684
2. Drag the Zoom slider to the right so that you get a good look at the red
eyes in the photo.
3. Click each red eye to select it.
4. Click the OK button.
You can click the Reset Selected Eyes button to start all over, if you need
to do that.
Resizing a graphic
To change the size of a graphic, select it and choose Picture➪Resize or click
the Resize hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane. You land in the Resize
task pane. It offers three ways to change the size of a graphic:
✦Predefined Width x Height: Select this option button, and on the drop-
down list, choose the setting that best describes the graphic’s size. For
example, if you intend to post the graphic on a Web page, choose Web -
Large or Web - Small.
✦Custom Width x Height: Select this option button and enter pixel meas-
urements for the width and height of the graphic. Be careful with this
option because the graphic doesn’t maintain its original proportions
unless you calculate the proportions yourself, and when a resized
graphic loses its original proportions, it can be skewered or blurred.
✦Percentage of Original Width x Height: Select this option button and
enter the percentage by which you want to enlarge or shrink the
graphic.
The bottom of the task pane tells you how many pixels wide and high your
graphic was to start with and how wide and high it is after resizing.
Compressing a graphic
Near the beginning of this chapter, “Compression” explains what compress-
ing a graphic entails. Compress a graphic to reduce its file size. Compressing
a graphic file reduces its pixels per inch (ppi) setting. Some graphic types,
however, can’t be compressed.
To compress a graphic, select it and choose Picture➪Compress Pictures or
click the Compress Pictures hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane. You see
the Compress Pictures task pane. The bottom of the task pane tells you how
much the graphic shrinks in size after you compress it. Choose a Compress
For option button and click OK.

T
his chapter explains how you can use clip art to decorate Word docu-
ments, PowerPoint slides, and Excel worksheets. You also find a treatise
on how to use the Microsoft Clip Organizer, an auxiliary program for storing
clip art and other kinds of media files so that you can find the files in a hurry.
If you often use media files in your work, you owe it to yourself to look into
the Clip Organizer.
What Is Clip Art?
In the old days, long before the invention of computers, people would buy
clip-art books. They would literally cut, or clip, images from these books
and paste them into posters, letters, and advertisements. Today’s clip art is
the digital equivalent of old-fashioned clip art. You can paste clip art into
computer programs such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher. You
can resize clip-art images without the images losing their integrity. The clip
art that comes with Office 2007 isn’t encumbered by licensing restrictions;
it’s in the public domain, and you can use it as you please.
Figure 4-1 shows examples of some clip-art images that come with Office.
Use images like these to decorate your files. Use them to help illustrate an
idea or simply to add a little liveliness to your work. In my experience, the
hardest task where clip art is concerned is finding the right image. You can
choose from so many images that finding the right one is a chore.

Inserting a Clip-Art Image
686
Inserting a Clip-Art Image
To insert a clip-art image, you open the Clip Art task pane, search in the Clip
Organizer for the image you want, and insert the image. The trick to finding
the right image is knowing your way around the Clip Organizer. The majority
of this chapter explains how to organize the art on your computer so that
you can get it by way of the Clip Organizer. For now, you can follow these
basic steps to insert a clip-art image in a page, slide, or worksheet:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the Clip Art button.
You see the Clip Art task pane, as shown in Figure 4-2. In PowerPoint,
you can also click the Clip-Art icon to insert a clip-art image in a content
placeholder frame.

The Clip Art task pane is actually an entrée into the Clip Organizer, the
Microsoft program for organizing and quickly inserting clip art. (The Clip
Organizer is explained in more detail later in “Handling Media Files with
the Clip Organizer.”)
3. In the Search For text box, enter a keyword that describes the clip-art
image you need.
Later in this chapter, “Searching for a media file in the Search pane”
explains how keywords work.
4. In the Search In drop-down list, choose the collections you want to
search in (see Figure 4-2).
Later in this chapter, “Searching for a media file in the Search pane”
describes what these collections are.
5. In the Results Should Be drop-down list, choose Clip Art (see Figure 4-2).
6. Click the Go button.
The bottom of the task pane shows the clip-art images found in your
search. You may have to scroll through the task pane to see all the
images.
7. Double-click an image or open its drop-down list and choose Insert to
place it in your Word document, PowerPoint slide, or Excel worksheet.
Your next task is to move the image into position and perhaps change its
size. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate clip-art images and
other objects.
Tinkering with a Clip-Art Image’s Appearance
Sometimes a clip-art image doesn’t sit well with the rest of the page, slide, or
worksheet. The image is too bright or too dark. It clashes with the colors in
the rest of the file. When an image clashes, you don’t have to abandon it in
favor of another image. As Figure 4-3 shows, you can alter a clip-art image’s
appearance in different ways. Select your image, go to the (Picture Tools)
Format tab, and change the image’s appearance with these techniques:

✦Recoloring: Click the Recolor button and choose an option to remake
the clip-art image in a different tint.
✦Changing the brightness: Click the Brightness button and choose an
option to make the image brighter or darker.
✦Changing the contrast: Click the Contrast button and choose an option
to enhance or mute the difference between light and dark colors or
shades in the image.
Handling Media Files with the Clip Organizer
As computers get faster and better, media files — clip art, graphics, video
clips, and sound files — will play a bigger role in computing. Dropping a 
clip-art image in a Word document or PowerPoint slide won’t be a big deal.
Playing video clips on PowerPoint slides will be commonplace.
Well aware that the future is closing in on us, Microsoft created the Clip
Organizer to help you manage the media files on your computer. By using the
Clip Organizer, you can place graphics, video clips, and sound files in Word
documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel worksheets, and Publisher pub-
lications. More important, the Clip Organizer is the place to organize media
files in your computer so that you can find them and make good use of them.
These pages explain how to manage the Clip Organizer.
Do either of the following to open the Clip Organizer:
✦Open the Clip Organizer from inside an Office program: Open the Clip
Art task pane (on the Insert tab, click the Clip Art button). Then click the
Organize Clips link at the bottom of the task pane.
✦Open the Clip Organizer: Click the Start button and choose All
Programs➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office Tools➪Microsoft Clip
Organizer.
Knowing your way around the Clip Organizer
As shown in Figure 4-4, the Clip Organizer is divided in two parts, with a
pane on the left and a window for displaying files on the right. The Clip
Organizer offers two panes: Collection List and Search.
✦Collection List task pane: Use the Collection List task pane to organize
your media files and to quickly locate and insert a media file. To display
the Collection List task pane, click the Collection List button or choose
View➪Collection List.

Book VIII
Chapter 4

✦Search task pane: Use the Search task pane to locate a media file on
your computer. Notice that this task pane is similar to the Clip Art task
pane in Office programs (refer to Figure 4-2). To display the Search task
pane, click the Search button or choose View➪Search.
Locating the media file you need
The Clip Organizer presents two ways to find a media file you need. Starting
from the Search pane, you can conduct a keyword search; starting from the
Collection List pane, you can select folders and subfolders to display clip art
and other media files on the right side of the window.
Searching for a media file in the Search pane
By entering a keyword in the Search For text box, telling the Clip Organizer
where to look, and telling it what kind of files to look for, you can pinpoint
the clip-art image you need:
✦Search For text box: Enter a keyword that describes what kind of clip-
art image you want. As Figure 4-5 shows, each clip-art image has been
assigned descriptive keywords. If the keyword you enter matches a 
keyword assigned to a clip-art image, the image appears in the search
results. (To view an image’s keywords, open its drop-down list and
choose Preview/Properties.)

✦Search In drop-down list: Select the Everywhere check box to look on
your computer and at the Office clip-art Web site for clip-art images. You
can narrow your search to My Collections, Office Collections, or Web
Collections:
• My Collections: Search among media files you’ve deemed favorites,
files you placed in folders of your own making, and files you down-
loaded from Microsoft. Later in this chapter, “Storing your own files
in the My Collections folders” explains how to place media files in
the Favorites folder and create your own folders for organizing 
media files.
• Office Collections: Search among the media files that you installed on
your computer when you installed Office. These files are organized
into categories. Select only a few categories to narrow your search.
• Web Collections: You can search online at the Microsoft Web site 
that stores media files by selecting Web Collections. As are Office
Collections, Web Collections are organized by category.
✦Results Should Be: Choose which type of media you’re seeking — clip
art, photographs, movies, or sounds. By clicking the plus sign (+) next to
a media type, you can look for files of a certain kind. To look for JPEG
photographs, for example, click the plus sign next to Photographs and
select the check box beside JPEG File Interchange Format.

Click the Go button when you’re ready to conduct the search. The results of
the search appear on the right side of the window (refer to Figure 4-4).
Locating a media file in the Collection List
If you know that the media file you want is stored on your computer, you can
find it by starting with the Collection List.
The folders in the Collection List pane work just the same as folders in
Windows Explorer. Click a folder name to display its contents on the right
side of the screen. Display or hide subfolders by clicking the plus sign (+) or
minus sign (–) next to folder names.
When you select a folder (or subfolder) in the Collection List pane, its 
contents appear on the right side of the Clip Organizer window (refer to
Figure 4-4). These are the top-level folders in the Collection List pane:
✦My Collections: Includes the Favorites subfolder (where you can store
media files you use most often), subfolders you create yourself for differ-
ent projects, and the Downloaded Clips subfolder (where clip art you
downloaded from Microsoft is stored). How to store a file in the Favorites
folder or a folder you create yourself is explained later in this chapter in
“Creating your own My Collections subfolder for the Clip Organizer.”
✦Office Collections: Includes many subfolders, each named for a clip-art
category. Select a subfolder to view clip art in a category. You installed
these clip-art images when you installed Office. The clip-art images are
located on your computer.
✦Web Collections: Includes many subfolders, each named for a clip-art
category. To see these clip-art images, your computer must be con-
nected to the Internet.
Inserting a media file
After you find the media file you want, either by searching in the Search
pane or browsing among the folders in the Collection List pane, you can
insert it in a Word document, PowerPoint slide, or Excel worksheet by fol-
lowing these instructions:
✦Clip Organizer: Open the file’s drop-down list and choose Copy. Then
click in your file, go to the Home tab, and click the Paste button (or
right-click and choose Paste).
✦Clip Art task pane in an Office program: Either double-click the image
or open its drop-down list and choose Insert.

Storing your own files in the My Collections folders
The Collection List pane in the Clip Organizer is a convenient place to go
when you need a media file. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could go to the Clip
Organizer when you want a file of a family photo, graphics that pertain to
your work, or a video you’re involved with?
It so happens that you can use the Clip Organizer for your own media files,
not just the media files that come with Office. You can arrange it so that the
media files you need are available to you simply by selecting the Favorites
subfolder in the Collection List pane. For that matter, you can create a sub-
folder of your own in the Collection List and keep your media files there.
Adding your own media files to the Clip Organizer
If you’re a fan of the Clip Organizer — if you think it’s a convenient place to
store and get media files — place your own files in the Clip Organizer. This
Getting clip art from Microsoft
Microsoft permits users of Office to get their
clip art, sound files, and video clips from a
Microsoft Web site. To see what kind of media
Microsoft offers online, connect your computer
to the Internet and click the Clips Online button
(you can find it on the right side of the Standard
toolbar in the Microsoft Clip Organizer). You
come to a Microsoft Web site where you can
download collections of clip art and other
media files to your computer.
When you find a file you like, select the check
box below the image. To download the files to
your computer, click the Download link in the
Selection Basket (you can find this link on the
left side of the window). Items you download
from the Microsoft Web site land in the My

When you add media files to the Clip Organizer, you don’t move the files to a
new location on your computer, although it may appear that way. Truth be
told, the folders in the Clip Organizer don’t really exist on your computer.
The folders actually represent categories. Inside each category are shortcuts
similar to the shortcuts on the Windows desktop that tell your computer
where the files are located on your computer. When you place a file in the
Clip Organizer, what you’re really doing is placing a shortcut to a file located
somewhere on your computer or network.
Automatically cataloging the media 
files on your computer
The first time you open the Clip Organizer, you
see the Add Clips to Organizer dialog box,
which asks whether you want to catalog the
clip art, sound, and video files on your com-
puter. Don’t do it! If you click OK, you crowd the
Clip Organizer with all kinds of extraneous files.
You end up with sound files and graphics from
every trivial program that’s installed in your
computer.
For now, click the Cancel button to postpone
cataloging your media files. When you’re 
ready to start cataloging, use one of these
techniques:
 Pick and choose which files to catalog:
Choose File➪Add Clips to Organizer➪On
My Own and then select files in the Add
Clips to Organizer dialog box. See “Adding
your own media files to the Clip Organizer.”
 Catalog media files in folders: Choose
File➪Add Clips to Organizer➪Automatically
to open the Add Clips to Organizer dialog
box; then click the Options button. You see
the Auto Import Settings dialog box. It lists
every folder on your computer that holds
media files. Go down the list, deselecting
folders with meaningless media files and
selecting folders with media files you may
find useful. Then click the Catalog button to
catalog the media files you really need.

Organizing media files in the My Collections subfolders
The My Collections subfolders in the Collection List pane — Favorites and
the others — are excellent places for storing the media files you use often.
All you have to do to get them is select the Favorites subfolder or another
subfolder in the Collection List. Follow these steps to copy or move a media
file to the Favorites subfolder or another subfolder in the Clip Organizer (the
next section in this chapter explains how to make subfolders of your own):
1. Find the media file or files you want to store in a subfolder.
Earlier in this chapter, “Locating the media file you need,” explains how
to locate a media file.
2. Select the file or files on the right side of the Clip Organizer window.
To select more than one file, Ctrl+click the files, or choose Edit➪Select
All to select them all.
3. Give the Copy to Collection or Move to Collection command.
You can give these commands two different ways:
• Open the file’s drop-down list and choose Copy to Collection or
Move to Collection.
• Open the Edit menu and choose Copy to Collection or Move to
Collection.
You see the Copy to Collection or Move to Collection dialog box.
4. Select a folder in the dialog box.
If necessary, click a plus sign (+) beside a folder to display its subfolders.
5. Click OK.
To remove a file from a subfolder, select it and then press the Delete key, or
open its drop-down list and then choose Delete from Clip Organizer. Deleting
a file this way doesn’t remove it from your computer; it just takes its name
out of the Clip Organizer.
Creating your own My Collections subfolder for the Clip Organizer
If you work with a lot of media files, organize them into My Collections sub-
folders. Put photographs in a Photographs subfolder. Put music files in a
Music subfolder. That way, you can find media files simply by going to the
subfolder where you place them. Follow these steps to create a new sub-
folder in the Clip Organizer:
1. Choose File➪New Collection.
The New Collection dialog box appears.

Handling Media Files with the Clip Organizer
696
2. Select the folder in which to place your new subfolder.
Selecting My Collections is probably the best choice, but place your new
subfolder wherever you want.
3. Enter a name for the subfolder in the Name box.
4. Click OK.
If you need to rename a folder, select it in the Collection List, choose Edit➪
Rename Collection, and enter a new name. To remove it, choose Edit➪Delete
from Clip Organizer.

M
icrosoft OneNote is designed for taking notes — at meetings, at con-
ferences, or when talking on the telephone. Rather than scribble
notes indiscriminately in a Word document, you can enter them in OneNote
and be able to retrieve them later. You can use your notes as building blocks
for reports and white papers. You can copy them to Excel, PowerPoint, Word,
or another Office 2007 program. OneNote comes with all sorts of amenities
for finding and filing notes. OneNote can help you brainstorm and organize
your ideas.
This chapter explains what OneNote is, how you can use it to write notes,
and how to organize and find notes. Finally, it explains a couple of tricks for
recycling notes into other Office programs.
Running OneNote
Do one of the following to run OneNote:
✦Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪Microsoft Office➪
Microsoft Office OneNote 2007.
✦Right-click the OneNote icon in the notification area (it’s located in the
lower-right corner of the screen next to the clock) and choose Open
OneNote. If you don’t see the icon in the notification area and you want

to see it there, choose Tools➪Options, select the Other category in the
Options dialog box, and select the Place OneNote Icon in the Notification
Area of the Taskbar check box.
OneNote opens to the notebook, section, and page or subpage that was open
the last time you closed the program. What is a notebook, section, page, and
subpage? Better keep reading.
Introducing OneNote
Figure 5-1 shows the OneNote window. The purpose of OneNote is to help
you enter notes, keep track of notes, find notes when you need them, and
organize your notes. From largest to smallest, the program offers these units
for handling notes:
✦Notebook: Create a notebook for each important project you’re involved
in. OneNote places one button on the Navigation bar for each notebook
you create. The Navigation bar is located on the left side of the window
(see Figure 5-1).

✦Sections: Within each notebook, you can create different sections. 
A section is a subcategory of a notebook. In Figure 5-1, there are four 
sections — Madagascar, Essential Oils, La Reunion, and Mauritius — 
in the Madagascar notebook.
✦Pages and subpages: Within each section, you can create pages and sub-
pages for storing notes. Notes are stored on pages (see Figure 5-1).
OneNote is unusual among Office programs in that it doesn’t have a Save
button or Save command. Every 30 seconds, OneNote saves all the notes for
you. You needn’t concern yourself with whether notes are being saved.
Creating Storage Units for Notes
Before you write your first note, give a moment’s thought to organizing notes
in the notebook-section-pages hierarchy. Think of descriptive names for your
notebook, sections, and pages. Then get to work creating the storage units
you need for your notes. These pages explain how to do it.
Creating a notebook
Follow these steps to create a new notebook:
1. Open the drop-down list on the New button and choose Notebook.
You see the first of three New Notebook Wizard dialog boxes.
2. Enter a name and select a color for the notebook; then click Next.
Selecting a color can help you distinguish one notebook from another.
3. Click the option button that describes how many people will enter
notes in the notebook; then click Next.
4. Select the folder where you will store notes.
To do so, click the Browse button and select a folder in the Select Folder
dialog box. By default, notebooks are stored in the C:\ Documents
and Settings\Your Name\My Documents (or Documents)\
OneNote Notebooks folder.
5. Click the Create button.
The new notebook opens on-screen. OneNote creates a section (called
New Section 1) and a page (called Untitled Page) in your notebook, as
shown in Figure 5-2.

Creating Storage Units for Notes
700
6. Change the name of the section and page.
Follow these instructions to change section and page names:
• Changing the section name: Right-click the section name, choose
Rename on the shortcut menu, and enter a descriptive name. You
can also double-click a name and enter a new one.
• Changing the page name: Enter a name in the text box at the top of
the page provided for names (see Figure 5-2). After you enter the
name, the new name appears as well on the page tab on the right
side of the screen.
Creating sections, pages, and subpages for notes
Here are instructions for creating sections, pages, and subpages for your
notes:
✦Creating a new section: Click the New button and then type a name for
the section on its section tab. (OneNote creates a new page — called
Untitled Page — when you create a new section. To rename this page,
enter a name in the text box at the top of the page, as shown in Figure 5-2.)
You can color-code sections to distinguish one section from the next. To
change a section’s color, right-click its tab, choose Section Color, and
choose a color on the submenu. To rename a section, right-click its
name, choose Rename, and enter a new name.
✦Creating a new page: Each section comes with one page, but if you need
more pages, press Ctrl+N, or open the drop-down list on the New button
and choose Page. A new page appears, as does a Title text box for enter-
ing a descriptive title for the new page (refer to Figure 5-2). Enter a page
title that identifies the notes you put on the page. You can also open the
drop-down list on the New Page button and choose New Page to create a
new page.
Enter a new page name.
Enter a new section name.
Figure 5-2:

✦Creating a new subpage: Display the page under which you create a
subpage and press Ctrl+Shift+N or open the drop-down list on the New
button and choose Subpage. In OneNote terminology, a page and all its
subordinate pages are called a group. Enter a title for your subpage in
the Title text box. You can also open the drop-down list on the New Page
button and choose New Subpage to create a new page.
Each time you create a new section, you also create a new OneNote Sections
(.one) file. These files are stored in the C:\Documents and Settings\
Your Name\My Documents (or Documents)\OneNote Notebooks\
Notebook Name folder, in case you’re looking for them and want to back
them up.
Writing Notes
Although the program is called OneNote, you can enter two kinds of notes —
typed notes and drawings. Moreover, if you’re using a Tablet PC to scribble
your notes, OneNote can (at least in theory) recognize whether you’re writ-
ing by hand or drawing. These pages explain how to write and draw notes.
Notes appear in what are called containers, as shown in Figure 5-3. Move the
pointer over the top of a container and you see the four-headed arrow. At
that point, you can click and drag a note elsewhere. Drag the right side of a
note container to change its width.
Typing a note
To type a note, simply click and start typing. Press the Enter key to begin 
a new paragraph in a note. You can draw upon the commands on the
Formatting toolbar — do you recognize them from Microsoft Word? — 
to format the text or change its color.
To get more room on a page for notes, try collapsing the Navigation bar 
and page tabs. To do so, press F11 or click the Full Page View/Normal View
button.

Drawing with a pen or highlighter
Follow these steps to draw a note with a pen or highlighter:
1. Display the My Pens toolbar.
OneNote offers two ways to display this toolbar:
• Choose View➪My Pens Toolbar.
• Right-click the menu or any toolbar and choose My Pens.
2. Click a Pen or Highlighter button.
OneNote offers 12 different options on the My Pens toolbar. The first
four are thin pens, the next four are thick pens, and the next four are
Jotting down a side note
Suppose you’re brainstorming and you come
up with an idea that cries out to be preserved
in a note. To quickly jot down your note, write a
“side note” in the small but convenient Side
Note window. This window works in cahoots
with OneNote to help you record ideas before
you forget them. When you enter a note in the
window, it’s entered as well in OneNote in the
Unfiled Notes folder. Next time you open
OneNote, you can go to the Unfiled Notes
folder, locate your note, and copy or move it to
another folder.
To open the Side Note window, click the
OneNote icon in the notification area or press
Windows key+N. Enter your note and then click
the Close button in the Side Note window after
you finish jotting down the note.
To find your note next time you open
OneNote, click the Unfiled Notes
button. You can find this button near
the bottom of the Navigation bar. Your note is
filed away on a page named after the note you
entered. Later in this chapter, “Some House-
keeping Chores” explains how to move notes.

highlighters, not pens. As well as draw with them, you can use the high-
lighters to call attention to the text in notes.
3. Press Esc when you’re finished drawing or highlighting.
Getting from Place to Place in OneNote
As you fill up notebooks with sections, pages, subpages, and notes, finding
the place you need to be to enter or read a note gets more difficult. Here are
ways to get from section to section or page to page in the OneNote window:
✦Going to a different notebook: Click a notebook button on the Navigation
bar. Use one of these techniques to find out where clicking a notebook
button takes you:
• Move the pointer over a button. You see a notebook’s name and the
folder where it is stored in a ScreenTip box.
✦If the Navigation bar is collapsed, click the Expand Navigation Bar button.
Now you can see the names of notebooks as well as the names of note-
book sections on the Navigation bar (refer to Figure 5-1). The Expand
Navigation Bar button is located at the top of the Navigation bar.
✦Going to a different section: Click a section tab along the top of the
window (refer to Figure 5-1). You can also expand the Navigation bar
so you can see sections as well as notebook names and then click a sec-
tion name.
✦Go to a different page: Click a page or subpage tab on the right side of
the window (refer to Figure 5-1). To make more room for page and sub-
page names, click the Expand Page Tabs button. You can find it to the
right of the New Page button.
You can also click the Back and Forward buttons on the Standard toolbar to
revisit pages.
Finding and Keeping Track of Notes
If you’re an habitual note taker, you may find yourself drowning in notes. You
won’t be able to find the note you’re looking for. The great idea you had may
be lost forever. To keep notes from getting lost, these pages explain how to
find stray notes and how to organize notes so that they don’t get lost in the
first place.

Finding and Keeping Track of Notes
704
Flagging notes for follow up
The best way to keep notes from getting lost is to carefully place them in note-
books, sections, and pages. Short of that, you can flag notes to make it easier
to follow up on them. OneNote offers numerous ways to flag notes. After you
flag a note, you can search for it by opening the Note Flags Summary task
pane, arranging notes according to how they were flagged, and pinpointing
the note you want, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Flagging a note
Follow these steps to flag a note:
1. Select the note, if necessary.
2. Open the drop-down list on the Flags button and choose a flag option.
All options — except Remember for Later and Definitions — place an
icon on the note. The aforementioned options highlight the note text,
respectively, in yellow or green.
The fastest way to flag a note is to display the Note Flags toolbar and then
click a button on the toolbar. To display the toolbar, right-click the menu or
any toolbar and choose Note Flags.
Choose how to arrange notes in the task pane.

Arranging flagged notes in the task pane
Follow these steps to arrange notes that you flagged in the Note Flags
Summary task pane:
1. Open the drop-down list on the Flags button and choose Show All
Flagged Notes.
You see the Note Flags Summary task pane (refer to Figure 5-4). You can
also open this task pane by choosing View➪All Flagged Notes.
2. Open the Group Notes By drop-down list and choose an option.
These options determine the order in which flagged notes appear in the
task pane. Note Flag Name, for example, arranges notes according to
which icon they’re tagged with; Section arranges notes under section
names; Note Text arranges notes in alphabetical order.
3. Open the Search drop-down list and choose an option.
These options determine which notes appear in the task pane. This
Section, for example, assembles only flagged notes from the section that
appears on-screen; This Notebook gathers flagged notes from all sections
in the notebook you’re viewing.
A list of notes appears in the task pane.
4. Click the name of a note you want to visit.
OneNote opens the page with the note whose name you clicked and
selects the note.
To remove flags from notes, select the notes and press Ctrl+0 (zero), or open
the drop-down list on the Flags button and choose Remove Note Flags from
Selection.
Finding a stray note
To find a lost note, you must be able to remember a word or two in the note.
Follow these steps to chase down a lost note:
1. Enter the word or phrase you’re looking for in the Search box.
This box is located in the upper-right side of the OneNote window. If you
don’t see it, press Ctrl+F or choose Edit➪Find.
2. Click the Find button.
If the search text can be found, OneNote moves to the first instance of
the search text. If the text is found in more than one note, click the Next
Match (or Previous Match) button to go to the next or previous instance
of the search text. You can also click the View List button to see a list of

Some Housekeeping Chores
706
all notes with the search terms in the Page List task pane. Select a note
in the task pane to view a note.
3. Click the Close button beside the Search box when the search is 
complete.
Some Housekeeping Chores
Unless you play loud soul music while you’re doing it, housekeeping can be 
a tedious and irksome activity. Here are methods for handling a few house-
keeping chores:
✦Selecting notes: Click the bar along the top of a note to select it. Ctrl+
click to select several notes. If you have trouble selecting notes, click the
Selection Tool button and drag across the notes.
✦Moving notes to another page: Use the tried-and-true cut-and-paste
method. Select the note, right-click, choose Cut, right-click the page
where you want to move the note, and choose Paste. You can also use
the keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+X to cut, Ctrl+C to copy, and Ctrl+V to
paste.
✦Moving a page to another section: Right-click the page’s tab and choose
Move Page To➪Another Section. You see the Move or Copy Pages dialog
box. Select a section name and click the Move or Copy button.
✦Removing a notebook from the Navigation bar: To remove a notebook’s
name from the Navigation bar and keep the bar from getting too crowded,
right-click the notebook’s button and choose Close This Notebook (or
choose File➪Close This Notebook). To reopen a notebook, choose File➪
Open Notebook and then select the notebook’s name in the Open Note-
book dialog box.
✦Deleting notes: Select the notes you want to delete and press the 
Delete key.
✦Deleting a section: Right-click the section tab and choose Delete.
Because each section is actually a file, you can recover a section you
deleted accidentally by retrieving it from the Recycle Bin.
✦Deleting a page or subpage: Right-click the page tab and choose Delete.
You can’t recover a page of notes that you delete this way.

OneNote and Other Office Programs
OneNote works hand in hand with its brothers and sisters in the Office suite.
These pages describe how to copy notes into other programs, send notes by
e-mail, and make a note into an Outlook task.
Copying a note into another Office program
To copy a note into another program, use the copy-and-paste command.
Select the note, right-click, and choose Copy. Then go to the other program,
right-click, and choose Paste. Typed notes land in the other program in the
form of text. Drawn notes land as Portable Network Graphics (.png) files.
Sending notes by e-mail
As long as Outlook is installed on your computer, you can send the notes on
a page by e-mail to someone else. The notes arrive as file attachments. As
long as the recipient has OneNote, he or she can read the notes. Follow
these steps to send notes by e-mail:
1. Open the page with the notes you want to send.
Unfortunately, you can’t send a single note unless it’s the only one on
the page.
2. Click the E-Mail button on the Standard toolbar or press Ctrl+Shift+E.
You see a new message window open with the OneNote section within
the message area.
3. Address the message and enter some words to accompany the notes.
4. Click the Send button.
The page of notes is sent by way of Outlook.
Transferring notes to a Word document
Follow these steps to transfer all the notes on a page or subpage to a Word
document:
1. Open the page with the notes that need transferring.
2. Choose File➪Send To➪Microsoft Office Word.
Word opens (if it isn’t already open) and creates a new document for
your notes. Either save the document or copy the notes to a document
you already created.

S
harePoint Services is a software product by which people who work in dif-
ferent locations can collaborate. Co-workers can share files, list tasks that
need to be done, and discuss their work with one another. Think of SharePoint
Services as a digital office. Instead of gathering in the conference room to
share files and ideas, you share them online at a Web site. Co-workers in dif-
ferent states, countries, and continents — but not different planets — can
work conveniently together.
If you’re reading this in an office or cubicle, ask the person nearest you
whether your company shares files with SharePoint Services, and if your 
co-worker answers “yes,” keep reading. This chapter explains how to get
equipped to share files, visit a SharePoint Services Web site, upload and
download files, and do one or two other tasks that fall under the sharing
information category.
Getting Equipped and Getting Started
To use SharePoint Services, you must have access to a SharePoint Services
Web site similar to the one shown in Figure 6-1. These Web sites are main-
tained on a company intranet or on the Internet. Each Web site has an
administrator, the person responsible for letting people into the Web site 
or barring the door, handing out passwords, and giving permission to do 
different tasks.

Visiting a SharePoint Services Web Site
710
To visit a SharePoint Services Web site and share files, you must first obtain
the following from the administrator:
✦The address of the SharePoint Services site: The URL of the SharePoint
site. Typically, the address is http://companyweb if the site is located
on a company intranet. If it’s located on the Internet, the address typi-
cally ends with .com, .net, or .org.
✦A username: A name that identifies you to the Web site.
✦A password: A password for gaining admission.
Often you receive this information in the form of an e-mail message from the
administrator. (SharePoint Services has a special command for issuing invi-
tations to new members by e-mail.)
Visiting a SharePoint Services Web Site
If you received an e-mail invitation to join the SharePoint Services site, click
the hyperlink in the e-mail to visit the site. Otherwise, follow these steps to
gain entry to a SharePoint Services Web site:
1. Open Internet Explorer or another Web browser.
2. Enter the address of the SharePoint Services site in the Address box
and press Enter.
Click to go to different parts of the Web site.

711
The Connect To dialog box appears.
3. Enter your username and password, and then click OK.
Provided you entered the correct username and password, you land on
the Web site’s Home page (refer to Figure 6-1).
Getting from Place to Place in the Web Site
Use the View All Site Content bar on the left side of the window to get from
place to place (refer to Figure 6-1). By clicking Documents, Pictures, Lists,
Discussions, and so forth, you can get to a new page and undertake a new
task. You can also use the Back and Forward buttons in your browser to get
around. Click the Back button, for example, to return to the previous page
you visited.
Click the Home button — it’s shaped like a tab and located in the upper-left
corner of the window — to return to the Home page.
Handling and Managing Files
Think of the SharePoint Services Web site as your computer home away
from home. Starting at the Shared Documents folder (or one of its subfold-
ers), you can upload files so others can work on them, download files to
your computer, edit files, and delete files, as the following pages explain.
Going to the Shared Documents folder
No matter what you want to do with files — upload them, download them, or
open them — start by going to the Shared Documents folder on the SharePoint
Services Web site. Use one of these techniques to go to this all-important
folder:
✦Click the Documents link on the View All Site Content bar to open the
Document Libraries window, and then click the Shared Documents
folder.
✦On the Home page, click the Shared Documents link. (You can find it in
the middle of the window.)
Figure 6-2 shows the Shared Documents folder. This folder lists files that
have been uploaded to the Web site, as well as subfolders that the adminis-
trator created to store additional files. (Click a folder name to see the files
that are stored inside it.)

Handling and Managing Files
712
Uploading files
Uploading means to send a file across an intranet or the Internet to a Web
server so that others can view, open, and download it. Starting in the Shared
Documents folder (or one of its subfolders), use one of these techniques 
to upload a file or files from your computer to a folder on the SharePoint
Services site:
✦Uploading one file: Click the Upload button (see Figure 6-2), and in the
Upload Document window, click the Browse button. You see the Choose
File dialog box, which presents folders and files on your computer.
Locate the file you want to upload, select it, and click the Open button.
Click OK in the Upload Document window.
✦Uploading many files: Open the drop-down list on the Upload button
and choose Upload Multiple Documents. You go to the Upload
Document window. Select a folder in your computer and click the check
box next to the names of files you want to upload. Then click OK.
The Upload Document window offers a check box called Overwrite Existing
Files. When this check box is selected, files you upload erase and take the
place of files in the folder with the same name. If the check box isn’t
selected, a second copy of the file may be uploaded. Whether the second
copy is uploaded depends on whether the administrator permits different
versions of the same file to remain on the Web site.
You can also upload a file from inside an Office 2007 program. Click the
Office button and choose Publish➪Document Management Server. The Save
As dialog box appears. Enter the address of your SharePoint Services site in
the File Name text box and click the Save button. If the Office program asks
for them, enter your username and password. Then select Shared
Documents in the dialog box and click the Save button.
Upload a file.

Downloading a file to your computer
Downloading means to copy a file from a place on the Internet or an intranet
to your computer. Follow these steps to download a file from a SharePoint
Services Web site to your computer so you can edit it in the security and
safety of your own home or office:
1. Locate the file you want to download in the Shared Documents folder
or one of its subfolders.
Earlier in this chapter, “Going to the Shared Documents folder” explains
how to reach the Shared Documents folder.
2. Open the drop-down list on the file and choose Send To➪Download a
Copy (refer to Figure 6-2).
You see the File Download dialog box.
3. Click the Save button.
The Save As dialog box appears.
4. Select the folder on your computer where you want to save the file
and click the Save button.
The file arrives on your computer so you can edit it at leisure. You find
the file in the folder you selected.
Viewing and editing a file
As well as downloading a file to your computer, you can view and edit a file
inside the SharePoint Services Web site by following these steps:
1. Find and select the file that needs your attention in the Shared
Documents folder or one of its subfolders.
Earlier in this chapter, “Going to the Shared Documents folder” explains
how to locate files.
2. Double-click the file’s name.
You can also open its drop-down list and choose Edit in Office Program.
The Office programs opens (if it’s not already open), and the Connect To
dialog box appears.
3. Enter your username and password, and then click OK.
If the file has been designated read-only or someone else is also editing
it, you have to click the Edit button in order to start editing. You’re
asked to save a copy of the file to your computer and edit it there.

Next time you want to open a file online from the SharePoint Services Web
site, try opening it by way of the Recent Documents menu. (Click the Office
button to view this menu.) The names of presentations you opened online
are placed on this menu alongside the names of other presentations you
recently opened. You can tell which files are kept on the SharePoint Services
Web site because the address of the Web site appears in a pop-up box when
you move the pointer over these files’ names.
Deleting a file
To delete a file, locate it in the Shared Documents folder (or one of its sub-
folders), select it, open its drop-down list, and choose Delete. Then click 
Yes in the message box that asks if you’re sure you want to delete the file.
Whether you can delete a file, however, depends on which permissions
you’ve been given by the administrator.
Files that you delete land in the Recycle Bin folder. To undelete a file, go 
to the Recycle Bin folder, select the file’s check box, and click the Restore
Selection link. Click the Delete Selection link to permanently and irrevocably
delete a file so that it can’t be recovered in the Recycle Bin.
Other Ways to Collaborate at a 
SharePoint Services Web Site
Besides file sharing, SharePoint Services offers these amenities to people
who live far apart but want to work closely together:
✦Pictures: Use the Picture Libraries to share photographs with co-workers.
Upload, download, and view photographs by using the same techniques
that you use to share files.
✦Lists: Use announcement, calendar, link, and task lists to manage your
work and your deadlines better. The Links list is for listing Web sites that
are of use to the people you work with.
✦Discussions: Hold newsgroup-style discussions to iron out the problems
that engage you at work. No gossiping is allowed.
✦Surveys: Conduct a survey of co-workers to gauge people’s opinions and
establish goals and objectives.
✦Sites: Use the Sites window to create more workspaces for sharing files
and otherwise collaborating.
✦People and Groups: Use this window to store and obtain your co-workers’
contact information.

his brief chapter explains how macros can make your work a little easier.
I describe how to display the Developer tab on the Ribbon, record a
macro, run a macro, and edit a macro. I also look into macro security issues
and show you how to place a macro button on the Quick Access toolbar.
What Is a Macro?
A macro is a set of command instructions recorded under a name. When you
activate a macro, the program you’re working in carries out the instructions
in the macro. Macros help automate repetitive and complex tasks. Instead of
entering commands yourself, the macro does it for you — and it enters the
commands faster and more efficiently. Instead of reaching into several dialog
boxes to get a task done, you can run a macro and let it do the work.
Not that you necessarily need to know it, but playing a macro involves run-
ning command sequences in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a program-
ming language built into all the major Office 2007 applications. Behind the
scenes, the application you’re working in executes VBA code when you run
a macro.
Displaying the Developer Tab
Before you can run a macro or do anything in the wonderful world of macros,
you must display the Developer tab. Figure 7-1 shows the Developer tab in
PowerPoint. Follow these steps to display or remove this tab:

716
1. Click the Office button and choose Options on the drop-down list.
You see the Options dialog box.
2. Click the Popular category.
3. Click the Show Developer Tab in the Ribbon check box.
4. Click OK.
When you display the Developer tab in one Office program, it appears in the
other programs as well. Likewise, when you undisplay it, it is removed from
your other Office programs.
Managing the Macro Security Problem
A macro is a little (and sometimes not so little) computer program in its own
right. As such, macros can contain computer viruses. When you run a macro
in a PowerPoint presentation, Word document, Excel workbook, or any other
file, you run the risk of infecting your computer with a virus.
To help protect you against macro viruses, Office gives you the opportunity
to decide how you want to handle files that contain macros. You can disable
all macros, disable some macros, or enable all macros. (If you’re working in
an office on a network, the network administrator may have decided for you
whether you can run macro files on your computer. Network administrators
can disable all files that contain macros.)
Follow these steps to tell Office how you want to handle macros:
1. On the Developer tab, click the Macro Security button.
You see the Macro Settings category of the Trust Center dialog box, as
shown in Figure 7-2.
2. Under Macro Settings, declare how you want to handle PowerPoint
files that contain macros.

Your choices are as follows:
• Disable All Macros without Notification: You can’t run macros, and
moreover, you’re not alerted to the fact that your file contains
macros or given the opportunity to enable the macros.
• Disable All Macros with Notification: When you open a file with macros,
you see the panel shown in Figure 7-3. It tells you that macros have
been disabled, but gives you the opportunity to enable the macros
by clicking the Enable Content button.
• Disable All Macros Except Digitally Signed Macros: You can run only
macros that have been certified with a digital signature. Developers
can apply for digital signatures that deem their macros safe to run.
When you open a file with digitally signed macros, a dialog box tells
you who developed the macros and gives you the opportunity to
decide whether you want to allow them. However, you can’t run
macros that don’t have a digital signature.
• Enable All Macros: You can run all macros, no matter where they
came from and who made them. Choosing this option is a risky
proposition. Choose it only if you get Office files from people or 
parties you know and trust.
3. Click OK.

Recording a Macro
718
Excel, PowerPoint, and Word files that contain macros have a file extension
that ends in the letter m (the m stands for “macro”). Excel files have the
extension .xlsm, PowerPoint files the extension .pptm, and Word files the
extension .docm. Even if you disable macros, you can glance at a file’s exten-
sion letters to tell whether it includes macros.
Recording a Macro
Recording a macro in an Office application is a matter of turning on the
Macro Recorder and giving commands. The Macro Recorder is modeled after
a tape recorder. You turn on the recorder, choose commands, and turn the
thing off. Following are ground rules and instructions for recording macros.
Unless you want to construct them on your own using VBA code, you can’t
record your own macros in PowerPoint 2007 (although you can in Word,
Excel, Publisher, Access, and Outlook). To make use of macros in PowerPoint,
you have to obtain them from a developer or have them already in your
PowerPoint presentation.
Ground rules for recording macros
Before you record a macro, observe these ground rules:
✦Plan ahead. If the actions you intend to record in the macro are complex,
write them down beforehand so that you can execute the commands
without making any mistakes.
✦Set up the program the way it will be when you play back the macro.
Before creating a macro that manipulates information in a worksheet, for
example, open a worksheet that is typical of the kind of worksheet on
which you’ll run the macro. Unless you prepare yourself this way, you
may have to pause the Macro Recorder (you can do that in Word) as you
record, or you may have to edit the macro in the Visual Basic Editor
later.
✦Toggle commands that you can switch on and off have no place in
macros because when the macro starts running, the Macro Recorder
can’t tell whether the command is on or off.
✦Close open files that might get in the way. For example, before creating a
macro that copies information from one file to another, close any open
files that might confuse the issue.
✦If you intend to include a Find or a Find-and-Replace operation in a Word
macro, open the Find dialog box in Word before you start recording the
macro, click the More button, and then click Cancel. This way, you can

Book VIII
Chapter 7
Automating Tasks
with Macros

719
get to all the find-and-replace options when you open the dialog box as
part of recording the macro.
✦In Excel, click the Use Relative References button on the Developer tab if
you want to record cell references as relative, not absolute, references.
Recording a macro
Having read and followed the ground rules, follow these steps to record a
macro in Word and Excel:
1. On the Developer tab, click the Record Macro button.
The Record Macro dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-4.
If you can’t find the Record Macro button, chances are an administrator
removed it to prevent you from using or recording macros. Depending
on which version of Windows you have, administrators can remove all
macro and VBA functionality from Office by not installing the VBA com-
ponent, or they can install the component but prevent individuals from
accessing macros and VBA.
2. In the Macro Name text box, enter a name for your macro.
Macro names can be 80 characters long, must begin with a letter, and
can include numbers and underscores. Blank spaces, symbols, and
punctuation are not allowed in macro names.
3. If you so desire, assign a toolbar button or keyboard shortcut to
the macro.
In Word, you can click the Button or the Keyboard icon and assign a
button or keyboard shortcut for activating the macro. Later in this 
chapter, “Running a Macro from a Button on the Quick Access Toolbar”
explains how to put a macro on the Quick Access toolbar. Chapter 1
of this mini-book explains how to assign a keyboard shortcut to a
Word macro.
Figure 7-4:

Recorder
dialog box in
Word (left)
and Excel
(right).

Recording a Macro
720
In Excel, you can assign a Ctrl+key combination to a macro by entering a
key in the Ctrl+ text box.
4. In the Store Macro In drop-down list, decide where to store the macro
you’re about to record.
In Word, you can store macros in the document you’re working on, the
template the document is attached to, or the Normal template (the global
template that’s always loaded). Store a macro with a template if you’d
like to be able to run the macro in all documents you create with your
template.
In Excel, you can store macros in the workbook you’re working on
(choose the This Workbook menu item), a new workbook, or the
Personal.Macro Workbook. The Personal.Macro Workbook is designed
expressly for storing macros. It is created automatically the first time you
choose Personal.Macro Workbook. The workbook is called Personal.
xlsb, and it’s stored in this folder if your machine runs Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\Your Name\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\
XLSTART
The Personal.xlsb workbook is stored in this folder if your machine
runs Windows Vista:
C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLStart
5. In the Description text box, enter a concise description of what the
macro does.
6. Click OK.
The Record Macro dialog box closes.
7. Perform the actions you want to record in the macro.
The Macro Recorder records every action you take, but it doesn’t 
record actions in real time. Take your time when recording a macro.
Concentrate on taking the actions in the right order so that you don’t
need to adjust the code afterward.
Word offers the Pause Recording button. You can click it to suspend
recording. Click it again to resume recording.
In Excel, the Developer tab includes a Use Relative References button.
Click it to switch between recording absolute cell references and relative
cell references.
Avoid using the mouse as you record a macro (although you can use it
to open menus and select menu commands). The Macro Recorder inter-
prets some mouse actions ambiguously. Select data by using key presses.
(In Excel, you can select cells with the mouse because the Macro Recorder
is able to recognize cell addresses.)

Book VIII
Chapter 7

721
When you visit a dialog box as part of recording your macro, take into
account all the dialog box settings. For example, if you visit the Font
dialog box and choose 12 points on the Font Size drop-down list, the
Macro Recorder duly records the 12-point font size, but it also records
the Times Roman font in the macro if Times Roman happens to be the
font that is chosen in the Font dialog box. The moral: Take account of all
the settings in a dialog box when you visit it while recording a macro.
In dialog boxes with tabs, you can’t click tabs to switch from tab to tab
and choose commands. Instead, click OK to close the dialog box, reopen
it, click a different tab, choose a command on the tab, and close the
dialog box again.
8. Click the Stop Recording button.
That’s all she wrote — your macro is recorded. I suggest you test it to
see how well it runs.
To delete a macro, click the Macros button on the Developer or View tab,
and in the Macros dialog box, select the macro you want to delete and then
click the Delete button.
Running a Macro
Before you run a macro, take note of where the cursor is located. The macro
may require the cursor to be in a certain place to run properly. Follow these
steps to run a macro:
1. On the Developer or View tab, click the Macros button (or press
Alt+F8).
The Macros dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5:
The Macros
dialog box.

Editing a Macro
722
2. Select the macro that you want to run.
Macros have cryptic names, but you can usually tell what they do by
glancing at their descriptions.
If you don’t see the macro you want, make a new selection in the Macro
In drop-down list.
3. Click the Run button.
If your macro is a long one and you need to stop it from running, press
Ctrl+Break. (On most keyboards, the Break key is located along with the
Pause key on the right side of the keyboard, to the right of the F12 key.)
Editing a Macro
Editing a macro entails opening the Visual Basic Editor and editing Visual
Basic codes, which is not for the faint of heart. If your macro is an uncompli-
cated one, you’re better off re-recording it. This book isn’t a developer’s
guide, so it can’t go into the details of using the Visual Basic Editor. However,
the following pages explain the basics of reading a macro in the Visual Basic
Editor, deleting parts of a macro, and editing the text in a macro.
Follow these steps to view a macro in the Visual Basic Editor:
1. On the Developer tab, click the Macros button (or press Alt+F8).
You see the Macro dialog box (refer to Figure 7-5).
2. Select the name of the macro that needs editing.
3. Click the Edit button.
You see the Visual Basic window, as shown in Figure 7-6.
4. Choose File➪Save Normal (or press Ctrl+S) after you finish editing
your macro.
The name of the macro you selected appears in the Procedure box on the
right side of the window. Those computer codes in the Code window are
scary, aren’t they? You can find one line of code for each command in your
macro. Edit computer codes the same way that you edit text in a Word docu-
ment. For example, click to the left of a line to select it and then press Delete
to delete a line. Or type in the Code window to add commands or change the
text that the macro enters in documents.

723
Reading a macro in the Code window
Before you can do any editing in the Visual Basic Editor, you have to know
how to read the codes in the Code window. Observe these attributes of the
Code window:
✦Sub and End Sub line: A macro begins with the Sub line and ends with
the End Sub line.
✦Apostrophes (‘) at the beginning of lines: Lines that begin with an apos-
trophe (‘) are descriptive comments and aren’t part of the macro except
insofar as they help you understand what it does. Notice, for example,
that the descriptive line near the top of the macro appears after an 
apostrophe. Enter blank lines and lines of commentary to make macros
easier to read and understand.
✦Text enclosed in double quotation marks (“): Text that is typed in as
part of the macro is enclosed in double quotation marks (“). If you need
to edit the text in your macro, edit the text inside double quotation marks.
✦With and End With lines: Codes that pertain to choices made in a dialog
box begin with the With line and end with the End With line.
✦All dialog box options are recorded: Even if you select only a single
option in a dialog box, the macro records all the options in the dialog
box. A visit to the Font dialog box, for example, adds more than 20 lines
to a macro — one for every option in the dialog box. However, you can
edit out lines that your macro does not require.
Figure 7-6:
Edit macros
in the Visual
Basic Editor
window.

Running a Macro from a Button on the Quick Access Toolbar
724
Editing the text that a macro enters
As I mention earlier, text that is typed during a macro procedure is enclosed
in double quotation marks (“) in the Code window. To edit the text in a
macro, you can edit the text between double quotation marks in the Code
window. Edit this text as though you were editing it in Word.
Deleting parts of a macro
Delete part of a macro when you want to remove a command or command
sequence. For that matter, you may delete parts of a macro if they are unnec-
essary. Deleting unnecessary lines makes a macro easier to read and run
faster. As I mention in the preceding section of this chapter, a visit to a dialog
box, such as the Font dialog box, adds many lines to a macro, most of which
are unnecessary. Your macro requires only the lines that pertain to changing
settings.
To delete part of a macro, delete the lines as though they were text in a 
Word document: Click or click and drag in the left margin and then press 
the Delete key.
Running a Macro from a Button 
on the Quick Access Toolbar
Any macro that you run often is a candidate for the Quick Access toolbar. As
Book VIII, Chapter 1 explains, you can place your own buttons on the Quick
Access toolbar and move the toolbar below the Ribbon as well. Follow these
steps to assign a macro to a button and place the button on the Quick
Access toolbar:
1. Right-click any button or tab and choose Customize Quick Access
Toolbar on the shortcut menu.
You see the Customize category of the Options dialog box.
2. In the Choose Commands From drop-down list, choose Macros (you
can find it near the top of the list).
The cryptic names of macros in your file appear in the dialog box.
3. Select the macro you want to assign to a button and click the Add
button.
The macro’s name appears in the right side of the dialog box alongside
the names of buttons already on the Quick Access toolbar.

4. Make sure that your macro is still selected and click the Modify
button.
The Modify Button dialog box appears. It offers symbols you can place
on your macro button.
5. Select a symbol and click OK.
6. Click OK in the Options dialog box.
A button representing your macro appears on the Quick Access toolbar.
You can click this button to run your macro. If you want to remove the
button, right-click it and choose Remove from Quick Access Toolbar.

Chapter 8: Linking and Embedding
in Compound Files
In This Chapter
 Understanding what object linking and embedding (OLE) is
 Embedding foreign data in a file
 Linking to foreign data in another file
A
compound file is a computer file that brings together data created in dif-
ferent programs. A year-end report is a classic example of a compound
file. Typically, a year-end report includes word-processed text, worksheet
tables, and graphics. Thanks to object linking and embedding (OLE), you
can create compound files. They can include data from different sources —
Excel worksheets, Word text, or Paint graphic files. What’s more, you can copy
and continuously update material from other programs without leaving the
Office 2007 program you’re working in.
All this magic is accomplished with something called object linking and
embedding (OLE). This chapter explains OLE, tells you how to embed data
from another file in PowerPoint, and explains how to link data from another
file so that your files are updated automatically.
By the way, OLE is pronounced the same as olé (“oh-lay”), which is the word
that the bullfighting audience shouts when the bull passes under the mata-
dor’s cape. ¿Loco, verdad?
What Is OLE, Anyway?
Object linking and embedding (OLE) is a means of putting more than one 
program to work on the same file. You can think of OLE as a high-powered
version of the standby Copy and Paste commands. As you probably know,
the Copy and Paste commands are for copying material from one place or
program to another. For example, with the Copy and Paste commands,
you can copy text from an Excel worksheet into a Word document. You can
copy columns and rows from a Word table and paste them straight into a
PowerPoint table.

What Is OLE, Anyway?
728
Linking and embedding
Object linking takes the copy-and-paste concept a step further. When you copy
text from a Word document to a PowerPoint slide, you can link the Word file
and PowerPoint slide so that changes made to the Word text are made as
well to the same text on your PowerPoint slide. In effect, linking means you
can run the Copy and Paste commands in the background without having to
actually choose Copy or Paste. Linking establishes a connection between the
two objects — in this case the text in the Word document and the text in the
PowerPoint slide — so that the one automatically updates the other.
Similarly, embedding enables you to keep, or embed, foreign data from another
program in the file you’re working on. The program you’re working in under-
stands that the data is foreign. When you click the data, the program’s tabs
and buttons disappear to be replaced by tabs and buttons belonging to the
program designed to handle the data. For example, when you click an Excel
worksheet embedded in a Word document, you see Excel tabs and buttons
for handling the worksheet data. In effect, you can open a second program
inside the first program and use the second program to create data without
having to copy the data from the second program. The object — the Word
document or Excel worksheet — isn’t connected to another file but is con-
tained within the file.
Figure 8-1 shows an Excel worksheet embedded in a Word document. Notice
the Excel tabs and buttons in the window. The tabs and buttons are at the
ready. After you finish using them, you can click outside the embedded
object — you can click outside the Excel worksheet — and go back to using the
Word tabs and buttons. Although the table data was made in Excel, it looks like
a Word table. Embedding an object spares you from having to open a different
program, construct material there, and copy it into the file you’re working on.

Chapter 8
Linking and

What Is OLE, Anyway?
729
A linked object is a little bit different from an embedded object. When you
double-click a linked object, the program you’re currently using shouts out
to the program where the material was created to find out whether the mate-
rial has been edited or altered in any way. If the material has been updated,
you can tell Office to gather the updated material and incorporate it into
your current file. Linking is an opportunity for you to keep your files up-to-
date. You can fold the work that you or a co-worker did to the original file
into your file without having to go outside the program you’re using, and
then copying and pasting it.
Uses for linking
Linking was designed to let files dynamically share information. The object —
the Excel worksheet or Word file, for example — remains connected to its
source. As the source file is updated, the files to which it is linked can be
updated, too.
Linking saves you the trouble of updating files that often change. Co-workers
can maintain a library of source files and use them to update the files to
which the source files are linked. Here are some examples of object linking
coming in handy:
✦Your PowerPoint presentation contains sales data, and you want the
data to be up-to-date. You create a link to the Excel worksheet where
the sales data is stored so that your PowerPoint slide remains up-to-date
as sales data changes.
✦A co-worker has created an Excel worksheet with demographic data that
often changes. In your Word report, you create a link to your co-worker’s
worksheet so that demographic data appears in your report and is always
up-to-date.
✦Your company maintains a Word file with a list of branch office addresses
and telephone numbers, and you want this list to be available to employ-
ees. You link your Word file to the company’s Word file. Your address and
telephone list document stays up-to-date as addresses and telephone
numbers change.
Uses for embedding
Embedding enables you to work inside an Office program on data that the
program isn’t equipped to handle or display. Embed an Excel worksheet in a
Word document if you want to have a table with complex mathematical for-
mulas. Embed a Word document in an Excel worksheet if you want to write
paragraphs of explanatory text and be able to call upon Word formatting
commands. Consider embedding an object if you want to attempt something
that you can’t normally do in the program you’re working in.

Linking to Data in another File
730
Pitfalls of linking and embedding
Linking and embedding aren’t for everybody. Here are some OLE pitfalls:
✦File size: Including embedded objects in a file makes the file grow in size —
and I mean really grow. A large file can be unwieldy and hard to store.
It takes longer to load on-screen. By linking, you solve the file-size problem
because the item has to be stored only once — in its original location.
✦Carrying charges: Links are broken if you move your file or you or some-
one else moves a file to which your file is linked. A file with links can’t be
sent over the Internet or copied to a laptop without the links being broken.
Linking is out of the question in the case of files that travel to other com-
puters. If you link to files over a network, establish a scheme for storing
files with your co-workers so that files aren’t moved inadvertently.
✦Formatting embedded and linked objects: Unfortunately, linked and
embedded objects are often hard to format. Selecting the same fonts and
colors as the fonts and colors in your file can be difficult because you
have to rely on the commands in the source file to do the formatting.
The end result is that linked and embedded objects sometimes look out
of place.
Before you undertake any activity regarding object linking and embedding,
save the file you’re working on. The program with which you’re working
needs to know precisely where OLE objects go in order to execute OLE 
commands. Therefore, your file must be completely up-to-date for OLE com-
mands to work.
Linking to Data in another File
Link a slide, document, or worksheet to another file so that changes made to
the other file are made automatically to your slide, document, or worksheet.
Earlier in this chapter, “Uses for linking” explains the benefits of linking to
another file. These pages explain how to establish the link between your files,
how to update the link, how to break a link, and how to mend broken links.
Links are broken when files are renamed or moved to different folders.
Linking files is more trouble than it’s worth if you often move or rename files.
Very carefully create or choose folders for storing linked files so that you
don’t have to move them.
Before you link one file to another, save the file you’re working on. Your pro-
gram needs to know precisely where OLE objects go in order to execute OLE
commands. Therefore, your file must be completely up-to-date — and saved —
for OLE commands to work.

Establishing the link
For the purposes of linking, the original file with the data you will link to is
the source. Follow these steps to establish a link between your file and the
source file so that your file can be updated whenever the source file is
changed:
1. Open the source file with the data that you’ll link to your file.
2. Select the data you need and copy it to the Windows Clipboard.
You can do that by right-clicking and choosing Copy or pressing Ctrl+C.
3. Click in the file where you want the linked data to appear.
4. Click the Save button.
As I explain earlier, all files must be saved and up-to-date for links to be
successfully made.
5. On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Paste button and
choose Paste Special.
The Paste Special dialog box appears.
6. Select the Paste Link option button, as shown in Figure 8-2.
In the As list, your program chooses an Object option for you, depend-
ing on which type of data you selected in Step 2.
7. Click OK.
Your file creates a pointer to data in the source file, and the data appears
in your file.
8. Save your file by clicking the Save button.
Congratulations. The link is established.
Figure 8-2:

To change the size of a linked object, move the pointer over a selection
handle and drag. To move a linked object, move the pointer over the object
and drag when you see a four-headed arrow.
Updating a link
Each time you open and save your file, the program you’re working in checks
the source file to find out whether its source data has been changed in
any way. If the data has changed, new, up-to-the-minute data is inserted
into your file.
Editing data that is linked with a source file
Suppose, while staring at the linked data in your file, you notice something
wrong. The numbers in the table aren’t accurate. There’s a misspelling in the
list. On those occasions, you can open the source file and edit the data with
one of these techniques:
✦Editing the data inside your program: Right-click the linked object and
choose Object➪Edit Link. (The Object command is named for the kind
of data you’re editing.) If your program can manage it, tabs and buttons
for editing the data appear. Edit the data and click Save.
✦Editing the data in the source file: Double-click the linked object, or
right-click it and choose Object➪Open Link on the shortcut menu. The
program with which the source file was created and the source file itself
both open. Edit the data and click the Save button.
Opting for manual rather than automatic links
Some people prefer to update links manually
rather than automatically. A manual link is
updated when you tell a program to update it.
These links don’t tax your computer’s memory
as much as automatic links. Follow these steps
to make links in your file manual rather than
automatic:
1. Click the Office button and choose Prepare➪
Edit Links to Files.
You see the Links (or Edit Links) dialog box.
2. In the Links list, Ctrl+click to select the
links that you want to update manually
rather than automatically.
3. Select the Manual Update option button.
4. Click OK.
To update a manual link, right-click the linked
object that needs updating and choose Update
Link on the shortcut menu.

Breaking and reestablishing links
As shown in Figure 8-3, the Links (or Edit Links) dialog box offers commands
for breaking and reestablishing links. To open this dialog box, click the Office
button and choose Prepare➪Edit Links to Files. Select a link in the Links (or
Source) list and go to it:
✦Breaking links: Break a link when you want your file to stay the same no
matter what happens to the data in the source file. To break a link, click
the Break Link button.
✦Reestablishing a link when the source file has changed locations:
Reestablish a link if you or someone else moves the source file to a dif-
ferent folder, rendering its link to your slide invalid. To reestablish a link,
click the Change Source button, find and select the source file in the
Change Source dialog box, and click the Open button.
✦Opening the source file: Click the Open Source button to open the source
file and perhaps edit the original data there. (You can also open the source
file by right-clicking the linked object and choosing Object➪Open Link.)
Embedding Data from Other Programs
By embedding data, you can enter and edit foreign data without leaving the
program you’re working in. An Excel worksheet, for example, can be embed-
ded in a Word document (refer to Figure 8-1). When you double-click the
embedded object, the computer program with which it was created opens so
that you can start editing.
Embedding foreign data
How you embed data that is foreign to the program you’re working in depends
on whether the data has already been created. You can get a head start
embedding data if you or someone else has already created it. Following are
instructions for embedding an object so you can enter the data on your own
and embedding data that has already been created.
Figure 8-3:
Go to this
dialog box
to break and
reestablish
links.

Creating an embedded object from scratch
Create an embedded object from scratch if the data you need hasn’t been
created yet. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
If your aim is to create an Excel table, click the Table button, choose
Excel Spreadsheet, and be done with it.
2. Click the Object button (and, in Word, choose Object on the drop-
down list).
You see the Object (or Insert Object) dialog box, as shown on the left
side of Figure 8-4.
3. Click the Create New option tab (or option button).
4. In the Object Type list, choose the name of the program that handles
the kind of data you want to embed.
For example, to insert a space for Word text, choose Microsoft Office
Word Document.
5. Click OK.
Where your program’s tabs and buttons used to be, you see different
tabs and buttons. Use them to create and edit data.
Click outside the data when you’re finished working on it.

Embedding data that has already been created
If the data you want to embed has been created already in another program,
you can embed the data in your file by following these steps:
1. Open the file with the data you want to embed.
Open the file in the program with which it was created.
2. Copy the portion of the file you want to embed with the Copy command.
For example, right-click the portion of the file and choose Copy in the
shortcut menu.
3. Return to the program where you want to embed the data.
4. Click the Home tab.
5. Open the drop-down list on the Paste button and choose Paste Special.
You see the Paste Special dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-5.
6. Select the Paste option button.
7. In the As list, choose an option with the word Object in its name.
Which options appear in the list depends on which type of object you’re
embedding. The options without Object in their names are for pasting
the data in picture format.
8. Click OK.
The data lands in your file.
Figure 8-5:
Choose the
program
where the
embedded
data comes
from.

Embedding Data from Other Programs

Embedding an entire file
You can embed an entire file in the file you’re working on by following these
steps:
1. On the Insert tab, click the Object button (and, in Word, choose Object
on the drop-down list).
You see the Object (or Insert Object) dialog box (refer to Figure 8-4).
2. Select the Create from File tab (or option button).
You see the version of the Object (or Insert Object) dialog box, as shown
on the right side of Figure 8-4 (shown previously).
3. Click the Browse button.
The Browse dialog box opens.
4. Select the file you want to embed in your file and click OK (or Insert).
5. Click OK in the Object (or Insert Object) dialog box.
That’s all there is to it.
Editing embedded data
To edit an embedded object, double-click it. Where your program’s tabs and
buttons used to be, you see a new set of tabs and buttons — ones belonging
to the program normally used to edit the type of object you’re editing. When
you’re finished editing the foreign data, click outside it.
To change the look of embedded data, right-click it and choose Format
Object. Then choose formatting commands in the Format Object dialog box.
The techniques for changing the size and position of embedded objects are
the same as the techniques for resizing and repositioning shapes, graphics,
clip-art images, and other objects (Book I, Chapter 8 enumerates these 
techniques). To reposition an embedded object, move the pointer onto its
perimeter and drag. To resize an embedded object, move the pointer over a
selection handle and then drag.
