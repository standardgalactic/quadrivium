ou are unique among readers. Almost nobody reads the Introduction to a book like
this. However, you’ll benefit by taking a few minutes to read through this intro-
ductory material. Its purpose is to help you maximize your return on the investment
you’ve made in this book—your investment in money and especially your even more
costly investment in time.
Why This Book

Why This Book
Why This Book
Bookstore shelves are packed with guides to the Internet, the biggest network on the
planet. So why this book? Because although many fine books have been written about
the Internet, there really isn’t a book targeted specifically for business users of the Internet.
Other books give you a great deal of information about the Internet and some useful
information about how to access it, but don’t give the sorts of detailed commentary and
advice useful to business people. Business users of the Internet benefit by having a
reference that emphasizes, talks from the point of view, and focuses on the business
aspects of the Internet. In short, business users of the Internet need a book that talks
about the Internet as a business tool.
MBA’s Guide to the Internet is the only book that specifically describes how you can more
easily, more productively, and more powerfully use the Internet in business.
Although this book’s title references the popular business professional degree, MBA,
this book will also be of use to people without MBAs. MBA students, for example, will
find this book useful. People with graduate degrees in accounting, public administra-
tion, economics, and related fields will find this book useful as well.

In addition, anyone who’s finished a good undergraduate program in business or a related
field (like accounting) will feel comfortable and gain skills using this book as a desk-
top reference.

The easiest way to see what’s in this book is to turn to the table of contents. It lists each
chapter and each chapter’s contents in rich detail.
The chapters in this book fall into four parts:
Chapters 1 through 7 provide fast-paced but friendly tutorials on programs and ser-
vices you use to access the Internet. In a nutshell, these seven QuickPrimers™ move you
to professional proficiency in using the Internet—even if you’re new to it. If you don’t
need this help, of course, you can easily skip these primers. We suggest, however, that
even if you already know how to use Microsoft Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, and
some of the other services, you read Chapter 7, which discusses privacy and security on
the Internet. This topic continues to stay near the top of the current events news and
is of particular interest to business users.
Chapters 8 through 12 provide detailed coverage of several topics of interest to busi-
ness users of the Internet—topics that are short-changed in books that have to be
everything to everybody. Chapter 8, for example, explains how to gather specific types
of business information from sites that you can search on the Internet. Chapters 10 and
11 point you toward a number of free and governmental business resources.
Chapters 13 through 20 describe how to set up real-life business projects using the
Internet—a Web site, a PowerPoint presentation that you can publish to the Web, a
Web store, an intranet, an e-mail newsletter, and an online investment portfolio. In
addition, chapters in this part of the book discuss how to use the Internet for recruit-
ing, job searching, and online banking.
Appendixes A, B, and C explain how to use other popular software products and
operating systems to access the Internet. A glossary of Internet terms helps you sort out
the language of the “net.”

In this book, the illustrations and the steps for processes primarily assume the use of
Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, the most recent release in the Windows fam-
ily of operating systems. If you have an earlier version of Windows, the steps and what
you see on the screen will be similar, but not identical. When you have a question, check
out Windows Help.
To identify screen elements, the first letter of each word in the description is capital-
ized. This convention may look a bit strange at first, but it makes it easier to understand
some instruction as “click the Print Table Of Links check box.”
You’ll also find Notes, Tips, and Warnings, which point out tidbits of useful informa-
tion. Pay attention to Warnings; they help you avoid potential problems. A few sidebars
are also scattered throughout. Sidebars contain helpful information that is not neces-
sarily directly related to the topic at hand, or they may discuss in detail a subject that
is mentioned in the running text but which is not elaborated on.
One final point: you’ll find many, many URLs (Web site addresses) in this book. If
you don’t know already, you will quickly find out that the Internet is an exceedingly
dynamic environment. Web sites come and go, and, if their Webmasters are doing their
jobs properly, content changes frequently. The best sites will reroute you to their site
if their URL changes. If you come to a dead end, try using one of the search services
discussed in Chapter 8 to find the site.

H
ow important is the Internet? Here is how some U.S. business leaders answered
that question:
• “I don’t think there’s been anything more important or more widespread in all my
years at GE. Where does the Internet rank in priority? It’s No. 1, 2, 3, and 4.” (Jack
Welch, chairman and CEO, General Electric)
• “In the mental geography of e-commerce, distance has been eliminated. There is only
one economy and only one market.” (Peter Drucker, known as the “father of modern
management”)
• “It is easy to make the case for the Internet that no technology has evolved so quickly
to touch the lives of so many around the world.” (C. Michael Armstrong, chairman
and CEO, AT&T)

MBA’s Guide to the Internet - Electronic Edition
• “As we approach a new millennium, the Internet is revolutionizing our society, our
economy, and our technological systems. No one knows for certain how far, or in what
direction, the Internet will evolve. But no one should underestimate its importance.”
(Robert E. Kahn, chairman, CEO, and president of the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives; and Vinton G. Cerf, senior vice president, Internet Architecture
and Technology, MCI WorldCom, Inc.)
It’s pretty clear—if you’re in the business world today, you need to be on the Internet.
Since 1988, the total number of host computers and users has been growing at about 33
percent every six months. In contrast, telephone service grows on average between 5 and
10 percent a year (even counting the proliferation of cell phones).
This chapter is an introduction to the Internet—what it is, how it works, where it came
from, and how business professionals can use it to increase efficiency and productivity.
Defining the Internet

Defining the Internet
What is the Internet? The short answer is that the Internet is a worldwide network of
networks, which raises the question, what is a network? By definition, a network is a
group of computers and peripheral devices (such as printers, modems, and so on) that
are connected in some way so that their users can share files and other resources. A
network can be as simple as two computers in a small office or in a home connected via
a communications cable. A more complex network, a local area network (LAN), can
connect many computers via a communications cable.
Yet a still more complex kind of network is a wide area network (WAN). A WAN is
any network that crosses metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries, and so you could
say that the Internet is the largest WAN on the planet. The Internet is actually a specific
type of WAN—a collection of interconnected networks, which is technically an
internetwork. Internet, then, is short for the term internetwork.

According to the Federal Networking Council, the term Internet refers to the
“global information system that is logically linked together by a globally unique
address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/
follow-ons; is able to support communications using the Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons,
and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and provides, uses, or makes accessible,
either publicly or privately, high-level services layered on the communications
and related infrastructure described herein.” The next section explains this in
a more comprehensible fashion.

When you send or receive information over the Internet, the process can seem almost
instantaneous—under ideal conditions. But the way that information travels over the
Internet is fairly complex. We’ll look at the parts and pieces that make it happen a bit
later in this section, but first we need to look at two underlying mechanisms that are
responsible for the existence of the Internet: client/server architecture and the
TCP/IP family of protocols.
Understanding the Architecture
Understanding the Architecture
Understanding the Architecture
Understanding the Architecture
Understanding the Architecture
Some people say that the real secret to the Internet is an arrangement based on programs
called clients and servers. Simply put, a server is a program that provides a service, and
a client is a program that requests a service. A server program resides on a computer that
is also called a server because it stores the information that the client requests.
For example, you have an e-mail program on your computer; it is a client. When you
use this client program to send a message over the Internet, it contacts an e-mail server
program on another computer, which could be in the same office building or on the
other side of the world. That mail server program ensures that your message is
delivered to the address you specified.
Client programs reside on your computer, but server programs reside on remote computers.
Remote doesn’t mean on a desert island, but just some place outside your office or home.
The client could care less about where the server is.
Now all these client and server programs on the Internet are not all running on the same
kinds of computers or on the same operating system. You can access the Internet with a
Macintosh computer, with a terminal attached to a mainframe, from a computer that is
running the Unix or Linux operating system, from a computer that is running any of several
versions of Microsoft Windows, and so on. And the server program you access could also
be running on any of a number of different configurations. What makes this possible is
that all these computers and programs abide by the same set of communications rules,
known as protocols. In particular, the Internet uses the TCP/IP family of protocols.
Understanding the Protocols

Understanding the Protocols
When information goes out over the Internet, it is sent in chunks called packets. The Internet
Protocol moves these packets from one place to another, and the Transmission Control
Protocol manages the flow of packets and ensures that the information arrives intact and
without errors. Thus, TCP/IP is the mechanism that keeps the Internet running.

After information is broken into packets and begins its journey from one computer to
another over the Internet, it can travel through many computers, networks, and hardware
devices. Here are some of the most important hardware devices:
• Hubs, which link groups of computers and allow them to communicate. Most hubs
are also repeaters.
• Bridges, which link LANs.
• Gateways, which are similar to bridges but also translate information from one kind
of network to a different kind of network.

• Repeaters, which amplify the information at various intervals so that the signal doesn’t
weaken. Repeaters are important when information has to travel long distances.
• Routers (often called gateways), which ensure that packets always arrive at the desti-
nation for which they are intended. Routers also monitor the traffic on the Internet
and, when necessary, send packets to a router that is closer to the ultimate destination.
• Backbones, which carry most of the traffic on the Internet. A backbone can connect
several locations, and other, smaller networks can be connected to a backbone. Most
backbones are very high speed and can transmit enormous quantities of data, ranging
from hundreds of megabits per second to many gigabits per second.

Who Is in Charge of the Internet?
No one. No one runs the Internet, and no one owns the Internet, and yet it seems to
work just fine. Of course, the Internet is composed of many smaller networks, and many
of these networks are managed by corporations, governments, and all sorts of other
organizations, but no one entity or person is in charge of the Internet.
In the early days of the Internet (and we’ll look at that next), anarchy reigned, and to
some extent it still does, despite numerous attempts by governments to pass legislation
that would tax the Internet, prohibit certain kinds of activity over the Internet, moni-
tor or track e-mail, and so on. This sort of regulation is, of course, anathema to the
pioneers of the Internet and to most technology professionals. In Chapter 7, we’ll look
at Internet privacy and security issues, and, in that context, it’s important to
remember that no one thing or person controls the Internet.
The Internet is directed by a group of volunteers called the Internet Society (ISOC),
which promotes cooperation and coordination for the Internet, Internet applications,
and Internet technologies. In addition, the ISOC coordinates the activities of the
Internet Architecture Board (IAB), which works out issues of standards, network
resources, and so on; the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which handles
day-to-day issues of Internet operation; the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA), which is a clearinghouse for Internet addresses, protocol variables, and domain
names; and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which creates long- and
short-term research groups that concentrate on protocols, architecture, and technology
issues. For information about the Internet Society, go to http://www.isoc.org.

A Short History of the Internet
Harley Hahn, a recognized Internet expert, said recently something to the effect that
the Internet is relatively new, but that it’s going to be around for the rest of our lives
and long after we are gone. We agree with most of that statement, but the Internet is
kind of also not “new.” It evolved through a series of developments in the academic,
governmental, and information technology communities, and it’s instructive to take a
look at some of these developments:
• In 1969, ARPAnet, an experimental four-computer network, was established by the
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense as
a backup communication system in case of a nuclear attack and so that scientists could
communicate.
• By 1971, the date that is usually marked as the official beginning of the Internet,
ARPAnet comprised almost two dozen sites, including MIT and Harvard. By 1974,
ARPAnet comprised 62 sites, and by 1981, more than 200 sites.
• During the 1980s, more and more computers using different operating systems were
connected. This was made possible by the standardization of  TCP/IP, which in 1983
became the official transport mechanism for all connections to ARPAnet.
• In 1983, the military portion of ARPAnet was moved onto the MILnet, and
ARPAnet was officially disbanded in 1990.
• In the late 1980s, the National Science Foundation’s NSFnet began its own network.
It was, however, primarily the domain of techies, computer-science graduates, and
university professors because commercial traffic was banned. In 1991, the ban was
lifted, making way for the age of electronic commerce.
• In 1992, the World Wide Web system and software were released, and in late 1993,
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released versions of
Mosaic (the first graphical Web browser) for Microsoft Windows, for Unix systems
running the X Window System, and for the Apple Macintosh. Traffic on the Internet
grew at a rate of 341,634 percent a year.
• In 1994, Netscape Communications Corp. was formed and released the Netscape
Navigator browser.

• In 1995, NSFnet reverted to its existence as a research project, and the Internet was
left in commercial hands. Microsoft released Internet Explorer, a Web browser that
competed head-to-head with Netscape Navigator.
• In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed the Telecommunications Act partially in an
attempt to regulate the Internet. In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this
act was unconstitutional.
• In 1998, the U.S. Justice Department and attorneys general from several states filed
suit against Microsoft, claiming that the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows
98 violated antitrust guidelines. At the time of this writing, the case is pending before
the U.S. Supreme Court.
• In 2000, it is estimated that more than 200 million people worldwide are using the
Internet and that by 2005 that number will increase to 1 billion.

By the time you read this, the 43rd president will probably have taken the oath of
office. In preparation, the Internet Policy Institute prepared a series of papers,
Briefing the President: What the Next President of the United States Needs To Know
about the Internet and Its Transformative Impact on Society. (You can find these papers
online at http://www.internetpolicy.org/briefing.)
In his introduction to these papers, Jim Barksdale, former president and CEO of
Netscape, related the following:
• Johann Gutenberg invented movable type about 1436, but it was several centuries
before more than a handful of people owned books.
• Household electricity was invented in 1873. Fifty years later, only about 25 percent
of U.S. households were connected to a power line.
• The telephone took 35 years to spread to 25 percent of U.S. households.
• Radio took 38 years to reach 50 million listeners, television took 13 years to reach
50 million viewers, and cable took 10 years to reach 50 million viewers.
• Within five years of its commercial inception, the Internet reached 50 million users.

If you work in a corporation, the short answer is that you can do anything that isn’t
prohibited by the policies or technological controls in place in your organization. That
answer begs the question, though, and what you really want to know are what kinds of
resources are available on the Internet that can help you be more productive, more
efficient, and more informed in your area of the business world. You’ll find lots of
suggestions throughout this book, and here is a brief list to get you started:
• Send and receive e-mail.
• Share files, programs, and other digital resources.
• Plan a trip and purchase airline tickets.
• Find out what restaurants in a new city would be appropriate for entertaining
clients.
• Make hotel reservations.
• Rent a car.
• Print a map and driving instructions.
• Get investment information and buy and sell securities.

Understanding Internet Connections
If you work on a corporate LAN, you most likely don’t need anything special to connect
to the Internet because your computer system is set up with a communications channel,
and your company has contracted with an Internet service provider (ISP). If, however, you
have a home office or your own small business, you need some kind of device that lets you
communicate with the Internet, and you need an account with an ISP.
Many corporations access the Internet by through a connection called a T1. A T1 is
a long-distance circuit that moves data at incredibly fast speeds and is very expensive.
Unless money is no object, you’ll need to find some other means to connect your home
or office to the Internet.
NOTE

In Chapter 2, we’ll look at how you configure your computer to use the
communication device you select. Here, we simply want to give you an over-
view of the possible choices.

Probably the most typical communications device in use today is the modem. Any
computer you’ve bought within the last few years or purchase today is probably equipped
with one, and it is usually the fastest modem available. That said, you’ll never connect
at the modem’s maximum speed because a modem uses your phone line, and the elec-
trical noise on a phone line can decrease the modem’s speed by 30 percent or more.
Although today’s 56K modems (capable of up to 53Kbps downloads and 33.6Kbps
uploads) are fast when compared with those available even five years ago, they are still
the slowest type of Internet connection. Because a modem uses a regular, analog phone
line, it is referred to as a dial-up connection.
A step up from a modem in terms of speed is an Integrated Services Digital Network
(ISDN) line. This type of connection is also provided by the phone company, but it
uses all digital technology, which means that it is not subject to as much electrical
interference and, thus, is much faster than a modem. ISDN lines can be used for both
voice and Internet connections at the same time, although doing so reduces the speed
of the connection from 128Kbps to 64Kbps.
The next faster connection to the Internet is a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). DSL
speeds start at about 256Kbps and can reach a maximum of 8Mbps. DSL also uses the
phone line and can support simultaneous voice and Internet connections. Most DSL
connections are always on; that is, unlike using your modem, you don’t have to connect

to DSL after you power up your computer. DSL is a permanent connection, and to use
it, you need DSL service from your phone company, an account with an ISP who offers
DSL, and a DSL modem. Using a DSL connection can be a cost-effective choice,
especially if you’ve previously needed two phone lines.
Another popular way to connect to the Internet these days is via cable modem. Cable
connections are provided by the same companies that provide cable TV, and some of
these companies also serve as ISPs. Cable modems are fast (typically 500Kbps- 2Mbps),
and your cable company furnishes everything you need to get set up, which usually
means a cable modem and an Ethernet adapter, if your computer doesn’t have an
Ethernet port. The downside to cable modems is that you must share the bandwidth
with everyone in your neighborhood who has one. As usage increases, connection speed
decreases, which is not as evident with ISDN or DSL.

Before you start looking for an ISP, you want to have made the choice about which kind
of Internet connection you will use. If you decide on cable modem, for example, you
won’t need to find an ISP, because the cable company will probably be your ISP. And
if you decide on DSL, you’ll need to find an ISP that offers that kind of account. If
you choose to use a dial-up connection, you can choose from any number of ISPs,
including those that are in your local area or region or those that are national.
When you buy a new computer, you’ll often see an icon on the desktop that gives you
easy access to 800 numbers for various ISPs. You can then sign up online. In addition,
as you will see in the next chapter, the Internet Connection Wizard can help you find
an ISP. Both methods are quick and easy, but may not be the best solution for your
particular situation. Often the best way to start is to ask people in your area which ISP
they use and if they are happy with the service. You can also check your local newspa-
pers or phone books.
Basically, when you contact an ISP, you want to know how much a service costs and
exactly what you’re getting for your money. These days, most ISPs offer unlimited access
to e-mail and the Web for one set fee. If you travel and take your laptop on the road,
be sure to find out if the ISP has a toll-free number that you can dial to check your
e-mail.

Earlier in this chapter, we listed some Web sites that every business user of the Internet
should know about. If you are a new business user of the Internet, we think that four
sites, in particular, should be your first ports of call: Amazon.com, the Dell Computer
site, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) site, and the Social Security Administration
site. Each of these sites is an example of using the Internet to its best advantage and
gives you an excellent idea of what is available on the Internet for the business user.
Amazon.com was one of the first and perhaps the most successful, if not the most
profitable, business to exist entirely on the Internet. Initially, the mission of
Amazon.com was to sell books, at a discount, over the Internet, and it billed itself as
the world’s largest bookstore, even though it had virtually no inventory. Today
Amazon.com sells everything from books to software to garden tools, claims to have
“earth’s biggest selection” of products, and still has virtually no inventory. Amazon doesn’t
order products until after it sells them. Figure 1-1 shows the Amazon.com Welcome
page, which you can access by entering http://www.amazon.com in the Address bar of
your Web browser.

Dell Computer Corporation was founded in 1984 on the concept of selling personal
computer systems directly to customers. Today, about half of Dell’s sales are transacted
over the Internet, 40 percent of Dell’s technical support activities occur online, and about
70 percent of Dell’s order-status transactions occur online. Dell sells computer systems
to large corporations, government agencies, educational institutions, medium and small
businesses, and home computer users. You’ll find the Dell home page at
http://www.dell.com, and after you place an order with Dell you can track it online, all
the way from the order processing stage, through the building and testing stage, to the
final shipping stage at the Support.Dell.Com page, which is shown in Figure 1-2.

You may be aware that each year more and more U.S. citizens are filing their taxes online,
but you may not know that the IRS Web site is filled with information and forms for
businesses that you can access online and/or download. Whether you need Schedule C,
Profit or Loss from Business, or Schedule D, Capital Gains and Losses, or the dates by
which you must pay estimated taxes, you’ll find it at http://www.irs.gov. Figure 1-3 shows
the IRS e-file for Business page; all businesses can pay electronically through the
Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS).

As you saw earlier in this chapter, the U.S. government was in the forefront during the
development of the Internet and the technologies that power it. Consequently, many
government Web sites are models of how to use interactivity and provide information.
In addition to the IRS site, you’ll want to visit the Social Security site at
http://www.ssa.gov. Whether you’re self-employed, work for a corporation, are a new-
comer to the business world, or are about to start a life after work, understanding what
part your contributions to the Social Security fund will play in your retirement is
important to you.
After an ill-fated attempt to make this information available online a few years ago, the
Social Security Administration now has a top-notch electronic procedure that you can
use to calculate your benefits. To see how this works, go to the page at
http://www.ssa.gov/retire, as shown in Figure 1-4.

ssume you’re in the market for a new computer and that you have only two choices:
 one computer has all the latest bells and whistles you could ever imagine on a
standalone machine; the other has the fastest connection on the planet to the Internet.
Cost is not an issue. Which computer would you buy?
Well, if you spend as much time on the Internet every day as we do, this decision is a
no-brainer. In an ideal world, we’d take the computer with the great connection, and
it would never go down. As the business world increasingly relies on the Internet and
the services it provides, we yearn for faster and more reliable connections.
In this chapter, we’ll take a look at some of the options you might consider when
selecting a connection for your home office or for a small- to medium-sized business.
If you work for a big firm, you may connect at the office to a very high-speed device,
such as a T1. A T1 is a long-distance point-to-point communications circuit that
transfers data at incredibly fast speeds (1.5Mbps) and is very expensive, somewhere in
the neighborhood of $2,000 a month.

Although a T1 is not generally an option for most of us, present and emerging
technologies are delivering faster Internet connections to many areas in the United States
and at affordable prices. If you live in an outlying area, such as one of us does, providers
may be touting what is on the horizon rather than what is actually available in your
neighborhood, but even that is progress.
We’ll start by discussing the modem, and then we’ll look at some high-speed connections
that are becoming more common, depending on your location. We’ll also look at how to
share these connections and how to connect to your office when you’re on the road.

A modem is a device that lets a computer transfer information over a telephone line.
A computer is a digital device, and a telephone line is an analog device; therefore, a
mechanism is needed that can convert digital signals to analog signals and vice versa,
and that’s what a modem does. A modem is connected to a computer on one end and
plugs into a phone jack on the other end; a modem can be external, that is, on the outside
of the computer, or internal, on the inside of the computer.
Modem speed is measured in kilobits per second, which is abbreviated Kbps, but people
commonly refer to this speed in “bauds” and speak of modem speed as “baud rate.”
Modems can typically transfer information over a standard telephone line at a rate of
up to 56Kbps, but as we mentioned in Chapter 1, this is a theoretical maximum be-
cause of electrical noise on the phone line. Another speed limitation concerns whether
you are downloading information (for example, receiving e-mail or accessing a Web page)
or uploading information (for example, sending e-mail or posting a Web page to a Web
server). Downloading information is faster than uploading for the fastest modems, with
the 33.6Kbps the fastest speed you can upload over a modem.

Installing a Modem
If you are using a Plug-and-Play operating system, such as Windows 98, Windows ME,
or Windows 2000 Professional, the operating system recognizes your modem (if it is
Plug and Play, and most of today’s modems are) and installs it when you install the
operating system. It also installs the modem if you later upgrade or change modems.
At times, however, you may want to install your modem manually. For example, if your
modem isn’t working properly, one common troubleshooting approach is to remove it
and then reinstall its device driver. Or if  Windows doesn’t recognize your modem and,
thus, doesn’t have the proper device driver to install, you’ll have to install the driver and
the modem manually.
To install a modem, follow these steps:

If the wizard can’t identify your modem, you’ll be asked to choose its make and model
from a list. If the list doesn’t contain the make or model of your modem, look in the
manual that came with your modem to see whether an equivalent type is listed. If you
don’t find an equivalent type, you can do one of the following:
• Check the disk that was provided with your modem. If it contains a driver, click the
Have Disk button to open the Install From Disk dialog box, and install the driver.
• Select one of the standard modem types in the Models list.
• Contact the manufacturer of your modem to see whether it has an updated driver.

When you install a modem or when it’s installed automatically, all your communica-
tions programs, such as Microsoft Outlook Express, Fax, HyperTerminal, and so on,
use the settings that were configured during installation. These settings include the port
on which the modem was installed, the speaker volume of the modem, maximum port
speed, and dial control. Normally, you don’t want to change any of these settings. To
take a look at them, click the Modems tab in the Phone And Modem Options dialog
box, right-click your modem, and choose Properties from the shortcut menu to open
the Properties dialog box. Figure 2-3 shows the Properties dialog box for a modem on
a computer in our office.
Figure 2-3
The Properties dialog box for a modem.
Internal modems are usually installed on COM port 3 or 4. External modems are
normally installed on COM port 2. If you are an advanced user and really know what
you are doing, you can change the port setting using the options on the Advanced tab.
When you connect using your modem, you’ll hear the modem dialing out—unless the
volume of the speaker inside your modem is set too low (or your modem doesn’t have
a speaker). To increase or decrease the volume, move the slider bar.
When your modem connects with the modem at your ISP, it tries to connect at the
maximum speed. In general, set the maximum port speed at three or four times the rated
modem speed to take advantage of the modem’s built-in data compression.

Later in this chapter, we’ll look at how to connect from a remote location, and in that
situation you may want to change the dialing rules. But you may also need to change
the dialing rules when, for example, the phone company in your area switches to a
10-digit dialing system or if you move your home or office to a different location.
To create a new location or to edit a location, follow these steps:
1. Open the Phone And Modem Options dialog box.
Click the Start button, click Settings, click Control Panel, and then click Phone And

Most people who use the Internet outside a corporate environment probably start out
using a modem. If you spend a lot of time accessing the Web or if you send and receive
lots of files, as we do, you soon become dissatisfied with the speed of your connection
and start looking for alternatives. One alternative that may be available to you is a cable
modem, which uses the same wiring that brings cable TV into your home or office.
Today, more than 100 million homes are wired for cable TV, so if your cable provider
also provides cable modem service, it might make sense to use a cable modem. We say
might because there’s a catch. Downloading over a cable modem can be 4 to 40 times
faster (256Kbps to 2Mbps) than downloading over a 56Kbps modem, but uploading
is only about 4 times faster (usually 128Kbps). What this means in practical terms is
that if you’re primarily interested in accessing Web resources, a cable modem is going
to bring them to your screen much, much faster than a modem. On the other hand, if
you want fast transmission rates when you’re uploading files, you’re probably better off
with DSL, if available in your area. In the plus column, however, a cable modem is usually
more affordable than other high-speed options.

Not all cable companies provide Internet access, although many are in the

Once you’re connected via a cable modem (and we’ll look at getting connected next),
data between your computer and the Internet travels along the following path:
• The coaxial cable that comes into your home or office from a pole is divided into two
connections by a splitter. One connection goes to your TV, and the other goes to your
cable modem, a little box that is external to your computer.

Chapter 2

Chapter 2   Connecting to the Internet
29

• The cable modem connects to the network card inside your computer or to the USB
adapter on your computer. Data traveling to your computer from the Internet goes
through the coaxial cable, through your cable modem, and into your computer. Data
traveling from your computer to the Internet follow this path in reverse.
• Once data is inside the coaxial cable, its next stop is a node, which is also the next
spot on the route for cable television signals. Each cable company divides its region
into nodes, or neighborhoods of about 500 subscribers. All 500 subscribers share one
node, which can become a bottleneck if all access the Internet at the same time.
• From the node, data passes through high-speed fiber-optic lines to a head-end cable
facility, which handles the nodes for some four to ten regions.
• The head end accesses the Internet by means of high-speed links, and the head end
also has high-speed Internet servers for mail, newsgroups, the Web, and so on. Thus,
as we mentioned in Chapter 1, your cable company becomes your ISP as well as your
connection to the Internet.

The most difficult part of getting connected via cable modem may be getting your cable
company to actually come to your home or place of business in a timely fashion. That
said, once a technician arrives on the premises, he or she will fiddle with the main cable
a bit, attach the splitter, and then run the cable to the cable modem.
If your computer already has a network card, the technician will attach the cable modem
to the network card with another cable. If your computer doesn’t have a network card, the
cable company will probably provide one and configure it—perhaps for an additional fee.
The technician should then configure your network settings, and he or she may install
some authentication software on your computer. And that’s it. You can now do a couple
of things—you can log on to the Internet, or you can call your telephone company and
cancel the second line you’ve been using for Internet access, if you had one.

as you do with an analog modem. Consequently, your computer system
is vulnerable to the possibility of unauthorized access. Be sure that you
require passwords to any shared resources, and install firewall software.
You can check with your cable service provider for firewall software, or
you can get firewall software from companies such as Sybergen Networks

Another popular high-speed option is a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) modem. DSL
comes in two basic flavors—asymmetric and symmetric. DSL service providers often
refer to asymmetric DSL as “home” DSL and refer to symmetric DSL as “business” DSL.
Here’s why. With asymmetric DSL, download speeds are much faster than upload
speeds, which means that you can access a Web page at much higher speeds than you
can transmit a document over e-mail. Service providers seem to have collectively decided
that home users access Web resources much more often than they transfer files, and so
they deem asymmetric DSL the most appropriate for home use. Asymmetric DSL is
also usually a good deal cheaper than symmetric DSL.
With symmetric DSL, upload and download speeds are the same, and the more you
are willing to pay, the faster the speed. For example, at our ISP, asymmetric DSL is
available for about $60 a month. This yields download rates of 640Kbps and upload
rates of 256Kbps. Symmetric DSL is available at speeds ranging from 144Kbps to
7Mbps (7000Kbps) and at prices ranging from about $100 a month to $400 a month.
The speed available to your home or office depends on location, as you will see shortly.

DSL uses your existing telephone lines, but transmits data at higher frequencies than
those used to transmit voice. Therefore, you can use your fax machine, your telephone,
or even a modem at the same time that you are accessing the Internet with your
computer.
The DSL modem attached to your computer must be the proper type for your DSL
provider, and the telephone company office (also called a central office) must be within
a certain distance of your home or office. The exact distance depends on the type of
DSL and the speed. For example, the DSL service provider we consulted informed us
that the maximum distance in our case is 18,000 feet. Unfortunately, the distance from
our office to the telephone company office is 18,500 feet, so we’re out of luck for the
time being.
A DSL modem is external to the computer and looks similar to a cable modem, only
it really isn’t a modem in the true sense of the word. A modem converts digital signals
to analog signals and vice versa. A so-called DSL modem transmits and receives all data
as digital signals.

Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is not a new technology, but it has
become a popular way to connect to the Internet for several reasons. For starters, it was
one of the first alternatives to the analog modem. It continues to be popular because
it is more universally available than other high-speed connections, though it tends to
be more expensive.

ISDN uses existing telephone wires and requires an ISDN modem. As is the case with
a DSL modem, an ISDN modem isn’t really a modem. Although it looks like one, it
is actually an adapter that lets you send and receive digital signals over ISDN phone
lines. For ISDN to work, the telephone company must have digital-switching
equipment.

The most common kind of ISDN access is called Basic Rate Interface (BRI). The ISDN
modem sends a digital signal over the telephone wire, which is divided into three
channels. A channel is not a wire but a way in which data travels. Two channels transmit
data, and the third channel sends routing information. Using ISDN, you can access the
Internet while talking on the phone over the same connection; thus, you can disconnect
the second phone line you might have been using for Internet access.

After contracting with your phone company for ISDN service, you need to install your
ISDN modem. The process is exactly the same as installing an analog modem, and if
the ISDN modem is Plug and Play (and it certainly should be), Windows will
recognize it and install the necessary driver.
To configure an ISDN modem, follow these steps:
1. Open the Network And Dial-Up Connections folder, as shown in Figure 2-7.

If all these high-speed options leave you wondering which is best for you, which
is fastest, and so on, here are some points to consider:
• The fastest analog modem transmits data at 53Kbps. DSL ranges from 144Kbps
to 7Mbps. Cable modem access generally peaks at 1 to 10Mbps, but during slow
times may be as slow as 256Kbps or slower, and ISDN access maximum access
speed is 128Kbps.
• With cable modems, DSL modems, and ISDN, you don’t need a second phone
line.
• With cable modems, you can’t use a separate ISP.
• ISDN is usually more expensive than the other high-speed options. Some
providers even charge by the minute, but if you want something faster than an
analog modem and neither DSL nor cable modem are available in your area,
ISDN may be your only choice.
• Cable modem speed can be impeded if all the subscribers in your so-called
neighborhood are simultaneously accessing the Internet.
• In some situations, you can start with a lower speed DSL connection and
upgrade to a higher speed.
• Cable modems and DSL modems are always on. You need to question your
service provider about the security risks this poses.

but as far as Internet Connection Sharing is concerned an “application” is one of the
TCP/IP family of protocols that we mentioned in Chapter 1. To share your Internet
applications such as Internet Explorer and Outlook Express, you enter a friendly name
for the application and its sending and receiving port numbers. A port is simply a number
that identifies a connection point for a protocol, and standard port numbers are assigned
to all Internet (TCP/IP) protocols.

If you’re using a DSL adapter or a cable modem, there are two basic ways you can share
your Internet connection. The easiest method is to plug the DSL adapter or cable
modem into your network hub. Alternatively, you can add a second network card to your
computer and use Internet Connection-Sharing to share the connection as if it were
a dial-up connection.

If you have a DSL router or cable modem that provides built-in Network Address
Translation (NAT) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) services, it’s
really easy to share your connection. Simply plug your DSL adapter or cable modem
into the Uplink port of your hub using an Ethernet crossover cable (this is the cable
you’d normally plug into your computer). Once you configure all of your computers
to use dynamically assigned addresses (as described in the “Setting Up Clients” section
earlier in this chapter), you’re done.
If your DSL adapter or cable modem doesn’t provide NAT and DHCP services, you
have two options. You can rent more IP addresses from your ISP (usually at $5/month
for each IP address) and configure each of your computers to use these addresses. Or
you can purchase a DSL/Cable Modem Router. Plug your DSL adapter or cable modem
into the DSL/Cable Modem Router and plug all your computers into this router if
there are enough ports. If there aren’t enough ports on the router, plug the router into
the uplink port of your hub using a crossover cable. Configure all computers to use
dynamically assigned addresses.

When you connect to a LAN at your place of business, you are probably connecting
to a client/server network. If you are running Windows 2000 Professional on your
desktop, you could be connecting to Windows 2000 Server or Windows NT 4 Server.
When your computer starts, you’ll see a message that network communications are
being established. You can then log on to the system as described in Chapter 1.
But you can also log on to that LAN from your home network or while you’re on the
road, and you can do so in the following ways:
• Over a phone line
• Using ISDN
• Through a VPN tunnel
Connecting in this way is called remote access.

Perhaps the most common way to access a remote network is by modem. To do this most
successfully, you’ll first want to make sure that your modem and the modem at the
office are compatible. Of course, you also need the permission to establish this
connection. For security reasons, some corporations don’t allow remote access to the
system, but as more and more people telecommute, this is becoming less common.
To set up a dial-up connection, obtain the phone number you need to dial in to and
then follow these steps:
1. Open the Network And Dial-Up Connections folder, as shown in Figure 2-22.

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, and it is a tunnel through the Internet that
connects your computer to your corporate network. You can dial up almost any ISP and
set up a VPN session. Data that is transmitted via the VPN tunnel is encrypted, so it
is secure.
To set up a VPN connection, you will need the host name or IP address of your cor-
porate network, which you can obtain from your system administrator if you don’t know
it. Follow these steps to set up the connection:
1. Open the Network And Dial-Up Connections folder.
Click the Start button, click Settings, and then click Network And Dial-Up
Connections.
2. Start the Network Connection Wizard.
Click the Make New Connection icon.
3. Select a network connection type.
Click Next, and in the Network Connection Type screen, click the Connect To A
Private Network Through The Internet option. Click Next.
4. Specify whether to automatically dial your ISP.
In the Public Network screen, which is shown in Figure 2-27, click the Automatically
Dial This Initial Connection option if you want to establish a dial-up connection
to your ISP first before connecting to your corporate network. Otherwise, click Do
Not Dial The Initial Connection. Click Next.

Click Next.
6. Specify who can use this connection.
In the Connection Availability screen, click For All Users or Only For Myself, and
then click Next.
7. Name the connection.
Enter a name for this connection, which will appear in the Network And Dial-Up
Connections folder, and then click Finish.
If you want to connect immediately, click Yes in the Initial Connection dialog box that
now appears. If you want to connect later, click No. To connect at any time, click the
icon for this connection in the Network And Dial-Up Connections folder.
To delete a connection, select its icon and press the Delete key.
You can copy the connections you made for modem, ISDN, or VPN by right-clicking
the connection and choosing Create Copy from the shortcut menu. You can then right-
click the copy, and choose Properties from the shortcut menu to modify the connec-
tion for a particular situation.

s you learned in Chapter 1, to access resources on the World Wide Web you need
 a client program called a Web browser. The Web browser’s primary job is to let
you view Web pages and move from one resource to another, although these days most
browsers provide much more functionality than that.
As you also saw in Chapter 1, the first really popular browser was Netscape Navigator.
Appendix A discusses and describes how to use that browser. In this chapter, we focus
on Microsoft Internet Explorer, the Web browser that’s included with all current
versions of Microsoft Windows, which, of course, has been at the core of Microsoft’s
antitrust trial.

As of this writing, Internet Explorer exists in several versions, including versions
for Windows 2000, Windows 95/98/ME, early versions of Windows, for Unix,
and for the Macintosh. To some extent, they all work in much the same way.
The steps and the illustrations in this chapter use version 5.00.2920.0000, the
version of Internet Explorer that is included with Windows 2000 Professional.

Before getting into Internet Explorer specifics, we want to explain how a Web browser
works. You don’t need this information to use a Web browser, of course, but knowing
the process will help you understand why access is sometimes slow, give you a clue as
to the meaning of some of the cryptic messages you sometimes see on your screen, and,
in general, help you to become a more informed business user of the Internet.
When you enter a Web address in the Web browser application on your computer, here
is a general overview of what happens:
• The browser software on your computer sends the address to your Internet service
provider (ISP).
• Your ISP then sends the address to the nearest node of the domain name server
(DNS). The DNS is a set of databases, distributed among servers, that stores the
numeric addresses of Web sites. (A later section in this chapter explains URLs and
numeric addresses.)
• The DNS returns the site’s numeric address to your Web browser.
• Your Web browser sends the numeric address to a router, which checks the traffic
on the Internet and finds a path that is the least busy to the server that contains the
resource you are requesting.
• The server receives the address, acknowledges this receipt, and places the request in
a queue to wait until the server fulfills earlier requests. When the server acknowl-
edges the receipt, you’ll see a message in the browser’s status line that tells you the
connection is successful.
• The server then sends the resource back over the Internet to your ISP, which then
sends it to your computer.

This process may sound time-consuming, but even with a slow Internet connection,
it can take only seconds, and with a fast Internet connection, it can happen almost
instantaneously, whether the resource is stored on a server halfway around the world
or on a server in the next building in your office complex.

• Double-click the Internet Explorer shortcut on the desktop.
• Click the Start button, click Programs, and then click Internet Explorer.
The first time you open Internet Explorer, you’ll see something similar to Figure 3-1,
which shows the MSN page. You can retain this start page or select any other. You’ll find
the steps later in this chapter.

You can also open Internet Explorer from any document that includes a hyperlink. For
example, if you receive an e-mail message that contains a URL in the body, simply click
the URL to open that page in Internet Explorer. In addition, in Windows Explorer,
clicking a filename that ends in .htm or .html opens that file in Internet Explorer.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the programming language that is

ord About URLs
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and is an address for a resource on the
Internet. It actually represents a string of numbers called an Internet Protocol (IP)
address, for example, 169.254.69.104. Since it’s much easier for humans to remem-
ber names instead of numbers, we typically use URLs.
A URL is composed of a protocol, the name of the server on which the resource resides,
and, optionally, the path to the resource and its filename. For example, in the URL
http://www.redtechpress.com, http is the protocol (in this case, Hypertext Transfer
Protocol), www indicates that the resource is on the World Wide Web, redtechpress is
the server, and .com is the domain name. Such a URL might also include the path, such
as /catalog, and the name of a document, such as /index.html. You frequently see URLs
in various media as simply www.redtechpress.com. Internet Explorer and other Web
browsers assume the http protocol unless you specify otherwise. Another less frequently
seen protocol is the File Transfer Protocol (FTP); an FTP server contains programs
and files that users can download.
The final part of the server name, in our example, .com, refers to the domain type. At
present seven domain types are recognized:
• .com is a commercial organization.
• .edu is an educational institution, for example, a university.
• .gov is an entity that is part of the U.S. government.
• .int is an international organization, such as the United Nations.
• .mil is a branch of the U.S. military.
• .net is a network organization.
• .org is a nonprofit organization.

You pronounce the domain part of a URL as dot com, dot e-d-u, dot gov, and so on.
You have, no doubt, though seen references to dot-coms, which are businesses that in
recent years have sprung up on the Internet. These are not simply businesses that have
a Web site, but businesses that exist entirely on the Internet.
Mid-2000 found many dot-coms in trouble, and Forrester Research, a leader in compiling
Internet and business statistics, predicted that by 2001 most dot-coms would go out of
business. The reason, according to some dot-com CEOs, is that the focus was on acquiring
an audience at all costs—regardless of the costs.
The Internet is a seductive medium, but it’s probably safe to assume that there’s no
substitute for a well-designed and carefully thought-out business plan.

The components of the Internet Explorer window are much like those in other
Windows applications. You’ll see vertical and horizontal scroll bars as necessary, you
can size portions of the window by clicking and dragging, and you can display a
ScreenTip by pointing to a button. Here is a list of some other components:
• The Title bar is at the top of the window, and it displays the name of the current
Web page or other file that is open.
• The Menu bar is just beneath the Title bar, and it contains a set of menus, many of
which appear in other Windows applications.
• The Standard Buttons toolbar is just beneath the Menu bar, and it contains several
buttons that correspond to items on the Menu bar, as well as the Back, Forward, and
Home navigation buttons.
• The Address bar is beneath the Standard toolbar, and you use it to enter a URL or
filename. You can also click the drop-down arrow to select a URL.
• The Links bar is a drop-down list on the far right of the Address bar, and it contains
a short list of preselected hyperlinks. You can add or remove links from this list.
• The Activity Indicator is at the far right of the Menu bar and is animated when
Internet Explorer is sending or receiving data.
• The Main window displays the resource you most recently accessed.

• The Status bar is at the bottom of the screen. When you choose a menu command,
the Status bar displays a description of what it does. When you point to a link, the
Status bar displays its URL. When you click a link, the Status bar displays a series
of messages related to the progress of finding and opening that resource.
• The Security zone is at the far right of the Status bar and displays the currently active
security zone. We’ll discuss Security zones in detail later in this chapter.

You’ll notice that sometimes when you start to enter a URL, it sort of completes itself
for you. This is the AutoComplete feature at work. If AutoComplete enters the URL
you want, simply press the Enter key to go to that resource. If not, continue typing.
AutoComplete also works in other fields you fill in on a Web page, such as search
queries, a list of stock quotes, information you supply when you purchase items over the
Internet, and so on. This feature can be handy, and you need not worry about security
when you use AutoComplete. The information you originally enter is encrypted (encoded)
and stored on your computer. It is not accessible to Web sites. (Sometimes you’ll even see
the encryption displayed on your screen before the information is sent out.)

A handy trick you can use to quickly go to a Web site that begins with www
and ends in .com is to enter just the main part of the name (such as microsoft)
and then press Ctrl+Enter. This fills in the www and .com for you.
If you’ve entered a URL (perhaps a lengthy one) and then want to use only part of it
to try to access a resource, place the cursor in the Address bar, hold down the Ctrl key,
and press the right or left arrow key to jump forward or backward to the next
separator character (the slashes, the dots, and so on).

You can use the Address bar to do more than find a resource on the Internet. You can
also run a program from the Address bar (for example, type C:\Program
Files\NetMeeting\conf ), and you can find a file. For example, if you enter a drive let-
ter (such as d:\) and press the Enter key, you’ll see something similar to Figure 3-2. You
can click a folder to open subfolders and files.

A hyperlink, or simply link, can be a word, a phrase, an image, or a symbol that forms
a connection with a resource that can be located on your local computer, your local
network, or the Internet. In Internet Explorer, textual links are usually underlined and
in a different color from normal text. You know something is a link if the pointer
becomes a hand with a pointing finger when you place the mouse cursor over it.

To follow a link, of course, you simply click it. If you find something you know you’ll
want to revisit, you can place a link to it on the Links bar, or you can add it to your
Favorites list, which we’ll discuss next. To add a link to the Links bar, simply drag it
there. To remove a link from the Links bar, right-click it and choose Delete from the
shortcut menu. To rearrange items on the Links bar, drag an item to a new location.
By default, the Links bar contains the following links:
• Customize Links, which opens a page on the Microsoft Web site that contains
information about how to add, remove, and rearrange items on the Links bar.
• Free Hotmail, which opens a Web page where you can sign up for an e-mail account.

specify whether you want to find a Web page, a person’s address, a business, a map, a
picture, and so on.

Before we get into all the options you can apply to a search, let’s do a simple search.
Although you may be annoyed by all the ad banners on Web pages, you may also find
that the Internet is an effective marketing medium for your business products or ser-
vices. Let’s search for resources that might give us some information about advertising
on the Internet. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Open the Search bar, as shown in Figure 3-11.
Click the Search button.
Figure 3-11
Opening the Search bar.
2. Enter a search phrase.
In the Find A Web Page Containing box, type “advertising on the Internet”. (Type
the quotation marks but not the period. Using quotation marks like this says to find
resources that contain the phrase, not just pages that contain all the words.) Click
Search. Figure 3-12 shows the results of the search.

The fastest way to perform a search is to enter the word find in the Address

A cookie is a file that is stored on your computer by the server of a site that you visit.
A cookie is a simple data file that identifies you to the server. When you revisit the site,
the cookie can be used to welcome you by name or to present you with a customized
version of the page. Cookies are also used to make online shopping carts work. A cookie
cannot see what’s on your hard drive or local network, nor can it send any other infor-
mation back to the server or run other programs on your computer.

MBA’s Guide to the Internet - Electronic Edition
A temporary Internet file is a copy of a Web page that you have visited and is stored
in the Temporary Internet Files folder on your hard drive, along with your cookies.
When you access a site that you’ve visited before, Internet Explorer first checks to see
whether the page is in your Temporary Internet Files folder. If it is, Internet Explorer
then checks to see whether the page has been updated since being stored. If the page
has not been updated, Internet Explorer opens it from your Temporary Internet Files
folder (also called the cache), which is obviously faster than loading the page from the
server.
You can check out what’s been stored in your Internet Files folder and empty it any
time you want. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Open the Internet Options dialog box.
Click the Tools menu, and then click Internet Options.
2. Open the Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-16.
Click the General tab, and then click the Settings button.

Customizing Internet Explorer
Already in this chapter, you’ve seen a few ways that you can change the default settings
for Internet Explorer. You can, however, customize Internet Explorer in many other ways.
For example, you can specify a different start page, specify particular colors for text and
background, set the security level, change your Internet connection, and so on.
To do any of this, you open a dialog box that is called either Internet Options or Internet
Properties. In Internet Explorer, clicking the Tools menu and then clicking Internet
Options opens the Internet Options dialog box. In Control Panel, clicking the Internet
Options icon opens the Internet Properties dialog box. Both dialog boxes contain exactly
the same tabs and the same options. In this section, we’ll open the dialog box from within
Internet Explorer, so the illustrations will show the Internet Options dialog box.

As you saw earlier in this chapter, by default Internet Explorer opens the MSN home
page when you open Internet Explorer. To specify a different Web site as your start
page, follow these steps:
1. Open the Internet Options dialog box.
Click the Tools menu, and then click Internet Options.
2. Specify the current page or a blank page.
Open the Web site, open the Internet Options dialog box, and then click Use
Current, or enter a URL in the Address box. To specify a blank page, simply click
Use Blank. Click OK, or click Apply.
In the previous section, you saw how to open your Temporary Internet Files folder and
delete those files and cookies, if you want. To change the settings for this folder, click
the Settings button to open the Settings dialog box (see Figure 3-16).
In the top section, specify whether and when you want Internet Explorer to check the
Temporary Internet Files folder before making a trip to the server for a resource. To
change the location of your Temporary Internet Files folder, follow these steps:
1. Open the Browse For Folder dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-19.
Click the Move Folder button.

Sometimes when you open a Web page, a small program is needed to display the page.
These programs are stored in your Downloaded Program Files folder. To view this folder,
click the View Objects button. If you want to delete one of these programs, right-click
it, and choose Delete from the shortcut menu. Remember, though, that some pages
might not be fully functional without the program.
Earlier in this chapter, we looked at how to use the History list to access pages you’ve
visited previously. To specify how long to keep pages in history, use the spin box in the
History section of the General tab. To empty the History list, click the Clear History
button.
The creator of a Web page usually specifies the colors used on the page, otherwise
Internet Explorer automatically uses your Windows color scheme to display the page.
For pages that the developer has not specified colors or fonts, you can specify what you
want. To specify colors for text, background, visited links, unvisited links, and the hover
color, click the Colors button to open the Colors dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-20.

Establishing Security Levels for Zones
Internet Explorer establishes four Security zones, and you can set the security level you
want for each zone, using the Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box, which
is shown in Figure 3-23.
Figure 3-23
The Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box.
Each zone pertains to specific kinds of sites:
• The Internet zone applies to all sites not specified in the other three zones. By default,
its security level is set to Medium. (We’ll explain these levels shortly.)
• The Local Intranet zone applies to sites you can access on your corporate intranet,
if you have one. By default, its security level is set to Medium-Low.
• The Trusted Sites zone applies to Web sites that you are confident will not send you
potentially damaging content. By default, its security level is set to Low.
• The Restricted Sites zone applies to sites that you visit but that you do not trust to
not send you potentially damaging content. By default, its security level is set to High.
To add sites to any zone but the Internet zone, follow these steps:

3. Add a site to the Restricted Sites zone.
Select the Restricted Sites icon, and click the Sites button to open the Restricted
Sites dialog box, which contains the same options as the Trusted Sites dialog box
shown in Figure 3-25.
To change the security level for a zone, select the zone and then move the slider bar.
You have the following choices:
• High is the safest setting but also the most restrictive. Less secure features are dis-
abled, including cookies, so you will not have access to all the features of a Web page.
• Medium is the next safest setting, and it allows more functionality. You are prompted
before you download content that Internet Explorer considers potentially unsafe.
• Medium-Low is basically the same as the Medium setting, but you are not prompted
before you download potentially unsafe content.
• Low is most appropriate for sites that you know you can trust. You are not prompted
when downloading most content.
To establish a custom security level, click the Custom Level button to open the Secu-
rity Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-26. Click an option button to disable
or enable an item or to specify that you be prompted before downloading a particular
item, and then click OK.

To specify the content that can be viewed on your computer, to manage digital certifi-
cates, and to configure AutoComplete and set up a personal profile, you use the Con-
tent tab in the Internet Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-27.
Figure 3-27
The Content tab in the Internet Options dialog box.
The Content Advisor is a feature that you can use to prevent access to certain sites that
you consider inappropriate in your environment. By default, Content Advisor is set to
the most conservative level; that is, if Content Advisor is enabled, you will be able to
access only those sites that contain content that is the least likely to be offensive. To
change this setting, you enable Content Advisor and then set up new viewing criteria.
Of course, if Content Advisor is not enabled, your access is in no way restricted.
To enable the Content Advisor, follow these steps:
1. Establish a password.
Click the Enable button to open the Supervisor Password Required dialog box, as
shown in Figure 3-28. Enter a password in the Password field, and click OK. Now,
anyone who wants to change the settings you specify must enter the password.

The ratings system in effect in Internet Explorer is that established by the Recreational
Software Advisory Council and goes by the abbreviation RSACi. It is based on a system
known as the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS). If Content Advisor is
enabled and if you have set various rating levels, Internet Explorer first reads any PICS
rating codes it finds in a page before opening that page. If the PICS rating exceeds the
limit you’ve established, Internet Explorer does not open the page. To set a level for lan-
guage, nudity, sex, or violence, select the category in the Ratings tab in the Content Advisor
dialog box and then move the slider. You use the other three tabs in the Content
Advisor dialog box to do the following:

prevent employees from accessing games sites, gaming sites, and so on.
• Click the General tab to specify that users can view unrated sites and that the supervisor
can enter a password to let users view restricted content, to change the
supervisor password, and to customize the rating system.
• Click the Advanced tab to view or modify the list of organizations that provide rating

A  digital certificate is an electronic credential that verifies that you are who you say
you are when connected to the Internet. Digital certificates are also used to guarantee
the identity of a Web site or a downloaded program. You can acquire a digital certifi-
cate from a certificate publisher. One of the most popular is VeriSign, Inc., which you
can find at http://www.verisign.com. To manage the digital certificates installed on your
system and to specify certain software publishers as trustworthy, use the Certificates
section of the Content tab.
Earlier this chapter mentioned the AutoComplete feature, which comes to your aid
when you enter URLs. You can also use AutoComplete to automatically enter
information you commonly supply at certain Web sites. To configure AutoComplete,
click the AutoComplete button in the Content tab to open the AutoComplete
Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-30.

a Web site explicitly requests your personal information from the Profile Assistant (not
that many sites do yet), Internet Explorer displays the information the site is requesting
and asks your permission to send the information.

Of course, the most important thing about Internet Explorer is not how it works but
how you can use it to access the resources that make you a more informed and better-
equipped businessperson. You can certainly just point and click to your heart’s desire,
but you’ll soon find yourself off track and probably wasting a good bit of time. Using
the techniques described in this chapter, you can, for example, click a site from your
Favorites list to go immediately to a site whose data you need to check every day or
perhaps even more often (such as stock prices or weather conditions). You can quickly
search for and find Web sites, business names and addresses, and all sorts of other
business resources, and you can save the file, print it, and send it to a colleague or a client.
You won’t necessarily need to do all of these things every day, but you can refer to this
chapter when a specific task presents itself.

P
erhaps even more than the Web, electronic mail has become an essential business
tool. Before the Internet was available commercially, we worked at companies that
provided internal e-mail programs, and with all the right connections, you could
access your office e-mail account from home. Within days, most new employees were
so dependent on the e-mail system that they ceased to function if the server went down.
And that was small potatoes compared with how the business world now relies on the
Internet for e-mail.

Some business users consider e-mail both a blessing and a curse, and at the end of this
chapter, you’ll find some ideas about how to manage e-mail (and other components of
your electronic office) rather than letting it manage you.
In this chapter, we look at how to use Microsoft Outlook Express, the e-mail program
that’s included with the most recent versions of Microsoft Windows. Outlook Express
is an Internet standards e-mail reader, which means that you can use it to send and
receive e-mail if you have an Internet e-mail account. An e-mail account is not the same
thing as an account with an online information service such as CompuServe or America
Online. An Internet e-mail account provides services such as standards-based e-mail
but does not provide services such as chat rooms, access to databases, conferences, and
so on.
These days most ISPs provide you with an e-mail account as well as access to the Web.
Before you can use Outlook Express to send and receive e-mail, you need to configure
your e-mail account using the Internet Connection Wizard by following the instructions
in Chapter 2.
NOTE

This chapter uses the version of Outlook Express that is included with Windows
2000 Professional for illustrations and for describing the steps to accomplish
tasks. If you have Outlook Express running on an earlier version of Windows or
on some other operating system, the screens will look much the same, and the
steps will be similar, although not identical.

As Chapter 3 mentioned, you don’t need to understand how a Web browser works to
use it, and you don’t need to understand how e-mail works to use an e-mail program
to send and receive messages. But if you know in general the steps involved in getting
a message from your computer to another computer on the Internet, you’ll become a
more informed business user, and you’ll have an idea of what’s going on when you see,
for example, a message that says “POP server unavailable.”
After you create an e-mail message and click the Send button, your message travels the
following route to get to its intended recipient:
• Your e-mail program, such as Outlook Express, contacts your ISP’s computer and
connects to an SMTP server program. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol. The server program acknowledges that it has been contacted, and your e-mail

program tells the server that it has a message it wants to send. The server program then
says to send the message or to wait because it is busy.
• If it gets the green light, your e-mail program sends the message to the SMTP server
and asks for confirmation.
• The server confirms that it has received the message and then asks the domain name
server for the best path through the Internet to the intended recipient.
• The domain name server replies with the best path, and the SMTP server sends the
message on its way.
• When the message arrives at the recipient’s SMTP server, it is transferred to a Post
Office Protocol (POP) server, Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) server, or
HTTP mail server (such as Hotmail), which holds the message until the recipient
requests it.
• When your recipient logs on to the Internet, opens his or her e-mail program, and
checks for new mail, the message is downloaded to the recipient’s computer.
Although this process sounds very involved, and technically it is, it can happen very
quickly. We live in the United States and exchange messages with a colleague in Greece
in a matter of minutes.
One exception to the process outlined earlier is America Online (AOL), the largest ISP
in the United States. AOL uses proprietary protocols instead of the SMTP and POP
protocols and then uses a gateway to translate the proprietary protocols into the
standard e-mail protocols so that AOL users and users of standard e-mail programs can
communicate. (A gateway is simply a software device that both transfers and converts
information that originates from systems using different communication protocols, or
rules.)

This window contains the usual Windows Menu bar and toolbar. The Folders list is a
tool for organizing messages and contains the following folders by default, although, as
you will see, you can add your own folders to this list:
• The Inbox folder is the repository for newly received messages and messages that you
haven’t disposed of in some way.
• The Outbox folder contains messages that are ready to be sent.
• The Sent Items folder contains copies of messages that you have sent.
• The Deleted Items folder contains copies of messages that you have deleted. In other
words, unless you tell Outlook Express to do otherwise, messages that you delete are
not immediately removed but are placed in the Deleted Items folder.

If you are connected to the Internet, Outlook Express will automatically check the mail
server for new messages and download them to your Inbox folder when you open
Outlook Express. Thereafter, Outlook Express will check for new messages every 30
minutes as along as you are still connected to the Internet. If you want to check for
messages more often or less frequently, follow these steps:
1. Open the Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Click the Tools menu, and then click Options.

To save a message in an Outlook Express folder, simply drag its header to the folder.
You can also create your own folders. For example, you might want to create a folder
for a project and then place all correspondence related to that project in that folder. Or
you might want to create a folder for a person and place all messages from that person
in that folder. To create a new Outlook Express folder, follow these steps:

Although some of us may have a Pavlovian reaction to the mail notification alert, you
don’t need to read and process every message the instant it arrives in your Inbox. When
you’re checking mail, you can mark messages so that when you have time you can go
back and deal with them. You can mark messages in the following ways:

• If you’ve read a message but want to read it again later and respond, you can mark
it as unread. Select the message header, click the Edit menu, and then click Mark As

To reply to a message from a single sender, you simply click the Reply button on the
toolbar. If the message was sent to multiple recipients, you can reply to them as well
as the sender by clicking the Reply All button. By default, Outlook Express places all
the names of those you reply to in your Address Book—a quick and easy way to store
e-mail addresses.
By default, Outlook Express includes the text of the original message in your reply.
Sometimes this can be helpful, and at other times it can be a real nuisance, especially
if you have to wade through several replies to get to the essence of the message. You have
a couple of alternatives if you don’t want the original message included in the reply:
• Click the Reply button, place your cursor in the body of the message, click the Edit
menu, click Select All to highlight the message, and press the Delete key.
• Click the Tools menu, click Options to open the Options dialog box, click the Send
tab, clear the Include Message In Reply check box, and click OK. Now, the message
will never automatically be included in the reply.

Sometimes it’s handy to forward a message, and you can include your own comments
in the forwarded message as well. As is the case with passing along anything that was
created by somebody else, be sure that forwarding a message will not infringe on the
original sender. Of course, some people maintain that you should never put anything
in an e-mail message that you wouldn’t want to see on the front page of the newspaper,
and we’ll discuss security and privacy in Chapter 7.
To forward a message, open it, click the Forward button, enter an e-mail address, add
your comments if you want, and click the Send button.

You can create a message in two formats: plain text and HTML. By default, Outlook
Express uses HTML. As you’ll see in the next section, not all e-mail programs can deal
with HTML messages, so you’ll want to use that with caution. To compose and send
a message in plain text, follow these steps:
1. Open the New Message window, as shown in Figure 4-7.

and select the address. Follow the same procedure to copy someone on the message.
To send a blind carbon copy of the message, click the Cc icon to open the Select

a subject in the Subject line, place the cursor in the message body, and type your

4. Send the message.
Click the Send button.
By default, messages are sent immediately if you are connected to the Internet. If you
want to wait and send a message later, click the File menu, and click Send Later. This
places your message in the Outbox folder, and it is sent when you click the Send/Recv
button. If you create messages offline (that is, when you aren’t connected to the Internet),
your messages are also stored in the Outbox folder.

Using HTML
When you use HTML to create a message, you are essentially creating a Web page, and
you can include several neat effects, such as a background color or image, sound, and
so on. The drawback, as we mentioned earlier, is that not all e-mail programs can deal
with these Web pages, including most handheld devices, America Online and the
freeware version of Qualcomm Eudora. Before you send someone a message that includes
pictures and other HTML elements, send that person a plain text message and ask
whether he or she can read HTML messages.
When you open the New Message window and see the Formatting toolbar (see
Figure 4-7), you know you’re set up to compose a message in HTML. The Formatting
toolbar contains many of the tools you see and use in your word processor. You can use
it to do the following, among other things, in your message:

Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned that you can save files that are attached to mes-
sages. Obviously, you can also attach files to messages. Before getting into the details,
though, we need to remind you that some serious computer viruses make the rounds
via attachments to e-mail. Many businesses would cease to function these days if they
couldn’t e-mail files to colleagues and clients, so abandoning the use of file attachments
is not an option. To be on the safe side, we recommend not opening an attachment if

we’d say to be particularly wary of an attachment that appears to have been forwarded,

When you receive a message that has a file attached to it, you’ll see a paper-clip icon
preceding the header. When you open the message, you’ll see the filename of the at-
tachment in the Attach line. If the file is in a format that a program on your computer
can read, simply double-click the filename of the attachment to open it. To save the
attachment, follow these steps:
1. Open the Save Attachments dialog box.
Click the File menu, and click Save Attachments.
2. Save the file.
In the Save To box, specify a folder into which to save the file, and click the Save

Many people never bother to sign their e-mail messages. After all, their name appears
in the From line. Others create elaborate signatures that are automatically appended
to all messages. Your business or organization may, in fact, have guidelines about what
you should include in a signature. It’s common to include your name, title, the name
of your organization, perhaps its physical address, and your phone number.
To create a signature that is automatically appended to all your messages, follow these
steps:
1. Open the Options dialog box.
Click the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Signatures tab, as shown in
Figure 4-11.

You are not at the mercy of your Inbox. You can choose to block mail from certain
senders, and you can route mail from other senders directly to a folder. To do any of
this, you use the Message Rules dialog box. Using the options in this dialog box, you
can get very detailed about how you filter messages. We’ll take a look at the steps for
blocking messages entirely from certain senders and for routing messages from a par-
ticular person to a folder, but you can apply these steps to establish many other mes-
sage rules.
To block messages from a particular sender, follow these steps:
1. Open the Message Rules dialog box at the Blocked Senders tab, as shown in
Figure 4-12.
Click the Tools menu, click Message Rules, and then click Blocked Senders.

An identity in Outlook Express is sort of an e-mail user profile. You’ll want to use
identities if more than one person uses your computer and thus also uses Outlook
Express. When you set up identities, each person sees only his or her e-mail messages
and has his or her own contacts in Address Book.
When you install Outlook Express, you are set up as the main identity. To set up other
identities, follow these steps:
1. Open the New Identity dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-17.
In the main Outlook Express window, click the File menu, click Identities, and then
click Add New Identity.
Figure 4-17

2. Specify a name and, optionally, a password for this identity.
In the Type Your Name box, enter a name for the new identity. If you want pass-
word protection enabled, click the Require A Password check box, which opens the
Enter Password dialog box. Type the password twice—once in the New Password
box and again in the Confirm New Password box—and then click OK.
The name of the new identity will appear in the Identities list in the Manage Iden-
tities dialog box, and you’ll be asked whether you want to switch to the new identity
now. If not, click No, and then click Close in the Manage Identities dialog box. The
first time you log on as the new identity, you’ll be asked for some information about
your Internet connection.
To switch from one identity to another, follow these steps:

If you want to control how Outlook Express responds to requests for read receipts that
you receive, use the options in the Returning Read Receipts section:
• Click Never Send A Read Receipt if you don’t want a read receipt sent even though
it was requested by the sender of a message.
• Click Notify Me For Each Read Receipt Request if you want to know that a read
receipt has been requested for a message. You can then decide whether to let the sender
know that you have received the message.
• By default, the Always Send A Read Receipt option is checked. The options in the
Returning Read Receipts section are mutually exclusive. You must select one of the
three options.
If you or the sender has a secure digital signature, you can specify that the signature
be verified by clicking the Secure Receipt button and configuring the options in the
Secure Receipt Options dialog box.

Earlier in this chapter, we looked at the differences between using plain text and HTML
formats for messages and how to specify one or the other in the New Message window.
You can also specify the format using the Send tab in the Options dialog box, as shown
in Figure 4-27.
Figure 4-27
The Send tab in the Options dialog box.
In addition, you can use the options in the Send tab to enable or disable the following
features:
• Save a copy of every message you send in the Sent Items folder. This option is
selected by default, and we suggest that you leave it that way. Having a record of what
you said when and to whom is always a good idea in any business situation.
• Bypass the Outbox folder and send messages immediately. Composing messages
offline and storing them in the Outbox folder was handy when we paid dearly for
online time by the minute. In these days of always-on connections and low-cost
unlimited connection time, it’s probably simpler and easier to just compose the
message and send it at once—unless you think you might want to edit it again before
you send it. In that case, you can store it in the Drafts folder.
• Always put the names of senders that you reply to in your Address Book. Again, this
option is enabled by default, and we suggest that you leave it that way. It’s much easier
to weed out your Address Book than it is to search for an e-mail address.

• Use AutoComplete for e-mail addresses. This is a handy feature, but even quicker
is selecting the address from your Address Book.
• Include the original message when you reply to a message. This option is enabled
by default, and if you ever want to do this, leave it enabled. Otherwise, you can’t
include the message in your reply. If you don’t want to include the message, it’s easy
to delete it from your reply. Simply place your cursor in the body of the message,
click the Edit menu, choose Select All, and then press Delete.
• If you receive messages in both plain text and HTML format, you can reply in the
format in which the messages were sent by enabling the last option in the Sending
section.

A business card that you create in Outlook Express is actually a vCard, an electronic
personal information card that you can exchange via e-mail. A vCard is an indus-
try standard format for sharing contact information including your name, address,
telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address.
To create a business card and attach it to all your messages, follow these steps:
1. Open Address Book.
Click Addresses in the toolbar in the Outlook Express Main window.
2. Create an entry for yourself.
Click the New button, and then click New Contact to open the Properties dialog
box. Fill in as much or as little information about yourself as you want to include
on your business card, and then click OK.
3. Save your business card to a file.
In the Address Book main window, select your name from the list, click the File
menu, click Export, and then click Business Card (vCard) to open the Export
Business Card dialog box. Save it in the location that Outlook Express suggests, or
choose another location and click Save. Close Address Book.
4. Specify that your business card be included in all outgoing messages.
Click the Tools menu, and then click Options to open the Options dialog box. Click
the Compose tab, click the Mail and News check boxes, and then click OK.
To attach a business card to a single message rather than to all messages, leave the Mail
and News check boxes blank, and in the New Message window, click the Insert menu,
and then click My Business Card.

Typically, e-mail messages get a bad reputation in the spelling, punctuation, and gram-
mar department, and for good reason. One of our business contacts even sends stream-
of-consciousness messages—they are in all lowercase letters, have no  punctuation, no
paragraph indications, contain a lot of abbreviations and misspelled words, and so on. Not
impressive from a business point of view, or from any point of view for that matter.

True, e-mail has developed as one of the most important communications tools ever
because it’s quick and easy, but in a business environment you want to apply the same
standards to e-mail that you apply to any other form of communication. You want to
portray a professional image, and you want your customers, colleagues, and other
contacts to trust you and your abilities.
At the very least, read through a message before you click the Send button. And if you
want to avoid embarrassing typos and misspelled words, select the option in the Spelling
tab of the Options dialog box to always check the spelling of a message before it is sent.
(As we mentioned earlier, you won’t have the Spelling tab unless you have an Office
application installed that contains the spell-checking feature.)
Figure 4-29 shows the Spelling tab. The options are, in general, those found in other
applications that can check spelling, but in addition you can also check Internet
addresses and the original message in a reply or a forward.

Do you ever wonder how you’d get by without the number of communications tools
you currently have at your disposal? Phone, voice mail, fax, e-mail, pagers, the Internet
and its vast supply of instant resources, even paper memos, reports, home-to-office
network connections—the list seems endless. Or, maybe instead you wonder how to get
your work done in the midst of all these tools.
A recent issue of Harvard Management Update, a newsletter put out by the publishing
arm of Harvard Business School, had some suggestions that we’ve adapted for inclusion
here. Not every suggestion is applicable to all situations, but among them you’re sure to
find some that will help you better manage the deluge of information that faces you in
your electronic office.

• You don’t have to read e-mail the instant you hear the you-have-mail alert. Some
business professionals set aside certain times each day to check e-mail. You don’t have
to be interrupted unless you want to be. If something is really urgent, the sender will
probably find another way to get in touch with you.
• You also don’t have to answer the phone just because it rings. You can let voice mail
pick it up and then respond at certain times during the day that let you give your
full attention to the matters at hand.
• Don’t open every e-mail message. If the subject line tells you that another get-rich-quick
scheme has just landed in your mailbox, press the Delete key. Agree with your colleagues
to use the priority symbols available in Outlook Express for things that are time-sensi-
tive.
• If an e-mail message looks interesting but you can tell that it isn’t essential, print it
out and read it later or flag it in some way.
• Instead of using e-mail for team projects, set up an intranet (an internal Internet)
or a newsgroup to which members can post messages.
• Take care of paper filing first, and then set up an electronic filing system for e-mail.
Create folders for projects, people, and so on, and be diligent about moving messages
into these folders.
• If you have tons of old messages lying around, just get rid of them. If you can’t bear
that thought, save them to a file somewhere.
• Multitask. Return phone calls while printing something, or check your paper organizer
while downloading a file from the Internet.
• Don’t waste time by following links that have nothing to do with the reason you’re
searching the Internet.
• Unsubscribe to newsletters you no longer need or never get around to reading.
(Chapter 6 discusses electronic newsletters and mailing lists.)
• Regularly evaluate your sources of information—journals, periodicals, reports, memos,
and so on—and discontinue all that are not essential. Be on the lookout for new
information sources that will keep you current.
• Set aside 5 to 10 minutes each day to learn something new about any of your electronic
tools.

A newsgroup is not an electronic gathering of people who meet to discuss current
events, but a collection of articles about a specific topic. The primary, but not only, source
of newsgroups is Usenet, a worldwide distributed discussion system consisting of
newsgroups with names that are classified hierarchically by topic. For example,
alt.business.accounting is, theoretically, a newsgroup that discusses accounting subjects
and practices. The first part of the name represents the largest hierarchical category, and
the name gets more specific from left to right. Table 5-1 lists the major top-level
newsgroup categories and explains what topics each discusses.

The major newsgroups.
In the previous paragraph, we used the word theoretically. In the early days of the
Internet, newsgroups and Usenet were widely supported by educators, academicians,
computer scientists, and other similar professionals. These days newsgroups seem to have
degenerated into venues for get-rich-quick schemes and for discussion of topics that
most of us in the business world would consider unseemly, whether at home or at work.
Thus, a caveat is in order. Some newsgroups are moderated, but most are not, and you
can find anything about anything in even the most unlikely of places. The value of
newsgroups to the business user is dubious, but this chapter includes a brief discussion
because of their historical importance to the development of the Internet and because
Outlook Express, in addition to being an e-mail reader, is also a newsreader.

With our earlier caveat in mind, enter a search term in the Display Newsgroups Which

Using Mailing Lists
Having been around since about 1975, mailing lists predate the commercialization of
the Internet, but if our personal observation is of any value, they seem to be more popular
than ever. A mailing list is simply an e-mail discussion group. As is the case with
newsgroups, there are mailing lists that cover just about any topic you can imagine. When
you join a list (referred to as subscribing), you receive all the e-mail messages that any
member of the group sends out. If you no longer want to receive these messages, you
simply drop out of the group by unsubscribing to the list.
In this section, we’ll start by giving you a bit of background information about how
mailing lists work. We’ll then look at exactly how to subscribe and unsubscribe, and
we’ll show you how to find mailing lists that are appropriate for your business use and
tell you how you can set up your own mailing list.

A mailing list is controlled by a list owner, who could be the person who started the
list or someone who took over the list from a previous owner. In most cases, the job of
list owner is not time-consuming or complicated because most of the work is done by
a mailing list program. Typically, the list owner is responsible for creating a message that
is sent to all new subscribers. This message explains the rules of the group, describes
any special features, and contains instructions about how to unsubscribe. Figure 5-8
shows the Welcome message we received when we subscribed to a list that deals with
how to publish your own e-mail newsletter, a topic we’ll discuss in Chapter 17.

Figure 5-8
A typical Welcome message.
In some cases, the list owner moderates the list, that is, he or she reads through all the
messages and determines the appropriateness of each one before allowing it to be sent
to all members of the group. Most mailing lists are not moderated, though, so as with
Web sites, chat rooms, newsgroups, and all sorts of other Internet resources, you may
encounter material that is personally offensive. If you find yourself in this situation, you
can register your complaint with the list members (only do so once you have a feel for
the group’s culture), or you can simply unsubscribe from the list.
The real work of managing a mailing list is done by a computer program, which ensures
that subscription and unsubscription requests are processed, distributes the messages to
all members of the list, and so on. Three mailing list programs are in common use:
• Listserv
• Listproc
• Majordomo
Developed in 1986 for mainframe IBM computers, Listserv is the oldest of these
mailing list programs. Listserv is short for list server. Listproc was developed to be the
Unix equivalent of Listserv; Listproc is short for list processor. Majordomo was not
developed until 1992, and it also was developed for computers running the Unix

operating system. The term majordomo refers to the person who manages the servants
in a large household, so the inference is that the program is managing the list service.
How you subscribe to and unsubscribe from a mailing list depends on which program
the mailing list uses.
Subscribing and Unsubscribing
Subscribing and Unsubscribing
Subscribing and Unsubscribing
Subscribing and Unsubscribing
Subscribing and Unsubscribing
Two addresses are important when you are communicating with a mailing list, and you
will find that sending information to the wrong list will make you very unpopular with
the list members. The subscription address is the address to which you send messages about
subscribing and unsubscribing. Such messages go only to the mailing list program.
The list address is the address to which you send messages that will be distributed to
everyone on the list. Now, you can see how sending a message to the wrong address can
get you into trouble, especially if the list includes a lot of people who send a lot of
messages. None of these people want to see your subscription request, and, of course,
if your subscription request doesn’t get to the mailing list program, you won’t be able
to access the messages.
To subscribe to a mailing list that is managed by Listserv or Listproc:
• Place the subscription address in the To line of your message.
• Leave the Subject line blank, or place anything you want in it.
• In the body of your message, type subscribe, the name of the list, your first name, and
your last name.
To subscribe to a mailing list that is managed by Majordomo:
• Place the subscription address in the To line of your message.
• Leave the Subject line blank, or place anything you want in it.
• In the body of your message, type subscribe, and then enter the name of the list.
To unsubscribe to a mailing list that is managed by Listserv, Listproc, or Majordomo:

Finding Business Mailing Lists
Well, now you know how mailing lists work and how to subscribe to and unsubscribe
from them, but you have no idea if you’d want to do so. What’s available that would
be of interest to the business user?
Fortunately, you’ll find lists of mailing lists on the Web, and you can even search
on a topic to locate a mailing list that is of interest to you. Let’s look at some of these.
For starters, take a look at Liszt, The Mailing List Directory, which you’ll find at
http://www.liszt.com. Figure 5-9 shows the home page.
Figure 5-9
The list of mailing lists at Liszt.
You can now enter a topic to search on, or you can browse the directory. An advantage
to this site, other than the enormous lists of mailing lists it references, is that when you
browse the directory, you’ll find a brief description of the list and instructions for
subscribing.

If a description includes the instruction to send list commands to a particular

In general, it’s considered imprudent to advertise on noncommercial mailing lists,
although you can certainly send mail to the group and find out if this would be offensive
to them. Liszt, however, also includes more than 600 commercial lists that you can
subscribe to or rent. For rental information, go to http://www.liszt.com/directmail.html.
If you create your own mailing list and want to add it to the list at the Liszt site, go
to http://www.liszt.com/submit.html.
Another source of mailing lists is Tile.Net/Lists at http://www.tile.net/lists, shown in
Figure 5-10. Although you can search the list of lists here by topic, and you can dis-
play lists by name, description, or domain, this site lacks the handy directory provided
at the Liszt site. If you create your own mailing list and want to add it to this list, go
to http://www.tile.net/lists/about.html.
Figure 5-10

To check out the list of official public Listserv mailing lists, go to the L-Soft site at
http://www.lsoft.com/lists/listref.html. Figure 5-11 shows the home page. At this site,
you can search for a list by topic and display lists by host country and by the number
of subscribers.

Mailing List Etiquette
First and foremost, if you subscribe to a mailing list that you read at your office,
remember that your activities can be monitored. Be sure that the list is appropriate
to your situation and that you use it as a professional. Here are some other guidelines
to keep in mind:
• Lurk before you post messages to the list. In this case, lurking is good manners
not bad. You need to get a sense of the group’s culture and style before you barge
in. If you find out that you don’t like the ambience, unsubscribe.
• Post only material that is related to the primary subject of the list. In most cases,
this rules out posting ads, make-money-fast schemes, sociological surveys, and
the like.
• If your e-mail program has a spelling checker, use it before you post a message.
• Don’t type in all capital letters; that is tantamount to shouting.

• Limit your use of common Internet abbreviations and smiley faces. Use only what
your readers will understand.
• If you want your signature to reflect your business association, do so, but be sure
that it’s in good taste and reasonably short. Normally, your name and e-mail
address is sufficient.
• Don’t post the same message to multiple lists. Because mailing lists are topically
oriented, most messages are not necessarily appropriate for multiple audiences.
In addition, some people subscribe to multiple mailing lists, and they will be
annoyed at seeing your message repeatedly.
• In most cases, quote the original message when you’re replying to a post. Doing
so gives the other list members a context for what you’re saying.
• Never forward a personal message to a mailing list unless you have the original
sender’s permission.
• Keep your sense of humor, and remember that a human being is attached to each
message that is posted.

After you peruse the lists of mailing lists and perhaps subscribe to a few that are
appropriate to your type of business, you may consider creating your own list. If you
don’t think you’re up to this or don’t have the time, check with your ISP. Many ISPs
provide this service for free or for a fee. Or, if you work on a corporate network, your
system administrator may be able to provide this service or point you to a consultant.
If you are interested in creating the list yourself, you can find all the details about the
process at http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8d/owner/owner.html. This is a page at the
L-Soft site that provides a manual for creating a mailing list with Listserv.
After you create your list, you need to find a site that will host it. Again, check with
your system administrator or ISP.

If you don’t mind being bombarded with advertising, you can subscribe to mailing lists
and create a mailing list at eGroups (http://www.egroups.com), as shown in Figure 5-12.
In this context, a mailing list is a group, and you subscribe to a mailing list by joining a
group. You can access the group at this Web site or via your e-mail program.

Mailing lists at eGroups.
Creating a mailing list is referred to as “starting a group.” To start a group, you simply use
the online form to describe it, categorize it, and add members by entering their e-mail
addresses. Using eGroups is free, but you do have to register and become a member.
You might also want to check out ListBot at http://www.listbot.com, which also provides
mailing list services. If you don’t mind the advertisements, you can use ListBot for free.
For an annual fee, you can use advertisement-free services.

Although newsgroups are a venerable Internet institution, we don’t find them particu-

you can check out the newsgroup scene for yourself. Mailing lists, on the other hand,
may be a useful communication tool, depending on the nature of your business and on
how Internet-savvy your clients, prospects, customers, and so on are.

T
he terms Web  and Internet are often used interchangeably, and we have done so
in this book, but technically they are not the same thing. The World Wide Web
is an Internet service that uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and as you
saw in Chapter 1, there are other Internet protocols that are used for e-mail and other
Internet services. In this chapter, we’re going to look at some of those other services as
well as some programs you can use to access remote computers, make phone calls, and
conference over the Internet.

Downloading Files with FTP
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is an Internet protocol that you can use to download files
from or upload files to an FTP site. The address of an FTP site starts with ftp.
Although you can use Internet Explorer to find and download files at an FTP site, it is
usually easier and faster to use special FTP client software. You can find such software
at many places on the Internet, including the ZDNet site at http://hotfiles.zdnet.com.
TIP
TIP
TIP
TIP
TIP
A particularly easy to use FTP client is CuteFTP, which you can download from
http://www.cuteftp.com/products/cuteftp. Whenever you run across FTP
information in the form of a URL, copy it to the Windows Clipboard. CuteFTP
will then connect to the server and log you in.
Here’s how FTP works:
• Using FTP client software, you connect to an FTP server on the Internet.
• Log on to the server with a user name and a password. Some FTP sites are private,
and you will need an authorized user name and password to access these sites. Other
sites are known as anonymous FTP sites because you can log on with the user name
of anonymous and use your e-mail address as the password.
• Browse through the available files. When you spot a file you want to download, use
the commands in your FTP client software to do so.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
For security reasons, you can normally only download files from anonymous
FTP sites; you cannot upload.
If you have large files that you need to transfer among disperse groups at your
company, you might want to consider setting up an FTP site. Transferring files with
FTP can be considerably faster than attaching them to an e-mail message. Consult your
technical professional for how to do this.
Figure 6-1 show the contents of an FTP site at Microsoft (ftp://ftp.microsoft.com). You
won’t find any banners and glitz at an FTP site, but you will be able to quickly find
and download information that you need.

Telnet is a terminal emulation protocol that you use to log on to another computer on
the Internet. Your computer actually becomes part of that computer, which is called
the host. Depending on your level of access, you can use the host’s services, memory
capacity, disk storage, and so on. In other words, your computer emulates a terminal
attached to the host computer.
To use Telnet, you need Telnet client software installed on your computer. You can find
Telnet client software on the Internet by using one of the search services described in
Chapter 8. Telnet has long been used in educational institutions to connect students
and teachers with resources such as a library or a bulletin board system. Today’s Telnet
software is even being used on palm-size computers to connect to a remote system and
check e-mail, transfer files, and talk to another person.

MBA’s Guide to the Internet - Electronic Edition
Here’s how Telnet works:
• Using your Telnet client software, enter the Internet address of the computer you
want to contact.
• The remote computer and your computer determine which type of terminal emu-
lation will be used. The most common type is VT-100. Terminal emulation ensures
that your keyboard and monitor will function as the host computer expects.
• Text that you type on your computer accumulates in a buffer until you press En-
ter. It is then sent to the host computer, along with the host’s Internet address and
your Internet address.
• The host computer then returns the data you requested or the results of a command
you sent.
NOTE
NOTE

VT-100 is one of a series of terminals that were manufactured by DEC. Many
communications and terminal-emulation programs emulate (mimic) the
VT-100.

To send and receive faxes at your computer, you need a fax modem. A fax modem can
be used to connect to the Internet and to send and receive faxes. If you acquired your
computer within the last couple of years, you probably do have a fax modem. To verify
that this is the case, open the Printers folder (click the Start button, click Settings, and
then click Printers). If you see a Fax icon, your modem is a fax modem.

Windows application that includes a Print menu. To set up the fax service for the first

Like Telnet, HyperTerminal is terminal emulation software, but unlike Telnet,
HyperTerminal is included with Windows. You need not buy any additional software
to run HyperTerminal; you simply set up HyperTerminal and use it.
HyperTerminal is text-based and is useful for connecting to public access servers,
especially those running operating systems other than Windows, and for running
text-based applications. In university settings, students and faculty often have
Windows computers, and the main computer system runs Unix. In this case, students
and faculty can use HyperTerminal to connect to the main Unix system and run Unix
applications. Typically, HyperTerminal is also used to connect to a bulletin board or
the catalog at a local library.

To chat or not to chat, that is a question. At the office, probably not, although you will
find a number of reputable business chat rooms on the Internet. Many require that you
register, and that means, at the least, providing your real name and your e-mail address,
which you may very well not want to do—we don’t.
For a list of sites that have or link to business chat rooms on the Internet, use one of
the search services described in Chapter 8 to search on business chat. The Excite
Education page has a list of business chat Web sites (go to http://www.excite.com/
education/reference/news_and_magazines/business/business_chat), and you’ll also find
some business chat rooms at Yahoo!. Some chat rooms are voice enabled, though you
can turn off this feature. We found it particularly annoying.
Although we have not made an exhaustive survey, we’re sorry to report that every time
we visited a so-called business chat room, we were less than pleased with the quality of
the conversation, and often the chat was interrupted by offensive personal advertisements.
You can, of course, judge for yourself.

Although most business users are somewhat familiar with e-mail and the Web, not
everyone is aware of the other services that you can use to become a more effective user
of the Internet. In this chapter, we’ve looked at FTP, Telnet, Fax, Phone Dialer,
HyperTerminal, and NetMeeting. You may find that you rarely use some of these
services and frequently use others.

T
hese days, the issue of privacy and security on the Internet is a hot-button topic,
ranking just below religion and politics. On the one hand, the Internet developed
as a means to share information, and from its earliest days, attempts to regulate it or in
any way censor or control it were met with the hostility usually reserved for a mortal
enemy. On the other hand, as we increasingly put our businesses, fortunes, and fami-
lies online, our concern about privacy and security is growing almost as fast as the
Internet.
The Internet Policy Institute is an independent, nonprofit research and educational
organization created to provide research and analysis on policy issues that affect the
Internet. Its “Briefing the President” project was created to inform the president of the
United States on the fundamental nature of the Internet and policy issues affecting the
Internet’s future. This project is a collection of papers written by knowledgeable pro-
fessionals, and it includes the publication “The Internet and Consumers: Privacy and
Security.” You can find this paper and others at http://www.internetpolicy.org. Here are
some highlights:

• The most recent survey by the Federal Trade Commission confirms that 92 percent
of Americans are concerned about the misuse of their personal information on the
Internet.
• Losses in online sales resulting from consumer apprehension are increasing, which
leads to the consensus that protecting privacy on the Internet is important for
businesses.
• The online industry has argued vigorously that it should remain free from govern-
ment regulation while it develops industry standards and enforcement mechanisms
to protect privacy online.
Our mission in this chapter is not to come down on any side of the controversies sur-
rounding this issue, but to ask and answer some questions about what’s really happening
when you access Internet resources and to suggest some ways that you can protect your
privacy and the integrity of your business when you are working online.

In this chapter we are looking at the issue of privacy and security on the Internet
from the perspective of protecting yourself—your business, your information, your
assets, your reputation, and so on. As you will soon see, the Internet contains an
enormous amount of data on individuals, families, and businesses, and as in other
areas of life, the value of this information depends on how it is used.
Some personal information database sites are set up with the business user in mind.
For a fee, you can find out if a potential employee has a criminal record or a history
of bankruptcy, has been married once or many times, has a good credit rating, and
many other personal details that you can use to decide whether he or she is a good
fit for your organization. You could consider these specifics critical to your ability to
making wise hiring decisions. A potential employee who has an iffy personal history
but is trying valiantly to get his or her life in order would probably see this search as
an invasion of privacy.
Here’s another example of the two sides of the privacy-and-security coin. In Texas,
where one of us lives, you can search the Texas Department of Public Safety Sex
Offender Registration Database (go to http://records.txdps.state.tx.us/so_search.cfm)
for data about sex offenders living in your area. And this service is free. You can find

Chapter 7

out the person’s name, address, date of birth, sex, race, height, weight, eye color, hair
color, shoe size, and identification number in the database. You can search by area
code for a list of offenders, or you can simply enter a person’s name to see whether
he or she is listed in the database. The ability to obtain this kind of information
has been attacked by civil libertarians and praised by parents and civic leaders
attempting to ensure the public safety.
We also want to make one other point about some of the fee-based personal infor-
mation sites we’ll talk about in this chapter: they charge for information that in a lot
of cases you could get for free or for less money. In general, these databases glean data
from public records. The key, of course, is knowing how to find and search public
records and having the time to do so.

In Chapter 8, we’re going to look at how to use Internet search services to gather
business information. As you’ll see or as you may already know, you can get all kinds of data
online—annual reports, backgrounders, market research, and so on. This information is
available because businesses and individuals choose to make it available. But when you browse
the Web gathering business information, Web sites are also collecting information about
you. Sometimes you give it to them willingly, as when you enter contact information to register
at a site.
We don’t know about you, but we frequently become annoyed at the kinds of questions
we are asked to answer at some sites. Recently, we tried in vain to search the archives of
our local metropolitan newspaper. We say “in vain” because before we could access the
archives, which were available for free, we needed to answer about four or five screens of
information. Some of this stuff our own mothers wouldn’t know about us. Our response
was to fire off an e-mail letter to the editor, which, by the way, was basically met with
“Who cares?” On the Internet, as elsewhere, it’s occasionally a trade-off between how
much information you want to divulge and how much information you can obtain.
Almost always, though, the Web sites you visit collect information about you without
your knowledge. To see what we mean, follow these steps:

• The operating system we are using and its version number.

• Whether VBScript and JavaScript are enabled and working.
• The resolution of our computer screen and how many colors it is set to display.
• The name, physical address, phone number, and administrative, technical, and billing

Now, Anonymizer is giving you an opportunity to see this information because it wants
to make a point and sell you one of its protection services, which allow you to browse
the Web anonymously. This company’s mission is to make up for what it sees as a major
shortcoming in Web technology: user privacy and security are not major concerns for
browser companies or Web site administrators. You’ll find details at the site.

Now, what you do about any of this depends on how much you care that Web sites have
this information. If you care a lot, the easiest solution is to use a privacy service such
as Anonymizer. You can also take some other steps.
• Clean out your History list. This prevents someone from physically walking up to
your computer and viewing the pages you’ve recently visited. In Internet Explorer,
click the Tools menu, and then click Internet Options to open the Internet Options
dialog box. On the General tab, click the Clear History button. Or, you can also opt
not to keep a History list by adjusting the Days To Keep Page In History setting
to zero.
• When posting to newsgroups, don’t use your real name or real e-mail address. See
Chapter 5 for information on how to set this up.
• Enter a fake name and e-mail address when you configure your Web browser or
e-mail program, but keep in mind that this is also what recipients will see when you
send e-mail messages. You’ll need to change this back to the real thing when you want
people to know it’s you.
• When a Web site requests a lot of personal information before allowing you to access
its resources, enter fake data when possible, or find another way to get what you were
looking for. The Internet is a big place.

our Credit Card and the Internet
We confess: we love online shopping. We also admit that we worry about the security
of our credit cards—when we use them online to buy books or offline to pay for
software at the office supply store, to order airline tickets, and so on. And for good reason:
one of us was recently the victim of identity theft. We learned about it through a call
from a very unpleasant collection agency wanting immediate payment of thousands of
dollars that had been charged to a credit card we didn’t have. The thief had all the
information needed to set up an account in another person’s name—Social Security
number, mother’s maiden name, address, phone numbers, and so on. It took us about
six months to straighten out this nightmare.
We can’t tell you that by following the guidelines in this section you will never be the
victim of identity theft, never have your credit card stolen, and never have to concern
yourself about the security of credit card purchases. We can tell you that the safety of
your credit card information depends on being informed, starting with an understanding
of what happens when you make a credit card purchase over the Internet. Here’s how
it works:
• Once you indicate to a Web site that you want to buy something using your credit
card, you are sent to a secure section of the site. You’ll know that the area is secure
when you see https in the Address bar rather than http. (The added “s” in the
protocol part of the address stands for secure.)
• After you fill out the form and click the Submit button, your credit card information
moves from your computer to the site’s secure server in an encrypted form (scrambled
so that it can’t be read in transit).
• The encrypted information then goes out over the Internet to a transaction server
that decrypts (unscrambles) it and then validates the information with your credit
card company.
• If the card is validated, the transaction server informs the site, and your order is
processed. You’ll usually see a page that contains confirmation information.
The most important part of this process is encryption. Heed the following advice from
financial and technology experts: never submit credit card information to a Web site
that claims this data doesn’t need to be encrypted.

Periodically, check your credit report at one of the three national credit reporting agencies:
• Trans Union. Phone: 1-800-680-7293. Internet: http://www.transunion.com.
• Equifax. Phone: 1-888-567-8688. Internet: http://www.equifax.com.
• Experian. Phone: 1-800-353-0809. Internet: http://www.experian.com.
At the Trans Union site, you can order your credit report online using a credit card, but
you cannot view the report online. The report is mailed to you. Rates charged for credit
reports are determined by state law, and so the charge depends on your state of residence.
Some state laws prohibit ordering a credit report online, including Colorado, Georgia,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont. If you live in one of those states,
you must order by phone or by mail.
At the Equifax site, you can order your credit report online and then choose to view
it online or have it mailed to you. Unfortunately, the Experian site provides no
information about how to obtain your credit report—online or offline. If you want to
contact this company, you’ll need to do so by phone.
Perhaps a better source for obtaining your credit report is Qspace at
http://www.qspace.com. At this site, shown in Figure 7-2, click the Get Your Report
In Seconds link. You can then choose to obtain a single report from one of the three
major credit bureaus and view it online (for $7.95) or obtain a comprehensive report
that contains information merged from all three bureaus. In the latter case, the charge
is $29.95, and the report is mailed to you.

Here are some other ways to protect your credit cards:
• If you have your monthly ISP charges billed to your credit card, ask your ISP how
it protects its database of customer credit card numbers. If you don’t like the answer
you get, it may be time to change your billing method or change your ISP.
• When you get your credit card statements, check for phony ISP charges. A scam artist
can charge your credit card with a fee that looks similar to a normal ISP charge, say,
$19.95.
• Don’t use your credit card to make purchases from a site that doesn’t list a mailing
address or a phone number.

A privacy policy is a statement that appears on a Web site and sets forth in clear terms
the following:
• What personal information is collected by the site.
• How this information will be used.
• With whom this information will be shared.
• Whether you can control how personal information about you is used.
Figure 7-4 shows the privacy policy of America Online (AOL). If you scroll down the
page at http://www.aol.com/info/privacy.html, you’ll see that AOL is a member of the
TRUSTe program.

For starters, check out your ISP’s privacy policy. Go to their Web site and look around.
If you can’t find a privacy policy, contact your ISP and ask them to send you a copy.
If they don’t have a privacy policy or don’t want to share it with you, you might think
about finding a new ISP.
When you visit Web sites, and especially when you are considering making purchases
from a Web site, check out the site’s privacy policy. You need to know what they
intend to do with the personal and financial information you supply. If you can’t find
out, think about taking your business elsewhere.

So you’re watching the evening news, and a journalist interviews the second-grade chum
or a distant relative of an ordinary person who has just performed an heroic act. Ever
wonder how the journalist found this interviewee? Probably by accessing a personal
information database over the Internet.
A great deal of information about you and your business is available over the Internet.
Some of it is free, but even more is available if someone is willing to pay for it. For free,
someone accessing any one of several free databases can obtain the following:
• Your name, address, phone number (even if it’s unlisted sometimes), fax number, and
your e-mail address.
• The URL of your home page if you have one.
• The same information for about 250 of your closest neighbors.
• A map of your neighborhood that’s marked to show your residence.
• A guide to the stores and shops in your neighborhood.
• Where you went to high school and when.
• Your name and address and all this other information if they have your phone number.
In addition, someone could phone you, send you an electronic greeting card, send you
flowers and gifts, and find your old high-school friends with a mouse click.
To find out just exactly what information about you is available for free online, go to
any of the following sites and search on your name:
• AT&T AnyWho Info at http://www.anywho.com.
• PeopleFind.com at http://www.peoplefind.com.
Now, if someone is willing to pay a fee, he or she can locate enormous amounts of
information about you online, including the following:
• The addresses of all the places you’ve lived for the last 10 years.
• All phone numbers associated with these addresses.
• A description of any properties you own or have owned and any deed transfers.

• Any bankruptcies, liens, or judgments against you.
• A list of any professional licenses you have.
• Names of relatives, roommates, family members, spouses, or friends who used the same
address as you during the last 10 years.
• The names of all your neighbors over the last 10 years.
• Any crimes of which you have been convicted during the last 7 to 10 years.
• Your vehicle driving record.
• Your physical address (even if you use a post office box).
• A history of any civil litigation against you.
To see how this can happen, go to A1Trace at http://www.a1trace.com. Figure 7-5
shows this site’s home page. To find out how to obtain specific information and the fee,
click one of the links on the left. Much of this information is also available through
USSEARCH (http://www.ussearch.com), and the fees are comparable. Figure 7-6 shows

If you’re like us, by now you’ve acquired an acute case of paranoia and are itching to
know how you can get some of this data removed from these sites. Unfortunately, you
can’t directly get information about you removed from the fee-based sites because it is
compiled from public records. Later in this section, we’ll look at a couple of ways you
can prevent some of your public records from ending up in a fee-based database, but
first let’s look at what you can easily do—remove your personal information from some
so-called white pages, the sites that provide free personal information.

As far as we can tell, there is no way to remove your listing from
USSEARCH.com or PeopleFind.
In most cases, if you can’t easily discern how to remove your listing at a site, click Help
or check the Frequently Asked Questions link. Here are instructions for removing your
listing from some major white pages:
• To remove your listing from AT&T AnyWho Info, go to the site (http://
www.anywho.com), search on your name, and in the results page click the Change
This Listing link. On the next page, click the Remove button.
• To remove your listing from Yahoo! People Search (http://people.yahoo.com), go to
http://people.yahoo.com/py/psPhoneSupp.py and fill out and submit the Remove
Phone Listing form.
• To remove your listing from Bigfoot.com, go to the site (http://www.bigfoot.com)
and search on your name. In the results page, click the Change This Listing link, and
then click the Remove button.
As we mentioned, fee-based information sites gather their data from public records such
as departments of motor vehicles, registries of deeds, court proceedings, and so on. They
make money by allowing quick online access to this information, and they are not doing
anything illegal. Consequently, they aren’t the least bit interested in removing data about
you or anyone else. You do have some recourse, though it’s admittedly not much.
Your state department of motor vehicles collects and maintains a great deal of personal
information about you; much of it is right there on your driver’s license. The federal
Driver Protection Act lists the ways that this information can and cannot be used, and
you can prevent your state department of motor vehicles from distributing this data for
marketing and promotional purposes. To get specifics for your state, go to the Federal
Trade Commission site at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/protect.htm and click the link to
your state.

E-Mail and Security?
Secure e-mail is an oxymoron unless you are using encryption, which we’ll look at later
in this section. Sending unencrypted e-mail messages is much the same as sending a
note on a postcard. E-mail is, in fact, even less secure than a telephone conversation. Any
e-mail messages that you send and receive are stored and can be read by any number
of people. Chapter 4 discussed how e-mail works, and as you may recall, when you send
an e-mail message, it travels across the Internet.
Let’s start by looking at what happens when you send e-mail at a corporation. Any
e-mail messages you send and receive, whether locally or over the Internet, are saved on

the local area network server and probably also backed up to a disk or tape somewhere.
And, furthermore, these files are legally owned by the company you work for and can
be used in any way the company wants, including to terminate your employment.
Many companies make it a practice to let employees in on this and publish rules and
policies about the corporate use of e-mail. Others don’t, but you shouldn’t assume, in
this case, that your messages aren’t being stored or even monitored.
When your e-mail messages start their journey out over the Internet, they go from your
local area network (LAN) to your ISP. Again, all messages you send and receive through
your ISP are stored on servers that any number of people can read. How long are
messages stored on either your LAN servers or ISP servers? To be on the safe side, you
should assume forever. If a message that Bill Gates sent to a member of the Microsoft
inner sanctum can be used as evidence in court and printed in newspapers all across the
country, the same could certainly happen to you.
Another concern regarding e-mail privacy and security is Carnivore, the nickname of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) e-mail reading tool. With a warrant, the FBI
can install Carnivore at an ISP and detect all messages going to and from a suspected
criminal. But, of course, Carnivore can detect anybody’s messages, not just those sent
to or by criminals. At the time of this writing, Carnivore was the subject of congres-
sional hearings in the United States, and they and Internet observers were raising
additional questions about this technology and how it is or could be used, including:
• What other similar technology does the FBI have in production or under develop-
ment that we should be concerned about?
• What happens if Carnivore falls into the hands of those with malicious intent, if it
hasn’t already?
• Can we trust FBI agents to use Carnivore properly and not pry into the e-mail
messages of non-criminals?
We mentioned early on in this chapter that the value of the vast amount of informa-
tion on the Internet depends on how it is used, and the same applies to technology.
When it is possible for a single individual to simultaneously bring down several large-
scale networks such as CNN and Yahoo!, we need a way to track down the offender. At
the same time, we need ways—technical and legal—to protect our privacy.
Then, don’t forget the obvious. If someone has access to your computer, that person can

The first way to protect the e-mail messages that you send and receive is to simply be aware
that e-mail is inherently not secure unless it’s encrypted. At the office, don’t use e-mail
to discuss sensitive human resources issues such as salary or benefits information, for
example. And if you want to keep your account with your ISP and avoid legal action, don’t
send e-mail that’s abusive, haranguing, indecent, threatening, or in any other way violates
their stated use policy.
The second way is the simplest: password-protect your personal computer. If you are
using Windows 2000 Professional or Windows NT, password protection is easy to
enforce. By default, you must use a password to access your system, even if it is a
standalone machine not connected to a LAN. If you are using an earlier version of
Windows, password protection is optional on a standalone machine. If you are con-
cerned about the safety and privacy of e-mail files on a standalone machine, always use
password protection. You can even enforce password protection when using a screen saver.
For information on how to password-protect your local computer, files, a screen saver,
and so on, see the help program that’s included with your version of Windows.
If you work on a local area network, you will need a user name and a password to access
that network, and your ISP will require that you use a password to log on to its servers
and access the Internet.
If someone has your passwords, he or she has access to your computer, your network,
and your Internet account and can pose as you. Using passwords is the first step in
protecting yourself against such intrusion, and using them wisely is the second step.
Here are some guidelines for choosing passwords that cannot be easily broken and for
protecting your passwords:
• Most systems specify a minimum and a maximum number of characters that a
password should include. Go for longer rather than shorter; a longer, more complicated
password is much more difficult to detect.
• Use numbers, letters, and symbols in your password. If your system allows it, you
can also utilize case-sensitivity, for example, cELt*6.
• Change your password frequently. Some systems spell this out and require you to
change your password after a certain interval and not to reuse a password until you’ve
used a set number of other passwords.
• Never write your password on a sticky note and paste it on your monitor or desktop.

• Never use a plain English word as your password. The English language has a finite
number of words, and a computer program can run through them quickly.
• Don’t use personal names, pet’s names, words that reflect your job title or organization,
or any other easy-to-guess terms.
• Never give out your password to anyone, even to help desk personnel at work. They
don’t need it for any reason. If a help desk person at work or at your ISP asks for your
password, he or she is probably an impostor.

Earlier, we promised to discuss encryption, and now we turn to that topic. The topic
of encryption can become very technical very quickly, and in the last section in this
chapter we’ll point you toward some resources that supply the details. Here, we want
to give you an overview of how encryption works and mention one encryption program
that you can get for free.
Basically, encryption scrambles the contents of an e-mail message so that it can only be
read by someone who has a key (a secret code) to unscramble it. Most people assume that
the best encryption programs are unbreakable, and that’s what their developers claim.
However, others—those on the more paranoid side of the fence—believe that they could
be broken by someone at a government agency using a supercomputer. Nevertheless, if
you need to send secure e-mail in your business, using an encryption program is a fairly
safe bet, and as we mentioned earlier, credit card information is encrypted before it is sent
across the Internet to a secure transaction server.
Here’s how encryption works:
• You compose an e-mail message with a key so that as it travels across the Internet it
looks like a bunch of random letters, numbers, and characters.
• Because you’ve previously sent your recipient the key, he or she uses a key to un-
scramble your message upon receipt and read it.
Keys are of two types: public and private. Your encryption program generates these keys.
You distribute the public key to your e-mail recipients, and they distribute their public
keys to you, either via e-mail or a Web site. Each person’s private key stays on his or her
computer. When you compose mail, you encrypt it with your recipient’s public key,
and he or she decrypts it with his or her private key. The process works in reverse when
you receive encrypted e-mail.

ndexing and searching are skills in which professional librarians excel. If you are among
the fortunate, you may work for an organization that employs such a person. If you
are like most of us, though, you’ll need to hone your own searching skills in order to
find exactly the information you need and want on the Internet.
According to the latest estimates, there are some 2.1 billion unique, publicly available
pages on the Internet. That makes it highly unlikely that you’ll happen upon just the
figures you need for a presentation, the source of a quote, or anything else specific.

In this chapter, we are going to start by giving you an overview of how searching the
Internet works, the types of search tools you can use, and the techniques involved. We’ll
then show you how to use this information to turn the Internet and especially the Web
into a powerful research and intelligence-gathering tool for business purposes—locating
businesses, getting background information on businesses, doing a competitive
analysis, scoping out the market, prospecting for sales, and so on.

Search service is a relatively new term that describes a Web site from which you can start
a search of the Internet. Search services come in two basic flavors: commercial and
noncommercial. Commercial search services catalog information on the Internet to
attract visitors, and they also display advertisements. Noncommercial search services may
exist for research, educational, and academic purposes and for many other purposes.
More specifically, there are two types of search services: search engines and directories.
Search engines, also referred to as search tools, work like this:
• Programs called spiders, robots, or Web crawlers locate and collect information about
Web sites.
• A software agent then sends this information to an indexing program.
• The indexing program then puts the information into a database. Some indexing
programs index every word in each document, others index only the key 100 words
in each document. In addition, some indexing programs index the size of the
document, the number of words in the document, the title, headings, and so on.
• When you enter search criteria, the search engine looks in its database and displays
a list of Web pages that are relevant to your criteria. Most search engines list the pages
from most to least relevant, and display the URL, the title, and sometimes the first
few words of the document.
HotBot, shown in Figure 8-1, is an example of an Internet search engine, and you will
find it at http://www.hotbot.com.

Web sites come and go, companies change their name and their URL, content
of sites changes (if the company is properly supporting its Web site)—the
Internet is a dynamic environment. Thus, it’s possible that a URL in this chap-
ter (or elsewhere in this book for that matter) may lead to a dead end or to a
replacement site. It’s also possible that the content and options we describe for
a site have changed since we visited the site and wrote about it.
A directory is created by people rather than by software alone. Individuals trained in
cataloging determine how a Web site and its contents should be classified and place
Web sites in multilevel categories that you can browse. Yahoo! is an example of a
directory search service. You’ll find it at http://www.yahoo.com, and we’ll look at it in
detail later in this chapter.

Now, we wish it weren’t necessarily so, but the distinction between a search engine and
a directory quickly blurs. For one thing, hybrid services exist in which directories use
search engines and search engines use directories. Nevertheless, the distinction becomes
important when you get ready to choose a search service. If the information you’re
looking for can be easily classified, you’ll find it faster and easier using a directory. If
you are searching for a very specific word or phrase, you’re better off using a search engine,
because it has indexed every word.

We need to look at a couple more ways to search the Internet before we get into some
specific searching techniques. A portal is a large Web site that in many cases started out
as a search service and evolved into everything but the kitchen sink. Using a portal, you
can search the Internet, get a free e-mail account, chat online, instant message, and get
news about current events, sports, and finance, among other things.
Some of the most popular portals include the following:
• Excite (http://www.excite.com)
• Infoseek (http://www.infoseek.com)
• Lycos (http://www.lycos.com)
• MSN (http://www.msn.com)
• Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com)
• ZDNet (http://www.zdnet.com)
We’ll look at some of these portals as well as others later in this chapter.
Metasearch software is a relatively new way to search the Internet. Unlike search ser-
vice sites, metasearch accesses many search services simultaneously and display and use
the results. Metasearch software works like this:
• Enter your search criteria in your metasearch software.
• The metasearch software sends agents to contact one or more search services and enter
your search criteria.
• The search services then report the results of their searches to the agents, which send
the results back to the metasearch software.

• The metasearch software examines the results, eliminates duplicates, and displays the
results, ranking the relevancy of each found site.
• You browse the results, as you would in any other search service.
Later in this chapter, we’ll take a look at how to use a popular metasearch software,
Copernic.

Searching with Keywords

Searching with Keywords
Long before the Internet became available to the general public, professional researchers
were searching large electronic databases using the techniques that we can use today to
search the Internet. Professional researchers were and are extremely skilled at putting
their finger on just exactly the information they want and are still employed by many
organizations, especially organizations that rely on specialized information stored in
large, proprietary technical databases.
At most search service sites, you will find instructions for entering search criteria. Many
search services hide the technicalities, making it relatively easy to do a quick, simple
search. In a business, however, you will most likely want to exercise much more con-
trol so that you can quickly access specifics. You do this by using keywords.
As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, some spiders and robots index every single word
in a Web page. The search engine compares your keywords with the words in its in-
dex and returns the results. Although you might fear getting no results, far more likely
is that you’ll get too many results. Use the techniques we’re about to look at here to
greatly increase the odds of finding not less than and not more than but exactly what
you want.

For purposes of example, we’ll use the AltaVista search engine at http://
www.altavista.com.
At the AltaVista home page, you enter search criteria in the Find box, and then click
Search or press the Enter key. Let’s assume we’re interested in finding out which busi-
nesses in Houston have a Web presence. In the Find box, enter the following:
businesses on the Web in Houston

Figure 8-2 shows the results that we got. Look down in the Web Pages bar, and you’ll
see that the search engine found more than 10 million pages. In addition, if you look
at the bottom of the page, you’ll see how many occurrences were found for each of the
words we specified. Fortunately, the search engine ignored the articles and prepositions
or we’d have even more pages.
Figure 8-2
The results of a search for businesses on the Web in Houston.
These results are not helpful. Why did we get so many hits? Because we were in es-
sence asking the search engine to find all pages that included any word in our query.
Search engines use something called Boolean logic, which works with logical rather than
numeric relationships and employs three primary kinds of operators: AND, OR, and
NOT. Many search engines (including AltaVista) use the OR operator by default,
regardless of whether you enter it. Therefore, the AltaVista search engine was reading
our query as follows:
businesses OR on OR the OR Web OR in OR Houston
Consequently, we ended up with millions of hits. How can we narrow the search?

Searching for a Phrase
One way is to tell the search engine to search for that particular phrase, that is, find all
the pages that include the exact words in the exact order in which we enter them. To
do this, simply enclose the phrase in quotation marks, like this:
“businesses on the Web in Houston”
When we entered this search phrase, though, AltaVista found no documents containing
it. A better solution might be to search on all the words in the phrase, but not the exact
phrase.

To search on all the important words in our phrase, we set up an AND Boolean
relationship—by using plus signs (+). The plus sign tells the search engine to find all
documents that contain businesses AND Web AND Houston:
+businesses +Web +Houston
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
Press the spacebar after a word and before a plus sign.
Another way to find more pages on your topic is to include variations or synonyms of
a word. For example, we might search on businesses and corporations and companies, like
this:
businesses corporations companies +Web +Houston
In this case, we’d find all Web pages that contained the following:
businesses AND Web AND Houston
corporations AND Web AND Houston
companies AND Web AND Houston
TIP

If you want a search to be case-sensitive, capitalize the necessary words. If you
want the search to find all instances of the word regardless of case, enter the
word or words in lowercase. In our example, we would do well to enter web
instead of Web, since it is common to find the word in all lowercase or with
an initial capital letter.

You don’t want to get too fancy with this, but the NOT operator can come in handy
from time to time. In our example, we want to find documents that contain informa-
tion about businesses on the Web in the city of Houston. Therefore, we might want
to eliminate pages that contain Houston as a person’s last name, such as Whitney
Houston. In this case, we could enter the following:
+businesses +web +Houston NOT “Whitney Houston”
NOTE

Search services deal with operators in different ways. AltaVista, for example,
requires that you use AND before NOT. For example, +businesses +Houston
AND NOT “Whitney Houston”.

Using Wildcards
A wildcard is not a joker, but a symbol you can use in a search string (which is another
name for your search criteria) to indicate that you want to search for any and all charac-
ters in place of the symbol. The symbol you use is the asterisk (*). For example, if you want
to search for corporate, corporation, and corporations, you could enter the following:
corporat*
The following are situations in which using the asterisk might produce better results:
• Your search word could be included only once or twice in a page. If your spelling
doesn’t exactly match the spelling in the page, the search engine won’t find it.
• The word is often spelled in more than one way, for example, disc and disk. In this
case, enter dis* (although this will also return pages with the word disaster, discipline,
and any other word beginning with dis).

No one search service or search engine will suffice for all your business searches. Most
people tend to have a favorite or favorites, but you’ll find that initially you’ll do your-
self a favor if you do some exploring. Select a topic, enter it in several search services,
and see what kinds of results you get.
The reason that one search service doesn’t fill all or even most needs is that each search
engine uses a different scheme to retrieve results, and no one search engine covers the
entire Web. In this section, we’ll look at how to use some of the major search services
as well as some newcomers to the field and give you some tips on how to get the most

be offset by AltaVista Discovery, a utility that you can download for free. You can use
AltaVista Discovery to search the Web, documents on your local hard drive or on your

The Infoseek search service is still there, however, and we look at it in this section because
it’s been around a long time (in computer years) and it’s easy to use. You can use the
search field to look for information on the Web, for images, and for audio and video.
You can’t, though, use Boolean operators, limit a search by date, or select languages.
The directory at Go.com includes only reviewed sites, and so using the directory may
be your best bet here. To display the directory, click the Search tab. Results are preceded
by a list of categories that you can use to narrow your search, and you can sort the results
by date and hide the summaries if you want. You can also search within the results you
retrieve by selecting the Search Within Results option button.

Google is a goofy name for a search service, but in our opinion what it does is not goofy.
You won’t find free e-mail, shopping, or clubs on Google because it does only one thing:
search. Google has been called the “hottest search engine on the Internet.” In mid-2000
it claimed to have indexed more than 1 billion Web pages and claimed that an aver-
age search took 0.04 seconds. The Yahoo! search service, which we’ll look at later in this
section, uses the Google search engine.
The Google search engine looks at all the Web pages that link to a Web site and then
ranks those sites first when it returns search results. The Google directory contains more
than 1.5 million URLs and is integrated with the Open Directory pages. The Open
Directory Project is a large public directory managed by Netscape and maintained by
a group of volunteer editors from around the world. These editors select Web pages and
organize them into categories and subcategories. Google uses this hierarchy as the basis
for its directory.
Figure 8-8 shows the Google home page (http://www.google.com). To do a basic search,
enter your keyword or phrase and press the Enter key. If you enter multiple terms,
Google automatically connects them with the AND operator.

similar to Figure 8-9.

When you do a basic search, the results are enhanced by information from the direc-
tory. You can click these links to access similar pages in the same category or other related
categories. You might want to go straight to the directory though in the following
situations:
• When you aren’t sure how to narrow your search from a broad category.
• When you want to search for a topic only within a category instead of searching the
entire Internet.
• When you want to see only those sites that have been evaluated by an editor.

The Go2Net site (http://www.go2net.com) is important to business users for one pri-
mary reason: it gives you quick access to a directory of indispensable business direc-
tories. Thus, we aren’t going to look at the other features of this site; you can search it
much the same as many other sites. But we do want to point you to the directory links.
From the Go2Net start page, click the Search tab. In the Directory section, click the
Business Companies link, and on the next page, click the Company Directories link.
You’ll see a listing similar to that in Figure 8-10. (Go2Net uses the LookSmart search
engine.)

CNET is a leading company whose business is to provide information and services
relating to computers and technology. It disseminates this information over its Web site
(http:///www.cnet.com) and over television and radio. Recently, CNET reported that
HotBot delivers the most accurate results of any of the top-rated search engines.
The HotBot search engine tracks which search results links a user clicks and how long
the user stays at each site. The longer a user stays, the higher the site is ranked in the
search results.
Figure 8-11 shows the HotBot home page, and as you can see, almost everything is at
your fingertips on this page. You can search by keyword, you can use the HotBot di-
rectory, and you can restrict or expand your search using the options in the box on the
left.

You can use the Look For drop-down list box to search on any or all keywords with-
out using the Boolean operators. You use the Date drop-down list box to search by date,
and you can search for only pages that include images, video, MP3, or JavaScript. In
addition, you can specify the number of return results and whether you want the re-
sults to display full descriptions, brief descriptions, or only URLs.
As if all this weren’t enough, click the Advanced Search button to open the page shown
in Figure 8-12, which includes even more options. You can search specific resources,
and you can specify a language, a filter, a domain, word stemming, and so on using the
options on the right. HotBot is an easy-to-use, powerful search engine.

searching Web sites that have been reviewed is important to you and to the nature of
your business, LookSmart is a site to add to your Favorites list.
To search by keyword, simply enter the term or phrase and click Search. Don’t use plus
or minus signs, quotation marks, or any other symbols to restrict your search. Boolean
operators are not necessary in LookSmart. When the search process is complete, you’ll
see a couple levels of results:
• The first level contains a number of categories that you can use to further refine your
search.
• The second level contains a list of sites.
• The third level displays results that have been reviewed by the LookSmart staff.
To search by category rather than by keyword, simply click categories and subcatego-
ries until you get to an area in which you want to search. Figure 8-13 shows the
LookSmart home page, on which you can begin a directory search.

Lycos, Inc., was founded in 1995 and originally used a search engine and directory that
was based on intelligent spidering technology that was originally created at Carnegie
Mellon University. Today it combines a proprietary technology with other search tech-
nologies to keep track of all the visible text on every page it finds on the Internet.
To do a basic search at Lycos (http://www.lycos.com), simply enter the keyword in the
Search For box and click the Go Get It! button. Here are some tips to help you search
efficiently at this site:
• If you want to search on a phrase exactly as you enter it, enclose it in quotation marks.
• To screen out a word in a search string, precede it with a minus sign.
• If certain words must be included in the results, precede them with a plus sign.
• To search for specific types of documents and to specify a language, click the Ad-
vanced Search link on the Lycos home page.
• To search for images, movies, or sounds, click the appropriate link in the Find sec-
tion of the Lycos home page.

Whether we’ve saved the best search service for last is a matter of opinion, but there’s
no doubt that Yahoo! is an amazing and extremely popular site. As are most of the sites
we’ve discussed in this section, Yahoo! is much more than a search service, as you can
see in its home page in Figure 8-16. Nevertheless, in this section we’ll concentrate on
the search services.

Yahoo! was conceived by David Filo and Jerry Yang in 1994 while they were Ph.D.
candidates at Stanford University. Their purpose was simple: they needed a way to keep
track of their personal interests on the Internet. Rumor has it that Yahoo! stands for
“Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,” but Filo and Yang say they selected the
name because they considered themselves yahoos.
Today, many Internet users have come to think of searching the Internet as synonymous
with going to the Yahoo site (http://www.yahoo.com). When you enter a search query,
the Yahoo! search engine doesn’t search the full text of Web sites; it searches its own
directory of the Web, which consists of Web page titles and short descriptions if they
have been provided by the designers of the page. In other words, Yahoo! doesn’t match
your keywords against all the words in the Web sites represented by the directory, but
against the words in the directory itself.
Yahoo! returns a list of matching Yahoo! categories and a list of matching Web sites.
If the search engine finds no matching categories or sites, Yahoo! uses another search
engine to do a full-document search.
To do a basic search at Yahoo!, enter your keyword or phrase and click Search. Enter
double quotation marks around a phrase if you want to search on the exact phrase. You
can also use the plus and minus signs, as we discussed earlier in this chapter. Click the
category links to search the directory by hierarchical topics. For example, if you want
to search for employment laws that apply to small businesses, click the main Business
& Economy category, click Small Business Information, click Employment Law, and
then click the link to one of the Web sites that Yahoo! lists.

Earlier in this chapter, we described metasearch software, and in this section we’ll look
at how to download and use the Copernic metasearch software. Copernic is available
in three versions:
• Copernic 2000, which you can download for free and which lets you use 6 catego-
ries to search simultaneously some 80 information sources.
• Copernic 2000 Plus, a commercial product, which lets you access more than 600
search engines and specialized information sources grouped in 55 categories.
• Copernic 2000 Pro, also a commercial product, which also lets you access more than
600 search engines and specialized information sources grouped in 55 categories and,
in addition, lets you schedule search updates and receive e-mail alerts.
In this section, we’ll first download and install Copernic 2000, which is free, and then
we’ll look at how to use this very powerful tool to search the Internet.

Gathering Business Information
Up to this point in this chapter, we’ve been talking about the tools you can use to search
the Internet for business information. Now, we want to focus on how you go about
gathering some specific business information. In other words, you need to know how
to do research as well as search.
We can’t begin to imagine all the types of research that might be called for in your
business organization, but in this section we’ll look at a rather common type of busi-
ness research: gathering background information on a company
You may want background information on a company for many reasons. Perhaps you’re
thinking about investing in the company or doing business with them. Or, maybe
they’ve offered you a job, and you want to know about the company’s stability and its
potential for the future.
Typically, background information includes the following:
• Contact information about the company—its name, address, phone number, fax
number, e-mail address, URL, and so on
• The names and titles of those in management positions
• The company’s mission statement or a description of its products and services
• The number of employees
• A financial statement
• Credit rating and history
• News about any recent developments within the company
So, where do you start? You could start with the obvious, the company’s Web site (if
it has one, and these days, most do). If you don’t know the URL, you could simply take
a guess, and enter the company name plus .com. You could also use Yahoo! or one of
the other search services we’ve discussed in this chapter to locate it.
Once you find the company’s home page, you’re ready to start amassing basic informa-
tion. For example purposes, in this section we’ll look at Cisco Systems (http://
www.cisco.com), a company that provides hardware and software that powers the
Internet. Figure 8-27 shows the Cisco home page. To get information about this com-
pany, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the About Cisco link. (Most
business Web sites will have a similar link, though it might be labeled Contact Us or
something similar.)

Clicking the About Cisco link takes you to a page that contains links to a wealth of
corporate news and information that you can use in your backgrounder: a company
overview, the annual report, biographies of management personnel, news of recent
company developments, and so on. Click the Contact Cisco link to get contact infor-
mation for company headquarters and for office locations and departments around the
world, including maps.
But, obviously, what you’re getting here is Cisco’s side of the story. For a quick, more
objective overview and some detailed financials, go to Yahoo!. Click the Stock Quotes link,
enter csco (the stock symbol for Cisco), and click Get Quotes. Now click the Profile link
in the More Info column. You’ll see something similar to Figure 8-28. Scroll down this
page to see all sorts of financial information as well as contact information, links that will
take you to sites for Cisco’s competitors, recent trading history, and so on.

out Hoover’s Online (http://www.hoovers.com). Figure 8-29 shows the home page.
Enter the company name in the For box, and click Go or press the Enter key. The results
are returned in directory format. Click a tab to refine your search. Some information,
indicated by a gold key, is available for members only. At the time of this writing, the
membership fee was $14.95 a month.

In addition to gathering background information on a company, business users can also
use the Internet to do market research, competitive analysis, research stocks and invest-
ments, find case studies that illustrate various management theories, and on and on. Table
8-5 lists some sites that will be useful in doing business research. Some of these are fee-
based, and some make certain areas available for free and charge for other areas. Be sure
to check the fine print.

S
ome Web publishers and more than a few investors lament that to date much of
the Internet’s content hasn’t yet been monetized. Even when a Web site provides
interesting and useful information, these people say, a Web publisher often still can’t
charge users for access to the information.
One group of Web publishers has been successful in monetizing their content: the large
business information publishers. Because many business professionals aren’t as knowl-
edgeable as they should be about this information, this chapter reviews the most powerful
business information sites we’ve found.

Dun & Bradstreet
Dun & Bradstreet maintains a rich database of information about firms doing busi-
ness in the United States and, more recently, elsewhere. Traditionally, banks consider-
ing loans and trade creditors have used the Dun & Bradstreet service to make better
credit decisions.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
Dun & Bradstreet maintains information on more than 11 million companies
in the United States and more than 26 million companies around the world.
Anyone with an Internet connection, however, can tap into this rich database through
the Dun & Bradstreet site at http://www.dnb.com. Although the Dun & Bradstreet
database and the types of information it supplies reflects its history as a credit analy-
sis tool, the reports available from the Dun & Bradstreet site are very useful for any-
one interested in the financial condition of a firm: employees or prospective employees,
competitors, customers, litigants, and so on.
You can access the Dun & Bradstreet service in two ways. You can subscribe to the
service by paying a monthly fee. (This method of access lets you tap all of Dun &
Bradstreet’s information resources.) Or, you can use a credit card to pay individual charges
for each of the reports you order. (This method lets you tap a subset, but still a rich
subset, of Dun & Bradstreet’s information resources.) The discussion that follows
assumes you’re using the credit-card method of access.

Dun & Bradstreet provides three general categories of reports: U.S. Company Reports
(which is what people usually refer to when they talk of “running a D&B”), GlobalSeek
Reports (which are more abbreviated reports, generally on non-U.S. companies), and
Marketing Lists (which are lists of companies meeting your search or selection criteria).

Dun & Bradstreet provides five different types of U.S. Company Reports:
• Business Information Report ($89)
• Comprehensive Report ($105)
• Supplier Evaluation Report ($93)
• Credit Scoring Report ($49)
• Business Background Report ($23)
The Comprehensive Report supplies the richest information. It provides a summary
with information about key financial items such as sales revenue and net worth, a special
events report that describes changes in a firm’s operation or ownership, detailed infor-
mation about a firm’s payment history to vendors, high level but useful information on
the firm’s financial performance and condition, information about any public filings
such as lawsuits and liens, a short history of the firm, and also operating information
such as the number of employees and the size of the firm’s offices, factory, or warehouse.
The Business Background Report, the least comprehensive and least expensive, provides
a subset of this information, giving a summary, a short history, and operating informa-
tion on a particular company.
The other reports fall between these two in terms of both price and content. If you have
questions, you can view sample reports by clicking the View A Sample hyperlinks.

GlobalSeek Reports provide cursory reports on more than 26 million companies located

Marketing Lists are reports built from the Dun & Bradstreet database using search and
selection criteria you specify. For example, you can build a list of construction compa-
nies with revenues of $2 million to $5 million that are located in California. Dun &
Bradstreet charges a fee based on the number of names on the list. The fee is roughly
$1 per name, but it varies based on the richness of the information you choose to in-
clude on the report.

Assessing the Dun & Bradstreet Service
We have found the Dun & Bradstreet service to be very useful, particularly when
attempting to learn more about small and medium-size, privately owned firms. How-
ever, you should be aware of two weaknesses in the Dun & Bradstreet system. First, many
companies choose not to report full financial information, so even the Comprehensive
Report, Dun & Bradstreet’s best, may give you far less information than you need, want,
and perhaps, thought you were paying for. (Although, if a company isn’t providing
financial information, that may be useful information, too.)
A second weakness is that much of the data reported by the companies is not indepen-
dently verified. For example, sales revenue when it’s reported isn’t independently veri-
fied. (In fairness, how could it be?) So, you can’t know for sure how good the information
is that you’re receiving.
Even taking these weaknesses into consideration, however, we’ve found that the money
is well spent if you really want to know what an important vendor, customer, or com-
petitor is doing.
We also suspect that many employment candidates might do well to consider running
a Dun & Bradstreet report on a prospective employer.

The economist.com Web site provides an online archive of all the articles, reviews, and
essays that have appeared in the British newsmagazine The Economist since 1995. The
Web site also provides online editions of its current issue and the two most recent back
issues.
To use the economist.com Web site, register by providing your name, address, and
billing formation. In this process, you also create a user name and password, which you’ll
use later to sign on to the site and use its tools.

A subscription of the online edition of The Economist costs around $50 a year, although
it’s currently free to subscribers of the print edition of the newsmagazine. We think the
subscription is well worth the price for three reasons: the editorial depth, the European
perspective, and the extra online content. Each reason deserves a quick explanation.
The first reason for at least being aware of the economist.com site concerns its lengthy
feature articles and their editorial depth. Feature articles in The Economist are often five
or six times the length of feature articles in equivalent U.S. newsmagazines. And this
extra length means that you get far richer detail and much more information. Suppose,
for example, that you need to learn more about the winemaking industry. If you search
the economist.com archive, you’ll find an article (actually a set of articles) about
winemaking from the December 18, 1999, issue that totals 5,000 words—roughly
equivalent to a 20-page booklet. Not surprisingly, you can learn far more from an article
of this length than something a page or two in length.
A second reason for noting the economist.com site—at least for Americans—is its British
or European perspective. As Americans bombarded by the stereotypes, language, in-
trinsic assumptions, and national biases of the U.S. media—a media we’re part of—the
distinct differences that permeate the economist.com site give us a new perspective that’s
often thought provoking.
A third reason for knowing about the economist.com site is that the online edition often
provides additional raw content. For example, at the back of each issue of the print edition
of The Economist, the magazine supplies tables of interesting economic and financial
data. Because of limited magazine page space, however, these tables are frequently
incomplete. A table in the print edition of The Economist, for example, might show
economic information on the following countries:
• Australia
• Austria
• Belgium
• Britain
• Canada
• Denmark

The Web edition of this table, however, would add information on the following
countries:
• Finland
• Iceland
• Ireland
• Luxemburg
• New Zealand
• Norway
• Portugal
Searching the economist.com site is straightforward. You can conduct simple searches
by entering your search term in the Search box on the Search form, as shown in Fig-
ure 9-4. As is the case with many search tools, you can use the Boolean search opera-
tors AND, OR, and NOT to refine and control your search.

Caveats About Using Lexis-Nexis

Caveats About Using Lexis-Nexis
Caveats About Using Lexis-Nexis
Two caveats are in order about using the Lexis-Nexis service. First, despite the unpar-
alleled breadth and depth of the service, we think that you’ll be surprised at all the news
information that isn’t available. Major developments and events in your industry, for
example, may not be covered—or covered in meaningful detail. So you unfortunately
can’t really use Lexis-Nexis to mine for information about many of the things you’re
most interested in (what a competitor is doing or has done, the terms of some major
acquisition in your industry, detailed information about a person or product, and so
forth).
A second caveat is this: We suspect that much of the information is less than accurate.
For example, the data often lack precision or are out of date. A business directory that
lists a company may provide out-of-date information or only report a wide range of sales
revenue or employee head counts, for example. And a news article about a firm or some
competitor may contain exaggerations. (We know this, by the way, because we’ve care-
fully checked Lexis-Nexis information sources about our companies and ourselves and
found these sorts of errors.)
These caveats don’t mean that you shouldn’t use the Lexis-Nexis service. We’ve reviewed
and discussed the service here because we think it is a powerful business tool. However,
you’ll need to be careful about relying on information provided by the service and
consider whether the service is worth the steep price.

We think that in general the wsj.com Web site is a great site. If you read the newspa-
per, you already know about The Wall Street Journal’s editorial quality, the thoughtful
nature of its reporting, and the breadth of the business coverage it supplies. And all of
that is good.
The complaint we have about the wsj.com site, however, is that it frequently seems to
be buggy. We don’t know what the problems stem from that we experienced in view-
ing pages and navigating the Web site. But we often had trouble getting pages to display
or to display in a timely manner.

Summary
The fee-based information resources reviewed in this chapter—Dun & Bradstreet,
economist.com, Lexis-Nexis, and wsj.com—don’t make sense for all business users.
However, these information resources offer depth and breadth that typically isn’t avail-
able at the free or ISP-supported Web sites that most of us are accustomed to using.
When you need more information and richer information to make really important
decisions and perform really important analyses, it is often worth it to spend what may
end up being hundreds of dollars on these services.

For business travelers, the Web provides a rich array of sites that make arranging travel
easier. There are online travel agencies, such as expedia.com and travelocity.com. There
are airline and hotel Web sites that let you make reservations and check availability. And
there are also other business travel information Web sites that can often be useful—
especially for the frequent business traveler. In the paragraphs that follow, we briefly
discuss and review each of these categories of travel service Web sites.

Travel agency Web sites, such as expedia.com and travelocity.com, let you arrange for
air travel, hotel lodgings, car rental, and other travel services at any time of the day or
night—not just when the travel agent’s office is open. Because the cost to run a Web
server is very minimal, an online travel agency Web site should at some point produce
lower costs for business and consumer travelers.
To use an online travel agency, you simply describe when you want to travel. Figure 10-1,
for example, shows the expedia.com home page. You could use this home page’s Express
Search buttons and boxes to indicate that you want to find a flight. (You may need to
scroll down the window to get to these buttons and boxes.) To describe a flight, you
indicate the dates you want to depart and return, the airport you will depart from and
the airport you will go to, and the number of people traveling in your party.
Figure 10-1
The expedia.com home page.
After you describe the flight you are looking for, click the Search button. The
expedia.com site then finds flights that match your criteria. Figure 10-2 shows a flight
list, for example. Typically, the online travel agency Web site lists several flights that

NOTE
Online travel agency Web sites like expedia.com let you store your credit card
information on your local computer and then reuse this information when
you want to purchase tickets online.
You may be able to choose an electronic ticket rather than a paper ticket, and electronic
tickets are often most convenient. With an electronic ticket—which is really just an
alphanumeric code often consisting of six or eight letters or numbers—all you do is
provide the code in place of a ticket.

The process for reserving a hotel room or a condominium works in the same way as
purchasing a ticket for a flight. You tell expedia.com where you need lodging and for
how many nights and what dates, and the expedia.com Web site provides a list of
accommodations. You pick the accommodation you want, and expedia.com reserves the
room or condominium for you.
Figure 10-3 shows the Hotels tab of the expedia.com Web site. To make a hotel
reservation, click the button that corresponds to the place you want to visit, or click the
Search In And Around option button and then enter the name of the town or city you
plan to visit. Then you use the Check-In Date and Check-Out Date boxes and the
Adults and Children boxes to indicate when you need lodging and for how many
travelers. After you provide this information, click the Search button. The expedia.com
Web site then returns a list of accommodations that match your search criteria. If you
want to reserve a room or a condominium at a particular property, click the Purchase
hyperlink.

The Cars, Packages, and Cruises tabs work in the same basic way as the Flights

alternatives from which you can choose by clicking a hyperlink.
The online travel agency Web sites work very well for many people. We use them
frequently for both business and personal travel. However, you should be aware of several
common annoyances about these sites:
• You can often step most of the way through the process of reserving a flight, for
instance, only to find the flight isn’t available. (We’ve experienced this frequently
with the expedia.com Web site.)
• If the airline changes a flight or cancels a flight, you won’t actually know this has
happened unless you follow the online travel agency’s Web site instructions for keeping
abreast of itinerary changes. (An in-person travel agency may notify you of changes
in flight times.)
• The deals offered by online travel agency Web sites often aren’t quite as good as those
you can get by working directly with a hotel, an airline, or an in-person agent. (We
find frequently that we can get better deals simply by calling the hotel or airline
directly.)
In spite of these minor annoyances, online travel agency Web sites are wonderful tools
for arranging travel. Literally, at any time during the day or night you can easily book
business or personal travel with a mouse click or two. If you use an electronic ticket, you
do get your ticket right from your computer. And you can often book a trip using one
of these online travel agency Web sites in less time than you would wait on hold if you
called a 1-800 number for an airline or a hotel chain.

The major airlines provide Web sites where you can purchase tickets. These sites are

one other category of Web resources is worth noting here: the Business Traveler Infor-

Although technology experts such as customer support engineers and network admin-
istrators know about the numerous knowledge base sites, many business professionals
don’t. That’s too bad, because product support knowledge base sites are provided by
almost all the major hardware and software vendors. These knowledge base sites are rich
repositories of problem-solving information about their technologies.
Figure 10-11 shows the Knowledge Base Search form for Microsoft’s knowledge base
archives. To use the search form, select the product or technology you have a question
about from the My Search Is About drop-down list box. Then click I Want To Search

By option buttons to control the search. (If you don’t care how the knowledge-base search
engine looks for problem-solving information, don’t worry about these option buttons.)
Finally, type your question or keywords in the My Question Is box. After you’ve pro-
vided this search information, click the Go button. The knowledge-base search engine
then searches through Microsoft’s product support archives looking for problem-solving
articles that provide information related to your search.
Figure 10-11 The Knowledge Base Search form.
Figure 10-12 shows the Search Results Web page when the search keyword was speci-
fied as Printing. The Search Results page provides knowledge base articles and a brief

Different companies’ knowledge base archives work differently, of course; not all are
referred to as knowledge bases. However, if you are comfortable working with search
engines and search forms, you’ll have no difficulty tapping into these archives.
If you don’t see a particular vendor listed in Table 10-1, don’t worry. You may still be
able to find an online knowledge base archive of product support and technical infor-
mation for them. Visit the vendor’s home page, click the Support link, and then look
for a link that points to an online archive of technical support information. Sometimes
this information is described or labeled as the “same information that the technical
support engineers use.”

The Internet service provider, or ISP, Web sites can also provide information of value
to business professionals. Now, it is important to note that most of the information that
these ISP Web sites provide is targeted toward consumers, and what business informa-
tion that is available is targeted mostly toward small and home-based businesses. But
even so, you may find the popular ISP Web sites, such as America Online (AOL), the
Microsoft Network (MSN), and old standbys such as CompuServe, are a good source
of business information.

any business people question how much help the government can be, at least
in terms of running a business. Ironically, the government’s Web sites can be
an enormous help to people who run a business. Many government sites supply deep,

therefore, discusses and describes some of the most useful government Web sites and

the Census Bureau, EDGAR (the Security and Exchange Commission’s site), the

As is noted at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Web site, the mission of the
BEA is “to produce and disseminate accurate, timely, relevant, and cost-effective eco-
nomic account statistics that provide government, businesses, households, and individuals
with a comprehensive up-to-date picture of economic activity.” Not surprisingly then,
the BEA gives business people rich information about U.S. economic growth, regional
economic development, and the nation’s position in the world economy. The Bureau
of Economic Analysis Web site, shown in Figure 11-1, provides Internet users with
fast and easy access to most of the BEA’s publications.

the Catalog Of Products hyperlink—which appears on the BEA home page—to dis-
play the Catalog Of Products page. When you scroll down the page, you quickly get
to a list of the BEA products—which are essentially publications available from the
bureau. Many of these publications are only available by ordering a disk or printed
publication. However, some publications can be downloaded.

To download a BEA publication, follow these steps:
1.  Find the publication.
Scroll through the list of products on the Catalog Of Products Web page, which
includes brief descriptions of the publications.
2. Save the publications file on your local computer.
Right-click the publication’s hyperlink, and choose Save Target As from the short-
cut menu. When you do this, your Web browser will probably display a File Down-
load box like the one shown in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2

3. Name the publication file.
When your Web browser displays the Save As dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-3,
use the Save In drop-down list box to choose a folder location. Leave the initial con-
tents of the File Name box alone; this is the actual name of the publication file. After
specifying where you want to save the publication file, click Save.

Your Web browser downloads a compressed file when you retrieve a BEA publication.
This means that before you can actually do anything with the file, you need to
uncompress it. To uncompress a publication file, follow these steps:
1. Open the folder holding the publication.
If you’re using a Microsoft Windows operating system, use either the My Computer
window or Windows Explorer to display the contents of the folder where you stored
the compressed publication file.
2. Open the compressed publication file.
Double-click the compressed publication file to open the file. When you do, your
computer displays the WinZip self-extractor window, as shown in Figure 11-4.

if you want to place the uncompressed publication file in the My Documents folder
on your C hard drive, enter C:\My Documents.
4. Unzip the publication file.
After you choose the folder location for the unzipped, or uncompressed, publica-
tion file, click the Unzip button. The WinZip self-extractor program uncompresses
the publication file and places the file or files (often a single compressed publica-
tion file uncompresses to several publication files) in the specified folder.

The macroeconomic data you get from the BEA Web site is often rough and raw.
Nevertheless, this information can be very interesting to business professionals. Looking
at overall growth in your industry over the last 10 years, for example, gives a useful
backdrop for considering both your own growth and future growth prospects.
Looking at the absolute size of your industry, of course, also gives you ideas as to how
large you can even grow. Finally, looking at related industries outside of yours may spur
useful discussions about opportunities for growth elsewhere.

.pdf versions of their documents. Pdf documents are only unofficial copies of
the filing. But .pdf documents, as noted in earlier discussions in this chapter,
produce high-quality printed documents even from your local computer. (To

EDGAR doesn’t give you access to all publicly filed documents—only those that are
filed electronically. Companies were phased into EDGAR filing over a three-year pe-
riod ending May 6, 1996. After that date, all public domestic companies have been re-
quired to file their quarterly, annual, and other public statements using EDGAR.
The Guide To Corporate Filings Web page at the EDGAR site provides descriptions
of the most common filings made with the SEC, as shown in Figure 11-14. If you have
a question about what document you want, your best bet is to start here. To reach the

To use EDGAR to look up publicly filed information on a publicly held company,
display the EDGAR Database home page (see Figure 11-13). Click the Search The
EDGAR Database hyperlink to display the Search The EDGAR Database Web page
shown in Figure 11-15. This Web page doesn’t actually let you begin a search, but it
lets you choose the type of search you want to perform: Quick Forms Lookup or WAIS.
Figure 11-15 The Search The EDGAR Database Web page.
A Quick Forms Lookup search works when you know the exact name of the company
you want to find information about. A Quick Forms Lookup search doesn’t work if you
don’t know the company name, or if you want to look up mutual fund information,
because the Quick Forms Lookup form doesn’t provide adequate space to precisely
identify mutual funds.

You can’t use the Quick Forms Lookup search to look up mutual fund infor-
mation because the search form only allows you to enter the first 20 char-
acters of an entity name, and the first 20 characters of many mutual funds
are the same because each fund name starts with the fund family name.
A WAIS search looks at header information in the filed documents. A WAIS search
works well if you don’t know the exact company name, or if you can’t precisely
identify the company or mutual fund name using the 20-character limit constraint that
exists on the Quick Forms Lookup search.

To begin a search, follow these steps:
1. Select the form.
Use the Select The Form drop-down list box to indicate whether you want to look
at all forms or just a subset of forms. Selecting All looks for all forms. Alternatively,
you can select a specific form, such as 10-K or 10-Q.
2. Identify the company.
Use the Enter A Company box to identify the company or mutual fund you want
a form for. You can enter up to the first 20 characters of the company name, but you
only need to enter enough of the name to uniquely identify the company.
3. Select a range of filing dates.
Specify the range of filing dates you want to search by clicking one of the entries in
the What Date Range list box: Now, Last Week, Last Two Weeks, Last Month, or

When a Quick Forms Lookup search won’t work, you must search the EDGAR archives
using a WAIS search. A WAIS search looks at header information for form filings in

because mutual fund names are so similar within a fund family.
To perform a WAIS search, click the Search The EDGAR Archives hyperlink on the
Search The EDGAR Database Web page (see Figure 11-15). When you do, the Search
EDGAR Archives form is displayed, as shown in Figure 11-18. To search for informa-

The Search EDGAR Archives form, which is what you use to perform a WAIS
search, allows you to include Boolean operators in your search argument. The
Boolean operators are AND, OR, NOT, and ADJ. The AND operator lets you
combine two terms so that the search engine finds only forms that use both
the terms you specify. The OR operator lets you join two terms so that the
search engine finds forms that use one or both words. The NOT operator lets
you specify that forms using a particular term should be excluded. The Ad-
jacent operator, ADJ, lets you ensure that your search only finds forms in
which one word follows another word—or stated another way, that the
second argument you enter is adjacent to the first argument.

much of the macroeconomic information provided at the site is very good reading—
especially for anybody involved in the banking industry.

The GPO Web site’s Search Terms box accepts AND, OR, NOT, and ADJ logical
operators. These search term arguments work the way you expect—as long as you
already have some search service experience. The GPO Access Web site search engine
also supports more complex searches, as described in the following list:
• You can use quotation marks as the functional equivalent to the adjacent Boolean
operator within a search query. For example, if you want to look for something related
to the government printing office, you could search both on the phrase “government
printing office” and on the phrase government ADJ printing ADJ office. Both search ar-
guments would return the same results.
• You can create complex search arguments by using multiple Boolean operators. A
complex search argument could be used to look for documents that include refer-
ences to “Department of Education” AND “bilingual education” AND “grants.”
• You can use parentheses to nest your Boolean logic just like Boolean logic in Microsoft
Excel. For example, you could perform a search on (bilingual OR ESL OR “second lan-
guage”) AND (education OR curriculum).
• You can use the asterisk symbol (*) as a wild card. For example, if you wanted to look
up all words with “Congress” as its root you could type Congress*. The search engine
would then look for anything that began with the word “Congress”, such as
Congressional or congressperson.
• The GPO search engine employs a stop word list. It lists words that are not indexed
in the database or can’t be used in a search, including AND, IS, IT, OR, SO, THE,
and many others. (Stop word lists are described for each of the search engines. Click
the Helpful Hints For Searching hyperlink, which is displayed in multiple places
throughout the site.)

Some older documents also use the .tif file format. The .tif file format is a

As a result, .tif images aren’t included in the index and therefore won’t be
returned in search results lists. You might still find a .tif document, however,
if you don’t locate a document by using a search engine but rather find it from
a list of documents.

The IRS provides four file formats: .pdf, PCL, PostScript, and .sgml text. Prob-
ably the most common format is .pdf, and it is the one you’ll want to use if
you have a copy of the .pdf reader Adobe Acrobat Reader. If you have a
printer that supports Hewlett-Packard Printer Control Language, known by
the abbreviation PCL, you can download a copy of a form stored in the PCL
file format. Similarly, if you have a printer that supports the Adobe PostScript
printer language, you can download a PostScript version of the document.
If you download either a PCL or PostScript version of the document, you need
to use your operating system to print the publication file. You typically do this
by copying the PCL or PostScript file from your disk to your printer. (Refer to
your operating system documentation for information on how to do this.)
You can also use the .sgml text file format if you want to print just the tex-
tual portion of the instructions or forms. The .sgml text format doesn’t pro-
vide a form, however. It provides only the textual instructions.

ireless Internet access is a technology that allows you to send and receive e-mail
as well as perform limited Web browsing using a cell phone, a pager, a Personal
Digital Assistant (PDA), or a cellular modem with a laptop computer. The wireless
Internet experience varies greatly based on the type of device you choose, but it can be
very useful to people who work away from the office or home. This chapter briefly
describes and reviews these services.

MBA’s Guide to the Internet - Electronic Edition
The coverage and reliability for wireless Internet devices is usually identical to the digital
cellular coverage. So in large metropolitan areas you may experience good coverage, but
then encounter little or no service in outlying areas and rural regions. Even within the
zone of coverage, however, there are often areas and times when you won’t be able to make
a connection, especially within buildings.
The cost of wireless Internet access is much higher than that of land-based services. One
of the least expensive services is Palm.net, at $9.99 per month for a small number of
e-mails and information transfers. Unlimited access generally runs $40 to $70 per month,
depending on the device and the company. Compare this to dial-up 56Kbps access that
runs about $20 per month for unlimited access, or broadband access that starts at $40
to $60 per month for 256Kbps and faster unlimited connections.
Wireless Internet devices also have decreased functionality for e-mail and Web brows-
ing. All or most wireless devices can’t display anything other than plain text (therefore
you should send only short, plain text e-mails to people with wireless access). Similarly,
very few wireless devices can browse normal Web sites. Instead, they must use pages
designed specifically for the device. Those that can browse the Web have slow connec-
tions (9600Kbps, 14.4Kbps, or 19.2Kbps), making Web pages download very slowly,
and they may also have small screens, which results in a lot of scrolling.

If you use a device that can display full Web pages with images, you can dra-
matically improve the speed in which pages load by disabling the display of
images in your Web browser.
Despite these disadvantages, devices with wireless Internet access are extremely conve-
nient. You can carry most devices in a purse or pocket and use them to access the Internet
from almost anywhere in town. Typically, the devices aren’t designed solely as Internet
devices, which can partially offset their marginal Internet capabilities.

Digital cellular phones that include wireless Internet capabilities can make acceptable
and relatively low-cost devices for infrequent e-mail and Web use, but they are at their
best when used in conjunction with another device, such as a laptop or PDA.
The advantages of using a cell phone to wirelessly access the Internet depend on con-
venience and cost. For the many people who already carry a cell phone, there is no need

to carry extra devices. The additional cost for a cell phone with Internet capabilities is
also low or nonexistent. Moreover, the per-month additional charge for wireless Internet
access is typically low, ranging from free (for basic services) to $20 per month for more
complete service.
Despite the cost and convenience of cell phones, they’re really not very good Internet
tools. All content appears on a small screen that can display only 5 to 30 words at a time,
often with no graphics capabilities. Web access is usually limited to several built-in “Web
sites” that you can access, but there is no way to view general Web sites. In addition,
these special Web sites are generally slow, limited in capability, and difficult to navi-
gate and enter text in. E-mail messages usually can be sent to your phone using only
a special Web page or e-mail address (although some phones can receive standard e-mail).
Additionally, e-mails received by your cell phone cannot display images or formatted
text. Moreover, entering text using the number pad is very slow. Each letter typically
requires a couple of keystrokes, making them a challenge to use for sending e-mail.
NOTE

If your e-mail account supports forwarding messages to other e-mail ad-
dresses, you could forward the messages sent to your primary e-mail account
to your cell phone.
Although cell phones by themselves are not very efficient at using the Internet, some
cell phones can be used to provide laptops or PDAs with adequate wireless Internet
access. The connection speeds are acceptable, typically 14.4Kbps to 19.2Kbps, and the
cost is low, since you pay for connection time as if it was a normal cell-phone call.
However, connecting the cell phone to your PDA or laptop can be awkward. The setup
usually requires a special adapter on the cell phone and a modem on the laptop or PDA.

The advantages of e-mail-capable pagers, such as the Motorola PageWriter or the

There’s no need to periodically check for messages because your e-mail is received
immediately, and you’re notified by a buzz or alarm, just like a normal page. The devices
cost from $170 to around $400, have monthly fees that start at $20 per month, and
their battery life is extremely long. Since the devices use the pager network to send and
receive messages, coverage is much better than any other wireless Internet access—you
can use them anywhere that you can receive a page.
Unfortunately, e-mail pagers are generally useless for composing messages and using
the Web. You can send plain text messages by typing them on a tiny keyboard built
into the pager, but this is awkward and slow. As with cell phones, e-mail and Web
content (when available) is displayed as text-only and requires a lot of scrolling. Pag-
ers with Web capabilities have an even more limited selection of sites that can be ac-
cessed than do cell phones, with no ability to browse normal Web sites.

Palm OS devices, such as those by Palm Incorporated and Handspring, are a good
choice for people who want to read and create e-mail on the go as well as do limited
Web browsing.
Palm devices with built-in wireless Internet capabilities, such as the Palm VII, have a
number of advantages over other devices, primarily ease of use and relatively good e-
mail functionality. Composing messages is easier than on any other device lacking a full-
size keyboard thanks to Palm OS’s good handwriting-recognition program. The Palm
VII is the first PDA to include wireless connectivity out of the box, making it extremely
easy to configure. The Palm OS is also simple and easy to use overall, and the e-mail
and the included “Web clipping” applications are Spartan but effective. The costs are

When using an external modem, Palm devices can access normal Web sites

Although Palm devices do a respectable job with a number of Internet tasks, they still
have limited functionality. Without additional software, the Palm VII can only send
and receive messages using a single Palm.net e-mail account. Additionally, formatted
text, images, and attachments aren’t supported, as shown in Figures 12-1 and 12-2.

The display of most Palm OS devices is small, with a very low 160x160 resolution
(compared to the lowest resolution supported by PCs—640x480), which leads to a lot
of scrolling. Web browsing can only be done on certain sites by using built-in or
downloadable “Web clipping” applications—other Web sites won’t work, (see
Figure 12-3).

Microsoft Pocket PC-based devices, such as Compaq’s iPaq H3650, provide the best

Web browsing services. The better services, however, come at a higher price and mean
both shorter battery life and increased complexity.
Pocket PC e-mail is supported using any POP or IMAP mail account and can open
Microsoft Word, Excel, and HTML attachments. Composing new mail is easy using
handwriting recognition or a built-in keyboard, depending on the type of device you

320x240 with 4,096 or 65,000 colors, compared to the Palm VII’s 160x160 grayscale

The increased functionality provided by Pocket PC devices comes at a price and means
extra complexity, however. Most Pocket PC devices cost at least a hundred dollars more
than Palm OS devices. In addition, few Pocket PC devices have built-in wireless Internet
capabilities. To get Internet access, you must buy a wireless modem and pay a monthly
fee for access (around $40 per month for unlimited access) or use a compatible digital
cell phone.

The most fully featured of the wireless Internet devices, laptops are the most economical
wireless option (provided you already own the laptop). Laptop owners who need full
Internet access only need a compatible cell phone to complete the setup.
The advantages of using a laptop for wireless Internet access are the complete support
for all aspects of the Internet and the relatively low cost. Anything you can do on a wired
connection you can do on a laptop with a wireless connection. If you already have dial-
up Internet access and a digital cell phone that works with your laptop, you can use the
Internet wirelessly for only the cost of your phone’s airtime. Otherwise, you can buy
a wireless modem and pay $20 to $50 per month for access.
The disadvantages of using a laptop are size and simplicity. Laptops are much bigger
and heavier than any other wireless Internet device, and while using a wireless modem
is simple, connecting to the Internet using a cell phone hooked up to a laptop can be
a trying experience. What’s more, using a laptop as a wireless device means you actu-
ally have two pieces of hardware to carry around—the laptop and the cellular phone.

and e-mail services suffer from limitations, but they can be powerful tools for people
who don’t work at a desk.

The first step that business users will want to take is learning how Web pages work, that
is, in terms of the actual mechanics. Understanding the basic structure of the Web
provides useful context for thinking about Web publishing.
Fortunately, the mechanics of Web publishing are surprisingly simple. A Web page,
which is what you create when you Web publish, is simply a text document with special
codes in it that tell a Web browser how to format and display the contents of the page.
In addition to the special formatting, Web pages can also contain embedded images—
which show up in the page onscreen but are stored separately on the server—and links
(hyperlinks) to other pages.
NOTE

A Web site consists of a collection of Web pages connected by hyperlinks.

Introducing HTML Code
HTML is the tool that Web developers use to create the Web pages that make up a
Web site. Although Web-authoring tools allow people to easily work without touch-
ing a line of HTML code, it helps to see how pages are actually built. Knowing a little
bit about HTML code will also help you to have a better idea about what someone you
hire to perform HTML editing and coding is actually doing.
To begin, let’s look at a simple sentence in HTML code. For example, every
programmer’s first assignment is to create code that displays the phrase “hello world,”
so let’s do that in HTML.
<html>
<p>hello world</p>
</html>
This is a complete Web page. It’s made up of two tags, which are the basic building
blocks of an HMTL document. The first tag, <html>, states that the document is an
HTML document and marks the beginning of the Web page. The second half of this
tag, </html>, comes at the end of the document and signifies the end of the page. The
second tag, <p>, signifies a new paragraph. The actual paragraph in this case is simply
“hello world,” and the paragraph ends with the second half of the paragraph tag, </p>.

All HTML tags begin with a left angle bracket (<) and end with a right angle
bracket (>). They usually begin and end similarly to the <html> and <p> tags—
the end of the tag is the same as the beginning, except for the addition of
a slash (/). For example, </p> closes the <p> tag, ending it.
Now let’s try to decipher something a little more complex. The next page includes an
image and a hyperlink. Figure 13-1 shows what this page looks like in a Web browser.
Here’s the code for it:
 <html>
 <p><img src=”images/un.gif”></p>
 <p>hello <a href=”http://www.un.org”>world</a></p>
 </html>
Figure 13-1
A simple Web page displayed in a Web browser.
Notice that the code includes an additional paragraph, which contains the <img> tag.
This is the inline image tag (which means it is an image displayed in a Web page instead
of an image that you can download), and it works like this. The tag starts with <img to
indicate that it’s an inline image, and then it contains one or more attributes. The only

332
332
332
332
332
MBA’s Guide to the Internet - Electronic Edition
attribute used here is the src attribute, which contains the URL (address) of the image
to be displayed. In this case, the image is the images/un.gif image. The tag ends with
a right angle bracket (>).
Notice also that in the middle of the “hello world” paragraph there is now a hyperlink.
The hyperlink tag starts with <a> and ends with </a>, and in between are the attributes
of the hyperlink and the text to which the hyperlink is attached. In this case, the only
attribute is the href attribute (which is the URL of the hyperlink). You can use the href
attribute by typing href= and then entering the URL to use, enclosed in quotes. The
tag is partially closed by the right angle bracket (>) following the href attribute, but don’t
let this fool you. This is so that the text to which the hyperlink is actually attached, world,
isn’t thought of as another attribute. The hyperlink tag actually ends after this text with
the </a> tag.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
There is no http://www.mycompany.com/ included in the <img> tag to iden-
tify the location of the image, but this is an important omission. Because the
URL given is missing the first part (http://www.mycompany.com/), Web brows-
ers assume that it should start in the same directory as the current Web page.
This is highly desirable because it allows you to move the entire Web site to
a different location (say, from a local folder to your Internet Web site) and still
have these links work.
Most Web pages are no more complex than the example just shown in Figure 13-1.
Most Web pages, in fact, simply provide text, images, and hyperlinks. Of course, in real
life, a Web page would provide considerably more text, several graphic images, and
probably numerous hyperlinks. But, boiled down to their very essence, most Web pages
are as simple as the Web page shown in Figure 13-1.
One final comment concerning HTML: If you create this same simple page using a
Web-authoring tool like, for example, Microsoft FrontPage, you will see some
additional HTML codes, or tags. Frequently, a Web-authoring tool sets up a more
complex page, including header information that isn’t displayed (using the <head> tag)
and the title of the Web page (using the <title> tag), delineates the body of the page
(using the <body> tag) and provides some additional information about the page’s
contents using meta tags (<meta>). Meta tags provide information to search engines
and use the <meta name=“keywords”> tag so that search engines can more easily and
accurately index the contents of a Web site.

In addition to HTML pages, a number of new technologies have been developed for
Web pages. Even if these technologies don’t apply to your Web site initially, it’s good
to know that if you need something more sophisticated than that provided by your
Web-authoring tools, the capability exists. The following list describes relevant Web
page technologies and what they do.
• Dynamic HTML introduces movement and the ability to react to a user’s actions
to Web pages. For example, text may highlight when a user moves the mouse over
it.
• JavaScript, Java, and ActiveX are technologies that provide a way of performing
complex tasks within a Web page and can even function as full-featured programs.
These technologies are complicated—and using them is best left to a professional
Web developer.
• CGI scripts is a technology used on some Web servers to provide server-based
features such as visitor counters and discussion groups.
• XML stands for Extended Markup Language. XML provides a way of giving detailed
content information about a Web page, allowing for more meaningful searching and
information gathering.

Although a great deal of exuberance surrounds the Internet and especially the Web,

Advertising
The Web lets you create powerful advertisements and publicity for a very modest cost.
The quickest way to visualize this is to think of your Web site and its Web pages as
substitutes for enhanced versions of any telephone directory advertising you do now.
It’s not an exaggeration to say that anything you can do in a directory listing or
advertisement, you can do better and more cheaply using a Web page. You can also
change and update your information more frequently as well.

The Web really levels the playing field for small businesses and nonprofit
organizations. A small business or nonprofit organization can create a Web
site as good or better in many ways than a larger company’s Web site with-
out a large amount of expense or time, giving it an unprecedented ability to
compete and communicate.
Publishing

Publishing
Many organizations are de facto publishers. For example, if your business creates and
distributes brochures, newsletters, product or service literature, or similar items, you are
actually publishing. The Web provides a convenient way to complement or even replace
this paper-based publishing.
Developing material for publication on the Web doesn’t cost any more than
developing equivalent material for paper publishing. But with the Web, you don’t have
the costs of printing or mailing. Furthermore, with the Web, you can more quickly
update your information.
Information Collection

In addition to the advertising and publishing advantages that the Web offers to
organizations, the Web also offers the ability to collect information from the people
for whom you advertise and publish. You can put forms right on a Web page to
collect information from the visitors to your site. For example, you might gather names
for a mailing list, get feedback from customers, or take in sales orders.

One further advantage of the Web that is of great value is the opportunity for

ability, transaction processing lets you use the Web as a virtual store, salesperson, or

NOTE
NOTE

NOTE
Chapter 15 discusses in more detail the work involved in setting up a Web site
that includes transaction processing.
Using the Web for transaction processing is considerably trickier than using it for
advertising or publishing. Obviously, your Web pages need to list and describe the
products you sell. But practically speaking, you need to do more than simply list
products or services. Good Web stores have the following features:
• Information about product availability and about the lead times for ordering items
that aren’t immediately available.
• A variety of ways to track down your products and services so that they are easy to
find and buy.
• A shopping cart feature that lets customers build a list of the items they want.
• A checkout feature that lets customers easily order all the items in their shopping
cart. (It’s during this checkout process, of course, that customers provide their credit
card numbers and shipping instructions.)
• A non-Web way for resolving problems the Web store can’t handle, such as lost or
damaged goods.

Regardless of what you think about Amazon.com, you should visit their site
(http://www.amazon.com)—even if you compete with them (perhaps espe-
cially if you compete with them). They’ve done an impressive job of provid-
ing numerous paths to find their products and different ways to search
through their inventory. For example, they have several different bestseller lists
for Microsoft Excel books, each listing books in a different order for a different
group of Excel readers. We strongly suspect their several bestseller lists of Excel
books, each really an alternative path to the same products, boost their sales
of Excel books because they make it more likely someone will find one of
them.

More than anything else, useful content is the single most important feature of an

you are providing useful content.
Easy Navigation

Although good content is the most important feature of an effective Web site, good
content needs to be supported and enhanced by good site layout. Not only should visitors
be able to easily find what they’re looking for but the organization of Web pages and
hyperlinks should also give visitors a clear idea of the site’s contents at a glance from the
home page.
Visual Appeal

Aesthetics is very important for Web sites, but it is also the part of Web site creation
that is most overemphasized by many businesses. Professional artists and programmers
are hired to create custom interfaces using trendy technologies, and altogether too much
time, money, and resources are spent making sites look sophisticated instead of filling
them with good content.
A flashy site may grab the attention of visitors, but a clean and simple site can be just
as effective (or more so), and much less expensive to create and maintain. Complex effects
and graphics can also make a site slow to download and confusing to use—not to mention
that sophisticated Web page programming can be incompatible with older browsers,
along with some handheld devices and standalone Internet appliances.

As you might imagine, more than one organization has stalled trying to decide how to
develop a Web site. For this reason, we recommend that you consider employing a
bulletin-board methodology for developing your Web content. By this, we mean that
you could develop the content for your Web site in much the way that the content for
the bulletin board in your coffee room or at your local market is developed.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
You should spend a small amount of time planning your site’s structure, even
if you use a bulletin board approach. Your site structure doesn’t have to be
perfect, but taking an hour or so to plan how you want to structure content
on your site can help keep your site from degenerating into chaos.
Following a bulletin-board methodology, as you find or create some appropriate Web
content, you simply pin the content to the bulletin board—or post the content to your
site. When content needs to change, you update the content or replace it. If content
needs to be removed, you remove it, or unpin it, from the bulletin board.
This bulletin-board methodology is somewhat opposite of the strategy taken by larger
companies, which is to treat a Web site like a software product—something that needs
extensive research, development, and testing before it can be rolled out. The advantage
of this large-system-development approach is that the site usually hits the pavement
running strong, which is important for the IPO-focused high-tech companies of today’s
business world that can get tens of thousands of visitors their first day online.
However, the software product methodology doesn’t work as well for smaller businesses
and organizations because it delays and may even kill the project if the resources
expended in developing the site so burden the project that it never gets completed.
Accordingly, we suggest that you think about a Web site as something that’s constantly
under construction, where you post content as it’s created or updated, and where you
revise as needed, thereby letting your site grow and become more polished naturally,
almost organically. Since smaller companies probably won’t be immediately generat-
ing the huge amount of traffic that larger companies can often get as soon as their sites
go live, they’re free to create a site that may initially be less-than-perfect, and then slowly
expand and refine it. In summary, we suggest that you think about your Web site as
looking more like an electronic bulletin board than a software product.

Before you can begin constructing a Web site, you need to lay a foundation by acquiring
a domain name and choosing a company to host your site.

Picking a Domain Name
Picking a domain name is a small step in the creation of a Web site, but in many cases
your domain name is at least as important as the name of your business. Your domain
name identifies your site, and by extension, your business or organization. You actu-
ally have two choices to make in picking a domain name: You need to pick a host name,
and you need to pick a top-level domain.
Picking a Host Name
Picking a Host Name
Picking a Host Name
Picking a Host Name
Picking a Host Name
Several points should be considered when picking a domain name. First of all, you want
your domain name to be descriptive of your business or organization. Your first choice
is your business’s name, but in some instances you might choose a domain name that’s
based on your business’s purpose instead. For example, it might be much better for a
business named Vladimir Berkowitz Faucets, Inc. to select the www.greatfaucets.com
domain name instead of www.vladimirberkowitzfaucets.com.
Second, your domain name should be easy to remember and spell. While a name like
www.rhythm.com may be short and easy to remember, some people will have trouble
spelling rhythm, potentially eliminating a large number of visitors. Perhaps something
like www.beat.com would be a better choice.
Third, short domain names are far preferable to long ones, although not if the name
is difficult to remember. This is particularly important since most of the desirable short
domain names have already been taken. It may be tempting to abbreviate your domain
name to shorten it, but do this only if the abbreviation doesn’t make the name harder
to remember.

Besides the domain name itself, you also need to choose which top-level domain to use,
such as .com or .net or .org. By far the most popular top-level domain to use is .com. Since
this is the top-level domain most people will look under first, we recommend that
businesses look for a .com domain name. The .net domain is more appropriate for ISPs,
Web hosting companies, and other Internet technologies companies. Nonprofit orga-
nizations should probably use the .org top-level domain, although depending on the

nature of the organization you might also consider registering your domain name with
a .com top-level domain.
Once you’ve come up with some ideas for domain names, it’s time to check for their availability.
Because a large number of domain names are registered every day, make a list of alternative
domain names in case the domain name you want is already taken. Then either go to any
registrar’s Web site (Network Solutions is the original, and most expensive, registrar at http://
www.networksolutions.com) or go to http://www.betterwhois.com and enter your domain name
idea in the box provided, as shown in Figure 13-2.

Although most companies will naturally choose a valid domain name, there
are a few restrictions on domain names to keep in mind. Domain names are
case insensitive; so don’t spend time thinking about what letters to capital-
ize. Also, you can use only letters and the hyphen character; but a hyphen
can’t start or finish a domain name. Lastly, the domain name can be a maxi-
mum of 67 characters long, not including the www. and the top-level domain
(.com, .net or .org).

Choosing a Web Hosting Service

Choosing a company to host your Web site can be a bewildering experience. With
thousands of Web hosting companies, each usually offering several different hosting
plans, it takes knowledge and a certain amount of patience to choose a Web hosting
company.
In general, however, you want to look at which features the company offers for its price
and the reliability and quality of the company’s service. The following list provides
summary descriptions of the features that are often available, along with information
you can use to determine which ones are relevant for your business.
• Virtual Domains/Domain Hosting. The Web hosting company you choose must
support virtual domains or domain hosting if you want to be able to use your own
domain name (which you do).
• FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions. If you plan on using FrontPage to create and
manage your site, then you want your Web hosting company to support FrontPage
Server Extensions. FrontPage Server Extensions allow you to easily publish your site
without using cumbersome tools such as FTP or the Microsoft Web Publishing
Wizard. They also provide server-based tools that can be indispensable when cre-
ating a Web site for an organization, such as the support for forms, discussion groups,
and Web site search capability.
• Disk Space Allotment. Most businesses have small sites, and generally don’t have
trouble fitting comfortably in the 25MB of Web space provided by even the most
barebones Web hosting plans you might look at. If you plan on having a large number
of images, audio, or video files on your site, however, disk space allotment becomes
an important issue. You may want to opt for a hosting plan that offers 100MB,
200MB, or unlimited disk space.
• Database Support and Active Server Pages. If you want to use a database on your
Web site and dynamically create pages based on data from the database (this is what
Active Server Pages are), your Web hosting company needs to support both data-
bases and Active Server Pages. (Setting up a database on your site is a difficult task,
although it is something you could hire a consultant to do, after which your busi-
ness or organization could then maintain it in-house.)
• Subdomains. Some Web hosting companies allow you to create subdomains for your
Web site, such as support.yourcompany.com or events.yourcompany.com. If your

company has separate divisions that want their own sites, subdomains are a cost-
effective solution, since you don’t have to pay additional registration fees for them.
• Mailing Lists, List Servers, and Majordomo. Depending on your business or orga-
nization, you may want to start an e-mail mailing list. A number of methods exist
for creating mailing lists, so if you think this might be a capability you need, con-
sider finding a Web hosting company that includes some sort of mailing list capa-
bility at little or no extra cost.
• Data Transfer Limitations. Some Web hosting companies have a limit on how much
data can be transferred per month. Every time someone views a page on your site or
downloads a file, that visitor is transferring data from your site. Similarly, when you
upload new pages or files to your site, you’re also transferring data. If your site goes
above its limit (because of lots of visitors or large file downloads), you’re charged extra.
• SSL (Security). Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a way of encrypting data that is trans-
ferred to and from a Web site, and it is typically used for Web stores that process
credit card transactions. As such, it is an important feature if you plan to set up an
online store.
• Technical Support. All Web hosting companies provide technical support for any
problems with publishing your Web site, Web site availability, e-mail, and so forth.
However, the type, quality, and availability of this support will vary. Not all com-
panies provide toll-free technical support phone numbers; not all companies pro-
vide 24-hour, 7-day-a-week (24/7) technical support.
• Web Server Speed. The speed of a Web server is fairly difficult to ascertain from
reading promotional material on a company’s Web site. Nevertheless, to be thorough,
you probably want to ask several questions: how much bandwidth is available, how
many sites does the Web server host, and how fast is the server? You might also ask
for the URLs of other Web sites stored on the same server and then visit those sites.
• Web Server Reliability. Even more important than Web server speed is the reliability
of the server. To assess Web server reliability, most people rely on the uptime per-
centage, which is something that can easily be measured. Most organizations aim for
99.9 percent uptime (roughly 9 hours of downtime a year).

Choosing a Web hosting company isn’t a permanent decision. You can eas-

up for a one-year contract to avoid setup fees). So don’t waste too much time
trying to find “the one.” If you later locate a better one, switch when your

Your business may already have a large amount of digital content that can be used on
a site with only a minimal amount of work. When we say digital content, we mean any
content that can be opened using a computer application such as a word processor or
an image-editing program. This includes data on hard drives, your local network, the
Internet (though be careful about copyrights), floppy and Zip disks, CD-ROMS, and
so forth.
To use existing digital content (which comes in many types), you first need to locate
it, and, if necessary, convert the content to an appropriate format for later importing
into your Web-authoring tool. (This tool might be FrontPage, for example.)
Just about any kind of digital content you have can be adapted for use on the Web:

• Word processor documents (.doc, .txt, .wpf) such as project reports, manuals, com-
pany objectives, newsletters, and notices to customers created with a word process-
ing program, such as Microsoft Word, AppleWorks, or Corel WordPerfect, can be
a big reservoir of content.
• Microsoft PowerPoint presentations (.ppt), lecture slides, or demos, might be great
additions to your site.
• Spreadsheet documents (.xls) might also be good content for your site, provided the
data relates to your site’s purpose and target audience. This could include financial
information, analyzed data from technical companies, or statistical data from tests.
• Digital images (.jpg, .gif, .png, .fpx) are a staple of any Web site. This includes logos
or graphics.
• Flyers, brochures, or other computer-created content stored in some sort of computer
format (perhaps created using Microsoft Publisher or Adobe PageMaker) are also
excellent sources of content for a site.
• E-mails can often be a rich source of content for a Web site, although you must use
special care when using e-mail conversations. Special messages sent out to custom-
ers can be placed in a Web page for users who didn’t receive the e-mail, customer
questions and answers can be integrated into a Frequently Asked Questions page,
or visitor comments can be placed on a Feedback page (usually with names removed).
• Existing Web pages might seem an obvious source, but if your business or organi-
zation already has Web pages it has created for one reason or another, you should
probably evaluate how useful they would be on your new site.
• Sound files and/or video files (.wav, .au, .mp3, .mpg, .avi, .mov) are usually very large
and should generally be avoided, but you might find audio and/or video files that
would be perfect for your site. Use discretion with these files because of their large
size and the slow speed of most visitors’ Internet connections.

Not all content for your Web site is going to be available in digital format. Some of it
will exist in print form and yet more will need to be created from scratch.
In general, the new content falls into two categories: images and documents. Images
are usually created by using a digital camera, a scanner, or an art program of some sort.
Documents are generally created from scratch by using a word processor or spreadsheet
program, although some companies will give in to the urge to scan printed documents
that aren’t already available in digital format.

There are several ways to create new digital images for use on a Web site. Photographs
can be scanned into the computer using a scanner, imported using a Photo CD picture
disk or online image processing service, or they can be taken using a digital camera and
directly imported into the computer. Digital images can also be created in the computer
using an art program.
Documents

Documents are the other half of the new content equation, and, unfortunately, not every
document that belongs on your site is going to already exist, or at least not in digital
form. If you can’t find a digital version of content that you want for your site, retyp-
ing the document may become a necessity. However, in special circumstances you may
also be able to scan the document and use an optical character recognition (OCR)
program.
Although OCR programs have greatly improved and are now quite useful, unless you
have a long document that needs to be placed in its entirety on your site, it’s usually
faster to retype a document than it is to scan it, run it through the OCR program, and
then correct the mistakes.

OCR programs are standalone programs that convert a scanned document
into text that can be used in a word processing program or Web page edi-
tor. They can provide an easy way to digitize existing, typewritten content,
but these programs do produce errors in the scanned documents. Therefore,
we recommend that you carefully evaluate the amount of time involved in
correcting scanned documents before relying heavily on OCR programs.

When creating new content for use on a Web site, you can take specific steps to make
the content import into your Web-authoring tool more easily and more elegantly:
• Create any large amounts of text you want to use on your site using Microsoft Word
or another word processing program, and then either save the document in the
appropriate format for importing into your Web-authoring tool or save it directly
as an HTML document that the Web-authoring tool can then edit. It’s much easier
and more efficient to create and edit content of any substantial length in a dedicated
word processor.
• Avoid using complex formatting or graphics in documents. These generally don’t
import accurately into a Web-authoring tool. An exception to this rule is when the
program used to create the content has special HTML output capabilities that enable
it to handle complex formatting or documents. However, these exported pages may
prove difficult to edit, so test out this capability before you rely on it extensively.
• Before creating a large amount of content with a particular application, test out how
well the content can be imported by your Web-authoring tool or exported to HTML
from the application. Knowing the limitations of the process beforehand can save
a lot of time and money in the long run.
• Save new documents in a central content folder with a useful filename that allows
everyone working on the site to easily identify the document.

The precise steps you take to create your Web pages depend on the Web creation or
Web-authoring tool that you’ve selected. In general, you use a wizard to create a set of
blank Web pages and then add the text and images that you’ve already collected.
Starting with a Wizard

Most of the popular programs provide wizards that step you through the process of
creating blank Web pages. FrontPage works this way, for example. Using FrontPage’s
Web wizards is an efficient way to rapidly create a Web site, and they are especially
useful if you don’t have a clear idea of how your site should be structured.
When you use a FrontPage wizard, FrontPage creates many of the essential pages for
your Web, based on the information you type into the various screens. Figure 13-4
shows the wizard dialog box that asks which pages should be created for the site.

The FrontPage wizard also provides other dialog boxes that you use to enter your
company’s name and address, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses. Typically, a
wizard also lets you choose a design or coordinated look for your site.
Although these Web pages will need some modifications and you’ll still need to in-
sert your own content, they can streamline the process of creating your initial pages.

Despite the multimedia emphasis of the Web, text is still the heart of most good Web
pages. Besides being a clear and concise means of communicating to your visitors, text
also downloads very quickly, can be indexed by search engines, and is usually easier to
create than more visual forms of content.
To insert text into your Web page, follow these general steps:
1. Position the cursor where you want to insert the text.
Your Web-authoring tool will probably insert the entire contents of the file you
specify at the current location of the cursor, so place the cursor somewhere suitable.
2. Choose the command to insert the file.
Different Web-authoring tools have different names for this command. In FrontPage,
you click the Insert menu and then click File.
3. Identify the file.
When prompted by the Web-authoring tool, identify the location and then the file
you want to insert.
4. Select the file you want to import, and click Open.
The Web-authoring tool should import the text into your Web page.
You can move text by dragging, or you can move text by cutting and pasting. To move
text by dragging, select the text and hold down the mouse button as you drag the text
to its new location. If you want to copy the text rather than move it, simply hold down
the Ctrl key while you drag the text to its new (duplicate) location.
Moving and copying text by dragging takes some getting used to at first—especially
if you are sitting in an airplane and doing it on a laptop computer. But it is actually a
pretty handy method after you have become comfortable with it. If you want to copy

and move text with menu commands instead, you use the Edit menu’s Cut, Copy, and
Paste commands. To move text by using commands, select the text, click the Edit menu,
and then click Copy (if you want to copy the text) or Cut (if you want to move the text).
Then position the cursor at the exact location where you want to move or copy the text,
click the Edit menu and click Paste.

has an Insert Picture command you can use.

Your company probably won’t need to perform the exhaustive testing that large
e-commerce sites must go through when rolling out a new site, but testing your Web

from visitors. Testing generally looks at three areas: hyperlinks, Web browser compat-
ibility, and usability.

you publish your pages to the Internet.

In addition to testing for broken links and browser incompatibilities, you will find it
informative to perform some degree of usability testing.
Here are some recommendations for simple usability tests:
• Recruit people who aren’t involved in the Web site project to test your site. The
feedback of your customers or other people in your target audience can be invalu-
able in evaluating the effectiveness of your site. For very small businesses, even re-
cruiting family and friends to test your site can generate important feedback.
• Develop some purposeful tasks for your testers to perform, and then watch how they
accomplish them. You might use tasks such as “Find the company contact informa-
tion” or “Find the product information for product x.” If you need to interject and
help the testers, your site might need more work.
• Pay special attention to the navigational structure of your Web site. How well can
users locate information using your site?
• Test your Web site at a variety of resolutions. We recommend that you test your site
at 640x480 (a low resolution) and at 1024x768 (a typical high resolution).
• If you decide to publish your site immediately, perform the testing after it is pub-
lished. A short user survey on your Web site can also be a valuable way of gathering
feedback on the effectiveness of your site.

When you’re ready to make your Web site available to the general public on the World
Wide Web, you need to publish it to the Internet. Typically, publishing your Web to
your Web hosting company’s Web server is an easy step. All that really needs to hap-
pen is that the HTML documents and any another necessary files (such as images) need
to be copied to the Web server.
Many Web-authoring tools, including FrontPage 2000, provide built-in support for
publishing to Web servers. For example, in FrontPage, all you need to do is click the

In order for your Web site to succeed, you need to publicize it. There are a number of
ways to publicize your site, both on and off the Internet. The online methods include
search engines, online advertising, newsgroups, and mailing lists. Offline methods
include placing links on all print material your business or organization creates, Yel-
low Pages ads, and newspaper ads.

Since most people locate a Web site using a search engine or a directory, the most
important step you can take to publicize your site is to submit it to the top search
engines and directories. Although this process takes some time, it is very important.
Although you might be tempted, avoid using a search engine submission service. These
services usually offer to submit your site to hundreds of search engines for a sum of
money—sometimes with recurring fees. Since the vast majority of searches are conducted
on only a handful of search engines, this level of submission is superfluous. In addi-
tion, submission firms usually don’t submit your site to directories, or if they do, they
do an inadequate job of it. Take the time to submit to search engines and directories
yourself—it’s worth it.
Search engines automatically crawl (explore) the Web, examining Web sites and add-
ing the relevant information from each site into their search databases. Directories such
as Yahoo! take descriptions submitted by Web site authors and use human editors to
review the submissions. The editors then create a hierarchical, topic-based directory out
of the Web sites submitted that visitors can either browse by topic or perform a search
on. Hybrid search engines are usually search engines that also contain a human-created
directory. Editors create the directory by looking at the search engine’s results, the actual
Web sites, and sometimes sites that are submitted by site authors to the hybrid direc-
tory.
The type of search engine or directory determines how you’ll submit your site. Crawler-
based search engines generally request only your Web site’s URL, as shown in Figure
13-10. The search engine then automatically visits your site, determines the content
of your site, and adds it to the search engine’s database.

Although search engines generally look into your Web site for what content
is contained on pages other than your home page, this isn’t always reliable,
and it’s prudent to submit your two or three most important pages separately
to each search engine. But limit yourself to two or three pages; submitting
too many pages to the same search engine can actually hurt your site.
Directories require a somewhat larger amount of effort during submission. First, visit
the directory (such as Yahoo!) and perform some searches for content similar to your
Web site. Second, take note of the kinds of sites that are returned in the search results
and the categories under which they’re listed. It’s very important with directories to find
the most specific and appropriate category for your Web site, so do some exploring.

(Your site may belong in multiple categories. If this is the case, make a note of each one.)
Third, read the directory’s Site Submission Tips or the equivalent page. This will tell
you exactly the procedure the directory wants you to follow when submitting your Web
site. Most require that you navigate to the category under which you want to list your
site, and then click the Suggest A Site link. Fourth, in the actual submission form, as
shown in Figure 13-11, submit the title of your Web site (generally your official
business or company name), your site’s URL, and a 25-word-or-less description of your
site.

In addition to submitting your Web site to search engines and directories, a number
of other methods are available for advertising on the Web. Some of these are fairly
effective in increasing the number of visitors to your site, and some are probably a waste
of time and money. In the following sections we offer some recommendations on which
methods to consider and which to ignore.

Purchasing Banner Ads
The most obvious method of online advertising is the banner ad. Banner ads are the
ubiquitous (and often disregarded) rectangular ad boxes that adorn most Web sites. In
general, we recommend that you avoid paying for banner ads. They require too much
time and effort to create, cost money, and are limited in their ability to draw visitors
to your site.
Link Exchanges
Link Exchanges

Link Exchanges
Link Exchanges
One of the best methods of advertising online is to get other sites to link to your site,
creating what’s known as a link exchange. This method is cost-effective (free) and can
also increase your ranking in search engines that pay attention to the number of links
to a particular Web site.
You can establish links to your site in the following three ways:
• Use a Link Exchange service that allows you to exchange links with other random
sites.
• Join a Web ring of sites that are similar to your own.
• Contact sites personally and inquire about exchanging links.
Using a Link Exchange service usually doesn’t work well for most businesses and or-
ganizations. This is because the site that ends up linking to yours inevitably has noth-
ing in common with your site’s purpose, so it is unlikely to generate visitors who are
interested in viewing your site.
Web rings devoted to a topic covered by your site are an effective means of generating
traffic to your site. The way a Web ring works is that sites with a common topic con-
tact each other, decide to set up a Web ring, and then pay to place a banner ad for the
Web ring on their home pages, as shown in Figure 13-12. This banner ad is usually
configured with automatically updated links to other sites in the Web ring. By join-
ing the Web ring, your site becomes accessible through these links and is also listed in
the Web ring’s directory. The site at http://www.webring.com is a good place to look
if you are interested in joining a Web ring.

Figure 13-12 A Web site with a couple of Web ring ads.
Another method of establishing links to your site is to manually identify Web sites
useful to your visitors with which you can exchange links. Once you’ve identified sites
that cover similar or related topics, contact the sites’ Webmasters about setting up a link
exchange. Predictably, one way to convince a site to exchange links is to place a link to
their site on your site, send them an e-mail informing them of this, and then suggest
that they link to your site as well.

Newsgroups in general aren’t the best place to publicize a Web site. Newsgroup par-
ticipants usually react negatively to ads placed on newsgroups, and the dynamic nature
of newsgroups ensures that anything you post will stay up for only a couple of weeks
before getting archived or deleted.

Creating a Mailing List
As described in Chapter 5, mailing lists are a voluntary form of bulk e-mailing that allow
you to easily send out mail, such as a newsletter or an update, to a large number of
people. Sending regular e-mails about your Web site or company to visitors who have
joined your mailing list is an effective way of reminding visitors about your company
and also featuring new or changed parts of your site. This increases the chances that they
will visit your site again.
Make sure that what you send via your mailing list is valuable content to subscribers.
Otherwise, your subscribers will delete the message or unsubscribe from your list. This
content can include tips, how-to sections, product specials, and new additions to your
site. Always include instructions for unsubscribing to the list with every message you
send.

If you are interested in creating a mailing list yourself, you can find out about
the process at http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8d/owner/owner.html. This
page at the L-Soft site provides a manual for creating a mailing list with Listserv.
If you want to add your mailing list to the Liszt site, go to http://
www.liszt.com/submit.html.
You can handle mailing lists using three different types of mailing programs: a stan-
dard mail program, a standalone bulk mail program, or a server-based mailing list
program. Refer to the suggestions found in the “Mailing List Etiquette” sidebar in
Chapter 5 before you get too far along.

Many businesses will find that Web-based mailing list providers such as
eGroups.com and Listbot (http://www.listbot.com) are a better solution than
the traditional Listserv and Majordomo programs. Additionally, many of these
Web-based list servers can be used for free, provided you don’t mind having
ads inserted in your messages.

You can get so caught up in publicizing your Web site online that you forget about the
more traditional channels of publicity, such as company publications, phone books, and
newspaper ads, and traditional marketing methods, such as speaking engagements.
Any time that you draw attention to your business or organization, you’ll increase the
number of visitors to your site—provided that you make it clear to your audience how
to find your site. Generally, you publicize your Web site in the same way that you would
publicize your business, but in addition to (or possibly instead of) providing a phone
number as a contact method, list your URL. Many people consider the Web their
preferred source of information, so any time you want to provide people with a way of
obtaining additional information about your business, list your URL.

Web publishing isn’t as complicated as you might think. In many cases, the Web simply
becomes another tool your business can use for sharing information. To make the process
as efficient and fast as possible, it helps to break down the work into eight discrete steps:
learning how Web pages work, developing a Web strategy, setting up your domain and
server, collecting and creating digital content, creating your Web pages, testing your site,
publishing your site, and then publicizing your finished Web site.

PowerPoint presentation, for example, can easily be turned into a Web presentation.
And, because PowerPoint supplies easy-to-use wizards, with PowerPoint almost
anyone create professional-looking Web presentations. This chapter explains how you
do this, starting off by describing how to create PowerPoint presentations suitable for
the Web, how to publish a presentation to the Web, and finally how to view a presen-

PowerPoint isn’t difficult to use—even if you’ve never worked with the program before.
To create a presentation—any presentation, not just a Web presentation—you take three
basic steps:
1.
Create a list of the slides you want to present.
2.
Add objects to the slides.
3.
Design the look of your slides and slide objects by adding special formatting and
special effects.
The paragraphs that follow explain these steps. Before we get to that information,
however, we want to provide a brief introduction to PowerPoint for the benefit of any
readers who aren’t familiar with this tool. If you are familiar with it, skip ahead to the
section “Using the AutoContent Wizard to Create an Outline.”

PowerPoint provides tools and prefabricated slides that you can use to build a presen-
tation you want to give. The slides in a presentation can look like the one shown in
Figure 14-1 and contain only text. But slides in PowerPoint can also easily show other
objects such as tables, as shown in Figure 14-2; charts, as shown in Figure 14-3;
organization charts; drawings and pictures; and even clip art.

do is actually very simple. Nevertheless, you will benefit from the very start by under-
standing several key terms.

A slide is the basic building block that you create using PowerPoint. The items that you
see in Figures 14-1, 14-2, and 14-3 are slides. If you were giving a slide show using
a 35mm slide projector, for example, and you created your slides using PowerPoint, what
you see in these three figures would be what you display on a screen or wall. In a Web
presentation, slides appear as individual Web pages.

A presentation consists of the slides you’ve created to show together at the same time.
For example, the slides in Figures 14-1, 14-2, and 14-3 might be a presentation.
A presentation is also (from PowerPoint’s perspective) a document file. What is stored
on your hard disk or on a removable disk, such as a floppy disk or Zip disk, is actually
the presentation file.

Text is the most common element you’ll use on your slides. The slide shown in
Figure 14-1, for example, simply uses text to introduce the presentation and the
presenter to the audience. Figure 14-2 showed a table, which is simply a grid of rows
and columns with text in the cells, or squares, of the table.
Text can also appear in a bulleted list as well. Figure 14-4 shows a simple slide that uses
a bulleted list.

In PowerPoint, you enter text and any other items into an area of a slide called a place-
holder. A chunk of text, for example, goes into a text placeholder. A picture, table, or
chart also goes into a placeholder.
Placeholders amount to boxes, or areas, that you use to affix things to a slide. You can
almost think of them as being like glue. Figure 14-5 shows the PowerPoint Program
window, which we’ll talk about in just a few paragraphs. But note that the window shows
a slide with a placeholder for entering a chunk of text to title the slide and another
placeholder for entering a bulleted list.

In addition to text, as just mentioned, you can place other items on a slide. PowerPoint
calls these items objects. For example, the chart shown in Figure 14-3 is an object—
a chart object, to be precise. But slides can include wide variety of objects.
Anything that you can create or store on your computer can probably be turned into
an object and then placed on a PowerPoint slide. Objects can be chunks of documents
you create using other programs like Microsoft Word or Excel, little images or pictures
that are stored as files on your hard disk, or even items like organization charts and
drawings that you create with PowerPoint’s many applets.

PowerPoint supplies several small programs, called applets. The applets are
essentially miniature programs that are built into the larger PowerPoint pro-
gram. PowerPoint includes the Microsoft Graph applet, for example, which
lets you create charts and graphs. The Microsoft Organization Chart applet,
also available from within the PowerPoint program, lets you create organi-
zation charts.

The easiest way for new PowerPoint users to create an outline is by using the
AutoContent Wizard. To use the AutoContent Wizard to create your outline, follow
these steps:
1. Start the AutoContent Wizard.
As you start the PowerPoint program, PowerPoint opens the dialog box shown in
Figure 14-6. To create a presentation using the AutoContent Wizard, click the
AutoContent Wizard option button and then click OK to start the AutoContent
Wizard.

When PowerPoint opens the AutoContent Wizard dialog box shown in Figure 14-9,
click the option button that best describes the general category of presentation you
want to create. This dialog box provides several buttons and category combinations:
General, Corporate, Projects, Sales/Marketing, and Carnegie Coach. When you click
an option button, the AutoContent Wizard displays a list of prefabricated presen-
tations within that category. You select one of these presentations—really they’re just
partially structured presentations—by clicking it. Click Next to continue.

ries—or at least do this the first few times you use the AutoContent Wizard.
The AutoContent Wizard supplies a rich set of thoughtful, well-structured
presentations, and especially as you are starting out, you can benefit by
using these presentations as models for your own.
4. Select the presentation style.
When PowerPoint opens the AutoContent Wizard dialog box shown in Figure 14-10,
use it to tell the AutoContent Wizard how you’ll deliver your presentation. If you
are going to publish your presentation to the Web—this could be an Internet Web
site or an intranet Web site—click the Web Presentation option button. Click Next
to continue.

5. Provide general information about the presentation.
When the AutoContent Wizard opens the dialog box shown in Figure 14-11, use
the Presentation Title box to name your presentation. Optionally, use the Footer box
to provide a footer that will appear at the bottom of each of the slides you create. If
you want the footer to include the date the presentation was last modified, or up-
dated, and the number of the slide, click the Date Last Created box and the Slide
Number box.

After you click Finish, the AutoContent Wizard creates a rough outline of your pre-
sentation and opens the presentation using its Normal view, as shown in Figure 14-12.
The Normal view includes the outline of the presentation (this appears in the pane along
the left edge of the PowerPoint Program window. The Normal view also shows the
selected slide in the main pane of the PowerPoint Program window. You’ll be able to
identify the slide because you’ll see your presentation title on the slide. If you chose
to enter a footer, you’ll also see this information at the bottom of the slide.

You enter and edit text in the Outline pane in the same way that you enter and edit
text in other programs. To begin entering text, click at the point where you want to enter
the text. Windows moves the insertion point to the exact location where you clicked
with the mouse. Anything you then type gets entered at the insertion point.
By default, PowerPoint inserts text as you type. You can, however, overwrite text. To
do this, press the Insert key. The Insert key is a toggle switch. By pressing the Insert
key, you toggle between the text insertion mode and the text overtype mode.
If you want to edit text, you generally select the text you want to edit by clicking and
dragging. Then you replace the selected text by typing the correct text.
You have a variety of ways to select text. You can click at the first character you want
to select and then drag the mouse to the last character you want to select. If you want
to select an individual word, double-click the word. If you want to select an entire line,
click the area in front of the line, just in front of the bullet, or the slide icon. But note
that if you select a slide title line of text, you’ll also select the bulleted text.
To delete text, select the text, click the Edit menu, and then click Clear. Or select the
text, and press the Delete key.

You can move text by dragging, or you can move text by cutting and copying. To move
text by dragging, first select the text. Then point to the text, and while holding down
the mouse button, drag the selected text to its new location.
If you want to copy the text rather than move the text, simply hold down the Ctrl key
while you drag the text to its new (duplicate) location.
If you want to copy and move text with menu commands instead, use the Edit menu’s
Copy, Cut, and Paste commands. To move text by using the moving commands, first
select the text, click the Edit menu, and then click Copy (if you want to copy the text)
or Cut (if you want to move the text). Position the insertion point at the exact loca-
tion where you want to move or copy the text, click the Edit menu, and then click Paste.
The Standard toolbar that PowerPoint supplies provides Copy, Cut, and Paste buttons.
You can use these buttons in place of the Edit menu’s Copy, Cut, and Paste commands.

One confusing feature of Office 2000 programs is that menu commands and toolbar
buttons don’t always appear. Office 2000 programs customize the toolbar and the menus
based on commands you are likely to use or have used in the past. Note, however, that
if you keep a menu open, Office programs such as PowerPoint typically add all of the
hidden commands.

When you point to an Outlining toolbar button with the mouse pointer,
PowerPoint displays the button name in a pop-up box. Use this trick if you
are not sure which button is which.
Reading from top to bottom, the first two buttons on the Outlining toolbar—the
Promote and Demote buttons—are for promoting or demoting outline text. To
promote outline text, simply select the text and then click the Promote button. (The

Promote button is the arrow that points left.) If you promote bulleted text, it moves
up to the next higher level—probably to the level of a slide.
To demote text, predictably, select the text and click the Demote button. (The Demote
button shows an arrow pointing right.) If you demote a slide title, the slide title be-
comes bulleted text on the preceding slide.
PowerPoint allows you to have bulleted text within a bulleted text list. In other words,
you can have bulleted text under a bulleted text item. Although this is technically
feasible, slides really don’t provide enough information for this level of detail. Typically,
this sort of information should be spoken information that you provide as you are talking
about the slide.
The Move Up and Move Down Outlining toolbar buttons let you move text up and
down. To move a line of text up, select the text and then click the Move Up button.
(The Move Up button shows an arrow pointing up.) To move text down, select the text
and then click the Move Down button. (The Move Down button shows an arrow
pointing down.)
If you move bulleted text up or down, you simply rearrange the bullet points. How-
ever, if you move slides up and down, you rearrange the order of the slides in the pre-
sentation.
The Collapse and Expand buttons allow you to show more outlining detail or to hide
outlining detail. To hide the lower levels of an outline—those levels below the slide title
level—select the portion of the outline you want to hide. Then click the Collapse
button. (The Collapse button shows a minus sign.)
If you later want to expand the previously collapsed portion of the outline, select the
previously collapsed lines of the outline. Then click the Expand button. (The Expand
button shows a plus sign.)
The Collapse All and Expand All buttons are located beneath the Collapse and Ex-
pand buttons on the Outlining toolbar. When you click the Collapse All button,
PowerPoint collapses the entire outline so only the slide titles show. If you collapse the
entire outline using the Collapse All Toolbar button, click the Expand All button to
later restore the outline.

The Summary Slide button is the second to the last button on the Outlining toolbar.
When you click the Summary Slide button, PowerPoint adds a summary slide to your
outline. To use this toolbar button, position the insertion point at the very end of your
outline and then click the Summary Slide button so that your Summary Slide is added
to the end of your presentation.
The Show Formatting button is the last button on the Outlining toolbar. When you
click the Show Formatting button, PowerPoint shows the text using the text format-
ting that PowerPoint is using on the slides. The Show Formatting toolbar button is a
toggle switch, so if you click it again, PowerPoint hides the text formatting.

After you finalize your outline, it’s a good habit to check your spelling. Remember that
your outline text appears on your slides, so the easiest time to check your spelling is when
you complete the outline.
To check your spelling, click the Tools menu and click Spelling. If no misspellings are
discovered, a message box tells you that the spelling check is complete, as shown in Figure
14-14.
Figure 14-14 The Spelling Is Complete message box.
If one or more spelling errors are found, PowerPoint opens the Spelling dialog box, as
shown in Figure 14-15. PowerPoint uses the Not In Dictionary text box to identify
the word that appears to be misspelled. To fix the spelling, type the correct spelling in
the Change To box or select one of the words in the Suggestions list box. PowerPoint
fills the Change To box initially with possible correct spellings.

Once you or PowerPoint has entered the correct spelling in the Change To box, click
the Change button to correct the misspelling. Or, if you want to change the spelling
everywhere it appears in the outline, click the Change All button.
If the word is not really a misspelling, click the Ignore button to ignore the single
occurrence found, or click the Ignore All button to ignore every occurrence in the
outline.
If you are using words that are correctly spelled but are not in the spelling dictionary—
this may be the case if you are clicking the Ignore or Ignore All buttons—click the Add
button to add the word to the custom spelling dictionary. You typically add words such
as people’s names and specialized business or industry terms to the custom spelling
dictionary.
If the Spelling command identifies a misspelling but doesn’t identify the correct spelling
using the Suggestions box, you can try to get additional suggestions. To do this, enter
another guess at the spelling in the Change To box and then click the Suggest button.
PowerPoint will use the word you entered in the Change To box to look for other
suggested spellings.

A table is a grid of columns and rows. The cells that make up the table—a cell is the
intersection of a column and row—can contain text, number values, or even pictures.
Tables are powerful tools for organizing information—especially quantitative informa-
tion like financial data.

Adding a Chart
PowerPoint comes with a charting tool called Microsoft Graph, which enables you to
produce charts that you can then use on your PowerPoint slides.
To add a chart to a slide, follow these steps:
1. Tell PowerPoint you want to add a chart.
Click the Insert menu and then click Chart to open the Data Sheet window and add
a placeholder in the center of the slide that is displayed. Figure 14-26 shows how
this looks before you begin making changes.
Figure 14-26 The Data Sheet window as it first appears.
2. Describe the data that you want to plot in a chart.
Use the first column for the data series names. Use the first unnumbered row of the
data sheet for the data category names. Use each numbered row for a data series.
After you enter the data values, data series names, and data category names infor-
mation in the data sheet, you can close it. Microsoft Graph uses the data sheet in-

3. Specify the chart type.
Microsoft Graph initially plots your data in a three-dimensional bar chart, but
Microsoft Graph supplies more than a dozen types of charts. To choose or review the
chart types available, first verify that the Chart Object is selected (if it isn’t, click it
to select it). Click the Chart menu and click Chart Type to open the Chart Type
dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-28. Select a chart type from the Chart Type list
box, and then select a chart subtype by clicking one of the pictures to the right of
the list box. After you’ve selected a chart type and subtype, click OK to make your
change.

3. Describe the organization structure.
Each of the boxes in the organization chart represents a position. Some positions are
manager positions and some positions are subordinate positions. While the Microsoft
Organization Chart program initially creates a rough guess of your organizational
structure, you need to update this organizational structure to reflect reality. You do
this by removing any unneeded boxes and adding new boxes.
• To add a subordinate position, click the Subordinate button and then click the
box that represents the subordinate’s manager. For example, if you want to add
a fourth subordinate to the Manager box, click the Subordinate button and then
click the Manager box.
• To add a co-worker to a position, click the Co-Worker toolbar button and then
click the position that has the co-worker. There are actually two Co-Worker
buttons. One button adds a Co-Worker box to the left of the existing box you
click, and the other button adds a new Co-Worker box to the right of the box you
click.
• To add a manager, click the Manager toolbar button and then click the Position
box that is managed by the manager.
• The Organization Chart toolbar also supplies an Assistant button. You can use
the Assistant button to add an Assistant Position box to some other Position box.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
The buttons you use to add subordinates, co-workers, managers, and assis-
tants aren’t difficult to use, and your best bet is simply to experiment with
them. To remove an Organization Position box, click it, click the Edit menu,
and then click Cut or press the Delete key.
4. Describe individual positions.
Click a Position box. After it becomes a text box, enter the position information you
want. Typically, you type the name of the person filling the position in the first line
and you type the person’s title in the second line. You can also include a line or two
of comment or general information. You can edit this Position box text in the same
way that you edit text anywhere else. Continue describing the other positions.

It’s possible that your presentation’s slides will already look the way you want them after
you create your outline and add any objects. When you create a new presentation using
PowerPoint, you base your presentation on an existing design template—which may
give you just the look you want. When you want to change the look of your presen-
tation, however, you can do so in a variety of ways, as briefly discussed in the paragraphs
that follow.

PowerPoint supplies design templates that provide a color scheme that is used for all
the presentation’s slides: the title master slide, which shows how your title slide looks;
a slide master slide, which shows how the non-title slides in your presentation look; and
a set of auto layouts. An auto layout is just a slide that includes one or more object
placeholders.
You can choose a design template in two ways. First you can select a design template
before you begin creating your presentation. When you start PowerPoint, the first dialog
box lets you indicate whether you want to create a new presentation using the
AutoContent Wizard, a design template, or a blank presentation. Second, you can apply
a design template to an existing presentation.
If you indicate you want to create a new presentation using a design template, PowerPoint
opens the New Presentation dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-32. The Design Tem-
plates tab will be open, and what you can do is select one of the design templates from
the list provided. The Design Templates tab provides a Preview box you can use to see
what the design template looks like. After you find the appropriate design template,
click OK.

Customizing the Master Slides
Changing the design template used for a presentation represents the most fundamental
customization you can make to the appearance of your presentation. The next most far-
reaching change you can make is to alter the master slides used to create the individual
slides in your presentation. A master slide, essentially, is just a blueprint for creating
the individual slides.
You can make a variety of changes to a master slide, and thereby to all of the slides in
your presentation. First, however, you need to display the master slide. To display a
master slide, click the View menu, click Master, and then click either Slide Master, Title
Master, Handout Master, or Notes Master. When you are changing the appearance of
your presentation, you work with Slide Master (which specifies how the individual
slides in your presentation look) and Title Master (which specifies how the first title
slide in your presentation looks).
After clicking either Slide Master or Title Master, PowerPoint opens the appropriate
master slide. Figure 14-34 shows the Slide Master view in the PowerPoint Program
window. This slide master shows object placeholders and the font styles used.

exceptions, you can change any object you place on a PowerPoint slide. To do this, right-
click the object you want to change and choose Format Placeholder or Format Object from
the shortcut menu. PowerPoint opens a Format dialog box (the name varies depending
on what you right-clicked) that looks similar to the one shown in Figure 14-35.

The Web tab lets you specify some text replacement for a graphic object. You use the
Web tab when you are publishing a PowerPoint presentation to the Web. By specify-
ing text replacement for an object, you allow someone who doesn’t have a Web browser
capable of displaying graphics images to still be able to see your presentation’s infor-
mation.
The Format dialog box generally includes several other tabs as well, including a Col-
ors And Lines tab that lets you specify the fill color that should be used for the object
or placeholder; a Size tab that lets you size the object by providing its height and width;
a Position tab that lets you specify the location of an object by using text boxes and drop-
down list boxes; a Picture tab that lets you crop a picture image and make modest
changes to the image’s color, brightness, and contrast; and a Text Box tab that lets you
specify how text should be anchored inside a text placeholder box and what internal
margins PowerPoint should use for positioning text inside the placeholder. The Text
box tab also provides check boxes you can use to specify how text should wrap inside
the placeholder, how to resize the placeholder if the text is too large to fit, and even to
rotate text inside a placeholder.

the button with the large “B” on it, you boldface the selected text. Other Formatting
toolbar buttons let you make further specifications, control text alignment, change text
into a bulleted or numbered list, and so forth. You won’t have any problem figuring out
what various buttons do by experimenting to see their effects. If you make a mistake
or use a button that has an effect you don’t want to keep, simply click the Undo but-
ton, which appears on the Standard toolbar.

As long as you have the ability to store files on a Web server, you can publish a
PowerPoint presentation to that Web site. After you do this, anyone with the ability
to view the Web site can view the slides in your presentation. After the presentation
has been published to the Web site, the PowerPoint slides become, in essence, Web
pages.
To publish a PowerPoint presentation to a Web site, follow these steps:
1. Open the presentation.
Open the presentation you want to publish. If you have more than one presentation
open, verify that the presentation you want to publish is the active presentation.
2. Tell PowerPoint that you want to publish the presentation to the Web.
Click the File menu and click Save As Web Page to open the Save As dialog box,
as shown in Figure 14-37.
Figure 14-37 The Save As dialog box.
3. Describe how PowerPoint should create the Web pages.
Click the Publish button to open the Publish As Web Page dialog box, as shown
in Figure 14-38.

Use the Publish What buttons in the Publish What area to indicate whether you
want to publish the complete presentation or just a range of slides. Use the Browser
Support buttons to indicate for which Web browser you want to publish the pre-
sentation.
To describe what you want to publish and the browser you want to support, use the
Publish A Copy As area to specify where you want to publish the presentation.
Enter the pathname you want to use in the File Name box. The pathname includes
the drive letter, the folder name, any subfolder names, and the filename. If you don’t
know the pathname, click the Browse button to open the Publish As dialog box. This
dialog box lets you work with the familiar Save In box and Save In list box to iden-
tify the location you want to use for the Web pages.
4. Publish the Web pages.
After you describe where you want to publish the Web pages, click the Publish
button. PowerPoint then creates an HTML, or Web page, version of your presen-
tation and saves it in the specified location.

to display the slide in the main portion of the Web browser window. In a small frame
below the actual slide frame, the Browser window also shows your speaking notes.
If you publish the PowerPoint Web page to a Web server that’s connected to the
Internet, you will be able to view the PowerPoint presentation from any other computer
that’s connected to the Internet. This means, of course, that another option you have
for delivering your presentation is by having people view the Web pages with their Web
browsers.

As we’ve shown in this chapter, any PowerPoint presentation can be easily turned into
a Web presentation. The real work—as with all Web publishing—involves the creation
of good, interesting, rich content. After you’ve created and refined this content, how-
ever, you can publish a presentation to the Web simply by choosing a command and
providing a handful of information.

n a short chapter like this, we can’t describe everything you need to know to set up
a large, successful Web store. Some parts of the Web store development process go
way beyond the skills of even the most sophisticated business professional. But even so,
we can describe how you or a co-worker can add a simple Web store to your Web site.

Regardless of whether we are talking about the local corner market or a large Web store,
a store and its staff perform only four basic activities:
• Display the items for sale.
• Show which items are available for immediate purchase and which must be ordered.
• Answer questions from customers about items.
• Arrange for customers to purchase or, if necessary, backorder items.
Very small stores and large stores are required to do these four tasks. (Obviously, large
stores do more of all four things and with far greater sophistication.)

A Web store and its staff perform the same four tasks—except using a Web site rather
than a physical, brick-and-mortar location. A Web store displays items for sale, shows
which items are in inventory and which must be backordered, answers (or should answer)
questions from customers, and arranges for customers to purchase or backorder items.
Web stores like amazon.com, for example, usually do a good job of displaying items
for sale. All they need to do is create a Web page for each product they sell, as shown
in Figure 15-1, and then provide an easy-to-use search engine so that shoppers can find
products.

Press, the MBA’s Guide to Microsoft Excel 2000.

The Web-buying experience is in many ways inferior to the brick-and-mor-
tar experience because the shopper can’t physically examine the product. A
buyer can’t thumb through a novel, try on a pair of shoes, or test-drive a car,
for example.

Web stores also make it easy for people comfortable with computers to use the Web
to order an item. Figure 15-2 shows an amazon.com order form. Essentially, a shop-
per completes this form and clicks a button to place his or her order.
Figure 15-2
The amazon.com order form.
Web stores don’t do everything that a regular brick-and-mortar store does, and some-
times they don’t do things as well as a brick-and-mortar store. In a brick-and-mortar
store, you know whether a product is in stock simply by looking at the shelf; if you have
questions about a product, you can ask a salesperson.

Using an Inventory Database
Using an Inventory Database

Using an Inventory Database
An inventory database allows a Web store’s pages to access this database to report
on stock availability. Most of the sophisticated and all of the large Web stores use
inventory databases.
We suggest that, at least at first, you consider doing without this enhancement.
Adding an inventory database feature to a Web store requires the help of a pro-
fessional Web store developer, which is expensive. And the feature often doesn’t
deliver the benefits that it promises.
What we know about bookselling, for example, is that the large Web bookstores
(see Figure 15-1) only hint at stock availability. If amazon.com provides the avail-
ability description, “Usually ships in 24 hours,” that reportedly means the book is
stocked at amazon.com. But the availability description, “Usually ships in 1-2 days,”
actually means that amazon.com’s principal distributor had inventory yesterday. The
bottom line is that the often unreliable nature of inventory reports coupled with
the large up-front cost involved makes Web stores with integrated inventory sys-
tems impractical for most businesses.

The easiest Web store to set up is a simple non-interactive site. This site needs only to
describe the items you’ll be selling and tell customers how to contact you to place their
orders.
To describe the items you sell, set up a Web page for each item. Chapter 13 shows how
to set up Web pages. (That chapter also explains preparation necessary to begin post-
ing Web pages to a Web server, including registering for a domain name and signing
up for Web hosting.) Figure 15-3 shows a page from the Redmond Technology Press
Web site that describes an item for sale.

items are for sale. But especially for small-volume Web stores, this approach might be
the best.

If you don’t require a shopping cart feature, an interactive Web store doesn’t have to be
complicated. All you need to do is create a Web form that collects order information
from customers and then have the Web store send this information to a person who will
fill and process the orders.
NOTE

A shopping cart aggregates orders from a shopper, allowing the person who

server. You’ll also have to store at least the order form on a secure Web server
so that order information gets encrypted before it’s sent. For more informa-
tion about how this works, ask your ISP.

When the customer sends the order information to the Web store, depending on how
you’ve told the Web store to process the form results, one of two things happens:
• The Web store sends an e-mail to the Web store e-mail Inbox with the order, ship-
ping, and billing information.
• The Web store creates a text file on your Web server with the order, shipping, and
billing information.

Mechanically, an e-mail-based system would simply require someone to perform the
duties of a shipping clerk. These duties would include the following:
1. Checking the e-mail Inbox or the Web server order file for orders.
2. Printing e-mail order messages or the contents of an order file to use as pick lists.
3. Fulfilling orders using the pick lists.
4. Forwarding a copy of the pick list to the person performing the billing duties.

The simple system described here doesn’t aggregate orders automatically the way a
shopping cart does. But with low order volumes—a few orders a day—these deficien-
cies might not matter. A reasonably alert shipping clerk would be able to combine items
being shipped to the same address.

The two Web store options described in this chapter are easy to implement. But as we’ve
noted several times, you can become considerably more sophisticated in the way you
set up a Web store by tying it to an inventory database that provides stock availability
information and by setting up a shopping cart system so customers can easily purchase
multiple items.
If you want to implement a more complex Web store—one that uses these sorts of
features—you have two other choices:
• Contract with an e-commerce provider such as  BigStep.com, FreeMerchant.com,
Store.Yahoo.com, or JumboStore.com. You can visit these e-commerce providers’
Web sites for more information, but these companies will help you create Web stores
that include a shopping cart system.
• Build your own Web store from scratch by hiring developers. This approach can get
you exactly what you want, but it comes at a price. We’ve heard people say you can
do this for as little as $10,000. We think the minimum is probably several times this
amount if you want something that’s more unique than what an e-commerce pro-
vider will sell.

The work required to build a Web store goes beyond the skills of many business pro-
fessionals. But simple Web stores can be surprisingly easy to set up and can often provide
better service than the big Web retailers. For this reason, we think simple Web stores
are something that many businesses should consider. They can be profitable—especially
if they’re developed and run by retailers who already understand their customers.

I
n a business, an intranet is an internal network that uses Internet technology to support
real business applications and to provide departmental, interdepartmental, and
companywide communications solutions. To see how an intranet works, let’s look at a
real-life example—how Taco Bell communicates with its franchises.
Historically, the cost of communicating between Taco Bell corporate headquarters and
2,800 franchised stores was increasing. Each week, employees at headquarters spent
numerous hours assembling, photocopying, and mailing information packages to the
franchises. Sometimes these packages contained 1,500-page operations manuals, but
also franchised stores needed to receive recipes and information about new marketing
programs in a timely manner. In one unfortunate lag time, franchises received the tie-
in to the Spanish-speaking Chihuahua several days after “Quiero Taco Bell” became a
household phrase. Taco Bell needed to speed information dispersal and at the same time
cut the cost of transporting paper around the world.

422
422
422
422
422
MBA’s Guide to the Internet - Electronic Edition
By setting up an intranet, Taco Bell corporate now posts all the paper documents that
once had to travel through the mail to a network Web server by saving these documents
in a Web folder. Overnight, the Web site is rebuilt to include new documents, and
franchisees view this information the next morning at their site using a standard Web
browser. The documents they see online are nearly identical to those they would have
received in the mail.
Once Taco Bell decided on an intranet, the site was up and running in a couple of weeks.
The company is projecting annual savings of about $350,000, which includes former
costs for distributing newsletters and faxes, for sending bulletins, for training and
franchise administrations, and, of course, for printing and mailing those 1,500-page
manuals.
Technically speaking, the Taco Bell installation is an extranet, which uses the Internet
and special security to allow the franchisees at remote locations to access the corporate
intranet. But you get the picture.

How do you know if your business organization could benefit from an intranet? Well,
if your company distributes massive amounts of paper, such as Taco Bell was doing, you
should look into it. Employee directories, medical benefits descriptions, product speci-
fications, user manuals, price lists, marketing collateral, financial reporting systems, and
policies and procedures are all excellent candidates for intranet publication.
You should also consider an intranet if your business is involved in any of the follow-
ing processes:
• Consolidating information from multiple data sources. Do your customer service
representatives need to access customer information, order history, product informa-
tion, and enter sales orders while talking with a customer on the phone? Consider
how having all this information in one place will speed the transaction as well as
enhancing its accuracy.
• Communicating and collaborating with people who are geographically separated. Do
you have field offices that need daily up-to-date access to company information, and
do the employees in those offices need daily contact with the home office? Internet
services such as conferencing and e-mail can also be part of an intranet.

• Finding or requisitioning information or products. Do your employees need to find
and order supplies? Using an intranet for this process allows online access to cata-
logs and other reference material, saves trees by using an online order form, and
reduces personnel costs.
• Running a legacy client/server or mainframe application. Converting these programs
to intranet applications makes them available to all those who need them, not just
those able to access the out-of-date hardware and software.
If all this is starting to sound like a good idea for your business, the next step is to look
at the financial implications and then think about how to plan your intranet’s content.
Although creating a business plan is beyond the scope of this book, we will give you
one bit of data that can help with financial planning: One recent study showed that
a typical corporate intranet investment is achieving an ROI well over 1,000 percent and
that the typical payback period is within six to twelve weeks.
Planning Content

Planning Content
The kind of content you’ll place on an intranet depends on the business processes you
want to replicate. A typical intranet, though, will include the following basic types of
pages.
• A home page. The home page is the starting point for your intranet, as it is the starting
point for a site on the Internet. In general, the home page should be short and to the
point, should indicate the main focus of your intranet, and contain links to all the
most important content on your site. It should include navigation aids that clearly
indicate how a user gets to the information he or she is seeking. At the bottom of
your home page, include a copyright statement, the date the page was last revised,
the e-mail address and phone number of the person in charge, and the physical
address of your organization. Although your home page need not include all the flash
and glitz associated with lots of Internet home pages, it could include zippy features
if that is in keeping with the culture of your organization and you have the techni-
cal expertise to add them.
• A table of contents (TOC). A simple TOC can go a long way in making it easy for
users to locate information quickly. This is similar to a book’s TOC. All the user has
to do is click a link in the TOC to go directly to that page.

424
424
424

• A technical support page. This page can include instructions on how to perform basic
intranet tasks (such as how to store new documents) and troubleshooting steps that
help users identify and solve specific problems. Some organizations use their intranet
as a help desk. Users complete and submit an online form that details technical
problems they’re experiencing.
• A press release page. At first blush, this may seem silly, but think about it. How many
times have you been the last to find out the latest, most important news about your
company?
You will, of course, want to have pages for the various departments in your organiza-
tion. A human resources page is a wise first step. Human resources staff spend count-
less hours answering routine, repetitive questions such as, Which options are available
in the health plan? A human resources page could well include the following:
• Information about health and benefit plans and enrollment forms.
• Information on employee stock purchase plans.
• A list of internal employment opportunities.
• Frequently asked questions about the company.
• The employee handbook.
• The employee telephone directory.
• Employee surveys.
• An organization chart of the company.
• The company newsletter.
• Employee classifieds.
An intranet also provides a secure point for collecting and publishing financial infor-
mation. A page for the finance and accounting department might include the follow-
ing information, with access limited in certain cases to those with a need to know:
• Reports.
• Corporate policies and procedures related to finance and accounting.
• Historical budget data, as well as projected and actual spending.
• An inventory of current assets

Both the human resources department and the accounting department might want to
set up their own internal intranets to manage information that needs to be secured even
from prying eyes within the company.

Intranets are also being widely used for training. In Chapter 14, we looked at
how to set up a PowerPoint presentation on the Web—an excellent intranet
training vehicle.
As you might expect, sales and marketing groups are using intranets effectively to boost
productivity and reduce costs. Here are some of the ways:
• The sales force can download product demonstrations and sales presentations as well
as recent sales and quota information.
• Employees, customers, and business partners can access price lists, catalogs, bro-
chures, and data sheets.
• Market information, such as competitive analysis and trends, gleaned from the
Internet is published on the sales and marketing page.
• Sales teams can collaborate.
In this section, we’ve given you only a glimpse of the possibilities. You’ll find numer-
ous case studies and how-to articles on the Internet. Use your favorites search service

To set up an intranet, you need Web server and Web browser software as well as a
program with which to create Web pages. Chapter 3 discusses the Microsoft Internet

use to create an intranet. It is part of Windows 2000 Professional, but it is not installed
by default when you install the operating system. To install IIS, follow these steps:
1. Open Control Panel.
Click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.
2. Open the Add/Remove Programs applet, as shown in Figure 16-1.
Click Add/Remove Programs.

and then click Next. When the wizard finishes installing the services, click Finish.
To take a quick look at what you just installed, open Internet Explorer, and in the Address
bar, type http://hostname where hostname is the name of your computer. If you have
not yet created a home page, you’ll see the page shown in Figure 16-3. The IIS docu-
mentation opens in a separate browser window.

When you installed Windows 2000 Professional, Setup created a default Web site and
a default FTP site. You can publish Web pages on both. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Create a Web page.
Follow the steps in Chapter 13 to create a Web page, and then save it as Default.htm
or Default.asp.
2. Copy your Web page into the Web publishing folder.
Setup created the \Inetpub\wwwroot folder in which to store your Web pages. Copy
your Web page to this folder.

Personal Web Server is a desktop Web server that you can use to create an intranet.
Windows 98 includes Personal Web Server, but before you can use it, you need to
complete some additional setup. To do this setup, you’ll need your Windows 98 CD-
ROM. Insert the CD-ROM in its drive, and then follow these steps:
1. Start the Setup program.
Click Start, and then click Run to open the Run dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-4.
In the Open box, type X:\add-ons\pws\setup.exe, and press the Enter key. (Replace X with
the letter for your CD-ROM drive.) You’ll see the opening Setup screen, as shown in
Figure 16-5. Click Next.

e’ve pointed out at least a couple of times earlier in this book the importance
of a Web site for a business, and publishing on a Web site certainly gets the lion’s
share of attention in the marketplace these days. But we think businesses should also
consider publishing an e-mail newsletter.
An e-mail newsletter is much like its paper counterpart, but it has three major advantages:
• It costs less to produce and distribute.
• It’s delivered faster.
• It can support a firm’s Web site and build traffic (since it’s easy to include hyperlinks
in the newsletter text).
In some ways, an e-mail newsletter is a more efficient way to reach your intended
audience. For example, if you put information on your Web site about new services or
new products, people will find out only when and if they visit your Web site. If you
put such information into a regularly delivered e-mail newsletter, you place that infor-
mation into the hands of people who have already said they want to receive it and in
a timely fashion.

One way to find out is to subscribe to some business newsletters for a while, see what
they are like, and see how they work. At many commercial Web sites, you’ll see a box
to check to indicate that you’d like to receive the company’s newsletter. You’ll also find
a list of business newsletters at http://www.topica.com. On the home page, which is

A lot of e-mail newsletters start out as small, perhaps in-house communications tools,
such as an employee newsletter or a newsletter that’s distributed to the sales force. Those
targeted at potential or current customers or clients can grow large quickly, and if you
are thinking about using an e-mail newsletter as a marketing tool, you will need to be
willing to invest some time and make a commitment to the project.
Some marketing experts think an e-mail newsletter is a great marketing tool in a time
when, as we discussed in Chapter 7, most of us are opting out of databases that mean
telemarketing calls at the most inappropriate hour of the day and tons of junk e-mail.
An e-mail newsletter epitomizes the concept of permission marketing. Everyone who
subscribes to your newsletter has done so on purpose and expects to read about your
ideas, products, and services. In addition, e-mail newsletters are a great way to create
brand awareness for your company, product, or service.
From the consumer’s point of view, e-mail newsletters are advantageous for a couple of
reasons:
• They get information they want without having to search for it.
• They get only the information they want, and the information is current.
An e-mail newsletter can also serve as a general forum that a community of professionals
can use to share information. We participate both as readers and writers in several
newsletters that discuss the business of writing and technology publishing, for example.

Getting Started
If all this interests you and you are on the verge of opening your word-processing program
to compose number 1 of volume 1, hang on a minute. As with all business projects, you
need to do some planning first. Here are some questions to ask and answer before you
get started:
• Who is your target audience?
• What is the specific topic of your newsletter?
• How often will you distribute it?
• Who will write it?
• Who will edit it?
• Who will respond to e-mail messages you receive as a result of your newsletter?
• Will you publish your newsletter as plain text or in HTML as a Web page?
• Will you attempt to publish it yourself or will you outsource this task?
• If you work in a corporation, have resources of time and money been allocated that
you can access for this project?
As we mentioned earlier, publishing an e-mail newsletter involves a commitment to the
project. Distributing a great first edition and then not following up with regular pub-
lications will just about totally defeat your purpose. And, speaking of purpose, define
it at the outset. To be successful, a newsletter needs to meet its audience’s expectations.
For example, if you commit to keeping your existing customer base updated on the latest
products and services with a newsletter, your rating on their confidence meter will
plummet if they see a TV commercial about the product before they get your news-
letter.
Before you distribute your first newsletter, be sure that the answers to the above ques-
tions are feasible in your organization. If you intend to write the newsletter yourself,
be sure that you really, really have the time or will make the time. In fact, put together
a written plan, distribute it to anybody who will be involved, and get their commitment
to the project.

Before we move on to look at some of the distribution methods, we need to discuss the
format in which you produce your newsletter. You have two choices: plain text or
HTML. As we mentioned in Chapter 4, all e-mail programs can read plain text, but
not all can read Web pages, which is what you create when you compose in HTML.
Without question, a newsletter composed as a Web page is the most attractive.
Figure 17-2 shows a plain-text newsletter, and Figure 17-3 shows a newsletter created
in HTML.

Which format you choose depends in part on the kind of distribution method you
choose, and we’ll look at those in the next section.
If your organization has a Web site, check with the Webmaster about placing a link
to your newsletter on the home page, as well as the means for subscribing to it. You’ll
also want to link from your newsletter to your company’s Web site.

How you go about publishing your newsletter depends primarily on the number of

process, how comfortable you are with the technology, and, of course, your budget.

Publishing with Outlook Express
The easiest, most straightforward way to publish an e-mail newsletter if you have no
more than, say, 100 subscribers is to use Microsoft Outlook Express. If you have
Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Windows ME, or Windows 98, you already
have Outlook Express on your system. You simply use Address Book to set up your dis-
tribution list, as described in Chapter 4. You will have to manually add and remove
subscribers, of course, because Outlook Express is not list-management software.
We suggest that you also set up a separate identity for sending your newsletter and for
receiving e-mail from your subscribers. For example, if we set up an identity for
Redmond Technology Press and send out the newsletter using this identity, all sub-
scribers know right away the source of the material. In addition, we’d know that all e-
mail sent to this identity concerned the newsletter. (For details about establishing and
using identities in Outlook Express, see Chapter 4.)
Using Outlook Express, you can create your newsletter in plain text or in HTML, as
discussed in Chapter 4. With some effort, you could create it in plain text for the
subscribers whose e-mail programs can’t read HTML, and then reformat it as HTML
for the others.
If you are creating a newsletter to be distributed to a group of employees, for example,
your sales force, using Outlook Express to distribute it may be ideal. All your “subscrib-
ers” will also have Outlook Express, and you can easily create an attractive piece using
the HTML formatting features.
To simplify the work of identifying e-mail newsletter recipients, you can create a dis-
tribution list. A distribution list simply lists e-mail addresses. When you tell Outlook
Express to send an e-mail message (like your newsletter) to the distribution list, Out-
look Express sends the e-mail message to all the e-mail addresses on the list.
If you want to keep the identities of your newsletter recipients secret, enter the distri-
bution list name in the Bcc box of the Outlook Express New Message window. Out-
look Express will show the e-mail addresses to you, but not to the people receiving the
message.

Another easy way to distribute an e-mail newsletter is to use a list-hosting service on
the Web. Some, such as Topica, are even free. Topica manages subscriptions, generates
statistics, and backs up your material. The catch is that your newsletter will carry
advertisements. For details on how to post your newsletter at Topica, go to http://www.
topica.com.
A popular fee-based list-hosting service is Dundee Internet Services at http://www.
dundee.net/isp/email.htm. Figure 17-4 shows this page. This service claims to have the
capacity to host anything from fewer than 25 subscribers to more than a million and
uses Lyris Email List Server software, which we’ll look at in the next section. For details
about this service provider, click the E-Mail List Services Overview link and scroll to
the bottom of the page.

If your list of subscribers grows too large to manage with a program such as Outlook
Express and you prefer not to use a list-hosting service, you can investigate installing
list-management software on your system and managing the program yourself. If you
work on a corporate network, you’ll want to discuss this with your system administra-
tor, of course. If you’re running a home office or operating a small network in your
business, we suggest that you contact a technical consultant to help you set up list-
management software.
Two well-known and popular programs are Listserv and Lyris. For information about
Listserv, go to http://www.lsoft.com, whose home page is shown in Figure 17-5. Ac-
cording to this site, Listserv is the dominant e-mail list manager in use today. For
information about Lyris, go to http://www.lyris.com. Figure 17-6 shows the Lyris home

Determining whether an e-mail newsletter is a good idea for your business and then
figuring out the best way to distribute it are both critical path items when you’re think-
ing about publishing a newsletter. But neither task is as important as the editorial process
and the content of your newsletter. As we were exploring Web directories of business
newsletters, we came across the following blurb:
“Tightly written and edited. A 3-minute read each week.”

In our opinion, this tag line describes the perfect business newsletter—no words are
wasted in the writing; the newsletter has been edited for spelling, grammar, punctua-
tion, word choice, organization, and format; and you can glean its valuable informa-
tion in about the same amount of time it takes to read the column on the business page
of your daily newspaper. In our collective experience as writers, editors, managers, and
publishers, the best advice we can give you is to establish an editorial process that
complies with publishing standards and stick to it.

The first step in the editorial process is to determine the focus of your newsletter and
then give it a title. If you’re creating a newsletter for your sales force, your audience
determines the focus and the content. If you’re creating a newsletter for your employ-
ees, the audience still determines the focus though it broadens. The title of your news-
letter should be appropriate for its audience, which may well be influenced by the
corporate culture. In any case, the title should be descriptive of the content.

The next step is to think about content, not just for the first publication but perhaps
for the quarter or even the year, especially if you expect to publish monthly. We sug-
gest creating an outline with the major points being the focus for each publication and
the minor points being the two or three headings in each issue. Yes, what Ms Cooper
made you do before you began writing a term paper still applies. All good publications
start with an outline.
Here’s the beginning of an outline for a newsletter to the sales force that will be pub-
lished monthly. Roman numerals identify the major subject matter for each issue, and
the capital letters identify the sections for the issue.

And so on. As you can see, continuity is established by running some sections in ev-

Obviously, if a major corporate event occurs, such as a reorganization or the purchase
of a subsidiary, for example, you can adjust your outline and cover that topic instead.
But creating and maintaining an outline gives you the following advantages:
• Your newsletter is focused and flows logically.
• Because you know ahead of time, you can begin to gather any needed information
well in advance.
• You avoid last-minute sleepless nights wondering what you’re going to put in the
newsletter tomorrow.
• You can ensure that in the course of the newsletter’s regular publication schedule that
you’re covering all the pertinent information.

If you’ve created your outline in a word processor or a text editor, you can simply open
it and get started. All the rules for writing well apply, and in this section we’ll review
some of them.
Use active voice. Why? Because it’s more direct and alive. Passive voice is used by those
who don’t want to take responsibility for what they’re writing, and, indeed, the first part
of this sentence is in passive voice. Here’s another example: The selection of the new
CFO was made public. This sentence raises some questions: Who did the selecting?
Who made it public and how? A more alive and more informative sentence: The board
of directors selected the new CFO and then announced their choice during this
morning’s news conference.
The paragraph is the basic unit of composition. It begins with a topic sentence and then
proceeds to elaborate on that. Especially, when you’re writing for the computer screen,
keep paragraphs short, and format chunks of text that are manageable when the reader
is scrolling through your newsletter.
Don’t use complicated words when simple ones will do nicely. Example: The widget has fallen
into desuetude. Desuetude is a perfectly good word, and you’ll find it in the Merriam
Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, but chances are just about zero that your readers are going
to know that it means “disuse.”
Use only as many words as necessary. A particularly annoying example is the use of the
phrase “the fact of the matter is.” You never need to include this phrase; the “fact” stands
on its own and is the reason you are writing the sentence in the first place. Choose words
that are specific to your subject matter and that will attract your audience. If you are
writing about a technical topic for a nontechnical audience, always explain a technical
term in context.
Never begin a sentence with “There is”  or “There are” if you can find a noun or a pronoun and
a strong verb to do the job. For example, which is the stronger sentence: “There are a
number of people who agree with you” or “A number of people agree with you”?

These are only some of the handy devices you can use to maintain the dynamic nature
of your e-mail newsletter. They aren’t difficult to remember, and using them will make
you a better communicator of the written word. You’ll find variations on them as well
as many more in a tiny book that has become a classic since it was first published in
1935—The Elements of Style, by William Strunk, Jr., and E.B. White. The most recent
edition was published in 1995 and is available at bookstores on- and offline. The 85
pages that compose this book constitute what should be the daily companion of any-
one who writes.

Everybody needs an editor, and the more you write and the longer you write, the more
you will find this to be a necessity. You can, and should, spell-check your document,
and if the program in which you are creating your newsletter has one, run its grammar
checker. Neither, however, take the place of an editor.
For example, if you type for when you mean four, the spell checker won’t see it as a mistake.
And if you begin three sentences in a row with “There are,” a grammar checker might
or might not call your attention to this. You might also want to give your newsletter
a read-through before passing it on to an editor.
Here are the editor’s tasks:
• Correcting spelling.
• Correcting grammatical mistakes.
• Fixing punctuation.
• Querying you if he or she can’t understand a sentence or a paragraph.
• Pointing out any statement that could be factually incorrect.
• Tightening your words and making suggestions about better word choices.
• Suggesting something that you might want to include.
• Noting any useless repetition.
• Applying any house style rules if your organization has a style guide.

If you can’t find a person in your organization with these skills, you can obtain the
services of a professional. Many editors work on a freelance, per hour or per assignment
basis, and you can find them through an editorial agency or even on the Internet, using
the tips in Chapter 19.
The most efficient way to work with an editor is to work online. Whether someone
within your organization will do the editing or you contract for the services of a
freelancer, you can send your newsletter file to the editor as an attachment to e-mail.
He or she can then open it in a program such as Microsoft Word and turn on the Track
Changes feature, which keeps your original but displays all the editorial changes and
queries in a different color and indicates insertions and deletions. When you get the
file back, it’s easy to see who did what when. You can then accept or reject the changes,
finalize your document, and distribute it.

Whether you distribute your newsletter as a plain-text file or as a Web page, you need
to ensure that what your subscribers see on the screen is readable and attractive. Here
are some suggestions for formatting a good-looking plain-text newsletter:
• Visibly separate the sections using characters, symbols, or blank lines.
• Use a monospaced font so that readers with older e-mail programs can read your
newsletter easily.
• Set off URLs by enclosing them in angle brackets (< >) and include a link to the home
page of your Web site if you have one.
Here are some tips for formatting a newsletter in HTML:
• Don’t add animation and sound to the page, which will detract from your message
rather than enhancing it.
• Use colors and different fonts sparingly, and don’t use a black background against
which text must contrast. Light text on a dark screen background is very difficult
to read, and a bunch of different-colored objects detract from the content.
• Separate sections by placing the heading in a larger size font and perhaps in bold-
face. Keep all body text in the same size and type of font.
• Keep your newsletter all on one page, and include a link to the home page of your
Web site, if you have one.

Creating a Publishing Schedule
Whether you decide to publish weekly, monthly, or quarterly or on some other schedule,
establish the publication date—the day and the time of day that your newsletter is sent
out to subscribers—and work backward to determine how much time you need to allot
to each stage of the process. After you do the first couple of issues, you’ll be able to
reasonably estimate how long the writing takes. In general, build in a day for the ed-
iting, and build in a day for the final formatting. Neither task will take that long, but
you need to allow for the unexpected.
If you are using Outlook Express or a similar program to distribute your newsletter,
allow some time in your personal schedule for the manual adding and deleting of
subscribers, or assign that task to someone who can handle this task for you. If you’re
creating a newsletter that will be distributed internally to only a finite number of
employees, this will not be a Herculean task. But if your list grows, managing subscribers
manually can become a time sink that you want to be prepared for.

In this chapter, we’ve looked at a rather simple way to stay in touch with departmen-
tal employees, customers, potential customers, and professional colleagues—an e-mail
newsletter. You can use it to enhance the effectiveness of your Web site, and you can
use your Web site to publicize your newsletter. This chapter gives you the information
you need to get started and includes some nontechnical guidelines that you can use to
publish a newsletter that not only contains valuable information for your subscribers
but also sends a professional, attractive message about you and your business.

f you’re looking for employees in the traditional way, that is, by posting job
openings in newspapers, in trade magazines, in print newsletters, and so on, these days
you’re going to still be searching long after the best candidates are working away in their
new positions. And if you’re looking for a job by searching through the weekend
classifieds of your local newspaper, the position you want may well be filled before you’ve
even had time to fax your résumé. The reason: the world of online recruiting and job
searching has exploded.
In mid-2000, America’s Job Bank, which is a partnership between the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor and the state-operated public Employment Service, had more than
2 million registered job seekers and some 1.5 million job postings on their site at
http://www.ajb.dni.us. And America’s Job Bank is only one of hundreds of online
recruiting sites. One survey estimates that about 98 percent of all U.S. companies are
currently recruiting online.
In this chapter, we can’t begin to cover all the many facets of online recruiting and job
searching, but we can give you some tips and point you toward a wealth of resources.

Recruiting on the Internet
Why recruit on the Internet? Because it’s cost-effective, it’s fast, and it’s far-reaching.
• Placing a large ad in a major metropolitan newspaper can cost thousands of dollars;
posting a job opening at CareerSite.com Recruiter (http://www.careersite.com) is free
for small- to medium-size businesses. Even the sites that charge employers a fee are
usually more cost-effective than advertising in print media. But the trade-off is
probably time, which is also money. You will need to check e-mail messages, review
résumés (maybe many more than previously), create job postings, manage job postings
(for example, removing them when they are filled), and so on.
• When you post a job on the Internet, it can be viewed in a matter of seconds, and
you could begin receiving responses in a matter of minutes.
• Print media circulation is minimal when compared with the millions and millions
of Internet users worldwide.

Your first step is to create an electronic job posting. The format and the method for
submitting a job posting depend on the site, and you’ll typically find instructions by
clicking Help or perhaps a Post A Job link. Regardless of how you post a job or even
where, the most important aspect is the posting’s content. According to professionals
in the human resources field, a good electronic job posting will contain most, if not all,
of the following information.
Keywords and category. As you can see in Figure 18-1, at Monster.com (http://
monster.com) a job seeker can search by location, job category, and keyword. The site’s
search engine can pick up the location from your contact information, but you’ll need
to specify the job category and the keywords. The job category you specify should be
one of those in the site’s list of categories. Keywords are important because these are the
terms that a potential employee is most likely to enter when searching through job
postings. Keywords are typically a subset of terms that are usually used to describe the
job in a certain category. For example, if you are posting a job for a benefits adminis-
trator in your human resources department, you might enter Excel, 401(k), ERISA laws,
COBRA, and so on. If you’re recruiting a computer programmer, you might enter the
specific languages needed in the position.

Job title. This entry seems obvious, but it can be tricky. If you make the title too gen-
eral, your posting will never find its way into the proper hands; if you make it too
specific and technical, the position may sound too specialized even to appropriate
candidates. Some companies use job titles that are well understood within that orga-
nization but are not commonly understood even within that particular industry. For
example, one of us once had the title of Deputy Editor for a reference publication. This
particular job title is not common today within the publishing community, and were
we to post an opening for it on a Web site, we’d probably change it to something such
as Supervising Editor or Managing Editor.

with the official title of Assistant Accountant when it should have been
Accounting Assistant. Issues arising from this mistake haunted the de-
partment for the duration of the employee’s tenure.

Salary. Whether to include a salary range in a job posting is an issue that has been
the subject of heated debate among human resources professionals for a long time,
and the debate continues when it comes to electronic job postings. One recent study
of recruiting Web sites, however, indicated that including the pay rate or range re-
sulted in a higher response rate—sometimes as much as three times the rate for a
similar posting that did not include salary information. Some companies don’t post
salary information because their pay rates are not competitive. If you’re not sure about
your rates and want to compare them with national rates or with rates in your geo-
graphical area, your industry, or with organizations of comparable size, go to Wageweb
(http://www.wageweb.com). Wageweb is an online salary service that provides data
on some 170 positions. You can view national rates for free, but a fee is charged for
the other most specialized figures. Figure 18-2 shows the Wageweb home page.

Company profile. This is a one- or two-paragraph section that explains who your com-
pany is, what you do, and where you are located. Although job searchers can hunt down
information about your business on the Internet, as we discussed in Chapter 8, including
a company profile in your job posting saves them time and keeps at bay those résumés
of people who have no interest in your mission. Some job postings store this informa-
tion so that it can be retrieved by clicking a link that’s something like Learn More About
XYZ Corporation.
Job description. The job description should be as specific as possible and should reflect
the expectations of the current manager or supervisor for the position. Here are some
items to consider including:
• Whether the position is part-time, full-time, contract, in-house, seasonal, and so on.
• The working hours.
• Whether travel is required.
• Duties and responsibilities.
• Specific skills required, such as particular software programs, knowledge of multiple
languages, and the like.
• Reporting structure.
• Management responsibilities, if any.
JobDescription.com is a site that, for a fee, will help you write job descriptions.
Figure 18-3 shows part of a sample job description at this site. For others, go to

Qualifications. In this section, list requirements such as education level and years of
experience. Be sure that you are in compliance with the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission (EEOC).
Location. Be sure to specify where the work will be performed. If you are recruiting from
a corporate office but the person will be working overseas or at a branch office, poten-
tial candidates should know this before they apply for the job.
Benefits. In a competitive job market, this may be the most attractive feature of your
employment opportunity, and you want to publicize it. Include provisions such as
401(k) packages, childcare programs, healthcare options, stock options, diversity efforts,
and the like.
Contact information. Throw in everything and the kitchen sink if you want to reach the
widest range of potential employees—e-mail address, physical address, Web site URL,
fax number, and phone number. Some companies also include specific instructions about
how to submit a résumé. An excellent example is the Boeing Company in Seattle,
Washington. We found the following instructions at the bottom of a recent job posting:

• Boeing uses an electronic résumé handling system that requires résumés to be sub-
mitted in plain text format (without lines, bullets, formatting, or special characters).
• To submit your résumé by e-mail, send it to submit.resume@pss.boeing.com. In-
clude the requisition number listed in this job posting in your résumé, and send your
résumé in the body of the e-mail message, not as an attachment.
• To use our online résumé builder, go to our Online Resume builder at http://
www.boeing.com/employment/resume.html.
• To submit your résumé by mail, send it to [name and address of the company].
Include the requisition number and follow the format instructions to maximize the
scanability of your résumé.
In the last half of this chapter, we’ll look in more detail at the implications of some of
these instructions. The point here is that Boeing is providing a tremendous amount of
help to those who want to respond to this job posting. If you want to get the maximum
results out of your online job postings, you’ll do the same, regardless of whether you
currently have access to an online résumé builder. Always include precise submission
instructions.

As we mentioned earlier in this section, the precise way that you submit an elec-
tronic job posting depends on the site. At Monster.com, you complete an online
form. In mid-2000, the fee for each posting was $275, which maintained the
posting for 60 days.
Here are the steps for completing the form:
1. Select a category and a location from the drop-down lists.
2. Select an option button that corresponds to the job level: Internship, Entry Level,
Mid Career, Executive.
3. Enter the job title (a maximum of 40 characters).
4. Enter the job description and contact information.
5. Select a position type: Full Time, Part Time, Permanent, Contract.
6. Enter salary information.

Now, you have a couple of choices. You can sit back and wait for résumés to amass in
your inbox, or you can proactively search out résumés. At Monster.com, for example,
you can purchase access to the database of some 3.9 million résumés and search by
keyword, job function, industry, geographic location, date of posting, and so on.
CareerShop.com, shown in Figure 18-4, is another recruiting site that provides ways
to broaden your search for employees.

• You can post as many job listings as you want.
• Your job listings are cross-posted to some 100 job boards and newsgroups, includ-
ing America’s Job Bank, Career Monthly, CareerPlacer.com, Excite, and Yahoo!.
• You can search a database of more than 350,000 résumés and save your search criteria.
• Search agents match your job postings to the database of résumés, and only the best
matches are sent to you throughout the week via e-mail.
Typically, you pay a fee to post a job at an online recruiting site, and job seekers can
post their résumés for free. Resume.com works in reverse—for free, you receive résumés
daily that have been filtered by discipline and geographic location. You can then con-
tact the job seeker directly by e-mail. For details, go to http://www.resumeblaster.com;
the recruiter page is shown in Figure 18-5.

If your company has a Web site, include a page that advertises job opportunities and
put a link to it on the home page. Cisco Systems, the giant corporation that produces
networking products, has used this idea to great advantage. In a recent year, Cisco
received 81 percent of its résumés and hired 66 percent of its employees via the Internet.
Cisco’s home page includes a HotJobs@Cisco link that takes you to the Cisco Employ-
ment Opportunities page, which is shown in Figure 18-6. You can search the job
openings by keywords, an area of interest, and location. You can then click a job title
to display a description and contact information.

If you are just starting a job search, the Internet should be the first place you turn to,
not the last. Why? In most cases, it’s free, and it’s fast and far-reaching. If you read the
first part of this chapter, you’ll remember that those are similar to the reasons that
employers are now recruiting on the Internet in record numbers.

Preparing Your Electronic Résumé

our Electronic Résumé
The first step is to prepare your electronic résumé. If you haven’t been out in the job
market for a while, you can use an old résumé to jog your memory about past employ-
ment details, but preparing an electronic résumé involves a great deal more than sim-
ply dusting off and adding to that old tried-and-true version. The reasons are twofold:
• Employers are using résumé-tracking software that lets them scan paper résumés or
add résumé files to a database that can be searched by keywords and all sorts of other
criteria.
• Recruiters search online databases of résumés in the same way.
Thus, the content of an electronic résumé is different as well as the format.

Opinions vary among human resources professionals about the elements that an elec-

form that you fill out. Figure 18-7 shows a portion of the form at Monster.com. To
add your résumé to the giant database at this site, you must complete this form.

Figure 18-7
The résumé form at Monster.com (http://my.monster.com/title.asp).
An electronic résumé typically has most, if not all, of the following elements.
Job title. The first line should contain words that describe the type of position you are
seeking. When employers search résumé databases, this line is the first thing they see.
You need to use it to attract attention to your résumé. Some typical examples include
Advertising Account Representative, Senior Technical Writer, MBA Tax Accountant,
Software Engineer, Purchasing Agent, Marketing Manager, and Controller. All these
job titles, by the way, are also good keywords.
Contact information. Unless a résumé database site requires otherwise, place your con-
tact information immediately following the job title. Include your name, physical
address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail address. If you have a professional Web
site, include the URL.

seeking. Include as many keywords as you can. (We’ll discuss keywords in more detail
later in this section.)
Summary or keyword paragraph. This paragraph summarizes your skills and, like the
objective, needs to contain as many keywords as possible. Professional opinions vary as
to whether you should include both an objective and a summary, and some even ad-
vise including your objective in the summary paragraph. Regardless of which you do,
this information needs to be close to the top. Some résumé-tracking systems record the
first 100 words in a résumé, so you want those 100 words to describe your qualifica-
tions and your skills that are relevant to the position you are seeking.
Experience. Opinions also vary about the best way to organize this section of your résumé.
Should it be in chronological order or by function? Or should it be a blend? If you’ve
been in the same field most of your working life, a good choice is reverse chronological
order; in other words, list your most recent positions first. If, on the other hand, you’ve
worked in more than one field, you might want to group positions. For each position
you list, include the job title, the place of employment, and a description of your duties
and responsibilities. Whether you include your dates of employment depends on your
circumstances, but most employers will want this information.

ord About Keywords
Résumé keywords are nouns and noun phrases that are key to your industry, field,
job title, and skills. Sprinkle them liberally, although not repetitively, throughout
your résumé. Here are some example keywords for a few industries:
• Aerospace: aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, structures, materials, orbital mechanics.
• Architecture: industrial design, construction management, environmental sys-
tems, air conditioning and refrigeration.

• Chemical engineering: process analysis and control, polymer engineering, elec-
tronic materials, biomedical, biotechnology.
Here are some keywords that highlight skills and responsibilities:
• Systems analysis
• Rapid application development
• Market research
• Strategic planning
• New product launch
• Costing
• Variance reporting
In addition, any acronyms and abbreviations that are in general use in your industry
are excellent keywords as are degrees or certifications.
If you’re unsure about the keywords to include in your résumé, here are some ways
to become better informed:
• Get a printed copy of help-wanted ads and highlight the important words in jobs
that you would apply for.
• Go to the many online recruiting sites and identify keywords in job descriptions.
• Look for keywords in online and print magazines for your profession.
A word to the wise: be sure that the keywords you use are an accurate description
of your experience and skills. MBA may be a great keyword, but if you don’t have
one, don’t use it.

Formatting Your Electronic Résumé
our Electronic Résumé

our Electronic Résumé
You will find that many online job database sites and many job descriptions that are
posted by employers include specific instructions for formatting your electronic résumé.
(If you’re reading this section of this chapter first, check back in the “Posting a Job
Opening” section for the steps that Boeing includes for submitting an electronic
résumé.)
Some online résumé databases give you the choice of submitting your résumé as plain
text or as a Web page (in HTML). We suggest that you create and save your résumé
as straight text and then save another version that is converted to HTML. In many
word-processing programs, such as Microsoft Word, doing so is easy.
A plain text résumé is different from a résumé that has been formatted in a word-
processing program and saved in that program’s format. A plain-text résumé is an
ASCII file. It looks much as if it were typed on a typewriter and contains no tabs, no
italics, no boldface, no special paragraph indentions, and so on. Why do you need to
create such a plain-looking document when you have so many tools and so many ways
to pretty it up these days? Because virtually every software program ever created can
read an ASCII file. Remember your electronic résumé might be stored by any num-
ber of different résumé-tracking programs and online databases. You don’t want to
submit a beautifully formatted file that some of them can’t read.
To create a plain-text electronic résumé, use the steps that follow. We’re using Microsoft
Word 2000 and Windows 2000 Professional, but you can follow the same general
procedure in most of today’s word-processing programs.
1. Open Word.
Click Start, click Programs, and then click Microsoft Word.
2. Start a new document.
Click the File menu, and then click New to open the New dialog box, as shown in
Figure 18-8. Click Blank Document, and then click OK.

3. Save your document as a Text Only file.
Click the File menu, and then click Save As to open the Save As dialog box, as shown
in Figure 18-9. Choose a folder in which to save your file, and in the File Name drop-
down list, select Text Only. Click Save. When asked if you’re sure you want to save
the file in this format, click Yes.
Figure 18-9
The Save As dialog box.
4. Select a monospaced font for your résumé.
In a monospaced font, each letter and each space takes up the same amount of space,
as it would on an old standard typewriter. Click the Format menu, and then click
Font to open the Font dialog box, as shown in Figure 18-10. In the Font list, select
Courier New. In the Size list, click 12, and then click OK.

If you ever need to submit a printed résumé that will need to be scanned, you
can simply print out this file you are creating. Courier 12-point text can be
easily and accurately scanned. For the best scanning results, be sure your
printer cartridge or toner is at full strength, and print on good, plain white
paper.
Now you’re ready to start typing your résumé. Follow these guidelines:
• Set your margins at zero and 65.
• Begin each paragraph flush left. Don’t use centering or flush-right formatting
features.
• Don’t use tabs. They’ll be lost when your résumé is viewed onscreen.
• Use all capital letters to emphasize your name and major headings such as Objec-
tive, Summary, and Experience.
• When you finish, spell-check your document, and then ask another person to read
it over. Remember, spell-checkers don’t pick up errors such as two for to or too.
• Verify that all information is correct, especially dates. It’s easy to make a typo when
entering dates.
When you’re satisfied with the appearance and content of your résumé, save it again.

Now, to see how your résumé looks when it arrives in the body of an e-mail message,
send it to yourself. If you’re using Word 2000, click the File menu, click Send To, and
then click Mail Recipient. Your résumé will open in the body of the New Message
window in Outlook Express. Enter your e-mail address, and click Send.

1. Failing to correct a typo in your résumé. Those who distribute résumés—elec-

2. Omitting an objective or a summary in your résumé.
3. Lying about either your skills or your experience.
4. Using too many complex words. Write as if you were addressing a class of sixth
graders.
5. E-mailing a résumé that arrives garbled because the employer’s program can’t read
formatted text or a Web page.
6. Emphasizing your duties rather than your accomplishments.
7. Including salary requirements in your résumé. Don’t do this even if an ad or a
job description says it’s mandatory. Employers need employees these days, and
they look at all the résumés they receive. You’re much more likely to be ruled out
when you include salary requirements than when you don’t.

Where you post your résumé is up to you. You can start by taking a look at all the
recruiting Web sites we mentioned in the first part of this chapter. Naturally, you can
post your résumé at any of these sites. Most are free, but some are fee-based. As is the
case with many employment agencies or headhunters, employers pay to list their job
openings, but job candidates do not.
How you post your résumé depends on the requirements at the site. As we mentioned
earlier, Monster.com requires that you fill out an online form, which becomes your
résumé. At other sites, you can submit a straight-text résumé, which we described in
the previous section. Follow the instructions at the site.

In the not-too-distant past, a cover letter was considered essential to the résumé-sub-
mission process. They were assumed to be a way of personalizing a query about a specific
position, and job seekers spent many hours composing and formatting them. Little did
they know that managers such as ourselves, facing a stack of hundreds of résumés, flipped
straight past almost all cover letters and scanned the résumé for essential skills and
experience. Later, we might glance at a cover letter attached to the résumé if we were
considering an interview, but if all the contact information was included in the résumé,
as it should be, we might well never look at the cover letter. All that work on a job seeker’s
part for nothing.
Well, both job seekers and employers have faced this reality, and today a cover letter is
no longer considered essential. In fact, when you post your résumé to a job database,
you usually can’t include a cover letter, and if you do, it is discarded. Most employers
do the same. Any information about you that you want an employer to notice must be
in your résumé.
If you feel that you absolutely must include a cover letter when you submit a résumé
via e-mail, place your comments first in the body of the message, and then copy and
paste your résumé. Keep your cover letter contents brief, remembering that the reader
will already most likely be checking the job title that begins your résumé.

How you search for jobs on the Internet depends on how the individual site is struc-
tured. At some sites, you must first register even if you can search for free. In this section,
we’ll look at how to search for a job at America’s Job Bank. At this site, you can post
your résumé for free, and you can search the jobs database for free and without regis-
tering. You can search by occupation, keyword, military code, and job number. To do
so, follow these steps:
1. Open the America’s Job Bank site.
Go to http://www.ajb.dni.us/seeker. Figure 18-11 shows this site’s home page.

This chapter has focused on what we consider one of the most exciting and potentially
life-changing aspects of the Internet—recruiting and job searching. Processes that in
the past took weeks and months of precious time can now be reduced to minutes. If
you are an employer who has not yet investigated Internet recruiting, you need to get
on the bandwagon. Your competitors are already scooping up valuable employees be-
cause they use the Internet to get to them first. If you’re unemployed, your job is to
find a job, and the way to do that the quickest and in the most efficient manner is to
use the Internet. A job seeker who did use the Internet may already have the job of your
dreams.

ersonal financial programs like Intuit Quicken and Microsoft Money and even
small business accounting programs like Intuit QuickBooks let you simplify your
financial affairs and record-keeping by using online bill payment and banking services.
Because these services are becoming more widespread every year and more useful all the
time, it’s worthwhile to discuss online banking in general, describe the specifics of using
online banking, and review some of the practical problems the services suffer from. All
of this information is provided in this chapter.

Understanding Online Banking
When people talk in general about online banking, they actually refer to several banking
activities, including online bill payment, online account transfers, and online statements.
Each of these activities warrants a brief description. In addition, it makes sense to briefly
discuss the prerequisites for using online banking.
Online Bill Payment
Online Bill Payment

Online Bill Payment
Online bill payment refers to the automatic payment via the Internet for items you
record in your accounting system. In the case where you’re recording payments using
Quicken, for example, online bill payment means a payment you’ve entered in a
Quicken register is automatically paid.
In essence, when you use online bill payment, you tell the online payment service’s
computer to use the information you’ve recorded about a particular payment for making
the actual disbursement.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
The cost for online bill payment service varies, depending on the bank. Cur-
rently, our banks charge $5.95 a month for both online bill payment and
online banking for a personal account. The same banks charge $9.95 a
month for both online bill payment and online banking for a business account.
Does the price of the service seem expensive? If you consider how much it costs
to mail a payment ($.33), it’s not so bad. And the check form you use to pay
a bill may not be cheap. For business checks and computer checks, you can
easily pay a dime per form. Using online bill payment can actually save you
money.
One specialized form of online bill payment is online payroll. With online payroll
services like that provided through the QuickBooks online payroll service, the online
payment service uses payroll information to make electronic funds deposits, automatically
make payroll deposits, and file quarterly and annual federal and state payroll tax returns.
We have used QuickBooks online payroll service and found the service to be more
unwieldy than a payroll service bureau like ADP or PayChex (perhaps because there’s
not an expert you can ask for help whenever you need it) but more flexible (since you
can do payroll whenever you want) and less expensive.

Online payroll services appear to run about half the cost of equivalent out-
side payroll service bureaus like ADP or PayChex. However, do recognize that
with an online payroll service you will probably prepare and print the payroll
checks, which means you will go to slightly more work if you choose the online
payroll option.

With online account transfers, you can use your account program to move money
between accounts. You can, for example, move money from a checking account to a
money market account. You can sometimes move money from bank accounts to liability
accounts (like a credit card account or a loan account) if the accounts are all at the same
bank.
As with online bill payment, with online account transfers, you essentially tell the bank’s
computer to use the information you’ve recorded about a particular transfer to make
the transfer.
Online Bank Statements

Online Bank Statements
A third banking activity that’s part of online banking is the automatic retrieval of an
electronic, or online, bank statement. This may be the most useful feature of online
banking. By working with online bank statements, you can grab bank statements at any
time and as often as you like. This means, of course, that you can reconcile bank accounts
whenever and as often as you like. You can also easily determine when checks or deposits
have cleared a bank whenever you want.
Typically, online bank statements greatly simplify the work of reconciling an account.
With Intuit’s Quicken and QuickBooks products and with Microsoft Money, for
example, the program will actually make many of the comparisons between your records
and the bank’s records. This is easy, of course, because it’s easy for the accounting pro-
gram to compare your electronic records with the recently retrieved electronic bank
statement.
Prerequisites for Using Online Banking

To use online bill payment, you need a connection to the Internet and a client (like
Quicken, QuickBooks, or Microsoft Money) that will send payment and banking
instructions to your bank. If you want to use online banking, you also need a bank that
supports online banking functions.

Currently, about 75 banks and credit unions support online banking, and this
number is constantly increasing. In an effort to increase the number of banks
offering this service, Intuit, Microsoft, and CheckFree (another online bill
payment service) have created an alliance, called the Open Financial Exchange.
The objectives of this alliance are to make online exchange of financial infor-
mation easier and to encourage greater numbers of financial institutions to
participate in online banking.
If you want to use only online bill payment, you can use any bank. You will, however,
need to sign up with an online bill payment service such as Intuit’s. (When you sign
up with an online bill payment service, you give the service permission to write checks
and make electronic disbursements from your existing bank account.)

Caveats About Online Bill Payment
Although the businesses charging you fees for online financial services and the soft-
ware companies selling you online financial software don’t mention it, practical
problems with online banking do exist.
Online bill payment services require you to be more organized in your bill paying.
You need to transmit electronic payment information to the online bill payment
service a few days early so that the service has time to process your payment. If you’re
always juggling those last few bills or closely watching your cash flow, this might
not work. In the case of an individual using online banking, for example, you lose
the option of paying the mortgage with a handwritten check on the last day and
personally running the check down to the bank.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE      If your Internet connection isn’t dependable—and sometimes ours
          aren’t—you also need to factor this into your bill-paying and banking
           schedule.
Another potential drawback is that some merchants don’t like to deal with electronic
payments. Reportedly, some banks with their own online bill payment services have
balked at accepting electronic bill payments through Intuit or another financial in-
stitution. To be candid, we have had trouble paying some bills electronically, which
is understandable. Electronic payments can be a little confusing to merchants. The
checks don’t look exactly like regular checks. (They aren’t signed, for example.) And
there’s no way to include a remittance advice or payment coupon, which can be
especially problematic if you’re sending money to a lockbox.

Signing Up for Online Banking Services
For Intuit’s Quicken and QuickBooks products and for Microsoft Money, you sign up
for an online bill-payment service by filling out the online services agreement that comes
in the software package or by filling out forms that are available through your bank. You
may need to include a voided check with your sign-up paperwork. Other programs’ online
bill-payment services work in a similar way.
A few days after you mail in your signed service agreement, you will get a welcome letter
from either your bank or Intuit Services Corporation. The letter provides the information
you need to set up your accounting program (Quicken, QuickBooks, Microsoft Money,
or another program) for the online bill payment service.
When you set up a bank account in your accounting program, you are prompted to enter
information that the accounting program uses to connect to the online banking service
and to uniquely identify the bank and the account. In Quicken, for example, when you
go to the register for the first time, you see several links at the top of the register to assist
you with banking online. Click the Enroll With Your Bank Or Banker hyperlink to learn
about the services that your bank offers and apply for the services.

If you’re comfortable working with your accounting program, you’ll have no trouble
with online bill payment. Once you’ve told the accounting program that you want to
use the online bill payment feature with a particular account, the only extra tasks you
need to complete are building a list of electronic payees (the merchants, banks, and
individuals that the online bill payment service pays) and learning to electronically
transmit payment instructions to the online bill payment service center.

To pay a bill with online payment, you record the payment in the usual way but identify
it as an online payment. In Quicken, you identify the payment as an online payment
by clicking the Banking menu and then clicking Online Banking. When Quicken
displays the Online Center, click the Payments tab, if necessary. Figure 19-4 shows this
tab.

The Payments tab of the Online Center is very similar to the Quicken check
form, with a few important differences: there is an Account drop-down list
box for selecting the account that you’re using, and the Pay To The Order Of
line is labeled Payee.
You enter an electronic payment in almost the same way that you enter a regular check,
with two differences: you must select which bank account you’re using for the payment,
and when you get to the Payee line, you must specify an electronic payee.

You can specify an electronic payee by entering a name in the Payee box. As you type,
if the payee is on your Online Payee List, Quicken will attempt to automatically fill
in the rest of the name. If the name is not on your list, when you click Enter, Quicken
opens the Set Up Online Payee dialog box (see Figure 19-3) so that you can supply
the information necessary to make an electronic payment. As you can see, you fill in
an electronic payment form in the same way that you complete a check that you want
to print.
After you have filled out the form, click Enter. Quicken adds your payment to the list
and displays its current status in the text box at the bottom of the window. Note that
Quicken has not sent the payment to your bank yet. It is stored on your computer until
you send your transactions to the bank by clicking Update/Send, as explained in the
next section.

Before you start using online payment to pay your bills, experiment with the
feature by sending yourself an electronic payment for some nominal amount,
such as $1.00. You’ll learn how long the online bill payment service takes to
get payments to the payee, and you’ll understand how the service uses the
electronic payee information you provide.

Once you’ve described all of your electronic payments, making the actual payments is
a snap. All you do is connect to the online bill payment service’s computer or the bank’s
computer and transmit your payment instructions.
In Quicken, you would do this by displaying the Online Center (click the Banking
menu and click Online Banking) and then clicking the Update/Send button at the top
right of the window. Quicken connects to the Internet; as it does so, you will see a series
of message boxes.
Through the Internet, Quicken connects to the online bill payment service computer
and opens the Instructions To Send dialog box, as shown in Figure 19-5. This dialog
box shows a list of the online bill payments you have recorded up to that point, along
with any other online transactions waiting to be sent.

The Instructions To Send dialog box.
If you see an electronic payment in the Instructions To Send dialog box that you don’t
want to transmit—or at least not yet—click it. This unmarks the electronic payment
so Quicken won’t send it. When you want Quicken to send an unmarked electronic
payment, click that payment to mark it again.
If this is the first time you’re using online bill payment, the dialog box will look some-
thing like the one shown in Figure 19-5, though it might vary depending on your bank.
Click Send. Quicken asks you for your existing personal identification number (PIN)
and prompts you to change it to a new PIN for your online bill payment account.
(Usually, on your first call-in, you use your ATM card PIN.) If this isn’t your first time
using online bill payment, the dialog box shown in Figure 19-5 has an extra text box
for your PIN. Just type your PIN in the Enter Your PIN box, and then click Send.
Quicken sends your payment instructions. After the transmission is complete, Quicken
opens the Online Transmission Summary dialog box.

Online bill payment uses a PIN as a way to keep your account information private.
When you instruct the online bill payment service computer to actually process
payments, Quicken supplies your account number and you supply your PIN. The
online bill payment service computer then verifies the numbers you and Quicken
provided and lets you transmit payment instructions. While this process may sound
dangerous—after all, someone only needs to know your account number and PIN
to start tapping your account—this security system is the same one you now use
with your automated teller machine (ATM) card.

As an extra measure of security, some of the banks that provide online bill payment
services require you to change your PIN every time you transmit payment infor-
mation. This little gambit means that even if someone discovered the PIN that you
were using last week, it wouldn’t be any help this week. What’s more, if a miscre-
ant did access your online bill payment account, he or she would need to change
your PIN. In that case, the next time you tried to send payments, you would find
that someone had accessed your account and changed your PIN. The bottom line
is that PINs work very well as long as you keep the number a secret and don’t forget
it.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE

NOTE In Quicken, if you have online accounts with more than one bank, you can
use a PIN Vault feature to store your account PINs in one place and enter
a single password to connect to all the banks. To set up the PIN Vault, click
the File menu, click PIN Vault, and then click Setup. Click Next to start the
Setup Wizard. For each bank with which you have online services set up,
select the bank from the drop-down list and enter the PIN in the two text
boxes provided. Then enter and confirm the password you want to use for
all your accounts. Review the summary the wizard provides, and click Done.
The next time you use online services, you’ll need to enter only the single
password you specified.

You most likely pay some bills regularly, such as on a monthly basis. For example,
mortgage, rent, car loan, and medical insurance payments are made regularly. To make
it easier to pay repeating transactions, accounting programs like Quicken typically let
you schedule an online payment transaction so that it is paid automatically until you
tell the online payment service to stop paying it. For example, if you’re supposed to pay,
say, a $1,000-per-month mortgage payment by the tenth of every month and you have
30 years of these monthly payments, you can tell your accounting program to send in
your $1,000 every month by the tenth of the month.
To create a repeating transaction in Quicken, follow these steps:
1. Open the Online Center to the Payments tab.

clicking it, and then click the Delete button. When Quicken asks you to confirm the
deletion, click Yes.
If the status message says Sent, click the transaction to highlight it, and then click the
Cancel Payment button. Quicken asks you to confirm your stop-payment request, and
then adds the payment cancellation to your list of instructions to send. The next time
you connect to your bank, Quicken sends the instruction to cancel the payment. (This
works only if your bank hasn’t already made the payment, of course.) If the stop-pay-
ment request works, Quicken voids the electronic payment.

With online account transfers, you can move money between accounts and even pay
a credit card bill, if the credit card is issued by the bank with which you do your online
banking. With online statements, you can receive your bank statement electronically
and make account reconciliations very fast and easy.
There aren’t any hard-and-fast prerequisites for using online account transfers and
statements. However, you’ll find these online features easiest if you’ve been using the
program (such as Quicken or Money or QuickBooks) for at least a few weeks and have
performed one or two reconciliations on the accounts that you want to use. Of course,
you’ll also need to sign up for online account transfers and online statements with your
bank and have an Internet connection.

If your bank doesn’t provide the service and you use Quicken, you can use the
account program to find a bank that does provide the service. For example,
in Quicken, you can find a bank by using the Finance menu’s Online Finan-
cial Institutions List. When you choose this command, Quicken connects to
the Quicken.com Web site through the Internet and gets a list of the numerous
major banks that provide online services in cooperation with Quicken. This list
appears in the Financial Institution Directory. Read through the information
to learn which services your bank or other banks in your area offer and how

at the top of the tab to choose an account. Click the name of the account that you want
to examine, and Quicken will display the data in the window below the list box.
In Figure 19-11, you can see one disadvantage of online banking. Because banks don’t
keep track of the names on the checks, all checks (like check number 1206 in Figure
19-11) look as though they’re made out to Check. If the check doesn’t match with one
you’ve already entered in the register, you can enter the Payee name and assign the
category as you enter the downloaded transaction in the register. Online banking does
supply the Payee name for your credit card accounts or for debit purchases. Different
banks handle the register details differently, however.

section to move through the lists and compare transactions. To accept a single trans-
action and add it to your register, highlight the transaction by clicking it, and then click
the Accept button. To accept all of the transactions at once, click Accept All. To re-
move a transaction without adding it to your register, click the transaction, and then
click Delete.

cate whether you want to balance against a paper statement you’ve received through the
mail or against the most recent online balance you’ve retrieved.

In general, online accounts are extremely easy to reconcile. The reason is that
you can more frequently reconcile the accounts—even as much as every day.
This means you quickly catch the sorts of errors that make manual reconcili-

Online banking isn’t quite the experience that the banks and software companies prom-
ise. Yet that’s really too bad because the unmet promises of online banking can obscure
the positive features. Online banking, account transfers, and statements already offer
true convenience and timesavings to individuals and businesses with heavy accounting
duties. And these online banking services are only getting better. Even now, there’s little
reason not to take advantage of them.

While a traditional, full-service broker might charge you as much as $100 to
buy or sell a security, online brokerage services often charge only a few dol-

Despite the popularity of online investing, however, not every online investing activ-
ity is easy. Accordingly, this final chapter discusses how to set up and use online investing.

What Is Online Investing?
What Is Online Investing?
What Is Online Investing?
What Is Online Investing?
What Is Online Investing?
Online investing, in a nutshell, simply means you use your Web browser and an Internet
connection to give buy or sell instructions to a broker. You make these transactions using
a Web form. Web forms vary from one online broker to the next, but, in general, the
Web form simply provides a space for you to identify the security you want to buy or
sell, the type of buy or sell transaction you want to place, and an expiration date for an
order. (We discuss all of these items in more detail later in the chapter.)
After you describe a sale or purchase you want to make by filling in the fields on the
Web form, you click a Send button to transfer this information to the online broker’s
computers. These computers then place your order at the appropriate securities ex-
change, and assuming there is somebody willing to transact with you, the computer takes
care of either buying or selling the securities.
Even though your computer and the Internet seem to promise instant satisfaction, there
is a lag time in processing the transaction while your order reaches the online broker’s
server. (This might take some time if the Internet or your online broker is experienc-
ing heavy traffic.) You also need to wait for someone to accept the order. (Simply ask-
ing to buy a stock at a particular price or saying that you want to sell a bond at a
particular price doesn’t mean somebody else is willing to buy or sell at that exact
moment.)
Picking a Broker
Picking a Broker
Picking a Broker
Picking a Broker
Picking a Broker
Picking the best online broker for your specific situation generally involves two factors:
the cost of the online broker’s services and the range of the services you need.
Considering Net Investment Costs
Considering Net Investment Costs
Considering Net Investment Costs
Considering Net Investment Costs
Considering Net Investment Costs
The cost of an online broker is sometimes confusing—at least at first glance. In gen-
eral, your investing costs include three items: the cost per trade, the account mainte-
nance fee (if any), and the interest income you’ll earn on your cash account.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
We’ll use the term net investment costs to describe the sum of your trading
commission expenses (a positive number), any account maintenance fee
expenses (a positive number), and the interest income (a negative number).
Assume, for example, that your broker charges you $10 per trade and a $50 annual
maintenance fee, and that your cash account will earn 2%. If you trade (buy or sell) 50

times a year and carry $25,000 in cash in your associated cash account, your estimated
costs total:
$10 * 50 trades + $50 annual fee - 2% * $25,000 = $25 net costs
While $25 of net investment costs might seem minimal—especially considering the
modest $10 commission paid for a trade—consider another example. Assume your
broker charges you $30 a trade, no annual maintenance fee, and that your cash account
will earn 4%. In this case, your estimated costs total:
$30 * 20 trades + $0 annual fee - 4% * $25,000 = $0 net costs
Clearly, then, considering costs means looking at more than just the trading commis-
sion. Account maintenance fees (if these are charged) and interest rates paid on cash
accounts (whenever you’ll have large cash balances) can mean an online broker that looks
cheap may be just as expensive as some other, seemingly overcharging broker.
Considering Investment Services

Obviously, you want to make sure that the broker you choose lets you buy and sell the
sorts of securities you want to invest in. You also want to make sure the online broker
provides any ancillary services that you need for your investing—such as access to online
research reports.
The major business newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and monthly magazines like
Smart Money, Worth, and Money regularly debate the strengths and weaknesses of the
popular, large online brokerage services. If you haven’t yet picked an online broker, you
may want to keep your eye out for feature articles in any of these periodicals that dis-
cuss which online brokerage services seem to be the most popular and working best for
investors.
Before you make a firm decision on an online brokerage service, you need to know that
your broker will allow you to electronically retrieve your brokerage account statement.
In other words, you want to make sure that your broker will prepare an electronic version
of the monthly account statement that you can then automatically download into the
personal accounting program you use for investment record-keeping. As a practical
matter, this means that you want to be able to download an electronic statement into
either Intuit Quicken or Microsoft Money.
By having an online brokerage service that provides this service, you almost eliminate
your investment bookkeeping. The online brokerage service does the transaction entry
work described later in the chapter.

Once you select an appropriate broker, you will need to follow their instructions for
setting up your online brokerage account. This probably involves filling out an appli-
cation. You will also need to get an account name, an account number, and a password,
which you’ll use to identify yourself to the online broker’s Web server. (The process of
applying for and being approved for an online brokerage account takes several days.)
You also typically provide your initial investment of funds as part of this process.
Choosing an Online Portfolio

Choosing an Online Portfolio
Choosing an Online Portfolio
Choosing an Online Portfolio
An online portfolio is an investing option that represents a hybrid between a
mutual fund account and an online investment account. Online portfolios allow
you to build a portfolio of stocks for a set fee. For example, at the time we were
writing this late in 2000, a new service called Folio fn allowed you to buy as many
as 150 stocks for either $29.95 a month or $295 a year. That seems expensive, but
if you want to take a passive investment approach and you have significant funds
to invest, an online portfolio may make sense. On a $300,000 portfolio, for example,
$295 is roughly .1%, which is roughly half of the expense ratio on the hugely
popular Vanguard Index 500 mutual fund and the new electronically traded funds
that let investors buy indexes.
The other interesting feature of an online portfolio for taxable investors is that these
portfolios let you easily harvest tax losses. For example, if you had invested in a port-
folio of 80 stocks, even though the portfolio showed an overall gain, you could sell
stocks with unrealized capital losses to trigger deductible capital losses.

Once you’ve applied for and been approved for an online investing account and have
received your account number, account name, and password, you are ready to begin
buying and selling securities. You are also ready to begin using the online brokerage
services research tools to research securities you may want to buy or may want to sell.

You’ll benefit by spending some time exploring the online brokerage service’s Web site
before you ever attempt to place an order to buy or sell securities. Most of the popular
Web sites provide a rich set of tools and resources to investors. You can often get an
analyst’s research for securities you are interested in buying or selling. You can get
historical price and volume information about securities—such as the graph of the
securities prices over the last year. Or you can often use the online broker’s Web site for
brokerage account maintenance activities, such as changing the e-mail address the online
brokerage uses to communicate with you, changing your password, or providing new
mailing address information.

To use this stock order form, simply fill in the blanks. In general, no matter which online
investment service you use, you take the following steps:
1. Indicate what kind of order you are placing.
Select an entry from the Buy/Sell drop-down list box.
2. Indicate purchase or sale quantity.
For example, tell the broker how many shares of a stock you want to buy or sell.
3. Identify the security.
Enter the ticker symbol in the Symbol box. If you don’t know the symbol for a
security, click the TickerSearch hyperlink to search for the security symbol.

4. (Optional) Set a limit price if you want to buy or sell a security—but only if it can
be bought for a specified price.
Enter this price in the Limit Price box. Note that you would often use a market order,
which is just an order to buy or sell a security at its current market price. However,
you can also set a price, or limit, that you want. If you set a limit on a buy order, you’re
saying you want to buy only if the price is below the limit. If you set a limit on a
sell order, you’re saying you want to sell only if the price is above the limit. Note that
if the market price never moves past the limit, your order will not go through.
NOTE

NOTE
NOTE
A market order is an order placed to buy or sell at the current market price.
During market hours, you can follow the market price on online brokerage
service Web sites by looking up a real-time quote. Some companies charge
for this service, while others provide free, unlimited real-time quotes to ac-
count holders.
5. (Optional) Set a stop price if you want to buy or sell a security—but only if it moves
past a certain point.
Again, you would probably most often use market orders. However, you can also set
a price that the market price needs to move past before your order is processed. If
you set a stop order on a buy, the stop price is the price at which the market price
needs to move past for your order to be placed and hopefully processed. If you set
a stop order on a sell, the stop price is the price at which the market price needs to
move past for your order to be placed and hopefully processed.
6. Identify which account you will use for funds.
Select an account type from the Account Type drop-down list box. For example, if
you’re buying or selling securities using cash in your money market, cash, or sweep
account, select this entry. If you were instead using margin, select this entry. If you
were shorting a security—this means selling a security you don’t own or buying back
a security to cover a previously created short position—select this entry.
7. Describe the type of order.
Select an order type from the Order Type drop-down list box. For example, if you
want to place a market order—that means you are willing to buy or sell the security
at the market price—select this entry. If instead you want to buy a stock only at a
limit price, select the Limit Order Type. If you want to buy a stock only at the stock
price, select the Stock Order Type. You can also specify that the order type is a stop
limit order.

8. Indicate the duration of the order.
Select an entry from the Duration drop-down list box. Day means the order is good
for a day, and GTC, which stands for “good ’til canceled,” means that the order stays
outstanding until either it’s executed or you cancel it. Figure 20-4 shows a completed
order.
Figure 20-4
A completed order at the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online Web site.
After you have described in detail an order you want to place, click a Send, Place, or
Pre-Submit button. Figure 20-4, for example, shows a Pre-Submit button. The online
brokerage service then displays a confirmation window that describes your order, as
shown in Figure 20-5. Use this window to review the order description and make sure
that the order is as you want. The Verify Order window typically also identifies the
estimated commission and any fees, as well as the net proceeds you will receive.

Assuming the order is correct, click the Place Order, Order Now, or Submit button. The
brokerage service then places your order. Probably within a few seconds your order will
be executed and you will have either sold or purchased securities.
The online brokerage service may provide you with a Web page that lists your pend-
ing orders. Typically, you can use this pending order Web page to monitor which orders
you have outstanding. You will also typically have a Web page that lets you confirm the
details of any executed orders. Figure 20-6 shows the Web page that the Morgan Stanley

record-keeping works with Quicken.

Quicken supports online investing for many of the popular online brokerage services.
This means that you don’t have to record the transactions you effect with an online
investment account. Instead, you can tell Quicken to retrieve these transactions directly
from the online investment broker.
To work with your online investment account, start Quicken, click the Investing menu,
and click Online Investing Setup. Then follow the onscreen instructions for setting up
your account.

If you’re forced to use an online broker that won’t let you automatically download account
transactions into your record-keeping system, you need to perform this record-keep-
ing manually. Again, let us say that if at all possible you want to avoid this work—
especially if you’re actively buying and selling securities. However, if you can’t avoid this
manual record-keeping, you can use the instructions below to explain how to do most
of this accounting.
Setting Up an Investment Account

Setting Up an Investment Account
To track investments in Quicken, you need to set up an investment account. Your
investment transactions will be recorded in this account. You typically set up an invest-
ment account for each mutual fund in which you own shares and each brokerage ac-
count in which you hold securities.
To set up an investment account, click the Finance menu and click Account List to open
the Account List. Click New to open the Create New Account dialog box. Click the
appropriate Investment option button, click Next, and then provide the information
that Quicken asks for: the account name, whether there’s a linked cash account (for
storing cash), information about the account’s tax status, and so on.
After you set up the account, select the investment account from the Account List and
click Open to open the Create Opening Share Balance dialog box. Usually, you don’t
want to use this dialog box because it doesn’t allow you to enter the actual cost data that
is useful for tax calculations, so click Cancel to close this dialog box without entering
data.

Quicken provides two methods for recording transactions such as share purchases: You
can enter a purchase transaction directly into the register. You can also use an invest-
ment form dialog box to collect the share purchase transaction and then have Quicken
enter the purchase transaction in the register for you.
To enter the first and any subsequent purchases of mutual fund shares directly into the
register, display the investment register, as shown in Figure 20-9, and move to the first
empty row of the register.

1. Provide the purchase date.
Enter the purchase date in the Date text box. Be sure to enter the actual purchase
date and not the date you mailed the check to the mutual fund management com-
pany or the broker or the date you recorded the purchase. Quicken categorizes any
capital gain or loss as short-term or long-term based on the difference between the
purchase and sales dates shown in the register.
2. Enter the appropriate purchase action.
If you made this purchase sometime in the past, enter the action as ShrsIn. Place the
cursor in the Action box and type ShrsIn, or select the ShrsIn entry from the Ac-
tion drop-down list box.
If this is a purchase you’re currently making, enter the action as BuyX. Type BuyX
in the Action box, or select that entry from the Action drop-down list box.

3. Name the security you’re purchasing.
You can select a security from the Security drop-down list box. Or if you are pur-
chasing this security for the first time, enter the security name and Quicken will
prompt you for the additional information it needs.
4. Provide the share price.
Enter the price per share you paid in the Avg. Cost or Price box. (Quicken changes
the name of the box that holds the share price data from Avg. Cost to Price if you
record a BuyX transaction.) You can enter the share price in dollars and cents, such
as 10.125, or in dollars and eighths, such as 10 1/8.
5. Provide either the number of shares purchased or the total purchase amount.
Enter the number of shares you purchased in the Shares box or the total amount you
paid in the Basis or Amount box. (Quicken changes the name of the box that holds
the total price from Basis to Amount if you record a BuyX transaction.)
Quicken calculates whatever piece of data you didn’t enter. For example, if you enter
the price as $10.00 and the number of shares as 100, Quicken calculates the total
as $1,000.00.
6. (Optional) Record additional information.
If you want to record some additional piece of information, such as the order num-
ber, use the Memo box.
7. If necessary, record the transfer account.
If you’re recording a BuyX action, use the XFer Acct box to show which account you
used to pay for the purchase. If you enter an account name in the XFer Acct box,
Quicken records a payment transaction in the account equal to the value you enter
in the XFer Amt box.
8. If necessary, provide the commission paid.
If you’re recording a BuyX action, either enter the amount you paid for the shares
and any commission in the XFer Amt box or enter the commission you paid in the
Comm Fee box. (If you purchased shares of a no-load mutual fund, the commission
equals zero.)
Quicken calculates whatever piece of data you didn’t enter. For example, if you enter
the total paid for the mutual fund shares as $1,000.00 and the commission as $50.00,
Quicken calculates the XFer Amt as $1,050.00.

9. Click Enter to record the transaction.
Quicken records the transaction into the investment register and moves to the next
empty row of the register so you can enter another transaction. If you entered the
Action as BuyX, Quicken also records a payment transaction in the XFer Acct. The
last transaction in the investment register shown in Figure 20-9 shows a BuyX trans-
action recording the purchase of Labor Ready at 3 3/4.

ister, and click the Easy Actions button to open the Easy Actions menu. Click

Quicken takes the information entered in the Record Income dialog box and records
transactions in the investment register. Quicken records one transaction for each type
of distribution. Figure 20-11 shows the investment register with a $250 dividend
distribution, a $25 short-term capital gain distribution, and a $75 long-term capital
gain distribution. (These are the last transactions shown in the register.)
Figure 20-11 How Quicken records an income distribution in the register.
As noted earlier, you don’t need to use the Record Income dialog box to enter income
distribution transactions in an investment register, but it makes things easier. To record
them directly into the register, enter each distribution individually (see Figure 20-11).
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE

NOTE
When you reinvest a mutual fund distribution, you essentially combine two
of the transactions already described in this chapter: receiving a distribution
and buying shares. You can record this sort of transaction directly into the
register, but as with income distributions you don’t reinvest, the easiest
approach is to use the Reinvest Income form, which works like the Record
Income form. To display the Reinvest Income, open the investment account’s
register, click the Easy Actions button, and click Reinvest Income.

To record the sale of shares using an investment form, display the investment account’s
register, click the Easy Actions button and click Sell/Remove Shares to open the Sell/
Remove Shares dialog box, as shown in Figure 20-12.
Figure 20-12 The Summary tab of the Sell/Remove Shares dialog box.
To record the share sale, enter the sale date in the Date box; enter the security in the
Security box; enter the number of shares being sold in the # Of Shares box; enter the
share sales price in the Price/Share box; and enter the sales commission you are pay-
ing, if any, in the Commission box. If you’re recording a current sale, indicate the account
into which you’ll deposit the sales proceeds by clicking the Yes, To option button in
the Record Proceeds? section of the dialog box; and then select the account from the
Yes, To drop-down list box. Otherwise, if you’re recording an earlier sale and don’t want
to adjust a bank account balance for the sale, click the No option button in the Record
Proceeds? section of the dialog box.
If you want to specifically identify the shares, click the Specify Lots button and use
the Specify Lots For dialog box to specifically identify as many shares as you’ve said
you’ll sell, as shown in Figure 20-13. If you don’t use the Specify Lots button to
specifically identify the shares you’re selling, Quicken uses a first-in, first-out costing
assumption to calculate the capital gain or loss on the sale. In other words, it assumes
the shares you sell are always those you’ve held the longest.

Recording Account Fees
Recording Account Fees
If you write a check to pay an account fee, you don’t need to do anything special in the
investment register. You just write the check in the usual way.
Categorize the check that pays an account fee as investment expense or a similar ex-
pense category. Items such as an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and custodial
fees are miscellaneous deductions. At the time we’re writing this, a miscellaneous de-
duction in excess of 2 percent of your adjusted gross income may be used as an item-
ized deduction.
If you sell shares (or, more likely, the mutual fund manager sells shares) to pay an account
fee, you need to do a little more work to record the account fee. You need to record a
SellX transaction in the investment register, as described in the preceding section
“Describing the Share Sales.”
There’s a slight trick to recording this type of SellX transaction. The entry for the
commission or fee equals the total sales amount. For example, if you record the sale of
$10 of mutual fund shares to pay for, say, a $10 account fee, both the Total Amount
and Comm/Fee boxes show 10. The XFer Amt box, as a result, shows as 0. (When you
record this transaction, Quicken sets the Price box value back to 0, so both the Price
and XFer Amt boxes show 0.)

If you use the Sell/Remove Shares dialog box (displayed when you click Sell/Remove
Shares on the Easy Actions menu) to record an account fee transaction, you enter the
number of shares you need to sell to pay the account fee, the sales price per share, and
the commission. If you’ve correctly entered these inputs, the total sale shows as zero
because the commission—really the account fee—consumes the entire sales proceeds.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
Check with your tax advisor concerning investment expenses such as account
maintenance fees paid for by selling shares. While the approach described here
is the only one you can easily do in Quicken, it causes your account mainte-
nance fees to show up as capital losses equal to whatever you originally paid
for the shares. Unfortunately, this overstates your capital loss by the amount
of the account fee and understates your investment expenses by the amount
of the account fee. On your tax return, therefore, you need to adjust your
capital losses or gains and your investment expenses (a possible miscellaneous
deduction) for this discrepancy.
Recording Share Splits
Recording Share Splits
Recording Share Splits
Recording Share Splits
Recording Share Splits
A share split occurs when the mutual fund or company gives each current shareholder
new shares. In a two-for-one split, for example, a shareholder receives one new share for
each share already held. Someone who holds 100 shares prior to the split, for example,
holds 200 shares after the split. You can record share splits directly into the register or
with an investment form, but the investment form approach is easiest.
To record a share split transaction using an investment form, display the investment
account in a register, click the Easy Actions button and click Stock Split to open the
Stock Split dialog box, as shown in Figure 20-14.
Figure 20-14 The Stock Split dialog box.
To describe the share split, enter the split date in the Date box, enter the mutual fund
or stock that’s splitting in the Security box, enter the number of new shares equal to
one old share in the New Shares box, and enter the number of old shares in the Old
Shares box.

no problem reconciling an investment account.

If you purchase a security and the total purchase cost exceeds the cash balance in a
brokerage account, Quicken assumes that you’ve borrowed the needed cash on margin
from your broker. To show the margin loan, it displays the cash balance as a negative
value.
To record margin loan interest in cases where you have a linked cash account, you record

Writing Calls and Puts
A call is an option to buy a share of stock. A put is an option to sell a share of stock.
You may write, buy, or exercise calls and puts.
When you write a call or put, what you really do is collect money from someone in return
for promising the person the option, or chance, to buy or sell a share of stock at a specified,
or strike, price by some future date. When a call or put expires without being exer-
cised—and this is the usual case—recording the transaction is simple. If you’re the one
writing the call or put, just record the transaction as miscellaneous income.
If you’re the one buying the call or put, you just record the option purchase the way
you do any other stock purchase. If the call or put expires and becomes worthless, just
record the sale as a stock purchase with the amount set to zero. (This is the most com-
mon case.) If, on the other hand, you sell the call or put before the expiration date
because the call or put can be profitably exercised, you record the sale as a stock sale with
the amount set to whatever you sell the option for.

You probably won’t actually exercise a call or put. You’ll probably sell it, as described
above. If you do exercise a call or buy option, however, you need to record two trans-
actions.

To record the exercise of a call option, first record a transaction that sells the call op-
tion for zero. Then record a transaction that purchases the optioned number of shares
at the option price.
To record the exercise of a put option, first record a transaction that sells the put option
for zero. Then record a transaction that sells the optioned number of shares at the option
price.

For income tax purposes, what you pay for a call needs to be counted as part
of the purchase price if you exercise the call option and purchase shares. What
you receive for a put needs to be counted as part of the sales price if you
exercise the put and sell shares. This can get complicated, so you may want
to consult your tax advisor.

Describing Bond Purchases
Whenever you buy additional bonds, you need to record the purchase and any accrued
interest, so you actually record two transactions. As with stocks and mutual funds, you
can record bond purchases directly into the register or by using an investment form.
Because the investment form approach is easier, it’s the one we’ll describe here.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
Bond prices are quoted as a percentage of their face, or par, value. A $1,000
par value bond that sells for $950, for example, has a price of 95. Because
Quicken calculates the total security amount as the price times the quantity,
however, you can’t enter the bond price as a percentage. Instead, you need
to enter the actual dollar price. To describe a bond you’ve purchased for $950,
for example, you enter the price as $950.
To record a bond purchase, follow these steps:
1. Open the Buy/Add Shares dialog box.
Click the Easy Actions menu, and click Buy/Add Shares to open the Buy/Add Shares
dialog box, as shown in Figure 20-16.

2. Record the purchase date, bond name, and number of bonds purchased.
Enter the purchase date in the Date box, enter the bond name in the Security box,
and enter the quantity of bonds you purchased in the # Of Shares box.
3. Enter the dollar price per bond you paid in the Price/Share box.
Remember that Quicken expects you to enter the actual dollar price you paid, not
the price as a percentage of the bond’s face, or par, value.
You don’t include the accrued interest in the bond price in step 3. You record that
bit of information later.
4. Enter the brokerage commission you paid in the Commission box.
You can enter any three of the following four inputs: number of shares, price, com-
mission/fee, or total of sale. Using the three values you do enter, Quicken calculates
the fourth value.
5. Identify the cash you’ll use for the purchase.
If you will use cash from some other account for the purchase instead of cash from
the brokerage account, click the Yes, From option button and use the box to enter
the name of the account. Do this only if you’re not using a linked cash account.
6. Record the transaction.
Click Done. Quicken records the transaction.
After you record the bond purchase, you usually need to record accrued interest paid
to the previous holder. In effect, what you’re really doing by paying accrued interest is
giving the previous bondholder his or her share of the next interest payment. To record
this accrued interest, follow these steps:

As with other investment transactions, you have a choice as to how you record bond
interest and return of capital transactions. You can enter these transactions directly into
the register, as discussed earlier in the chapter, or you can use an investment form.
To record an interest payment, click the Easy Actions menu and then click Record An
Income Event. In the Record Income dialog box, identify the interest payment date,
the security paying the interest, and the amount. Fill in the Record Income dialog box’s
text boxes as described earlier in this chapter. The steps for recording bond income are
similar to those for recording stock or mutual fund income.

You aren’t always paid the interest that you’ve earned. If you purchase a negotiable
certificate of deposit (CD), for example, the bank issuing the CD may accrue the interest
you’ve earned through the end of the year and then add this amount to the CD’s value.
If you purchase a zero-coupon bond, you don’t receive periodic interest payments at
all. Rather, the bond issuer accrues interest each year and then repays the bond and the
total accrued interest at maturity. Even though you aren’t paid interest, however, you
need to record the interest you’ve earned because you need to report the accrued interest
as taxable income. Fortunately, in most cases the bond issuer sends a 1099-OID form
that reports the amount of accrued but not paid interest.
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
NOTE
Bond issuers also report the amortization of original-issue discounts on 1099-
OID forms. In fact, OID stands for Original Issue Discount. Because original-
issue discounts effectively increase the annual interest earnings, you also need
to record these amounts.
To record accrued interest, you actually record two transactions, as mentioned earlier
in this chapter in the discussion of how to record a bond purchase when the purchase
price includes accrued interest. This is what you do:
• Click the Easy Actions menu, click Record An Income Event, and then complete
the Record Income dialog box.
• Click the Easy Actions menu, click Return Of Capital, and then fill in the Return
Of Capital dialog box. Describe the accrued but unpaid interest as a negative return
of capital. (This is the same technique used earlier in the chapter to deal with ac-
crued interest paid with a bond purchase.)
NOTE
NOTE

By entering the return of capital as a negative number, Quicken increases the

Accrued interest income can get messy when, for income tax purposes, you need
to record accrued interest that isn’t reported on a 1099-OID form. The reason is
that you’re required to report the accrued interest—even though you won’t get a
1099-OID amount. Later on, when you ultimately do get a 1099-INT or 1099-
OID that includes the previously recorded accrued interest, you need to adjust this
figure so it doesn’t double-count the accrued interest.
Many people don’t report accrued interest income until it’s reported on a 1099-
OID form or actually paid and reported on a 1099-INT form. With this simpli-
fied approach, you don’t evade income taxes on the interest income, but you do delay
paying the income taxes. Once the interest is accrued, the IRS does insist that you
pay income taxes. If this applies to your situation, talk to your tax advisor.

Describing the bonds you sell is easy as long as you have the necessary information: the
number of bonds sold, the price per share (or the transaction total), and the commis-
sion paid (if any). You also need to know the amount of accrued interest you will be
paid.
As with other investment transactions, you can record bond sales either directly into
the register or by using an investment form; using an investment form is easier. To record
a bond sale, click the Easy Actions menu and click Sell/Remove Shares. In the Sell/
Remove Shares dialog box, click the Summary tab. Enter the sales date, name the bond
being sold, give the sales amount and sales commission, and indicate where you’ll deposit
the money.
After you record the bond sale, you need to record the amount of accrued interest you’re
being paid. In effect, the bond purchaser pays you your share of the next interest
payment. To do this, click the Easy Actions menu, click Record An Income Event, and
fill out the Record Income dialog box so that it describes the accrued interest being paid.
From your perspective, it’s irrelevant that the bond purchaser rather than the bond issuer
pays the interest, so recording this accrued interest payment works just like recording
a regular interest coupon payment, as described earlier in this chapter.

Early withdrawal penalties on certificates of deposit are a special type of tax-deduct-
ible expense. Like IRA contributions, alimony, and a few other items, these penalties
are deductions from your total income and are used to calculate your adjusted gross
income. Because of this, be sure to record any early withdrawal penalties you pay with
a separate transaction. If you’re using an investment account with a linked cash account,
record the early withdrawal penalty as if it were paid from the cash account. If you’re
not using an investment with a linked cash account, use the Easy Actions menu’s
Miscellaneous Expense command. In either case, when you do record the early with-
drawal penalty, categorize the early withdrawal penalty expense in a way that lets you
easily report this penalty on your income tax return. (You might want to set up a new
expense category called Early Withdrawal Penalty.)

    Microsoft Money makes a similarly problematic return calculationon its
   investment reports.
What Is an IRR?
What Is an IRR?
What Is an IRR?
What Is an IRR?
What Is an IRR?
The IRR tool calculates the annual profit an investment delivers as a percentage
of the investment’s value at the start of the year. For example, in a simple case, if
you buy an investment for $100 and the investment pays $10 in dividends at the
end of the year and then is sold for $95, your IRR is 5 percent.
There are actually two steps to making this calculation:
• First, you need to calculate the annual profit. You can do this by combining the
$10 of dividends with the $5 capital loss (calculated as $95–$100) for a result
of $5 of annual profit.
• Second, you divide the $5 of annual profit by the $100 investment value at the
start of the year. $5/$100 equals 5 percent, and that’s the IRR.
By calculating an IRR, you can quantify the performance of a stock that you’ve pur-
chased and of your investment portfolio as a whole. This is particularly true with
individual stocks and brokerage accounts because you often don’t really know how
your stock picks, your broker’s picks, and your portfolio have done and are doing
relative to the market as a whole and relative to other investments.
In comparison, you usually have a pretty good idea as to how well a mutual fund
does on a quarterly or at least an annual basis. The fund manager will report to you
on the quarterly and annual returns.

Now that you understand the basic logic of the IRR tool, you should know that
the IRR, for all of its usefulness, isn’t flawless. Quicken (and every other investment
record-keeper’s computer program) calculates a daily IRR and then multiplies this
percentage by the number of days in a year to get an equivalent annual IRR.

This sounds right, but it presents problems in the case of publicly traded securities
because a short-term percentage change in a security’s market value—even if mod-
est—can annualize to a very large positive or negative number. If you buy a stock for
$10 1/8 and the next day the stock drops to $10, the annual return using these two
pieces of information is a whopping –98.9 percent! If you buy a stock for $10 1/8
and the next day the stock rises to $10 1/4, the annual return using these two pieces
of information is an astronomical 8,711 percent.
To minimize the problems of annualizing short-term percentage changes, you prob-
ably want to refrain from measuring IRRs for only short periods of time. An an-
nualized daily return can be very misleading.
One other thing to note is that the IRR calculation becomes more difficult when
you try to calculate the average annual profit percentage, or IRR, for a series of years
when the starting value is changing from year to year. The basic problem is that the
IRR formula is what’s called an nth root polynomial (n is the number of days in
the IRR calculation). A one-year IRR calculation is a 365th root polynomial.
(Remember that Quicken calculates daily IRRs and then annualizes these daily
percentages.)
The problem with an nth root polynomial is that, by definition, it can have up to
n real and imaginary solutions. An annual IRR calculation could theoretically have
365 correct IRRs. You would not normally have this many solutions, but you could
still have several correct solutions. So you can see that by using IRR-based return
calculations, there’s an opportunity for real confusion. Quicken, recognizing these
problems, does not attempt to calculate IRRs for investments that look like they
may have more than one IRR. You’ll know for which investments you can’t calcu-
late an IRR, but you won’t know how those investments did.

For investors with large portfolios, online investing offers big benefits. Investment costs
often decrease, and investment record-keeping often becomes simpler. In some cases,
investment decisions may even get better because of access to better information. Online
investment tools, however, can be tricky use—especially as you start. The information
provided in this chapter should help to ease the burden of becoming proficient.

Before getting into Internet Explorer specifics, we want to explain how a Web browser
works. You don’t need this information to use a Web browser, of course, but knowing
about the process will help you understand why access is sometimes slow, give you a clue
as to the meaning of some of the cryptic messages you sometimes see on your screen,
and, in general, help you to become a more informed business user of the Internet.
When you enter a Web address in the Web browser application on your computer, here
is a general overview of what happens:
• The browser software on your computer sends the address to your Internet service
provider (ISP).
• Your ISP then sends the address to the nearest node of the domain name server
(DNS). The DNS is a set of databases, distributed among servers, that stores the
numeric addresses of Web sites. (A later section in this appendix explains URLs and
numeric addresses.)
• The DNS returns the site’s numeric address to your Web browser.
• Your Web browser sends the numeric address to a router, which checks the traffic
on the Internet and finds a path that is the least busy to the server that contains the
resource you are requesting.
• The server receives the address, acknowledges this receipt, and places the request in
a queue to wait until the server fulfills earlier requests. When the server acknowl-
edges the receipt, you’ll see a message in the browser’s status line that tells you the
connection is successful.
• The server then sends the resource back over the Internet to your ISP, which then
sends it to your computer.

This process may sound time-consuming, but even with a slow Internet connection,
it can take only seconds, and with a fast Internet connection, it can happen almost
instantaneously, whether the resource is stored on a server halfway around the world
or on a server in the next building in your office complex.

• Double-click the Browse The Internet alias on the desktop.
• Double-click the Microsoft Internet Explorer alias in the folder where Internet Ex-
plorer is installed.
• Select Web Page from the Apple menu’s Favorites item.
The first time you open Internet Explorer, you’ll see something similar to Figure B-

the URL to open that page in Internet Explorer. In addition, double-clicking a filename
that ends in .htm or .html opens that file in Internet Explorer.

A Word About URLs

ord About URLs
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and is an address for a resource on the
Internet. It actually represents a string of numbers called an Internet Protocol (IP)
address, for example, 169.254.69.104. Since it’s much easier for humans to remem-
ber names instead of numbers, we typically use URLs.
A URL is composed of a protocol, the name of the server on which the resource resides,
and, optionally, the path to the resource and its filename. For example, in the URL http:/
/www.redtechpress.com, http is the protocol (in this case, Hypertext Transfer Protocol),
www indicates that the resource is on the World Wide Web, redtechpress is the server,
and .com is the domain name. Such a URL might also include the path, such as /cata-
log, and the name of a document, such as /index.html. You frequently see URLs in various
media as simply www.redtechpress.com. Internet Explorer and other Web browsers
assume the http protocol unless you specify otherwise. Another less frequently seen
protocol is FTP (File Transfer Protocol); an FTP server contains programs and files
that users can download.
The final part of the server name, in our example, .com, refers to the domain type. At
present seven domain types are recognized:
• .com is a commercial organization.
• .edu is an educational institution, for example, a university.
• .gov is an entity that is part of the U.S. government.
• .int is an international organization, such as the United Nations.
• .mil is a branch of the U.S. military.

• .net is a network organization.
• .org is a nonprofit organization.
You pronounce the domain part of a URL as dot com, dot e-d-u, dot gov, and so on.
You have, no doubt, though seen references to dot-coms, which are businesses that in
recent years have sprung up on the Internet. These are not simply businesses that have
a Web site, but businesses that exist entirely on the Internet.
Mid-2000 found many dot-coms in trouble, and Forrester Research, a leader in com-
piling Internet and business statistics, predicted that by 2001 most dot-coms would
go out of business. The reason, according to some dot-com CEOs, is that the focus was
on acquiring an audience at all costs—regardless of the costs.
The Internet is a seductive medium, but it’s probably safe to assume that there’s no
substitute for a well-designed and carefully thought-out business plan.

The components of the Internet Explorer window are much like those in other
Macintosh applications. You’ll see vertical and horizontal scroll bars as necessary, you
can size portions of the window by clicking and dragging, and you can display a
ScreenTip by pointing to a button. Here is a list of some other components:
• The Menu bar is at the top of the window, and it contains a set of menus, many of
which appear in other Macintosh applications.
• The Title bar is just beneath the Menu bar and it displays the name of the current
Web page or other file that is open.
• The Button bar is just beneath the Title bar, and it contains several buttons that
correspond to the actions you perform most often, such as the Back, Forward, and
Home navigation buttons.
• The Address bar is beneath the Button bar, and you use it to enter a URL or filename.
You can drag the small @ icon on the Address bar to left of the address (and on the
Title bar) to another location to create a link to the current page.
• The Favorites bar (also known as the Toolbar Favorites) located under the Address
bar contains a short list of preselected hyperlinks. You can add or remove pages from
this list.
• The Activity Indicator is the large “e” at the far right of the Menu bar and is ani-
mated when Internet Explorer is sending or receiving data.

• The Explorer bar is a slim bar that appears along the left side of the browser win-
dow. It contains a number of useful tools, such as the Favorites and History fold-
ers, which expand into a small pane when clicked.
• The Main window displays the resource you most recently accessed.
• The Status bar is at the bottom of the screen. When you choose a menu command,
the Status bar displays a description of what it does. When you point to a hyperlink,
the Status bar displays its URL. When you click a hyperlink, the Status bar displays
a series of messages related to the progress of finding and opening that resource.

If you’ve entered a URL (perhaps a lengthy one) and then want to use only part of it
to try to access a resource, place the cursor in the Address bar, hold down the Control
key, and press the right or left arrow key to jump forward or backward to the next
separator character (the slashes, the dots, and so on).
To quickly fill in the www and .com for a Web address, enter the domain name you
want to visit, such as apple, and then press Control+Enter. Internet Explorer automati-
cally fills in the URL to make www.apple.com.

to complete the URL for you, as well as display a list of possible URLs under the Address
bar, as shown in Figure B-2. This is the AutoComplete feature at work. If AutoComplete
picks the URL you want, simply press the Enter key. Otherwise keep typing. If you
see the URL you want to visit in the list that appears, click the URL with your mouse

but it is a mixed bag when it comes to security. Although the information stored as an
AutoComplete entry is encrypted on your hard drive and is not accessible to Web sites,

A hyperlink, or simply link, can be a word, a phrase, an image, or a symbol that forms
a connection with a resource that can be located on your local computer, your local
network, or the Internet. In Internet Explorer, textual links are usually underlined and
in a different color from normal text. You know something is a link if the pointer
becomes a hand with a pointing finger when you place the mouse cursor over it.
To follow a link, of course, you simply click it. To return to the page you were viewing
before following a link, click the Back button on the Button bar or press the Delete key.
To then return to the page you were viewing before you pressed Back, click the For-
ward button. If a page is taking too long to download, click the Stop button. Click the
Refresh button to reload the current page. Click the Home button to return to your
home page.

Sometimes you come across a Web page with a number of links that you’d like to follow.
If you open the links one at a time, it’s easy to lose track of the original page contain-
ing the links, and opening each page in its own window can get awkward. To avoid this
confusion, you can use Internet Explorer’s Page Holder feature to create a temporary
copy of the main page, which you can then use to navigate from without worrying about
losing track of it.
To use the Page Holder, follow these steps:

services such as AltaVista, Excite, Infoseek, Lycos and Yahoo!. You know that you can
go to those sites and enter a search term or phrase to locate documents and other re-
sources that contain references to your search item. With Internet Explorer, however,
it’s possible to search all those services at the same time plus a few more. You can also

used by anyone with local or network access to your hard drive to determine what Web
sites you’ve visited, so it’s useful to understand what these files are, what they do, and
how to configure the way in which Internet Explorer deals with them.

The first type of file that Internet Explorer creates is the cookie. Cookie support is a
much maligned but mostly harmless feature of all modern browsers. A cookie is noth-

tion you provide to a Web site—typically what items you’d like to purchase from an
online store. Cookies can’t harm your computer, nor can they provide Web sites with
any information you didn’t already introduce.
To view and work with the cookies on your hard drive, follow these steps:

Of course, the most important thing about Internet Explorer Macintosh Edition is not
how it works but how you can use it to access the resources that make you a more
informed and better-equipped businessperson. You can certainly just point and click
to your heart’s desire, but you’ll soon find yourself off track and probably wasting a good
bit of time. Using the techniques described in this appendix, you can, for example, click
a site from your Favorites list to go immediately to a site whose data you need to check
every day or perhaps even more often (such as stock prices or weather conditions). You
can quickly search for and find Web sites, business names and addresses, and all sorts
of other business resources, and you can save the file, print it, and send it to a colleague
or a client. You won’t necessarily need to do all of these things every day, but you can
refer to this appendix when a specific task presents itself.

P
erhaps even more than the Web, electronic mail has become an essential business
tool. Before the Internet was available commercially, we worked at companies that
provided internal e-mail programs, and with all the right connections, you could ac-
cess your office e-mail account from home. Within days, most new employees were so
dependent on the e-mail system that they ceased to function if the server went down.
And that was small potatoes compared with how the business world now relies on the
Internet for e-mail.

In addition to being an e-mail reader, Outlook Express is also a newsreader.
Chapter 5 discusses newsgroups.
In this appendix we look at how to use Microsoft Outlook Express Macintosh Edition,
the e-mail program that’s included with the most recent versions of MacOS. Outlook
Express is an Internet standards e-mail reader, which means that you can use it to send
and receive e-mail if you have an Internet e-mail account. An e-mail account is not the
same thing as an account with an online information service, such as CompuServe or
America Online. An Internet e-mail account provides services such as standards-based
e-mail, but it does not provide services such as chat rooms, access to databases, confer-
ences, and so on.

As Chapter 3 mentioned, you don’t need to understand how a Web browser works to
use it, and you don’t need to understand how e-mail works to use an e-mail program
to send and receive messages. But if you know in general the steps involved in getting
a message from your computer to another computer on the Internet, you’ll become a
more informed business user, and you’ll have an idea of what’s going on when you see,
for example, a message that says “POP server unavailable.”
After you create an e-mail message and click the Send button, your message travels the
following route to get to its intended recipient:

• Your e-mail program, such as Outlook Express, contacts your ISP’s computer and
connects to an SMTP server program. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol. The server program acknowledges that it has been contacted, and your
e-mail program tells the server that it has a message it wants to send. The server pro-
gram then says to send the message or to wait because it is busy.
• If it gets the green light, your e-mail program sends the message to the SMTP server
and asks for confirmation.
• The server confirms that it has received the message and then asks the domain name
server for the best path through the Internet to the intended recipient.
• The domain name server replies with the best path, and the SMTP server sends the
message on its way.
• When the message arrives at the recipient’s SMTP server, it is transferred to a Post
Office Protocol (POP), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), or Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) mail server (such as Hotmail), which holds the message
until the recipient requests it.
• When your recipient logs on to the Internet, opens his or her e-mail program, and
checks for new mail, the message is downloaded to the recipient’s computer.
Although this process sounds very involved, and technically it is, it can happen very
quickly. We live in the United States and exchange messages with a colleague in Greece
in a matter of minutes.
One exception to the process outlined earlier is America Online (AOL), the largest ISP
in the United States. AOL uses proprietary protocols instead of the SMTP and POP
protocols and then uses a gateway to translate the proprietary protocols into the stan-
dard e-mail protocols so that AOL users and users of standard e-mail programs can
communicate. (A gateway is simply a software device that both transfers and converts
information that originates from systems using different communication protocols, or
rules.)

Before you can use Outlook Express to send and receive e-mail, you need to configure
your e-mail account and optionally import any messages or address books you may have
in another mail program.

• The Outbox folder contains messages that are ready to be sent.
• The Sent Items folder contains copies of messages that you have sent.
• The Deleted Items folder contains copies of messages that you have deleted. In other
words, unless you tell Outlook Express to do otherwise, messages that you delete are
not immediately removed but are placed in the Deleted Items folder.
• The Drafts folder contains messages that you are working on but that aren’t yet ready
to be sent.

Although some of us may have a Pavlovian reaction to the mail notification alert, you
don’t need to read and process every message the instant it arrives in your Inbox. When
you’re checking mail, you can mark messages so that when you have time you can go
back and deal with them. You can mark messages in the following ways:
• To identify a message as important, select the message header, click the Message
menu, and click Flag Message to place a little red flag to the left of the header.
• If you’ve read a message but want to read it again later and respond, you can mark
it as unread. Select the message header, click the Edit menu, and then click Mark As
Unread. Now instead of an open envelope preceding the header, you’ll see a closed
envelope, with the header in boldface.

To reply to a message from a single sender, click the Reply toolbar button. If the message
was sent to multiple recipients, you can reply to all recipients of the message by click-
ing the Reply All toolbar button. Compose your message and click the Send Now
button to connect to the Internet (if you’re not already) and send the message imme-
diately, or click the Send Later button to place the message in the Outbox to be de-
livered the next time you click the Send & Receive button.
By default, Outlook Express includes the text of the original message in your reply.
Sometimes this can be helpful, and at other times it can be a real nuisance, especially
if you have to wade through several replies to get to the essence of the message. You have
a couple of alternatives if you don’t want the original message included in the reply:
• Click the Reply button, place your cursor in the body of the message, click the Edit
menu, click Select All to highlight the message, and press the Delete key.
• Click the Edit menu and click Preferences to open the Preferences dialog box. Click

You can create a message in two formats: plain text and HTML. By default, Outlook
Express uses plain text. While all modern e-mail programs for Windows and Macintosh
computers support HTML mail, most wireless e-mail devices (such as cell phones and
PDAs) as well as most Internet appliances (such as specialized telephones with e-mail
capability) don’t. (Older versions of America Online and Qualcomm’s Eudora don’t
support HTML either.)
To format text in a message, you need to send the message in HTML format. When
you use HTML to create a message, you are essentially creating a Web page, and you
can format text with different fonts, colors, and apply styles such as numbered lists.
To switch a message from plain text to HTML format, follow these steps:
1. Open a new message.
Click the New toolbar button.
2. Change the message format to HTML.
Click the Format menu and click HTML to display the Formatting toolbar, as shown

Earlier in this chapter we mentioned that you can save files that are attached to mes-
sages. Obviously, you can also attach files to messages. Before getting into the details,
though, we need to remind you that some rather serious computer viruses make the
rounds via e-mail attachments. Many businesses would cease to function these days if
they couldn’t e-mail files to colleagues and clients, so abandoning the use of file attach-
ments is not an option. To be on the safe side, we recommend not opening any attach-
ments that you didn’t specifically request or for which you don’t know the source; just
select the message header, and press the Delete key. Also, be particularly wary of an
attachment that appears to have been forwarded.
To open or save an attachment, follow these steps:
1. Open the message.
Double-click the message containing the attachment to open it in its own window.

to all messages. Your business or organization may, in fact, have guidelines about what
you should include in a signature. It’s common to include your name, title, the name
of your organization, perhaps its physical address, and your phone number.

You are not at the mercy of your Inbox. With Outlook Express 5 Macintosh Edition
you can create very powerful message rules for all mail and news accounts you use. You
can choose to earmark junk mail, block mail from certain senders, and you can route
mail from other senders directly to a folder.
To create a message rule, follow these steps:
1. Open the Mail Rules window.

This will help to prevent the loss of important messages.
6. Specify what action to perform.
In the Then section, specify what action you want to perform on messages that meet
your selection criteria. For example, you might want to select Move Message from
the first drop-down list box and then specify a folder to move the selected messages
to.

An identity in Outlook Express is sort of an e-mail user profile. You’ll want to use
identities if more than one person uses your computer and uses Outlook Express. When
you set up identities, each person sees only his or her e-mail messages and has his or her
own contacts in Address Book.
When you install Outlook Express, you are set up as the main identity. To set up other
identities, follow these steps:
1. Click the File menu, and click Switch Identities.

Unless you’ve turned off sounds, you’ll hear a sound when a new message arrives in your
Inbox. You can disable this sound if you want, you can specify that Outlook Express
check for new messages more frequently or less often, and you can personalize a num-
ber of other features that concern e-mail and news, using the Preferences dialog box.
To open the Preferences dialog box, click the Edit menu and then click Preferences.
A few of the tabs in the Preferences dialog box are discussed in the following sections,
the rest you can probably figure out on your own, or with the aid of Outlook Express’s
online Help.

In addition, you can use the options in the Compose tab to enable or disable the fol-
lowing features:
• Save a copy of every message you send in the Sent Items folder. This option is se-
lected by default, and we suggest that you leave it that way. Having a record of what
you said when and to whom is always a good idea in any business situation.
• Include the original message when you reply to a message. This option is enabled
by default, and if you ever want to do this, leave it enabled. Otherwise, you can’t
include the message in your reply. If you don’t want to include the message, it’s easy
to delete it from your reply. Simply place your cursor in the body of the message,
click the Edit menu, click Select All, and then press the Delete key.
• If you receive messages in both plain text and HTML format, you can reply in the
format in which the messages were sent by clicking the Reply To Messages In The
Format In Which They Were Sent check box.

paragraph indications, contain a lot of abbreviations and misspelled words, and so on. Not
impressive from a business point of view, or from any point of view for that matter.
True, e-mail has developed as one of the most important communications tools ever
because it’s quick and easy, but in a business environment you want to apply the same
standards to e-mail that you apply to any other form of communication. You want to
portray a professional image, and you want your customers, colleagues, and other con-
tacts to trust you and your abilities.
At the very least, read a message before you click the Send Now button. If you want
to avoid embarrassing typos and misspelled words, select the option in the Spelling tab
of the Preferences dialog box to always check the spelling of a message before it is sent.
(As we mentioned earlier, you won’t have the Spelling tab unless you have an Office
application installed that contains the spell-checking feature.) The options are in general
those found in other applications that can check spelling.

Do you ever wonder how you’d get by without the number of communications tools
you currently have at your disposal? Phone, voice mail, fax, e-mail, pagers, the Internet
and its vast supply of instant resources, even paper memos, reports, home-to-office
network connections—the list seems endless. Or, maybe instead you wonder how to get
your work done in the midst of all these tools.
A recent issue of Harvard Management Update, a newsletter put out by the publish-
ing arm of Harvard Business School, had some suggestions that we’ve adapted for
inclusion here. Not every suggestion is applicable to all situations, but among them, you’re
sure to find some that will help you better manage the deluge of information that faces
you in your electronic office.
• You don’t have to read e-mail the instant you hear the you-have-mail alert. Some
business professionals set aside certain times each day to check e-mail. You don’t have
to be interrupted unless you want to be. If something is really urgent, the sender will
probably find another way to get in touch with you.
• You also don’t have to answer the phone just because it rings. You can let voice mail
pick it up and then respond at certain times during the day that let you give your
full attention to the matters at hand.

• Don’t open every e-mail message. If the subject line tells you that another get-rich-
quick scheme has just landed in your mailbox, press the Delete key.
• If an e-mail message looks interesting but you can tell that it isn’t essential, consider
moving it to another folder for similar messages. You can then read them at your
leisure.
• Instead of using e-mail for team projects, set up an intranet (an internal Internet)
or a secure Internet Web site to which members can post messages and files.
• Take care of paper filing first, and then set up an electronic filing system for e-mail.
Create folders for projects, people, and so on, and be diligent about moving messages
into these folders.
• If you have tons of old messages lying around, just get rid of them. If you can’t bear
that thought, move them to a folder for old messages.
• Multitask. Return phone calls while printing something, or check your paper orga-
nizer while downloading a file from the Internet.
• Don’t waste time by following links that have nothing to do with the reason you’re
searching the Internet.
• Unsubscribe to newsletters you no longer need or never get around to reading.
(Chapter 5 discusses electronic newsletters and mailing lists.)
• Regularly evaluate your sources of information—journals, periodicals, reports, memos,
and so on—and discontinue all that are not essential. Be on the lookout for new
information sources that will keep you current.
• Set aside 5 to 10 minutes each day to learn something new about any of your elec-
tronic tools.
