Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the team at Apress, especially Louise Corrigan, Melissa Maldonado, and  
James Markham. Their patience, professionalism, and guidance is greatly appreciated.
I also owe a great deal of gratitude to Mark Lupo and Todd Carlisle of the Columbus, GA SBDC (Small 
Business Development Center) office. Their years of experience in assisting the development and growth of 
small businesses gives them a valuable perspective; they know very well that any business can always benefit 
by cutting costs when feasible. They also know how important it is for new business upstarts to save as much 
as possible. Their counsel during the development of this book was invaluable, and is greatly appreciated.

Introduction
The first time I ever heard of free and open source software goes back to the early 2000s, when I first tried 
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program), a free photo editing alternative to Adobe Photoshop. At the 
time, I was a die-hard Photoshop user, so I dismissed it after about five minutes and never gave it any more 
thought. When I needed software for my business, I just drove to the nearest office supply store, found what 
I needed, and purchased it. In those days, I thought paid software was the only way to go (and I spent a lot). 
My views on that changed drastically a few short years later.
In early 2009, I was relaunching my business in a new city (my family and I relocated in late 2008). 
We had actually planned this move for a couple of years, but the timing of the sale of our house coincided 
with the unfolding Financial Crisis. Like many other families, we were impacted in a negative way. Our 
relationship with money  was forever redefined, and careful budgeting became a top priority.
My wife, Sally, decided it was time to update her resume in order to search for work that could be done 
from home, so we purchased a resume creation software package for about $20.00 and a new, discontinued 
model computer at a deep discount. The computer (which was running Windows Vista) did not come with 
Microsoft Word installed. MS Word was required to use the resume creation software.
At that time MS Word cost about $100, which was more than our budget allowed. I went online in search 
of a possible alternative. Before long, I discovered a program called OpenOffice that claimed to be a free, 
fully functioning alternative to MS Word, and compatible with Word files. After downloading it and trying it 
out, I was very pleasantly surprised. It worked with the resume creation software just fine, and my search for 
a document creation program ended right there. And the best part was, the license allowed me to copy it and 
install it on multiple computers-all at no cost!
My discovery of OpenOffice was like finding a one hundred dollar bill I had forgotten about. With our 
situation the way it was, it was a truly fortunate find: Sally could work on her resume, and I could install  
OpenOffice on my computer and create sales letters to acquire new customers.
Who This Book Is For
This book was written primarily with business owners and managers in mind, but any frugal-minded 
computer user can find it useful. For the business owner who carefully watches over the expenses of her 
enterprise, this book points the way to some viable, free software solutions. It can be especially helpful to new, 
small business upstarts, serving as a reference to help quickly find viable alternatives to expensive software. 
Operating capital is often limited during the early phase of launching a new venture, so (along with 
other common sense budgeting strategies), it pays to keep as much cash in your business as possible (Figure 1). 
Using free software when possible can help you accomplish this. 

xxiv
■ Introduction
There are many free software titles available that you may not be aware exist. While writing this book, 
I took a poll of about 50 business owners (hardly a scientific survey, but it was telling). Only a couple of 
them had heard of free, open source programs such as GIMP or OpenOffice. Most of them didn’t know that 
there is a large assortment of free software programs available that could potentially save them money. 
The savings will vary depending on the nature of the business and its software requirements. Savings can 
amount to several hundred dollars annually for solo graphic design freelancers to thousands of dollars for 
larger organizations.
Schools, teachers, and students can benefit as well. For example, if a high school operating under 
tight budget restraints can’t afford the Adobe Creative Cloud lineup for a digital arts class, there are several 
popular open source alternatives (such as GIMP and Inkscape, a vector drawing program).
A class with ten workstations (Figure 2) could save about $1,200 annually, based on Adobe’s educational 
pricing of $19.99 per month per license for installation on up to two computers. An added benefit is that the 
student can install the same free open source programs at home for homework projects, saving the student 
(or parents) a few hundred dollars annually.

■ Introduction
What’s The Difference Between Freeware and  
Open Source Software?
As the question implies, freeware and open source software are not the same. Although each type can 
usually be used free of charge, the differences lie mainly in the terms of use set by the licensing agreement.
For the purpose of this book, free means that all of the software outlined in this book can be used 
free of charge, both for personal and commercial purposes. However, free as defined by the Free Software 
Foundation and the Open Source Initiative means freedom, as in the freedom to modify the source code, 
make copies for others, and install on multiple computers, to name a few examples. In essence, the user is 
free from the restrictions imposed by the license of proprietary software.
Freeware: Generally speaking, freeware is proprietary software that can be used free of charge, but 
modifying the source code is not permitted. The terms of use regarding freeware vary from one program 
to the next. Some freeware is created by individual developers and other freeware applications are created 
by corporations. One freeware program’s license might allow you to make and distribute free copies to 
friends and coworkers, but prohibit selling them. Another might only allow you to make one backup copy, 
and prohibit any type of distribution. It’s always advisable to read the license agreement carefully before 
installing and using freeware.
Some freeware programs have limited features with the option to upgrade to a more feature-rich, paid 
version of the program. Two examples that will be discussed in Chapter 3 are Serif PagePlus and DrawPlus 
Starter Editions. Although they are not the full version programs, they may be perfect for those wanting to 
design basic printed materials or create graphic designs.
Some freeware is web-based, so there is nothing to download because it is operated using your browser. 
You don’t have to worry about installation or upgrades (but you are still bound by the terms of the license).

■ Introduction
Some software titles described in this book fall under other license types, such as the Mozilla Public 
License, MIT, or BSD. Since it’s beyond the scope of this book to describe in detail the differences of each 
license type, I suggest you go to the Open Source Initiative page at http://opensource.org/licenses. 
Essentially, the GPL is a copyleft license, which means modified works must be distributed under the 
same license terms. For instance, when someone creates a modified version of the photo editing program 
GIMP, then they must make the new version available with no restrictions under the same GPL terms. This 
ensures that free software remains free.
For a more comprehensive explanation of how the terms under the GPL work, I suggest reading the 
article by Brett Smith available on the GNU Operating System website at https://gnu.org/licenses/
quick-guide-gplv3.html. 
■
■Note  The Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative (which splintered from the FSF and 
formed in 1998) differ philosophically somewhat on how free/open source software should be promoted.
Open Source Software: Open source software is also known as free software (not to be confused with 
freeware). Most of the open source software outlined in this book falls under the terms the GPL, or General 
Public License (it’s often prefixed with the GNU to read GNU GPL). This is the most widely used free 
software license. A huge advantage this offers over proprietary software is that the software can be freely 
copied and distributed to friends and coworkers (Figure 3).

■ Introduction
The Growing Use Open Source Software in Europe
According to reports by Abhishek Prakash, the creator of the open source advocacy website named It’s 
F.O.S.S (www.itsfoss.com), there’s a trend in adopting open source solutions. A growing number of city 
governments throughout Europe have migrated away from proprietary software and embraced free and 
open source alternatives. The primary reason: savings. By switching from proprietary to open source 
alternatives, several cities in France, Italy, and other countries have enjoyed savings of millions of Euro. 
Here’s a look at several European municipalities that have benefited financially by adopting open 
source software and computer operating systems:
• 
Toulouse, France: The fourth largest city in France saved about one million Euro by 
replacing Microsoft Office with the open source office productivity suite LibreOffice. 
The migration took about 18 months, and as of July 2014 about 90% of the desktop 
computers (about 10,000 city employees) run LibreOffice. [1]
• 
Turin, Italy: This  Italian city recently opted to move from Windows XP  (which is no 
longer supported by Microsoft) to Ubuntu Linux, a free computer operating system 
(Linux systems are explored in greater depth in Chapter 10). This migration should 
result in a project savings of around 6 million Euro during a five year period. [2]
• 
Udine, Italy: Like Toulouse, Udine opted to migrate away from Microsoft Office. This 
city of 100,000 will eventually be installing OpenOffice (from which LibreOffice was 
born) on its 400 computers. The projected savings will be about 360,000 Euro. [3]
• 
Canary Islands: This Spanish autonomous territory has saved about 700,000 Euro by 
switching to open source software. [4]
One important point to keep in mind is that migrating from proprietary software to open source 
(especially on a large scale) must be done properly. It takes time to get everyone involved acclimated, and 
it is generally done gradually. In short, there must be a plan in place. Switching from Microsoft Office to 
LibreOffice on 200 workstations at once could throw the company into chaos.
The Document Foundation provides a helpful whitepaper on migrating from Microsoft Office to 
LibreOffice as a downloadable PDF at https://documentfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ 
tdf-migrationwhitepaper1.pdf.
It might not be possible to completely escape the necessity of using proprietary software on some 
workstations. For example, the owner of a medium-sized graphics design company might want to switch 
from Adobe products to open source programs. But because they exchange Adobe files with some of their 
clients, they must still use Adobe software. A careful analysis might determine that the company could do 
fine by having Adobe assigned to two, three, or four workstations, and using an open source program on 
the rest (Figure 4). That number, of course, would vary from one company to another. Another company 
might require Adobe on half the workstations, but they would still save money by using open source on the 
remaining half.

■ Introduction
Supporting Open Source Software 
Free and open source software (and much of the freeware developed by generous individuals) is available 
at no charge, but donations are a huge force in the continued development of these programs. Many 
of the people that are involved in the development of open source software work on a volunteer basis. 
I personally use open source software almost exclusively and make it a point to make fairly regular 
contributions to the developers. 
Open source can be supported in other ways as well: becoming an advocate, giving away copies, 
teaching others how to use open source programs, writing about open source, etc. People talented in writing 
computer code can contribute by helping make their favorite programs even better (Figure 5).
Figure 4.  By relegating proprietary software to the minimum number of workstations possible, open source 
can be used on the remaining workstations

xxix
■ Introduction
Figure 5.  Talented code writers contribute to open source by making good software even better
Understandably, many business owners may simply be too busy running their enterprises to become 
deeply involved in open source advocacy. You might not have time to shout about the merits of open source 
from the mountain top. However, making a donation once in a while will certainly help. It only makes sense 
to contribute to the betterment of your favorite open source programs.
Getting Support for Open Source Software
One great thing open source has going for it is that just about every program (GIMP and Inkscape are a 
couple of examples) usually has a very active community. The forums are great places to find help if you 
have trouble using a particular program. Most of the forum members are glad to help out. It’s sometimes 
easier to get help for open source programs than their proprietary counterparts. Calling technical support 
and being on hold for long periods, paying for support that doesn’t always supply the correct solution, and 
other hassles are common with proprietary software.
Some open source programs offer paid technical support, particularly if the software is designed for 
larger enterprises. However, there are usually the same avenues of free support in place, such as user forums 
and downloadable documentation.
YouTube is another great learning resource. This video-posting platform now hosts just about any kind of 
tutorial you can imagine. More often than not, you’ll be able to find good tutorials on any given software title.
■
■Note  LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) is another way to connect with open source users. There are groups for 
many (if not most) of the software programs examined in this book. Group members are very helpful, and your 
questions will usually be quickly answered.

■ Introduction
Summary
Hopefully, you are enthused about the potential savings offered by freeware and open source solutions. You’ve 
now learned the fundamental differences between the two. You’ve also been made aware of the growing trend 
of open source software in cities across Europe. Lastly, you looked at some of the ways open source can be 
supported, and how to get support for the open source programs you use (or might come to use).
Now, feel free to look around in this book for the software solutions you need. There are additional 
software titles mentioned in the Appendix of this book.

Chapter 1
Office Productivity, Note Taking, 
Accounting, and PDF Creation
Everyone in the civilized world has heard of software programs like Microsoft Word, QuickBooks, etc. 
Although the alternative software titles we’ll look at shortly have been around for years and are no secret, 
I’d venture to guess that there are many business owners who have never heard of them (or at least not 
all of them).
This chapter looks at free software alternatives to commercial programs commonly used in office 
environments. This software is used for creating letters and documents, creating PDF files, and handling 
business accounting.
Here’s a quick look at the software titles covered in this chapter:
• 
AbiWord: A basic word processing application
• 
LibreOffice: A full-featured office productivity suite for creating documents, 
spreadsheets, etc.
• 
Zim: An open source note-taking application for single users
• 
Google Keep: Google’s free note-taking application you can share and sync across 
devices
• 
GNUCash: A powerful open source accounting program
• 
Manager: An easy-to-use, free accounting program with upgrade options
• 
PDF reDirect: A handy PDF creation tool with upgrade options
All of the programs discussed in this chapter work in the Windows environment, and most work in 
Mac OS and Linux as well. The first two programs we’ll look at are alternatives to Microsoft Word and Office.
AbiWord: Simplicity in Word Processing
For those who run a small, solo business or just need a basic, easy-to-use word processing application 
instead of a full-blown office suite, AbiWord might just fill the bill.
Here are a few facts about AbiWord at a glance:

According to the AbiWord website, “AbiWord is able to read and write all industry standard document 
types, such as OpenOffice.org documents, Microsoft Word documents, WordPerfect documents, Rich Text 
Format documents, HTML web pages, and many more.” My own experience is that it usually opens simple 
Word documents without issue, but it does have some limitations.
It was able to open the Word document I created a few years ago, a simple newsletter with a 
photographic image (Figure 1-1). However, it may alter the appearance of more complex documents, such as 
those that utilize a template heavy in graphical elements. This program is a good choice for those who print 
mostly documents created in-house, and cases in which exchanging Word documents with others on a 
regular basis isn’t a requirement.

Feature Highlights
Although AbiWord is a fairly straightforward and basic program, it has most of the features you would expect 
to find in a word processing application. Here are AbiWord’s features, as described in the User’s Manual:
• 
A familiar interface
• 
Outstanding file import and export, with support for MS Word, WordPerfect,  
and more
• 
Unlimited undo and redo capacity
• 
Solid (X)HTML export, with CSS styles support
• 
Images
• 
Spelling support, with optional underlining
• 
Bullets and Lists
• 
Styles
• 
Table of Contents generation and customization through the Stylist
• 
Complete, intuitive revisions-tracking support
• 
Nested tables support, nearly unmatched in the field
• 
Mail merge
• 
Bidirectional text support
• 
Command-line and server use modes for document processing capabilities
AbiWord has a collection of templates for business letters (Figure 1-2), fax cover sheets, company 
directories, and more.

The program’s functions are accessed via the menu and toolbars clustered above the workspace 
(Figure 1-3).
Figure 1-3.  AbiWord’s easy-to-use title, menu, and toolbars
Figure 1-4.  The user’s manual for AbiWord can be found on the main website
Some people hold on to computers for many years (I fall into that camp) and use them until they just 
literally wear out. One advantage that AbiWord offers is that it is a small installation and is easy on your 
computer’s resources. If you are using an older PC that could be considered way behind the times, AbiWord is 
ideal in that it won’t bog your system down (I have it installed on an old Toshiba laptop I bought in 2004 running 
Windows XP Home edition, and it works fine). AbiWord is the default word processor bundled with some Linux 
distributions, such as Zorin Lite, which is designed as a lightweight operating system for older PCs.
AbiWord Support
AbiWord’s User’s Manual can be accessed from the main website (Figure 1-4), and should provide you with 
all you need to know about how to use this program. There are also some good tutorials on YouTube for 
added instruction.

As mentioned, this program will probably suit your needs if you need to create documents such as 
business letters, newsletters, fax cover sheets, directories, etc. and don’t need to create complex documents 
or collaborate with those who use Microsoft Word a great deal. It’s weak when it comes to exporting MS 
Word and HTML documents, so that should be taken into consideration.
LibreOffice: The Powerful Free Office Suite
Large organizations have embraced this open source software package over the past several years for good 
reason: it suits their needs and saves them a lot of money.
Here are a few facts about LibreOffice at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Microsoft Office Home and Business 2013
• 
Website: www.libreoffice.org
• 
License: MPL V2 (Mozilla Public License)
•

LibreOffice is the open source powerhouse office suite made available by the Document Foundation, 
which is a self-regulating body. It’s comprised of former leading members who were involved in the 
development of an open source office suite called OpenOffice (www.openoffice.org). Some of the 
developers of OpenOffice (because of disagreements over licensing issues) went their own way and created 
LibreOffice from the source code. The two office suites are very similar and have only minor differences.  
I chose to focus on LibreOffice for a couple of reasons: the first is because it comes bundled with many Linux 
distributions, and secondly because it’s updated more regularly than OpenOffice.
■
■Note   This full-featured suite that can create just about any kind of business document, spreadsheet, 
chart, or database you need. I use LibreOffice Writer myself on a regular basis to create most of my business 
correspondence, sales letters, charts, etc. If you have experience with the Microsoft Office Suite, learning 
LibreOffice should be fairly easy. It is compatible with Microsoft for the most part (the formatting in a complex 
MS document may appear different when opened in LibreOffice).
LibreOffice Modules
The LibreOffice suite contains the following programs:
• 
Writer: A word processing program similar to Microsoft Word.
• 
Calc: Calc is a spreadsheet program similar to Microsoft Excel.
• 
Impress: This is a multimedia presentation program similar to Microsoft Power Point.
• 
Base: A database program similar to Microsoft Access.
• 
Draw: Draw lets you add visual impact to your documents by creating anything from 
simple graphics to detailed, technical drawings.

Chapter 1 ■ Office Productivity, Note Taking, Accounting, and PDF Creation

Writer
Writer is more or less the equivalent to Microsoft Word. It is an extremely capable application that can create 
a wide array of documents. It has the essential templates for creating address labels, business cards, business 
letters, and the like. LibreOffice’s functionality can be increased by utilizing additional templates for creating 
brochures, accounting charts, etc. They are available to download from templates.libreoffice.org.
The small business magazine article shown in Figure 1-5 was written using LibreOffice without the 
aid of additional templates, so it’s easy to imagine the possibilities of what you can create by utilizing the 
templates and extensions that are available for this powerful application.
Figure 1-5.  A magazine article I created in LibreOffice

LibreOffice saves documents in its native ODF (.odt) format by default. It also allows you to save your 
document in a wide variety of formats, including Microsoft (Figure 1-6).
Figure 1-6.  LibreOffice Writer can save your work in a variety of formats
■
■Note  According to an article in InfoWorld (July 30, 2014) by Serdar Yegulalp, LibreOffice 4.3 offers more 
cross-compatibility with Microsoft Office. Although the compatibility still isn’t perfect, it seems to be catching up.
Calc
Calc is LibreOffice’s spreadsheet program and it is similar to Microsoft Excel. It is useful for managing lists, 
tracking sales, accounting, etc. In the Introduction of this book, I mentioned a survey of local business 
owners I conducted in the early stages of this book. I used Calc to store all of my information as a simple 
database (Figure 1-7).

Chapter 1 ■ Office Productivity, Note Taking, Accounting, and PDF Creation

Although I use Calc in my small business, I employ it for a great deal of personal use as well. For people 
that take a lot of prescription medications (such as my wife), it’s very useful for tracking daily medication 
dispense times and weekly dosages.
Calc’s default format is ODF Spreadsheet (.ods), but it will save your work in various formats, including 
Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP/2003 (.xls); see Figure 1-8.

Impress
Impress is the LibreOffice counterpart to Microsoft PowerPoint. This module is for assembling multimedia 
presentations. You can insert text, images, sounds, and video clips to help add impact to your presentations 
(Figure 1-9). Like PowerPoint, Impress offers a choice of layouts, slide transitions effects, styles, formatting 
options, and themes.

Base
Base is the full-featured, front-end database module of LibreOffice. It integrates with the other 
LibreOffice applications. According to the LibreOffice website, Base provides new users with wizards to 
assist in database design, and to help create tables, queries, forms, and reports (Figure 1-10). Base has 
predefined table definitions for tracking assets, customers and clients, sales orders, invoices, and many 
other useful items.

Draw
The Draw module lets you create and add graphical elements to your documents, and create flowcharts, 
technical drawings, and sketches. It’s easy to use and extremely useful for creating graphics to add visual 
impact to your documents. (Figure 1-11). Draw offers a number of options for shapes, free-form drawing, 
gradients and fill colors, call-outs, etc.
Figure 1-10.  Base provides a wizard to help new users get started

■
■Note   All of the modules and features described in LibreOffice also reside in OpenOffice. Although there are 
a few minor differences between the two office suites, they are almost identical in most respects. It’s likely that 
updates for LibreOffice will be rolled out on a more regular basis. However, a disadvantage is that it still does 
not support Android and iOS development.
LibreOffice Support
LibreOffice is rapidly becoming more popular, so support for the productivity suite will likely increase as 
time goes on. The first and best place to look for assistance is on the Get Help page of the LibreOffice.org 
website. There are also numerous YouTube tutorials that are very helpful, as well as discussion platforms 
such as LibreOfficeForum.org (described as the unofficial LibreOffice support forum).

Zim: Open Source Note-Taking Application
Zim is an application for taking notes, creating journals and to-do lists, inserting images and links to 
websites, and adding documents in the form of wiki pages.
Here are a few facts about Zim at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Microsoft OneNote 2013
• 
Website: www.zim-wiki.org
• 
License: GPL
• 
Current Version: Unspecified
• 
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
• 
Potential Savings: $69.99 per license (OneNote is free for Windows 8)
Zim is a nice organizational tool (something like a digital planner/notebook). It’s not as fully outfitted as 
MS OneNote or Evernote, but if you work primarily from one computer, it will help you keep track of notes, 
images, and just about anything in your work or personal life (Figure 1-12).
Figure 1-12.  Zim is a very useful organizational tool for keeping track of notes, images, and links. (Used with 
permission © Jaap G Karssenberg 2015)
One especially nice feature of this program is that it saves your work on the fly; there’s no need to 
remember to save before closing the program when you’re finished.
Zim uses plain text; there’s no selection of fonts available but you can make text strong (bold), add 
italics (emphasis), mark (highlight), and strike (Figure 1-13).

Chapter 1 ■ Office Productivity, Note Taking, Accounting, and PDF Creation
14
Zim allows you to add new pages and subpages, and open new notebooks. This is very helpful for 
keeping notes organized into specific categories (Figure 1-14).

Zim Support
There is a detailed user manual that accompanies this program located in the Help section, as well as the 
website (Figure 1-15). The manual covers just about everything related to using Zim. There are also a few 
YouTube videos that give quick and helpful overviews of this program.
Figure 1-15.  The Zim Manual is located in the Help section
■
■Note  The user documentation (http://zim-wiki.org/manual/Start.html) states that Zim does have 
limited collaboration capabilities (such as putting a notebook on a shared drive), but it is primarily a single-user 
application.
Google Keep: Create, Sync, and Share Notes
Google Keep is a free note-taking application available for Gmail account holders (and if you don’t have one, 
it’s easy and free to sign up for one). A great feature about Google Keep is that it syncs across your devices, so 
you can access your notes from anywhere.

Here are a few facts about Google Keep at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Microsoft OneNote 2013
• 
Website: www.keep.google.com
• 
License: Proprietary Freeware
• 
Current Version: Not Specified
• 
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Mobile Devices
• 
Potential Savings: $69.99 per license (OneNote is free for Windows 8)
Google Keep stores notes in a “sticky note” fashion, in either a grid view or a list view (Figure 1-16). 
While Google Keep isn’t in the same league as MS OneNote, it can be a very useful application for the 
small business.
Figure 1-16.  Google Keep stores notes in a grid view or list view (shown)
Feature Highlights
Google Keep has several features that make this application very useful. Personally, I’ve never been good 
with the traditional paper-and-pen type planner; I forget to write down an important note, misplace my 
planer, etc. Since I’ve been using Google Keep, I stay more organized and orderly.

Chapter 1 ■ Office Productivity, Note Taking, Accounting, and PDF Creation
17
Here are some of the handy features it offers:
• 
Remind Me: You will receive a reminder to take action on your note.
• 
Share: You can share your notes and collaborate with other Gmail account holders.
• 
Color: You can change the color of the note, which is great for color coding or 
assigning degrees of priority.
• 
Archive: You can store your note for safekeeping in case you ever need to refer  
back to it.
• 
Delete/Copy: You can delete your note when it’s no longer needed, or you can make 
a copy of it.
Another handy feature is the New List option that puts a checkbox by each list item. When the box is 
checked, the list item is crossed off (Figure 1-17).
Figure 1-17.  A To Do list created using Google Keep. When items are checked, they are automatically crossed 
off the list
Google Keep Support
Google Keep is a very easy application to learn and put to use right away. However, there are a number of 
YouTube videos that provide an overview of the program, as well as tutorials on how to use it for project 
management, organizing your business, etc.
■
■Note   If you have privacy concerns about your notes being “in the cloud,” then you might want to take a 
look at the web-based note taking application called www.protectedtext.com. According to the website, it is 
the safest site on the Web for storing text. The downside is that taking notes is rudimentary. It uses only plain, 
no-frills text. There are no options for various fonts, checkboxes, or even bullet lists but, like Google Keep, you 
can access your notes from anywhere.

Feature Highlights
GnuCash is a powerful and robust accounting program. It may be a little intimidating to people with little or 
no experience with accounting software. However, if you’ve had experience with programs like QuickBooks 
Pro, the learning curve shouldn’t be quite as steep.
Here are some of the feature highlights listed on the website:
• 
Double-entry accounting
• 
Stock/bond/mutual fund accounts
• 
Small business accounting
• 
Reports, graphs
•

accounting program that a small business can appreciate. It states on the website that in addition to being 
used by businesses and accountants, it is used by educators to teach accounting principles. Although the 
desktop version of Manager is free, the cloud and server editions are available by paid subscription.
Here are a few facts about Manager at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: QuickBooks Pro
• 
Website: www.manager.io
• 
License: Proprietary Freeware (for desktop version)
• 
Current Version: 15.0.3
• 
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
• 
Potential Savings: $229.99 per license (compared to the QuickBooks Pro perpetual 
license)
I actually started using this software some time back when I installed Ubuntu on my old Dell desktop 
computer that was running Windows XP. I found it easier to use than the old accounting software (Book 
Keeper) I had been using since 2006. Manager has many features, as is apparent in Table 1-1, but is still easy 
enough for non-accountant types such as myself.

The Manager Guides on the website provides comprehensive, easy-to-follow instructions on getting 
started and using this software.
Manager prides itself on using a simple, clean interface that’s easy to navigate. If you are well 
acquainted with bookkeeping, the learning curve for this program should be low enough to jump  
right in.
Setting up an accounting entity in Manager is made easy by using the Add Business tab (Figure 1-21).

Manager doesn’t require the financial year starting date to add your business name. Simply choose the 
Create New Business option. You’ll be prompted to type in your business name, and the add it. You can add 
additional accounting entities if you operate multiple businesses.
After naming your business, you can customize certain parameters, such as adding employee 
information, creating sales orders and invoices, and so on (Figure 1-22).

Manager allows you to e-mail invoices to clients, print them on paper, or save them as PDF files by 
using the Print function to output to a PDF creation application such as Foxit Reader or PDF Redirect 
(Figure 1-23).

You can back up your accounting data as a Manager database (*.manager) file and indicate where you 
would like to save it. In my case, I created a folder on the desktop and named it Manager Accounting Backup 
(Figure 1-24). After I back up my work (which should be done regularly), I then copy it to a thumbnail drive.

Manager Support
The supporting documentation Manager Guides on the website provide comprehensive, easy-to-follow 
instructions on getting started and using this software (Figure 1-25). Even though you may find Manager an easier 
program to use than GnuCash, it is still be a good idea to take some time to read through this documentation.

PDF reDirect: Basic PDF Creation Freeware
PDF reDirect is an excellent free program for creating PDF files. It has always been a very useful tool in my 
work. It is used to convert documents (such as those created in MS Word or LibreOffice) into PDF files.  
The professional version has more features and offers a free 90-day trial; then it costs $19.99 with free 
lifetime upgrades.
Here are a few facts about PDF reDirect at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Adobe Acrobat
• 
Website: www.expsystems.com
• 
License: Proprietary Freeware
• 
Current Version: 2.5.2
• 
Operating Systems: Windows
• 
Potential Savings: $19.99 per month subscription (compared to Adobe Acrobat)
If you need to create PDF files from existing documents but don’t need all of the abilities contained 
within a full-fledged program like Adobe Acrobat, then PDF reDirect is really worth trying. When you’re 
ready to convert your document into a PDF, just use the Print command and click PDF reDirect in the Printer 
options (Figure 1-27). One downside to this program is that it’s only available for Windows.

Summary
In this chapter, you looked at some useful free and free open source office productivity solutions. AbiWord is 
an easy-to-use alternative to Microsoft Word, and LibreOffice is a powerful open source suite that is growing 
in popularity (some city governments throughout Europe are switching from Microsoft to LibreOffice to save 
a large sum of money on licensing fees).
You learned about two free note-taking applications: Zim and Google Keep. While Zim is a great for use 
on a single computer, Google Keep lets you access your notes from any device. Google Keep requires that 
you set up a Gmail account, but it is easy and free.
GnuCash and Manager are two options for free accounting software. While GnuCash is a very robust 
program, it can be a little intimidating for those with little or no experience using accounting software. 
Manager is a full-featured yet easy-to-use, free accounting program that (according to the software 
provider’s website) is used by students to learn accounting principles and by small businesses.
PDF reDirect is a useful Windows-based program for converting documents into PDF files. If you don’t 
need all of the features of Adobe Acrobat, this handy, free application might just serve you well.
The next chapter looks at no-cost solutions for point-of-sale, customer relationship management, 
backup software, and compression software.

Chapter 2

Imonggo is an ideal cloud-based freeware solution for the small one- or two-person shop that keeps less 
than 1,000 different products, and processes no more than 1,000 transactions per month. For larger shops or 
stores, Imonggo offers several paid options with more features.

Operating Systems: Cross-platform
• 
Potential Savings: $69.00 per month
To use Imonggo, the first thing to do is to set up an account (the free version does not require a credit 
card or banking information). After your account is set up, you can input your product information into the 
Imonggo Store, such as a product picture, stock number, bar code if applicable, inventory count, etc.
Imonggo works with most major browsers, including the latest versions of Windows Internet Explorer, 
Google Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and Mozilla Firefox. JavaScript and cookies must be enabled.
Feature Highlights
The free version of Imonggo offers a lot for the small shop, kiosk, or boutique. Here’s a quick rundown:
• 
Product pictures supported
• 
Customizable receipts: You can add your company logo and business information
• 
Create up to 1,000 products
• 
Generate up to 1,000 transaction lines per month
For illustrative purposes, I set up a fictitious earring boutique. The Imonggo Stockroom is where new 
products are created. Figure 2-1 demonstrates the product setup of a pair of gold hoop-style earrings with all 
of the relevant information.

Creating a sales transaction is handled in the Imonggo Store. You can input the customer’s name, plus 
any relevant information in the Remark box of the invoice (Figure 2-2).

■Note   Collecting customer information in the Remark box can be very helpful for creating customized 
marketing. Of course, Customer Relationship Management software is better suited for that purpose.

Chapter 2 ■ Point-of-Sale, CRM, Backup, and Compression Software
34
In the Imonggo Office (Figure 2-4), you can handle tasks such as re-printing invoices, running sales 
reports, viewing customer information, and customizing invoices (the functions are limited in the free 
version of Imonggo).

When receiving payment for an item, you can select the payment type: cash, credit card, debit card, gift 
certificate, or other (Figure 2-3). After the transaction is complete, an invoice can be printed.

Imonggo Support
Imonggo is very easy and intuitive to use, and the website offers a great deal of support. After setting up your 
account, it’s a good idea to look at the Imonggo Video Tutorial Library. The tutorials should cover just about 
any area, but if you need further assistance, the support team can be contacted via e-mail; just click the 
Support tab to access the form (Figure 2-5).

POS/Cash Register: Turn Your Old PC Into a Cash Register
Cash registers can cost several hundred dollars each. The paid commercial software for running computers 
as cash registers can be expensive as well, depending on its capabilities. POS/Cash Register is a free software 
program made available from Dale Harris Educational Software (and it is permitted for commercial use) 
that turns an older PC running DOS or Windows into a cash register. It’s a DOS program, and does requires a 
little time to set up after installation. There are detailed instructions on the website, and once the program is 
installed and running, it’s a viable way to put older computers to good use and save money in the bargain.
Here are a few facts about POS/Cash Register at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Copper POS Software (NCH Software)
• 
Website: keyhut.com/pos.htm
•

Cash Register can be installed on single PCs or on networks. Figure 2-6 shows the POS/Cash Register 
launch screen.
Figure 2-6.  The POS/Cash Register launch screen (Used with permission © Dale Harris 2015)
Feature Highlights
POS/Cash Register is simple yet powerful. It offers a lot for a free program, and it has many fans, judging by 
the list of companies that use this software on the software provider’s website. Here’s a look at the features 
offered by this program:
• 
Works on older computers running DOS and Windows as far back as Version 3.1
• 
Prints receipts on almost any printer (inkjet, laser, or specialized cash register receipt 
printer)
• 
Works with keyboard wedge scanners or USB scanners
• 
Keeps track of up to 26,000 different items
• 
Provides functions such as reservation and table management for any business in 
the food service industry
• 
Keeps track of sales of up to 56 different employees
• 
Records a journal of all transactions on disk as a text file
■
■Note   Although this software doesn’t directly support USB printers (such as common inkjet printers), 
there is a work-around solution. It’s possible to configure them to work using the APRINT6.EXE file  
included in the software download. The detailed instructions on how to accomplish this are at  
http://keyhut.com/postip4.htm#program.

Chapter 2 ■ Point-of-Sale, CRM, Backup, and Compression Software
37
After the software has been installed, it will need to be configured by entering product categories, 
setting up tax rates, stock table, how to print, etc. Launching the Pos Config (Figure 2-7) program allows you 
to make the necessary configurations so you can use the POS/Cash Register software to ring up sales.
Figure 2-7.  The Pos Config program is for inputting the parameters needed to use POS/Cash Register.  
(Used with permission © Dale Harris 2015)
As an option, this program keeps a journal of the daily transactions (including openings, closings, voids, 
etc.) on the disk as a text file. As the software’s developer, Mr. Harris, points out on his website, “You may be 
legally required to make and store a journal of your register transactions. In addition it is a really good idea. 
The journal is your record of what was going on in your store. Was your register closed out at mid-day? Was 
that large void total from one transaction or many? How about all those refunds? Your journal will give you 
those answers.” I can further attest to this from my own many years of experience in retail, prior to going into 
business for myself in 2000.
The journal can be configured to clear and reset at the beginning of each day (just make sure you’ve 
printed or archived the previous day’s journal) or to keep a record of transactions on an ongoing basis. When 
needed, the journal can be placed into a Word processing program (such as LibrOffice or OpenOffice) and 
printed out (Figure 2-8).

POS/Cash Register Support
If you have experience in working with DOS-based POS systems, you’ll probably be able to use this software 
with relative ease. If it seems overwhelming, take the time to read over the website carefully, particularly the 
FAQ page and the the online User’s Manual (http://keyhut.com/posmenu.htm).

■
■Note   Collecting significant dates is important for maintaining a good business relationship with your 
customers, and it is an important element of CRM. When you reach out to your customer with an appropriate 
birthday or anniversary card (or any meaningful event), it has a lot of impact.
Starting and managing projects is another vital feature of Insightly (Figure 2-12). Using this function, the 
project’s details are listed, starting and finishing times are assigned, and links can be added. The status of  
the project can be changed any time.
When adding contacts, you can include all of the pertinent information such as e-mail addresses, phone 
numbers, websites, and other forms of contact information. Additional information, such as important dates 
(birthdays, anniversaries, etc.) can also be added (Figure 2-11).

Insightly Support
Insightly has an ample system of learning support in the form of an FAQ page and a library of tutorial videos 
(Figure 2-13). Because Insightly seems to be quite popular, there is no shortage of useful videos on YouTube.

There are times when you need to transport large files and folders from one place to another. When 
they contain a lot of data, 7Zip is a handy tool for file compression that handles several formats, making 
the task a bit easier.
Feature Highlights
There is a detailed list of 7Zip’s features on the website, but here is a slightly abridged version:
• 
High compression ratio in the 7Z format
• 
Some of the supported formats for packing/unpacking are 7Z, XZ, BZIP2, GZIP, TAR, 
ZIP and WIM.
• 
Unpacks a wide variety of formats
• 
For ZIP and GZIP formats, 7-Zip provides a compression ratio that is 2-10 % better 
than the ratio provided by PKZip and WinZip.
• 
Strong AES-256 encryption in 7z and ZIP formats
• 
Self-extracting capability for 7z format
• 
Integration with Windows Shell
• 
Powerful File Manager
For example, 7Zip offers the ability to compress layered Photoshop (.PSD) or GIMP (.XCF) files.  
In Figure 2-23, you can see a folder that contains several layered GIMP .XCF files that total just over 92MB. 
As more and more folders containing layered images accumulate over time, they eventually take up lots of 
valuable hard drive space.

Chapter 2 ■ Point-of-Sale, CRM, Backup, and Compression Software
54
Creating a compressed .ZIP folder is a matter of right-clicking the folder, navigating to 7Zip, and 
selecting the Add to archive option (Figure 2-24).

Pavlov 2015)

Chapter 2 ■ Point-of-Sale, CRM, Backup, and Compression Software
55
A dialog box opens with numerous options such as Archive format, compression level, and compression 
method, to name a few (Figure 2-25). There is also an option to encrypt the file, requiring a password to open.

7Zip Support
The website has a support page (Figure 2-27) with a keyword search feature that lists the related topics in 
the 7Zip Forum. The FAQ page is quite helpful. There are also a handful of instructional videos on YouTube, 
most of which cover the installation of 7Zip.
Figure 2-26.  The Add to Archive dialog box (Used with permission © Igor Pavlov 2015)
A zipped folder containing the layered GIMP .XCF files is created, and at just over 45MB, it is less than 
half the size of the original folder (Figure 2-26).

There is also a two-page PDF User Guide that can be downloaded from  
www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_172585_en.pdf.
Summary
This chapter looked at two no-cost, point-of-sale systems. Imonggo’s free version is ideal for the small shop 
or boutique, and POS/Cash Register is a DOS software program that can turn old PCs into functioning cash 
registers. Additional free POS systems are briefly looked at in the “Additional Software Titles” section of  
the Appendix.
Next, you looked at two free customer relationship management systems. Insightly is an easy-to-use 
system for up to two users (great for small start-ups). Bitrix24 is a CRM intranet system designed to function 
like a social media platform; free for up to 12 users, it helps colleagues collaborate on projects, coordinate 
meetings, and stay connected.
Lastly, you learned about two free Windows programs for data backup and archival needs. Fbackup is a 
free program for backing up important data, and 7Zip is a compression tool for file and folder archives that 
saves in several file formats, including the .zip format.
In the next chapter, you’ll look at several free solutions for desktop publishing, vector drawing/
illustration, and 3D rendering.

Desktop Publishing, Illustration, 
Painting, and 3D Modeling 
Software
Imagine the local print shop quotes you twice the amount you envisioned spending on the marketing 
materials you plan to use to announce your Grand Opening. Having marketing materials such as brochures, 
business cards, and flyers designed (the expensive part of the process) and printed can cut into the budget. 
As a business owner, wouldn’t it be nice to have the means to create your own marketing materials without 
breaking the bank? This chapter looks at a two free desktop publishing solutions that can aid in creating your 
own marketing materials (such as postcards, brochures, and newsletters). If you don’t need (or want) to go 
the route of Adobe InDesign, Microsoft Publisher, or QuarkXpress, these solutions can be perfect for small 
businesses with tight marketing budgets.
For creating graphic designs, there are no-cost solutions for vector illustrations and digital artwork. For 
the budget-minded engineer and animator, two 3D modeling programs are covered here.
Here’s a quick look at the programs covered in this chapter:
• 
Serif PagePlus Starter Edition: A desktop publishing program that’s limited in 
function, but easy to use
• 
Scribus: A powerful, professional-level, open source desktop publishing program for 
creating anything from business cards to magazines
• 
Serif DrawPlus Starter Edition: A illustration program with limited functionality but 
is quite ideal for creating quick graphic designs
• 
Inkscape: A powerful, professional-level vector graphics creation tool capable of 
stunning illustrations
• 
Krita: A drawing and painting program for creating beautiful digital artwork
• 
FreeCAD: A powerful program for rendering 3D designs of everything from small 
machine parts to architecture
• 
Blender: A very powerful (and complex) open source program for creating stunning 
3D animations

Serif PagePlus Starter Edition: A Free, Easy-to-Use  
Desktop Publishing Program
Serif is a U.K.-based developer of inexpensive but very capable design software solutions. PagePlus Starter 
Edition is a free, slimmed down version of Serif’s paid, full version of PagePlus (now in version X8), a desktop 
publishing program similar to Adobe InDesign. This starter edition lacks some of the advanced features, but 
if you are looking for a program to create brochures, postcards, and flyers with relative ease, then this might 
just be what you need.
Here are a few facts about Serif PagePlus SE at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Adobe InDesign, Microsoft Publisher
• 
Website: www.serif.com
• 
License: Proprietary Freeware
• 
Operating Systems: Windows
• 
Potential Savings: $19.99 per month (Adobe InDesign CC subscription)
The program can be downloaded from the Free Downloads page of the website. You’ll be prompted 
to set up an account with Serif by submitting your e-mail and creating a password (you won’t be required 
to submit any financial information). Serif will furnish a product key number by e-mail that is required for 
installing the software (so make sure you keep it in a safe place).
Feature Highlights
Here’s the quick run-down of the PagePlus features as they’re listed on the website:
• 
Stunning stationery is so simple
• 
Easy drag-and-drop designing
• 
Layouts in a couple of clicks
• 
Precise and easy design tools
• 
Versatile desktop publishing
• 
Help is always on hand
Design Capabilities
PagePlus SE employs an number of predesigned theme layouts (Figure 3-1) that make document creation 
easy, although you can create documents from scratch if you wish. The themes are a distinct advantage for 
business owners who want to create marketing materials but lack previous page layout experience.

Chapter 3 ■ Desktop Publishing, Illustration, Painting, and 3D Modeling Software
61
In addition to theme layouts, PagePlus SE offers a limited selection of images such as photos and clip 
art. The postcard in Figure 3-2 was created in a matter of less than five minutes or so (choosing the font was 
the longest part of the process). The fonts menu will display the font in real time.
Figure 3-1.  Theme layouts in PagePlus SE make document creation fast and easy

Chapter 3 ■ Desktop Publishing, Illustration, Painting, and 3D Modeling Software
62
With PagePlus SE, there are a few limitations worth noting: documents are limited to a maximum of five 
pages, exporting to PDF is disabled (although installing a program like PDF Redirect will work around that), 
and there are no color management features, image editing tools, or advanced text-handling abilities.
■
■Note  Serif Starter Edition programs do not indicate which features are disabled. When you try to access 
them, an upgrade offer window for the full version of the program will pop up. Some users will undoubtedly find 
this annoying, but you can simply close the window and continue working.
PagePlus SE Support
There are quite a few video tutorials on YouTube and Serif’s website. These videos apply to the full version 
of PagePlus, but they will help get you up and running with the Starter Edition in no time. You can also post 
questions in Serif’s Community Plus forum.

Scribus: The Powerful, Professional, Open Source  
Desktop Publishing Program
Scribus is an extremely capable program, but it has a steep learning curve for beginners. It was originally 
written for Linux, but is currently available for Mac OS X, OS2, and Windows. If you have experience with 
desktop publishing software such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXpress, Scribus should be relatively easy to 
learn, but it does differ in some respects to these programs.
Here are a few facts about Scribus at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Adobe InDesign, QuarkXpress
• 
Website: wiki.scribus.net
• 
License: GPL
• 
Current Version: 1.4.5
• 
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
• 
Potential Savings: $19.99 per month (Adobe InDesign CC subscription)
Scribus can help you create impressive documents, everything from business cards to magazines. GIMP 
Magazine is a great example, as mentioned in the Introduction. I use Scribus for creating my own marketing 
materials, such as two-panel pamphlets and flyers. Figure 3-3 shows a sample of the inside pages of a 
pamphlet I designed back in 2011 using Scribus.
Figure 3-3.  The inside pages of a pamphlet I designed using Scribus

Chapter 3 ■ Desktop Publishing, Illustration, Painting, and 3D Modeling Software

Emulation of color blindness
Design Capabilities
Scribus is a pro-class application that allows the user to design documents (mainly) from scratch. Upon 
launch, you’ll be presented with a dialog box to select the document type, page size, orientation, etc. 
Documents are created in Scribus by using frames for text and images (Figure 3-4); there are also design 
elements such as shapes and tools for creating vector-based images.
Figure 3-4.  Scribus employs text and image frames for designing documents

Chapter 3 ■ Desktop Publishing, Illustration, Painting, and 3D Modeling Software
65
■
■Note  Prior to installing Scribus, it’s a good idea to install Ghostscript (an interpreter for PostScript and 
Encapsulated PostScript files) from www.ghostscript.com. Although Scribus might work just fine without it, it is 
necessary to import EPS files and for the Print Preview to function.
For those that prefer not to build documents from the ground up, there are a wide variety of 
predesigned templates available from www.scribusstuff.org, all of which are free to use under the General 
Public License. There are templates for folded brochures, stationery, business newsletters, birthday cards, 
invitations, and more. There are also fonts available for download from the same website.
Another source for free Scribus templates available for download is www.myshopsigns.com. There you’ll 
find a variety of printable sign templates similar to the ones shown in Figure 3-5 that are useful for small 
shops and retail outlets.
Scribus Support
Scribus is very popular, and there is a wealth of support for it. The User Manual on the official website will 
take you completely through the functionality of this program. There are quite a few video tutorials on 
YouTube that can help get you up and running.
If you are new to desktop publishing and really want to sink your teeth into it using Scribus,  
I recommend studying the Design page of the Scribus website (http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/
Category:Design). You’ll learn how to avoid design problems, as well as the basics of good design, 
typography, and various page layout concepts (Figure 3-6).

Although some of the advanced features are disabled (and the program doesn’t indicate which ones are until 
you try to use them), there are still plenty of tools for creating graphics and illustrations:
• 
Pen tool for drawing Bezier curves
• 
Paint Brush tool
• 
Pencil tool
• 
QuickShapes
Graphics Creation
DrawPlus SE is quite a capable program for being a free version, although advanced graphic designers will 
probably find it somewhat underpowered. However, despite its limitations it can still produce very good 
work. In addition to creating basic geometric shapes and QuickShapes, it has a Paint Brush Tool, and you 
can create free-hand shapes using the Pen tool (Figure 3-8).
Figure 3-7.  An illustration I created was easily rendered in Serif DrawPlus SE

As with PagePlus SE, you’ll find a number of video tutorials on YouTube and the Serif website. The majority 
of the tutorials apply to the full version of DrawPlus. DrawPlus users also help one another by sharing tips 
and solutions on the Serif CommunityPlus forum.
Inkscape: Pro-Quality Open Source Vector  
Drawing Software
Inkscape is a powerful (and popular) vector-based drawing program used for creating scalable graphics. It’s 
used by illustrators, designers, and web designers.

Feature Highlights
Inkscape offers many features one would expect from a full-featured illustration program such as the 
following:
• 
Flexible drawing tools
• 
Broad file format compatibility
• 
Powerful Text tool
• 
Bezier and Spiro curves
The detailed features are too numerous to list here (it would probably take a couple of pages of this 
book), but they are listed on the website. After clicking the Features button, you’ll be prompted to click the 
Explore button similar to the example in Figure 3-10, which will take you to the list of features. One minor 
disadvantage of Inkscape that should be mentioned is that the floating Tools palette can’t be reconfigured.
Graphics Creation
Inkscape offers a high degree of control over the elements (called objects in Inkscape) used to create your 
work. In the hands of a good designer or illustrator, Inkscape is capable of rendering very detailed and 
realistic drawings. In Figure 3-11, the billiard is comprised of objects such as circles and ellipses. The Fill and 
Stroke dialog allows you to control the type of fill (solid color, gradient, etc.). Objects can be blurred, and the 
degree of opacity controlled. I was able to create reasonably realistic highlights reflecting from the ball, as 
well as a shadow underneath.
Figure 3-10.  Click the Explore button on the Inkscape navigate to the Features page

Chapter 3 ■ Desktop Publishing, Illustration, Painting, and 3D Modeling Software
71
■
■Note  Inkscape can be demanding of your computer’s resources, so the more RAM and processing power 
your machine has, the better.
It’s possible to add realism to objects by applying various filters to them. Inkscape offers a wide variety, 
many of which add a 3D look. The examples in Figure 3-12 are just a few of the many available in Inkscape.
Figure 3-11.  Objects that comprise illustrations can be edited for added realism

Chapter 3 ■ Desktop Publishing, Illustration, Painting, and 3D Modeling Software

■
■Note  Inkscape’s native file format is the Inkscape SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format, but it is capable 
of exporting your work in a number of other file formats.
Inkscape Support
Inkscape’s FAQ page on the official website is a great place to start. There are a few books available on 
Amazon geared towards the beginner. There are tons of video tutorials on YouTube, which can be very useful 
for the beginner. The vibrant Inkscape Community can also be a valuable resource for learning this powerful 
program. The PDF of the Inkscape User Manual can be downloaded from www.valo-cd.net/guides/
flossmanuals-inkscape.pdf.

■Note  In addition to Krita, there are other free drawing applications worth evaluating. Appendix B covers 
MyPaint and Sumo Paint.
FreeCAD: Open Source Parametric 3D Modeling Software
FreeCAD is a popular open source program for rendering 2D and 3D drawings, and it is particularly useful 
for mechanical design. FreeCAD has been around for a while, but is constantly evolving thanks to an  
active community of developers. Although it’s not in the same league as the commercial counterparts  
(such as AutoCAD), it still offers a ton of features and is suitable for commercial use.
Figure 3-16.  The Learn page on the Krita website is a good place to learn the basics

Here are a few facts about FreeCAD at a glance:
Alternative to: Autodesk AutoCAD
Website: www.freecadweb.org
License: GPL
Current Version: 0.15
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
Potential Savings: $140.00-160.00 per month (Autodesk AutoCAD subscription)
FreeCAD is capable of rendering 3D models for those involved in mechanical drawing, engineering, or 
even students studying computer-aided design. It can render everything from simple parts (Figure 3-17)  
to highly detailed systems.
■
■Note  Aspiring engineers or small start-up firms could potentially save thousands of dollars annually 
by using FreeCAD. Even if a firm requires a commercial application like AutoCAD on one or two computers, 
installing FreeCAD on the remaining computers could result in huge savings overall on licensing fees.
Figure 3-17.  A machine part rendered in FreeCAD

Chapter 3 ■ Desktop Publishing, Illustration, Painting, and 3D Modeling Software
79
Feature Highlights
FreeCAD has a long list of features, which can be explored in depth on the website on the Features list page. 
Here’s a quick rundown of some of them:
• 
A full parametric model: Changes can be recalculated as needed while work is in 
progress.
• 
Modular architecture: The core application’s functionality can be expanded with 
plug-ins.
• 
Sketcher mode: This allows sketching 2D geometry with constraint-solving capabilities.
• 
A Robot module: This allows the study of robot movements.
• 
An Architecture module: This allows a BIM (Building Information Modeling)  
type workflow.
• 
Drawing sheets: This allows you to put 2D views of your 3D models on a sheet.
A particularly useful feature of FreeCAD is a concept in which tools are grouped by workbenches 
(Figure 3-18). This allows only the tools needed for a specific task to be displayed. The workspace stays 
uncluttered and helps the program to load faster.

FreeCAD Support
Support for FreeCAD is a good news/bad news proposition: there is a lot of support for this program, but the 
majority of it isn’t very beginner friendly. It might be a bit overwhelming for anyone without any mechanical 
drawing or engineering experience. If you have previous experience with CAD programs, the learning curve 
for FreeCAD should be relatively low. The website provides a great deal of information, and the Forum can 
be helpful for those times you get stuck.
As is the case with the other software described in this book, there are a number of YouTube tutorials 
that can be essential for anyone coming to grips with FreeCAD.
Blender: The Ultimate Open Source 3D Creation Software
Blender is a free and open source professional 3D creation application. Like FreeCAD, Blender can create 3D 
renderings. The primary difference is that Blender is geared mainly toward animation creation for motion 
pictures and gaming (but it is used for other purposes).
Here are a few facts about Blender at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Autodesk Maya
• 
Website: www.blender.org
• 
License: GPL
• 
Current Version: 2.74
• 
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
• 
Potential Savings: $185.00 per month (Autodesk Maya subscription)
Blender is a very popular software program in the world of 3D animation. In fact, it’s so powerful and 
feature-packed that it’s hard to believe that it is a free program. It’s been used to make several animated 
motion pictures, and it is a very robust program. It is capable of rendering water simulations, textures, and 
other materials with incredible realism. The screenshot from the Features page of the Blender website 
(Figure 3-20) shows two examples of work created in Blender.
■
■Note  There have been several animated motion pictures created using Blender. The one entitled Big Buck 
Bunny (2008) is a short animated film featuring Liam Neeson and voice-over actor Frank Welker.

FreeCAD and Blender are two complex and powerful open source programs design for 3D model 
creation. FreeCAD is used primarily for mechanical drawing, architecture, and engineering. Blender is 
mainly used for creating 3D animations for motion pictures and game creation, although it can be used for 
other purposes.
The next chapter will look at several no-cost photo editing programs. The programs range from easy-to-
use, entry level programs to advanced, professional-level programs.

Photo Editing Software
When you think of photo editing, Adobe Photoshop probably springs to mind. It is the industry standard 
and the ultimate in photo editing software. There are many professionals who use Adobe products because 
they are involved with very high-end print production, photography, or just locked into an Adobe work flow. 
However, for many small business owners, freelance photographers, and designers, Photoshop is either too 
expensive (even at $19.99 per month for the subscription service), people don’t like the idea of “renting” 
software, or it’s just overkill.
Since digital photography has become mainstream, the ability to work with digital images is an 
important aspect for most businesses. Fortunately, there are many no-cost photo editing programs to help 
you get best out of your digital photos. This chapter looks at several photo editing programs, ranging from 
simple (applying effects automatically) to professional level (with a wide range of editing capabilities).
Here’s a quick look at the programs we’ll cover in this chapter:
• 
PhotoScape: An entry-level photo editing tool that offers minor, easy photo 
corrections and a wealth of special effects filters
• 
Paint.NET: A lightweight yet powerful photo editor for Windows with graphics 
creation capability
• 
GIMP: A professional photo editing and graphics creation program almost in the 
same league as Adobe Photoshop
• 
Autodesk Pixlr: A family of cloud-based and mobile applications for photo editing 
and adding special effects
• 
UFRaw: A program for processing RAW images (RAW is the uncompressed format 
used by many higher-end cameras)
• 
FotoSketcher: A program that automatically creates art from photographic images

Feature Highlights
Even though PhotoScape could be considered an entry-level editing application (it only has a few editing 
tools compared to other programs), it does offer many useful functions.
Here are PhotoScape’s features as listed on the software provider’s website:
• 
Viewer: View photos in your folder, create a slideshow
• 
Editor: Resizing, brightness and color adjustment, white balance, backlight 
correction, frames, balloons, mosaic mode, adding text, drawing pictures, cropping, 
filters, red eye removal, blooming, paint brush, clone stamp, effect brush

Tools
PhotoScape has a basic toolset for performing minor retouching tasks and applying effects. One of the more 
useful tools is the Clone Stamp tool. It is used for removing defects and unwanted objects, or for duplicating 
certain parts of the image. I used it to remove the plastic pail behind the dog (Figure 4-2).

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
90
The Effect Brush is another useful tool. It can lighten or darken portions of an image (much like the 
dodge and burn tools in Photoshop), soften and blur areas of an image, and apply a few fun effects as well. 
The other tools are the Paint Brush, Color Picker, Mosaic, Mole Removal, and Screen Scroll.

figures, the PDF color plates can be downloaded from the book’s source code section on the Apress website.
Filters
While PhotoScape just has a basic toolset, it has a rich assortment of filters, which are functions that modify 
the appearance of an image. There are many effects that can be created using PhotoScape’s filters. There are 
filters that can modify images to look like paintings or drawings, or you can apply various tones, just to name 
a few. Filters can give images a certain look and feel. To give the image of the cowboy a look more consistent 
with the Old West, I first applied a sepia tone and then one of the Vintage Effect filters (Figure 4-3).

Objects
PhotoScape lets you have fun with your images by allowing you to add Objects to your images. The 
Objects in the Office category (Figure 4-4) are useful for enhancing images that will be used in business 
communications, such as newsletters or marketing pieces. The Christmas-themed Objects come in handy 
when making Christmas cards, holiday-themed images, etc.

Paint.NET: Basic Image Editing for Windows
Paint.NET is a popular, no-cost editing program for Windows. Although still easy enough for beginners to 
jump into and master with a little practice, it’s a step up from PhotoScape. Anyone with experience using 
commercial image editing software will have a very low learning curve using this program and will pick it up 
in no time.
Here are a few facts about Paint.NET at a glance:

Feature Highlights
Paint.NET offers an impressive array of features and functionality for a free program. The website states that 
“It is one of the fastest free photo editors for Windows, with a capable feature set that stops just short of some 
of the professional manipulation tools.”
Paint.NET has an interface that is somewhat reminiscent of Photoshop, but its unique focus is on being 
intuitive and easy to learn (Figure 4-6). Many of the functions use keyboard shortcuts that will make work 
faster and more efficient.
Figure 4-6.  The Paint.NET interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. (Used with permission © 
Rick Brewster 2015)

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
95
These are the features as described on the software provider’s website:
• 
Simple, intuitive, and innovative user interface: Every feature and user interface 
element was designed to be immediately intuitive and quickly learnable without 
assistance. In order to handle multiple images easily, Paint.NET uses a tabbed 
document interface. The tabs display a live thumbnail of the image instead of a 
text description. This makes navigation very simple and fast. The interface is also 
enhanced for Aero Glass if you are using Windows 7 or Vista.
• 
Performance: Extensive work has gone into making Paint.NET the fastest image 
editor available. Whether you have a netbook with a power-conscious Atom CPU 
or a Dual Intel Xeon workstation with eight blazingly fast processing cores, you can 
expect Paint.NET to start up quickly and be responsive to every mouse click.
• 
Layers: Usually only found on expensive or complicated professional software, layers 
form the basis for a rich image composition experience. You may think of them as a stack 
of transparency slides that, when viewed together at the same time, form one image.
• 
Active online community: Paint.NET has an online forum with a friendly, 
passionate, and ever-expanding community. Be sure to check out the constantly 
growing list of tutorials and plug-ins.
• 
Automatically updated: Updates are free, and they contain new features, 
performance improvements, and bug fixes. Upgrading to the latest version is very 
simple, requiring only two clicks of the mouse.
• 
Special effects: Many special effects are included for enhancing and perfecting your 
images. Everything from blurring, sharpening, red-eye removal, distortion, noise, 
and embossing are included. Also included is a unique 3D Rotate/Zoom effect that 
makes it very easy to add perspective and tilting. Adjustments are also included, 
which help you tweak an image’s brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, curves, and 
levels. You can also convert an image to black-and-white or sepia-toned.
• 
Powerful tools: Paint.NET includes simple tools for drawing shapes, including an 
easy-to-use Curve tool for drawing splines or Bezier curves. The Gradient tool, new 
for 3.0, has been cited as an innovative improvement over similar tools provided by 
other software. The facilities for creating and working with selections are powerful, 
yet still simple enough to be picked up quickly. Other powerful tools include the 
Magic Wand for selecting regions of similar color, and the Clone Stamp for copying 
or erasing portions of an image. There is also a simple text editor, a tool for zooming, 
and a Recolor tool.
• 
Unlimited History: Everybody makes mistakes, and everybody changes their mind. 
To accommodate this, every action you perform on an image is recorded in the 
History window and may be undone. Once you’ve undone an action, you can also 
redo it. The length of the history is only limited by available disk space.
• 
Free: Paint.NET doesn’t cost a dime!
Editing Capabilities
Paint.NET can handle a number of editing tasks ranging from simple to fairly complex. It’s great for touching 
up images, making composite images, and correcting color and exposure, to name a few. It offers several 
tools for correcting exposure and color, but the most advanced is the Curves dialog, which is used to correct 
tonal quality and color with precision (Figure 4-7). Curves is a high-end tool usually found only in more 
complex image editors.

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
96
Paint.NET has a decent assortment of editing tools (although it lacks a few, such as the Dodge and 
Burn tools). Among them is a Clone Stamp tool that is essential in many image editing tasks. Figure 4-8 
demonstrates its usefulness by digitally removing the date stamp from the upper right portion of the image.
Figure 4-7.  Correcting exposure using Curves (Used with permission © Rick Brewster 2015)

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
97
Paint.NET employs the use of layers, which allows for the placement of graphical elements without 
directly affecting the original image. The layers in Paint.NET have several blending modes to choose from. 
Blending modes determine how the layer’s pixels interact with those of the image below. Additionally, the 
opacity/transparency of each layer can be controlled. This allows the use of advanced editing techniques, 
such as adding color to a monochrome image (Figure 4-9).
Figure 4-8.  Removing the date stamp using the Clone Stamp tool(Used with permission © Rick Brewster 2015)

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
98
By using a dedicated layer for each element colorized, there is a greater degree of editing control. The 
end result is a monochrome image with a reasonably natural, hand-tinted look added (Figure 4-10).

■Note  There are quite a few useful plug-ins that are available to extend Paint.NET’s capabilities. Plug-ins are 
software add-ons written by the Paint.NET community, and information about them is available on the Forum 
section of the software provider’s website.
Graphics Creation
In addition to editing digital photos, Paint.NET is capable of creating useful graphics from the ground up. 
While it’s not in the league of more full-featured programs, it’s still powerful enough to render eye-catching 
art (Figure 4-11). There are several predesigned drawing shapes (arrows, polygons, etc.) that will aid in 
creating graphics.
Figure 4-10.  Before and after comparison

Paint.NET Support
Paint.NET’s ease of use makes it a popular program, and based on what I’ve read while perusing the forums, 
users of this program seem quite passionate about it. There is a great deal of information in the Forums section, 
including a Discussions and Questions page. YouTube also has a number of tutorials aimed at the beginner. You 
can probably learn everything you want to about this program from the information available on the Web. For 
those who want to dig even deeper, there are several books about Paint.NET available on Amazon.
GIMP: The Premier Open Source Image Editor
GIMP (which stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program) is arguably the most powerful, full-featured, 
no-cost image editing program. Currently in version 2.8, it has been around since the mid-1990s. It’s very 
popular and enjoys a huge amount of support from the open source community. It’s still not in the same 
strata as Adobe Photoshop, but it comes close enough for many users.
Here are a few facts about GIMP at a glance:

GIMP is an extremely capable image editor loaded with many high-end features normally only seen in 
expensive commercial editors. It’s used by enthusiasts and professionals worldwide. Figure 4-12 shows the 
GIMP interface on Windows 7.

Feature Highlights
GIMP offers a dazzling array of high-end features. Being the powerful program that it is, it isn’t as user 
friendly to the beginner as PhotoScape or Paint.NET. However, if you are willing to invest the time it takes to 
gain proficiency, it will handle just about any image editing task. Here are the features as described on the 
official GIMP website:

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
102
• 
Customizable Interface: Each task requires a different environment, and GIMP 
allows you to customize the view and behavior the way you like it. The widget theme 
allows you to change colors, widget spacings, and icon sizes, and there are custom 
tool sets in the toolbox. The interface is modulized into so-called docks, allowing you 
to stack them into tabs or keep them open in their own window. Pressing the Tab key 
will toggle them hidden. GIMP features a great fullscreen mode that allows you to not 
only preview your artwork but also to do editing work while using the most of your 
screen estate.
• 
Photo Enhancement: Numerous digital photo imperfections can be easily 
compensated for via GIMP. Fix perspective distortion caused by lens tilt simply by 
choosing the corrective mode in the transform tools. Eliminate lens barrel distortion 
and vignetting with a powerful filter but a simple interface. The included channel 
mixer gives you the flexibility and power to get your B/W photography to stand out 
the way you need.
• 
Digital Retouching: GIMP is ideal for advanced photo retouching techniques. Get 
rid of unneeded details using the Clone tool, or touch up minor details easily with 
the new Healing tool. With the Perspective Clone tool, it’s not difficult to clone objects 
with perspective in mind just as easily as with the Orthogonal clone.
• 
Hardware Support: GIMP includes very unique support for various input devices 
out of the box, including pressure and tilt sensitive tablets, and a wide range of 
USB or MIDI controllers. You can bind often-used actions to device events such as 
rotating a USB wheel or moving a MIDI controller’s slider. Change the size, angle, or 
opacity of a brush while you paint, or bind your favorite scripts to buttons. Speed up 
your workflow!
• 
File Formats: The file format support ranges from the common likes of JPEG (JFIF), 
GIF, PNG, and TIFF to special-use formats such as the multi-resolution and multi-
color-depth Windows icon files. The architecture allows you to extend GIMP’s format 
capabilities with a plug-in. You can find some rare format support in the GIMP  
plug-in registry. Thanks to the transparent virtual file system, it is possible to load 
and save files to from remote locations using protocols such as FTP, HTTP, or even 
SMB (MS Windows shares) and SFTP/SSH.To save disk space, any format can be 
saved with an archive extension such as ZIP, GZ, or BZ2, and GIMP will transparently 
compress the file without you needing to do any extra steps.
■
■Tip  There are many plug-ins available for GIMP to expand its capability. Just check out the Plug-in Registry 
page of the official GIMP website for a look at what’s available.
Editing Capabilities
GIMP can handle just about any kind of image editing task, from minor retouching to major image editing. 
GIMP has an extensive toolset, including the ones you’d expect to find, such as the Clone Stamp tool. It also 
includes a Healing tool, which is very helpful for touching up blemishes, lines, creases, and other flaws in 
portraits (Figure 4-13). GIMP can support the CMYK color model (the Separate + plug-in must be installed, 
however).

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
103

The Perspective tool is a handy for correcting images with lens distortion, or correcting the perspective 
of buildings or other structures (Figure 4-14).

The image of the belfry was shot from the ground, creating a slanted look. Using the Perspective tool in 
GIMP corrects the problem, resulting in a much better looking image (Figure 4-15).

Graphics Creation
GIMP is a very capable tool for creating graphics from the ground up. It hosts a wide assortment of brush 
styles, effects, and other functions to create impressive designs. Figure 4-16 is an example of a design I created 
entirely in GIMP. In the hands of good designers (and there are many designers who are better than me), 
GIMP can help in the creation of stunning images.
Figure 4-16.  A graphic design I created entirely using GIMP
GIMP Support
GIMP is a complex application, maybe not to the degree of Adobe Photoshop, but it is complex nonetheless. 
Beginners who first jump into this program can be overwhelmed with the wide array of functions and 
features. A great starting point (aside from becoming familiar with the User Manual in the Documentation 
section of the website) is visiting the tutorial section. There are tutorials for beginning, intermediate, and 
expert users. (Figure 4-17).

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
106
YouTube is also an excellent resource for learning GIMP. There are many video tutorials posted that 
will help the beginner come to grips with this powerful program. There are also a number of books about 
GIMP. Two great beginner’s guides are GIMP for Absolute Beginners by Jan Smith with Roman Joost, and my 
previous book, Beginning Photo Retouching and Restoration Using GIMP (both published by Apress).
Yet another excellent resource to check out is GIMP Magazine, a free online publication. This 
magazine can be obtained for free either as downloaded PDF file or read online. It’s a useful publication 
for photographers, graphics designers, or anyone wanting to learn more about GIMP. GIMP Magazine is 
available at www.gimpmagazine.org.

Pixlr Support
The Tutorials page on the Pixlr website will probably provide you with enough support to get up to speed 
using Pixlr Express and Pixlr O-Matic. Both are very easy to use since most of the functions involve clicking 
a thumbnail to apply the edit to your image. Pixlr Editor, on the other hand, is a powerful image editor and 
might require additional learning resources. There are quite a few tutorial videos on YouTube that cover all 
three offerings of Pixlr.
UFRaw: Open Source RAW Image Editing
UFRaw is a free, open source utility for reading and working with RAW images. RAW images are largely 
uncompressed, “pure” image data. RAW images are also known as digital negatives. UFRaw allows non-
destructive editing of your images. UFRaw can be used as a stand-alone program or as a plug-in for GIMP.

FotoSketcher: Automatically Turn Photos into Digital Art
FotoSketcher is an easy-to-use program for the Windows platform that gives your photos an artistic look in 
just a few clicks of the mouse. You don’t need much image editing knowledge; just open the image and apply 
the filter style you want. I’ve been using it for several years, and it comes in very handy for my work from 
time to time.

Feature Highlights
Rather than performing a wide range of functions , FotoSketcher’s primary purpose is converting 
photographic images into various types of digital art, so the list of highlights is rather short. Here’s how they 
read on the software provider’s website:
• 
100% free
• 
More than 25 effects
• 
No artistic skill needed
• 
Over 6 million downloads
• 
Available in 23 different languages

Chapter 4 ■ Photo Editing Software
115
The parameters of each artistic filter can be fine-tuned, and the results appear in the preview window 
(Figure 4-26). You’ll be able to add a canvas-like texture, soften the image edges, and a frame if you like. After 
applying the Draw command, you can undo the command to reset the image if you don’t like the results.
Editing Capabilities
FotoSketcher has a rudimentary editor to adjust certain aspects of the source image, such as luminosity 
(brightness), contrast, saturation, blur/sharpen, and median filter (Figure 4-25). After adjusting the source 
image the way you want, the program applies the filter you choose to create the desired outcome on a new 
target image, which you can save in the JPEG, PNG, or BMP format (the source image reverts to its original 
state after closing the program).

This program is really easy to use. However, you’ll probably need to spend a little time experimenting 
with the filter parameters to achieve the results you want. The Help section of the website consists of two 
instructional videos (and there are numerous tutorials on YouTube as well).

■Note   FotoSketcher should not be confused with PhotoSketcher, a paid Mac OS application. Although they 
are similar, the latter specializes in turning photos into digital pencil sketches. Along with FotoSketcher, there 
are several video tutorials about PhotoSketcher on YouTube, so it’s a good idea to pay attention to the spelling 
when using the keyword search box.

■Note  It’s important to make sure you are working within the law when using this type of software. For example, 
if you own a business and are the legal copyright owner of the contents of an old training CD that was produced 
years earlier, then you are within your rights to copy and distribute the contents. If someone else owns the rights, 
then you need to obtain written permission to copy and use those files. When in doubt, check with your attorney.
Upon launching the program, a Tip of the day window pops up (Figure 5-1). You can disable it if you wish, 
but it’s a good idea to read the tips to help familiarize yourself with the functions and features fre:ac offers.

Unfortunately, there’s not much in the way of documentation on the website other than the FAQ page. For 
that matter, there are only a handful of tutorial videos on YouTube. However, there is a Beginner’s Manual as 
a PDF that can be downloaded from ftp://193.169.37.88/Soft/PortableSoft/LiberKey/Apps/Freac/

Of course, this application is lightweight and easy to use. What the web site’s documentation lacks 
should be well covered in the PDF manual.
Audacity®: A Powerful, Open Source Audio Editor
Audacity is a very popular open source program for editing audio files. It’s not in the same league as 
professional audio editing packages used in the music industry, but it is certainly a great program for 
importing, exporting, and improving audio files.
Here are a few facts about Audacity at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Apple Logic Pro
• 
Website: http://web.audacityteam.org
• 
License: GPL
• 
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
• 
Potential Savings: $199.99
Audacity is an easy-to-use multitrack editor. It’s availability for use on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, 
making it a widely used program by enthusiasts and pros on a budget.

Chapter 5 ■ Audio-Video Capture, Conversion, and Editing Software
123
Feature Highlights
To see the long list of Audacity’s features, click the Features tab on the website (http://web.audacityteam.org/
about/features). The following is a quick rundown of several features as described on the website:
• 
Record live audio
• 
Record computer playback on any Windows Vista or later machine
• 
Convert tapes and records into digital recordings or CDs
• 
Edit WAV, AIFF, FLAC, MP2, MP3, or Ogg Vorbis sound files
• 
AC3, M4A/M4R (AAC), WMA, and other formats supported using optional libraries
• 
Cut, copy, splice, or mix sounds together
• 
Numerous effects including changing the speed or pitch of a recording
Audacity is primarily a tool used for music production. However, it has other practical applications 
beneficial to the business owner. Some businesses recycle advertisements from years past. If the advertisement 
is generic enough, it’s possible to use it indefinitely. Audacity is a great tool to digitize radio spots that are stored 
on old audio cassettes (Figure 5-4). The audio files can be incorporated with video or still images, posted on your 
company website, Facebook, YouTube, or any number of sites to further extend the advertisement’s usefulness.
Figure 5-4.  Audacity can digitize old radio ad spots for reuse

Chapter 5 ■ Audio-Video Capture, Conversion, and Editing Software
124
Of course, it’s also great for archiving your old personal music collection and childhood audio 
recordings.
■
■Note  If you plan to repurpose old radio spots, it’s best make sure you own the rights to those spots. If it is 
unclear, obtain (written, if possible) permission from the manager of the station that produced and broadcasted 
them. When in doubt, check with an attorney.
Audacity can record audio by connecting one end of a patch cord to the line-in jack of your computer, 
and the other to a play-back device (such as a cassette player). Figure 5-5 show the record button used to 
capture audio once the playback equipment is connected.
Figure 5-5.  Audacity’s Record button for recording audio from playback devices (Used with permission © The 
Audacity Team 2015)
Editing Capabilities
With Audacity, you can perform a number of editing tasks, such as importing audio, trimming away 
unwanted portions, and applying filters to modify or clean up the sound. There are many audio filters 
available for a wide range of purposes (Figure 5-6).

Chapter 5 ■ Audio-Video Capture, Conversion, and Editing Software
125
■
■Note  Audacity does not import or rip files from compact discs. Also, Audacity does not directly support MP3 
conversion and an additional library must be installed to export MP3 files.
Mono tracks can be split into stereo tracks. Although it’s not true stereo, the file will exist on a left and 
right channel, each of which can be independently edited. Conversely, stereo tracks can be merged into a 
single track and can be output as mono.
Audacity can also generate click tracks, which are audio cues to aid in timing in recording music.  
Click tracks are also used as a means of synchronizing audio to moving images (Figure 5-7).

Audacity Support
Audacity is a popular program, so there’s plenty of help available. The User Manual on the Audacity website  
(http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/quick_help.html) is the best starting point to familiarize yourself 
with the basics (Figure 5-8). There are beginning tutorials, and the FAQ page provides a lot of information. 
YouTube has numerous tutorial videos as well, but some of them may be for older versions. Up-to-date 
tutorials can be found here: http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Category:Tutorial#external.

MPEG Streamclip: A Handy, Free Video Conversion Tool
MPEG Streamclip is a useful, lightweight program primarily for converting standard definition video files 
from one format into another. It also offers some rudimentary editing features. One of this program’s uses is 
converting larger video files (such as AVI) into formats suitable for playback on mobile devices.
Here are a few facts about MPEG Streamclip at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: AVS Video Converter
• 
Website: www.squared5.com
• 
License: Proprietary Freeware
• 
Current Version: 1.2
• 
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS
• 
Potential Savings: $69 (annual subscription to AVS4You.com)
It should be mentioned that there is one caveat that accompanies the use of MPEG Streamclip;  
it requires that QuickTime Alternative is installed on your computer. This, however, isn’t a huge obstacle. 
QuickTime Alternative can be downloaded (for free) from the following link on Codecs.com:  
www.free-codecs.com/download/quicktime_alternative.htm.
Figure 5-8.  The Audacity User Manual is a great starting point to get familiar with this program. (Used with

Chapter 5 ■ Audio-Video Capture, Conversion, and Editing Software
128
Feature Highlights
MPEG Streamclip’s are listed in detail on the Squared 5 website. Here is the abridged version  
(and reformatted into a bullet list) of this program’s features from the website:
• 
Play and edit file formats such as QuickTime, DV, AVI, MPEG-4, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, 
or VOB.
• 
Transport streams with MPEG, PCM, or AC3 audio to QuickTime, DV, AVI/DivX, and 
MPEG-4 with high quality encoding and even uncompressed or HD video.
• 
Video conversion is performed in the YUV color space.
• 
Other optional video processing features include a powerful motion-adaptive 
deinterlacer, a field dominance converter, a chroma reinterlacer, and an option to 
perform interlaced scaling instead of progressive scaling.
• 
Audio can be converted to uncompressed or to IMA, AAC, MP2, or AMR using the 
high-quality MP1/MP2/AC3/PCM built-in decoders of MPEG Streamclip; it is also 
kept in perfect sync with video using a timekeeping system.
• 
Save edited movies as MOV files, and (when possible) as AVI or MP4 files. Edited 
MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 files are saved as MPEG or TS files.
• 
Convert MPEG-2 transport streams into muxed MPEG-2 files for immediate burning 
at full quality with most DVD authoring applications.
• 
Handle files and streams larger than 4 GB, split in any number of segments, or 
with multiple audio tracks, and can also optionally handle timecode breaks. It is 
compatible with MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video, MPEG layer 1/2 (MP1/MP2) audio, 
AC3/A52 audio, and PCM audio.
• 
The player lets you preview the files and transport streams before doing the 
conversion; it also lets you visually set the In and Out points for the conversion so 
you can convert just the part of the file you are interested in.
Once QuickTime Alternative is installed, upon launching MPEG Streamclip the workspace window 
appears with the Squared 5 logo in the center (a square with five small circles).
For file conversions, it’s essentially a matter of choosing the output format you want. There is a menu 
with choices of frame size, compression quality, and others options depending on the format chosen. MPEG 
Streamclip can come in handy for converting larger video formats into MPEG-4 files, commonly used on 
mobile devices (Figure 5-9)

Chapter 5 ■ Audio-Video Capture, Conversion, and Editing Software
129
Editing Capabilities
MPEG Streamclip offers only limited editing functions. It is possible to set In and Out points so that only the 
desired portions of the movie are converted to the new file. There is an Adjustments dialog box for adjusting 
the brightness, contrast, saturation (Figure 5-10), and volume of the movie. There is also an option to add 
basic text as a watermark that appears in the lower right hand corner of the video frame.
Figure 5-9.  Larger video formats can be converted to MPEG-4, which is used on mobile devices
Figure 5-10.  Brightness is improved using the Adjustments dialog box
MPEG Streamclip Support
There’s no real documentation on the Squared 5 website to speak of (other than the Features page and 
the website itself), but there is an MPEG Streamclip User’s Guide available as a downloadable PDF from 
https://people.ok.ubc.ca/creative/Mbtemp/MPEG%20Streamclip%20User%27s%20Guide.pdf.
Fortunately, YouTube has plenty of instructional videos, many of which are introductory tutorials. 
MPEG Streamclip is a simple enough program to ensure there’s no shortage of learning resources for it.

Windows Movie Maker: The Free Microsoft  
Video Editing Tool
Many of the small business owners I come into contact with are, by their own admission, not technically 
inclined. I’m often surprised at how often I talk with Windows uses who aren’t aware that Movie Maker may 
already installed on their computer, or that it can be downloaded for free from Microsoft. Although those 
people are probably a small minority, I felt it important to touch on this program.
Movie Maker has made some notable strides since its early days. It can be a valuable tool for creating 
videos to output to DVD or post on Facebook and YouTube.
Here are a few facts about Windows Movie Maker at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Adobe Premier Elements
•

If Microsoft Movie Maker is not currently installed on your computer, it can be acquired from the Movie 
Maker download page at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker.
Feature Highlights
Movie Maker offers a variety of features to help you create a polished production. The following list provides 
an overview:
• 
Import existing video files, audio files, and pictures into Movie Maker
• 
Import video files from your from digital video camera
• 
Add a variety transitions and effects to your production
• 
Add titles and credits to your production
• 
Output your movie in a variety of ways, such as on DVD or YouTube
Editing Capabilities
With Movie Maker, you can give your movies a professional look by adding titles and text (Figure 5-11). 
Effects and transitions can be added to further refine your movie production. Although it doesn’t have any 
adjustments for color correction (although there are a few work-around solutions on YouTube), Movie 
Maker has a rudimentary brightness adjustment to brighten dark, underexposed video.

Windows Movie Maker Support
Windows Movie Maker is a fairly easy program to use, but there are several good resources to help you if you 
encounter problems using this application, or if you have a desire to be more creative with your productions. 
Blaine’s Movie Maker Blog (http://movies.blainesville.com/) is a helpful resource, with just about all the 
information you’d need to make the most of your videos using Movie Maker (Figure 5-14). There are also a 
number of good tutorial videos on YouTube to help get you up and running.

VirtualDub: Open Source Video Processing for Windows
We looked at the features offered in Windows Movie Maker, which are probably sufficient for many people 
making their own business videos. VirtualDub offers a few features not found in Movie Maker, and this 
makes it an excellent companion program (but it can be used as a basic editor in its own right).
Here are a few facts about VirtualDub at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Adobe Premier Elements
• 
Website: www.virtualdub.org
• 
License: GPL
• 
Current Version: 1.10.4
• 
Operating Systems: Windows
• 
Potential Savings: $99.99
VirtualDub is really more of a video capture and processing tool than it is a general purpose video 
editor. Among its strengths are filters such as Levels, Hue/Saturation/Value, and many others. VirtualDub 
can make color enhancements and improve exposure in less-than-perfect video clips (Figure 5-15).

Chapter 5 ■ Audio-Video Capture, Conversion, and Editing Software
133
■
■Note  It’s helpful to have a video capture card or device that captures video as AVI files to your computer. 
Otherwise, you can use a free program like MPEG Streamclip (also covered in this chapter) to convert other 
formats to an AVI file in order to use VirtualDub.
Feature Highlights
VirtualDub has a an extensive list of features primarily for managing AVI files. I’ve listed them here as they 
are shown on the website, although a couple of them are slightly abridged:
• 
Fractional frame rates
• 
Optimized disk access for more consistent hard disk usage
• 
Create AVI2 (OpenDML) files to break the AVI 2GB barrier and multiple files to break 
the FAT32 4GB limit
• 
Integrated volume meter and histogram for input level monitoring
• 
Real-time downsizing, noise reduction, and field swapping
• 
Verbose monitoring, including compression levels, CPU usage, and free disk space
• 
Access hidden video formats your capture card may support but not have a setting 
for, such as 352x480
• 
Keyboard and mouse shortcuts for faster operation (such as just hit F6 to capture)
• 
Clean interface layout: caption, menu bar, info panel, status bar
Figure 5-15.  Improving a dark video using the Levels filter within VirtualDub

Chapter 5 ■ Audio-Video Capture, Conversion, and Editing Software
134
• 
Read and write AVI2 (OpenDML) and multi-segment AVI clips
• 
Integrated MPEG-1 and Motion-JPEG decoders
• 
Remove and replace audio tracks without touching the video
• 
Extensive video filter set, including blur, sharpen, emboss, smooth, 3x3 convolution, 
flip, resize rotate, brightness/contrast, levels, deinterlace, and threshold
• 
Bilinear and bicubic resampling so no blocky resizes or rotates here
• 
Decompress and recompress both audio and video
• 
Remove segments of a video clip and save the rest without recompressing
• 
Adjust frame rate, decimate frames, and 3:2 pulldown removal
• 
Preview the results with live audio
Editing Capabilities
VirtualDub is somewhat limited when compared to a more full-featured program. For example, video 
processed using this software requires a separate authoring program to write a DVD. Another limitation is 
the fact that it only handles Microsoft AVI files. Although it does have some editing features, it could be used 
to augment Movie Maker.
However, it does offers a generous filter set to improve video quality and to add a variety of effects. The 
preview window provides a side-by-side comparison of the original dark video (Figure 5-16).
Figure 5-16.  Side-by-side comparison of original video and the clip with a filter applied

Chapter 5 ■ Audio-Video Capture, Conversion, and Editing Software
135
■
■Note   Although VirtualDub already has a large filter set, there are even more third-party filters available to 
download from providers such as majorgeeks.com.
VirtualDub also allows the placement of logos or images over a video clip. In Figure 5-17, I placed 
a simplified version of my logo over a sample clip of a film transfer done recently (I post sample clips on 
YouTube to help me promote my film conversion services). I created the logo using GIMP 2.8, and exported 
it in the PNG file format with a transparent background.
Figure 5-17.  A logo added to a video clip in VirtualDub
VirtualDub also allows you to remove unwanted sections of video to create a new, edited clip by using 
the Mark In and Mark Out feature. You can also remove existing audio tracks and replace them with new 
ones if needed. After the video clip has been processed and edited, you can save it as a new AVI file.
VirtualDub Support
There are quite a few video tutorials on YouTube that will help the new user get acquainted with VirtualDub. 
I recommend taking some time to watch these if you are new to video editing. There is also a support forum 
on the official VirtualDub website.

More often than not, the quality of the video shot with consumer camcorders and video cameras can 
stand improvement. The Color Correction effect is especially useful for polishing up video by improving 
colors and exposure in footage.
The Curves feature (Figure 5-20) helps bring out detail in dark footage. Color can be enhanced by using 
the 3 point balance or the white balance effect.

Summary
This chapter looked at several no-cost solutions for working with audio and video files. This can be 
especially useful for the small business looking to create marketing messages to get on to platforms like 
YouTube, social media, and other avenues where audio and video is effective.
The first software title, fre:ac (Free Audio Converter), is a free and effective tool for ripping CDs and 
converting audio files from one format to another. Audacity also converts audio files, but it also captures 
analog audio from sources such as audio tapes and LP records. Audacity offers effects filters and editing 
capabilities for audio.
MPEG Streamclip is a handy tool with rudimentary editing abilities primarily used for converting video 
files from one format to another. Windows Movie Maker (often already installed on Windows computers) 
is a free video editing program that offers a number of transitions and effects to polish up your video 
productions. VirtualDub is a video capture and processing application for Windows that can work well 
as a companion program to Movie Maker. It offers a wealth of effects filters, including color and exposure 
correction. Kdenlive is a feature-rich video editing program for use with Linux and Mac OS. It boasts a 
number of effects and transition styles. It can also edit HD video.
For additional no-cost programs, there are several other audio and video programs as well as disc 
burning software listed in Appendix B of this book.
In the next chapter, you’ll look at some free options for project planning, inventory management, and 
time tracking.

Project Planning, Inventory 
Management, and Time Tracking 
Software
Organization and accuracy are crucial in any business. During my early days in the retail hardware business, 
projects were planned on pen and paper. Inventory specialists did physical counts of the store’s inventory 
twice a year (in those days, we were not computerized). Tracking the time invested in business activities was 
largely guesswork.
This chapter looks at several powerful, free options for planning projects, and keeping track of inventory, 
human resources, and billable time. Here’s a quick look at the software programs covered in this chapter:

ProjectLibre: An Open Source Alternative to Microsoft Project
ProjectLibre is an extremely useful program for creating and managing company projects. It’s capable of 
everything from simple projects requiring only a few tasks to complex projects involving multiple colleagues.
Here are a few facts about ProjectLibre at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Microsoft Project
• 
Website: www.projectlibre.org
• 
License: GNU
• 
Current Version: 1.5.9
• 
Operating Systems: Cross-platform
• 
Potential Savings: $589.99
ProjectLibre is described on the software provider’s website as the open source replacement for Microsoft 
Project. With the standard version of MS project costing almost $600.00, it’s certainly worth trying out.
■
■Note   I use ProjectLibre for planning both professional and home projects; it has become one of the most 
important programs I rely on. ProjectLibre is used in over 200 countries.
Feature Highlights
According to the website, ProjectLibre has been downloaded over 1,700,000 times and was named 
Computerworld’s “Best Open Source Software.” Here’s a quick look at the features:
• 
Compatibility with Microsoft Project 2010
• 
User interface improvement
• 
Gantt chart
• 
PERT chart
• 
Network diagram
• 
Earned value costing
ProjectLibre relies on Java to work, so you should make sure that the latest version is installed on your 
computer. After downloading and installing ProjectLibre, you’re ready to start a new project (Figure 6-1). 
The project can be given a name, the name of project manager, start date (it assigns the current date by 
default), and any relevant notes.

Chapter 6 ■ Project Planning, Inventory Management, and Time Tracking Software
145
Adjustments can be made in the Project Information dialog box (Figure 6-2). Under the General tab are 
settings such as start and finish dates, status, the expense type, project type, etc.

The workspace shows the tasks of my project on the left as data in a spreadsheet, and on the right 
graphically represented as a Gantt chart (Figure 6-3). A Gantt chart is essentially a bar chart that illustrates 
the start/finish dates of tasks in the project.

■
■Note   In my sample project, the arrows shown represent the order in which the tasks must be undertaken 
(known as dependencies). This basically means that a specific task must be completed before I can move on to 
the next one. The arrows are inserted by clicking a task on the Gantt chart, and dragging a line to the sequential 
task in the workflow. When the mouse button is released, the arrow is created.
ProjectLibre Support
A great way to become familiar with ProjectLibre is to open the Help menu and cycle through the  
Tip of the Day window (Figure 6-4). If you join the ProjectLibre Community, you’ll have access to the blog 
posts, discussion groups, and user groups.

There are a number of YouTube tutorials that are very helpful in learning this program. Also, there 
is a PDF of the ProjectLibre User Guide that can be downloaded from this URL: http://adte.ca/pdf/

Gantter: A Free Web-Based Project Management Solution
Gantter is a free project scheduling tool from Smartapps.com. It’s similar to ProjectLibre in most respects, 
but because it’s a web-based application, it can be accessed from any computer connected to the Internet.
Here are a few facts about Gantter at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Smartsheet
• 
Website: www.gantter.com
• 
License: Proprietary SAAS
• 
Current Version: 3.0
• 
Operating Systems: Web-based/Cross-platform
• 
Potential Savings: $14.00 per month
Like MS Project or ProjectLibre, Gantter is capable of scheduling projects both simple and complex. 
Because it is web-based, it appeals to those who prefer working in their browser (there is a desktop version 
available in the Chrome Web Store for $9.99).
Feature Highlights
Gantter offers a number of useful features, making it a worthy web-based application for project 
management. Here’s a look at a few:
• 
Supports over 20 languages
• 
Attach files and links directly from your favorite cloud storage provider
Figure 6-4.  Taking some time to cycle through and read each the tip of the day will help you quickly become

• 
Import and export MS Project files
•

Gantter is available in four editions: one for Smartapp.com, one for Google Drive, one for Google Apps, 
and the paid desktop version (Figure 6-5). All Gantter files are compatible with all editions of Gantter.

In this example, I’m creating a sample project in which I will first design and then hire a contractor to 
build a display rack for selling printed digital artwork in a local gift shop. Figure 6-6 shows the settings under 
the General tab where the project is given a name and start date, and options for the calender. The other tabs 
are for formatting parameters such as industry type, length of a working day, resources, etc.
The properties of the tasks that comprise the project can also be set. Like other project management 
software, dependencies can be put into place (Figure 6-7).

Chapter 6 ■ Project Planning, Inventory Management, and Time Tracking Software
151
In the Gantt chart view of the project created (Figure 6-8), the order in which the tasks must be 
completed is indicated by an arrowed line. Two of the tasks indicate that there are resources connected, 
which in this case is the contractor who will actually cut and finish the cabinet-grade wood, and then 
assemble and finish it.

Figure 6-8.  Tasks shown in the Gantt chart view (Used with permission © InQuest Technologies 2015)
For better organization, the text, background, and Gantt chart views can be color-coded. This can be 
especially helpful for highly detailed projects. For example, each task delegated to a specific person can be 
one color, the tasks delegated to another person can be another color, and so on.
Another advantage Gantter offers is that the project schedule can be exported as a PDF file and then printed.
Gantter Support
Gantter offers ease of use, but there is plenty in the way of support. The Help page has tons of information to 
help the new user get started. The tutorial videos are especially helpful in seeing Gantter in action (Figure 6-9). 
You can also turn to the Gantter Community if you have questions that aren’t addressed in the other resources.

ABC (Always Better Control) Inventory: A Free Option For the 
Small- and Mid-Sized Business
ABC Inventory from Almyta Systems is a free inventory management program for Windows. It might be just 
the solution for a budget-minded small warehouse or distribution center.

Website Creation Software and 
Web Browsers
This chapter introduces several no-cost tools for creating websites, blogging, and managing social media in 
order to maximize business exposure.
Here’s a look at the software programs covered in this chapter:
• 
WordPress: An easy-to-use tool for website and blog creation

WordPress: Free, Open-Source Tool and Content 
Management System
WordPress is a CMS (content management system) that is based on PHP and MySQL, with one of its features 
being a plug-in architecture as a template system. As of January 2015, this program was used by more than 
23% of the top 10 million websites, making it the most popular blogging system in use on the Web.
Here are a few facts about WordPress at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: IM Creator
• 
Website: www.wordpress.org
• 
License: GNU GPL v2+ [4]
• 
Current Version: 4.2.2
• 
Operating Systems: PHP
WordPress is a free blogging software that can be installed onto a website so that anyone can write 
and manage their own blog. In general, it is easy to install and use (Figure 7-1). You start with an e-mail 
address, user name, password, and a blog address. The available tutorials take you concisely through all the 
necessary steps of installing and using your own WordPress blog. This allows you to configure and customize 
it, only modifying it so that it is search-engine friendly. In a nutshell, WordPress has a web template system 
that uses a template processor.

Feature Highlights
The free version of WordPress has several interesting and innovative features:
• 
Using its web service, Akismet checks your comments to see if they look like spam or 
not.
• 
WordPress comes with extended plug-ins so as to expand the functionality of the 
program: 38,217 plug-ins with nearly 1 million total downloads are included.
• 
BuddyPress is an integral part of WordPress; it enables you to run any kind of social 
network on your program, with activity streams, user groups, member profiles, 
messaging, and much more.
• 
WP Super Cache is WordPress’ extremely fast caching engine that produces static 
HTML files.
• 
Jetpack by WordPress.com makes your WordPress streamlined for ease of use.
• 
bb press is a forum software made the WordPress way.
• 
Theme check is a simple, easy way to test out your theme to confirm that you are 
following all of the latest WordPress standards and practices. It’s a terrific theme 
development tool.
WordPress users may choose to install and switch between themes (Figure 7-2). Themes are what allow 
users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website. They can be installed without altering 
the content or health of the site. WordPress websites all require at least one theme be present. WordPress 
themes are, in general, free themes, but the program also provides premium themes a price. Users of this 
program may also create and develop custom themes if they have the knowledge and skill to do so.
Figure 7-1.  Getting started on WordPress is an easy process

Chapter 7 ■ Website Creation Software and Web Browsers
171
Other features available within WordPress consist of integrated link management; a search engine-
friendly, clean perm link structure; and the ability to tag posts and articles. Automatic filters are also 
included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text and articles. WordPress also supports the 
TrackBack and Pingback standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post 
or an article. WordPress blog posts can be edited in either HTML, using the visual editor, or via a number of 
plug-ins that offer a wide variety of customized editing features.
Multi-User and Multi-Blogging
Before Version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation. This was limiting, to say the least, although 
multiple concurrent copies were able to run from different directories, as long as they were configured to 
use separate database tables. WordPress Multi-User (formerly referred to as WordPress MU, or WPMU,) 
was almost a splitting in half of WordPress, and was created to allow multiple blogs to exist within that one 
installation but with the ability to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU has made it 
possible for those individuals with websites to host their own blogging communities, and to also control and 
moderate all blogs from a single dashboard. What is even more exciting is that WordPress MS ads a new data 
table for each blog.
WordPress Support
Customer support for WordPress comes in several fashions, including live chat support, a help page, e-mail 
support, and customer service online support. Because WordPress is a popular application, there are plenty 
of tutorial videos on YouTube.
KompoZer for Easy Web Authoring
KompoZer is a complete web authoring system that combines web file management and easy-to-use 
WYSIWYG webpage editing. If you want to enhance business exposure with a compelling website  
(and Adobe Dreamweaver is a little rich for your budget), then KompoZer is worth checking out.

Chapter 7 ■ Website Creation Software and Web Browsers
173
Feature Highlights
KompoZer has an impressive list of desirable features. This is the list as shown on the website:
• 
WYSIWYG editing of pages, making web creation as easy as typing a letter with your 
word processor.
• 
Integrated file management via FTP. Simply log in to your web site and navigate 
through your files, editing web pages on the fly directly from your site.
• 
Reliable HTML code creation that will work with all of today’s most popular 
browsers.
• 
Jump between WYSIWYG Editing Mode and HTML using tabs.
• 
Tabbed editing makes working on multiple pages a snap.
• 
Powerful support for forms, tables, and templates.
• 
The easiest-to-use, most powerful web authoring system available for desktop Linux, 
Microsoft Windows, and Apple Macintosh users.
For Linux users, KompoZer is a GTK application. It has nothing to do with KDE, although it can be 
installed on to KDE. (FYI, Komodo and the Kernel are not KDE applications either.)
Another thing to note is that KompoZer version 0.7.10 is NOT compatible with GTK ³ 2.14; this has 
caused crashes on Linux distros, such as Ubuntu 8.10 and Ubuntu 9.04. To avoid this problem, make sure to 
download KompoZer 0.8.
There are several add-ons available to improve the functionality of KompoZer (Figure 7-4). KompoZer 
is considered a worthy alternative to Adobe Dreamweaver. Another quality that makes it so attractive is that 
it is compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, and BSD.

BlueGriffon: A New WYSIWYG Content Editor for the Web
BlueGriffin 1.7.2 is free to download and is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It is an intuitive 
application that provides web authors (beginners or advanced) with a simple user interface. BlueGriffin aids 
in the creation of visually exciting websites and does not require extensive technical knowledge about web 
standards.
Here are a few facts about BlueGriffon at a glance:
• 
Alternative To: Adobe Dreamweaver

Website: www.bluegriffon.org
• 
License: MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/L GPL 2.1 Tri-License, Proprietary License for Most

Potential Savings: $19.99 per month
Technically, Gecko resides inside BlueGriffin. The document you edit will look exactly the same in 
Firefox. There are numerous add-ons available to enhance functionality. Project Manager, CFS Stylesheet 
Editor, Word Count, MathML Editor, and Full Screen View/Edit are add-ons you must pay for, but Fire FTP 
and Dictionaries are free to download.
After installing BlueGriffon, the Document Type Wizard can lend its assistance (Figure 7-6).

Chapter 7 ■ Website Creation Software and Web Browsers
176
Feature Highlights
The following are some highlights of the features offered:
• 
The editor works much the same way as the one in KompoZer, but it seems there has 
been some additional consideration put into the process of building websites, as well 
as the editing the HTML and CSS files. Also, because of HTML5, there are some new 
additions to the toolbar.
• 
Body text is not always the default. In KompoZer, the default text was body text. You 
had to select paragraph at the start of each new section. If headings were used, they 
had to be assigned, and then, before exiting the heading line, paragraph had to be 
selected. With BlueGriffon, when you exit the heading line, paragraph is selected as 
the type of text for your content.
• 
The Link dialog has been greatly improved. If something is on the clipboard when 
you open the link dialog, it is automatically copied to the file path line. This makes 
linking to external resources very easy. Open the page in your browser and copy the 
URL. When you open the link dialog, you won’t have to paste the link in the file path 
box. There is a folder to the right of the file path box; it will still open the explorer-

• 
CSS editing shortcuts are available if you hand-code your CSS files. When you type 
the opening curly bracket, the closing curly bracket appears simultaneously, with 
the cursor in-between the brackets. There is a list of possibilities from which to 
choose from when you begin to type a rule. When you type the colon, the closing 
semicolon also appears, and when you begin to type a value, a list of possible values 
automatically appears.
• 
BlueGriffin opens up tabs from your last session in the blink of an eye. There is a 
checkbox in the preferences on the file tab to restore last session’s tabs. With the box 
checked, when the program launches, it opens the page(s) that you were last working 
on. This can be a very useful feature.
As with all software, there are pros and cons. Some of the pros that have been cited are that it is W3C 
standards-compliant, it supports HTML5, and there are built-in CSS and SVG Tools. Also, BlueGriffon is 
available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The cons listed were no documentation, no JavaScript or PHP tools, 
and that the file transfer protocol is not included.
BlueGriffon Support
The Discussions section of the Community page is the primary support resource from the website  
(Figure 7-7). There are also quite a few video tutorials on YouTube.
Chromium: Where Google Chrome Gets Its Code
Chromium is an open source web browser project from which Google Chrome draws its source code. The 
two browsers basically share the majority of code, although there are some differences between features, 
and each has its own different licensing.

Here are a few facts about Chromium at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Mozilla Firefox
• 
Website: www.chromium.org
• 
License: BSD license, MIT license, LGPL, MS-PL, and MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-licensed 
code, plus unlicensed files
• 
Operating System: BSD, Linux (+GCC v4.6 & +GTK v2.24 & +Glibc 2.15), OS X (10.6 
and later), Windows (XP SP2 and later), Android (4.0 and later)
• 
Platform: Cross-platform
Google’s intention was that Chromium would be used as the name for the open source project, so that 
the final product name would be Chrome (chrome metal plating is derived from chromium). Interestingly, 
other developers have taken the chromium code and released versions under the same name.
Feature Highlights
The following are a couple of the major features and the focus of the Chromium project:
• 
It’s a tabbed window manager for the Web. Rather than being a traditional browser 
application, it works more in a “shell fashion.”
• 
The application has been designed to present a minimalist user interface. The 
application’s developers claim the program “should feel lightweight (cognitively and 
physically) and fast.”
In January 2011, the Chrome Product Manager announced that Chrome would no longer support 
H.264 video format for its HTML5 player. In 2013, Cisco opted to make the H.264 codecs open source, and 
even cover the costs of any fees required. As of the end of 2013, Chrome continues to support H.264. Linux 
operations that distribute Chromium may add support for other codecs to their customized versions.
Examples of other browsers based on Chromium are CodeWeavers CrossOver Chromium (an unofficial 
bundle of a Wine derivative) and Chromium Developer Build 21 for Linux and OS X, which was released in 
2008 by CodeWeavers as part of a crossover project.
A rebranded version of Chromium for 32-bit Windows 7, Vista, and XP, Comodo Dragon is produced by 
the Comodo Group. The developer claims that it provides improved security and privacy features.
CoolNovo, which was referred to as ChromePlus prior to 2012, is a Chromium-based browser for 
Windows and Linux. It adds features such as mouse gestures, link dragging, and IE tabs.
You might ask, what is Cốc Cốc? Well, it is a freeware web browser focused on the Vietnamese market. 
Developed by the Vietnamese company Cốc Cốc, the application is based on Chromium open-source code 
for Windows. Another application, Dartium, is a very unique build of the Chromium browser, and includes 
the Dart VM, which is maintained by Google.
Summarizing, Google’s Chrome seems to be the premier web browser choice for everyone from the 
day-to-day casual user right to the code-designing auteur.
Firefox: The Open Source Browser That Respects Privacy
Mozilla Firefox (known simply as Firefox) is a free and open-source web browser developed for Windows, OS X,  
and Linux, with a mobile version for Android. Produced by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the 
Mozilla Corporation, Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages. Firefox implements current 
and anticipated web standards into its browser.

Here are a few facts about Firefox at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Internet Explorer, Chrome
• 
Website: www.mozilla.org/firefox
• 
Current Version:
• 
License: MPL 2.0
• 
Operating System: Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, Firefox OS
As of early 2015, Firefox had approximately 20% of worldwide usage as a “desktop” browser. According 
to different sources, it is the third most popular web browser and it is still the most popular in several 
countries as a desktop browser, including Iran, Indonesia, and Germany. As of the end of 2014, there were 
half a billion Firefox users around the world, according to Mozilla.
Firefox has long since been considered superior to programs like Internet Explorer. If you’ve had to 
deal with security breaches and download problems in the past, Firefox may be a better choice. Firefox is 
often considered to be among the fastest and safest web browsers available. It does, of course, have some 
disadvantages, including compatibility and memory issues.
Several advantages to keep in mind regarding Firefox:
• 
Speed: Firefox is considered to be the fastest browser when it comes to downloading. 
Not only do apps and files download faster, but users get a record of all their 
downloads in the form of a table, so they can erase or move them at their discretion.
• 
Security: Firefox contains some advanced security measures that can help to protect 
the computer from spyware and even certain viruses. Included in the program is a 
state-of-the-art pop-up blocker, which stops almost 100% of pop-ups.
• 
Tabbed Browsing and Other Advanced Features: Tabbed browsing, which is 
becoming the standard in web browsers, allows the user to open an unlimited 
number of pages in a single window. This means if the computer is powered down or 
loses power by mistake, the browser will remember which websites were previously 
open, and then offer to restore the last session.
As with all prime advantages, there are some disadvantages:
• 
Compatibility Issues: Compatibility seems to be the main disadvantage of using 
Firefox. In this browser, some websites do not view properly, and require the user to 
open them with Internet Explorer.
• 
Memory: Unfortunately, Firefox takes a lot of memory to run. Even those with an up-
to-date computer have found that it becomes hard to run the browser when several 
other programs are open. At times, the software tends to freeze and close when 
too many tabs are open simultaneously. This is why the brand invested heavily in 
creating a recovery memory feature.
• 
Interrupted Service: Downloads, unfortunately, cannot be resumed if they are 
interrupted. This may not a big deal for those who have cable or DSL service, but 
anyone still on a dial-up connection may encounter many problems because of it. 
Not a widely known fact, the browser was designed for people using high-speed 
Internet, which means dial-up users can run into many problems when using 
Firefox.
The Firefox Project has undergone a handful of name changes. Originally it was called Phoenix (the 
mythical firebird that rose from the ashes of the one before it). In this case, Firefox rose from the “ashes” of 
Netscape’s Navigator, which died a sad death under the heels of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. Phoenix was 

Chapter 7 ■ Website Creation Software and Web Browsers
180
later renamed because of trademark issues; however, the Mozilla Foundation stated that the browser would 
always bear the name Mozilla Firebird to avoid confusion. After further pressure from Firebird, in 2004, 
Mozilla changed the name once again, to Mozilla Firefox. Interestingly, for an abbreviation, Mozilla prefers 
Fx or fx; however, it is most often abbreviated as FF.
Feature Highlights
Firefox provides an environment for web developers to use built-in tools, such as the error console, the DOM 
Inspector, or other extensions, such as Firebug.
• 
Firefox includes a wide variety of features, including tabbed browsing, spell check, 
incremental find, smart bookmarks, live bookmarking, a download manager, private 
browsing, location-aware browsing (also known as geolocation, based on a Google 
service,) and an integrated search system that by default uses Google in most 
localizations.
• 
Additional functions may be added through extensions created by third-party 
developers.
Firefox maintains its high level of security through a sandbox security model. This limits scripts 
from accessing data from websites based on the same origin policy. For authentication purposes, it also 
provides support for many things, from smartcards to web applications. It utilizes SSL/TLS to protect 
communications with web servers using strong cryptography when using the HTTPS protocol. Regardless of 
an HTTPS or HTTP URL, Firefox now supports HTTP/2.
Mozilla actually offers a “bug bounty” of up to $3,000 cash to programmers and researchers who 
discover severe security holes in Firefox.
Firefox generally has fewer publicly known unpatched security vulnerabilities than Internet Explorer, 
which is often cited as a reason to switch from one to the other. A 2006 study by Symantec demonstrated 
that Firefox had surpassed other browsers in a number of vendor-confirmed vulnerabilities that year. It was 
found that these vulnerabilities were patched much quicker than those found in other browsers; Firefox’s 
vulnerabilities were fixed one day after the exploit code was made available, on average, compared to nine 
days for Internet Explorer. Pundits still agree that overall, Firefox has fewer security vulnerabilities than IE.
Summary
In this chapter, you looked at three no-cost options for building websites. WordPress, although capable of 
creating websites, is primarily a tool for creating blog sites. Blogging is an effective means for business to stay 
connected to their customer base. KompoZer and BlueGriffon are both website creation tools that are free 
alternatives to the likes of Adobe Dreamweaver.
In this chapter, you looked at two web browsers. Chromium (where the code for Chrome originates) is 
described by the developers as a minimalist application, being cognitively and physically lightweight and 
fast. Firefox is lauded for its emphasis on privacy.
In the next chapter, you’ll look at some free content management solutions.

Chapter 8
Content Management Solutions
This chapter takes a look at the following alternatives to expensive CMS programs such as Microsoft 
SharePoint:
• 
Drupal: An open source, community-based alternative
• 
concrete5: An open source content management system
• 
GetSimple CMS: A simple, open source content management system
Drupal: An Open Source, Community-Based Alternative
Drupal is a free software application that allows users to easily organize, manage, and publish their content 
with a seemingly endless variety of customization. Drupal is open source software that is developed and 
maintained by a group of over one million users and developers. Drupal is distributed under the terms of the 
GNU General Public license. Like other programs under the GPL, it is free to for anyone to download and 
share with others. This open development model means that individuals are continuously working to make 
sure Drupal is a cutting-edge platform that can support the latest technologies offered on the World Wide 
Web. The Drupal project’s principles encourage standards, modularity, ease of use, and collaboration.
Here are a few facts about Drupal at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Microsoft SharePoint
• 
Website: www.drupal.org
• 
License: GPL Version 2 or Later
• 
Current Version: 7.38
• 
Operating System: Cross-platform
• 
Potential Savings: $5.00 per user per month
Drupel is used as a backend framework for approximately 2.1% of all websites worldwide. This includes 
sites ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites. It is also recognized for 
business collaboration and knowledge management.
Drupal Core contains basic features commonly found in most content management systems. These 
features include user account registration and maintenance, managing menus, taxonomy, customized page 
layouts, RSS feeds, and system administration.
By the end of the first quarter of 2015, there were more than 30,000 free community-contributed add-
ons, known as contributed modules. These are available to alter and/or extend Drupal’s capabilities, and to 
add new features or customize the program’s behavior and appearance.

The Drupal community has in excess of one million members and 31,000 developers. And although 
Drupal offers an advanced programming interface, basic website installation and administration of the 
framework does not require programming skills.1
Feature Highlights
The following are some of the features offered by Drupal:
• 
Mobile friendly: Built-in themes and administration pages are quite easy to use 
on mobile devices. The new admin toolbar is mobile from the start. Tables shrink 
properly. The new administration properties feature a back-to-site button that leads 
back to the last front-end page.
• 
Multilingual capabilities: When you need to establish a web presence for a global 
audience, Drupal 8 can speak your language, whatever it may be. This application 
can translate anything in the system with the built-in user interfaces. Another great 
facet of the program is that you can get software translation updates automatically 
from the Drupal community.
• 
Configuration management: CM keeps accurate records of all important details as 
content is configured and/or revised. This program comes with a file system based 
on the CM system, which makes it simple to transport configuration changes, such as 
new content types, fields, or views, from development to production.
• 
Accessibility: For standard accessibility technologies, including WAIARIA, Drupal 
8 has added extensive support, and developers have been working to provide more 
semantic HTML5.
Other notable features include built-in web services, effortless authoring, fun and fast streaming, 
and the views, which are all done with an industry standard approach. With better markup with HTML5, 
and more field power, Drupal 8 could still use some assistance in preparing for its first release. There is 
excitement amongst the mentors of the Drupal 8 program, and eagerness to get new people involved 
because there is always something that can be learned from peers and mentors alike.2
Although the features list covers all the new developments in Drupal 8, keep in mind that Drupal 7.38 
was released in June of 2015. Drupal, in its effort to utilize the community’s knowledge and experience, has 
established a security bug bounty program for Drupal 8 (Figure 8-1). They will pay you anywhere between 
$50-$1000 per issue found; the more serious the issue, the more you will be paid. It’s as easy as downloading 
a copy of Drupal 8, and finding security issues such as XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, access bypass, etc. For more 
information, go to the Drupal 8 Security Page at www.drupal.org/drupal8-security-bounty.

concrete5: An Open Source Content Management System
The free and open source concrete5 is a content management system for publishing content on the Web and 
on an intranet. For those seeking a viable alternative to Microsoft SharePoint, it is well worth your time.
• 
Alternative to: Microsoft SharePoint
• 
Website: www.concrete5.org
• 
License: MIT
• 
Current Version: tk
• 
Potential savings: $5.00 per user per month
Feature Highlights
Here is a quick look at some of the features offered by concrete5:
• 
Easy to use: Provides an intuitive experience that everyone can edit.
• 
Easy to theme: Basic HTML code can be converted into a concrete5 theme in a 
matter of minutes.
• 
Easy to extend: The flexible architecture of concrete5 makes response easier as 
clients get involved.
• 
Concrete5 is free: It is a free CMS solution that runs on a web server. The developers 
of concrete5 partnered with some budget hosts so you can quickly get started.
One of the most attractive features of concrete5 is that it is a very easy program to use (Figure 8-2). For 
example, once you log in, every single page of your website has an editing toolbar. If you see something you 
want to change, all you have to do is simply click the Edit button and make your changes.

The program can convert basic HTML into a concrete5 theme in just a few moments. It’s as easy as 
copying and pasting a line of PHP code for any area you want to be able to edit, and that’s it. The program 
also presents a showcase of sample websites created with concrete5. This lets you see the great variety 
of sites that can be created with this application. On the Themes page, there is a marketplace of themes 
available; some are free and some are paid themes (Figure 8-3).

Chapter 8 ■ Content Management Solutions
185
While concrete5 is free and open source, it requires paying a service to host your site. The concrete5 
Team can provide this service (and you can be assured of top-notch support; you’ll also be supporting the 
concrete5 project).
Of course, there are other options available. The concrete5 Team maintains a relationship with several 
budget companies that provide budget hosting.
concrete5 Support
There is a great deal of support available for concrete5. The recommended place to check first is the Free 
Help page under the Support tab (Figure 8-4). The documentation provides access to images, videos, code 
samples, etc. The Forum is another place to seek help from other users. If you’re familiar with IRC (Internet 
Relay Chat), there is an active community on the freenode network willing to help out: it can be accessed 
at irc.freenode.org, #concrete5. There are also plenty of tutorial videos posted on YouTube that will help 
you get up and running quickly.

GetSimple CMS: A Simple, Open Source Content 
Management System
GetSimple CMS (not to be confused with GetSimple.net, a web hosting service) is a free and open source 
website content management system. Early versions were designed for the “1 to 15 page brochure site,” and 
elaborate features were left out in favor of simplicity.
Here are a few facts about GetSimple CMS at a glance:
• 
Website: http://get-simple.info
• 
License: GPL 3, Open Source, Get-Simple.info
• 
Operating System: Cross-platform
GetSimple CMS is intended to be simple, fast, and easy to use. Based on PHP and released under the 
General Public license (GNU), GetSimple saves all data to structured XML files instead of using a database 
to store information. By doing this, it makes the application belong to the group of flat file web applications, 
which can be run without a database. Important to note, the system’s memory footprint is low, which makes 
it suitable to be installed within a shared hosting situation. It provides online documentation in a wiki form, 
and an active community can be located on the GetSimple website.
Feature Highlights
Here are some of the features offered by GetSimple CMS, adapted from the website:
• 
Has proven to be highly extensible, and many important features can be added as 
plug-ins
• 
A MySQL database is not required
• 
Integrated backup system

• 
WYSIWYG text editor, CK editor
• 
Image and file management
• 
Single-level menu management
• 
Theme selector and editor
• 
Plug-in manager
• 
Component editor
The original concept was simply to provide a way to maintain a website without knowledge of HTML 
via a program that presented a clear, user-friendly interface. In order to create a new GetSimple website, you 
must know how to use FTP and have a basic knowledge of HTML.
To check out the GetSimpleCMS demo, go to OpenSourceCMS.com. You’ll be provided with a generic 
username, password, and control panel link.
Once you upload the system files to a web server, the setup is complete. The final configuration is made 
easy by using the system’s web-based install wizard; some hosting providers offer preconfigured GetSimple 
installations.
An XML-based, stand-alone program that doesn’t use MySQL to store information, GetSimple is a fully 
independent and light content management system. The interface has been loaded with features that every 
website needs, but with nothing it doesn’t. It is considered by most to be truly the simplest way to manage a 
small business website. Since it doesn’t need a MySQL database, it was built specifically for the small  
site market.
To prevent problems, GetSimple has included “undo” into almost every action you can take, keeping 
you free from headaches when those inevitable mistakes are made. Since you can “undo” pretty much 
anything you do, this feature is based on eye-opening ideas such as explaining how warning messages never 
work as planned.
One of the top priorities of Helge Sverre, the developer of GetSimple CMS, was to design a user interface 
that was simply the best in its class. As he states in the GetSimple CMS Mission Statement, “I want our admin 
panel and UI to be better designed than any other comparable CMS out there. This may be more selfish than 
anything, but what designer wants his/her client to log into the admin panel and see a cluttered mess of 
cheap, non-intuitive icons that give no value to what that client needs to do? From studying my competing 
20 CMSs over the last couple months, this should not be hard.”
One of its goals is not to bloat its software with hundreds of little-used theme functions, so GetSimple 
provides “how to” documents showing how to create a custom theme (Figure 8-5).
Because it was specifically designed for the small site market, GetSimple utilizes XML rather than a 
larger, perhaps overwhelming, database such as MySQL. The majority of small businesses only need to be 
able to easily update the site; they don’t require many extraneous and rarely used features. GetSimple’s 
ultimate goal is to assist in managing small websites efficiently and effectively.

GetSimpleCMS Support
The best place to start is the Documentation and User Guide Wiki. There you will find information about 
what GetSimple CMS is for, what others are saying about it, and getting started.
There is an active community on the Support Forum where help can be sought out if needed. 
Additionally, there are also several helpful video tutorials on YouTube that will get you up and running in 
short order.3
Summary
In this chapter, you looked at three free options for content management systems. For those seeking 
alternatives to paid systems, Drupal, concrete5, and GetSimple CMS are great options.
In the next chapter, you’ll take a look at several options for network security, password security, and free 
anti-virus programs.

Network and Security Utilities
Security is always a high priority in business. If you’re on budget, but you require solutions for areas such as 
network security, password security, antivirus and mobile device privacy, there are some no-cost options. 
Here’s a look at the software programs covered in this chapter:
Network Security Auditing:
• 
Nmap: A free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing
Password Management:
• 
KeePass: A free and open source password manager that can be helpful for keeping 
your passwords secure if you have an online presence
Packet Analyzer:
• 
Tcpdump: A powerful command line packet analyzer
Antivirus Protection:
• 
Avira: Powerful, free antivirus Protection for PC and Mac
• 
Clam AV: An open source cross platform antivirus solution
Android and iPhone Privacy:
• 
Open Whisper Systems: Open source security for mobile devices helps keep your 
texts and conversations private and secure
Nmap: A Free and Open Source Utility for Network 
Discovery/Security Auditing
The primary purpose of the Nmap application is security auditing by detecting and locating hosts and 
services on any given computer network (Figure 9-1). In order to do this, Nmap sends packets that are 
specifically tailored to the target host, at which point the responses are analyzed. Host discovery and service, 
and operating system detection, are among the many features Nmap offers for probing computer networks. 
During a scan, Nmap acclimates to various network conditions, such as latency and congestion. While a 
professional developer originally wrote this software, Nmap is now further developed and refined by the 
user community.

Nmap is commonly used to audit the security of a device or firewall by identifying the potential network 
connections. Determining open ports on a target host is another regular use, as are network inventory, 
network mapping, maintenance, and asset management. While identifying new servers and generating 
traffic, the security is regularly being audited by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a network.
Some facts about Nmap at a glance:
• 
Website: https://nmap.org
• 
License: GPL Version 2
• 
Current Version: 6.49
• 
Operating System: Cross-platform
Users will find many benefits to using Nmap. For example, it has a simple installation and front end. 
With minimal effort, it will give a strong result, making it one of the easiest software products available. 
Nmap will map the network and ports with the number one port scanning tool.
Feature Highlights
Here are some of the features offered by Nmap:
• 
Host discovery: This allows the program to identify hosts on the network.
• 
Port scanning: This application can’t estimate the open ports on target hosts.
• 
Version detection: Nmap can retrieve data network services on remote devices, and 
then determine the application name and version number.
• 
OS detection: This feature allows the determination of the operating system and 
hardware characteristics of network devices.
Figure 9-1.  Nmap conducts security audits by detecting and locating hosts and services on computer networks

Chapter 9 ■ Network and Security Utilities
191
• 
Scriptable target interaction: By using the Nmap scripting engineer and Lua 
programming language, Nmap can further provide information on targets, including 
reverse DNS names, MAC addresses, and device types.
• 
NSE scripts: This feature can detect vulnerabilities, misconfiguration, and  
security-related information around network services.
Nmap was created to quickly scan large networks. It is because of this that it is regularly used for 
network inventory security audits. While doing this, the user is able to see what types of services a host is 
using. It is quite remarkable that when one scans a large network, the hosts appear; and for each one, data 
is provided regarding which OS is running, the service and version of that OS, which firewall is used, etc. 
This information is meaningful because some older versions may have known security issues that could 
damage the entire machine. Armed with this knowledge, you can update to the latest version, decreasing the 
potential for harm.
Nmap displays detected ports in a table. For each port that is detected, a list of the port’s number, 
protocol, state, and version is displayed. The state can be listed as open, closed, filtered, or unfiltered. The 
difference between open and closed ports is that open ports listen for packets or connections on that port, 
while there is no such service on closed ports. On filtered ports, there is a firewall blocking Nmap, preventing 
it from detecting if it is open or closed. When the port is responsive to Nmap’s probes (but whether open or 
closed is undetermined), Nmap will classify that port as unfiltered. While this does occasionally happen, it is 
very rare; the status of ports usually falls under the categories of open, closed, or filtered.
Nmap offers additional information on targets. This could consist of reverse DNS names, device types, 
operating system guesses, and MAC addresses. Finding a MAC address and reverse DNS appear to be the 
most highly-utilized features by consumers. Nmap’s attempts to guess the OS can be a bit hit-and-miss, but 
that occurs even with expensive programs.
For those new to Nmap, the front end is convenient. You can easily use it to pass different preconfigured 
parameters to Nmap without remembering any commands, and it offers a comprehensive set of options.  
A convenient feature is that the program highlights some of the info in different colors so you can read it easier.
There are many benefits to using Nmap. To begin, it is powerful enough to satisfy most individual’s 
needs but it offers a simple installation process. It is also one of the smallest software packages of its kind 
(0.6 MB) and can be easily deployed in mini-distributions. Nmap is considered one of the best software 
applications for security auditing, and it can definitely be a good starting point for people who want to 
explore security options.
The only drawback in functionality is Nmap’s OS guessing game, mentioned above. Additionally, a more 
aesthetically pleasing, sleek front-end would create a better first impression of this program.
Nmap Support
Becoming familiar with the Reference Guide is always recommended. There are a good number of tutorial 
videos on YouTube that should prove useful.
Keepass: A Free and Open-Source Password Manager
KeePass is a vital security management tool. Professionals suggest that one of the most important things to 
do is to protect one’s online security. Assigning a unique, lengthy, randomized password for every single site 
or account you use, and keeping track of the all those passwords, would pose a challenge for even the most 
organized person. This is where KeePass comes in handy.
KeePass is a free and open-source password manager that is compatible with the following: Windows, 
Linux, Android, Mac OS X, and with unofficial ports for iOS.

Here are a few facts about Keepass at a glance:
• 
Alternative to: Steganos Password Manager 16
• 
Website: www.keepass.info
• 
License: GNU GPL Version 2+
• 
Current Version: 2.29
• 
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
• 
Potential Savings: $24.99 (5 PC Edition of Password Manager 16)
Keepass is a very handy application. Instead of writing passwords down here and there (and worrying 
about where they are when you can’t find them), Keepass assists you by storing all of your passwords 
securely in the program’s database. You need to remember only one “master” password to access your 
stored passwords (Figure 9-2).
Figure 9-2.  Keepass stores all of the passwords you create, so you only need to remember one master password
Feature Highlights
Here are the main features of Keepass:
• 
Password management: Passwords stored in this application’s database can be 
further divided into manageable groups. Each group can have its own separate 
identifying icon.
• 
Extensible: Offers a number of different configuration options.
• 
Tracks passwords: KeePass tracks the creation time, modification time, last access 
time, and expiration time of each password stored, allowing you to attach and store a 
password on files and text notes.
• 
Import and export: The password list is exportable to various formats, such as TXT, 
HTML, XML, and CSV.
• 
Multiuser support: This application supports simultaneous access and changes  
to a shared password file by utilizing multiple computers, often using a shared 
network drive.

• 
Autotype, global hotkeys, drag-and-drop: KeePass provides support for these 
features. KeePass can minimize itself and type the information of the currently 
selected entry into such things as dialogs, web forms, etc.
• 
Browser support: The available autotype functionality works very well with all 
browsers. There is a Keeform extension that allows users to open websites with 
Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. For Firefox, there is an additional extension 
called KeeFox, which will automatically connect to KeePass when a user needs 
access to a password.
• 
Built-in password generator: This generates random passwords, and random 
seating is available for user input.
• 
Plug-ins: KeePass possesses a plug-in architecture, and there are a variety of  
plug-ins available on the KeePass homepage. One thing to bear in mind is that 
plug-ins may compromise the security of KeePass because they are written by 
independent authors, and these authors have full access to the database while 
developing their plug-ins.
Unlike other competitors, KeePass doesn’t automatically put your password database in the cloud, 
although another option is to put your password into Dropbox manually.
KeePass presents its own random password generator to ensure the user doesn’t have to take on the 
arduous task of coming up with, and then remembering, countless lengthy, complex passwords on their 
own. Additionally, KeePass includes a quick-search box where one can type even a fragment of a website’s 
name to quickly find it on the list. The list itself is created to contain thousands of records, which can be 
subdivided into folders and subfolders, keeping things organized.
KeePass isn’t just limited to usernames and passwords; every entry has multiple alternate fields, one of 
which is a free-form Notes field which allows the safe storing of text of any kind.
One technique hackers use to circumvent password protection is to use a keylogger. A keylogger is a 
background application that secretly logs every keystroke that is typed, and that information is transmitted 
to the hacker. If a keylogger is installed on a user’s system, an attacker could conceivably learn everything 
that was typed throughout the day, including all usernames and passwords.
Another protection feature that Keepass offers is its AutoType feature. This feature prevents the user 
from having to type individual website passwords by pasting them into the browser window and applying a 
combination of virtual keystrokes and clipboard obfuscation, making it all the more difficult for a keylogger 
to figure out what the password actually is. While AutoType can be temperamental, when it does work, it’s 
extremely useful.
KeePass also lets the user enter their master database password in a prompt that is protected by UAC. 
This protects it from any software keylogger that isn’t running with Administrator rights on the machine.
Keepass is recommended to anyone with an online presence (no matter how small) because, when 
a major website has its security breached, users of Keepass are unaffected, knowing their personal 
information remains safe and secure.
In summation, KeePass is a quality, easy-to-use, password protection system. There seem to be few 
bugs with the program, but there are many great security benefits. Whether a business or an individual, extra 
password protection is very important, especially in these times of rampant hacking. KeePass can offer peace 
of mind regarding your computer’s safety.
Keepass Support
Keepass is a relatively easy program to come to grips with, but if you get stuck, the Help Center can be  
found at http://keepass.info/help. The FAQ page is another source of assistance, as are the numerous 
YouTube tutorials.

tcpdump: A Powerful Command Line Packet Analyzer
tcpdump was designed for users that need to analyze network traffic by capturing packets from a certain 
adapter. It is a network sniffer tool, and it can capture all the data packets that are transmitted or received 
through a network adapter. The program is executable in command line mode, and it allows the user to 
perform multiple actions by using arguments.
Information regarding captured packets may be viewed in real time using the command prompt 
window or recorded to a log file to assist in analyzing the packets at a later date.
Here are a few facts about tcpdump at a glance:
• 
Website: www.tcpdump.org
• 
License: BSD License
• 
Current Version: 4.7.4 / 1.7.4
• 
Operating System(s): Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Open BSD, OS X, Android, 
AIX, and others
tcpdump works on most UNIX-like operating systems (see above). When used in those systems, 
tcpdump uses the libpcap library to capture packets. The software provider’s website indicates that the port 
utilized by tcpdump for Windows is called WinDump, which usesWinPcap, the Windows port of libpcap.
Feature Highlights
Here are a few of the features found in this program:
• 
Powerful command-line packet analyzer: tcpdump works with libpcap, a portable 
C/C++ library, for network traffic capture.
• 
Can run remotely: through an SSH or Telnet.
• 
Writes packets to standard output/file: tcpdump prints the contents of network 
packets, and it can also read packets from a network interface card, or even from a 
previously created saved packet file.
• 
Monitor communications: It is possible to use this program for the specific purpose 
of intercepting and displaying the communications of another user or computer.
• 
Optional BPF-based filter: The user may add this filter to limit the number of 
packets seen by tcpdump. This does render the output more usable on networks with 
a high volume of traffic
The information on the software provider’s website indicates that Tcpdump works on most UNIX-like 
operating systems. When used in those systems, tcpdump uses the libpcap library to capture packets. The 
port utilized by tcpdump for Windows is called WinDump, which usesWinPcap, the Windows port of libpcap.
tcpdump Support
The documentation for tcpdump (www.tcpdump.org/index.html#documentation) is a good starting point, 
and the FAQ is also a source of help (www.tcpdump.org/faq.html). There are quite a few video introductions 
and tutorials on YouTube as well.

ClamAV: An Open Source Cross-Platform (Including Linux) 
Antivirus Program
ClamAV is a cross-platform, free, open-source antivirus software toolkit used by millions of people. It is 
capable of detecting a wide variety of malicious software, including viruses.
Here are a few facts about ClamAV at a glance:
• 
Website: www.clamav.net
• 
License: GPL
• 
Current Version: 0.98.7
• 
Operating System(s): Windows, Mac OS, Linux, BSD, Solaris
A primary purpose of ClamAV is on mail servers, where it acts as a server-side email virus scanner 
(Figure 9-4). ClamAV was created for Unix, but third-party versions are available for AIX, HP-UX, Linux, 
BSD, OS X, OpenVMS, Solaris, and OSF (True 64). Starting with version 0.97.5, ClamAV is also available for 
Microsoft Windows. Not only is the initial program free, but future updates will be available at no cost.

Chapter 9 ■ Network and Security Utilities
197
It should be kept in mind, however, that ClamAV is not a real-time virus scanner, meaning it does not 
scan when a file is read or written. To provide real-time checks, ClamAV can be used with other applications 
such as ClamFS (for a Unix-like OS supporting FUSE), DazukoFS (for Linux), Clam Sentinel (for Windows), 
and Winpooch (also for Windows).
The ClamAV engine can be dependably used to identify several kinds of files. Specifically, some 
phishing emails can be exposed using antivirus techniques. It should be noted, however, that false positive 
rates are inherently higher than those of traditional malware detection.
Despite that, ClamAV is both widely known and widely respected, keeping it in the forefront of the 
antivirus market. There are many reasons for ClamAV’s continued success; the main ones are the following: 
simple installation, easy to launch, compatible with almost all MTAs, solid protection, customization, and 
the economic fact that it costs nothing.
Feature Highlights
Here are the higlights as shown on the ClamAV website:
• 
Command-line scanner
• 
Melcher interface for sending mail
• 
Advanced database updates with support for scripted updates in digital signatures
• 
Virus database updated multiple times per day
• 
Built-in support for all standard mail file formats
•

secure “free, worldwide, encrypted voice calls for iPhone, and is fully compatible with RedPhone for Android.”
Open Whisper Systems Support
On the Support page, you can type in a question or search term, and you’ll be directed to the forum where 
topics related to yours are displayed. You’ll also have access to numerous articles covering various aspects 
such as general questions, security, etc. Although there don’t seem to be many video tutorials on YouTube, 
there are one or two that provide some general information.
Summary
In this chapter, you looked a several solutions for various security measures. Nmap provides network 
auditing and detection. Keepass is an excellent program that manages important passwords and keeps them 
secure; you only need to keep up with a master password, and not worry about remembering the rest.
Analyzing packets with tcpdump allows the user to display the packets being transmitted or received 
on a network. Avira (although licensed only for personal use) is an excellent, free antivirus program ideal 
for computers that don’t frequent the Internet very much. ClamAV is an open source antivirus program that 
can be installed on numerous operating systems. Open Whisper Systems provides several applications for 
Android mobile phones and Apple iPhones to help keep texts and conversations secure and private.
In the next chapter, you’ll look at several Linux distributions, which, for many users throughout the world, 
are viable alternatives to the Windows and Mac computer operating systems.

Linux: The Free Alternative to 
Windows and Mac OS
Microsoft Windows and Macintosh need no introduction. Certainly, most readers of this book are using 
Windows and the others are no doubt using a Mac. You may be wondering why anyone would consider 
using a different operating system. While Linux isn’t for everyone, it offers some advantages that are well 
worth considering, such as security and free software.
This chapter introduces the reader to Linux: what it is, how it is used, and a brief history about how 
it came into existence. We’ll then look at the advantages Linux offers over its well-known proprietary 
counterparts.
This chapter provides an in-depth look at Ubuntu, ostensibly the most popular Linux distribution in the 
world. We’ll also take a brief look at two other Linux distributions: Zorin OS and Linux Mint.
What Is Linux?
The odds are good that you’ve heard of Linux and know that it’s related to computers. First, it should be 
pointed out that Linux actually refers to the kernel, or “core” code around which Linux distributions are built.
Essentially, Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system that falls under the model of free and open 
source software development and distribution, just like the open source software discussed in this book. 
There are many variations of Linux known as distributions, or distros as they’re called in the parlance of 
those active in the Linux communities. With a few exceptions, Linux distributions are available at no cost 
(but donations are gladly accepted).
Linux plays a major role behind the scenes of a number of products you probably know. The ubiquitous 
Android operating system on of millions of mobile devices (Figure 10-1) is based on the Linux kernel. Linux.
com (www.linux.com/learn/new-user-guides) names several other Linux-based products such as TiVo 
digital recorders, Volvo in-car navigation systems, and Sony Bravia televisions.

Linux is the force behind millions of laptop and desktop computers all over the world. One of the most 
popular distributions (if not the most popular) is Ubuntu (Figure 10-2). There are many other popular Linux 
distributions as well: Debian (the distribution upon which Ubuntu is derived), Linux Mint, Zorin, Fedora, 
and others.
Figure 10-1.  Android mobile devices are among the numerous Linux-based products

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
203
As mentioned in the Introduction, several city governments throughout Europe have chosen to run 
their computers using Linux (primarily Ubuntu) instead of Microsoft Windows. The savings they enjoy in 
licensing fees are significant (not to mention the free productivity software that comes bundled with most 
Linux distributions).
In addition to mobile devices, electronic products, laptop and desktop computers, Linux also runs 
many of the servers in use (Figure 10-3). IBM provides full Linux support for all of its server platforms. 
Ubuntu Server is significant; according to Ubuntu’s website, “Ubuntu Server is the world’s leading cloud 
guest OS, running the majority of workloads in public clouds today, thanks to its security, versatility, and 
regular updates.”
Figure 10-2.  Ubuntu is a highly popular Linux distribution used on millions of computers
Figure 10-3.  Many servers in use are powered by Linux
The majority of Linux distributions use a GUI (graphical user interface). There are several desktop 
environments that vary from one Linux distribution to another. The Zorin OS (which is covered in greater 
detail later in this chapter) is a Linux distribution that can be configured to resemble the look of Windows 7 
(Figure 10-4) or Windows XP to ease newcomers into Linux.

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
204
Linux systems typically employ a command line feature called terminal (Figure 10-5). It resembles the 
old DOS interface that predates Microsoft Windows. The terminal provides the user access to the system 
underneath the graphical interface. Although many Linux users go through their computing lives without 
ever (or rarely using) this command line interface, there are occasions when using it is necessary (such as 
the installation of certain software programs). It’s a good idea for new Linux users to become familiar with 
the terminal feature.

A Brief History of Linux
The history of Linux is actually a fairly long story, so I will provide a very short synopsis. The origin of 
Linux goes back to 1991 when a Finnish student at the University of Helsinki named Linus Torvalds was 
working on a personal project. He was developing a free operating system kernel that anyone could build 
upon. Around the same time, the GNU project started by Richard Stallman in 1983 was developing a free 
Unix-like operating system. They were near completion, but were lacking a kernel for the operating system. 
Eventually, the two projects were integrated and a complete operating system was born. If you’re interested 
in reading a more detailed account, go to the GNU Operating System website at www.gnu.org and click the 
tab titled A Historical Overview of GNU.
■
■Note   According to the GNU Operating System website (and despite the fact that the term Linux is so 
widely used), the proper designation for the operating system is GNU/Linux. Also, the terms distribution and 
operating system are used synonymously in the Linux world.
In the early days of Linux, it required operators who were knowledgeable in computer programing to 
use it. Because it fell under the terms of the GNU License, anyone with programing skills could alter it to suit 
their needs. Over the years, many distributions have been developed that have become more user-friendly.
Distributions such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint have done a great deal to increase the popularity of Linux 
over the past several years. Although this is debatable (at least, for the time being), some proponents of 
Linux believe it will surpass Windows as a mainstream operating system. It may never reach that level, but it 
has certainly made some great strides, and it’s presumable that it will continue to grow and improve.
The Advantages of Using Linux
There are numerous advantages to using Linux. One of the biggest is the availability of support from 
the community. Each distribution has its own website and user community forum, and Linux users are 
committed to the further development and growth of their preferred distribution. Some people (myself 
included) use more than one Linux distribution.
Here are several other advantages that using a Linux operating system offers:
• 
With a few exceptions, Linux distributions are free. Most Linux distributions are 
free to install; use it on one or multiple computers without paying licensing fees.
• 
Try it out without installing. Most Linux distributions can be tried out on your 
computer (without installing anything or making changes) by using a live CD, DVD, 
or USB stick. When using a live disc, the response time is much slower, but it does 
provide a general experience of trying it out. If you decide to, you can install Linux 
from the live disc or USB stick.
• 
Linux is highly secure and stable. Generally speaking, Linux systems aren’t 
besieged with the number of viruses, Trojan horses, and malware that plague 
Windows. While Linux isn’t always immune to these problems (and anti-virus 
protection is always warranted), because most attacks target Windows systems there 
are far fewer malicious programs that wreak havoc with Linux systems. Another perk 
is that Linux-based operating systems tend to be very stable and reliable.

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
207
• 
There are many software titles available to suit most purposes. Linux distributions 
typically come bundled with useful software, such as GIMP, LibreOffice, and other 
titles. Software is easy to acquire by using the distribution’s software repositories. 
Some software titles are available for a small fee, and many others are free.
• 
Strong community support. Each Linux distribution has a community of users that 
are willing to help newcomers. There are also plenty of overview and instructional 
videos on YouTube covering just about every Linux distribution.
• 
Install Linux alongside your current operating system. Many people decide that 
they like Linux, but can’t bring themselves to give up Windows. The good news is, 
you don’t have to. Linux systems can typically be installed along side your Windows 
(or Mac) operating system. With a dual boot system, you’ll be presented with a 
choice of which operating system to launch.
• 
Older computers can be revitalized with Linux. There are several lightweight Linux 
distributions (such as Puppy Linux or Lubuntu) that run well on older computers 
that are too underpowered for most modern operating systems (but are otherwise 
perfectly good machines). This is a great way to recycle older computers and relegate 
them to light duty, such as email, surfing the web, and word processing (Figure 10-7).
Figure 10-7.  Older, lower spec computers can be revitalized by using one of the lightweight Linux distributions 
and relegating them to light duty, such as email, web browsing, and word processing
Another distinct advantage of Linux is that if you aren’t satisfied with a particular distribution, you can 
always try another one; it doesn’t cost anything except a little investment in time and perhaps a blank DVD. 
Each distribution has its strengths and weaknesses, so it’s important to use the one that serves you in the 
best way possible. A helpful website to compare Linux distributions is DisrtoWatch.com  
(http://distrowatch.com). Simply select the distribution you’re interested in, and it provides a summary, 
relevant websites, popularity, etc.
Another resource to help the newcomer become better acquainted with Linux in general is the New 
User Guides page of the Linux.com website (www.linux.com/learn/new-user-guides).

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
208
The next section of this chapter looks closely at Ubuntu, arguably the most popular Linux distribution 
in the world. It also looks quickly at two other popular distributions, Zorin OS and Linux Mint. This will help 
illustrate how Linux distributions can differ from one another.
■
■Tip   Do you have an older (but perfectly good) Windows XP laptop or desktop computer you haven’t 
used since Microsoft ceased offering support for the XP platform? Bring it back to life by trying out one of the 
lightweight Linux distributions; you might be able to delay the need to purchase a new computer for a long while.
Ubuntu: Powering Millions of Laptops and Desktop 
Computers Around the World
This is the claim made on Ubuntu’s website. Ubuntu has become one of the most popular Linux distribution 
over the past several years. First released in 2004, Ubuntu (the Long Term Support version is currently 14.04) 
is designed to be a user friendly, general purpose operating system. Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian, a 
popular Linux distribution backed by a strong community.
Ease of Use
Ubuntu’s ease of use adds to its popularity throughout the world. It even comes preinstalled on some laptop 
computers from manufacturers such as Dell, HP, and Lenovo.
Ubuntu employs the Unity user interface, which is a graphical shell of the GNOME desktop 
environment. GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment, essentially a graphical user 
interface developed for Linux by the GNOME Project. It’s designed to provide Ubuntu as easily as possible. 
One way in which this is achieved is by docking the launcher icons on the far left of the screen. There’s also a 
choice of wallpapers to customize the background in the Appearance settings. (Figure 10-8). The size of the 
launcher icons can be adjusted by using the slider control.

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
209
Ubuntu Dashboard and Desktop
Ubuntu’s dashboard (Figure 10-9) is a search feature that employs Smart Filters, making it easy to find 
content stored on your computer or on the Web. The Smart Scopes server returns the most relevant results 
based on your search query. It learns from your past search queries, making it more accurate over time.
Figure 10-8.  The launcher icons are docked on the left of the screen. The background can be customized with 
a choice of wallpapers

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
210
The desktop environment differs somewhat from that of Windows or Macintosh. The program launch 
icons are docked on the left side of the screen. Even though this might seem a bit unfamiliar at first for those 
new to Ubuntu, you will quickly grow accustomed to it.
There are a number of wallpapers available to customize the appearance to your liking.
Downloading and Installing Ubuntu
Ubuntu is free to download from the official website (www.ubuntu.com). There are two “flavors” available:  
32-bit and 64-bit. The 32-bit version is for older computers with less than 2GB of RAM (Figure 10-10).  
The 64-bit version is for newer, more powerful machines. Ubuntu 14.04 is the Long Term Support version, 
which guarantees regular security and maintenance updates for five years.
Figure 10-9.  Ubuntu’s Dashboard makes searching for content easy

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
211
■
■Note  The newest, most cutting-edge version of Ubuntu is 15.04, but it is only supported for nine months. 
However, it is recommended that new users download version 14.04 for long-term support.
After selecting the version of Ubuntu you want to install, it will be necessary to either burn the ISO file 
to a DVD or create a bootable USB stick. There are specific instructions on the Ubuntu website for how to 
accomplish this for switching from either Windows, Mac, or even an older version of Ubuntu (Figure 10-11).
Figure 10-10.  The 64-bit version of Ubuntu is for newer, high spec computers while the 32-bit version is for 
machines with less than 2GB of RAM

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
212
■
■Note  Ubuntu can be tried out by running it from either the disc or USB stick without making changes 
to your computer. Also, if you’re not quite ready to give up using Windows (or Mac), Ubuntu can be installed 
alongside your current operating system, resulting in a dual boot system.
Ubuntu Software and Software Center
While Microsoft Windows is still by far the dominant force in the computing industry, there are millions of 
people (as well as businesses and city governments throughout Europe) who have embraced Ubuntu as a 
viable alternative to Windows. Ubuntu comes preloaded with lots of useful software. There are hundreds, if 
not thousands, of other software titles available from the Software Center.
Figure 10-11.  Ubuntu’s website provides details about burning an installation DVD or creating a bootable 
USB stick

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS

One of the most significant programs that comes preinstalled in Ubuntu is LibreOffice, the open source 
office productivity suite (Figure 10-12). LibreOffice is discussed in detail in Chapter 1 of this book.
Figure 10-12.  The powerful LibreOffice is one of the software programs preinstalled in Ubuntu
Figure 10-13.  Brasero Disc Burner utility
Ubuntu also comes with software to view and manage photos, video, and audio. Shotwell Photo 
Manager acquires images from digital cameras and keeps them organized. Openshot is a basic video editing 
program (similar to Microsoft Movie Maker in Windows). Rhythmbox is a nice utility for playing MP3 files. 
Brasero is a disc burning program that handles all of the functions necessary for writing and copying music 
CDs, data discs, and DVDs (Figure 10-13).

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS

There are many other software titles available from the Ubuntu Software Center (Figure 10-14). For 
example, if you need a vector drawing program such as Inkscape, it can be acquired from the Software 
Center (Figure 10-10). Clicking the More Info button shows a complete description of the software program 
is displayed. If it will suit your needs, just press Install and the program will be installed in short order.
Figure 10-14.  Acquiring and installing software from the Software Center is an easy process
This process is actually quite different from installing software on Windows or Mac systems; it’s easier. 
Other useful software programs that can be found in the Software Center are GIMP (for editing photos), 
Kdenlive (for editing video), Krita (a digital drawing and painting program), and many others. There are also 
a variety of games available for download.
■
■Note  Not all of the software programs available in the Software Center are free, but the majority of them are.
Running Windows Applications on WINE
Despite all of the software available for Ubuntu, some users may still be locked into using a particular 
Windows program. Yet another perk for Ubuntu and other Linux distributions is the ability to run many 
legacy Windows software programs on Linux using a compatibility layer program called WINE. WINE 
actually stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator, and it is free, open source software that has been around since 
1993. WINE can be acquired from the Software Center or from the WINE website (www.winehq.org/).
WINE won’t support all Windows programs, so it’s not a perfect solution. It is an ever evolving project, 
so in many cases in which a particular Windows program is a must, it might just fill the bill. The WINE 
website provides information about compatibility.
Security
Ubuntu, like other Linux distributions, is very secure, relatively speaking. Anyone who has used Windows 
for any length of time is aware of the many threats that abound: viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, etc. 
Virus removal is a very high-demand service offered by many computer repair shops. Even the Mac OS is 
more open to attack these days.

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
215
Linux isn’t targeted nearly as much as Windows. Of course, Linux can still be vulnerable to attack.  
As secure as Linux distributions are, anti-virus protection is still warranted.
If it’s not already installed, there is a free program called ClamTk available to download from the 
Software Center (Figure 10-15).
Figure 10-15.  ClamTk is available to download from the Software Center
The interface is basic and straightforward (Figure 10-16); you can download updates, schedule specific 
times for the software to run, scan files and directories, etc.

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
216
Accessory Compatibility
Ubuntu 14.04 is highly compatible with most devices, such as routers, printers, wireless Wi-Fi adapters, and 
cameras. The list goes on. If it has a USB connection, Ubuntu will most likely detect it (Figure 10-17).
Figure 10-16.  The ClamTk interface is basic and straightforward
Figure 10-17.  Ubuntu is very compatible with most accessories and devices

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
217
■
■Note  Ubuntu can detect some older devices that Windows might not. For example, Ubuntu can detect my 
old 2005 model Canon Digital Rebel, but my Windows 7 system does not recognize it at all.
Ubuntu Support
Ubuntu is an easy-to-use operating system. If you are proficient using Windows or Mac, Ubuntu will be 
somewhat different, but most people can come to grips with it quickly. There are plenty of avenues to purse 
for support when it’s needed. Ubuntu has a strong user base and a very helpful community. The Ask Ubuntu 
section of the website (https://askubuntu.com/) is a great starting point (Figure 10-18). YouTube hosts a 
plethora of introductory and instructional videos covering Ubuntu.
Figure 10-18.  The Ask Ubuntu section of the website offers a great deal of support
Canonical (www.canonical.com) is the company behind Ubuntu. Canonical’s flagship service, Ubuntu 
Advantage, offers paid support to enterprises and businesses that use Ubuntu’s desktop OS, server, and 
cloud. Canonical’s website states that it serves enterprises both large and small.
Zorin OS: Especially for Newcomers to Linus
Zorin OS (now in version 9) is another Linux distribution worth investigating. It’s primarily designed for 
newcomers to Linux, especially those accustomed to working in a Windows environment. Zorin OS is based 
on Ubuntu, but it has its own developers, support, and community. The official Zorin OS website is  
http://zorin-os.com/index.html.

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
218
Zorin OS comes in several versions, four of them are free and two are paid premium versions.  
All versions have WINE preinstalled to run many legacy Windows applications.
• 
Zorin 9 OS Core (32- or 64-bit): This general-purpose version provides all of the 
essential functions and software most users would need (comparable to Ubuntu).
• 
Zorin 9 OS Educational (32- or 64-bit): This version is geared toward use in schools, 
colleges, and other educational institutions. It comes with learning applications for 
science, math, geography, and languages.
• 
Zorin 9 OS Lite (32-bit only): This version is designed for older, lower spec 
computers. It provides the essentials needed for web browsing, creating documents, 
viewing photos, and other functions without the heavier applications.
• 
Zorin 9 OS Lite Educational (32-bit only): This version is the Lite version of Zorin 
OS, plus the educational programs.
• 
Zorin 9 OS Ultimate (32- or 64-bit): This is a paid version of Zorin OS that includes 
all of the software that comes with the free version, but also includes extra software 
for gaming and multimedia.
• 
Zorin 9 OS Business (32- or 64-bit): This is a paid version Zorin OS geared for 
business use. It also has all of the software included in the free version, but includes 
a variety of applications for accounting and bookkeeping, stock analysis, database, 
retail, word processing, and spreadsheets, among others.
Like Ubuntu 14.04, all of the Zorin 9 OS editions receive long-term support in the form of regular software 
updates and security updates until 2019. Technical support is offered for the paid editions of Zorin OS.
The Look Changer
The Look Changer allows Zorin OS to emulate the look of Windows (or Mac OS X, in some editions), 
providing the user with a familiar desktop environment. Figure 10-19 displays the options for changing the 
look to Windows 7, Windows XP, or GNOME 2.

219
■
■Note  In the Lite Editions of Zorin OS, the Look Changer offers a choice of changing the look to resemble 
either Mac OS X or Windows 2000. The Premium editions offer additional options to give the Zorin OS a  
different look.
In the Windows 7 mode, the menu shown in Figure 10-20 bears a resemblance to the Windows 7 Start Menu.

■
■Note   If you’ve already installed Ubuntu, you can try Zorin OS from the live DVD. If you like Zorin OS but 
don’t want to remove Ubuntu, it can be installed alongside Ubuntu.
If you’d like to download a paid version (Figure 10-22), click the version of your choice. Zorin OS 9 
Ultimate is 9.99 Eur (about 11.14 USD). Zorin OS 9 Business is 8.99 Eur (about 10.02 USD). You’ll be directed 
to PayPal to make your payment.

Linux Mint: A Modern, Elegant Operating System
Linux Mint is ostensibly the third largest desktop operation system after Windows and Mac in terms of user 
base. This distribution designed to be clean, modern, and easy to use. There are actually several versions of 
Linux Mint, each sporting a different desktop environment based on either Ubuntu or Debian. Figure 10-24 
displays the Cinnamon version of the desktop.

223
Linux Mint is aimed primarily at home users, but it can be used in a business environment. Like Ubuntu 
and Zorin OS, there is long-term support for Linux Mint. Applications are launched from the pop-up Menu 
button (Figure 10-25) on the task bar located on the lower left corner of the screen.

Chapter 10 ■ Linux: The Free Alternative to Windows and Mac OS
224
■
■Note   Part of Linux Mint’s appeal is the resemblance of the application launch menu to the Start menu 
used on Windows. Like Zorin OS, this helps provide a familiar environment for Linux newcomers.
Like other Linux distributions, Mint comes preloaded with software packages for viewing photos, 
creating documents, etc. Additional software can be acquired from Mint’s software repositories by launching 
the Software Manager (Figure 10-26). The menu displays a list of software categories to help you narrow 
down your search. Using the keyword search feature will pull up a list of the applications that best match 
your request.

If you don’t have access to a broadband internet connection, an installation DVD can be purchased for 
a nominal fee from OSDisc.com. This provider sells installation discs for other Linux distributions as well.  
To order a disc, click the Buy CDs tab on the website, or go to www.osdisc.com/products/linux/ 
linuxmint?affiliate=linuxmint.
■
■Note  It’s suggested in the Linux Mint User Guide that if you’re unsure which edition to download, the MATE 
version is the best choice since it offers the greatest hardware compatibility.
Linux Mint Support
The comprehensive Linux Mint User Guide is available in multiple languages as a PDF download under 
the Documentation tab (Figure 10-28) on the website. After a brief introduction, it guides the reader in the 
installation process, getting to know the desktop environment, and managing software.

Because Linux Mint is so popular, there’s an abundance of help available; click the Community tab 
to access the forum, blog, and other avenues of information. YouTube hosts plenty of videos pertaining to 
Linux Mint, including overviews, comparisons of the different versions, and instructional tutorials.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the Linux kernel and the various Linux distributions that abound. 
You learned a little about the origins of Linux, and its progression from a system requiring the skills of a 
computer programmer to use into the easy-to-use distributions available today.
Linux offers several notable advantages; it’s free to download (in most cases), it can be tried out before 
installing, it comes preloaded with lots of software-the list goes on.
You looked at three distributions: Ubuntu, Zorin OS, and Linux Mint. While they are all the same on a 
core level, each distribution has unique features built into it. Ubuntu is a very popular distribution around 
the world, with device compatibility being one of its strongest points. Zorin OS is designed to help transition 
newcomers accustomed to working in the Windows environment into a Linux environment. Linux Mint is a 
popular distribution with a clean, modern look.
For those who embrace using a Linux distribution as their OS of choice, it’s worth considering giving 
back to the Linux community in some way, from financial donations to lending expertise on help forums.

Mr. David is very active in his advocacy for GIMP. When asked about the advantages of working with free 
and open source software, his response was this: “The main advantage of F/OSS to me is the community and 
communication directly with the developers of the tools I use. I’ve been able to build friendships with the 
project developers and have been lucky enough to get some ideas integrated into the software. Everyone has 
been fantastic in the communities to learn from and it’s very rewarding to help others realize what they can 
accomplish using free software!”
